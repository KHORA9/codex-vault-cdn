Nothing\r\nin myself nor in my life would warrant me in so doing.\r\n\r\nI might, perhaps, except the story of the Civil War, and my part in the\r\ntrials and sorrows of my fellow-women, but this story I have fully and\r\ntruly told in my \"Reminiscences of Peace and War.\"\r\n\r\nMy countrymen were so kind to these first stories that I feel I may\r\nclaim some credentials as a \"babbler of Reminiscences.\" Besides, I have\r\nlived in the last two-thirds of the splendid nineteenth century, and\r\nhave known some of the men and women who made that century notable. And\r\nI would fain believe with Mr. Trollope that \"the small records of an\r\nunimportant individual life, the memories which happen to linger in the\r\nbrain of the old like bits of drift-wood floating round and round in\r\nthe eddies of a back-water, can more vividly than anything else bring\r\nbefore the young of the present generation those ways of acting and\r\nthinking and talking in the everyday affairs of life which indicate the\r\ndifferences between themselves and their grandfathers.\"\r\n\r\nBut I shall have more than this \"floating driftwood\" to reward the\r\nreader who will follow me to the end of my story!\r\n\r\nWriters of Reminiscences are interested—perhaps more interested than\r\ntheir readers—in recalling their earliest sensations, and through them\r\ndetermining at what age they had \"found themselves\"; _i.e._ become\r\nconscious of their own personality and relation to the world they had\r\nentered.\r\n\r\nLong before this time the child has seen and learned more perhaps than\r\nhe ever learned afterwards in the same length of time. He has acquired\r\nknowledge of a language sufficient for his needs. His miniature world\r\nhas been, in many respects, a foreshadowing of the world he will know\r\nin his maturity. He has learned that he is a citizen of a country with\r\nlaws,—some of which it will be prudent to obey,—such as the law against\r\ntaking unpermitted liberties with the cat, or touching the flame of\r\nthe candle; while other laws may be evaded by cleverness and discreet\r\nbehavior. He finds around him many things; pictures on walls, for\r\ninstance, that may be admired but never touched,—other lovely things\r\nthat may be handled and even kissed, but must be returned to mantels\r\nand tables,—and yet others, not near as delightful as these, \"poor\r\nthings but his own,\" to be caressed or beaten, or even broken at his\r\npleasure. He has learned to indulge his natural taste for the drama. His\r\nnurse covers her head with a paper and becomes the dreadful, groaning\r\nvillain behind it, while the baby girds himself for attack, tears the\r\ndisguise from the villain, and shouts his victory. As he learns the\r\nnames and peculiarities of animals, the scope of the drama widens. He is\r\na spirited horse, snorting and charging along, or—if his picture-books\r\nhave been favorable—a roaring lion from whom the nurse flees in terror.\r\nOf the domestic play there is infinite variety—nursing in sickness, the\r\ndoctor, baby-tending, cooking,—and once, alas! I heard a baby girl of\r\neighteen months enact a fearful quarrel between man and wife, ending\r\nfirmly \"I leave you! I never come back!\"\r\n\r\nThese natural tendencies of children would seem to prove that the soul\r\nor mind of man can be \"fetched up from the cradle\"—a phrase for which\r\nI am indebted to one of my contemporaries, Mr. Leigh Hunt, who in turn\r\nquoted it as a popular phrase in his late (and my early) day. But with\r\nthe single exception of the spoken language all these childish plays\r\nhave been successfully taught to our humble brothers; to our poor\r\nrelation the monkey, the dog, elephant, seal, canary bird—even to fleas.\r\nAll these are capable of enacting a short drama. The elephant, longing\r\nfor his bottle, never rings his bell too soon. The dog remembers his\r\ncue, watches for it, and never anticipates it. The seal, more wonderful\r\nthan all, born as he has been without arms or legs, mounts a horse for\r\na ride, and waits for his umbrella to be poised on his stubby nose.\r\nEven the creature whose name is a synonym for vulgar stupidity has been\r\ntaught to indicate with porcine finger the letters which spell that\r\nname.\r\n\r\nWith these and other animals we hold in common our faculty of imitation,\r\nour memory, affection, antipathy, revenge, gratitude, passionate\r\nadoration of one special friend, and even the perception of music—the\r\ninfant will weep and the poodle howl in response to the same strain\r\nin a minor key—and yet, notwithstanding this common lot, this common\r\ninheritance, there is born for us and not for them a moment when some\r\nstrange unseen power breathes into us something akin to consciousness\r\nof a living soul.\r\n\r\nHaving no past as a standard for the reasonable and natural, nothing\r\nsurprises children. They are simply witnesses of a panorama in the\r\nmoving scenes of which they have no part. When I was three years old,\r\nI visited my grandfather in Charlotte County. The Staunton River wound\r\naround his plantation and I was often taken out rowing with my aunts.\r\nOne day the canoe tipped and my pretty Aunt Elizabeth fell overboard.\r\nWithout the slightest emotion I saw her fall, and saw her recovered.\r\nFor aught I knew to the contrary it was usual and altogether proper\r\nfor young ladies to fall in rivers and be fished out by their long\r\nhair. But another event, quite ordinary, overwhelmed me with the most\r\npassionate distress. Having, a short time before, advanced a tentative\r\nfinger for an experimental taste of an apple roasting for me at my\r\ngrandfather's fire, I was prepared to be shocked at seeing a colony of\r\nants rush madly about upon wood a servant was laying over the coals.\r\nMy cries of distress arrested my grandfather as he passed through the\r\nroom. He quickly ordered the sticks to be taken off, and calling me\r\nto a seat in front of him, said gravely: \"We will try these creatures\r\nand see if they deserve punishment. Evidently they have invaded our\r\ncountry. The question is, did they come of their own accord, or were\r\nthey while enjoying their rights of life and liberty, captured by us\r\nand brought hither against their will?\" My testimony was gravely taken.\r\nI was quite positive I had seen the sticks, swarming with ants, laid\r\nupon the fire. \"Uncle Peter,\" who had brought in the wood, was summoned\r\nand sharply cross-questioned. Nothing could shake him. To the best\r\nof his knowledge and belief, \"them ants nuvver come 'thouten they was\r\n'bleeged to,\" and so, as they were by this time wildly scampering over\r\nthe floor, they were gently admonished by a persuasive broom to leave\r\nthe premises. Uncle Peter was positive they would find their way home\r\nwithout difficulty, and I was comforted.\r\n\r\nI remember this little incident perfectly; I can see my dear\r\ngrandfather, his white hair tied with a black ribbon _en queue_,\r\nadvancing his stick like a staff of office. I claim that then and\r\nthere—three years old—I found myself, \"fetched up my soul\" from\r\nsomewhere, almost \"from the cradle,\" inasmuch as I had pitied\r\nthe unfortunate, unselfishly espoused his cause, and won for him\r\nconsideration and justice.\r\n\r\nWriters of fiction are supposed to present, as in a mirror, the truth\r\nas it is found in nature. They are fond of hinting that at some moment\r\nin the early life of every individual something occurs which foreshadows\r\nhis fate, something which if interpreted—like the dreams of the ancient\r\nHebrews—would tell us without the aid of gypsy, medium, or clairvoyant\r\nthe things we so ardently desire to know. In Daniel Deronda, Gwendolyn,\r\nin her moment of triumph, touches a spring in a panel, which, sliding\r\nback, reveals a picture,—the upturned face of a drowning man. In Lewis\r\nRand, Jacqueline, the bride of half an hour, hears the story of a\r\nduel—and the pistol-shot echoes ever after through her brain, filling\r\nit with insistent foreboding.\r\n\r\nWe might recall illustrations of similar foreshadowing in real life. For\r\ninstance, Jean Carlyle, six years old, beautiful and vivid as a tropical\r\nbird, stands before an audience to sing her little song; and waits in\r\nvain for her accompanist. Finally she throws her apron over her head and\r\nruns away in confusion. _She_ was prepared, she knew her part; but the\r\nsupport was lacking, the accompaniment failed her. It was not given to\r\nhim who told the story to perceive the prophecy!\r\n\r\nWere I fanciful enough to fix upon one moment as prophetic of my life—as\r\na key-note to the controlling principle of that life—I might recall the\r\nincident in my grandfather's room, when I ceased to be merely an inert\r\nabsorber of light and warmth and comfort, and became aware of the _pain_\r\nin the world—pain which I passionately longed to alleviate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nI had a childless aunt, who annually came up from her home in Hanover to\r\nspend part of the summer with my parents and my grandfather. She begged\r\nme of my mother for a visit, meant to be a brief one, and as she was\r\ngreatly loved and respected by her people, I was permitted to return\r\nwith her.\r\n\r\nThere were no railroads in Virginia at that time. All journeys were made\r\nin private conveyances. The great coach-and-four had disappeared after\r\nthe Revolution. The carriage and pair, with the goatskin hair trunk\r\nstrapped on behind, or—in case the journey were long—a light wagon for\r\nbaggage, were now enough for the migratory Virginian.\r\n\r\nHe lived at home except for the three summer months, when it was his\r\ninvariable rule to visit Saratoga, or the White Sulphur, Warm, and Sweet\r\nSprings, of Virginia, making a journey to the latter, in something less\r\nthan a week, now accomplished from New York in eight or nine hours.\r\n\r\nThe carriage on high springs creaked and rocked like a ship at sea.\r\nFortunately, it was well cushioned and padded within—and furnished at\r\nthe four corners with broad double straps through which the arms of\r\nthe passenger could be thrust to steady himself withal. He needed them\r\nin the pitching and jolting over the rocks and ruts of dreadful roads.\r\nInside each door were ample pockets for sundry comforts—biscuits,\r\nsandwiches, apples, restorative medicines and cordials, books and\r\npapers. A flight of three or four carpeted steps was folded inside the\r\ndoor. Twenty-five miles were considered \"a day's journey,\" quite enough\r\nfor any pair of horses. At noon the latter were rested under the shade\r\nof trees near some spring or clear brook, the carriage cushions were\r\nlaid out, and the luncheon! Well, I cannot presume to be greater than\r\nthe greatest of all our American artists,—he who could mould a hero in\r\nbronze and make him live again; and hold us, silent and awed, in the\r\npresence of the mysterious and unspeakable grief of a woman in marble!\r\nHas he not confessed that although he remembers an early perception of\r\nbeauty in sky and sea, and field and wood—the memory that has followed\r\nhim vividly through life is of odors from a baker's oven, and from\r\napples stewing in a German neighbor's kitchen? Hot gingerbread and\r\nspiced, sugared apples! I should say so, indeed!\r\n\r\nIn just such a carriage as I have described, I set forth with my strange\r\naunt and uncle—a little three-and-a-half-year-old! At night we slept in\r\nsome country tavern, surrounded by whispering aspen trees. A sign in\r\nfront, swung like a gibbet, promised \"Refreshment for man and beast.\"\r\nInvariably the landlord, grizzled, portly, and solemn, was lying at\r\nlength on a bench in his porch or lounging in a \"split-bottom chair\"\r\nwith his feet on the railing. He had seen our coming from afar. He\r\nwas eager for custom, but he had dignity to maintain. Lifting himself\r\nslowly from his bench or chair, he would leisurely come forward, and\r\nhesitatingly \"reckon\" he could accommodate us. I was mortally afraid of\r\nhim! Sinking into one of his deep feather beds, I trembled for my life\r\nand wept for my mother.\r\n\r\nFinally one night, wearied out with the long journey, we turned into\r\nan avenue of cedars and neared our home. My aunt and uncle, on the\r\ncushions of the back seat, little dreamed of the dire resolve of the\r\nsmall rebel in front. Like the ants, I had been brought, against my\r\nwill, to a strange country. I silently determined I would not be a good\r\nlittle girl. I would be as naughty as I could, give all the trouble I\r\ncould, and force them to send me home again. But with the morning sun\r\ncame perfect contentment, which soon blossomed into perfect happiness.\r\nFrom my bed I ran out in my bare feet to a lovely veranda shaded by\r\nroses. On one of the latticed bars a little wren bobbed his head in\r\ngreeting, and poured out his silver thread of a song. Gabriella, the\r\ngreat tortoise-shell cat, with high uplifted tail, wooed and won me;\r\nand when Milly, black and smiling, captured me, it was to introduce me\r\nto an adorable doll and a little rocking-chair.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour until I married I was the happy queen of the household,\r\nthe one whose highest good was wisely considered and for whose happiness\r\nall the rest lived.\r\n\r\nThe bond between my aunt and her small niece could never be sundered,\r\nand as she was greatly loved and trusted, and as many children blessed\r\nmy own dear mother, I was practically adopted as the only child of my\r\naunt and uncle, Dr. and Mrs. Samuel Pleasants Hargrave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general impression I retain of the world of my childhood is\r\nof gardens—gardens everywhere; abloom with roses, lilies, violets,\r\njonquils, flowering almond-trees which never fruited, double-flowering\r\npeach trees which also bore no fruit, but were, with the almond trees,\r\ncherished for the beauty of their blossoms. And conservatories! These\r\nbegan deep in the earth and were built two stories high at the back of\r\nthe house. They were entered by steps going down and only thus were they\r\nentered. Windows opened into them from the parlor (always \"parlor,\"—not\r\ndrawing-room) or from my lady's chamber. On the floor were great tubs\r\nof orange and lemon trees and the gorgeous flowering pomegranate. Along\r\nthe walls were shelves reached by short ladders, and on these shelves\r\nwere ranged cacti, gardenias (Cape Jessamine, or jasmine, as we knew\r\nthis queen of flowers), abutilon, golden globes of lantana, and the\r\nmuch-prized snowy Camellia Japonica, sure to sent packed in cotton as\r\ngifts to adorn the dusky tresses of some Virginia beauty, or clasp the\r\nfolds of her diaphanous kerchief. These camellias, long before they were\r\nimmortalized by the younger Dumas, were reckoned the most poetic and\r\nelegant of all flowers—so pure and sensitive, resenting the profanation\r\nof the slightest touch. No cavalier of that day would present to his\r\nladye faire the simple flowers we love to-day. These would come fast\r\nenough with the melting of the snows early in February.\r\n\r\nI have never forgotten the ecstasy of one of these early February\r\nmornings. Mittened and hooded I ran down the garden walk from which the\r\nsnow had been swept and piled high on either side. Delicious little\r\nrivers were running down and I launched a mighty fleet of leaves\r\nand sticks. Suddenly I beheld a miracle. The snow was lying thickly\r\nall around, but the sun had melted it from a south bank, and white\r\nviolets—hundreds of them—had popped out. I spread my apron on the clean\r\nsnow and filled it with the cool, crisp blossoms. Running in exultant\r\nI poured my treasure into my dear aunt's lap as she sat on a low chair\r\nwhich brought my head just on a level with her bosom. Ah! Like St.\r\nGaudens, I remember the gingerbread and apples!—but I remember the\r\nviolets also!\r\n\r\nI can see myself in the early hot summer, sent forth to breathe the\r\ncool air of the morning. What a paradise of sweets met my senses!\r\nThe squares, crescents, and circles edged with box, over which an\r\nenchanted glistening veil had been thrown during the night; the tall\r\nlilacs, snowballs, myrtles, and syringas, guarding like sentinels\r\nthe entrance to every avenue; the glowing beds of tulips, pinks,\r\npurple iris, \"bleeding hearts,\" flowering almond with rosy spikes,\r\nlily-of-the-valley! I scanned them all with curious eyes. Did I not\r\nknow that the fairies, riding on butterflies, had visited each one and\r\npainted it during the night? Did I not know that these same fairies\r\nhad hung their cups on the grass, and danced so long that the cups grew\r\nfast to the blades of grass and became lilies-of-the-valley? I knew all\r\nthis—although my dear aunt never approved of fairy tales and gave me\r\nno fairy-tale books. Cousin Charles believed them; moreover, I had a\r\ncharming picture of a fairy, riding on a butterfly. Of course they were\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nBut I always hurried along, with small delay, among the flower beds. I\r\nknew where the passion-vine had dropped golden globes of fruit during\r\nthe night—and I knew well where the cool figs, rimy with the early\r\ndew, were bursting with scarlet sweetness. Tell me not of your acrid\r\ngrape-fruit, or far-fetched orange, wherewithal to break the morning\r\nfast! I know of something better. Alas! neither you nor I can ever\r\nagain—except in fancy—cool our lips with the dew-washed fruits of an\r\n\"old Virginia\" garden.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the life we led at Cedar Grove and Shrubbery\r\nHill was busy beyond all parallel. Everything the family and the\r\nplantation needed was manufactured at home, except the fine fabrics,\r\nthe perfumes, wines, etc., which were brought from Richmond, Baltimore,\r\nor Philadelphia. Everything, from the goose-quill pen to carpets,\r\nbedspreads, coarse cotton cloth, and linsey-woolsey for servants'\r\nclothing, was made at home. Even corset-laces were braided of cotton\r\nthreads, the corset itself of home manufacture.\r\n\r\nMiss Betsey, the housekeeper, was the busiest of women. Besides her\r\neverlasting pickling, preserving, and cake-baking, she was engaged, with\r\nmy aunt, in mysterious incantations over cordials, tonics, camomile,\r\nwild cherry, bitter bark, and \"vinegar of the four thieves,\" to be used\r\nin sickness.\r\n\r\nThe recipe for the latter—well known in Virginia households a century\r\nago—was probably brought by Thomas Jefferson from France in 1794.\r\nHe was a painstaking collector of everything of practical value. To\r\nthis day there exists in the French druggists' code a recipe known as\r\nthe \"Vinaigre des Quatre Voleurs\"; and it is that given by condemned\r\nmalefactors who, according to official records still existing in France,\r\nentered deserted houses in the city of Marseilles during a yellow fever\r\nepidemic in the seventeenth century and carried off immense quantities\r\nof plunder. They seemed to possess some method of preserving themselves\r\nfrom the scourge. Being finally arrested and condemned to be burned\r\nto death, an offer was made to change the method of inflicting their\r\npunishment if they would reveal their secret. The condemned men then\r\nconfessed that they always wore over their faces handkerchiefs that\r\nhad been saturated in strong vinegar and impregnated with certain\r\ningredients, the principal one being bruised garlic.\r\n\r\nThe recipe, still preserved in the Randolph family of Virginia, is an\r\nodd one—with a homely flavor—hardly to be expected of a French formula.\r\nIt requires simply \"lavender, rosemary, sage, wormwood, rue and mint,\r\nof each a large handful; put them in a pot of earthenware, cover the\r\npot closely, and put a board on the top; keep it in the hottest sun two\r\nweeks, then strain and bottle it, putting in each a clove of garlic.\r\nWhen it has settled in the bottle and becomes clear, pour it off gently;\r\ndo this until you get it all free from sediment. The proper time to make\r\nit is when herbs are in full vigor, in June.\"\r\n\r\nOnly a housewife, who lived in an age of abundant leisure, could afford\r\nto interest herself for two weeks in the preparation of a bottle of the\r\n\"Vinegar of the Four Thieves.\" The housekeeper of to-day can steep her\r\nherbs, then strain them through one of the fine sieves in her pantry,\r\nthe whole operation costing little labor and time, with perhaps as good\r\nresults. If she is inclined to make the experiment, she will achieve\r\na decoction which has the merit at least of romance, the secret of\r\nits combination having been purchased by sparing the lives of four\r\ndistinguished Frenchmen, with the present practical value of providing\r\na refreshing prophylactic for the sick room,—provided the lavender,\r\nrosemary, sage, wormwood, rue, and mint completely stifle the clove of\r\ngarlic!\r\n\r\nPepper and spices were pounded in marble mortars. Sugar was purchased\r\nin the bulk—in large cones wrapped in thick blue paper. This was broken\r\ninto great slices, and then subdivided into cubes by means of a knife\r\nand hammer.\r\n\r\nSometimes a late winter storm would overtake the new-born lambs,\r\nand they would be found forsaken by the flock. The little shivering\r\ncreatures would be brought to a shelter, and fed with warm milk from\r\nthe long bottles, in which even now we get Farina Cologne. Soft linen\r\nwas wrapped around the slender neck, and my dear aunt fed the nurslings\r\nwith her own white hands. How the lambkins could wag their tiny tails!\r\nand how they grew and prospered!\r\n\r\nAll the fine muslins of the family, my aunt's great collars, and the\r\nruffles worn by my uncle, my Cousin Charles, and myself, were carefully\r\nlaundered under my aunt's supervision. Dipped in pearly starch, they\r\nwere \"clapped dry\" in our own hands, ironed with small irons, and\r\nbeautifully crimped on a board with a penknife. Fine linen was a kind\r\nof hall-mark by which a gentleman was \"known in the gates when he\" sat\r\n\"among the elders of the land.\"\r\n\r\nI was intensely interested in all this busy life—and always eager to be\r\na part of it.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing I had not attempted before I rounded my first\r\ndecade,—churning, printing the butter with wooden moulds, or shaping\r\nit into a bristling pineapple; spinning on tiptoe at the great wheel—we\r\nhad no flax-wheels—and even once scrambling up to the high seat of the\r\nweaver and sending the shuttle into hopeless tangles. \"Ladies don't\r\nnuvver do dem things\" sternly rebuked Milly. \"Lemme ketch you ergin\r\nat dat business, an' 'twont be wuf while for Marse Chawles to baig for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThe inconsistencies as to proprieties puzzled me then and have puzzled\r\nme ever since.\r\n\r\n\"Why mustn't I spin and churn, Milly?\" I insisted.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't I done tole you? Ladies don't nuvver do dem things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why can I help with the laces and muslins?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cause—ladies _does_ do dem things.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so I became an expert _blanchisseuse de fin_, as it was the one\r\nhousehold industry allowed my caste.\r\n\r\nThere was no railroad to bring us luxuries from the nearest\r\ntown—Richmond—twenty-five miles distant, and we depended upon the little\r\ncovered cart of Aunt Mary Miller. Aunt Mary and her husband, Uncle\r\nJacob, were old family servants who had been given their freedom. They\r\nlived at the foot of a hill near our house, and down the path, slippery\r\nwith fallen pine needles, I was often sent with Milly to summon Uncle\r\nJacob, who was the coachman. He was very old, and gray, and always\r\nunwilling to \"hitch up de new kerridge in dis bad weather.\" He would\r\nstand on the lawn and scan the horizon in every direction—and a dim,\r\ndistant haze was enough to daunt him. Aunt Mary was allowed to collect\r\neggs, poultry, and peacock's feathers from the neighbors, take them down\r\nto Richmond to her waiting customers, and return with sundry delightful\r\nthings,—Peter Parley's books, a wax doll, oranges and candy for me, and\r\nwonderful stories of the splendors she had seen. She had other stories\r\nthan these. One night \"a hant\" had walked around her cart and \"skeered\"\r\nher old horse \"pretty nigh outen his senses\"; as to herself, \"Humph,\r\nI'se used to hants.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Where_, Aunt Mary, tell me,\" I begged. With a furtive glance lest my\r\nelders would hear, she answered:—\r\n\r\n\"I ain't sayin' nothin'. Don't you go an' say _I_ tole you anythin'.\r\nJes you run down to the back of the gyardin as fur as the weepin' willer\r\nan' you'll know.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I knew already what I should find beneath the willow. I\r\nhad often stood at the foot of the two long white slabs and read:\r\n\"Sacred to the Memory of Charles Crenshaw\" and \"Sacred to the Memory of\r\nSusannah Crenshaw.\" I knew their story. This had been their home. The\r\nbrother had died early, and for love of him the sister had broken her\r\nheart. My sweet great-aunt Susannah! Had she not left a lovely Chinese\r\nbasket—which I was to inherit—full of curious and precious things; a\r\ncarved ivory fan, necklace, pearls, and amethysts, and a treasure of\r\nmusk-scented yellow lace? Aunt Mary shook her head when I announced\r\nscornfully that I wasn't afraid of my Aunt Susannah.\r\n\r\n\"I ain't talkin'! Miss Susannah used to war blue satin high-heeled\r\nslippers. You jes listen! Some o' dese dark nights you'll hear sump'n\r\ngoin' '_click, click_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, Aunt Mary. That's the death-head moth. Milly says it won't hurt\r\nanybody, without you meddle with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph! _Milly!_ I seed hants befo' her mammy was bawn! _I_ tells you\r\nit's Miss Susannah comin' on her high heels to see if you meddlin' with\r\nher things. I knowed Miss Susannah! she was monsous particlar. She ain't\r\nnuvver goin' to let you war _her_ things.\"\r\n\r\nI was a wretched child for a long time after this. Whenever I retired\r\ninto the inner chambers of my imagination—as was my wont when grown-up\r\npeople talked politics, or religion, or slavery—I found my pretty\r\nfairies all fled, and in their places hollow-eyed goblins and ghosts.\r\nIf my gentle Aunt Susannah was permitted to come back to her home, how\r\nabout all the others who had lived there? My aunt coming for her final\r\ngood-night kiss would uncover a hot face, to be instantly recovered\r\nupon her departure. _Par parenthèse_, I never did wear Aunt Susannah's\r\njewels. All disappeared mysteriously except the chain of lovely beads.\r\nThese I wore. One night I slept in them and the next morning they\r\nwere gone. Whither? Ah, you must call up some one of those long-time\r\nsleepers. According to latter-day lights, they may \"come when you do\r\ncall.\" They may know. I never did know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nNo house in Virginia was more noted for hospitality than my uncle's.\r\nI remember an ever coming and going procession of Taylors, Pendletons,\r\nFlemings, Fontaines, Pleasants, etc. These made small impression upon\r\nme. Men might come and men might go, but my lessons went on forever;\r\nwriting, geography, and much reading. I had Mrs. Sherwood's books. I\r\nwonder if any present-day child reads \"Little Henry and his Bearer,\"\r\nor Miss Edgeworth's \"Rosamond,\" or \"Peter Parley's Four Quarters of\r\nthe Globe\"! Hannah More was the great influence with my aunt and her\r\nfriends. \"Thee will be a second Hannah More\" was the highest praise the\r\nliterary family at Shrubbery Hill could possibly give me. Mr. Augustine\r\nBirrell could never have written his sarcastic review of her in my day.\r\nIt would not have been tolerated. From Miss Edgeworth, Cowper, Burns,\r\nSt. Pierre, my aunt read aloud to me. On every centre table, along with\r\nthe astral lamp, lay a sumptuous volume in cream and gold. This was\r\nthe elegant annual \"Friendship's Offering,\" containing the much-admired\r\npoems of one Alfred Tennyson, collaborating with his brother Charles.\r\nMiss Martineau was much discussed and was distinctly unpopular. Stories\r\nwere told of her peculiarities, her ignorance of the etiquette of polite\r\nsociety at the North. When she was in Washington in 1835, was invited\r\nby Mrs. Samuel Harrison Smith to an informal dinner at five o'clock.\r\nMrs. Smith had requested three friends to meet her, and had arranged\r\nfor \"a small, genteel dinner.\" She had descended to the parlor at an\r\nearly hour to arrange some flowers, when her daughter informed her that\r\nMiss Martineau and her companion, Miss Jeffrey, had arrived, and were\r\nupstairs in her bedroom, having requested to be shown to a chamber. Mrs.\r\nSmith wrote to Mrs. Kirkpatrick: \"I hastened upstairs and found them\r\ncombing their hair! They had taken off their bonnets and large capes.\r\n'You see,' said Miss Martineau, 'we have complied with your request\r\nand come sociably to spend the day with you. We have been walking all\r\nthe morning; our lodgings were too distant to return, so we have done\r\nas those who have no carriages do in England when they go to pass a\r\nsocial day.' I offered her combs, brushes, etc., but showing me the\r\nenormous pockets in her French dress she said that they were provided\r\nwith all that was necessary, and pulled out nice little silk shoes, silk\r\nstockings, a scarf for her neck, little lace mits, a gold chain, and\r\nsome other jewellery, and soon, without changing her dress, was prettily\r\nequipped for dinner or evening company. It was a rich treat to hear her\r\ntalk when the candles were lit and the curtains drawn. Her words flow\r\nin a continuous stream, her voice is pleasing, her manners quiet and\r\nladylike.\" She was thought to be unfriendly to the South—which I have\r\nthe best of reasons for believing was true.\r\n\r\nAll this I heard with unheeding ears, but a delicious, memorable hour\r\nawaited me. Some guest had brought her maid, and from her I heard a\r\nwonderful fairy-godmother story,—of one Cinderella, whose light footstep\r\nwould not break a glass slipper.\r\n\r\nUncle Remus had not yet dawned upon a waiting world of children, but\r\nCowper had written charmingly about hares and how to domesticate them.\r\nI had a flourishing colony of \"Little Rabs.\" Some of my humble friends\r\nwere domiciled in the small playhouse built for me in the garden. Into\r\nthis sacred refuge, ascended by a flight of tiny steps, even Gabriella\r\nwas forbidden to enter. I could just manage to stand under the low\r\nceiling. There I entertained a strange company. I had no toys of any\r\ndescription, and only one doll, which was much too fine for every day.\r\nFlowers and forked sticks served for the _dramatist personæ_ of my\r\nplays.\r\n\r\nI had never heard of Æsop or of Aristophanes, but it was early given to\r\nme to discern the excellent points of frogs. I caught a number of them\r\non the sandy margin of a little brook which ran at the bottom of the\r\ngarden, and Milly helped me to dress them in bits of muslin and lace.\r\nTheir ungraceful figures forbade their masquerading as ladies,—a frog\r\nhas \"no more waist than the continent of Africa,\"—but with caps and\r\nlong skirts they made admirable infants, creeping in the most orthodox\r\nfashion. Of course their prominent eyes and wide mouths left something\r\nto be desired; but these were very dear children, over whose mysterious\r\ndisappearance their adoptive mother grieved exceedingly. Could it be\r\nthat snakes—but no! The suggestion is too awful!\r\n\r\nMy aunt had a warm affection for a kinswoman who lived seven or eight\r\nmiles from us. This lady's gentleness and sweetness made her a welcome\r\nvisitor, and I never tired of hearing her talk, albeit her manner was\r\ntinged with sadness. She grieved over the disappearance, years before,\r\nof a dear young brother. He had simply dropped out of sight—her \"poor\r\nBrother Ben!\" This was a great mystery which she often discussed with\r\nmy aunt, and which delightfully stirred my imagination.\r\n\r\nOne night late in summer a cold storm of rain and wind howled without\r\nand beat against the window-panes. A fire was kindled on the hearth, and\r\naround it the family gathered for a cosey evening. Suddenly some one\r\nsaw a face pressed against the window, and hastened to open the door\r\nto the benighted visitor. There, dripping upon the threshold, stood a\r\nwretched-looking man. It was Brother Ben!\r\n\r\nHe carried a bundle of blankets on his back which he proceeded to\r\nunwind, revealing at last two tiny Indian girls! The frightened little\r\ncreatures clung to him closely, and only after being brought to the\r\nfire and fed on warm milk were sufficiently reassured to permit him to\r\nexplain himself. With one on each knee, \"Brother Ben\" told his story. He\r\nhad run away to escape the restraints of home and had found his way to\r\nthe wild Western country beyond the Ohio. Friendly Indians had sheltered\r\nand succored him, and he had finally married a young daughter of their\r\nchief. When his children were born, he \"came to himself.\" He could not\r\nendure the prospect of rearing them among savages, and so had stolen\r\nthem from their mother's wigwam during her temporary absence, and was\r\nwell on his way before his theft was discovered. For days and nights\r\nhe was in the wilderness, fording rivers, climbing mountains, hiding\r\nunder the bushes at night. Finally he overtook a party of homeward-bound\r\nhuntsmen, and in their company succeeded in reaching his sister's door.\r\n\r\nI never knew what became of him, but the children were adopted by their\r\naunt as her own. They were queer little round creatures, knowing no\r\nword of English, but affectionate and docile. I was much with them,\r\ndelighting to teach them. I cared no more for Gabriella nor my rabbits\r\nand frogs. I thought no more of fairies and midnight apparitions. Here\r\nwas food enough for imagination, different from anything I had ever\r\ndreamed of,—romance brought to my very door.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the Indian mother, far away towards the setting sun, wept\r\nfor her babes, but nobody, excepting myself, seemed to think of her.\r\nCould I write to her? Could I, some day, find a huntsman going westward\r\nand send her a message? She might even come to them! Some dark night I\r\nmight see her dusky face pressed against the window-pane, peering in!\r\n\r\nAs time wore on, the children grew to be great girls, and their Indian\r\npeculiarities of feature and coloring became so pronounced that they\r\nwere constantly wounded by being mistaken for mulattoes. There was no\r\nschool in Virginia where they could be happy. No lady would willingly\r\nallow her little girls to associate with them. Evidently there was no\r\nfuture for them in Virginia. Finally their aunt found through our Quaker\r\nfriends an excellent school, I think in Ohio, and thither the little\r\nwanderers were sent, were kindly treated, were educated, and grew up to\r\nbe good women who married well.\r\n\r\nMy aunt made many long journeys—across the state to the White Sulphur\r\nSprings of which I remember nothing but crowds and discomfort—to\r\nAmherst, where my father lived, to Charlotte to visit my grandfather,\r\nand to Albemarle to visit friends among the mountains. She joined\r\nhouse-parties for a few weeks every summer; and one of these I, then a\r\nvery little child, can perfectly recollect.\r\n\r\nThe country house, like all Virginia houses, was built of elastic\r\nmaterial capable of sheltering any number of guests, many of whom\r\nremained all summer. Indeed, this was expected when a visit was\r\npromised. \"My dear sir,\" said the master of Westover to a departing\r\nguest who had sought shelter from a rain-storm, \"My dear sir, do stay\r\nand pay us a visit.\"\r\n\r\nThe guest pleaded business that forbade his compliance. \"Well, well,\"\r\nsaid Major Drewry, \"if you can't pay us a visit, come for two or three\r\nweeks at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Week ends\" were unknown in Virginia, and equally out of the question an\r\ninvitation limited by the host to prescribed days and hours. Sometimes\r\na happy guest would ignore time altogether and stay along from season\r\nto season. I cannot remember a parallel case to that of Isaac Watts,\r\nwho, invited by Sir Thomas Abney to spend a night at Stoke Newington,\r\naccepted with great cheerfulness and staid twenty years, but I do\r\nremember that an invitation for one night brought to a member of our\r\nfamily a pleasant couple who remained four years. Virginia was excelled,\r\nit seems, by the mother country.\r\n\r\nAt this my first house-party there were many young people—among them\r\nthe famous beauty, Anne Carmichael, and the then famous poet and\r\nnovelist, Jane Lomax. These, with a number of bright young men, made a\r\ngay party. Every moonlight night it was the custom to bring the horses\r\nto the door-steps, and all would mount and go off for a visit to some\r\nneighbor. I was told, however, that the object of these nocturnal rides\r\nwas to enable Miss Lomax to write poetry on the moon, and I was sorely\r\nperplexed as to the possibility, without the longest kind of a pen, of\r\naccomplishing such a feat. I spent hours reasoning out the problem,\r\nand had finally almost brought myself to the point of consulting the\r\nyoung lady herself,—although I distinctly thought there was something\r\nmysterious and uncanny about her,—when something occurred which strained\r\nrelations between her and myself.\r\n\r\nAn uninteresting bachelor from town had appeared on the scene, to the\r\nchagrin of the young people, whose circle was complete without him. He\r\nbelonged to the class representing in that day the present-day \"little\r\nbrothers of the rich,\" often the most agreeable relations the rich can\r\nboast, but in this case decidedly the reverse.\r\n\r\nIt was thought that the present intruder was \"looking for a wife,\"—he\r\nhad been known to descend upon other house-parties without an\r\ninvitation,—and it was deliberately determined to give him the most\r\nfrigid of cold shoulders. Our amiable hostess, however, emphatically\r\nput a stop to this. I learned the state of things and resented it.\r\n\"Old True,\" as he was irreverently nicknamed, was a friend of mine. I\r\nresolved to devote myself to him, and to espouse his cause against his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nOne day when the young ladies were together in my aunt's room there was\r\ngreat merriment over the situation in regard to \"old True,\" and many\r\njests to his disadvantage related and laughed over. To my great delight\r\nMiss Lomax presently announced: \"Now, girls, this is all nonsense! Mr.\r\nTrueheart is a favorite of mine. I shall certainly accept him if he asks\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nI believed her literally. I saw daylight for my injured friend, and\r\nimmediately set forth to find him. He was sitting alone under the trees,\r\non the lawn, and welcomed the little girl tripping over the grass to\r\nkeep him company. On his knee I eagerly gave him my delightful news, and\r\nsaw his face illumined by it. I was perfectly happy—and so, he assured\r\nme, was he!\r\n\r\nThat evening my aunt observed an unwonted excitement in my face and\r\nmanner—and after feeling my pulse and hot cheeks decided I was better\r\noff in bed, and sent me to my room, which happened to be in a distant\r\npart of the house. To reach it I had to go through a long, narrow,\r\ndark hall. I always traversed this hall at night with bated breath.\r\nTiny doors were let into the wall near the floor, opening into small\r\napertures then known by the obsolescent name of \"cuddies.\" I was\r\nafraid to pass them. So far from the family, nobody would hear me if I\r\nscreamed. Suppose something were to jump out at me from those cuddies!\r\n\r\nIn the middle of this fearsome place I heard quick steps behind. Before\r\nI could run or scream, strong fingers gripped my shoulders and shook\r\nme, and a fierce whisper hissed in my ear—\"_You little devil!_\"\r\n\r\nIt was the poetess—the lady who wrote verses on the moon! \"Old True\"\r\nhad suffered no grass to grow under his feet!\r\n\r\nHe left early next morning and so did we—my aunt perceiving that the\r\nexcitement of the gay house-party was not good for me.\r\n\r\nI learned there were other things besides hot roast apples to be\r\navoided. Fingers might be burned by meddling with people's love affairs.\r\n\r\nWe were not the only guests who left the hospitable, gay, noisy,\r\nsleep-forbidding house. Our host had an eccentric sister whom we all\r\naddressed as \"Cousin Betsey Michie,\" and who had left her own home\r\nexpressly to spend a few weeks here with my aunt, to whom she was much\r\nattached. When \"Cousin Betsey\" discovered our intended departure, she\r\nordered her maid \"Liddy\" to pack her trunk,—a little nail-studded box\r\ncovered with goatskin,—and insisted upon claiming us as her guests for\r\nthe rest of the season.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin Betsey\" was to me a terrible old lady,—large, masculine,\r\n\"hard-favored,\" and with a wart on her chin. I wondered what I should\r\ndo, were she ever to kiss me,—which she never did,—and had made up my\r\nmind to keep away from her as far as possible. I owed her nothing, I\r\nreasoned, as she was not really my cousin. She used strong language,\r\nand was intolerant of all the singing, dancing, and midnight rides of\r\nthe young people. Her room was immediately beneath mine. But the night\r\nbefore, lying awake after my startling interview with the poetess, I\r\nhad heard the galloping horses of the party returning from a midnight\r\nvisit to \"Edgeworth,\" and the harsh voice of Cousin Betsey calling to\r\nher sister: \"Maria, Maria! Don't you dare get out of bed to give those\r\nscamps supper—a passel of ramfisticated villains, cavorting all over\r\nthe country like wild Indians.\"\r\n\r\nA peal of musical laughter, and \"Oh, Cousin Betsey!\" was the answer of\r\na merry horsewoman below.\r\n\r\nAs we heard much about Johnsonian English from Cousin Betsey, it was\r\nreasonable to suppose, my aunt thought, that the startling word was\r\nclassic.\r\n\r\nOne evening while we were her guests she suddenly asked if I could\r\nwrite. I was about to give her an indignant affirmative, when my aunt\r\ninterrupted, \"Not very well.\" She knew I should be pressed into service\r\nas a secretary.\r\n\r\n\"She ought to learn,\" said Cousin Betsey. \"My own writing is more like\r\nGreek than English since my eyes fail me. Maria Gordon has been copying\r\nfor me, but such fantastic flourishes! It will be Greek copied into\r\nSanskrit if _she_ does it. Well, what can the child do? Come here, miss.\r\nAre your hands clean? Ah! Wash them again, honey; you must help Liddy\r\nmake the Fuller's pies for my dinner-party to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nI was aghast! But I found the \"Fuller's pies\" were quite within my\r\npowers. \"Pie\" was not the American institution, but the bird supposed to\r\nhide itself in its nest. \"_Je m'en vais chercher un grand peut-estre. Il\r\nest au nid de la pie_,\" says Rabelais. As to my hands—I feel persuaded\r\nthat Cousin Betsey's guests would have been reassured could they have\r\nknown to a certainty the old lady had not prepared them with her own!\r\nA glass bowl was placed before me forthwith,—a bowl of boiling water,\r\nsome almonds and raisins. \"Liddy\" blanched the almonds in the hot\r\nwater and instructed me to press each one neatly into a large raisin,\r\nwhich, puffing out around the nut, made it resemble an acorn, or,\r\nto the instructed, a nest. These were the \"pies\" (birds in a nest),\r\nand very attractive they were, piled in the quaint old bowl with its\r\nfine diamond cutting. As to the \"Fuller\" thus immortalized, I looked\r\nhim up, furtively, in the great Johnson's Dictionary which lay in\r\nsolitary grandeur upon a table in the old lady's bedroom. Finding him\r\nunsatisfactory, I concluded Dr. Johnson was not, after all, the great\r\nman Cousin Betsey would have me believe. She quoted him on all occasions\r\nas authority upon all subjects. Boswell's Life of him, \"Rasselas,\" \"The\r\nJourney to the Hebrides,\" and \"The Rambler\" held places of honor upon\r\nthe shelves of her small bookcase. \"Read these, child,\" she reiterated,\r\n\"and you need read nothing else. They will teach you to speak and write\r\n_English_,—you need no other language,—and everything else you need know\r\nexcept sewing and cooking.\" I soon became interested in her own literary\r\nwork. She was, at the moment, engaged in writing a novel, \"Some Fact and\r\nSome Fiction,\" which was to appear serially in the _Southern Literary\r\nMessenger_. I listened \"with all my ears\" to her talk concerning\r\nit with my aunt. It was to be a satire upon the affectations of the\r\nday—especially upon certain innovations in dress and custom brought\r\nby her cousin \"Judy,\" the accomplished wife of our late Minister to\r\nFrance, Mr. Rives, and transplanted upon the soil of Albemarle County;\r\nalso the introduction of Italian words to music in place of good old\r\nEnglish. The heroine was exquisitely simple, her muslin gown clasped\r\nwith a modest pearl brooch and a rose-geranium leaf. Her language was\r\nfine Johnsonian English—a sort of vitalized \"Lucilla,\" like the heroine\r\nin Miss Hannah More's \"Cœlebs.\" As to the Italian words for music, I\r\nblithely committed to memory this sarcastic travesty, sung for me in\r\nCousin Betsey's sonorous contralto:—\r\n\r\n     The Frog he did a'courting ride,\r\n       Rigdum bulamitty kimo—\r\n     With sword and buckler by his side—\r\n       Rigdum bulamitty kimo.\r\n\r\n     (_Chorus_)\r\n\r\n     Kimo naro, delta karo!\r\n       Kimo naro, kimo!\r\n     Strim stram promedidle larabob rig\r\n       Rigdum bulamitty kimo!\r\n\r\nThis was deemed a clever satire on the unintelligible Italian words of\r\nrecent songs, and ran through several verses, describing the Frog's\r\ncourtship of Mistress Mouse, who seems to have been a fair lady with\r\ndomestic habits who lived in a mill and was occupied with her spinning.\r\n\r\nI was full of anticipation on the great day of the dinner-party. Mrs.\r\nRives, Ella Page her niece, and little Amélie Rives—named for her\r\ngodmother the queen of France—were the only invited guests. The house\r\nwas spick and span. I filled a bowl with damask roses from the garden,\r\nsparing the microphylla clusters that hung so prettily over the front\r\nporch. The dinner was to be at two o'clock.\r\n\r\nA few minutes before two a sable horseman galloped up to the door,\r\ndismounted, and, scraping his foot backward as he bared a head covered\r\nwith gray wool, presented a note which my aunt read aloud:—\r\n\r\n                                       \"CASTLE HILL, Wednesday noon.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR COUSIN BETSEY:—I know you will be amiable enough to\r\n     pardon me when I tell you how _désolée_ I am to find the hours\r\n     have flown unheeded by, and we are too late for your dinner!\r\n     The young ladies and I were reading Byron together, and you\r\n     know how\r\n\r\n          \"'Noiseless falls the foot of time\r\n          That only treads on flowers.'\r\n\r\n     I am sure you forgive us, and hope you will prove it by asking\r\n     us again.\r\n\r\n                            \"Your affectionate cousin,\r\n                                                     \"JUDITH RIVES.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an ominous pause—and then the old dame said, in her sternest\r\nmagisterial manner:—\r\n\r\n\"Tell Judy Rives to read Byron less—and Lord Chesterfield more.\" Turning\r\nto my aunt after the dignified old servitor had bowed himself out, she\r\nsaid, with fine scorn: \"There's no use in telling _her_ to read Dr.\r\nSamuel Johnson! '_Désolée_,' forsooth!—and 'the foot of time'! That\r\nsounds like that idiot, Tom Moore.\"\r\n\r\nI had a very good time at Cousin Betsey's. I helped to pick the berries\r\nand gather the eggs from the nests in the privet hedge. Also for several\r\ndays I had a steady diet of \"Fuller's pies.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the novel, if it appeared at all it fell upon the public ear with\r\na dull thud. Still, Cousin Betsey must have been, in her way, a great\r\nwoman, for it was of her that Thomas Jefferson exclaimed, \"God send she\r\nwere a man, that I might make her Professor in my University.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething akin to the tulip mania of Holland possessed the Southern\r\ncountry in the early thirties. The _Morus multicaulis_, upon the leaves\r\nof which the silkworm feeds, can be propagated from slips or cuttings.\r\nThese cuttings commanded a fabulous price. To plant them was to lay a\r\nsure foundation for a great fortune.\r\n\r\nMy uncle visited Richmond at a time when the mania had reached\r\nfever-heat. Men hurried through the streets, with bundles of twigs under\r\ntheir arms, as if they were flying from an enemy. All over the city\r\nauction sales were held, and fortunes lost or gained—as they are to-day\r\nin Wall Street—with the fluctuations of the market. \"I saw old Jerry\r\nWhite running with a bundle of sticks under his arm as if the devil\r\nwere after him,\" said my uncle,—lazy, rheumatic old Jerry, who had not\r\nfor years left his chimney corner in winter, or the bench upon which he\r\nbasked like a lizard in summer, except to eat and sleep!\r\n\r\nLong galleries, roofed with glass, were hastily erected all over the\r\ncountry, the last year's eggs of the _Bombyx mori_ obtained at great\r\nprice, and the freshly gathered leaves of the _Morus multicaulis_ laid\r\nin readiness for their hatching.\r\n\r\nMy uncle ridiculed this madness, although as a physician it interested\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"It does people good to stir them up,\" he declared. \"It wakes up their\r\nlivers and keeps them out of mischief. It is a fine tonic. They will\r\nneed no bark and camomile while the fever lasts.\"\r\n\r\nWe made a pilgrimage to the distant farm of one of the maniacs. With\r\nmy narrow skirts drawn closely around me, I tiptoed gingerly along the\r\naisles dividing the long tables, and saw the hideous, grayish yellow,\r\nthree-inch worms—each one armed with a rhinoceros-like horn on his\r\nhead—devouring leaves for dear life. They had need for haste. Their time\r\nwas short. Think of the millions of brave men and fair ladies who were\r\nwaiting for the strong, shining threads it was their humble destiny\r\nto spin! Meanwhile, the lazy moths, their _raison d'être_ having been\r\naccomplished, enjoyed in elegant leisure the evening of their days\r\nof beneficence. I saw the ease with which their spider-web thread was\r\ncaught in hot water, and wound in balls as easily as I wound the wools\r\nfor my aunt's knitting.\r\n\r\nNothing came of it all! In time all the _Morus multicaulis_ was dug up,\r\nand good, sensible corn planted in its stead. Old Jerry found again his\r\nwarm seat by the ingleside, where doubtless he\r\n\r\n     \"backward mused on wasted time,\"\r\n\r\nand many a better man than poor Jerry was stricken with amazement at\r\nhis own folly. Does not _Morus_ come from the Greek word for \"fool\"?\r\n\r\nNext to his Bible and the Westminster Catechism, my uncle pinned his\r\nfaith to the _Richmond Whig_. Henry Clay was his idol. To make Henry\r\nClay President of the United States was something to live for. When\r\nthe great man passed through Virginia, all Hanover went to Richmond to\r\ndo him honor, ourselves among the number. He was a son of Hanover, the\r\n\"Mill boy of the Slashes.\" The old Mother of Presidents could, never\r\nfear, give yet another son to the country! No living man except Webster\r\nequalled him in all that the world holds essential to greatness—none\r\nwas as dear to the mass of people. And yet neither could be elected to\r\nthe post of Chief Magistrate of those adoring people!\r\n\r\nClay, at the time he visited Richmond, was confident he would win this\r\nhonor. My uncle resolved I should see \"the next President.\" A procession\r\nof citizens was to conduct him to a hall where a banquet awaited him. My\r\nuncle found a vacant doorstep on the line of march, and there we awaited\r\nthe great man's coming. \"Ah, there he comes!\" exclaimed my uncle. \"Look\r\nwell, little girl! You may never again see the greatest man in the\r\nworld.\" But to look was impossible. The crowd thronged us, and my uncle\r\ncaught me to a vantage-ground on his shoulder. A tumbling sea of hats\r\nwas all I could see! Presently a space appeared in the procession, and a\r\ntall man on the arm of another looked up with a rare smile to the small\r\nmaiden, lifted his hat, and bowed to her! My uncle never allowed me to\r\nforget that one supreme moment in my child-life. To this day I cannot\r\nlook at the fine bronze statuette of Henry Clay in my husband's library\r\nwithout a sensation born of the pride of that hour.\r\n\r\nI am afraid the small maiden dearly loved glory! Nobody would ever\r\nhave guessed the ambitious little heart beating, the next winter,\r\nunder the cherry merino; nor the conscious lips deep in her poke-bonnet\r\nthat followed the prayers at church and implored mercy for a miserable\r\nsinner! For she had, during that glorious summer, another shining hour\r\nto remember. Those penitent lips had been kissed by a great man all the\r\nway from England—a man who had kissed the hand of a queen! She had a dim\r\napprehension of virtue through the laying on of hands in church. What,\r\nthen, might not come in the way of royal attribute from the laying on\r\nof lips!\r\n\r\nGreat thoughts like these so swelled my bosom that I was fain to reveal\r\nthem to my little Quaker cousin at Shrubbery Hill. She received them\r\ngravely. \"Oh, Sara Agnes,\" she ventured, \"I am afraid thee is going\r\nto be one of the world's people!\" All the same she had just dressed\r\nher doll Isabella in black silk, with a lace mantilla! The Princess\r\nIsabella, born, like myself, in 1830, was even then known as the future\r\nqueen of Spain. It was an age of young queens.\r\n\r\nAmong the strangers from abroad who found their way to Virginia, none\r\nwas more honored in Hanover than the Quaker author and philanthropist,\r\nJoseph John Gurney. He was the brother of Elizabeth Fry, who gave her\r\nlife to the amelioration of the prison horrors of England.\r\n\r\nMy uncle entertained Dr. Gurney. The house was filled with guests to its\r\nutmost capacity. A picture of the long dining-tables rises before me—the\r\ngold-and-white best service, the flowers—and the sweetest flower of all,\r\nmy young aunt. She was tall and graceful and very beautiful,—with large\r\ngray eyes, dark curls framing her face, delicate features, a lovely\r\nsmile! She wore a narrow gown of pearl silk, the \"surplice\" waist belted\r\nhigh, and sleeves distended at the top by means of feather cushions tied\r\nin the armholes. I remember my uncle ordered the dinner to be served\r\nquietly and in a leisurely manner. \"These Englishmen eat deliberately,\"\r\nhe said. \"Only Americans bolt their food.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after the dinner company had left, a small party\r\ngathered around the astral lamp in the parlor, and Dr. Gurney drew forth\r\nhis scrap-book and pencils, and began, as he talked, to retouch sketches\r\nhe had made during his journey. The parlor was simply furnished. The\r\nVirginian of that day seemed to attach small importance to the style\r\nof his furniture. His chief pride was in his table, his fine wines, his\r\nhorses and equipage, and the perfect comfort he could give his guests.\r\nThere was no bric-a-brac, there were no pictures or brackets on the\r\nwall. \"I have now,\" said an artist to me, \"seen everything hung on\r\nAmerican walls except buckwheat cakes! I have seen the plate in which\r\nthey were served.\"\r\n\r\nThis parlor at Cedar Grove admitted but one picture—a fine copy over\r\nthe mantel of the School of Athens, which my cousin Charles had brought\r\nas a present for my aunt, when he last returned from abroad. She was\r\nnot responsible for the taste of this inherited home, which she had\r\nnot tenanted very long. The walls of the parlor were papered with a\r\nwonderful representation of a Venetian scene—printed at intervals\r\nof perhaps four or more feet. There was a castle with turrets and\r\nbattlements; and a marble stair, flanked with roses in pots, descending\r\ninto the water. Down this stair came the most adorable creature in\r\nthe world,—roses on her brocade gown, roses on her broad hat,—and at\r\nthe foot of the stair a cavalier, also adorable, extended his hand\r\nto conduct her to the gondola in waiting. In the distance were more\r\ncastles, more sea, more gondolas.\r\n\r\nIn this room the distinguished stranger met the company convened in\r\nhis honor. If he gasped or shuddered at the ornate walls, he gave no\r\nsign. The little girl on the ottoman in the chimney corner, permitted\r\nto sit up late because of the rare occasion, listened with wide\r\neyes to conversation she could not understand. Weighty matters were\r\ndiscussed,—for all the world was alive to the question which had to\r\nbe met later,—the possibility of freeing the slaves under the present\r\nconstitutional laws. This was a small gathering of the wise men of our\r\nneighborhood—come to consult a wise man from the country that had met\r\nand solved a similar problem. Perhaps all of these men had, like my\r\nuncle, given freedom to inherited slaves.\r\n\r\nPresently I found myself, as I half dreamed in the corner, caught up\r\nby strong arms to the bosom of the great man himself. Bending over the\r\nsleepy head, he whispered a strange story—how that, far away across the\r\nseas, there was once a little girl \"just like you\" who loved her play,\r\nand loved to sit up and hear grown people talk—how a lady came to her\r\none day and said, \"My child, you must study and learn to deny yourself\r\nmuch pleasure, for soon you will be the queen of England\"—how the little\r\ngirl neither laughed nor cried, but said, \"I will be good\"—how time\r\nhad gone on, and she had kept her promise and was now grown up to be a\r\nlovely lady; and sure enough, just a little while ago had been crowned\r\nqueen—and how everybody was glad, because they knew, as she had been a\r\ngood child, she would be a good queen.\r\n\r\nThat was a long time ago. Many things have happened and been forgotten\r\nsince then; the Venetian lady and her cavalier have sailed away in\r\nunknown seas; the good Englishman has long since gone to his rest; the\r\nqueen has won, God grant, an immortal crown, having lived to be old,\r\nnever forgetting all along her life her promise; and the little girl\r\nhas lived to be old, too! She has dreamed many dreams, but none more\r\nbeautiful than the one she probably dreamed that night,—all roses and\r\ncastles and gondolas, and a gracious young queen lovelier than all the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThus passed the first eight years of my life. Compared with those that\r\nfollowed, they were years of absolute serenity and happiness. They were\r\nnot gay. This was the time when people who \"feared God and desired to\r\nsave their souls\" felt bound to forsake the Established Church, many of\r\nwhose clergy had become objects of disgust rather than of reverence.\r\nDissenters and Quakers lived all around us; my uncle and aunt were\r\nPresbyterians, and I heard little but sober talk in my early years.\r\nSometimes we attended the silent meetings of the Quakers, and sometimes\r\nold St. Martin's, to which many of our Episcopal friends belonged.\r\nExtreme asceticism, however, was as far from the temper of my aunt\r\nand uncle as was the extreme of dissipation. They were strict in the\r\nobservance of the Sabbath and of all religious duties. Temperance in\r\nspeech and living, moderation, serenity,—these ruled the life at Cedar\r\nGrove.\r\n\r\nAnd so, although I cannot claim that\r\n\r\n     \"There was a star that danced,\r\n     And under it I was born,\"\r\n\r\nI look back with gratitude unspeakable to a beautiful childhood, and\r\nbless the memory of those who suffered no \"shapes of ill to hover near\r\nit,\" and mar its perfect innocence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that a refined and intelligent society was inclined\r\nto crystallize around the court green of Albemarle County, it became\r\nimperative to choose a fitting name for a promising young village.\r\n\r\nIn 1761 there was a charming princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz;\r\nintelligent, amiable, and only seventeen years of age. She had stepped\r\nforth from the conventional ranks of the young noblewomen of her day,\r\nand written a spirited letter to Frederick the Great, in which she\r\nentreated him to stop the ravages of war then desolating the German\r\nStates. She had painted in vivid colors the miseries resulting from the\r\nbrutality of the Prussian soldiery.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this letter reached the eyes of the Prince of Wales.\r\nHe fell in love with the letter before he ever knew the writer. In the\r\nsame year that he, as George III, ascended the throne of England, the\r\nlovely Charlotte, Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, became his wife.\r\nCharlottesville, then, was a name of happy omen for the pretty little\r\ntown, and in three more years a county was created, it would seem,\r\nexpressly that it might be called \"Mecklenburg,\" and yet again a slice\r\ntaken from another county to form the county of Charlotte.\r\n\r\nThe colony of Virginia was strewn thickly with the names of royal\r\nEngland: King and Queen, Charles City,—Charlestown,—King George, King\r\nWilliam, William and Mary, Prince Edward, Princess Anne, Caroline,\r\nPrince George, Henrico, Prince William. No less than four rivers were\r\nnamed in honor of the good Queen Anne: Rapidan, North Anna, South Anna,\r\nRivanna. We might almost call the roll of the House of Lords from a list\r\nof Virginia counties.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four years after the Princess Charlotte had become a queen, Mrs.\r\nAbigail Adams, as our minister's wife, was presented at the Court of St.\r\nJames. Alas for time,—and perhaps for prejudice,—she found, in place\r\nof the charming princess, an \"embarrassed woman, not well-shaped nor\r\nhandsome, although bravely attired in purple and silver.\" The interview\r\nwas cold and stilted, but all the \"embarrassment\" was on the part of\r\nroyalty.\r\n\r\nThere had been a recent unpleasantness between John Bull and Brother\r\nJonathan; King George, however, brave Briton as he was, broke the ice,\r\nand startled Mrs. Adams by giving her a hearty kiss! She could not\r\nventure, however, to remind the queen that we had named counties in\r\nher honor. She might, in her present state of mind, have deemed it an\r\nimpertinence on our part.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: RESIDENCE OF DR. S. P. HARGRAVE.]\r\n\r\nI am so impatient under descriptions of scenery, that I do not like\r\nto inflict them upon others. But I wish I could stand with my reader\r\nupon the elliptic plain formed by cutting down the apex of Monticello.\r\nHe would, I am sure, appreciate the fascination of mountain, valley,\r\nand river which drew the first settlers, and later the Randolphs,\r\nGilmers, William Wirt, and Thomas Jefferson, to the region around\r\nCharlottesville. On the east the almost level scene is bounded by the\r\nhorizon, and on the west the land seems to billow onward, wave after\r\nwave, until it rises in the noble crests of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\r\nA mist of green at our feet is pierced here and there by the simple\r\nbelfries of the village churches, and a little farther on, glimpses\r\nappear of the classic Pantheon and long colonnades of the University\r\nof Virginia. Imagination may fill in this picture, but reality will far\r\nexceed imagination, especially if the happy moment is caught at sunset\r\nwhen the mountains change color, from rose through delicate shadings\r\nto amethyst, and finally paint themselves deep blue against the evening\r\nsky. Then, should that sky chance to be veiled with light, fleecy clouds\r\nall flame and gold—but I forbear!\r\n\r\nThis was the spot chosen by my aunt as the very best for my education\r\nand my social life. The town was small in the forties, indeed, is not\r\nyet a city. It is described at that time as having four churches, two\r\nbook-stores, several dry-goods stores, and a female seminary. The family\r\nof Governor Gilmer lived on one of the little hills, Mr. Valentine\r\nSouthall on another, and we were fortunate enough to secure a third,\r\nwith a glorious view of the mountains and with grounds terraced to\r\nthe foot of the hill. Large gardens, grounds, and ornamental trees\r\nsurrounded all the houses. The best of these were of plain brick of\r\nuniform unpretentious architecture, comfortable, and ample. A small\r\nbrick building at the foot of our lawn was my uncle's office, and behind\r\nit, on my tenth birthday, he made me plant a tree.\r\n\r\nThe \"Female Seminary\" had been really the magnet that drew my dear aunt.\r\nIt was a famous school, presided over by an excellent and much-loved\r\nPresbyterian clergyman. There it was supposed I should learn everything\r\nmy aunt could not teach me.\r\n\r\nBehold me, then, on a crisp October morning wending my way to the\r\ngreat brick hive for girls. I was going with my aunt to be examined\r\nfor admission. Her thoughts were, doubtless, anxious enough about\r\nthe creditable showing I should make. Mine were anxious, too. I was\r\nconscious of a linen bretelle apron under my pelisse, and my mind was\r\nfar from clear about the propriety of so juvenile a garment. Suppose no\r\nother girl wore bretelle aprons!\r\n\r\nHowever, when we marched up the broad brick-paved walk and ascended the\r\nsteps of the great building, whose many windows seemed to stare at us\r\nlike lidless eyes, bretelle aprons sank into insignificance.\r\n\r\nThe room into which we were ushered seemed to be filled with hundreds\r\nof girls, and the Reverend Doctor's desk on a platform towered over\r\nthem. He was most affable and kind. The examination lasted only a few\r\nminutes, a list of books was given me, and a desk immediately in front\r\nof the principal assigned me. Books were borrowed from some other girl,\r\nthe lessons for the next day pointed out, and my school life began.\r\n\r\nRemember, I had not yet planted my tenth birthday tree. These were\r\nthe books deemed suitable for my age,—Abercrombie's \"Intellectual\r\nPhilosophy,\" Watts on the \"Improvement of the Mind,\" Goldsmith's\r\n\"History of Greece,\" and somebody's Natural Philosophy.\r\n\r\nI worked hard on these subjects with the result that, as I could\r\nnot understand them, I learned by rote a few words in answer to the\r\nquestions. A bright, amiable little scrap of a girl, who always knew\r\nher lessons, volunteered to assist me. If any collector of old books\r\nshould happen to find a volume of Watts on the Mind, much thumbed,\r\nand blotted here and there with tears, and should see within the early\r\npages pencilled brackets enclosing the briefest possible answer to the\r\nquestions, that book, those tears, were mine; and the brackets are the\r\nloving marks made by Margaret Wolfe, whose memory I ever cherish.\r\n\r\n\"What is Logic?\" questions the teacher's guide at the bottom of the\r\npages.\r\n\r\n\"Logic,\" answers Dr. Watts (in conspicuous pencilled brackets), \"is the\r\nart of investigating and communicating Truth.\"\r\n\r\nI had been struggling with Dr. Watts, Abercrombie, _et al._, for several\r\nmonths, when my aunt reluctantly realized that, however admirable the\r\nschool might be for others, I was not improving in mind or health. As\r\nsoon as she arrived at this conclusion, she decided to experiment with\r\nno more large female seminaries, but to educate me, as best she could,\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nAt the same time I know that my dear aunt suffered from the overthrow\r\nof all her plans for my education. She had, for my sake, made great\r\nsacrifices in leaving her inherited home. These sacrifices were all for\r\nnaught. She must have felt keen disappointment, and regret at the loss,\r\ntoil, expense,—and, above all, my worse than wasted time.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, my time at school may not have been utterly thrown\r\naway! The experience may have borne fruit that I know not of.\r\nMoreover, I _had_ learned something! I learned that Logic is the art of\r\ninvestigating and communicating Truth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nMasters were found in a preparatory school for my home education. Happy\r\nto escape from the schoolroom, I worked as never maiden worked before,\r\nloving my summer desk in the apple tree in the garden, loving my winter\r\ndesk beside the blazing wood in my uncle's office, passionately loving\r\nmy music, and interested in the other studies assigned me. With no\r\ncompetitive examinations to stimulate me, I yet made good progress.\r\nBefore I reached my thirteenth year, I had learned to read French\r\neasily. I had wept over the tender story of Picciola and the sorrows\r\nof Paul and Virginia. I had sailed with Ulysses and trod the flowery\r\nfields with Calypso. My aunt had beguiled me into a course of history\r\nby allowing me as reward those romances of Walter Scott which are\r\nfounded on historical events. My love of music and desire to excel in\r\nit made me patient under the eccentric itinerant music teacher, the one\r\npioneer apostle of classic music in all Virginia, who was known, more\r\nthan once, to arrive at midnight and call me up for my lesson; and who,\r\nwhile other maidens were playing the \"Battle of Prague\" and \"Bonaparte\r\ncrossing the Rhine,\" or singing the campaign songs of the hero of the\r\nlog cabin, taught me to love Beethoven and Liszt, and to discern the\r\nanswering voices in that genius, then young, whose magic music fell\r\nnot then, nor ever after, upon unheeding ears. I had read with my aunt\r\nselections all the way from \"The Faerie Queene\" through the times of\r\nlater queens,—Elizabeth and Anne,—and had made a beginning with the\r\nqueen for whom I had a sentiment, and who has given her name to so fair\r\nan age of fancy and of elegant writing. Alas, for the mental training\r\nI might have had through the study of mathematics! Were it not that\r\nthe lack of this training must be apparent to all who are kind enough\r\nto listen to my story, I might quote Joseph Jefferson, as Mr. William\r\nWinter reports him: \"Why, look at me! I seem to have managed pretty\r\nwell, but I couldn't for the life of me add up a column of figures.\" The\r\nonly figures I know anything about are figures of speech. Fortunately, I\r\nhave had little use for addition. My knowledge has been quite sufficient\r\nfor my needs.\r\n\r\nMy French teacher, Mr. Mertons,—a square-shouldered, spectacled German,\r\nwith an upright shock of coarse black hair, literally pounded the\r\nFrench language into me. With a grammar held aloft in his left hand, he\r\nemphasized every rule with his right fist, coming down hard on my aunt's\r\nmahogany. If success is to be measured by results, I can only say that,\r\nalthough I perceived some charm in Mme. de Sévigné and in Dumas, I was\r\nrather dense with Racine and Molière; and as to the spoken language!\r\nI can usually manage to convey, by gesture and deliberate English,\r\na twilight glimmer of my meaning in talking to a polite Frenchman,\r\nbut blank darkness descends upon him when I speak to him in \"a French\r\nnot spoken in France.\" The gift for \"divers kinds of tongues\" was not\r\nbestowed upon me.\r\n\r\nThe music teacher deserves more than a passing notice. He was unique.\r\nMr. William C. Rives found him somewhere in France, and promised\r\nhim a large salary if he would come to America, live near or in\r\nCharlottesville, and teach his daughter Amélie. He was the incarnation\r\nof thriftlessness; with no polish of manner, no idea of business,\r\nor order, or of the necessity of paying a debt, but he was also the\r\nincarnation of music! My uncle again and again satisfied the sheriff\r\nand released him from bonds. Finally, he could not appear in town at\r\nall by daylight, and often arrived at midnight for my lesson. Gladly my\r\naunt would rise and dress to preside over it. My teacher would disappear\r\nbefore the dawn. He owed money all over town which he had not the\r\nfaintest intention of ever paying. More than once his defenceless back\r\ncould have borne witness to a creditor's outraged feelings. But he was\r\nresourceful. Thereafter he carried all his music, a thick package, in a\r\ncase sewed to the lining of his coat. His back, rather than his breast,\r\nneeded a shield. It was amusing to see him pack himself up, as it were,\r\nbefore venturing into the open.\r\n\r\nBut with all this, we prized him above rubies. He was a brilliant\r\npianist, a great genius; had studied with Liszt, early appreciated\r\nChopin, adored Beethoven. One of his animated lessons would leave me in\r\na state \"which fiddle-strings is weakness to express my nerves,\" and\r\nyet no summons to duty ever thrilled me with pleasure like his \"Koom\r\non ze biahno.\" Once there, absolute fidelity to the composer's writing\r\nand the position of my hands exacted all my attention. The margins of\r\nmy music were liberally adorned with illustrations of my fist—a clumsy\r\nbunch with an outsticking thumb.\r\n\r\nI always felt keenly the charm of music, even when it was beyond my\r\ncomprehension. One day, happening to look up from his own playing,\r\nhe detected tears in my eyes. He was enraged in three languages.\r\n\"Himmel! Zis is not bathétique! Zis is _scherzo_! Eh, bien! I blay him\r\n_adagio_.\" And under shut teeth a sibilant whisper sounded very much\r\nlike \"_imbécile_,\" as he hung his head to one side, arched his brows,\r\nand drawled out the theme in a ridiculous manner. Once I was so carried\r\naway by a delicious passage I was playing that I diminished the _tempo_,\r\nthat the linked sweetness might be long drawn out. He literally danced!\r\nHe beat time furiously with both hands. \"Ach! is it _you_ yourselluf,\r\nknow bedder zan ze great maestro,\" and sweeping me from the piano stool\r\nhe rendered the passage properly.\r\n\r\nOne summer my aunt, in order that I might have lessons, took board in\r\na country place where he lived. I was pleasing myself one day with a\r\nlittle German song I had smuggled from town:—\r\n\r\n     \"The church bells are ringing, the village is gay,\r\n     And Leila is dressed in her bridal array.\r\n         She's wooed, and she's won\r\n         By a proud Baron's son,\r\n     And Leila, Leila, Leila's a Lady!\"\r\n\r\nProceeding gayly with the chorus, and exulting in Leila's ladyship and\r\ngood fortune, I was startled by thunderous claps through the house. Mr.\r\nMeerbach was fleeing to his own room, slamming the doors between himself\r\nand my uneducated voice!\r\n\r\nOf course he lost his scholars. At last only Amélie Rives, Jane Page,\r\nEliza Meriwether, and myself remained. We had to make up his salary\r\namong us. \"I hope you'll study, dear,\" said my kind uncle; \"I am\r\nnow giving eight dollars apiece for your lessons.\" Jane Page played\r\nmagnificently. This rare young genius, a niece of Mrs. William C. Rives,\r\ndied young. The rest of us played well, too. My teacher wished to take\r\nme to Richmond to play for Thalberg his own difficult, florid music,\r\nand was terribly chagrined at my aunt's refusal to permit me to go.\r\n\r\nThe little Episcopal church and rectory were just across the street,\r\nand the rector, Mr. Meade, allowed me free access to the gallery, where\r\nI delighted to practise on the small pipe organ. I was just tall enough\r\nto reach the foot notes. The church was peculiarly interesting from the\r\nfact that Thomas Jefferson, who is supposed to have been a free thinker,\r\nhad insisted upon building it and had furnished the plans for it.\r\nBefore it was built, services were held in the Court House, which Mr.\r\nJefferson regularly attended, bringing his seat with him on horseback\r\nfrom Monticello, \"it being,\" says Bishop Meade, \"of some light machinery\r\nwhich, folded up, was carried under his arm and, unfolded, served for\r\na seat on the floor of the Court House.\"\r\n\r\nI was thirteen years old when Mr. Meade sent for me one evening to come\r\nto him in his vestry room. He told me that the Episcopal Convention was\r\nto meet in his church in two days, and he had just discovered that Miss\r\nWilly (the organist) had arranged an entire new service of chants and\r\nhymns. He had requested her not to use it, urging that his father the\r\nbishop, the clergy, and all his own people knew and loved the old tunes,\r\nand could not join in the new. Miss Willy had indignantly resented his\r\ninterference and threatened to resign, with all her choir, unless he\r\nyielded. \"I shall certainly not yield,\" said the rector. \"I have told\r\nher that I know a little girl who will be glad to help me. Now I wish\r\nyou to play for the convention, beginning day after to-morrow (Sunday),\r\nand every evening during its session. This will give you evening\r\nservices all the week, beginning with three on Sunday. I will see that\r\nfamiliar hymns are selected, and you need chant none of the Psalms\r\nexcept the Benedictus and Gloria in Excelsis.\"\r\n\r\nI began, \"Oh, I'm afraid—\" \"No,\" said Mr. Meade, \"you're not afraid;\r\nyou are not going to be afraid. Just be in your place fifteen minutes\r\nbefore the time, and draw the curtain between you and the audience. I\r\nshall send you a good choir.\"\r\n\r\nI practised with a will next day. On the great day, when I passed the\r\nsable giant, Ossian, pulling away at the rope under the belfry, and\r\nheard the solemn bell announcing that my hour had come, my heart sank\r\nwithin me. But Ossian gave me a glittering smile which showed all his\r\nmagnificent ivories. He was grinning because he was going to pump the\r\norgan for such a slip of a lass as I!\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the organ gallery, I found my choir,—several ladies whom\r\nI knew, and a group of fine-looking students from the University. They\r\nlooked down kindly on the small organist, with her hair hanging in two\r\nbraids down her back. I resolutely kept that small back to the drawn\r\ncurtain! Only the tip of one of Miss Willy's nodding plumes, and I\r\nshould have been undone!\r\n\r\nAll went well. The singing was fine from half a dozen manly throats,\r\nsupplementing two or three female voices and my own little pipe. I was\r\nsoon lost to my surroundings in the enjoyment of my work. When, on the\r\nlast day, the good bishop asked for the grand old hymn, \"How firm a\r\nfoundation, ye saints of the Lord,\" it thrilled my soul to hear the\r\nchurch fill with the triumphant singing of the congregation, led by\r\nlittle me and my improvised choir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe society of Charlottesville in the forties was composed of a few\r\nfamilies of early residents and of the professors at the University.\r\nGovernor Gilmer, Secretary of the Navy in Tyler's time, Mr. Valentine\r\nSouthall of an old Virginia family, and himself eminent in his\r\nprofession of the law, Dr. Charles Carter, Professor Tucker, William B.\r\nRogers, Dr. McGuffey, Dr. Cabell, Professor Harrison,—all these names\r\nare well known and esteemed to this day. There were young people in\r\nthese families, and all them were my friends. Along the road I have\r\ntravelled for so many years I have met none superior to them and very\r\nfew their equals.\r\n\r\nMy special coterie was a choice one. It included, among others, Lizzie\r\nGilmer (the lovely) and her sisters; beautiful Lucy Southall; Maria\r\nHarrison and her sweet sister Mary, both accomplished in music and\r\nliterature; Eliza Rives and Mary McGuffey. James Southall, William C.\r\nRives, Jr., George Wythe Randolph, Jack Seddon, Kinsey Johns, Professor\r\nSchéle de Vere, John Randolph Tucker, St. George Tucker—these were\r\nhabitués of my home, and all apparently interested in me and in my\r\nmusic. To each name I might append a list of honors won, at the bar,\r\nin literature, and in the army. I have survived them all—and I kept the\r\nfriendship of each one as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nThe customs in entertaining differed from those in vogue at the\r\npresent day. Afternoon teas, which had been fashionable during the\r\nRevolution—tea then being a rare luxury—had not survived until the\r\nforties. Choice Madeira in small glasses, and fruit-cake were offered\r\nto afternoon callers. The cake must always be _au naturel_ if served\r\nin the daytime. Cake iced—in evening dress—was only permissible at the\r\nevening hour.\r\n\r\nDinner-parties demanded a large variety of dishes. They were not served\r\n_à la Russe_. Two table-cloths were _de rigueur_ for a dinner company.\r\nOne was removed with the dishes of meat, vegetables, celery, and many\r\npickles, all of which had been placed at once upon the table. The\r\ncut-glass and silver dessert dishes rested on the finest damask the\r\nhousewife could provide. This cloth removed, left the mahogany for the\r\nfinal walnuts and wine.\r\n\r\nThree o'clock was a late hour for a dinner-party—the ordinary family\r\ndinner was at two. The large silver tureen, which is now enjoying a\r\ndignified old age on our sideboards, had then place at the foot of the\r\ntable. After soup, boiled fish appeared at the head.\r\n\r\nAn interview has been preserved between a Washington hostess of the\r\ntime and Henry, an \"experienced and fashionable\" caterer. Upon being\r\nrequired to furnish the smallest list of dishes possible for a \"genteel\"\r\ndinner-party of twelve persons, he reluctantly reduced his menu to\r\nsoup, fish, eight dishes of meat, stewed celery, spinach, salsify,\r\nand cauliflower. \"Potatoes and beets would not be genteel.\" The meats\r\nwere turkey, ham, partridges, mutton chops, sweetbreads, oyster pie,\r\npheasants, and canvas-back ducks. \"Plum-pudding,\" suggested the hostess.\r\n\"La, no, ma'am! All kinds of puddings and pies are out of fashion.\"\r\n\"What, then, can I have at the head and foot of the table?\" asked the\r\nhostess. \"Forms of ice-cream at the head, and at the foot a handsome\r\npyramid of fruit. Side dishes, jellies, custards, blanc-mange, cakes,\r\nsweetmeats, and sugar-plums.\" \"No nuts, raisins, figs?\" \"Oh, _no, no_,\r\nma'am, they are _quite_ vulgar!\"\r\n\r\nFor the informal supper-parties, to which my aunt was wont to invite\r\nthe governor and Mrs. Gilmer, Mr. and Mrs. Southall, Professor and Mrs.\r\nTucker, the table was amply furnished with cold tongue, ham, broiled\r\nchickens or partridges, and pickled oysters, hot waffles, rolls and\r\nmuffins, very thin wheaten wafers, green sweetmeats, preserved peaches,\r\nbrandied peaches, cake, tea, and coffee; and in summer the fruits\r\nof the season. These suppers made a brave showing with the Sheffield\r\ncandelabra and bowls of roses. Ten years later these \"high teas\" were\r\nquite out of fashion, and would, by a modern \"fashionable caterer,\" be\r\ncondemned as \"vulgar.\" There was a crusade against all card-playing and\r\ndancing. The pendulum was swinging far back from an earlier time when\r\nthe punchbowl and cards ruled the evening, and the dancing master held\r\nlong sessions, travelling from house to house. To have a regular dancing\r\nparty, with violins and cotillon, was like \"driving a coach-and-six\r\nstraight through the Ten Commandments!\" My aunt, however, had the\r\ncourage of her convictions, and allowed me small and early dances in\r\nour parlor, with only piano music. Old Jesse Scott lived at the foot of\r\nthe hill—but to the length of introducing him and his violin we dared\r\nnot go. As it was, after our first offence, a sermon was preached in\r\nthe Presbyterian church against the vulgarity and sin of dancing. My\r\naunt listened respectfully but continued the dance she deemed good for\r\nmy health and spirits.\r\n\r\nThe noblest of men, and one of my uncle's dearest friends, was Thomas\r\nWalker Gilmer, Secretary of the Navy during Tyler's administration.\r\nHe was killed on the Potomac by the bursting of a gun on trial for the\r\nfirst time. My uncle and aunt went immediately to Washington to bring\r\nhim home. No man had ever been so loved and esteemed by all who knew\r\nhim. I have never seen such grief, as the sorrow of his wife. She had\r\nbeen a brilliant member of the Washington society, noted for ready wit\r\nand repartee. Never, as long as she lived, did she reënter social life.\r\nWith her orphaned children she lived on \"The Hill\" very near us. These\r\nchildren were a part of our family always.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, and we grew tall,—Lizzie and I,—students from the\r\nUniversity found us out, and had permission to visit us. Lizzie,\r\nthree years my senior, became engaged to St. George Tucker, one of our\r\nchoice circle. When more visitors called on Lizzie than she could well\r\nentertain in an evening, it was her custom to send Susan, a little\r\npet negress whom she had taught to read, running down the hill with,\r\n\"Please, Miss Hargrave, please, ma'am, Miss Lizzie say she certn'ly will\r\nbe glad if you let Miss Sara come up an' help 'er with her comp'ny.\" My\r\naunt could never deny her anything. I was too young, much too young,\r\nbut we took our lives very naturally and unconsciously, accepting a\r\nguest and doing our best for him, whether he was old or young. We were\r\nnever announced as débutantes. No Rubicon flowed across our path,—on\r\none side pinafores and long braids, on the other purple-and-fine-linen\r\nand elaborate coiffure,—the which if stepped across at an entertainment\r\nushered us into society.\r\n\r\nLizzie and I felt that we were young hostesses, and took pains to be,\r\naccording to our lights, ceremonious and conventional in our behavior.\r\nSome one or two of our guests was sure to be George Gordon, or James\r\nSouthall, or \"Jim\" White, or \"Sainty\" Tucker, who were as brothers to\r\nus; and very watchful and strict were these boy chaperons! The great\r\nanxiety was lest our visitors should stay too late. So my aunt and Mrs.\r\nGilmer carefully timed the burning of a candle until ten o'clock, and\r\nall candles thereafter were cut that length. When they began to flicker\r\nin the sockets, good nights were expected.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gilmer's large house was divided in the middle by a hall extending\r\nto a door in the rear. On one side were the bedrooms of the family,\r\non the other the parlors and dining-room. She spent her evenings in a\r\ndarkened room, just across the hall from the parlor, and although she\r\nhad not the heart to mingle with us, we knew she was near.\r\n\r\nOne night we had a number of guests, among them a stranger, Mr. Tebbs,\r\nbrought by one of our own band who had introduced him and then left, Mr.\r\nTebbs remarking that he too must soon leave, as a friend was down town\r\nwaiting for him. The candles burned low, and we allowed long pauses in\r\nconversation, vainly hoping the stranger would depart. Presently the\r\nknocker sounded an alarum, and little Susan hurried from her mistress's\r\nroom to answer it. We distinctly heard her announce, \"Dish yer's a\r\nletter, Miss Ann,\" and Mrs. Gilmer's languid reply, \"Light a candle and\r\nread it to me.\" We essayed to drown Susan's voice, for I was quite sure\r\nit was a peremptory order for me to come home, but it rang out clearly\r\nand deliberately, \"Tebbs, you damn rascal! Are you going to stay at Mrs.\r\nGilmer's all night!\" To make matters worse, Susan immediately appeared\r\nwith the note for the blushing Mr. Tebbs, who then and there bade us a\r\nlong farewell. We never saw him more! A delicious little story was told\r\nwith keen relish by Juliet, the fifteen-year-old daughter. She had, as\r\nshe thought, \"grown up,\" while her mother lived in seclusion, and had\r\na boy-lover of her own. Sitting, after hours, one moonlight night on\r\nthe veranda under her mother's window, the anxious youth was moved to\r\nseize the propitious moment and declare himself. Juliet wished to answer\r\ncorrectly, and dismiss him without wounding him. She assured him \"Mamma\r\nwould never consent.\" A voice from within decided the matter: \"Accept\r\nthe young man, Juliet, if you want to—I've not the least objection—and\r\nlet him run along home now. Be sure to bolt the door when you come in!\"\r\nEvidently Mrs. Gilmer had small respect for boy-lovers; and wished to\r\ngo to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe Gilmer home was full of treasures of books and pictures. We turned\r\nover the great pages of Hogarth and the illustrations of Shakespeare,\r\nvery much to the damage of these valuable books. Choice old Madeira\r\nwas kept in the cellar, to which we had free access, mixing it with\r\nwhipped cream or mingling it with ice, sugar and nutmeg whenever we so\r\nlisted. A great gilded frame rested against the wall, from which some\r\nlarge painting had been removed. Over this we stretched a netting and\r\ninaugurated _tableaux vivantes_, of which we never wearied. I was always\r\nRowena, to whom Lizzie, as Rebecca the Jewess, gave her jewels. One of\r\nthe Gilmer boys made an admirable Dr. Primrose, another Moses, whom we\r\ndressed for the fair, and the other children were flower girls, nuns,\r\nor pilgrims with staff and shell.\r\n\r\nWhen one questions the possibility of this large family living\r\nfor several years without a head and moving about decorously and\r\nsystematically, we must not forget the family butler, Mandelbert, and\r\nhis wife, Mammy Grace. Both were long past middle age. They simply\r\nassumed the care of their broken-hearted mistress and her children,\r\nruling the house with patient wisdom and kindness. Mammy Grace, so well\r\nknown fifty years ago in Virginia, was peculiar in her speech, retaining\r\nthe imagery of her race and nothing of its dialect. She was straight\r\nand tall and always carefully dressed. She wore a dark, close-fitting\r\ngown, which she called a \"habit,\" a handkerchief of plaid madras\r\ncrossed upon her bosom, an ample checked apron, and a cap with a full\r\nmob crown like Martha Washington's. When she dropped her respectful\r\n\"curtsey,\" her salutation, \"Your servant, master,\" was less suggestive\r\nof deference than of dignified self-respect. Her one fault was that,\r\nlike her mistress, she never knew when the children were grown. This\r\nwas sometimes embarrassing. As surely as 8 o'clock Saturday night came,\r\none after the other would be called from the parlor, and would obey\r\ninstantly, for fear she would add more than a hint of the thorough,\r\npersonally superintended bath which awaited each one.\r\n\r\nMandelbert was superb, tall, gray, and very stately. He had been born\r\nand trained in the family, a model, _distingué_-looking servant. Mammy\r\nGrace lived to an honored old age, but a liberal use of fine old Madeira\r\nproved the reverse of the modern lacteal remedy for old age. In a few\r\nyears there was no more wine in the cellar—and no more Mandelbert.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother of the Gilmer children was Mrs. Ann Baker, a lovely\r\nold lady who wore a Letitia Ramolino turban, with little curls sewn\r\nwithin its brim. She had been a passenger on James Rumsey's boat in\r\n1786 at Shepherdstown, when he was the first to succeed by steam alone\r\nin propelling a vessel against the current of the Potomac, and \"at the\r\nrate of four or five miles an hour!\" She was a lovely, cultivated old\r\nlady, the widow of a distinguished man. I cannot be quite sure,—all\r\nwitnesses are gone,—but I have a distinct impression I was told that\r\nGeneral Washington was a passenger with Mrs. Baker on James Rumsey's\r\nboat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year after my fifteenth birthday was destined to be an eventful\r\none to me. In May of that year I wrote a letter to my aunt, Mrs.\r\nIzard Bacon Rice, who lived at \"The Oaks\" in Charlotte County. This\r\nletter, the earliest extant of my girlhood, has recently been placed\r\nin my hands, and I venture to hope I may be pardoned for inserting\r\nthe naïve production here; not for any intrinsic merit, but because\r\nof the light it reflects upon my development and associations at the\r\nage of fifteen,—a light not to be acquired by mere recollection, as\r\na photograph of the person must be more lifelike than a sketch from\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n                                     \"CHARLOTTESVILLE, May 25, 1845.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR AUNT: I think that I have fully tested the truth of\r\n     the old saying, viz. 'Hope deferred maketh the heart sick,'\r\n     for I have hoped and hoped in vain for an answer to my last\r\n     letter, and since it does not make its appearance, I write to\r\n     request an explanation.\r\n\r\n     \"I received a letter from Willie (Carrington) this morning,\r\n     and was rejoiced to hear that you still intend coming to\r\n     Charlottesville 'some of these times,' and that she thinks of\r\n     coming also. I am overjoyed at the idea of seeing my _dear_\r\n     little Henry, and Tom in a few weeks. Willie says that Henry\r\n     is _beautiful_, and that Tom has become quite a famous beau,\r\n     improved wonderfully in gallantry, etc. I anticipate a great\r\n     many long, pleasant walks with him, though I am afraid he will\r\n     not like Charlottesville, as he will find no rabbits' tracks\r\n     or partridges here. I hope you will come the first of June\r\n     and stay a long while with us.\r\n\r\n     \"Aunt Mary has been very unwell for a long time, but I am in\r\n     hopes that she is getting a little better. I think your visit\r\n     will improve her wonderfully. We are all as busy as we can\r\n     be: aunt and uncle in the garden and yard, and I studying\r\n     my French lessons, sewing, reading, and housekeeping for\r\n     Aunt Mary when she is sick. I am very disconsolate at the\r\n     thought of losing my most intimate friend (Lizzie Gilmer)\r\n     for a few months. She is going to Staunton, and I expect to\r\n     miss her very much. We have a very quiet time now—as most of\r\n     my acquaintances were _sent off_ at the late disturbances at\r\n     the University, and I can study, undisturbed by company. I\r\n     scarcely visit any one except Lizzy, and receive more visits\r\n     from her than any one else, as she comes _every_ day, and\r\n     frequently two or three times a day. I am going to spend my\r\n     last evening with her this evening, as she leaves to-morrow.\r\n     I am very sorry that Willie will not see her, as I know they\r\n     would like each other.\r\n\r\n     \"Who do you think I have had a visit from? No less a personage\r\n     than Dr. Schéle de Vere, professor of modern languages at the\r\n     University. He has called on me _twice_, but I, unfortunately,\r\n     was not at home once when he called. He is a German (one of\r\n     the nobility), and speaks our language shockingly, and is such\r\n     an incessant _chatterer_ that he gives _me_ no possible chance\r\n     of wedging in a syllable. He walked with me from church last\r\n     Sunday, and jabbered incessantly, much to the amusement of\r\n     the congregation in general, but particularly of two little\r\n     boys who walked behind us. When he parted with us, he asked\r\n     uncle's permission to visit us, which was granted; and he\r\n     seemed _very_ grateful, and said he 'would have de pleasure\r\n     den of sharing de doctor's hospitality and hearing some of\r\n     Miss Rice's fine music.' But what mortifies me beyond measure\r\n     is that he treats me as a _little child_, and inquires _most\r\n     affectionately_ about my progress in music, etc. He is not\r\n     so much older than I am, either, as he is only twenty-one, so\r\n     _I_ think he might be more respectful in his demeanor. What do\r\n     you think of it all? He plays very well on the piano, and has\r\n     heard the best performers in Europe, so I feel very reluctant\r\n     to play for him. The first time he heard me play, he wanted to\r\n     applaud me as they do at concerts, but he was checked by one\r\n     of the company, who intimated to him that it was not customary\r\n     in this country, so he contented himself with clapping his\r\n     hands several times.\r\n\r\n     \"I have neither time nor paper for much more, so good-by.\r\n     Aunt Mary joins me in love and a kiss to all grandfather's\r\n     household and to Tom, Henry, and Uncle Izard.\r\n\r\n                                          \"Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                      \"SARA A. RICE.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. I send my best respects to Lethe, Viny, and Aunt Chany,\r\n     and my love to all the ducks, geese, chickens, turkeys, and\r\n     Tom's dogs.\r\n\r\n                                          \"Yours affectionately,\r\n                                                     \"SARA A. RICE.\"\r\n\r\nThis sixty-four-year-old letter was beautifully written with a quill\r\npen, clear and distinct without an erasure, blotted with sand from\r\na perforated box, without envelope, and sealed with wax. Written in\r\nfigures upon the envelope was \"Uncle Sam's\" receipt for prepaid postage,\r\n12½ cents, no stamps having then been issued by him.\r\n\r\nFanciful seals and motto wafers were in high favor among romantic young\r\npeople. \"L'amitié c'est l'amour sans ailes\" was a prime favorite; also a\r\nmaiden in a shallop looking upward to a star, the legend \"Si je te perds\r\nje suis perdu.\" The most delicate refusal to a lover on record was the\r\nlady's card, \"With thanks,\" sealed with a bird in flight and \"Liberty\r\nis sweet!\"\r\n\r\nThe \"disturbances of late,\" for which my friends were \"suspended for\r\na month,\" were not of a serious nature. They were only the midnight\r\npranks of mischievous boys, such as hyphenating the livery-stable's name\r\n\"Le Tellier\" to read \"Letel-Liar,\" drawing his \"hacks\" to the doors\r\nof the citizens, placing the undertaker's sign over the physician's\r\noffice, driving Mr. Schéle's ponies, and leaving on their flanks the\r\npainted words \"So far for to-day,\" the phrase with which he invariably\r\nended his lectures. It remained later for the student in whom I was\r\nmost interested to excel them all. He drove a flock of sheep one dark\r\nnight up the rotunda stairs to the platform on the roof, and then shut\r\ndown the trap-door. A plaintive good-morning-bleating welcomed faculty\r\nand students next day. Needless to say, the valiant shepherd was\r\n\"suspended.\"\r\n\r\nLate in the summer of this year another large convention of clergymen,\r\nPresbyterian this time, was held at Charlottesville. No good hotel\r\ncould be found anywhere in Virginia. The landlord was ruined by the\r\nhospitality of the citizens. As soon as a pleasant stranger \"put up\"\r\nat a public house, he was claimed as a guest by the first man who could\r\nreach him.\r\n\r\nWhen large religious or political or literary meetings convened in\r\nour town, my uncle would send to the chairman asking for the number of\r\nguests we could entertain. Until they arrived, we were as much on the\r\n_qui vive_ as if we had bought numbers in a lottery.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, Lizzie and I were in great grief. She had been away\r\nfrom town for two months, and was now to make me a long visit. We\r\nhad made plans for a lovely week. Now the house would be filled with\r\nclergymen,—no music, no visitors (and Lizzie was engaged), no \"fun\"! My\r\naunt sympathized with us, and fitted up a small room at the far end of\r\nthe hall, moved in the piano and guitar, and bade us make ourselves at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nWe were seated at church behind a row of the grave and reverend seniors,\r\nwhen Dr. White leaned over our pew and said to one of them, \"I'm glad\r\nto tell you I can send you to Dr. Hargrave's. He will take fine care of\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" demurred the reverend gentleman, \"I have my son with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take him along! There's plenty of room,\" replied the doctor.\r\n\r\nLizzie gave me a despairing glance. Now we _are_ ruined, we thought. A\r\ndreadful small boy to be amused and kept out of mischief.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon we were condoling with each other in our little city of\r\nrefuge, when the opening front door revealed among our guests a slender\r\nyouth, who, upon being directed to his room, sprang up the stairs two\r\nor three steps at a time.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!\" said I. \"Worse and worse! There's no hope for us! A strange\r\nyoung man to be entertained in our little parlor!\"\r\n\r\nMy aunt entering just then, we confided our miseries to her. \"Never\r\nmind, Lizzie,\" she said, \"Sara shall keep him in the large room. She\r\nmust bring down all her prettiest books and pictures and arrange a table\r\nin a corner for his amusement. He will not be here much of the time. He\r\nhas to go to church with his father, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of this unwelcome intruder was Roger A. Pryor. He made\r\nhimself charming. I had not yet tucked up my long braids, but he\r\ntreated me beautifully. He was so alert, so witty, so amiable, that\r\nhe was unanimously voted the freedom of our sanctum. He entered with\r\nglee into our schemes for self-defence. Running out to a shrub on the\r\nlawn, he returned with a handful of \"wax berries,\" gravely explained,\r\n\"ammunition,\" and proceeded to test the range of the missile. Just then\r\none of the enemy, the great Dr. Plumer, entered the hall, and the soft\r\nberry neatly reached his dignified nose. His Reverence gave no sign of\r\nintelligence. He had been a boy himself!\r\n\r\nSt. George Tucker took an immense fancy to our new ally. He found a\r\ngreat deal to say to me. How glad was I that my aunt had given me a new\r\nrose-colored silk bonnet from Mme. Viglini's.\r\n\r\nThe week passed like a dream. When the stage drew up at midnight to\r\ntake our guest to the railroad, seven miles distant, we were both very\r\n_triste_ at parting.\r\n\r\nHe was sixteen years old, was to graduate next summer at Hampden Sidney\r\nCollege, and come the session afterward to our University. I hoped all\r\nwould go well with him; and after the winding horn of the stage was\r\nquite out of hearing, I,—well, I had been taught early to entreat the\r\nFather of all to take care of my friends. There could be no great harm\r\nin including him by name, nor yet in adding to my petition the words\r\n\"_for me!_\"\r\n\r\nI suppose I may have seemed a bit _distrait_ after this incident, for\r\nmy uncle, who was always devising occupation for me, insisted upon my\r\nwriting a story. I liked to please him, and I surprised him by producing\r\na love story. I think I called it \"The Birthnight Ball.\" I remember this\r\nquotation, which I considered quite delicate and suggestive:—\r\n\r\n\"The stars, with vain ambition, emulate her eyes.\" That is all I\r\nremember of my story. My uncle sent it to the _Saturday Evening Post_\r\nin Philadelphia and it was accepted, the editor proposing, as I was a\r\nyoung writer, to waive the _honorarium_! I was only too glad to accept\r\nthe honor.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn my uncle took us on a long journey to Niagara Falls\r\nand the Northern Lakes. In New York we stopped at the Astor House on\r\nBroadway, and my room looked into the park then opposite, where scarlet\r\nflamingoes gathered around a fountain. We walked in the beautiful\r\nBowling Green Park, then the fashionable promenade, took tea with\r\nthe Miss Bleeckers on Bleecker Street, and bought a lovely set of\r\nturquoises, a jewelled comb, and a white topaz brooch from Tiffany's.\r\nMoreover, my seat at table was near that of John Quincy Adams, now an\r\naged man, paralytic, and almost incapable of conveying his food to his\r\nlips. He was charmingly cheerful, and courteous to a sweet-faced lady\r\nwho attended him.\r\n\r\nI think we took the canal-boat in Schenectady which was to convey us\r\nacross the state of New York.\r\n\r\nMy uncle had been beguiled in New York by a flaming pictorial\r\nadvertisement of palatial packet-boats, drawn by spirited horses\r\ngalloping at full speed. When we entered our little craft, we found\r\nit so crowded that we were wretchedly uncomfortable. Possibly, in our\r\nignorance, we had not taken the fine packet of the advertisement. Our\r\nown boat crawled along at a snail's pace, making three or four miles\r\nan hour. Many of the passengers left it every morning, preferring to\r\nwalk ahead and wait for us until night. We made the journey in five or\r\nsix days. The heat, the discomfort, the mosquitoes! Who can imagine the\r\nmisery of that journey? Fresh from the mountains and gorgeous sunsets\r\nof Albemarle, we found little to admire in the scenery.\r\n\r\nAs to the Falls, which we had come so far to see—they and their\r\n_entourage_ made me ill. It was all so weird and strange; the dark\r\nforests of evergreen, pine, and spruce; the sullen Indians, squatted\r\naround blankets, embroidering with beads and porcupine quills; the\r\nhapless little Indian babies strapped to boards and swinging in the\r\ntrees, and over all, the heavy roar of the waters. The immensity of\r\ntheir power filled me with terror. I longed to get away from the awful\r\nspectacle.\r\n\r\nThe best part of a journey is the home-coming. The dear familiar\r\nhouse,—we never knew how good it was,—the welcome of affectionate,\r\ncheerful servants; the dogs beside themselves with joy, the perfect\r\npeace, leisure, relaxation! Flowers, fruit, and much accumulated\r\nmail awaited us. My keen eye detected a large-enveloped paper from\r\nPhiladelphia, and my nimble fingers quickly abstracted it, unperceived,\r\nfrom the miscellaneous heap, and consigned it to a bureau drawer in my\r\nroom, the key of which went into my pocket.\r\n\r\nIn the privacy of my bedtime hour—having bolted the door—I drew it\r\nforth. Oh, what inane foolishness! What sad trash! Tearing it into\r\nstrips, I lighted each one at my candle and saw the whole burned—burned\r\nto impalpable smoke and degraded dust and ashes; consigned then and\r\nthere to utter oblivion!\r\n\r\nMy uncle often wondered why the story had not appeared. There was a\r\nperilous moment when he threatened to write to the publishers, but I\r\npersuaded him to be patient and dignified about it, and the matter,\r\nafter a while, was forgotten. Never was an uncle so managed by a young\r\ngirl!\r\n\r\nI think my great card with him was my interest in his office work.\r\nPhysicians compounded and prepared their own prescriptions sixty-five\r\nyears ago. He delighted in me when I donned my ample apron and, armed\r\nwith scales and spatula, gravely assumed the airs of a physician's\r\nassistant. I knew all his professional manœuvres to satisfy\r\nhypochondriac old gentlemen and nervous old ladies. I learned to make\r\nthe innocuous pills which \"helped\" them \"so much,\" and the carminative\r\nfor the aching little stomachs of the babies. Great have been the\r\nstrides since then in the noblest of all professions!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MRS. FANNY BLAND RANDOLPH.]\r\n\r\nJust here I venture to illustrate some of the radical changes in the\r\npractice of medicine by extracts from a letter written by Dr. Theodorick\r\nBland to his sister, Fanny Bland Randolph. The letter is copied from\r\nthe original in the possession of the late Joseph Bryan of Richmond,\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nThe treatment in 1840 differed in no material particular from that of\r\n1771, when Dr. Bland prescribed—regretting the necessity of \"absent\r\ntreatment\"—to his sister's husband, John Randolph, as follows:—\r\n\r\n     \"I take Mr. Randolph's case to be a bilious intermittent,\r\n     something of the inflammatory kind, which, had he been bled\r\n     pretty plentifully in the beginning, would have intermitted\r\n     perfectly; but unless his pulse is hard and, as it were,\r\n     laboring and strong, I would not advise that he should now be\r\n     bled; but if they are strong and his head-ache violent, and\r\n     the weight of the stomach great, let him lose about six ounces\r\n     of blood from the arm, and if he is much relieved from that,\r\n     and his pulse rises and is full and strong after it, a little\r\n     more may be taken. Let his body be kept open by Glysters, made\r\n     with chicken water, molasses, decoction of marsh-mallows and\r\n     manna, given once, twice or three times,—nay, even four times\r\n     a day if occasion requires, and let him have manna and cream\r\n     of tartar dissolved in Barley Water,—one ounce of manna and a\r\n     half ounce of Cream of Tartar to every pint. Of this let him\r\n     drink plentifully, but prior to this, after bleeding (should\r\n     bleeding be necessary) let him take a vomit of Ipecac, four\r\n     grains every half hour until he has four or five plentiful\r\n     vomits, drinking plentifully of Camomile Tea (to three or four\r\n     pints at intervals) to work it off. Should the pain in the\r\n     head be violent and the eyes red and heavy, let his temples\r\n     be cupped or leeches applied to his temples, which operation\r\n     may be repeated every day, if he find relief from it, for\r\n     two or three days. If the manna, Cream of Tartar and Glysters\r\n     be not effectual, let him take fifteen grains of rhubarb and\r\n     as many of Vitriolated Tartar, repeating the dose, twice or\r\n     three times at six or eight hours intervals. Should he have\r\n     any catching of the nerves, let one of the powders be given\r\n     every four hours in a spoonful of jalop or pennyroyal water.\r\n     Should he be delirious, sleepy, or dozing in a half kind of\r\n     a sleep, his pulse small and quick, put blisters to his back,\r\n     arms and legs, and leeches and cupping to his temples. If his\r\n     skin should be hot, dry and parched after he has taken his\r\n     vomit or before, let him be put in a tub of warm water with\r\n     vinegar in it, up to his arm-pits and continue in it as long\r\n     as he can bear it, first wetting his head therein. He may,\r\n     now and then, drink a little claret-whey and have his tongue\r\n     sponged with sage-tea, honey and vinegar. Dear Fanny, with\r\n     sincere wishes for his safe and speedy recovery, and love to\r\n     him and your dear little ones,\r\n\r\n                                     \"Your affectionate brother,\r\n                                                         \"T. BLAND.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine that one of the \"dear little ones\" was John\r\nRandolph of Roanoke—that incarnation of genius and outrageous temper.\r\nHis father survived Dr. Bland's treatment only a few years. Still,\r\nfidelity to historic truth impels me to state that we have no evidence\r\nthat the doctor was in league with Henry St. George Tucker, who almost\r\nimmediately married the widow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the best types of purely American society could have been found\r\nin the forties in the towns of the country. Now everybody, high and low,\r\nrich and poor, seeks a home in the cities. It is not without reason that\r\nall classes should flock to the metropolis. There wealth can be enjoyed,\r\npoverty aided, talent appreciated; but there individual influence is\r\nalmost lost. The temptation to self-assertion, repugnant as it is to\r\nrefined feeling, is almost irresistible. Men and women must assert\r\nthemselves or sink into oblivion. Nobody has time to climb the rickety\r\nstairs to find the genius in the attic. Nobody looks for the statesman\r\namong the serene adherents to the \"Simple Life.\" Had Cincinnatus lived\r\nat this day, he would have ploughed to the end of his furrow. Nobody\r\nwould have interrupted him.\r\n\r\nThe absence of all the hurry and fever of life made the little town\r\nof Charlottesville an ideal home before the cataclysm of 1861. The\r\nprofessors at the University could live, in the moderate age, upon\r\ntheir modest salaries, and have something to spare for entertaining.\r\nThe village contingent was refined, amiable, and intelligent. Staunton\r\nsent us, every winter, her young ladies, the daughters of Judge Lucas\r\nThompson, all of whom were finally absorbed by the descendants of\r\nCharles Carroll, of Carrollton, Maryland. From the neighborhood on the\r\nBuck-mountain Road came the family of William C. Rives, twice our envoy\r\nto the Court of Versailles, and many times sent to the Senate of the\r\nUnited States. The \"gallant Gordons, many a one,\" the Randolphs and\r\nPages, and Mr. Stevenson, late Minister to England,—all these lived\r\nnear enough to be neighbors and visitors. Across Moore's Creek, at the\r\nfoot of Monticello, was the house of Mr. Alexander Rives. There lived\r\nmy sweet friend and bridesmaid, Eliza Rives, and there I could call for\r\na glass of lemonade when on my way to Monticello, guiding, as I often\r\ndid, some stranger-guest to visit the home of Thomas Jefferson. We would\r\npass through the straggling bushes of Scottish broom which bordered the\r\nroad—planted originally by Mr. Jefferson himself—pause at the modest\r\nmonument over his ashes, and reverently ponder the inscription thereon.\r\nIn his own handwriting, among his papers, had been found the record he\r\ndesired—not that he had been Minister to France and Secretary of State,\r\nnot that he had been twice President of the United States, but simply,—\r\n\r\n     \"Here lies buried Thomas Jefferson, Author of the Declaration\r\n     of American Independence, of the Statute of Virginia for\r\n     Religious Freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia.\"\r\n\r\nA few steps through the woods would bring us to the plateau commanding\r\nthe noble view I have tried to describe. I loved the spot, the glorious\r\nmountains, the glimpse at our feet of the Greek temple in its sacred\r\ngrove, the atmosphere of mystery and romance. Once I saw a solitary\r\n_fleur-de-lis_ unfurling its imperial banner on the site of the\r\nabandoned garden. Once I was permitted, in the absence of the owner,\r\nto explore an upper floor in the villa, and was startled by a white,\r\nstrained face gleaming out from a dim alcove. This was the bust of\r\nVoltaire. A happy, happy young girl was I on these rides, mounted on my\r\nown horse, Phil Duval, and not unconscious of my becoming green cloth\r\nhabit, green velvet turban, and long green feather, fastened with a\r\ndiamond buckle—as I believed it to be!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.]\r\n\r\nYoung girls reared in a university town and admitted to the friendship\r\nof the professors' families must be dull indeed if they absorb nothing\r\nfrom the literary atmosphere. My dear aunt was an accomplished English\r\nscholar. Her father had been the friend and neighbor of Patrick\r\nHenry, her husband had been one of John Randolph's physicians. My\r\nclose friends, the Gilmers, Southalls, and the daughters of Professor\r\nHarrison, all had brothers who were students, and we strove to keep pace\r\nwith these fine young fellows and meet them on English ground at least.\r\n\r\nWe had no circulating library in Charlottesville, and depended upon\r\nthe mails for our current literature. We saw _Graham's Magazine_ from\r\nPhiladelphia, the _Home Journal_ from New York, the _Southern Literary\r\nMessenger_ from Richmond. Dickens's novels reached us from London,\r\nissued then in monthly sections, and we impatiently awaited them. \"Oh,\r\nSara, have you been introduced to Mr. Toots?\" wrote Maria Gordon; \"he\r\nis so much in love with Florence Dombey, he 'feels as if somebody was\r\na-settin' on him!'\"\r\n\r\nWe liked Dickens better than Walter Scott. We found the remarks of\r\nCaptain Clutterbuck and the Rev. Dryasdust hard to bear, barring the\r\ndoor to the enchanted palace until they had their say. To be sure,\r\nDickens could be tiresome too, pausing in the middle of an exciting\r\nstory while somebody—the \"stroller\" or the \"bagman\"—related something\r\nwholly irrelevant. To my mind, a story within a story was a nuisance.\r\nIt was like a patch on a garment. The garment might be homespun and the\r\npatch satin, but it was a blemish, nevertheless, something put on to\r\nhelp a weak place. I skipped these stories then and skip them now!\r\n\r\nAs to Thackeray, I blush to say we did not appreciate him when he\r\nappeared as \"Michael Angelo Titmarsh.\" But we all knew Becky! She was\r\nonly a sublimated little Miss Betsy Stevens, a ragged mountain woman\r\nwho sold peaches on a small commission, and who, like Becky, having \"no\r\nmamma\" or other asset, lived by her wits.\r\n\r\nPerhaps in our estimation of Thackeray we were guided somewhat by his\r\nown countrymen. An English paper fell in our hands which was not at all\r\nrespectful to \"Chawls-Yellowplush-Angelo-Titmarsh-Jeames-William-\r\nMakepeace-Thackeray, Esquire of London Town in old England.\" Such\r\nridicule would soon settle him! No man could survive it.\r\n\r\nNone of the visiting authors deigned to call on us,—Thackeray, Dickens,\r\nMiss Martineau,—all passed us by. True, Frederika Bremer condescended\r\nto spend a night with her compatriot, Mr. Schéle de Vere, _en route_ to\r\nthe South, where she was to find little to admire except bananas. Mr.\r\nSchéle invited a choice company to spend the one evening Miss Bremer\r\ngranted him. Her novels were extremely popular with us. Every one was\r\non tiptoe of pleased anticipation. While the waiting company eagerly\r\nexpected her, the door opened—not for Miss Bremer, but her companion,\r\nwho announced:—\r\n\r\n\"Miss Bremer, she beg excuse. She _ver_ tired and must sleep! If she\r\ncome, she gape in your noses!\"\r\n\r\nAlas for tourist's help in the translating books! \"Face\" and \"nose,\"\r\n\"gape\" and \"yawn,\" although not synonymic, bear at least a cousinly\r\nrelation to each other.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Christian custom of lighting a Christmas tree—bringing\r\n\"the glory of Lebanon, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box,\" to\r\nhallow our festival—had not yet obtained in Virginia. We had heard much\r\nof the German Christmas tree, but had never seen one. Lizzie Gilmer, who\r\nwas to marry a younger son of the house, was intimate with the Tuckers,\r\nand brought great reports of the preparation of the first Christmas tree\r\never seen in Virginia.\r\n\r\nI had not yet been allowed to attend the parties of \"grown-up\" people,\r\nbut our young friend John Randolph Tucker was coming of age on Christmas\r\nEve, and great pressure was brought to bear upon my aunt to permit\r\nme to attend the birthday celebration. This was a memorable occasion.\r\n\"Rare Ran Tucker\" was a prime favorite with the older set, handsome,\r\ndistingué, and already marked for the high place he attained later on\r\nthe honor roll of his country.\r\n\r\nMy aunt could not persist in her rules for me, and I was permitted,\r\nprovided I went as \"a little girl in a high-necked dress,\" to accompany\r\nLizzie. My much-discussed gown was of blue silk, opening over white, and\r\nlaced from throat to hem with narrow black velvet! Never, never was girl\r\nas happy! The tree loaded with tiny baskets of bonbons, each enriched\r\nwith an original rhyming jest or sentiment, was magnificent, the supper\r\ndelicious, the speeches and poems from the two old judges (Tucker) were\r\napt and witty. I went as a little girl—a close bud—but no \"high-necked\"\r\ngown ever prisoned a happier heart.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, as I look back, that my University friends, Mr. Schéle\r\nde Vere, James Southall, William C. Rives, Jr., George Wythe Randolph,\r\nRoger Pryor, _et al._, felt all at once a very kind interest in my\r\neducation. They sent me no end of books. The last presented me with\r\na gorgeous Shakespeare, also Macaulay's \"Essays,\" Hazlitt's \"Age of\r\nElizabeth\" and Leigh Hunt's \"Fancy and Imagination,\" and came himself\r\nto read them to me, along with Shelley, Keats, Byron, and Coleridge.\r\nMr. Schéle sent me much music and French literature, he also coming to\r\nread the latter with me. William C. Rives loved my music, to which he\r\ncould listen by the hour. I kept the friendship of these brilliant men\r\nas long as they lived. Only two lived to be old.\r\n\r\nThe Tuckers were a family of literary distinction—One of the happiest\r\nand wittiest of them was my dear Lizzie's husband, St. George Tucker.\r\nAnything, everything, would provoke a pun, a parody, or a graceful\r\nrhyme.\r\n\r\nWhen it was proposed to change the name of \"Competition\"—a court-house\r\nvillage in the county of Pittsylvania—to \"Chatham,\" he produced a pencil\r\nand paper, and in a moment gave:—\r\n\r\n     \"Illustrious Pitt, how glorious is thy fame,\r\n     When Competition dies in Chatham's name.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a friend of G. P. R. James, whom he once surprised eating a very\r\n\"ripe\" cheese.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Tucker, I am, like Samson, slaying my thousands.\"\r\n\r\n\"And with the same weapon?\" inquired St. George.\r\n\r\nWe had a delightful addition to our society in Powhatan Starke, who\r\ncame from the Eastern Shore, and spent a year first as a guest of\r\nthe Southalls, and later of all of us. He seemed to have been created\r\nfor the express purpose of making people happy. He would have us all\r\nconvulsed with laughter while he held the woollen skeins for my aunt's\r\nknitting. He taught me on the piano waltzes not to be found in the\r\nbooks; and the polka, a new dance with picturesque figures just then\r\nintroduced. He joined in and enhanced every scheme for pleasure, and\r\nwould finally spend half the night serenading us. \"The serenade,\"\r\naccording to a recent definition, \"is a cherished courtship custom of\r\nprimitive societies.\" Courtship had nothing to do with it in 1847.\r\nIt was only a delicate compliment to ladies who had entertained the\r\nserenaders. Four or five voices in unison would sing such songs as \"Oft\r\nin the Stilly Night,\" \"The Last Rose of Summer,\" \"Eileen Aroon,\" \"Flow\r\nGently, Sweet Afton,\" and one voice render Rizzio's lovely song:—\r\n\r\n                 \"Queen of my soul whose starlit eyes\r\n                 Are all the light I seek,\r\n                 Whose voice in sweetest melodies\r\n                 Can love or pardon speak;\r\n                   I yield me to thy soft control\r\n                   Mary—Mary—Queen of my soul!\r\n     (_Chorus_) Mary! Mary! Queen of my soul!\"\r\n\r\nWith the first twang of the guitar strings we would slip from our beds,\r\nfind our shawls and slippers, and creep downstairs. Crouched close to\r\nthe door, we would listen for _Vive l'amour_, the song always concluding\r\nthe serenade:—\r\n\r\n     \"Let every bachelor fill up his glass,\r\n               Vive la Compagnie!\r\n     And drink to the health of his favorite lass,\r\n               Vive la Compagnie!\"\r\n\r\nAnd just here, rising as it were to a question of privilege concerning\r\nindividual rights, let me solemnly assure my reader that I do not\r\nplagiarize from \"Trilby.\" The low-hanging fruit of Mr. Du Maurier's\r\nbountiful orchard is to be desired to make wise the daughters of Eve,\r\nbut this Eve has no occasion to rob it. _Au contraire!_ Powhatan Starke\r\nhad brought this song from Paris in the forties and sung it for us\r\ntwenty years before, according to Du Maurier, the \"genteel Carnegie\"\r\nhad given it in his hiccupy voice to the Laird, Taffy, Little Billie,\r\nDodor, Zouzou, and the rest.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I should like to help myself with both hands to the clever\r\nthings the young authors are writing. But I am \"proud, tho' poor!\"\r\nBesides, I should be found out!\" Mon verre n'est pas grand, mais je bois\r\ndans mon verre.\"\r\n\r\nI know, I have heard, but one verse of this immortal song. All the\r\nrest were freshly made, whether at dinner, evening party, or moonlight\r\nserenade, to suit the company and the occasion. The chorus, as rendered\r\nby Carnegie the genteel, was:—\r\n\r\n     \"Veeverler, Veeverler, veverler vee\r\n             Veverler Companyee.\"\r\n\r\nBut my friend twenty years before respected it enough to be accurate:—\r\n\r\n     \"Vive! Vive! Vive l'amour\r\n     Vive la compagnie!\"\r\n\r\nOnly he, like _les autres_, sometimes dropped his \"_r_'s.\" They were all\r\nnice in their pronunciation. They gave to the broad \"_a_\" its fullest\r\ndue.\r\n\r\n     \"E'en the slight hahbell raised its head\r\n     Elahstic from her ahry tread!\"\r\n\r\nexclaimed George Gordon, as one of the maidens tripped across the lawn.\r\nBut even he was sometimes indifferent to the rights, as a terminal,\r\nof the letter \"_r_\"; for only as a terminal does the Southern tongue\r\nutterly scorn it. When but a lisping infant, a possible orator was\r\ndrilled in the test words:—\r\n\r\n     \"Around the rugged rocks\r\n     The ragged rascal ran,\"\r\n\r\nand taught to roll the elusive consonant to the utmost limit.\r\n\r\nBut I must linger no longer in this enchanted valley among the\r\nmountains. A long road lies before me. I must pass swiftly on. With just\r\nsuch trifling events I might fill my book. Dear to every heart are the\r\nannals of its youth; before we enter the vast world of—\r\n\r\n     \"Effort, and expectation and desire—\r\n     And something evermore about to be.\"\r\n\r\nWe cherish the sweet nothings of a happy time as we preserve dried\r\nrose-leaves. Mayhap through their faint fragrance we may dream the rose!\r\n\r\nIt was a busy time as well as a happy time. I was helping Mrs. William\r\nC. Rives build a church; I was hemstitching all the ruffles for Thomasia\r\nWoodson's trousseau; I was playing waltzes, _ad infinitum_, at the\r\nhouse-parties in Charlotte—the Henrys and Carringtons—and singing\r\ncampaign songs, to the great delight of my dear grandfather, in honor\r\nof my old friend, Henry Clay, whom we were once more trying to make our\r\nPresident:—\r\n\r\n     \"Get out o' the way, you're all unlucky;\r\n     Clear the track for old Kentucky!\"\r\n\r\n(And just here I wish to record the fact that only once in all my life\r\ndid my old grandfather ever reprove me. I had committed a flagrant act\r\nof _lèse majestie_. I had put a nightcap on the bust of Patrick Henry!)\r\n\r\nBut my dear aunt's invitations, written on paper embossed with an\r\norange-blossom and tied with white satin ribbon, were now issued for my\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\nI had begun my acquaintance with the young man known now as \"the\r\nGeneral,\" or \"the Judge,\" by beseeching God to take care of him.\r\nAccording to my Presbyterian training, I was taught that every prayer\r\nmust be followed by efforts for its fulfilment. It was clearly my duty\r\n\"to take care of him.\" He needed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo years after our marriage, my husband was seriously ill from an\r\naffection of the throat, and consulted Dr. Green, an eminent specialist\r\nof Philadelphia. He was ordered to a warmer climate, and forbidden to\r\nspeak in or out of court. The tiny law office at a corner of the court\r\ngreen in Charlottesville was abandoned, and we hastened to Petersburg,\r\nnear his birthplace. As it was absolutely impossible for him to exist\r\nwithout occupation, he purchased a newspaper, sallied forth one morning\r\nto solicit subscribers for \"_The South Side Democrat_,\" and before a\r\nweek's end was justified in beginning its issue.\r\n\r\nThis step determined his career in life. He did not practise law until\r\nhe came to New York in 1865.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty-two he became an enthusiastic editor. The little\r\n_South Side Democrat_ soon evinced pluck and spirit. Its youthful editor\r\nsailed his small craft right into the troubled sea of politics, local\r\nand national, to sink or swim according to its merits and the wisdom\r\nof its pilot. It was loved of the gods, with the inevitable result,—but\r\nnot until he left it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: STEPHEN A. DOUGLAS.]\r\n\r\nI remember our first meeting with Stephen A. Douglas, so soon to become\r\na conspicuous figure in our political history. He had just returned from\r\nEurope, and was passing through Petersburg with his first wife (Miss\r\nMartin of North Carolina), and of course glad to talk with the editor\r\nof a Democratic paper, aspiring as he did to the highest office in the\r\ncountry. He was thirty-nine years old, and below the average height. But\r\nthe word _insignificant_ could never have been applied to him. There was\r\nsomething in his air, his carriage, that forbade it. His massive head,\r\nhis resolute face, more than compensated for his short stature.\r\n\r\nHe has always been accused of rude, unconventional manners. He was\r\nenough of a courtier to inform me that I resembled the Empress Eugénie.\r\n\r\nTo us he took the trouble to be charming, talked of his European\r\nexperience—of everything, in fact, except the perilous stuff burning\r\nin his own bosom, his hunger for the presidency. Like my editor,\r\nhe had been admitted to the bar before he had reached his majority.\r\nThe parallel was to appear again later. Mr. Douglas also had been a\r\nrepresentative in Congress at thirty.\r\n\r\nMy husband was a delegate to the Democratic Convention that nominated\r\nFranklin Pierce in 1852, and Mr. Douglas suffered himself to be a\r\ncandidate.\r\n\r\nThe \"Little Giant\" received at first only 20 votes, but he steadily\r\nincreased until Virginia cast her 15 votes for Mr. Pierce, after which\r\nthere was \"a stampede\" which decided the matter. Some writer reminded\r\nDouglas that vaulting ambition overleaps itself, but added dryly,\r\n\"Perhaps the little Judge never read Shakespeare and does not think of\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting event in Petersburg was a brief visit from Louis Kossuth\r\n_en route_ to the Southern and Western cities, his avowed purpose being\r\n\"to invoke the aid of the great American republic to protect his people;\r\npeaceably, if they may, by the moral influence of their declarations;\r\nbut forcibly, if they must, by the physical power of their arm—to\r\nprevent any foreign interference in the struggle to be renewed for the\r\nliberties of Hungary.\"\r\n\r\nOur Congress, it will be remembered,[1] had, after Kossuth's defeat\r\nand his detention in Turkey—whither he had fled for refuge—directed\r\nthe President to offer one of the ships of our Mediterranean squadron\r\nto bring him and his suite to our country. The Turkish government had\r\nno especial use for Governor Kossuth as a guest or as a captive, and\r\naccordingly he landed from the steamer _Vanderbilt_ which had been sent\r\nwith a committee to meet him, at New York quarantine, December 5, 1851,\r\nat one o'clock in the morning. Early as was the hour, a great crowd\r\ncollected on shore to greet him. A salute of twenty-one guns and an\r\naddress of welcome from the health-officer at once assured him that he\r\ncame to us, not to be pitied as a defeated refugee, but to receive all\r\nhonor due a conquering hero. As his boat steamed by, Governor's Island\r\ngave him a salute of thirty-one guns, New Jersey one hundred and twenty,\r\nand New York,—but we know how New York can behave! Steamers, great and\r\nsmall, whistled, pistols and guns were fired, Hungarian cheers were\r\nshouted, and our Stars and Stripes took into close embrace the Hungarian\r\nflag. We know New York hospitality, and her enthusiasm, nay, crazy\r\nexcitement when something, anything, novel and interesting happens.\r\n\r\nWhen Kossuth reached Castle Garden, the unhappy mayor essayed in vain to\r\nread his speech. Speech, indeed! A hundred thousand throats were aching\r\nwith a speech, and they delivered it with a roar!\r\n\r\n\"There was,\" says a reporter, \"a continuous roar of cheers like waves on\r\nthe shore.\" Every house was decorated; and as the hero passed, mounted\r\non Black Warrior, a horse which had borne conquerors in many Florida\r\nand Mexican wars, the street was jammed with enthusiastic people, and\r\nthe windows alive with women and children. Never, since the landing of\r\nLafayette, had New York so abandoned herself to enthusiasm. The story is\r\ntoo long—of the speeches, processions, dinners, receptions, fire-works,\r\netc.—to be repeated fully in these pages.\r\n\r\nOf course, the little _South Side Democrat_ threw up its cap with the\r\nrest. Kossuth, when he reached the town, had already received honors\r\nof which his wildest fancy never dreamed, and we did our best to echo\r\nthem according to our ability. There were several ladies in his suite\r\nto whom I paid my respects (I am not sure his wife was among them), and\r\nthe only impression they made upon me was one of extreme weariness. They\r\nspoke English fairly well, but were too utterly worn out to exhibit the\r\nleast animation. Kossuth spoke English perfectly. He had a long talk\r\nwith my young editor, to whom he gave a huge cigar, which was never\r\nreduced to ashes! But after he left, the _South Side Democrat_ came to\r\nits senses (having never utterly lost them), and expressed a decided\r\nopinion in favor of the non-intervention of this country in the affairs\r\nof Hungary, giving good reasons therefor. Kossuth, when the paper was\r\nhanded him, read the editorial carefully, and exclaimed, \"_So young_,\r\nand yet so depraved!\" adding, with his usual tact, \"I mean, of course,\r\npolitically!\"\r\n\r\nBut even at this highest pinnacle of glory in New York, when an\r\neditorial banquet was given him at The Astor by George Bancroft, William\r\nCullen Bryant, Henry J. Raymond, Parke Godwin, Henry Ward Beecher,\r\nCharles A. Dana, and others, Mr. Webster had coldly declined attendance.\r\n\r\nHis letter was received with hisses and groans. \"Kossuth,\" said Mr.\r\nWebster, in a private letter from Washington, \"is a gentleman in\r\nappearance and demeanor, is handsome enough in person, evidently\r\nintellectual and dignified, amiable and graceful in his manners. I shall\r\ntreat him with all personal and individual respect; but if he should\r\nspeak to me of the policy of 'intervention,' I shall have ears more deaf\r\nthan adders'.\"\r\n\r\nThe Senate, the President, Congress, all received him cordially. He\r\ndined at the White House; was treated with the utmost distinction, and\r\na seat of honor assigned him on the floor of the Senate; but before\r\nhe left Washington, every one except himself knew that his mission had\r\nfailed. He soon discovered it, and appealed no longer for intervention\r\nbut for money. He complained bitterly at Pittsburg that he had received\r\nlittle but costly banquets and foolish parades. The net amount of the\r\ncontributions to his cause was less than $100,000, and according to\r\nhis statement at Pittsburg, only $30,000 remained for the purchase\r\nof muskets. We had expressed with enthusiasm our appreciation of his\r\npatriotism, courage, and devotion. We had entertained him _en prince_.\r\nWe had added a substantial gift. It was not enough.\r\n\r\nThe citizens of New York very soon calmed down, and by the middle\r\nof January the name of Kossuth was rarely mentioned. When Congress\r\ncame to audit his hotel bill, it fairly gasped! The retainers of the\r\npoor refugee had not been poor livers. They had occupied luxurious\r\napartments, and proved beyond a shadow of doubt the Hungarian\r\nappreciation of old Madeira and champagne. No one, however, could accuse\r\nthe hero himself of excess. Still, all at once, he seemed less of a\r\nhero.\r\n\r\nOne unprejudiced looker-on in Vienna, Ampère, wrote of Kossuth at the\r\neditorial dinner, \"He has the bad taste to love fanciful dress, wore a\r\n_lévite_ of black velvet, and seemed to me much less imposing than when\r\nhe harangued, leaning upon his sword, in the hall at Castle Garden.\"\r\nAmpère also philosophizes upon our American enthusiasm,—\"the only lively\r\namusement of the multitude in a country where one has little to amuse\r\none. It is without consequence and without danger, simply to let out\r\nthe steam (_à lâcher la vapeur_), not to cause explosions but to prevent\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"The American likes excitement,\" says Bryce in 'The American\r\nCommonwealth,' \"but he is shrewd and keen; his passion seldom obscures\r\nhis reason; he keeps his head when a Frenchman, or an Italian, or\r\neven a German, would lose it. Yet he is also of an excitable temper,\r\nwith emotions capable of being quickly and strongly stirred. He likes\r\nexcitement for its own sake, and goes wherever he can find it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kossuth episode vividly illustrated this! _Sic transit gloria_—be\r\nit prince or patriot!\r\n\r\nMy young editor had soon to leave the _South Side Democrat_ under the\r\ncare of a foster-father. He was summoned to Washington—lured less by\r\na fine salary than the larger field—to edit with John W. Forney the\r\n_Washington Union_, then the national Democratic organ. It was desired\r\nthat one of the two editors should be from the South. Mr. Forney\r\nrepresented the North.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had the good fortune to secure pleasant rooms in the large\r\nboarding-house of Mrs. Tully Wise, sister of Henry A. Wise of Virginia.\r\nMrs. Wise had a number of agreeable people in her house: Professor and\r\nMrs. Spenser Baird of the Smithsonian Institution; Professor Baird's\r\nassistants,—Mr. Turner, an Englishman, and a Swiss naturalist whom\r\nProfessor Baird addressed as \"George,\"—Mr. James Heth, Commissioner of\r\nPensions, and his family; Commodore Pennock and his wife, sister of Mrs.\r\n(Admiral) Farragut, and others. I must not forget Miss Dick, whose rooms\r\nwere above mine, and who hovered around like the plump, busy little\r\nbird that she was. A long table in the dining-room was filled with \"new\"\r\npeople—desirable possibly, but not known by us. There were the _nouveau\r\nriche_ party from New York, the tall, angular, large-limbed, _passée_\r\nyoung woman and her fat mamma; there were the well-groomed government\r\nclerk and his stylish young wife; a French count, a German baron; a\r\nphysician (Dr. McNalty), and a beautiful dark-eyed young lady who always\r\nwore a camellia in her dusky hair, Miss —well, let her be \"Miss Vernon,\"\r\nwith her father. Lesser lights plenty—a large number in all.\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Wise herself gathered pleasant men and women around her.\r\nIn her little parlor we met Dr. Yelverton Garnett, our devoted friend\r\nin all his after life—Mrs. Garnett, daughter of Henry A. Wise, and a\r\ncharming young sister, Annie Wise. Our hostess was a widow, well born\r\nand good, who was educating, alone and unaided, five splendid boys, who\r\nlived to reward her by their own worth and success.\r\n\r\nWe were made thoroughly comfortable, and I soon learned that the \"man\r\nbehind the gun,\" to whom it behooved me to be civil, was the head\r\nwaiter, Patrick, tall, black, stern, and unyielding. No use in trying\r\nblandishments on Patrick! If one were starved, having overstayed\r\nappointed hours, she must fast until the next meal or find refreshment\r\nelsewhere. I once complained to Mrs. Wise,—that I lost the sweetest\r\nhour in the late afternoon for my stroll on Pennsylvania Avenue; and\r\nrepresented the perfect ease with which Patrick could keep my tea for\r\nme. She listened with sympathy to the oft-told tale.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know, my dear,\" she said kindly, \"Patrick—now you know\r\nPatrick is _so_ good! There's nobody like Patrick! He has some trouble,\r\nwith all those strangers to serve. I know you would like to help\r\nPatrick! Yes, to be sure, it would seem to be a simple thing to set\r\naside a biscuit and bit of cold tongue for you, and keep the kettle\r\nhot on the hearth,—but you see Patrick,—well, he _is_ so good, you'll\r\nnot have the heart to trouble him! And dear! I think you will yourself\r\nchoose to be indoors early here in Washington.\"\r\n\r\nThe one who was \"dear\" was Mrs. Wise—the noblest and best of women.\r\n\r\nVery soon I found that with all these pieces upon the board, a lively\r\ngame might be expected. Miss Dick, whose brother was employed by the\r\ngovernment, soon enlightened me: the rich New York girl wanted a title.\r\nShe was \"trying to catch\" the baron, and would succeed, \"as nobody else\r\nwanted either of them.\" Miss Vernon was dying for love of Dr. McNalty.\r\nShe was going into a decline. Probably the doctor was ignorant of the\r\nstate of things. Such a beautiful girl—a perfect lady! Somebody ought\r\nto speak to the doctor. She, (Miss Dick) couldn't. Nobody would listen\r\nto an old maid—\"perhaps _you_, Mrs. Pryor\"—(\"Oh, mercy, no\")—well, then,\r\npoor girl! The French count was flirting with the wife of the government\r\nclerk. Her husband would find _her_ out, never fear! There was danger\r\nof a hostile meeting before the winter was over. Then that hateful old\r\nDr. Todkin, with his straw-colored wig! To be sure, she and some others\r\nliked the parlors kept dark—but what business had he to say he hoped\r\nsome lady would come who \"liked the light and _could bear the light_!\"\r\nSuch Dutch impertinence!\r\n\r\nI received these confidences of Miss Dick in my own rooms, for I soon\r\nlearned, with Mrs. Baird and Mrs. Heth, that the public drawing-room\r\nwas no place for me.\r\n\r\n\"Gossip!\" said they. \"It has gone beyond gossip! The air is thick with\r\nsomething worse. You might cut it with a knife.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not long before we had a ripple in our own calm waters.\r\nOn one side of me at our round table sat Mr. George, the eccentric,\r\nsmall, intense Swiss naturalist, who amused me much by affecting to be\r\na woman-hater.\r\n\r\n\"Not that they concern me,\" he said, \"but,—well, I find fishes more\r\ninteresting. I understand them better.\"\r\n\r\nBeside my husband was placed our special pet, Maria Heth, taken under\r\nour wing in the absence of her parents, neither of whom ever appeared.\r\nThe circle was completed by Professor and Mrs. Baird, little Lucy Baird,\r\nand Mr. Turner. In course of time my right-hand man fell into silence,\r\nbroken by long-drawn sighs. I supposed he had lost a \"specimen,\" or\r\nfailed to find enough bones in some fish he was to classify, or maybe\r\nheard bad news from home, or belike had a toothache; so, after a few\r\nessays on my part to encourage him, I let him alone. Presently his place\r\nat the board was vacant. Things went on in this way until one morning,\r\nearly, Maria Heth knocked at my door.\r\n\r\n\"I am troubled about Mr. George,\" she said. \"I am sorry to worry you,\r\nbut I'm afraid there's no help for it. Mamma is too nervous to hear\r\nunpleasant things, and I'm afraid of exciting papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come to the point, Maria! Mr. George, you say! Well, then, what about\r\nMr. George?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know he's been missing nearly a week. It was no business of\r\nmine. I had no dream _I_ had anything to do with it. But see what he\r\nhas written me! 'This comes to you from a broken-hearted man. _Forget\r\nhim!_ You will meet him no more on earth. Perhaps—_yonder!_ George.'\"\r\n\r\nQuestioning Maria further, she confessed that on the day Mr. George\r\ndisappeared, she received from him a passionate love-letter. She had\r\nanswered him curtly. Yes,—she certainly had told him what she thought\r\nof his impertinence. \"Of course, I am distressed, but what could I\r\ndo,\" said the poor child. \"You know my brother! Richard would have been\r\nenraged. I had to settle him once for all to save trouble.\"\r\n\r\nI went immediately to Mrs. Baird with my information. She, too, had\r\nbecome anxious at the sudden disappearance of the young naturalist. He\r\nhad not been seen at the Institution, and investigation revealed the\r\nfact that he had not occupied his rooms. Professor Baird was deeply\r\nconcerned, and a vigorous search was made for the missing man.\r\n\r\nUpon returning from my walk that evening, I found a note on my table\r\nfrom Mrs. Baird. The runaway had been found. It would be unnecessary\r\nto drag the river or notify the police. He was discovered in the upper\r\nchamber of an humble lodging-house, very limp and penitent, but \"clothed\r\nand in his right mind.\" He had not been drinking, he had not been in\r\nthe river. I never knew what Professor Baird did to him—pulled him\r\nout of bed, very likely, and shook him into his senses. So we lost Mr.\r\nGeorge (whose surname I dare not reveal), and he was doubtless mightily\r\nstrengthened in his opinion of women—not to be understood by him and\r\nnot, by any means, comparable to fishes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should not leave the _dramatis personæ_ of our boarding-house\r\n\"in the air.\" Before I left Mrs. Wise, the baron was safely moored into\r\nharbor by the tall young lady from New York. The government clerk had\r\nopenly insulted the French count, and it was supposed a challenge had\r\npassed between them. Evidently nothing had come of it. If they fought,\r\nit was a bloodless battle. The exquisite Miss Vernon had reappeared,\r\nthinner, paler, but radiant and beautiful exceedingly. Miss Dick\r\nwas puzzled. Perhaps the girl had \"gotten over it,\" like a sensible\r\nwoman. Perhaps she had not been ill at all—only hysterical. It was not\r\nimpossible she might have feigned illness \"to bring him around.\" These\r\nwere some of the solutions of the problem that occurred to Miss Dick.\r\n\r\nI could have enlightened her. One evening, Dr. McNalty, whom I knew\r\nbut slightly, spoke to me in the hall. He had a soft white parcel in\r\nhis hand and seemed embarrassed and agitated. He begged me to do him a\r\ngreat kindness—would I see Miss Vernon—not send a messenger, see her\r\nmyself and give her some camellias from him. Possibly there might be\r\nsome message from her. He would await my return.\r\n\r\nWould I? I flew on the wings of hope and keen interest. I comprehended\r\nthe situation. Of course there had been a misunderstanding. Possibly\r\nhis letters had been returned and unopened. Only a desperate necessity\r\ncould have nerved him to appeal to me—almost a stranger. I rose to the\r\noccasion, and when I was admitted to Miss Vernon's room, I was prepared\r\nto be an eloquent advocate, should circumstances encourage and justify\r\nme.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to Dr. McNalty, I bore a message. She had laid the\r\ncamellias against her lovely cheek and said, \"Tell him his flowers are\r\nwhispering to me.\"\r\n\r\nI hope my reader will appreciate my reticence in ending this little\r\nstory just here. If, as Talleyrand declared, \"a man who suppresses\r\na _bon mot_ deserves canonization,\" is there no nimbus for the woman\r\nwho, for truth's sake, suppresses the _dénouement_ of a love story? The\r\ntemptation is great to amplify a little, embroider a little—but then I\r\nshould have to reckon with my conscience, with the certainty of being\r\nworsted.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I know only this of the young woman I am\r\nconstrained to call Miss Vernon. Her true name was one well and\r\nhonorably known in history. She was the most beautiful of all\r\ndark-eyed women I have ever known—of course the blue-eyed angels are\r\nexceptional—and her manners and attire were as elegant as her person.\r\nShe wore rich velvet, then much in vogue, and only one jewel:—\r\n\r\n     \"On her fair breast a sparkling cross she wore\r\n     Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore.\"\r\n\r\nI never knew the end of the romance in which I bore a small part. I\r\nnever even knew of what whisperings camellias are capable. Had they been\r\nviolets—or roses, or lilies of the valley—but big white camellias! I\r\nonly know she recovered and that Dr. McNalty thanked me warmly for my\r\nsmall service. That is all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Fillmore was a fine type of the kind of man Americans love to raise\r\nto the highest office in their gift. He had not been a mill boy, nor\r\nlived in a log-cabin, nor split rails (which was to his discredit),\r\nbut he had been an apprentice to a wool-carder in Livingston County,\r\nNew York. Afterward he had worked in a lawyer's office all day and\r\nstudied at night. He had had no patron. He was essentially a self-made\r\nman. When, by the death of President Taylor, he became President of\r\nthe United States, he fitted into the place as if he had made himself\r\nexpressly for it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ampère, who observed us so narrowly in 1852, \"M. Fillmore\r\navait un cachet de simplicité digne et bienveillante, qui me semble\r\nfaire de lui le type de ce que doit être un président Américain.\"\r\n\r\nBut nobody said any of those fine things about dear Mrs. Fillmore. The\r\n_cachet de simplicité_ she certainly possessed, but she wore it with\r\na difference. In a President it was admirable, in a beautiful woman it\r\nwould have been adorable. It stamped plain, unhandsome, ungraceful Mrs.\r\nFillmore as ordinary, commonplace. She was the soul of kindness. \"She\r\nhas no manner,\" said a woman of fashion. \"She is absolutely simple. It\r\nis not good form to be so motherly to her guests. Why, what do you think\r\nshe said to me at the last levee? 'You look pale and ill, my dear! Pray\r\nfind a seat.' Think of that! Haven't I a right to look pale and ill, I\r\nwonder!\"\r\n\r\n\"She meant to be kind,\" I ventured. \"Should she have permitted you to\r\nfaint on the floor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kind, indeed! It was her duty, if she thought me 'gone off in my\r\nlooks,' to tell me how _well_ I was looking! I should have been all\r\nright after that. As it was, I came straight home and went to bed.\"\r\n\r\nI fairly revelled in the music I could now hear. From a famous musician,\r\nMr. Palmer, I took lessons again. He was a notable character—a splendid\r\nmusician, and a welcome guest at Mr. Corcoran's and other houses, where\r\nhe amused the company with tricks of legerdemain. He afterward became\r\nthe celebrated \"Heller,\" the prince of legerdemain and clairvoyance.\r\nThe elder Booth, Hackett, and Anna Cora Mowatt introduced me to the\r\nfascinations of the stage. Nothing to my mind had ever been, could ever\r\nbe, finer than their Hamlet, Falstaff, and Parthenia. The Armstrongs\r\ngave me _carte blanche_ to their box at the theatre, and I saw\r\neverything. I wonder if any one at the present day remembers the Ravel\r\nbrothers and their matchless pantomimes! Mrs. Baird made a party, taking\r\nlittle Lucy to see \"Jocko.\" Not a word was spoken in the play; not an\r\neye was dry in the house.\r\n\r\nOne evening an agreeable Frenchman whom we knew joined us in our box,\r\nand seeking an opportunity, whispered to me, \"Madame, will you grant me\r\na favor? There—in the parquette, second from the front, _voyez-vous?_\r\nA lady _en chapeau bleu_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I see! Who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madame\" (tragically), \"that _demoiselle_ with the young man is\r\n_fiancée_ to my friend!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are perhaps jealous!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, _mais non_, Madame! I have this moment said to my friend,\r\n'_Regardez votre fiancée_.' He has responded, '_C'est vrai!_ It is\r\ncustom of this country.'\"\r\n\r\n\"And what then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" shrugging his shoulders in scorn not to be expressed in words, \"I\r\nsay, '_Eh bien, Emil_. If _you_ satisfy, _I_ very well satisfy!' But,\r\npardon, Madame, is it _convenable_ in this country for _demoiselle_ to\r\nappear at theatre with young gentleman without chaperon?\"\r\n\r\nI found refuge in ignorance: \"I am sure I cannot say. You see I am from\r\nVirginia. I haven't been long in Washington, and customs here may differ\r\nfrom manners in my home.\"\r\n\r\nI was a proud woman when Mr. Pierce sent for my young editor to read\r\nwith him his inaugural address. These were mighty political secrets,\r\nnot to be shared with Miss Dick, and thus published to her little\r\nboarding-house world. I felt that I belonged, not to that nor to any\r\nother small world. I belonged to the nation; and strange to say, that\r\nimpression (or must I say delusion?) never left me in my darkest, most\r\nobscure days.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce liked my young editor. We adored _him_! Only since we\r\nlost him have we learned of his many mistakes, vacillation, weakness,\r\nunpopularity; nothing of these appeared in 1852. He had been a fine\r\npolitician, had served his country \"with bravery and credit,\" enlisting\r\nas a private in the Mexican War. \"His integrity was above suspicion,\r\nand he was deeply religious.\" It is quite certain he did not desire the\r\nnomination. There was nobody in his family to exult over his promotion,\r\nno son, no daughter to blossom with new beauty because of the splendid\r\nstem on which she grew. Only a sick, broken-hearted wife, too feeble to\r\nendure the exactions of social life, too sad to take part in anything\r\noutside her own room. She did not even attempt it. It was at once\r\nunderstood that our republican court was such only in name. In name only\r\ndid Mrs. Pierce appear in its annals. I never saw her. I never saw any\r\none who had seen her. We thought of her as a Mater Dolorosa, shrouded\r\nin deepest mourning, and we gave her a sacred place in our hearts.\r\n\r\nI cannot close my records of this, my earliest experience of Washington\r\nlife, without remembering with gratitude all I owe to the friendship\r\nand wisdom of the discreet, cultured women who felt an early interest in\r\nme, guiding and instructing me. Mrs. Spenser Baird, Mrs. Garnett(_née_\r\nWise), lovely Annie Wise, and Maria Heth, these were my intimate\r\nfriends. Mrs. Garnett, a lovely Christian woman, watched me closely\r\nand restrained me in my natural desire for beautiful raiment. I once\r\nconfessed to her, almost with tears, that Léonide Delarue had beguiled\r\nme into giving forty dollars for a bonnet, whereupon she produced\r\npencil and paper and proved that the material (exclusive of a bit of\r\nsuperfluous point-lace) could be obtained for ten dollars. The young\r\nEnglish queen, it was said, could make her own bonnets. But I could\r\nnot succeed as a milliner. I had some talent, but not in that line.\r\nHowever, that I might please and surprise Mrs. Garnett and also imitate\r\nthe Queen, when the time came for me to indulge myself in a winter\r\nbonnet (we did not call them hats—they weren't hats!), I essayed the\r\n\"creation\" of one with velvet, satin, and feathers galore. It was a\r\ndreadful failure! I took it to Madame Delarue's and begged her to tell\r\nme what ailed it.\r\n\r\n\"_Mon Dieu!_\" she exclaimed, throwing up her hands in despair,\r\n\"_pesante_.\"\r\n\r\nI gave away my \"creation\" to somebody in my service—anybody who would\r\ncondescend to accept it. Mrs. Garnett felt I could hardly afford to try\r\nagain. She knew, however, how important to me as a young politician's\r\nwife would be the virtue of economy. It is not written in the stars\r\nthat an honest politician can ever be rich. A great evening reception\r\nwas to be given by some magnate at which my young editor consented to\r\nbe present. He secretly visited Harper's fine store and brought home a\r\nlovely \"bertha\" for me made of three rows of point-lace. I gasped! But\r\nI was prudent. I accepted it with apparent pleasure, went to Harper's,\r\nfound it had been charged, and effected its return. But here was a\r\ndilemma. I was to attend the reception. I was to wear evening dress and\r\na beautiful \"bertha.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not imitation lace?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\nHarper had,—and the imitation was good,—the price of plenty of it ten\r\ndollars. I guiltily made the exchange, took a searching look at my\r\nmodel, and perfectly copied it.\r\n\r\nThat evening, brave in my counterfeit presentment I stood under a blaze\r\nof light with my intimates, Mrs. Clay, Mrs. Fitzpatrick, and others\r\naround me. My editor approached and was complimented upon my appearance.\r\n\"Ah, but,\" he said, in the pride of his young heart, \"if I can only keep\r\nit up! Why, Mrs. Clay, that bit of lace cost me hundreds of dollars!\" I\r\ncaught the wondering eyes of my fully instructed friends, gave them an\r\nimploring glance—and when the boastful young fellow departed, told them\r\nmy story. They said I was a very silly woman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. Fillmore's tastes had been sufficiently ripened to enable him to\r\ngather around him men of literary taste and attainment. John P. Kennedy,\r\na man of elegant accomplishments, was Secretary of the Navy. Washington\r\nIrving was often Mr. Kennedy's guest. We knew these men, and among them\r\nnone was brighter, wittier, or more genial than G. P. R. James, the\r\nEnglish novelist whose star rose and set before 1860. He was the most\r\nprolific of writers, \"Like an endless chain of buckets in a well,\" said\r\none; \"as fast as one is emptied, up comes another.\"\r\n\r\nWe were very fond of Mr. James. One day he dashed in, much excited:—\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen the _Intelligencer_? By George, it's all true! Six times\r\nhas my hero, a 'solitary horseman,' emerged from a wood! My word! I\r\nwas totally unconscious of it! Fancy it! Six times! Well, it's all up\r\nwith that fellow. He has got to dismount and enter on foot—a beggar, or\r\nburglar, or pedler, or at best a mendicant friar.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" suggested one, \"he might drive, mightn't he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" said Mr. James. \"Imagine a hero in a gig or a curricle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said one, \"the word 'solitary' has given offence. Americans\r\ndislike exclusiveness. They are sensitive, you see, and look out for\r\nsnobs.\"\r\n\r\nHe made himself very merry over it; but the solitary horseman appeared\r\nno more in the few novels he was yet to write.\r\n\r\nOne day, after a pleasant visit from Mr. James and his wife, I\r\naccompanied them at parting to the front door, and found some difficulty\r\nin turning the bolt. He offered to assist, but I said no—he was not\r\nsupposed to understand the mystery of an American front door.\r\n\r\nHaving occasion a few minutes afterward to open the door for another\r\ndeparting guest, there on his knees outside was Mr. James, who\r\nlaughingly explained that he had left his wife at the corner, and had\r\ncome back to investigate that mystery. \"Perhaps you will tell me,\" he\r\nadded, and was much amused to learn that the American door opened of\r\nitself to an incoming guest, but positively refused, without coaxing,\r\nto let him out. \"By George, that's fine!\" he said, \"that'll please the\r\ncritics in my next.\" I never knew whether it was admitted, for I must\r\nconfess that, even with the stimulus of his presence, his books were\r\ndreary reading to my uninstructed taste.\r\n\r\nA very lovely and charming actress was prominent in Washington society\r\nat this time,—the daughter of an old New York family, Anna Cora (Ogden)\r\nMowatt. She was especially interesting to Virginians, for she had\r\ncaptivated Foushee Ritchie, soon afterward my husband's partner on the\r\neditorship of the _Richmond Enquirer_. Mr. Ritchie, a confirmed old\r\nbachelor, had been fascinated by Mrs. Mowatt's Parthenia (in \"Ingomar\"),\r\nand was now engaged to her. He proudly brought to me a pair of velvet\r\nslippers she had embroidered for him, working around them as a border\r\na quotation from \"Ingomar\":—\r\n\r\n     \"Two souls with but a single thought,\r\n     Two hearts that beat as one.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nI was peacefully enjoying a cup of tea with Mrs. Arnold Harris, when her\r\nfather, old General Armstrong, entered, and brought me the astounding\r\nnews that my husband had resigned his position as editor of the\r\n_Washington Union_.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that boy! He thinks he knows more about foreign politics than I do.\"\r\n\r\nI was very fond of the General, who had always treated me in a fatherly\r\nand most kind manner. But of course I could not hear my husband\r\ndiscussed, even by him, so I expressed polite regrets and hastened\r\nhome. It was too true! The junior partner had published in the _Union_\r\na very strong article, taking the part of Russia in the Crimean War,\r\nand General Armstrong had wished him to disavow it \"upon further\r\nconsideration.\" He had refused, and declared he must write according\r\nto his convictions or not at all. The matter might possibly have\r\nbeen adjusted, had not the General, with more zeal than discretion,\r\nremonstrated with him upon the ground that he should \"think twice before\r\ngiving up a large salary.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a very ugly word in the English language of which I, as a\r\nchild, stood in mortal fear. I had then never read that word anywhere\r\nexcept in the Bible or my Catechism. I had never heard it except in the\r\npulpit. I had an idea that the devil, in whose personality I believed,\r\nbut of whom I had never thought enough to be afraid, might appear at any\r\nmoment in connection with that inviting word, if uttered out of church.\r\n\r\nOnly lately has it been shorn of its terrors by being left out root and\r\nbranch in the revision of the Bible. Now, although offensive to ears\r\npolite, it is no longer supposed to imperil the safety of the soul.\r\nUnless refined taste forbids, it may in seasons of peculiar vexation of\r\nspirit—_à lâcher la vapeur_—be applied to things inanimate: to a \"spot\"\r\nthat will not \"out,\" to tiresome \"iteration,\" to \"faint praise,\" or,\r\non general principles, suitably preface the pronoun \"it,\" but never to\r\nliving individuals! That would be uncivil to a degree—highly imprudent,\r\nand likely to result unpleasantly. There can be no doubt of the fact\r\nthat it contains certain mysterious elements of relief and comfort, else\r\nwhy its frequent use by men and not infrequent use by some women?\r\n\r\nAt the time of which I am writing it was to me still a desperate word of\r\nevil source and evil omen. Even now the cells of my brain respond with\r\na shudder when I hear it.\r\n\r\nYou can then imagine the shock I sustained when I learned my husband's\r\nreply to the good old General's overture.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say?\" I had sternly demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you _will_ have it—I said, '_damn_ the money!'\"\r\n\r\nWe did not leave Washington immediately. My editor knew he could make\r\ngood his position in regard to Russia in her quarrel with England, and\r\nMr. Gales offered him the columns of the _National Intelligencer_ for\r\nthat purpose. He wrote a long and able defence of Russia. Caleb Cushing\r\nmet him afterward and congratulated him on an article which was, he\r\nsaid, \"unanswered and unanswerable.\"\r\n\r\nHe was fascinated with editorial life, immediately bought an interest in\r\nthe _Richmond Enquirer_, and became co-editor with William F. Ritchie.\r\nWe had inaugurated President Pierce, whose friendship promised much. I\r\nhad made charming friends in Washington,—Mrs. Gales and Mrs. Seaton,\r\nMrs. Crittenden, beautiful Adele Cutts (afterward Mrs. Douglas),\r\nMrs. \"Clem\" Clay, and other charming wives of the representatives in\r\nCongress. But I was not sorry to leave the city. My dear Blue Mountains\r\nwere awaiting me. For years I could never return to them without a\r\nswelling heart. I was going back for a long visit to my aunt and the\r\nbaby girl I had lent her (to keep her own dear heart from breaking\r\nwhen I left her), and I had a splendid boy to show my friends in\r\nCharlottesville—the old people only—for all my confrères had married\r\nand taken wing.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Mr. Pierce sent my husband on a special mission\r\nto Greece. I could not accompany him. I could not travel with my\r\nbabies—there were now three—nor could I leave them with my delicate\r\naunt. I went with him as far as Washington, where we spent one day and\r\nnight. A dinner had been arranged to witness the unfolding of a superb\r\nspecimen of the _Agave Americana_, supposed to be over fifty years\r\nold, and which now, for the first time in the memory of the present\r\ngeneration, had suddenly thrown up a great stalk crowned with a bud\r\nnearly a foot long.\r\n\r\nWe did not attend the dinner, but at midnight, upon answering a knock\r\nat the door, there stood a man bearing in his arms the splendid flower.\r\nA thick fringe of narrow, pure white petals formed a rosette, and from\r\nthe centre rose a plume of golden stamens. I was resolved this midnight\r\nbeauty should not discover the dawn which signals the closing of its\r\npetals, so I placed it in the ample fireplace, made a framework of\r\ncanes, parasols, and umbrellas around it and covered the whole with a\r\nblanket. In the morning I peeped in. It presented a tightly twisted\r\nspike, having entered upon another long sleep of fifty years, more\r\nor less. It was this flower that my husband, with outrageous American\r\nboasting, described to Queen Mathilde of Greece as an ordinary floral\r\nproduction of this country, not to be confounded with the commonplace\r\nnight-blooming Cereus, and fired an ambition in her soul that could\r\nhardly have been gratified.\r\n\r\nWhile my husband was absent on his mission, President Pierce spent one\r\nday in Charlottesville to visit the tomb and home of Jefferson, the\r\nfather of his political party. We were then at my aunt's country place,\r\nand the President wrote to me regretting he could not go out to see me,\r\nand inviting me to spend the one evening of his stay with him and a few\r\nfriends at his hotel.\r\n\r\nI had a delightful evening. He expressed the warmest friendship for\r\nthe young ambassador to Greece, and presented me with two beautiful\r\nbooks, bound sumptuously in green morocco and inscribed in his own fine\r\nhandwriting, from my \"friend Franklin Pierce.\" Those valued books were\r\ntaken from me when our house was sacked in 1865. They possibly exist\r\nsomewhere! certainly in the grateful memory of their first owner.\r\n\r\nThe President had the courtesy to express pleasure in my piano playing.\r\nI made him listen to Thalberg's \"La Stranièra,\" Henselt's \"Gondola,\"\r\nand \"L'Elisir d'Amour\"; and I left him with an impression that has never\r\nbeen lost, of his kindness of heart, his captivating voice and manner.\r\n\r\nMy husband's letters from Greece and from Egypt were extremely\r\ninteresting, and I preserved them for publication in book form. Alas!\r\nthey, too, were lost in 1865. Unable to encumber myself when I fled\r\nbefore the bullets in 1865, I sent my little son back under cover of\r\nnight to draw the box containing them to some safe place away from the\r\nbuildings and burn them. Thus I lost all records of our active life\r\nin Virginia before the eve of surrender, except those preserved in the\r\nfiles of Northern papers.\r\n\r\nPassage was taken in the _Pacific_ for my husband's return, and I went\r\ndown to Petersburg that I might be with his family to meet him. The\r\n_Pacific_ was long overdue before we would acknowledge to each other\r\nthat we were anxious,—I can hear now, as then, cries of the newsboys,\r\n\"Here's the _New York Herald_, and no news of the _Pacific_,\"—repeating\r\nlike a knell of despair, as they ran down the streets, \"_No news of the\r\nPacific! No news of the Pacific!_\" At last, when the strain was almost\r\nunbearable, my father, Dr. Pryor, ran home with the paper in his hand:\r\n\"A printed list of the passengers, my dear! Roger's name is not among\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nIt had pleased God to deliver him. He had taken passage on the _Pacific_\r\nand sent his baggage ahead of him. When he reached Marseilles, he\r\nfound his trunks and packages had been opened,—a discourtesy to an\r\nambassador,—and he remained a few days to obtain redress, allowing the\r\n_Pacific_ to sail without him. That ill-starred steamer never reached\r\nhome. The story of her fate is held where so many secrets, so many\r\ntreasures lie—in the bosom of the great deep.\r\n\r\nI have told elsewhere something of my husband's residence at Athens. It\r\nsuffices to state here that he accomplished the object of his mission to\r\nthe satisfaction of his government, and to his own pleasure and profit.\r\nHe brought me many beautiful pictures and carvings for the home we now\r\nmade in Richmond, to say nothing of corals, amber, mosaics, curios, and\r\nantiques, silks, laces, velvets, perfumes, etc., to my great content.\r\nSoon after his return, the President offered him the mission to Persia,\r\nwhich he declined. We found a pleasant house in Richmond, with ample\r\ngrounds on either side for the flowers I adored. There we set up our\r\nLares and Penates—happy housekeepers, intent on hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe great day arrived for our first large dinner-party. Although only\r\nmen were present, they were friends and neighbors, and I presided;\r\nwith my courtly uncle, Dr. Thomas Atkinson, at my right hand. We\r\nfurnished our dinners from our own kitchens in Richmond. In every\r\nrespect—so my uncle assured me—my first venture was a success. Soup,\r\nfish, roast, game, and salad with the perfection of chill demanded by\r\na self-respecting salad. Presently I saw one of the waiters whisper\r\nto the host, and an expression of alarm pass over his face. The bread\r\nhad \"given out\"! I had not imagined the enormous consumption of bread\r\nof which a wine-bibber could be capable. Passing around to the head of\r\nthe table, the dire story was repeated to me, and it was well I had a\r\nphysician at my right hand! Utter collapse threatened his young hostess.\r\nAs to the young host, he rose nobly to the occasion. \"Ah! no bread! Then\r\nwe must eat cake!\" Thenceforth at all our dinners a skeleton entered\r\nour closet—if an empty bread-tray might be dignified into a skeleton.\r\nAt every dinner and supper we gave, my husband stood in mortal terror\r\nlest the bread should give out—as it really did in very truth not many\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nI was very fond of a little factotum of my cook, whom I promoted from\r\nthe kitchen to my personal service. As no bell or knocker could reach\r\nthe ear in the regions allotted the servants, George was invested in\r\nwhite linen, and with a primer for his entertainment and culture was\r\nstationed at the door during visiting hours. He found it difficult to\r\nkeep awake. My French teacher would throw up his hands when he passed\r\nout, \"_Mon Dieu! Comme il dorme!_\" If you have ever seen Valentine's\r\nbust of the Nation's Ward, you have seen George; asleep, with his head\r\non his bosom and his spelling-book on the floor. He was of a blackness\r\nnot to be illustrated by the ace of spades, a crow's wing, or any other\r\nsable bird or object, and this circumstance, enhancing the purity of\r\nhis white linen, made him an attractive and interesting object. George\r\nhad no imagination. He was nothing if not literal. At one time ice\r\nwas scarce in Richmond. The water of the James was a rich old-gold\r\ncolor from the mud of the red-clay regions through which some of its\r\ntributaries ran, but it was considered wholesome. We filtered it for\r\ndrinking and for tea through a great Vesuvius stone. Some of the old\r\nresidents were wont to declare they preferred it to the clear water of\r\nthe springs,—several of which were in the parks of the city,—complaining\r\nthat the spring water \"lacked body.\" At the time of the ice famine we\r\nfilled tubs with this cool, muddy water, and in it kept our bottles of\r\nmilk. George once brought for my admiration some fine lettuce the cook\r\nhad bought from a cart.\r\n\r\n\"Put it in water!\" I ordered. Soon afterwards, he entered with several\r\nbottles of milk—which I also told him to \"put in water.\" What was my\r\ndismay when the cook rushed to my room in great heat:—\r\n\r\n\"I knowed that fool nigger would give you trouble!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what's the poor child done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Po' chile! Little devil, _I_ call him! He's done po'ed out all the\r\nbaby's milk in that yaller water, and seasoned it with lettuce leaves!\"\r\n\r\nWe found the society of Richmond delightful. Southern society has often\r\nbeen described, its members praised or blamed, criticised or admired,\r\naccording to the point of view; sometimes commended as \"stately but\r\ncondescending, haughty but jovial,\" possessing high self-appreciation,\r\nnot often indulging in distasteful egotism; fast friends, generous,\r\nhospitable; considering conversation an art to be studied, and fitting\r\nthemselves with just so much knowledge of literature, science, and\r\nart, as might be indispensable for conversation; but withal \"cultured,\r\neducated men of the world who would meet any visitor on his own favorite\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nRichmond society has always claimed a certain seclusiveness for\r\nitself—not _ex_clusiveness—for nobody properly introduced could visit\r\nRichmond without having a dinner or evening party given in his honor.\r\n\"Taken in?\"—of course the entertainers were sometimes \"taken in\"! That\r\ndid not signify once in a while.\r\n\r\nI remember a portly dame with two showy daughters, always handsomely\r\nattired, who managed, at some watering-place, to find favor in the\r\neyes of one of our citizens and obtained an invitation, which was\r\neagerly accepted, to make him a visit. An evening party was given\r\nto introduce them. I had my doubts after a conversation with Madame\r\nMère—and expressed them, to the disgust of one of my friends.\r\n\"Impossible,\" she said, coolly. After they left, Mr. Price, our leading\r\nmerchant, presented a large bill for female fineries with which he had\r\nunhesitatingly credited Madame, who had departed with her daughters to\r\nparts unknown. It was promptly, and without a grimace, paid by their\r\ndeluded host. I could remember the sweetly apologetic way in which\r\nMadame had told me she feared her \"girls were a bit overdressed for\r\nthe small functions in Richmond. In New York, now! But here, of course,\r\nthere need be no such display as in New York!\"\r\n\r\nNo amusement, except an occasional song from an obliging guest, was\r\nprovided for our evening parties. Conversation and a good supper, with\r\nthe one-and-only Pizzini to the fore—this was inducement enough. Not\r\nquite as spirituelle as Lady Morgan, we required something more than a\r\nlump of sugar to clear the voice. And Pizzini's suppers! His pyramids\r\nof glacé oranges, \"_non pareil_,\" and spun sugar; his ices, his wine\r\njellies, his blanc manges and, ye gods! his terrapin, pickled oysters,\r\nand chicken salad! We assembled not much later than nine, and remained\r\nas long as it pleased us. Sometimes we acted—\"The Honeymoon,\" or some\r\nother little play; Anna Cora Mowatt (Mrs. Ritchie) gave charming\r\ntableaux, with recitations; but usually we talked and talked and\r\ntalked! \"Art of conversation?\" I suspect art has nothing to do with\r\nconversation. When it becomes art, it ceases to be conversation. We did\r\nnot gossip, either. Personalities were quite, quite out of the question.\r\nOur hosts knew to perfection the art of entertaining.\r\n\r\nSometime in the fifties, Charles Astor Bristed wrote his book, entitled,\r\n\"The Upper Ten Thousand of New York.\" It appears the world was waiting\r\nfor some such work. The theme rippled from shore to shore, until within\r\nthe past few years it seems to have expired with the myth of the Four\r\nHundred. N. P. Willis (wasn't he a bit of a snob himself?) caught with\r\navidity the new departure in Mr. Bristed's book, and eternally harped\r\nupon it. From 1852 until the war, and afterward, until the subsidence\r\nof the Four Hundred ripple, we have heard a great deal about classes,\r\nsociety; and finally, American manners came to the fore as a subject of\r\njournalistic interest. \"American manners! Are they improving in grace\r\nor dignity?\" The question was put to a number of men and women whose\r\nexperience and frankness could be relied upon. The answers, except for\r\none, were vague and cautious. Nobody likes to appear as a satirist or\r\ncynic—and yet nobody is willing to acknowledge that he knows nothing\r\nbetter than what appears at present to be the standard of good breeding,\r\nby comparison with the standard twenty or more years ago.\r\n\r\nThe one honest man revealed by the lamp-light of the inquiring editor\r\nremembered the chapter allotted to a contributor in the preparation of\r\n\"a history of Ireland.\" The subject of the chapter was dictated—\"The\r\nSnakes of Ireland\"—and it appeared with that heading. It was brief and\r\nto the point—\"There are no Snakes in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n\"American manners?\" answered the one honest man; \"there aren't any.\"\r\n\r\n\"American manners,\" said George William Curtis, \"where do you find them?\r\nIf high society be the general intercourse of the highest intelligence\r\nwith which we converse,—the festival of Wit and Beauty and Wisdom,—we\r\ndo not find it at Newport. Fine society is a fruit that ripens slowly.\r\nWe Americans fancy we can buy it.\"\r\n\r\nForeigners have never ceased to comment upon American manners. The\r\nsubject in the fifties seems to have been of inexhaustible interest.\r\n\"There's no use,\" said Max O'Rell, \"in forever gazing at the Upper Ten\r\nThousand. They are alike all over the world. It is the million that\r\ndiffer and are interesting.\" Marion Crawford said: \"The Upper Ten can\r\nnever fraternize with artists, poets, and inventors. These take no\r\naccount of wealth or of any position not won by absolute genius or\r\nmerit, treating such position, indeed, with ill-concealed contempt.\"\r\n\r\nThackeray liked to be agreeable to the people who made his lectures\r\nprofitable, but he complains of the \"uncommon splendatiousness\" of\r\nAmericans. \"But I haven't been in Society yet,\" he wrote, in 1852; \"I\r\nhaven't met the Upper Ten.\" Another English writer went farther—much\r\nfarther—but we forbear. Now these harsh judgments were exclusively of\r\nmanners in New York, Newport, and Washington. No Curtis, Bristed, or\r\nWillis ever, to my knowledge, visited Richmond. Thackeray, Max O'Rell,\r\nand Ampère never thought us worth while—so our delightful small society,\r\nwhich had ripened slowly and took no account of wealth, and which\r\ncould really have furnished a modicum of \"Wit, beauty, and Wisdom\"\r\nfor Curtis's \"festival,\" was unrepresented. As to the criticisms of\r\nour elder brother across the water, as long as he sends his sons to\r\nAmerica to find the mothers of the future peers of his realm, the edge\r\nis blunted of his strictures upon American society and manners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliam Walker, the \"Grey-eyed Man of Destiny,\" who was in 1854 more\r\ntalked about than any other man in the country, was our guest for\r\nseveral days in Richmond. Whether he came to accept a dinner given him\r\nby the city, or whether the dinner was the result of the visit, I cannot\r\nremember. Although we knew him to be an interesting character, we were\r\nunprepared for the throng that filled our house every day while he was\r\nwith us. Beginning early in the day, they poured in until night, and\r\nremained, spellbound by the magnetism of this wonderful man. As we could\r\nnot invite them to leave for the three o'clock dinner (the dinner-hour\r\nin Virginia varied then to suit individual convenience), I took counsel\r\nof my blessed old negro cook, and following her advice, I spread a\r\ntable every day with cold dishes,—tongue, ham, chickens, birds, salads,\r\netc.,—to which all were made welcome. The sideboard ably supplemented\r\nthis informal meal. Old Madeira could be had in those days, and in lieu\r\nof the cocktail of the present time, we brewed an appetizer, crowned\r\nwith \"the herb that grows on the grave of good Virginians.\"\r\n\r\nThe Richmond market was insufficient for sudden demands. We depended\r\nlargely upon the small, covered country carts, intercepting them as they\r\npassed on their way to the grocers', who bartered things dry and liquid\r\nfor the farmers' poultry, eggs, and butter. At this time of my distress,\r\nno carts hove in sight, but I knew a grocer with a noble soul,—one Mark\r\nDowney,—to whom I made a personal appeal, and he promised to send me,\r\ndaily, everything he could gather, from a roasting pig to a reed-bird.\r\nMy good cook rose to the occasion: \"Ain't that Gin'al gone yet?\" was\r\nher morning salutation, hastily adding, \"Nem-mine, honey! We-all kin\r\ngit along.\"\r\n\r\nIn some of the biographical sketches of William Walker I find him\r\npainted as little better—in fact, no better—than a pirate; a man of\r\nan unbounded stomach for power and place, regarding as nothing life,\r\nproperty, or his own word, and finally, justly forsaken and punished.\r\nOthers present him to posterity as a scholar, an author, a graduate of\r\ncolleges, a student at Heidelberg, also a hero of the first water, brave\r\nbeyond compare; a maker of republics, statesman, dictator,—in all things\r\nfearless and dashing. When I turn to the storehouse of my own memory, I\r\nfind a modest, courtly gentleman, with a strong but not ungentle face:—\r\n\r\n             \"The mildest mannered man\r\n     That ever scuttled ship or cut a throat.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I could not appear in the crowd that hung upon his lips all\r\nday, but when we gathered around the evening lamp he was never too\r\nweary to talk to me—but not about his conquests nor his ambitions. For\r\na woman's ear he had gentler themes than these.\r\n\r\nOne night I startled my husband by asking, \"What church do you belong\r\nto, General?\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WILLIAM WALKER.]\r\n\r\n\"I have recently become a Catholic,\" he answered gravely; \"it is the\r\nfaith for a man like me! I have seen the poor wounded fellows die with\r\ngreat serenity after the ministration of their priest.\"\r\n\r\nI recall a striking remark by the General to my husband. He said men\r\nare commonly equally courageous, the difference between them being that\r\none man, from keener sensibility, sees a danger of which another is\r\nstolidly insensible. The former is really courageous, while the latter\r\nis indifferent from lack of apprehension. Himself incapable of fear, a\r\nhigher authority on the subject cannot be imagined.\r\n\r\nWhen he took leave of us, he gave me a perfect ambrotype picture of\r\nhimself, probably the only genuine one extant. \"Here I am, Madam,\r\nand I've always been called an ugly fellow.\" I ventured the usual\r\ndeprecatory remark, but he shook his head:—\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid there's no doubt about it! On my way here I heard a man\r\nclose to my car-window sing out, 'Whar's the Gray-eyed Man of Destiny?'\r\nAs he was close to me, I leaned out and said in a low tone, '_Here_,\r\nmy friend!' 'Friend nothin,' he sneered; 'an' you'd better take in your\r\nugly mug.'\"\r\n\r\nHe looked back from the carriage that took him to the depot and answered\r\nmy waving handkerchief: \"Good-by, good-by, dear lady! I'm going to make\r\nNicaragua a nice place, fit for you!\"\r\n\r\nJust as we were about to engage in our own life-and-death struggle, we\r\nheard he had been betrayed, as Napoleon was betrayed, by the English,\r\nto whom, after defeat, he had fled for protection, and had met his death\r\nbravely.\r\n\r\nHis dream had been to win Nicaragua, as Houston had won Texas, and\r\nthen annex it to the United States, thus strengthening the power of the\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nI have been told that many superstitions and legends have sprung up in\r\nNicaragua and Honduras to cluster around the memory of William Walker,\r\nbut in none is there a firmer belief than that his ghost appears on\r\nthe anniversary of his death, and will so appear until he is avenged. A\r\nTennessee boy, William G. Erwin, now helping to superintend the digging\r\nof the Panama Canal, has told the legend, in Senator Taylor's magazine,\r\nfrom which I select a few verses:—\r\n\r\n     _\"One night each year in Honduras, they clear the roads for his\r\n    ghost,\r\n     Their long dead Gringo President—who rides with his phantom host.\r\n     He sweeps o'er the land in silence and the cowering natives hide,\r\n     From the Wraith of William Walker—who haunts the land where he\r\n    died._\r\n\r\n     \"Thus it was the wild tale started—that when dying on the sand,\r\n     Walker smiled and sternly told them, 'Till avenged I'll haunt your\r\n    land!'\r\n     And now on snow-white stallion once a year at midnight's spell,\r\n     Across the land from sea to sea—rides the form that all know well.\r\n\r\n     \"His head is high, his blade is bare, his white steed spurns the\r\n    ground,\r\n     A phantom troop charge close behind—but all make never a sound;\r\n     While his blood cries yet for vengeance against this murderous\r\n    herd—\r\n     He will ever come to warn them, that the day is but deferred.\r\n\r\n     \"To the sons of old Honduras as they view him through the gloom,\r\n     The Gray-eyed Man of Destiny looks the Avatar of Doom;\r\n     In his face they read a warning like the writing on the wall,\r\n     'Tis, '_Beware, one day the Gringos will avenge their chieftain's\r\n    fall!_'\"\r\n\r\nMy husband entered with great zeal and efficiency into the fight against\r\n\"The Know-nothing party,\" or, as they proudly styled themselves, the\r\n\"American party.\"\r\n\r\nThe principles of this party were naturally evolved from the fact that\r\nthe ignorant foreign vote was influencing elections[2] in the cities,\r\nthat votes were freely sold, and that drunken aliens frequently had\r\ncharge of the polls. The mythical order of Washington in a time of\r\npeculiar danger was remembered:\r\n\r\n\"Put none but Americans on guard to-night!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed reasonable and fitting that Americans, who had won this\r\ncountry from the savage, and fought all its early battles with the\r\nFrench and English, should govern the country they had redeemed. One\r\nthing led to another, until it was resolved to form a secret society,\r\nwith the view of excluding all foreigners and many Roman Catholics from\r\nany part in the councils of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis, briefly, seems to have been at the root of the great Know-nothing\r\nmovement. The immediate and practical aim in view was that foreigners\r\nand Catholics should be excluded from all national, state, county, and\r\nmunicipal offices; that strenuous efforts should be made to change the\r\nnaturalization laws, so that the immigrant could not become a citizen\r\nuntil a resident of twenty-one years in this country. My husband at once\r\nperceived the pernicious tendency of the movement, which was sweeping\r\nthe Northern states with resistless force. Secret lodges were formed\r\neverywhere, secret ceremonies inaugurated—grip, passwords, and signs.\r\nThe country was in a ferment of excitement, followed by outrageous\r\nlawlessness. Bands of women made raids on bar-rooms and smashed the\r\nglasses, broke the casks, and poured the liquor into the streets. Our\r\none exemplar of similar enterprises should have lived in those days!\r\nGarrison burned the Constitution of the United States at an open-air\r\nmeeting in Framingham, Massachusetts; and the crowd, in spite of a\r\nfew hisses, shouted \"Amen.\" A mob broke into the enclosure around the\r\nWashington Monument, and broke the beautiful block of marble from the\r\nTemple of Concord at Rome, which had been sent by the pope as a tribute\r\nto Washington. A street preacher, styling himself the Angel Gabriel,\r\nincited a crowd at Chelsea, Massachusetts, to deeds of violence. They\r\nsmashed the windows of the Catholic church, tore the cross from the\r\ngable and shivered it to atoms. These were only a few of the outrages\r\ngrowing out of the excitement engendered by the Know-nothing party.\r\n\r\nThe _Enquirer_ always claimed the credit of unearthing and exposing the\r\nsignals, passwords, and ceremonies of the society. \"I don't know\" was\r\none of the answers to the \"grip\" when brother met brother, and hence the\r\npopular name of the organization. Though Virginia had but few Catholics\r\nand few immigrants, yet, upon principle, she withstood and stayed the\r\nKnow-nothing torrent that had hitherto swept over every other state.\r\n\r\nParty feeling ran high during the election of a Virginia governor,\r\nand the junior editor of the _Enquirer_ bore his part boldly and with\r\nvigor. For the first few years of his editorial life he devoted himself\r\nto study, confining himself closely to his office. A contemporary\r\nwriter says of him: \"Pryor evidently studied the highest standards\r\nin his reading, and his editorials were a revelation of strength and\r\npurity in classic English. It was impossible, however, for a man of his\r\ntastes and force not to drift into politics outside of the sanctum of\r\nhis paper, and the public soon recognized him as one of the ablest and\r\nmost eloquent speakers upon the hustings and in the bitter discussions\r\nthat marked the proceedings of every gathering of the people in those\r\nyears. In the mutterings and threatenings of the storm that was soon\r\nto break in fury upon a hitherto peaceful and peace-loving land, he\r\nfound abundant opportunity for the cultivation and display of those rare\r\npowers of oratory in debate which subsequently forced him to the front\r\nof the forum.\"[3] I can only add to this tribute from a candid historian\r\nof the time one observation—the success was great: the memory of it\r\nsweet, but—it was bought with a price! The stern price of unremitting\r\nlabor and self-abnegation.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible time in Virginia. Henry A. Wise was the\r\nAnti-Know-nothing candidate for governor, and hard and valiant was the\r\nfight my husband made for his election. It involved him in two duels—not\r\nbloodless, but, thank God, not fatal. It is unnecessary to allude to\r\nmy own fearful anxiety. It will be understood by all women who, like\r\nmyself, have been and are sufferers from the false standard demanded\r\nby the \"code of honor,\" in countries where, to ignore it, would mean\r\nruin and disgrace. We were most devoted adherents of Mr. Wise, and\r\nready to go to the death in his defence, standing as he did in the\r\nfront, as we believed, of the battle for right, justice, and humanity.\r\nFinally, he was triumphantly elected, the pestilent society quenched,\r\nand comparative peace for a brief period reigned in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party was grateful for my husband's hard work, and gave\r\nhim a beautiful service of silver, inscribed with the appreciation of\r\nthe party for his \"brilliant talents, eminent worth, and distinguished\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nNot long afterward he became the editor of _The Richmond South_, for\r\nwhich I had the honor to select a motto—\"_Unum et commune periclum una\r\nsalus_.\" Perhaps a pen picture of my \"Harry Hotspur,\" as he was called,\r\nmay amuse those whose kind eyes follow his venerable figure as it passes\r\nto-day. \"The day after our arrival at the Red Sweet Springs we noticed\r\namong a crowd of gentlemen a face which strikingly contrasted with\r\nthe faces around him. He was a slight figure, with a set of features\r\nremarkable for their intellectual cast; a profusion of dark hair falling\r\nfrom his brow in long, straight masses over the collar of his coat gave\r\na student-like air to his whole appearance. We unconsciously rose to our\r\nfeet on hearing his name, and found ourselves in the actual presence of\r\nthe far-famed editor of the _South_ and in such close vicinity, too!\r\nWhy, our awe increased almost to trepidation; we felt as if locked\r\nin a vault full of inflammable gas, likely to explode with the first\r\nlight introduced into it. Indeed, five minutes wore away in preliminary\r\nexplanations before we could be brought to identify the youthful\r\nperson before us—who might pass for a student of divinity or a young\r\nprofessor of moral philosophy—with the fiery and impetuous editor of\r\nthe _Richmond South_. He is, we believe, considered one of the ablest\r\npolitical writers in all the South, and his articles were said to be\r\nhighly influential in the late party controversy. For ourselves we\r\nregard with admiration,\" etc. \"His young family cannot fail to create\r\nan immediate interest in the eyes of the most casual observer.... And\r\nthen his beautiful, noble-looking children; they might serve as models\r\nfor infant Apollos, such as Thorwaldsen or Flaxman might have prayed\r\nfor.\"\r\n\r\nThey _were_ lovely—my boys—my three little boys!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nA bit of paper, yellow and crumbling from age, has recently been sent\r\nto me by the son of an old Charlottesville friend. The tiny scrap has\r\nsurvived the vicissitudes of fifty-one years, and because of the changes\r\nit has seen and the dangers it has passed, if for nothing more, it\r\ndeserves preservation. It marks an important era in our life, although\r\nit contains only this:—\r\n\r\n                                    \"CHARLOTTESVILLE, July 1, 1858.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR MRS. COCHRAN:—\r\n\r\n     \"May I have your receipt for brandy-peaches? You know Roger\r\n     is speaking all over the country, trying to win votes for a\r\n     seat in Congress. I'm not sure he will be elected—but I _am_\r\n     sure he will like some brandy-peaches! If he is successful,\r\n     they will enhance the glory of victory—if he is defeated, they\r\n     will help to console him.\r\n\r\n                                                \"Affectionately,\r\n                                                      \"S. A. PRYOR.\"\r\n\r\nIn this campaign my husband established his reputation as an orator. He\r\nwas canvassing the district of his kinsman, John Randolph of Roanoke,\r\nand old men who heard his speeches did not hesitate to declare him the\r\nequal of the eccentric but eloquent Randolph. I always like to quote\r\ndirectly from the journals of the day,—I like my countrymen to tell my\r\nstory,—and happily, although I lost all memoranda, some old men have\r\nwritten since the war of the noted Virginians whom they knew in the\r\nfifties. One from a North Carolina paper I have preserved, but lost the\r\nprecise date.\r\n\r\n\"The late Rev. Thos. G. Lowe, of Halifax, was the greatest natural\r\norator North Carolina ever produced. He was silver-tongued and\r\ngolden-mouthed, a cross between Chrysostom and Fénelon. He was, besides,\r\na very earnest Whig in his politics. On one occasion, in 1860, we knew\r\nhim to go from Halifax to Henderson, a distance of some sixty miles,\r\nto hear Pryor speak. We asked him what he thought of the Virginian.\r\nHis reply was, 'You think I didn't stand up in a hot sun three mortal\r\nhours just to hear him abuse my party? He is wonderful, with the finest\r\nvocabulary I have ever known.' Charles Bruce, Esq., of Charlotte,\r\nVirginia, told us, in 1870, that when Pryor spoke at Charlotte Court\r\nHouse, he saw elderly gentlemen who had ridden forty miles in their\r\ncarriages to hear him, and who said to each other, after the great\r\norator had concluded his masterly effort, 'We have had no such speaking\r\nin Virginia since John Randolph's day.'\"\r\n\r\nAnother from the old district writes, July 9, 1891:—\r\n\r\n     \"Of all the men I ever heard speak, Pryor made the strongest\r\n     impression on me. Young, enthusiastic, brilliant; with a\r\n     not unbecoming faith in a capacity of high order, he might\r\n     reasonably have aspired to the loftiest dignities. He was a\r\n     born orator; thorough master of those rare persuasive powers\r\n     that captivate and lead multitudes. His figure was erect\r\n     and finely proportioned, his gestures easy and graceful, his\r\n     features mobile and expressive of every shade of emotion. But\r\n     the charm of his oratory lay in his wonderfully organized\r\n     vocal apparatus, which he played upon with the skill of a\r\n     musical expert. No speaker of the present time can claim to\r\n     rival him in the easy flow of rhetoric that sparkled through\r\n     his harmoniously balanced periods, except, probably, Senator\r\n     Daniel. While listening to him, the Richard Henry Lee of\r\n     Wirt's graphic portraiture seemed to move and speak in every\r\n     tone and gesture.\"\r\n\r\nAnother for the _Richmond Times-Democrat_ of November 2, 1902, writes:—\r\n\r\n     \"A famous orator of the antebellum period was Roger A. Pryor,\r\n     who still survives. He had a poetic imagination, which is the\r\n     basis of all true oratory. His vocabulary, though florid,\r\n     was superb, and kept company with the airy creatures of\r\n     his exuberant imagination. He rarely spoke but to evolve a\r\n     beautiful figure, and in his political campaigns for Congress,\r\n     in the now Fourth Virginia district, he frequently soared\r\n     above the comprehension of his audience, whose reading was\r\n     limited. He combined a logical mind with his poetic fancy,\r\n     and the effect and product of his thought were striking and\r\n     impressive, illustrating the aphorism that the poet always\r\n     sees most deeply into human nature. Pryor had the face, the\r\n     figure, the dramatic air, the attitude, and the vocabulary.\r\n     When we saw him last summer at the White Sulphur, he looked\r\n     the grave and dignified jurist, in contrast with the typical\r\n     politician and editor of the fire-eating school of fifty years\r\n     ago.\"\r\n\r\nWhile all these fine speeches were delighting our Democratic friends, I\r\nwas very happy with my dear aunt at her country place, Rock Hill, near\r\nCharlottesville. There my dear son Roger was born—now my only son. The\r\nhouse, like a small Swiss chalet, was perched lightly on the side of an\r\nelevation that well deserved its name. From the crest of the hill there\r\nwas a noble view of the Blue Mountains, and of sunsets indescribable.\r\nTo the little boy and girl who spent their childhood at this place it\r\nsoon became enchanted ground. A quarry, from which stone had been taken\r\nfor building the house, was the cave of Bunyan's giants, Pope and Pagan,\r\nwho \"hailed the Christians as they passed, saying, 'Turn in hither'\";\r\ntwo crayfish that lived in the great spring under the Druidical oaks\r\nwere the genii of the fountain; the corn-field was a mighty forest to\r\nbe entered with fear because of the Indians and wild beasts therein.\r\n\r\nThese two children, Gordon and her brother, Theodorick, fourteen months\r\nyounger, were blessed in having my own dear aunt's care and teaching\r\nfrom their infancy until they were aged respectively nine and ten years.\r\nThey were not at first \"remarkable\" children. They were not infant\r\nphenomena, subjected to the perilous applause of admiring friends and\r\nkindred. They were normal in every respect—clean-blooded, sturdy, and\r\nwholesome; with good appetites, cool heads, and quick perceptions. They\r\nbecame, under the care of their wise preceptor, unusually interesting\r\nand intelligent children. My aunt adored the children, firmly believing\r\nthat, however degeneracy might have impaired the human race in its\r\nprogress of evolution,—these two at least had been made in God's\r\nimage. In the words of their nurse, she \"tuned them as if they were\r\nlittle harps—just to see how sweet the music could be!\" They studied\r\ntogether—Gordon understanding that she must encourage the little\r\nbrother, and read to him until he could read himself. In summer the\r\nschoolroom was sometimes _al fresco_, even drawing upon the knotted\r\nbranches of the cherry tree for desks!\r\n\r\nGordon read very well at the age of three. She was also taught, before\r\nshe could read, to point out rivers and cities on a map. Before he was\r\nfour, Theodorick could read also. The children never had a distasteful\r\ntask. I heard a great scholar say that _all_ learning could be made\r\ncharming to a young mind. The aunt of these children made their lessons\r\na reward. \"Now be good when you dress, and you may have a lesson,\"\r\nor \"if Gordon and Theo don't ask for anything, I will give them a\r\nlesson right after dinner.\" The lessons, through the teacher's skill\r\nand patience, were made delightful. At once they were given paper and\r\npencils, colored and plain, and both wrote before they were five. Their\r\nteacher disapproved of gory tales of giants and hobgoblins. Instead of\r\nthese, they had histories quite as thrilling, and stories of the animal\r\nkingdom, with which they lived in perfect amity and kinship. They never\r\nhad caged birds, but ducks and chickens, dogs small and great, cats and\r\nkittens, were all regarded as part of the family, and bore historic\r\nnames. Theo once picked up (he was three) a small chicken, whereupon\r\nthe mother hen rose to his shoulders and administered a good spanking\r\nwith her wings. A servant, with great heat, belabored the hen; and Theo\r\nchecked his sobs to entreat for her, explaining, \"she didn't like for\r\nme to love her little white chicken.\" The hen, forsooth, was jealous!\r\nHe once caught a bee in his hand and received a stinging rebuke. \"How\r\ncould you be so silly?\" exclaimed his little sister. \"Not at all,\" said\r\nTheo; \"I have often done the same thing—but this little fellow,\" he\r\nadded affectionately, \"this little fellow had a brier in _his_ tail!\"\r\n\r\nTheir aunt hesitated whether she should tell them harrowing stories\r\nfrom history, but experiment proved, however, that the heroic held for\r\nthem such fascination that they lost sight completely of the pain or\r\nsuffering attending it. They adored the men and women who died bravely,\r\nbut had their favorites. Lady Jane Grey was not one, nor Mary Queen\r\nof Scots (perhaps because of their ruffs), but they worshipped Marie\r\nAntoinette and Charles I. They had a very high regard for honor and fair\r\ndealing. Theo was a little over three years when he complained to me of\r\nhis little sister, \"I just laid my head on the stool and let her chop it\r\noff—because I am Charles I—and now _she_ is Marie Antoinette, and when\r\nI am ready to cut off her head, she screams and runs away.\" His sense\r\nof justice was outraged, but the little sister's vivid imagination made\r\nher nervous, notwithstanding the fact that a cushion was the guillotine!\r\nHaving observed that a large knotted stick was treated with respect,\r\nand travelled, to my inconvenience, with Theo on several journeys, I\r\nessayed to throw it away. With great dignity he gravely informed me,\r\n\"This is Rameses III.\" Not only was it one of the Egyptian kings, but\r\nthe richest of them all. I wish I could follow these two fascinating\r\nchildren beyond their babyhood, but I cannot venture! I dare not!\r\n\r\nLate in the autumn I left Rock Hill to visit my uncle at the Oaks in\r\nCharlotte. I had travelled alone from Richmond to Mossingford, ten or\r\ntwelve miles from my uncle's house, and there old Uncle Peter met me\r\nwith the great high-swung chariot and a hamper well filled with broiled\r\npartridges, biscuits, cakes, and fruit. The rain had poured a steady\r\nflood for several days, but to my joy the clouds were now rolling away\r\nin heavy masses, and the sun shining hotly on the water-soaked earth.\r\n\r\n\"We got to hurry, Mistis,\" said the old coachman, as we prepared to\r\nenjoy an _al fresco_ luncheon; \"the cricks was risin' mighty fas' when\r\nI come along fo' sun-up dis mornin'.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we don't have to cross the river, Uncle Peter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gawd A'mighty, no,\" exclaimed the old man. \"Ef'n I had to cross\r\nStaunton River, I'd done give clean up, fo' I see you! When we git\r\nhome, we'll fine out what ole Staunton River doin'. I lay she's jes'\r\na'bilin'!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then there is some danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who talkin' 'bout danger? De kerridge sets mighty high. No'm, der ain't\r\nno danger, but I ain't trustin' dem cricks. I knows cricks! Dee kin\r\nswell deeself up as big's a river in no time!\"\r\n\r\nWe had not gone far before we were overtaken by a mud-splashed horseman,\r\nwho arrested our horses and spoke in a low tone to the driver. Presently\r\nhe appeared at the carriage window. \"This is Mrs. Pryor? You remember\r\nMr. Carrington? I hope I see you well, Madam. I am on my way to vote for\r\nyour husband—or rather, help elect him. We have a fine day; the polls\r\nneed not be kept open to-morrow. But I must hasten on. We will soon have\r\nthe pleasure of congratulating our congressman.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment, please, Mr. Carrington! Are the creeks too high for us to\r\ncross?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not, Madam. The carriage hangs high, and Peter knows all about\r\nfreshets. Good morning.\"\r\n\r\nThere were swollen streams for us to cross. Several of them had\r\noverflowed the meadows until they looked like lakes. At one or two the\r\nwater flowed over the floor of the carriage, and we gathered our feet\r\nunder us on the seats. My little Theo enjoyed it, but my poor nurse was\r\nashen from terror. Very wet, very cold, and very grateful were we when\r\nat night we reached our haven. My dear uncle, Dr. Rice, was already\r\nthere, with cheering news from the polls.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we looked out upon a turbid yellow sea. The Staunton\r\nhad sustained her reputation, overflowed her low banks, and spread\r\nherself generously over the face of the earth. It was a week or more\r\nbefore my husband was assured of his election. He spent the intervening\r\ndays of rest sleeping—like the boy he was!\r\n\r\nSeveral years later, when he was reëlected, we were in Richmond with\r\nmy little family. Gordon and the two little boys were keen politicians.\r\nOf course I was now too busy a mother to concern myself with politics,\r\nas was my wont in the earlier days. Moreover, I knew my congressman\r\nwould be reëlected. I was pretty sure by this time that he would always\r\nbe elected—so the day passed serenely with me. I was overwhelmed with\r\ndismay when one of his friends called after the polls closed at sunset,\r\nand informed me that a torch-light procession would reach our house\r\nabout eight o'clock, and would expect to find it illuminated.\r\n\r\n\"Illuminated!\" I exclaimed. \"And pray with what? There are not half a\r\ndozen candles in the house, and the stores are all closed. Besides, the\r\nbaby will be asleep. It is bad for babies to be waked out of their first\r\nsleep.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend did not contradict me, but in the evening he sent a bushel\r\nof small turnips and a box of candles, with a note telling me to cut a\r\nhole in the turnips, insert a candle, and they would answer my purpose\r\nadmirably. Everybody went to work with a will, and when the crowd,\r\nshouting and cheering, surrounded us, every window-pane blazed a welcome\r\ninto the happy faces. My young congressman made one of his charming\r\nspeeches, and then—the lights went out on the last election he was\r\ndestined to celebrate! True, he was twice after elected to Congress—in\r\nthe Confederate States; for the South had need of him in her legislative\r\nhall as well as in the field. In both he gave her all his heart and soul\r\nand strength, but the days were too sad for illuminations in his honor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy story has now reached the period at which my \"Reminiscences of\r\nPeace and War\" begin. I shall not relate the political history of the\r\nperiod—which has been better told by others than I can hope to tell\r\nit. I shall endeavor to bring forward some things that were omitted\r\nin my late book, but in narrating the incidents of the Civil War and\r\nthe preceding life in Washington, I may in some measure repeat myself.\r\nFor this I have a valid excuse. Apologizing for quoting himself from\r\na former book on Edmund Burke, John Morley remarks: \"Though you may\r\nsay what you have to say well _once_, you cannot so say it _twice_.\"\r\nLord Morley strengthens his position by a quotation in Greek, which,\r\nunhappily, remains Greek to me, and I therefore cannot avail myself of\r\nits help, but I am glad to be sustained by his example. Besides, what\r\nsays Oliver Wendell Holmes? \"It is the height of conceit for an author\r\nto be afraid of repeating himself—because it implies that everybody has\r\nread—and remembers—what he has said before.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington was like a great village in the days of President Pierce and\r\nPresident Buchanan. My own pride in the federal city was such that my\r\nheart would swell within me at every glimpse of the Capitol: from the\r\nmoment it rose like a white cloud above the smoke and mists, as I stood\r\non the deck of the steamboat (having run up from my dinner to salute\r\nMount Vernon), to the time when I was wont to watch from my window for\r\nthe sunset, that I might catch the moment when a point on the unfinished\r\ndome glowed like a great blazing star after the sun had really gone\r\ndown. No matter whether suns rose or set, there was the star of our\r\ncountry,—the star of our hearts and hopes.\r\n\r\nWhen our friends came up from Virginia to make us visits, it was\r\ndelightful to take a carriage and give up days to sight-seeing; to visit\r\nthe White House and Capitol, the Patent Office, with its miscellaneous\r\ntreasures; to point with pride to the rich gifts from crowned heads\r\nwhich our adored first President was too conscientious to accept; to\r\nwalk among the stones lying around the base of the unfinished monument\r\nand read the inscriptions from the states presenting them; to spend a\r\nday at the Smithsonian Institution, and to introduce our friends to its\r\npresident, Mr. Henry; and to Mr. Spenser Baird and Mr. George, who were\r\ngiving their lives to the study of birds, beasts, and fishes,—finding\r\nthem, as Mr. George still contended, \"so much more interesting than\r\nmen,\" adding hastily, \"We do not say ladies,\" and blushing after the\r\nmanner of cloistered scholars; to hint of interesting things about\r\nMr. George, who was a melancholy young man, and who had, as we know,\r\nsustained a great sorrow.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WASHINGTON IN 1845.]\r\n\r\nThen the visits to the galleries of the House and Senate Chamber,\r\nand the honor of pointing out the great men to our friends from rural\r\ndistricts; the long listening to interminable speeches, not clearly\r\nunderstood, but heard with a reverent conviction that all was coming out\r\nright in the end, that everybody was really working for the good of his\r\ncountry, and that we belonged to it all and were parts of it all.\r\n\r\nThis was the thought behind all other thoughts which glorified\r\neverything around us, enhanced every fortunate circumstance, and caused\r\nus to ignore the real discomforts of life in Washington: the cold,\r\nthe ice-laden streets in winter; the whirlwinds of dust and driving\r\nrains of spring; the swift-coming fierceness of summer heat; the rapid\r\natmospheric changes which would give us all these extremes in one week,\r\nor even one day, until it became the part of prudence never to sally\r\nforth on any expedition without \"a fan, an overcoat, and an umbrella.\"\r\n\r\nThe social life in Washington was almost as variable as the climate.\r\nAt the end of every four years the kaleidoscope turned, and lo!—a new\r\ncentral jewel and new colors and combinations in the setting.\r\n\r\nBut behind this \"floating population,\" as the political circles were\r\ntermed, there was a fine society in the fifties of \"old residents\" who\r\nheld themselves apart from the motley crowd of office-seekers. This\r\nsociety was sufficient to itself, never seeking the new, while accepting\r\nit occasionally with discretion, reservations, and much discriminating\r\ncare. The sisters, Mrs. Gales and Mrs. Seaton, wives of the editors\r\nof the _National Intelligencer_, led this society. Mrs. Gales's home\r\nwas outside the city, and thence every day Mr. Gales was driven in his\r\nbarouche to his office. His paper was the exponent of the Old Line Whigs\r\n(the Republican party was formed later), and in stern opposition to\r\nthe Democrats. It was, therefore, a special and unexpected honor for a\r\nDemocrat to be permitted to drive out to \"the cottage\" for a glass of\r\nwine and a bit of fruit-cake with Mrs. Gales and Mrs. Seaton. Never have\r\nI seen these gentlewomen excelled in genial hospitality. Mrs. Gales was\r\na handsome woman and a fine conversationalist. She had the courteous\r\nrepose born of dignity and intelligence and a certain reticence which\r\nmakes for distinction. She was literally her husband's right hand,—he\r\nhad lost his own,—and was the only person who could decipher his\r\nleft-hand writing. So that when anything appeared from his pen it\r\nhad been copied by his wife before it reached the type-setter. A fine\r\neducation this for an intelligent woman; the very best schooling for\r\na social life including diplomats from foreign countries, politicians\r\nof diverse opinions, artists, authors, musicians, women of fashion,\r\nto entertain whom required infinite tact, cleverness, and an intimate\r\nacquaintance with the absorbing questions of the day.\r\n\r\nOf course the levees and state receptions, which were accessible to all,\r\nrequired none of these things. The rôle of hostess on state occasions\r\ncould be filled creditably by any woman of ordinary physical strength,\r\npatience, self-control, who knew when to be silent.\r\n\r\nWashington society, at the time of which I write, was comparatively\r\nfree from non-official men of wealth from other cities who, weary with\r\nthe monotonous round of travel,—to the Riviera, to Egypt, to Monte\r\nCarlo,—are attracted by the unique atmosphere of a city holding many\r\nforeigners, and devoted not to commercial but to social and political\r\ninterests. The doors of the White House and Cabinet offices being open\r\non occasions to all, they have opportunities denied them in their own\r\nhomes. Society in Washington in the fifties was peculiarly interesting\r\nin that it was composed exclusively of men whose presence argued them to\r\nhave been of importance at home. They had been elected by the people,\r\nor chosen by the President, or selected among the very best in foreign\r\ncountries, or they belonged to the United States Army or Navy service,\r\nor to the descendants of the select society which had gathered in the\r\ncity early in its history.[4]\r\n\r\nAs I had come to Washington from Virginia, where everybody's\r\ngreat-grandfather knew my great-grandfather, where the rules of\r\netiquette were only those of courtesy and good breeding, I had many a\r\ntroubled moment in my early Washington life, lest I should transgress\r\nsome law of precedence, etc. I wisely took counsel with one of my\r\n\"old residents,\" and she gave me a few simple rules whereby the young\r\nchaperon of a very young girl might be guided: \"My dear,\" said this\r\nlady, \"my dear, you know you cannot always have your husband to attend\r\nyou. It will be altogether proper for you to go with your sister to\r\nmorning and afternoon receptions. When you arrive, send for the host or\r\nthe master of ceremonies, and he will take you in and present you. Of\r\ncourse, your husband will take you to balls; if he is busy, you simply\r\ncannot go! I think you would do well to make a rule _never_, under any\r\ncircumstances, to drive in men's carriages. There are so many foreigners\r\nhere, you must be careful. They never bring their own court manners to\r\nWashington. They take their cue from the people they meet. If you are\r\nhigh and haughty, they will be high and haughty. If you are genially\r\ncivil but reserved, they will be so. If you talk personalities in a free\r\nand easy way, they will spring some audacious piece of scandal on you,\r\nand the Lord only knows where they'll end.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it so happened that I had just received a request from a Frenchman\r\nwho had brought letters to be allowed to escort Madame and Mademoiselle\r\nto a fête in Georgetown. We were to drive through the avenue of\r\nblossoming crab-apples, and rendezvous at a spring for a picnic. I\r\nforget the name of our hostess, but she had arranged a gay festival,\r\nincluding music and dancing on the green. I had accepted this invitation\r\nand the escort of M. Raoul, and received a note from him asking at what\r\nhour he should have the honor, etc., and I immediately ran home and\r\nwrote that \"Madame would be happy to see M. Raoul _à trois heures_\"—and\r\nthat Madame asked the privilege of using her own horses, etc. I made\r\nhaste to engage an open carriage, and congratulated myself on my clever\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was delicious. Monsieur appeared on the moment, and\r\nwe waited for my carriage. The gay equipages of other members of the\r\nparty drove up and waited for us. Presently, rattling down the street,\r\ncame an old ramshackle \"night-hawk,\" bearing the mud-and-dust scars\r\nof many journeys, the seats ragged and tarnished, raw-boned horses\r\nwith rat-eaten manes and tails, harness tied with rope,—the only\r\nredeeming feature the old negro on the box, who, despite his humiliating\r\n_entourage_, had the air of a gentleman.\r\n\r\nWhat could I do? There was nothing to be done!\r\n\r\nMonsieur handed me in without moving a muscle of his face, handed in\r\nmy sister, entered himself, and spoke no word during the drive. He\r\nconducted us gravely to the place of rendezvous, silently and gravely\r\nwalked around the grounds with us, silently and gravely brought us home\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nI grew hot and cold by turns, and almost shed tears of mortification. I\r\nmade no apology—what could I say? Arriving at my own door, I turned and\r\ninvited my escort to enter. He raised his hat, and with an air of the\r\ndeepest dejection, dashed with something very like sarcastic humility,\r\nsaid he trusted Madame had enjoyed the afternoon,—thanked her for the\r\nhonor done himself,—and only regretted the disappointment of the French\r\nMinister, the Count de Sartiges, at not having been allowed to serve\r\nMadame with his own state coach, which had been placed at his disposal\r\nfor Madame's pleasure!\r\n\r\nAs he turned away, my chagrin was such I came very near forgetting to\r\ngive my coachman his little \"tip.\"\r\n\r\nI began, \"Oh, Uncle, how _could_ you?\" when he interrupted: \"Now Mistis,\r\ndon't you say nothin'; I knowed dis ole fune'al hack warn't fittin' for\r\nyou, but der warn't nar another kerridge in de stable. De boss say, 'Go\r\n'long, Jerry, an' git er dar!'—an' I done done it! An' I done fotch 'er\r\nback, too!\"\r\n\r\nI never saw M. Raoul afterward. There's no use crying over spilt\r\nmilk, or broken eggs, or French monsieurs, or even French counts and\r\nministers. I soon left for Virginia, and to be relieved of the dread of\r\nmeeting M. Raoul softened my regret at leaving Washington.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I cannot, at length, describe the brilliant society of\r\nWashington during the few years preceding the Civil War. I have done\r\nthis elsewhere, and need not repeat it here. But for the anxieties\r\nengendered by the exciting questions of the day, my own happiness would\r\nhave been complete. I found and made many friends. My husband was\r\nappreciated, my children healthy and good, my home delightful. Many\r\nof the brilliant men and women assembled in Washington were known to\r\nme more or less intimately, and everybody was kind to me. President\r\nBuchanan early noticed and invited me. \"The President,\" said Mr. Dudley\r\nMann, \"admires your husband and wonders why you were not at the levee.\r\nHe has asked me to see that you come to the next one.\" I once ventured\r\nto send him a Virginia ham, with directions for cooking it. It was to\r\nbe soaked overnight, gently boiled three or four hours, suffered to get\r\ncold in its own juices, and then toasted. This would seem simple enough,\r\nbut the executive cook disdained it, perhaps for the reason that it was\r\nso simple. The dish, a shapeless, jelly-like mass, was placed before\r\nthe President. He took his knife and fork in hand to honor the dish by\r\ncarving it himself, looked at it helplessly, and called out, \"Take it\r\naway! Take it away! Oh, Miss Harriet! You are a poor housekeeper! Not\r\neven a Virginia lady can teach you.\"\r\n\r\nThe glass dishes of the épergne contained wonderful \"French\r\nkisses\"—two-inch squares of crystallized sugar wrapped in silver paper,\r\nand elaborately decorated with lace and artificial flowers. I was\r\nvery proud at one dinner when the President said to me, \"Madam, I am\r\nsending you a souvenir for your little daughter,\" and a waiter handed\r\nme one of those gorgeous affairs. He had questioned me about my boys,\r\nand I had told him of my daughter Gordon, eight years old, who lived\r\nwith her grandmother. \"You must bring her to see Miss Harriet,\" he had\r\nsaid—which, in due season, I did; an event, with its crowning glory of a\r\nchecked silk dress, white hat and feather, which she proudly remembers\r\nto this day. Having been duly presented at court, the little lady\r\nwas much \"in society,\" and accompanied me to many brilliant afternoon\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nShe was a thoughtful listener to the talk in her father's library, and\r\nonce, when an old politician spoke sadly of a possible rupture of the\r\nUnited States, surprised and delighted him by slipping her hand in his\r\nand saying, \"Never mind! _United_ will spell _Untied_ just as well\"—a\r\nlittle _mot_ which was remembered and repeated long afterward.\r\n\r\nAn interesting time was the arrival in Washington of the first Japanese\r\nEmbassy that visited this country. All Washington was crazy over the\r\nevent. I have told elsewhere of my own childish behavior upon that\r\noccasion—when, not having much of a head to speak of, I lost the\r\nlittle I had. Having already cared for the health of my soul by honest\r\nconfession, I need not repeat it here. I was nervous lest the Japanese\r\ndignitaries should recognize me as the effusive lady who had met them\r\n_en route_, but I carefully avoided wearing in their presence the bonnet\r\nand gown they had seen, and if they remembered they gave no sign.\r\n\r\nWashington lost _its_ head! There was something ridiculous in the way\r\nit behaved. So many fêtes were given to the Japanese, so many dinners,\r\nso many receptions, we were worn out attending them. \"I don't know what\r\nwe have come here for,\" said one senator to another; \"there's nothing\r\nwhatever done at the House.\" \"_I_ know,\" his friend replied; \"we came\r\nhere to wait on the Japanese at table.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of one of the balls given them I had seated myself at the\r\ndoor of an anteroom, while my husband was struggling for his carriage\r\nin the street. Across the room Miss Lane, with her party, also waited.\r\nA young man whom I had seen in society, but whose name I had not heard,\r\napproached me, and commenced a harangue of tender sympathy for my\r\nneglected position,—so young, so fair, so innocent! Oh, where, where\r\nwas the miscreant who should protect me? Why, why could I not have been\r\ngiven to one who could have appreciated me—whose life and soul would\r\nhave been mine, and more in the same strain. I did not, in accordance\r\nwith stage proprieties, exclaim, \"Unhand me, villain!\" At first I\r\naffected not to hear, but finally rose, crossed the room, and joined\r\nMiss Lane. She had not heard, and I did not deem the incident, although\r\nnovel and most annoying, important enough for inquiry. I did not know\r\nhim, there was no need for investigation—no call for pistols and coffee.\r\n\r\nA few days after I saw him again at the Baron de Limbourg's\r\ngarden-party. I had joined with Lord Lyons and the Prince de Joinville\r\nin the toast to Miss Lane, pledged in the famous thousand-dollar-a-drop\r\n\"Rose\" wine, and was again in the foyer waiting for my carriage when my\r\nwould-be champion again approached me. \"Mrs. Pryor,\" he said in calm,\r\nmeasured tones, \"I am Lieutenant —. I feel perfectly sure you will grant\r\nmy request. Take my arm and go with me to speak to Miss Lane.\"\r\n\r\nI instantly divined his intention. Walking up to Miss Harriet, he said\r\npenitently: \"Miss Lane, you witnessed my intrusion upon Mrs. Pryor the\r\nother evening and her exquisite forbearance. In your presence I humbly\r\nbeg her pardon.\" He had, poor fellow, found General Cass's wines too\r\npotent for him. He had \"lost his head\"—that was all. I knew somebody\r\nwhose head had been by no means a sure fixture without the excuse of\r\nGeneral Cass's fine wines. Dear Miss Lane, so thoroughly equipped for\r\nher high position by her residence at the court of St. James, had only\r\nkindness then and ever for the wife of the young Virginia congressman.\r\nYears afterward, when both our heads were gray, we talked together of\r\nthese amusing little events in our Washington life.\r\n\r\nMemory lingers upon the delightful friends who made my Washington life\r\nbeautiful: Miss Lane, Mrs. Douglas, Lady Napier, Mrs. Horace Clarke\r\n(_née_ Vanderbilt), lovely Mrs. Cyrus H. M'Cormick, Mrs. Yulee, the\r\nRitchies, the Masons, Secretary Cass's family, Mrs. Canfield, Mrs.\r\nLedyard, and my prime favorite, Lizzie Ledyard. Ah! they were charming\r\nand kind! Even after social lines were strictly drawn between North\r\nand South, I had the good fortune to retain my Northern friends. All\r\nthis I love to remember and would enjoy writing all over again, were\r\nit possible _twice_ to give time to social records. Nor can I pause\r\nto do more than hint at the spirit of the Thirty-sixth Congress, the\r\nstruggles, vituperation, intemperate speech, honest efforts of the wise\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThe nomination of Lincoln and Hamlin on a purely sectional platform\r\naroused such excitement all over the land that the Senate and House\r\nof Representatives gave themselves entirely to speeches on the state\r\nof the country. Read at this late day, many of them appear to be the\r\nhigh utterances of patriots, pleading with each other for forbearance.\r\nOthers exhausted the vocabulary of coarse vituperation. \"Nigger thief,\"\r\n\"slave-driver\" were not uncommon words. Others still, although less\r\nunrefined, were not less abusive. Newspapers no longer reported a speech\r\nas calm, convincing, logical, or eloquent—these were tame expressions.\r\nThe terms now in use were: \"a torrent of scathing denunciation,\"\r\n\"withering sarcasm,\" \"crushing invective,\" the orator's eyes the\r\nwhile \"blazing with scorn and indignation.\" Young members ignored the\r\nsalutation of old senators. Mr. Seward's smile after such a rebuff was\r\nmaddening! No opportunity for scornful allusion was lost. My husband was\r\nprobably the first congressman to wear \"the gray,\" a suit of domestic\r\ncloth having been presented to him by his constituents. Immediately\r\na Northern member said, in an address on the state of the country,\r\n\"Virginia, instead of clothing herself in sheep's wool, had better don\r\nher appropriate garb of sackcloth and ashes.\" In pathetic contrast to\r\nthese scenes were the rosy, cherubic little pages, in white blouses\r\nand cambric collars, who flitted to and fro, bearing, with smiling\r\nfaces, dynamic notes and messages from one representative to another.\r\nThey represented the future which these gentlemen were engaged in\r\nwrecking—for many of these boys were sons of Southern widows, who even\r\nnow, under the most genial skies, led lives of anxiety and struggle.\r\nThoroughly alarmed, the women of Washington thronged the galleries\r\nof the House and the Senate-chamber. From morning until the hour of\r\nadjournment we would sit spellbound, as one after another drew the lurid\r\npicture of disunion and war.\r\n\r\nWhen my husband's time came to speak on \"the state of the country,\" he\r\nentreated for a pacific settlement of our controversy. \"War,\" he urged,\r\n\"war means widows and orphans.\" The temper of the speech was all for\r\npeace. He made a noble appeal to the North for concession. He prophesied\r\n(the dreamer) that the South could never be subdued by resort to arms!\r\nMy Northern friends were prompt to congratulate me upon his speech\r\non \"the state of the country,\" and to praise it with generous words\r\nas \"calm, free from vituperation, eloquent in pleading for peace and\r\nforbearance.\"\r\n\r\nThe evening after this speech was delivered we were sitting in the\r\nlibrary, on the first floor of our home, when there was a ring at\r\nthe door-bell. The servants were in a distant part of the house, and\r\nsuch was our excited state that I ran to the door and answered the\r\nbell myself. It was snowing fast, a carriage stood at the door, and\r\nout of it bundled a mass of shawls and woollen scarfs. On entering,\r\na man-servant commenced unwinding the bundle, which proved to be the\r\nSecretary of State, General Cass! We knew not what to think. He was\r\nseventy-seven years old. Every night at nine o'clock it was the custom\r\nof his daughter, Mrs. Canfield, to wrap him in flannels and put him\r\nto bed. What had brought him out at midnight? As soon as he entered,\r\nbefore sitting down, he exclaimed: \"Mr. Pryor, I have been hearing\r\nabout secession for a long time—and I would not listen. But now I am\r\nfrightened, sir, I am frightened! Your speech in the House to-day gives\r\nme some hope. Mr. Pryor! I crossed the Ohio when I was sixteen years\r\nold with but a pittance in my pocket, and this glorious Union has made\r\nme what I am. I have risen from my bed, sir, to implore you to do what\r\nyou can to avert the disasters which threaten our country with ruin.\"\r\n\r\nWe had this solemn warning to report to our Southern friends who\r\nassembled many an evening in our library: R. M. T. Hunter, Muscoe\r\nGarnett, Porcher Miles, L. Q. C. Lamar, Boyce, Barksdale of Mississippi,\r\nKeitt of South Carolina, with perhaps some visitors from the South. Then\r\nSusan would light her fires and show us the kind of oysters that could\r\nplease her \"own white folks,\" and James would bring in lemons and hot\r\nwater, with some choice brand of old Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThese were not convivial gatherings. These men held troubled\r\nconsultations on the state of the country,—the real meaning and intent\r\nof the North, the half-trusted scheme of Judge Douglas to allow the\r\nterritories to settle for themselves the vexed question of slavery\r\nwithin their borders, the right of peaceable secession. The dawn would\r\nfind them again and again with but one conclusion,—they would stand\r\ntogether: \"_Unum et commune periclum una salus!_\"\r\n\r\nBut Holbein's spectre was already behind the door, and had marked his\r\nmen! In a few months the swift bullet for one enthusiast; for another\r\n(the least considered of them all), a glorious death on the walls of\r\na hard-won rampart—he the first to raise his colors and the shout of\r\nvictory; for only one, or two, or three, that doubtful boon of existence\r\nafter the struggle was all over; for _all_ survivors, memories that\r\nmade the next four years seem to be the sum of life,—the only real\r\nlife,—beside which the coming years would be but a troubled dream.\r\n\r\nThe long session did not close until June, and in the preceding month\r\nAbraham Lincoln was chosen candidate by the Republican party for the\r\npresidency. Stephen A. Douglas was the candidate of the Democrats.\r\nThe South and the \"Old Line Whigs\" also named their men. The words\r\n\"irrepressible conflict\" were much used during the ensuing campaign.\r\n\r\nThe authorship of these words has always been credited to Mr. Seward.\r\nTheir true origin may be found in the address of Mr. Lincoln, delivered\r\nat Cincinnati, Ohio, in September, 1859. On page 262 of the volume\r\npublished by Follett, Foster, and Company in 1860, entitled \"Political\r\nDebates between Hon. Abraham Lincoln and Hon. Stephen A. Douglas,\" may\r\nbe found the following extract from Mr. Lincoln's speech:—\r\n\r\n     \"I have alluded in the beginning of these remarks to the fact\r\n     that Judge Douglas has made great complaint of my having\r\n     expressed the opinion that this government 'cannot endure\r\n     permanently half slave and half free.' He has complained of\r\n     Seward for using different language, and declaring that there\r\n     is an 'irrepressible conflict' between the principles of free\r\n     and slave labor. [_A voice_, \"He says it is not original with\r\n     Seward. That is original with Lincoln.\"] I will attend to that\r\n     immediately, sir. Since that time Hickman of Pennsylvania\r\n     expressed the same sentiment. He has never denounced Mr.\r\n     Hickman; why? There is a little chance, notwithstanding that\r\n     opinion in the mouth of Hickman, that he may yet be a Douglas\r\n     man. That is the difference! It is not unpatriotic to hold\r\n     that opinion, if a man is a Douglas man.\r\n\r\n     \"But neither I, nor Seward, nor Hickman is entitled to the\r\n     enviable or unenviable distinction of having first expressed\r\n     that idea. That same idea was expressed by the _Richmond\r\n     Enquirer_ in Virginia, in 1856, quite two years before it was\r\n     expressed by the first of us. And while Douglas was pluming\r\n     himself that in his conflict with my humble self, last year,\r\n     he had 'squelched out' that fatal heresy, as he delighted to\r\n     call it, and had suggested that if he only had had a chance\r\n     to be in New York and meet Seward he would have 'squelched' it\r\n     there also, it never occurred to him to breathe a word against\r\n     Pryor. I don't think that you can discover that Douglas ever\r\n     talked of going to Virginia to 'squelch' out that idea there.\r\n     No. More than that. That same Roger A. Pryor was brought to\r\n     Washington City and made the editor of the _par excellence_\r\n     Douglas paper, after making use of that expression, which in\r\n     us is so unpatriotic and heretical.\"\r\n\r\nOn November 6, 1860, Mr. Lincoln was elected President of the United\r\nStates. On the following December 20 we heard that South Carolina had\r\nseceded from the Union. We were all, at the time the news arrived,\r\nattending the wedding of Mr. Bouligny and Miss Parker. The ceremony\r\nhad taken place, and I was standing behind the President's chair when a\r\ncommotion in the hall arrested his attention. He looked at me over his\r\nshoulder and asked if I supposed the house was on fire.\r\n\r\n\"I will inquire the cause, Mr. President,\" I said. I went out at the\r\nnearest door, and there in the entrance hall I found Mr. Lawrence Keitt,\r\nmember from South Carolina, leaping in the air, shaking a paper over his\r\nhead, and exclaiming, \"Thank God! Oh, thank God!\" I took hold of him and\r\nsaid: \"Mr. Keitt, are you crazy? The President hears you, and wants to\r\nknow what's the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" he cried, \"South Carolina has seceded! Here's the telegram. I feel\r\nlike a boy let out from school.\"\r\n\r\nI returned, and bending over Mr. Buchanan's chair, said in a low voice:\r\n\"It appears, Mr. President, that South Carolina has seceded from the\r\nUnion. Mr. Keitt has a telegram.\" He looked at me, stunned for a moment.\r\nFalling back and grasping the arms of his chair, he whispered, \"Madam,\r\nmight I beg you to have my carriage called?\" I met his secretary and\r\nsent him in without explanation, and myself saw that his carriage was\r\nat the door before I reëntered the room. I then found my husband, who\r\nwas already cornered with Mr. Keitt, and we called our own carriage\r\nand drove to Judge Douglas's. There was no more thought of bride,\r\nbridegroom, wedding-cake, or wedding breakfast.\r\n\r\nThis was the tremendous event which was to change all our lives,—to\r\ngive us poverty for riches, mutilation and wounds for strength and\r\nhealth, obscurity and degradation for honor and distinction, exile and\r\nloneliness for inherited homes and friends, pain and death for happiness\r\nand life.\r\n\r\nApprehension was felt lest the new President's inaugural might be the\r\noccasion of rioting, if not of violence. We Southerners were advised to\r\nsend women and children out of the city. Hastily packing my personal and\r\nhousehold belongings to be sent after me, I took my little boys, with\r\ntheir faithful nurse, Eliza Page, on board the steamer to Acquia Creek,\r\nand, standing on deck as long as I could see the dome of the Capitol,\r\ncommenced my journey homeward. My husband remained behind, and kept his\r\nseat in Congress until Mr. Lincoln's inauguration. He described that\r\nmournful day to me,—differing so widely from the happy installation of\r\nMr. Pierce; \"o'er all there hung a shadow and a fear.\" Every one was\r\noppressed by it, and no one more than the doomed President himself.\r\n\r\nWe were reunited a few weeks afterward at our father's house in\r\nPetersburg; and in a short time my young congressman had become my\r\nyoung colonel—and congressman as well, for as soon as Virginia seceded\r\nhe was elected to the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States of\r\nAmerica, and was commissioned colonel by Governor Letcher.\r\n\r\nWe bade adieu to the bright days,—the balls (sometimes three in one\r\nevening), the round of visits, the levees, the charming \"at homes.\" The\r\nsetting sun of such a day should pillow itself on golden clouds, bright\r\nharbingers of a morning of beauty and happiness. Alas, alas! \"whom the\r\ngods destroy they first infatuate.\"\r\n\r\nThe fate of Virginia was decided April 15, when President Lincoln\r\ndemanded troops for the subjugation of the seceding states of the South.\r\nThe temper of Governor Letcher of Virginia was precisely in accord with\r\nthe spirit that prompted the answer of Governor Magoffin of Kentucky\r\nto a similar call for state militia, \"Kentucky will furnish no troops\r\nfor the wicked purpose of subduing her sister Southern states!\" Until\r\nthis call of the President, Virginia had been extremely averse from\r\nsecession, and even though she deemed it within her rights to leave the\r\nUnion, she did not wish to pledge herself to join the Confederate States\r\nof the South. Virginia was the Virginian's country. The common people\r\nwere wont to speak of her as \"The Old Mother,\"—\"the mother of us all,\"\r\na mother so honored and loved that her brood of children must be noble\r\nand true.\r\n\r\nHer sons had never forgotten her! She had fought nobly in the Revolution\r\nand had afterward surrendered, for the common good, her magnificent\r\nterritory. Had she retained this vast dominion, she could now have\r\ndictated to all the other states. She gave it up from a pure spirit of\r\npatriotism,—that there might be the fraternity which could not exist\r\nwithout equality,—and in surrendering it she had reserved for herself\r\nthe right to withdraw from the confederation whenever she should deem it\r\nexpedient for her own welfare. There were leading spirits who thought\r\nthe hour had come when she might demand her right. She was not on a\r\nplane with the other states of the Union. \"Virginia, New York, and\r\nMassachusetts had expressly reserved the right to withdraw from the\r\nUnion, and explicitly disclaimed the right or power to bind the hands\r\nof posterity by any form of government whatever.\"[5]\r\n\r\nA strong party was the \"Union Party,\" sternly resolved against\r\nsecession, willing to run the risks of fighting within the Union for\r\nthe rights of the state. This spirit was so strong that any hint of\r\nsecession had been met with angry defiance. A Presbyterian clergyman\r\nhad ventured, in his morning sermon, a hint that Virginia might need\r\nher sons for defence, when a gray-haired elder left the church, and\r\nturning at the door, shouted, \"Traitor!\" This was in Petersburg, near\r\nthe birthplace of General Winfield Scott.\r\n\r\nAnd still another party was the enthusiastic secession party, resolved\r\nupon resistance to coercion; the men who could believe nothing good of\r\nthe North, should interests of that section conflict with those of the\r\nSouth; who cherished the bitterest resentments for all the sneers and\r\ninsults in Congress; who, like the others, adored their own state and\r\nwere ready and willing to die in her defence. Strange to say, this was\r\nthe predominating spirit all through the country, in rural districts as\r\nwell as in the small towns and the larger cities. It seemed to be born\r\nall at once in every breast as soon as Lincoln demanded the soldiers.\r\n\r\nWhen it was disclosed that a majority of the Virginia Convention opposed\r\ntaking the state out of the Union, the secessionists became greatly\r\nalarmed; for they knew that without the border states, of which Virginia\r\nwas the leader, the cotton states would be speedily crushed. They were\r\npositively certain, however, that in the event of actual hostilities\r\nVirginia would unite with her Southern associates. Accordingly, it was\r\ndetermined to bring a popular pressure to bear upon the government at\r\nMontgomery to make an assault on Fort Sumter. To that end my husband\r\nwent to Charleston, and delivered to an immense and enthusiastic\r\naudience a most impassioned and vehement speech, urging the Southern\r\ntroops to \"strike a blow,\" and assuring them that in case of conflict,\r\nVirginia would secede \"within an hour by Shrewsbury clock.\" The blow\r\nwas struck; Mr. Lincoln called upon Virginia for a quota of troops to\r\nsubdue the rebellion, and the state immediately passed an ordinance of\r\nsecession. Here, in substance, is my husband's Charleston speech, as\r\nreported at the time by the _New York Tribune_:—\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Roger A. Pryor, called by South Carolina papers the\r\n     'eloquent young tribune of the South,' was on Wednesday\r\n     evening serenaded at Charleston. In response to the compliment\r\n     he made some remarks, among which were the following:\r\n     'Gentlemen, for my part, if Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal\r\n     Hamlin were to abdicate their office to-morrow, and were\r\n     to give to me a blank sheet of paper whereupon to write the\r\n     conditions of reannexation to the Union, I would scorn the\r\n     privilege of putting the terms upon paper. [_Cheers._] And\r\n     why? Because our grievance has not been with reference to the\r\n     insufficiency of the guarantees, but the unutterable perfidy\r\n     of the guarantors; and inasmuch as they would not fulfil the\r\n     stipulations of the old Constitution, much less will they\r\n     carry out the guarantees of a better Constitution looking to\r\n     the interests of the South. Therefore, I invoke you to give\r\n     no countenance to any idea of reconstruction. [_A voice_, \"We\r\n     don't intend to do anything of the kind.\"] It is the fear of\r\n     that which is embarrassing us in Virginia, for all there say\r\n     if we are reduced to the dilemma of an alternative, they will\r\n     espouse the cause of the South against the interests of the\r\n     Northern Confederacy. If you have any ideas of reconstruction,\r\n     I pray you annihilate them. Give forth to the world that\r\n     under no circumstances whatever will South Carolina stay in\r\n     political association with the Northern states. I understand\r\n     since I have been in Charleston that there is some little\r\n     apprehension of Virginia in this great exigency. Now I\r\n     am not speaking for Virginia officially; I wish to God I\r\n     were, for I would put her out of the Union before twelve\r\n     o'clock to-night. [_Laughter._] But I bid you dismiss your\r\n     apprehensions as to the old Mother of Presidents. Give the\r\n     old lady time. [_Laughter._] She cannot move with the agility\r\n     of some of the younger daughters. She is a little rheumatic.\r\n     Remember she must be pardoned for deferring somewhat to\r\n     the exigencies of opposition in the Pan Handle of Virginia.\r\n     Remember the personnel of the convention to whom she intrusted\r\n     her destinies. But making these reservations, I assure you\r\n     that just so certain as to-morrow's sun will rise upon us,\r\n     just so certain will Virginia be a member of the Southern\r\n     Confederation. We will put her in _if you but strike a blow_.\r\n     [_Cheers._] I do not say anything to produce an effect upon\r\n     the military operations of your authorities, for I know no\r\n     more about them than a spinster. I only repeat, if you wish\r\n     Virginia to be with you, _strike a blow_!'\"\r\n\r\nThe effect, however, of the speech was not merely the adoption of the\r\nordinance of secession by Virginia. In precipitating the assault upon\r\nSumter the speech had another and now little known consequence.\r\n\r\nIt must be borne in mind that when only South Carolina had seceded, the\r\nRepublican party, with the assent of the President-elect, had proffered\r\nto the South a compromise in these terms: \"The Constitution shall\r\nnever be altered so as to authorize Congress to abolish or interfere\r\nwith slavery in the states.\"[6] Of course, no Southern state would\r\noppose a proposition which for the first time made slavery _eo nomine_\r\nan institution under federal protection, and guaranteed it perpetual\r\nexistence in the slave-holding states. Equally evident was it that\r\na measure supported by Lincoln and the entire Republican party would\r\nprevail in every Northern state. The mere pendency, then, of such an\r\noverture, if not intercepted in its passage by an act of hostility\r\nbetween the seceded states and the federal government, would have\r\ncertainly bound the border states to the Union, and have insured the\r\nmiscarriage of the secession movement.\r\n\r\nHad not the attack on Sumter been made at the critical moment, the\r\nRepublican compromise, as already intimated, would have prevailed,\r\nand slavery have been imbedded in the Constitution and fastened upon\r\nthe country beyond the chance of removal,—except by revolution, or the\r\nvoluntary renunciation of its cherished interests by the slave-holding\r\nSouth. The latter alternative is an inconceivable possibility; and\r\nhence, but for the \"blow\" which prompted hostilities and prevented a\r\npacific solution, slavery would exist to-day as a recognized institution\r\nof the republic.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend that this consummation was desired or anticipated by\r\nthe Virginia secessionist, but affirm only that he \"builded better than\r\nhe knew,\" and that but for his act the nation would not now be free from\r\nthe reproach of human slavery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"overt act,\" for which everybody looked, had been really the\r\nreënforcement by federal troops of the fort in Charleston harbor. When\r\nFort Sumter was reduced by Beauregard, \"the fight was on.\" My husband,\r\nwith other gentlemen, was deputed by General Beauregard to demand the\r\nsurrender of the fort, and in case of refusal which he foresaw, to\r\ndirect the commandant of the battery, Johnson, to open fire. When the\r\norder was delivered to the commandant, he invited my husband to fire the\r\nfirst shot; but this honor my husband declined, and instead suggested\r\nthe venerable Edmund Ruffin, an intense secessionist, for that service.\r\nIt was the prevalent impression at the time that Mr. Ruffin did \"fire\r\nthe first gun\"; at all events he fired, to him, the last; for on hearing\r\nof Lee's surrender, Cato-like, he destroyed himself.\r\n\r\nFort Sumter was reduced on April 12, and Virginia was in a wild state\r\nof excitement and confusion. On May 23 Virginia ratified an ordinance\r\nof secession, and on the early morning of May 24 the federal soldiers,\r\nunder the Virginian, General Winfield Scott, crossed the Potomac River\r\nand occupied Arlington Heights and the city of Alexandria. \"The invasion\r\nof Virginia, the pollution of her sacred soil,\" as it was termed, called\r\nforth a vigorous proclamation from her governor and a cry of rage from\r\nher press. General Beauregard issued a fierce proclamation, tending\r\nto fire the hearts of the Virginians with indignation. \"A reckless and\r\nunprincipled host,\" he declared, \"has invaded your soil,\" etc. Virginia\r\nneeded no such stimulus. The First, Second, and Third Virginia were\r\nimmediately mustered into service, and my husband was colonel of the\r\nThird Virginia Infantry. He was ordered to Norfolk with his regiment to\r\nprotect the seaboard. I was proud of his colonelship, and much exercised\r\nbecause he had no shoulder-straps. I undertook to embroider them myself.\r\nWe had not then decided upon the star for our colonels' insignia, and I\r\nsupposed he would wear the eagle like all the colonels I had ever known.\r\nNo embroidery bullion was to be had, but I bought heavy bullion fringe,\r\ncut it in lengths, and made eagles, probably of some extinct species,\r\nfor the like were unknown in Audubon's time, and have not since been\r\ndiscovered. However, they were accepted, admired, and, what is worse,\r\nworn.\r\n\r\nMy resolution was taken. I steadily withstood all the entreaties of my\r\nfriends, and determined to follow my husband's regiment through the war.\r\nI did not ask his permission. I would give no trouble. I should be only\r\na help to his sick men and his wounded. I busied myself in preparing a\r\ncamp equipage—a field stove with a rotary chimney, ticks for bedding,\r\nto be filled with straw or hay or leaves, as the case might be, and a\r\ncamp chest of tin utensils, strong blankets, etc. A tent could always\r\nbe had from Major Shepard, our quartermaster. News soon came that the\r\nThird Virginia had been ordered to Smithfield. McClellan was looking\r\ntoward the peninsula, and Major-general Joseph E. Johnston was keeping\r\nan eye on McClellan.\r\n\r\nWhen I set forth on what my father termed my \"wild-goose chase,\" I found\r\nthe country literally alive with troops. The train on which I travelled\r\nwas switched off again and again to allow them to pass. My little boys\r\nhad the time of their lives, cheering the soldiers and picnicking at\r\nshort intervals all day. But I had hardly reached Smithfield before\r\nthe good people of the town forcibly took my camp equipage from me,\r\nstored it, and installed me in great comfort in a private house. My\r\ncolonel soon left me to take his seat in the Confederate Congress\r\nalong with Hon. William C. Rives and others of our old friends. I was\r\nleft alone at Smithfield, not _la fille du régiment_, but _la mère_! I\r\nheard daily from all the sick men in winter quarters, and ministered to\r\nthem according to my ability. The camp fascinated me. Picturesque huts\r\nwere built of pine with the bark on, and in clearings here and there\r\nbrilliant fires of the resinous wood were constantly burning. I knew\r\nmany of the officers, and from them soon learned that the deadly foe at\r\nhome was more to be dreaded than the foe in front. Smithfield was noted\r\nfor its Virginia hams, its fine fish, its mullets that would leap into\r\nthe fisherman's boat while he lazily enjoyed his brier-root, its great\r\nsugary \"yams,\" as the red sweet-potato was called. It was noted as well\r\nfor the excellence of its brandy.\r\n\r\nMy colonel issued stern orders that no intoxicating liquors were to\r\nbe sold to his soldiers. Every man who went on leave to the town was\r\ninspected on his return. But drunken men gave trouble in the camp,\r\nand it was discovered that brandy was smuggled in the barrels of the\r\nmuskets, and in yams, hollowed out and innocently reposing at the bottom\r\nof baskets.\r\n\r\nThereupon one morning Smithfield was in an uproar, negroes screaming and\r\nrunning about with pails to be filled, tipsy pigs staggering along the\r\nstreets. A squad of soldiers had been ordered out from camp, had entered\r\nevery store, and emptied the contents of every cask into the gutters. A\r\ndrunken brawl had occurred in camp, and one soldier had killed another!\r\n\r\nThe soldier was arrested and imprisoned. Later the prisoner was tried\r\nand acquitted,—his own colonel argued in his defence,—and completely\r\nsobered, he made a good soldier. The prompt act of the commanding\r\nofficer was salutary. There was no more trouble—no more muskets loaded\r\nwith inflammable stuff, no more yams flavored with brandy.\r\n\r\nWhen the colonel was attending the session of Congress, Theo, not\r\nyet ten years old, was often mounted on a barrel, in his little linen\r\nblouse, to drill the Third Virginia! He had studied military tactics,\r\nHardee and Jomini, with his father. Lying before me as I write is his\r\nown copy of Jomini's \"L'Art de la Guerre,\" in which he proudly wrote his\r\nname. An event of personal interest was the presentation to the colonel\r\nof a blue silken flag, made by the ladies of Petersburg. The party came\r\ndown the river in a steamboat, and I have before my reminiscent eyes\r\nan interesting picture of my colonel, as he stood with his long hair\r\nwaving in a stiff breeze, listening to the brave things the dear women's\r\nspokesman said of their devotion to him and to their country. This flag\r\nis somewhere, to-day, in that country, but not in the home of the man\r\nwho had earned and owned it. It is of heavy blue silk; on one side the\r\narms of the state of Virginia, on the other Justice with the scales. In\r\nthe upper left-hand corner is the word \"Williamsburg,\" room being left\r\nfor the many other battles in store for the young colonel.\r\n\r\nThings were going on beautifully with us when I one day received a\r\nperemptory official order to change my base—to leave Smithfield next\r\nmorning before daybreak! The orderly who brought it to me looked\r\nintensely surprised when I calmly said: \"Tell the colonel it is\r\nimpossible! I can't get ready by to-morrow to leave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said the man, gravely, \"it is none of my business, but\r\nwhen Colonel Pryor gives an order, it is wise to be a strict\r\nconstructionist.\"\r\n\r\nMy colonel had returned suddenly; when I, in an open wagon, was on\r\nmy way next morning at sunrise to the nearest depot, he and his men\r\nwere _en route_ to the peninsula. They gave McClellan battle May 5\r\nat Williamsburg,—\"Pryor and Anderson in front,\"—captured four hundred\r\nunwounded prisoners, ten colors, and twelve field-pieces, slept on the\r\nfield of battle, and marched off next morning at their convenience.\r\nMy colonel personally ministered to the wounded prisoners, and General\r\nMcClellan recognizes this service in his \"own story.\" After this he was\r\npromoted, and my bristling eagles retired before the risen stars of the\r\nbrigadier-general.\r\n\r\nThe news of his probable promotion reached me at the Exchange Hotel in\r\nRichmond, whither I had gone that I might be near headquarters and thus\r\nlearn the earliest tidings from the peninsula. There he joined me for\r\none day. We read with keen interest the announcement in the papers that\r\nhis name had been sent in by the President for promotion. Mrs. Davis\r\nheld a reception at the Spotswood Hotel on the evening following this\r\nannouncement, and we availed ourselves of the opportunity to make our\r\nrespects to her.\r\n\r\nA crowd gathered before the Exchange to congratulate my husband, and\r\nlearning that he had gone to the Spotswood, repaired thither, and\r\nwith shouts and cheers called him out for a speech. This was very\r\nembarrassing, and he fled to a corner of the drawing-room and hid\r\nbehind a screen of plants. I was standing near the President, trying to\r\nhold his attention by remarks on the weather and kindred subjects of\r\na thrilling nature, when a voice from the street called out: \"Pryor!\r\n_General_ Pryor!\" I could endure the suspense no longer, and asked\r\ntremblingly, \"Is this true, Mr. President?\" Mr. Davis looked at me with\r\na benevolent smile and said, \"I have no reason, madam, to doubt it,\r\nexcept that I saw it this morning in the papers;\" and Mrs. Davis at once\r\nsummoned the bashful colonel: \"What are you doing lying there _perdu_\r\nbehind the geraniums? Come out and take your honors.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing fast upon the battle after which General Johnston ordered\r\n\"Williamsburg\" to be painted on his banner, my general fought the battle\r\nof \"Fair Oaks\" or \"Seven Pines\"—and in June the Seven Days' battle\r\naround Richmond. The story of these desperate battles has been told\r\nmany times by the generals who fought them. \"Pryor's Brigade\" was in the\r\nfront often; in the thick of the fight always. I myself saw my husband\r\ndraw his sword, and give the word of command \"Head of column to the\r\nright\" as he entered the first of these battles.\r\n\r\nI spent the time nursing the wounded in Kent and Paine's Hospital in\r\nRichmond, and have told elsewhere the pathetic story of my experience as\r\nhospital nurse. For the needs of that stern hour my dear general gave\r\nhimself—and his wife gave herself. Every linen garment I possessed,\r\nexcept one change, every garment of cotton fabric, all my table-linen,\r\nall my bed-linen, even the chintz covers for furniture,—all were torn\r\ninto strips and rolled for bandages for the soldiers' wounds.\r\n\r\nWhen the fight was over, a gray, haggard, dust-covered soldier entered\r\nmy room, and throwing himself upon the couch, gave way to the anguish\r\nof his heart—\"My men! My men! They are almost all dead!\"\r\n\r\nThousands of Confederate soldiers were killed or wounded. Richmond was\r\nsaved! \"I am in hopes,\" wrote General McClellan to his Secretary of War,\r\n\"the enemy is as completely worn out as I am.\"\r\n\r\nHe was! General Lee realized that his men must have rest. My husband\r\nwas allowed a few days' respite from duty. Almost without a pause he\r\nhad fought the battles of Williamsburg, Seven Pines, Mechanicsville,\r\nGaines's Mill, Frazier's Farm, and Malvern Hill. He had won his\r\npromotion early, but he had lost the soldiers he had led, the loved\r\ncommander who appreciated him, had seen old schoolmates and friends fall\r\nby his side,—the dear fellow, George Loyal Gordon, who had been his best\r\nman at our wedding,—old college comrades, valued old neighbors.\r\n\r\nOpposed to him in battle, then and after, were men who in after years\r\navowed themselves his warm friends,—General Hancock, General Slocum,\r\nGeneral Butterfield, General Sickles, General Fitz-John Porter, General\r\nMcClellan, and General Grant. They had fought loyally under opposing\r\nbanners, and from time to time, as the war went on, one and another\r\nhad been defeated; but over all, and through all, their allegiance had\r\nbeen given to a banner that has never surrendered,—the standard of the\r\nuniversal brotherhood of all true men.\r\n\r\nI cannot omit a passing tribute to the heroic fortitude and devotion of\r\nthe Richmond women in the time of their greatest trial. These were the\r\ndelicate, beautiful women I had so admired when I lived among them. Not\r\nonce did they spare themselves, or complain, or evince weakness, or give\r\nway to despair. The city had \"no language but a cry.\" Two processions\r\nunceasingly passed along the streets; one the wounded borne from the\r\nbattlefield; the other the cheering men going to take their places at\r\nthe front. Within the hospitals all that devotion could suggest, of\r\nunselfish service, gentle ministration, encouragement, was done by the\r\ndear women. Every house was open for the sick and wounded. Oh, but I\r\ncannot again tell it all! Sacredly, tenderly I remember, but to-day it\r\nseems so cruel, so unnecessary, so wicked! I cannot dwell upon it!\r\n\r\nOne beautiful memory is of the unfailing kindness and loyalty of\r\nthe negroes. In the hospitals, in the camps, in our own houses, they\r\nfaithfully sympathized with us and helped us. Not only at this time,\r\nbut all during the war, they behaved admirably. The most intense\r\nsecessionist I ever knew was my general's man, John. Early in the\r\nday the black man elected for himself an attitude of quiescence\r\nas to politics, and addressed himself to the present need for\r\nself-preservation.\r\n\r\nIt was \"Domingo,\" one of the cooks of our brigade at Williamsburg, that\r\noriginated the humorous description of a negro's self-appraisement and\r\nsensations in battle, so unblushingly quoted afterward by a certain\r\n\"Cæsar\" in northern Virginia. A shell had entered the domain of pots and\r\nkettles, and created what Domingo termed a \"clatteration.\" He at once\r\nstarted for the rear.\r\n\r\n\"What's de matter, Mingo?\" asked a fellow-servant, \"whar you gwine wid\r\nsuch a hurrification?\"\r\n\r\n\"I gwine to git out o' trouble—_dar_ whar I gwine! Dar's too much\r\npowder in dem big things. Dis chile ain't gwine bu'n hisself! An'\r\ndar's dem Minnie bullets, too, comin' frew de a'r, singin': '_Whar_ is\r\nyou? _Whar_ is you?' I ain't gwine stop an' tell 'em whar I is! I'se\r\na twenty-two-hundurd-dollar nigger, an' I'se gwine tek keer o' what\r\nb'longs to marster, I is!\"\r\n\r\nA story was related by a Northern writer of an interview with a negro\r\nwho had run the blockade and entered the service of a Federal officer.\r\nHe was met on board a steamer, after the battle of Fort Donelson, on\r\nhis way to the rear, and questioned in regard to his experience of war.\r\n\r\n\"Were you in the fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Had a little taste of it, sah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stood your ground, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sah! I run.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at the first fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sah! an' would a' run sooner ef I knowed it was a-comin'!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that wasn't very creditable to your courage, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat ain't in my line, sah,—cookin's my perfeshun.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you no regard for your reputation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Refutation's nothin' by de side o' life.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't consider your life worth more than other people's, do\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hit's wuth mo' to me, sah!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must value it very highly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas, sah, I does,—mo'n all dis wuld! Mo' dan a million o' dollars,\r\nsah. What would dat be wuth to a man wid de bref out o' 'im?\r\nSelf-perserbashun is de fust law wid me, sah!\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should you act upon a different rule from other men?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause diffunt man set diffunt value 'pon his life. Mine ain't in de\r\nmarket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if all soldiers were like you, traitors might have broken up the\r\ngovernment without resistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat's so! Dar wouldn't 'a' been no hep fer it. But I don't put my life\r\nin de scale against no gubberment on dis yearth. No gubberment gwine\r\npay me ef I loss mehsef.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, do you think you would have been much missed if you had been\r\nkilled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not, sah! A daid white man ain' much use to dese yere sogers,\r\nlet alone a daid niggah; but I'd a missed mehsef pow'ful, an' dat's de\r\npint wid me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of August, 1862, McClellan abandoned his camp at Harrison's\r\nLanding and retired to Fortress Monroe. General Lee withdrew all his\r\ntroops from Richmond but two companies of infantry left behind to\r\nprotect the city in case of cavalry raids. General Jackson joined\r\nGeneral Lee, and the battle known as the second Manassas was fought.\r\nWilcox, Pryor, and Featherstone were again to the front, and at one\r\ntime when the desperate struggle of this hard-fought battle was at its\r\nheight, and the situation augured adversely to the Southern troops, it\r\nwas General Pryor's privilege to suggest that several batteries should\r\nbe rushed to an advantageous position and a raking fire be opened upon\r\nthe enemy's flank which nothing could withstand. Within fifteen minutes\r\nthe aspect of the field was changed. On the plateau occupied by the\r\nFederals stood the Henry house, celebrated in all history as the spot\r\nwhere Jackson's Brigade, \"standing like a stone wall,\" had, a year\r\nbefore, earned the name for their commander which has become immortal.\r\n\r\nI think it was early in September, 1862, that General Lee announced\r\nto President Davis that he proposed entering Maryland with his army.\r\nBefore he could receive an answer the Southerners were crossing the\r\nPotomac singing \"Maryland, my Maryland,\" and in a few days Jackson\r\nreached Frederick. \"My Maryland\" was earnestly invited and positively\r\ndeclined to rid her \"shores\" of \"the despot's heel.\" The despot's hand\r\ncould pay in good greenbacks for her wheat and flour and cattle, while\r\nthese new fellows had only Confederate money. The governor and leading\r\nprofessional men were all loyal to the Union. The farmers drove their\r\nherds into Pennsylvania, and in the mills the sound of the grinding was\r\nnot low—it ceased altogether. The Confederates might defeat Pope and\r\nMcClellan in the battle-field; the farmer proved himself master of the\r\nsituation in the wheat-field.\r\n\r\nMy general was in Frederick with his brigade, and incidentally saw\r\nand heard nothing of the touching occurrence commemorated by Whittier.\r\nThe Quaker poet was a romancer! I use no harsher term. I am perfectly\r\nwilling Barbara Frietchie's \"old gray head\" should forever wear the\r\ncrown he placed upon it, but I cannot brook \"the blush of shame\" over\r\nStonewall Jackson's face. Blush he often did,—for he was as delicate as\r\na woman,—but blush for shame, never! Rhodes says: \"His riding through\r\nthe streets gave an occasion to forge the story of Barbara Frietchie.\r\nIt is a token of the intense emotion which clouds our judgment of the\r\nenemy in arms. Although Stonewall Jackson, not long before, was eager\r\nto raise the black flag, he was incapable of giving the order to fire\r\nat the window of a private house for the sole reason that there 'the\r\nold flag met his sight,' and it is equally impossible that a remark of\r\nold Dame Barbara, 'Spare your country's flag,' could have brought 'a\r\nblush of shame' to his cheek. Jackson was not of the cavalier order,\r\nbut he had a religious and chivalrous respect for women.\" He goes on\r\nto state that a woman, not Barbara Frietchie, waved a flag as Jackson\r\npassed to which he paid no attention. Also, that when he had passed\r\nthrough Middletown, two pretty girls had waved Union flags in his face.\r\n\"He bowed and raised his hat, and turning with his quiet smile to his\r\nstaff, said: 'We evidently have no friends in this town.'\"\r\n\r\nOn September 15 the battle-line, with my husband's division\r\n(Longstreet's), was drawn up in front of Sharpsburg (or Antietam), and\r\nagain Pryor, Wilcox, and Featherstone were well to the front. My husband\r\ncommanded Anderson's division at Antietam, General Anderson having been\r\nwounded. This battle is quoted, along with the battle of Seven Pines,\r\nas one of the most hotly contested of the war. Sorely pressed at one\r\ntime, General Pryor despatched an orderly to General Longstreet with a\r\nrequest for artillery. The latter tore the margin from a newspaper and\r\nwrote: \"I am sending you the guns, dear General. This is a hard fight,\r\nand we had better all die than lose it.\" At one time during the battle\r\nthe combatants agreed upon a brief cessation, that the dead and wounded\r\nof both sides might be removed. While General Pryor waited, a Federal\r\nofficer approached him.\r\n\r\n\"General,\" said he, \"I have just detected one of my men in robbing the\r\nbody of one of your soldiers. I have taken his booty from him, and now\r\nconsign it to you.\"\r\n\r\nWithout examining the small bundle—tied in a handkerchief—my husband\r\nordered it to be properly enclosed and sent to me. The handkerchief\r\ncontained a gold watch, a pair of gold sleeve-links, a few pieces of\r\nsilver, and a strip of paper on which was written, \"Strike till the last\r\narmed foe expires,\" and signed \"A Florida Patriot.\" There seemed to be\r\nno clew by which I might hope to find an inheritor for these treasures.\r\nI could only take care of them.\r\n\r\nI brought them forth one day to interest an aged relative, whose chair\r\nwas placed in a sunny window. \"I think, my dear,\" she said, \"there\r\nare pin-scratched letters on the inside of these sleeve-buttons.\" Sure\r\nenough, there were three initials, rudely made, but perfectly plain.\r\n\r\nLong afterward I met a Confederate officer from Florida who had fought\r\nat Antietam.\r\n\r\n\"Did you know any one from your state, Captain, who was killed at\r\nSharpsburg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! yes,\" he replied, and mentioned a name corresponding exactly with\r\nthe scratched initials.\r\n\r\nThe parcel, with a letter from me, was sent to an address he gave me,\r\nand in due time I received a most touching letter of thanks from the\r\nmother of the dead soldier.\r\n\r\nIn August I had left my Gordon, Theo, and Mary with my dear aunt, who\r\nhad been compelled to abandon her mountain home and now lived near \"The\r\nOaks\" in Charlotte County. There was no safety any longer except in\r\nthe interior, far from the railroads. Even there raiding companies of\r\ncavalry dashed through the country bringing terror and leaving a desert\r\nas far as food was concerned.\r\n\r\nFor myself, as I could not go northward with my soldiers, I could at\r\nleast keep within the lines of communication, and I selected a little\r\nsummer resort, \"Coyners,\" in the Blue Ridge Mountains on the line of\r\nthe railroad. There I found General Elzey,—who had fought gallantly at\r\nBull Run and elsewhere,—with his face terribly wounded and bandaged up\r\nto his eyes. He had been sent to the rear with a physician for rest and\r\nrecovery. His brilliant wife was with him; also his aid, Captain Contee,\r\nand his young bride, who had crossed the Potomac in an open boat to join\r\nhim and redeem her pledge to marry him. We were joined by Mrs. A. P.\r\nHill, General and Mrs. Wigfall and a lovely daughter who has recently\r\ngiven to the world an interesting story of her war recollections. The\r\nsmall hotel spanned a little green valley at its head, and stretching\r\nbehind was a velvet strip of green, a spring and rivulet in the midst,\r\nand a mountain ridge on either side. I had a tiny cottage with windows\r\nthat opened against the side of the hill (or mountain), and lying on my\r\nbed at night, the moon and stars, as they rose above me, seemed so near\r\nI could have stretched a long arm and picked them off the hill-top!\r\n\r\nStrenuous as were the times, awful the suspense, the vexed questions\r\nof precedence, relative importance, rankled in the bosoms of the\r\ndistinguished ladies in the hotel. One after another would come out\r\nto me: \"I'd like to know _who_ this Maryland woman is that she gives\r\nherself such airs;\" or, \"How much longer do you think I'll stand Dolly\r\nMorgan? Why, she treats me as though she were the Queen of Sheba.\" I\r\ncould only reply with becoming meekness: \"I'm sure I don't know! I am\r\nonly a brigadier, you know—the rest of you are major-generals—I am not\r\ncompetent to judge.\"\r\n\r\nNature had done everything for our happiness. The climate was delicious;\r\nthe valley was carpeted with moss and tender grass, and thickly gemmed\r\nwith daisies and purple asters. Before sunrise the skies, like all\r\nmorning skies seen between high hills, looked as if made of roses. A\r\nshort climb would bring us to a spot where the evening sky and mountain\r\nwould be bathed in golden glory. But oh, the anguish of anxiety, the\r\nterror, the dreams at night of battle and murder and sudden death!\r\n\r\nMy little Roger was desperately ill at this place, and for many days\r\nI despaired of his life. General Elzey's physician gave me no hope.\r\nHe counselled only fortitude and resignation. The dear friend of my\r\ngirlhood, George Wythe Randolph, was Secretary of War. I wrote him\r\na letter imploring, \"Send my husband to me, if but for one hour.\" He\r\nanswered, \"God knows I long to help and comfort you! but you ask the\r\n_impossible_.\" I soon knew why. My general was at the front!\r\n\r\nNot until late—long after every guest had departed—was I able to travel\r\nwith my invalid son. Upon arriving in Charlottesville, he had a relapse\r\nof typhoid fever and was ill unto death for many weeks. Meanwhile his\r\nfather was ordered to the vicinity of Suffolk to collect forage and\r\nprovisions from counties near the Federal lines.\r\n\r\nThe enemy destined to conquer us at last—the \"ravenous, hunger-starved\r\nwolf\"—already menaced us. General Longstreet had learned that corn and\r\nbacon were stored in the northeastern counties of North Carolina, and\r\nhe sent two companies of cavalry on a foraging expedition to the region\r\naround Suffolk.\r\n\r\n\"The Confederate lines,\" says a historian, \"extended only to the\r\nBlackwater River on the east, where a body of Confederate troops was\r\nstationed to keep the enemy in check.\" That body was commanded by\r\nGeneral Pryor, now in front of a large Federal force to keep it in check\r\nwhile the wagon trains sent off corn and bacon for Lee's army. This\r\nwas accomplished by sleepless vigilance on the part of the Confederate\r\ngeneral. The Federal forces made frequent sallies from Suffolk, but were\r\nalways driven back with loss. It is amusing to read of the calmness with\r\nwhich his commanding officers ordered him to accomplish great things\r\nwith his small force.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot,\" says General Colston, \"forward your requisition for two\r\nregiments of infantry and one of cavalry: it is almost useless to\r\nmake such requisitions, for they remain unanswered. You must use every\r\npossible means to deceive the enemy as to your strength, and you must\r\n_hold the line of the Blackwater to the last extremity_.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral French writes: \"If I had any way to increase your forces, I\r\nshould do so, but I have to bow to higher authority and the necessities\r\nof the service. But you must annoy the villains all you can, and make\r\nthem uncomfortable. Give them no rest. Ambush them at every turn.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Pryor did not dream I would come to his camp at Blackwater.\r\nHe supposed I would find quarters among my friends, but I had now no\r\nhome. Our venerable father had sent his family to the interior after\r\nthe battles around Richmond, had given up his church in Petersburg, and,\r\ncommending the women, old men, and children to the care of a successor,\r\nhad entered the army as chaplain, \"where,\" as he said, \"I can follow my\r\nown church members and comfort them in sickness, if I can do no more.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the position of our brigade was made known to me, I drew\r\nforth the box containing the camp outfit, packed a trunk or two, and\r\ntook the cars for the Blackwater. The terminus of the railroad was only\r\na few miles from our camp. The Confederate train could go no farther\r\nbecause of the enemy. The day's journey was long, for the passenger car\r\nattached to the transportation train was dependent upon the movements\r\nof the latter. The few passengers who had set forth with me in the\r\nmorning had left at various wayside stations, and I was now alone. I\r\nhad no idea where we should sleep that night. I thought I would manage\r\nit somehow—somewhere.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at twilight at the end of our journey. When I left the car,\r\nmy little boys gathered around me. There was a small wooden building\r\nnear, which served for waiting-room and post-office. The only dwelling\r\nin sight was another small house, surrounded by a few bare trees. My\r\nfirst impression was that I had never before seen such an expanse of\r\ngray sky. The face of the earth was a dead, bare level, as far as the\r\neye could reach; and much, very much, of it lay under water. I was in\r\nthe region of swamps, stretching on and on until they culminated in the\r\none great \"Dismal Swamp\" of the country. No sounds were to be heard,\r\nno hum of industry or lowing of cattle, but a mighty concert rose from\r\nthousands, nay millions, of frogs.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" thought I, \"here is really a fine opportunity to be 'jolly'! Mark\r\nTapley's swamps couldn't surpass these.\" But all the railroad folk were\r\ndeparting, and the postmaster was preparing to lock his door and leave\r\nalso. I liked the looks of the little man, and ventured:—\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me, sir, where I can get lodging to-night? I am Mrs.\r\nPryor—the general's wife, and to-morrow he will take care of me.\"\r\n\r\nMy little man did not belie his looks. He took me in his own house, and\r\nnext day my general, at his invitation, made the house his headquarters.\r\n\r\nMy stay on the Blackwater was most interesting, but I cannot repeat\r\nthe story here. Suffice it to say that our safety so near the enemy's\r\nlines—he was just across the Blackwater—was purchased by eternal\r\nvigilance.\r\n\r\nTowards the last of January we had a season of warm, humid weather.\r\nApparently the winter was over; the grass was springing on the swamp,\r\ngreen and luxurious, and the willows swelling into bud. There were no\r\nsinging birds on the Blackwater as early as January 28, but the frogs\r\nwere mightily exercised upon the coming of spring, and their nightly\r\nconcerts took on a jubilant note.\r\n\r\nOne day I had a few moments' conversation with my husband about army\r\naffairs, and he remarked that our Southern soldiers were always restless\r\nunless they were in action. \"They never can stand still in battle,\" he\r\nsaid; \"they are willing to yell and charge the most desperate positions,\r\nbut if they can't move forward, they must move backward. Stand still\r\nthey cannot.\"\r\n\r\nI thought I could perceive symptoms of restlessness on the part of their\r\ncommander. Often in the middle of the night he would summon John, mount\r\nhim, and send him to camp, a short distance away; and presently I would\r\nhear the tramp, tramp of the general's staff-officers, coming to hold\r\na council of war in his bedroom. On the 28th of January he confided to\r\nme that on the next day he would make a sally in the direction of the\r\nenemy. \"He is getting entirely too impudent,\" said he; \"I'm not strong\r\nenough to drive him out of the country, but he must keep his place.\"\r\n\r\nI had just received a present of coffee. This was at once roasted and\r\nground. On the day of the march fires were kindled before dawn under the\r\ngreat pots used at the \"hog-killing time\" (an era in the household), and\r\nmany gallons of coffee were prepared. This was sweetened, and when our\r\nmen paused near the house to form the line of march, the servants and\r\nlittle boys passed down the line with buckets of the steaming coffee,\r\ncups, dippers, and gourds. Every soldier had a good draught of comfort\r\nand cheer. The weather had suddenly changed. The great snow-storm that\r\nfell in a few days was gathering, the skies were lowering, and the\r\nhorizon was dark and threatening.\r\n\r\nAfter the men had marched away, I drove to the hospital tent and\r\nput myself at the disposal of the surgeon. We inspected the store of\r\nbandages and lint, and I was intrusted with the preparation of more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile John, who was left behind, indemnified himself for the loss\r\nof the excitement of the hour by abusing \"the nasty abolition Yankees,\"\r\nsinging:—\r\n\r\n     \"Jeff Davis is a gent'man,\r\n     An' Linkum is a fool!\r\n     Jeff Davis rides a fine white horse,\r\n     An' Linkum rides a mule,\" etc.\r\n\r\nHe was not the only one of the nation's wards who held the nation in\r\ncontempt—root and branch, President and people. The special terms in\r\nwhich he loved to designate them were in common use among his own race.\r\nSome of the expressions of the great men I had known in Washington were\r\nquite as offensive and not a bit less inelegant, although framed in\r\nbetter English. I never approved of \"calling names,\" for higher reasons\r\nthan the demands of good taste. I had seen what comes of it, and I\r\nreproved John for teaching them to my little boys.\r\n\r\n\"No'm,\" said John, crestfallen, \"I won't say nothin'; I'll just say the\r\nYankees are mighty mean folks.\"\r\n\r\nMy dear general found the enemy at the \"Deserted House\"; and there gave\r\nthem battle. He may tell his own story:—\r\n\r\n                      \"CARRSVILLE, ISLE OF WIGHT, January 30, 1863.\r\n\r\n     \"TO BRIGADIER-GENERAL COLSTON,\r\n         \"PETERSBURG, VA.\r\n\r\n     \"_General_: This morning at four o'clock the enemy under\r\n     Major-general Peck attacked me at Kelley's store, eight\r\n     miles from Suffolk. After three hours' severe fighting we\r\n     repulsed them at all points and held the field. Their force\r\n     is represented by prisoners to be between ten and fifteen\r\n     thousand. My loss in killed and wounded will not exceed\r\n     fifty—no prisoners. I regret that Colonel Poage is among the\r\n     killed. We inflicted a heavy loss on the enemy.\r\n\r\n                                              \"Respectfully,\r\n                                                    \"ROGER A. PRYOR,\r\n                                     \"Brigadier-general Commanding.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 2 the general thus addressed his troops:—\r\n\r\n     \"The brigadier-general congratulates the troops of this\r\n     command on the results of the recent combat.\r\n\r\n     \"The enemy endeavored under cover of night to steal an\r\n     inglorious victory by surprise, but he found us prepared at\r\n     every point, and despite his superior numbers, greater than\r\n     your own in the proportion of five to one, he was signally\r\n     repulsed and compelled to leave us in possession of the field.\r\n\r\n     \"After silencing his guns and dispersing his infantry, you\r\n     remained on the field from night until one o'clock, awaiting\r\n     the renewal of the attack, but he did not again venture to\r\n     encounter your terrible fire.\r\n\r\n     \"When the disparity of force between the parties is\r\n     considered, with the proximity of the enemy to his stronghold,\r\n     and his facilities of reënforcements by railway, the result\r\n     of the action of the 30th will be accepted as a splendid\r\n     illustration of your courage and good conduct.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the \"enemy's\" papers declared that our force was \"three regiments\r\nof infantry, fourteen pieces of artillery, and about nine hundred\r\ncavalry!\"\r\n\r\nThe temptation to \"lie under a mistake\" was great in those days of\r\npossible disaffection, when soldiers had to believe in their cause in\r\norder to defend it. One of the newspaper correspondents of the enemy\r\nexplained why we were not again attacked after the first fight. He\r\nsaid: \"Some may inquire why we did not march forthwith to Carrsville and\r\nattack the rebels again. The reasons are obvious. Had he went [_sic_] to\r\nCarrsville, Pryor would have had the advantage to cut off our retreat.\r\nThe natives know every by-path and blind road through the woods and are\r\never ready to help the rebels to our detriment. Pryor can always cross\r\nthe Blackwater on his floating bridge. It is prudent to allow an enemy\r\nto get well away from his stronghold the better to capture his guns and\r\ndestroy his ammunition,\" etc.\r\n\r\nAnother paper declares he was heavily reënforced at Carrsville.\r\n\r\nAnother records: \"The rebels have been very bold in this neighborhood.\r\nPryor has been in the habit of crossing the Blackwater River whenever\r\nhe wanted to. Our attacking him this time must have been a real surprise\r\nto him. We took a large number of prisoners!\"\r\n\r\nHe continued the indulgence of this habit until spring, receiving from\r\nhis countrymen unstinted praise for his protection of that part of our\r\nstate, and for the generous supplies he sent all winter to Lee's army.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for myself, when my general was no longer needed on the Blackwater,\r\nthe camp chest and I and the little boys took the road again. We\r\nwandered from place to place, and at last were taken as boarders,\r\ninvited by a farmer, evidently without the consent of his wife. There\r\nI was, of all women made most miserable. The mistress of the house\r\nhad not wanted \"refugees.\" Everything combined to my discomfort and\r\nwretchedness, and my dear general, making me a flying visit from\r\nRichmond where he was detained on duty, counselled me to go still\r\nfarther into the interior to an old watering place, the \"Amelia Springs\"\r\nkept by a dear Virginia woman, Mrs. Winn. I had no sooner arrived and\r\nbeen welcomed by a number of refugee women, and a host of children\r\nwhen my three little boys developed whooping-cough, and were strictly\r\nquarantined in a cottage at the extreme edge of the grounds. The little\r\nhotel and cottages were filled with agreeable women, but everything\r\nwas so sad, there was no heart in any one for gayety of any kind. One\r\nevening the proprietor proposed that the ballroom be lighted and a\r\nsolitary fiddler, \"Bozeman,\"—who was also the barber,—be installed in\r\nthe musician's seat and show us what he could do. Young feet cannot\r\nresist a good waltz or polka, and the floor was soon filled with\r\ncare-forgetting maidens—there were no men except the proprietor and the\r\nfiddler. Presently a telegram was received by the former. We huddled\r\ntogether under the chandelier to read it. Vicksburg had fallen! The\r\ngallant General Pemberton had been starved into submission. Surely and\r\nswiftly the coil was tightening around us. Surely and swiftly would we,\r\ntoo, be starved into submission.\r\n\r\nMy general was in Richmond serving on a court-martial, when the news\r\nfrom Gettysburg reached the city. Every house was in mourning, every\r\nheart broken. He called upon President and Mrs. Davis, and was told\r\nthat the President could receive no one, but that Mrs. Davis would be\r\nglad to see him. The weather was intensely hot, and he felt he must not\r\ninflict a long visit; but when he rose to leave, Mrs. Davis, who seemed\r\nunwilling to be left alone, begged him to remain. After a few minutes\r\nthe President appeared, weary, silent, and depressed. Presently a dear\r\nlittle boy entered in his night-robe, and kneeling beside his father's\r\nknee, repeated his evening prayer of thankfulness and of supplication\r\nfor God's blessing on the country. The President laid his hand on the\r\nboy's head and fervently responded, \"Amen.\" The scene recurred vividly,\r\nin the light of future events, to my husband's memory. With the coming\r\nday came the news of the surrender of Vicksburg,—news of which Mr. Davis\r\nhad been forewarned the evening before,—and already the Angel of Death\r\nwas hovering near to enfold the beautiful boy and bear him away from a\r\nworld of trouble.\r\n\r\nThe long, sultry nights were spent by me in nursing my little boys\r\nthrough their distressing whooping-cough paroxysms. I was sleeping\r\nafter a wakeful night, when I heard, as in a dream, my dear general's\r\nvoice. I opened my heavy eyes to see him seated beside me. He earnestly\r\nentreated me to bear with patience the news he brought me—first that\r\nhe must return in an hour to catch a train back to Richmond, and then\r\nthat he had resigned his commission as brigadier-general and was _en\r\nroute_ to join General Fitz Lee's cavalry as a private. I have told\r\nthe story of the events which culminated in this unprecedented act of\r\na brigadier-general, and I fear I have not time or space to repeat\r\nit here. Briefly, Congress having recommended that regiments should\r\nbe enlisted under officers from their own states,—in order to remedy,\r\nif possible, the disinclination to reënlist for the war,—there was a\r\ngeneral upheaval and change throughout the entire army during the autumn\r\nof 1862. The Second, Fifth, and Eighth Florida regiments of General\r\nPryor's Brigade were assigned to a Florida brigadier, the Fourteenth\r\nAlabama and the Fifth North Carolina to officers from their respective\r\nstates. He was, in consequence of this order of Congress, left without\r\na brigade. He was positively assured of a permanent command. \"I\r\nregretted,\" wrote General Lee, November 25, 1862, \"at the time, the\r\nbreaking up of your brigade, but you are aware that the circumstances\r\nwhich produced it were beyond my control. I hope it will not be long\r\nbefore you will be again in the field, that the country may derive the\r\nbenefit of your zeal and activity.\" He had a right to expect reward\r\nfor his splendid service on the Blackwater. He had never ceased all\r\nwinter to remind the Secretary of War of his promise to give him a\r\npermanent command. He felt that he had earned it. He had fought many\r\nbattles,—Williamsburg, Seven Pines, Mechanicsville, Gaines's Mill,\r\nFrazier's Farm, the second Manassas, and Sharpsburg, besides the fight\r\nat the Deserted House on the Blackwater.\r\n\r\nHe now wrote, April 6, 1863, an almost passionate appeal to the\r\nPresident himself, imploring that he be sent into active service, and\r\nnot be \"denied participation in the struggles that are soon to determine\r\nthe destinies of my country. If I know myself,\" he added, \"it is not the\r\nvanity of command that moves me to this appeal. A single and sincere\r\nwish to contribute somewhat to the success of our cause impels me to\r\nentreat that I may be assigned to duty. That my position is not the\r\nconsequence of any default of mine you will be satisfied by the enclosed\r\nletter from General Lee.\" The letter was followed by new promises. It\r\nwas supplemented by General Pryor's fellow-officers, who not only urged\r\nthat the country should not lose his services, but designated certain\r\nregiments which might easily be assigned to him. The President wrote\r\ncourteous letters in reply, always repeating assurances of esteem,\r\netc., and continuing to give brigades to newer officers. The _Richmond\r\nExaminer_ and other papers now began to notice the matter and present\r\nGeneral Pryor as arrayed with the party against the administration.\r\nThis being untrue, he was magnanimous enough to contradict. On March\r\n17, 1863, the President wrote to him the following:—\r\n\r\n    \"GENERAL ROGER A. PRYOR:\r\n\r\n     \"_General_: Your gratifying letter on the 16th inst.,\r\n     referring to an article in the _Examiner_ newspaper\r\n     which seems to associate you with the opposition to the\r\n     administration, has been received.\r\n\r\n     \"I did not see the article in question, but I am glad it had\r\n     led to an expression so agreeable. The good opinion of one so\r\n     competent to judge of public affairs, and who has known me so\r\n     long and closely, is a great support in the midst of many and\r\n     arduous trials.\r\n\r\n                             \"Very respectfully and truly yours,\r\n                                                  \"JEFFERSON DAVIS.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the letters sent to Mr. Davis in General Pryor's behalf was one\r\nfrom General Lee and one from General Jackson, both of which unhappily\r\nremained in the President's possession, no copies having been kept by\r\nGeneral Pryor.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, my husband waited with such patience as he could\r\ncommand. Finally he resigned his commission as brigadier-general and\r\nalso his seat in Congress, and entered General Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry\r\nas a private soldier. His resignation was held a long time by the\r\nPresident, \"in the hope it would be reconsidered,\" and repeatedly\r\nGeneral Pryor was \"assured of the President's esteem,\" etc. General\r\nJackson, General Longstreet, General A. P. Hill, General D. H. Hill,\r\nGeneral Wilcox, General George Pickett, General Beauregard, were all\r\nhis devoted friends. Some of them had, like General Johnston and General\r\nMcClellan, similar experience.\r\n\r\nIt was a bitter hour for me when my general followed me to the Amelia\r\nSprings with news that he had entered the cavalry as a private. \"Stay\r\nwith me and the children,\" I implored.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"I had something to do with bringing on this war. I must\r\ngive myself to Virginia. She needs the help of all her sons. If there\r\nare too many brigadier-generals in the service,—it may be so,—certain\r\nit is there are not enough private soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nBut his hour had passed. He kissed his sleeping boys and hurried off\r\nto the stage that was to take him to the depot. There John was waiting\r\nwith his horses (he never accepted anything but a soldier's ration from\r\nthe government), and they were off to join Fitzhugh Lee.\r\n\r\nThe Divinity that \"rules our ends, rough hew them as we may,\" was\r\nguiding him. I look back with gratitude to these circumstances,—then so\r\nhard to bear,—circumstances to which, I am persuaded, I owe my husband's\r\nlife. Even were it otherwise, God forbid I should admit into my bosom\r\nhard thoughts of any man.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee welcomed him in hearty fashion:—\r\n\r\n                                    \"HEADQUARTERS, August 26, 1863.\r\n\r\n     \"_Honorable, General, or Mr._: How shall I address you? Damn\r\n     it, there's no difference! Come up to see me. Whilst I regret\r\n     the causes that induced you to resign your position, I am glad\r\n     that the country has not lost your active services, and that\r\n     your choice to serve her has been cast in one of my regiments.\r\n\r\n                                             \"Very respectfully,\r\n                                                         \"FITZ LEE.\"\r\n\r\nAs a common soldier in the cavalry service, General Pryor was assigned\r\nthe duties of his position, from not one of which did he ever excuse\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nHaving no longer a home of my own, it was decided that I should go to my\r\npeople in Charlotte County. One of my sons, Theo, and two of my little\r\ndaughters were already there, and there I expected to remain until the\r\nend of the war.\r\n\r\nBut repeated attempts to reach my country home resulted in failure.\r\nMarauding parties and guerillas were flying all over the country. There\r\nhad been alarm at a bridge over the Staunton near \"The Oaks,\" and the\r\nold men and boys had driven away the enemy. I positively _could_ not\r\nventure alone.\r\n\r\nSo it was decided that I should return to my husband's old district, to\r\nPetersburg, and there find board in some private family.\r\n\r\nI reached Petersburg in the autumn and wandered about for days seeking\r\nrefuge in some household. Many of my old friends had left town.\r\nStrangers and refugees had rented the houses of some of these, while\r\nothers were filled with the homeless among their own kindred. There was\r\nno room anywhere for me, and my small purse was growing so slender that\r\nI became anxious. Finally my brother-in-law offered me an overseer's\r\nhouse on one of his \"quarters.\" The small dwelling he placed at my\r\ndisposal was to be considered temporary only; some one of his town\r\nhouses might soon be vacant. When I drove out to the little house, I\r\nfound it hardly better than a hovel. We entered a rude, unplastered\r\nkitchen, the planks of the floor loose and wide apart, the earth beneath\r\nplainly visible. There were no windows in this smoke-blackened kitchen.\r\nA door opened into a tiny room with a fireplace, window, and out-door\r\nof its own; and a short flight of stairs led to an unplastered attic,\r\nso that the little apartment was entered by two doors and a staircase.\r\nIt was already cold, but we had to beat a hasty retreat and sit outside\r\nwhile a negro boy made a \"smudge\" in the house, to dislodge the wasps\r\nthat had tenanted it for many months. My brother had lent me bedding\r\nfor the overseer's pine bedstead and the low trundle-bed underneath.\r\nThe latter, when drawn out at night, left no room for us to stand.\r\nWhen that was done, we had all to go to bed. For furniture we had only\r\ntwo or three wooden chairs and a small table. There were no curtains,\r\nneither carpet nor rugs, and no china. There was wood at the woodpile,\r\nand a little store of meal and rice, with a small bit of bacon in the\r\noverseer's grimy closet. This was to be my winter home.\r\n\r\nPetersburg was already virtually in a state of siege. Not a tithe of\r\nthe food needed for its army of refugees could be brought to the city.\r\nOur highway, the river, was filled, except for a short distance, with\r\nFederal gunboats. The markets had long been closed. The stores of\r\nprovisions had been exhausted, so that a grocery could offer little\r\nexcept a barrel or two of molasses made from the domestic sorghum\r\nsugar-cane, an acrid and unwholesome sweet used instead of sugar for\r\ndrink with water or milk and for eating with bread. The little boys\r\nat once began to keep house. They valiantly attacked the woodpile, and\r\nfound favor in the eyes of Mary and the man, whom I never knew as other\r\nthan \"Mary's husband.\" He and Mary were left in charge of the quarter\r\nand had a cabin near us.\r\n\r\nI had no books, no newspapers, no means of communicating with the\r\noutside world; but I had one neighbor, Mrs. Laighton, a daughter of\r\nWinston Henry, granddaughter of Patrick Henry. She lived near me with\r\nher husband—a Northern man. Both were very cultivated, very poor, very\r\nkind. Mrs. Laighton, as Lucy Henry,—a brilliant young girl,—I had last\r\nseen at one of her mother's gay house-parties in Charlotte County. We\r\nhad much in common, and her kind heart went out in love and pity for\r\nme. Her talk was a tonic to me. It stimulated me to play my part with\r\ncourage, seeing I had been deemed worthy, by the God who made me, to\r\nsuffer in this sublime struggle for liberty. She was as truly gifted\r\nas was ever her illustrious grandfather. To hear her was to believe, so\r\npersuasive and convincing was her eloquence.\r\n\r\nI had not my good Eliza Page this winter. She had fallen ill. I had\r\na stout little black girl, Julia, as my only servant; but Mary had a\r\nfriend, a \"corn-field hand,\" \"Anarchy,\" who managed to help me at odd\r\nhours. Mrs. Laighton sent me every morning a print of butter as large\r\nas a silver dollar, with two or three perfect biscuits, and sometimes a\r\nbowl of persimmons or stewed dried peaches. She had a cow, and churned\r\nevery day, making her biscuits of the buttermilk, which was much too\r\nprecious to drink.\r\n\r\nA great snow-storm overtook us a day or two before Christmas. My\r\nlittle boys kindled a roaring fire in the cold, open kitchen, roasted\r\nchestnuts, and set traps for the rabbits and \"snowbirds,\" which never\r\nentered them. They made no murmur at the bare Christmas; they were loyal\r\nlittle fellows to their mother. My day had been spent in mending their\r\ngarments,—making them was a privilege denied me, for I had no materials.\r\nI was not \"all unhappy!\" The rosy cheeks at my fireside consoled me for\r\nmy privations, and something within me proudly rebelled against weakness\r\nor complaining.\r\n\r\nThe flakes were falling thickly at midnight on Christmas Eve when I\r\nsuddenly became very ill. I sent out for Mary's husband and bade him\r\ngallop in to Petersburg, three miles distant, and fetch me Dr. Withers.\r\nI was dreadfully ill when he arrived, and as he stood at the foot of\r\nmy bed, I said to him: \"It doesn't matter much for me, Doctor! But my\r\nhusband will be grateful if you keep me alive.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke from a long sleep, he was still standing at the foot of\r\nmy bed where I had left him—it seemed to me ages ago! I put out my hand\r\nand it touched a little warm bundle beside me. God had given me a dear\r\nchild!\r\n\r\nThe doctor spoke to me gravely and most kindly. \"I must leave you now,\"\r\nhe said, \"and, alas! I cannot come again. There are so many, so many\r\nsick. Call all your courage to your aid. Remember the pioneer women,\r\nand all they were able to survive. This woman,\" indicating Anarchy,\r\n\"is a field-hand, but she is a mother, and she has agreed to help you\r\nduring the Christmas holidays—her own time. And now, God bless you, and\r\ngood-by!\"\r\n\r\nI soon slept again, and when I awoke, the very Angel of Strength and\r\nPeace had descended and abode with me. I resolved to prove to myself\r\nthat if I was called to be a great woman, I _could_ be a great woman.\r\nLooking at me from my bedside were my two little boys. They had been\r\ntaken the night before across the snow-laden fields to my brother's\r\nhouse, but had risen at daybreak and had \"come home to take care\" of me!\r\n\r\nMy little maid Julia left me Christmas morning. She said it was too\r\nlonesome, and her \"mistis\" always let her choose her own places. I\r\nengaged \"Anarchy\" at twenty-five dollars a week for all her nights.\r\nBut her hands, knotted by work in the fields, were too rough to touch\r\nmy babe. I was propped up on pillows and dressed her myself, sometimes\r\nfainting when the exertion was over.\r\n\r\nI was still in my bed three weeks afterward, when one of my boys ran\r\nin, exclaiming in a frightened voice, \"Oh, mamma, an old gray soldier\r\nis coming in!\"\r\n\r\nHe stood—this old gray soldier—and looked at me, leaning on his sabre.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the reward my country gives me?\" he said; and not until he\r\nspoke did I recognize my husband. Turning on his heel, he went out, and\r\nI heard him call:—\r\n\r\n\"John! John! Take those horses into town and sell them! Do not return\r\nuntil you do so—sell them for anything! Get a cart and bring butter,\r\neggs, and everything you can find for Mrs. Pryor's comfort.\"\r\n\r\nHe had been with Fitz Lee on that dreadful tramp through the snow after\r\nAverill. He had suffered cold and hunger, had slept on the ground\r\nwithout shelter, sharing his blanket with John. He had used his own\r\nhorses, and now if the government needed him, the government might mount\r\nhim. He had no furlough, and soon reported for duty; but not before he\r\nhad moved us, early in January, into town—one of my brother-in-law's\r\nhouses having been vacated at the beginning of the year. John knew his\r\nmaster too well to construe him literally, and had reserved the fine\r\ngray, Jubal Early, for his use. That I might not again fall into the\r\nsad plight in which he had found me, he purchased three hundred dollars\r\nin gold, and instructed me to prepare a girdle to be worn all the time\r\naround my waist, concealed by my gown. The coins were quilted in; each\r\nhad a separate section to itself, so that with scissors I might extract\r\none at a time without disturbing the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in June the two armies of Grant and Lee confronted each other at\r\nPetersburg. My dear general had bidden a silent and most sad farewell\r\nto his little family and gone forth to join his company, when my father\r\nentered with great news. \"I have just met General Lee in the street.\"\r\n\"Passing through?\" I asked. \"Not at all! The lines are established just\r\nhere and filled with his veterans.\" My general soon reëntered joyfully.\r\nHe would now be on duty near us.\r\n\r\nThe next Sunday a shell fell in the Presbyterian Church opposite our\r\nhouse. From that moment we were shelled at intervals, and very severely.\r\nThere were no soldiers in the city. Women were killed on the lower\r\nstreets, and an exodus from the shelled districts commenced at once.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the enemy brought up his siege guns of heavy artillery,\r\nthey opened on the city with shell without the slightest notice, or\r\nwithout giving opportunity for the removal of non-combatants, the sick,\r\nthe wounded, or the women and children. The fire was at first directed\r\ntoward the Old Market, presumably because of the railroad depot situated\r\nthere, about which the soldiers might be supposed to collect. But the\r\nguns soon enlarged their operations, sweeping all the streets in the\r\nbusiness part of the city, and then invading the residential region.\r\nThe steeples of the churches seemed to afford targets for their fire,\r\nall of them coming in finally for a share of the compliment.\r\n\r\nTo persons unfamiliar with the infernal noise made by the screaming,\r\nricocheting, and bursting of shells, it is impossible to convey an\r\nadequate idea of the terror and demoralization which ensued. Some\r\nfamilies who could not leave the besieged city dug holes in the ground,\r\nfive or six feet deep, covered with heavy timber banked over with\r\nearth, the entrance facing opposite the batteries from which the shells\r\nwere fired. They made these bomb-proofs safe, at least, and thither\r\nthe family repaired when heavy shelling commenced. General Lee seemed\r\nto recognize that no part of the city was safe, for he immediately\r\nordered the removal of all the hospitals, under the care of Petersburg's\r\nesteemed physician, Dr. John Herbert Claiborne. There were three\r\nthousand sick and wounded, many of them too ill to be moved. Everything\r\nthat could run on wheels, from a dray to a wheelbarrow, was pressed into\r\nservice by the fleeing inhabitants of the town. A long, never ending\r\nline passed my door until there were no more to pass.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle fascinated my children, and they lived in the open\r\nwatching it. One day my little friend Nannie with my baby, nearly as\r\nlarge as herself, in her arms, stood at the gate when a shell fell some\r\ndistance from them. A mounted officer drew rein and accosted her. \"Whose\r\nchildren are these?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Charles Campbell's daughter,\" said little Nannie, \"and\r\nthis\"—indicating the baby—\"is General Pryor's child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Run home with General Pryor's baby, little girl, away from the shells,\"\r\nhe said, and turning as he rode off, \"My love to your father. I'm coming\r\nto see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is that man?\" little Nannie inquired of a bystander.\r\n\r\n\"Why, don't you know? That's General Lee!\"\r\n\r\nWe soon learned the peculiar deep boom of the one great gun which bore\r\ndirectly upon us. The boys named it \"Long Tom.\" Sometimes for several\r\nweeks \"Long Tom\" rested or slept—and would then make up for lost time.\r\nAnd yet we yielded to no panic. The children seemed to understand that\r\nit would be cowardly to complain. One little girl cried out with fright\r\nat an explosion, but her aunt, Mrs. Gibson, called her and said: \"My\r\ndear, you cannot make it harder for other people! If you feel very much\r\nafraid, come to me, and I will take you in my arms, but you mustn't\r\ncry.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Campbell, the historian, lived near us, at the Anderson\r\nSeminary. He cleared out the large coal cellar, which was fortunately\r\ndry, spread rugs on the floor, and furnished it with lounges and chairs.\r\nThere we took refuge in utter darkness when the firing was unbearable.\r\nMy next-door neighbor, Mr. Thomas Branch, piled bags of sand around his\r\nhouse and thus made it bomb-proof. One day a shell struck one of my\r\nchimneys and buried itself, hissing, at the front door. Away we went\r\nto Mr. Campbell's bomb-proof cellar, and there we remained until the\r\nparoxysmal shelling ceased.\r\n\r\nOne night, after a long, hot day, we were so tired we slept soundly. I\r\nwas awakened by Eliza Page, standing trembling beside me. She pulled me\r\nout of bed and hurriedly turned to throw blankets around the children.\r\nThe furies were let loose! The house was shaking with the concussion\r\nfrom the heavy guns. We were in the street, on our way to our bomb-proof\r\ncellar, when a shell burst not more than twenty-five feet before us.\r\nFire and fragments rose like a fountain in the air and fell in a shower\r\naround us. Not one of my little family was hurt—and strange to say, the\r\nchildren were not terrified!\r\n\r\nAnother time a shell fell in our own yard and buried itself in the\r\nearth. My baby was not far away in her nurse's arms. The little creature\r\nwas fascinated by the shells. The first word she ever uttered was an\r\nattempt to imitate them. \"Yonder comes that bird with the broken wing,\"\r\nthe servants would say. The shells made a fluttering sound as they\r\ntraversed the air, descending with a frightful hiss. When they exploded\r\nin mid-air, a puff of smoke, white as an angel's wing, would drift\r\naway, and the particles would patter down like hail. At night the track\r\nof the shell and its explosion were precisely similar to our Fourth of\r\nJuly rockets, except that they were fired, not upward, but in a slanting\r\ndirection,—not aimed at the stars, but aimed at us! I never felt afraid\r\nof them! I was brought up to believe in predestination. Courage, after\r\nall, is much a matter of nerves. My neighbors, Mr. and Mrs. Gibson,\r\nMrs. Meade, and Mr. and Mrs. Campbell, agreed with me, and we calmly\r\nelected to remain in town. There was no place of safety accessible to\r\nus. Mr. Branch removed his family, and, as far as I knew, none other of\r\nmy friends remained throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nNot far from our own door ran a sunken street, with the hill, through\r\nwhich it was cut, rising each side of it. Into this hill the negroes\r\nburrowed, hollowing out a small space, where they sat all day on mats,\r\nknitting, singing, and selling small cakes made of sorghum and flour,\r\nand little round meat pies.\r\n\r\nThe antiphonal songs, with their weird melody, still linger in my\r\nmemory. At night above the dull roar of the guns, the keen hiss of the\r\nshells as they fell, the rattle and rumble of the army wagons, a strong\r\nvoice from the colony of hillside huts would ring out:—\r\n\r\n                   \"My brederin do-o-n't be weary,\r\n                     De angel brought de tidin's down.\r\n                   Do-o-n't be weary\r\n                     For we're gwine home!\r\n\r\n                   \"I want to go to heaven!\r\n     (_Answer_) Yas, my Lawd!\r\n                   I want to see my Jesus!\r\n     (_Answer_) Yas, my Lawd!\r\n\r\n     (_Chorus_) My brederin do-o-n't be weary,\r\n                     De angel brought de tidin's down.\r\n                   Do-o-n't be weary\r\n                     For we're gwine home.\"\r\n\r\nThe sorghum cakes were made to perfection in our own kitchen, but the\r\nmeat pies were fascinating. I might have been tempted to invest in them\r\nbut for a slight circumstance. I saw a dead mule lying on the common,\r\nand out of its side had been cut a very neat, square chunk of flesh!\r\n\r\nWith all our starvation we never ate rats, mice, or mule meat. We\r\nmanaged to exist on peas, bread, and sorghum. We could buy a little\r\nmilk, and we mixed it with a drink made from roasted and ground corn.\r\nThe latter, in the grain, was scarce. Mr. Campbell's children picked up\r\nthe grains wherever the army horses were fed, washed, dried, and pounded\r\nthem for food.\r\n\r\nMy little boys never complained, but Theo, who had insisted upon\r\nreturning to me from his uncle's safe home in the country, said one day:\r\n\"Mamma, I have a queer feeling in my stomach! Oh, no! it doesn't ache\r\nthe least bit, but it feels like a nutmeg grater.\"\r\n\r\nPoor little laddie! His machinery needed oiling. And pretty soon his\r\nsmall brother fell ill with fever. My blessed Dr. Withers obtained a\r\npermit for me to get a pint of soup every day from the hospital, and\r\none day there was a joyful discovery. In the soup was a drumstick of\r\nchicken!\r\n\r\n\"I cert'nly hope I'll not get well,\" the little man shocked me by saying.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it as bad as that?\" I sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he replied, \"my soup will be stopped if I get better!\"\r\n\r\nJust at this juncture, when things were as bad as could be, my husband\r\nbrought home to tea the Hon. Pierre Soulé, General D. H. Hill, and\r\nGeneral Longstreet. I had bread and a little tea, the latter served in\r\na yellow pitcher without a handle. Mrs. Meade, hearing of my necessity,\r\nsent me a small piece of bacon. I had known Mr. Soulé in Washington\r\nsociety—of all men the most fastidious, most polished. When we assembled\r\naround the table, I lifted my hot pitcher by means of a napkin, and\r\noffered my tea, pure and simple, allowing the guests to use their\r\ndiscretion in regard to a spoonful or two of dark brown sugar.\r\n\r\n\"This is a great luxury, madam,\" said Mr. Soulé, with one of his\r\ngracious bows, \"a good cup of tea.\"\r\n\r\nWe talked that night of all that was going wrong with our country, of\r\nthe good men who were constantly relieved of their commands, of all the\r\nmistakes we were making.\r\n\r\n\"Mistakes!\" said General Hill, bringing his clenched fist down upon the\r\ntable, \"I could forgive mistakes! I cannot forgive lies! I could get\r\nalong if we could _only_, _only_ ever learn the truth, the real truth.\"\r\nBut he was very personal and used much stronger words than these.\r\n\r\nThe pictures my general had brought from Europe had been sent early\r\nfrom Washington to Petersburg, and I had opened one of the boxes which\r\ncontained a large etching of Michelangelo's \"Last Judgment.\" General\r\nLongstreet stood long before this picture, as it hung in our living\r\nroom. Turning to Mr. Soulé and General Hill he exclaimed: \"Oh, what does\r\nit all signify? _Here_ is the end for every one of us!\"—the end of all\r\nthe strife, the bloodshed, the bitterness—the final victory or defeat.\r\n\r\nThey talked and talked, these veterans and the charming, accomplished\r\ndiplomat, until one of them inquired the hour. I raised a curtain.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"the sun is rising. You must now breakfast with\r\nus.\" They declined. They had supped!\r\n\r\nIn the terrible fight at Port Walthall near Petersburg, my husband\r\nrendered essential service. Among the few papers I preserved in a secret\r\ndrawer of the only trunk I saved, were two, one signed Bushrod Johnson,\r\nthe other D. H. Hill. The latter says: \"The victory at Walthall Junction\r\nwas greatly due to General Roger A. Pryor. But for him it is probable we\r\nmight have been surprised and defeated.\" The other from General Johnson\r\nruns at length: \"At the most critical juncture General Roger A. Pryor\r\nrendered me most valuable service, displaying great zeal, energy, and\r\ngallantry in reconnoitring the positions of the enemy, arranging my\r\nline of battle, and rendering successful the operations and movements of\r\nthe conflict.\" At General Johnson's request my husband served with him\r\nduring the midsummer. Such letters I have in lieu of medal or ribbon,—a\r\npart only of much of similar nature; but less was given to many a man\r\nwho as fully deserved recognition.\r\n\r\nHaving been in active service in all the events around Petersburg, my\r\nhusband was now requested by General Lee to take with him a small squad\r\nof men, and learn something of the movements of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Grant knows all about me,\" he said, \"and I know too little about Grant.\r\nYou were a school-boy here, General, and have hunted in all the by-paths\r\naround Petersburg. Knowing the country better than any of us, you are\r\nthe best man for this important duty.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, armed with a pass from General Lee, my husband set forth\r\non his perilous scouting expeditions, sometimes being absent a week at a\r\ntime. During these scouting trips he had had adventures, narrow escapes,\r\nand also some opportunities for gratifying, what has ever been the\r\ncontrolling principle of his nature, the desire to help the unfortunate.\r\nOnce he brought me early in the morning three or four prisoners under\r\nguard, and as he passed me on his way to snatch an hour's sleep, he\r\ncalmly ordered, \"Be sure to feed them well.\"\r\n\r\nI find in an unpublished diary of Charles Campbell, the historian, this\r\nitem: \"I met Mrs. Pryor on her way to the commissary, with a small tin\r\npail in her hand. She said she was going for her daily ration of meal.\"\r\nThis \"daily ration\" for which I paid three dollars was all I had, except\r\nbeans and sorghum, and John openly rebelled when ordered to serve it\r\nin loaves to my prisoners. However, he was overruled, and with perfect\r\ngood humor my little boys acquiesced, gave up their own breakfast, and\r\nserved the prisoners.\r\n\r\nNo farmer dared venture within the lines—no fish were in the streams,\r\nno game in the woods around the town. The cannonading had driven them\r\naway. There was no longer a market in Petersburg. I once, under shell\r\nfire, visited the Old Market. At the end of a table upon which cakes and\r\njugs of sorghum molasses were exhibited, an aged negro offered a frozen\r\ncabbage!\r\n\r\nThe famine moved on apace, but its twin sister, fever, rarely visited\r\nus. Never had Petersburg been so healthy. Every particle of animal\r\nor vegetable food was consumed, and the streets were clean. Flocks of\r\npigeons would follow the children who were eating bread or crackers.\r\nFinally the pigeons vanished, having been themselves eaten. Rats\r\nand mice disappeared. The poor cats staggered about the streets, and\r\nbegan to die of hunger. At times meal was the only article attainable,\r\nexcept by the rich. An ounce of meat daily was considered an abundant\r\nration for each member of the family. To keep food of any kind was\r\nimpossible—cows, pigs, bacon, flour, everything was stolen, and even\r\nsitting hens were taken from the nest.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of such facts as these General Lee was able to report\r\nthat nearly every regiment in his army had reënlisted—and for the war!\r\nAnd very soon he also reported that the army was out of meat and had\r\nbut one day's rations of bread! One of our papers copied the following\r\nfrom the _Mobile Advertiser_:—\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GENERAL ROBERT E. LEE IN 1861.]\r\n\r\n     \"In General Lee's tent meat is eaten but twice a week,\r\n     the general not allowing it oftener, because he believes\r\n     indulgence in meat to be criminal in the present straitened\r\n     condition of the country. His ordinary dinner consists of\r\n     a head of cabbage boiled in salt water and a pone of corn\r\n     bread. Having invited a number of gentlemen to dine with him,\r\n     General Lee, in a fit of extravagance, ordered a sumptuous\r\n     repast of bacon and cabbage. The dinner was served, and\r\n     behold, a great sea of cabbage and a small island of bacon,\r\n     or 'middling,' about four inches long and two inches across.\r\n     The guests, with commendable politeness, unanimously declined\r\n     the bacon, and it remained in the dish untouched. Next day\r\n     General Lee, remembering the delicate titbit which had been\r\n     so providentially preserved, ordered his servant to bring that\r\n     'middling.' The man hesitated, scratched his head, and finally\r\n     owned up:—\r\n\r\n     \"'Marse Robert,—de fac' is,—dat ar middlin' was borrowed\r\n     middlin'. We-all didn' have no middlin'. I done paid it back\r\n     to de place whar I got it fum.'\r\n\r\n     \"General Lee heaved a sigh of disappointment, and pitched into\r\n     the cabbage.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in the autumn flour sold for $1500 a barrel, bacon $20 a pound,\r\nbeef ditto, a chicken could be bought for $50, shad $5.50 a pair—the\r\nhead of a bullock, horns and all, could be purchased, as a favor, from\r\nthe commissary for $5. Groceries soared out of sight. I once counted\r\nin a soldier's ration eight grains of coffee! Little by little I drew\r\nfrom the belt of gold I wore around my waist, receiving towards the last\r\none hundred dollars for one dollar in gold. These were anxious times,\r\ndifficult times—but they were not the worst times! We still had hope.\r\nAny day, any hour might bring us victory and consequently relief. We had\r\nthe blessed boon of comradeship. _Una et commune periclum, una salus!_\r\nNoble spirits were all around us, strong in faith and hope. Discouraging\r\nwords were never uttered when we talked together.\r\n\r\nMy neighbor, Mrs. Meade and her daughters, were delightful friends,\r\ncheerful always. Soldiers were not allowed to wander about the streets,\r\nbut one day I saw Mary Meade pause at her gate, just across the narrow\r\nstreet, and speak to one of them. \"Do you know what he was asking me?\"\r\nshe ran over to say. \"Isn't it too funny? A soldier with his gun on his\r\nshoulder wanted to know if we kept a dog, and if he could safely take\r\na drink from the well!\" A number of Englishmen hung about our camps\r\nnear the close of the war. They were very agreeable, and while with\r\nus intensely Southern. I delighted in one who had hired rooms in Mrs.\r\nMeade's \"office\" opposite. He was so ardent a secessionist we honored\r\nhim with the usual Southern title of \"Colonel.\" He came over one morning\r\nin great indignation: \"Oh, I say, it's a bit beastly of General Grant\r\nto frighten Mrs. Meade! It's a jolly shame to fire big shells into a\r\nlady's garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do, Colonel, if your chimney should be knocked off as\r\nmine was last week?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\"—thoughtfully,—\"I guess I'd toddle.\"\r\n\r\nThe time came when I felt that I could no longer endure the strain of\r\nbeing perpetually under fire, and to my great relief, my brother-in-law,\r\nRobert McIlwaine, removed his family to North Carolina, and placed\r\nCottage Farm, three miles distant from the city, at my disposal. He had\r\nleft a piano and some furniture in the house, and was glad to have me\r\nlive in it.\r\n\r\nI had been in this refuge only a few days, happy in the blessed respite\r\nfrom danger, when I learned that General Lee had established his\r\nheadquarters a short distance from us.\r\n\r\nThe whole face of the earth seemed to change immediately. Army wagons\r\ncrawled unceasingly in a fog of dust along the highroad, just in front\r\nof our gate. All was stir and life in the rear, where there was another\r\ncountry road, and a short road connecting the two passed immediately\r\nby the well near our house. This, too, was constantly travelled; the\r\nwhir of the well-wheel never seemed to pause, day or night. We soon had\r\npleasant visitors, General A. P. Hill, Colonel William Pegram, General\r\nWalker, General Wilcox, and others. General Wilcox, an old friend and\r\ncomrade, craved permission to make his headquarters on the green lawn\r\nin the rear of the house, and my husband rejoiced at his presence and\r\nprotection for our little family.\r\n\r\nIn less than twenty-four hours I found myself in the centre of a camp.\r\nThe white tents of General Wilcox's staff-officers were stretched close\r\nto the door. \"We are here for eight years—not a day less,\" said my\r\nfather, and he fully believed it. This being the case, we brought all\r\nour boxes from town, unpacked the library and set it up on shelves,\r\nunpacked and hung our pictures. I hung the \"Madonna della Seggiola\" over\r\nthe mantel in the parlor and Guido's \"Aurora\" over the piano. There\r\nwas a baby house in one of the boxes and a trunk of evening dresses\r\nat which I did not even glance, but stored in the cellar. Everything\r\nlooked so cosey and homelike, we were happier than we had been in a\r\nlong time. That my infant should not starve, I bought a little cow,\r\nRose, from a small planter in the neighborhood, for a liberal sum\r\nin gold from my belt. \"We mus' all help one another these times,\" he\r\nobserved complacently. Rose was a great treasure. My general's horse,\r\nJubal Early, was required to share his rations with her—indeed, poor\r\nJubal's allowance of corn was sometimes beaten into hominy for all of\r\nus. John at once built a shelter close to his own room for Rose, \"'cause\r\nI knows soldiers! They gits up fo' day and milk yo' cow right under yo'\r\neyelids. When we-all was in Pennsylvania, the ole Dutch farmers used to\r\ngive Gen'al Lee Hail Columbia 'cause his soldiers milked their cows.\r\nBut Lawd! Gen'al Lee couldn' help it! He could keep 'em from stealin'\r\nhorses, but the queen of England herself couldn' stop a soldier when he\r\nhankers after milk. An' he don't need no pail, neither; he can milk in\r\nhis canteen an' never spill a drop.\"\r\n\r\nJohn and the boys were in fine spirits. They laid plans for chickens,\r\npigeons, and pigs—none of which were realized, except the latter, which\r\nI persuaded a butcher to give me for one or two of the general's silk\r\nvests. As we were to be here \"for eight years, no less,\" it behooved\r\nme to look after the little boys' education. School books were found\r\nfor them. I knew \"small Latin and less Greek,\" but I gravely heard them\r\nrecite lessons in the former; and they never discovered the midnight\r\ndarkness of my mind as to mathematics. As to the pigs, I had almost\r\nobtained my own consent to convert them into sausages when I was spared\r\nthe pain of signing their death warrant by their running away!\r\n\r\nI knew nothing of the strong line of fortifications which General Grant\r\nwas building at the back of the farm, fortifications strengthened by\r\nforts at short intervals. Our own line—visible from the garden—had fewer\r\nforts, two of which, Fort Gregg and Battery 45, protected our immediate\r\nneighborhood. These forts occasionally answered a challenge, but there\r\nwas no attempt at a sally on either side.\r\n\r\nThe most painful circumstance connected with our position was the picket\r\nfiring at night, incessant, like the dropping of hail, and harrowing\r\nfrom the apprehension that many a man fell from the fire of a picket.\r\nBut, perhaps to reassure me, Captain Lindsay and Captain Clover, of\r\nGeneral Wilcox's staff, declared that \"pickets have a good time. They\r\nfire, yes, for that is their business; but while they load for the next\r\nvolley, one will call out, 'Hello, Reb,' be answered, 'Hello, Yank,'\r\nand little parcels of coffee are thrown across in exchange for a plug\r\nof tobacco.\" After accepting this fiction I could have made myself\r\neasy, but for my constant anxiety about the safety of my dear general.\r\nHe was now employed day and night, often in peril, gleaning from every\r\npossible source information for General Lee. While absent on one of\r\nthese scouting trips, he once met a lady who, with her children, was\r\nvainly trying to pass through the lines that she might return to her\r\nhome at the North. Two years ago he received the following pleasant\r\nletter:—\r\n\r\n                         \"REPRESENTATIVE HALL,\r\n                              \"29th SESSION\r\n                         \"NEBRASKA LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n                                             \"LINCOLN, 3/19th, 1907.\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Judge Pryor,\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot resist the desire I have to write you concerning\r\n     an incident of the war, in which you played such a noble and\r\n     splendid part. You may have forgotten Mrs. Mary C. Burgess,\r\n     whom, with three little children, you escorted with much\r\n     personal risk through from the Confederate picket line to\r\n     the Union line. You took two scouts. Each took a child on his\r\n     horse, Mrs. Burgess walking. You stopped in a ravine and told\r\n     Mrs. Burgess to go into the open field to the right where she\r\n     would see a man on a gray horse to the left, she to signal\r\n     this man, who would command her to come to him. She did so,\r\n     and then came back after the children. You bade Mrs. Burgess\r\n     good-by. She took the children and went again to the man on\r\n     horseback. He took her to General Meade's headquarters, where\r\n     she got orders to go to City Point, where she was detained\r\n     two weeks, General Grant being absent, and she could go no\r\n     farther without General Grant's orders. You will remember\r\n     how Mrs. Burgess was sent to Mrs. Cumming's house with an\r\n     escort of cavalry and infantry with a flag of truce. They\r\n     were suspicious of the attention paid Mrs. Burgess, and at\r\n     first were inclined to treat her as a spy. But after many\r\n     hardships Mrs. Burgess finally reached New York and friends.\r\n     Mrs. Burgess is my mother-in-law; is living with me; is\r\n     the same dignified, cultivated lady whom you may remember.\r\n     She is now in her seventy-fourth year. The splendid acts of\r\n     kindness shown by you to her and the three children no doubt\r\n     saved their lives. Mother Burgess sits here and wants you to\r\n     know you occupy a lifelong place in her memory. For myself\r\n     and all the family, I wish to say to you, Judge Pryor, that\r\n     the English language does not contain words to express our\r\n     admiration for your bravery, and our thankfulness to you for\r\n     protecting the lone woman and children and the magnificent\r\n     chivalry that prompted you like a true knight, which you are,\r\n     to go to their rescue. I hope to have the honor and pleasure\r\n     of seeing you and shaking your hand. With kindest of personal\r\n     regard to you and all dear to you, I beg to remain,\r\n\r\n                                     \"Yours sincerely,\r\n                                          \"H.

My venerable father, Dr. Pryor, had departed on his daily rounds\r\nto visit the sick and wounded in the hospitals, and my husband was\r\naway on special duty for General Lee. John had reported early with\r\none cupful of milk—all that little Rose, with her slender rations, was\r\ncapable of yielding. This we had boiled with parched corn and sweetened\r\nwith sorghum molasses. With perfect biscuits well beaten but unmixed\r\nwith lard or butter we made a breakfast with which we were contented.\r\nI indulged myself in a long letter to my dear aunt, telling her of our\r\ncomfortable home and the prospect of comparative quiet with the army\r\nsoon to go into winter quarters. I had addressed my letter and was\r\nabout to seal it when General Wilcox entered, and gently told me that\r\nmy husband had been captured the day before!\r\n\r\nI remember perfectly that I sat for a moment stunned into silence,\r\nand then quietly stamped my letter! I would spare my aunt the sad news\r\nfor a while. In a few minutes clanking spurs at the door announced the\r\npresence of a staff-officer.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" he said respectfully, \"General Lee sends you his affectionate\r\nsympathies.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the window I saw General Lee on his horse, Traveller, standing\r\nat the well. He waited until his messenger returned—I was too much\r\novercome to speak—and then rode slowly towards the lines.\r\n\r\nI had small hope of the speedy exchange promised me by General Wilcox.\r\nFrom day to day he reported the efforts made for my husband's release\r\nand their failure. General Lee authorized a letter to General Meade,\r\ndetailing the circumstances of his capture and requesting his release.\r\nGeneral Meade promptly refused to release him.\r\n\r\nWe naturally looked to the enemy for all information, and although my\r\nhusband had written me a pencilled note at City Point on the inside\r\nof a Confederate envelope, and had implored his guard (a Federal\r\nofficer) to have it inserted in a New York paper, I did not receive it\r\nuntil thirty-one years afterward. We soon had news, however, through a\r\ndespatch from the Northern army to the _New York Herald_. The paper of\r\nNovember 30, 1864, contained the following:—\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday a rebel officer made his appearance in front of our\r\nlines, waving a paper for exchange. The officer in charge of the\r\npicket, suddenly remembering that Major Burrage, of the Thirty-sixth\r\nMassachusetts, was taken prisoner some time since by the enemy while on\r\na similar errand, 'gobbled' the rebel, who proved to be the famous Roger\r\nA. Pryor, ex-member of Congress and ex-brigadier-general of Jeff Davis's\r\narmy. He protested vehemently against what he styled 'a flagrant breach\r\nof faith' on our part. He was assured he was taken in retaliation for\r\nlike conduct on the part of his friends, and sent to General Meade's\r\nheadquarters for further disposition.\"\r\n\r\nPress despatch to _Herald_, November 30, from Washington: \"Roger A.\r\nPryor has been brought to Washington and committed to the old Capitol\r\nPrison.\" Later a personal through the _New York News_ reached me: \"Your\r\nhusband is in Fort Lafayette, where a friend and relative is permitted\r\nto visit him, (signed) Mary Rhodes.\" From an enormous quantity of\r\nletters, newspaper extracts, book notices, military reports, etc.,\r\ndescribing his capture written by the men who made it and witnessed it,\r\nI select an interesting one, not hitherto published, which my husband\r\nreceived recently through my brother, the Mayor of Bristol.\r\n\r\n                                    \"BRISTOL, TENN., July 10, 1908.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"HON. W. L. RICE, \"BRISTOL, VA.\r\n\r\n     \"_My dear Mayor_:—\r\n\r\n     \"I very cheerfully comply with your request to give you a\r\n     short sketch of the circumstances which led to my selection\r\n     as the Officer to convey Gen. R. A. Pryor to Fort Warren,\r\n     Mass., in 1864. As an aid to my memory I have hunted over my\r\n     old Army papers, and have found the original Order from the\r\n     Military Governor of Washington, D.C., and also the receipt\r\n     given me by Gen. Pryor for money which I turned over to him,\r\n     on delivering him to the Commandant of Fort Lafayette, N. Y.\r\n     Harbor, to which place my orders were afterwards changed and\r\n     which papers I herewith attach.\r\n\r\n     \"In November of 1864 my Regiment, the 39th Mass., was serving\r\n     in the defences of Washington, and I had been detailed as\r\n     an Aid on the staff of Gen. Martindale, then Commanding the\r\n     Military District of Washington. Having received a Leave of\r\n     Absence to visit my home in Mass., Col. T. McGowan, then Adjt.\r\n     General of the District, kindly offered to place a prisoner\r\n     in my charge and thus save to me my transportation. I did not\r\n     know who my prisoner was to be, until my orders were received,\r\n     and naturally felt pleased to find that my charge was to be\r\n     Gen. Roger A. Pryor, whom I had known by reputation from my\r\n     boyhood up.\r\n\r\n     \"Though my Orders read that I was to assist Brig. General\r\n     Wessels, I saw nothing of that gentleman until after\r\n     General Pryor and myself had reached and taken seats in the\r\n     train. Then Gen. Wessels made himself known, and asked an\r\n     introduction to Gen. Pryor.\r\n\r\n     \"It was 9.30 at night when left Washington, and we did not\r\n     reach New York until daylight next morning. When I received my\r\n     prisoner at the Old Capitol Prison, I recall that the Supt.,\r\n     one Colonel Wood advised me to iron my charge, alleging that\r\n     he was a dangerous man; but this I refused to do, taking only\r\n     Gen. Pryor's verbal parole that he would not attempt to escape\r\n     while in my custody. This Gen. Pryor cheerfully gave, and\r\n     religiously kept while with me. On arrival at Jersey City we\r\n     became in some way separated from Gen. Wessels, and crossed\r\n     over by the Cortlandt Street Ferry to New York. As the hour\r\n     was early we stopped for breakfast at the Courtland Street\r\n     Hotel, then quite a pretentious Hostelry. After breakfast,\r\n     and while preparing to leave the Hotel for the Qr. Mas. Gen.\r\n     Dept. where I was to find my orders and transportation, I was\r\n     surprised to find that the Rotunda of the Hotel was packed,\r\n     evidently with friends of Gen. Pryor and for a short time\r\n     it looked as if my prisoner would be taken from me, but the\r\n     Gen. directing me to take his arm, we passed through without\r\n     trouble. At the Quarter Master Genl's I found my orders\r\n     changed, and I was directed to convey my prisoner to Fort\r\n     Lafayette New York Harbor in place of Fort Warren Boston\r\n     Harbor. On arrival at Fort Lafayette we found Brig. Gen.\r\n     Wessels awaiting us, and with him we proceeded across the\r\n     ferry turning over our prisoner to Major Burke, Commandant at\r\n     that Fort, taking his receipt therefor.\r\n\r\n     \"At this distance of time (44 years) it would seem that these\r\n     occurrences must have passed from my memory, but I remember\r\n     with distinctness the appearance of the General, the incident\r\n     at the Old Capitol, the crowd in the Rotunda of the Cortlandt\r\n     Hotel, the miraculous passage through the sea of 'Red' faces\r\n     therein, and the appearance of Major Paddy Burke (a very old\r\n     Officer of the Old Army) to whose custody I transferred my\r\n     charge. I recall also the kind expressions of regard uttered\r\n     by General Pryor as we shook hands at parting and the promise\r\n     he extracted that should it be my fate to be wounded or a\r\n     prisoner in Richmond, during the war, that I would make myself\r\n     known to his family there residing, who would respond to\r\n     any appeal made by me. It was my fortune to pass through the\r\n     remaining months of the war without being captured, and never\r\n     severely wounded, so I did not have to call on the generosity\r\n     of a gallant foe, and I presume the memory of that journey\r\n     to New York, and the memory of the stripling Officer who\r\n     accompanied him on that journey, long ago passed from Judge\r\n     Pryor's memory, but I recall it as a pleasant episode in a\r\n     boy's life and I would wish, that in writing to the Judge,\r\n     you would kindly convey to him my sincere congratulations on\r\n     the honors he has attained, and the respect and love which he\r\n     has received in his declining years, and with kindest wishes\r\n     to yourself, believe me,\r\n\r\n                                              \"Very truly yours,\r\n                                                     \"WM.

Marshal.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived by the above that the Federal officers\r\ngranted their captured private the honor of escort by a Federal\r\ngeneral—Brigadier-general H. W. Wessels—and were inclined to confer upon\r\nhim the further distinction of \"irons.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was detained in Washington, Major Leary (or Captain) discovered\r\na plot to assassinate him, which he revealed to the prisoner, arranging\r\nfor his greater safety. Before he reached Fort Lafayette it appears\r\nhe was threatened with assassination and also rescue. Some kind\r\nfriend in Washington thrust into his overcoat pocket a bottle of\r\nbrandy. It was taken from him when his pockets were searched, along\r\nwith his letters and pistols, but returned by a Federal officer, who\r\nremarked,—recognizing the touch of nature which establishes the kinship\r\nof all men in all nations,—\"Keep it, General! There's an almighty sight\r\nof comfort in a bottle of brandy.\" The pistols were not returned and,\r\nalong with an army cape, are preserved—I have understood—in a museum of\r\nwar relics at Concord, Mass.\r\n\r\nA month elapsed before all the forms required by military law could be\r\nobserved in sending the letters of prisoners through the lines. At last\r\nColonel Ould forwarded to me a brief assurance of my dear captive's\r\nwelfare. He was confined in a casemate with twelve other prisoners.\r\nA grate held a small quantity of coal, and on this fire the captive\r\nsoldiers cooked their slender rations of meat. Their bread was furnished\r\nthem from a baker. They lay upon straw mats on the floor. They were glad\r\nof the rule compelling them to fetch up their fuel from the coal cellar,\r\nas it gave opportunity for exercise. Once daily they could walk upon\r\nthe ramparts, and my husband's eyes turned sadly to the dim outlines of\r\nthe beautiful city where he had often been an honored guest. The veil\r\nwhich hid from him so much of the grief and struggle of the future hid\r\nalso the reward. Little did he dream he should administer justice on\r\nthe supreme bench of the mist-veiled city.\r\n\r\nThe captives had no material except coal and water, but of the former\r\nthey manufactured seal rings (to be set when they regained their\r\nliberty), inlaying a polished ebony surface with bits from a silver\r\ncoin to represent tiny Confederate flags. One of these was given to\r\nmy general, and lost in the great hour of losses. With the coal as a\r\npencil, the prisoners indulged in caricatures of the commandant. Every\r\nmorning a fresh picture on the whitewashed wall met his eye: \"Burk as a\r\nbaby,\" \"Burk in his first pants,\" \"Burk in love,\" etc., etc. The reward\r\nwas the commandant's face when he saw them.\r\n\r\nAfter my husband's release, his place in the casemate was filled by\r\na \"stylish\" young officer who refused, absolutely, to submit to the\r\ndegradation of bringing up his quota of the coal.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" said \"old Burk,\" \"you are too great a man, are you, to fetch\r\nyour coal? I had General Pryor here. He brought up his coal! I think,\r\nsir, you'll bring up yours!\"\r\n\r\nBefore I take leave of my dear captive for the winter, I must record\r\nhis unvarying fortitude under much physical discomfort, cold, and food\r\nwhich almost destroyed him. On the 20th of December, I received a brief\r\nnote from Fort Lafayette: \"My philosophy begins to fail somewhat. In\r\nvain I seek some argument of consolation. I see no chance of release.\r\nThe conditions of my imprisonment cut me off from every resource of\r\nhappiness.\"\r\n\r\nI learned afterward that he was ill, and often under the care of a\r\nphysician during the winter, but he tried to write as encouragingly as\r\npossible. In February, however, he failed in health and spirits.\r\n\r\n\"I am as contented as is compatible with my condition. My mind is\r\nill at ease from my solicitude for my family and my country. Every\r\ndisaster pierces my soul like an arrow; and I am afflicted with the\r\nthought that I am denied the privilege of contributing even my mite\r\nto the deliverance of—. How I envy my old comrades their hardships\r\nand privations! I have little hope of an early exchange, and you may\r\nbe assured my mistrust is not without reason. _Except some special\r\ninstance be employed to procure my release, my detention here will be\r\nindefinite._ I cannot be more explicit. While this is my conviction,\r\nI wish it distinctly understood that I would not have my government\r\ncompromise any scruple for the sake of my liberation. I am prepared for\r\nany contingency—am fortified against any reverse of fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem now confronting me was this: how could I maintain my\r\nchildren and myself? My husband's rations were discontinued. I sent my\r\ngeneral's horse far into the interior, to be boarded with a farmer for\r\nhis services, as I had no possible means of feeding him. My only supply\r\nof food was from my father's ration as chaplain. I had a part of a\r\nbarrel of flour which a relative had sent me from a county now cut off\r\nfrom us. Quite a number of my old Washington servants had followed me,\r\nto escape the shelling, but they could not, of course, look to me for\r\ntheir support. My household included Eliza Page, Aunt Jinny, and Uncle\r\nFrank (old people and old settlers), and our faithful John. I frankly\r\ntold John and Eliza my condition, but they elected to remain.\r\n\r\nOne day John presented himself with a heart-broken countenance and a\r\ndrooping attitude of deep dejection. He had a sad story to tell. The\r\nagent of the estate to which he belonged was in town, and John had\r\nbeen commissioned to inform me that all the slaves belonging to the\r\nestate were to be immediately transferred to a Louisiana plantation for\r\nsafety. Those of us who had hired these servants by the year were to be\r\nindemnified for our loss.\r\n\r\n\"How do you feel about it, John?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe poor fellow broke down. \"It will kill me,\" he declared. \"I'll soon\r\ndie on that plantation.\"\r\n\r\nAll his affectionate, faithful service, all his hardships for our sakes,\r\nrushed upon my memory. I bade him put me in communication with the\r\nagent. I found that I could save the boy only by buying him! A large\r\nsum of gold was named as the price. I unbuckled my girdle and counted\r\nmy handful of gold—one hundred and six dollars. These I offered to the\r\nagent (who was a noted negro trader), and although it was far short of\r\nhis figures, he made out my bill of sale receipted. Remembered to-day,\r\nthis seems a wonderful act on my part. At the time it was the most\r\nnatural thing in the world!\r\n\r\nJohn soon appeared with smiling face and informed me with his thanks\r\nthat he belonged to me!\r\n\r\n\"You are a free man, John,\" I said. \"I will make out your papers and I\r\ncan easily arrange for you to pass the lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" he said. \"Marse Roger has often told me I was a free man.\r\nI never will leave you till I die. Papers, indeed! Papers nothing! I\r\nbelong to you—that's where I belong.\"\r\n\r\nAll that dreadful winter he was faithful to his promise, cheerfully\r\nbearing, without wages, all the privations of the time. Sometimes when\r\nthe last atom of food was gone, he would ask for money, sally forth\r\nwith a horse and a light cart, and bring in peas and dried apples. Once\r\na week we were allowed to purchase the head of a bullock, horns and\r\nall, from the commissary for the exclusive use of the servants—I would\r\nhave starved first—and a small ration of rice was allowed us by the\r\ngovernment. A one-armed boy, Alick, who had been reared in my father's\r\nfamily, now wandered in to find his old master, and installed himself\r\nas my father's servant.\r\n\r\nThe question that pressed upon me day and night was: \"How, where, can I\r\nearn some money?\" to be answered by the frightful truth that there could\r\nbe no opening for me anywhere, because I could not leave my children.\r\n\r\nOne wakeful night, while I was revolving these things, a sudden thought\r\ndarted, unbidden, into my sorely harassed mind:—\r\n\r\n\"Why not open the trunk from Washington? Something may be found there\r\nwhich can be sold.\"\r\n\r\nAt an early hour next morning John and Alick brought the trunk from the\r\ncellar. Aunt Jinny, Eliza, and the children gathered around. It proved\r\nto be full of my old Washington finery. There were a half-dozen or\r\nmore white muslin gowns, flounced and trimmed with valenciennes lace,\r\nmany yards; there was a rich bayadere silk gown trimmed fully with\r\nguipure lace; a green silk dress with gold embroidery; a blue-and-silver\r\nbrocade,—these last evening gowns. There was a paper box containing\r\nthe shaded roses I had worn to Lady Napier's ball, the ball at which\r\nMrs. Douglas and I had dressed alike in gowns of tulle. Another box\r\nheld the garniture of green leaves and gold grapes which had belonged\r\nto the green silk, and still another the blue-and-silver feathers for\r\nthe brocade. An opera cloak trimmed with fur; a long purple velvet\r\ncloak; a purple velvet \"coalscuttle\" bonnet, trimmed with white roses;\r\na point-lace handkerchief; valenciennes lace; Brussels lace; and in\r\nthe bottom of the trunk a package of _ciel_ blue zephyr, awakening\r\nreminiscences of a passion which I had cherished for knitting shawls\r\nand \"mariposas\" of zephyr,—such was the collection I discovered.\r\n\r\nI ripped all the lace from the evening gowns and made large collars and\r\nundersleeves then in vogue. John found a closed dry-goods store willing\r\nto sell clean paper boxes.\r\n\r\nMy first instalment was sent to Price's store in Richmond and promptly\r\nsold. I sold the silk gowns minus the costly trimming; but when I had\r\nstripped the muslin flounces of lace, behold raw edges that no belle,\r\neven a Confederate, could have worn. I rolled the edges of these\r\nflounces—there were ten or twelve on some of the gowns—and edged them\r\nwith a spiral line of blue zephyr. I embroidered a dainty vine of blue\r\nforget-me-nots on bodice and sleeves, with a result simply ravishing!\r\n\r\nAfter I had converted all my laces into collars, cuffs, and sleeves,\r\nand had sold my silk gowns, opera cloak, and point-lace handkerchiefs,\r\nI devoted myself to trimming the edges of the artificial flowers, and\r\nseparating the long wreaths and garlands into clusters for hats and\r\n_bouquets de corsage_.\r\n\r\nEliza and the children delighted in this phase of my work, and begged\r\nto assist,—all except Aunt Jinny.\r\n\r\n\"Honey,\" she said, \"don't you think, in these times of trouble, you\r\nmight do better than tempt them po' young lambs in Richmond to worship\r\nthe golden calf and bow down to mammon? We prays not to be led into\r\ntemptation, and you sho'ly is leadin' 'em into vanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe so, Aunt Jinny, but I must sell all I can. We have to be clothed,\r\nyou know, war or no war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my chile, that's so; but we're told to consider the lilies.\r\nGawd Almighty tells us we must clothe ourselves in the garment of\r\nrighteousness, and He—\"\r\n\r\n\"You always 'pear to be mighty intimate with God A'mighty,\" interrupted\r\nEliza, in great wrath. \"Now you just run 'long home an' leave my mistis\r\nto her work. How would _you_ look with nothin' on but a garment of\r\nrighteousness?\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had stripped the pretty silk gowns of their trimmings, what could\r\nbe done with the gowns themselves? Finally I resolved to embroider them.\r\nThe zeal with which I worked knew no pause. I needed no rest. General\r\nWilcox, who was in the saddle until a late hour every night, said to me,\r\n\"Your candle is the last light I see at night—the first in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should never sleep,\" I told him.\r\n\r\nOne day I consulted Eliza about the manufacture of a Confederate candle.\r\nWe knew how to make it—by drawing a cotton rope many times through\r\nmelted wax, and then winding it around a bottle. We could get the wax,\r\nbut our position was an exposed one. Soldiers' tents were close around\r\nus, and we scrupulously avoided any revelation of our needs, lest they\r\nshould deny themselves for our sakes. Eliza thought we might avail\r\nourselves of the absence of the officers, and finish our work before\r\nthey returned. We made our candle behind the kitchen; but that night,\r\nas I sat sewing beside its dim, glowworm light, I heard a step in the\r\nhall, and a hand, hastily thrust out, placed a brown paper parcel on\r\nthe piano near the door. It was a soldier's ration of candles!\r\n\r\nOf course I could not find shoes for my boys. I made little boots of\r\ncarpet lined with flannel for my baby. A pair lasted just three days.\r\nA large bronze morocco pocket-book fell into my hands, of which I made\r\nboots for my little Mary. Alick,—prowling about the fields to gather\r\nthe herb \"life everlasting,\" of which we made yeast,—found two or three\r\nleather bags, and a soldier shoemaker contrived shoes for each of my\r\nboys.\r\n\r\nMy own prime necessity was for the steel we women wear in front of our\r\nstays. I suffered so much for want of this accustomed support, that\r\nCaptain Lindsay had a pair made for me by the government gunsmith—the\r\nbest I ever had.\r\n\r\nThe time came when the salable contents of the Washington trunk were all\r\ngone. I then cut up my husband's dress-coat, and designed well-fitting\r\nladies' gloves, with gauntlets made of the watered silk lining. Of\r\nan interlining of gray flannel I made gray gloves, and this glove\r\nmanufacture yielded me hundreds of dollars. Thirteen small fragments\r\nof flannel were left after the gloves were finished. Of these, pieced\r\ntogether, I made a pair of drawers for my Willy,—my youngest boy.\r\n\r\nThe lines around us were now so closely drawn that my father returned\r\nhome after short absences of a day or two. But we were made anxious,\r\nduring a heavy snow early in December, by a more prolonged absence.\r\nFinally he appeared, on foot, hatless, and exhausted. He had been\r\ncaptured by a party of cavalrymen. He had told them of his non-combatant\r\nposition, but when he asked for release, they shook their heads. At\r\nnight they all prepared to bivouac upon the ground; assigned him a\r\nsheltered spot, gave him a good supper and blankets, and left him to\r\nhis repose. As the night wore on and all grew still, he raised his head\r\ncautiously to reconnoitre, and to his surprise found himself at some\r\ndistance from the guard—but his horse tied to a tree within the circle\r\naround the fire. My father took the hint and walked away unchallenged,\r\n\"which proves, my dear,\" he said, \"that a clergyman is not worth as much\r\nas a good horse in time of war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the colony escaped from the shells and huddled together around\r\nGeneral Lee were two very humble poor women who often visited me. One of\r\nthem was the proud owner of a cow, \"Morning-Glory,\" which she contrived\r\nto feed from the refuse of the camp kitchens, receiving in return a\r\nsmall quantity of milk, to be sold at prices beyond belief. I never saw\r\nMorning-Glory, but I often heard her friendly echo to the lowing of my\r\nlittle Rose, morning and evening. Being interpreted, it might have been\r\nfound to convey an expression of surprise that either was still alive,\r\nso slender was their allowance of food.\r\n\r\nOne day I espied, coming down the dusty road, the limp, sunbonneted\r\nfigure of Morning-Glory's mistress. She sank upon the nearest chair,\r\npushed back her calico bonnet, and revealed a face blurred with tears\r\nand hair dishevelled beyond the ordinary.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, Mrs. Jones! Come to the fire! It's a cold morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"No'm, I ain't cole! It's—it's\" (sobbing)—\"it's Mornin'-Glory!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not sick? If she is, I'll—\"\r\n\r\n\"No'm, Mornin'-Glory ain't never goin' to be sick no mo'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mrs. Jones! _Not dead!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Them pickets kep' me awake all las' night, an' I got up in the night\r\nan' went out to see how Mornin'-Glory was gettin' on, an' she—she—she\r\nlook at me jus' the same! An' I slep' soun' till after sun-up, and when\r\nI got my pail an' went out to milk her—_thar was her horns an hufs!_\"\r\n\r\nThe poor woman broke down completely in telling me the ghastly story.\r\n\"Oh, how wicked! How was it possible to take her off and nobody hear?\"\r\nI exclaimed in great wrath.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Mis' Pryor, nothin' but what I tells you. Talk to me\r\n'bout Yankees! Soldiers is soldiers, an' when you say _that_, you jus'\r\nas well say devils is devils.\"\r\n\r\nMy other poor neighbor had long been a pensioner on my father. She was\r\na forlorn widow with many children, hopeless and helpless. My father was\r\nin despair when she turned up \"to git away from the shellin'.\" She found\r\na small untenanted house near us and set up an establishment which was\r\nsupported altogether by boarding an occasional soldier on sick leave,\r\nand taking his rations as her pay. Like Mrs. Jones, she was a frequent\r\nvisitor to my fireside. One morning, after some unusual demonstrations\r\nof coy shyness, she blurted out: \"I knows fo' I begin what you goin' to\r\nsay! You goin' to tell me Ma'y Ann is a fool, an' I won't say you ain't\r\nin the rights of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is Mary Ann's folly? I thought she had grown up to be a\r\nsensible girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Sensible! Ma'y Ann!_ Them pretty gals is never sensible! No'm. Melissy\r\nJane is the sensible one o' my chillun. I tole Ma'y Ann she didn't have\r\nnothin' fitten to be ma'ied in, an' she up an' say she know Mis' Pryor\r\nain' goin' to let one o' her pa's chu'ch people git ma'ied in rags.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly will not, Mrs. Davis! Mary Ann, I suppose, is to marry the\r\nsoldier you've been taking care of. Tell her she may look to me for a\r\nwedding-dress. When is it to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as Dr. Pryor says—to-morrow if convenient.\"\r\n\r\nI immediately overhauled the bundle of Washington finery and found a\r\nlavender Pina, or \"pineapple\" muslin, not yet prepared for sale. This\r\nwas a delicate gown, trimmed with lavender silk, and with angel sleeves\r\nlined with white silk. This I sent to the prospective bride—considering\r\nher needs and station, a most unsuitable wedding garment, but all I had!\r\nI managed to make a contribution to the wedding supper, a large pumpkin\r\nI extorted from John, who had \"found\" it. Melissy Jane, homely enough to\r\nbe brilliantly \"sensible,\" appeared to take charge of the present,—the\r\nmost slatternly, unlovely, and altogether unpromising of the poor white\r\nclass I had ever seen; and my father, in view of the great good fortune\r\ncoming to the forlorn family in the acquisition of an able-bodied,\r\nwhole-hearted Confederate soldier, made no delay in performing the\r\nmarriage ceremony. About a week afterward Mrs. Davis, limper than ever,\r\nmore depressed than ever, reappeared.\r\n\r\n\"I hope nobody's sick?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"No'm, the chilluns is as peart as common. Ma'y Ann don't seem no ways\r\nencouraged. 'Pears like she's onreconciled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what ails poor Mary Ann?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yas'm—he's lef' her! Jus' took hisself off and never say nuthin'.\r\nWe-all don't even know what company owns him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Davis!\" I exclaimed, in great indignation, \"this is not to be\r\ntolerated. That man is to be found and made to do his duty. I can manage\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know as I keers to ketch 'im,\" sighed the poor woman. \"Ef you\r\ncapters them men erginst ther will, they'll git away ergin—_sho!_ Let\r\n'im go long! He ain't paid me a cent or a ration of meat an' meal sence\r\nhe was ma'ied. Anyhow,\" she proudly added, \"_Ma'y Ann is ma'ied!_ Folks\r\ncan't fling it up to 'er now as she's a ole maid,\"—which proves that\r\nmaternal ambitions are peculiar to no condition of life.\r\n\r\nLooking back, and living over again these stern times, it seems to\r\nme little short of a miracle that we actually did exist upon the\r\nslender portion of food allotted us. We could rarely see, from one day\r\nto another, just how we were to be fed. \"Give us this day our daily\r\nbread\"—this petition was our sole reliance. And as surely as the day\r\nwould come,\r\n\r\n             \"He that doth the ravens feed,\r\n     Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,\"\r\n\r\nwould prove to us that we were of more value in His sight than many\r\nsparrows.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee passed my door every Sunday morning on his way to a little\r\nwooden chapel nearer his quarters than St. Paul's Church. I have a\r\npicture of him in my memory, in his faded gray overcoat and slouch hat,\r\nbending his head before the sleet on stormy mornings. Sometimes his\r\ncousin, Mrs. Banister, could find herself warranted by circumstances\r\nto invite him to dine with her. Once she received from a country friend\r\na present of a turkey, and General Lee consented to share it with her.\r\nShe helped him at dinner to a moderate portion, for there was only one\r\nturkey—like Charles Lamb's hare—and many friends! Mrs. Banister observed\r\nthe general laying on one side of his plate part of his share of the\r\nturkey, and she regretted his loss of appetite. \"Madam,\" he explained,\r\n\"Colonel Taylor is not well, and I should be glad to be permitted to\r\ntake this to him.\"\r\n\r\nAfter an unusually mild season, John bethought himself of the fishes\r\nin the pond and streams, but not a fishhook was for sale in Richmond or\r\nPetersburg. He contrived, out of a cunning arrangement of pins, to make\r\nhooks, and sallied forth with my boys. But the water was too cold, or\r\nthe fish had been driven down-stream by the firing. The usual resource\r\nof the sportsman with an empty creel—a visit to the fishmonger—was quite\r\nout of the question. There was no fishmonger any more.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances you may imagine my sensation at receiving the\r\nfollowing note:—\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR MRS. PRYOR: General Lee has been honored by a visit\r\n     from the Hon. Thomas Connolly, Irish M.P. from Donegal.\r\n\r\n     \"He ventures to request you will have the kindness to give Mr.\r\n     Connolly a room in your cottage, if this can be done without\r\n     inconvenience to yourself.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly I could give Mr. Connolly a room; but just as certainly\r\nI could not feed him! The messenger who brought me the note hastily\r\nreassured me. He had been instructed to say that Mr. Connolly would mess\r\nwith General Lee. I turned Mr. Connolly's room over to John, who soon\r\nbecame devoted to his service. The M.P. proved a most agreeable guest,\r\na fine-looking Irish gentleman with an irresistibly humorous, cheery\r\nfund of talk. He often dropped in at our biscuit toasting, and assured\r\nus that we were better provided than the commander-in-chief.\r\n\r\n\"You should have seen 'Uncle Robert's' dinner to-day, madam! He had two\r\nbiscuits, and he gave me one.\"\r\n\r\nAnother time Mr. Connolly was in high feather.\r\n\r\n\"We had a glorious dinner to-day! Somebody sent 'Uncle Robert' a box of\r\nsardines.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Lee, however, was not forgotten. On fine mornings quite a\r\nprocession of little negroes, in every phase of raggedness, used to\r\npass my door, each one bearing a present from the farmers' wives of\r\nbuttermilk in a tin pail for General Lee. The army was threatened\r\nwith scurvy, and buttermilk, hominy, and every vegetable that could be\r\nobtained was sent to the hospital.\r\n\r\nMr. Connolly interested himself in my boys' Latin studies.\r\n\r\n\"I am going home,\" he said, \"and tell the English women what I have seen\r\nhere: two boys reading Cæsar while the shells are thundering, and their\r\nmother looking on without fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am too busy keeping the wolf from my door,\" I told him, \"to concern\r\nmyself with the thunderbolts.\"\r\n\r\nThe wolf was no longer at the door! He had entered and had taken up\r\nhis abode at the fireside. Besides what I could earn with my needle, I\r\nhad only my father's army ration to rely upon. My faithful John foraged\r\nright and left, and I had reason to doubt the wisdom of inquiring too\r\nclosely as to the source of an occasional half-dozen eggs or small bag\r\nof corn. This last he would pound on a wooden block for hominy. Meal was\r\ngreatly prized for the reason that wholesomer bread could be made of it\r\nthan of wheaten flour,—meal was no longer procurable, but we were never\r\naltogether without flour. As I have said, we might occasionally purchase\r\nfor five dollars the head of a bullock from the commissary, every other\r\npart of the animal being available for army rations. By self-denial on\r\nour own part we fondly hoped we could support our army and at last win\r\nour cause. We were not, at the time, fully aware of the true state of\r\nthings in the army. Our men were so depleted from starvation that the\r\nmost trifling wound would end fatally. Gangrene would supervene, and\r\nthen nothing could be done to prevent death. Long before this time, at\r\nVicksburg, Admiral Porter found that many a dead soldier's haversack\r\nyielded nothing but a handful of parched corn. _We_ were now enduring\r\na sterner siege. The month of January brought us sleet and storm. Our\r\nfamine grew sterner every day. Seasons of bitter cold weather would\r\nfind us without wood to burn, and we had no other fuel. I commenced\r\ncutting down the choice fruit trees in the grounds,—and General Wilcox\r\nmanaged to send me a load of rails from a fence, hitherto spared by the\r\nsoldiers. Poor little Rose could yield only one cupful of milk, so small\r\nwas her ration; but we never thought of turning the faithful animal into\r\nbeef. The officers in my yard spared her something every day from the\r\nfood of their horses.\r\n\r\nThe days were so dark and cheerless, the news from the armies at a\r\ndistance so discouraging, it was hard to preserve a cheerful demeanor\r\nfor the sake of the family. And now began the alarming tidings, every\r\nmorning, of the desertions during the night. General Wilcox wondered\r\nhow long his brigade would hold together at the rate of fifty desertions\r\nevery twenty-four hours!\r\n\r\nThe common soldier had enlisted, not to establish the right of\r\nsecession, not for love of the slave,—he had no slaves,—but simply\r\nto resist the invasion of the South by the North, simply to prevent\r\nsubjugation. The soldier of the rank and file was not always\r\nintellectual or cultivated. He cared little for politics, less for\r\nslavery. He did care, however, for his own soil, his own little farm,\r\nhis own humble home, and he was willing to fight to drive the invader\r\nfrom it. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation did not stimulate him in\r\nthe least. The negro, free or slave, was of no consequence to him. His\r\nquarrel was a sectional one, and he fought for his section.\r\n\r\nIn any war the masses rarely trouble themselves about the merits of the\r\nquarrel. Their pugnacity and courage are aroused and stimulated by the\r\nenthusiasm of their comrades or by their own personal wrongs and perils.\r\n\r\nNow, in January, 1865, the common soldier perceived that the cause was\r\nlost. He could read its doom in the famine around him, in the faces\r\nof his officers, in tidings from abroad. His wife and children were\r\nsuffering. His duty was now to them; so he stole away in the darkness,\r\nand in infinite danger and difficulty found his way back to his own\r\nfireside. He deserted, but not to the enemy.\r\n\r\nBut what shall we say of the soldier who remained unflinching at his\r\npost _knowing_ the cause was lost for which he was called to meet\r\ndeath? Heroism can attain no loftier height than this. Very few of the\r\nintelligent men of our army had the slightest hope, at the end, of our\r\nsuccess. Some, like Mr. William C. Rives, had none at the beginning.\r\n\r\nOne night all these things weighed more heavily than usual upon me,—the\r\npicket firing, the famine, the military executions, the dear one \"sick\r\nand in prison.\" I sighed audibly, and my son Theodorick, who slept near\r\nme, asked the cause, adding, \"Why can you not sleep, dear mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" I replied, \"you repeat something for me.\"\r\n\r\nHe at once commenced, \"Tell me not in mournful numbers\"—and repeated\r\nthe \"Psalm of Life.\" I did not sleep; those were brave words, but not\r\nstrong enough for the situation.\r\n\r\nHe paused, and presently his young voice broke the stillness:—\r\n\r\n\"Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy\r\nname\"—going on to the end of the beautiful psalm of adoration and faith\r\nwhich nineteen centuries have decreed to be in very truth a Psalm of\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nThat General Lee was acutely sensible of our condition was proved\r\nby an interview with General Gordon. Before daylight, on the 2d of\r\nMarch, General Lee sent for General Gordon, who was with his command\r\nat a distant part of the line. Upon arriving, General Gordon was much\r\naffected by seeing General Lee standing at the mantel in his room, his\r\nhead bowed on his folded arms. The room was dimly lighted by a single\r\nlamp, and a smouldering fire was dying on the hearth. The night was\r\ncold, and General Lee's room chill and cheerless.\r\n\r\n\"I have sent for you, General Gordon,\" said General Lee, with a dejected\r\nvoice and manner, \"to make known to you the condition of our affairs and\r\nconsult with you as to what we had best do. I have here reports sent\r\nin from my officers to-night. I find I have under my command, of all\r\narms, hardly forty-five thousand men. These men are starving. They are\r\nalready so weakened as to be hardly efficient. Many of them have become\r\ndesperate, reckless, and disorderly as they have never been before.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to control men who are suffering for food. They are\r\nbreaking open mills, barns, and stores in search of it. Almost crazed\r\nfrom hunger, they are deserting in large numbers and going home. My\r\nhorses are in equally bad condition. The supply of horses in the country\r\nis exhausted. It has come to be just as bad for me to have a horse\r\nkilled as a man. I cannot remount a cavalryman whose horse dies. General\r\nGrant can mount ten thousand men in ten days and move round your flank.\r\nIf he were to send me word to-morrow that I might move out unmolested,\r\nI have not enough horses to move my artillery. He is not likely to send\r\nme any such message, although he sent me word yesterday that he knew\r\nwhat I had for breakfast every morning. I sent him word I did not think\r\nthat this could be so, for if he did he would surely send me something\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\"But now let us look at the figures. As I said, I have forty-five\r\nthousand starving men. Hancock has eighteen thousand at Winchester.\r\nTo oppose him I have not a single vidette. Sheridan, with his terrible\r\ncavalry, has marched unmolested and unopposed along the James, cutting\r\nthe railroads and the canal. Thomas is coming from Knoxville with\r\nthirty thousand well-equipped troops, and I have, to oppose him, not\r\nmore than three thousand in all. Sherman is in North Carolina with\r\nsixty-five thousand men. So I have forty-five thousand poor fellows\r\nin bad condition opposed to one hundred and sixty thousand strong and\r\nconfident men. These forces added to General Grant's make over a quarter\r\nof a million. To prevent them all from uniting to my destruction, and\r\nadding Johnston's and Beauregard's men, I can oppose only sixty thousand\r\nmen. They are growing weaker every day. Their sufferings are terrible\r\nand exhausting. My horses are broken down and impotent. General Grant\r\nmay press around our flank any day and cut off our supplies.\"\r\n\r\nAs a result of this conference General Lee went to Richmond to make one\r\nmore effort to induce our government to treat for peace. It was on his\r\nreturn from an utterly fruitless errand that he said:—\r\n\r\n\"I am a soldier! It is my duty to obey orders;\" and the final disastrous\r\nbattles were fought.\r\n\r\nIt touches me to know now that it was after this that my beloved\r\ncommander found heart to turn aside and bring me comfort. No one knew\r\nbetter than he all I had endeavored and endured, and my heart blesses\r\nhis memory for its own sake. At this tremendous moment, when he had\r\nreturned from his fruitless mission to Richmond, when the attack on\r\nFort Steadman was impending, when his slender line was confronted by\r\nGrant's ever increasing host, stretching twenty miles, when the men were\r\nso starved, so emaciated, that the smallest wound meant death, when his\r\nown personal privations were beyond imagination, General Lee could spend\r\nhalf an hour for my consolation and encouragement.\r\n\r\nCottage Farm being on the road between headquarters and Fort Gregg,—the\r\nfortification which held General Grant in check at that point,—I saw\r\nGeneral Lee almost daily going to this work or to Battery 45.\r\n\r\nI was, as was my custom, sewing in my little parlor one morning, about\r\nthe middle of March, when an orderly entered, saying:—\r\n\r\n\"General Lee wishes to make his respects to Mrs. Pryor.\" The general\r\nwas immediately behind him. His face was lighted with the anticipation\r\nof telling me his good news. With the high-bred courtesy and kindness\r\nwhich always distinguished his manner, he asked kindly after my welfare,\r\nand taking my little girl in his arms, began gently to break his news\r\nto me:—\r\n\r\n\"How long, madam, was General Pryor with me before he had a furlough?\"\r\n\r\n\"He never had one, I think,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, did I not take good care of him until we camped here so close to\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I said, puzzled to know the drift of these preliminaries.\r\n\r\n\"I sent him home to you, I remember,\" he continued, \"for a day or two,\r\nand you let the Yankees catch him. Now he is coming back to be with you\r\nagain on parole until he is exchanged. You must take better care of him\r\nin future.\"\r\n\r\nI was too much overcome to do more than stammer a few words of thanks.\r\n\r\nPresently he added, \"What are you going to say when I tell the general\r\nthat in all this winter you have never once been to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, General Lee,\" I answered, \"I had too much mercy to join in your\r\nbuttermilk persecution!\"\r\n\r\n\"Persecution!\" he said; \"such things keep us alive! Last night, when\r\nI reached my headquarters, I found a card on my table with a hyacinth\r\npinned to it, and these words: 'For General Lee, with a kiss!' Now,\" he\r\nadded, tapping his breast, \"I have here my hyacinth and my card—_and I\r\nmean to find my kiss_!\"\r\n\r\nHe was amused by the earnest eyes of my little girl, as she gazed into\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"They have a wonderful liking for soldiers,\" he said. \"I knew one little\r\ngirl to give up all her pretty curls willingly that she might look like\r\nCustis! 'They _might_ cut my hair like Custis's,' she said. Custis!\r\nwhose shaven head does not improve him in any eyes but hers.\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was the perfection of repose and simplicity. As he talked\r\nwith me, I remembered that I had heard of this singular calmness. Even\r\nat Gettysburg and at the explosion of the crater he had evinced no\r\nagitation or dismay. I did not know then, as I do now, that nothing had\r\never approached the anguish of this moment, when he had come to say an\r\nencouraging and cheering word to me, after abandoning all hope of the\r\nsuccess of the cause.\r\n\r\nAfter talking awhile and sending a kind message to my husband, to greet\r\nhim on his return, he rose, walked to the window, and looked over the\r\nfields,—the fields through which, not many days afterward, he dug his\r\nlast trenches!\r\n\r\nI was moved to say, \"You only, General, can tell me if it is worth my\r\nwhile to put the ploughshare into those fields.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plant your seeds, madam,\" he replied; sadly adding, after a moment,\r\n\"The doing it will be some reward.\"\r\n\r\nI was answered. I thought then he had little hope. I now know he had\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nHe had already, as we have seen, remonstrated against further\r\nresistance—against the useless shedding of blood. His protest had been\r\nunheeded. It remained for him now to gather his forces for endurance to\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\nTwenty days afterward his headquarters were in ashes; he had led his\r\nfamished army across the Appomattox, and telling them they had done\r\ntheir duty and had nothing to regret, he had bidden them farewell\r\nforever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day drew near when the husband and father of our little family was\r\nto be restored to his own home and his own people. Paroled, and not yet\r\nexchanged, we could hope for a brief visit from him. John was in a great\r\nstate over the possibilities of a welcoming banquet. Peas, beans, flour,\r\nsorghum molasses,—these in small quantity he might hope to command. A\r\nnourishing soup could be made of the peas, and if only he could \"find\"\r\nan egg, he could mix it with sorghum and bake it in an unshortened open\r\ncrust for dessert. But the meat course!\r\n\r\nJust at this critical moment a hapless duck ventured too near John's\r\nacquisitive hand while he was on one of his prowling expeditions. This\r\nhe perfectly roasted and presented to me to be sacredly kept until\r\nthe general's arrival. Accordingly I hid it away in a small safe with\r\nwire-netting doors, and judiciously covered it over with a cloth lest\r\nsome child or visitor should be led into irresistible temptation.\r\n\r\nWe were all expectation and excitement when a lady drove up and asked\r\nfor shelter, as she had been \"driven in from the lines.\" Shelter and\r\nlodging I could give by spreading quilts on the parlor floor—but,\r\nalas, my duck! Must my precious duck be sacrificed upon the altar of\r\nhospitality? I peeped into the little safe to assure myself that I could\r\nmanage to keep it hidden, and behold, it was gone! Not until next day,\r\nwhen it was placed before my husband with a triumphant flourish (our\r\nunwelcome guest had departed), did I discover that John had stolen it!\r\n\"Why, there's the duck!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"'Course here's the duck!\" said John, respectfully. \"Ducks got plenty\r\nof sense. They knows as well as folks when to hide.\"\r\n\r\nWe found our released prisoner pale and thin, but devoutly thankful\r\nto be at home. Mr. Connolly and the officers around us called in the\r\nevening, keenly anxious to hear his story and heartily expressing their\r\njoy at his release. My friends in Washington had wished to send me\r\nsome presents, but my husband declined them, accepting only two cans\r\nof pineapple. Mr. Connolly sent out for the \"boys in the yard\" and\r\nassisted me in dividing the fruit into portions, so each one should\r\nhave a bit. It was served on all the saucers and butter plates we could\r\nfind, and Mr. Connolly himself handed the tray around, exclaiming, \"Oh,\r\nlads! it is just the _best_ thing you ever tasted!\" Then each soldier\r\nbrought forth his brier-root and gathered around the traveller for his\r\nstory. His story was a thrilling one—of his capture, his incarceration,\r\nhis comrades; finally of the unexpected result of the efforts of his\r\nante-bellum friends, Washington McLean and John W. Forney, for his\r\nrelease.\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained by these friends in Washington that he was detained\r\nas hostage for the safety of some Union officer whom the Confederate\r\ngovernment had threatened to put to death. This situation of affairs\r\nleft General Pryor in a very dangerous position. Southern leaders were\r\ninclined to take revenge upon some prominent Union soldiers in their\r\nprisons, and Stanton stood ready to take counter-revenge upon the body\r\nof \"Harry Hotspur.\" Washington McLean, the editor and proprietor of\r\nthe _Cincinnati Enquirer_, had met my husband while he was in Congress,\r\nand learned \"to like and love him,\" as one expressed it. Realizing the\r\ngravity of his friend's situation, Mr. McLean, having first approached\r\nGeneral Grant, who positively refused to consider General Pryor's\r\nrelease, resolved to appeal to Mr. Stanton. He found Mr. Stanton in\r\nthe library of his own home, with his daughter in his arms, and the\r\nfollowing conversation ensued:—\r\n\r\n\"This is a charming fireside picture, Mr. Secretary! I warrant that\r\nlittle lady cares nothing for war or the Secretary of War! She has her\r\nfather, and that fills all her ambition.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never said a truer word, did he, pet?\" pressing the curly head\r\nclose to his bosom.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Stanton, you will understand my errand. There are curly\r\nheads down there in old Virginia weeping out their bright eyes for a\r\nfather loved just as this pretty baby loves you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! Probably so,\" said Stanton.\r\n\r\n\"Now—there's Pryor—\"\r\n\r\nBut before another word could be said, the Secretary of War pushed the\r\nchild from his knee and thundered:—\r\n\r\n\"He shall be hanged! Damn him!\"\r\n\r\nBut he had reckoned without his host when he supposed that Washington\r\nMcLean would not appeal from that verdict. Armed with a letter of\r\nintroduction from Horace Greeley, Mr. McLean visited Mr. Lincoln. The\r\nPresident remembered General Pryor's uniformly generous treatment of\r\nprisoners who had, at various times, fallen into his custody, especially\r\nhis capture at Manassas of the whole camp of Federal wounded, surgeons\r\nand ambulance corps, and his prompt parole of the same. Mr. Lincoln\r\nlistened attentively, and after ascertaining all the facts, issued an\r\norder directing Colonel Burke, the commander at Fort Lafayette, to\r\n\"deliver Roger A. Pryor into the custody of Colonel John W. Forney,\r\nSecretary of the Senate, to be produced by him whenever required.\"\r\n\r\nArmed with this order, Mr. McLean visited Fort Lafayette, where he found\r\nhis friend in close confinement in the casemate with other prisoners.\r\nMr. McLean immediately secured his release and accompanied him to\r\nWashington and to Colonel Forney's house.\r\n\r\nAs is now well known, even a presidential command did not stand in the\r\nway of Stanton's vengeance. When he learned of General Pryor's release,\r\nhis rage was unbounded, and he immediately issued orders to seize the\r\nprisoner wherever found, and announced his intention of hanging him, as\r\na response to the threats of the Southern leaders. Colonel Forney was\r\nadvised of this condition of affairs, and at his request his secretary,\r\nJohn Russell Young, afterwards Minister to China, went to the offices of\r\nthe various Washington newspapers and gave each journal a brief account\r\nof how General Pryor had passed through Washington that evening, and\r\nunder parole had entered into the rebel lines. As a matter of fact,\r\nhe was at that time in Colonel Forney's house, and remained there for\r\ntwo more days. Stanton, however, was made to believe that his prey had\r\nescaped him, and therefore abandoned his hunt.\r\n\r\nAt that time John Y. Beall, a Confederate officer, was confined with\r\nGeneral Pryor, having been, it was supposed, implicated in a conspiracy\r\nto set fire to hotels and museums in New York, derail and fire railroad\r\ntrains. Young Beall protested innocence, but finally he was arrested,\r\ntried by court-martial, and sentenced to be hanged. He belonged to an\r\ninfluential Southern family, and was held in high esteem south of Mason\r\nand Dixon's line. Some of the officials of the Confederacy served notice\r\non Secretary of War Stanton that if Beall was hanged, they would put\r\nthe rope around the necks of a number of prominent Northern soldiers\r\nwho at that time were in their custody. But the stern Stanton was\r\nrelentless, and he only sent back word that if the threat was carried\r\ninto execution, he would hang Pryor. Mr. McLean became interested in\r\nyoung Beall's fate, and suggested that if General Pryor would make a\r\npersonal appeal in his behalf to President Lincoln, his execution might\r\nprobably be prevented. To that end, Mr. McLean telegraphed a request\r\nto Mr. Lincoln, that he accord General Pryor an interview, to which\r\na favorable response was promptly returned. The next evening General\r\nPryor, with Mr. McLean and Mr. Forney, called at the White House, and\r\nwere graciously received by the President. General Pryor at once opened\r\nhis intercession in behalf of Captain Beall; but although Mr. Lincoln\r\nevinced the sincerest compassion for the young man and an extreme\r\naversion to his death, he felt constrained to yield to the assurance\r\nof General Dix, in a telegram just received, that the execution was\r\nindispensable to the security of the Northern cities. Mr. Lincoln then\r\nturned the conversation to the recent conference at Hampton Roads, the\r\nmiscarriage of which he deplored with the profoundest sorrow. He said\r\nthat had the Confederate government agreed to the reëstablishment of\r\nthe Union and the abolition of slavery, the people of the South might\r\nhave been compensated for the loss of their negroes and would have\r\nbeen protected by a universal amnesty, but that Mr. Jefferson Davis\r\nmade the recognition of the Confederacy a condition _sine qua non_ of\r\nany negotiations. Thus, he declared, would Mr. Davis be responsible\r\nfor every drop of blood that should be shed in the further prosecution\r\nof the war, a futile and wicked effusion of blood, since it was then\r\nobvious to every sane man that the Southern armies must be speedily\r\ncrushed. On this topic he dwelt so warmly and at such length that\r\nGeneral Pryor inferred that he still hoped the people of the South would\r\nreverse Mr. Davis's action, and would renew the negotiations for peace.\r\nIndeed, he declared in terms that he could not believe the senseless\r\nobstinacy of Mr. Davis represented the sentiment of the South. It was\r\napparent to General Pryor that Mr. Lincoln desired him to sound leading\r\nmen of the South on the subject. Accordingly, on the general's return\r\nto Richmond, he did consult with Senator Hunter and other prominent men\r\nin the Confederacy, but with one voice they assured him that nothing\r\ncould be done with Mr. Davis, and that the South had only to await the\r\nimminent and inevitable catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe inevitable catastrophe marched on apace.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 2 we were all up early that we might prepare\r\nand send to Dr. Claiborne's hospital certain things we had suddenly\r\nacquired. An old farmer friend of my husband had loaded a wagon with\r\npeas, potatoes, dried fruit, hominy, and a little bacon, and had sent\r\nit as a welcoming present. We had been told of the prevalence of scurvy\r\nin the hospitals, and had boiled a quantity of hominy, and also of dried\r\nfruit, to be sent with the potatoes for the relief of the sick.\r\n\r\nMy husband said to me at our early breakfast:—\r\n\r\n\"How soundly you can sleep! The cannonading was awful last night. It\r\nshook the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that is only Fort Gregg,\" I answered. \"Those guns fire incessantly.\r\nI don't consider them. You've been shut up in a casemate so long you've\r\nforgotten the smell of powder.\"\r\n\r\nOur father, who happened to be with us that morning, said:—\r\n\r\n\"By the bye, Roger, I went to see General Lee, and told him you seemed\r\nto be under the impression that if your division moves, you should go\r\nalong with it. The general said emphatically: 'That would be violation\r\nof his parole, Doctor. Your son surely knows he cannot march with the\r\narmy until he is exchanged.'\"\r\n\r\nThis was a great relief to me, for I had been afraid of a different\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I repaired to the kitchen to see the pails filled for\r\nthe hospital, and to send Alick and John on their errand.\r\n\r\nPresently a message was brought me that I must join my husband, who\r\nhad walked out to the fortification behind the garden. I found a low\r\nearthwork had been thrown up during the night still nearer our house,\r\nand on it he was standing. My husband held out his hand and drew me\r\nup on the breastwork beside him. Negroes were passing, wheeling their\r\nbarrows, containing the spades they had just used. Below was a plain,\r\nand ambulances were collecting and stopping at intervals. Then a\r\nslender gray line stretched across under cover of the first earthwork\r\nand the forts. Fort Gregg and Battery 45 were belching away with all\r\ntheir might, answered by guns all along the line. While we gazed on\r\nall this, the wood opposite seemed alive, and out stepped a division\r\nof bluecoats—muskets shining and banners flying in the morning sun. My\r\nhusband exclaimed: \"My God! What a line! They are going to fight here\r\nright away. Run home and get the children in the cellar.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I reached the little encampment behind the house, I found the\r\ngreatest confusion. Tents were struck, and a wagon was loading with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nCaptain Glover rode up to me and conjured me to leave immediately. I\r\nreminded him of his promise not to allow me to be surprised.\r\n\r\n\"We are ourselves surprised,\" he said; \"believe me, your life is\r\nnot safe here a moment.\" Tapping his breast, he continued, \"I bear\r\ndespatches proving what I say.\"\r\n\r\nI ran into the house, and with my two little children I started\r\nbareheaded up the road to town. I bade the servants remain. If things\r\ngrew warm, they had the cellar, and perhaps their presence would save\r\ntheir own goods and mine, should the day go against us. The negroes, in\r\nany event, would be safe.\r\n\r\nThe morning was close and warm, and as we toiled up the dusty road,\r\nI regretted the loss of my hat. Presently I met a gentleman driving\r\nrapidly from town. It was my neighbor, Mr. Laighton.\r\n\r\nHe had removed his wife and little girls to a place of safety and was\r\nreturning for me. He proposed, as we were now out of musket range,\r\nthat I should rest with the children under the shade of a tree, and he\r\nwould return to the house to see if he could save something—what did\r\nI suggest? I asked that he would bring a change of clothing for the\r\nchildren and my medicine chest.\r\n\r\nAs we waited for his return, some terrified horses dashed up the road,\r\none with blood flowing from his nostrils. When Mr. Laighton finally\r\nreturned, he brought news that he had seen my husband, that my boys were\r\nsafe with him, that all the cooked provisions were spread out for the\r\npassing soldiers, and that more were in preparation; also that he had\r\npromised to take care of me, and to leave the general free to dispense\r\nthese things judiciously. John had put the service of silver into the\r\nbuggy, and Eliza had packed a trunk, for which he was to return. This\r\nproved to be the French trunk, in which Eliza sent a change of clothing.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Laighton asked where he should go with us, I had no suggestion\r\nto make. Few of my friends were in the town, which was filled with\r\nrefugees. My dear Mrs. Meade or Mr. Charles Campbell would, I was\r\nsure, shelter us in an extremity. I decided to drive slowly through the\r\ncrowded streets, looking out for some sign of lodgings to let. Presently\r\nwe met a man who directed us to an empty house, and there, dumping the\r\nsilver service in the front porch, Mr. Laighton left us. About noon\r\nI had my first news from the seat of war. John and Alick appeared,\r\nthe latter leading Rose by a rope. John was to return (he had come to\r\nbring me some biscuits and my champagne glasses!), but Alick positively\r\nrebelled. Go back! No, _marm_, not if he knew his name was Alick. His\r\nmammy had never borned him to be in no battle! And walking off to give\r\nRose a pail of water, he informed her that \"You'n me, Rose, is the only\r\nfolks I see anywhar 'bout here with any sense.\"\r\n\r\nNeighbors soon discovered us; and to my joy I found that Mrs. Gibson,\r\nMrs. Meade, and Mr. Bishop—one of my father's elders—were in their own\r\nhouses, very near my temporary shelter.\r\n\r\nOur father, I learned afterwards, was with the hospital service of his\r\ncorps, and had been sent to the rear. I sent John back to the farm,\r\nstrictly ordering that the flag should be cared for. He told me it\r\nwas safe. He had hidden it under some fence rails in the cellar. As\r\nto the battle, he had no news, except that \"Marse Roger is giving away\r\neverything on the earth. All the presents from the farmer will go in a\r\nlittle while.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening my little boys, envoys from their father, came in with\r\nconfidential news. The day had gone against us. General Lee was holding\r\nthe line through our garden. The city would be surrendered at midnight.\r\nTheir father was giving all our stores of food and all his Confederate\r\nmoney to the private soldiers, a fact which evidently impressed them\r\nmost of all.\r\n\r\nI have told the thrilling story of the ensuing events elsewhere. Having\r\nbeen compelled to repeat much, I must now hasten on,—only briefly\r\nrecording my husband's recapture, release on parole, and continued\r\nrecapture every time the occupying troops were replaced by a new\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe day the Federals entered the town I saw our precious banner borne in\r\ntriumph past the door. The dear Petersburg women had made it and given\r\nit to their brave defender; it was coming back, amid shouts and songs\r\nof derision, a captive! As the troops passed they sang, to their battle\r\nhymn:—\r\n\r\n     \"John Brown's body is a-mouldering in the ground,\r\n               As we go marching on!\r\n     Oh, glory hallelujah,\r\n               As we go marching on!\"\r\n\r\nAnd down the line the tune was caught by advancing soldiers:—\r\n\r\n     \"Hang Jeff Davis on a sour apple tree,\r\n           As we go marching on.\r\n     Oh, glory hallelujah,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\"Ole Uncle Frank's at de bottom of dis business,\" said Alick; and alas!\r\nwe had reason to believe that the wily old gentleman—whom we had left\r\nhiding in the cellar and imploring \"for Gawd's sake, Jinny, bring me a\r\ngode o' water\"—had purchased favor by revealing the hiding-place of our\r\nbanner.\r\n\r\nEarly that morning German soldiers had rushed into our house demanding\r\nprisoners. My husband was marched off to headquarters, and the parole\r\nwritten by Mr. Lincoln himself on a visiting-card respected. The morning\r\nwas filled with exciting incidents. Our English \"colonel\" came early:\r\n\"To say good-by, madam! It's a shame!—and all just a question of bread\r\nand cheese—nothing but bread and cheese!\"\r\n\r\nWe sat all day in the front room, watching the splendidly equipped host\r\nas it marched by on its way to capture Lee. It soon became known that we\r\nwere there. Within the next few days we had calls from old Washington\r\nfriends. Among others my husband was visited by Elihu B. Washburne and\r\nSenator Henry Wilson, afterward Vice-president of the United States with\r\nGeneral Grant. These paid long visits and talked kindly and earnestly\r\nof the South.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln soon arrived and sent for my husband. But General Pryor\r\nexcused himself, saying that he was a paroled prisoner, that General\r\nLee was still in the field, and that he could hold no conference with\r\nthe head of the opposing army.\r\n\r\nThe splendid troops passed continually. Our hearts sank within us. We\r\nhad but one hope—that General Lee would join Joseph E. Johnston and find\r\nhis way to the mountains of Virginia, those ramparts of nature which\r\nmight afford protection until we could rest and recruit.\r\n\r\nIntelligence of the death of President Lincoln reached Petersburg on the\r\n17th of April. As he had been with us but a few days before, manifestly\r\nin perfect health and in all the glow and gladness of the triumph of the\r\nFederal arms, the community was unspeakably shocked by the catastrophe.\r\nThat he fell by the hand of an assassin, and that the deed was done by a\r\nConfederate and avowedly in the interest of the Confederate cause, were\r\ncircumstances which distressed us with an apprehension that the entire\r\nSouth would be held responsible for the atrocious occurrence. The day\r\nafter the tragic news reached us, the people of Petersburg in public\r\nmeeting adopted resolutions framed by General Pryor, deploring the\r\nPresident's death and denouncing his assassination,—resolutions which\r\ngave expression to the earnest and universal sentiment of Virginia.\r\nI question if, in any quarter of the country, the virtues of Abraham\r\nLincoln—as exhibited in his spirit of forgiveness and forbearance—are\r\nmore revered than in the very section which was the battle-ground of\r\nthe fight for independence of his rule. It is certainly my husband's\r\nconviction that had he lived, the South would never have suffered the\r\nshame and sorrow of the carpet-bag régime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nMy condition during the military occupation of Petersburg was extremely\r\nunpleasant. I was alone with my children when General Sheridan demanded\r\nmy house for an adjutant's office. Such alarming rumors had reached us\r\nof outrages committed by marauding parties in the neighboring counties\r\nthat my husband had obtained an extension of his parole to visit his\r\nsisters in Nottoway County. His first information of them was from\r\nfinding their garments in a wagon driven by German soldiers, who,\r\nchallenged by the barrel of a pistol, made good their escape, leaving\r\ntheir plunder behind them. The fate of his sisters was not discovered\r\nfor some time. They had found means to hide when the thieves appeared.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sheridan, meanwhile, kept me prisoner in two rooms for ten\r\ndays, and very trying was the experience of those days. He called to\r\n\"make his respects\" to me the day he left, and although I received him\r\ncourteously he was fully aware that I appreciated the indignity he had\r\nput upon me and the record he had made before I met him. He thanked me\r\nfor the patience with which I had endured the ceaseless noise, tramping,\r\nand confusion, night and day, of the adjutant's office, and apologized\r\nfor the policy he had adopted all through the war.\r\n\r\n\"It was the best thing to do,\" he informed me. \"The only way to stamp\r\nout this rebellion was to handle it without gloves.\"\r\n\r\nI made no answer. \"The mailed hand might crush the women and babes,\" I\r\nthought, \"but never, never kill the spirit!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, they departed at last—leaving me a huge gas-bill to pay and a\r\nhouse polluted with dirt and dust. My husband, still a paroled prisoner,\r\nat the end of his leave of absence returned to me and reported to the\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nWe had made the acquaintance of General Warren, who had been superseded\r\nby Sheridan and was now without a command. We grew very fond of him.\r\nHe spent many hours with us. Tactful, sympathetic, and kind, he never\r\ngrieved or offended us. One evening he silently took his seat. Presently\r\nhe said:—\r\n\r\n\"I have news which will be painful to you. It hurts me to tell you, but\r\nI think you had rather hear it from me than from a stranger—General Lee\r\nhas surrendered.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an awful blow to us. All was over. All the suffering, bloodshed,\r\ndeath—all for nothing!\r\n\r\nGeneral Johnston's army was surrendered to General Sherman in North\r\nCarolina on April 26. The banner which had led the armies of the South\r\nthrough fire and blood to victory, to defeat, in times of starvation,\r\ncold, and friendlessness; the banner that many a husband and lover had\r\nwaved aloft on a forlorn hope until it fell from his lifeless hands;\r\nthe banner found under the dying boy at Gettysburg, who had smilingly\r\nrefused assistance lest it be discovered,—the banner of a thousand\r\nhistories was furled forever, with none so poor to do it reverence.\r\n\r\nMy dear general was not free until Johnston surrendered. His flag was\r\nstill in the field, but he was allowed to go to Richmond, twenty miles\r\naway, to seek work of some kind to meet our present necessities. My\r\nservants came in from Cottage Farm, and every one begged to remain and\r\nserve me \"for the good\" I had \"already done them,\" but this, of course,\r\nI could not permit. My faithful John protested passionately against\r\naccepting his freedom, but I was firm in demanding he should return\r\nto his father in Norfolk. He had earned five dollars in United States\r\nmoney; I had five more which my little boys had gained in a small cigar\r\nspeculation. This I gave him.\r\n\r\n\"Now don't let me see you here to-morrow, John. Write to me from\r\nNorfolk.\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning he was gone, and I had a grateful letter from his old\r\nfather, who expressed, however, some anxiety about his \"army habits.\"\r\n\r\nWe had soon occasion to regret the absence of the protecting soldiers.\r\nAlmost immediately a tall, lantern-jawed young fellow with a musket\r\non his shoulder marched in. I was alone, and he walked up to me with a\r\nthreatening aspect.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want here?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I want whiskey—d'ye hear? _Whiskey!_\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll not get it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wall, I rayther guess you'll have to scare it up! I'll search the\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Search away,\" I blithely requested him. \"Search away, and I'll call\r\nthe provost guard to help you!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and marched out. At the door he sent me a Parthian arrow.\r\n\r\n\"Wall! You've got a damned tongue in yer head ef you ain't got no\r\nwhiskey.\"\r\n\r\nI repeat this story because my husband has always considered it a good\r\none—too good to be forgotten!\r\n\r\nThe time now came when I must draw rations for my family. I could not\r\ndo this by proxy. I was required to present my request in person. As\r\nI walked through the streets in early morning, I thought I had never\r\nknown a lovelier day. How could nature spread her canopy of blossoming\r\nmagnolia and locust as if nothing had happened? How could the vine over\r\nthe doorway of my old home load itself with snowy roses, how could the\r\nbirds sing, how could the sun rise, as if such things as these could\r\never again gladden our broken hearts?\r\n\r\nMy dear little sons understood they were to escort me everywhere, so we\r\npresented ourselves together at the desk of the government official and\r\nannounced our errand.\r\n\r\n\"Have you taken the oath of allegiance, madam?\" inquired that gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\" I was quite prepared to take the oath.\r\n\r\nThe young officer looked at me seriously for a moment, and said, as he\r\nwrote out the order:—\r\n\r\n\"Neither will I require it of you, madam!\"\r\n\r\nI was in better spirits after this pleasant incident, and calling to\r\nAlick, I bade him arm himself with the largest basket he could find and\r\ntake my order to the commissary.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to have all sorts of good things,\" I told him, \"fresh\r\nmeat, fruit, vegetables, and everything.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the boy returned, he presented a drooping figure and a woebegone\r\nface. My first unworthy suspicion suggested his possible confiscation\r\nof my stores for drink,—for which my poor Alick had a weakness,—but he\r\nsoon explained.\r\n\r\n\"I buried that ole stinkin' fish! I wouldn't bring it in your presence.\r\nAn' here's the meal they give me.\"\r\n\r\nHairy caterpillars were jumping through the meal! I turned to my table\r\nand wrote:—\r\n\r\n     \"Is the commanding general aware of the nature of the ration\r\n     issued this day to the destitute women of Petersburg?\r\n\r\n                             [Signing myself] \"MRS. ROGER A. PRYOR.\"\r\n\r\nThis I gave to Alick, with instructions to present it, with the meal,\r\nto General Hartsuff.\r\n\r\nAlick returned with no answer; but in a few minutes a tall orderly stood\r\nbefore me, touched his cap, and handed me a note.\r\n\r\n     \"Major-General Hartsuff is sorry he cannot make _right_ all\r\n     that seems so wrong. He sends the enclosed. Some day General\r\n     Pryor will repay.\r\n\r\n                                              \"GEORGE L. HARTSUFF,\r\n                                         \"Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\nThe note contained an official slip of paper:—\r\n\r\n     \"The Quartermaster and Commissary of the Army of the Potomac\r\n     are hereby ordered to furnish Mrs. Roger A. Pryor with all\r\n     she may demand or require, charging the same to the private\r\n     account of\r\n\r\n                                              \"GEORGE L. HARTSUFF,\r\n                                         \"Major-General Commanding.\"\r\n\r\nWithout the briefest deliberation I wrote and returned the following\r\nreply:—\r\n\r\n     \"Mrs. Roger A. Pryor is not insensible to the generous offer\r\n     of Major-General Hartsuff, but _he ought to have known_ that\r\n     the ration allowed the destitute women of Petersburg must be\r\n     enough for\r\n\r\n                                              \"MRS. ROGER A. PRYOR.\"\r\n\r\nAs I sat alone, revolving various schemes for our sustenance,—the\r\nselling of the precious testimonial service (given by the democracy of\r\nVirginia after my husband's noble fight against \"Know-nothing-ism\"),\r\nthe possibility of finding occupation for myself,—the jingling of\r\nchain harness at the door arrested my attention. There stood a handsome\r\nequipage, from which a very fine lady indeed was alighting. She bustled\r\nin with her lace-edged handkerchief to her eyes, and announced herself\r\nas Mrs. Hartsuff. She was superbly gowned in violet silk and lace, with\r\na tiny _fanchon_ bonnet tied beneath an enormous cushion of hair behind,\r\nthe first of the fashionable _chignons_ I had seen,—an arrangement\r\ncalled a \"waterfall,\" an exaggeration of the plethoric, distended \"bun\"\r\nof the Englishwoman of a few years ago.\r\n\r\nI found myself, all at once, conscious that I must, in this lady's eyes,\r\nresemble nothing so much as the wooden Mrs. Noah, who presides over the\r\nanimals in the children's \"Noah's arks.\" Enormous hoops were then in\r\nfashion. I had long since been abandoned by mine, and never been able to\r\nget my own consent to borrow, as others did, from a friendly grape-vine.\r\nMy gown was of chocolate-colored calico with white spots. My hair! I\r\nhad torn it out by the roots when I was delirious at the time of the\r\nfierce battle of Port Walthall (six miles from Petersburg), which I had\r\n_heard_, my senses being quickened by fever.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hartsuff began hurriedly: \"Oh, my dear lady, we are in such\r\ndistress at headquarters! George is in despair! You won't let him help\r\nyou! Whatever is he to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really am grateful to the general,\" I assured her; \"but you see there\r\nis no reason he should do more for me than for others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but there _is_ reason. You have suffered more than the rest. You\r\nhave been driven from your home! Your house has been sacked. George\r\nknows all about you. I have brought a basket for you—tea, coffee, sugar,\r\ncrackers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot accept it, I am sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what are you going to do? Are you going to starve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" I said, \"but somehow I shall not very much mind!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is too utterly, utterly dreadful!\" said the lady as she left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nThe next day the ration was changed. Fresh meat, coffee, sugar, and\r\ncanned vegetables were issued to all the women of Petersburg. The first\r\nmorning they were received I met the wife of General Weisiger trudging\r\nalong with a basket. \"Going for your rations?\" I asked her. \"_No_\r\nindeed! I'm going, with the only five dollars I have in the world, to\r\nthe sutler's! I shall buy, as far as it goes, currants, citron, raisins,\r\nsugar, butter, eggs, brandy, spice—\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy! Are you to open a grocery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it\"—solemnly—\"I'm going to make a _fruit cake_!\"\r\n\r\nLess, one might think, should have contented a starving woman! The\r\nlittle incident is characteristic of the Southern woman's temperament.\r\nShe can lie as patiently as another under the heel of a hard fate, but\r\nthe moment the heel is lifted she is ready for a festival.\r\n\r\nAll the citizens who had been driven away now began to return—among them\r\nthe owners of the house I was occupying, and I was compelled to return\r\nto Cottage Farm. General Hartsuff, to whom I applied for a guard, said\r\nat once:—\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible for you to go to Cottage Farm; there are fifty or more\r\nnegroes on the place. You cannot live there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must! It is my only shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, I'll allow you a guard, and Mrs. Hartsuff had better take\r\nyou out herself, that is, if you can condescend to accept as much.\"\r\n\r\nI was not aware that Mrs. Hartsuff had entered and stood behind me.\r\n\r\n\"And I think, George,\" she said, \"you ought to give Mrs. Pryor a horse\r\nand cart in place of her own that were stolen.\" Before my conscience\r\ncould strengthen itself to protest that I had not owned a horse and\r\ncart, the general exclaimed: \"All right, all right! Madam, you will\r\nfind the guard at your door when you arrive. You go this evening? All\r\nright—good morning.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hartsuff duly appeared in the late afternoon with an ambulance\r\nand four horses, and we departed in fine style. She was very cheery and\r\nagreeable, and made me promise to let her come often to see me. As we\r\nwere galloping along in state, we passed a line of weary-looking dusty\r\nConfederate soldiers, limping along, on their way to their homes. They\r\nstood aside to let us pass. I was cut to the heart at the spectacle.\r\nHere was I, accepting the handsome equipage of the invading commander—I,\r\nwho had done nothing, going on to my comfortable home; while they,\r\npoor fellows, who had borne long years of battle and starvation, were\r\nmournfully returning on foot, to find, perhaps, no home to shelter them.\r\n\"Never again,\" I said to myself, \"shall this happen! If I cannot help,\r\nI can at least suffer with them.\"\r\n\r\nBut when I reached Cottage Farm, I found a home that no soldier, however\r\nforlorn, could have envied me. A scene of desolation met my eyes. The\r\nearth was ploughed and trampled, the grass and flowers were gone, the\r\ncarcasses of six dead cows lay in the yard, and filth unspeakable had\r\ngathered in the corners of the house. The evening air was heavy with\r\nthe odor of decaying flesh. As the front door opened, millions of flies\r\nswarmed forth.\r\n\r\n\"If this were I,\" said Mrs. Hartsuff, as she gathered her skirts as\r\nclosely around her as her hoops would permit, \"I should fall across this\r\nthreshold and die.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not fall,\" I said proudly; \"I shall stand in my lot.\"\r\n\r\nWithin was dirt and desolation. Pieces of fat pork lay on the floors,\r\nmolasses trickled from the library shelves, where bottles lay uncorked.\r\nFilthy, malodorous tin cans were scattered on the floors. Nothing,\r\nnot even a tin dipper to drink out of the well, was left in the house,\r\nexcept one chair out of which the bottom had been cut and one bedstead\r\nfastened together with bayonets. Picture frames were piled against the\r\nwall. I eagerly examined them. Every one was empty. One family portrait\r\nof an old lady was hanging on the wall with a sabre cut across her face.\r\n\r\nTo my great joy Aunt Jinny appeared, full of sympathy and resource. She\r\ngathered us into her kitchen while she swept the cleanest room for us\r\nand spread quilts upon the floor. Later in the evening an ambulance from\r\nMrs. Hartsuff drove up. She had sent me a tin box of bread and butter\r\nsandwiches, some tea, an army cot, and army bedding.\r\n\r\nThe guard, a great tall fellow, came to me for orders. I felt nervous at\r\nhis presence and wished I had not brought him. I directed him to watch\r\nall night at the road side of the house, while I would sit up and keep\r\nwatch in the opposite direction. The children soon slept upon the floor.\r\n\r\nAs the night wore on, I grew extremely anxious about the strange\r\nnegroes. Aunt Jinny thought there were not more than fifty. They had\r\nfilled every outhouse except the kitchen. Suppose they should overpower\r\nthe guard and murder us all!\r\n\r\nEverything was quiet. I had not the least disposition to sleep—thinking,\r\nthinking of all the old woman had told me: of the sacking of the house,\r\nof the digging of the cellar in search of treasure, of the torch that\r\nhad twice been applied to the house and twice withdrawn because some\r\nofficer wanted the shaded dwelling for a temporary lodging. Presently I\r\nwas startled by a shrill scream from the kitchen, a door opened suddenly\r\nand shut, and a voice cried: \"Thank Gawd! Thank Gawd A'mighty!\" Then\r\nall was still.\r\n\r\nWas this a signal? I held my breath and listened, then softly rose,\r\nclosed the shutters and fastened them, crept to the door, and bolted it\r\ninside. I might defend my children till the guard could come.\r\n\r\nEvidently he had not heard! He was probably sleeping the sleep of\r\nan untroubled conscience on the bench in the front porch. And with\r\nuntroubled consciences my children were sleeping. It was so dark in\r\nthe room I could not see their faces, but I could touch them, and push\r\nthe wet locks from their brows, as they lay in the close and heated\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nI resumed my watch at the window, pressing my face close to the slats of\r\nthe shutters. A pale half-moon hung low in the sky, turning its averted\r\nface from a suffering world. At a little distance I could see the\r\nfreshly made soldier's grave which Alick had discovered and reported.\r\nA heavy rain had fallen in the first hours of the night, and a stiff\r\narm and hand now protruded from the shallow grave. To-morrow I would\r\nreverently cover the appealing arm, be it clad in blue or in gray, and\r\nwould mark the spot. Now, as I sat with my fascinated gaze upon it,\r\nI thought of the tens of thousands, of the hundreds of thousands of\r\nupturned faces beneath the green sod of old Virginia. Strong in early\r\nmanhood, grave, high-spirited men of genius, men whom their country had\r\neducated for her own defence in time of peril,—they had died because\r\nthat country could devise in her wisdom no better means of settling a\r\nfamily quarrel than the wholesale slaughter of her sons by the sword.\r\nAnd now? \"Not until the heavens be no more shall they awake nor be\r\nraised out of their sleep.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as I sorrowed for their early death in loneliness and anguish,\r\nI remembered the white-robed souls beneath the altar of God,—the souls\r\nthat had \"come out of great tribulation,\" and _because_ they had thus\r\nsuffered \"they shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more;... and\r\nGod shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as the pale, distressful moon sank behind the trees, and the\r\nred dawn streamed up from the east, the Angel of Hope, who had \"spread\r\nher white wings and sped her away\" for a little season, returned. And\r\nHope held by the hand an angel stronger than she, who bore to me a\r\nmessage: \"In the world ye have tribulations; but be of good cheer; I\r\nhave overcome the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was rising when I saw my good old friend emerge from her\r\nkitchen, and I opened the shutters to greet her. She had brought me\r\na cup of delicious coffee, and was much distressed because I had not\r\nslept. Had I heard anything?\r\n\r\n\"'Course I know you was bleeged to hear,\" said Aunt Jinny, as she\r\nbustled over the children. \"That was Sis' Winny! She got happy in the\r\nmiddle of the night, an' Gawd knows what she would have done if Frank\r\nhadn't ketched hold of her and pulled her back in the kitchen! Frank an'\r\nme is pretty nigh outdone an' discouraged 'bout Sis' Winny. She prays\r\nconstant all day; but Gawd A'mighty don't count on being bothered all\r\nnight. Ain't He 'ranged for us all to sleep, an' let Him have a little\r\npeace? Sis' Winny must keep her happiness to herself, when folks is\r\ntrying to git some res'.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard now came to my window to say he \"guessed\" he'd \"have to put\r\non some more harness. Them blamed niggers refused to leave. They might\r\nchange their minds when they saw the pistols.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you wouldn't shoot, would you?\" I said in great distress. \"Call\r\nthem all to the back door and let me speak with them.\" I found myself\r\nin the presence of some seventy-five negroes, men, women, and children,\r\nall with upturned faces, keenly interested in what I should say to them.\r\n\r\nI talked to them kindly and explained my presence, asking them to\r\nremain, if they would help clean the yard, with the result that Abram\r\nand Beverly, two old men who had known my general in his boyhood,\r\npledged themselves to stay with me on the terms I suggested.\r\n\r\nTo my great joy, my dear husband returned from Richmond. There was\r\nno hope there for lucrative occupation. He had no profession. He had\r\nforgotten all the little law he had learned at the university. He had\r\nbeen an editor, diplomat, politician, and soldier, and distinguished\r\nhimself in all four. These were now closed to him forever! There seemed\r\nto be no room for a rebel in all the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nWe found it almost impossible to take up our lives again. All the cords\r\nbinding us to the past were severed, beyond the hope of reunion. We sat\r\nsilently looking out on a landscape marked here and there by chimneys\r\nstanding sentinel over blackened heaps, where our neighbors had made\r\nhappy homes. Only one remained, Mr. Green's, beyond a little ravine\r\nacross the road.\r\n\r\nWe had, fortunately, no inclination to read. A few books had been\r\nsaved, only those for which we had little use. A soldier walked in one\r\nday with a handsome volume which Jefferson Davis, after inscribing his\r\nname in it, had presented to the general. The soldier calmly requested\r\nthe former owner to be kind enough to add to the value of the volume\r\nby writing beneath the inscription his own autograph, and his request\r\ngranted, walked off with it under his arm. \"He has been at some\r\ntrouble,\" said my husband, \"and he had as well be happy if I cannot!\"\r\n\r\nAs the various brigades moved away from our neighborhood, a few plain\r\narticles of furniture that had been taken from the house were restored\r\nto us, but nothing handsome or valuable, no books nor pictures,—just\r\na few chairs and tables. I had furnished an itemized list of all the\r\narticles we had lost, with only this result.\r\n\r\nWe had news after a while of our blooded mare, Lady Jane. A letter\r\nenclosing her photograph came from a New England officer:—\r\n\r\n     \"TO MR. PRYOR,\r\n\r\n     \"_Dear Sir_: A very fine mare belonging to you came into my\r\n     camp near Richmond and is now with me. It would add much to\r\n     her value if I could get her pedigree. Kindly send it at your\r\n     earliest convenience, and oblige,\r\n\r\n                                               \"Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                                               \"— —.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. The mare is in good health, as you will doubtless be\r\n     glad to know.\"\r\n\r\nDisposed as my general was to be amiable, this was a little too much!\r\nThe pedigree was not sent, but later the amiable owner of Lady Jane sent\r\nher photograph. Also his own—on her back.\r\n\r\nA great number of tourists soon began to pass our house on their way\r\nto visit the localities near us, now become historic. They frequently\r\ncalled upon us, claiming some common acquaintance. We could not but\r\nresent this. Their sympathetic attitude offended us, sore and proud as\r\nwe were.\r\n\r\nWe were perfectly aware that they wished to see _us_, and not to gain,\r\nas they affected, information about the historic localities on the farm.\r\nStill less did they desire ignobly to triumph over us. A boy, when\r\nhe tears off the wings of a fly, is much interested in observing its\r\nactions, not that he is cruel—far from it! He is only curious to see how\r\nthe creature will behave under very disadvantageous circumstances.\r\n\r\nOne day a clergyman called, with a card of introduction from Mrs.\r\nHartsuff, who had, I imagine, small discernment as regards clergymen.\r\nThis one was a smug little man, sleek, unctuous, and trim, with\r\nPecksniffian self-esteem oozing out of every pore of his face.\r\n\r\n\"Well, madam,\" he commenced, \"I trust I find you lying meekly under\r\nthe chastening rod of the Lord. I trust you can say 'it is good I was\r\nafflicted.'\"\r\n\r\nHaving no suitable answer just ready, I received his pious exhortation\r\nin silence. One can always safely do this with a clergyman.\r\n\r\n\"There are seasons,\" continued the good man, \"when chastisement must\r\nbe meted out to the transgressor; but if borne in the right spirit, the\r\nrod may blossom with blessings in the end.\"\r\n\r\nA little more of the same nature wrung from me the query, \"Are there\r\nnone on the other side who need the rod?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh—well, now—my dear lady! You must consider! You were in the wrong in\r\nthis unhappy contest, or, I should say, this most righteous war.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Væ victis!_\" I exclaimed. \"Our homes were invaded. We are on our own\r\nsoil!\"\r\n\r\nMy reverend brother grew red in the face. Rising and bowing himself out,\r\nhe sent me a Parthian arrow:—\r\n\r\n     \"No thief e'er felt the halter draw\r\n     With good opinion of the law.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately my general was absent at the moment. Like the Douglas, he\r\nhad endured much, but—\r\n\r\n     \"Last and worst, to spirit proud\r\n     To bear the pity of the crowd\"—\r\n\r\nthis was more than he could endure.\r\n\r\nThe suggestive odors within doors could never be stifled or cleansed\r\naway. Not before October could I get my consent to eat a morsel in the\r\nhouse. I took my meals under the trees, unless driven by the rains to\r\nthe shelter of the porch. I suffered terribly for want of occupation.\r\nI had no household to manage, no garments to mend or make. My little\r\nLucy could not bear the sun, and she sat quietly beside me all day. I\r\ncould have made a sun-bonnet for her, but I had no fabric, no thimble,\r\nneedles, thread, or scissors. Finally I discovered in the pocket of\r\none of my Washington coats my silver card-case with Trinity Church on\r\none side and the Capitol at Washington on the other,—objects I had now\r\nno right to hold dear. I made Alick drive me in my little farm cart to\r\nthe sutler's and effected an exchange for a small straw \"Shaker\" bonnet\r\nwhich I am sure could have been purchased for less than one dollar.\r\nProtected with this, the little girl found a play-house under the trees.\r\nA good old friend, Mr. Kemp, invited the boys to accompany him upon\r\nrelic-hunting expeditions to the narrow plain which had divided the\r\nopposing lines on that fateful April morning just three months before.\r\nRopes were fastened around extinct shells, and they were hauled in,\r\nto stand sentinel at the door. The shells were short cylinders, with\r\none pointed end like a candle before it is lighted. Numbers of minie\r\nballs were dug out of the sand. One day Mr. Kemp brought in a great\r\ncuriosity—two bullets welded together, having been shot from opposing\r\nrifles.\r\n\r\nThe sultry days were begun and rounded by hours of listless endurance\r\nfollowed by troubled sleep. A bag of army \"hard-tack\" stood in a corner,\r\nso the children were never hungry. Presently they, too, sat around us,\r\ntoo listless to play or talk. A great army of large, light brown Norway\r\nrats now overran the farm. They would walk to the corner before our eyes\r\nand help themselves to the army ration. We never moved a finger to drive\r\nthem away. After a while Alick appeared with an enormous black-and-white\r\ncat.\r\n\r\n\"Dis is jest a lettle mo'n I can stand,\" said Alick. \"De Yankees\r\nhas stole ev'rything, and dug up de whole face o' de yearth—and de\r\nJews comes all de time and pizens de well, droppin' down chains an'\r\ngrapplin'-irons to see ef we-all has hid silver—but I ain' obleedged to\r\nstan' sassyness fum dese outlandish rats.\"\r\n\r\nAlick had to surrender. The very first night after the arrival of his\r\nvaliant cat there was a scuffle in the room where the crackers were\r\nkept, a chair was overturned, and a flying cat burst through the hall,\r\npursued by three or four huge rats. The cat took refuge in a tree, and\r\nstealthily descending at an opportune moment, stole away and left the\r\nfield to the enemy.\r\n\r\nOf course there could be but one result from this life. Malaria had hung\r\nover us for weeks, and now one after another of the children lay down\r\nupon the \"pallets\" on the floor, ill with fever. Then I succumbed and\r\nwas violently ill. Our only nurse was my dear general; and not in all\r\nthe years when he never shirked a duty, nor lost a march, nor rode on\r\nhis own horse when his men toiled on foot or if one failed by the way,\r\nnor ever lost one of the battles in which he personally led them,—not\r\nin all those trying times was he nobler, grander than in his long\r\nand lonely vigils beside his sick family. And most nobly did the aged\r\nnegress, my blessed Aunt Jinny, stand by us. My one fevered vision was\r\nof an ebony idol.\r\n\r\nGeneral and Mrs. Hartsuff were terribly afraid of the Southern fevers,\r\nbut sent us sympathetic messages from the gate. But as soon as I\r\ncould receive him, Captain Gregory, the commissary general, sought\r\nan interview with me. General Hartsuff had sent him to say that it\r\nwas absolutely necessary for General Pryor to leave Virginia. He had\r\nnever been pardoned. There were men in power who constantly hinted at\r\npunishment and retribution. He had been approached by General Hartsuff\r\nand vehemently refused to leave his family.\r\n\r\n\"Where, oh, where could he go?\" I pleaded. \"He does think sometimes of\r\nNew Orleans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said Captain Gregory, \"there is a future before your husband.\r\nNew York is the place for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will never, never consent to go there,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, we must use a little diplomacy. Send him by sea to shake\r\noff his chills. Mark my words—as soon as he registers in New York,\r\nfriends will gather around him. Only _send_ him—and speedily. I come\r\nfrom General Hartsuff.\"\r\n\r\nMy Theo was listening to this conversation, and when Captain Gregory\r\nleft, he implored me to obey him. Without consulting his father the old\r\nhorse General Hartsuff had given me was hitched to the little cart,\r\nand we set forth to find some broker who would lend us a small sum,\r\nreceiving my watch and diamond ring as pledges for repayment.\r\n\r\nAfter several failures we found an obliging banker who lent me, upon\r\nmy proposed security, three hundred dollars. As I left his office my\r\nhand instinctively sought my little watch to learn the hour. It was\r\ngone!—pledged to send my general to New York. I bought some quinine and\r\nordered my husband's tailor to make without delay a suit of clothes to\r\nreplace the threadbare uniform of Confederate gray. It was difficult\r\nto persuade the wearer to accept the proposition—which was only for the\r\nsea voyage in order to break the chills that shook him so relentlessly\r\nevery third day. Nothing was farther from my thought or wishes than a\r\npermanent residence in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that my husband would be absent only a week. The\r\nfollowing letter from New York explains his delay:—\r\n\r\n     \"I had intended leaving here yesterday, but our friend,\r\n     General Warren, invited me for dinner Sunday. I find him in\r\n     a handsome house in a fashionable quarter of the city. Mrs.\r\n     Warren inquired kindly about you. She has two charming sisters\r\n     of our Gordon's age.\r\n\r\n     \"What will you think when I tell you that several gentlemen\r\n     suggest to me to settle here? Dare I 'then, to beard the\r\n     lion in his den—the Douglas in his hall!' Not in his 'hall,'\r\n     certainly, unless I am very specially invited by him, but\r\n     I might in time wrestle with him, in a court-room. I have a\r\n     mind to try it. 'The world is all before us where to choose.'\r\n     I shouldn't like the Douglas to find out I have forgotten\r\n     all the law I ever knew. Neither would I like my good old\r\n     Professor Minor (if he reads the N. Y. reports) to make a\r\n     similar discovery.\"\r\n\r\nClose upon this letter followed another.\r\n\r\n     \"I am not yet determined when to return. I was to leave this\r\n     morning, but Mr. Ben Wood of the _News_ has requested me to\r\n     remain a day or two that he might have a talk with me. What\r\n     this means, I am not sure. I conjecture he will propose some\r\n     connection with his paper. By the last of the week you may\r\n     expect me with you.\"\r\n\r\nThe last of the week found him still in New York. Early in October he\r\nwrote:—\r\n\r\n     \"I have accepted Mr. Wood's proposition _for the present_.\r\n     The only difficulty I see is the fact that they refuse me a\r\n     pardon. If they learn that I am writing for the _News_, they\r\n     may send me to keep company with John Mitchell. I understand\r\n     that charges are constantly made against me in Washington.\r\n     Whatever they are, they are false, trumped up to serve some\r\n     sinister purpose. Yet I am resolved not to degrade myself by\r\n     any abject submission. I have never solicited 'pardon,' and\r\n     I mean to approach them with no further overture.\r\n\r\n     \"I am so glad you liked the box. Don't scold me for\r\n     extravagance. You have suffered long enough for the mere\r\n     decencies of life. I am going to work like a beaver and with\r\n     no other purpose now than to earn a living for my dear wife\r\n     and children. Ambition! The ambition of my life is to have\r\n     my darlings settled in comfort. May God assist me in the\r\n     endeavor!\r\n\r\n     \"My room is at 47 West 12th Street. There you must send my\r\n     winter clothes—and we must try, whatever is left undone, to\r\n     send the boys to school.\"\r\n\r\nBut after a week or two he became discouraged at the cost of living in\r\nNew York, and wavered again.\r\n\r\n     \"I feel I cannot bear a long separation from my dear family—my\r\n     darling little ones. And yet how can I maintain them here?\r\n     Is it not a cruel fortune which tears us asunder when our\r\n     delight in each other is about the only source of happiness\r\n     left us in this world? I shall lose, in this hopeless grind,\r\n     all the elastic energy of my mind. I cannot live without you!\r\n     Do you advise me to continue my connection with the _News_?\r\n     Twenty-five dollars a week is a pitiful sum, but how can I\r\n     do better? If I can only procure the comforts of life for my\r\n     family! That is my only object in life—fame, ambition, office,\r\n     all these things I have renounced forever. Is it not hard\r\n     that one should be baffled in so reasonable an endeavor? I can\r\n     leave here at any moment, my connection with the paper being\r\n     that of a mere contributor. I am not at all responsible for\r\n     its course, but only for my own articles.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in December my husband wrote me the following letter:—\r\n\r\n     \"I am still the victim of ague and fever—the worst I ever\r\n     suffered. The chill comes on every alternate day, and during\r\n     its continuance—about two hours—I am tortured with the most\r\n     agonizing nausea, followed by fever. Thus I spend two days in\r\n     every week. Dr. Whitehead attends me and expects to relieve\r\n     me, but meanwhile it is very annoying to be so stricken just\r\n     as one enters the fight.\r\n\r\n     \"For I _have_ entered the fight! The die is cast—and here I\r\n     mean to remain, 'sink or swim, survive or perish.' This is\r\n     the way it has all come about.\r\n\r\n     \"Sitting late one night with Mr. Ben Wood in the _News_\r\n     office, he turned to me and said rather abruptly, 'General,\r\n     why don't you practise law? You would make $10,000 a year.'\r\n     I answered, 'For the best of all possible reasons—I am not\r\n     a lawyer.' He replied, 'Neither is C, nor T; yet _they_ make\r\n     $10,000 a year.'\r\n\r\n     \"Of course the idea of my ever making so great a sum was\r\n     too preposterous for a moment's thought. Nevertheless, Mr.\r\n     Wood pressed the appeal; and being enforced by McMasters of\r\n     the _Freeman's Journal_, it made an impression on my mind.\r\n     I said nothing to you about it at the time, because I had,\r\n     until within the last few weeks, reached no decision in the\r\n     matter. But just then I received an invitation from Mr. Luke\r\n     Cozzens for temporary desk room in his office and the use of\r\n     his library. I have really borrowed books and been studying\r\n     law in my leisure hours ever since I came to the city, and I\r\n     now resolved to make application for admittance to the Bar!\r\n     The application was made by James T. Brady, the most eminent\r\n     of our forensic orators. I was required to make affidavit of\r\n     my residence in the State, and some other formal facts, but\r\n     such was my ignorance of legal procedure that I was unable to\r\n     draw the affidavit, which Judge Barnard perceiving, he kindly\r\n     drew the paper for me. Thereupon the Hon. John B. Haskins—my\r\n     former associate in Congress—was appointed to examine me as to\r\n     my knowledge of Law. Under his lead we went to a restaurant.\r\n     When seated he proceeded, with much solemnity of manner, to\r\n     'examine' me. He asked me, 'What are the essentials of the\r\n     negotiability of a note?' This question I was prepared to\r\n     answer, and did answer to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     \"After a 'judicial pause,' he asked gravely, 'What will you\r\n     take?'\r\n\r\n     \"This also I was fully prepared to answer—and entirely to his\r\n     satisfaction.\r\n\r\n     \"He asked me no other question. He was apparently satisfied\r\n     with the good sense of my last answer. We returned to the\r\n     Court, and he reported in favor of my application!\r\n\r\n     \"Still an insuperable obstacle to my practising was an\r\n     inability to procure an office, for my desk room at Mr.\r\n     Cozzens's was not suitable for my new dignity. This difficulty\r\n     has been removed by the offer of Mr. Hughes (an English\r\n     'sympathizer') to allow me the use of one of his two rooms\r\n     for the nominal price of $1 a month in Tryon Row. Both he and\r\n     I have learned since that this is considered an undesirable\r\n     locality—a fact of which we were ignorant, but here I must\r\n     remain until I can better myself. My room is perfectly bare—a\r\n     carpetless floor, plain uncovered table, and three chairs—one\r\n     for myself, and the others for possible clients. Here I have\r\n     swung out my modest shingle soliciting the patronage of the\r\n     public.\r\n\r\n     \"I have commenced attending the Courts regularly and have\r\n     heard the leading lawyers. I am not vain, as you know, but—_I\r\n     am not afraid of them!_ But when, when shall I have a chance?\r\n     The great difficulty in my way is the prejudice against\r\n     'rebels'; and that I am sorry to see is not diminishing. I\r\n     hope to wear it away after a while if, meantime, I do not\r\n     starve. It is my last cast—and I am resolved to succeed or\r\n     perish in the attempt. Several New York papers have spoken of\r\n     my residence here with kindness and compliment, but a silly\r\n     sneer in the _Boston Post_—under which I am fool enough to\r\n     suffer—cut me to the heart, trifling and flippant as it is:\r\n     'The Rebel Pryor has opened an office in New York for the\r\n     practice of the Law, but he has not yet had a _rap_.'—(R. A.\r\n     P.).\r\n\r\n     \"Look now for uninteresting letters. It will be study, _study,\r\n     study_, ever after this! I am writing now at night, with a\r\n     languid head. My children—my dear children! How I love them!\r\n     God bless them!\"\r\n\r\nHe wrote, December 28:—\r\n\r\n     \"My prospects here had brightened a little with the promise\r\n     of a case that would, in time, have yielded me two hundred\r\n     dollars, but a friendly priest (and he was wise) persuaded the\r\n     parties to settle out of Court, and so my hopes were dashed to\r\n     the ground. But I am retained, provisionally, as counsel for\r\n     the National Express Company, from which I may make something.\r\n     My thoughts at Christmas in my lonely office were with my\r\n     precious household at Cottage Farm. How I regretted my want of\r\n     money would not permit me to send some holiday presents, but\r\n     we must bear these privations till happier days. I longed to\r\n     go to you—but had no money to defray the expense of the trip.\r\n     Dearest Sara, let us endure these trials with all possible\r\n     fortitude. If only you can keep happy, I can bear my portion\r\n     of the burden.\"\r\n\r\nIn February he wrote me:—\r\n\r\n     \"To-day I make a reckoning of my earnings since my residence\r\n     in New York. I was admitted to the Bar about the first of\r\n     December. I have been 'practising,' then, about two months\r\n     and a half. Well, my receipts for sundry small services have\r\n     been $356, and I am retained by an express company. I wonder\r\n     if this looks as if we are 'out of the woods.' Unhappily I\r\n     have had to pay a debt incurred when I was in Fort Lafayette,\r\n     and for which I had provided money, but it was embezzled by\r\n     a dishonest quartermaster at the Fort. Then the small debts\r\n     we owed when we left Washington—and which, you remember, the\r\n     Confederate Government 'confiscated' and for which exacted\r\n     payment—have simply waited for me to get work, and these\r\n     I must promptly pay. However, I am hopeful. God grant my\r\n     anticipations may be realized.\r\n\r\n     \"I have some little money owing to me and some doubtful\r\n     claims, and the Court and lawyers treat me with marked\r\n     courtesy. I study intensely and am as diligent as possible\r\n     in attention to my duties. I mean at least to deserve\r\n     success—which is the surest way to realize it. Kiss the\r\n     chicks!\r\n\r\n                                                     \"Devotedly,\r\n                                                           \"R. A. P.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S.

Next summer we must have our _home_, and\r\n     won't it be a happy home? God grant it. God bless us all.\"\r\n\r\nAlas, the next letter announced the fading of the \"gleam of light\" into\r\ndarkness and disappointment.\r\n\r\n     \"I thought I had two _good_ cases this week, but my clients\r\n     decided not to sue. Oh, how weary I am of this life! But there\r\n     is no escape, and I must not despond. Stimulate the boys to\r\n     diligence in their studies. Is Billy still mischievous? And\r\n     Lucy demure? Ah, Fan! apple of my eye, how I love you! How I\r\n     long to see you all! The bright, the happy day will soon come,\r\n     I pray. Heaven only knows how I pine for my family; but my\r\n     first duty is to feed them, and until that is accomplished I\r\n     must forego every personal gratification.\r\n\r\n     \"I am convinced the chief obstacle to my success is the\r\n     prejudice against 'rebels.' That is fearful, and I feel its\r\n     effects every day. I was lately employed as a referee to\r\n     report the facts in an application for the discharge of a\r\n     prisoner by the process of _habeas corpus_. When my name as\r\n     referee was announced, one of the counsel arose and protested\r\n     to the Court that he would not appear before a rebel whose\r\n     hands were yet red with loyal blood. Thereupon, of course,\r\n     I declined the appointment. Still, I must toil on, nothing\r\n     disheartened. The memory of the little household at Cottage\r\n     Farm animates and sustains me in my troubles. May God bless\r\n     and prosper us!\r\n\r\n                                                     \"Devotedly,\r\n                                                          \"R. A. P.\"\r\n\r\nMy dear aunt had now joined me with my little girls. One night I was\r\nawakened by a voice speaking to me under my window. There stood a negro\r\nman. \"Mr. Green wants you right away, madam,\" he said. \"He thinks he's\r\ndying, an' he says he is _obliged_ to see you. I brought a note.\"\r\n\r\nThe note from a relative of Mr. Green confirmed the man's statement,\r\nadding: \"Let nothing prevent your coming. George will take care of you.\"\r\n\r\nMy aunt felt a little nervous at so strange and peremptory a summons,\r\nbut at last we decided I must go. She could see me in the moonlight\r\nevery step of the way, down the path, across the little bridge at the\r\nbottom of the ravine, and up the ascent beyond. So I dressed hurriedly\r\nand departed.\r\n\r\nI found the house in darkness and silence. The lady who had written\r\nme took me into her room and whispered her story. Mr. Green was\r\nextremely ill and in great distress because he had made no will.\r\nThe house was full of his relatives, gathered because his death was\r\nexpected. He wished to leave everything he possessed to his wife and\r\nyoungest daughter, Nannie. He had provided for the others—given them\r\ntheir portion. He could not secretly summon a lawyer from town. He was\r\nmiserably anxious, sleepless, and unhappy.\r\n\r\nTo-night he had found himself alone with this relative who was nursing\r\nhim, and drawing her down to his pillow, had begged her \"Send for Mrs.\r\nPryor—_now_ and quick. She will write for me.\"\r\n\r\nI knew him only by sight, and I was, of course, surprised. But I did not\r\nhesitate. I was at once introduced into his room, and by the light of a\r\nsolitary candle burning upon the floor in a corner I dimly discerned the\r\ngray head and closed eyes of the sick man. He was sleeping peacefully,\r\nand we dared not awaken him. Pen, ink, and paper were given me, and\r\nprone upon my elbows and knees in the dim corner, I wrote a will,\r\nrepeating faithfully the words I had received, beginning: \"In the name\r\nof Almighty God—Amen—I, William Green,\" etc.\r\n\r\nWe then awaited in silence the waking of the sick man. Very gently I\r\ntold him my errand, and read twice what I had written, asking him again\r\nand again, \"Are you sure you do not wish to leave anything whatever\r\nto your other children?\" \"_No, no, no!_\" he answered. I put my arm\r\nbeneath him, raised him, and the paper was laid on a pillow before him.\r\nHe looked around helplessly. His spectacles! We placed them, and with\r\nthe pen in trembling fingers he signed his name, and uttered the last\r\nwords he probably ever spoke,—\"Three witnesses!\" His relative signed,\r\nI signed, and the negro nurse signed with her mark.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'll send you home,\" said his friend, when we left the room.\r\n\"No,\" I said, \"I can do nothing clandestine. I must stay and tell his\r\nrelatives how I come to be here.\"\r\n\r\nVery early they all assembled and I said: \"I was sent for by your father\r\nlast night to write his will. If it should displease any one of you,\r\nremember he only used my hand. He understood perfectly what he was\r\ndoing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure it is all right, as far as I am concerned,\" said one. \"I have\r\nalways known this place was to be left to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing I can reveal,\" I assured her.\r\n\r\nThat day Mr. Green died. His will was admitted to probate and never\r\ncontested.\r\n\r\nEarly in February old Abram, the faithful servant in whose care my\r\nhusband left me, announced that we had reached the end of all our\r\nresources at Cottage Farm. Rose, the little cow, had died, the turnips\r\nand potatoes Abram had raised were all gone, the two pigs he had reared\r\nhad fulfilled their destiny long ago, and the government rations had\r\nceased. He \"could scuffle along himself, but 'twa'n't no use to pertend\"\r\nhe could \"take care of mistis an' the chilluns, not like they ought to\r\nbe took care of.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must not despair, Abram,\" I said. \"We'll feed the children, never\r\nfear! I must plan something to help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plannin' ain't no 'count, mistis, less'n you got sump'n to work on.\r\nWhat we-all goin' to do for wood?\"\r\n\r\n\"What you have done all along, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"No'm. Dat's onpossible. We done burn up Fort Gregg an' Battery 45. Der\r\nain' no mo' fortifications on de place as I knows of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortifications!\" I exclaimed. \"Why, Abram! you surely haven't been\r\nburning the fortifications!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hit's des like I tell you, mistis. De las' stick's on yo' woodpile now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Abram,\" I said gravely, \"if we have destroyed our\r\nfortifications—burned our bridges—the time has come to change our base.\r\nWe will move into town.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, without food or fuel, and without Abram, we could not live in\r\nthe country. The fields were a desolate waste, with no fences to protect\r\na possible crop or to keep cattle within bounds. Abram saw no hope from\r\ncultivation—nothing to \"work on.\" He had been a refugee from a lower\r\nplantation, and he was now inclined to put out his children to service,\r\nand return in his old age to his old home and to his old master, who\r\nlonged to welcome him. He was a grand old man. I doubt not he has a warm\r\nplace in the bosom of that other Abram the faithful, but no whit more\r\nfaithful than he.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon before our departure from Cottage Farm, the weather was so\r\ndeliciously balmy that I walked over the garden and grounds, thinking\r\nof the great drama that had been enacted on this spot. The spring\r\ncomes early in the lower counties of Virginia. Already the grass was\r\nspringing, and on the trees around the well which had so often refreshed\r\nGeneral Lee, tender young leaves were trembling. Spring had come to\r\ntouch all scars with her gentle finger-tips. Over all the battle-torn\r\nground, over the grave of the young soldier who had lain so long under\r\nmy window, over the track ploughed by shot and shell, she had spread a\r\ndelicate bloom like a smile on the lips of the dead.\r\n\r\nMuch of my last night at Cottage Farm was spent at the window from which\r\nI had watched on that anxious night of my first home-coming. The home\r\nhad been polluted, sacked, desecrated—and yet I was leaving it with\r\nregret. Many a hard battle with illness, with want, with despair, had\r\nbeen fought within those walls. It seemed like a long, dark night in\r\nwhich neither sun nor moon nor stars had appeared; during which we had\r\nsimply endured, watching ourselves the while, jealous lest the natural\r\nrebound of youthful hope and spirit should surprise us, and dishonor\r\nthose who had suffered and bled and died for our sakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March my husband wrote a letter of warm congratulation upon my\r\nsuccess in gathering all our children together, and sent me a sum\r\nto be used in sending them to school. That I might aid my husband to\r\nmend our fortunes, I persuaded seven of my neighbors' children to take\r\nmusic lessons from me. The boys were entered to Mr. Gordon McCabe—the\r\naccomplished gentleman and scholar so well known and so popular in\r\nEngland as well as at home. My daughter Gordon entered an excellent\r\nschool of which Professor Davis was principal. The older children had\r\nbeen taught by the Rev. William Hoge, who had been pastor of the Brick\r\nChurch on Fifth Avenue, New York. They were well instructed in Greek,\r\nLatin, and mathematics, and eagerly embraced their new opportunities.\r\nBefore we left Virginia Gordon graduated in her school, and the boys\r\ntook honors of their accomplished preceptor,—Theo winning the first\r\nprize—the Pegram prize, ordained to commemorate Mr. McCabe's colonel,\r\n\"who died with all his wounds in front.\" The children's father longed\r\nall the more—were that possible—for his home. He writes March 15:—\r\n\r\n     \"Beg Gordon to apply herself diligently to my books—or what\r\n     is left of them. She must read Wilson's 'Essay on Burns,'\r\n     Macaulay's essays—Jeffrey, Wilson, and Sydney Smith. She must\r\n     study Russell's 'Modern Europe,' and must read Pope, Cowper,\r\n     and other poets. I wish her to be the most brilliant girl of\r\n     the day. These accomplishments may stand her in better stead\r\n     than others of mere display. McCabe will push the boys.\r\n\r\n     \"I know I have written you despondent letters, but I do not\r\n     despair! I am only depressed by my physical weakness and by my\r\n     very great difficulties, _but here I mean to stay!_ It is my\r\n     last cast in the game of life, and if I fail now, all is lost.\r\n     I am writing again for the _News_. I need the money to support\r\n     us. The Law is so slow—so uncertain that I almost despair.\r\n     If I had a little farm in the country and barely enough for\r\n     existence, I would be content, _provided_ I could have my\r\n     family and the enjoyment of their society. You can have no\r\n     idea how miserable is my life here. It is enough to make me\r\n     crazy. I can hardly endure it. I do trust your Christian\r\n     fortitude enables you to bear our misfortunes better than\r\n     I can. You have the children! Roger has written me a sweet\r\n     letter, for which I thank him. I trust they all care a little\r\n     for me! Poor papa, so lonely and sad without his home! Kiss\r\n     them all for me. I love them more than all the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe hour before the dawn is always, we are told, a dark hour. This was\r\na dark hour indeed, but the dawn was near. Alas, there were yet many\r\nnights of darkness, many mornings of fitful dawning, before the sun\r\nrose clearly on better days! My husband's sensitive spirit responded as\r\nquickly to the humor of a situation as to pathos and tragedy. Very soon\r\nafter the mournful letter I received the following:—\r\n\r\n     \"'The Rebel Pryor' has had 'a _rap_' at last—a rap with no\r\n     uncertain significance. I have had a call from a _bona fide_\r\n     client!\r\n\r\n     \"Quite unexpectedly this morning a stalwart and evidently\r\n     brusque person entered, and accosting me asked, 'Is your name\r\n     Pryor?' I had to acknowledge the damaging fact! 'Well,' he\r\n     said, 'my name is \"France.\" Ben Wood has sent me to you to\r\n     argue a case I have in Court. Now I have as many lawsuits as\r\n     any man in the United States, and experience has taught me\r\n     never to retain a lawyer until we have agreed upon all I am\r\n     to pay for his services.'\r\n\r\n     \"To this I assented, but added that as I did not know what his\r\n     case might be, I could not indicate any terms of employment.\r\n\r\n     \"He replied, 'I live in Baltimore. I am at the head of all\r\n     the Lottery business in the United States. My business has\r\n     failed, and I'm trying to get discharge under your Two Thirds\r\n     Act.' Now I had never heard of the Two Thirds Act, and had\r\n     no notion what he meant, but this fact, you may be sure, I\r\n     did not communicate to my intending client. At this point I\r\n     made a bad break. I said, 'Mr. France, you know I have been\r\n     practising in New York a very short time, and of course I am\r\n     quite ignorant of the rate of charges here.' Instantly it\r\n     occurred to me that he would draw an inference not only of\r\n     my ignorance of fees, but of the law itself. Fortunately the\r\n     reflection seemed to escape him. My object was, of course,\r\n     to avoid designating the amount of the fee myself. I wanted\r\n     to ask him fifty dollars, but I had a dreadful fear that the\r\n     proposition would drive him out of the office, and I would\r\n     not get even twenty-five,—which I would gladly have accepted.\r\n     I begged him to name the fee, with the assurance of whatever\r\n     it might be I would accept it.\r\n\r\n     \"He answered, 'I never _prize_' (this he pronounced _price_)\r\n     'any man's labor.' Still I persisted in the endeavor to throw\r\n     the burden of the offer upon him. He became angered, and fumed\r\n     a bit, but finally said:—\r\n\r\n     \"'Little Owen' (a very able English solicitor who has settled\r\n     in New York in the practice of Bankruptcy and Insolvency\r\n     proceedings)—'Little Owen has served all the citations and\r\n     prepared all the other necessary papers, and all you will\r\n     have to do will be to argue the question of my discharge on\r\n     the return day of the motion, three weeks hence. Now—I will\r\n     make with you the same agreement that I have made with Mr.\r\n     Owen—which is five hundred dollars cash, and one thousand if\r\n     you procure my application.'\r\n\r\n     \"With the utmost dignity and appearance of reluctance I\r\n     said, 'Mr. France, you have my word that I would accept any\r\n     offer you might make, and of course I will agree to this sum,\r\n     however inadequate the compensation may be.' Going down into\r\n     his pockets he drew out five hundred dollars in notes, which\r\n     he gave me, and which I am sending you through Bob McIlwane.\r\n     Let me know when you receive it. I mean to win the thousand!\r\n     Expect no more long letters! Between this hour and the day of\r\n     argument I shall think of, dream of, no subject on earth but\r\n     the Two Thirds Act!\"\r\n\r\nHe argued the motion and won it. The court and lawyers treated him\r\nkindly, and the judge said, \"It is a great privilege to hear a good\r\nargument from an able lawyer!\" He was soon employed in other cases.\r\nHis letters now exhibited the most hopeful temper. \"I am overwhelmed,\"\r\nhe wrote me, \"with business for the Southern Express Company. It keeps\r\nme employed night and day, but so far has yielded me no money. I hope,\r\nhowever, eventually to get a fee that shall compensate me for all my\r\nlabor, so I am encouraged to work on. I am sure of success! I feel\r\nit in me. Let us crowd all sail, and not languish in despair. Did\r\nyou ever know any one who lived honestly, worked hard, and exerted\r\ncompetent talent to fail in any enterprise of life? I think we have\r\ncompetent ability; as for the rest I am certain; my health is perfect.\r\nThe debility which so oppressed me is succeeded by perfect health and\r\nvigor.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all because of the one-thousand-dollar fee (half of which he\r\nalready owed) from Mr. France, the lottery dealer! Wherever he is,—and\r\nI trust he lives to read these words,—I have for him, now and always,\r\nmy grateful blessing.\r\n\r\nAs for the Express Company,—the brilliant hopes from that quarter melted\r\nas does the baseless fabric of a dream. The company became hopelessly\r\ninsolvent, and for the promised fee of three thousand dollars paid its\r\nhard-worked counsel nothing.\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1866-1867 was marked with fluctuating hopes and\r\ndisappointments. The great labor in the interests of the Express Company\r\nhad yielded nothing.\r\n\r\n     \"The Express Company is insolvent beyond redemption [my\r\n     husband wrote me]. This involves a loss to me of $3000—and\r\n     again delays indefinitely the reunion with my family here. I\r\n     am not dismayed, however, _au contraire!_ My present impulse\r\n     is to retrieve the loss by extraordinary exertions. _Work,\r\n     work, work_, is my duty and destiny; your welfare the goal\r\n     that beckons me on. I contemplate nothing else—I desire\r\n     nothing else. I have been unanimously elected a member of\r\n     the Manhattan Club,—an association for the purpose of social\r\n     enjoyment,—but of course the expense is a formidable bar\r\n     to me. I sometimes attend as Mr. Schell's guest, and I am\r\n     received with great kindness.\r\n\r\n     \"I have met Miss Augusta Evans, the authoress, and I am\r\n     impressed with the goodness of her heart and her devotion to\r\n     learning. Her appearance is extremely pleasing—brown hair, the\r\n     color of yours—fair complexion—blue eyes (I think), a fine\r\n     brow and well-developed head, a figure slight and graceful,\r\n     and of your height. The expression of her countenance is\r\n     serious, almost sad, though it lights up with the animation\r\n     of talk. She is good, modest, sincere, pious. Her devotion to\r\n     the 'lost cause' is fanatical. I think her mind is irregularly\r\n     developed, but she has infinite ambition and will improve.\r\n\r\n     \"I have also had the great pleasure of seeing Ristori and\r\n     of being presented to her behind the scenes. Her acting is a\r\n     revelation. I could not understand one word of her language,\r\n     but her voice, her exquisite articulation, her expressive\r\n     countenance and gestures, told the story eloquently to my\r\n     uninstructed eyes and ears. How I longed for you! All pleasure\r\n     must be, in your absence, poisoned for me.\r\n\r\n     \"I have agreed to accept the defence of an unhappy Episcopal\r\n     minister who was arrested in an omnibus for picking a lady's\r\n     pocket! He was about to leave the stage when a voice arrested\r\n     him: 'Stop that man! He has stolen my pocket-book.' The\r\n     pocket-book was found upon him. It is by no means impossible\r\n     that the thief may have dropped it in my client's pocket. So\r\n     although he is miserably poor and can pay me nothing for my\r\n     trouble, my sympathies are enlisted, and I shall do my best\r\n     for him. Think of it! An Episcopal minister!\"\r\n\r\nLater:—\r\n\r\n     \"My wretched client is bailed at last. I am more and more\r\n     persuaded of his innocence, but whether I can make it\r\n     appear in the trial is another thing. The evidence is almost\r\n     conclusive against him. The case is so bad I can hardly expect\r\n     the judge to discharge him. I can acquit him, however, before\r\n     a jury.\"\r\n\r\nTwo months later he wrote:—\r\n\r\n     \"I have refused to be further connected in the case of the\r\n     Episcopal minister, for reasons which it is not proper I\r\n     should disclose even to you. He is now committed to the\r\n     protecting care of a lawyer whose defence will be insanity!\r\n\r\n     \"Some of the papers made haste to announce that 'the Rebel\r\n     Pryor has been superseded in the criminal case of — by other\r\n     lawyers,' and it was suspected the publication had emanated\r\n     from the prisoner's friends to escape an imaginary prejudice\r\n     against a 'Rebel' advocate. The truth is, I learned facts\r\n     from my client which made me withdraw from the case—facts in\r\n     writing. I indignantly refused any further connection with —.\r\n     His friends wrote me imploring me to stand by him, and it is\r\n     suspected that when they found me obstinate, _they_ instigated\r\n     the newspaper assertion! If so, they have behaved with the\r\n     basest ingratitude, for but for me—services which nobody but\r\n     myself could have rendered—he would long ago have been in\r\n     State's Prison. I voluntarily, and against their remonstrance,\r\n     renounced his case—and for other reasons than an absence of\r\n     reward. What my reasons are neither you nor any other person\r\n     shall ever know. They are in writing, however, and in my\r\n     possession. Of course they know I will be silent unless I am\r\n     forced to act otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of this unhappy clergyman is withheld lest the innocent may\r\nsuffer. He was accused of being an accomplished thief, and of concealing\r\nin his left hand a small pair of scissors, which he manipulated with\r\nsuch skill that he cut into the pockets (then worn in the ample skirts\r\nof women's dresses) and cleverly extracted purses and wallets. His\r\ncase was postponed from month to month—and finally he was allowed to\r\nleave the city for his home at the South, where he soon after died—the\r\npresumption being, I imagine, that he was insane.\r\n\r\nThe close of the year 1866 brought no new hopes for the sorely\r\ndistressed little family in Petersburg. By the closest economy, the most\r\ndiligent work,—teaching by day, and sewing at night,—the wolf was kept\r\nfrom the door, and the school bills of the boys paid. Small sums came\r\noccasionally from the heartsick worker in New York,—heart-sick because\r\nof his own impaired strength and health and the loss of many days from\r\npain and illness, and also his keen anxieties about the future of his\r\nnative state.\r\n\r\nBut at Christmas we were all refreshed by a visit from him, and improved\r\nthe hour by entreating that he should abandon the plan of living in New\r\nYork. We were most averse to it. There was small hope of our ever being\r\nable to exist in that city of costly living and high house-rents. My\r\nhusband forbore to grieve me, at this sacred time, by opposing me. After\r\nhe returned to New York, he wrote me:—\r\n\r\n                                          \"NEW YORK, Jan. 23d, 1867.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAREST,\r\n\r\n     \"I am sending you $200, with one hundred and ninety-seven\r\n     of which you must take up a note due Ashwell, the Northern\r\n     sutler. This is what remains of money due him to redeem the\r\n     silver tray from which you parted to purchase shoes for the\r\n     prisoners. Get a receipt in full from him, get the tray, and\r\n     restore it to its place in the service. To raise this amount\r\n     I am sorely pressed. We have had a terribly dull season. I am\r\n     comforted by the good reports of the children. Tell them that\r\n     I rejoice to hear of the good progress in their studies, and\r\n     am particularly delighted with Theo's 'perfect' circular. My\r\n     heart's desire is that the children be perfect in all things.\r\n     Pray write often about them. Gordon writes charmingly, but\r\n     her letters cannot be substituted for yours. Indeed I love you\r\n     all more and more every day of my life, and I would sacrifice\r\n     everything to be with you. Next spring you _must_ join me. Do\r\n     let us make the experiment. By hard work and strict economy we\r\n     may contrive to tide over our difficulties. We must remember\r\n     that we are poor, and must act accordingly. We must be content\r\n     to live humbly. _Anything_ is more tolerable than the life we\r\n     now live. Business of every kind is extremely dull here, but I\r\n     get some practice. I argued on a 'Demurrer' the other day and\r\n     was greatly complimented—the Chief Justice again remarking;\r\n     'it is refreshing to hear a good argument by a good lawyer.'\r\n\r\n                                               \"Devotedly, R. A. P.\"\r\n\r\n                                                   \"March 5th, 1867.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAREST,—To-morrow I will send you a certified cheque for\r\n     $50. Would it were more! For a month I have been extremely\r\n     pressed for money, but I still hope for easier times. My\r\n     income is very precarious. Don't imagine I have the least idea\r\n     of abandoning my experiment here. 'I mean to fight it out on\r\n     this line' to the end of the struggle. My practice increases\r\n     slowly but surely, and is based, I believe, on a conviction\r\n     of my competency. Thank God what I have accomplished, though\r\n     small, has been achieved by my own unaided exertions, and\r\n     without the least obligation to a human being. I have no\r\n     patron. I have never solicited business. My only arts are,\r\n     work and devotion to study. These expedients may be slow of\r\n     operation, but they are sure, and they leave my dignity and\r\n     self-respect uncompromised. I am not conscious of having\r\n     received a favor since my residence in New York—and when the\r\n     victory is achieved, I shall feel inexpressible gratification\r\n     in saying, with Coriolanus, '_Alone_ I did it!' When I speak\r\n     of 'favor' I mean in the way of my profession. Of personal\r\n     kindness I have been the grateful recipient—though not in many\r\n     instances. Judge — was perpetually obtruding his promises\r\n     upon me until at last I told him I needed no help and would\r\n     accept no succor. Of course he is offended. Let him be! All\r\n     his professions of regard are developed to be an interested\r\n     scheme to press me into his service.\r\n\r\n     \"And now one more word. You must come to me. I cannot live\r\n     without you. Is not poverty better than such an existence?\r\n     May we not live here humbly, but content in one another's\r\n     presence? I do not see that it is possible for me to get\r\n     employment in Virginia. Let us abate something of our pride\r\n     and ambition, and be content to live poorly and obscurely. We\r\n     can at least be sustained by our mutual love and admiration.\r\n     What care we for the world?\r\n\r\n                                               \"Devotedly, R. A. P.\"\r\n\r\nA very dull season succeeded these brave words. My poor general suffered\r\ngreatly from neuralgic pains in his head; no new cases came into his\r\noffice. He writes:—\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot account for it! Everything looks so much less\r\n     promising—but really now I _must_ remain here. I have no money\r\n     to get away! Never before have I been so sick at heart. I\r\n     often fear I can bear no more. I would come to you—supremely\r\n     wretched as I am—but for the fact that I am without money\r\n     to pay my expenses. In truth I haven't a cent in the world!\r\n     Yesterday I had one dollar, but meeting a poor little boy\r\n     about Willy's size with an arm just broken, I gave him the\r\n     last of my fortune. Why my landlord trusts me, I know not. But\r\n     he seems to have faith in me, and is willing to wait until I\r\n     earn something.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was soon followed by another,—indeed he wrote me every\r\nday,—and he hastened to say:—\r\n\r\n     \"I felt ashamed of my last letter, but the truth is my\r\n     'business' is oppressively stagnant—from what particular\r\n     cause, I cannot conjecture. Whether it be the result of\r\n     accident, or of causes which portend an ultimate failure, I\r\n     cannot pretend to affirm. If a breeze does not come soon, I\r\n     shall be at a standstill. What then? My family is dependent\r\n     exclusively upon my scant earnings. If they fail, I see no\r\n     hope in another quarter. This is the apprehension that kills\r\n     the soul within me. The catastrophe haunts me like a spectre,\r\n     and clouds my spirit with a perpetual gloom. God only knows\r\n     what the event will be—but I should not talk in this strain.\r\n     I shall relax no effort. On the contrary, I never worked as\r\n     strenuously in my life. God willing, my earnest efforts to\r\n     subsist my darling family may yet be successful. It is for\r\n     them I toil, and richly do they deserve every blessing. This\r\n     thought, above all else, encourages me. May God bless them!\r\n\r\n                                                \"Devotedly, R. A. P.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S. I see I repeated the sin for which I sought excuses.\r\n     The present lull in my practice I attribute to the general\r\n     stagnation of business. Mayhap the breeze will come before\r\n     long.\r\n\r\n     \"An unwelcome breeze of another kind is now busy near me.\r\n     An immense fire is raging in rather close proximity to the\r\n     'Waverly,' and I have some apprehensions of a move. The Winter\r\n     Garden Theatre and the Southern Hotel are in flames. How the\r\n     boys would enjoy the spectacle! I suppose there are fifty\r\n     steam-engines spouting their streams and thousands of people\r\n     looking on. To-day, for the first time, we have an indication\r\n     of approaching spring, and as they are painting my office, I\r\n     mean to stroll about the city in enjoyment of the sunshine.\"\r\n\r\nHe had now lived in New York a year and a half—and had borne the\r\nintense heat of summer in the crowded district. Except for one visit to\r\nVirginia, and an occasional Sunday to Fordham to visit his old comrade\r\nin Congress, Mr. Haskins, he had not left his narrow quarters for any\r\nrecreation whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April my husband exultantly announced that he had \"eight little\r\ncases\" on the calendar; on May 14 he wrote:—\r\n\r\n     \"I am over head and ears with work, preparing Mrs. —'s case\r\n     for trial. It is infinitely troublesome; _but_ if I win, my\r\n     fee will be $2000—otherwise nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe did win! In July he received his fee! Within two weeks I had wound\r\nup all my small affairs in Petersburg, kissed \"good-by\" to my tearful\r\nlittle band of music scholars, sent my Aunt Mary with my Gordon and\r\nlittle Mary to \"The Oaks\" in Charlotte County to spend the rest of\r\nthe summer, persuaded my sable laundress, Hannah, that New York was\r\nan earthly paradise, and taken passage thither with her and five of my\r\nlittle brood.\r\n\r\nA hot morning in July found us at City Point before sunrise, waiting for\r\nthe _Saratoga_, one of a bi-weekly line of two steam-boats, now coming\r\nfrom Richmond on its way to New York. The _Saratoga_ and her consort,\r\nthe _Niagara_, had the right of way at that time with no competitors,\r\nand could take their own time without let or hindrance. They travelled\r\nthe path now traversed by the many fine ships of the Old Dominion Line,\r\nand travelled it alone except for an occasional Clyde boat or two.\r\n\r\nAs we waited, our noisy little engine puffed away impatiently. The\r\nconductor hoped for a possible passenger for his return trip to\r\nPetersburg, and had arrived at the terminus of his short road too soon.\r\n\r\nCity Point—lately a place of strategic importance, where the great\r\nships of the Federal army had anchored, where Mr. Lincoln had been\r\nentertained by General Grant, where General Butler had long made his\r\nheadquarters—was now silent and deserted. Two years before the last\r\nof General Butler's gunboats had steamed away. Not a shade tree, not\r\na \"shanty,\" remained to mark the occupation of the Federal troops. An\r\nunsheltered platform afforded the only place for a traveller to rest\r\nwhile waiting for the boat, unless he could content himself with the\r\ndust-covered seats in the forlorn little car and the limited view from\r\nthe narrow, dirty car window. Out on the platform, seated on his own\r\nboxes, the traveller could see the sweep of the noble James River,\r\nbroadened here into a sea as it took into its bosom the muddy waters of\r\nthe Appomattox. Landward there was little to be seen except an unbroken\r\nwaste of dusty road and untilled field.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance a thin line of smoke indicated a small log cabin\r\nand the presence of inhabitants. Outside the hut there was a \"patch\"\r\nof corn and cabbages, and a watermelon vine sprawled about, searching\r\nfor the sweet waters wherewithal to fill the plump green melons it had\r\nbrought forth. A suspicious hen was leading her brood as far from the\r\nengine as possible, and a pig in an odoriferous pen was leaping on the\r\nsides of his stye and clamoring for his breakfast. Presently a languid\r\nnegro woman emerged from the cabin, and stooping over the cabbages,\r\nselected a large leaf, which she proceeded to bind with a strip of\r\ncloth around her forehead. She sauntered toward us and remarked that\r\nit was \"gwine to be a mighty hot day.\" She had risen early, she said,\r\nto see the boat pass. Her son Jim was kitchen boy on the _Saratoga_,\r\nand not allowed to leave the boat, but she could see him and \"tell\r\n'im howdy.\" She \"cert'nly thought Sis Hannah lucky to git to go Nawth\"\r\n(Hannah was rather rueful and teary, having just parted from a Jim of\r\nher own). \"She would cert'nly go Nawth\" herself if she wasn't \"'bleeged\r\nto stay at the Pint on account of the pig an' chickens an' things.\" She\r\nwas like the two old maids in Dickens's funny story, who lived in the\r\ngreatest discomfort in a crowded quarter on the Thames, but could not\r\neven consider the possibility of moving—which they could well afford to\r\ndo—because of the trouble of moving \"the library,\" a small collection\r\nof books which any able-bodied market-woman could easily have carried\r\nin her basket.\r\n\r\nMy own movables were really of less importance than those of my new\r\nacquaintance. Hers represented the entire furnishing of a home—a home\r\nsufficient for her needs. Mine were the melancholy wreckage of a home\r\nwhich had been enriched with such treasures as are collected in a\r\nprosperous and happy life: only what had been saved by a good neighbor\r\nand a faithful servant from the sacking of our house at Cottage Farm—a\r\nfew damaged books, a box of sacred silver, and one trunk, which sufficed\r\nfor my own garments and for the slender wardrobes of my children. I was\r\non my way to keep house in New York with a service of silver and a few\r\nrain-and-mud-stained books which had been picked up on the farm by our\r\ngood John.\r\n\r\nMy heart was heavier than my boxes, as I waited for the boat. All the\r\nsad foreboding letters my general had written me rose up to fill me with\r\ndoubt and alarm. He had rented a furnished house and had paid the first\r\nquarter of the $1800 it was to cost us. That sum seemed to me simply\r\nenormous, but he had spent weeks in hunting throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of New York for the humble little home of his imagination. This\r\nhouse was far out on an avenue in Brooklyn. I was afraid of it! I was\r\napprehensive that a very large hole indeed had been made in the $2000.\r\nMoreover, my heart was sick in leaving Virginia—dear old Virginia, for\r\nwhich I cherished the inordinate affection so sternly forbidden by the\r\nApostle. Six years of sorrow and disaster had borne fruit. \"Truly,\" I\r\nthought:—\r\n\r\n     \"All backward as I cast my e'e\r\n           Seems dark and drear:\r\n     And forward though I canna' see\r\n           I doubt and fear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then I had just parted with my dear aunt and my scarcely dearer\r\ndaughters, with old friends and neighbors, with affectionate servants.\r\nAnd I was _tired_—tired unto death!\r\n\r\nBut the boat, churning with its great paddle-wheels the muddy waters\r\nof the James, was approaching, the captain and an early riser or\r\ntwo leaning over the deck railing. My little boys ran gayly over\r\nthe gang-plank as soon as it was lowered. Hannah clung tearfully to\r\nher acquaintance of an hour. The gang-plank was hauled in, the great\r\npaddle-wheels turned, and we were off, on our way to our new home.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Dixie,\" called out my boys.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet, young gentlemen,\" said the captain; \"we are still in Dixie\r\nwaters, and will be until we reach the sea.\"\r\n\r\nAs we sat on deck, steaming down the river, the passengers eagerly\r\nscanned the shores and recounted the events of the late war. The last\r\ntime I had sailed down this river each point was interesting from\r\nColonial and Revolutionary associations. Now all these were forgotten in\r\nits later history. Every spot was marked as the scene of some triumph\r\nor occupation of the Northern army—of some disaster or humiliation of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\nThere were few passengers—three charming young ladies with their mother,\r\nreturning home after a visit to the Cullen family of Richmond; a group\r\nof teachers going home to New England for their vacation; a comfortable\r\nnegro mammy with her basket, very proud to repeat again and again\r\nthat she was \"just from Mobile, Alabama,\" to whom Hannah looked up\r\nwith deference and respect; and half a dozen or more tourists from New\r\nYork returning from an inspection of the historic places in and around\r\nRichmond. Among these last was an old acquaintance, a Southern man, who\r\nat once sought conversation with me. He had lived in New York before\r\nand during the war. He could not conceal his amazement at the desperate\r\nventure my general was making. \"Of all places,\" he said, \"why, why are\r\nyou choosing a home in New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask the withered leaf,\" I answered, \"why it is driven by a winter wind\r\nto one place rather than another.\"\r\n\r\n\"But practically,\" he replied somewhat testily, \"as a matter of prudence\r\nand common sense—\"\r\n\r\n\"You think, then,\" I interrupted, \"there is small hope for my poor\r\ngeneral in New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"New York—\" he said slowly and with emphasis, \"New York, you will find,\r\nhas _no use for the unsuccessful man_.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an anxious thought for me to take to my state-room. Once there,\r\nand my restless young ones asleep, I realized the desperate venture\r\nwe were making. Nothing had ever been as I wished. With the war, its\r\ncauses, its ends and objects, I had nothing to do. My part was solely\r\nwith the poverty, the heartbreak, the losses, the exile from home.\r\n\r\nAn unbidden vision, many a time thrust from me, now arose, insistent.\r\nMy early home—all flowers and music and beauty, my opulent life; the\r\ndevotion of honored friends—_this_ was my heritage! Of this I had been\r\nunjustly defrauded. Ah, well! It was an old story—the story of another\r\nparadise, another yielding to sinful ambition, another sword, another\r\nparting with happiness and home to encounter difficulty, poverty,\r\ndanger! Then, \"The world was all before them where to choose a place of\r\nrest—and Providence their guide.\" Aye! _Providence their Guide!_ This,\r\nthis was the anchor of their hope, and must be mine.\r\n\r\nWe were awakened before dawn by a confusion on deck—the dragging of\r\nheavy ropes, hurried feet, loud shouts. Throwing on my wrapper, I\r\nascended, to find my little boys already on deck, eager for adventure.\r\nIt appeared we had met our consort, the _Niagara_, in a crippled\r\ncondition, had thrown her a cable, and were now \"put about\" to lead her\r\ninto port at Norfolk. The rising sun found us slowly returning with the\r\n_Niagara_ in tow; but a few miles from Norfolk she signified her ability\r\nto go on without us, and we resumed our onward journey to New York.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening all eyes were turned toward land—and presently\r\nthe sky-line of New York emerged from the mists. Very different was\r\nit from the sky-line of to-day. Then we saw only the uneven line of\r\nmoderate dwellings of unequal height, broken here and there by the\r\nupward-pointing fingers of the churches. There was no \"Brooklyn Bridge\"\r\nspanning the East River, no Babel-like towers of the modern sky-scraper,\r\nno great statue—like a bronze figure on a newel-post—of Liberty with her\r\ntorch and coronal of stars. (I never did admire Miss Liberty. I always\r\nsympathized with the afflicted sculptor who exclaimed, as his vision\r\nwas smitten by the giantess, \"If this be Liberty, give me Death.\")\r\n\r\nWe were, after much delay, \"warped\" into our own berth, and the\r\n\"dear old muggy atmosphere\" of New York stormed my unwilling senses:\r\natmosphere thickened and flavored, after a sweltering summer day,\r\nwith coal smoke, street-filth, and refuse of decaying fruit and many\r\ncabbages.\r\n\r\nBut all things were forgotten when we descried the slight figure of my\r\ngeneral on the pier! Very thin and wan did he look, sadly in need of us.\r\nHe took us, a party of eight, to a neighboring restaurant for dinner;\r\nand then we crossed the ferry and in the horse-cars, through miles and\r\nmiles of lighted streets, we reached our little home, far away on the\r\nouter edge of Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nThe morning after our arrival we rose early to look about us. We were\r\nin an unsubstantial new house, narrow as a ladder and filled with\r\nunattractive furniture. Hannah agreed to take care of the children, and\r\nI set forth to find a market. After walking several blocks in different\r\ndirections I concluded there was no market within reach, and I began to\r\ndoubt my ability to provide a dinner. A fat, stolid-looking policeman\r\nstrolled near me as I ventured:—\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me, Mr. Officer, where I can find an honest butcher?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be hanged if I know one,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nI considered. We had brought biscuit and crackers. I must find some milk.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me, then, where I can get pure milk?\"\r\n\r\nMy policeman whistled! I don't know what there was in my appearance that\r\ntempted him to \"guy\" me, but with a droll twinkle in his eye he said:—\r\n\r\n\"Now look 'ere, lady! If you was to go on a little further, you'd get\r\nto Flatbush; and then you'd see the mizzable critters standing up to\r\ntheir knees in stagnant water, with their hoofs rotting off. Sure and\r\nyou wouldn't want any of their milk!\"\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was sparsely settled; a number of vacant lots\r\nsurrounded our house, which was one of a row all alike. I reflected\r\nthat the people living in those houses must occasionally eat! And so\r\nI walked on and on until I reached a cross street on which cars were\r\nrunning. There I found a stand of cakes and apples, before which a woman\r\nsat knitting. \"My good woman,\" I said amiably, \"are your cakes _plain?_\"\r\n\r\nShe dropped her work and glared at me. \"_Clane_, is it! You think I\r\nput dirt in 'em?\" Her manner was so threatening that I turned and fled.\r\nHer voice pursued me—\"An' the blarney of her;\" (mimicking), \"'Me good\r\nooman'! 'Me good ooman,' indade!—the loikes of her!\"\r\n\r\nWhat my mistake had been I could not then imagine. I now know that I\r\nhad, unconsciously, a manner unwarranted by my appearance. Turning up\r\na new thoroughfare, I encountered a grocery store, with vegetables and\r\nfruit at the door. There I learned with terror the cost of provisions in\r\nthis part of the world. At home I could buy a chicken for 25 cents—here\r\nI must give 30 cents for a pound of him! Whortleberries (the grocer\r\ncalled them \"blueberries\") could be bought at home for a few pennies\r\na quart. Here 20 cents was demanded for a shallow box of withered\r\nspecimens. Fifty cents in Petersburg would buy a large beefsteak. I\r\npurchased an infant steak for $1.50, and with this I turned my steps\r\nhomeward.\r\n\r\nA small shanty, a squatter's hut, was in the corner of the vacant lot\r\nbehind our house. Two or three children were playing in the dirt at the\r\ndoor, and a goat eating paper beside them. Ah! there was a cow tethered\r\nto a tree not far away!\r\n\r\nA kindly-faced Irish woman answered my knock. I frankly told her my\r\ndilemma and she sympathized at once. Her name was Mrs. Foley, and she\r\nwould milk her cow in my sight morning and evening, just behind my\r\nhouse, so I could be sure of the purity of the milk. \"An' sure in a wake\r\nye'll see the darlint fatten,\" she assured me. And a great comfort was\r\nold Mrs. Foley all the time I lived near her.\r\n\r\nI must confess the days passed wearily enough through July and into\r\nAugust. The heat was extreme and of a depressing quality. We were so\r\nfar away from my general's office that his long journey morning and\r\nevening, accompanied by Theo, was exhausting to both of them. I taught\r\nMary and Roger, but the children were very listless and unhappy. They\r\nfound no pleasure in walking up and down the uninteresting sidewalk of\r\na hot, dreary street. Loneliness, enhanced by the far-off hum of the\r\ncity, the mournful fog-horns and whistles on the river, and the not less\r\ndepressing sounds from the incessant pianos around us, oppressed us all.\r\nWe seemed to find nothing to take hold of, nothing to live for.\r\n\r\nI one day found Hannah raining tears into her tubs as she washed our\r\nlinen, and having no mind to have my handkerchiefs anointed with other\r\ntears than my own, I essayed to comfort her. Finally she confessed she\r\nhad never seen New York. She didn't know if it was \"_thar_\"—for she'd\r\n\"never seen sight of it.\" Moreover, Jim was writing to ask her what she\r\nthought of Central Park and she \"cert'nly was 'shamed to tell Jim she\r\nhad heerd tell of it but never set foot in it.\"\r\n\r\nI had an inspiration. \"Hannah,\" I said, \"we have a steak for dinner.\r\nYou can broil a steak and boil some potatoes and rice in a few minutes.\r\nCome, leave the tubs, run up and dress, and help me with the children.\r\nWe will all go to Central Park, spend a pleasant afternoon, and get back\r\nin time for dinner.\"\r\n\r\nWe were a large party, and could not get off, having taken a hasty\r\nluncheon, until nearly two o'clock. But the summer afternoons were long\r\nand we had no misgivings. I had no idea of the distance, nor did I know\r\nof any route to the Park, save the horse-car and ferry on our side, a\r\nwalk up Wall Street to Broadway, and the lumbering Broadway omnibus with\r\ntwo horses for the rest of the way. At four o'clock we arrived in sight\r\nof Central Park! A black thunder-cloud came up, and we alighted from\r\nour stage in a drenching rain. Of course we must return without seeing\r\nthe Park, but to our joy we found a line of horse-cars waiting at the\r\ngate for return passengers, and dripping wet, we took shelter in one of\r\nthese and were soon on our way homeward. At the end of our journey there\r\nwas Theo, with umbrellas—now useless, for more thoroughly drenched we\r\ncould not well have been,—and his father!—Well, his father was almost in\r\na state of nervous prostration! Hannah's spirits thereafter were worse\r\nthan ever. She lost all interest in work, and spent much of her time\r\nleaning over her area gate and gazing into the street. Once I asked her\r\nwhat she was looking at.\r\n\r\n\"Dat po-white-folks creeter hollerin' 'soap fat,'\" she answered. \"Lawd!\r\nI wonder if dat ole creeter got wife!\"\r\n\r\nWe were both mystified by the street cries. One man we found was _not_\r\ncrying: \"Frank Potter,\" \"Frank Potter,\" but \"rags, bottles.\" But another\r\ncry, \"Pi-_ap_,—Pi-_ap_,\" much perplexed us. Finally Hannah brought\r\nin a very hard, knotty, green apple, the \"pi-ap\" man had given her\r\nas a sample of his wares. \"Dar is his 'pi-aps,'\" she explained. Light\r\nbroke upon my benighted intelligence. \"Why, Hannah,\" I said, \"he means\r\npie-apples!\" \"Good Gawd A'mighty!\" she exclaimed. \"Is _dat_ de bes' dey\r\ncan do!\"\r\n\r\nIn August she entreated to be sent home. In vain I too entreated. I felt\r\nthat this was the last straw! What could I do in this strange city with\r\nno faithful person to leave occasionally with the children? I offered\r\nanything—everything—larger liberty, more wages.\r\n\r\nHannah said solemnly, \"You knows I likes you and de chillern—but I can't\r\nstay. I'se _feared_ to stay! I can't live in no place where folks plays\r\nde piano all day Sunday. I'se boun' to git out. Somp'n gwine to happen\r\nin dis Gawd-forsaken place.\" Then after a thoughtful pause she added\r\npensively: \"_De watermillions is ripe at home!_ I done wrote to Jim to\r\ngit me one—a big one—and put it in a tub o' cole water erginst I come.\"\r\n\r\nWith Hannah I lost the last link that bound me to the old Virginia of\r\nmy childhood, my last acquaintance with the kindly old-time negro and\r\nthe dialect so expressive, so characteristic.\r\n\r\nI filled her place with an Irish woman who served me faithfully for many\r\nyears, and was wont to commiserate me for all I had suffered \"with that\r\nnayger in the house.\" Her scorn of the negro knew no bounds. She never\r\nknew how deeply I mourned my loss.\r\n\r\nThe pain of parting from friends, the doubt of the future, the dreams of\r\nmy early home, filled my heart with anguish; but I had but one consuming\r\ndesire—to sustain and strengthen the dear one who had fought so many\r\nbattles, and was now confronted with the stern struggle for existence.\r\nTo be cheerful for his sake, to press strong hands over my own breaking\r\nheart—this was the task I set for myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember found us at the end of a long, dull season. No business had\r\ncome into the little law-office—the centre of all our hopes. We had\r\nmade no friends among our neighbors, to whom, of course, we had made\r\nno advances. The silence was broken, however, one evening by a visit\r\nfrom a well-groomed, handsome young fellow, who, with many apologies,\r\nrequested an interview with General Pryor.\r\n\r\n\"So the reporters have found us out,\" said my general, but he was\r\nmistaken. His visitor had \"ventured to call for advice—not legal advice\r\nexactly\"—but he wished to know the General's opinion upon a matter of\r\ninfinite importance to himself and to his wife. \"Doubtless we had heard\r\nhis wife singing,\"—we had—\"she was a fine musician, but one could not\r\nlive on music.\"\r\n\r\nTo this my husband readily assented. He had a deeply rooted aversion to\r\nthe piano, which he believed to have been an invention of the Evil One\r\nin a moment of unusual malignity.\r\n\r\n\"The question I wish to ask, General,\" said the young fellow, \"is this,\r\nWould you advise me to go into politics, law, or the coffee business?\"\r\n\r\n\"The coffee business, most decidedly,\" said my husband; \"I have tried\r\nthe other two and have a poor opinion of both of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe interviewer left, perfectly satisfied to enter the coffee business.\r\nThrough the open window we could hear the words of a song from the \"fine\r\nmusician\"—presenting, as it were, a solution of the problem:—\r\n\r\n     \"It is time for the mower to whet his scythe\r\n     For 'tis five o'clock in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nWe never learned to what extent politics and the profession of the law\r\nhad suffered, nor how much the coffee business had gained. One thing\r\nwas certain: the suggestion of the fair singer, so freely given to\r\nthe breeze, was not needed by me; for my scythe was always in active\r\noperation before five o'clock in the morning. When \"the sun came\r\npeeping in at morn,\" he always found me up and dressed and ready for\r\nhis greeting.\r\n\r\nThen—as for many times before and after—our case seemed too desperate\r\nfor rest. Often after our slender breakfast not an atom of food was left\r\nin the larder. A mouse would in vain have sought our hospitality. The\r\ncorner grocer had once trusted us for provisions as far as twenty-five\r\ndollars' worth, but had taken his seat in the front hall and there\r\nremained until he was paid! The bitter experience was never repeated.\r\nBut as surely as the ravens were sent to feed Elijah did the Power\r\nthat esteems us of more worth than many sparrows—many ravens—send\r\nus something every day; some small fee for a legal service or for an\r\narticle written for the _News_. My general would bring this treasure\r\nhome, Anne would be sent on a flying errand for \"a bit of a shteak\"—and\r\nMr. Micawber never gathered around his suddenly acquired chops a more\r\nhopeful brood than our own.\r\n\r\nOnce Mr. John R. Thompson, editor of the _Literary Messenger_ and\r\nlater of the _New York Evening Post_, fresh from England, where he had\r\nhobnobbed with Carlyle, Tennyson, and Dickens, came to dinner. I had\r\nlittle to offer him except a biscuit and a glass of ale. He did not\r\nmind. He had known Edgar Allan Poe, and many another poverty-stricken\r\ngenius who had enriched the pages of the _Literary Messenger_ for\r\nsums too pitiful to mention. The straits of scholarly men were\r\nfamiliar to him and detracted nothing from his interest in the men\r\nthemselves. To be sure they were more interesting if they walked the\r\nmidnight streets in default of other shelter than the stars (and there\r\nmight be worse) like Johnson or Savage or Goldsmith or others of the\r\nGrub-street fraternity;—still, the victims of a revolution were quite\r\nmiserable enough to satisfy the imagination. Misery is, after all, more\r\npicturesque than happiness and ease.\r\n\r\nJohn Mitchell, the Irish patriot, was another visitor,—railing against\r\nthe English government and declaring he would yet live to \"strike the\r\ncrutches from the old hag, on the British throne\"; talk to which no\r\nstretch of politeness could induce me to listen. I had been taught to\r\nlove the good, young queen, of whom the English philanthropist, Joseph\r\nJohn Gurney, had told me when I, a child of eight years, had sat upon\r\nhis knee in my uncle's house in Virginia.\r\n\r\nAn agreeable old German gentleman, whom we had known in Washington, also\r\ncame from New York to see us. \"Oh, Pryor, Pryor,\" he exclaimed, \"_how_\r\ncould you bring Madam to this mel-_an'_-choly place?\"\r\n\r\nThe place would have been paradise to us if only God would give us bread\r\nfor our children. We had come to fear we would never have more—perhaps\r\nnot this. The society—exclusively of \"Adullamites\" like ourselves—was\r\nnot conducive to hope and cheerfulness. Very few Southerners were at\r\nthat time in New York. We were pioneers. Truly they were all—like the\r\nfollowers of David—\"in distress, in debt, and discontented.\"\r\n\r\nJust at this anxious time I received a letter from my dear Aunt Mary.\r\nShe felt that she was incurably ill. While she had strength, she would\r\ncome, place Gordon safely in her father's house, and then die in my\r\narms! In a few days she would arrive in New York and I must meet her at\r\nthe boat with provision for having her borne to a carriage.\r\n\r\nThis was overwhelming news. How could I provide comforts for my more\r\nthan mother? There was but one thing left us. We must pledge our service\r\nof silver—a testimonial service with a noble inscription, presented, we\r\nremember, to my general by the Democratic party of Virginia after he had\r\nfought a good fight against the peril threatened by the \"Know Nothing\"\r\nparty. This silver was very precious. Sell it we could not, but perhaps\r\nwe could borrow a few hundred dollars, giving it as security.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a pawn-broker never occurred to us. It seems to me now that\r\nI had then never heard of a pawn-broker!\r\n\r\nBut not a great many years before this, as we remember, when I was\r\nfifteen years old, this dear aunt who had reared me had suddenly\r\ndiscovered that the child was a woman. She must see the world. She\r\nmust travel to Niagara Falls, visit all the great cities and see their\r\nmuseums, libraries, theatres, what not; she must have hats from Mme.\r\nViglini in New York, gowns from Mrs. McComas in Baltimore,—and jewels\r\nfrom Tiffany's. From the latter my adoptive father had bought me lovely\r\nturquoise, rubies, white topaz necklaces, and jewelled combs. Surely,\r\nI now thought, this will be the place where I may be remembered and\r\nfind some kindness. Accordingly I repaired thither and made my plea. I\r\nwas told, of course, that the firm must see the silver. Naturally none\r\nof the gentlemen who talked with me could remember ever having heard\r\nof me before. I must send the silver and then return for my answer.\r\nAccordingly I boxed it, sent it, and on the third day presented myself—a\r\nvery wistful figure—at the silver counter. A tall young man, whose name\r\nI learned afterwards, said to me with some hauteur, \"Madam, we have\r\nweighed your silver, and will allow you $540 for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will redeem it soon, I hope,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Redeem it! Madam, this is not a pawnshop! We _buy_ silver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then will I not get it back again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not!\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated. My need was sore—but oh, to part forever with this sacred\r\ninheritance for my children!\r\n\r\n\"You had as well realize,\" said my tall young man,—and he looked to\r\nme colossal,—\"that you will never have occasion to use silver again.\r\nYou had as well let it go to the crucible first as last. You will, of\r\ncourse, be obliged to live humbly hereafter, and—\"\r\n\r\nBut I had risen in great wrath against him. Flushed and indignant I\r\nretorted, \"You mistake, sir! I shall use my silver again! I shall not\r\nlive humbly always,\" and left the store.\r\n\r\nBut once again on the sidewalk with the sharp November wind blowing\r\nin my face I remembered my dear invalid. I remembered my cold house,\r\nin which there had been provided no furnace, no stove, nothing but\r\nopen grates for heating. I knew then as well as I know now that the\r\nfirm was in no wise responsible for the discourteous language of its\r\nrepresentative. I had only happened to encounter a fanatic, a hater of\r\nthe South,—and it was not the first time. Possibly should I return and\r\nseek another one of the corps of clerks I might fare better. But no! I\r\nwould perish first.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment I recollected that my dear old chaplain-father had\r\nsaid, in bidding me good-by, \"If you ever need a friend, you may advise\r\nwith _my_ friend in New York—Henry Corning.\"\r\n\r\nThis sent me to a directory in a near-by drug store, where I found\r\n\"Corning\" and an address to a bank on Broadway. I repaired thither,\r\nand was directed to a private room, where a venerable gentleman rose\r\nto greet me and offer me a seat. I was very tired and miserable, but I\r\ntold my errand as best I could.\r\n\r\n\"I have not the pleasure of knowing your father,\" said the gentleman,\r\nlooking at me kindly through his spectacles (and down went the mercury\r\nof all my courage), \"but,\" he added, \"I think my nephew, Henry Corning,\r\nis your man. I have heard him speak of the Rev. Dr. Pryor. I will give\r\nyou his address. _My_ name is Jasper Corning.\"\r\n\r\nI am sure there were tears in my eyes when he looked up, as he handed\r\nme a slip of paper, for he added kindly: \"I feel certain Henry will not\r\nfail you. Don't despair! God is good.\"\r\n\r\nAnother omnibus ride brought my heavy heart to the door of Mr. Henry\r\nCorning, in Madison Avenue. He was sitting at his desk on the ground\r\nfloor—and without one word of response to my simply told story turned\r\nto his desk and wrote his check for $500!\r\n\r\n\"I will send you the silver immediately,\" I said—but he only bowed, and\r\nwith \"My regards to your father,\" he allowed me to take leave.\r\n\r\nI called at Tiffany's on my return, gave an order at the desk, paid the\r\ncartage, and ordered the silver to be addressed to Mr. Corning.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, a year afterwards, for me to redeem it, I saw Mr.\r\nCorning again, thanked him for his kindness, and said, \"I am now ready\r\nto redeem the silver.\" He looked at me with a twinkle in his eye and\r\nasked, \"What silver?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" I exclaimed in great alarm, \"surely you received it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well,\" he replied, \"if you say so, I suppose it is all right. I\r\nhave never seen your silver. There's a box there in the corner. The box\r\nhas not been opened since you sent it.\"\r\n\r\nMy dear aunt had her wish. She died in my house. She was ill a long\r\ntime. Through the kindness of a Southern friend I was introduced to Dr.\r\nRosman, who attended her with devotion and skill. He was the gentlest\r\nand kindest of physicians. He admired and appreciated her, and truly\r\nshe was a _grande dame_ in every respect; courteous, dignified, and\r\nbeautiful, even at sixty years of age.\r\n\r\n     \"When faith and Hope, which parting from her never\r\n     Had ripened her just soul to dwell with God,\r\n     Her alms and deeds and all her great endeavor\r\n     Were never lost, nor in the grave were trod.\"\r\n\r\nShe lives, I humbly trust, in two children of her adoption, who owe to\r\nher all they are or ever hope to be.\r\n\r\nThe struggle, the wounds, the defeats we suffer at each other's hands\r\nmay all be classed under the head of battles,—battles where the ultimate\r\ndefeat or victory is in our own hands,—in the harm or good done to our\r\nsouls. The fight in the field ended, hostility, hatred, bitterness,\r\nshould also end; but, alas, the battles of prejudice, resentment for\r\nunforgiven injuries, may continue for years. Some of these my story\r\ncompels me to record, but as old Thomas Fuller quaintly says: \"These\r\nbattles are here inserted, not with any intent (God knows my heart) to\r\nperpetuate the odious remembrance of mutual wrongs, that heart-burnings\r\nmay remain when house-burnings have ceased, but only to raise our\r\ngratitude to God that so much strife should have raged in the bosom of\r\nso fair a land, and yet so few scars remain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these sad days and nights of heaviness hung over us, we were\r\npainfully conscious that some of our own people misunderstood my\r\nhusband's position in New York. Our having left Virginia was resented\r\nat the time, and now General Pryor's avowed belief that the salvation\r\nof the South could only be assured by acquiescence in the inevitable,\r\nand in the full exercise of justice to the negro, was most unacceptable.\r\nThis was before the right of suffrage had been conceded to the negro; in\r\nthe interval between the fall of the Confederacy and the Reconstruction\r\nperiod,—an interval during which the South was in a condition of\r\nresentment and agitation which portended a possible renewal of the\r\nconflict,—one of General Pryor's friends wrote him of the feeling\r\nagainst him and the cause.\r\n\r\nThe following answer to this letter was sent by my husband to the\r\n_Richmond Whig_, and puts him on record before the world at a time when\r\nsuch opinions were decidedly adverse to the feelings of many of his\r\nown personal friends. It required courage to write this letter. Since\r\nthat time the prophetic words have been fully justified by subsequent\r\nevents, and the unwelcome sentiments are to-day fully indorsed by the\r\nSouth. They are pregnant with wisdom, perhaps as much needed now as at\r\nthe time they were uttered.\r\n\r\n                                         \"NEW YORK, October 5, 1867.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR SIR: I was apprised before the receipt of your\r\n     letter that a certain paper of Virginia had stigmatized me\r\n     as a 'Radical' and had otherwise imputed to me sentiments\r\n     inimical to the interests of the South. But the silly story\r\n     I disdained to contradict, while it rested on the authority\r\n     of the irresponsible person who propagated it. Since you say\r\n     that my silence is construed into a sort of acquiescence in\r\n     the reproach, I empower you to repel the accusation with the\r\n     utmost energy of indignant denial. I have not the vanity to\r\n     imagine that my opinions are of the least consequence to any\r\n     one; but, because they have been brought into controversy,\r\n     and have been the occasion of subjecting me to some unmerited\r\n     animadversion, I will tell you very frankly and freely in what\r\n     relation I stand to the politics of the day.\r\n\r\n     \"In the first place, then, neither with politics nor parties\r\n     have I the least concern or connection. On the downfall of the\r\n     Confederacy I renounced forever every political aspiration,\r\n     and resolved henceforth to address myself to the care of my\r\n     family and the pursuit of my profession. But for all that I\r\n     have not repudiated the obligations of good citizenship. When\r\n     I renewed my oath of allegiance to the Union, I did so in good\r\n     faith and without reservation; and as I understand that oath,\r\n     it not only restrains me from acts of positive hostility to\r\n     the government, but pledges me to do my utmost for its welfare\r\n     and stability. Hence, while I am more immediately concerned to\r\n     see the South restored to its former prosperity, I am anxious\r\n     that the whole country, and all classes, may be reunited on\r\n     the basis of common interest and fraternal regard. And this\r\n     object, it appears to me, can only be attained by conceding\r\n     to all classes the unrestricted rights guaranteed them by\r\n     the laws and by obliterating as speedily and as entirely as\r\n     possible the distinctions which have separated the North and\r\n     the South into hostile sections.\r\n\r\n     \"With this conviction, while I pretend to no part in politics,\r\n     I have not hesitated, in private discourse, to advise my\r\n     friends in the South frankly to 'accept the situation';\r\n     to adjust their ideas to the altered state of affairs; to\r\n     recognize and respect the rights of the colored race; to\r\n     cultivate relations of confidence and good-will toward the\r\n     people of the North; to abstain from the profitless agitations\r\n     of political debate; and to employ their energies in the\r\n     far more exigent and useful work of material reparation and\r\n     development. Striving out of regard to the South to inculcate\r\n     that lesson of prudent conduct, I have urged such arguments\r\n     as these: That the negro is, in no sense, responsible for the\r\n     calamities we endure; that towards us he has ever conducted\r\n     himself with kindness and subordination; that he is entitled\r\n     to our compassion, and to the assistance of our superior\r\n     intelligence in the effort to attain a higher state of moral\r\n     and intellectual development; that to assume he was placed on\r\n     this theatre as a reproach to humanity and a stumbling-block\r\n     to the progress of civilization would be to impeach the wisdom\r\n     and goodness of Providence; that, considering the comparative\r\n     numbers of the two races in the South, it would be the merest\r\n     madness to provoke a collision of caste; in a word, that it\r\n     is absolutely essential to the peace, repose, and prosperity\r\n     of the South that the emancipated class should be undisturbed\r\n     in the enjoyment of their rights under the law, and should be\r\n     enlightened to understand the duties and interests of social\r\n     order and well-being. But it has appeared to me that the chief\r\n     obstacle to a complete and cordial reunion between the North\r\n     and the South is found in the suspicion and resentment with\r\n     which the people of these sections regard each other. Hence,\r\n     while on the one hand assuring the Northern people of the\r\n     good faith with which the South resumes its obligations in the\r\n     Union, I have thought it not amiss, on the other, to protest\r\n     to my Southern friends that the mass of the Northern community\r\n     are animated by far more just and liberal sentiments toward\r\n     us than we are apt to suspect.\r\n\r\n     \"And thus, leaving to others the ostensible part in the\r\n     work of reconstruction, and abstaining studiously from all\r\n     political connection and activity, I have hoped in some\r\n     measure, and in a quiet way, to repair the evil I contributed\r\n     to bring upon the South by availing myself of every\r\n     appropriate private opportunity to suggest these counsels of\r\n     moderation and magnanimity. Passion, to which in truth we had\r\n     abundant provocation, precipitated us into secession; reason\r\n     must conduct us back into the path of peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n     \"Hard it may be to purge our hearts of the resentments and\r\n     prejudices engendered by civil war; but until our minds be\r\n     enlightened by a philosophic comprehension of the exigencies\r\n     of our situation, we shall never recover the repose after\r\n     which the wearied spirit of the South so eagerly pants.\r\n\r\n     \"At whatever risk of personal obloquy, and at whatever\r\n     sacrifice of personal interest,—and you know it involves both\r\n     obloquy and sacrifice to talk as I do,—I am resolved to employ\r\n     all the energy and intellect I may command in the incessant\r\n     endeavor to promote peace and good-will among the people of\r\n     the lately belligerent states. What the country needs, what\r\n     in a most especial manner the South needs, is repose; freedom\r\n     from the throes of political agitation, and leisure to recruit\r\n     its exhausted energies. The experience of the past six years\r\n     should have impressed on the mind of the American nation\r\n     this most salutary lesson,—a lesson sooner or later learnt by\r\n     every nation in the development of its own history,—that civil\r\n     war is the sum and consummation of all human woe. Protesting\r\n     solemnly the integrity of motive by which I was then actuated,\r\n     yet I never recall the names of the noble men who fell in\r\n     our conflict; I never look abroad upon our wasted fields and\r\n     desolated homes; I never contemplate the all-embracing ruin\r\n     in which we are involved, the sad eclipse of our liberties and\r\n     the sinister aspect of the future, without inwardly resolving\r\n     to dedicate all I possess of ability for the public service\r\n     to the task of averting another such catastrophe, and to that\r\n     end of cultivating a spirit of forbearance and good feeling\r\n     among all classes and all sections of the country.\r\n\r\n     \"These, my dear sir, are the opinions, very briefly and\r\n     dogmatically delivered, which I entertain touching the actual\r\n     condition of the Southern states, and the policy proper for\r\n     them to pursue in the present juncture. They are the result of\r\n     anxious and conscientious reflection, of much observation of\r\n     the popular temper of the North, and of extreme and unabated\r\n     solicitude for the welfare of the community to which I am\r\n     attached by the strongest ties of filial devotion. With the\r\n     utmost sincerity of conviction, I believe that, by a system\r\n     of conduct in conformity to these suggestions, the Southern\r\n     people may achieve a prosperity and happiness equal to any\r\n     they ever enjoyed; while on the contrary, I am as firmly\r\n     persuaded that, by a vain and impatient resistance to an order\r\n     of things they cannot change, and to a destiny they cannot\r\n     escape, they will infinitely aggravate the miseries of their\r\n     present condition, and besides, bring down upon themselves\r\n     calamities appalling to contemplate.\r\n\r\n     \"I am not acquainted with the classification of parties, but\r\n     if these opinions make me a 'Radical,' then I am a 'Radical';\r\n     for they are deliberately the opinions of\r\n\r\n                                              \"Very truly yours,\r\n                                                   \"ROGER A. PRYOR.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1868 we removed to Brooklyn Heights near the\r\nFerry, much nearer my husband's office in Liberty Street. New York had\r\nnot then stretched an arm across East River and taken into its bosom\r\nBrooklyn—already the third city in the Union. The two cities, now one\r\nin name, were practically one in interest as early as 1867. A great\r\nmultitude of the dwellers of Brooklyn crossed the ferry every morning\r\non their way to their daily work in New York. Brooklyn was a huge,\r\novergrown village; a city of churches, a city of homes, and of children\r\ninnumerable. Every year in May a mighty army—thousands and thousands—of\r\nthese children paraded the streets under banners from their respective\r\nSunday-schools,—a unique spectacle well worth a pilgrimage thither,\r\nprovided one could content himself with a precarious footing on a\r\ncrowded sidewalk; for these children had the \"right of way\"—and knowing\r\ntheir right, dared maintain it.\r\n\r\nIn 1867 streets were so deserted—was not everybody in New York for the\r\nday?—that little children adopted them as a perfectly safe playground.\r\nThere were no elevated railroads, no trolley cars, no automobiles, no\r\nbicycles, no electric lights, no telephones.\r\n\r\nOur move was signalized by a complication of difficulties. Four of\r\nmy younger children found this an altogether suitable time to indulge\r\nin measles. Hasty visits to a near-by auction room resulted in a few\r\nneedful articles of furniture which were lent to us—for we could not\r\npurchase. The auctioneer was to own them, and reclaim them if not paid\r\nfor in a certain time. A small room was shelved for the books that\r\nhad survived the sacking of our house, and to our great satisfaction\r\nwe found that the much-used books—books of reference—had proven too\r\nbulky or too shabby to be stolen. These and other well-worn, well-read\r\nbooks became the nucleus of a large library, and hold to-day in their\r\ntattered bindings places of honor denied newer lights of more creditable\r\nappearance. We were not aware when we moved to Brooklyn Heights that\r\nwe had descended into the very centre of the wealthiest society of the\r\ncity. Had we known this, it would have signified nothing to us. Our\r\nextreme poverty forbade any expectation of indulgence in social life,\r\neven had we felt we had the smallest right to recognition. We had never\r\nknown anything about the social ambition of which in later years we hear\r\nso much—still less did we now regard it. We \"asked our fellow-man for\r\nleave to toil,\" and asked nothing more.\r\n\r\nWe soon discovered that the people around us lived in affluent ease\r\nand elegance—but that was not our affair! We had no place in their\r\nworld, nor did we desire it. To conceal our true condition was our\r\ninstinctive impulse, and to that end we shunned notice. Sometimes a\r\ngreat wave of desolation and loneliness—a longing inexpressible for\r\ncompanionship—would possess me. At this time there was a bridge over\r\nBroadway below Cortlandt Street. I sometimes, at seasons of great\r\ndepression, accompanied my husband to his office, and would ascend the\r\nsteps to this bridge and look up and down the restless sea of passing\r\ncrowds. Such a sickening sense of loneliness would come over me, I would\r\nfeel that my heart was breaking. All seemed so desolate, so hopeless,\r\nfor us in this great unknown world. We knew ourselves not only strangers\r\nbut aliens, outcasts.\r\n\r\nDear little Willy came to me one day and advised me to change his\r\nterrier's name, \"Rebel,\"—a name he had borne by reason of his own\r\ndisposition, and not at all in honor of the \"lost cause.\" \"The boys will\r\nstone him,\" said Willy; \"I am going to call him 'Prince' in the street\r\nand 'Rebel' at home.\" On another day his younger sisters were decoyed\r\ninto the garden of a neighbor, and there informed by the children of\r\nthe house that we would not be allowed to live in the street—that we\r\nwere \"Rebels, and slave-drivers, and _awful_ people!\" These painful\r\nincidents were of everyday occurrence. \"Mamma told me,\" said one of the\r\nlittle ones, \"that God loves us. Will everybody else hate us?\" Before\r\nvery long, however, the little rebels made friends and were forgiven\r\nall their enormities.\r\n\r\nThe good people of Brooklyn at that time were taking up their\r\ncobblestones and laying a wooden pavement on Pierpont Street, and\r\nfascinating blocks of wood were piled at intervals in the street. Of\r\ncourse, the boys immediately built of them a village of tiny houses,\r\nand one day a committee of bright-eyed fellows—Tom and Charley Nichols\r\nand Dr. Schenck's boys—waited on me with a request that my little girls\r\nbe permitted to \"come out and keep house\" for them. The little girls,\r\nthey added gallantly, would be allowed to choose the boys! That was\r\nnot difficult. The small housekeepers walked off with Tom and Charley.\r\n\"Say,\" said one of the proud owners of real estate, with a pristine\r\nrecognition of woman's place in the household, \"will your cook give you\r\nsome potatoes and apples? We've got a splendid fire around the corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, an I'll not lave you do it,\" said Anne out of the basement\r\nwindow. \"Is it burnin' down the place ye'll be afther doin'?\"—but a\r\n\"Please, Anne, dear,\" from the smallest housekeeper settled the matter.\r\nA fire in the street would be a strange spectacle in the Borough of\r\nBrooklyn to-day.\r\n\r\nA family of healthy children well governed cannot be unhappy, even\r\nin the most depressing circumstances. My own little brood positively\r\nrefused to be miserable. They had literally nothing that must be\r\nacquired with money, but their own ingenuity supplied all deficiencies.\r\nIn the vacant space in the rear of our house there was a cherry tree\r\nwhich never fruited, but bore a wealth of green leaves and blossoms.\r\nThere the children elected to establish a menagerie. They soon stocked\r\nit from the \"estray\" animals in the street. They were \"Rebel,\" the\r\nterrier; \"Vixen,\" the dachshund; \"Tearful Tommy,\" the cat; \"Desdemona,\"\r\na white rabbit; and \"Othello,\" her black husband, purchased from a\r\ndealer; and \"Fleetwing,\" the pigeon, which had trustfully entered one\r\nof Roger's traps. As there were no stockades, no cages, Fleetwing was\r\ntethered to the cherry tree, and as cord might wound her slender leg,\r\na broad string of muslin was provided for her comfort.\r\n\r\nOne day I heard lamentation and excited barking in the menagerie.\r\nFleetwing had vindicated her right to her name, and was calmly sailing\r\nin the blue ether, like a kite with a very long tail—her muslin fetter\r\ntrailing behind her. We hoped she would return, but she never did.\r\nOthello and Desdemona were very interesting. They always came, like\r\nchildren, to the table with the dessert, hopping around on the cloth\r\nfrom corner to corner for bits of celery; but when the fires were\r\nkindled, Desdemona breathed coal gas from the register, keeled over, and\r\nexpired. Othello's mourning coat expressed suitable sorrow and respect,\r\nbut very soon he too experimented with the register and followed his\r\nhelpmate.\r\n\r\nThe time came (with these healthy children to feed) when, like Mrs.\r\nCadwalader, I had to get my coals by stratagem and pray to heaven for\r\nmy salad oil—with this difference, that my prayer was for daily bread,\r\nand that alone. Long and painfully did I ponder the dreadful problem—how\r\nto keep my family alive without driving the dear head of the house to\r\ndesperation. Study, work, unremitting study and work from early morning\r\nuntil late at night was his daily portion. Not until the last expedient\r\nhad failed should he know aught of my household anxieties.\r\n\r\nAt last I resolved to go to a dignified old gentleman I had observed\r\nbehind the desk at a neighboring grocery and tell him the truth. But I\r\nremembered my New York experience with the silver. So be it! I had borne\r\nrebuff more than once—I could bear it again.\r\n\r\nI told Mr. Champney—for this was the name of the old gentleman—that I\r\nwas the wife of General Pryor, that we had come North to live, that my\r\nhusband's profession was not yielding enough for our support, nor had we\r\nany immediate ground upon which to build hope for better fortune; that\r\nI did hope, however, to pay for provisions for my family—sometime, not\r\nsoon, but certainly if we lived; and that certainly, without food, we\r\nshould _not_ live!\r\n\r\nHe wished to know if I was the mother of the children he had seen in his\r\nstore. I answered in the affirmative, and with no further parley he drew\r\nforth a little yellow pass-book and handed it to me. \"Use this freely,\r\nmadam,\" he said; \"I shall never ask you for a penny! You will pay me.\r\nGeneral Pryor is bound to succeed.\" He kept his word. His German porter,\r\nFred, came to me every morning for my frugal orders, and gave me every\r\npossible attention. At every day of reckoning demanded by myself, my\r\ncreditor politely remarked, there was \"no occasion for hurry\"! His name,\r\n\"S. T. Champney,\" was, thenceforward, with my children, \"the St.\"—and\r\nas such remains in my memory.\r\n\r\nThe city of Brooklyn had grown almost as rapidly as the Western\r\ncities—Chicago, Seattle, and others, and a great number of poor people\r\nwere crowding into it, seeking homes. Perpetually recurring instances\r\nof distress and homelessness appealed to the good women of Brooklyn\r\nHeights—Mrs. Bulkley, Mrs. Packer, Mrs. Alanson Trask, Mrs. Eaton,\r\nwife of a professor of the Packer Institute, Mrs. Rosman, Mrs. Craig,\r\nand others, and they finally resolved to found a home for friendless\r\nwomen and children. They rented a small frame building on one of the\r\nupper streets, and in a few months the house was crowded. Mrs. Eaton,\r\nearly sent by heaven to be my good angel, had longed for an opportunity\r\nto relieve my loneliness and isolation, and she procured for me an\r\ninvitation to join the society of women. I soon became interested,\r\nand spent part of every day with the wretched beneficiaries of the\r\ncharity. Finally our small house was unwisely crowded, and the children\r\nbecame ill. Mrs. Packer took one of the poor little babies in a dying\r\ncondition to her own home, and nursed it with the utmost tenderness. I\r\ngave shelter to one of the women, and others were taken by the different\r\nmembers of the society until we could command healthy quarters for\r\nthem. We resolved to purchase a large house, and entered with great\r\nzeal upon our work. It was my good fortune to discover the present Home\r\non Concord Street, the fine old Bache mansion about to be sold for a\r\nbeer-garden. I was requested to draw up a petition to the legislature\r\nfor an appropriation, which I did in the most forceful language I could\r\ncommand. Mrs. Packer went to Albany with it, and $10,000 was immediately\r\ngranted us. Each of us (we were only fifteen), armed with a little\r\ncollector's book, undertook to canvass the town. We needed $20,000 more\r\nto buy our home.\r\n\r\nI went forth with a heavy heart—for I was the only one who had not\r\nheaded her subscription with $500. I collected a few pitiful sums only.\r\nNobody would listen to me—nobody knew me! I bore it as long as I could,\r\nand one evening I announced to my astounded general that I intended to\r\ngive a concert. He informed me in strenuous English that he considered\r\nme a lunatic.\r\n\r\nHowever, I went to work. I engaged a professional reader, who agreed\r\nto give his services; persuaded a German music teacher to lend me her\r\npupils; and then looked around for a \"star.\" Investigation resulted in\r\nmy learning that Madame Anna Bishop was living in New York. Once a very\r\nfamous prima donna, she was now \"shelved,\" although her voice was still\r\ngood. She had grown stout, and could no longer create a sensation in\r\n\"The Dashing Young Sergeant\" that \"marched away\" so gallantly fifteen\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nI hunted up Madame Bishop. She received my proposition graciously. Would\r\nshe give an evening for the poor friendless women? \"_Give_, my dear\r\nlady! I give nothing. Am I not a friendless woman myself! But I'll come\r\nfor $100, and bring my accompanist. _He_ shall give _his_ evening. But\r\nI never sing for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nI engaged madame—and then I was a busy woman indeed. I hired a hall and\r\ntwo pianos, wrote programmes and advertisements and had rose-colored\r\ncards painted, \"Soirée, Musical and Literary.\" I discovered a florist\r\nnear my hall, and persuaded him to lend me all his plants,—I wrote\r\ninvitations to my ushers and presented each one with a crystal heart for\r\na badge,—and then I went home, on the great evening, tired to death, and\r\nperfectly sure it would end in failure. My general, fully of the same\r\nopinion, tried to comfort me by saying that I would know better next\r\ntime. He went early to the hall, and when I arrived he was pacing the\r\nstreet in front of the door. \"The place is crammed full,\" he announced;\r\n\"there is hardly standing room.\"\r\n\r\nIt wanted but eight minutes to the hour announced for commencing, and\r\nMadame Bishop had not arrived. Mrs. Gamp's fiddle-string illustration\r\nwould have again been a feeble expression of mine. My heart almost\r\nfailed me. But at last the expected carriage arrived,—madame, her maid,\r\nand her accompanist. To my exclamation of relief, she threw back her\r\nhead and laughed heartily: \"Oh, you amateurs! Now, you just go and get\r\na seat and enjoy the music. We'll go on by the programme all right.\"\r\n\r\nAdvance sale of tickets had yielded $100. This I handed madame in an\r\nenvelope. All went well. She was very good indeed—very spirited. The\r\ndashing young sergeant marched away with all the fire of earlier days.\r\nEverybody was pleased. When I thanked madame, she slipped into my hand\r\nher own donation—$50. The next day I entered $500 upon my collection\r\nbook and, thus vindicated, I was able to face my colleagues.\r\n\r\nA great and useful charity is this Home for friendless women and\r\nchildren in Brooklyn. And noble were the women I learned to know\r\nand love who worked with me there. They made me their corresponding\r\nsecretary, and liked everything I did for them.\r\n\r\nSome women formerly of high position in the South found temporary\r\nrefuge in this Home. The world would be surprised if I should give\r\ntheir names! In the depth of winter I once found a woman bearing one of\r\nVirginia's oldest names. She was sitting upon a box beside a fireless\r\nstove, warming her baby in her bosom. Her husband had gone out to hunt\r\nfor work! She had no fire, no furniture, no food! Another, belonging\r\nto a proud South Carolina family, I found in an attic in New York. She\r\nhad had no food for two days! These, and more, I was enabled by the\r\nlovely women of Brooklyn to relieve, delicately and permanently. Better,\r\ntruer, more cultivated women I have nowhere known. Of the extent of\r\nmy own anxieties and privations they never knew. Something within me\r\nproudly forbade me to complain. My dear Mrs. Eaton alone knew the true\r\ncondition of my own family. She lives to bear testimony to the truth of\r\nthe strange story I am telling—the story of a Southern general and his\r\nwife, who showed smiling, brave faces to the world, and suffered for\r\nten years the pangs of extreme poverty in their home, working all the\r\ntime to the utmost limit of human endurance. Not one moment's recreation\r\ndid we allow ourselves—our \"destiny was work, work, work\"—and patiently\r\nwe fulfilled it. Hard study filled my husband's every waking hour, and\r\nfew were his hours of sleep. Excessive use of his eyes night and day\r\nso injured them that at one time he found reading impossible. Gordon\r\nread his law aloud to him for many weeks. I once copied a book of law\r\nforms for him as we had no money to buy the book—the hardest work I\r\nhave ever done! It was my custom to retire at night with my family\r\nand, after all were quietly sleeping, to rise and with my work-basket\r\ncreep down to the library, light a lamp, and sew until two or three\r\no'clock in the morning. There were seven children. All must be clothed.\r\nI literally made every garment they wore, even their wraps in winter.\r\nThrough the kindness of Professor Eaton arrangements were made that\r\nenabled my little girls to attend the Packer Institute, founded by the\r\nmost gracious and beautiful of women, Mrs. Harriet Packer. When they\r\nwent forth in the morning to their school, they all presented a fresh,\r\nwell-groomed appearance—the result of the midnight lamp and work-basket!\r\n\r\nI remember but one occasion when any member of the family indulged in\r\noutside amusements. Just across the river were the brilliant theatres\r\nand opera-houses of the great metropolis. Here in Brooklyn were plays,\r\nconcerts, balls, evening parties. The children for five or six years\r\nafter our coming North never supposed these things possible for them. I\r\ncannot say the fate of Tantalus was ours. True, the rivers of delight\r\nwere around us, but we never \"bent to drink\"—never gave the \"refluent\r\nwaters\" an opportunity to shrink from our lips. We simply ignored them.\r\nBut Gordon and Roger had one great pleasure in 1868. It would be hard\r\nto make this generation understand the emotions with which they saw\r\nand heard Dickens. His books had for a time made the very atmosphere\r\nof their lives! They talked Dickensese to each other, and fitted his\r\ncharacters into the situations of their own lives. Now they were to look\r\nupon the man himself. Of this experience my daughter writes me:—\r\n\r\n     \"I remember as I awaited his appearance how my heart beat.\r\n     I doubt whether the recrudescence of Shakespeare would move\r\n     me as much now. At the appointed hour he ascended the little\r\n     platform of Plymouth Church with a rapid gait, almost running\r\n     up the few steps, as I remember; but truly my heart was\r\n     thumping so, and there was such a mist of agitation before\r\n     my eyes, that I did not at once clearly discern the great\r\n     magician. When my brain cleared with a jerk and I could make\r\n     myself believe that Dickens was really before me, what did I\r\n     see? A very garish person with a velvet-faced coat and a vast\r\n     double watch chain—all, as well as his rather heavy-nosed\r\n     unspiritual face perfectly presented in the photograph of\r\n     the time. He had an alert, businesslike way with him, no\r\n     magnetism, as I recollect. But his reading impressed me then\r\n     as now, as perfection of elocution—natural, spontaneous, as\r\n     if he himself enjoyed every word of it and had never done it\r\n     before. He read the trial scene from Pickwick inimitably. I\r\n     think I have since seen the criticism that he did not give us\r\n     the Sam Weller of our imagination, but certainly it did not\r\n     so impress me then. I was absolutely satisfied. He followed\r\n     Pickwick with Dr. Marigold, for which I cared much less.\r\n     Dickens's pathos, even in my days of thraldom, almost always\r\n     struck me as mawkish. Somehow, in looking at the man, it was\r\n     hard to believe in his sentiment—though I still think much\r\n     of it sincere. But truly, in appearance, he is what is now\r\n     called 'a bounder.' I never read Forster's life of him: I\r\n     know him only through his own books, but my impression of him\r\n     from his appearance is that he was not exactly a gentleman.\r\n     Yet I forgot everything except delight in the reading—after\r\n     my initial shock of the velvet coat, the ponderous watch\r\n     chains, the countenance to match. And to this day one of my\r\n     most cherished memories is that I saw and heard Dickens.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nI soon found that two of my children were old enough to pine for\r\nsomething more than physical comfort. They did not propose to live\r\nby bread alone. The appealing eyes of our daughter Gordon were not\r\nto be resisted and, as I have said, she entered the Packer Institute\r\nwith her little sisters, entering the senior class, where she soon\r\ngraduated with the first honors,—and where she nobly taught an advanced\r\nclass,—relinquishing at eighteen years of age all the pleasures to which\r\nshe was entitled. Theo, I supposed, would learn law in his father's\r\noffice. But he, too, like Goethe, craved \"more light.\" One day as I was\r\nreturning from church he asked me, with suppressed feeling, if he was\r\never to go to college.\r\n\r\nI was smitten to the heart! When I repeated this to his father, he\r\ndeclared, \"He shall!\" And within a few months a scholarship at Princeton\r\nwas found and promised, provided the boy could pass a creditable\r\nentrance examination.\r\n\r\nThe little man went up alone early one morning to meet his fate. He\r\nreturned at night. \"And did you enter?\" we exclaimed. Very calmly he\r\nanswered: \"They were very kind to me at Princeton. I was examined at\r\nsome length, and I shall enter the junior class.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I packed his small trunk for his collegiate life, I found I had\r\nlittle to put into it—little more than my tears! His first report read,\r\n\"In a class of eighty-three he stands first.\"\r\n\r\nHe maintained this standing for two years. The class included bearded\r\nmen who had been prepared thoroughly in the best preparatory schools.\r\nTheo had received less than two years at Mr. Gordon McCabe's school.\r\nAll the rest of his time he had given to study, alone, and unassisted.\r\n\r\nA day came in Petersburg when he, perceiving the necessities of his\r\nfamily, had sold his beloved rifle for $40. Out of that sum he reserved\r\nfor himself $2, and returned home with a work on advanced mathematics\r\nunder his arm.\r\n\r\nHe was a _perfect_ boy. If he ever thought wrongly, I cannot tell—I\r\nknow he never did wrong. Personally, he was as beautiful as he was\r\ngood—clear-eyed, serene, with a grand air. \"For the future of one of\r\nmy children,\" I was wont to say, \"I have no fear. Theo will always\r\nbe fortunate.\" It was said of him by President McCosh that he was\r\n\"preternaturally gifted mentally.\" He always acquired knowledge with\r\nperfect ease. He studied and read whatever his father studied or\r\nread—politics, literature, and even military tactics. In the latter\r\nhe was so proficient that when a little lad in linen blouses, the\r\nregiments at Smithfield would mount him on a stand and make him drill\r\nthe companies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THEODORICK BLAND PRYOR.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of his collegiate life he wrote: \"The professors have\r\nbeen so good as to give me the first honor and also the mathematical\r\nscholarship.\" This scholarship required him to study at least one\r\nyear in an English university. Accordingly, in the following autumn he\r\nwas sent, through President McCosh's advice, to St. Peters, Cambridge\r\nUniversity. He was just nineteen when he graduated.\r\n\r\nHe was too young and inexperienced to be a good manager, and soon\r\nperceived that his $1000 would not carry him through his year. A prize\r\nof a Cambridge scholarship and $40 was offered. He worked for it and\r\nwon it—binding wet towels around his tired brain as he worked.\r\n\r\nI remember one lovely June afternoon, which melted into a perfect\r\nmoonlight evening. My little girls, attired in white, listened to the\r\nhome music,—Roger, with his violin, accompanied by his mother on the\r\npiano my dear Aunt Mary had bequeathed to Gordon. A hasty ring at the\r\ndoor, a rush of eager steps, and Theo was in my arms! We thought him\r\nlovely. His father proudly marked his fine air and, with amusement, the\r\ndelicate hint of a rising inflection in his voice. Never were people so\r\nglad and proud. Once more we were all together.\r\n\r\nHe decided not to return to England, although his masters at Cambridge\r\nwrote him assuring him that, although he \"could not win a fellowship\r\nwithout becoming a naturalized British subject,\" yet he would\r\n\"ultimately take an excellent degree.\" He entered the Columbia Law\r\nSchool, that he might fit himself to be his father's partner.\r\n\r\nIn October he was called to a higher court. One warm evening he walked\r\nout \"to cool off before sleeping,\" and we never saw him more!\r\n\r\nThe tides bore his beautiful body to us nine days after we lost him,\r\nand his beloved Alma Mater claimed it. There he lies in the section\r\nreserved for the presidents and professors of the University—side by\r\nside with the ashes of the Edwards and the Alexanders that await with\r\nhim the great awakening. His classmates sent to Virginia for a shaft\r\nof granite, and upon this stone is inscribed: \"In commemoration of his\r\nvirtues, genius, and scholarship, and in enduring testimony of our love,\r\nthis monument is erected by his classmates.\"\r\n\r\nOf him a great future was expected. \"He was,\" said one of the journals\r\nof the time, \"one of the most gifted minds that Virginia ever produced.\r\nAmerica probably had not his superior. Only twenty years at the\r\ntime of his death, his powerful and mature intellect gave assurance\r\nof any position his ambition might covet. He was always first, and\r\neasily first, in any school, academy, or college that he entered. His\r\npowers were indeed marvellous. Proud of being a Virginian, his loss\r\nto the state, to the country indeed, is irreparable. In arms and in\r\nstatesmanship Virginia has nothing to covet,—in letters a new field of\r\nglory awaits her. Pryor, foremost in that field, would have filled it\r\nwith the lustre of his fame. Oh! what a loss, what a loss!\"\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar bitterness in the early blighting of such powers.\r\nBut although the laurel was so soon snatched from his brow, he had\r\nalready worked nobly and achieved greatly. He had done more in his\r\nshort life than the most of us during a long life. Whether the end came\r\nthrough the hand of violence, or from accident, he could approach \"the\r\nGreat Secret\" as did John Sterling, \"without a thought of fear and with\r\nvery much of hope.\" Such as he confirm our faith in immortality and make\r\nheaven lovelier to our thought.\r\n\r\nHe was a victim of his father's fallen fortunes. Now, surely, Nemesis\r\nmust be satisfied! Innocent of crime, we had yet suffered full measure\r\nfor the crime of the nation. Others had been called to give up their\r\nfirst-born sons. We had now given up ours! Was it not enough? All the\r\njoy of life was forever ended. Hereafter one bitter memory intensified\r\nevery pang, poisoned every pleasure,—so clearly did our great\r\nbereavement seem to grow out of our misfortunes,—and all these to be\r\nthe sequence of cruel, terrible, wicked war.\r\n\r\nBut why should I ask my readers to listen while I press, \"like Philomel,\r\nmy heart against a thorn!\" We can change nothing in our lives. We must\r\nbear the lot ordained for us! We need not ask others to suffer with us!\r\n_Grosse seelen dulden still!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe story I am telling must end not later than the year 1900—and I\r\nfind no fitting place for a brief tribute to another brilliant son whom\r\nwe lost after that year, unless my readers will forgive me for a word\r\njust here. I leave the splendid record of his services as a physician\r\nand surgeon, where it is safe to live—in the memories of his brethren\r\nat home and abroad. \"Pryor's practice\" is still quoted in England and\r\nFrance as the salvation of suffering womanhood. But other records are\r\nwritten on the hearts of the poor and humble. \"Many a night,\" said one\r\nof his hospital confrères, \"with the East River full of ice, and snow\r\nand sleet pelting straight in his face, Dr. William Pryor has crossed\r\nin a rowboat to see some poor waif at Blackwell's Island upon whom he\r\nhad operated,—carrying with him some delicacy the hospital diet-sheet\r\ndid not afford.\"\r\n\r\nHe was most richly endowed, physically and mentally, and he gave to\r\nsuffering humanity all that God had given him.\r\n\r\nI resolved, when I consented to write this book, that I would not\r\nintrude my own feelings and emotions upon those who are kind enough to\r\nread my story. I know, alas, I am not the only one upon whom the tower\r\nof Siloam has fallen. We are divinely forbidden to believe ourselves\r\nmore unworthy than those who escape such disaster.\r\n\r\n\"The Thorny Path,\" a painting by P. Stachiewicz, represents women\r\ntoiling along a perilous path. On one side is a high, barren rock; on\r\nthe other a ghastly precipice. Safety lies only in the narrow path,\r\nuneven with slippery stones and thick-set with cruel thorns. Two women\r\nare central figures in the procession: one, ragged and drunken and\r\ncursing her lot, reels unsteadily against the flinty wall; another\r\ntreads the same path with bent head, and hands clasped in prayer.\r\nA white \"robe of righteousness\" has descended upon the latter, and\r\ncelestial light surrounds her head, albeit the pilgrim feet are unshod\r\nand torn with thorns.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: WILLIAM RICE PRYOR.]\r\n\r\nSometimes a song or picture has taught us more than many sermons. When\r\nChristine Nilsson, standing firm and erect with upward look, sang\r\n\"I KNOW,\" we were thrilled and surprised into a vivid faith, which\r\nhad burned with less fervor under the teaching of the pulpit. We had\r\nbelieved, but now we felt that we _knew_, that the Redeemer lives and\r\nwill stand in the latter day upon the earth, and feeling this, we were\r\ncomforted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1872 Horace Greeley was nominated by the Democratic party for the\r\npresidency, to oppose General Grant's second term, and wrote to my\r\nhusband:—\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR GENERAL PRYOR:—\r\n\r\n     \"I want you to help me in this canvass. I want you to go to\r\n     Virginia and do some work for me there and at the South.\r\n\r\n                                               \"Your friend,\r\n                                                   \"HORACE GREELEY.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley had at first opposed the Civil War. He had suffered great\r\nmental distress at its approach. He labored with all his might to\r\nprevent a resort to arms—but, when this was inevitable, he followed\r\nthe advice of Polonius. It was he who raised the cry \"On to Richmond,\"\r\nand he was thereafter a powerful supporter of the government. After\r\nthe surrender, he just as strongly advocated pacific measures, opposed\r\nthe action of the federal government in holding Mr. Jefferson Davis a\r\nprisoner without trial, and, oblivious to all personal and pecuniary\r\nconsequences, had gone to Richmond and in open court signed the\r\nbail-bond of the Confederate President.\r\n\r\nIt can be easily perceived that the active support of a man like General\r\nPryor—who could remember and use to advantage these facts—might be\r\nextremely useful to Mr. Greeley. The temptation appealed, with force,\r\nto my husband. Active political life had been his most successful,\r\nmost agreeable occupation, but he remembered his resolution to _work_,\r\nand work in the study of his profession, and declined Mr. Greeley's\r\ninvitation.\r\n\r\n\"You are making a great mistake,\" said one of his friends, \"in your\r\noffice all day, and at home all night. I should like to know how you\r\nexpect to get along! You never make a visit—you are never seen at a club\r\nor any public gathering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" said my husband, \"but I am persuaded that my only hope for\r\nsalvation here is to know something, have something the New York people\r\nwant. They do want good lawyers, and I must study day and night to make\r\nmyself one.\"\r\n\r\nHis friend, John Russell Young, far away in Europe, heard of Mr.\r\nGreeley's campaign. Himself an intense Republican and devoted friend of\r\nGeneral Grant, he could not learn with equanimity of any added strength\r\nto Mr. Greeley from the support of the South. He wrote from Geneva,\r\nSeptember 16, 1872:—\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR PRYOR:—\r\n\r\n     \"I saw in the _New York World_ that you were to make a speech\r\n     in favor of Greeley in Virginia, and had my own reflections\r\n     on the announcement. I should like to exchange observations\r\n     with Mrs. Pryor on this subject, as she has positive\r\n     political convictions. But I remember her saying once that\r\n     darning stockings had a debilitating effect upon literary\r\n     aspirations—and she made no reservation in favor of politics.\r\n     At the present moment I should like to enlist her attention\r\n     and support.\r\n\r\n     \"The idea of R. A. P.—the representative fire-eater, the\r\n     Robespierre, or Danton, or, if you like it better, the\r\n     Harry Hotspur of the Southern Revolution,—the one orator\r\n     who clamored so impatiently for the Shrewsbury clock to\r\n     strike,—oh, my friend! The spectacle of _this_ leader\r\n     championing Horace Greeley! Can the irony of events have a\r\n     deeper illustration? Miserere! How the world is tumbling! What\r\n     can we expect next? Jefferson Davis and Frederick Douglass\r\n     running on the presidential ticket, in favor of Chinese\r\n     suffrage! If you really did make a speech, send it to me. I\r\n     suppose in your own mind you have made many, for events like\r\n     these develop thought in the minds of all thinking men. I do\r\n     not see Greeley's election. I have a letter from him written\r\n     in July which speaks very cheerfully. But I have a letter from\r\n     the White House quite as cheerful. I cannot think that Grant\r\n     will be beaten; and am certain, with all deference to Mrs.\r\n     Pryor's positive political views, that he should not be. I can\r\n     understand the passionate desire you and your people have for\r\n     honest reconstruction. I can see how you might even fall into\r\n     the arms of Horace Greeley to achieve such a deliverance. But\r\n     there is no honest reconstruction possible under Mr. Greeley\r\n     and the men who would accompany him in power. The South has\r\n     its future in its own hands. If the men who led it as you did\r\n     had followed your example when the war was over, there would\r\n     be no trouble. But that required courage—a higher courage than\r\n     ever rebellion demanded; and if the South has not reasserted\r\n     itself, it is the fault of the Southern men themselves.\r\n\r\n     \"But I will not preach politics from this distance. If you\r\n     are not in the campaign, keep out! Run over here with Miss\r\n     Gordon. How delighted I should be to see you. I am sure\r\n     mademoiselle would revel in Paris. Mrs. Young would travel\r\n     with her, too, to Germany, visit all the famous convents and\r\n     ecclesiastical establishments and, finally, wind up with Paris\r\n     and an exhausted search through the shops.\r\n\r\n     \"For myself, I feel that I am having opportunities and\r\n     neglecting them. However, I have always my work, have grappled\r\n     with French, done something in Spanish, and have designs on\r\n     the German language. But as you can only eat your artichoke\r\n     a leaf at a time, French is my main occupation outside my\r\n     business. I don't have time to play chess—and I presume Miss\r\n     Gordon will give me a knight when we play next. You mustn't\r\n     think me utterly good-for-naught. I have finished Carlyle's\r\n     'Frederick' in thirteen volumes—think of that! In the summer\r\n     I dissipated in novels,—'Don Quixote,' 'Tom Jones,' 'Roderick\r\n     Random,'—and now I am about to begin 'Romola,' which Bayard\r\n     Taylor said yesterday was the best historical novel in our\r\n     language. Remember me most kindly to all at home, and believe\r\n     me to be, dear Pryor,\r\n\r\n                                         \"Your friend sincerely,\r\n                                                \"JOHN RUSSELL YOUNG.\r\n\r\nWe had first known John Russell Young as a boy sent by Colonel Forney\r\nto report a speech of my husband's in Congress, now on the staff of the\r\n_New York Herald_. During a temporary residence in London he began a\r\nseries of charming letters to my daughter—lasting until the end of his\r\nlife. From London he wrote:—\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR MISS GORDON:—\r\n\r\n     \"I send you two autographs—one is from Dinah Mulock Craik (who\r\n     wrote 'John Halifax,' you know), the other from Mr. Gladstone,\r\n     the former Premier.\r\n\r\n     \"I shall try to obtain an autograph of Carlyle, and his\r\n     photograph, for your library. The old man is very hard to\r\n     reach—he is very old. I have not seen George Eliot yet, but\r\n     will. I dined with William Black last evening.\r\n\r\n     \"I have had a good time in London. I never had so much\r\n     attention in my life—I don't know how it happened, but so\r\n     it fell. My Macmillan article opened the door, however, of\r\n     every newspaper and magazine to me—and the door is of no use,\r\n     except to look inside! But fancy the people I have met!—not,\r\n     as I said, Carlyle or George Eliot (but she is possible\r\n     when she comes home), but I think I have dined with nearly\r\n     everybody else. Green—the short history man—and I have become\r\n     good friends. I told him how much you liked his book, and he\r\n     blushed like a June rose. I have dined with Huxley, Tyndall,\r\n     Froude, Browning, Herbert Spencer, Kingsley, Bryce, Green,\r\n     Norman Lockyer, William Black, Motley, and I don't know how\r\n     many others,—so you see, as far as coming abroad has any value\r\n     in enlarging one's horizon, I have not come in vain. You must\r\n     forgive the vanity of all this, but when one is away from\r\n     home, what can one do but write about one's own self?\r\n\r\n     \"I wrote your father last week that I was about to come home.\r\n     I packed all my trunks and engaged my room on the _Adriatic_,\r\n     which sails on the 25th. A cable comes from Mr. Bennett\r\n     asking me to await his coming. So I have unpacked my trunk and\r\n     again resigned myself to the London fog. If you will gently\r\n     break the news to the retired statesman who mourns over the\r\n     decadence of the republic, you will be a dutiful child and my\r\n     very good friend. I am very much disappointed in not going\r\n     home. There is a little woman whose eyes are, I suppose,\r\n     sad enough straining through the mists for a truant lord who\r\n     seems to wander as long as Ulysses. There are friends whose\r\n     faces it would be sunshine to see,—and there are duties in\r\n     the way of educating public opinion on the question of the\r\n     presidency,—all of which is only a roundabout way of saying\r\n     I am homesick, and that I would give the best book in my\r\n     library (you see how extravagant I am) if it were in my power\r\n     to accept an invitation from your mother to tea.

However, as that is a subject from which I\r\n     have often been warned away by the Pryor family, I shall not\r\n     venture to give any advice.\r\n\r\n                                   \"Again your friend sincerely,\r\n                                               \"JNO.

You will observe the tendency\r\n     to criticise, and quotations of little things to sustain an\r\n     adverse verdict. I remember only better things. Of course\r\n     I must acknowledge the tinge of bitterness in all of George\r\n     Eliot's writings, but the latter-day critic brings a railing\r\n     accusation against the artistic features of her books. He\r\n     thinks it was a dreadful thing for Dorothea to marry a second\r\n     time, but how trifling is all this! I always feel when I\r\n     have finished 'Adam Bede' and 'Middlemarch' like saying\r\n     in reverence, 'Oh, Mistress! Oh, my Queen!' for she is the\r\n     mistress and queen of her art, and ought to be mentioned with\r\n     Carlyle and Hugo.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"chance\" for which General Pryor for nine years had worked and\r\nwaited came at last. A New York correspondent of the _St. Louis\r\nRepublican_ thus comments upon the event: \"General Pryor borrowed the\r\nlaw books which he needed to begin the study requisite to enable him to\r\ndo justice to his clients, and he studied as he fought—bravely. No man\r\nhas burned more midnight oil, and from being no lawyer ten years ago,\r\nhe has grown to be a most accomplished and erudite member of the bar. In\r\nhis late great speech in the trial of Tilton against Henry Ward Beecher,\r\nin resisting the attempt of William M. Evarts, of Beecher's counsel,\r\nto prevent the plaintiff from testifying, General Pryor hurled law at\r\nthe head of Mr. Evarts which the latter in all of his delving had not\r\nreached, and Mr. Evarts complimented General Pryor, not only upon the\r\nbrilliant presentation of the law, but upon his extended acquaintance\r\nwith the authorities. His speech won the point for Tilton. He is known\r\nto be an indefatigable student. Seven hours a day he studies law as\r\nthough he needs it all on the morrow. No man in New York has a more\r\nbrilliant future; and when it comes, no man will have so completely\r\ncarved out his own way and made his own fortune.\"\r\n\r\nThis trial against America's great preacher was famous at home and in\r\nEngland. The accusation of Theodore Tilton aroused a tremendous feeling\r\nthroughout the United States and abroad wherever Mr. Beecher's great\r\nreputation had established itself. The trial lasted six months. Mr.\r\nTilton's counsel were Mr. Beach, Hon. Sam Morris, Judge Fullerton, and\r\nGeneral Pryor. Arrayed against them were Hon. William M. Evarts, Hon.\r\nBenjamin Tracy, Thomas Shearman, and Austin Abbott.\r\n\r\nTo General Pryor was intrusted all the delicate or obscure questions of\r\nlaw incident upon the case. The press of the day universally awarded him\r\nthe highest praise for learning and thorough knowledge of his subject.\r\nHe won a very great reputation, and from that time onward felt that\r\nhis professional career was to be an active one. The impression the new\r\nadvocate—the rebel politician and soldier turned lawyer—made upon the\r\ncorrespondents of the press never varied. A New York correspondent of\r\nan Ohio paper[7] thus describes him:—\r\n\r\n     \"General Pryor's reply to Mr. Evarts's was, after all,\r\n     the greatest surprise of the day. It was so remarkable\r\n     in many respects, that I am at a loss where to begin the\r\n     characterization. Not an exciting topic, one would say, for a\r\n     fiery Southern orator, to analyze the statutes of the state of\r\n     New York on the subject of evidence from married people. But\r\n     it was evident from the very first, though formal, sentence,\r\n     that exploded from General Pryor's lips that he needed no\r\n     outward occasion to minister excitement to his surcharged\r\n     batteries of personal electricity. A dry legal question was\r\n     provocation enough; what he would do under the heat of an\r\n     impassioned issue is inconceivable, if the proportions of\r\n     occasion and effect were preserved. His execution, to borrow\r\n     a musician's term, is prodigious, considered merely as a\r\n     _tour de force_. It is a volcanic torrent of speech. To say\r\n     the enunciation is rapid, is nothing: it is lightning-like.\r\n     The most dexterous reporters could hardly follow him. Its\r\n     nervous energy is equally remarkable, and seems to break out\r\n     from every pore of his body, as well as out of his mouth,\r\n     eyes, and finger ends. With the legal volume in his left\r\n     hand, the eye-glass quivering in his right, and jumping to\r\n     his nose and off again, with or without object, like a thing\r\n     of life, or emphasizing the utterance with thrusting gestures\r\n     of its own; his head thrown up, at every beginning his eyes\r\n     shoot straight at the judge as if they would transfix him,\r\n     and he drives onward like a Jehu rushing into battle. He has\r\n     no moderate passages; but perhaps he will avail himself of\r\n     these effects when he comes to address the jury. And yet,\r\n     all this prodigious nervous expenditure, so far from drawing\r\n     off the power of the brain, is only an index of its action;\r\n     so far from jarring the self-possession and sequence of\r\n     thought, or the precision of conception and expression, it\r\n     only enhances and secures all these, as sheer impetus sustains\r\n     the equilibrium of a wheel. The diction, with all its headlong\r\n     speed, is perfect in precision and force, and no less in\r\n     elegance; not an after word, not a word of surplusage, or a\r\n     word to be bettered in revisal; and the like is true of the\r\n     closely knit argument.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture, drawn with a bold hand, greatly amused the home circle in\r\nWillow Street. But then, we had not heard the speech!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nGordon and I had the privilege of seeing Charlotte Cushman when, no\r\nlonger able to act in the plays in which she had so distinguished\r\nherself, she gave a reading at one of the large halls in New York. She\r\nwas infirm, less from age than a malady which was consuming her. I found\r\nan immense audience assembled in her honor. There were no more seats, no\r\nmore standing room. She had no assistants, no support. A chair behind a\r\nsmall table was all the _mise en scène_, and here, dressed in a matronly\r\ngown of black silk and lace, the great tragedienne seated herself.\r\nHer gray hair was rolled back _à la Pompadour_ from her broad, high\r\nforehead, and beneath black brows her eye kindled as she glanced over\r\nthe fine audience. As she described it afterward, \"a modest farewell\r\nreading blossomed into a brilliant testimonial.\"\r\n\r\nAfter our enthusiastic response to her graceful greeting, she said\r\nsimply: \"Ladies and gentlemen, I shall read—I trust for your pleasure,\r\nsurely for mine,\" laying her hand upon her heart—\"from the second scene\r\nin the third act of 'Henry the Eighth.'\"\r\n\r\nIt so happened there had been, incident upon her appearance, a\r\nremarkable discussion in some of the journals of the day. The wise\r\nones, the elect, had paused in their speculations as to the authorship\r\nof Shakespeare's plays, or the Letters of Junius, or the enlightenment\r\nof the nations by certain rearrangement of periods in Hamlet's immortal\r\nsoliloquy, and had cast an eye of scrutiny upon Wolsey's magnificent\r\nmonologue. To _nous autres_ it seems clear enough as it is—but who\r\nare we that we should know the heart hidden under a red robe? They\r\ngravely opined that the _king_, not _God_, was meant in the lines, \"Had\r\nI but served my God with half the zeal,\" etc. Without doubt Charlotte\r\nCushman was aware of this remarkable discussion. A good many backs were\r\nstraightened to \"attention\" as she reached the noble words:—\r\n\r\n         \"... O Cromwell, Cromwell!\r\n     Had I but served my God with half the zeal\r\n     I served my king, HE would not in mine age\r\n     Have left me naked to mine enemies.\"\r\n\r\nShe pointed upward as she uttered reverently the word \"HE.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this, after a brief pause—she did not leave her seat all\r\nevening—she passed to \"Much Ado about Nothing.\" Never was there such a\r\nDogberry, bursting with arrogance and ignorance. Mrs. Maloney, on the\r\nChinese question, followed, dismissing, with inimitable impudence, the\r\nmistress who had just shown her the door. Then she became the loyal,\r\nspirited, wildly sweet Kentucky girl and her blue-grass horse, Kentucky\r\nBelle,—utterly charming, both of them,—concluding with \"Molly Carew,\" In\r\nthis she was tremendous. The policemen at the door came in to listen;\r\nthe applause was loud and long. \"Molly Carew,\" forsooth! What is there\r\nin \"Molly Carew\"? What in the entreaty to take off her bonnet lest she\r\ncost her lover, as he declares, \"the loss of me wanderin' soul,\" to\r\nbring down the house? What in the indignant summing up that she had\r\nbetter be careful; \"you'll feel mighty queer when you see me weddin'\r\nmairching down the street an' yersilf not in it\"?\r\n\r\nI soon found out how much there was in Molly Carew _per se_ with no\r\nCharlotte Cushman to interpret! I happened to have Samuel Lover's poems,\r\nand when I reached home, I took the book from the library shelves and\r\nsummoned the children to listen to the funniest thing they had ever\r\nheard in all their lives. \"I warn you,\" said I, \"you'll half kill\r\nyourselves laughing.\"\r\n\r\nI read \"Molly Carew.\" Round eyes opened wider in astonishment as I\r\nproceeded. There was not a smile; not the faintest glimmer of mirth.\r\nDead silence was broken by a polite \"Is that all? Thank you, mamma,\"\r\nas they escaped. Oh, genius, gift of the gods! Who can measure it?\r\nWho, not born to it, can hope to win it! Who can attain even a faraway\r\nimitation of it! How it can clothe and glorify the simplest ideas! How\r\nit transfigured Charlotte Cushman—haggard and gray from keen physical\r\nsuffering, knowing well that her hour was at hand! What noble restraint\r\nin her selections, ignoring pain and sorrow, denying herself the tribute\r\nof sympathy, bidding us good night with a smile on her lips and words\r\ndemanding an answering smile on ours!\r\n\r\nTo remember Charlotte Cushman is to recall Madame Helena\r\nModjeska—totally different, certainly not inferior. I met her in society\r\nin New York. Her beautiful face, her tender, sensitive mouth, and the\r\n\"far-away look of her eyes, as though she were thinking of the wrongs\r\nof Poland,\" are never to be forgotten. And the splendor of her genius! I\r\nsaw her as Ophelia to Edwin Booth's Hamlet. \"You are as good as a Greek\r\nchorus, my lord,\"—she in a Savonarola chair, he on a _fauteuil_ at her\r\nfeet. I saw her also as Queen Catherine. I think she impressed all who\r\nknew her as a most sad woman. But is not melancholy the prerogative of\r\ngenius? I, for one, never knew a man or woman of genius, real genius,\r\nwho was merry. Madame Modjeska made melancholy beautiful.\r\n\r\nShe was once the guest of a lady who had gathered together a number of\r\nchoice spirits in her honor. One of them, forgotten of her good angel,\r\nasked, \"How do you like our country, madame!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" spreading out her hands to signify empty space, and speaking in\r\na weary tone, \"Oh! It is _all_—_all_ one great level.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but,\" said her hostess, \"patience! I shall introduce you by and by\r\nto a little hill.\"\r\n\r\nAn introduction followed, and at the close of the evening Madame\r\nModjeska, pressing the hand of her hostess at parting, said with\r\nfeeling:—\r\n\r\n\"Ah, madame! _She_ was one great mountain!\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HELENA MODJESKA.]\r\n\r\nBefore the war which cut me off from every pleasure demanding leisure\r\nand a little money, I heard the elder Booth in \"Hamlet\"—and I must\r\nconfess he was rather a wheezy Hamlet in his old age. In Brooklyn the\r\ncircumstances of my life forbade my indulging my passion for music and\r\nthe enjoyment of a good play, but we had tickets for gallery seats to\r\nsee Edwin Booth when Madame Modjeska played with him. Afterward we saw\r\nhim in \"The Fool's Revenge,\" and I remember being quite carried away\r\nand oblivious of everything except his splendid acting, until the calm\r\nvoice of my son recalled me, \"Don't you think, mamma, you had better sit\r\ndown?\" I spent a summer at Narragansett in the same hotel with Mr. Booth\r\nwhen he was resting his weary brain. He had a hooded chair placed in a\r\ncorner of a veranda overlooking the sea, and there alone and in silence\r\nhe spent most of his time. His devoted daughter ministered to him and\r\ncarefully protected him from intrusion. At certain conditions of the\r\ntide the sands of the Narragansett beach emit a weird, faint, singing\r\nsound as the waves recede from them,—moaning, as it were, because they\r\nare left behind. These sounds could not be heard by every ear. Some\r\neager listeners never could hear them. I used to wonder if Edwin Booth\r\ndid, and wish I could ask him what they said to him. I might even tell\r\nhim what they said to me! But his \"Edwina\" watched him jealously, and\r\nwe respected his evident prostration of mind and spirit. His place at\r\ntable was near mine. A moonlight smile would steal over his face when\r\nhis two grandchildren, rosy little tots, came to him at dessert for a\r\nbit of sweet from the hand whose slightest gesture had once been able to\r\nmove a multitude. The next time he was brought vividly before us we were\r\nin a great assembly of his friends, listening to Mr. Parke Godwin,—his\r\nfriend and ours,—as he told of the sun whose rise, whose splendid noon,\r\nand whose setting we were ever to remember.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1882 our old Southern friend, General R. D. Lilley,\r\nvisited New York in the interests of Washington and Lee University.\r\nColonel Mapleson, with Adelina Patti, Nicolini, and the famous\r\n_danseuse_, Cavalassi, had just arrived for a brilliant season at\r\nthe Metropolitan Opera House. General Lilley sent me a letter from\r\nColonel Mapleson,—which lies before me,—in which he offered \"a grand\r\nentertainment to be given about the 3d of March for the endowment of\r\nscholarships in Washington and Lee University, in which entertainment\r\nthe leading artists of the opera would appear,\" and asked for a\r\ncommittee of ladies to act in concert with him.\r\n\r\nGeneral Lilley was in a quandary. He knew no New York ladies. No more\r\ndid I. But finally he won his way into the good graces of the widow\r\nof Governor Dix and mother of the Rev. Morgan Dix, who granted her\r\ndrawing-room for our meetings, and doubtless consulted her own visiting\r\nlist to find patronesses. When, at the general's earnest prayer, I went\r\nover to the first meeting, I found a noble band of women all enthusiasm\r\nover the project. I was a stranger in New York, and but dimly recognized\r\nthe names on the committee with my own: Mrs. John Dix, Mrs. August\r\nBelmont, Mrs. William M. Evarts, Mrs. Francis R. Rives, Mrs. John Jay,\r\nMrs. (Commodore) Vanderbilt, Mrs. Vincenzo Botta, Mrs. Henry Clews,\r\nMrs. James Brown Potter, Mrs. Winfield S. Hancock, and others, about\r\nfifty in all! I can now easily understand that this committee had but\r\nto _will_ a thing, and if it were not accomplished, the fault would not\r\nlie in their lack of potentiality. They had but to say the word. Means,\r\noverflowing means, and generous patronage would be assured.\r\n\r\nColonel Mapleson met with us at our meetings, which Mrs. Dix made\r\ndelightful. We had animated discussions over Mrs. Dix's tea-cups,\r\nand adopted fine resolutions. Patti, the colonel assured us, would\r\nsing,—certainly,—but she needed a vast deal of coaxing and mock\r\nentreaty. Then every day Nicolini—whom she had recently married—wrote\r\nus a letter presenting some difficulty which we must settle. The flowers\r\nwe ordered were beyond compare—to Arditi, the orchestra leader, a large\r\nmusic scroll in white flowers, and upon this ground the first bars of\r\nhis \"Il bacio\" in blue violets. To the witch Cavalassi we voted a floral\r\nslipper, to Colonel Mapleson a silken banner of Stars and Stripes. What,\r\nalas! could we do for Patti? Could _any_thing be enough? At last we sent\r\nfor Colonel Mapleson. \"Ladies,\" he said, \"this will be your easiest\r\ntask. Come to the opera-house with bouquets in your hands or corsage,\r\ntied with cords you have taken from your fans, and throw them to her,\r\nimpulsively. There's nothing she so dotes on as to run all over the\r\nstage and pick up flowers, affect intense surprise at each new bouquet,\r\npress them to her heart, and be utterly overcome at last as she runs\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was done, I learned, for I was not there to see! Colonel\r\nMapleson, however, did not forget me. He sent me the monogram cut in\r\ngold of Washington and Lee University, and I often wear it as a souvenir\r\nof my charming hours with good Mrs. Dix and her friends.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to the city to live, I found that Dr. Dix, his lovely\r\nmother, and many of the ladies of our committee still remembered me.\r\nThis was not the last time we were together in a benevolent enterprise,\r\nnor the last time Patti honored me. Childish as were the little arts\r\nattributed to her by Colonel Mapleson, she could give evidence of a big\r\nwarm heart on occasion!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1877 the leading citizens of Brooklyn invited General Pryor to\r\ndeliver an address at the Academy of Music on Decoration Day. This\r\nwas an opportunity he had long desired, and the invitation was eagerly\r\naccepted. With great zeal and bitterness some of the veterans of the\r\nGrand Army resented the invitation, upon which my husband promptly\r\ndeclined the honor. I do not give the names of the old soldiers—they\r\nhave long ago been forgiven and are fully understood. A heated\r\ncorrespondence followed—one side generous, fraternal feeling, on\r\nthe other the bleeding afresh of old, unhealed wounds. Finally, the\r\ngeneral,—although the charm, the grace, of the compliment was all\r\ngone,—perceiving it would be childish and ungrateful to persist in\r\ndeclining to speak, consented.\r\n\r\nThe interesting nature of the occasion, and the conflict it had aroused,\r\ndrew a very great audience to the Academy of Music. My husband never\r\nneeded notes in speaking, but this time Gordon, in a very large, clear\r\nhand, wrote out his address that he might refresh, if necessary, his\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nIt was not necessary. He was full of fire and enthusiasm, and nobly gave\r\nthe noble sentiments eagerly quoted next day by the _New York Tribune_.\r\nThe closing paragraph strikes no uncertain note. It must have surprised\r\nhis audience:—\r\n\r\n     \"From the vantage ground of a larger observation, with a\r\n     more calm and considerable meditation on the causes and\r\n     conditions of national prosperity, I, for one, cannot resist\r\n     the conclusion that, after all, Providence wisely ordered\r\n     the event, and that it is well for the South itself that it\r\n     was disappointed in its endeavor to establish a separate\r\n     government. Plain is it that, if once established, such\r\n     a government could not have long endured. It was founded\r\n     on principles that must have proved its downfall. It must\r\n     soon have fallen a victim to foreign aggression or domestic\r\n     anarchy. Nor to the reëstablishment of the Union is the\r\n     Confederate soldier any the less reconciled by the destruction\r\n     of slavery. People of the North, history will record that\r\n     slavery fell, not by any efforts of man's will, but by the\r\n     immediate intervention and act of the Almighty Himself.\r\n     And in the anthem of praise ascending to heaven for the\r\n     emancipation of four million human beings, the voice of the\r\n     Confederate soldier mingles its note of devout gratulation.\r\n     And now in the unconquerable strength of freedom we may hope\r\n     that the existence of our blessed Union is limited only\r\n     by the mortality that measures the duration of all human\r\n     institutions. [_Prolonged applause._]\"—_Tribune_, May 31.\r\n\r\n     \"General Roger A. Pryor's Decoration Day address wins golden\r\n     opinions. It was brave, patriotic, and statesman-like. He\r\n     grasps the situation. He does not take much stock in bygones,\r\n     thinks gravestones are made to leave behind and not to tie to,\r\n     and would rather have a live man with average common sense\r\n     than the biggest obituary that was ever written. General\r\n     Pryor is one of the few men who have a to-morrow.\"—_Evening\r\n     Express_, June 12.\r\n\r\nThe _Springfield Republican_, May 31, says:—\r\n\r\n     \"The Grand Army fellows who opposed inviting Roger A. Pryor to\r\n     deliver the address at Brooklyn yesterday probably feel pretty\r\n     well ashamed of themselves by this time. Certainly they would\r\n     have deprived the country of a very desirable speech if they\r\n     had succeeded in preventing his speaking.\"\r\n\r\nBroad as were the views of the ex-rebel at this time, the Southern\r\npapers indorsed him:—\r\n\r\n     \"General Roger A. Pryor's address on Decoration Day, at\r\n     Brooklyn, New York, is quite remarkable. It is very brilliant\r\n     and very eloquent. There is logic, but it is 'logic on fire,'\r\n     as Macaulay said of Lord Chatham. There is a magnificent sweep\r\n     in the sentences, and high and patriotic thought throughout.\r\n     It reminds us in its glow and passion, in its rich and flowing\r\n     rhetoric, and in its exquisite diction of Edmund Burke's\r\n     tremendous speech on the 'Nabob of Arcot's Debts.' We do not\r\n     think any man can accompany the orator, with his kindling,\r\n     intense periods and sonorous, ornate style, with his lofty\r\n     thought and impassioned eloquence, without a responsive thrill\r\n     of emotion and a feeling of pride that this master of speech\r\n     is a Southron.\"\r\n\r\n                                       —_Wilmington_ (N. C.) _Star_.\r\n\r\n     \"The address of General Roger A. Pryor delivered on Decoration\r\n     Day at Brooklyn, N. Y., is a brilliant production. Like\r\n     everything emanating from him, it is full of fine thought and\r\n     fine sentiment, with a sweeping array of glowing genius, all\r\n     clothed in a diction simple, pure, and as opposite as if the\r\n     idea and language had been born together from a brain entirely\r\n     original and independent in its conceptions. The spirit of the\r\n     address, too, is national, catholic, patriotic, and grandly\r\n     American from beginning to end.\r\n\r\n     \"Pryor is a man of splendid parts, and Virginia has reason to\r\n     be proud of him.\"—(Richmond, Va.)\r\n\r\nThe _Richmond Whig_ paid a handsome tribute:—\r\n\r\n     \"Roger A. Pryor is a man of resplendent genius. He has\r\n     high culture, too, and he is far from being only an orator\r\n     to excite the passions, to win applause, and to elicit\r\n     admiration. He has comprehensiveness of brain, coupled with an\r\n     extraordinary capacity for the nicest dialectics. As a writer\r\n     or speaker, he should be invited to no second seat anywhere.\r\n     He is more like William Wirt, perhaps, than any other of the\r\n     gifted men of this country. And the day is not distant when,\r\n     if he goes into politics again, he will have a national name\r\n     as familiar to the North as, when he was a much younger man,\r\n     it was to the Southern people.\r\n\r\n     \"We have no doubt he will deliver a speech of unsurpassed\r\n     beauty and eloquence on Decoration Day in Brooklyn.\"\r\n\r\nThese are but representative quotations. The whole country was ready to\r\napplaud the speech. It was a fitting close to the first twelve years of\r\nour life of trial and probation. The sweetest praise of all came in a\r\nletter from America's great preacher, Richard S. Storrs:—\r\n\r\n                                        \"80 PIERPONT STREET,\r\n                                               \"BROOKLYN, N.

I sympathize, in\r\n     fullest measure, with the delighted enthusiasm with which\r\n     my wife and daughter spoke of the address after hearing it\r\n     last evening, and am only more sorry than before that my\r\n     unlucky and imperative engagement with the Historical Society\r\n     Committee and Board forbade me to enjoy the splendid eloquence\r\n     of utterance which they described to me. I do not see how\r\n     you could possibly have treated the theme which the occasion\r\n     presented more delicately or more grandly—with a finer touch,\r\n     or a more complete mastery of all its proper relations and\r\n     suggestions.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a great address, and must have a wide and great effect.\r\n     I only wish that all the papers would give it in its full\r\n     extent.\r\n\r\n     \"I am faithfully and with great regard,\r\n\r\n                                                 \"Yours,\r\n                                                     \"R. S. STORRS.\"\r\n\r\nThis address, which has been handsomely bound by the Brooklyn committee,\r\nwas followed by invitations all over the country to speak—even from\r\nthe Gospel Tent. But, unhappily, honor does not fill the basket, nor\r\nwarm the body, nor pay the rent, nor satisfy the tax-gatherer. It is a\r\nnice, nice thing to have,—there's no use denying it,—but I think my dear\r\ngeneral would have given it all, every bit, for one good, remunerative\r\nlaw case.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GENERAL HANCOCK.]\r\n\r\nFirmly fortified, as he persuaded himself, against ever again indulging\r\nin the fascinations of politics, his admiration for his old foe at\r\nSharpsburg drew him into the Hancock campaign.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hancock, the hero of Gettysburg and Antietam, was worth every\r\neffort of every Democrat in the country. He was a superb man in every\r\nrespect, and we soon became his ardent friends. His wife was a most\r\ndear, beautiful woman, whom I learned to love. So charming was their\r\nsimple home on Governors Island, I could have brought myself to the\r\npoint of begging the government—that had taken so much from me—to grant\r\nme a little corner to live near them and their two delightful friends,\r\nGeneral James Fry and his wife.\r\n\r\nAt General Hancock's I spent much time, and while my general consulted\r\nwith him on political matters, Mrs. Hancock and I would, when we could\r\nescape from the crowd, sympathize with each other as only stricken\r\nmothers can sympathize. She had just lost her beautiful Ada—and small\r\nindeed seemed the honors of this world to her.\r\n\r\nMy general made a fine speech for General Hancock, which was praised by\r\nthe press as generously as the Decoration Day speech. It was understood\r\nthat he would be Attorney-General in case of Hancock's election. We\r\nknow the result; and I must confess that as the election returns were\r\nreported to us, I quite abandoned myself to disappointment. From my\r\nwindow next morning I could see another Democratic mourner, and in\r\norder to signal to her my state of mind, I hung a black shawl which\r\nI had on at the moment out of the window. Early on the day after the\r\nelection I went with my daughter Gordon across the ferry to Governor's\r\nIsland to assure myself of the welfare of my friends. It was a raw\r\nday in November, and snow was falling. We were the only passengers on\r\nthe boat, with the exception of two serious-looking women who carried\r\na large paper box between them. \"Funeral flowers,\" suggested Gordon.\r\nUpon arriving, we walked up to General Hancock's house, and at the\r\ndoor perceived our fellow-passengers had followed us. They entered\r\nwith us, and in order to give them the right of way in case they were\r\ncome on appointment, Gordon and I passed on to the back parlor, leaving\r\nthem in the front room. Presently we heard General Hancock accost them\r\ncourteously, whereupon they arose and explained, with much solemnity,\r\ntheir errand. \"General, for some time past we have been engaged in\r\npreparing a testimonial for you, with the assistance of your many\r\nadmirers. Here, sir, is an autograph quilt,\"—unfolding an ample and\r\nfearful object,—\"and upon it there are autographs of our celebrated men:\r\nGeneral Grant is here, Mr. Hayes is here, Mr. Garfield is here!\"—General\r\nHancock interrupted, \"But—ladies! Thanking you for your kindness, let\r\nme inform you I have been defeated—your offering was probably designed\r\nfor the elected President.\" With warm vehemence they both protested:\r\n\"Oh, _no, no_, General! We are Democrats! No, _sir!_ No Republican is\r\never going to sleep under _this_ quilt if we can help it!\" \"Ah, well,\r\nthen,\" said the general, \"I suppose I can do nothing more than thank\r\nyou. Yes, I can call Mrs. Hancock. She will say how much we appreciate\r\nyour kindness.\"\r\n\r\nPassing through the back parlor, he espied us. \"Oh, Mrs. Pryor! _Hang it\r\nall!_\" he ruefully exclaimed, as he went aloft. When Mrs. Hancock took\r\ncharge of the situation, he returned to us.\r\n\r\n\"And so the general has sent you over to represent him at the funeral!\r\nTell him I am all right; but by the bye, how many people came over with\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those two,\" indicating the party now descanting to Mrs. Hancock upon\r\nthe fine collection of autographs.\r\n\r\n\"Had the result been different, a fleet could not have brought them all!\r\nHowever, the canes are coming in as well as the quilts. We shall not\r\nlack for fire-wood this winter, nor for covering.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hancock was soon relieved of her kind friends, and both she and\r\nthe general accompanied us on a \"little walk\" proposed by him. \"I shall\r\nnot be lonely here,\" he told us; \"a new ship comes in sight every day;\r\nand I've plenty to do. I must have all these leaves swept up, too. I'm\r\na happier man than Garfield this day. Only,\" he added sadly, \"I cannot\r\nreward my friends.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hancock opened the gate of her little garden and gathered a\r\nsouvenir posy for Gordon, and so we parted from the two—so great, so\r\ndignified in the hour of defeat.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home, it was well I had a _douceur_ for my general.\r\nHe held in his hand the _New York Tribune_ of the day, and pointed\r\nan indignant finger to a communication in which the public was warned\r\nagainst the incendiary principles of \"persons in the family of a noted\r\nSouthern lawyer, now resident on Brooklyn Heights, who had, in the\r\nmoment of the nation's rejoicing, displayed in a window a piratical\r\nflag, deep-bordered and ominous.\" My poor little jest with my neighbor!\r\nMy humble black shawl!\r\n\r\nHaving had an invitation to lunch with Mrs. Grant at the Fifth Avenue\r\nHotel next day, I thought it wise, as well as agreeable, to accept,\r\nseeing I had been published as a suspicious character. I needed\r\nRepublican support.\r\n\r\nI told Mrs. Grant of my interview with General Hancock. \"Nice fellow!\r\nNice fellow!\" she exclaimed with feeling. \"You know I'm a Democrat,\"\r\nshe said. \"What's more, I'm _Secesh_, particularly as the Republicans\r\nwouldn't nominate Ulysses for a third term.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but,\" said I, \"you mustn't forget the story of the Fisherman and\r\nthe Flounder.\"\r\n\r\nShe had never heard the story of Dame Isabel, the fisherman's ambitious\r\nwife, and laughed heartily over the application to herself. \"All the\r\nsame,\" she protested, \"I was not unreasonable—I didn't wish to be Lord\r\nof the spheres—only wife of the President of one country.\"\r\n\r\nA short time before this the (Massachusetts) _Springfield Republican_\r\nwas kind enough to lend a helping hand, in the guise of a kind word to\r\nmy dear general, which was quoted by the _New York Times_, January 22,\r\n1878. That I should have preserved it so many years, fully asserts my\r\nappreciation of the paper's kindness.\r\n\r\n     \"The New York correspondent of the _Springfield_\r\n     (Massachusetts) _Republican_ writes: 'Roger Pryor is pegging\r\n     away very quietly in his law office, with increasing business,\r\n     though it is not of a very conspicuous character nor very\r\n     remunerative, I imagine, for he does a great deal of work\r\n     for poor people; but he sticks so closely to his business\r\n     that comparatively few people know that he is here, and one\r\n     of the most characteristic representatives of the Southern\r\n     statesman. He is in constant communication with leading\r\n     Southern men, and knows the true inwardness of the Southern\r\n     feeling and policy in regard to \"scaling\" the state debts. He\r\n     is an intense anti-repudiationist, and the very thought of a\r\n     thing so dishonorable makes him shiver with rage. But he is\r\n     fully persuaded that the Southern people are determined to\r\n     cut down their obligations materially, and throw overboard\r\n     the carpet-bag debts altogether, if possible. He thinks that\r\n     when the federal government required the Southern people to\r\n     repudiate their Confederate war debts, it taught them a lesson\r\n     in repudiation which they are now disposed to better. The\r\n     public men of the South have not done their duty in frowning\r\n     down this feeling and teaching the people a better policy,\r\n     to say nothing of honesty. Pryor is the soul of honor, is\r\n     chock full of the old-fashioned Virginia chivalric sentiment,\r\n     and altogether too high-minded and large-thoughted to mix\r\n     himself with our local politics. And all the democrats who\r\n     know him and are not politicians agree that he ought to be in\r\n     Congress.'\"\r\n\r\nHe was ardently opposed to repudiation, and has often expressed\r\nindignation that the South was required to repudiate its Confederate\r\nwar debts. As to his being in Congress, he was offered a few years later\r\nthe nomination by Tammany, which would have meant sure election—but how\r\ncould he pay the assessment demanded by that organization? Because he\r\ncould not, he was compelled to decline the honor of going back to his\r\nold seat from the state of his adoption.\r\n\r\nMrs. Grant did me the honor to invite me to a reception she was giving\r\n\"to meet General and Mrs. Sheridan.\" \"Of course you'll not go,\" my\r\nhusband suggested. \"How can you meet General Sheridan?\" \"Why not?\" I\r\nsaid. \"If he can stand it, I can.\"\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: GENERAL SHERIDAN.]\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Grant presented me, the little general—he was shorter than\r\nI—was at first too much astonished for speech. He had hardly supposed\r\nwhen he parted from me in the house where, in order that he might escape\r\nannoyance, I had been kept by him literally in durance vile, that our\r\nnext meeting would be in the drawing-rooms of the wife of his commander.\r\nI gave him time to realize all this, and then I asked him gently, \"Do\r\nyou remember me, General Sheridan?\"\r\n\r\nIn a moment both hands grasped mine. \"Indeed, indeed I do, dear lady—and\r\nI am grateful to Mrs. Grant for giving me this opportunity to tell you\r\nthat no man in this country more cordially rejoices at General Pryor's\r\nsuccess than I do.\" He then recalled Lucy, and bantered her on having\r\ngrown \"taller than General Sheridan.\" But the crowd pressed in, and\r\nthere was no time for more reminiscences of those terrible ten days in\r\nPetersburg. Mrs. Grant called to W. W. Story and bade him take care of\r\nme. \"She has never seen Ulysse!\" she exclaimed. \"Keep her until six\r\no'clock. He promised me to come then.\" Mr. Story, with his beautiful\r\nclassic face,—nobody could be as charming,—found a great many delightful\r\nthings to say to us, and when our hostess claimed us, General Grant\r\nhaving arrived, he gallantly laid his hand upon his heart and said: \"I\r\nshall not forget you! You and your daughter are photographed here.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I had visited Mrs. Grant, I had never seen the general. True, I\r\nhad received many emphatic messages from him, but he had then required\r\nno answer. I began to wonder what I should find to say to him—to plan\r\nsomething very gentle and pleasing in return for his fire and brimstone.\r\nI remembered that he had once told one of my friends that he often\r\nregretted he had never studied medicine instead of military tactics.\r\nClearly, if it could be brought about by a little skilful management,\r\nno more fitting response to the sulphurous remarks he had made to me at\r\nPetersburg could be imagined than something akin to the healing art.\r\n\r\n\"This is Ulysse, Mrs. Pryor,\" said Mrs. Grant, and my hour had come.\r\nHe stood silent, throwing, after the manner of men, the burden of\r\nconversation upon the woman before him. Every idea forsook me! I did\r\nnot, like Heine in the presence of Goethe, remark upon the excellent\r\nflavor of the plums at Jena, but I found nothing better to say than \"How\r\nis it, General, that you permit Mrs. Grant to call you Ulysse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps from imitation,\" he replied; \"I know a general whose wife calls\r\nhim Roger.\"\r\n\r\nHe was so simple, so kind, that everything went easily after this. I\r\ncould not stifle the recollection of all I had suffered at his hands,\r\nbut I had something for which to thank him. We had been invited to\r\naccompany him in his private car when he went to Hartford to attend the\r\nsecond marriage of Mr. John Russell Young. All my life I have been so\r\nmalapropos as to welcome with tears the bride coming to take the place\r\nof a wife whom I had loved, and this time the tears had been on the\r\nwedding day so abundant I was in no condition to go with General Grant.\r\nMy youngest school-girl daughter took my place. At every stop on the\r\nroad crowds collected to see General Grant, and, with my Fanny on his\r\narm, he went out on the platform to return the greeting. Now I could\r\ntell him of her pride in the occasion. \"The pride was all mine,\" he\r\nsaid; \"an old fellow with such a beautiful girl on his arm had something\r\nto be proud of.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a very beautiful girl near us,\" I said to Mrs. Grant, \"the\r\ndark-eyed lady in rose moire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's Fred's wife,\" she answered. \"Yes, she is beautiful, and\r\nwe are all proud of her;\" adding, with a humorous expression, \"It has\r\nalways been hard for me—this admiration of beauty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not care for beauty?\" I asked. \"Care for it? I worship it! I\r\nused to cry when I was a little girl because I was so ugly. 'Never mind,\r\nJulia,' my dear mother would say, 'you can be my good little girl.' I\r\nused to wish I could ever once be called her 'pretty little girl.'\"\r\n\r\nBut no face as thoroughly kind and good as hers can ever be plain. After\r\nall, is it ever the prettiest faces that are nearest our hearts? Having\r\nknown Mrs. Grant for many years, I can truly say I have seen no woman\r\nso free from ostentation or affectation. Kindness of heart, genuine,\r\nsincere desire to make others happy, patience in adversity,—these are\r\nthe traits of mind, manner, and heart that won for her so many warm\r\nfriends. No other American woman has ever been so much fêted and honored\r\nas she. Most of us have had our little hour—a part of the world we\r\nlive in has at one time or another turned upon us eyes of applauding\r\naffection, but she stood beside her husband at every foreign court in\r\nEurope, presiding on occasions when he held private audience with the\r\ngreatest potentates of the world. Nothing seemed to mar her perfect\r\nsimplicity—her admirable self-forgetfulness. I was engaged one day in\r\ntaking a frugal luncheon—tea, toast, a dozen oysters—in my tiny basement\r\ndining-room, when Mrs. Grant's card was handed me.\r\n\r\nRunning upstairs and saying to my daughter, \"Mrs. Grant must have a cup\r\nof tea,\" I was surprised to find the general seated near the door. After\r\nthe greeting, he said gravely, \"I don't see why I can't have a cup of\r\ntea as well as Mrs. Grant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will send it to you, General! The doorway on the stair is too low\r\nfor you to go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be pretty low,\" he replied; \"I've a mind to try it. I've\r\nstooped my head for less.\"\r\n\r\nWe divided the dozen oysters among us, brewed more tea, made more\r\ntoast and enjoyed the meal—the general inquiring kindly of news from my\r\nhusband, who was in England, having been sent by the Irish-Americans to\r\nsee what could be done for O'Donnell, the Irish prisoner.\r\n\r\nAfter there was no more to be expected at the lunch table, we adjourned\r\nto the library and I produced the met bullets my boys had found at\r\nCottage Farm.\r\n\r\nHe laid it on the palm of his hand and looked at it long and earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"See, General,\" I said, \"the bullets are welded together so as to form\r\na perfect horseshoe—a charm to keep away witches and evil spirits.\"\r\n\r\nBut the general was not interested in amulets, charms, or evil spirits.\r\nAfter regarding it silently for a moment, he remarked:—\r\n\r\n\"Those are minie balls, shot from rifles of equal caliber. And they\r\nmet precisely equidistant to a hair. This is very interesting, but it\r\nis not the only one in the world. I have seen one other, picked up at\r\nVicksburg. Where was this found, and when?\" he asked, as he handed the\r\nrelic back to me. \"At Petersburg, possibly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered; \"but not when you were shelling the city. It was\r\npicked up on our farm after the last fight.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a humorous twinkle in his eye. \"Now look here,\" he\r\nsaid, \"don't you go about telling people I shelled Petersburg.\"\r\n\r\nA short time before his death, just before he was taken to Mount\r\nMcGregor, he dictated a note to me, sending his kind regards to my\r\ngeneral, and saying he remembered with pleasure his talk with me over\r\na cup of tea.\r\n\r\nThere is something very touching in all this as I remember it now—his\r\nillness so bravely borne. His death occurred not very long afterward.\r\nNo widow ever mourned more tenderly than did Mrs. Grant. I saw her\r\nonly once before she went to sleep beside him in the marble temple\r\non the riverside, and she touched me by her patient demeanor. I had a\r\nfriend very close to her in her later days to whom she loved to talk of\r\nher general,—when they met, how he proposed to her. They were riding\r\ntogether, crossing a rough place in the road. Her horse stumbled and\r\nthrew her. The general caught her in his arms and said he was \"glad to\r\nsafeguard her then, and would be proud to do so to the end.\" She said\r\nwhen he came on his wooing there were members of her family who looked\r\naskance at the undersized chap. \"Nothing of him but eyes and epaulets,\"\r\nLongstreet was quoted as saying of him one evening at a tea-and-toast\r\neuchre party. This seems to have been the opinion of some of Julia\r\nDent's people, but not of her far-seeing mother, to whom the maiden's\r\ndismay was confided. \"Julia, you should marry that young officer, say\r\nwhat they will about his clumsiness and awkward ways! He is far above\r\nany of the young fellows who come here. He will one day be President of\r\nthe United States.\"\r\n\r\nMy sisters at the South would, in these early days, have resented\r\nthese words of appreciation of General and Mrs. Grant. Not one iota the\r\nless did my allegiance fail to _my_ dear commander in his modest tomb,\r\nguarded perpetually night and day by a son of Virginia, because I could\r\nperceive the tender side, the heroic side, of a foeman worthy of his\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October, 1883, General Pryor was sent to England, as counsel to\r\ndefend Patrick O'Donnell, who had been indicted for the murder of James\r\nCarey, and was now imprisoned in London. Carey had been one of the\r\nleaders of the Irish \"Invincibles\" in 1881, and was an accomplice in the\r\nassassination of Mr. T. H. Burke and Lord Frederick Cavendish in Phœnix\r\nPark. He was arrested on January 13, 1883, and turned queen's evidence.\r\nIn order to escape the vengeance of the \"Invincibles,\" he was secretly\r\nshipped for the Cape under the name of \"Power.\" His plan of escape was\r\ndiscovered, and he was secretly followed by Patrick O'Donnell, who shot\r\nhim before the vessel reached its destination.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner was an American citizen, and it was thought proper by\r\nsome of his personal friends to have American counsel assist the local\r\nlawyers in his defence. There was no political signification in General\r\nPryor's being retained. He was aware that objection would be urged\r\nagainst his appearance in an English court. There was no precedent for\r\nhis encouragement. The case of Judah P. Benjamin did not apply. Mr.\r\nBenjamin had been born a British subject and had \"eaten his dinners\" at\r\nthe Temple. Only by an act of courtesy on the part of the judge could\r\nGeneral Pryor hope for a hearing. He wrote me, _en route_, on board the\r\n_Scythia_, October 17:—\r\n\r\n     \"An Irish barrister on board has been my most constant\r\n     companion,—a very intelligent gentleman is he,—and I am\r\n     assured by him that I cannot be admitted to appear in Court,\r\n     the rule of Court excluding from practice any but members of\r\n     the Bar. This does not surprise me. I can be usefully employed\r\n     in consultation and suggestion. I have industriously read in\r\n     the law of homicide, and on those topics I consider myself an\r\n     expert.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the newspapers were interested in the novel experiment of\r\nsending an American lawyer to defend an American citizen in England, and\r\nsearching for some hidden reason for the selection of General Pryor.\r\n\"Simply because of his daring spirit,\" said one. \"He will speak out\r\nas another would hesitate to speak.\" \"Not so,\" said the editor of the\r\n_Irish World_; \"General Pryor was selected on account of his ability\r\nas a lawyer. I know of no man who can better represent the American\r\nbar. O'Donnell is an American citizen, and General Pryor will defend\r\nhim as an American citizen.\" A would-be wit in England replied, \"He\r\nwas selected because he was _prior_ to all others—take notice—_this is\r\nregistered_.\"\r\n\r\nThe _New York Times_, November 8, 1883, reminds the public that \"an\r\nEnglish barrister would have no standing in an American court, except\r\nby a stretch of courtesy which would be rather violent. To give audience\r\nin court to a foreign counsel would be a great novelty in any country.\"\r\n\r\nThe _London Times_ commented on the matter and said, \"It is probable\r\nthat Mr. Pryor will be permitted to give the accused man all possible\r\nassistance short of taking a public part in the conduct of the case.\"\r\nChief Justice Coleridge, recently returned from this country, where\r\nhe had been the recipient of many kindly courtesies, was at once\r\ninterested, and took an early opportunity to consult leading English\r\njurists regarding certain amendments in the form of procedure in\r\nthe courts, the admission of foreign lawyers being one of the points\r\ndiscussed. A correspondent of the _Brooklyn Eagle_ visited my husband\r\nin England and wrote to the paper:—\r\n\r\n     \"I called on General Pryor this morning. He is snugly housed\r\n     at the Craven Hotel in Craven Street, hard by Charing Cross\r\n     and within a minute's walk of the American Exchange. I\r\n     found him immersed in papers relating to the case, but with\r\n     sufficient leisure to greet a fellow-countryman (and an old\r\n     client _en passant_) with his customary courtesy.\r\n\r\n     \"Legally, the general has had a hard time of it here,—of\r\n     which more anon,—but socially he has been the recipient of\r\n     extraordinary marks of English favor. His romantic career\r\n     as a soldier and as a lawyer is known to everybody, and\r\n     invitations to club breakfasts and the dinner-tables of great\r\n     men have poured in upon him. So far, he has accepted none of\r\n     these, having been entirely preoccupied by the preparation\r\n     of O'Donnell's defence, which, as I understand from other\r\n     sources, is largely General Pryor's. Originally it was\r\n     understood that the trial should occur in October, but it has\r\n     been postponed again and again, and the general's great regret\r\n     is that he was not able to get back to vote.\r\n\r\n     \"Speaking to me on this subject to-day, a prominent member of\r\n     the English bar said: 'My dear fellow, General Pryor is not\r\n     an exception to the rule. He is simply a prominent instance\r\n     of its operation. You may not be aware that neither a Scotch\r\n     nor an Irish barrister is allowed to plead in English courts.\r\n     If we were to make any exception at all, it would certainly\r\n     be made in favor of General Pryor, who is known to and liked\r\n     by us all.'\r\n\r\n     \"'But,' I asked, 'how about his appearance in court as a\r\n     matter of courtesy?'\r\n\r\n     \"'There is no such thing possible, and not even the judge\r\n     has power to extend it. The Benchers of the Inns are the\r\n     authority, and even the objection of a single barrister would\r\n     be fatal.'\"\r\n\r\nThe English papers were, as a class, against his appearance. The _St.\r\nJames Gazette_ had long articles on the subject, in one of which the\r\nquestion is thus settled:—\r\n\r\n     \"The case of American counsel claiming audience in a criminal\r\n     trial arousing passionate political interest in certain\r\n     circles is admirably calculated to demonstrate the excellence\r\n     of the rule which the Irish-Americans were anxious to have\r\n     broken,—as they supposed in their interests. The only motive\r\n     which O'Donnell could have for wishing (if he does wish it) to\r\n     be heard through foreign counsel would be that that counsel\r\n     should say or do something which English counsel cannot say\r\n     or do. For, however great General Pryor's fame may be in his\r\n     own country, we have no reason to suppose that he is gifted\r\n     with eloquence or persuasive powers so remarkable that he\r\n     might be relied upon to move the hearts of an Old Bailey jury\r\n     impervious to the tried abilities of Mr. Charles Russell and\r\n     the earnest fluency of Mr. A. M. Sullivan. Let us consider,\r\n     then, what it is which these gentlemen could not do, and\r\n     General Pryor, if he got the chance, could do. The principal\r\n     thing is that he could more or less defy the judge, and\r\n     instigate the jury to override the law or take a wrong view\r\n     of the evidence.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Gazette_ little knew the manner of man under discussion. \"Defy the\r\nlaw,\" indeed! He wrote me October 25:—\r\n\r\n     \"As I have informed you, a rule of the Bar excludes any but\r\n     an English barrister from appearing professionally in the\r\n     courts. I will not allow a motion to be made that I be heard\r\n     in the case, for I do not choose to solicit a favor, nor\r\n     to incur the hazard of a rebuff, nor to expose the American\r\n     Bar to the incivility which would be involved in rejecting\r\n     such an application from one of its members. My presence,\r\n     however, is not without good effect, nor have my services\r\n     been unimportant. Indeed, I may say to you that already I have\r\n     rendered inestimable service to my client.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sir Charles Russell, afterward Lord Chief Justice of England,\r\nMr. Sullivan and Mr. Guy, of the British bar, and Roger A. Pryor, of the\r\nAmerican bar, worked faithfully, earnestly, and zealously, step by step,\r\nfor the unfortunate prisoner. O'Donnell was a poor, ignorant man, who\r\ncould not write his own name. In this country he had been a teamster in\r\nthe Federal army during the Civil War. For a long time his countryman\r\nwho had come so far to help him was not allowed to see him. Finally,\r\nthis much was granted—and of great comfort to the doomed man were the\r\nsympathetic visits of my tender-hearted husband. His trial ended as\r\neverybody knew it must.\r\n\r\nGeneral Pryor felt keenly the embarrassment of his position, but before\r\nhe left England nearly every club was open to him, and many dinners\r\ngiven in his honor by Lord Russell, members of the bar, Mr. Justin\r\nMcCarthy and other literary men in London.\r\n\r\n     \"At the royal geographical dinner,\" he writes, \"I sat beside\r\n     Lord Houghton, and opposite Lord Aberdeen, with both of whom I\r\n     had pleasant talk. Other eminent men were there. Invitations\r\n     followed which I must decline, infinitely to my regret, but\r\n     I cannot neglect the business on which I came. A dinner is\r\n     offered me in Dublin. Last evening, however, I was glad to\r\n     dine with Charles Russell, Q.C., and Sunday I drive with\r\n     him to Richmond. He pays me every possible attention, and I\r\n     can see relies upon me in the conduct of the case. I live as\r\n     retired as possible. My clients cannot suspect me of yielding\r\n     to British blandishments! I have had interesting interviews\r\n     with my poor client, in compliance with his urgent entreaty.\r\n     He was very grateful to me and cheered by my presence.\"\r\n\r\nHe received marked kindness from Dr. Rae, the Arctic explorer, who had\r\nmade important discoveries in King William's Land and found traces of\r\nSir John Franklin; also in 1864 had made a telegraphic survey across\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. Dr. Rae gave several delightful dinners to my\r\nhusband, inviting him to meet Huxley, Sir John Lubbock, and sundry\r\nnotable chemists and inventors. \"Come to us Saturday at half-past\r\nseven,\" he wrote from Kensington, \"a handsome [_sic_] should bring you\r\nin a little over half an hour if the beast is good.\" At Dr. Rae's he\r\nmet Mathilde Blind, \"a brilliant woman, a Jewess; and Justin McCarthy,\r\na shy, silent man, spectacled and quite like a professor.\" Dining at\r\nthe Café Royal, \"who should come in and sit opposite to us but the\r\nBaroness Burdett-Coutts and her spouse. She is surprisingly juvenile in\r\nappearance—not at all as she has been represented. Her voice is quite\r\ngirlish, and she moves with wonderful agility,\" etc.\r\n\r\nHe also met Miss Shaw, who was conducting a bevy of American girls\r\nfor a tour of European travel. Some _contretemps_ arose which made\r\nher grateful for his conduct and assistance. The particular young lady\r\nwhom he had the honor of escorting and assisting was Miss Stanton. It\r\nsuddenly occurred to him that this might be the daughter of his old\r\nenemy, Edwin M. Stanton. The young lady innocently answered his question\r\naffirmatively. She had been the identical baby girl that, eighteen\r\nyears before, Stanton had held in his arms as he declared, \"Pryor shall\r\nbe hanged!\" My general might have done several things: he might have\r\nleft her alone in a London street to the mercy of ruffians; he might\r\nhave used, in a dark corner, the tiny pistol he carried; he might have\r\ndrowned her in the Thames; he might have surprised her by increased\r\ndevotion and care for her comfort. He chose the last, heaping coals of\r\nfire upon her unconscious head!\r\n\r\nBefore he returned he visited places peculiarly interesting to him as\r\na scholar, all of which he described to me charmingly. As far as in\r\nhim lay he trod the paths, so sacred to him, once trod by the lumbering\r\nfeet of the one Englishman he adores above all others, Dr. Sam Johnson:\r\nsitting at the desk where he wrote his dictionary and marvelling at the\r\nmeanness of the desk, looking out of his windows, walking with him and\r\nwith Boswell along the familiar streets. He also stood on the spot where\r\nBlackstone delivered his immortal lectures, and on the very spot where\r\nLatimer and Cranmer suffered,—the students at that moment playing near\r\nit a vigorous game of football,—all this, and much more, so natural in\r\na scholar visiting for the first time the London of which he knew every\r\nspot haunted by the great spirits of the literary world.\r\n\r\nAfter he returned home, he received a long letter from Lord Russell,\r\ntelling him that he (Russell) had been sharply criticised for the\r\nconduct of O'Donnell's case, and accused of having managed it in a\r\nnegligent and lukewarm manner. He wished his American colleague's candid\r\nopinion on the subject, and also requested his photograph, adding, \"I\r\nam sending you mine.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Pryor answered him cordially and was glad he could say,\r\n\"I consider that you defended O'Donnell with the utmost zeal and\r\nenthusiasm, and with consummate skill!\" It seems the queen's counsel was\r\nsensitive as well as able. He was afterwards made Lord Chief Justice of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circle that finally gathered around the fireside in the little\r\nlibrary at 157 Willow Street was long remembered by some of the men who\r\nmade it brilliant. John G. Saxe, whom we had known in Washington, was\r\none of these men. Thither also came the Southern author, William Gilmore\r\nSimms. I remember one evening spent in our tiny library with Mr. Simms,\r\nJohn R. Thompson, and General Charles Jones, when the trio of literary\r\nmen told stories,—not war stories,—ghost stories. Mr. Thompson recalled\r\na ghost I had known of myself and feared when a child,—the ghost of\r\nthe University of Virginia that announced its coming by a sudden wind\r\nbursting open the doors, passed through the room, and walked off across\r\nthe lawn to the mountains. His deep foot-tracks could be discerned in\r\nthe soft sod, and with snow on the ground these deep tracks could be\r\nseen to grow under his invisible feet as he strode onward. Well do I\r\nremember nights when this ghost \"walked.\" But General Jones had a better\r\nstory. His was a visible ghost, an old lady, whose contested will he was\r\nreading one night, who appeared at the challenged point, looked at him\r\nsolemnly, and then vanished! Mr. Simms positively declined to mention\r\nhis own private ghost after these two thrilling visitations.\r\n\r\nWe had an interesting visit from Percy Greg, son of the English author.\r\nMr. Greg brought as a present to my general the proof-sheets of his\r\nfather's \"Warnings of Cassandra,\" in which my husband discovered an\r\nerror; and according to his lifelong belief that all errors in the\r\nEnglish language are crimes which must be corrected, he proceeded to\r\nenlighten Mr. Greg. \"Your father has made a mistake—a slight one—which\r\nhe can correct in the next edition. He uses the word 'internecine' where\r\nhe clearly means 'intestine.'\" Our guest dropped his under jaw, stared,\r\nand reddened. An American correcting an Englishman's English! He had,\r\nI know, respect for my husband's courage, but he had not expected rebel\r\nguns to be turned on him in this manner.\r\n\r\n     \"This was a length, I trow,\r\n     A rebel's daring could not go,\"\r\n\r\nif I may paraphrase Gilbert in the Bab Ballads!\r\n\r\nBut we had more eminent guests than these,—the divines of the City of\r\nChurches, and her learned judges. Foremost and most cordial of all were\r\nthe old generals of the Grand Army of the Republic: General Hancock,\r\nGeneral James Fry, General Slocum, General Grant, General Tracy—a\r\nsometime foe in field and forum; and later General Sherman, General\r\nFitz-John Porter, General Butterfield, and General McClellan were added\r\nto our list of friends.\r\n\r\nAmong my husband's earliest clients was General Benjamin F. Butler,\r\nwho employed him to defend his son-in-law, Hon. Adelbert Ames, when the\r\nlatter was impeached by the state of Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn the families of these distinguished men we soon found friends, and\r\nto these were added many others. Brooklyn was noted for its refined and\r\ncultivated society, and on Brooklyn Heights many of its most prominent\r\ncitizens lived, men whose names are not yet forgotten: Professor and\r\nMrs. Eaton, our first and dearest friends; Mr. Abbot Low,—whose splendid\r\nmonument is the library of Columbia University,—his charming wife and\r\ndaughters and his accomplished sons, one of whom was late President of\r\nColumbia University and mayor of New York; Dr. Henry van Dyke, whose\r\nname is famous in two continents as scholar, writer, and orator of\r\nhigh distinction; John Roebling, the brilliant engineer, architect, and\r\nbuilder of the great Brooklyn Bridge, whose beautiful wife was sister\r\nof our friend, General Warren; the Hon. S. B. Chittenden and his wife,\r\na grand dame of the old school; the family of our minister to the Court\r\nof St. James, Mr. Pierrepont; Mr. and Mrs. Alanson Trask, foremost in\r\nall good works; Mr. Henry K. Sheldon, who gave artistic musicals; Mrs.\r\nJohn Bullard, the patroness of art and leader in society; Mr. and Mrs.\r\nAllen, who gave a lovely daughter to be the wife of Dr. Holbrook Curtis;\r\nMr. and Mrs. George L. Nichols, with a most dear and charming family of\r\nsons and daughters; one known to the world to-day—at home and abroad—as\r\nKatrina Trask, the brilliant author, poet, and accomplished chatelaine;\r\nMrs. Alice Morse Earle, now one of America's charming writers; Mrs.\r\nLouise Chandler Moulton; and Grace Denio Litchfield, then a beautiful\r\nyoung lady, and now a gifted author. These are but a representative\r\nfew of the interesting men and women who were kind enough to visit\r\nus. A multitude of lovely young girls gathered around my school-girl\r\ndaughters; and when all the army of men turned out on New Year's Day\r\nto observe—as they did religiously—the old-time custom of making calls,\r\nthe little house on Willow Street showed symptoms of bursting!\r\n\r\nAll of these were Northern people, and many of them from New\r\nEngland,—the New England we had been taught to regard as the stronghold\r\nof our enemies. There was not a Southern-born man or woman among them.\r\nWe had always considered the New Englander upright, narrow, and thorny!\r\nTransplanted to Brooklyn, we found him upright indeed, but as harmless\r\nas a thornless rose.\r\n\r\nMany of these delightful people in time crossed the East River and\r\npitched their tents in New York—and many have crossed the river that\r\nflows close to the feet of all of us; and so I imagine society in\r\nwhat is now known as the Borough of Brooklyn has formed new systems\r\nrevolving around new suns. I sometimes read the old names in the society\r\ncolumns of the Brooklyn journals, and the old pictures rise before me,\r\ndelightful and never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe time had now come, however, when it was imperative for General Pryor\r\nto live in New York, the city where he had commenced his work and had\r\nalways kept his office. The first of May found us in a small house on\r\n33d Street.\r\n\r\nA letter written by me in the following August gives my opinion of New\r\nYork as a summer resort.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR AGNES:—\r\n\r\n     \"The colonel declares he means to bring you to New York, and\r\n     wishes me to give you my own impressions of this place. Well,\r\n     all I have to say is 'pray that your flight be not in summer!'\r\n     Anything like the heat and desolation of this town in summer\r\n     cannot be imagined. Everybody leaves it. I am living in a tiny\r\n     house in the heart of the city—and a very hard heart it is!\r\n     On one side of me is the rear of a great hotel, its kitchens\r\n     and servants' offices overlooking me. Really, I had as soon\r\n     hear shrieking shells as the clatter they make with their pots\r\n     and pans. Behind me is a sash and blind factory yielding dust\r\n     and noise unspeakable. On the other side a dreadful man has\r\n     planted a garden, wherein he has spread an awning, and there\r\n     he holds his revels—his card and wine parties. Of course I\r\n     can but listen to him more than half the stifling hot nights,\r\n     but should I remonstrate, it is not improbable he might inform\r\n     me that this is a free country, which I doubt. Lucy and Fanny\r\n     fortunately are far away in Virginia, and so I am spared the\r\n     added discomfort of suffering through their nerves.\r\n\r\n     \"This town is as completely metamorphosed in summer as if it\r\n     had changed places with some struggling, dusty manufacturing\r\n     city,—building and digging going on everywhere; ugly\r\n     dirt-carts, instead of flower-crowned ladies in landaus,\r\n     passing through the dusty streets. You might, perhaps with\r\n     reason, suggest that I seem to have leisure,—that this is a\r\n     fine opportunity to read and improve my mind. Yes, I know,\r\n     but somehow I have lost all desire to improve my mind! My\r\n     present inclination is to gratify the mind I already have,—go\r\n     somewhere, see something, hear some really fine music!\r\n\r\n     \"Here there is nothing to be seen except unhappy\r\n     fellow-mortals panting beneath the burden of city existence;\r\n     street arabs making free with the front doorstep and\r\n     improvising tables for their greasy luncheons; pathetic\r\n     organ-grinders who lift melancholy eyes for recognition\r\n     and reward, after harrowing the soul with despairing\r\n     strains—'Miserere,' 'Ah, I have sighed to rest me,' and such;\r\n     unmuzzled little animals in mortal terror of the dog-catcher;\r\n     tired, patient horses who know not their own strength, and\r\n     quietly obey that other creature with so much less power\r\n     and so much more selfishness. All this is not cheerful to\r\n     the looker-out, and having seen it once, I look no more.\r\n     But I have lately made a discovery. My upper-story window\r\n     presents an interesting and instructive landscape. There\r\n     is a low-roofed stable between the hotel and the factory. I\r\n     can look over a great flat tin roof where snowy garments are\r\n     always drying, and upon which, like 'Little Dorritt's' lover,\r\n     I can gaze 'until I 'most think they wuz groves.' Moreover,\r\n     there is a happy woman who comes up through a trap-door and\r\n     walks much under the shadow of those groves. How do I know she\r\n     is happy? Partly by the patter of her busy feet, partly by the\r\n     bit of song that floats to me 'whiles.' But chiefly because\r\n     I have actually found out all about her while I have leaned\r\n     idly out of my window. First, she is very good—this dweller\r\n     beneath the flat roof.\r\n\r\n     \"On Sunday evenings she tunes up a little melodeon in her\r\n     regions below, and sings straight through the Moody and Sankey\r\n     hymn-book. Nor is this all. For a time I could not discover\r\n     whether she was wife, maid, or mother, and I felt much anxious\r\n     solicitude in her behalf. But lately she has brought up to the\r\n     roof in the evenings a small rocking-chair of the Mayflower\r\n     pattern, some crochet or tatting; and a great cat with an\r\n     enormous upright tail has followed her, and rubbed himself\r\n     comfortably against her knees.\r\n\r\n     \"She is a blessed little old maid—that's just what _she_ is!\r\n     But the cat is not the only 'follower.' A wholesome-looking\r\n     Englishman (side-whiskers, fresh complexion, china aster in\r\n     buttonhole) comes now and then. The little Mayflower chair\r\n     rocks a bit more nervously, the cat is overwhelmed with\r\n     surprise by receiving a slight push from the tidy slipper, the\r\n     tatting takes on new energy, and I see—well, now, you surely\r\n     don't expect me to tell you what I see? Nothing very dreadful\r\n     nor altogether unusual in the sphere of my happy woman and\r\n     the British coachman, who has her in his 'heye' and is surely\r\n     going to have her in his 'ome by and by.\r\n\r\n     \"But when my tired general comes home to me and keenly\r\n     scans my face to discover whether I am pining for the pines\r\n     or sighing for the sea, I cannot disgrace myself in his\r\n     eyes by revealing my low interest in my happy woman. Least\r\n     of all reveal my own loneliness! I show him the lovely\r\n     little window-box where I have a climbing nasturtium, a\r\n     morning-glory, and a curious strong vine that has prehensile\r\n     fingers at the end of every cluster of leaves. I show him the\r\n     curious ways of these strong climbers—how the nasturtium has\r\n     no tendrils, but a great fleshy stalk to be supported, and\r\n     so when it grows too tall to stand alone, it puts forth at\r\n     intervals a leaf with a mission; as soon as this leaf feels\r\n     the touch of the string, it contracts and wraps its brittle\r\n     stalk thrice around it—in and out, as you would wind your ball\r\n     of silk. And how the great long feelers of the morning-glory\r\n     behave just like ourselves. They look abroad for something\r\n     to lean upon, waving restlessly to and fro. Finding nothing,\r\n     they deliberately turn and _lean upon themselves_!\r\n\r\n     \"My general pities me because the square of blue sky into\r\n     which I am always looking is so small. But I tell him of all\r\n     the glories and marvels I have seen there, between the high\r\n     stone dwellings that shut it in: how a rainbow spanned it\r\n     once; how my Lady Moon looks down in some of her phases and\r\n     tells me of her hard life of hopeless bondage—while mine is\r\n     but for a little time; how the Pleiades have been seen in my\r\n     small heaven and bound me with sweetest influences; how my\r\n     friend, the Great Bear, straddles across for a look at me, and\r\n     a reminder that he knows me very well, and knew generations\r\n     of my fathers long before the twenty-three generations that\r\n     I know of myself.\r\n\r\n     \"And I have still more to tell him of the lovely time I am\r\n     having in my room—how I have watched a fairy castle grow\r\n     against my sky. How I saw at first a derrick spring aloft,\r\n     and then many tiny spirits of the air build away on a square\r\n     foundation; how they made port-holes in the top looking every\r\n     way for the Mafia or any other enemy, and over this threw\r\n     arches and fairy adornment of cunning work in white marble;\r\n     how they threw up a rocket then and hung out electric lights,\r\n     and I supposed their work was over and their airy castle\r\n     finished, but they then mounted a great calcium light to let\r\n     the incoming ships from foreign lands know our eye is upon\r\n     them; how they built another and still another story to their\r\n     castle—four in all, and were still building. And I call his\r\n     attention to a strange bird coming regularly at the same hour\r\n     in the evening, sailing (with 'a raucous voice') across our\r\n     dwelling and into my own little plantation in the sky. He\r\n     is of the species vulgarly called 'Bat'—and so I named him\r\n     our Fledermaus. At precisely the same hour every morning has\r\n     he come back again, screaming triumphantly, or putting on a\r\n     bold front to account to his mate in Central Park how he had\r\n     spent the night in the Long Island marshes. The first time\r\n     the flashlight was kindled in my castle in the air and its\r\n     searching glance fell upon the recreant Fledermaus, he wheeled\r\n     around and made his circuit in another direction, and we shall\r\n     hear his raucous voice no more!\r\n\r\n     \"Which is additional proof of what we know already:\r\n     'Conscience makes cowards of us all.' Or perhaps it is\r\n     only that no self-respecting Fledermaus can be expected to\r\n     countenance flashlights at hours when sensitive folk are\r\n     coming home in the morning.\r\n\r\n     \"My general listens respectfully while I go through all\r\n     this. 'Evidently \"stone walls do not a prison make,\"' is his\r\n     comment. 'Here are you interested in botany, astronomy, and in\r\n     building the Madison Square Garden.' 'Garden! Do stone walls\r\n     a garden make?' 'Here in New York they do,' he tells me; 'a\r\n     great, hot theatre is to be called a garden and crowned by\r\n     Diana of the Ephesians! St. Gaudens is making the goddess. But\r\n     _you'll_ not need gardens or goddesses to make you happy! Ah!\r\n     What a wonderful woman you are—so content, so cheery in spite\r\n     of all our privations.' Which shows what poor creatures men\r\n     are, as far as discernment goes, regarding the ways of women;\r\n     for my dear, oh, my dear!—a very lonely, homesick, heartsick\r\n     body is\r\n\r\n                                                 \"Your devoted\r\n                                                     \"SARA A. PRYOR.\r\n\r\n     \"P.S.—I am a wretch—I know I am—to end my letter with a howl.\r\n     But an organ-man under my window is grinding away at 'Home,\r\n     Sweet Home.' He must be driven away or I perish! There he goes\r\n     again—'The Old Folks at Home'! I must put both my sofa pillows\r\n     over my ears! Dearly, S. A. P.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in the winter I had a visit from a beautiful young lady, an orphan\r\ndaughter of a rear admiral of whom I had known in former days. She had\r\nfound herself temporarily embarrassed, and had planned an afternoon of\r\nmusic and reading, was about to send out some cards, and wished me to\r\nbe one of her patronesses. I gladly consented, and on the afternoon\r\ndesignated, went to her boarding-house near the Park, her landlady\r\nhaving kindly given her rooms for the entertainment. I was early, and\r\nas nobody appeared I pressed the negro boy at the door into my service,\r\nand placed some palms I found at hand, arranged the desk, and awaited\r\nthe reader and her audience. Presently Bishop Potter entered, carrying\r\nthe bag which held his robe, on his way, perhaps, to christen a baby.\r\nI knew him \"by sight,\" and ventured to introduce myself, simply as\r\n\"Mrs. Pryor,\" explaining my presence. He told me of his interest in\r\nthe occasion and in the young lady who was to read, adding, \"I know\r\nlittle of her qualification for her task, but I _did_ know her father.\"\r\nPresently who should walk in, tall, grim, and unattended, but General\r\nSherman! The bishop instantly presented me as Mrs. General Roger A.\r\nPryor. I was so wrought upon, finding myself in this awful presence,\r\nthat I exclaimed, \"Oh, General Sherman! _Never_ did I think I should\r\nfind myself in the same boat with _you_!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me gravely a moment, and said: \"Now see here! I'm not as\r\nblack as I am painted.\"—\"And I,\" said the bishop, \"am sorry, sorry, to\r\nfind the wife of my good friend, the general, willing to remember things\r\npast and gone forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said General Sherman, \"if she doesn't forbid me the house, I\r\nshould like to call on General Pryor! I'm told they have the cosiest\r\nlittle home in New York.\"\r\n\r\nHe did call, and so did his charming daughter, Rachel, whom I liked,\r\nand hope I made my friend.\r\n\r\nAs to the \"reading\"—Mrs. Botta, Mrs. Bettner, the two great ones and my\r\nown small self were the major part of the audience,—fit though few,—but\r\nI must confess that no occasion could have been to me fraught with more\r\ninterest, more significance. My thoughts rushed back to the time when\r\nthe man before me had marched through an unhappy Southern state without\r\neven a wheelbarrow to intercept his way, when all laws of civilized\r\nwarfare were sent to the winds, and the women and children, in a belt\r\nsixty miles wide, were plundered and driven from their homes; returning,\r\nafter he had passed, to weep over the blackened plains he left behind\r\nhim. In his official report of his operations in Georgia he said:\r\n\"We consumed the corn and fodder in the region thirty miles on either\r\nside, from Atlanta to Savannah, also the sweet potatoes, hogs, sheep,\r\nand poultry, and carried off more than ten thousand horses and mules.\r\nI estimated the damage done to the state of Georgia at one hundred\r\nmillions of dollars, at least twenty millions of which inured to our\r\nbenefit, and the remainder was simply waste and destruction.\"[8] But\r\nthe blame for this pillage must be placed higher than the shoulders of\r\nGeneral Sherman.\r\n\r\nOn December 18, 1863, Major-general Halleck thus instructed him: \"Should\r\nyou capture Charleston, I hope by _some accident_ the place may be\r\ndestroyed, and if a little salt should be sown on the site, it might\r\nprevent the growth of future crops of nullification and treason.\"\r\n\r\nSherman replied December 24, 1863:—\r\n\r\n     \"I will bear in mind your hint as to Charleston, and do not\r\n     think 'salt' will be necessary. When I move, the Fifteenth\r\n     Corps will be on the right of the right wing, and their\r\n     position will naturally bring them to Charleston first,—and\r\n     if you have watched the history of that corps, you will have\r\n     remarked that they generally do their work pretty well. The\r\n     truth is, the whole army is burning with an insatiable desire\r\n     to wreak vengeance upon South Carolina. I almost tremble at\r\n     her fate, but feel she deserves all that seems in store.\"\r\n\r\nA solid wall of smoke by day, forty miles wide and from the horizon\r\nto the zenith, gave notice to the women and children of the fate that\r\nwas moving on them. All day they watched it—all night it was lit up by\r\nforked tongues of flame lighting the lurid darkness. The next morning\r\nit reached them. Terror borne on the air, fleet as the furies spread\r\nout ahead, and murder, arson, rapine, enveloped them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: MRS. VINCENZO BOTTA.]\r\n\r\nBut why repeat the story? This was war, war that spares not the\r\ngraybeard, childhood, aged women, holy nuns—nobody! Not upon one only\r\ndoes the responsibility for such crimes rest. Nor is it for us to\r\ndesire, or mete out, an adequate punishment. The Great Judge \"will\r\nrepay\"—unless, as I humbly pray, He has forgiven, as we have forgiven,\r\nand I trust been ourselves forgiven.\r\n\r\nNo Southerner, however, can wholly forget, as he stands before the\r\nsplendid statue made by St. Gaudens, at what price the honors to this\r\nman were bought. The angel may bear, to some eyes, a palm of victory,\r\nand proclaim, \"Fame, Honor, Immortality, to him whom I lead.\" To the eye\r\nof the Southerner the winged figure bears a rod, and the bronze lips a\r\nwarning—\"Beware!\"\r\n\r\nOur earliest and most faithful friends in our new home were Judge Edward\r\nPatterson (our first visitor) and his amiable and gifted family. Much\r\nof our happiness was due to their sympathetic attentions, at a time when\r\nwe had few friends.\r\n\r\nOne of my early friends in New York was Mrs. Vincenzo Botta, whom I\r\nhad met at the house of Mrs. Dix when we were negotiating with Colonel\r\nMapleson, Patti, and Nicolini. She was then about sixty-nine years\r\nold. She died seven years after she first came to my little home in 33d\r\nStreet, and a warm friendship grew to full maturity in those few years.\r\nWithout beauty she had yet a charming presence, with no evidences of\r\nage, although the little black lace mantilla she wore over her curls was\r\nher own confession. She was the only woman who held at the time, or has\r\nheld since, anything like a real salon. Nobody was ever known to decline\r\nan invitation to that house. It was one of the large, old-fashioned\r\nhouses near Fifth Avenue, with San Domingo mahogany doors, wide\r\nstaircase, and four spacious rooms on each floor. There were tapestries\r\non the walls, a few good pictures, three busts,—one of Salvini, one of\r\nthe hostess's husband, the other her maid,—wood fires, and fresh flowers\r\nevery day. The gracious white-haired lady at the head of the house\r\nhad a charm born of long experience in all the gentle ministrations of\r\nlife; her mind was beautifully cultivated, the bluest blood filled her\r\nveins; but not from her lips did one learn anything of her distinguished\r\nantecedents, although she had been an author, a sculptor, and poet.\r\nShe came nearer to the distinction of holding a salon than any one who\r\nhas ever lived in New York. At her receptions might be found Salvini,\r\nEdwin Booth, Modjeska, Christine Nilsson, and every distinguished author\r\nand diplomat who visited the city. Nobody was ever hired to entertain\r\nher guests—they entertained each other. Sometimes a great singer would\r\nvolunteer a song, or a poet or an actor give something of his art, of\r\ncourse never requested by the hostess. Sometimes the evening would close\r\nwith a dance.\r\n\r\nOne often wondered at the ease with which Mrs. Botta could gather around\r\nher musicians, artists, actors, authors, men and women of fashion,\r\nmen conspicuous in political life,—every one who had in himself some\r\nelement of originality or genius. Her salon was not inaptly termed\r\na reproduction of Lady Blessington's or the Duchess of Sutherland's.\r\nA card to her _conversazione_, as she preferred to term it, was, as\r\nI have said, eagerly sought, and never declined. Her afternoon teas\r\nwere famous; but her dinners! I do not mean the terrapin and wines—the\r\ntable-talk in this mansion was the attraction. Everybody came away\r\nnot only charmed, but encouraged; thinking better of himself, and by\r\nconsequence better of his fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nDinners like these are constantly given to-day all over the country.\r\nPerhaps our best and highest people—those that constitute the honor\r\nand pride of our social life, and redeem our manners from the criticism\r\nto which they are subjected—are the people who manage never to appear\r\nin the papers. They give dinners of great taste and beauty that are\r\nnever described. At their tables are gathered the wit and wisdom of\r\nmany lands, and whatever accessories can be commanded by taste and\r\nwealth. These stars of the social firmament revolve in a sphere of their\r\nown,—around no wealthy or titled sun,—but around each other. Vitalized\r\nby one powerful magnet, they at once, like iron filings, attract each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI had known nothing of Mrs. Botta's prestige nor of her friendship\r\nwith Emerson, Carlyle, Froude, Fanny Kemble, Frederika Brémer, Daniel\r\nWebster, Charles O'Connor, Fitz-Greene Halleck, even Louis Kossuth,\r\nwhen she first visited me, introducing herself; nor did she ever allude\r\nto any one or anything (as so many do!) to impress me with her claims\r\nto my consideration. A most fascinating talker herself, she proceeded\r\nsimply to draw me on gently to talk of myself,—and no magnet can draw\r\nlike human sympathy. I once found myself telling her something of my\r\nexperience in time of war, encouraged by her splendid eyes fixed upon\r\nme in rapt attention.\r\n\r\nPresently their light was veiled in tears, and rising from her seat she\r\ntook me in outstretched arms and kissed me. No wonder that the soul of\r\nJonathan was knit to the soul of David from that hour.\r\n\r\nShe could even sympathize with so small a matter as my dolors anent the\r\nhot summer I had passed—\"Yes, yes,\" she said, \"I know all about it.\"\r\nShe had written a dismal catalogue of the miseries of the dog-days, of\r\nwhich I remember the concluding lines:—\r\n\r\n     \"When Phœbus and Fahrenheit start a rampage\r\n     Then there's heat, no thoughts of a blizzard assuage;\r\n     And when 'General Humidity' joins in the tilt\r\n     Like plucked flowers of the field the poor mortal must wilt,\r\n     Till he cries like the wit, in disconsolate tones,\r\n     To take off his flesh and sit in his bones!\r\n     But for all that, my dear, to make myself clear,\r\n     Give me New York for nine months of the year—\r\n     With all its shortcomings there's no place so dear!\r\n     With its life and its rush, what it does and has done,\r\n     There's no city like it under the sun.\"\r\n\r\nIn which I have come to agree with her.\r\n\r\nIn her drawing-rooms, beautiful by specimens of her own work,—for she\r\nwas a sculptor and exquisite needlewoman as well as poet and graceful\r\nhostess,—I met many of the literary lights of the day, as well as\r\nsociety women of New York. \"I shall give a reception to Miss Murfree,\"\r\nshe once told me. \"Why?\" I asked. \"Is she one of your great people?\"\r\n\"Do you remember,\" said Mrs. Botta, with a twinkling eye, \"'Dorinda\r\nCayce'?\" I remembered Dorinda Cayce in the \"Prophet of the Great Smoky\r\nMountain,\" who had gone through storms of snow and tempest to win pardon\r\nfor her lover in prison, only to discover at the end he was but an\r\nordinary, selfish mortal. There was nothing so remarkable about that, I\r\nsubmitted. \"Ah! but don't you remember how she explained the wonderful\r\nfact that, with all his faults, _she_ had loved him and had been ready\r\nto die for him? 'No—no—' said Dorinda, 'I _never_ loved _you_! I loved\r\nwhat I _thunk_ you was.' Then and there,\" said Mrs. Botta, \"she reached\r\ndeep down into the mysteries of a woman's heart. We love what we _think_\r\nthey are! I shall give her a reception.\"\r\n\r\nI had met William Cullen Bryant five or six years before, not long\r\nbefore he died (I have seen so many setting suns!), and Mrs. Botta, who\r\nhad known him well, was interested in my account of an interview with\r\nhim. We had come over from Brooklyn to attend a reception which the\r\npublisher of Johnson's Encyclopædia gave to his contributors. One of\r\nhis articles had been written by my husband. At this reception I also\r\nmet Bayard Taylor, Clarence Stedman, and others, with whose talents\r\nin invective against the South I was familiar. But I bore them no\r\nmalice. I was especially anxious to speak with the old poet, and sought\r\nan introduction to him. When the crowd passed on to the refreshment\r\nrooms, I observed him standing alone, leaning upon the grand piano,\r\nand I ventured to join him. Supper _versus_ William Cullen Bryant!\r\nThere could be but one conclusion. I made bold to hope he was well, as\r\nI stood almost spellbound before his fine gray head. I found myself\r\nhoping something more. I was willing he should hate treason with all\r\nhis heart—but I did wish he could ever so little like the traitor!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" he replied to my question, \"I am perfectly well. But I find\r\nI am growing old.\"\r\n\r\n\"I warrant,\" said I, \"you could struggle for your oysters with the best\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" he replied, \"but that is not the trouble. I forget people's\r\nnames.\"\r\n\r\n\"A poet can afford to forget. Only politicians need be careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody can afford to be unkind,\" answered the old poet.\r\n\r\n\"Names are small matters,\" I suggested. \"If you remember faces, you are\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said he, \"you must remember names. I did not arrange this\r\ndrama in which we are all acting, but I know a part of my rôle is to\r\nremember names. If I am presented to Mr. Smith, and I meet him next day\r\nin Broadway, I think it was intended I should say 'Good morning, Mr.\r\nSmith.' Otherwise, why was I presented to him? If I have forgotten his\r\nname, I have forgotten my part, and lose the only opportunity that will\r\never be given me in this world of being polite to Mr. Smith.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Botta delighted in such incidents as this. I wish she could have\r\nlaughed with me over an attempt my Gordon (Mrs. Henry Rice) made to\r\nintroduce Mr. Bryant to a class of poor white boys she was teaching at a\r\nnight-school in her home on a great tobacco plantation in Virginia. She\r\nhad taught them to read and write, some arithmetic and geography, even\r\nsome Latin; and was minded to awaken the æsthetic instincts which she\r\nbelieved must exist in the poor fellows. She read them Bryant's \"Ode to\r\na Waterfowl.\" \"Now, boys,\" she said eagerly, \"tell me how _you_ would\r\nfeel if you had seen this.\" There was dead silence. Appealing to the\r\nmost hopeful of her sons of toil, she received an enlightening response,\r\n\"I wouldn't think nuthin'.\" \"What would you say?\" she persisted. \"Wall—I\r\nreckon I'd say, 'Thar goes a duck!'\"\r\n\r\nNobody was kinder to us than Edmund Clarence Stedman. On Tuesdays and\r\nFridays one might always find a welcome—no cards were issued—and a\r\nsmall, choice company of literary men and women in his drawing-rooms.\r\nMr. Stedman was the soul of kindness. His \"friends from the Old\r\nDominion\" were just as welcome as if he had never written \"Abraham\r\nLincoln, give us a MAN\" to crush out our \"rebellion.\" No man could\r\nhave been more generous to authors, himself so polished and graceful a\r\nwriter. I remember in my own first timid venture—I had written something\r\nfor the _Cosmopolitan Magazine_—that he made haste to welcome me, to say\r\nmy essay was \"charmingly written,\" and to add, \"I have always observed\r\nthat whatever a lady chooses to write has something, an air, that the\r\nrest of us can never attain,\"—which goes to prove the chivalry, if not\r\nthe perception, of dear Mr. Stedman.\r\n\r\nIn the eighties there were other houses where purely literary receptions\r\nwere held weekly: notably at President Barnard's, also at Mrs. Barrow's,\r\naffectionately known by her own _nom de plume_, \"Aunt Fanny,\" and\r\nthus recorded to-day in encyclopædias of literature. Mrs. Andros B.\r\nStone also gathered the elect in her drawing-rooms. There I saw again\r\nthe gentle Madame Modjeska. There I met Henry M. Stanley, thronged\r\nwith admirers, and with great drops of perspiration on his heated\r\nbrow,—declining to say to me \"nay\" when I asked if this were not worse\r\nthan the jungles of Africa!\r\n\r\nWhat a life he had led, to be sure! We first heard of him as a soldier\r\nin the Confederate army; then in the Union navy. He represented \"the\r\nBlue and the Gray\"—he had worn them both. We all know of his search for\r\nDr. Livingstone, of his subsequent marches through the Dark Continent;\r\nof his perils by land, perils by sea, courage and fortitude. And now\r\nhere he was—quite like other people—in an evening coat with a gardenia\r\nin his button-hole, and with an English bride all in white and gold,\r\nand still young enough to fill the measure of his glory with more\r\nadventures.\r\n\r\nI was early elected a member of the Wednesday Afternoon Club, proposed\r\nby Mrs. Botta, whose first able contribution—a review of Matthew\r\nArnold's essay, \"Civilization in the United States\"—enlightened me as to\r\nwhat might be expected of me when my turn came to provide a paper for\r\ndiscussion. I think I disappointed Mrs. Botta by persistently \"begging\r\noff\" from this duty—implied by my consent to become a member of the\r\nclub, which included Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge, Mrs. R. W. Gilder, Mrs.\r\nAlmon Goodwin, Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Miss Kate Field, Mrs. George\r\nHaven Putnam, and other literary women. Mrs. John Sherwood was one of\r\nour grande dames, altogether a very notable personage in her prime,\r\na much-travelled lady, the friend of Lord Houghton, Daniel Webster,\r\nand other great lights. She could always gather a large and admiring\r\naudience at her literary conferences. She lived to an old age, and never\r\nceased to be \"a personage\"—a very fine type of a high-born, high-bred,\r\nintellectual woman. These reunions, which led society in the eighties,\r\nafforded opportunity for the man or woman of versatile talent. Anybody\r\ncan harangue or read an essay or exploit a special fad or hobby. Anybody\r\ncan chatter, but how many of us can pass a thought \"like a bit of flame\"\r\nfrom one to another; or turn, like a many-faceted gem, a scintillating\r\nflash in every direction? This is possible! This made the charm of\r\nthe French salon, and makes the charm to-day of more than one little\r\ndrawing-room that I wot of, which has never been described in the\r\nsociety columns of the newspapers.\r\n\r\nI must not dare put myself on record as enjoying only \"high thinking.\"\r\nThe great Dr. Johnson liked gossip, so did Madame de Sévigné, so did\r\nGreville, and hundreds of other delightful people. So do I! But I draw a\r\nline at some modern gossip,—whether Mrs. Claggett's domestic unhappiness\r\nwill reach the climax of a divorce, whether she will better herself in\r\nher next venture; whether Mrs. Billion will really have any difficulty\r\nin getting into society, or what on earth Lord Frederick could see\r\nin that pug-nosed Peggy Rustic, who hasn't even the saving grace of a\r\nlittle money. I am afraid of personalities, and yet we cannot always\r\ndiscuss politics and religion. Men have been burnt at the stake for\r\ntalking politics and religion!\r\n\r\nI have never sympathized in the wholesale abuse of New York society—and\r\nby this much-used word I mean the society defined by Noah Webster as\r\n\"that class in any community which gives and receives entertainments.\"\r\nNecessarily a city like New York must be made up of many contrasting\r\nelements—but I believe the true leaven of good society is always here,\r\nand will in the end inevitably prevail to the leavening of the whole.\r\nOne cannot fail to observe in the modern novels that profess to expose\r\nit situations that could, under no circumstances, ever have occurred\r\nin decent society. The facility with which men and women of humble\r\nantecedents reach high position here is easily explained. Their early\r\ndisadvantages have taught them enterprise, to look out for their own\r\nadvantage and seize every opportunity. They have ambition. Hence they\r\nare \"climbers.\" The lowest rung in the ladder successfully reached,\r\nthere is foothold for the next. They are not sensitive. \"Snubbed?\" said\r\none. \"Of course! Isn't everybody snubbed?\" It is not wonderful that New\r\nYork receives them. Their wits are sharpened. They are very agreeable,\r\nvery supple, very adaptable. _Au reste!_ Well, they learn. There are\r\nbooks on \"Manners and Social Usages\" to be had for a dime or two. There\r\nis one called \"The Gentleman\" which was popular in the nineties. To have\r\nread Mr. Howells on this book is to long to quote him.\r\n\r\n\"We have lately seen how damaging Mr. McAllister could make himself to\r\nthe best society of New York by his devout portrayal of it, and now\r\nanother devotee of fashion is trying to play the iconoclast with the\r\nideal of gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"Do read 'Gentleman.' It is the most delicious bit of ridiculous\r\nflunkyism that has appeared yet—always excepting the great success in\r\nthat line. After instructing the proposed gentleman about his cravats\r\nand pocket-handkerchief, and not to cross his legs or wink or pick his\r\nteeth, the author concludes: 'In making an offer of marriage, when the\r\nlady replies affirmatively, immediately clasp her in your arms'!\"\r\n\r\nBut after all said and done against society, I have always liked it.\r\nI have not the least wish to turn reformer. It will work out its own\r\nsalvation as to important characteristics, and we can afford to laugh\r\nat its ridiculous ways. We know it is \"too bad for blessing,\" but at\r\nthe same time \"it is too good for banning.\"\r\n\r\n\"I overheard Jove,\" said Silenus, \"talking of destroying the earth;\r\nhe said he had failed; they were all rogues and vixens, going from bad\r\nto worse. Minerva said she hoped not; they were only ridiculous little\r\ncreatures with this odd circumstance: if you called them bad, they would\r\nappear bad; if good, they would appear so; and there was no one person\r\namong them who would not puzzle her owl—much more all Olympus—to know\r\nwhether it was fundamentally good or bad.\" It all depends upon the point\r\nof view, and in a difference of opinion between Jove and Minerva I do\r\nnot hesitate.\r\n\r\nBut if I may be allowed one more word, I think the trouble about our\r\nNew York society is that we have too much of it. We have no leisure\r\nto select. And then we seem to be always _en representation_—as\r\nSenior said of an American girl. We are consumed with a desire to\r\nmake an impression,—that deadly foe to good manners,—or else we wrap\r\nourselves in reserve like a garment. Of the two I think I prefer the\r\nformer—anything but the icy dulness of the intense inane.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth, we are heavy—we Americans. We cannot pass quickly,\r\n\"like a bit of flame,\" from one thing to another. We are rarely gracious\r\nenough to wish to please, but if we do, our compliments are not an\r\nethereal touch, but flattery broadly laid on with spade and trowel.\r\nChesterfield says, \"Human nature is the same all over the world.\"\r\nThat is, doubtless, true,—we hear it quoted often enough,—but there\r\nis a great deal more of it in some places than in others. There is an\r\nenormous quantity of human nature in New York. After all, it is not as\r\nsubtle as we imagine. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu declares that in all\r\nher life she had seen but two species of human beings—men and women! We\r\ncannot agree with her,—we have seen others,—but we have faith that all\r\nthings are working together for good, and good only, in our social life,\r\nindications to the contrary, reports to the contrary, notwithstanding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur little house on 33d Street was the theatre of many pleasant events.\r\nThere I found my friends on my Thursdays at home. There my daughter\r\nLucy was married. Among her wedding presents was an interesting bit\r\nof embroidery from the wife of our Minister to Turkey, S. S. Cox.\r\nMr. Cox had sent it with a letter, at the conclusion of which he\r\nexplained,—remembering my supposed interest in Southern dialect,—\"I am\r\nsorry to be so stupid, but the truth is I'm mighty tired! I have been\r\ntoting Americans over Constantinople all day.\"\r\n\r\nI answered, requesting a key to the embroidery, and added, \"I am sorry\r\nto find that the onerous duties of our Minister to the Ottoman Empire\r\ninclude the bearing upon his back or in his arms the bodies of visiting\r\nAmericans, etc. ('Tote,' an old English word now obsolete, is still\r\nused by Southern negroes for bearing a burden, not for conducting or\r\nescorting.)\" Here is Mr. Cox's reply:—\r\n\r\n                                    \"U. S. LEGATION, CONSTANTINOPLE,\r\n                                                      \"May 22, 1886.\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR MRS. PRYOR:—\r\n\r\n     \"If your daughter was half as much pleased with my wife's\r\n     little gift as your letter made me, then the _entente\r\n     cordiale_ between the Bosphorus and the Hudson is firmly\r\n     established. These little ministrations are very little; but—\r\n\r\n          \"'To the God that maketh all\r\n          There is no great—there is no small.'\r\n\r\n     Some Brahmin said that! I think it is one of Emerson's petty\r\n     larcenies from the Orient; but it is ever so true. Now\r\n\r\n          \"'On what a slender thread\r\n          Hang everlasting things,'\r\n\r\n     as the Methodists used to sing! Here, on my little word\r\n     'tote,' you hang a social and philological disquisition! I\r\n     will not discuss the word in its Africanese dialect; but I\r\n     take the noble red man—whose totem is his household god; and\r\n     in this sense, in this connection, let the doyley be revered,\r\n     as your husband would say, _totus atque rotundus_.\r\n\r\n     \"The bit of Oriental work with its cabalistic characters bears\r\n     the Sultan's monogram.

It is said that the blood came from the hand of\r\n     Mahomet II when he rode into the church. It is shaped like\r\n     a hand, you may see. Another tale not so harrowing: It is\r\n     that Amurath, when he made the first treaty with a Christian\r\n     power,—a small republic of Ragusa,—lost his temper and\r\n     dipped his five fingers in ink, and thus made his mark on the\r\n     parchment.

S. COX.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always thought that New York's Centennial celebration in 1889 was\r\nlargely responsible for the patriotic societies of men and women which\r\nhave swept the country.\r\n\r\nEverybody was willing at the time of the celebration to sit for two\r\nentire days on rude seats under the April sun while the evidences of the\r\npower and achievements of our great country passed in review before us.\r\n\r\nWe remember the military pomp of the first day, the dignified carriage\r\nof the governors of our United States as they bared their heads in\r\ngracious acknowledgment of the cheers of the people, the triumphant\r\nblare of trumpets, the stirring strains of martial music, the glitter\r\nof bayonets, the long, living line, which was only a small part of the\r\nnation's bulwark against its possible foes.\r\n\r\nThen the schools and colleges, then the gorgeous civic parade and\r\nthe illustrations and representatives of the trades, occupations, and\r\nnationalities that have found a home in our broad land.\r\n\r\nAll this passed before us and is but dimly remembered. No permanent\r\nimpression was made by the great display. Little remains except the\r\nrecollection that there were millions and millions of people lining our\r\npavements, that the show was hardly adequate to the expectation of these\r\npeople, that it was a time of many mistakes and much discomfort.\r\n\r\nBut this pageant was not all of the Centennial. A number of men of taste\r\nand feeling had conceived the happy idea of collecting revolutionary\r\nrelics, papers, and portraits, and exhibiting them in the Metropolitan\r\nOpera House.\r\n\r\nWe expected to be interested in these, and some of us gave time and\r\nthought to the task of making the collection as choice as possible. But\r\nwe were unprepared for the effect of the exhibition upon the minds of\r\nthe beholders. We filed along the galleries of the Metropolitan Opera\r\nHouse and mused over the papers of \"The Cincinnati\"; the books, few\r\nand well worn; pocket dictionaries with bookplates, candlesticks that\r\nhad held the tallow dips in difficult times; silver caddies that had\r\ndone duty in the \"tea-cup times\"; pewter platters that had served many\r\na frugal meal at Valley Forge; the curtains that had shaded the bed of\r\nLafayette; the piano-cover embroidered by sweet Nellie Custis; pathetic\r\nempty garments, the silken coat of George Washington, the brown silk\r\ngown of Martha Washington. We remembered at what price the glories of\r\nthe preceding days had been purchased. We lived over the early times\r\nof anxiety, privation, and danger. Raising our eyes to the walls, we\r\nencountered the pictured eyes of the men and women whose spirit, behind\r\nour little army, had compelled events and given dignity and importance\r\nto our Revolutionary history.\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to associate thought, learning, courage, foresight, and\r\nstatesmanship with those placid faces. Artists of that day presented\r\nonly the calm, impassive features of their sitters. There was George\r\nWashington, serene in every pose, dress, and age; Alexander Hamilton,\r\nRichard Henry Lee, keen-eyed Patrick Henry, Martha Washington, Elizabeth\r\nWashington, fair Nelly Custis, dark-eyed Frances Bland, whose patriot\r\nbrother fills a lost grave in Trinity churchyard. These and scores of\r\nothers looked down upon us from the walls of our great opera-house.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is this, and this only, of all the pageant that made a\r\nliving and lasting impression upon the minds of the people. Pondering\r\nupon the associations connected with these relics and portraits of the\r\nRevolutionary time, and rereading the histories connected with them,\r\nan impulse was given which is now thrilling our people to the extremest\r\nbounds of our country, and which will result in our taking proper steps\r\nto acquire and preserve all the localities connected with the struggle\r\nfor our independence.\r\n\r\nI was keenly interested in the celebration. I knew the president, Mr.\r\nHenry Marquand, and took upon myself the duty of collecting portraits\r\nfrom Virginia—of Patrick Henry, members of the Washington family, Nelly\r\nCustis, Frances Bland, and others. I cherish an engraved resolution\r\nof thanks adopted by the committee, stating that such thanks were\r\n\"especially due\" for my \"valuable cooperation in the work of the Loan\r\nExhibition of portraits.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of the feeling inspired at the time of the Centennial at\r\nonce expressed itself in the formation of the societies of patriotic men\r\nand women now so numerous in this country. I assisted in the foundation\r\nof these societies—the Preservation of the Virginia Antiquities, the\r\nassociation owning Jamestown; the Mary Washington Memorial Association;\r\nthe Daughters of the American Revolution; and the National Society of\r\nthe Colonial Dames of America. The duty of organizing a chapter of the\r\nDaughters of the American Revolution was assigned to me, and I named it\r\n\"The New York City Chapter.\" Mrs. Vincenzo Botta was my first member,\r\nand Mrs. Martha Lamb, honorary life member. I was much in conference\r\nwith Mrs. Martha Lamb when she was helping to organize the Colonial\r\nDames—and I was early, heart and soul, interested in the Daughters of\r\nthe American Revolution. Of Jamestown and the noble society which owns\r\nit—everybody knows. I managed a great ball at the White Sulphur Springs\r\nto help build a monument over Mary Washington's grave. The governors of\r\nNew York and of Virginia each sent flags—from the state of my birth and\r\nthe state of my adoption. General Lee conducted the Mary Washington of\r\nthe hour. The Virginia beauties wore their great grandmother's gowns\r\nof quilted petticoat and brocade, and I received a large sum for the\r\nmonument.\r\n\r\nFor the Mary Washington monument Mrs. Charles Avery Doremus, with Mrs.\r\nWilbur Bloodgood, gave a beautiful play, for which the Secretary of\r\nthe Navy lent me colors enough to drape the entire house. I cherish\r\nthe permit I received to use these colors. It was signed \"George\r\nDewey\"! Patti, the guest of Mrs. Ogden Doremus, occupied one of the\r\nboxes. The orchestra played \"Home, Sweet Home,\" and she rose and bowed\r\nas only Patti can bow. I talked with her between acts and told her\r\nwhat a naughty, candy-loving little ten-year-old maid she had been\r\nwhen she _would_ stay in Petersburg with Ellen Glasgow's mother, and\r\nStrakosch had to pay her to sing with a hatful of candy! All this she\r\nreceived with her own merry, rippling laughter. It was a kind deed—the\r\ngreat singer to give an afternoon of her time to encourage me in my\r\nenterprise, and charm my amiable amateurs by her hearty applause.\r\nAuthorized by my chief, the widow of Chief Justice Waite, I made\r\nthe Princess Eulalia and the Duchess of Veragua members of the Mary\r\nWashington Memorial Association, and conferred upon them the Golden Star\r\nof the order. This was a pleasant souvenir for them of the Columbian\r\nExposition.\r\n\r\nThe societies based upon Colonial and Revolutionary descent deprecate\r\nthe idea that anything tending to the creation of an aristocracy is\r\nintended by their action,—that they attach any other significance to\r\nthe accident of birth than the presumption that it insures interest\r\nand perpetuity;—that there is any motive underlying their movement less\r\nnoble than the pure principle of patriotism. Americans, notwithstanding\r\ntheir adulation of foreign titles, have been until lately somewhat\r\nsensitive lest they should be thought to assume a right to aristocracy.\r\nWhen Bishop Meade was collecting material for his \"History of Old\r\nFamilies and Churches in Virginia,\" he found the owners of hereditary\r\narms and crests actually ashamed to confess the fact! They felt with\r\nNapoleon a desire to create rather than inherit nobility.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the times now seems to tend to the American aristocracy\r\nof birth, but on the republican foundation of merit, character and\r\nservice done; not an aristocracy which assumes the right to social rule\r\nbecause of birth, but an aristocracy which recognizes birth as a bond\r\nand an obligation. \"There can be,\" said Bishop Potter, \"only one true\r\naristocracy in all the world—that of character enriched by learning.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the laws that govern enthusiasm. It is\r\nlike \"the wind that bloweth where it listeth\"—and no man can discover\r\nits source. Once in a hundred years a great wave of patriotic ardor\r\nhas surged over this continent. Nathaniel Bacon lived a hundred years\r\ntoo soon when he struck the first blow against the tyranny of England.\r\nA hundred years later his spirit possessed our revolutionary fathers.\r\nAnother hundred years passed, and the whole country responded to a\r\nsimilar instinct of patriotism. It is sure to go on and on, and be\r\nrenewed and invigorated at every centennial celebration; and who will\r\nbe able to number the ranks, or estimate the strength or compute the\r\nriches, or rightly value the influence of the sons and daughters of the\r\nAmerican Revolution?\r\n\r\nIn addition to this and other patriotic societies, a very important\r\nnational society was formed of the Colonial Dames of America, in which\r\nI was interested. No state leads in this association—all are upon an\r\nequal footing. The applicant cannot apply, paradoxical as this appears!\r\nHer own place in the world, however noble her lineage, must also be\r\nconsidered. She must be gentle of manner as well as gentle of blood.\r\n\r\nIt is distinctly understood that this society is a firm, though silent,\r\nprotest against that aristocracy which considers itself best because\r\nit is highest on the tax list and bank list. There is not the remotest\r\nsuggestion of an aggressive spirit, but the steady trend is against\r\nplutocracy, arrogance, and that impertinent assumption of place notable\r\nin this country in those who have no foundation for pride beneath the\r\nsurface of the earth, and no aspiration above it.\r\n\r\nOne of the sure prophecies of our future prosperity and honor may be\r\nfound in the number and importance of the patriotic societies of women.\r\nFor, however individuals may sully them by personal pride and ambition,\r\nor restrict them by a spirit of exclusiveness antagonistic to the\r\nfundamental principles upon which they are based, their very existence\r\nproves the decided reaction from certain grave evils which are well\r\nknown and which certainly will be, unchecked, a source of peril to our\r\nbeloved country.\r\n\r\nI believe in the true-hearted American woman. I have known her in every\r\nphase of human experience: in poverty, in suffering, in disaster, in\r\nprosperity. I proudly rank myself beside her! Whatever fickle fashion\r\nor wayward fancy may decree for her, I know if there be one passionate\r\ndesire above all others which inspires her heart, it is to leave this\r\nworld better and happier for her having been born into it,—to become\r\nherself a bright exemplar of the beauty of goodness, so that all may\r\nbe won by the loveliness of lovely lives; to let the whole trend of her\r\nlife be forward, not backward; upward, not downward; to borrow from the\r\nfires of the heroic past to kindle the fires of the future; to preserve\r\nto that end the memory of the deeds of those whose lives have set them\r\napart in the history of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1888 yellow fever appeared in Florida and raged with\r\npeculiar violence in Jacksonville. Early in September I received a\r\nletter inviting me to meet a number of ladies at rooms on Broadway\r\nto organize a committee for the relief of the Jacksonville sufferers.\r\nMrs. Stedman (wife of the poet) was with me at the time I received the\r\nletter, and she agreed with me that it would be a most beautiful thing\r\nfor the New York women to send substantial relief to their stricken\r\nsisters in Florida. So, on the day and hour appointed, Mrs. Stedman\r\naccompanied me to the place designated. We found ourselves in the\r\npresence of a large roomful of ladies neither of us had ever before\r\nseen. I was made chairman by acclamation, and a Mrs. Manton secretary.\r\n\r\nI had never presided at a meeting, but I did my best. I invited an\r\nexpression of the views of those before me as to the wisest schemes for\r\nthe benevolent work. A great many suggestions were offered of a totally\r\nunpractical nature, and I finally asked for an adjournment, to meet\r\ntwo days from the present, and requested my \"committee\" to consider the\r\nmatter, confer with their friends, and give me the opportunity to seek\r\nadvice from mine. Mrs. Stedman seemed much discouraged, as we walked\r\nhome together. She felt sure nothing would result from this experiment;\r\nand besides, as Mayor Hewitt was engaged in collecting funds for the\r\nrelief of Jacksonville, perhaps all good citizens should send their\r\nofferings to him. I intended at the next meeting to follow up her\r\nsuggestions, but only half a dozen ladies appeared. I represented to\r\nthem that we must have money at once to pay for our service in future\r\nand a small debt already incurred, and we then again adjourned. In the\r\nvestibule an army of eager newspaper reporters awaited us, in whose\r\nhands I left my friends, having nothing myself to communicate. Next\r\nmorning every paper in New York announced the interesting fact that\r\nMrs. Roger A. Pryor was president of \"The Ladies' Jacksonville Relief\r\nSociety,\" that names well known in social and literary circles were\r\nassociated with hers, and donations of clothing, food, and money were\r\nsolicited! Of course the press sent me many reporters, and I found\r\nmyself suddenly invested with importance and armed with authority. I\r\nwent joyfully to meet my appointment for another meeting, and found\r\na room, full indeed—but of empty chairs! Not a soul came! I waited\r\nthroughout the hour alone. At the end of it a message was sent in to\r\nme from the reporters without. What had we done? What should they say\r\nin the next morning's issue of the _Herald_, the _World_, the _Sun_,\r\nthe _Tribune_? Sorely perplexed, I answered: \"Tell the gentlemen we are\r\nsitting with closed doors. I shall have nothing to report for several\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose no woman in all New York was ever in a more embarrassing\r\nsituation. Here was I advertised as president of a society engaged in\r\na great benevolent enterprise, and the society had simply melted away,\r\ndisappeared, left no trace, not even a name and address! What would\r\nNew York think of me? I keenly felt the absurdity of my position, but\r\nsuperior to every personal annoyance was my own disappointment. An\r\nopportunity to work effectively for the stricken people of Florida had\r\nbeen suddenly snatched from me. A friend in Jacksonville, having heard\r\nof the movement, had written:—\r\n\r\n     \"I have been prostrated by yellow fever, and am unable to\r\n     carry out the plans I had made with Bishop Weed for aid for\r\n     the sick and friendless children here, and the bishop's days\r\n     are filled with the most pressing duties. Along this pathway\r\n     through the valley of the shadow of death there are many\r\n     little children whose pathetic condition touches the chords\r\n     of our tenderest sympathies. But our hands hang limp and\r\n     helpless, and so we hold them out to you.\"\r\n\r\nI found myself consumed with longing to help them. I felt then—as I felt\r\nafterward for the orphans of Galveston—that I could almost consent to\r\ngive my own life if I could but save theirs.\r\n\r\nThese were the dreams of the night, and with the dawn I had resolved\r\nto be \"obedient to the heavenly vision.\" Before ten o'clock I sent\r\ntelegrams to Mrs. Vincenzo Botta, Mrs. Wm. C. Whitney, Miss Rose\r\nElizabeth Cleveland, Mrs. Frederic Coudert, Mrs. Judge Brady, Mrs.\r\nWhitelaw Reid, Mrs. Levi P. Morton, Mrs. Don Dickinson, Mrs. William C.\r\nRives, Mrs. William Astor, and Mrs. Martha Lamb. Would they join me in\r\na gift from New York women to Jacksonville?\r\n\r\nEvery one responded, \"Yes, gladly, if you will manage it.\" Mrs. Astor,\r\nMrs. Reid, and Mrs. Coudert sent money—a goodly sum—to start my work.\r\n\r\nHere I was, then, with a splendid following—_le premier pas_? Where\r\ncould I commence? Surely not by begging money—that I would never do.\r\nBy some means we must earn it. Just then I saw that Mr. Frohman had\r\noffered a matinée for the Mayor's Relief Fund. I communicated with Mr.\r\nFrohman, asking him to beg the mayor to let my fine committee have this\r\nmatinée with which to inaugurate our work. His Honor evidently regarded\r\nthe proposition as indicative of nerve, needing repression. Mr. Frohman\r\nquoted him as surprised, and quite decided: \"Mr. Hewitt says he thought\r\neverybody knew he needed all the money he could get.\"\r\n\r\nHe had only that one matinée. Before night I had telegraphed every\r\nreputable theatre and concert-hall in the city, and secured _nine_!\r\nThoroughly upon my mettle, I went to work. My support was all out of\r\ntown except Mrs. Botta and Mrs. Fanny Barrow. We were a committee of\r\nthree for several weeks, but we diligently increased our strength by\r\nletters and telegrams. Mr. Aronson, of the Casino, fixed upon September\r\n27 for his votive matinée, and Mr. John McCaull, who had Wallack's\r\nTheatre, selected the same day. \"Never mind, madam,\" said Mr. Aronson;\r\n\"I'll turn away enough people from my doors to fill Wallack's.\" \"Rest\r\nassured, madam,\" said Mr. McCaull, \"I'll turn away enough people\r\nfrom Wallack's to fill the Casino.\" So I had two great matinées on my\r\nhands—fixed for the same day, the same hour.\r\n\r\nI knew it would be vital to my interests to have these initial\r\nentertainments successful. I busied my brain with schemes which I\r\ncunningly revealed to my friends among the merchants. I wanted satin\r\nbanners painted with palms and orange-blossoms for Mr. Aronson and Mr.\r\nMcCaull. I wanted beautiful satin programmes for every man, woman,\r\nand child who played for me, and for all my patronesses. I craved\r\nflowers galore. I longed for fine stationery, white wax, and a seal. I\r\nobtained all these things. So many flowers were sent that baskets and\r\nbouquets were presented to everybody on the stage. The actors caught\r\nthe enthusiasm. Mr. Solomon, who sang the topical song at the Casino,\r\nintroduced happy, appropriate lines. \"Aunt Louisa Eldridge\" opened a\r\nflower sale in the foyer, and made a large sum for the charity. Satin\r\nsouvenirs were given to everybody with the \"Compliments of the Ladies'\r\nJacksonville Relief Society.\" Every note (a personal one written to\r\neach performer) was sealed with white wax and a seal made expressly for\r\nme. Little Fanny Rice was bewitching in Nadjy—singing the pretty Mignon\r\nsong which is borrowed in the play. At Wallack's there was a splendid\r\nprogramme, in which many stars participated—Kyrle Bellew, and others,\r\nand a wonderfully funny balcony scene from \"Romeo and Juliet\"—De Wolf\r\nHopper the Juliet, Jefferson De Angelis the nurse, and Marshall Wilder,\r\nRomeo!\r\n\r\nWhen it was all over, there was one very tired woman on 33d Street. But\r\nnext day the papers announced \"brilliant audience, beautiful mounting,\r\ngrand success.\" Everybody was thanked, by name, through the papers.\r\nMr. Aronson sent me $904.50. Early next morning I was summoned to my\r\nparlor, and before reaching it, I heard a masculine voice: \"Don't be\r\nafraid—speak up now!\" Entering, I was confronted by a wee, winsome\r\nlassie with long curls, great eyes, a lovely little face from which a\r\nbig hat was pushed, while a chubby hand was thrust into mine and a sweet\r\nlittle voice said, \"I'se dot sumsin for you!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the baby girl of Mr. Stevens, the manager of Wallack's, and the\r\n\"sumsin\" was a big roll of bank-notes—$1620—while an honest little hand\r\npresented the silver fraction, 85 cents.\r\n\r\nThis money, $2525, was immediately forwarded to Governor Perry, who\r\nsent it where it was sorely needed,—to the little town of Fernandina\r\nand other small towns in Florida afflicted by the scourge,—Gainsville,\r\nManatee, McClenny, Crawfordsville, and Enterprise. From all these towns,\r\nas well as from Governor Perry, I received (fumigated) letters of thanks\r\nand assurance that every dollar was used to relieve distress!\r\n\r\nFrom that time onward I thought of nothing, worked for nothing—except\r\nthe relief of Jacksonville. I was nothing but a theatrical manager.\r\nIt was the custom of the theatres to present me with the building and\r\nplay—also with a plan of the house and all the tickets. I had to sell\r\nthe seats and boxes, do all the advertising, and meet sundry outside\r\nexpenses—ushers, orchestra, etc. I did all this with little help until\r\nmy friends returned to town, and then Mrs. Egbert Guernsey, Mrs. Barrow,\r\nMrs. Stedman, and Mrs. Botta became my pillars of strength. Each matinée\r\nwas honored as were the first two, with satin programmes, banners, and\r\nflowers, personal notes sealed with white wax, etc. I sat from morning\r\nuntil night at my desk, and my diary, kept at the time, records two\r\nthousand letters written by my own hand. Every theatre gave us a play,\r\nand the Eden Musée a varied entertainment, and Mrs. Sherwood came from\r\nRome to give us two readings.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Daly's turn came, I had some difficulty in selling seats. The\r\npublic had endured a good deal of Jacksonville, and began to say, \"The\r\nRelief Society is still with us,\" or, \"The Jacksonville Relief Society,\r\nlike Banquo's ghost, 'will not down.'\"\r\n\r\nMy dear friend, Mr. Cyrus Field, found me in some anxiety, and sent me\r\nhis clerk every morning to ask how I was \"getting along,\" taking entire\r\nblocks of seats and filling them with his friends.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jeanette Thurber also came in (when I was flagging) with her large\r\nheart and full hands; so our old friends—Mrs. Gilbert, James Lewis, John\r\nDrew, George Clark, Kitty Cheatham, and Ada Rehan—played, as the Jenkins\r\nof the day announced, \"to a large, brilliant, and fashionable house.\"\r\nI added to each of my satin souvenirs for \"the cast\" a quotation from\r\nShakespeare. Ada Rehan played \"The Wife of Socrates\" as an afterpiece.\r\nOn her souvenir was printed in gold:—\r\n\r\n     \"Be she as shrewd\r\n     ... As Socrates' Xantippe,\"\r\n\r\n     \"She hath a tear for Pity, and a hand\r\n     Open as day for melting charity.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the time arrived for Mr. Chickering to give me his hall for a\r\nconcert, I was beginning to feel a little weary, and was glad to enlist\r\nthe interest of Professor Ogden Doremus, formerly president of the\r\nPhilharmonic Society. I wrote letters which brought many offers. \"How\r\nmany?\" asked Dr. Doremus. \"A hatful,\" I answered. We poured them out on\r\na table and made a selection. \"These,\" said the doctor, \"are fine, fine!\r\nBut we must have a star! I'll go out to-morrow and sweep the skies for\r\ncomets. The great planets will not work for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nAt night he wrote me: \"No hope for a star! Everybody wants money! We\r\nmust manage with our amateurs.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day I drove up boldly to the Metropolitan Opera House and asked\r\nfor Mr. Stanton. I told him my story, and begged him to \"help _me_, to\r\nhelp my poor countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you Alvary!\" he exclaimed. \"Nothing is too good for your\r\ncause!\" \"Oh,\" I faltered,—for I was astounded,—\"I'm sure Alvary will not\r\ncondescend to sing with a company of amateurs, to the accompaniment of\r\none piano.\" \"Will not?\" said Mr. Stanton; \"it is my impression Alvary\r\nwill do what I order him to do.\" He continued, however, as Colonel\r\nMapleson had done with Patti, to say that, although this was all\r\ntrue, it would be wise for me to _request_ Alvary to sing. This I did,\r\nreceiving a gracious, acquiescent reply.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shaw, the famous _siffleuse_, had just returned from England,\r\nwhere she had whistled for the Prince of Wales, and I was delighted at\r\nher offer to contribute to the concert. The programme was arranged, Mr.\r\nChickering notified, and twelve hundred tickets sent me to be sold. We\r\nset the stage magnificently, borrowing rugs, choice furniture, pictures,\r\nhangings. We furnished a greenroom with refreshments, cigars, and\r\nflowers,—and a remoter private room for the great tenor,—had the banners\r\nextraordinarily handsome, and advertised our programme for Friday night,\r\nOctober 12.\r\n\r\nEarly Monday morning I received the following note:—\r\n\r\n     \"Herr Max Alvary supposed when he consented to sing for Madame\r\n     Pryor that she would arrange a programme in accordance with\r\n     his social and artistic position.\r\n\r\n     \"Madame Pryor has not done this. Herr Alvary will not sing\r\n     for Madame Pryor.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I recovered my senses after reading this astounding missive, I\r\nreceived the following:—\r\n\r\n     \"Madam; When Mrs. Shaw consented to whistle for you, she\r\n     forgot she was under contract with Mr. Pond. She cannot appear\r\n     on any occasion outside Mr. Pond's series of entertainments.\"\r\n\r\nLight broke upon my clouded vision. _This_—the _siffleuse_, was the\r\noffending one! I wrote at once to Herr Alvary that the number to which\r\nhe had objected was withdrawn. I told the telegraph messenger to wait\r\nfor an answer. He returned after an absence of several hours, and\r\nreported: \"I asked the gentleman for an answer, and he slammed the door\r\nin my face. Then I waited outside till dinner-time!\"\r\n\r\nTuesday, Wednesday, passed. I forbore to annoy Mr. Stanton. It was not\r\nmy will to accept anything against another's will. Herr Alvary might\r\ngo to—France for me! I should certainly not humble myself to him. In\r\nthe meantime, Dr. Doremus tried again and again in vain. Thursday! No\r\nAlvary, no whistler! A pretty way indeed to treat a confiding public\r\nbuying tickets to hear both of them!\r\n\r\nFinally I broke down. I wrote to the naughty boy, and wrote to _his\r\nheart_. I said in conclusion, \"While you hesitate, my countrymen are\r\ndying.\" He had a heart and I found it. I received a prompt answer:—\r\n\r\n     \"MADAME PRYOR:—\r\n\r\n     \"I will sing for you Friday, and I will sing as often as\r\n     the audience wishes. I am sorry for the sorrow I gave you,\r\n     but—Madame Pryor, _you_ know the human voice was never meant\r\n     for whistling!\r\n\r\n                                                   \"Your humble,\r\n                                                       \"MAX ALVARY.\"\r\n\r\nThe concert was fine. He sang as never before, returning again and\r\nagain in response to the enthusiastic recalls of the large audience.\r\nMrs. Sylvanus Reed, who was one of my patronesses on all my programmes,\r\nbrought with her twenty or more of the young ladies of her school. I had\r\nnot required evening dress, but from my lofty seat in the sky gallery I\r\nlooked down upon hundreds of the flower-decked heads of my dear American\r\nfellow-women.\r\n\r\nAfter Alvary's last number, he appeared in a side aisle, sweeping the\r\ngalleries with his opera-glass. \"Mamma,\" said my daughter Fanny, \"that\r\nman is looking for you!\" \"He'll not find me,\" I assured her; \"he never\r\nsaw me.\" \"But a man who has seen you is with him and is helping him!\"\r\nSure enough, the double barrels were soon focussed upon me in my eyrie,\r\nand Alvary, in an impressive manner, waved his hand, laid it upon his\r\nheart, and thrice bowed low.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the last time I saw my naughty, bonny boy Alvary. I was\r\nbidden once to spend my day as pleased me best, as it was my birthday,\r\nand I elected to see \"Siegfried.\" I tied my card to some violets and\r\nthrew them at the feet of the then greatest tenor in the world, and he\r\nrecognized the tribute. Many were the lovely letters I received after\r\nthis delightful concert, one most charming from my dear old friend,\r\nWilliam C. Rives.\r\n\r\nBut the blessed frost soon came to do more for the stricken city than\r\nI could do. I reopened, cleansed, and refurnished St. Luke's Hospital,\r\nsent nearly a thousand dollars to Sister Mary Ann to rehabilitate the\r\nCatholic Hospital, and a similar sum to the Jacksonville Orphanage.\r\nGovernor Perry sent a committee all the way from Florida to thank me,\r\nletters poured in from distant friends, the papers said lovely things\r\nabout my effort. \"Who is the best theatrical manager in New York?\" was\r\nasked of A. M. Palmer. \"Well,\" he replied, \"if you wish a true answer,\r\nI should say Mrs. Pryor!\"\r\n\r\nIn a time of national disaster no other city in the world responds\r\nas does New York. Witness the Galveston flood, when one bazaar I had\r\nthe pleasure of managing yielded $51,000—witness the San Francisco\r\nearthquake! Every heart is warmed with sympathy—every hand open, when\r\nreal trouble, real disaster, overtakes any part of our country. And\r\nnowhere do we find a quicker response than among actors, who are rarely,\r\nif ever, rich, and never lead, as others do, a life of ease.\r\n\r\nThe letters I received from the New York women who had so nobly stood\r\nby me and helped me were, for a long time, delightful reading. They\r\nare still cherished as a reward second only to the crowning reward—the\r\nrelief of suffering—which has comforted me all along the subsequent\r\nyears of my life. They are noble, generous letters, and I wish I could\r\ngive them here, every one, as models of beautiful letters as well. One,\r\nfrom the gifted Mrs. Vincenzo Botta, is an example of the rest:—\r\n\r\n                                  \"25 EAST 37TH STREET, December 13.\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR MRS. PRYOR:—\r\n\r\n     I congratulate you most warmly on the success of your movement\r\n     in the relief of our Jacksonville citizens, for it is you\r\n     alone who have been the moving and animating force of it\r\n     all. It will be a pleasant thing for you to remember always,\r\n     and for us, too, who have followed your lead, though so far\r\n     behind. It will not be possible for me to take the place on\r\n     the committee to which you appoint me. Do take it yourself,\r\n     dear Mrs. Pryor! You _ought_ to do so. Now the burden of this\r\n     work is over, you should not give it into other hands. So I\r\n     beg you earnestly to take my place.\r\n\r\n                                            \"Ever cordially yours,\r\n                                                \"ANNIE C. L. BOTTA.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been suggested that the committee which had exhibited so much\r\nability should not disband, but remain as a permanent organization for\r\nthe relief of sudden national disaster. I had wished to see Mrs. Botta\r\nat the head of this committee.\r\n\r\nWe finally, to our regret ever since, elected to disband. When I\r\nrendered my report and bade my dear co-workers adieu, I told them\r\nsome pleasant truths. Every banner and every blossom had been given\r\nus. The American District Telegraph Company had made no charge for\r\nservice—messengers sent me daily to await orders.\r\n\r\nThe press had been very generous to us. For advertising our\r\nentertainments, all charges were remitted by the _Tribune_, _Herald_,\r\n_Sun_, and other papers. The editors of sixteen New York papers gave\r\nus unstinted praise and encouragement. If they perceived cause for\r\ncriticism, they withheld it. They helped us in every way, and rejoiced\r\nour hearts by the sweet reward of approbation. They said that we were\r\n\"a band of self-denying and gifted women, who add another to the roll\r\nof gracious achievements which do honor to piety and womanhood.\"\r\n\r\nWe could not follow our work in the little towns of Florida, by the cot\r\nof the poor negro or the home of the widow and orphan and destitute. It\r\nshould be enough for us to know that through us some cooling influence\r\nreached their fevered brows, that suitable food and clothing was found\r\nfor them, that their hearts were cheered in a dark hour by perceiving\r\nthat they were not forgotten or friendless. We were told that our\r\nalms for the orphans were in response to the dying prayers of mothers\r\n(a little band of New York children elected to become the guardian\r\nangels of one of these hapless orphans), and we learned that our gift\r\nto the Catholic sisters was larger than any they received from any\r\nother source. We were assured that comfort was restored, pure conduits\r\nfor water constructed, and good food and clothing provided for the\r\nProtestant orphans. We reopened the hospital, needed more than ever in\r\nJacksonville, and about to be closed for want of money. All this was\r\nmuch reward, and we could add to it our own grateful consciousness of\r\nhaving done a noble and worthy deed.\r\n\r\nI shall ever feel the deepest gratitude for my support in this charity;\r\nfor the gift of beloved and honored names,—names never withheld from a\r\nnoble cause,—for generous forbearance towards myself, and for many words\r\nof approbation and encouragement. My heart is full of gratitude, and\r\nfull also of all \"good wishes, praise, and prayers\" for the noble band\r\nof players who made the great work possible.\r\n\r\n\"The little band\" of children who elected to become the guardians of one\r\norphan was the Morning-side Club, their president a very lovely little\r\ngirl—Renée Coudert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1900 a strange disaster befell the beautiful city of\r\nGalveston. A mighty wave lifted its crest far out at sea and marched\r\nstraight on until it engulfed the city. It all happened suddenly,\r\nin a night. Thousands of men, women, and children perished. Hundreds\r\nof babies were born that night, and picked up alive, floating on the\r\nlittle mattresses to which drowning mothers had consigned them. The\r\nCatholic sisters and their orphan charges all perished. The Protestant\r\nOrphan Asylum, on higher ground, had been built around its first room,\r\nand in this central chamber the children were gathered, and spent\r\nthe night in singing their little hymns. The outer rooms received the\r\nshock of the waves, but this small sanctuary remained intact. For many\r\ndays after the waters subsided, children were found wandering in the\r\nstreets—some did not know their own names, others anxiously questioned\r\nthe passer-by—\"Where is my mother? Have you found my papa yet?\"\r\n\r\nThe country rushed to the rescue, not to save—it was too late—but to\r\nsuccor the homeless, relieve the destitute.\r\n\r\nI was summoned one morning to my reception-room, where I found a\r\ncommittee awaiting me from one of the large newspapers in New York.\r\nThey bore a message from the proprietor and editor to the effect that he\r\nwished to open a great bazaar for the relief of Galveston, and begged I\r\nwould consent to manage it. My success for Jacksonville had brought me\r\nthis honor.\r\n\r\nI saw at once that I had an opportunity to accomplish great good. I also\r\nrealized the difficulties I should have to encounter. The bazaar was to\r\nbe worked up from the beginning, and three weeks were allowed me for the\r\ntask. My personal influence in gaining patronage and material could not\r\nbe great—and newspaper influence was an unknown quantity to me. However,\r\n\"nothing venture nothing have.\" The very fact of difficulty stimulated\r\nme, and I consented.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, next day I repaired to my \"place of business,\" a room\r\nin the Waldorf Astoria, and found myself equipped with stenographers,\r\ntypewriters and type-writing machines, a desk for myself, a desk for\r\nmy assisting manager, and plenty of pens, ink, and paper. After a rapid\r\nconsultation, a plan of procedure was adopted: we must have influential\r\npatronesses, we must have competent managers for fifteen booths, and\r\nenlist in our service willing hearts and hands to solicit contributions\r\nof material. This was a great work, but we set about it with energy.\r\nOur troubles soon arose from the number of offers of assistance which\r\npoured in upon us, and the difficulty of selection. Committees were\r\nout of the question. There was no time for any such machinery. To avoid\r\ndelay and complications, I was appointed a committee of one; a die of my\r\nsignature was cut, and everything relative to the booths passed under my\r\nown supervision—every paper was signed with my name, every appointment\r\nmade by me. Our one-room office was soon too small, and three more rooms\r\nadded to it, one for Mrs. Vivian's exclusive use, that she might try\r\nthe voices of the singers who offered their services and decide upon the\r\nrespective merits of the numbers of musicians who generously proffered\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nI wish I could tell of the splendid work my assistants accomplished—Mrs.\r\nDonald McLean, Mrs. John G. Carlisle, good \"Aunt Louisa Eldridge,\" the\r\nactress, Mrs. Timothy Woodruff, Mrs. Gielow, Mrs. Marie Cross Newhaus,\r\nMrs. Wadsworth Vivian, Helen Gardiner, the authoress, Mrs. John Wyeth,\r\nMiss Florence Guernsey—and many others. With such a staff success was\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nBut I knew well this city of New York. I must have prestige. I must have\r\n\"stars,\" and bright ones, on my list of patronesses. To secure them,\r\nat a season when many people of social prominence were in Europe, or\r\nat country places, required numbers of letters and much time. Finally\r\nI made a bold dash for distinction. I remembered that John Van Buren,\r\nwhen asked how he could dare propose marriage to Queen Victoria,\r\nreplied, \"I supposed she would say 'no'—but then she might say 'yes.'\"\r\nI telegraphed her Majesty, laid the cause of the Galveston orphans at\r\nher feet, and craved a word of sympathy in the effort I was making for\r\ntheir relief. Fate was kinder to me than to Mr. Van Buren. She said\r\n\"yes.\" She _did_ sympathize, and \"commanded,\" from Balmoral, that I be\r\nso informed. I then telegraphed the Princess Alexandra, and she answered\r\nmost graciously from Fredensborg. I then secured as patronesses for the\r\nbazaar the Duchess of Marlborough, the Dowager Duchess of Marlborough,\r\nMrs. Cornwallis West, the Baroness Burdett-Coutts, Lady Somerset, Lady\r\nAberdeen, Madame Loubet, Madame Diaz, wife of the Mexican President,\r\nMadame Aspiroz, wife of the Mexican Ambassador. All of these noble\r\nladies sent personal answers, and many of them sums of money. Sir Thomas\r\nLipton heard of the bazaar and sent from England, unsolicited, $500.\r\n\r\nTo this foreign list I was able to add a large number of the New York\r\nnames best known and most highly esteemed with us. With such guarantee\r\nfor the \"tone\" of the bazaar, I was assured of patronage.\r\n\r\nWhen the opening night arrived, however, I was possessed with a\r\nsickening fear lest there should be no audience. A fairy village of\r\nbooths filled the great ball-room at the Waldorf Astoria, and the\r\ngenerous merchants of New York had enriched them with rare and beautiful\r\nthings. Mr. Edward Moran gave one of his famous marines. President Diaz\r\nsent a bronze group from the Paris Exposition, representing a reaper\r\nwith his sickle—his two daughters binding his sheaves. Mr. Stanley\r\nMcCormick purchased this for the office in Chicago of the McCormick\r\nreaper. Rich furs, tiger rugs, opera-cloaks, ladies' hats, silverware,\r\nwatches, jewels, bicycles, a grand piano, and an automobile were\r\nincluded in our collection. I had written General Miles requesting him\r\nto open the bazaar, and he had come from Washington with Mrs. Miles.\r\nWhen I arrived on the opening night I was conducted to the small\r\nball-room, where I found ten or more major-generals in full uniform,\r\nGovernor Sayre from Texas, Mr. Aspiroz, the Mexican Ambassador, who had\r\ncome from Washington to bring us the present from President and Mrs.\r\nDiaz, and ladies of their company. On General Miles's arm, attended by\r\nthese distinguished men and their wives, we proceeded through crowds\r\nof spectators to the lower ball-room. When I entered, I found three\r\nthousand people already assembled! The head of the armies of the\r\nUnited States received a magnificent welcome. From Mrs. Astor's box\r\nhe made the opening address, followed by a most touching narrative\r\nfrom Governor Sayre. My dear Mrs. Carlisle appeared in the box with a\r\nlovely wreath of laurel for General Miles. But I cannot describe the\r\nscene. Nothing like this bazaar has ever been seen in New York. There\r\nhave been others—but without the _cachet_ of military rank at home and\r\nroyalty abroad. Telegrams from Mrs. McKinley; letter and a splendid\r\nsilver present from Admiral and Mrs. Dewey; letter and present of rare\r\nembroidery from _petite_ Madame Wu of the Chinese Embassy; letter and\r\npresent of a silver flask from Madame Dreyfus,—these and many similar\r\nincidents cheered us in the hour of our triumph—an hour, too, of great\r\nbodily weariness.\r\n\r\nWe rang down our curtain with _éclat_—our own Mark Twain just off his\r\nhome-coming steamship responding at once to my letter of invitation, and\r\nmaking a happy speech. From my seat in the low box I looked down upon\r\nthe faces of my sons Roger and Willy, who seemed in anxious conference\r\non some subject. They gave me an encouraging nod. I found they knew,\r\nas I did not, that a committee was coming along the gallery to give me\r\nflowers, pin an emblem on my bosom, say dear things about my work. They\r\nwere anxious lest their tired mother should prove unequal to the short\r\nspeech of thanks demanded of her.\r\n\r\nWe sent $51,000 to Galveston! I was permitted to select a special object\r\nfor this large sum. I suggested the building of an orphan asylum in\r\nwhich should be gathered all homeless orphan children, irrespective of\r\ncreed or country.\r\n\r\nWithin a year the asylum was erected, furnished, and the hapless\r\nchildren gathered under its shelter. The mover in this grand charity\r\nsaid he could never have accomplished it without me—I could have done\r\nnothing without him! He had his friends. He also had his enemies, who\r\nrated his charity as an \"advertisement.\" Of all this I know nothing;\r\nbut I do know that this Orphan Asylum in Galveston was a grand and noble\r\nwork; and my old and valued friend, Mrs. Phœbe Hearst, has reason to be\r\ngrateful that it was given to her son to build it. \"What can we do for\r\nyou?\" was asked of me by one of the managers at its opening. \"Nothing,\"\r\nI answered; \"the work is its own reward. But in the daily prayers of\r\nyour orphan children, let them ask God's blessing upon all those who\r\nhelped to give this home to His homeless children.\"\r\n\r\nGod, I humbly trust, did so bless them all—the eighty-year-old woman\r\non the Pacific slope who sent a kerchief of her own making; the noble\r\nladies across the Atlantic who promptly gave their honored names and\r\ntheir money; the little boy whose curly head I could see, moving among\r\nthe crowd soliciting pennies for the orphans; the good woman whose head\r\nhad grown gray beneath the crown of England.\r\n\r\nBut especially I wish, I pray, all blessings for the band of dear women\r\nwho, coming often in rain and storm, worked with me from morning until\r\nnight to help build a shelter for Galveston's homeless orphans.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: JUDGE ROGER A. PRYOR IN 1900.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe years which had brought me such interesting work were full years\r\nalso to my dear general. In June, 1888, he delivered an address to the\r\ngraduating class at the Albany Law School—an address so inspiring, so\r\nhighly commended at the time, that it should not be lost. He had been\r\nall his life intimately acquainted with the great legal lights abroad.\r\nThey had given him his first aspirations, and been his inspired teachers\r\never after. And yet he could truthfully tell the American student:—\r\n\r\n\"Nor need we travel abroad for examples and illustrations of forensic\r\noratory in its highest perfection; for in the sublime passion of\r\nPatrick Henry, in the gorgeous vehemence of Choate, in the brilliant and\r\nabounding fancy of Prentiss, and in the majestic simplicity of Webster,\r\nwe find at home every beauty and every power of eloquence displayed\r\nwith an effect not inferior to the achievements of the mighty masters\r\nof antiquity.\"\r\n\r\nDiligently as he studied his profession, he found time for lighter, but\r\nnot perhaps really more congenial, occupations. From time to time he\r\naddressed college societies on literary themes. He wrote for the _North\r\nAmerican Review_, the _Forum_, and the \"Encyclopædia Britannica.\" Like\r\nhis public addresses, his writing was said to display ripe scholarship\r\nand a clear, polished style. The highest note was never too high for\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nHe would have had to be \"made all over again,\" had he felt no interest\r\nin politics. He was born, as he often declared, \"a Presbyterian and a\r\nDemocrat,\" and he never faltered in allegiance to either. \"Oh, God guide\r\nus aright,\" prayed a member of the body that framed the Westminster\r\nCatechism, \"_for thou knowest we are very determined_.\" Having set out\r\nin one direction, the worthy brother doubted the power of the Almighty\r\nhimself to alter his course!\r\n\r\nAlthough my Husband refrained from political talk or discussion, he\r\nwas glad to be sent to the convention that nominated Mr. Tilden. But\r\nprobably his first conspicuous appearance on the political theatre was\r\nthe Gubernatorial Convention at Syracuse, of which he drew the platform,\r\nand which resulted in the candidacy of Mr. Cleveland. That platform was\r\nacknowledged to have aided materially in the election of Mr. Cleveland.\r\nIts author's address in presenting it was much applauded.\r\n\r\nJust as I closed my Jacksonville work, my general argued and won his\r\ngreat Sugar Trust case. \"Had he done nothing else,\" said one whose word\r\nmeans much, \"he could point to this case as an enduring monument.\" His\r\nrapid rise to fame at the bar is well known. \"His legal victories would\r\nmake a long list,\" says a contemporary writer, \"but he never shrank\r\nfrom a suit because it was unpopular or because the legal odds were\r\nmany against its success, however just it might be. His deep knowledge\r\nof law, his readiness of resource, his care in preparing his case, his\r\nunfailing good humor, his pluck, ardor, and clearness in pleading,\r\nhave made him influential and successful in the courts.\" Beginning\r\nwith the Tilton-Beecher suit, he was counsel in the Morey Letter case\r\nand the Holland murder trial. He was also engaged in the suits against\r\nGovernor Sprague in Rhode Island, and the Ames impeachment proceedings\r\nin Mississippi. He was the first to win a suit against the Elevated\r\nRailroad Company for damages to adjoining property. He was also counsel\r\nin the Hoyt will case, the Chicago anarchist trials, and now in the\r\nSugar Trust suit, in which he was successful in the New York City courts\r\nas well as in the Court of Appeals. At the time of his direst distress\r\nhe _refused_ a suit against the good Peter Cooper.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1889 that my husband suggested and conducted the suit against\r\nthe Sugar Trust, the first litigation in any court or any state against\r\ncombinations in restraint of trade; and as he was successful against\r\npowerful opposition, he acquired a prestige which was the immediate\r\noccasion of his appointment to the bench.\r\n\r\nOn October 9, 1890, Mr. John Russell Young gave a dinner in his honor\r\nat the Astor House—a dinner notable for the number of distinguished\r\nguests. Among them, Hon. Grover Cleveland, General Sherman, General\r\nSickles, Henry George, Daniel Dougherty, Daniel Lamont, W. J. Florence,\r\nMark Twain, John B. Haskin, Joseph Jefferson, Thomas Nast, Judge Brady,\r\nJudge Joseph F. Daly, Murat Halsted, Senator Hearst,—was ever such a\r\ncompany? Laying his hand on my husband's shoulder, General Sherman said:\r\n\"We would have done all this for him long ago, but he had to be such a\r\nrebel!\"\r\n\r\nHe had been appointed to fill the unexpired term of a retiring judge.\r\nThe next year he came before the people for election, and was chosen\r\nby a great majority of many thousand votes to be judge of the Court\r\nof Pleas, and soon afterwards became judge of the Supreme Court of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nHe was welcomed to the bench by every possible expression of cordial\r\ngood-will, confidence, admiration. Again there was no dissenting voice.\r\nAt a celebration, not long after, of Grant's birthday, he was one\r\nof those invited to speak, and was thus introduced by General Horace\r\nPorter: \"Gentlemen, we have a distinguished general here to-night who\r\nfought with us in the war—but not on the same side. It has been said\r\nthat it is astounding how you like a man after you fight him! That is\r\nthe reason we have him here to-night to give him a warm reception. He\r\nalways gave us a warm reception. He used to take us, and provide for\r\nus, and was willing to keep us out of harm's way while hostilities\r\nlasted—unless sooner exchanged. He was always in the front, and his\r\nfurther appearance in the front to-night is a reflection upon the\r\naccuracy of our marksmanship. Not knowing how to punish him there, we\r\nbrought him up to New York, and sentenced him to fourteen years' hard\r\nlabor on the bench.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought to the bench the habits of self-denial and unremitting study\r\nhe had practised for twenty years. During all that time, and after,\r\nnobody ever saw him at a place of amusement, theatre, ball, or opera,\r\nand very rarely at a dinner-party. He knew no part of New York except\r\nthe streets he traversed to and from his office or court room. His brief\r\nsummer holidays were spent at the White Sulphur Springs in Virginia,\r\nwhere his studies continued. In 1895 he there addressed the Virginia\r\nBar Association on the influence of Virginia in the formation of the\r\nFederal Constitution, and I venture to say that whoever reads it in its\r\nprinted form will find interesting historical facts not generally known.\r\nIn accordance with my plan to permit his contemporaries to tell the\r\nstory of his public life, I copy one testimonial from a Richmond paper:\r\n\"Judge Pryor made a splendid address. It was an ornate, learned, and\r\neminently instructive production, and attested the jealous devotion of a\r\ndistinguished son of Virginia for the old commonwealth, and his careful\r\nstudy of her political history. It did honor to the gentleman who made\r\nthe address and to the profession of which he is a shining light.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever he wrote was always read aloud and copied at home, until my\r\ndaughter Gordon left us, even the legal arguments so dimly understood\r\nby her. Apart from the technical difficulties, she could always\r\nreceive some impression from his argument, and the impression upon her\r\nsingularly clear, unprejudiced mind was what he wished to know. Our own\r\nturn in reading aloud gave him a delicious opportunity to correct our\r\npronunciation. His patience could never brook a mispronounced word—and\r\nalas, after Gordon married I found myself too old that I might learn.\r\nHowever, he patiently continues to struggle with me.\r\n\r\nOnce, at the White Sulphur Springs, a beautiful Virginia girl was\r\nunder my care. My general was absorbed,—it was the summer he made his\r\nspeech,—and did not render the homage to which the pair of blue eyes\r\nwas accustomed. \"I don't think the judge likes me,\" she complained; \"he\r\nnever has a word to say to me. He looks as if he's always thinking about\r\nsomething else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lizzie,\" I suggested, \"you must mispronounce a word or two, and we'll\r\nsee what effect that will have.\" We put our heads together and made\r\nout a list for her to commit to memory. At dinner she fastened her\r\neye upon our victim, and commenced,—offering a flower,—\" It's not very\r\npretty, but the perfume´,—\" \"I beg your pardon, Miss—, per´fume, accent\r\non first syllable!\" he exclaimed. \"Oh, you're _so_ kind, Judge! This\r\njust il´lustrates—\" \"Illus´trate, my dear young lady!—accent on second\r\nsyllable, but pray go on.\" \"I've never had anybody to tell me any of\r\nthese things,\" she moaned. \"If _you_ only would—\" \"With pleasure! A\r\nbeautiful young lady should be perfect in speech, as in all things.\" The\r\nlittle minx played her part to perfection. Presently, overcome with the\r\nludicrous situation, she excused herself, and my dear innocent remarked,\r\nas his admiring eyes followed her, \"An uncommonly sensible girl that!\"\r\n\r\nI enjoyed a bit of newspaper gossip about this peculiarity of my dear\r\ngeneral. A physician was testifying before him in a malpractice case,\r\nand repeatedly used the word \"pare´sis,\" accenting the second syllable.\r\nThe judge exhibited extreme restlessness, and finally ventured, \"Excuse\r\nme—the word you mean is possibly par´esis?\" As the witness proceeded,\r\nthe offence was repeated and again corrected. \"Now, your Honor,\" said\r\nthe offender, \"I concede all wisdom to the bench in legal matters, but\r\nI am a physician, and in the profession the word is pare´sis.\" \"It is\r\npar´esis in my court,\" was the decision promptly handed down, with an\r\nemphasis that forbade appeal.\r\n\r\nI am sorry I cannot record his services to his country and his\r\nprofession during the seven years before he was overtaken by the\r\nage-limit prescribed by New York law—his championship of maligned women,\r\nhis decision that divorce cases should not be tried secretly but must\r\nbe held in open court—now become a law—his restriction of the right of\r\nnaturalization to at least knowledge of the English language. I cannot\r\ngo into these learned subjects as I trust some one of the profession\r\nwill do some day. I only record that my dear general, as was conceded\r\nby every one, fulfilled the sacred trust—\"he was a father to the poor,\r\nand the cause that he knew not he searched out.\"\r\n\r\nThis public recognition of his ability and worth, with its opportunity\r\nfor larger usefulness, came at last as the crown of his long and heroic\r\nstruggle. The war had left him with nothing but a ragged uniform, his\r\nsword, a wife, and seven children,—his health, his occupation, his\r\nplace in the world, gone; his friends and comrades slain in battle;\r\nhis Southern home impoverished and desolate. He had no profession, no\r\nrights as a citizen, no ability to hold office. That he conquered the\r\nfate which threatened to destroy him,—and conquered it through the\r\nappreciation awarded by his sometime enemies,—is a striking illustration\r\nof the possibilities afforded by our country; where not only can the\r\nimpoverished refugee from other lands find fortune and happiness, but\r\nwhere her own sons, prostrate and ruined after a dreadful fratricidal\r\nstrife, can bind their wounds, take up their lives again, and finally\r\nwin reward for their labors.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY MRS.
