ACKERMAN\r\n\r\nNew York\r\nGeorge H. Doran Company\r\n\r\n1917\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe title \"GERMANY, THE NEXT REPUBLIC?\" is chosen because the author\r\nbelieves this must be the goal, the battlecry, of the United States and\r\nher Allies.  As long as the Kaiser, his generals and the present\r\nleaders are in control of Germany's destinies the world will encounter\r\nthe same terrorism that it has had to bear during the war.  Permanent\r\npeace will follow the establishment of a Republic.  But the German\r\npeople will not overthrow the present government until the leaders are\r\ndefeated and discredited.  Today the Reichstag Constitutional\r\ncommittee, headed by Herr Scheidemann, is preparing reforms in the\r\norganic law but so far all proposals are mere makeshifts.  The world\r\ncannot afford to consider peace with Germany until the people rule.\r\nThe sooner the United States and her Allies tell this to the German\r\npeople officially the sooner we shall have peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Frontispiece: A document circulated by \"The League of Truth\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nI was at the White House on the 29th of June, 1914, when the newspapers\r\nreported the assassination of the Archduke and Archduchess of Austria.\r\nIn August, when the first declarations of war were received, I was\r\nassigned by the United Press Associations to \"cover\" the belligerent\r\nembassies and I met daily the British, French, Belgian, Italian,\r\nGerman, Austro-Hungarian, Turkish and Japanese diplomats.  When\r\nPresident Wilson went to New York, to Rome, Georgia, to Philadephia and\r\nother cities after the outbreak of the war, I accompanied him as one of\r\nthe Washington correspondents.  On these journeys and in Washington I\r\nhad an opportunity to observe the President, to study his methods and\r\nideas, and to hear the comment of the European ambassadors.\r\n\r\nWhen the von Tirpitz blockade of England was announced in February,\r\n1915, I was asked to go to London where I remained only one month.\r\nFrom March, 1915, until the break in diplomatic relations I was the war\r\ncorrespondent for the United Press within the Central Powers.  In\r\nBerlin, Vienna and Budapest, I met the highest government officials,\r\nleading business men and financiers.  I knew Secretaries of State Von\r\nJagow and Zimmermann; General von Kluck, who drove the German first\r\narmy against Paris in August, 1914; General von Falkenhayn, former\r\nChief of the General Staff; Philip Scheidemann, leader of the Reichstag\r\nSocialists; Count Stefan Tisza, Minister President of Hungary and Count\r\nAlbert Apponyi.\r\n\r\nWhile my headquarters were in Berlin, I made frequent journeys to the\r\nfront in Belgium, France, Poland, Russia and Roumania.  Ten times I was\r\non the battlefields during important military engagements.  Verdun, the\r\nSomme battlefield, General Brusiloff's offensive against Austria and\r\nthe invasion of Roumania, I saw almost as well as a soldier.\r\n\r\nAfter the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and the beginning of critical\r\nrelations with the United States I was in constant touch with James W.\r\nGerard, the American Ambassador, and the Foreign Office.  I followed\r\nclosely the effects of American political intervention until February\r\n10th, 1917.  Frequent visits to Holland and Denmark gave me the\r\nimpressions of those countries regarding President Wilson and the\r\nUnited States.  En route to Washington with Ambassador Gerard, I met in\r\nBerne, Paris and Madrid, officials and people who interpreted the\r\naffairs in these countries.\r\n\r\nSo, from the beginning of the war until today, I have been at the\r\nstrategic points as our relations with Germany developed and came to a\r\nclimax.  At the beginning of the war I was sympathetic with Germany,\r\nbut my sympathy changed to disgust as I watched developments in Berlin\r\nchange the German people from world citizens to narrow-minded,\r\ndeceitful tools of a ruthless government.  I saw Germany outlaw\r\nherself.  I saw the effects of President Wilson's notes.  I saw the\r\nanti-American propaganda begin.  I saw the Germany of 1915 disappear.\r\nI saw the birth of lawless Germany.\r\n\r\nIn this book I shall try to take the reader from Washington to Berlin\r\nand back again, to show the beginning and the end of our diplomatic\r\nrelations with the German government.  I believe that the United States\r\nby two years of patience and note-writing, has done more to accomplish\r\nthe destruction of militarism and to encourage freedom of thought in\r\nGermany than the Allies did during nearly three years of fighting.  The\r\nUnited States helped the German people think for themselves, but being\r\nchildren in international affairs, the people soon accepted the\r\ninspired thinking of the government.  Instead of forcing their opinions\r\nupon the rulers until results were evident, they chose to follow with\r\nblind faith their military gods.\r\n\r\nThe United States is now at war with Germany because the Imperial\r\nGovernment willed it.  The United States is at war to aid the movement\r\nfor democracy in Germany; to help the German people realize that they\r\nmust think for themselves.  The seeds of democratic thought which\r\nWilson's notes sowed in Germany are growing.  If the Imperial\r\nGovernment had not frightened the people into a belief that too much\r\nthinking would be dangerous for the Fatherland, the United States would\r\nnot today be at war with the Kaiser's government.  Only one thing now\r\nwill make the people realize that they must think for themselves if\r\nthey wish to exist as a nation and as a race.  That is a military\r\ndefeat, a defeat on the battlefields of the Kaiser, von Hindenburg and\r\nthe Rhine Valley ammunition interests.  Only a decisive defeat will\r\nshake the public confidence in the nation's leaders.  Only a destroyed\r\nGerman army leadership will make the people overthrow the group of men\r\nwho do Germany's political thinking to-day.\r\n\r\n            C. W.

It is a large, brick\r\nbuilding in the Franzoesischestrasse guarded, day and night, by\r\nsoldiers.  The sidewalks outside the building are barricaded.  Without\r\na pass no one can enter.  Foreign correspondents in Berlin, when they\r\nhad telegrams to send to their newspapers, frequently took them from\r\nthe Foreign Office to the Chief Telegraph Office personally in order to\r\nspeed them on their way to the outside world.  The censored despatches\r\nwere sealed in a Foreign Office envelope.  With this credential\r\ncorrespondents were permitted to enter the building and the room where\r\nall telegrams are passed by the military authorities.\r\n\r\nDuring my two years' stay in Berlin I went to the telegraph office\r\nseveral times every week.  Often I had to wait while the military\r\ncensor read my despatches.  On a large bulletin board in this room, I\r\nsaw, and often read, documents posted for the information of the\r\ntelegraph officials.  During one of my first waiting periods I read an\r\noriginal document relating to the events at the beginning of the war.\r\nThis was a typewritten letter signed by the Director of the Post and\r\nTelegraph.  Because I was always watched by a soldier escort, I could\r\nnever copy it.  But after reading it scores of times I soon memorised\r\neverything, including the periods.\r\n\r\nThis document was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Office of the Imperial Post & Telegraph\r\n        August 2nd, 1914.\r\n\r\n  Announcement No. 3.\r\n\r\nTo the Chief Telegraph Office:\r\n\r\nFrom to-day on, the Post and Telegraph communications between Germany\r\non the one hand and:\r\n\r\n  1. England,\r\n  2. France,\r\n  3. Russia,\r\n  4. Japan,\r\n  5. Belgium,\r\n  6. Italy,\r\n  7. Montenegro,\r\n  8. Servia,\r\n  9. Portugal;\r\n\r\non the other hand are interrupted because Germany finds herself in a\r\nstate of war.\r\n\r\n(Signed) Director of the Post and Telegraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis notice, which was never published, shows that the man who directed\r\nthe Post and Telegraph Service of the Imperial Government knew on the\r\n2nd of August, 1914, who Germany's enemies would be.  Of the eleven\r\nenemies of Germany to-day only Roumania and the United States were not\r\nincluded.  If the Director of the Post and Telegraph knew what to\r\nexpect, it is certain that the Imperial Government knew.  This\r\nannouncement shows that Germany expected war with nine different\r\nnations, but at the time it was posted on the bulletin board of the\r\nHaupttelegraphenamt, neither Italy, Japan, Belgium nor Portugal had\r\ndeclared war.  Italy did not declare war until nearly a year and a half\r\nafterwards, Portugal nearly two years afterward and Japan not until\r\nDecember, 1914.\r\n\r\nThis document throws an interesting light upon the preparations Germany\r\nmade for a world war.\r\n\r\nThe White, Yellow, Grey and Blue Books, which all of the belligerents\r\npublished after the beginning of the war, dealt only with the attempts\r\nof these nations to prevent the war.  None of the nations has as yet\r\npublished white books to show how it prepared for war, and still, every\r\nnation in Europe had been expecting and preparing for a European\r\nconflagration.  Winston Churchill, when he was First Lord of the\r\nAdmiralty, stated at the beginning of the war that England's fleet was\r\nmobilised.  France had contributed millions of francs to fortify the\r\nRussian border in Poland, although Germany had made most of the guns.\r\nBelgium had what the Kaiser called, \"a contemptible little army\" but\r\nthe soldiers knew how to fight when the invaders came.  Germany had new\r\n42 cm. guns and a network of railroads which operated like shuttles\r\nbetween the Russian and French and Belgian frontiers.  Ever since 1870\r\nEurope had been talking war.  Children were brought up and educated\r\ninto the belief that some day war would come.  Most people considered\r\nit inevitable, although not every one wanted it.\r\n\r\nDuring the exciting days of August, 1914, I was calling at the\r\nbelligerent embassies and legations in Washington.  Neither M.\r\nJusserand, the French Ambassador, nor Sir Cecil Spring-Rice, the\r\nBritish Ambassador, nor Count von Bernstorff, the Kaiser's\r\nrepresentative, were in Washington then.  But it was not many weeks\r\nuntil all three had hastened to this country from Europe.  Almost the\r\nfirst act of the belligerents was to send their envoys to Washington.\r\n\r\nAs I met these men I was in a sense an agent of public opinion who\r\ncalled each day to report the opinions of the belligerents to the\r\nreaders of American newspapers.  One day at the British Embassy I was\r\ngiven copies of the White Book and of many other documents which Great\r\nBritain had issued to show how she tried to avoid the war.  In\r\nconversations later with Ambassador von Bernstorff, I was given the\r\nGerman viewpoint.\r\n\r\nThe thing which impressed me at the time was the desire of these\r\nofficials to get their opinions before the American people.  But why\r\ndid these ambassadors want the standpoints of their governments\r\nunderstood over here?  Why was the United States singled out of all\r\nother neutrals?  If all the belligerents really wanted to avoid war,\r\nwhy did they not begin twenty years before, to prevent it, instead of,\r\nto prepare for it?\r\n\r\nAll the powers issued their official documents for one primary\r\npurpose--to win public opinion.  First, it was necessary for each\r\ncountry to convince its own people that their country was being\r\nattacked and that their leaders had done everything possible to avoid\r\nwar.  Even in Europe people would not fight without a reason.  The\r\nGerman Government told the people that unless the army was mobilised\r\nimmediately Russia would invade and seize East Prussia.  England,\r\nFrance and Belgium explained to their people that Germany was out to\r\nconquer the world by way of Belgium and France.  But White Books were\r\nnot circulated alone in Europe; they were sent by the hundreds of\r\nthousands into the United States and translated into every known\r\nlanguage so that the people of the whole world could read them.\r\n\r\nThen the word battles between the Allies and the Central Powers began\r\nin the United States.  While the soldiers fought on the battlefields of\r\nBelgium, France, East Prussia and Poland, an equally bitter struggle\r\nwas carried on in the United States.  In Europe the object was to stop\r\nthe invaders.  In America the goal was public opinion.\r\n\r\nIt was not until several months after the beginning of the war that Sir\r\nEdward Grey and Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg began to discuss what\r\nthe two countries had done before the war, to avoid it.  The only thing\r\neither nation could refer to was the 1912 Conference between Lord\r\nHaldane and the Chancellor.  This was the only real attempt made by the\r\ntwo leading belligerents to come to an understanding to avoid\r\ninevitable bloodshed.  Discussions of these conferences were soon\r\nhushed up in Europe because of the bitterness of the people against\r\neach other.  The Hymn of Hate had stirred the German people and the\r\nZeppelin raids were beginning to sow the seeds of determination in the\r\nhearts of the British.  It was too late to talk about why the war was\r\nnot prevented.  So each set of belligerents had to rely upon the\r\nofficial documents at the beginning of the war to show what was done to\r\navoid it.\r\n\r\nThese White Books were written to win public opinion.  But why were the\r\npeople _suddenly_ taken into the confidence of their governments?  Why\r\nhad the governments of England, France, Germany and Russia not been so\r\nfrank before 1914?  Why had they all been interested in making the\r\npeople speculate as to what would come, and how it would come about?\r\nWhy were all the nations encouraging suspicion?  Why did they always\r\nquestion the motives, as well as the acts, of each other?  Is it\r\npossible that the world progressed faster than the governments and that\r\nthe governments suddenly realised that public opinion was the biggest\r\nfactor in the world?  Each one knew that a war could not be waged\r\nwithout public support and each one knew that the sympathy of the\r\noutside world depended more upon public opinion than upon business or\r\nmilitary relations.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHow America Was Shocked by the War\r\n\r\nPrevious to July, 1914, the American people had thought very little\r\nabout a European war.  While the war parties and financiers of Europe\r\nhad been preparing a long time for the conflict, people over here had\r\nbeen thinking about peace.  Americans discussed more of the\r\npossibilities of international peace and arbitration than war.\r\nEuropeans lived through nothing except an expectancy of war.  Even the\r\npeople knew who the enemies might be.  The German government, as the\r\nannouncement of the Post and Telegraph Director shows, knew nine of its\r\npossible enemies before war had been declared.  So it was but natural,\r\nwhen the first reports reached the United States saying that the\r\ngreatest powers of Europe were engaged in a death struggle, that people\r\nwere shocked and horrified.  And it was but natural for thousands of\r\nthem to besiege President Wilson with requests for him to offer his\r\nservices as a mediator.\r\n\r\nThe war came, too, during the holiday season in Europe.  Over 90,000\r\nAmericans were in the war zones.  The State Department was flooded with\r\ntelegrams.  Senators and Congressmen were urged to use their influence\r\nto get money to stranded Americans to help them home.  The 235 U.S.\r\ndiplomatic and consular representatives were asked to locate Americans\r\nand see to their comfort and safety.  Not until Americans realised how\r\nclosely they were related to Europe could they picture themselves as\r\nhaving a direct interest in the war.  Then the stock market began to\r\ntumble.  The New York Stock Exchange was closed.  South America asked\r\nNew York for credit and supplies, and neutral Europe, as well as China\r\nin the Far East, looked to the United States to keep the war within\r\nbounds.  Uncle Sam became the Atlas of the world and nearly every\r\nbelligerent requested this government to take over its diplomatic and\r\nconsular interests in enemy countries.  Diplomacy, commerce, finance\r\nand shipping suddenly became dependent upon this country.  Not only the\r\nbelligerents but the neutrals sought the leadership of a nation which\r\ncould look after all the interests, except those of purely military and\r\nnaval operations.  The eyes of the world centred upon Washington.\r\nPresident Wilson, as the official head of the government, was signalled\r\nout as the one man to help them in their suffering and to listen to\r\ntheir appeals.  The belligerent governments addressed their protests\r\nand their notes to Wilson.  Belgium sent a special commission to gain\r\nthe President's ear.  The peace friends throughout the world, even\r\nthose in the belligerent countries, looked to Wilson for guidance and\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1914, Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, the President's wife, was\r\ndangerously ill.  I was at the White House every day to report the\r\ndevelopments there for the United Press.  On the evening of the 5th of\r\nAugust Secretary Tumulty called the correspondents and told them that\r\nthe President, who was deeply distressed by the war, and who was\r\nsuffering personally because of his wife's illness, had written at his\r\nwife's bedside the following message:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As official head of one of the powers signatory to The Hague\r\nConvention, I feel it to be my privilege and my duty, under Article III\r\nof that Convention, to say to you in the spirit of most earnest\r\nfriendship that I should welcome an opportunity to act in the interests\r\nof European peace, either now or at any other time that might be\r\nthought more suitable, as an occasion to serve you and all concerned in\r\na way that would afford me lasting cause for gratitude and happiness.\r\n\r\n         \"(Signed) WOODROW WILSON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Secretary cabled this to the Emperors of Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary; the King of England, the Czar of Russia and the\r\nPresident of France.  The President's brief note touched the chord of\r\nsympathy of the whole world; but it was too late then to stop the war.\r\nEuropean statesmen had been preparing for a conflict.  With the public\r\nsupport which each nation had, each government wanted to fight until\r\nthere was a victory.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things which seemed to appeal to President Wilson was\r\nthe fact that not only public opinion of Europe, but of America, sought\r\na spokesman.  Unlike Roosevelt, who led public opinion, unlike Taft,\r\nwho disregarded it, Wilson took the attitude that the greatest force in\r\nthe world was public opinion.  He believed public opinion was greater\r\nthan the presidency.  He felt that he was the man the American people\r\nhad chosen to interpret and express their opinion.  Wilson's policy was\r\nto permit public opinion to rule America.  Those of us who spent two\r\nyears in Germany could see this very clearly.\r\n\r\nThe President announced the plank for his international policy when he\r\nspoke at the annual meeting of the American Bar Association, at\r\nWashington, shortly after the war began.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First page of the author's passport.]\r\n\r\n\"_The opinion of the world is the mistress of the world_,\" he said,\r\n\"and the processes of international law are the slow processes by which\r\nopinion works its will.  What impresses me is the constant thought that\r\nthat is the tribunal at the bar of which we all sit.  I would call your\r\nattention, incidentally, to the circumstance that it does not observe\r\nthe ordinary rules of evidence; which has sometimes suggested to me\r\nthat the ordinary rules of evidence had shown some signs of growing\r\nantique.  Everything, rumour included, is heard in this court, and the\r\nstandard of judgment is not so much the character of the testimony as\r\nthe character of the witness.  The motives are disclosed, the purposes\r\nare conjectured and that opinion is finally accepted which seems to be,\r\nnot the best founded in law, perhaps, but the best founded in integrity\r\nof character and of morals.  That is the process which is slowly\r\nworking its will upon the world; and what we should be watchful of is\r\nnot so much jealous interests as sound principles of action.  The\r\ndisinterested course is not alone the biggest course to pursue; but it\r\nis in the long run the most profitable course to pursue.  If you can\r\nestablish your character you can establish your credit.\r\n\r\n\"Understand me, gentlemen, I am not venturing in this presence to\r\nimpeach the law.  For the present, by the force of circumstances, I am\r\nin part the embodiment of the law and it would be very awkward to\r\ndisavow myself.  But I do wish to make this intimation, that in this\r\ntime of world change, in this time when we are going to find out just\r\nhow, in what particulars, and to what extent the real facts of human\r\nlife and the real moral judgments of mankind prevail, it is worth while\r\nlooking inside our municipal law and seeing whether the judgments of\r\nthe law are made square with the moral judgments of mankind.  For I\r\nbelieve that we are custodians of the spirit of righteousness, of the\r\nspirit of equal handed justice, of the spirit of hope which believes in\r\nthe perfectibility of the law with the perfectibility of human life\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"Public life, like private life, would be very dull and dry if it were\r\nnot for this belief in the essential beauty of the human spirit and the\r\nbelief that the human spirit should be translated into action and into\r\nordinance.  Not entire.  You cannot go any faster than you can advance\r\nthe average moral judgment of the mass, but you can go at least as fast\r\nas that, and you can see to it that you do not lag behind the average\r\nmoral judgments of the mass.  I have in my life dealt with all sorts\r\nand conditions of men, and I have found that the flame of moral\r\njudgment burns just as bright in the man of humble life and limited\r\nexperience as in the scholar and man of affairs.  And I would like his\r\nvoice always to be heard, not as a witness, not as speaking in his own\r\ncase, but as if he were the voice of men in general, in our courts of\r\njustice, as well as the voice of the lawyers, remembering what the law\r\nhas been.  My hope is that, being stirred to the depths by the\r\nextraordinary circumstances of the time in which we live, we may\r\nrecover from those steps something of a renewal of that vision of the\r\nlaw with which men may be supposed to have started out in the old days\r\nof the oracles, who commune with the intimations of divinity.\"\r\n\r\nBefore this war, very few nations paid any attention to public opinion.\r\nFrance was probably the beginner.  Some twenty years before 1914,\r\nFrance began to extend her civilisation to Russia, Italy, the Balkans\r\nand Syria.  In Roumania, today, one hears almost as much French as\r\nRoumanian spoken.  Ninety per cent of the lawyers in Bucharest were\r\neducated in Paris.  Most of the doctors in Roumania studied in France.\r\nFrance spread her influence by education.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that the belligerents tried to mobilise public opinion in\r\nthe United States in their favour shows that 1914 was a milestone in\r\ninternational affairs.  This was the first time any foreign power ever\r\nattempted to fight for the good will--the public opinion--of this\r\nnation.  The governments themselves realised the value of public\r\nopinion in their own boundaries, but when the war began they realised\r\nthat it was a power inside the realms of their neighbours, too.\r\n\r\nWhen differences of opinion developed between the United States and the\r\nbelligerents the first thing President Wilson did was to publish all\r\nthe documents and papers in the possession of the American government\r\nrelating to the controversy.  The publicity which the President gave\r\nthe diplomatic correspondence between this government and Great Britain\r\nover the search and seizure of vessels emphasised in Washington this\r\ntendency in our foreign relations.  At the beginning of England's\r\nseizure of American merchantmen carrying cargoes to neutral European\r\ncountries, the State Department lodged individual protests, but no heed\r\nwas paid to them by the London officials.  Then the United States made\r\npublic the negotiations seeking to accomplish by publicity what a\r\nprevious exchange of diplomatic notes failed to do.\r\n\r\nDiscussing this action of the President in an editorial on \"Diplomacy\r\nin the Dark,\" the New York _World_ said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"President Wilson's protest to the British Government is a clear,\r\ntemperate, courteous assertion of the trade rights of neutral countries\r\nin time of war.  It represents not only the established policy of the\r\nUnited States but the established policy of Great Britain.  It voices\r\nthe opinion of practically all the American people, and there are few\r\nEnglishmen, even in time of war, who will take issue with the\r\nprinciples upheld by the President.  Yet a serious misunderstanding was\r\nrisked because it is the habit of diplomacy to operate in the dark.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, President Wilson by making the note public prevented the\r\noriginal misunderstanding from spreading.  But the lesson ought not to\r\nstop there.  Our State Department, as Mr. Wickersham recently pointed\r\nout in a letter to the _World_, has never had a settled policy of\r\npublicity in regard to our diplomatic affairs.  No Blue Books or White\r\nBooks are ever issued.  What information the country obtains must be\r\npried out of the Department.  This has been our diplomatic policy for\r\nmore than a century, and it is a policy that if continued will some day\r\nend disastrously.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking in Atlanta in 1912, President Wilson stated that this\r\ngovernment would never gain another foot of territory by conquest.\r\nThis dispelled whatever apprehension there was that the United States\r\nmight seek to annex Mexico.  Later, in asking Congress to repeal the\r\nPanama Tolls Act of 1912, the President said the good will of Europe\r\nwas a more valuable asset than commercial advantages gained by\r\ndiscriminatory legislation.\r\n\r\nThus at the outset of President Wilson's first administration, foreign\r\npowers were given to understand that Mr. Wilson believed in the power\r\nof public opinion; that he favoured publicity as a means of\r\naccomplishing what could not be done by confidential negotiations; that\r\nhe did not believe in annexation and that he was ready at any time to\r\nhelp end the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBefore the Blockade\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson's policy during the first six months of the war was\r\none of impartiality and neutrality.  The first diplomatic\r\nrepresentative in Washington to question the sincerity of the executive\r\nwas Dr. Constantine Dumba, the exiled Austro-Hungarian Ambassador, who\r\nwas sent to the United States because he was not a noble, and,\r\ntherefore, better able to understand and interpret American ways!  He\r\nasked me one day whether I thought Wilson was neutral.  He said he had\r\nbeen told the President was pro-English.  He believed, he said, that\r\neverything the President had done so far showed he sympathised with the\r\nEntente.  While we were talking I recalled what the President's\r\nstenographer, Charles L. Swem, said one day when we were going to New\r\nYork with the President.\r\n\r\n\"I am present at every conference the President holds,\" he stated.  \"I\r\ntake all his dictation.  I think he is the most neutral man in America.\r\nI have never heard him express an opinion one way or the other, and if\r\nhe had I would surely know of it.\"\r\n\r\nI told Dr. Dumba this story, which interested him, and he made no\r\ncomments.\r\n\r\nAs I was at the White House nearly every day I had an opportunity to\r\nlearn what the President would say to callers and friends, although I\r\nwas seldom privileged to use the information.  Even now I do not recall\r\na single statement which ever gave me the impression that the President\r\nsided with one group of belligerents.\r\n\r\nThe President's sincerity and firm desire for neutrality was emphasised\r\nin his appeal to \"My Countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people of the United States,\" he said, \"are drawn from many\r\nnations, and chiefly from the nations now at war.  It is natural and\r\ninevitable that there should be the utmost variety of sympathy and\r\ndesire among them with regard to the issues and circumstances of the\r\nconflict.  Some will wish one nation, others another, to succeed in the\r\nmomentous struggle.  It will be easy to excite passion and difficult to\r\nallay it.  Those responsible for exciting it will assume a heavy\r\nresponsibility, responsibility for no less a thing than that the people\r\nof the United States, whose love of their country and whose loyalty to\r\nthe government should unite them as Americans all, bound in honour and\r\naffection to think first of her and her interests, may be divided in\r\ncamps of hostile opinion, hot against each other, involved in the war\r\nitself in impulse and opinion, if not in action.\r\n\r\n\"My thought is of America.  I am speaking, I feel sure, the earnest\r\nwish and purpose of every thoughtful American that this great country\r\nof ours, which is of course the first in our thoughts and in our\r\nhearts, should show herself in this time of peculiar trial a nation fit\r\nbeyond others to exhibit the fine poise of undisturbed judgment, the\r\ndignity of self-control, the efficiency of dispassionate action; a\r\nnation that neither sits in judgment upon others nor is disturbed in\r\nher own counsels and which keeps herself fit and free to do what is\r\nhonest and disinterested and truly serviceable for the peace of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nMany Americans believed even early in the war that the United States\r\nshould have protested against the invasion of Belgium.  Others thought\r\nthe government should prohibit the shipments of war supplies to the\r\nbelligerents.  America _was_ divided by the great issues in Europe, but\r\nthe great majority of Americans believed with the President, that the\r\nbest service Uncle Sam could render would be to help bring about peace.\r\n\r\nUntil February, 1915, when the von Tirpitz submarine blockade of\r\nEngland was proclaimed, only American interests, not American lives,\r\nhad been drawn into the war.  But when the German Admiralty announced\r\nthat neutral as well as belligerent ships in British waters would be\r\nsunk without warning, there was a new and unexpected obstacle to\r\nneutrality.  The high seas were as much American as British.  The\r\noceans were no nation's property and they could not justly be used as\r\nbattlegrounds for ruthless warfare by either belligerent.\r\n\r\nGermany, therefore, was the first to challenge American neutrality.\r\nGermany was the first to threaten American lives.  Germany, which was\r\nthe first to show contempt for Wilson, forced the President, as well as\r\nthe people, to alter policies and adapt American neutrality to a new\r\nand grave danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\"PIRATES SINK ANOTHER NEUTRAL SHIP\"\r\n\r\nOn February 4th, 1915, the _Reichsanzeiger_, the official newspaper of\r\nGermany, published an announcement declaring that from the 18th of\r\nFebruary \"all the waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland as well\r\nas the entire English channel are hereby declared to be a war area.\r\nAll ships of the enemy mercantile marine found in these waters will be\r\ndestroyed and it will not always be possible to avoid danger to the\r\ncrews and passengers thereon.\r\n\r\n\"_Neutral shipping is also in danger in the war area_, as owing to the\r\nsecret order issued by the British Admiralty January 31st, 1915,\r\nregarding the misuse of neutral flags, and the chances of naval\r\nwarfare, it can happen that attacks directed against enemy ships may\r\ndamage neutral vessels.\r\n\r\n\"The shipping route around the north of The Shetlands in the east of\r\nthe North Sea and over a distance of thirty miles along the coast of\r\nThe Netherlands will not be dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the announcement was signed by Admiral von Pohl, Chief of the\r\nAdmiralty Staff, the real author of the blockade was Grand Admiral von\r\nTirpitz.  In explanation of the announcement the Teutonic-Allied,\r\nneutral and hostile powers were sent a memorandum which contained the\r\nfollowing paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The German Government announces its intention in good time so that\r\nhostile _as well as neutral_ ships can take necessary precautions\r\naccordingly.  Germany expects that the neutral powers will show the\r\nsame consideration for Germany's vital interests as for those of\r\nEngland, and will aid in keeping their citizens and property from this\r\narea.  This is the more to be expected, as it must be to the interests\r\nof the neutral powers to see this destructive war end as soon as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 12th the American Ambassador, James W. Gerard, handed\r\nSecretary of State von Jagow a note in which the United States said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This Government views these possibilities with such grave concern that\r\nit feels it to be its privilege, and indeed its duty in the\r\ncircumstances, to request the Imperial German Government to consider\r\nbefore action is taken the critical situation in respect of the\r\nrelations between this country and Germany which might arise were the\r\nGerman naval officers, in carrying out the policy foreshadowed in the\r\nAdmiralty's proclamation, to destroy any merchant vessel of the United\r\nStates or cause the death of American citizens.\r\n\r\n\"It is of course unnecessary to remind the German Government that the\r\nsole right of a belligerent in dealing with neutral vessels on the high\r\nseas is limited to visit and search, unless a blockade is proclaimed\r\nand effectively maintained, which the Government of the United States\r\ndoes not understand to be proposed in this case.  To declare and\r\nexercise the right to attack and destroy any vessel entering a\r\nprescribed area of the high seas without first accurately determining\r\nits belligerent nationality and the contraband character of its cargo,\r\nwould be an act so unprecedented in naval warfare that this Government\r\nis reluctant to believe that the Imperial German Government in this\r\ncase contemplates it as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI sailed from New York February 13th, 1915, on the first American\r\npassenger liner to run the von Tirpitz blockade.  On February 20th we\r\npassed Queenstown and entered the Irish Sea at night.  Although it was\r\nmoonlight and we could see for miles about us, every light on the ship,\r\nexcept the green and red port and starboard lanterns, was extinguished.\r\nAs we sailed across the Irish Sea, silently and cautiously as a muskrat\r\nswims on a moonlight night, we received a wireless message that a\r\nsubmarine, operating off the mouth of the Mersey River, had sunk an\r\nEnglish freighter.  The captain was asked by the British Admiralty to\r\nstop the engines and await orders.  Within an hour a patrol boat\r\napproached and escorted us until the pilot came aboard early the next\r\nmorning.  No one aboard ship slept.  Few expected to reach Liverpool\r\nalive, but the next afternoon we were safe in one of the numerous snug\r\nwharves of that great port.\r\n\r\nA few days later I arrived in London.  As I walked through Fleet street\r\nnewsboys were hurrying from the press rooms carrying orange-coloured\r\nplacards with the words in big black type: \"Pirates Sink Another\r\nNeutral Ship.\"\r\n\r\nUntil the middle of March I remained in London, where the wildest\r\nrumours were afloat about the dangers off the coast of England, and\r\nwhere every one was excited and expectant over the reports that Germany\r\nwas starving.  I was urged by friends and physicians not to go to\r\nGermany because it was universally believed in Great Britain that the\r\nwar would be over in a very short time.  On the 15th of March I crossed\r\nfrom Tilbury to Rotterdam.  At Tilbury I saw pontoon bridges across the\r\nThames, patrol boats and submarine chasers rushing back and forth\r\nwatching for U-boats, which might attempt to come up the river.  I\r\nboarded the _Batavia IV_ late at night and left Gravesend at daylight\r\nthe next morning for Holland.  Every one was on deck looking for\r\nsubmarines and mines.  The channel that day was as smooth as a small\r\nlake, but the terrible expectation that submarines might sight the\r\nDutch ship made every passenger feel that the submarine war was as real\r\nas it was horrible.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of March, arriving at the little German border town of\r\nBentheim, I met for the first time the people who were already branded\r\nas \"Huns and Barbarians\" by the British and French.  Officers and\r\npeople, however, were not what they had been pictured to be.  Neither\r\nwas Germany starving.  The officials and inspectors were courteous and\r\npatient and permitted me to take into Germany not only British\r\nnewspapers, but placards which pictured the Germans as pirates.  Two\r\ndays later, while walking down Unter den Linden, poor old women, who\r\nwere already taking the places of newsboys, sold German extras with\r\nstreaming headlines: \"British Ships Sunk.  Submarine War Successful.\"\r\nIn front of the _Lokal Anzeiger_ building stood a large crowd reading\r\nthe bulletins about the progress of the von Tirpitz blockade.\r\n\r\nFor luncheon that day I had the choice of as many foods as I had had in\r\nLondon.  The only thing missing was white bread, for Germany, at the\r\nbeginning of the war, permitted only Kriegsbrot (war bread) to be baked.\r\n\r\nAll Berlin streets were crowded and busy.  Military automobiles,\r\nauto-trucks, big moving vans, private automobiles, taxi-cabs and\r\ncarriages hurried hither and thither.  Soldiers and officers, seemingly\r\nby the thousands, were parading up and down.  Stores were busy.  Berlin\r\nappeared to be as normal as any other capital.  Even the confidence of\r\nGermany in victory impressed me so that in one of my first despatches I\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Germany to-day is more confident than ever that all efforts of her\r\nenemies to crush her must prove in vain.  With a threefold offensive,\r\nin Flanders, in Galicia and in northwest Russia, being successfully\r\nprosecuted, there was a spirit of enthusiasm displayed here in both\r\nmilitary and civilian circles that exceeded even the stirring days\r\nimmediately following the outbreak of the war.\r\n\r\n\"Flags are flying everywhere to-day; the Imperial standards of Germany\r\nand Austria predominate, although there is a goodly showing of the\r\nTurkish Crescent.  Bands are playing as regiment after regiment passes\r\nthrough the city to entrain for the front.  Through Wilhelmstrasse the\r\nsoldiers moved, their hats and guns decorated with fragrant flowers and\r\nwith mothers, sisters and sweethearts clinging to and encouraging them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA few weeks before I arrived the Germans were excited over the shipment\r\nof arms and ammunitions from the United States to the Allies, but by\r\nthe time I was in Berlin the situation seemed to have changed.  On\r\nApril 4th I telegraphed the following despatch which appeared in the\r\n_Evening Sun_, New York:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The spirit of animosity towards Americans which swept Germany a few\r\nweeks ago seems to have disappeared.  The 1,400 Americans in Berlin and\r\nthose in the smaller cities of Germany have little cause to complain of\r\ndiscourteous treatment.  Americans just arriving in Berlin in\r\nparticular comment upon the friendliness of their reception.  The\r\nGermans have been especially courteous, they declare, on learning of\r\ntheir nationality.  Feeling against the United States for permitting\r\narms to be shipped to the Allies still exists, but I have not found\r\nthis feeling extensive among the Germans.  Two American doctors\r\nstudying in German clinics declare that the wounded soldiers always\r\ntalk about 'Amerikanische keugel' (American bullets), but it is my\r\nobservation that the persons most outspoken against the sale of\r\nammunition to the Allies by American manufacturers are the American\r\nresidents of Berlin.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later the situation had changed considerably.  On the 24th I\r\ntelegraphed: \"Despite the bitter criticism of the United States by\r\nGerman newspapers for refusing to end the traffic in munitions, it is\r\nsemi-officially explained that this does not represent the real views\r\nof the German Government.  The censor has been instructed to permit the\r\nnewspapers to express themselves frankly on this subject and on\r\nSecretary Bryan's reply to the von Bernstorff note, but it has been\r\nemphasised that their views reflect popular opinion and the editorial\r\nside of the matter and not the Government.\r\n\r\n\"The _Lokal Anzeiger_, following up its attack of yesterday, to-day\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"'The answer of the United States is no surprise to Germany and\r\nnaturally it fails to convince Germany that a flourishing trade in\r\nmunitions of war is in accord with strict neutrality.  The German\r\nargument was based upon the practice of international law, but the\r\nAmerican reply was based upon the commercial advantages enjoyed by the\r\nammunition shippers.'\"\r\n\r\nApril 24th was von Tirpitz day.  It was the anniversary of the entrance\r\nof the Grand Admiral in the German Navy fifty years before, and the\r\neighteenth anniversary of his debut in the cabinet, a record for a\r\nGerman Minister of Marine.  There was tremendous rejoicing throughout\r\nthe country, and the Admiral, who spent his Prussian birthday at the\r\nNavy Department, was overwhelmed with congratulations.  Headed by the\r\nKaiser, telegrams came from every official in Germany.  The press paid\r\nhigh tribute to his blockade, declaring that it was due to him alone\r\nthat England was so terror-stricken by submarines.\r\n\r\nI was not in Germany very long until I was impressed by the remarkable\r\ncontrol the Government had on public opinion by censorship of the\r\npress.  People believe, without exception, everything they read in the\r\nnewspapers.  And I soon discovered that the censor was so accustomed to\r\ndealing with German editors that he applied the same standards to the\r\nforeign correspondents.  A reporter could telegraph not what he\r\nobserved and heard, but what the censors desired American readers to\r\nhear and know about Germany.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Berlin \"Extra\"]\r\n\r\nI was in St. Quentin, France (which the Germans on their 1917\r\nwithdrawal set on fire) at the headquarters of General von Below, when\r\nnews came May 8th that the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed.  I read the\r\nbulletins as they arrived.  I heard the comments of the Germans who\r\nwere waging war in an enemy country.  I listened as they spoke of the\r\nloss of American and other women and children.  I was amazed when I\r\nheard them say that a woman had no more right on the _Lusitania_ than\r\nshe would have on an ammunition wagon on the Somme.  The day before I\r\nwas in the first line trenches on the German front which crossed the\r\nroad running from Peronne to Albert.  At that time this battlefield,\r\nwhich a year and a half later was destined to be the scene of the\r\ngreatest slaughter in history, was as quiet and beautiful as this\r\npicturesque country of northern France was in peace times.  Only a few\r\ntrenches and barbed wire entanglements marred the scene.\r\n\r\nOn May 9th I left St. Quentin for Brussels.  Here I was permitted by\r\nthe General Government to send a despatch reflecting the views of the\r\nGerman army in France about the sinking of the _Lusitania_.  I wrote\r\nwhat I thought was a fair article.  I told how the bulletin was posted\r\nin front of the Hotel de Ville; how the officers and soldiers marching\r\nto and away from the front stopped, read, smiled and congratulated each\r\nother because the Navy was at last helping the Army \"win the war.\"\r\nThere were no expressions of regret over the loss of life.  These\r\nofficers and soldiers had seen so many dead, soldiers and civilians,\r\nmen and women, in Belgium and France that neither death nor murder\r\nshocked them.\r\n\r\nThe telegram was approved by the military censor and forwarded to\r\nBerlin.  I stayed in Belgium two days longer, went to Louvain and Liége\r\nand reached Berlin May 12th.  The next day I learned at the Foreign\r\nOffice that my despatch was stopped because it conflicted with the\r\nopinions which the German Government was sending officially by wireless\r\nto Washington and to the American newspapers.  I felt that this was\r\nunfair, but I was subject to the censorship and had no appeal.\r\n\r\nI did not forget this incident because it showed a striking difference\r\nof opinion between the army, which was fighting for Germany, and the\r\nForeign Office, which was explaining and excusing what the Army and\r\nNavy did.  The Army always justified the events in Belgium, but the\r\nForeign Office did not.  And this was the first incident which made me\r\nfeel that even in Germany, which was supposed to be united, there were\r\ndifferences of opinion.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1915, while the German army was moving against Russia\r\nlike a surging sea, I was invited to go to the front near Vilna.\r\nDuring the intervening months I had observed and recorded as much as\r\npossible the growing indignation in Germany because the United States\r\npermitted the shipment of arms and ammunition to the Allies.  In June I\r\nhad had an interview with Secretary of State von Jagow, in which he\r\nprotested against the attitude of the United States Government and said\r\nthat America was not acting as neutral as Germany did during the\r\nSpanish-American war.  He cited page 168 of Andrew D. White's book in\r\nwhich Ambassador White said he persuaded Germany not to permit a German\r\nship laden with ammunition and consigned for Spain to sail.  I thought\r\nthat if Germany had adopted such an attitude toward America, that in\r\njustice to Germany Washington should adopt the same position.  After\r\nvon Jagow gave me the facts in possession of the Foreign Office and\r\nafter he had loaned me Mr. White's book, I looked up the data.  I found\r\nto my astonishment that Mr. White reported to the State Department that\r\na ship of ammunition sailed from Hamburg, and that he had not\r\nprotested, although the Naval Attaché had requested him to do so.  The\r\nstatements of von Jagow and Mr. White's in his autobiography did not\r\nagree with the facts.  Germany did send ammunition to Spain, but\r\nWilhelmstrasse was using Mr. White's book as proof that the Krupp\r\ninterests did not supply our enemy in 1898.  The latter part of\r\nSeptember I entered Kovno, the important Russian fortress, eight days\r\nafter the army captured it.  I was escorted, together with other\r\nforeign correspondents, from one fort to another and shown what the 42\r\ncm. guns had destroyed.  I saw 400 machine guns which were captured and\r\n1,300 pieces of heavy artillery.  The night before, at a dinner party,\r\nthe officers had argued against the United States because of the\r\nshipment of supplies to Russia.  They said that if the United States\r\nhad not aided Russia, that country would not have been able to resist\r\nthe invaders.  I did not know the facts, but I accepted their\r\nstatements.  When I was shown the machine guns, I examined them and\r\ndiscovered that every one of the 400 was made at Essen or Magdeburg,\r\nGermany.  Of the 1,300 pieces of artillery every cannon was made in\r\nGermany except a few English ship guns.  Kovno was fortified by\r\n_German_ artillery, not American.\r\n\r\nA few days later I entered Vilna; this time I was moving with the\r\nadvance column.  At dinner that night with General von Weber, the\r\ncommander of the city, the subject of American arms and ammunition was\r\nagain brought up.  The General said they had captured from the Russians\r\nan American machine gun.  He added that they were bringing it in from\r\nSmorgon to show the Americans.  When it reached us the stamp, written\r\nin English, showed that it was manufactured by Vickers Limited,\r\nEngland.  Being unable to read English, the officer who reported the\r\ncapture thought the gun was made in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn Roumania last December I followed General von Falkenhayn's armies to\r\nthe forts of Bucharest.  On Thanksgiving Day I crossed by automobile\r\nthe Schurduck Pass.  The Roumanians had defended, or attempted to\r\ndefend, this road by mounting armoured guns on the crest of one of the\r\nmountain ranges in the Transylvanian Alps.  I examined a whole position\r\nhere and found all turrets were made in Germany.\r\n\r\nI did not doubt that the shipment of arms and ammunition to the Allies\r\nhad been a great aid to them.  (I was told in Paris, later, on my way\r\nto the United States that if it had not been for the American\r\nammunition factories France would have been defeated long ago.)  But\r\nwhen Germany argued that the United States was not neutral in\r\npermitting these shipments to leave American ports, Germany was\r\nforgetting what her own arms and munition factories had done _for\r\nGermany's enemies_.  When the Krupp works sold Russia the defences for\r\nKovno, the German Government knew these weapons would be used against\r\nGermany some day, because no nation except Germany could attack Russia\r\nby way of that city.  When Krupps sold war supplies to Roumania, the\r\nGerman Government knew that if Roumania joined the Allies these\r\nsupplies would be used against German soldiers.  But the Government was\r\ncareful not to report these facts in German newspapers.  And, although\r\nSecretary of State von Jagow acknowledged to Ambassador Gerard that\r\nthere was nothing in international law to justify a change in\r\nWashington's position, von Jagow's statements were not permitted to be\r\npublished in Germany.\r\n\r\nTo understand Germany's resentment over Mr. Wilson's interference with\r\nthe submarine warfare, three things must be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n1. The Allies' charge that all Germans are \"Huns and Barbarians.\"\r\n\r\n2. The battle of the Marne and the shipment of arms and ammunition from\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n3. The intrigue and widening breach between the Army and Navy and the\r\nForeign Office.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nOne weapon the Allies used against Germany, which was more effective\r\nthan all others, was the press.  When the English and French indicted\r\nthe Germans as \"Barbarians and Huns,\" as \"pirates,\" and \"uncivilised\"\r\nEuropeans, it cut the Germans to the quick; it affected men and women\r\nso terribly that Germans feared these attacks more than they did the\r\ncombined military might of their enemies.  This is readily understood\r\nwhen one realises that before the war the thing the Germans prided\r\nthemselves on was their commerce and their civilisation,--their Kultur.\r\nBefore the war, the world was told by every German what the nation had\r\ndone for the poor; what strides the scientists had made in research\r\nwork and what progress the business men had made in extending their\r\ncommerce at the expense of competitors.\r\n\r\nWhile some government officials foresaw the disaster which would come\r\nto Germany if this national vanity was paraded before the whole world,\r\ntheir advice and counsel were ignored.  Consul General Kiliani, the\r\nChief German official in Australia before the war, told me he had\r\nreported repeatedly to the Foreign Office that German business men were\r\ninjuring their own opportunities by bragging so much of what they had\r\ndone, and what they would do.  He said if it continued the whole world\r\nwould be leagued against Germany; that public opinion would be so\r\nstrong against German goods that they would lose their markets.\r\nGermany made the whole world fear her commercial might by this foolish\r\nbragging.\r\n\r\nSo when the war broke out and Germans were attacked for being\r\nuncivilised in Belgium, for breaking treaties and for disregarding the\r\nopinion of the world, it was but natural that German vanity should\r\nresent it.  Germans feared nothing but God and public opinion.  They\r\nhad such exalted faith in their army they believed they could gain by\r\nMight what they had lost in prestige throughout the world.  This is one\r\nof the reasons the German people arose like one man when war was\r\ndeclared.  They wished and were ready to show the world that they were\r\nthe greatest people ever created.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe German explanation of why they lost the battle of the Marne is\r\ninteresting, not alone because of the explanation of the defeat, but\r\nbecause it shows why the shipment of arms and ammunition from the\r\nUnited States was such a poisonous pill to the army.  Shortly after my\r\narrival in Berlin Dr. Alfred Zimmermann, then Under Secretary of State,\r\nsaid the greatest scandal in Germany after the war would be the\r\ninvestigation of the reasons for the shortage of ammunition in\r\nSeptember, 1914.  He did not deny that Germany was prepared for a great\r\nwar.  He must have known at the time what the Director of the Post and\r\nTelegraph knew on the 2nd of August, 1914, when he wrote Announcement\r\nNo. 3.  The German Army must have known the same thing and if it had\r\nprepared for war, as every German admits it had, then preparations were\r\nmade to fight nine nations.  But there was one thing which Germany\r\nfailed to take into consideration, Zimmermann said, and that was the\r\nshipment of supplies from the United States.  Then, he added, there\r\nwere two reasons why the battle of the Marne was lost: one, because\r\nthere was not sufficient ammunition; and, two, because the reserves\r\nwere needed to stop the Russian invasion of East Prussia.  I asked him\r\nwhether Germany did not have enormous stores of ammunition on hand when\r\nthe war began.  He said there was sufficient ammunition for a short\r\ncampaign, but that the Ministry of War had not mobilised sufficient\r\nammunition factories to keep up the supplies.  He said this was the\r\nreason for the downfall of General von Herringen, who was Minister of\r\nWar at the beginning of hostilities.\r\n\r\nAfter General von Kluck was wounded and returned to his villa in\r\nWilmersdorf, a suburb of Berlin, I took a walk with him in his garden\r\nand discussed the Marne.  He confirmed what Zimmermann stated about the\r\nshortage of ammunition and added that he had to give up his reserves to\r\nGeneral von Hindenburg, who had been ordered by the Kaiser to drive the\r\nRussians from East Prussia.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of the war, although no intimations were\r\npermitted to reach the outside world, there was a bitter controversy\r\nbetween the Foreign Office, as headed by the Chancellor von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg; the Navy Department, headed by Grand Admiral von\r\nTirpitz, and General von Moltke, Chief of the General Staff.  The\r\nChancellor delayed mobilisation of the German Army three days.  For\r\nthis he never has and never will be forgiven by the military\r\nauthorities.  During those stirring days of July and August, when\r\nGeneral von Moltke, von Tirpitz, von Falkenhayn, Krupps and the Rhine\r\nValley Industrial leaders were clamouring for war and for an invasion\r\nof Belgium, the Kaiser was being urged by the Chancellor and the\r\nForeign Office to heed the proposals of Sir Edward Grey for a Peace\r\nConference.  But the Kaiser, who was more of a soldier than a\r\nstatesman, sided with his military friends.  The war was on, not only\r\nbetween Germany and the Entente, but between the Foreign Office and the\r\nArmy and Navy.  This internal fight which began in July, 1914, became\r\nGermany's bitterest struggle and from time to time the odds went from\r\none side to another.  The Army accused the diplomats of blundering in\r\nstarting the war.  The Foreign Office replied that it was the lust for\r\npower and victory which poisoned the military leaders which caused the\r\nwar.  Belgium was invaded against the counsel of the Foreign Office.\r\nBut when the Chancellor was confronted with the actual invasion and the\r\nviolation of the treaty, he was compelled by force of circumstance, by\r\nhis position and responsibility to the Kaiser to make his famous speech\r\nin the Reichstag in which he declared: \"Emergency knows no law.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the allied fleet swept German ships from the high seas and\r\nisolated a nation which had considered its international commerce one\r\nof its greatest assets, considerable animosity developed between the\r\nArmy and Navy.  The Army accused the Navy of stagnation.  Von Tirpitz,\r\nwho had based his whole naval policy upon a great navy, especially upon\r\nbattleship and cruiser units, was confronted by his military friends\r\nwith the charge that he was not prepared.  As early as 1908 von Tirpitz\r\nhad opposed the construction of submarines.  Speaking in the Reichstag\r\nwhen naval appropriations were debated, he said Germany should rely\r\nupon a battleship fleet and not upon submarines.  But when he saw his\r\ngreat inactive Navy in German waters, he switched to the submarine idea\r\nof a blockade of England.  In February, 1915, he announced his\r\nsubmarine blockade of England with the consent of the Kaiser, but\r\nwithout the approval of the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nBy this time the cry, \"Gott strafe England,\" had become the most\r\npopular battle shout in Germany.  The von Tirpitz blockade announcement\r\nmade this battlecry real.  It made him the national hero.  The German\r\npress, which at that time was under three different censors, turned its\r\nentire support over night to the von Tirpitz plan.  The Navy\r\nDepartment, which even then was not only anti-British but\r\nanti-American, wanted to sink every ship on the high seas.  When the\r\nUnited States lodged its protests on February 12th the German Navy\r\nwanted to ignore it.  The Foreign Office was inclined to listen to\r\nPresident Wilson's arguments.  Even the people, while they were\r\nenthusiastic for a submarine war, did not want to estrange America if\r\nthey could prevent it.  The von Tirpitz press bureau, which knew that\r\npublic opposition to its plan could be overcome by raising the cry that\r\nAmerica was not neutral in aiding the Allies with supplies, launched an\r\nanti-American campaign.  It came to a climax one night when Ambassador\r\nGerard was attending a theatre party.  As he entered the box he was\r\nrecognised by a group of Germans who shouted insulting remarks because\r\nhe spoke English.  Then some one else remarked that America was not\r\nneutral by shipping arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office apologised the next day but the Navy did not.  And,\r\ninstead of listening to the advice of Secretary of State von Jagow, the\r\nNavy sent columns of inspired articles to the newspapers attacking\r\nPresident Wilson and telling the German people that the United States\r\nhad joined the Entente in spirit if not in action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE GULF BETWEEN KIEL AND BERLIN\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war, even the Socialist Party in the Reichstag\r\nvoted the Government credits.  The press and the people unanimously\r\nsupported the Government because there was a very terrorising fear that\r\nRussia was about to invade Germany and that England and France were\r\nleagued together to crush the Fatherland.  Until the question of the\r\nsubmarine warfare came up, the division of opinion which had already\r\ndeveloped between the Army and Navy clique and the Foreign Office was\r\nnot general among the people.  Although the army had not taken Paris, a\r\ngreat part of Belgium and eight provinces of Northern France were\r\noccupied and the Russians had been driven from East Prussia.  The\r\nGerman people believed they were successful.  The army was satisfied\r\nwith what it had done and had great plans for the future.  Food and\r\neconomic conditions had changed very little as compared to the changes\r\nwhich were to take place before 1917.  Supplies were flowing into\r\nGermany from all neutral European countries.  Even England and Russia\r\nwere selling goods to Germany indirectly through neutral countries.\r\nConsiderable English merchandise, as well as American products, came in\r\nby way of Holland because English business men were making money by the\r\ntransaction and because the English Government had not yet discovered\r\nleaks in the blockade.  Two-thirds of the butter supply in Berlin was\r\ncoming from Russia.  Denmark was sending copper.  Norway was sending\r\nfish and valuable oils.  Sweden was sending horses and cattle.  Italy\r\nwas sending fruit.  Spanish sardines and olives were reaching German\r\nmerchants.  There was no reason to be dissatisfied with the way the war\r\nwas going.  And, besides, the German people hated their enemies so that\r\nthe leaders could count upon continued support for almost an indefinite\r\nperiod.  The cry of \"Hun and Barbarian\" was answered with the battle\r\ncry \"Gott strafe England.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter part of April on my first trip to the front I dined at Great\r\nHeadquarters (Grosse Haupt Quartier) in Charleville, France, with Major\r\nNicolai, Chief of the Intelligence Department of the General Staff.\r\nThe next day, in company with other correspondents, we were guests of\r\nGeneral von Moehl and his staff at Peronne.  From Peronne we went to\r\nthe Somme front to St. Quentin, to Namur and Brussels.  The soldiers\r\nwere enthusiastic and happy.  There was plenty of food and considerable\r\noptimism.  But the confidence in victory was never so great as it was\r\nimmediately after the sinking of the _Lusitania_.  That marked the\r\ncrisis in the future trend of the war.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the people had heard very little about the fight\r\nbetween the Navy and the Foreign Office.  But gradually rumours spread.\r\nWhile there was previously no outlet for public opinion, the\r\n_Lusitania_ issue was debated more extensively and with more vigour\r\nthan the White Books which were published to explain the causes of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nWith the universal feeling of self confidence, it was but natural that\r\nthe people should side with the Navy in demanding an unrestricted\r\nsubmarine warfare.  When Admiral von Bachmann gave the order to First\r\nNaval Lieutenant Otto Steinbrink to sink the Lusitania, he knew the\r\nNavy was ready to defy the United States or any other country which\r\nmight object.  He knew, too, that von Tirpitz was very close to the\r\nKaiser and could count upon the Kaiser's support in whatever he did.\r\nThe Navy believed the torpedoing of the Lusitania would so frighten and\r\nterrorise the world that neutral shipping would become timid and enemy\r\npeoples would be impressed by Germany's might on the seas.  Ambassador\r\nvon Bernstorff had been ordered by the Foreign Office to put notices in\r\nthe American papers warning Americans off these ships.  The Chancellor\r\nand Secretary von Jagow knew there was no way to stop the Admiralty,\r\nand they wanted to avoid, if possible, the loss of American lives.\r\n\r\nThe storm of indignation which encircled the globe when reports were\r\nprinted that over a thousand people lost their lives on the Lusitania,\r\nfound a sympathetic echo in the Berlin Foreign Office.  \"Another navy\r\nblunder,\" the officials said--confidentially.  Foreign Office officials\r\ntried to conceal their distress because the officials knew the only\r\nthing they could do now was to make preparation for an apology and try\r\nto excuse in the best possible way what the navy had done.  On the 17th\r\nof May like a thunderbolt from a clear sky came President Wilson's\r\nfirst Lusitania note.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Recalling the humane and enlightened attitude hitherto assumed by the\r\nImperial German Government in matters of international life,\r\nparticularly with regard to the freedom of the seas; having learned to\r\nrecognise German views and German influence in the field of\r\ninternational obligations as always engaged upon the side of justice\r\nand humanity;\" the note read, \"and having understood the instructions\r\nof the Imperial German Government to its naval commanders to be upon\r\nthe same plane of human action as those prescribed by the naval codes\r\nof other nations, the government of the United States is loath to\r\nbelieve--it cannot now bring itself to believe--that these acts so\r\nabsolutely contrary to the rules and practices and spirit of modern\r\nwarfare could have the countenance or sanction of that great\r\ngovernment. . . .  Manifestly submarines cannot be used against\r\nmerchantmen as the last few weeks have shown without an inevitable\r\nviolation of many sacred principles of justice and humanity.  American\r\ncitizens act within their indisputable rights in taking their ships and\r\nin travelling wherever their legitimate business calls them upon the\r\nhigh seas, and exercise those rights in what should be a well justified\r\nconfidence that their lives will not be endangered by acts done in\r\nclear violation of universally acknowledged international obligations\r\nand certainly in the confidence that their own government will sustain\r\nthem in the exercise of their rights.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then the note which Mr. Gerard handed von Jagow concluded with\r\nthese words:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It (The United States) confidently expects therefore that the Imperial\r\nGerman Government will disavow the acts of which the United States\r\ncomplains, that they will make reparation as far as reparation is\r\npossible for injuries which are without measure, and that they will\r\ntake immediate steps to prevent the recurrence of anything so obviously\r\nsubversive of the principles of warfare, for which the Imperial German\r\nGovernment in the past so wisely and so firmly contended.  The\r\nGovernment and people of the United States look to the Imperial German\r\nGovernment for just, prompt and enlightened action in this vital\r\nmatter. . . .  Expressions of regret and offers of reparation in the\r\ncase of neutral ships sunk by mistake, while they may satisfy\r\ninternational obligations if no loss of life results, cannot justify or\r\nexcuse a practice, the natural necessary effect of which is to subject\r\nneutral nations or neutral persons to new and immeasurable risks.  The\r\nImperial German Government will not expect the Government of the United\r\nStates to omit any word, or any act, necessary to the performance of\r\nits sacred duty of maintaining the rights of the United States and its\r\ncitizens, and of safeguarding their free exercise and enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNever in history had a neutral nation indicted another as the United\r\nStates did Germany in its first _Lusitania_ note without immediately\r\ngoing to war.  Because the Foreign Office feared the reaction it might\r\nhave upon the people, the newspapers were not permitted to publish the\r\ntext until the press bureaus of the Navy and the Foreign Office had\r\nmobilised the editorial writers and planned a publicity campaign to\r\nfollow the note's publication.  But the Navy and Foreign Office could\r\nnot agree on what should be done.  The Navy wanted to ignore Wilson.\r\nNaval officers laughed at President Wilson's impertinence and, when the\r\nForeign Office sent to the Admiralty for all data in possession of the\r\nNavy Department regarding the sinking of the _Lusitania_ the Navy\r\nrefused to acknowledge the request.\r\n\r\nDuring this time I was in constant touch with the Foreign Office and\r\nthe American Embassy.  Frequently I went to the Navy Department but was\r\nalways told they had nothing to say.  When it appeared, however, that\r\nthere might he a break in diplomatic relations over the Lusitania the\r\nKaiser called the Chancellor to Great Headquarters for a conference.\r\nMeanwhile Germany delayed her reply to the American note because the\r\nNavy and Foreign Office were still at loggerheads.  On the 31st of May\r\nvon Jagow permitted me to quote him in an interview saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"America can hardly expect us to give up any means at our disposal to\r\nfight our enemy.  It is a principle with us to defend ourselves in\r\nevery possible way.  I am sure that Americans will be reasonable enough\r\nto believe that our two countries cannot discuss the _Lusitania_ matter\r\n_until both have the same basis of facts_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American people were demanding an answer from Germany and because\r\nthe two branches of the Government could not agree on what should be\r\nsaid von Jagow had to do something to gain time.  Germany, therefore,\r\nsubmitted in her reply of the 28th of May certain facts about the\r\n_Lusitania_ for the consideration of the American Government saying\r\nthat Germany reserved final statements of its position with regard \"to\r\nthe demands made in connection with the sinking of the _Lusitania_\r\nuntil a reply was received from the American Government.\"  After the\r\nnote was despatched the chasm between the Navy and Foreign Office was\r\nwider than ever.  Ambassador Gerard, who went to the Foreign Office\r\ndaily, to try to convince the officials that they were antagonising the\r\nwhole world by their attitude on the _Lusitania_ question, returned to\r\nthe Embassy one day after a conference with Zimmermann and began to\r\nprepare a scrap book of cartoons and clippings from American\r\nnewspapers.  Two secretaries were put to work pasting the comments,\r\ninterviews, editorials and cartoons reflecting American opinion in the\r\nscrap book.  Although the German Foreign Office had a big press\r\ndepartment its efforts were devoted more to furnishing the outside\r\nworld with German views than with collecting outside opinions for the\r\ninformation of the German Government.  Believing that this information\r\nwould be of immeasurable benefit to the German diplomats in sounding\r\nthe depths of public sentiment in America, Gerard delivered the book to\r\nvon Jagow personally.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime numerous conferences were held at Great Headquarters.\r\nFinanciers, business men and diplomats who wanted to keep peace with\r\nAmerica sided with the Foreign Office.  Every anti-American influence\r\nin the Central Powers joined forces with the Navy.  The _Lusitania_\r\nnote was printed and the public discussion which resulted was greater\r\nthan that which followed the first declarations of war in August, 1914.\r\nThe people, who before had accepted everything their Government said,\r\nbegan to think for themselves.  One heard almost as much criticism as\r\npraise of the _Lusitania_ incident.  For the first time the quarrel,\r\nwhich had been nourished between the Foreign Office and the Admiralty,\r\nbecame nation-wide and forces throughout Germany lined up with one side\r\nor the other.  But the Navy Department was the cleverer of the two.\r\nThe press bureau sent out inspired stories that the submarines were\r\ncausing England a loss of a million dollars a week.  They said that\r\nevery week the Admiralty was launching two U-boats.  It was stated that\r\nreliable reports to Admiral von Tirpitz proved the high toll taken by\r\nthe submarines in two weeks had struck terror to the hearts of English\r\nship-owners.  The newspapers printed under great headlines: \"Toll of\r\nOur Tireless U-Boats,\" the names and tonnage of ships lost.  The press\r\nbureau pointed to the rise in food prices in Great Britain and France.\r\nThe public was made to feel a personal pride in submarine exploits.\r\nAnd at the same time the Navy editorial writers brought up the old\r\nissue of American arms and ammunition to further embitter the people.\r\n\r\nThus the first note which President Wilson wrote in the _Lusitania_\r\ncase not only brought the quarrel between the Navy and Foreign Office\r\nto a climax but it gave the German people the first opportunity they\r\nhad had seriously to discuss questions of policy and right.\r\n\r\nIn the Rhine Valley, where the ammunition interests dominated every\r\nphase of life, the Navy found its staunchest supporters.  In\r\neducational circles, in shipping centres, such as Hamburg and Bremen,\r\nin the financial districts of Frankfort and Berlin, the Foreign Office\r\nreceived its support.  Press and Reichstag were divided.  Supporting\r\nthe Foreign Office were the _Lokal Anzeiger_, the _Berliner Tageblatt_,\r\nthe _Cologne Gazette_, the _Frankforter Zeitung_, the _Hamburger\r\nFremdemblatt_, and the _Vorwärts_.\r\n\r\nThe Navy had the support of Count Reventlow, Naval Critic of the\r\n_Deutsche Tageszeitung_, the _Täglische Rundscha_, the _Vossische\r\nZeitung_, the _Morgen Post_, the _B. Z. Am Mittag_, the _Münchener\r\nNeueste Nachrichten_, the _Rheinische Westfälische Zeitung_, and the\r\nleading Catholic organ, the _Koelnische Volks-Zeitung_.\r\n\r\nGovernment officials were also divided.  Chancellor von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg led the party which demanded an agreement with the\r\nUnited States.  He was supported by von Jagow, Zimmermann, Dr. Karl\r\nHelfferich, Secretary of the Treasury; Dr. Solf, the Colonial Minister;\r\nDr. Siegfried Heckscher, Vice Chairman of the Reichstag Committee on\r\nForeign Relations; and Philip Scheidemann, leader of the majority of\r\nthe Socialists in the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe opposition was led by Grand Admiral von Tirpitz.  He was supported\r\nby General von Falkenhayn, Field Marshal von Mackensen and all army\r\ngenerals; Admirals von Pohl and von Bachmann; Major Bassermann, leader\r\nof the National Liberal Party in the Reichstag; Dr. Gustav Stressemann,\r\nmember of the Reichstag and Director of the North German Lloyd\r\nSteamship Company; and von Heydebrand, the so-called \"Uncrowned King of\r\nPrussia,\" because of his control of the Prussian Diet.\r\n\r\nWith these forces against each other the internal fight continued more\r\nbitter than ever.  President Wilson kept insisting upon definite\r\npromises from Germany but the Admiralty still had the upper hand.\r\nThere was nothing for the Foreign Office to do except to make the best\r\npossible excuses and depend upon Wilson's patience to give them time to\r\nget into the saddle.  The Navy Department, however, was so confident\r\nthat it had the Kaiser's support in everything it did, that one of the\r\nsubmarines was instructed to sink the _Arabic_.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson's note in the _Arabic_ case again brought the\r\nsubmarine dispute within Germany to a head.  Conferences were again\r\nheld at Great Headquarters.  The Chancellor, von Jagow, Helfferich, von\r\nTirpitz and other leaders were summoned by the Kaiser.  On the 28th of\r\nAugust I succeeded in sending by courier to The Hague the following\r\ndespatch:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"With the support of the Kaiser, the German Chancellor, Dr. von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg, is expected to win the fight he is now making for a\r\nmodification of Germany's submarine warfare that will forever settle\r\nthe difficulties with America over the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and\r\nthe _Arabic_.  Both the Chancellor and von Jagow are most anxious to\r\nend at once and for all time the controversies with Washington desiring\r\nAmerica's friendship.\"  (Published in the Chicago _Tribune_, August\r\n29th, 1915.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Marine Department, headed by von Tirpitz, creator of the submarine\r\npolicy, will oppose any disavowal of the action of German's submarines.\r\nBut the Kaiser is expected to approve the steps the Chancellor and\r\nForeign Secretary contemplate taking, swinging the balance in favour of\r\nvon Bethmann-Hollweg's contention that ships in the future must be\r\nwarned before they are torpedoed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day I went to the Foreign Office and told one of the officials I\r\nbelieved that if the American people knew what a difficult time the\r\nForeign Office was having in trying to win out over the Admiralty that\r\npublic opinion in the United States might be mobilised to help the\r\nForeign Office against the Admiralty.  I took with me a brief despatch\r\nwhich I asked him to pass.  He censored it with the understanding that\r\nI would never disclose his name in case the despatch was read in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nA few days later the Manchester, England, _Guardian_ arrived containing\r\nmy article, headed as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  HOLLWEG'S CHANGE OF TUNE\r\n\r\n  Respect for Scraps of Paper\r\n\r\n  LAW AT SEA\r\n\r\n  Insists on Warning by Submarines\r\n\r\n  TIRPITZ PARTY BEATEN\r\n\r\n  Kaiser Expected to Approve New Policy\r\n\r\n  \"New York, Sunday.\r\n\r\n\"Cables from Mr. Carl W. Ackerman, Berlin correspondent of the United\r\nPress published here, indicate that the real crisis following the\r\n_Arabic_ is in Germany, not America.  He writes:\r\n\r\n\"The Berlin Foreign Office is unalterably opposed to submarine\r\nactivity, such as evidenced by the _Arabic_ affair, and it was on the\r\ninitiative of this Government department that immediate steps were\r\ntaken with Mr. Gerard the American Ambassador.  The nature of these\r\nnegotiations is still unknown to the German public.\r\n\r\n\"It is stated on the highest authority that Herr von Jagow, Secretary\r\nof Foreign Affairs, and Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg are unanimous\r\nin their anxiety to settle American difficulties once and for all,\r\nretaining the friendship of the United States in any event.\r\n\r\n\"The Kaiser is expected to approve the course suggested by the Imperial\r\nChancellor, despite open opposition to any disavowal of submarine\r\nactivities which constantly emanates from the German Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\"The Chancellor is extremely desirous of placing Germany on record as\r\nan observer of international law as regards sea warfare, and in this\r\ncase will win his demand that submarines in the future shall thoroughly\r\nwarn enemy ships before firing their torpedoes or shells.\r\n\r\n\"There is considerable discussion in official circles as to whether the\r\nChancellor's steps create a precedent, but it is agreed that it will\r\nprobably close all complications with America, including the\r\n_Lusitania_ case, which remained unsettled following President Wilson's\r\nlast note to Germany.\r\n\r\n\"Thus if the United States approves the present attitude of the\r\nChancellor this step will aid in clearing the entire situation and will\r\nmaterially strengthen the policy of von Bethmann-Hollweg and von Jagow,\r\nwhich is a deep desire for peace with America.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this despatch was printed I was called to the home of Fran von\r\nSchroeder, the American-born wife of one of the Intelligence Office of\r\nthe General Staff.  Captain Vanselow, Chief of the Admiralty\r\nIntelligence Department, was there and had brought with him the\r\nManchester _Guardian_.  He asked me where I got the information and who\r\nhad passed the despatch.  He said the Navy was up in arms and had\r\nissued orders to the General Telegraph Office that, inasmuch as Germany\r\nwas under martial law, no telegrams were to be passed containing the\r\nwords submarines, navy, admiralty or marine or any officers of the Navy\r\nwithout having them referred to the Admiralty for a second censoring.\r\nThis order practically nullified the censorship powers of the Foreign\r\nOffice.  I saw that the Navy Department was again in the saddle and\r\nthat the efforts of the Chancellor to maintain peace might not be\r\nsuccessful after all.  But the conferences at Great Headquarters lasted\r\nlonger than any one expected.  The first news we received of what had\r\ntaken place was that Secretary von Jagow had informed the Kaiser he\r\nwould resign before he would do anything which might cause trouble with\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nGermany was split wide open by the submarine issue.  For a while it\r\nlooked as if the only possible adjustment would be either for von\r\nTirpitz to go and his policies with him, or for von Jagow and the\r\nChancellor to go with the corresponding danger of a rupture with\r\nAmerica.  But von Tirpitz would not resign.  He left Great Headquarters\r\nfor Berlin and intimated to his friends that he was going to run the\r\nNavy to suit himself.  But the Chancellor who had the support of the\r\nbig shipping interests and the financiers, saw a possible means of\r\ncheckmating von Tirpitz by forcing Admiral von Pohl to resign as Chief\r\nof the Admiralty Staff.  They finally persuaded the Kaiser to accept\r\nhis resignation and appoint Admiral von Holtzendorff as his successor.\r\nVon Holtzendorff's brother was a director of the Hamburg-American Line\r\nand an intimate friend of A. Ballin, the General Director of the\r\ncompany.  The Chancellor believed that by having a friend of his as\r\nChief of the Admiralty Staff, no orders would be issued to submarine\r\ncommanders contrary to the wishes of the Chancellor, because according\r\nto the rules of the German Navy Department the Chief of the Admiralty\r\nStaff must approve all naval plans and sign all orders to fleet\r\ncommanders.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time the one thing which frightened the Foreign Office\r\nwas the fear that President Wilson might break off diplomatic relations\r\nbefore the Foreign Office had an opportunity to settle the differences\r\nwith the United States.  For this reason Ambassador Gerard was kept\r\nadvised by Wilhelmstrasse of the internal developments in Germany and\r\nasked to report them fully but confidentially to Wilson.  So, during\r\nthis crisis when Americans were demanding a break with Germany because\r\nof Germany's continued defiance of President Wilson's notes, the\r\nAmerican Government knew that if the Foreign Office was given more time\r\nit had a good chance of succeeding in cleaning house.  A rupture at\r\nthat time would have destroyed all the efforts of the Foreign Office to\r\nkeep the German military machine within bounds.  It would have\r\nover-thrown von Jagow and von Bethmann-Hollweg and put in von Tirpitz\r\nas Chancellor and von Heydebrand, the reactionary leader of the\r\nPrussian Diet, as Secretary of State.  At that time, all the democratic\r\nforces of Germany were lined up with the Foreign Office.  The people\r\nwho blushed for Belgium, the financiers who were losing money, the\r\nshipping interests whose tonnage was locked in belligerent or neutral\r\nharbours, the Socialists and people who were anxious and praying for\r\npeace, were looking to the Foreign Office and to Washington to avoid a\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE HATE CAMPAIGN AGAINST AMERICA\r\n\r\nWhile Germany was professing her friendship for the United States in\r\nevery note written following the sinking of the _Lusitania_, the\r\ngovernment was secretly preparing the nation for a break in diplomatic\r\nrelations, or for war, in the event of a rupture.  German officials\r\nrealised that unless the people were made to suspect Mr. Wilson and his\r\nmotives, unless they were made to resent the shipment of arms and\r\nammunition to the Allies, there would be a division in public opinion\r\nand the government would not be able to count upon the united support\r\nof the people.  Because the government does the thinking for the people\r\nit has to tell them what to think before they have reached the point of\r\ndebating an issue themselves.  A war with America or a break in\r\ndiplomatic relations in 1915 would not have been an easy matter to\r\nexplain, if the people had not been encouraged to hate Wilson.  So\r\nwhile Germany maintained a propaganda bureau in America to interpret\r\nGermany and to maintain good relations, she started in Germany an\r\nextensive propaganda against Wilson, the American press, the United\r\nStates Ambassador and Americans in general.\r\n\r\nThis step was not necessary in the army because among army officers the\r\nbitterness and hatred of the United States were deeper and more\r\nextensive than the hatred of any other belligerent.  It was hardly ever\r\npossible for the American correspondents to go to the front without\r\nbeing insulted.  Even the American military attaches, when they went to\r\nthe front, had to submit to the insults of army officers.  After the\r\nsinking of the _Arabic_ the six military observers attached to the\r\nAmerican Embassy were invited by the General Staff to go to Russia to\r\nstudy the military operations of Field Marshal von Mackensen.  They\r\nwere escorted by Baron von Maltzahn, former attache of the German\r\nEmbassy in Paris.  At Lodz, one of the largest cities in Poland, they\r\nwere taken to headquarters.  Von Maltzahn, who knew Mackensen\r\npersonally, called at the Field Marshal's offices, reported that he had\r\nescorted six American army officers under orders of the General Staff,\r\nwhom he desired to present to the Commander-in-Chief.  Von Mackensen\r\nreplied that he did not care to meet the Americans and told von\r\nMaltzahn that the best thing he could do would be to escort the\r\nobservers back to Berlin.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the military attaches reached Berlin and reported this to\r\nWashington they were recalled.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  BLOOD-TRAFFICKERS\r\n\r\n  Cowards, who kill three thousand miles away,\r\n  See the long lines of shrouded forms increase!\r\n  Yours is this work, disguise it as you may;\r\n  But for your greed the world were now at peace.\r\n\r\n  Month after month your countless chimneys roar,--\r\n  Slaughter your object, and your motive gain;\r\n  Look at your money,--it is wet with gore\r\n  Nothing can cleanse it from the loathsome stain.\r\n\r\n  You, who prolong this hideous hell on earth,\r\n  Making a by-word of your native land,\r\n  Stripped of your wealth, how paltry is your worth!\r\n  See how men shrink from contact with your hand!\r\n\r\n  There is pollution in your blood-smeared gold,\r\n  There is corruption in your pact with Death,\r\n  There is dishonor in the lie, oft-told,\r\n  Of your \"Humanity\"!

After the fall of Warsaw\r\na group of American correspondents were asked to go to the headquarters\r\nof General von Besseler, afterward named Governor General of Poland.\r\nThe general received them in the gardens of the Polish castle which he\r\nhad seized as his headquarters; shook hands with the Dutch, Danish,\r\nSwedish, Swiss and South American newspaper men, and then, before\r\nturning on his heels to go back to his Polish palace, turned to the\r\nAmericans and said:\r\n\r\n\"As for you gentlemen, the best thing you can do is to tell your\r\ncountry to stop shipping arms and ammunition.\"\r\n\r\nDuring General Brusiloff's offensive I was invited together with other\r\ncorrespondents to go to the Wohlynian battlefields to see how the\r\nGermans had reorganised the Austrian front.  In a little town near the\r\nStochod River we were invited to dinner by Colonel von Luck.  I sat\r\nopposite the colonel, who was in charge of the reorganisation here.\r\nThroughout the meal he made so many insulting remarks that the officer\r\nwho was our escort had to change the trend of the conversation.  Before\r\nhe did so the colonel said:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, do they insult you in Berlin like this?\"\r\n\r\nI replied that I seldom encountered such antagonism in Berlin; that it\r\nwas chiefly the army which was anti-American.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's the difference between the diplomats and the army.  If\r\nthe army was running the government we would probably have had war with\r\nAmerica a long time ago,\" he concluded, smiling sarcastically.\r\n\r\nShortly after the sinking of the _Lusitania_ the naval propaganda\r\nbureau had bronze medals cast and placed on sale at souvenir shops\r\nthroughout Germany.  Ambassador Gerard received one day, in exchanging\r\nsome money, a fifty mark bill, with the words stamped in purple ink\r\nacross the face:\r\n\r\n\"God punish England and America.\"  For some weeks this rubber stamp was\r\nused very effectively.\r\n\r\nThe Navy Department realised, too, that another way to attack America\r\nand especially Americans in Berlin, was to arouse the suspicion that\r\nevery one who spoke English was an enemy.  The result was that most\r\nAmericans had to be exceedingly careful not to talk aloud in public\r\nplaces.  The American correspondents were even warned at the General\r\nStaff not to speak English at the front.  Some of the correspondents\r\nwho did not speak German were not taken to the battle areas because the\r\nForeign Office desired to avoid insults.\r\n\r\nThe year and a half between the sinking of the _Lusitania_ and the\r\nseverance of diplomatic relations was a period of terror for most\r\nAmericans in Germany.  Only those who were so sympathetic with Germany\r\nthat they were anti-American found it pleasant to live there.  One day\r\none of the American girls employed in the confidential file room of the\r\nAmerican Embassy was slapped in the face until she cried, by a German\r\nin civilian clothes, because she was speaking English in the subway.\r\nAt another time the wife of a prominent American business man was spit\r\nupon and chased out of a public bus because she was speaking English.\r\nThen a group of women chased her down the street.  Another American\r\nwoman was stabbed by a soldier when she was walking on Friedrichstrasse\r\nwith a friend because she was speaking English.  When the State\r\nDepartment instructed Ambassador Gerard to bring the matter to the\r\nattention of the Foreign Office and to demand an apology Wilhelmstrasse\r\nreferred the matter to the General Staff for investigation.  The\r\nsoldier was arrested and secretly examined.  After many weeks had\r\nelapsed the Foreign Office explained that the man who had stabbed the\r\nwoman was really not a soldier but a red cross worker.  It was\r\nexplained that he had been wounded and was not responsible for what he\r\ndid.  The testimony of the woman, however, and of other witnesses,\r\nshowed that the man at the time he attacked the American was dressed in\r\na soldier's uniform, which is grey, and which could not he mistaken for\r\nthe black uniform of a red cross worker.\r\n\r\nIt was often said in Berlin, \"Germany hates England, fights France,\r\nfears Russia but loathes America.\"  No one, not even American\r\nofficials, questioned it.\r\n\r\nThe hate campaign was bearing fruit.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1916, there appeared in Berlin a publication called _Light\r\nand Truth_.  It was a twelve-page circular in English and German\r\nattacking President Wilson and the United States.  Copies were sent by\r\nmail to all Americans and to hundreds of thousands of Germans.  It was\r\nedited and distributed by \"The League of Truth.\"  It was the most\r\nsensational document printed in Germany since the beginning of the war\r\nagainst a power with which Germany was supposed to be at peace.  Page 6\r\ncontained two illustrations under the legend:\r\n\r\n    WILSON AND HIS PRESS IS NOT AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderneath was this paragraph:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"An American Demonstration--On the 27th of January, the birthday of the\r\nGerman Emperor, an immense laurel wreath decorated with the German and\r\nAmerican flags was placed by Americans at the foot of the monument to\r\nFrederick the Great (in Berlin).  The American flag was enshrouded in\r\nblack crape.  Frederick the Great was the first to recognise the\r\nindependence of the young Republic, after it had won its freedom from\r\nthe yoke of England, at the price of its very heart's blood through\r\nyears of struggle.  His successor, Wilhelm II, receives the gratitude\r\nof America in the form of hypocritical phrases and war supplies to his\r\nmortal enemy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First page of the magazine \"Light and Truth\"]\r\n\r\nOne photograph was of the wreath itself.  The other showed a group of\r\nthirty-six people, mostly boys, standing in front of the statue after\r\nthe wreath had been placed.\r\n\r\nWhen Ambassador Gerard learned about the \"demonstration\" he went to the\r\nstatue and from there immediately to the Foreign Office, where he saw\r\nSecretary of State von Jagow.  Gerard demanded instantaneous removal of\r\nthe wreath.  Von Jagow promised an \"investigation.\"  Gerard meanwhile\r\nbegan a personal investigation of the _League of Truth_, which had\r\npurchased and placed the insult there.\r\n\r\nDays, weeks, even months passed.  Von Jagow still refused to have the\r\nwreath removed.  Finally Gerard went to the Foreign Office and told von\r\nJagow that unless it was taken away that day he would get it himself\r\nand send it by courier to Washington.  That evening Gerard walked to\r\nthe statue.  The wreath had disappeared.\r\n\r\nWeek by week the league continued its propaganda.  Gerard continued his\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nJuly 4, 1916, another circular was scattered broadcast.  On page 1 was\r\na large black cross.  Pages 2 and 3, the inside, contained a reprint of\r\nthe \"Declaration of Independence,\" with the imprint across the face of\r\na bloody hand.  Enclosed in a heavy black border on page 4 were nine\r\nverses by John L. Stoddard, the lecturer, entitled \"Blood-Traffickers.\"\r\n(Printed in the beginning of this chapter.)\r\n\r\nThe league made an especial appeal to the \"German-Americans.\"  Germany,\r\nas was pointed out in a previous article, counts upon some\r\nGerman-Americans as her allies.  One day Ambassador Gerard received a\r\ncircular entitled \"An Appeal to All Friends of Truth.\"  The same was\r\nsent in German and English to a mailing list of many hundred thousands.\r\nExcerpts from this read:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"If any one is called upon to raise his voice in foreign lands for the\r\ncause of truth, it is the foreigner who was able to witness the\r\nunanimous rising of the German people at the outbreak of war, and their\r\nattitude during its continuance.  _This applies especially to the\r\nGerman-American_.\r\n\r\n\"_As a citizen of two continents, in proportion as his character has\r\nremained true to German principles, he finds both here and there the\r\nright word to say. . . ._\r\n\r\n\"Numberless millions of men are forced to look upon a loathsome\r\nspectacle.  _It is that of certain individuals in America; to whom a\r\ngreat nation has temporarily intrusted its weal and woe_, supporting a\r\nfew multi-millionaires and their dependents, setting at\r\nnaught--unpunished--the revered document of the Fourth of July, 1776,\r\nand daring to _barter away the birthright of the white race_. . . .  We\r\nwant to see whether the united voices of Germans and foreigners have\r\nnot more weight than the hired writers of editorials in the newspapers;\r\nand whether the words of men who are independent will not render it\r\nimpossible for a subsidised press to continue its destructive work.\"\r\n\r\nGerard's investigation showed that a group of German-Americans in\r\nBerlin were financing the _League of Truth_; that a man named William\r\nF. Marten, who posed as an American, was the head, and that the editors\r\nand writers of the publication _Light and Truth_ were being assisted by\r\nthe Foreign Office Press Bureau and protected by the General Staff.  An\r\nAmerican dentist in Berlin, Dr. Charles Mueller, was chairman of the\r\nleague.  Mrs. Annie Neumann-Hofer, the American-born wife of\r\nNeumann-Hofer, of the Reichstag, was secretary.  Gerard reported other\r\nnames to the State Department, and asked authority to take away the\r\npassports of Americans who were assisting the German government in this\r\npropaganda.\r\n\r\nThe \"league\" heard about the Ambassador's efforts, and announced that a\r\n\"Big Bertha\" issue would be published exposing Gerard.  For several\r\nmonths the propagandists worked to collect data.  One day Gerard\r\ndecided to go to the league's offices and look at the people who were\r\ndirecting it.  In the course of his remarks the Ambassador said that if\r\nthe Foreign Office didn't do something to suppress the league\r\nimmediately, he would burn down the place.  The next day Marten and his\r\nco-workers went to the Royal Administration of the Superior Court,\r\nNo. 1, in Berlin, and through his attorney lodged a criminal charge of\r\n\"threat of arson\" against the Ambassador.\r\n\r\nThe next day Germany was flooded with letters from \"The League of\r\nTruth,\" saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The undersigned committee of the League of Truth to their deepest\r\nregret felt compelled to inform the members that Ambassador Gerard had\r\nbecome involved in a criminal charge involving threat of arson. . . .\r\nAll American citizens are now asked whether an Ambassador who acts so\r\nundignified at the moment of a formal threat of a wholly unnecessary\r\nwar, is to be considered worthy further to represent a country like the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWere it not for the fact that at this time President Wilson was trying\r\nto impress upon Germany the seriousness of her continued disregard of\r\nAmerican and neutral lives on the high seas, the whole thing would have\r\nbeen too absurd to notice.  But Germany wanted to create the impression\r\namong her people that President Wilson was not speaking for America,\r\nand that the Ambassador was too insignificant to notice.\r\n\r\nAfter this incident Gerard called upon von Jagow again and demanded the\r\nimmediate suppression of the third number of _Light and Truth_.  Before\r\nvon Jagow consented Mrs. Neumann-Hofer turned upon her former\r\npropagandists and confessed.  I believe her confession is in the State\r\nDepartment, but this is what she told me:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Marten is a German and has never been called to the army because the\r\nGeneral Staff has delegated him to direct this anti-American\r\npropaganda.  [We were talking at the Embassy the day before the\r\nAmbassador left.]  Marten is supported by some very high officials.  He\r\nhas letters of congratulations from the Chancellor, General von\r\nFalkenhayn, Count Zeppelin and others for one of his propaganda books\r\nentitled 'German Barbarians.'  I think the Crown Prince is one of his\r\nbackers, but I have never been able to prove it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn July 4th, 1915, the League of Truth issued what it called \"A New\r\nDeclaration of Independence.\"  This was circulated in German and\r\nEnglish throughout the country.  It was as follows:\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nA NEW DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nSeven score years have elapsed since those great words were forged that\r\nwelded us into a nation upon many fiery battlefields.\r\n\r\nIn that day the strong voices of strong men rang across the world,\r\ntheir molten words flamed with light and their arms broke the visible\r\nchains of an intolerable bondage.\r\n\r\nBut now in the red reflex of the glare cast from the battlefields of\r\nEurope, the invisible manacles that have been cunningly laid upon our\r\nfreedom have become shamefully apparent.  They rattle in the ears of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nOur liberty has vanished once again.  Yet our ancient enemy remains\r\nenthroned in high places within our land and in insolent ships before\r\nour gates.  We have not only become Colonials once again, but\r\nsubjects,--for true subjects are known by the measure of their willing\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\nWe Americans in the heart of this heroic nation now struggling for all\r\nthat we ourselves hold dear, but against odds such as we were never\r\nforced to face, perceive this truth with a disheartening but unclouded\r\nvision.\r\n\r\nFar from home we would to-day celebrate, as usual, the birthday of our\r\nland.  But with heavy hearts we see that this would now seem like a\r\nhollow mockery of something solemn and immemorial.  It were more in\r\nkeeping with reality that we burnt incense upon the altars of the\r\nBritish Baal.\r\n\r\nIndependence Day without Independence!  The liberty of the seas denied\r\nus for the peaceful Commerce of our entire land and granted us only for\r\nthe murderous trafficking of a few men!\r\n\r\nIndependence Day has dawned for us in alien yet friendly land.  It has\r\nbrought to us at least the independence of our minds.\r\n\r\nFree from the abominations of the most dastardly campaign of falsehood\r\nthat ever disgraced those who began and those who believe it, we have\r\nstripped ourselves of the rags of many perilous illusions.  We see\r\nAmerica as a whole, and we see it with a fatal and terrible clarity.\r\n\r\nWe see that once again our liberties of thought, of speech, of\r\nintercourse, of trade, are threatened, nay, already seized by the one\r\nancient enemy that can never be our friend.\r\n\r\nWith humiliation we behold our principles, our sense of justice trodden\r\nunderfoot.  We see the wild straining of the felon arms that would drag\r\nour land into the abyss of the giant Conspiracy and Crime.\r\n\r\nWe see the foul alliance of gold, murderous iron and debauched paper to\r\nwhich we have been sold.\r\n\r\nWe know that our pretenses and ambitions as heralds of peace are\r\nmonstrous, so long as we profit through war and human agony.\r\n\r\nWe see these rivers of blood that have their source in our mills of\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\nThe Day of Independence has dawned.\r\n\r\nIt is a solemn and momentous hour for America,\r\n\r\nIt is a day on which our people must speak with clear and inexorable\r\nvoice, or sit silent in shame.\r\n\r\nIt is the great hour in which we dare not celebrate our first\r\nDeclaration of Independence, because the time has come when we must\r\nproclaim a new one over the corpse of that which has perished.\r\n\r\nBerlin, July 4th, 1915.\r\n\r\nAN ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA DOCUMENT\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe League of Truth, however, was but one branch of the intricate\r\npropaganda system.  While it was financed almost entirely by\r\nGerman-Americans living in Germany who retained their American\r\npassports to keep themselves, or their children, out of the army, all\r\npublications for this bureau were approved by the Foreign Office\r\ncensors.  Germans, connected with the organisation, were under\r\ndirection of the General Staff or Navy.\r\n\r\nIn order to have the propaganda really successful some seeds of\r\ndiscontent had to be sown in the United States, in South America and\r\nMexico as well as in Spain and other European neutral countries.  For\r\nthis outside propaganda, money and an organisation were needed.  The\r\nKrupp ammunition interests supplied the money and the Foreign Office\r\nthe organisation.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two years the American press regularly printed despatches\r\nfrom the Overseas News Agency.   Some believed they were \"official.\"\r\nThis was only half true.  The Krupps had been financing this news\r\nassociation.  The government had given its support and the two wireless\r\ntowers at Sayville, Long Island, and Tuckerton, N. J., were used as\r\n\"footholds\" on American soil.  These stations were just as much a part\r\nof the Krupp works as the factories at Essen or the shipyards of Kiel.\r\nThey were to disseminate the Krupp-fed, Krupp-owned, Krupp-controlled\r\nnews, of the Overseas News Agency.\r\n\r\nWhen the Overseas despatches first reached the United States the\r\nnewspapers printed them in a spirit of fairness.  They gave the other\r\nside, and in the beginning they were more or less accurate.  But when\r\ninternational relations between the two countries became critical the\r\nnews began to be distorted in Berlin.  At each crisis, as at the time\r\nof the sinking of the _Arabic_, the _Ancona_, the _Sussex_ and other\r\nships, the German censorship prevented the American correspondents from\r\nsending the news as they gathered it in Germany and substituted \"news\"\r\nwhich the Krupp interests and the Imperial Foreign Office desired the\r\nAmerican people to believe.  December, 1916, when the German General\r\nStaff began to plan for an unrestricted submarine warfare, especial use\r\nwas made of the \"Overseas News Agency\" to work up sentiment here\r\nagainst President Wilson.  Desperate efforts were made to keep the\r\nUnited States from breaking diplomatic relations.  In December and\r\nJanuary last records of the news despatches in the American newspapers\r\nfrom Berlin show that the Overseas agency was more active than all\r\nAmerican correspondents in Berlin.  Secretary of State Zimmermann,\r\nUnder-secretaries von dem Busche and von Stumm gave frequent interviews\r\nto the so-called \"representatives of the Overseas News Agency.\"  It was\r\nall part of a specific Krupp plan, supported by the Hamburg-American\r\nand the North German Lloyd steamship companies, to divide opinion in\r\nthe United States so that President Wilson would not be supported if he\r\nbroke diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\nGermany, as I have pointed out, has been conducting a two-faced\r\npropaganda.  While working in the United States through her agents and\r\nreservists to create the impression that Germany was friendly, the\r\nGovernment laboured to prepare the German people for war.  The policy\r\nwas to make the American people believe Germany would never do anything\r\nto bring the United States into the war, but to convince the German\r\npublic that America was not neutral and that President Wilson was\r\nscheming against the German race.  Germany was Janus-headed.  Head\r\nNo. 1 said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"America, you are a great nation.  We want your friendship and\r\nneutrality.  We have close business and blood relations, and these\r\nshould not be broken.  Germany is not the barbaric nation her enemies\r\npicture her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHead No. 2, turned toward the German people, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Germans, President Wilson is anti-German.  He wants to prevent us from\r\nstarting an unlimited submarine war.  America has never been neutral,\r\nbecause Washington permits the ammunition factories to supply the\r\nAllies.  These factories are killing your relatives.  We have millions\r\nof German-Americans who will support us.  It will not be long until\r\nMexico will declare war on the United States, and our reservists will\r\nfight for Mexico.  Don't be afraid if Wilson breaks diplomatic\r\nrelations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German press invasion of America began at the beginning of the war.\r\nDr. Dernburg was the first envoy.  He was sent to New York by the same\r\nForeign Office officials and the same Krupp interests which control the\r\nOverseas agency.  Having failed here, he returned to Berlin.  There was\r\nonly one thing to save German propaganda in America.  That was to\r\nmobolise the Sayville and Tuckerton wireless stations, and Germany did\r\nit immediately.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war, when the British censors refused the\r\nAmerican correspondents in Germany the right of telegraphing to the\r\nUnited States via England, the Berlin Government granted permission to\r\nthe United Press, The Associated Press and the _Chicago Daily News_ to\r\nsend wireless news via Sayville.  At first this news was edited by the\r\ncorrespondents of these associations and newspapers in Berlin.  Later,\r\nwhen the individual correspondents began to demand more space on the\r\nwireless, the news sent jointly to these papers was cut down.  This\r\nunofficial league of American papers was called the \"War-Union.\"  The\r\nnews which this union sent was German, but it was written by trained\r\nAmerican writers.  When the Government saw the value of this service to\r\nthe United States it began to send wireless news of its own.  Then the\r\nKrupp interests appeared, and the Overseas News Agency was organised.\r\nAt that moment the Krupp invasion of the United States began and\r\ncontributed 800,000 marks annually to this branch of propaganda alone.\r\n\r\nDr. Hammann, for ten years chief of the Berlin Foreign Office\r\npropaganda department, was selected as president of the Overseas News\r\nAgency.  The Krupp interests, which had been subscribing 400,000 marks\r\nannually to this agency, subscribed the same amount to the reorganised\r\ncompany.  Then, believing that another agency could be organised,\r\nsubscribed 400,000 marks more to the Transocean News Agency.  Because\r\nthere was so much bitterness and rivalry between the officials of the\r\ntwo concerns, the Government stepped in and informed the Overseas News\r\nAgency that it could send only \"political news,\" while the Trans-ocean\r\nwas authorised to send \"economic and social news\" via Sayville and\r\nTuckerton.\r\n\r\nThis news, however, was not solely for the United States.  Krupp's eyes\r\nwere on Mexico and South America, so agents were appointed in\r\nWashington and New York to send the Krupp-bred wireless news from New\r\nYork by cable to South America and Mexico.  Obviously the same news\r\nwhich was sent to the United States could not be telegraphed to Mexico\r\nand South America, because Germany had a different policy toward these\r\ncountries.  The United States was on record against an unlimited\r\nsubmarine warfare.  Mexico and South America were not.  Brazil, which\r\nhas a big German population, was considered an un-annexed German\r\ncolony.  News to Brazil, therefore, had to be coloured differently than\r\nnews to New York.  Some of the colouring was done in Berlin; some in\r\nNew York by Krupp's agents here.  As a result of Germany's anti-United\r\nStates propaganda in South America and Mexico, these countries did not\r\nfollow President Wilson when he broke diplomatic relations with Berlin.\r\nWhile public sentiment might have been against Germany, it was, to a\r\ncertain degree, antagonistic to the United States.\r\n\r\nObviously, Germany had to have friends in this country to assist her,\r\nor what was being done would be traced too directly to the German\r\nGovernment.  So Germany financed willing German-Americans in their\r\npropaganda schemes.  And because no German could cross the ocean except\r\nwith a falsified neutral passport, Germany had to depend upon\r\nGerman-Americans with American passports to bring information over.\r\nThese German-Americans, co-operating with some of the Americans in\r\nBerlin, kept informing the Foreign Office, the army and navy as well as\r\ninfluential Reichstag members that the real power behind the government\r\nover here was not the press and public opinion but the nine million\r\nAmericans who were directly or indirectly related to Germany.  During\r\nthis time the Government felt so sure that it could rely upon the\r\nso-called German-Americans that the Government considered them as a\r\nGerman asset whenever there was a submarine crisis.\r\n\r\nWhen Henry Morgenthau, former American Ambassador to Turkey, passed\r\nthrough Berlin, en route to the United States, he conferred with\r\nZimmermann, who was then Under Secretary of State.  During the course\r\nof one of their conversations Zimmermann said the United States would\r\nnever go to war with Germany, \"because the German-Americans would\r\nrevolt.\"  That was one of Zimmermann's hobbies.  Zimmermann told other\r\nAmerican officials and foreign correspondents that President Wilson\r\nwould not be able to bring the United States to the brink of war,\r\nbecause the \"German-Americans were too powerful.\"\r\n\r\nBut Zimmermann was not making these statements upon his own authority.\r\nHe was being kept minutely advised about conditions here through the\r\nGerman spy system and by German-American envoys, who came to Berlin to\r\nreport on progress the German-Americans were making here in politics\r\nand in Congress.\r\n\r\nZimmermann was so \"dead sure\" he was right in expecting a large portion\r\nof Americans to be disloyal that one time during a conversation with\r\nAmbassador Gerard he said that he believed Wilson was only bluffing in\r\nhis submarine notes.  When Zimmermann was Under Secretary of State I\r\nused to see him very often.  His conversation would contain questions\r\nlike these:\r\n\r\n\"Well, how is your English President?  Why doesn't your President do\r\nsomething against England?\"\r\n\r\nZimmermann was always in close touch with the work of Captains von\r\nPapen and Boy-Ed when they were in this country.  He was one of the\r\nchief supports of the little group of intriguers in Berlin who directed\r\nGerman propaganda here.  Zimmermann was the man who kept Baron Mumm von\r\nSchwarzenstein, former Ambassador to Tokyo, in the Foreign Office in\r\nBerlin as chief of foreign propaganda and intrigue in America and\r\nChina.  Mumm had been here as Minister Extra-ordinary several years ago\r\nand knew how Germany's methods could be used to the best purpose,\r\nnamely, to divide American sentiment.  Then, when Zimmermann succeeded\r\nJagow he ousted Mumm because Mumm had become unpopular with higher\r\nGovernment authorities.\r\n\r\nOne day in Berlin, just before the recall of the former German military\r\nand naval attaches in Washington, I asked Zimmermann whether Germany\r\nsanctioned what these men had been doing.  He replied that Germany\r\napproved everything they had done \"because they had done nothing more\r\nthan try to keep America out of the war; to prevent American goods\r\nreaching the Allies and to persuade Germans and those of German descent\r\nnot to work in ammunition factories.\"  The same week I overheard in a\r\nBerlin cafe two reserve naval officers discuss plans for destroying\r\nAllied ships sailing from American ports.  One of these men was an\r\nescaped officer of an interned liner at Newport News.  He had escaped\r\nto Germany by way of Italy.  That afternoon when I saw Ambassador\r\nGerard I told him of the conversation of these two men, and also what\r\nZimmermann had said.  The Ambassador had just received instructions\r\nfrom Washington about Boy-Ed and von Papen.\r\n\r\nGerard was furious.\r\n\r\n\"Go tell Zimmermann,\" he said, \"for God's sake to leave America alone.\r\nIf he keeps this up he'll drag us into the war.  The United States\r\nwon't stand this sort of thing indefinitely.\"\r\n\r\nThat evening I went back to the Foreign Office and saw Zimmermann for a\r\nfew minutes.  I asked him why it was that Germany, which was at peace\r\nwith the United States, was doing everything within her power to make\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Germany is not doing anything to make you go to war,\" he replied.\r\n\"Your President seems to want war.  Germany is not responsible for what\r\nthe German-Americans are doing.  They are your citizens, not ours.\r\nGermany must not be held responsible for what those people do.\"\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the fact that the American Government was fully\r\nadvised about Zimmermann's intrigues in the United States this remark\r\nmight be accepted on its face.  The United States knew that Germany was\r\nhaving direct negotiations with German-Americans in the United States.\r\nMen came to Germany with letters of introduction from leading\r\nGerman-Americans here, with the expressed purpose of trying to get\r\nGermany to stop its propaganda here.  What they did do was to assure\r\nGermany that the German-Americans would never permit the United States\r\nto be drawn into the war.  Because of their high recommendations from\r\nGermans here some of them had audiences with the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nGermany had been supporting financially some Americans, as the State\r\nDepartment has proof of checks which have been given to American\r\ncitizens for propaganda and spy work.\r\n\r\nI know personally of one instance where General Director Heinicken, of\r\nthe North German-Lloyd, gave an American in Berlin $1,000 for his\r\nreports on American conditions.  The name cannot be mentioned because\r\nthere are no records to prove the transaction, although the man\r\nreceiving this money came to me and asked me to transmit $250 to his\r\nmother through the United Press office.  I refused.\r\n\r\nWhen Zimmermann began to realise that Germany's threatening propaganda\r\nin the United States and Germany's plots against American property were\r\nnot succeeding in frightening the United States away from war, he began\r\nto look forward to the event of war.  He saw, as most Germans did, that\r\nit would be a long time before the United States could get forces to\r\nEurope in a sufficient number to have a decisive effect upon the war.\r\nHe began to plan with the General Staff and the Navy to league Mexico\r\nagainst America for two purposes.  One, Germany figured that a war with\r\nMexico would keep the United States army and navy busy over here.\r\nFurther, Zimmermann often said to callers that if the United States\r\nwent to war with Mexico it would not be possible for American factories\r\nto send so much ammunition and so many supplies to the Allies.\r\n\r\nGerman eyes turned to Mexico.  As soon as President Wilson recognised\r\nCarranza as President, Germany followed with a formal recognition.\r\nZubaran Capmany, who had been Mexican representative in Washington, was\r\nsent to Berlin as Carranza's Minister.  Immediately upon his arrival\r\nZimmermann began negotiations with him.  Reports of the negotiations\r\nwere sent to Washington.  The State Department was warned that unless\r\nthe United States solved the \"Mexican problem\" immediately Germany\r\nwould prepare to attack us through Mexico.  German reservists were\r\ntipped off to be ready to go to Mexico upon a moment's notice.  Count\r\nvon Bernstorff and the German Consuls in the United States were\r\ninstructed, and Bernstorff, who was acting as the general director of\r\nGerman interests in North and South America, was told to inform the\r\nGerman officials in the Latin-American countries.  At the same time\r\nGerman financial interests began to purchase banks, farms and mines in\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DOWNFALL OF VON TIRPITZ AND VON FALKENHAYN\r\n\r\nAfter the sinking of the _Arabic_ the German Foreign Office intimated\r\nto the United States Government and to the American correspondents that\r\nmethods of submarine warfare would be altered and that ships would be\r\nwarned before they were torpedoed.  But when the Navy heard that the\r\nForeign Office was inclined to listen to Mr. Wilson's protests it made\r\nno attempt to conceal its opposition.  Gottlieb von Jagow, the\r\nSecretary of State, although he was an intimate friend of the Kaiser\r\nand an officer in the German Army, was at heart a pacifist.  Every time\r\nan opportunity presented itself he tried to mobilise the peace forces\r\nof the world to make peace.  From time to time, the German financiers\r\nand propaganda leaders in the United States, as well as influential\r\nGermans in the neutral European countries, sent out peace \"feelers.\"\r\nVon Jagow realised that the sooner peace was made, the better it would\r\nbe for Germany and the easier it would be for the Foreign Office to\r\ndefeat the military party at home.  He saw that the more victories the\r\narmy had and the more victories it could announce to the people the\r\nmore lustful the General Staff would be for a war of exhaustion.  Army\r\nleaders have always had more confidence in their ability to defeat the\r\nworld than the Foreign Office.  The army looked at the map of Europe\r\nand saw so many hundred thousand square miles of territory under\r\noccupation.  The Foreign Office saw Germany in its relation to the\r\nworld.  Von Jagow knew that every new square mile of territory gained\r\nwas being paid for, not only by the cost of German blood, but by the\r\nmore terrible cost of public opinion and German influence abroad.  But\r\nGermany was under martial law and the Foreign Office had nothing to say\r\nabout military plans.  The Foreign Office also had little to say about\r\nnaval warfare.  The Navy was building submarines as fast as it could\r\nand the number of ships lost encouraged the people to believe that the\r\nmore intensified the submarine war became, the quicker the war would\r\nend in Germany's favour.  So the Navy kept sinking ships and relying\r\nupon the Foreign Office to make excuses and keep America out of the war.\r\n\r\nThe repeated violations of the pledges made by the Foreign Office to\r\nthe United States aroused American public opinion to white heat, and\r\njustly so, because the people here did not understand that the real\r\nsubmarine crisis was not between President Wilson and Berlin but\r\nbetween Admiral von Tirpitz and Secretary von Jagow and their\r\nfollowers.  President Wilson was at the limit of his patience with\r\nGermany and the German people, who were becoming impatient over the\r\nlong drawn out proceedings, began to accept the inspired thinking of\r\nthe Navy and to believe that Wilson was working for the defeat of\r\nGermany by interfering with submarine activities.\r\n\r\nOn February 22nd, 1916, in one of my despatches I said: \"The patient\r\nattitude toward America displayed during the _Lusitania_ negotiations,\r\nit is plain to-day, no longer exists because of the popular feeling\r\nthat America has already hindered so many of Germany's plans.\"  At that\r\ntime it appeared to observers in Berlin that unless President Wilson\r\ncould show more patience than the German Government the next submarine\r\naccident would bring about a break in relations.  Commenting on this\r\ndespatch the _Indianapolis News_ the next day said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In this country the people feel that all the patience has been shown\r\nby their government.  We believe that history will sustain that view.\r\nAlmost ten months ago more than 100 American citizens were deliberately\r\ndone to death by the German Government, for it is understood that the\r\nsubmarine commander acted under instructions, and that Germany refuses\r\nto disavow on the ground that the murderous act was the act of the\r\nGerman Government.  Yet, after all this time, the _Lusitania_ case is\r\nstill unsettled.  The administration has, with marvellous\r\nself-restraint, recognised that public opinion in Germany was not\r\nnormal, and for that reason it has done everything in its power to\r\nsmooth the way to a settlement by making it as easy as possible for the\r\nImperial Government to meet our just demands.  Indeed, the President\r\nhas gone so far as to expose himself to severe criticism at home.  We\r\nbelieve that he would have been sustained if he had, immediately after\r\nthe sinking of the _Lusitania_, broken off diplomatic relations.\r\n\r\n\"But he has stood out against public opinion in his own country, waited\r\nten months for an answer, and done everything that he could in honour\r\ndue to soften the feeling here.  Yet just on the eve of a settlement\r\nthat would have been unsatisfactory to many of our people, Germany\r\nannounced the policy that we had condemned as illegal, and that plainly\r\nis illegal.  The trouble in Berlin is an utter inability to see\r\nanything wrong in the attack on the _Lusitania_, or to appreciate the\r\nsense of horror that was stirred in this country by it.  The idea seems\r\nto be that the policy of frightfulness could be extended to the high\r\nseas without in any way shocking the American people.  Nothing has come\r\nfrom Berlin that indicates any feeling of guilt on the part of the\r\nGerman people or their Government.\r\n\r\n\"In the United States, on the contrary, the act is regarded as one of\r\nthe blackest crimes of history.  And yet, in spite of that feeling, we\r\nhave waited patiently for ten months in the hope that the German\r\nGovernment would do justice, and clear its name of reproach.  Yet now\r\nwe are told that it is Germany that has shown a 'patient attitude,' the\r\nimplication or insinuation being that our long suffering administration\r\nhas been unreasonable and impatient.  That will not be the verdict of\r\nhistory, as it is not the verdict of our own people.  We have made\r\nevery allowance for the conditions existing in Germany, and have\r\nresolutely refused to take advantage of her distress.  We doubt whether\r\nthere is any other government in the world that would have shown the\r\npatience and moderation, under like provocation, that have been shown\r\nby the American Government in these _Lusitania_ negotiations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI sent the editorial to von Jagow, who returned it the next day with\r\nthe brief comment on one of his calling cards: \"With many thanks.\"\r\n\r\nAbout this time Count Reventlow and the other naval writers began to\r\nrefer to everything President Wilson did as a \"bluff.\"  When Col. E. M.\r\nHouse came to Berlin early in 1916, he tried to impress the officials\r\nwith the fact that Mr. Wilson was not only not bluffing, but that the\r\nAmerican people would support him in whatever he did in dealing with\r\nthe German Government.  Mr. Gerard tried too to impress the Foreign\r\nOffice but because he could only deal with that branch of the\r\nGovernment, he could not change the Navy's impression, which was that\r\nWilson would never take a definite stand against Germany.  On the 8th\r\nof February, the _London Times_ printed the following despatch which I\r\nhad sent to the United States:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gerard has been accused of not being forceful enough in dealing\r\nwith the Berlin Foreign Office.  In Berlin he has been criticised for\r\njust the opposite.  It has been stated frequently that he was too\r\naggressive.  The Ambassador's position was that he must carry out Mr.\r\nWilson's ideas.  So he tried for days and weeks to impress officials\r\nwith the seriousness of the situation.  At the critical point in the\r\nnegotiations various unofficial diplomats began to arrive and they\r\nseriously interfered with negotiations.  One of these was a politician\r\nwho through his credentials from Mr. Bryan met many high officials, and\r\ninformed them that President Wilson was writing his notes for 'home\r\nconsumption.'  Mr. Gerard, however, appealed to Washington to know what\r\nwas meant by the moves of this American with authority from Mr. Bryan.\r\nThis was the beginning of the reason for Secretary Bryan's resigning.\r\n\r\n\"Secretary Bryan had informed also former Ambassador Dumba that the\r\nUnited States would never take any position against Germany even though\r\nit was hinted so in the _Lusitania_ note.  Dumba telegraphed this to\r\nVienna and Berlin was informed immediately.  Because of Mr. Gerard's\r\npersonal friendship and personal association with Secretary of State\r\nvon Jagow and Under Secretary of State Zimmermann, he was acquainted\r\nwith Secretary Bryan's move.   He telegraphed to President Wilson and\r\nthe result was the resignation of Mr. Bryan.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, the _Ancona_ was torpedoed and it was officially explained\r\nthat the act was that of an Austrian submarine commander.  Wilson's\r\nnote to Vienna brought about a near rupture between Austria-Hungary and\r\nGermany because Austria and Hungary at that time were much opposed to\r\nGermany's submarine methods.  Although the submarines operating in the\r\nMediterranean were flying the Austrian flag, they were German\r\nsubmarines, and members of the crews were German.  Throughout the life\r\nof the Emperor Franz Josef the Dual Monarchy was ruled, not from\r\nVienna, but from Budapest by Count Stefan Tisza, the Hungarian Premier.\r\nI was in Budapest at the time and one evening saw Count Tisza at his\r\npalace, which stands on the rocky cliff opposite the main part of\r\nBudapest, and which overlooks the valley of the Danube for many miles.\r\nTisza, as well as all Hungarians, is pro-American before he is\r\npro-German.\r\n\r\n\"To think of trouble between Austria-Hungary and the United States is\r\nsheer nonsense,\" he said in his quiet but forceful manner.  \"I must\r\nconfess, however, that we were greatly surprised to get the American\r\nnote.  It is far from our intention to get into any quarrel with\r\nAmerica.  Perhaps I should not say quarrel, because I know it would not\r\nbe that, but of course matters do not depend upon us entirely.  There\r\nis no reason for any trouble over the _Ancona_ question.  It must be\r\nsettled satisfactorily,\" he said emphatically, \"not only from the\r\nstandpoint of the United States, but from our standpoint.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Ancona_ crisis brought the Foreign Office new and unexpected\r\nsupport.  Hungary was opposed to a dispute with America.  In the first\r\nplace, Hungarians are more of a liberty loving people than the Germans,\r\nand public opinion in Hungary rules the country.  While there is a\r\nstrong Government press, which is loyal to the Tisza party, there is an\r\nequally powerful opposition press which follows the leadership of Count\r\nAlbert Apponyi and Count Julius Andrassy, the two most popular men in\r\nHungarian public life.  Apponyi told me on one occasion that while the\r\nGovernment was controlled by Tisza a great majority of the people sided\r\nwith the opposition.  He added that the constant antagonism of the\r\nLiberals and Democrats kept the Government within bounds.\r\n\r\nHungarians resented the stain upon their honour of the _Ancona_\r\nincident and they were on the verge of compelling Berlin to assume\r\nresponsibility for the sinking and adjust the matter.  But Berlin\r\nfeared that if the _Ancona_ crime was accredited to the real murderers\r\nit would bring about another, and perhaps a fatal crisis with the\r\nUnited States.  So Vienna assumed responsibility and promised to punish\r\nthe submarine commander who torpedoed the ship.\r\n\r\nThis opposition from Hungary embittered the German Navy but it was\r\nhelpless.  The growing fear of the effects which President Wilson's\r\nnotes were having upon Americans and upon the outside neutral world\r\ncaused opposition to von Tirpitz to gain more force.  In desperation\r\nvon Tirpitz and his followers extended the anti-American propaganda and\r\nbegan personal attacks upon von Bethmann-Hollweg.\r\n\r\nBitterness between these two men became so great that neither of them\r\nwould go to the Great Headquarters to confer with the Kaiser if the\r\nother was there.  The personal opposition reached the point where the\r\nKaiser could not keep both men in his cabinet.  Von Tirpitz, who\r\nthought he was the hero of the German people because of the submarine\r\npolicy, believed he had so much power that he could shake the hold\r\nwhich the Kaiser had upon the people and frighten the Emperor into the\r\nbelief that unless he supported him against the Chancellor and the\r\nUnited States, the people would overthrow the Hohenzollern dynasty.\r\nBut von Tirpitz had made a good many personal enemies especially among\r\nfinanciers and business men.  So the Kaiser, instead of ousting the\r\nChancellor, asked von Tirpitz to resign and appointed Admiral von\r\nCapelle, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy and a friend of the\r\nChancellor, as von Tirpitz' successor.  Admiral von Mueller, Chief of\r\nthe Naval Cabinet, who was always at Great Headquarters as the Kaiser's\r\npersonal adviser on naval affairs, was opposed to von Tirpitz and\r\nexposed him at the Great Headquarters conferences by saying that von\r\nTirpitz had falsified the Navy's figures as to the number of submarines\r\navailable for a blockade of England.  Von Capelle supported von Mueller\r\nand when the friends of von Tirpitz in the Reichstag demanded an\r\nexplanation for the ousting of their idol, both the Chancellor and von\r\nCapelle explained that Germany could not continue submarine warfare\r\nwhich von Tirpitz had started, because of the lack of the necessary\r\nsubmarines.\r\n\r\nThis was the first big victory of the Foreign Office.  The democratic\r\nforces in Germany which had been fighting von Tirpitz for over a year\r\nwere jubilant.  Every one in Germany who realised that not until the\r\nhold of the military party upon the Kaiser and the Government was\r\ndislodged, would the Government be able to make peace now breathed\r\nsighs of relief and began to make plans for the adjustment of all\r\ndifferences with the United States and for a peace without annexation.\r\nVon Tirpitz had had the support of all the forces in Germany which\r\nlooked forward to the annexation of Belgium and the richest portions of\r\nNorthern France.  Von Tirpitz was supported by the men who wanted the\r\neastern border of Germany extended far into Poland and Lithuania.\r\n\r\nEven Americans were delighted.  Washington for the first time began to\r\nsee that eleven months of patience was bearing fruit.  But this period\r\nof exaltation was not destined to last very long.  While the Chancellor\r\nhad cleaned house in the Navy Department at Berlin he had overlooked\r\nKiel.  There were admirals and officers in charge there who were making\r\npreparations for the Navy.  They were the men who talked to the\r\nsubmarine commanders before they started out on their lawless sea\r\nvoyages.\r\n\r\nOn March 24th the whole world was shocked by another U-boat crime.  The\r\n_Sussex_, a French channel steamer, plying between Folkstone and\r\nDieppe, was torpedoed without warning and Americans were among the\r\npassengers killed and wounded.  When the news reached Berlin, not only\r\nthe Chancellor and the Foreign Office were shocked and horrified, but\r\nthe American Embassy began to doubt whether the Chancellor really meant\r\nwhat he said when he informed Gerard confidentially that now that von\r\nTirpitz was gone there would be no new danger from the submarines.\r\nEven the new Admiralty administration was loathe to believe that a\r\nGerman submarine was responsible.\r\n\r\nBy April 5th it was apparent to every one in Berlin that there would be\r\nanother submarine crisis with the United States and that the\r\nreactionary forces in Germany would attempt again to overthrow the\r\nChancellor.  Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, who had been doing everything\r\npossible to get some one to propose peace, decided to address the\r\nReichstag again on Germany's peace aims.  It was announced in the\r\nnewspapers only a few days beforehand.  The demand for tickets of\r\nadmission was so great that early in the morning on the day scheduled\r\nfor the address such dense crowds surrounded the Reichstag building\r\nthat the police had to make passages so the military automobiles could\r\nreach the building to bring the officials there.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber itself was crowded to the rafters.  On the floor of the\r\nHouse practically every member was in his seat.  On the rostrum were\r\nseveral hundred army and naval officers, all members of the cabinet,\r\nprominent business men and financiers.  Every one awaited the entrance\r\nof the Chancellor with great expectations.  The National Liberals, who\r\nhad been clamouring for the annexation of Belgium, the conservatives,\r\nwho wanted a stronger war policy against England, the Socialists, who\r\nwanted real guarantees for the German people for the future and a peace\r\nwithout annexation, sat quietly in their seats anxiously awaiting the\r\nChancellor's remarks which were expected to satisfy all wants.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor entered the chamber from the rear of the rostrum and\r\nproceeded to his desk in the front platform row, facing the House and\r\ngalleries.  After a few preliminary remarks by President Kaempf, the\r\nChancellor arose.  To the Chancellor's left, near the rear of the hall\r\namong his Socialist colleagues, sat a nervous, determined and defiant\r\nradical.  He was dressed in the uniform of a common soldier.  Although\r\nhe had been at the front several months and in the firing line, he had\r\nnot received the iron cross of the second class which practically every\r\nsoldier who had seen service had been decorated with.  His clothes were\r\nsoiled, trousers stuffed into the top of heavy military boots.  His\r\nthick, curly hair was rumpled.  At this session of the Reichstag the\r\nChancellor was to have his first encounter with Dr. Karl Liebknecht,\r\nthe Socialist radical, who in his soldier's uniform was ready to\r\nchallenge anything the Chancellor said.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor began his address, as he began all others, by referring\r\nto the strong military position of the German army.  He led up,\r\ngradually, to the subject of peace.  When the Chancellor said: \"We\r\ncould have gotten what we wanted by peaceful work.  Our enemies chose\r\nwar.\"  Liebknecht interjected in his sharp, shrill voice, \"_You_ chose\r\nthe war!\"  There was great excitement and hissing; the President called\r\nfor order.  Members shouted: \"Throw him out!\"  But Liebknecht sat there\r\nmore determined than ever.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor continued for a few minutes until he reached the\r\ndiscussion of the establishment of a Flemish nation in Belgium, when\r\nLiebknecht again interrupted, but the Chancellor continued: \"Gentlemen,\r\nwe want neighbours who will not again unite against us in order to\r\nstrangle us, but such that we can work with them and they with us to\r\nour mutual advantage.\"  A storm of applause greeted this remark.\r\nLiebknecht was again on his feet and shouted, \"Then you will fall upon\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Europe which will arise from this, the most gigantic of all\r\ncrises, will in many respects not resemble the old one,\" continued von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg.  \"The blood which has been shed will never come back;\r\nthe wealth which has been wasted will come back but only slowly.  In\r\nany case, it must become, for all living in it, a Europe of peaceful\r\nlabour.  The peace which shall end this war must be a lasting one and\r\nnot containing the germ of a fresh war, but establishing a final and\r\npeaceful order of things in European affairs.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the applause had gotten a good start the fiery private in the\r\nSocialists' rank was again on his feet, this time shouting, \"Liberate\r\nthe German people first!\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the Chancellor's speech there was not one reference to the\r\nSussex.  The Chancellor was anxious if he could to turn the world's\r\nattention from the Sussex to the larger question of peace, but the\r\nworld was not so inclined.  On the 18th of April I asked Admiral von\r\nHoltzendorff, Chief of the Admiralty Staff, for his opinion about the\r\n_Sussex_.  Two days later he approved the interview, in which I quoted\r\nhim as saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We did not sink the _Sussex_.  I am as convinced of that as of\r\nanything which has happened in this war.  If you read the definite\r\ninstructions, the exact orders each submarine commander has you would\r\nunderstand that the torpedoing of the _Sussex_ was impossible.  Many of\r\nour submarines have returned from rounding up British vessels.  They\r\nsighted scores of passenger ships going between England and America but\r\nnot one of these was touched.\r\n\r\n\"We have definitely agreed to warn the crews and passengers of\r\npassenger liners.  We have lived up to that promise in every way.  We\r\nare not out to torpedo without warning neutral ships bound for England.\r\nOur submarines have respected every one of them so far, and they have\r\nmet scores in the North Sea, the Channel and the Atlantic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day that Ambassador Gerard handed von Jagow Secretary\r\nLansing's note, Under Secretary of State Zimmermann approved the von\r\nHoltzendorff interview.  Zimmermann could not make himself believe that\r\na German submarine was responsible and the Government had decided to\r\ndisavow all responsibility.  But such convincing reports began to\r\narrive from the United States and from neutral European countries which\r\nproved beyond a doubt that a German submarine was responsible, that the\r\nGovernment had to again bring up the submarine issue at Great\r\nHeadquarters.  When the von Holtzendorff interview was published in the\r\nUnited States it caused a sensation because if Germany maintained the\r\nattitude which the Chief of the Admiralty Staff had taken with the\r\napproval of the Foreign Office, a break in diplomatic relations could\r\nnot be avoided.  Secretary Lansing telegraphed Ambassador Gerard to\r\ninquire at the Foreign Office whether the statements of von\r\nHoltzendorff represented the opinions of the German Government.  Gerard\r\ncalled me to the Embassy but before I arrived Dr. Heckscher, of the\r\nReichstag Foreign Relations Committee, came.  Gerard called me in in\r\nHeckscher's presence to ask if I knew that the von Holtzendorff\r\ninterview would bring about a break in diplomatic relations unless it\r\nwas immediately disavowed.  He told Dr. Heckscher to inform Zimmermann\r\nthat if the Chief of the Admiralty Staff was going to direct Germany's\r\nforeign policies he would ask his government to accredit him to the\r\nnaval authorities and not to the Foreign Office.  Heckscher would not\r\nbelieve my statement that Zimmermann had approved the interview and\r\nassured Gerard that within a very short time the Foreign Office would\r\ndisavow von Holtzendorff's statements.  When he arrived at the Foreign\r\nOffice, however, Zimmermann not only refused to disavow the Admiral's\r\nstatement but informed Heckscher that he had the same opinions.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson was at the end of his patience.  Probably he began to\r\ndoubt whether he could rely upon the reports of Ambassador Gerard that\r\nthere was a chance of the democratic forces in Germany coming out ahead\r\nof the military caste.  Wilson showed his attitude plainly in the\r\n_Sussex_ note when he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The Government of the United States has been very patient.  At every\r\nstage of this distressing experience of tragedy after tragedy it has\r\nsought to be governed by the most thoughtful considerations of the\r\nextraordinary circumstances of an unprecedented war and to be guided by\r\nsentiments of very genuine friendship for the people and the Government\r\nof Germany.  It has accepted the successive explanations and assurances\r\nof the Imperial Government as of course given in entire sincerity and\r\ngood faith, and has hoped even against hope that it would prove to be\r\npossible for the Imperial Government so to order and control the acts\r\nof its naval commanders as to square its policy with the recognised\r\nprinciples of humanity as embodied in the law of nations.  It has made\r\nevery allowance for unprecedented conditions and has been willing to\r\nwait until the facts became unmistakable and were susceptible of only\r\none interpretation.  It now owes it to a just regard, for its own\r\nrights to say to the Imperial Government that that time has come.  It\r\nhas become painfully evident to it that the position which it took at\r\nthe very outset is inevitable, namely that the use of submarines for\r\nthe destruction of enemy commerce is of necessity, because of the very\r\ncharacter of the vessels employed and the very methods, of attack which\r\ntheir employment of course involves, utterly incompatible with the\r\nprinciples of humanity, the long established and incontrovertible\r\nrights of neutrals and the sacred immunities of non-combatants.\r\n\r\n\"If it is still the purpose of the Imperial Government to prosecute\r\nrelentless and indiscriminate warfare against vessels of commerce by\r\nthe use of submarines without regard to what the Government of the\r\nUnited States must consider the sacred and indisputable rules of\r\ninternational law and the universally recognised dictates of humanity,\r\nthe Government of the United States is at last forced to the conclusion\r\nthat there is but one course it can pursue.  Unless the Imperial\r\nGovernment should now immediately declare and effect an abandonment of\r\nits present methods of submarine warfare against passenger and freight\r\ncarrying vessels, the Government of the United States can have no\r\nchoice but to sever diplomatic relations with the German Government\r\naltogether.  This action the Government of the United States\r\ncontemplates with the greatest reluctance but feels constrained to take\r\nin behalf of humanity and the rights of neutral nations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter von Jagow read the note the Foreign Office Telegraph Bureau sent\r\nit to Great Headquarters, which at this time was still located in\r\nCharleville, France, for the information of the Kaiser and General von\r\nFalkenhayn.  It was evident to every one in Berlin that again, not only\r\nthe submarine issue was to be debated at Great Headquarters, but that\r\nthe Kaiser was to be forced again to decide between the Chancellor and\r\nhis democratic supporters and von Falkenhayn and the military party.\r\nBefore the Conference convened General Headquarters sent inquiries to\r\nfive government departments, the Foreign Office, the Navy, the Ministry\r\nof War, the Treasury, and Interior.  The Ministers at the head of these\r\ndepartments were asked to state whether in their opinion the\r\ncontroversy with America should be adjusted, or whether the submarine\r\nwarfare should be continued.  Dr. Karl Helfferich, the Vice Chancellor\r\nand Minister of Interior, Secretary of State von Jagow, and Count von\r\nRoedern, Minister of Finance, replied to adjust the difficulty.  The\r\nArmy and Navy said in effect: \"If you can adjust it without stopping\r\nthe submarine warfare and without breaking with the United States do\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter part of April the Kaiser summoned all of his ministers and\r\nhis leading generals to the French chateau which he used as his\r\nheadquarters in Charleville.  This city is one of the most picturesque\r\ncities in the occupied districts of northern France.  It is located on\r\nthe banks of the Meuse and contains many historic, old ruins.  At one\r\nend of the town is a large stone castle, surrounded by a moat.  This\r\nwas made the headquarters of the General Staff after the Germans\r\ninvaded this section of France.  Near the railroad station there was a\r\npublic park.  Facing it was a French chateau, a beautiful, comfortable\r\nhome.  This was the Kaiser's residence.  All streets leading in this\r\ndirection were barricaded and guarded by sentries.  No one could pass\r\nwithout a special written permit from the Chief of the General Staff.\r\nVon Falkenhayn had his home nearby in another of the beautiful chateaux\r\nthere.  The chief of every department of the General Staff lived in\r\nprincely fashion in houses which in peace time were homes for\r\ndistinguished Frenchmen.  There were left in Charleville scarcely a\r\nhundred French citizens, because obviously French people, who were\r\nenemies of Germany, could not he permitted to go back and forth in the\r\ncity which was the centre of German militarism.\r\n\r\nWhen the ministers arrived at the Kaiser's headquarters, His Majesty\r\nasked each one to make a complete report on the submarine war as it\r\naffected his department.  Dr. Helfferich was asked to go into the\r\nquestion of German finance and the relation of America to it.  Dr.\r\nSolf, the Colonial Minister, who had been a very good friend of\r\nAmbassador Gerard, discussed the question of the submarine warfare from\r\nthe stand-point of its relation to Germany's position as a world power.\r\nAdmiral von Capelle placed before the Kaiser the figures of the number\r\nof ships sunk, their tonnage, the number of submarines operating, the\r\nnumber under construction and the number lost.  General von Falkenhayn\r\nreported on the military situation and discussed the hypothetical\r\nquestion as to what effect American intervention would have upon the\r\nEuropean war theatres.\r\n\r\nWhile the conferences were going on, Dr. Heckscher and Under Secretary\r\nZimmermann, who at that time were anxious to avoid a break with the\r\nUnited States, sounded Ambassador Gerard as to whether he would be\r\nwilling to go to Great Headquarters to confer with the Kaiser.  The\r\nForeign Office at the same time suggested the matter to the General\r\nStaff and within a few hours Mr. Gerard was invited to go to\r\nCharleville.  Before the ambassador arrived the Kaiser called all of\r\nhis ministers together for a joint session and asked them to make a\r\nbrief summary of their arguments.  This was not a peace meeting.  Not\r\nonly opponents of submarine warfare but its advocates mobilised all\r\ntheir forces in a final attempt to win the Kaiser's approval.  His\r\nMajesty, at this time, was inclined towards peace with America and was\r\nvery much impressed by the arguments which the Chancellor and Dr.\r\nHelfferich presented.  But, at this meeting, while Helfferich was\r\ntalking and pointing to the moral effect which the ruthless torpedoing\r\nof ships was having upon neutral countries, von Falkenhayn interrupted\r\nwith the succinct statement:\r\n\r\n\"Neutrals?  Damn the neutrals!  Win the war!  Our task is to win.  If\r\nwe win we will have the neutrals with us; if we lose we lose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Falkenhayn, when you are versed in foreign affairs I'll ask you to\r\nspeak,\" interrupted the Kaiser.  \"Proceed, Dr. Helfferich.\"\r\n\r\nGentleman that he is, von Falkenhayn accepted the Imperial rebuke, but\r\nnot long afterward his resignation was submitted.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these conferences and the arguments advanced by\r\nAmbassador Gerard, Secretary von Jagow on May 4th handed the Ambassador\r\nthe German note in reply to President Wilson's _Sussex_ ultimatum.  In\r\nthis communication Germany said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Fully conscious of its strength, the German Government has twice in\r\nthe course of the past few months expressed itself before all the world\r\nas prepared to conclude a peace safeguarding the vital interests of\r\nGermany.  In doing so, it gave expression to the fact that it was not\r\nits fault if peace was further withheld from the peoples of Europe.\r\nWith a correspondingly greater claim of justification, the German\r\nGovernment may proclaim its unwillingness before mankind and history to\r\nundertake the responsibility, after twenty-one months of war, to allow\r\nthe controversy that has arisen over the submarine question to take a\r\nturn which might seriously affect the maintenance of peace between\r\nthese two nations.\r\n\r\n\"The German Government guided by this idea notifies the Government of\r\nthe United States _that instructions have been issued to German naval\r\ncommanders that the precepts of the general international fundamental\r\nprinciples be observed as regards stopping, searching and destruction\r\nof merchant vessels within the war zone and that such vessels shall not\r\nbe sunk without warning and without saving human life unless the ship\r\nattempts to escape or offers resistance_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war it was a group of military leaders\r\nconsisting of General von Moltke, General von Falkenhayn, General von\r\nMackensen, General von Herringen, Grand Admiral von Tirpitz, and a few\r\nof the Prussian military clique, which prevailed upon the Kaiser to go\r\nto war after the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne and\r\nhis wife.  The Allies proclaimed in their publications, in the press\r\nand in Parliaments that they were fighting to destroy and overthrow the\r\nmilitary party in Germany which could make war without public consent.\r\nMillions of Allied soldiers were mobilised and fighting in almost a\r\ncomplete ring surrounding Germany, Austria Hungary, Bulgaria and\r\nTurkey.  They had been fighting since August, 1914, for twenty-one\r\nmonths, and still their fighting had not shattered or weakened the hold\r\nwhich the military party had upon the people and the Kaiser.  Von\r\nTirpitz and von Falkenhayn, who, shortly after the war began, became\r\nthe ringleaders of Germany's organised Might, had fallen not _before\r\nthe armed foes on the battlefield but before an unarmed nation with a\r\npresident whose only weapon was public opinion_.  First, von Tirpitz\r\nfell because he was ready to defy the United States.  Then came the\r\ndownfall of von Falkenhayn, because he was prepared to damn the United\r\nStates and all neutrals.  Surely a nation and a government after\r\nthirteen months of patience and hope had a right to believe that after\r\nall public opinion was a weapon which was sometimes more effective than\r\nany other.  Mr. Wilson and the State Department were justified in\r\nfeeling that their policy toward Germany was after all successful not\r\nalone because it had solved the vexing submarine issue, but because it\r\nhad aided the forces of democracy in Germany.  Because, with the\r\ndownfall of von Falkenhayn and von Tirpitz, there was only one\r\nrecognised authority in Germany.  That was the Chancellor and the\r\nForeign Office, supported almost unanimously by the Socialists and by\r\nthe Liberal forces which were at work to reform the German Government.\r\n\r\nBut this was in May, 1916, scarcely eight months before the Kaiser\r\n_changed his mind and again decided to support the people who were\r\nclamouring for a ruthless, murderous, defiant war against the whole\r\nworld_, if the world was \"foolish\" enough to join in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF NEW ORIENTATION\r\n\r\nDr. Karl Liebknecht, after he had challenged the Chancellor on the 4th\r\nof April, became the object of attack by the military authorities.  The\r\nChancellor, although he is the real Minister of Foreign Affairs, is,\r\nalso, a Major General in the Army and for a private like Liebknecht to\r\ntalk to a Major General as he did in the Reichstag was contrary to all\r\nrules and precedents in the Prussian Army.  The army was ready to send\r\nLiebknecht to the firing squad and it was only a short time until they\r\nhad an opportunity to arrest him.  Liebknecht started riots in some of\r\nthe ammunition factories and one night at Potsdamer Platz, dressed in\r\ncivilian clothes, he shouted, \"Down with the Government,\" and started\r\nto address the passers-by.  He was seized immediately by government\r\ndetectives, who were always following him, and taken to the police\r\nstation.  His home was searched and when the trial began the papers,\r\nfound there, were placed before the military tribunal as evidence that\r\nhe was plotting against the Government.  The trial was secret, and\r\npolice blockaded all streets a quarter of a mile away from the court\r\nwhere he was tried.  Throughout the proceedings which lasted a week the\r\nnewspapers were permitted to print only the information distributed by\r\nthe Wolff Telegraph Bureau.  But public sympathy for Liebknecht was so\r\ngreat that mounted police were kept in every part of the city day and\r\nnight to break up crowds which might assemble.  Behind closed doors,\r\nwithout an opportunity to consult his friends, with only an attorney\r\nappointed by the Government to defend him, Liebknecht was sentenced to\r\ntwo years' hard labour.  His only crime was that he had dared to speak\r\nin the Reichstag the opinions of some of the more radical socialists.\r\n\r\nLiebknecht's imprisonment was a lesson to other Socialist agitators.\r\nThe day after his sentencing was announced there were strikes in nearly\r\nevery ammunition factory in and around Berlin.  Even at Spandau, next\r\nto Essen the largest ammunition manufacturing city in Germany, several\r\nthousand workmen left their benches as a protest, but the German people\r\nhave such terrible fear of the police and of their own military\r\norganisation that they strike only a day and return the next to forget\r\nabout previous events.\r\n\r\nIf there were no other instances in Germany to indicate that there was\r\nthe nucleus for a democracy this would seem to be one.  One might say,\r\ntoo, that if such leaders as Liebknecht could be assisted, the movement\r\nfor more freedom might have more success.\r\n\r\nIt was very difficult for the German public to accept the German reply\r\nto President Wilson's _Sussex_ note.  The people were bitter against\r\nthe United States.  They hated Wilson.  They feared him.  And the idea\r\nof the German Government bending its knee to a man they hated was\r\nenough cause for loud protests.  This feeling among the people found\r\nplenty of outlets.  The submarine advocates, who always had their ears\r\nto the ground, saw that they could take advantage of this public\r\nfeeling at the expense of the Chancellor and the Foreign Office.\r\nPrince von Buelow, the former Chancellor, who had been spending most of\r\nhis time in Switzerland after his failure to keep Italy out of the war,\r\nhad written a book entitled \"Deutsche Politik,\" which was intended to\r\nbe an indictment of von Bethmann-Hollweg's international policies.  Von\r\nBuelow returned to Berlin at the psychological moment and began to\r\nmobilise the forces against the Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gott strafe England.]\r\n\r\nAfter the _Sussex_ dispute was ended the Socialist organ _Vorwaerts_,\r\nsupported by Philip Scheidemann, leader of the majority of the\r\nSocialists, demanded that the Government take some steps toward peace.\r\nBut the General Staff was so busy preparing for the expected Allied\r\noffensive that it had no time to think about peace or about internal\r\nquestions.  When von Falkenhayn resigned and von Hindenburg arrived at\r\nGreat Headquarters to succeed him the two generals met for the first\r\ntime in many months.  (There was bitter feeling between the two.)  Von\r\nFalkenhayn, as he turned the office over to his successor, said:\r\n\r\n\"Has Your Excellency the courage to take over this position now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have always had the courage, Your Excellency,\" replied von\r\nHindenburg, \"but not the soldiers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Reichstag there has been only one real democratic party.  That\r\nis the Socialist.  The National Liberal Party, which has posed as a\r\nreform organisation, is in reality nothing more than the party\r\ncontrolled by the ammunition and war industries.  When these interests\r\nheard that submarine warfare was to be so restricted as to be\r\npractically negligible, they began to sow seeds of discontent among the\r\nammunition makers.  These interests began to plan for the time when the\r\nsubmarine warfare would again be discussed.  Their first scheme was to\r\ntry to overthrow the Chancellor.  If they were not successful then they\r\nintended to take advantage of the democratic movement which was\r\nspreading in Germany to compel the Government to consent to the\r\ncreation of a Reichstag Committee on Foreign Affairs to consult with\r\nthe Foreign Office when all questions of international policy,\r\nincluding submarine warfare, was up for discussion.  Their first policy\r\nwas tried early in July.  Seizing that clause in the German note which\r\nsaid that Germany would hold herself free to change her promises in the\r\n_Sussex_ case if the United States was not successful against England,\r\nthe Navy began to threaten the United States with renewed submarine\r\nwarfare unless President Wilson acted against Great Britain.\r\n\r\nReporting some of these events on June 12th, the _Evening Ledger_ of\r\nPhiladelphia printed the following despatch which I sent:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BERLIN, July 12.--The overthrow of Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg,\r\nchampion of a conciliatory policy toward the United States, and the\r\nunloosing of German submarines within three months, was predicted by\r\nvon Tirpitz supporters here to-day unless President Wilson acts against\r\nthe British blockade.\r\n\r\n\"Members of the Conservative party and those favouring annexation of\r\nterritory conquered by Germany joined in the forecast.  They said the\r\nopinion of America will be disregarded.\r\n\r\n\"A private source, close to the Foreign Office, made this statement\r\nregarding the attempt to unseat Bethmann-Hollweg at a time when the war\r\nis approaching a crisis:\r\n\r\n\"'Unless America does something against England within the next three\r\nmonths there will be a bitter fight against the Chancellor.  One cannot\r\ntell whether he will be able to hold his own against such opposition.\r\nThe future of German-American relations depends upon America.'\r\n\r\n\"Despite this political drive against the man who stood out against a\r\nbreak with the United States in the _Lusitania_ crisis, Americans here\r\nbelieve Bethmann-Hollweg will again emerge triumphant.  They feel\r\ncertain that if the Chancellor appealed to the public for a decision he\r\nwould be supported.\r\n\r\n\"The fight to oust the Chancellor has now grown to such proportions\r\nthat it overshadows in interest the Allied offensive.  The attacks on\r\nthe Chancellor have gradually grown bolder since the appearance of\r\nPrince Buelow's book 'Deutsche Politik,' because this book is believed\r\nto be the opening of Buelow's campaign to oust the Chancellor and step\r\nback into the position he occupied until succeeded by Bethmann-Hollweg\r\nin 1909.\r\n\r\n\"The movement has grown more forceful since the German answer to\r\nPresident Wilson's ultimatum was sent.  The Conservatives accepted the\r\nGerman note as containing a conditional clause, and they have been\r\nwaiting to see what steps the United States would take against England.\r\n\r\n\"Within the past few days I have discussed the situation with leaders\r\nof several parties in the Reichstag.  A National Liberal member of the\r\nReichstag, who was formerly a supporter of von Tirpitz, and the von\r\nTirpitz submarine policies, said he thought Buelow's success showed\r\nthat opposition to America was not dead.\r\n\r\n\"'Who is going to be your next President--Wilson or Hughes?' he asked,\r\nand then, without waiting for an answer, continued:\r\n\r\n\"'If it is Hughes he can be no worse than Wilson.  The worst he can do\r\nis to declare war on Germany and certainly that would be preferable to\r\nthe present American neutrality.\r\n\r\n\"'If this should happen every one in our navy would shout and throw up\r\nhis hat, for it would mean unlimited sea war against England.  Our\r\npresent navy is held in a net of notes.\r\n\r\n\"'What do you think the United States could do?  You could not raise an\r\narmy to help the Allies.  You could confiscate our ships in American\r\nports, but if you tried to use them to carry supplies and munitions to\r\nthe Allies we would sink them.\r\n\r\n\"'Carrying on an unlimited submarine war, we could sink 600,000 tons of\r\nshipping monthly, destroy the entire merchant fleets of the leading\r\npowers, paralyse England and win the war.  Then we would start all\r\nover, build merchantmen faster than any nation, and regain our position\r\nas a leading commercial power.'\r\n\r\n\"Friends of the Chancellor still hope that President Wilson will take a\r\nstrong stand against England, thereby greatly strengthening\r\nBethmann-Hollweg's position.  At present the campaign against the\r\nChancellor is closely connected with internal policies of the\r\nConservatives and the big land owners.  The latter are fighting\r\nBethmann-Hollweg because he promised the people, on behalf of the\r\nKaiser, the enactment of franchise reforms after the war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCommenting on this despatch, the New York _World_ said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not long ago it was the fashion among the opponents of the\r\nAdministration to jeer loudly at the impotent writing of notes.  And\r\neven among the supporters of the Administration there grew an uneasy\r\nfeeling that we had had notes _ad nauseam_.\r\n\r\n\"Yet these plodding and undramatic notes arouse in Germany a feeling\r\nvery different from one of ridicule.  The resentful respect for our\r\nnotes is there admirably summed up by a member of the Reichstag who to\r\nthe correspondent of the United Press exclaimed bitterly: 'Our present\r\nnavy is held in a net of notes.'\r\n\r\n\"Nets may not be so spectacular as knuckle-dusters, but they are\r\nslightly more civilised and generally more efficient.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe National Liberal Reichstag member who was quoted was Dr. Gustav\r\nStressemann.  Stressemann is one of the worst reactionaries in Germany\r\nbut he likes to pose as a progressive.  He was one of the first men to\r\nsuggest that the Reichstag form a committee on foreign relations to\r\nconsult with and have equal power of decision with the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nFor a great many months the Socialist deputies of the Prussian Diet\r\nhave been demanding election reforms.  Their demands were so insistent\r\nthat over a year ago the Chancellor, when he read the Kaiser's address\r\nfrom the throne room in the residence palace in Berlin to the deputies,\r\npromised election reforms in Prussia--after the war.  But during last\r\nsummer the Socialists began to demand immediate election reforms.  To\r\nfurther embarrass the Chancellor and the Government, the National\r\nLiberals made the same demands, knowing all the time that if the\r\nGovernment ever attempted it, they could swing the Reichstag majority\r\nagainst the proposal by technicalities.\r\n\r\nThroughout the summer months the Government could not hush up the\r\nincessant discussion of war aims.  More than one newspaper was\r\nsuppressed for demanding peace or for demanding a statement of the\r\nGovernment's position in regard to Belgium and Northern France.  The\r\npeace movement within Germany grew by leaps and bounds.  The Socialists\r\ndemanded immediate action by the Government.  The Conservatives, the\r\nNational Liberals and the Catholic party wanted peace but only the kind\r\nof a peace which Germany could force upon the Entente.  The Chancellor\r\nand other German leaders tried again throughout the summer and fall to\r\nget the outside world interested in peace but at this time the English\r\nand French attacks on the Somme were engaging the attention and the\r\nresources of the whole world.\r\n\r\nBefore these conflicting movements within Germany can be understood one\r\nmust know something of the organisation of Germany in war time.\r\n\r\nWhen the military leaders of Germany saw that the possibility of\r\ncapturing Paris or of destroying London was small and that a German\r\nvictory, which would fasten Teutonic peace terms on the rest of the\r\nworld, was almost impossible, they turned their eyes to\r\nAustria-Hungary, Bulgaria, the Balkans and Turkey.  Friederich Naumann,\r\nmember of the Progressive Party of the Reichstag, wrote a book on\r\n\"Central Europe,\" describing a great nation stretching from the North\r\nSea to Bagdad, including Germany, all of Austria-Hungary, parts of\r\nSerbia and Roumania and Turkey, with Berlin as the Capital.  It was\r\ntoward this goal which the Kaiser turned the forces of Germany at his\r\ncommand.  If Germany could not rule the world, if Germany could not\r\nconquer the nine nations which the Director of the Post and Telegraph\r\nhad lined up on the 2nd of August, 1914, then Germany could at least\r\nconquer the Dual Monarchy, the Balkans and, Turkey, and even under\r\nthese circumstances come out of the war a greater nation than she\r\nentered it.  But to accomplish this purpose one thing had to be\r\nassured.  That was the control of the armies and navies and the foreign\r\npolicies of these governments.  The old Kaiser Franz Josef was a man\r\nwho guarded everything he had as jealously as a baby guards his toys.\r\nAt one time when it was suggested to the aged monarch that Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary could establish a great kingdom of Poland as a buffer\r\nnation, if he would only give up Galicia as one of the states of this\r\nkingdom, he replied in his childish fashion:\r\n\r\n\"What, those Prussians want to take another pearl out of my crown?\"\r\n\r\nIn June the Austro-Hungarian General Staff conducted an offensive\r\nagainst Italy in the Trentino with more success than the Germans had\r\nanticipated.  But the Austrians had not calculated upon Russia.  In\r\nJuly General Brusiloff attacked the Austrian forces in the\r\nneighbourhood of Lusk, succeeded in persuading or bribing a Bohemian\r\narmy corps to desert and started through the Austrian positions like a\r\nflood over sloping land.  Brusiloff not only took several hundred\r\nthousand prisoners.  He not only broke clear through the Austrian lines\r\nbut he thoroughly demoralised and destroyed the Austrian army as a unit\r\nin the world war.  Von Hindenburg, who had been made Chief of the\r\nGerman General Staff, was compelled to send thousands of troops to the\r\nWohlynian battlefields to stop the Russian invasion.  But von\r\nHindenburg did not look with any degree of satisfaction upon the\r\npossibility of such a thing happening again and informed the Kaiser\r\nthat he would continue as Chief of the General Staff only upon\r\ncondition that he be made chief of all armies allied to Germany.  At a\r\nConference at Great Headquarters at Pless, in Silicia, where offices\r\nwere moved from France as soon as the Field Marshal took charge,\r\nHindenburg was made the leader of all the armed forces in Central\r\nEurope.  Thus by one stroke, really by the aid of Russia, Germany\r\nsucceeded in conquering Austria-Hungary and in taking away from her\r\ncommand all of the forces, naval and military, which she had.  At the\r\nsame time the Bulgarian and Turkish armies were placed at the disposal\r\nof von Hindenburg.  So far so good for the Prussians.\r\n\r\nBut there were still some independent forces left within the Central\r\nPowers.  Hungary was not content to do the bidding of Prussia.\r\nHungarians were not ready to live under orders from Berlin.  Even as\r\nlate as a few months ago when the German Minister of the Interior\r\ncalled a conference in Berlin to mobilise all the food within the\r\nCentral Powers, the Hungarians refused to join a scheme which would rob\r\nthem of food they had jealously guarded and saved since the beginning\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nIn the Dual Monarchy there are many freedom loving people who are\r\nlonging for a deliverer.  Hungary at one time feared Russia but only\r\nbecause of the Czar.  The real and most powerful democratic force among\r\nthe Teutonic allies is located there in Budapest.  I know of no city\r\noutside of the United States where the people have such love of freedom\r\nand where public opinion plays such a big role.  Budapest, even in war\r\ntimes, is one of the most delightful cities in Europe and Hungary, even\r\nas late as last December, was not contaminated by Prussian ideas.  I\r\nsaw Russian prisoners of war walking through the streets and mingling\r\nwith the Hungarian soldiers and people.  American Consul General Coffin\r\ninformed me that there were seven thousand Allied subjects in Budapest\r\nwho were undisturbed.  English and French are much more popular than\r\nGermans.  One day on my first visit in Budapest I asked a policeman in\r\nfront of the Hotel Ritz in German, \"Where is the Reichstag?\"  He shook\r\nhis head and went on about his business regulating the traffic at the\r\nstreet corner.  Then I asked him half in English and half in French\r\nwhere the Parliament was.\r\n\r\nWith a broad smile he said: \"Ah, Monsieur, voila, this street your\r\nright, vis a vis.\"  Not a word of German would he speak.\r\n\r\nAfter the Allied offensive began on the Somme the old friends of von\r\nTirpitz, assisted by Prince von Buelow, started an offensive against\r\nthe Chancellor, with renewed vigour.  This time they were determined to\r\noust him at all costs.  They sent emissaries to the Rhine Valley, which\r\nis dominated by the Krupp ammunition factories.  These emissaries began\r\nby attacking the Chancellor's attitude towards the United States.  They\r\npointed out that Germany could not possibly win the war unless she\r\ndefeated England, and it was easy for any German to see that the only\r\nway England could be attacked was from the seas; that as long as\r\nEngland had her fleet or her merchant ships she could continue the war\r\nand continue to supply the Allies.  It was pointed out to the\r\nammunition makers, also, that they were already fighting the United\r\nStates; that the United States was sending such enormous supplies to\r\nthe Entente, that unless the submarines were used to stop these\r\nsupplies Germany would most certainly be defeated on land.  And, it was\r\nexplained that a defeat on land meant not only the defeat of the German\r\narmy but the defeat of the ammunition interests.\r\n\r\nFrom April to December, 1916, was also the period of pamphleteering.\r\nEvery one who could write a pamphlet, or could publish one, did so.\r\nThe censorship had prohibited so many people and so many organisations\r\nfrom expressing their views publicly that they chose this method of\r\ncirculating their ideas privately.  The pamphlets could be printed\r\nsecretly and distributed through the mails so as to avoid both the\r\ncensors and the Government.  So every one in Germany began to receive\r\ndocuments and pamphlets about all the ails and complaints within\r\nGermany.  About the only people who did not do this were the\r\nSocialists.  The \"Alt-Deutsch Verband,\" which was an organisation of\r\nthe great industrial leaders of Germany, had been bitterly attacked by\r\nthe Berlin _Tageblatt_ but when the directors wanted to publish their\r\nreply the censors prohibited it.  So, the Alt-Deutsch Verband issued a\r\npamphlet and sent it broadcast throughout Germany.  In the meantime the\r\nChancellor and the Government realised that unless something was done\r\nto combat these secret forces which were undermining the Government's\r\ninfluence, that there would be an eruption in Germany which might\r\nproduce serious results.\r\n\r\nThroughout this time the Socialist party was having troubles of its\r\nown.  Liebknecht was in prison but there was a little group of radicals\r\nwho had not forgotten it.  They wanted the Socialist party as a whole\r\nto do something to free Liebknecht.  The party had been split before\r\nthe advance of last summer so efforts were made to unite the two\r\nfactions.  At a well attended conference in the Reichstag building they\r\nagreed to forget old differences and join forces in support of the\r\nGovernment until winter, when it was hoped peace could be made.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist party at various times during the war has had a difficult\r\ntime in agreeing on government measures.  While the Socialists voted\r\nunanimously for war credits at the beginning, a year afterward many of\r\nthem had changed their minds and had begun to wonder whether, after\r\nall, they had not made a mistake.  This was the issue which brought\r\nabout the first split in the Socialists' ranks.  When it came time in\r\n1916 to vote further credits to the Government the Socialists held a\r\ncaucus.  After three days of bitter wrangling the ranks split.  One\r\ngroup headed by Scheidemann decided to support the Government and\r\nanother group with Herr Wolfgang Heine as the leader, decided to vote\r\nagainst the war loans.\r\n\r\nScheidemann, who is the most capable and most powerful Socialist in\r\nGermany, carried with him the majority of the delegates and was\r\nsupported by the greater part of public opinion.  Heine, however, had\r\nthe support of men like Dr. Haase and Eduard Bernstein who had\r\nconsiderable influence with the public but who were not organisers or\r\nmen capable of aggressive action, like Scheidemann.  As far as\r\naffecting the Government's plans were concerned the Socialist split did\r\nnot amount to much.  In Germany there is such a widespread fear of the\r\nGovernment and the police that even the most radical Socialists\r\nhesitate to oppose the Government.  In war time Germany is under\r\ncomplete control of the military authorities and even the Reichstag,\r\nwhich is supposed to be a legislative body, is in reality during war\r\ntimes only a closed corporation which does the bidding of the\r\nGovernment.  The attitude of the Reichstag on any question is not\r\ndetermined at the party caucuses nor during sessions.  Important\r\ndecisions are always arrived at at Great Headquarters between the\r\nChancellor and the military leaders.  Then the Chancellor returns to\r\nBerlin, summons the party leaders to his palace, explains what the\r\nGovernment desires and, without asking the leaders for their support,\r\ntells them _that_ is what _von Hindenburg_ expects.  They know there is\r\nno choice left to them.  Scheidemann always attends these conferences\r\nas the Socialist representative because the Chancellor has never\r\nrecognised the so-called Socialist Labour Party which is made up of\r\nSocialist radicals who want peace and who have reached the point when\r\nthey can no longer support the Government.\r\n\r\nOne night at the invitation of an editor of one of Berlin's leading\r\nnewspapers, who is a Socialist radical, I attended a secret session of\r\nthe Socialist Labour Party.  At this meeting there were present three\r\nmembers of the Reichstag, the President of one of Germany's leading\r\nbusiness organisations, two newspaper editors, one labour agitator who\r\nhad been travelling to industrial centres to mobilise the forces which\r\nwere opposed to a continuation of the war, and a rather well known\r\nSocialist writer who had been inspiring some anti-Government pamphlets\r\nwhich were printed in Switzerland and sent by mail to Germany.  One of\r\nthe business men present had had an audience of the Kaiser and he\r\nreported what the monarch told him about the possibilities of peace.\r\nThe report was rather encouraging to the Socialists because the Kaiser\r\nsaid he would make peace as soon as there was an opportunity.  But\r\nthese Socialists did not have much faith in the Kaiser's promises and\r\njokingly asked the business man if the Kaiser did not decorate him as a\r\nresult of the audience!\r\n\r\nThe real object of this meeting was to discuss means of acquainting the\r\nGerman people with the American organisation entitled the League to\r\nEnforce Peace.  An American business man, who was a charter member of\r\nthe American organisation, was there to explain the purposes of the\r\nLeague.  The meeting decided upon the publication in as many German\r\nnewspapers as possible of explanatory articles.  The newspaper editor\r\npresent promised to prepare them and urged their publication in various\r\njournals.  The first article appeared in _Die Welt Am Montag_, one of\r\nthe weekly newspapers of Berlin.  It was copied by a number of\r\nprogressive newspapers throughout the Empire but when the attention of\r\nthe military and naval authorities was called to this propaganda an\r\norder was issued prohibiting any newspaper from making any reference to\r\nthe League to Enforce Peace.  The anti-American editorial writers were\r\ninspired to write brief notices to the effect that the League was in\r\nreality to be a League against Germany supported by England and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThroughout the summer and fall there appeared in various newspapers,\r\nincluding the influential _Frankfurter Zeitung_, inspired articles\r\nabout the possibilities of annexing the industrial centres and\r\nimportant harbours of Belgium.  In Munich and Leipsic a book by Dr.\r\nSchumacher, of Bonn University, was published, entitled, \"Antwerp, Its\r\nWorld Position and Importance for Germany's Economic Life.\"  Another\r\nwriter named Ulrich Bauschey wrote a number of newspaper and magazine\r\narticles for the purpose of showing that Germany would need Antwerp\r\nafter this war in order to successfully compete with Holland, England\r\nand France in world commerce.  He figured that the difference between\r\nthe cost of transportation from the Rhine Valley industrial cities to\r\nAntwerp and the cost of transportation from the Rhine Valley to Hamburg\r\nand Bremen would be great enough as to enable German products to be\r\nsold in America for less money than products of Germany's enemies.\r\n\r\nThese articles brought up the old question of the \"freedom of the\r\nseas.\"  Obviously, if the Allies were to control the seas after the\r\nwar, as they had during the war, Germany could make no plans for the\r\nre-establishment of her world commerce unless there were some\r\nassurances that her merchant fleet would be as free on the high seas as\r\nthat of any other nation.  During the war Germany had talked a great\r\ndeal about the freedom of the seas.  When the _Lusitania_ was torpedoed\r\nvon Jagow said in an interview that Germany was fighting for the free\r\nseas and that by attacking England's control, Germany was acting in the\r\ninterests of the whole world.  But Germany was really not sincere in\r\nwhat she said about having the seas free.  What Germany really desired\r\nwas not freedom of the seas in peace time because the seas had been\r\nfree before the war.  What Germany wanted was free seas in war\r\ntime,--freedom for her own merchant ships to go from Germany to any\r\npart of the world and return with everything except absolute\r\ncontraband.  Germany's object was to keep from building a navy great\r\nenough to protect her merchant fleet in order that she might devote all\r\nher energies to army organisation.  But the freedom of the seas was a\r\npopular phrase.  Furthermore it explained to the German people why\r\ntheir submarine warfare was not inhuman because it was really fighting\r\nfor the freedom of all nations on the high seas!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This is the photograph of von Hindenburg which very\r\nGerman has in his home.]\r\n\r\nWhile these public discussions were going on, the fight on the\r\nChancellor began to grow.  It was evident that when the Reichstag met\r\nagain in September that there would be bitter and perhaps a decisive\r\nfight on von Bethmann-Hollweg.  The division in Germany became so\r\npronounced that people forgot for a time the old party lines and the\r\nnewspapers and party leaders spoke of the \"Bethmann parties\" and the\r\n\"von Tirpitz party.\"  Whether the submarine should be used ruthlessly\r\nagainst all shipping was the issue which divided public sentiment.  The\r\nsame democratic forces which had been supporting the Chancellor in\r\nother fights again lined up with the Foreign Office.  The reactionaries\r\nsupported Major Bassermann, who really led the fight against the\r\nChancellor.  During this period the Chancellor and the Foreign Office\r\nsaw that the longer the war lasted the stronger the von Tirpitz party\r\nwould become because the people were growing more desperate and were\r\nenthused by the propaganda cry of the Navy, \"Down with England.\"  The\r\nChancellor and the Foreign Office tried once more to get the world to\r\ntalk about peace.  After the presidential nominations in America the\r\npress began to discuss the possibilities of American peace\r\nintervention.  Every one believed that the campaign and elections in\r\nAmerica would have an important effect on the prospects of peace.\r\nTheodore Wolff, editor of the Berlin _Tageblatt_, who was the\r\nChancellor's chief supporter in newspaper circles, began the\r\npublication of a series of articles to explain that in the event of the\r\nelection of Charles E. Hughes, Germany would be able to count upon more\r\nassistance from America and upon peace.  At the time the Allies were\r\npounding away at the Somme and every effort was being made to bring\r\nabout some kind of peace discussions when these battles were over.\r\n\r\nOn September 20th a convention of Socialists was held in Berlin for the\r\npurpose of uniting the Socialist party in support of the Chancellor.\r\nThe whole country was watching the Socialist discussions because every\r\none felt that the Socialist party represented the real opinion of the\r\npeople.  After several days of discussion all factional differences\r\nwere patched up and the Socialists were ready to present a solid front\r\nwhen the fight came in the Reichstag on September 28th.  On the 27th,\r\nBerlin hotels began to buzz with excitement over the possibilities of\r\noverthrowing the Chancellor.  The fight was led by the National\r\nLiberals and Centre Party groups.  It was proposed by Dr. Coerting, an\r\nindustrial leader from Hannover, to move a vote of lack of confidence\r\nin the Chancellor.  Coerting was supported by the big ammunition\r\ninterests and by the von Tirpitz crowd.  Before the Reichstag convened\r\nthe Chancellor went to Great Headquarters for a final conference with\r\nthe Kaiser and Field Marshal von Hindenburg.  Before he left it looked\r\nas if the Chancellor would be overthrown.  But when he returned he\r\nsummoned the Reichstag leaders who were supporting him and several\r\neditors of Liberal newspapers.  The Chancellor told them that von\r\nHindenburg would support him.  The next day editorials appeared in a\r\nnumber of newspapers, saying that von Hindenburg and the Chancellor\r\nwere united in their ideas.  This was the most successful strategic\r\nmove the Chancellor had made, for the public had such great confidence\r\nin von Hindenburg that when it was learned that he was opposed to von\r\nTirpitz the backbone of opposition to the Chancellor was broken.  On\r\nthe 28th as von Bethmann-Hollweg appeared in the Reichstag, instead of\r\nfacing a hostile and belligerent assembly, he faced members who were\r\nready to support him in anything he did.  The Chancellor, however,\r\nrealised that he could take some of the thunder out of the opposition\r\nby making a strong statement against England.  \"Down with England,\" the\r\npopular cry, was the keynote of the Chancellor's remarks.  In this one\r\nspeech he succeeded in uniting for a time at least public sentiment and\r\nthe political parties in support of the Government.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward I saw Major Bassermann at his office in the\r\nReichstag and asked him whether the campaign for an unlimited submarine\r\nwarfare would be resumed after the action of the Reichstag in\r\nexpressing confidence in the Chancellor.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"That must be decided by the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Marine and\r\nthe General Staff.  England is our chief enemy and we must recognise\r\nthis and defeat her.\"\r\n\r\nWith his hands in his pocket, his face looking down, he paced his\r\noffice and began a bitter denunciation of the neutrality of the United\r\nStates.  I asked him whether he favoured the submarine warfare even if\r\nit brought about a break with the United States.\r\n\r\n\"We wish to live in peace and friendship with America,\" he began, \"but\r\nundoubtedly there is bitter feeling here because American supplies and\r\nammunition enable our enemies to continue the war.  If America should\r\nsucceed in forcing England to obey international law, restore freedom\r\nof the seas and proceed with American energy against England's\r\nbrutalisation of neutrals, it would have a decisive influence on the\r\npolitical situation between the two countries.  If America does not do\r\nthis then we must do it with our submarines.\"\r\n\r\nIn October I was invited by the Foreign Office to go with a group of\r\ncorrespondents to Essen, Cologne and the Rhine Valley Industrial\r\ncentres.  In Essen I met Baron von Bodenhausen and other directors of\r\nKrupps.  In Dusseldorf at the Industrie Klub I dined with the steel\r\nmagnates of Germany and at Homburg-on-the-Rhine I saw August Thyssen,\r\none of the richest men in Germany and the man who owns one-tenth of\r\nGermany's coal and iron fields.  The most impressive thing about this\r\njourney was what these men said about the necessity for unlimited\r\nwarfare.  Every man I met was opposed to the Chancellor.  They hated\r\nhim because he delayed mobilisation at the beginning of the war.  They\r\nstated that they had urged the invasion of Belgium because if Belgium\r\nhad not been invaded immediately France could have seized the Rhine\r\nValley and made it impossible for Germany to manufacture war munitions\r\nand thereby to fight a war.  They said they were in favour of an\r\nunlimited, ruthless submarine warfare against England and all ships\r\ngoing to the British Isles.  Their opinions were best represented in an\r\ninspired editorial appearing in the _Rhieinische Westfälische Zeitung_,\r\nin which it was stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The war must be fought to a finish.  Either Germany or England must\r\nwin and the interests here on the Rhine are ready to fight until\r\nGermany wins.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Do you think Germany wants war with America?\" I asked Thyssen.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" was his emphatic response.  \"First, because we have enemies\r\nenough, and, secondly, because in peace times, our relations with\r\nAmerica are always most friendly.  We want them to continue so after\r\nthe war.\"\r\n\r\nThyssen's remarks could be taken on their face value were it not for\r\nthe fact that the week before we arrived in these cities General\r\nLudendorf, von Hindenhurg's chief assistant and co-worker, was there to\r\nget the industrial leaders to manufacture more ammunition.  Von\r\nFalkenhayn had made many enemies in this section because he cut down\r\nthe ammunition manufacturing until these men were losing money.  So the\r\nfirst thing von Hindenburg did was to double all orders for ammunition\r\nand war supplies and to send Ludendorf to the industrial centres to\r\nmake peace with the men who were opposed to the Government.\r\n\r\nThus from May to November German politics went through a period of\r\ntransformation.  No one knew exactly what would happen,--there were so\r\nmany conflicting opinions.  Political parties, industrial leaders and\r\nthe press were so divided it was evident that something would have to\r\nbe done or the German political organisation would strike a rock and go\r\nto pieces.  The Socialists were still demanding election reforms during\r\nthe war.  The National Liberals were intriguing for a Reichstag\r\nCommittee to have equal authority with the Foreign Office in dealing\r\nwith all matters of international affairs.  The landowners, who were\r\nlosing money because the Government was confiscating so much food, were\r\nnot only criticising von Bethmann-Hollweg but holding back as much food\r\nas they could for higher prices.  The industrial leaders, who had been\r\nlosing money because von Falkenhayn had decreased ammunition orders,\r\nwere only partially satisfied by von Hindenburg's step because they\r\nrealised that unless the war was intensified the Government would not\r\nneed such supplies indefinitely.  They saw, too, that the attitude of\r\nPresident Wilson had so injured what little standing they still had in\r\nthe neutral world that unless Germany won the war in a decisive way,\r\ntheir world connections would disappear forever and they would be\r\nforced to begin all over after the war.  Faced by this predicament,\r\nthey demanded a ruthless submarine warfare against all shipping in\r\norder that not only England but every other power should suffer,\r\nbecause the more ships and property of the enemies destroyed the more\r\ntheir chances with the rest of the world would be equalised when the\r\nwar was over.  Food conditions were becoming worse, the people were\r\nbecoming more dissatisfied; losses on the battlefields were touching\r\nnearly every family.  Depression was growing.  Every one felt that\r\nsomething had to be done and done immediately.\r\n\r\nThe press referred to these months of turmoil as a period of \"new\r\norientation.\"  It was a time of readjustment which did not reach a\r\nclimax until December twelfth when the Chancellor proposed peace\r\nconferences to the Allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n     WHAT YOU CANNOT EAT OR DRINK\r\n\r\n     FOODSTUFFS WHICH ARE COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED IN GERMANY\r\n\r\n  1.

But a year later the situation had changed so that\r\nthe number of food cards--Germany's economic barometer--had increased\r\neight times.  March and April of 1916 were the worst months in the year\r\nand a great many people had difficulty in getting enough food to eat.\r\nThere was growing dissatisfaction with the way the Government was\r\nhandling the food problem but the people's hope was centred upon the\r\nnext harvest.  In April and May the submarine issue and the American\r\ncrisis turned public attention from food to politics.  From July to\r\nOctober the Somme battles kept the people's minds centred upon military\r\noperations.  While the scarcity of food became greater the Government,\r\nthrough inspired articles in the press, informed the people that the\r\nharvest was so big that there would be no more food difficulties.\r\n\r\nGermany began to pay serious attention to the food situation, when\r\nearly in the year, Adolph von Batocki, the president of East Prussia\r\nand a big land owner, was made food dictator.  At the same time there\r\nwere organised various government food departments.  There was an\r\nImperial Bureau for collecting fats; another to take charge of the meat\r\nsupply; another to control the milk and another in charge of the\r\nvegetables and fruit.  Germany became practically a socialistic state\r\nand in this way the Government kept abreast of the growth of Socialism\r\namong the people.  The most important step the Government took was to\r\norganise the Zentral Einkaufgesellschaft, popularly known as the \"Z. E.\r\nG.\"  The first object of this organisation was to purchase food in\r\nneutral countries.  Previously German merchants had been going to\r\nHolland, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries to buy supplies.\r\nThese merchants had been bidding against each other in order to get\r\nproducts for their concerns.  In this way food was made much more\r\nexpensive than it would have been had one purchaser gone outside of\r\nGermany.  So the Government prohibited all firms from buying food\r\nabroad.  Travelling agents of the \"Z. E. G.\" went to these countries\r\nand bought all of the supplies available at a fixed price.  Then these\r\nresold to German dealers at cost.\r\n\r\nSuch drastic measures were necessitated by the public demand that every\r\none share alike.  The Government found it extremely difficult to\r\ncontrol the food.  Farmers and rich landowners insisted upon\r\nslaughtering their own pigs for their own use.  They insisted upon\r\neating the eggs their chickens laid, or, upon sending them through the\r\nmail to friends at high prices, thereby evading the egg card\r\nregulations.  But the Government stepped in and farmers were prohibited\r\nfrom killing their own cattle and from sending foods to friends and\r\nspecial customers.  Farmers had to sell everything to the \"Z. E. G.\"\r\nThat was another result of State Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe optimistic statements of Herr von Batocki about the food outlook\r\nled the people to believe that by fall conditions would be greatly\r\nimproved but instead of becoming more plentiful food supplies became\r\nmore and more organised until all food was upon an absolute ration\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n\"Although the crops were good this year, there will be so much\r\norganisation that food will spoil,\" said practically every German.\r\nBatocki's method of confiscating food did cause a great deal to spoil\r\nand the public blamed him any time anything disappeared from the\r\nmarket.  One day a carload of plums was shipped from Werder, the big\r\nfruit district near Berlin, to the capital.  The \"Z. E. G.\" confiscated\r\nit but did not sell the goods immediately to the merchants and the\r\nplums spoiled.  Before this was found out, a crowd of women surrounded\r\nthe train one day, which was standing on a side track, broke into a car\r\nand found most of the plums in such rotten condition they could not be\r\nused.  So they painted on the sides of the car: \"This is the kind of\r\nplum jam the 'Z. E. G.' makes.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a growing scarcity of all other supplies, too.  The armies\r\ndemanded every possible labouring man and woman so even the canning\r\nfactories had to close and food which formerly was canned had to be\r\neaten while fresh or it spoiled.  Even the private German family, which\r\nwas accustomed to canning food, had to forego this practice because of\r\na lack of tin cans, jars and rubber bands.\r\n\r\nThe food depots are by far the most successful undertaking of the\r\nGovernment.  In Cologne and Berlin alone close to 500,000 poor are\r\nbeing fed daily by municipal kitchens.  Last October I went through the\r\nCologne food department with the director.  The city has rented a\r\nnumber of large vacant factory buildings and made them into kitchens.\r\nMunicipal buyers go through the country to buy meat and vegetables.\r\nThis is shipped to Cologne, and in these kitchens it is prepared by\r\nwomen workers, under the direction of volunteers.\r\n\r\nA stew is cooked each day and sold for 42 pfennigs (about eight cents)\r\na quart.  The people must give up their potato, fat and meat cards to\r\nobtain it.  In Berlin and all other large cities, the same system is\r\nused.  In one kitchen in Berlin, at the main market hall, 80,000 quarts\r\na day are prepared.\r\n\r\nIn Cologne this food is distributed through the city streets by\r\nmunicipal wagons, and the people get it almost boiling hot, ready to\r\neat.  Were it not for these food depots there would be many thousands\r\nof people who would starve because they could not buy and cook such\r\nnourishing food for the price the city asks.  These food kitchens have\r\nbeen in use now almost a year, and, while the poor are obtaining food\r\nhere, they are becoming very tired of the supply, because they must eat\r\nstews every day.  They can have nothing fried or roasted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these kitchens the Government has opened throughout\r\nGermany \"mittlestand kueche,\" a restaurant for the middle classes.\r\nHere government employees, with small wages, the poor who do not keep\r\nhouse and others with little means can obtain a meal for 10 cents,\r\nconsisting of a stew and a dessert.  But it is very difficult for\r\npeople to live on this food.  Most every one who is compelled by\r\ncircumstances to eat here is losing weight and feels under-nourished\r\nall the time.\r\n\r\nA few months ago, after one of my secretaries had been called to the\r\narmy; I employed another.  He had been earning only $7 a week and had\r\nto support his wife.  On this money they ate at the middle class cafes.\r\nIn six months he had lost twenty pounds.\r\n\r\nBecause the food is so scarce and because it lacks real nourishment\r\npeople eat all the time.  It used to be said before the war that the\r\nGermans were the biggest eaters in Europe--that they ate seven meals a\r\nday.  The blockade has not made them less eaters, for they eat every\r\nfew hours all day long now, but because the food lacks fats and sugars,\r\nthey need more food.\r\n\r\nRestaurants are doing big business because after one has eaten a \"meal\"\r\nat any leading Berlin hotel at 1 o'clock in the afternoon one is hungry\r\nby 3 o'clock and ready for another \"meal.\"\r\n\r\nLast winter the Socialists of Munich, who saw that the rich were having\r\nplenty of food and that the poor were existing as best they could in\r\nfood kitchens, wrote Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg and demanded the\r\nimmediate confiscation of all food in Germany, even that in private\r\nresidences.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists' demand was, as are most others, thrown into the waste\r\nbasket because men like the Chancellor, President Batocki, of the Food\r\nDepartment, wealthy bankers, statesmen and army generals have country\r\nestates where they have stored food for an indefinite period.  They\r\nknow that no matter how hard the blockade pinches the people it won't\r\nstarve them.\r\n\r\nWhen the Chancellor invites people to his palace he has real coffee,\r\nwhite bread, plenty of potatoes, cake and meat.  Being a government\r\nofficial he can get what he wants from the food department.  So can\r\nother officials.  Therefore, they were willing to disregard the demand\r\nof the Bavarian Socialists.\r\n\r\nBut the Socialists, although they don't get publicity when they start\r\nsomething, don't give up until they accomplish what they set out to do.\r\nFirst, they enlisted the Berlin Socialists, and the report went around\r\nto people that the rich were going to Copenhagen and bringing back food\r\nwhile the poor starved.  So the Government had to prohibit all food\r\nfrom coming into Germany by way of Denmark unless it was imported by\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nThat was the first success of the Bavarian Socialists.  Now they have\r\nhad another.  Batocki is reported as having announced that all food\r\nsupplies will be confiscated.  The Socialists are responsible.\r\n\r\nExcepting the very wealthy and those who have stored quantities of food\r\nfor the \"siege,\" every German is undernourished.  A great many people\r\nare starving.  The head physician of the Kaiserin Augusta Victoria\r\nHospital, in Berlin, stated that 80,000 children died in Berlin in 1916\r\nfrom lack of food.  The _Lokal-Anzeiger_ printed the item and the\r\nForeign Office censor prohibited me from sending it to New York.\r\n\r\nBut starvation under the blockade is a slow process, and it has not yet\r\nreached the army.  When I was on the Somme battlefields last November\r\nand in Rumania in December the soldiers were not only well fed, but\r\nthey had luxuries which their families at home did not have.  Two years\r\nago there was so much food at home the women sent food boxes to the\r\nfront.  To-day the soldiers not only send but carry quantities of food\r\nfrom the front to their homes.  The army has more than the people.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to say whether Germany, as a nation, can be\r\nstarved into submission.  Everything depends upon the next harvest, the\r\nlength of the war and future military operations.  The German\r\nGovernment, I think, can make the people hold out until the coming\r\nharvest, unless there is a big military defeat.  In their present\r\nundernourished condition the public could not face a defeat.  If the\r\nwar ends this year Germany will not be so starved that she will accept\r\nany peace terms.  But if the war continues another year or two Germany\r\nwill have to give up.\r\n\r\nI entered Germany at the beginning of the Allied blockade when one\r\ncould purchase any kind and any quantity of food in Germany.  Two years\r\nlater, when I left, there were at least eighteen foodstuffs which could\r\nnot be purchased anywhere, and there were twelve kinds of food which\r\ncould be obtained only by government cards.  That is what the Allied\r\nblockade did to the food supplies.  It made Germany look like a grocery\r\nstore after a closing out sale.\r\n\r\nSuppose in the United States you wanted the simplest breakfast--coffee\r\nand bread and butter.  Suppose you wanted a light luncheon of eggs or a\r\nsandwich, tea and fruit.  Suppose for dinner you wanted a plain menu of\r\nsoup, meat, vegetables and dessert.  At any grocery or lunch counter\r\nyou could get not only these plain foods, but anything else you wanted.\r\n\r\nNot so in Germany!  For breakfast you cannot have pure coffee, and you\r\ncan have only a very small quantity of butter with your butter card.\r\nHotels serve a coffee substitute, but most people prefer nothing.  For\r\nluncheon you may have an egg, but only one day during two weeks.\r\nHotels still serve a weak, highly colored tea and apples or oranges.\r\nFor dinner you may have soup without any meat or fat in it.  Soups are\r\njust a mixture of water and vegetables.  Two days a week you can get a\r\nsmall piece of meat with a meat card.  Other days you can eat boiled\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nPeople who keep house, of course, have more food, because as a rule\r\nthey have been storing supplies.  Take the Christian Scientists as an\r\ninstance.  Members of this Church have organised a semi-official club.\r\nMembers buy all the extra food possible.  Then they divide and store\r\naway what they want for the \"siege\"--the time when food will be scarcer\r\nthan it is to-day.\r\n\r\nTwo women practitioners in Berlin, who live together, bought thirty\r\npounds of butter from an American who had brought it in from\r\nCopenhagen.  They canned it and planned to make this butter last one\r\nyear.  Until a few weeks ago people with money could go to Switzerland,\r\nHolland and Denmark and bring back food with them, either with or\r\nwithout permission.  Some wealthy citizens who import machinery and\r\nother things from outside neutral countries have their agents smuggle\r\nfood at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhile the Dutch, Danish and Swiss governments try to stop smuggling;\r\nthere is always some going through.  The rich have the money to bribe\r\nborder officers and inspectors.  When I was in Düsseldorf, last\r\nOctober, I met the owner of a number of canal boats, who shipped coal\r\nand iron products from the Rhine Valley to Denmark.  He told me his\r\ncanal barges brought back food from Copenhagen every trip and that the\r\nborder authorities were not very careful in making an investigation of\r\nhis boats.\r\n\r\nIn Düsseldorf, too, as well as in Cologne, business men spoke about the\r\nfood they got from Belgium.  They did not get great quantities, of\r\ncourse, but the leakage was enough to enable them to live better than\r\nthose who had to depend upon the food in Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen the food supplies began to decrease the Government instituted the\r\ncard system of distribution.  Bread cards had been very successful, so\r\nthe authorities figured that meat, butter, potato and other cards would\r\nbe equally so.  But their calculations were wrong.\r\n\r\nWhen potato cards were issued each person was given nine pounds a week.\r\nBut the potato harvest was a big failure.  The supply was so much less\r\nthan the estimates that seed potatoes had to be used to keep the people\r\nsatisfied.  Even then the supply was short; and the quantity to be sold\r\non potato cards was cut to three pounds a week.  Then transportation\r\ndifficulties arose, and potatoes spoiled before they reached Berlin,\r\nMunich, Hamburg, Dresden, Leipsic and other large cities.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happened when the Government confiscated the fruit crop\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\nOne day I was asked on the telephone whether I wanted to buy an\r\n11-pound ham.  I asked to have it sent to my office immediately.  When\r\nit came the price was $2.50 a pound.  I sent the meat back and told the\r\nman I would not pay such a price.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" he replied.  \"Dr. Stein and a dozen other people\r\nwill pay me that price.  I sent it to you because I wanted to help you\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Ludwig Stein, one of the editors of the _Vossiche Zeitung_, paid\r\nthe price and ordered all he could get for the same money.\r\n\r\nWhen I left Berlin the Government had issued an order prohibiting the\r\nsale of all canned vegetables and fruit.  It was explained that this\r\nfood would be sold when the present supplies of other foods were\r\nexhausted.  There were in Berlin many thousand cans, but no one can say\r\nhow long such food will last.\r\n\r\nWhen Americans ask, \"How long can Germany hold out?\" I reply, \"As long\r\nas the German Government can satisfy the vanity and stimulate the\r\nnerves of the people, and as long as the people permit the Government\r\nto do the nation's thinking.\"\r\n\r\nHow long a time that will be no one can say.  It was formerly believed\r\nthat whenever a nation reached the limit which Germany has reached it\r\nwould crumple up.  But Germany fails to crumple.  Instead of breaking\r\nup, she fights harder and more desperately.  Why can she do this?  The\r\nanswer is simple: Because the German people believe in their Government\r\nand the Government knows that as long as it can convince the people\r\nthat it is winning the war the people will fight.\r\n\r\nGermany is to-day in the position of a man on the verge of a nervous\r\nbreakdown; in the position of a man who is under-nourished, who is\r\ndepressed, who is weighed down by colossal burdens, who is brooding\r\nover the loss of friends and relatives, but of a man who feels that his\r\nfuture health and happiness depend upon his ability to hold out until\r\nthe crisis passes.\r\n\r\nIf a physician were called in to prescribe for such a patient his first\r\nact would in all probability be to stimulate this man's hope, to make\r\nhim believe that if he would only \"hold out\" he would pass the crisis\r\nsuccessfully.  But no physician could say that his patient could stand\r\nit for one week, a month or a year more.  The doctor would have to\r\ngamble upon that man's nerves.  He would have to stimulate him daily,\r\nperhaps hourly.\r\n\r\nSo it is with the German nation.  The country is on the verge of a\r\nnervous breakdown.  Men and women, business men and generals, long ago\r\nlost their patience.  They are under-nourished.  They are depressed,\r\ndistressed, suffering and anxious for peace.  It is as true of the\r\nHamburg-American Line directors as it is true of the officers at the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThere have been more cases of nervous breakdowns among the people\r\nduring the last year than at any time in Germany's history.  There have\r\nbeen so many suicides that the newspapers are forbidden to publish\r\nthem.  There have been so many losses on the battlefields that every\r\nfamily has been affected not once, but two, three and four times.\r\nDance halls have been closed.  Cafes and hotels must stop serving meals\r\nby 11 o'clock.  Theatres are presenting the most sullen plays.  Rumours\r\nspread like prairie fires.  One day Hindenburg is dead.  Two days later\r\nhe is alive again.\r\n\r\nBut the Kaiser has studied this war psychology.  He and his ministers\r\nknow that one thing keeps the German people fighting--their hope of\r\nultimate victory; their belief that they have won already.  The Kaiser\r\nknows, too, that if the public mind is stimulated from day to day by\r\nnew victories, by reports of many prisoners, of new territory gained,\r\nof enemy ships torpedoed, or by promises of reforms after the war, the\r\npublic will continue fighting.\r\n\r\nSo the Kaiser gambles from day to day with his people's nerves.  For\r\ntwo years he has done this, and for two years he has been supported by\r\na 12,000,000-man-power army and a larger army of workers and women at\r\nhome.  The Kaiser believes he can gamble for a long time yet with his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nJust as it is impossible for a physician to say how long his patient\r\ncan be stimulated without breaking down, so is it impossible for an\r\nobserver in Germany to say how long it will be before the break-up\r\ncomes in Germany.\r\n\r\nMany times during the war Germany has been on the verge of a collapse.\r\nPresident Wilson's ultimatum after the sinking of the Sussex in the\r\nEnglish Channel brought about one crisis.  Von Falkenhayn's defeat at\r\nVerdun caused another.  The Somme battle brought on a third.  General\r\nBrusiloff's offensive against the Austrians upset conditions throughout\r\nthe Central Powers.  Rumania's declaration of war made another crisis.\r\nBut Germany passed all of these successfully.\r\n\r\nThe ability of the German Government to convince the people that Wilson\r\nwas unneutral and wanted war caused them to accept Germany's note in\r\nthe _Sussex_ case.  The defeat at Verdun was explained as a tactical\r\nsuccess.  The Somme battles, with their terrible losses, failed to\r\nbring a break-up because the Allies stopped attacking at the critical\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nVon Hindenburg as chief of the General Staff of Central Europe remedied\r\nthe mistakes of the Austrians during Brusiloff's attacks by\r\nreorganising the Dual Monarchy's army.  The crisis which Rumania's\r\nentrance on the Allies' side brought in Germany and Hungary was\r\nforgotten after von Mackensen took Bucharest.\r\n\r\nIn each of these instances it will be noticed that the crisis was\r\nsuccessfully passed by \"stimulation.\"  The German mind was made to\r\nbelieve what the Kaiser willed.\r\n\r\nBut what about the future?  Is there a bottomless well of stimulation\r\nin Germany?\r\n\r\nBefore these questions can be answered others must be asked: Why don't\r\nthe German people think for themselves?  Will they ever think for\r\nthemselves?\r\n\r\nAn incident which occurred in Berlin last December illustrates the fact\r\nthat the people are beginning to think.  After the Allies replied to\r\nPresident Wilson's peace note the Kaiser issued an appeal to the German\r\npeople.  One morning it was printed on the first pages of all\r\nnewspapers in boldface type.  When I arrived at my office the janitor\r\nhanded me the morning papers and, pointing to the Kaiser's letter, said:\r\n\r\n\"I see the Kaiser has written US another letter.  You know he never\r\nwrote to US in peace time.\"\r\n\r\nThere are evidences, too, that others are beginning to think.  The\r\nRussian revolution is going to cause many Socialists to discuss the\r\nfuture of Germany.  They have discussed it before, but always behind\r\nclosed doors and with lowered voices.  I attended one night a secret\r\nmeeting of three Socialist leaders of the Reichstag, an editor of a\r\nBerlin paper and several business men.  What they said of the Kaiser\r\nthat night would, if it were published, send every man to the military\r\nfiring squad.  But these men didn't dare speak that way in public at\r\nthat time.  Perhaps the Russian revolt will give them more courage.\r\n\r\nBut the Government is not asleep to these changes.  The Kaiser believes\r\nhe can continue juggling public opinion, but he knows that from now on\r\nit will be more difficult.  But he will not stop.  He will always hold\r\nforth the vision of victory as the reward for German faithfulness.\r\nToday, for instance, in the United States we hear very little about the\r\nGerman submarine warfare.  It is the policy of the Allies not to\r\npublish all losses immediately; first because the enemy must not be\r\ngiven any important information if possible, and, secondly, because,\r\nlosses have a bad effect upon any people.\r\n\r\nBut the German people do not read what we do.  Their newspapers are\r\nprinting daily the ship losses of the Entente.  Submarines are\r\nreturning and making reports.  These reports are published and in a way\r\nto give the people the impression that the submarine war is a success.\r\nWe get the opposite impression here, but we are not in a position\r\nbetter to judge than the Germans, because we don't hear everything.\r\n\r\nThe important question, however, is: What are the German people being\r\ntold about submarine warfare?\r\n\r\nJudging from past events, the Kaiser and his Navy are undoubtedly\r\nmagnifying every sinking for the purpose of stimulating the people into\r\nbelieving that the victory they seek is getting nearer.  The Government\r\nknows that the public favours ruthless torpedoing of all ships bound\r\nfor the enemy, so the Government is safe in concluding that the public\r\ncan be stimulated for some months more by reports of submarine victory.\r\n\r\nMilitary operations in the West are probably not arousing the\r\ndiscussion in Berlin that the plans against Russia are.  The Government\r\nwill see to it that the press points regularly to the possibilities of\r\na separate peace with Russia, or to the possibility of a Hindenburg\r\nadvance against England and France.\r\n\r\nThe people have childlike faith in von Hindenburg.  If Paul von\r\nHindenburg says a retreat is a victory the people will take his\r\njudgment.  But all German leaders know that the time is coming when\r\nthey will have to show the German people a victory or take the\r\nconsequences themselves.\r\n\r\nHence it would not be surprising if, after present military operations\r\nare concluded, either by an offensive against Russia or by an attack on\r\nthe Western line, the Chancellor again made peace proposals.  The\r\nSocialists will force the Chancellor to do it sooner or later.  They\r\nare the real power behind the throne, although they have not enough\r\nspunk to try to oust the Kaiser and tell the people to do their own\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\nA big Allied military victory would, of course, change everything.\r\nDefeat of the German army would mean defeat of von Hindenburg, the\r\nGerman god.  It would put an end to the Kaiser's juggling with his\r\npeople's nerves.  But few people in Germany expect an Entente victory\r\nthis year, and they believe that if the Allies don't win this year they\r\nnever will win.\r\n\r\nGermany is stronger militarily now than she has been and Germany will\r\nbe able for many months to keep many Entente armies occupied.  Before\r\nthe year is passed the Entente may need American troops as badly as\r\nFrance needed English assistance last year.  General von Falkenhayn,\r\nformer chief of the German General Staff, told me about the same thing\r\nlast December, in Rumania.\r\n\r\n\"In war,\" he remarked, \"nothing is certain except that everything is\r\nuncertain, but one thing I know is certain: We will win the war.\"\r\n\r\n_America's entrance, however, will have the decisive effect_.  The\r\nAllies, especially the French, appreciate this.  As a high French\r\nofficial remarked one day when Ambassador Gerard's party was in Paris:\r\n\r\n\"There have been two great moments in the war for France.  The first\r\nwas when England declared war to support us.  The second was the\r\nbreaking of diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany.\"\r\n\r\nThe Germans don't believe this.  As General von Stein, Prussian\r\nMinister of War, said, Germany doesn't fear the United States.  He said\r\nthat, of course, for its effect upon the German people.  The people\r\nmust be made to believe this or they will not be able to hate America\r\nin true German fashion.\r\n\r\nAmerica's participation, however, will upset Hindenburg's war plans.\r\nAmerican intervention can put a stop to the Kaiser's juggling with his\r\npeople's minds by helping the Allies defeat Germany.  Only a big\r\nmilitary defeat will shake the confidence of the Germans in the Kaiser,\r\nHindenburg and their organised might.  The people are beginning to\r\nthink now, but they will do a great deal more thinking if they are\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nSo the answer to the question: \"How long can Germany hold out?\" is\r\nreally answered by saying that Germany can keep on until she is\r\ndecisively defeated militarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE PEACE DRIVE OF DECEMBER 12TH\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDisturbed by internal political dissension and tormented by lack of\r\nfood the German ship of state was sailing troubled waters by November,\r\n1916.  Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg's speech to the Reichstag on\r\nSeptember 28th satisfied no one.  After he had spoken the only thing\r\npeople could recall were his words:\r\n\r\n\"The mighty tasks which await us in all the domains of public, social,\r\neconomic, and political life need all the strength of the people for\r\ntheir fulfilment.  It is a necessity of state which will triumph over\r\nall obstacles to utilise to the utmost those forces which have been\r\nforged in the fire and which clamour for work and creation.  _A free\r\npath for all who are capable--that must be our watch-word_.  If we\r\ncarry it out freely, without prejudice, then our empire goes to a\r\nhealthy future.\"\r\n\r\nThe press interpreted this as meaning that the Chancellor might some\r\nday change his mind about the advisability of a ruthless submarine\r\nwarfare.  Early in November when it appeared that the Allies would not\r\nsucceed in breaking through at the Somme peace forces were again\r\nmobilised.  But when various neutral countries sounded Germany as to\r\npossible terms they discovered that Germany was the self-appointed\r\n\"victor\" and would consider only a peace which recognised Germany as\r\nthe dominant power in Europe.  The confidence of the army in the\r\nvictory was so great that the following article was printed in all the\r\nGerman newspapers:\r\n\r\n\"FAITH IN VICTORY\"\r\n\r\n\"Great Headquarters sends us the following:\r\n\r\n\"Since the beginning of the war, when enemies arose on all sides and\r\nmillions of troops proceeded from all directions--since then more than\r\ntwo long years have brought no more eventful days than those of the\r\npresent.  The unity of the front--our enemies have prepared it for a\r\nlong time past with great care and proclaimed it in loud tones.  Again\r\nand again our unexpected attacks have disturbed this boldly thought out\r\nplan in its development, destroying its force, but now at last\r\nsomething has been accomplished that realises at least part of the\r\nintentions of our enemies and all their strength is being concentrated\r\nfor a simultaneous attack.  The victory which was withheld from them on\r\nall the theatres of war is to be accomplished by an elaborate attack\r\nagainst the defensive walls of our best blood.  The masses of iron\r\nsupplied them by half the world are poured on our gallant troops day\r\nand night with the object of weakening their will and then the mass\r\nattacks of white, yellow, brown and black come on.\r\n\r\n\"The world never experienced anything so monstrous and never have\r\narmies kept up a resistance such as ours.\r\n\r\n\"Our enemies combine the hunger and lie campaign with that of arms,\r\nboth aimed at the head and heart of our home.  The hunger campaign they\r\nwill lose as the troublesome work of just an equal administration and\r\ndistribution of the necessities of life is almost complete.  And a\r\npromising harvest has ripened on our broad fields.  From the first day\r\nof the war, we alone of all the belligerent nations published the army\r\nreports of all of our enemies in full, as our confidence in the\r\nconstancy of those at home is unlimited.  But our enemies have taken\r\nadvantage of this confidence and several times a day they send out war\r\nreports to the world; the English since the beginning of their\r\noffensive send a despatch every two hours.  Each of these publications\r\nis two or three times as long as our daily report and all written in a\r\nstyle which has nothing in common with military brevity and simplicity.\r\nThis is no longer the language of the soldier.  They are mere fantastic\r\nhymns of victory and their parade of names and of conquered villages\r\nand woods and stormed positions, and the number of captured guns, and\r\ntens of thousands of prisoners is a mockery of the truth.\r\n\r\n\"Why is all this done?  Is it only intended to restore the wearying\r\nconfidence of their own armies and people and the tottering faith of\r\ntheir allies?  Is it only intended to blind the eagerly observing eye\r\nof the neutrals?  No, this flood of telegrams is intended to pass\r\nthrough the channels which we ourselves have opened to our enemy, and\r\nto dash against the heart of the German people, undermining and washing\r\naway our steadfastness.\r\n\r\n\"But this despicable game will not succeed.  In the same manner as our\r\ngallant troops in the field defy superior numbers, so the German people\r\nat home will defy the enemies' legions of lies, and remember that the\r\nGerman army reports cannot tell them and the world at large everything\r\nat present, but they never publish a word the truth of which could not\r\nbe minutely sifted.  With proud confidence in the concise, but\r\nabsolutely reliable publications of our own army administration,\r\nGermany will accept these legions of enemy reports at their own value,\r\nas wicked concoctions, attempting to rob them of calm and confidence\r\nwhich the soldier must feel supporting him, if he joyfully risks his\r\nall for the protection of those at home.  Thus our enemies' legions of\r\nlies will break against the wall of our iron faith.  Our warriors defy\r\nthe iron and fire--those at home will also defy the floods of printed\r\npaper and remain unruffled.  The nation and army alike are one in their\r\nwill and faith in victory.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POPE TO PRESIDENT WILSON----\"HOW CAN MY PEACE ANGEL\r\nFLY, MR. PRESIDENT, WHEN YOU ALWAYS PUT SHELLS IN HER POCKETS?\"]\r\n\r\nThis is a typical example of the kind of inspired stories which are\r\nprinted in the German newspapers from time to time to keep up the\r\nconfidence of the people.  This was particularly needed last fall\r\nbecause the people were depressed and melancholy over the losses at the\r\nSomme, and because there was so much criticism and dissatisfaction over\r\nthe Chancellor's attitude towards the submarine warfare and peace.\r\nPeople, too, were suffering agonies in their homes because of the\r\ninferior quality of the food,--the lack of necessary fats and sugar\r\nwhich normal people need for regular nourishment.  The Socialists, who\r\nare in closer touch with the people than any others, increased their\r\ndemands for peace while the National Liberals and the Conservatives,\r\nwho wanted a war of exhaustion against Great Britain, increased their\r\nagitation for the submarine warfare.  The Chancellor was between two\r\ntormentors.  Either he had to attempt to make peace to satisfy the\r\nSocialists and the people, or he had to give in to the demands for\r\nsubmarine warfare as outlined by the National Liberals.  One day\r\nScheidemann went to the Chancellor's palace, after he had visited all\r\nthe big centres of Germany, and said to von Bethmann-Hollweg:\r\n\r\n\"Unless you try to make peace at once the people will revolt and I\r\nshall lead the revolution!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time the industrial leaders of the Rhine Valley and the\r\nArmy and Navy were serving notice on the Government that there could\r\nnot possibly be a German victory unless every weapon in Germany's\r\npossession, which included of course the submarine, was used against\r\nGermany's so-called chief foe--England.\r\n\r\nConfronted by graver troubles within Germany than those from the\r\noutside, the Chancellor went to Great Headquarters to report to the\r\nKaiser and to discuss with von Hindenburg and Ludendorf what should be\r\ndone to unite the German nation.\r\n\r\nWhile the Army had been successful in Roumania and had given the people\r\nrenewed confidence, this was not great enough to carry the people\r\nthrough another hard winter.\r\n\r\nWhile Germany had made promises to the United States in May that no\r\nships would be sunk without warning, the submarines were not adhering\r\nvery closely to the written instructions.  The whole world was aroused\r\nover Germany's repeated disregard of the rules and practice of sea\r\nwarfare.  President Wilson through Ambassador Gerard had sent nine\r\ninquiries to the Foreign Office asking for a report from Germany on the\r\nsinking of various ships not only contrary to international law but\r\ncontrary to Germany's pledges.  In an attempt to ward off many of the\r\nneutral indictments of Germany's sea warfare the official North German\r\nGazette published an explanation containing the following:\r\n\r\n\"The activity of our submarines in the Atlantic Ocean and White Sea has\r\nled the press of the entire world to producing articles as to the\r\nwaging of cruiser warfare by means of submarines.  In both cases it can\r\nbe accurately stated that there is no question of submarine warfare\r\nhere, but of cruiser warfare waged with the support of submarines and\r\nthe details reported hitherto as to the activities of our submarines do\r\nnot admit of any other explanation, in spite of the endeavours of the\r\nBritish press to twist and misrepresent facts.  It is also strictly\r\ncorrect to state that the cruiser warfare which is being waged by means\r\nof submarines is in strict compliance with the German prize regulations\r\nwhich correspond to the International Rules laid down and agreed to in\r\nthe Declaration of London which are not being any more complied with by\r\nEngland.  The accusations and charges brought forward by the British\r\npress and propaganda campaign in connection with ships sunk, can be\r\nshown as futile, as our position is both militarily and from the\r\nstandpoint of international law irreproachable.  We do not sink neutral\r\nships per se, as was recently declared in a proclamation, but the\r\nammunition transports and other contraband wares conducive to the\r\nprolongation of the war, and the rights of defensive measures as\r\nregards this cannot be denied Germany any more than any other country.\r\n\r\n\"Based on this idea, it is clearly obvious that the real loss of the\r\ndestruction of tonnage must be attributed to the supplies sent to\r\nEngland and not to the attitude displayed by Germany which has but\r\nrecourse to purely defensive measures.  If the attitude displayed by\r\nEngland towards neutrals during the course of this war be considered,\r\nthe manner in which it forced compulsory supplies of contraband goods,\r\netc., it can be further recognised that England is responsible for the\r\nlosses in ships; as it is owing to England's attitude that the cause is\r\nto be found. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Although England has hit and crippled legitimate trade to such an\r\nextent, Germany does not wish to act in the same manner, but simply to\r\nstop the shipments of contraband goods calculated to lengthen the war.\r\nEngland evidently is being hard hit by our defensive submarine measures\r\nand is therefore doing all in her power to incite public opinion\r\nagainst the German methods of warfare and confuse opinion in neutral\r\ncountries. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Therefore it must again be recalled that it is:\r\n\r\n\"England, which has crippled neutral trade!\r\n\r\n\"England, which has rendered the freedom of the seas impossible!\r\n\r\n\"England, which has extended the risk of contraband wares in excess of\r\ninternational agreements, and now raises a cry when the same weapons\r\nare used against herself.\r\n\r\n\"England, which has compelled the neutrals to supply these shipments of\r\ncontraband goods calculated to lengthen the war!\r\n\r\n\"As the neutrals quietly acquiesced when there was a question of\r\nabandoning trade with the Central Powers they have remedies in hand for\r\nthe losses of ships which affect them so deeply.  They need only\r\nconsider the fact that the German submarines on the high seas are able\r\nto prevent war services to the enemy in the shipments of contraband\r\ngoods, in a manner that is both militarily and from the standpoint of\r\ninternational law, irreproachable.  If they agree to desist from the\r\nshipment of contraband goods and cease yielding to British pressure\r\nthen they will not have to complain of losses in ships and can retain\r\nthe same for peaceful aims.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was aimed especially at America.  Naval critics did not permit the\r\nopportunity to pass to call to the attention of the Government that\r\nGermany's promises in the _Sussex_ case were only conditional and that,\r\ntherefore, they could be broken at any time.  The Chancellor was in a\r\nmost difficult situation; so was von Hindenburg and the Kaiser.  On\r\nDecember 10th it was announced that the Reichstag would be called to a\r\nspecial session on the twelfth and that the Chancellor would discuss\r\nthe international situation as it was affected by the Roumanian\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of December 12th was the best attended and most impressive\r\none of the Reichstag since August 4th, 1914.  Before the Chancellor\r\nleft his palace he called the representatives of the neutral nations\r\nand handed them Germany's peace proposal.  The same day Germany sent to\r\nevery part of the globe through her wireless stations, Germany's note\r\nto the Allies and the Chancellor's address.\r\n\r\nThe world was astonished and surprised at the German move but no one\r\nknew whether it was to be taken seriously.  Great Britain instructed\r\nher embassies and legations in neutral countries to attempt to find out\r\nwhether the Chancellor really desired to make peace or whether his\r\nstatements were to be interpreted as something to quiet internal\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\nDuring the days of discussion which followed I was in close touch with\r\nthe Foreign Office, the American Embassy and the General Staff.  The\r\nfirst intimation I received that Germany did not expect the peace plan\r\nto succeed was on December 14th at a meeting of the neutral\r\ncorrespondents with Lieut. Col. von Haeften.  When von Hindenburg\r\nbecame Chief of the General Staff he reorganised the press department\r\nin Berlin and sent von Haeften from his personal staff to Berlin to\r\ndirect the press propaganda.  As a student of public opinion abroad von\r\nHaeften was a genius and was extremely frank and honest with the\r\ncorrespondents.\r\n\r\n\"We have proposed peace to our enemies,\" he said to the correspondents,\r\n\"because we feel that we have been victorious and because we believe\r\nthat no matter how long the war continues the Allies will not be able\r\nto defeat us.  It will be interesting to see what effect our proposal\r\nhas upon Russia.  Reports which we have received, coming from\r\nunquestionable sources, state that internal conditions in Russia are\r\ndesperate; that food is scarce; that the transportation system is so\r\ndemoralised and that it will be at least eight months before Russia can\r\ndo anything in a military way.  Russia wants peace and needs peace and\r\nwe shall see now whether she has enough influence upon England to\r\ncompel England to make peace.  We are prepared to go on with the war if\r\nthe Allies refuse our proposals.  If we do we shall not give an inch\r\nwithout making the Allies pay such a dear cost that they will not be\r\nable to continue.\"\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Office was not optimistic over the possibilities of\r\nsuccess; officials realised that the new Lloyd-George Cabinet meant a\r\nstronger war policy by Great Britain, but they thought the peace\r\nproposals might shake the British confidence in the new government and\r\ncause the overthrow of Lloyd-George and the return of Asquith and\r\nViscount Edward Grey.\r\n\r\nFrom all appearances in Berlin it was evident to every neutral diplomat\r\nwith whom I talked that while Germany was proclaiming to the whole\r\nworld her desire for peace she had in mind only the most drastic peace\r\nterms as far as Belgium, certain sections of northern France, Poland\r\nand the Balkans were concerned.  Neutrals observed that Germany was so\r\nexalted over the Roumanian victory and the possibilities of that\r\ncampaign solving the food problem that she was not only ready to defy\r\nthe Allies but the neutral world unless the world was ready to bow to a\r\nGerman victory.  There were some people in Germany who realised that\r\nthe sooner she made peace the better peace terms she could get but the\r\nGovernment was not of this opinion.  The Allies, as was expected,\r\ndefiantly refused the Prussian olive branch which had been extended\r\nlike everything else from Germany with a string tied to it.  For the\r\npurposes of the Kaiser and his Government the Allies' reply was exactly\r\nwhat they wanted.\r\n\r\nThe German Government was in this position: If the Allies accepted\r\nGermany's proposal it would enable the Government to unite all factions\r\nin Germany by making a peace which would satisfy the political parties\r\nas well as the people.  If the Allies refused, the German Government\r\ncalculated that the refusal would be so bitter that it would unite the\r\nGerman people political organisations and enable the Government to\r\ncontinue the war in any way it saw fit.\r\n\r\nNothing which had happened during the year so solidified the German\r\nnation as the Allies' replies to Berlin and to President Wilson.  It\r\nproved to the German people that their Government was waging a\r\ndefensive war because the Allies demanded annexation, compensation and\r\nguarantees, all of which meant a change in the map of Europe from what\r\nit was at the beginning of the war.  The interests which had been\r\ndemanding a submarine warfare saw their opportunity had come.  They\r\nknew that as a result of the Allies' notes the public would sanction an\r\nunrestricted sea warfare against the whole world if that was necessary.\r\n\r\nFrom December 12th until after Christmas, discussions of peace filled\r\nthe German newspapers.  By January 1st all possibilities of peace had\r\ndisappeared.  The Government and the public realised that the war would\r\ngo on and that preparations would have to be made at once for the\r\nbiggest campaign in the history of the world in 1917.\r\n\r\nThroughout the peace discussions one thing was evident to all\r\nAmericans.  Opposition to American intervention in any peace discussion\r\nwas so great that the United States would not be able to take any\r\nleading part without being faced by the animosity of a great section of\r\nGermany.  When it was stated in the press that Joseph O. Grew, the\r\nAmerican Charge d'Affaires, had received the German note and\r\ntransmitted it to his Government, public indignation was so great that\r\nthe Government had to inform all of the German newspapers to explain\r\nthat Germany had not asked the United States to make peace; that\r\nGermany had in fact not asked any neutrals to make peace but had only\r\nhanded these neutrals the German note in order to get it officially\r\nbefore the Allies.  At this time the defiant attitude of the whole\r\nnation was well expressed in an editorial in the _Morgen Post_ saying:\r\n\"If Germany's hand is refused her fist will soon be felt with increased\r\nforce.\"\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Conferences at Pless\r\n\r\nAs early as September, 1916, Ambassador Gerard reported to the State\r\nDepartment that the forces demanding an unrestricted submarine campaign\r\nwere gaining such strength in Germany that the Government would not be\r\nable to maintain its position very long.  Gerard saw that not only the\r\npolitical difficulties but the scarcity of food and the anti-American\r\ncampaign of hate were making such headway that unless peace were made\r\nthere would be nothing to prevent a rupture with the United States.\r\nThe latter part of December when Gerard returned from the United States\r\nafter conferences with President Wilson he began to study the submarine\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nHe saw that only the most desperate resistance on the part of the\r\nChancellor would be able to stem the tide of hate and keep America out\r\nof the war.  On January 7th the American Chamber of Commerce and Trade\r\nin Berlin gave a dinner to Ambassador Gerard and invited the\r\nChancellor, Dr. Helfferich, Dr. Solf, Minister of Foreign Affairs\r\nZimmermann, prominent German bankers and business men, leading editors\r\nand all others who a few months before during the _Sussex_ crisis had\r\ncombined in maintaining friendly relations.  At this banquet Gerard\r\nmade the statement, \"As long as such men as Generals von Hindenburg and\r\nLudendorf, as long as Admirals von Capelle, von Holtzendorff and von\r\nMueller headed the Navy Department, and the Chancellor von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg directed the political affairs there would be no\r\ntrouble with the United States.\"  Gerard was severely criticised abroad\r\nnot only for this statement but for a further remark \"That the\r\nrelations between Germany and the United States had never been better\r\nthan they were to-day.\"  Gerard saw before he had been in Berlin a week\r\nthat Germany was desperate, that conditions were getting worse and that\r\nwith no possibilities of peace Germany would probably renew the von\r\nTirpitz submarine warfare.  He chose desperate means himself at this\r\nbanquet to appeal to the democratic forces in Germany to side with the\r\nChancellor when the question of a ruthless submarine warfare again came\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe German Government, however, had planned its moves months in\r\nadvance.  Just as every great offensive on the battlefields is planned,\r\neven to the finest details, six months before operations begin, so are\r\nthe big moves on the political chessboard of Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are very few men in public life in Germany who have the courage\r\nof their convictions to resign if their policies are overruled.  Von\r\nJagow, who was Secretary of State from the beginning of the war until\r\nDecember, 1916, was one of these \"few.\"  Because von Jagow had to sign\r\nall of the foolish, explanatory and excusing notes which the German\r\nGovernment sent to the United States he was considered abroad as being\r\nweak and incapable.  But when he realised early in November that the\r\nGovernment was determined to renew the submarine warfare unless peace\r\nwas made von Jagow was the only man in German public life who would not\r\nremain an official of the Government and bring about a break with\r\nAmerica.  Zimmermann, however, was a different type of official.\r\nZimmermann, like the Chancellor, is ambitious, bigoted, cold-blooded\r\nand an intriguer of the first calibre.  As long as he was Under\r\nSecretary of State he fought von Jagow and tried repeatedly to oust\r\nhim.  So it was not surprising to Americans when they heard that\r\nZimmermann had succeeded von Jagow.\r\n\r\nThe Gerard banquet, however, came too late.  The die was cast.  But the\r\nworld was not to learn of it for some weeks.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of January, the Kaiser's birthday, the Chancellor, Field\r\nMarshal von Hindenburg, First Quartermaster General Ludendorf, Admirals\r\nvon Capelle, von Holtzendorff and von Mueller and Secretary of State\r\nZimmermann were invited to Great Headquarters to attend the Kaiser's\r\nbirthday dinner.\r\n\r\nEver since von Hindenburg has been Chief of the General Staff the Grand\r\nChief Headquarters of the German Army have been located at Pless, on\r\nthe estate of the Prince of Pless in Silicia.  Previously, the Kaiser\r\nhad had his headquarters here, because it was said and popularly\r\nbelieved that His Majesty was in love with the beautiful Princess of\r\nPless, an Englishwoman by birth.  When von Hindenburg took his\r\nheadquarters to the big castle there, the Princess was exiled and sent\r\nto Parkenkirchen, one of the winter resorts of Bavaria.\r\n\r\nOn previous birthdays of the Emperor and when questions of great moment\r\nwere debated the civilian ministers of the Kaiser were always invited.\r\nBut on the Kaiser's birthday in 1917 only the military leaders were\r\nasked.  Dr. Helfferich, Minister of Colonies Solf, German bankers and\r\nbusiness men as well as German shippers were not consulted.  Germany\r\nwas becoming so desperate that she was willing to defy not only her\r\nenemies and neutral countries but her own financiers and business men.\r\nPreviously, when the submarine issue was debated the Kaiser wanted to\r\nknow what effect such a warfare would have upon German economic and\r\nindustrial life.  But this time he did not care.  He wanted to know the\r\nnaval and military arguments.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1914, when the Chancellor and a very small group of people\r\nwere appealing to His Majesty not to go to war, the Kaiser sided with\r\nGeneral von Moltke and Admiral von Tirpitz.  During the various\r\nsubmarine crises with the United States it appeared that the Kaiser was\r\nchanging--that he was willing and ready to side with the forces of\r\ndemocracy in his own country.  President Wilson and Ambassador Gerard\r\nthought that after the downfall of von Tirpitz and von Falkenhayn the\r\nKaiser would join hands with the reform forces.  But in 1917 when the\r\nfinal decision came the Kaiser cast his lot with his generals against\r\nthe United States and against democracy in Germany.  The Chancellor,\r\nwho had impressed neutral observers as being a real leader of democracy\r\nin Germany, sided with the Kaiser.  Thus by one stroke the democratic\r\nmovement which was under way in Germany received a rude slap.  The man\r\nthe people had looked upon as a friend became an enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Break in Diplomatic Relations\r\n\r\nOn January 30th the German Government announced its blockade of all\r\nAllied coasts and stated that all shipping within these waters, except\r\non special lanes, would be sunk without notice.  Germany challenged the\r\nwhole world to stay off of the ocean.  President Wilson broke\r\ndiplomatic relations immediately and ordered Ambassador Gerard to\r\nreturn home.  Gerard called at the Foreign Office for his passports and\r\nsaid that he desired to leave at once.  Zimmermann informed him that as\r\nsoon as the arrangements for a train could be made he could leave.\r\nZimmermann asked the Ambassador to submit a list of persons he desired\r\nto accompany him.  The Ambassador's list was submitted the next day.\r\nThe Foreign Office sent it to the General Staff, but nearly a week\r\npassed before Gerard was told he could depart and then he was\r\ninstructed that the American consuls could not accompany him, but would\r\nhave to take a special train leaving Munich a week or two later.\r\nAmerican correspondents, who expressed a desire to accompany the\r\nAmbassador, were refused permission.  In the meantime reports arrived\r\nthat the United States had confiscated the German ships and Count\r\nMontgelas, Chief of the American division of the Foreign Office,\r\ninformed Gerard the American correspondents would be held as hostages\r\nif America did this.  Gerard replied that he would not leave until the\r\ncorrespondents and all other Americans were permitted to leave over any\r\nroute they selected.  Practically all of the correspondents had handed\r\nin their passports to the Foreign Office, but not until four hours\r\nbefore the special train departed for Switzerland were the passports\r\nreturned.  When Gerard asked the Foreign Office whether his passports\r\nwere good to the United States the Foreign Office was silent and\r\nneither would the General Staff guarantee the correspondents a safe\r\nconduct through the German submarine zone.  So the only thing the\r\nAmbassador could do was to select a route via Switzerland, France and\r\nSpain, to Cuba and the United States.\r\n\r\nThe train which left Berlin on the night of February 10th carried the\r\nhappiest group of Americans which had been in Europe since the war\r\nbegan.  Practically no one slept.  When the Swiss border was reached\r\nthe Stars and Stripes were hung from the car windows and Americans\r\nbreathed again in a free land.  They felt like prisoners escaping from\r\na penitentiary.  Most of them had been under surveillance or suspicion\r\nfor months.  Nearly every one had had personal experiences which proved\r\nto them that the German people were like the Government--there was no\r\nrespect for public sentiment or moral obligation.  Some of the women\r\nhad upon previous occasions, when they crossed the German frontier,\r\nsubmitted to the most inhuman indignities, but they remained in Germany\r\nbecause their husbands were connected in some way with United States\r\ngovernment or semi-public service work.  They were delighted to escape\r\nthe land where everything is \"verboten\" except hatred and militarism.\r\nThe second day after Gerard's arrival in Berne, American Minister\r\nStoval gave a reception to the Ambassador and invited the Allied\r\ndiplomats.  From that evening on until he sailed from Coruña, Spain,\r\nthe Ambassador felt that he was among friends.  When the Americans\r\naccompanying the Ambassador asked the French authorities in Switzerland\r\nfor permission to enter France the French replied:\r\n\r\n\"Of course you can go through France.  You are exiles and France\r\nwelcomes you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the Americans arrived in Paris they said they were not considered\r\nexiles but guests.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nOn the Kaiser's birthday services were held in all Protestant churches\r\nin Germany.  The clergy was mobilised to encourage the people.  On\r\nJanuary 29th I sent the following despatch, after attending the\r\nimpressive services in the Berlin Cathedral:\r\n\r\n\"Where one year ago Dr. Dryander, the quiet white-haired man who is\r\ncourt preacher, pleaded for an hour for peace in the services marking\r\nthe Kaiser's birthday, this year his sermon was a fiery defence of\r\nGermany's cause and a militant plea for Germany to steel herself for\r\nthe decisive battle every one believes is coming.\r\n\r\n\"In this changed spirit he reflected the sentiment of the German\r\npeople.  His sermon of Saturday has evoked the deepest approval\r\neverywhere.\r\n\r\n\"'We know,' be said, 'that before us is the decisive battle which can\r\nbe fought through only with the greatest sacrifices.  But in all cases\r\nof the past God has helped us, and God will fight for us to-day,\r\nthrough our leaders and our soldiers.  We neither willed nor wanted\r\nthis war--neither the Kaiser nor the people.  We hoped for peace as the\r\nKaiser extended his peace proposal, but with unheard of frivolity and\r\ninsults our enemies slapped the back of the Kaiser's extended hand of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n\"'To such enemies there is only one voice--that of the cannon.  We\r\ncontinue the war with a clear conscience and with trust in God that he\r\nwill bring us victory.  God cannot--he will not--permit the German\r\npeople to go down.'\"\r\n\r\n\"GOD WILL NOT PERMIT THE GERMAN PEOPLE TO GO DOWN\"\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE BERNHARDI OF THE SEAS\r\n\r\nAfter the break in diplomatic relations the slogan of German Militarism\r\nbecame:\r\n\r\n\"Win or lose, we must end the war.\"\r\n\r\nTo many observers it seemed to be insanity coupled with desperation\r\nwhich caused the Kaiser to defy the United States.  There was no doubt\r\nthat Germany was desperate, economically, morally and militarily.\r\nWhile war had led German armies far into enemy territory, it had\r\ndestroyed German influence throughout the world; it had lost Germany's\r\ncolonies and Pacific possessions and it had turned the opinion of the\r\nworld against Germany.  But during the time Germany was trying to\r\nimpress the United States with its sincerity after the _Sussex_\r\nincident the German Navy was building submarines.  It was not building\r\nthese ships to be used in cruiser warfare.  It was building them for\r\nthe future, when submarine war would be launched on a big scale,\r\nperhaps on a bigger scale than it had ever before been conducted.\r\n\r\nAfter the new blockade of the Allied Coast was proclaimed, effective\r\nFeb. 1, 1917, some explanation had to be made to convince the public\r\nthat the submarine war would be successful and would bring the victory\r\nwhich the people had been promised.  The public was never informed\r\ndirectly what the arguments were which convinced the Kaiser that he\r\ncould win the war by using submarines.  But on the 9th of February\r\nthere appeared a small book written by Rear Admiral Hollweg entitled:\r\n\"Unser Recht auf den Ubootkrieg.\"  (Our Right in Submarine Warfare.)\r\nThe manuscript of this book was concluded on the 15th of January, which\r\nshows that the data which it contained and the information and\r\narguments presented were those which the Admiralty placed before the\r\nKaiser on his birthday.  The points which Rear Admiral Hollweg makes in\r\nhis book are:\r\n\r\n1. America's unfriendly neutrality justifies a disregard of the United\r\nStates;\r\n\r\n2. The loss of merchant ships is bringing about a crisis in the\r\nmilitary and economic conditions of the Allies;\r\n\r\n3. England, as the heart of the Entente, must be harmed before peace\r\ncan be made;\r\n\r\n4. Submarines can and must end the war.\r\n\r\nThis book is for the German people a naval text book as General von\r\nBernhardi's book, \"Germany and the Next War,\" was a military text book.\r\nBernhardi's task was to school Germany into the belief in the\r\nunbeatableness of the German army.  Hollweg's book is to teach the\r\nGerman people what their submarines will accomplish and to steal the\r\npeople for the plans her military leaders will propose and carry\r\nthrough on this basis.\r\n\r\nThe keynote of Hollweg's arguments is taken from the words of the\r\nGerman song: \"Der Gott der Eisen wachsen Liesz,\" written by Ernst\r\nMoritz Arndt.

The chief method is by submarines based upon the\r\nfundamentals of international law as dictated by German prize court\r\nregulations.  The German prize regulations were at the beginning of the\r\nwar based upon the fundamental principles of the London Declaration and\r\nrespected the modern endeavours of all civilised states to decrease the\r\nterrors of war.  These regulations of sea laws were written to decrease\r\nthe effects of the unavoidable consequences of sea warfare upon\r\nnon-combatants and neutrals.  As far as there have been changes in the\r\nregulations of the London Declaration during the war, especially as far\r\nas changes in the contraband list have been extended, we Germans have\r\nreligiously followed the principle set by the English of, 'an eye for\r\nan eye and a tooth for a tooth.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn page 19 he states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Americans would under no circumstances, not even to-day, if they were\r\nfaced by a superior sea power in war, refuse to follow this method of\r\nwarfare by the ruthless use of pirate ships.  May our submarine\r\ncampaign be an example for them!  The clever cruiser journey of U-53\r\noff the Atlantic Coast gave them clearly to understand what this method\r\nwas.  Legally they cannot complain of this warfare.  The other neutrals\r\ncannot complain either against such sea warfare because they have ever\r\nsince the Middle Ages recognised the English method of sea warfare.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The New Weather Cape]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the chapter entitled \"The Opponent,\" on page 27 the author says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Before there is a discussion of our legal right to the submarine\r\nwarfare a brief review of the general policies of our opponents during\r\nthe war will be given.  This account shall serve the purpose of\r\nfortifying the living feeling within us of our natural right and of our\r\nduty to use all weapons ruthlessly.\r\n\r\n\"If we did not know before the publication of the Entente Note [The\r\nAllies' peace reply to Germany] what we were up against, now we know.\r\nThe mask fell.  Now we have confirmation of the intentions to rob and\r\nconquer us which, caused the individual entente nations to league\r\ntogether and conduct the war.  The neutrals will now see the situation\r\nmore clearly.  For us it is war, literally to be or not to be a German\r\nnation.  Never did such an appeal [The Entente Note] find such a\r\nfruitful echo in German hearts. . . .\"\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n\"I begin with England, our worst enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn page 31 Admiral Hollweg speaks of the fact that at the beginning of\r\nthe war many Germans, especially those in banking and business circles,\r\nfelt that Germany was so indispensable to England in peace time that\r\nEngland would not conduct a war to \"knock out\" Germany.  But Hollweg\r\nsays the situation has now changed.\r\n\r\nOn pages 122 to 126 he justifies the ruthless submarine warfare in the\r\nfollowing way:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is known that England and her allies declared at the beginning of\r\nthe war that they would adhere to the Declaration of London.  It is\r\njust as well known that England and the Allies changed this declaration\r\nthrough the Orders in Council and other lawless statements of authority\r\nuntil the declaration was unrecognisable and worthless--especially the\r\nspirit and purpose of the agreement were flatly pushed aside until\r\npractically nothing more remains of the marine laws as codified in\r\n1909.  The following collection of flagrant breaches of international\r\nlaw will show who first broke marine laws during the war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ten gross violations of marine law in war time by England.\r\n\r\n\"1. Violation of Article IV of the Maritime Declaration of April 16th,\r\n1855.  Blockading of neutral harbours in violation of international law.\r\n\r\n\"2. Violation of Article II of the same declarations by the\r\nconfiscation of enemy property aboard neutral ships.  See Order in\r\nCouncil, March 11th, 1915.\r\n\r\n\"3. Declaration of the North Sea as a war zone.  British Admiralty\r\nDeclaration, November 3, 1914.\r\n\r\n\"4. England regarded food as contraband since the beginning of the war.\r\nThe starvation war.  England confiscated neutral food en route to\r\nneutral states whenever there was a possibility that it would reach the\r\nenemy.  This violated the recognised fundamental principles of the\r\nfreedom of the seas.\r\n\r\n\"5. Attempt to prevent all communications between Germany and neutral\r\ncountries through the violation of international law and the seizing of\r\nmail.\r\n\r\n\"6. Imprisonment of German reservists aboard neutral ships.\r\n\r\n\"7. a. Violation of Article I of The Hague Convention by the\r\nconfiscation of the German hospital ship _Ophelia_.  b. Murdering of\r\nsubmarine crew upon command of British auxiliary cruiser _Baralong_.\r\nc. Violation of Article XXIX, No. 1, of London Declaration by\r\npreventing American Red Cross from sending supplies to the German Red\r\nCross.\r\n\r\n\"8. a. Destruction of German cruisers _Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse_ in\r\nSpanish territorial waters by English cruiser _Highflyer_.  b.\r\nDestruction of German cruiser _Dresden_ in Chinese waters by British\r\ncruiser _Glasgow_.  c. Attack of British warships on German ship\r\n_Paklas_ in Norwegian waters.\r\n\r\n\"9. England armed her merchant ships for attack.\r\n\r\n\"10. Use of neutral flags and signs by British merchantmen in violation\r\nof Articles II and III of the Paris Declaration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn page 134, after discussing the question of whether the English\r\nblockade has been effective and arguing that England by seizing neutral\r\nships with food on the supposition that the food was going to Germany,\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We may conclude from these facts that we Germans can now consider\r\nourselves freed from the uncomfortable conditions of the London\r\nDeclaration and may conduct the war as our own interests prescribe.  We\r\nhave already partially done this in as much as we followed the English\r\nexample of extending the lists of war contraband.  This has been\r\ninconvenient for the neutrals affected and they have protested against\r\nit.  We may, however, consider that they will henceforth respect our\r\nproposals just as they have in the past accepted English interests.\r\nEngland demanded from them that they assist her because England was\r\nfighting for the future of neutrals and of justice.  We will take this\r\nprinciple also as basis for what we do and even await thereby that we\r\nwill compel England to grant us the kind of peace which can lay new\r\nfoundations for sea warfare and that for the future the military acts\r\nof belligerents against neutrals will not be carried to the extremes\r\nthey have been for centuries because of England's superior sea power.\r\nThis new era of civilised warfare we bring under the term 'freedom of\r\nthe seas.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHollweg's next justification of the unlimited submarine warfare is that\r\nSecretary of State Lansing in a note to Count von Bernstorff at first\r\nsaid merchant ships could not be armed and then changed his mind.\r\n\r\nOn page 160 Hollweg says: \"And now in discussing the question of the\r\nlegal position of the submarine as a warship I cite here the statements\r\nof the German authority on international law, Professor Dr. Niemeyer,\r\nwho said: 'There can be absolutely no question but that the submarine\r\nis permitted.  It is a means of war similar to every other one.  The\r\nfrightfulness of the weapon was never a ground of condemnation.  This\r\nis a war in which everything is permitted, which is not forbidden.'\"\r\n\r\nOn page 175 in the chapter entitled \"The Submarine War and Victory\" the\r\nauthor says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Every great deed carries with it a certain amount of risk.  After the\r\nrefusal of our peace proposal we have only the choice of victory with\r\nthe use of all of our strength and power, or, the submission to the\r\ndestructive conditions of our opponents.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adds that his statements shall prove to the reader that Germany can\r\ncontinue the hard relentless battle with the greatest possibility and\r\nconfidence of a final victory which will break the destructive\r\ntendencies of the Entente and guarantee a peace which Germany needs for\r\nher future existence.\r\n\r\nOn page 193 he declares: \"All food prices in England have increased on\r\nthe average 80% in price, they are for example considerably higher in\r\nEngland than in Germany.  A world wide crop failure in Canada and\r\nArgentine made the importation of food for England more difficult.\r\n\r\n\"England earns in this war as opposed to other wars, nothing.  Part of\r\nher industrial workers are under arms, the others are working in making\r\nwar munitions for her own use, not, however, for the export of valuable\r\nwares.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral Hollweg has a clever theory that the German fleet has played a\r\nprominent role in the war, although most of the time it has been\r\nhugging the coasts of the Fatherland.  He declares that the fleet has\r\nhad a \"distance effect\" upon the Allies' control of the high seas.  On\r\npage 197 he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What I mean in extreme by 'fernwirkung' [distance effect] I will show\r\nhere by an example.  The English and French attack on Constantinople\r\nfailed.  It can at least be doubted whether at that time when the\r\nconnection between Germany and Turkey was not established a strong\r\nEnglish naval unit would have brought the attack success.  The\r\nnecessity of not withdrawing the English battleships from the North Sea\r\nprevented England from using a more powerful unit at Constantinople.\r\nTo this extent the German battle fleet was not without influence in the\r\nvictory for the defender of Constantinople.  That is 'distance effect.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOn page 187 Hollweg declares: \"England not only does not make money\r\nto-day by war but she is losing.  The universal military service which\r\nshe was forced to introduce in order to hold the other Allies by the\r\ntongue draws from her industry and thereby her commerce, 3,500,000\r\nworkmen.  Coal exportation has decreased.  During the eleven months\r\nfrom January to November, 1916, 4,500,000 tons less coal was exported\r\nthan in 1915.  In order to produce enough coal for England herself the\r\nnation was compelled by the munitions obligation law to put miners to\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nOn page 223 the author declares:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is, therefore, the great and important role which the submarines\r\nin this war are playing.  They are serving also to pave the way in the\r\nfuture for the 'freedom of the seas.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adds that the submarines will cut the thread which holds the English\r\nDamocles' sword over weak sea powers and that for eternity the\r\n\"gruesome hands\" of English despotism will be driven from the seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART SHOWING TONNAGE OF SHIPS SUNK BY GERMAN SUBMARINES\r\nFROM REAR ADMIRAL HOLLWEG'S BOOK]\r\n\r\nGermany's submarine warfare which was introduced in February, 1915,\r\nbegan by sinking less than 50,000 tons of ships per month.  By\r\nNovember, 1915, the amount of tonnage destroyed per month was close to\r\n200,000 tons.  By January, 1916, the tonnage of ships destroyed by\r\nsubmarines had fallen to under 100,000 tons.  In April, 1916, as Grand\r\nAdmiral von Tirpitz' followers made one more effort to make the\r\nsubmarine warfare successful, nearly 275,000 tons were being destroyed\r\na month.  But after the sinking of the _Sussex_ and the growing\r\npossibilities of war with the United States the submarine warfare was\r\nagain held back and in July less than 125,000 tons of shipping were\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nAt this time, however, the submarine campaign itself underwent a\r\nchange.  Previously most of the ships destroyed were sunk off the coast\r\nof England, France or in the Mediterranean.  During the year and a half\r\nof the submarine campaign the Allies' method of catching and destroying\r\nsubmarines became so effective it was too costly to maintain submarine\r\nwarfare in belligerent waters.  The German Navy had tried all kinds of\r\nschemes but none was very successful.  After the sinking of the\r\n_Ancona_ the Admiralty planned for two submarines to work together, but\r\nthis was not as successful as it might have been.  During May, June and\r\nJuly the submarine warfare was practically given up as the losses of\r\nships during those months will show.  There was a steep decline from a\r\nquarter of a million tons in April to less than 140,000 tons in May,\r\nabout 125,000 tons in June and not much more than 100,000 tons in July.\r\n\r\nDuring these three months the Navy was being bitterly criticised for\r\nits inactivity.  But as the events six months later will show the\r\nGerman navy simply used these months to prepare for a much stronger\r\nsubmarine campaign which was to begin in August.  By this time it was\r\ndecided, however, not to risk a submarine campaign off the Allied\r\ncoasts but to operate in the Atlantic, off the coasts of Spain and\r\nNorway.  This method of submarine warfare proved very successful and by\r\nNovember, 1916, Germany was sinking over 425,000 tons of ships per\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nDuring this swell in the success of the submarine campaign the U-53 was\r\ndespatched across the Atlantic to operate off the United States coasts.\r\n\r\nU-53 was sent here for two purposes: First, it was to demonstrate to\r\nthe American people that, in event of war, submarines could work terror\r\noff the Atlantic coast.  Second, it was to show the naval authorities\r\nwhether their plans for an attack on American shipping would be\r\npractical.  U-53 failed to terrorise the United States, but it proved\r\nto the Admiralty that excursions to American waters were feasible.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, when the Kaiser defied the United States by threatening\r\nall neutral shipping in European waters, Germany had four hundred\r\nundersea boats completed or in course of construction.  This included\r\nbig U-boats, like the U-53, with a cruising radius of five thousand\r\nmiles, and the smaller craft, with fifteen-day radius, for use against\r\nEngland, as well as supply ships and mine layers.  But not all these\r\nwere ready for use against the Allies and the United States at that\r\ntime.  About one hundred were waiting for trained crews or were being\r\ncompleted in German shipyards.\r\n\r\nIt was often said in Berlin that the greatest loss when a submarine\r\nfailed to return was the crew.  It required more time to train the men\r\nthan to build the submarine.  According to Germany's new method of\r\nconstruction, a submarine can be built in fifteen days.  Parts are\r\nstamped out in the factories and assembled at the wharves.  But it\r\ntakes from sixty to ninety days to educate the men and get them\r\naccustomed to the seasick motion of the U-boats.  Besides, it requires\r\nexperienced officers to train the new men.\r\n\r\nTo meet this demand Germany began months ago to train men who could man\r\nthe newest submarines.  So a school was established--a School of\r\nSubmarine Murder--and for many months the man who torpedoed the\r\n_Lusitania_ was made chief of the staff of educators.  It was a new\r\ntask for German kultur.\r\n\r\nFor the German people the lessons of the _Lusitania_ have been exactly\r\nopposite those normal people would learn.  The horror of non-combatants\r\ngoing down on a passenger liner, sunk without warning, was nothing to\r\nbe compared to the heroism of aiming the torpedo and running away.\r\nSixty-eight million Germans think their submarine officers and crews\r\nare the greatest of the great.\r\n\r\nWhen the Berlin Foreign Office announced, after the sinking of the\r\n_Sussex_, that the ruthless torpedoing of ships would be stopped the\r\nGerman statesmen meant this method would be discontinued until there\r\nwere sufficient submarines to defy the United States.  At once the\r\nGerman navy, which has always been anti-American, began building\r\nsubmarines night and day.  Every one in the Government knew the time\r\nwould come when Germany would have to break its _Sussex_ pledge.\r\n\r\nThe German navy early realised the need for trained men, so it\r\nrecalled, temporarily, for educational work the man who sank the\r\n_Lusitania_.\r\n\r\n\"But, who sank the _Lusitania_?\" you ask.\r\n\r\n\"The torpedo which sank the _Lusitania_ and killed over one hundred\r\nAmericans and hundreds of other noncombatants was fired by Oberleutnant\r\nzur See (First Naval Lieutenant) Otto Steinbrink, commander of one of\r\nthe largest German submarines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he punished?\" you ask.\r\n\r\n\"Kaiser Wilhelm decorated him with the highest military order, the Pour\r\nle Merite!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Steinbrink now?\"\r\n\r\n\"On December 8, 1916, the German Admiralty announced that he had just\r\nreturned from a special trip, having torpedoed and mined twenty-two\r\nships on one voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What had he been doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"For several months last summer he trained officers and crews in this\r\nbranch of warfare, which gained him international notoriety.\"\r\n\r\nIt is said that Steinbrink has trained more naval men than any other\r\nsubmarine commander.  If this be true, is there any wonder that Germany\r\nshould be prepared to conduct a ruthless submarine warfare throughout\r\nthe world?  Is it surprising that American ships should be sunk,\r\nAmerican citizens murdered and the United States Government defied when\r\nthe German navy has been employing the man who murdered the passengers\r\nof the _Lusitania_ as the chief instructor of submarine murderers?\r\n\r\nThe Krupp interests have played a leading role in the war, not only by\r\nmanufacturing billions of shells and cannon, and by financing\r\npropaganda in the United States, but by building submarines.  At the\r\nKrupp wharves at Kiel some of the best undersea craft are launched.\r\nOther shipyards at Bremen, Hamburg and Danzig have been mobilised for\r\nthis work, too.  Just a few weeks before diplomatic relations were\r\nbroken a group of American doctors, who were investigating prison camp\r\nconditions, went to Danzig.  Here they learned that the twelve wharves\r\nthere were building between 45 and 50 submarines annually.  These were\r\nthe smaller type for use in the English Channel.  At Hamburg the\r\nHamburg-American Line wharves were mobilised for submarine construction\r\nalso.  At the time diplomatic relations were severed observers in\r\nGermany estimated that 250 submarines were being launched annually and\r\nthat preparations were being made greatly to increase this number.\r\n\r\nSubmarine warfare is a very exact and difficult science.  Besides the\r\nskilled captain, competent first officers, wireless operators and\r\nartillerymen, engineers are needed.  Each man, too, must be a \"seadog.\"\r\nSome of the smaller submarines toss like tubs when they reach the ocean\r\nand only toughened seamen can stand the \"wear and tear.\"  Hence the\r\nweeks and months which are necessary to put the men in order before\r\nthey leave home for their first excursion in sea murder.\r\n\r\nBut Germany has learned a great deal during two years of hit-and-miss\r\nsubmarine campaigns.  When von Tirpitz began, in 1915, he ordered his\r\nmen to work off the coasts of England.  Then so many submarines were\r\nlost it became a dangerous and expensive military operation.  The\r\nAllies began to use great steel nets, both as traps and as protection\r\nto warships.  The German navy learned this within a very short time,\r\nand the military engineers were ordered to perfect a torpedo which\r\nwould go through a steel net.  The first invention was a torpedo with\r\nknives on the nose.  When the nose hit the net there was a minor\r\nexplosion.  The knives were sent through the net, permitting the\r\ntorpedo to continue on its way.  Then the Allies doubled the nets, and\r\ntwo sets of knives were attached to the German torpedoes.  But\r\ngradually the Allies employed nets as traps.  These were anchored or\r\ndragged by fishing boats.  Some submarines have gotten inside, been\r\njuggled around, but have escaped.  More, perhaps, have been lost this\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThen, when merchant ships began to carry armament, the periscopes were\r\nshot away, so the navy invented a so-called \"finger-periscope,\" a thin\r\nrod pipe with a mirror at one end.  This rod could he shoved out from\r\nthe top of the submarine and used for observation purposes in case the\r\nbig periscope was destroyed.  From time to time there were other\r\ninventions.  As the submarine fleet grew the means of communicating\r\nwith each other while submerged at sea were perfected.  Copper plates\r\nwere fastened fore and aft on the outside of submarines, and it was\r\nmade possible for wireless messages to be sent through the water at a\r\ndistance of fifty miles.\r\n\r\nA submarine cannot aim at a ship without some object as a sight.  So\r\none submarine often acted as a \"sight\" for the submarine firing the\r\ntorpedo.  Submarines, which at first were unarmed, were later fitted\r\nwith armour plate and cannon were mounted on deck.  The biggest\r\nsubmarines now carry 6-inch guns.\r\n\r\nLike all methods of ruthless warfare the submarine campaign can be and\r\nwill be for a time successful.  Germany's submarine warfare today is\r\nmuch more successful than the average person realises.  By December,\r\n1916, for instance, the submarines were sinking a half million tons of\r\nships a month.  In January, 1917, over 600,000 tons were destroyed.  On\r\nFebruary nearly 800,000 tons were lost.  The destruction of ships means\r\na corresponding destruction of cargoes, of many hundreds of thousands\r\nof tons.  When Germany decided the latter part of January to begin a\r\nruthless campaign German authorities calculated they could sink an\r\naverage of 600,000 tons per month and that in nine months nearly\r\n6,000,000 tons of shipping could be sent to the bottom of the\r\nocean,--then the Allies would be robbed of the millions of tons of\r\ngoods which these ships could carry.\r\n\r\nIn any military campaign one of the biggest problems is the\r\ntransportation of troops and supplies.  Germany during this war has had\r\nto depend upon her railroads; the Allies have depended upon ships.\r\nGermany looked at her own military situation and saw that if the Allies\r\ncould destroy as many railroad cars as Germany expected to sink ships,\r\nGermany would be broken up and unable to continue the war.  Germany\r\nbelieved ships were to the Allies what railroad carriages are to\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe General Staff looked at the situation from other angles.  During\r\nthe winter there was a tremendous coal shortage in France and Italy.\r\nThere had been coal riots in Paris and Rome.  The Italian Government\r\nwas so in need of coal that it had to confiscate even private supplies.\r\nThe Grand Hotel in Rome, for instance, had to give up 300 tons which it\r\nhad in its coal bins.  In 1915 France had been importing 2,000,000 tons\r\nof coal a month across the Channel from England.  Because of the\r\nordinary loss of tonnage the French coal imports dropped 400,000 tons\r\nper month.  Germany calculated that if she could decrease England's\r\ncoal exports 400,000 tons a month by an ordinary submarine campaign\r\nthat she could double it by a ruthless campaign.\r\n\r\nGermany was looking forward to the Allied offensive which was expected\r\nthis Spring.  Germany knew that the Allies would need troops and\r\nammunition.  She knew that to manufacture ammunition and war supplies\r\ncoal was needed.  Germany calculated that if the coal importations to\r\nFrance could be cut down a million tons a month France would not be\r\nable to manufacture the necessary ammunition for an offensive lasting\r\nseveral months.\r\n\r\nGermany knew that England and France were importing thousands of tons\r\nof war supplies and food from the United States.  Judging from the\r\nGerman newspapers which I read at this time every one in Germany had\r\nthe impression that the food situation in England and France was almost\r\nas bad as in Germany.  Even Ambassador Gerard had somewhat the same\r\nimpression.  When he left Germany for Switzerland on his way to Spain,\r\nhe took two cases of eggs which he had purchased in Denmark.  One night\r\nat a reception in Berne, one of the American women in the Gerard party\r\nasked the French Ambassador whether France really had enough food!  If\r\nthe Americans coming from Germany had the impression that the Allies\r\nwere sorely in need of supplies one can see how general the impression\r\nmust have been throughout Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Paris I was surprised to see so much food and to see such\r\na variety.  Paris appeared to be as normal in this respect as\r\nCopenhagen or Rotterdam.  But I was told by American women who were\r\nkeeping house there that it was becoming more and more difficult to get\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nAfter Congress declared war it became evident for the first time that\r\nthe Allies really did need war supplies and food from the United States\r\nmore than they needed anything else.  London and Paris officials\r\npublicly stated that this was the kind of aid the Allies really needed.\r\nIt became evident, too, that the Allies not only needed the food but\r\nthat they needed ships to carry supplies across the Atlantic.  One of\r\nthe first things President Wilson did was to approve plans for the\r\nconstruction of a fleet of 3,000 wooden ships practically to bridge the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three months of 1917 submarine warfare was a success\r\nin that it so decreased the ship tonnage and the importations of the\r\nAllies that they needed American co-operation and assistance.  _So the\r\nUnited States really enters the war at the critical and decisive\r\nstage_.  Germany believes she can continue to sink ships faster than\r\nthey can be built, but Germany did not calculate upon a fleet of wooden\r\nbottom vessels being built in the United States to make up for the\r\nlosses.  Germany did not expect the United States to enter the war with\r\nall the vigour and energy of the American people.  Germany calculated\r\nupon internal troubles, upon opposition to the war and upon the\r\npacifists to have America make as many mistakes as England did during\r\nthe first two years of the war.  But the United States has learned and\r\nprofited by careful observation in Europe.  Just as England's\r\ndeclaration of war on Germany in support of Belgium and France was a\r\nsurprise to Germany; just as the shipment of war supplies by American\r\nfirms to the Allies astonished Germany, so will the construction of\r\n3,000 wooden vessels upset the calculations of the German General Staff.\r\n\r\nWhile American financial assistance will be a great help to the Allies\r\nthat will not affect the German calculations because when the Kaiser\r\nand his Generals decided on the 27th of January to damn all neutrals,\r\nGerman financiers were not consulted.\r\n\r\nNeither did the German General Staff count upon the Russian Revolution\r\ngoing against them.  Germany had expected a revolution there, but\r\nGermany bet upon the Czar and the Czar's German wife.  As Lieutenant\r\nColonel von Haeften, Chief Military Censor in Berlin, told the\r\ncorrespondents, Germany calculated upon the internal troubles in Russia\r\naiding her.  But the Allies and the people won the Russian Revolution.\r\nGermany's hopes that the Czar might again return to power or that the\r\npeople might overthrow their present democratic leaders will come to\r\nnaught now that America has declared war and thrown her tremendous and\r\nunlimited moral influence behind the Allies and with the Russian people.\r\n\r\nRear Admiral Hollweg's calculations that 24,253,615 tons of shipping\r\nremained for the world freight transmission at the beginning of 1917,\r\ndid not take into consideration confiscation by the United States of\r\nnearly 2,500,000 tons of German and Austrian shipping in American\r\nports.  He did not expect the United States to build 3,000 new ships in\r\n1917.  He did not expect the United States to purchase the ships under\r\nconstruction in American wharves for neutral European countries.\r\n\r\nThe German submarine campaign, like all other German \"successes,\" will\r\nbe temporary.  Every time the General Staff has counted upon \"ultimate\r\nvictory\" it has failed to take into consideration the determination of\r\nthe enemy.  Germany believed that the world could be \"knocked out\" by\r\nbig blows.  Germany thought when she destroyed and invaded Belgium and\r\nnorthern France that these two countries would not be able to \"come\r\nback.\"  Germany thought when she took Warsaw and a great part of\r\nwestern Russia that Russia would not he able to continue the war.\r\nGermany figured that after the invasion of Roumania and Servia that\r\nthese two countries would not need to be considered seriously in the\r\nfuture.  Germany believed that her submarine campaign would be\r\nsuccessful before the United States could come to the aid of the\r\nAllies.  German hope of \"ultimate victory\" has been postponed ever\r\nsince September, 1914, when von Kluck failed to take Paris.  And\r\nGermany's hopes for an \"ultimate victory\" this summer before the United\r\nStates can get into the war will be postponed so long that Germany will\r\nmake peace not on her own terms but upon the terms which the United\r\nStates of Democracy of the Whole World will dictate.\r\n\r\nOne day in Paris I met Admiral LeCaze, the Minister of Marine, in his\r\noffice in the Admiralty.  He discussed the submarine warfare from every\r\nangle.  He said the Germans, when they figured upon so many tons of\r\nshipping and of supplies destroyed by submarines, failed to take into\r\nconsideration the fact that over 100 ships were arriving daily at\r\nFrench ports and that over 5,000,000 tons of goods were being brought\r\ninto France monthly.\r\n\r\nWhen I explained to him what it appeared to me would be the object of\r\nthe German ruthless campaign he said:\r\n\r\n\"Germany cannot win the war by her submarine campaign or by any other\r\nweapon.  That side will win which holds out one week, one day or one\r\nhour longer than the other.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this Admiral, who, dressed in civilian clothes, looked more like a\r\nNew York financier than a naval officer, leaned forward in his chair,\r\nlooked straight at me and concluded the interview by saying:\r\n\r\n\"The Allies will win.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLAWED NATION\r\n\r\nDuring the Somme battles several of the American correspondents in Berlin\r\nwere invited to go to the front near Peronne and were asked to luncheon\r\nby the Bavarian General von Kirchhoff, who was in command against the\r\nFrench.  When the correspondents reached his headquarters in a little\r\nwar-worn French village they were informed that the Kaiser had just\r\nsummoned the general to decorate him with the high German military order,\r\nthe Pour le Merite.  Luncheon was postponed until the general returned.\r\nThe correspondents watched him motor to the chateau where they were and\r\nwere surprised to see tears in his eyes as he stepped out of the\r\nautomobile and received the cordial greetings and congratulations of his\r\nstaff.  Von Kirchhoff, in a brief impromptu speech, paid a high tribute\r\nto the German troops which were holding the French and said the\r\ndecoration was not his but his troops'.  And in a broken voice he\r\nremarked that these soldiers were sacrificing their lives for the\r\nFatherland, but were called \"Huns and Barbarians\" for doing it.  There\r\nwas another long pause and the general broke down, cried and had to leave\r\nhis staff and guests.\r\n\r\nThese indictments of the Allies were more terrible to him than the war\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Kirchhoff in this respect is typical of Germany.  Most\r\nGermans, practically every German I knew, could not understand why the\r\nAllies did not respect their enemies as the Germans said they respected\r\nthe Allies.\r\n\r\nA few weeks later, in November, when I was on the Somme with another\r\ngroup of correspondents, I was asked by nearly every officer I met why it\r\nwas that Germany was so hated throughout the world.  It was a question I\r\ncould not easily answer without, perhaps, hurting the feelings of the men\r\nwho wanted to know, or insulting them, which as a guest I did not desire\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nA few days later on the train from Cambrai to Berlin I was asked by a\r\ngroup of officers to explain why the people in the United States,\r\nespecially, were so bitter.  To get the discussion under way the Captain\r\nfrom the General Staff who had acted as our escort presented his\r\nindictment of American neutrality and asked me to reply.\r\n\r\nThis feeling, this desire to know why Germany was regarded as an outlawed\r\nnation, was not present in Germany early in 1915 when I arrived.  In\r\nFebruary, 1915, people were confident.  They were satisfied with the\r\nprogress of the war.  They knew the Allies hated them and they returned\r\nthe hate and did not care.  But between February, 1915, and November,\r\n1916, a great change took place.  On my first trip to the front in April,\r\n1915, I heard of no officers or men shedding tears because the Allies\r\nhated them.\r\n\r\nWhen I sailed from New York two years ago it seemed to me that sentiment\r\nin the United States was about equally divided; that most people favoured\r\nneutrality, even a majority of those who supported the Entente.  The\r\nfeeling of sympathy which so many thousands of Americans had for Germany\r\nI could, at that time, readily understand, because I myself was\r\nsympathetic.  I felt that Germany had not had a fighting chance with\r\npublic opinion in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ADVERTISEMENT IN THE BERLIN \"DEUTSCHE TAGES-ZEITUNG\"\r\nFOR THE BOOK--\"PRESIDENT BLUFF\" MEANING PRESIDENT WILSON]\r\n\r\nI could not believe that all the charges against Germany applied to the\r\nGerman people.  Although it was difficult to understand what Germany had\r\ndone in Belgium, although it was evident and admitted by the Chancellor\r\nthat Germany violated the neutrality of that country, I could not believe\r\nthat a nation, which before the war had such a high standing in science\r\nand commerce, could have plotted or desired such a tremendous war as\r\nswept Europe in 1914.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived in Berlin on March 17, 1915, and met German officials and\r\npeople for the first time, I was impressed by their sincerity, their\r\nhonesty and their belief that the Government did not cause the war and\r\nwas fighting to defend the nation.  At the theatre I saw performances of\r\nShakespeare, which were among the best I had ever seen.  I marvelled at\r\nthe wonderful modern hospitals and at the efficiency and organisation of\r\nthe Government.  I marvelled at the expert ways in which prison camps\r\nwere administered.  I was surprised to find railroad trains clean and\r\npunctual.  It seemed to me as if Germany was a nation which had reached\r\nthe height of perfection and that it was honestly and conscientiously\r\ndefending itself against the group of powers which desired its\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nFor over a year I entered enthusiastically into the work of interpreting\r\nand presenting this Germany to the American people.  At this time there\r\nwas practically no food problem.  German banks and business men were\r\npreparing for and expecting peace.  The Government was already making\r\nplans for after the war when soldiers would return from the front.  A\r\nReichstag Committee had been appointed to study Germany's possible peace\r\ntime labour needs and to make arrangements for solving them.\r\n\r\nBut in the fall of 1915 the changes began.  The _Lusitania_ had been\r\ndestroyed in May and almost immediately the hate campaign against America\r\nwas started.  I saw the tendency to attack and belittle the United States\r\ngrow not only in the army, in the navy and in the press, but among the\r\npeople.  I saw that Germany was growing to deeply resent anything the\r\nUnited States Government said against what the German Government did.\r\nWhen this anti-American campaign was launched I observed a tendency on\r\nthe part of the Foreign Office to censor more strictly the telegrams\r\nwhich the correspondents desired to send to the American newspapers.\r\nPreviously, the Foreign Office had been extremely frank and cordial and\r\npermitted correspondents to send what they observed and heard, as long as\r\nthe despatches did not contain information which would aid the Allies in\r\ntheir military or economic attacks on Germany.  As the hate articles\r\nappeared in the newspapers the correspondents were not only prohibited\r\nfrom sending them, but they were criticised by the Foreign Office for\r\nwriting anything which might cause the American people to be angered at\r\nGermany.  One day I made a translation of a bitter article in the _B. Z.\r\nam Mittag_ and submitted it to the Foreign Office censor.  He asked why I\r\npaid so much attention to articles in this newspaper which he termed a\r\n\"Kaese-blatt\"--literally \"a cheese paper.\"  He said it had no influence\r\nin Germany; that no one cared what it said.  This newspaper, however, was\r\nthe only noon-day edition in Berlin and was published by the largest\r\nnewspaper publishing house in Germany, Ullstein & Co.  At his request I\r\nwithdrew the telegram and forgot the incident.  Within a few days,\r\nhowever, Count zu Reventlow, in the _Deutsche Tageszeitung_, and Georg\r\nBernhard, in the _Vossische Zeitung_, wrote sharp attacks on President\r\nWilson.  But I could not telegraph these.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the fall of 1915 not only the German Government but the\r\nGerman people were charitable to the opinions of neutrals, especially\r\nthose who happened to be in Germany for business or professional reasons,\r\nbut, as the anti-American campaign and the cry that America was not\r\nneutral by permitting supplies to be shipped to the Allies became more\r\nextensive, the public became less charitable.  Previously a neutral in\r\nGermany could be either pro-German, pro-Ally or neutral.  Now, however,\r\nit was impossible to be neutral, especially if one were an American,\r\nbecause the very statement that one was an American carried with it the\r\nimplication that one was anti-German.  The American colony itself became\r\ndivided.  There was the pro-American group and the pro-German government\r\ngroup.  The former was centred at the American Embassy.  The latter was\r\ninspired by the German-Americans who had lived in Germany most of their\r\nlives and by other sympathetic Americans who came from the United States.\r\nMeanwhile there were printed in German newspapers many leading articles\r\nand interviews from the American press attacking President Wilson, and\r\nany one sympathising with the President, even Ambassador Gerard, became\r\nautomatically \"Deutschfeidlich.\"\r\n\r\nAs the submarine warfare became more and more a critical issue German\r\nfeeling towards the United States changed.  I found that men who were\r\nopenly professing their friendship for the United States were secretly\r\ndoing everything within their power to intimidate America.  The\r\nGovernment began to feel as if the American factories which were\r\nsupplying the Allies were as much subject to attack as similar factories\r\nin Allied countries.  I recall one time learning at the American Embassy\r\nthat a man named Wulf von Igel had asked Ambassador Gerard for a safe\r\nconduct, on the ground that he was going to the United States to try and\r\nhave condensed milk shipped to Germany for the children.  Mr. Gerard\r\nrefused to ask Washington to grant this man a safe conduct.  I did not\r\nlearn until several months afterwards that Herr von Igel had been asked\r\nto go to the United States by Under Secretary of State Zimmermann for one\r\nof two purposes, either he was to purchase a controlling interest in the\r\nDu Pont Powder Mills no matter what that cost, or he was to stir up\r\ndissatisfaction in Mexico.  Zimmermann gave him a card of introduction to\r\nCount von Bernstorff, the German Ambassador in Washington, and told him\r\nthat the German Embassy would supply him with all necessary funds.\r\n\r\nCarrying out the German idea that it was right to harm or destroy\r\nAmerican property which was directly or indirectly aiding the Allies,\r\nboth Germany and Austria-Hungary published notices that their citizens in\r\nthe United States were not permitted to work in such factories.  And\r\nplots which Captains Boy-Ed and von Papen instigated here were done with\r\nthe approval and encouragement of the German Government.  If any proof is\r\nneeded for this statement, in addition to that already published, it is\r\nthat both of these men upon their return to Germany were regarded as\r\nheroes and given the most trusted positions.  Captain Boy-Ed was placed\r\nat the head of the Intelligence Department of the Navy and Captain von\r\nPapen was assigned to the Headquarters of the General Commanding the\r\noperations on the Somme.\r\n\r\nAs the food situation in Germany became worse the disposition of the\r\npeople changed still more.  The Government had already pointed out in\r\nnumerous public statements that the United States was not neutral because\r\nit overlooked the English blockade and thought only about the German\r\nsubmarine war.  So as food difficulties developed the people blamed the\r\nUnited States and held President Wilson personally responsible for the\r\ngrowing shortages within Germany.  The people believed Mr. Wilson was\r\ntheir greatest enemy and that he was the man most to be feared.  How\r\nstrong this feeling was not only among the people but in Government\r\ncircles was to be shown later when Germany announced her submarine\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAs was pointed out in a previous chapter while Germany was arguing\r\nagainst shipments of war munitions from the United States she was herself\r\nresponsible for the preparations which Russia and Roumania had made\r\nagainst her, but this proof of deception on the part of the Government\r\nwas never explained to the German people.  Furthermore the people were\r\nnever told why the United States asked for the recall of Germany's two\r\nattaches who were implicated in spy plots.  Nothing was ever published in\r\nthe German newspapers about Herr von Igel.  The newspapers always\r\npublished despatches which told of the destruction of ammunition\r\nfactories by plotters, but never about the charges against and arrests of\r\nGerman reservists.  Just as the German Government has never permitted the\r\npeople to know that it prepared for a war against nine nations, as the\r\ndocument I saw in the Chief Telegraph Office shows, so has it not\r\nexplained to the people the real motives and the real arguments which\r\nPresident Wilson presented in his many submarine notes.  Whenever these\r\nnotes were published in the German newspapers the Government always\r\npublished an official explanation, or correspondents were inspired to\r\nwrite the Government views, so the people could not think for themselves\r\nor come to honest personal conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of Mr. Wilson's diplomacy against Germany was decreased\r\nby some German-Americans, and the fact that the United States is to-day\r\nat war with Germany is due to this blundering on the behalf of some of\r\nthose over-zealous citizens who, being so anxious to aid Germany, became\r\nanti-Wilson and in the long run defeated what they set out to accomplish.\r\nHad the German Government not been assured by some German-Americans that\r\nthey would never permit President Wilson to break diplomatic relations or\r\ngo to war, had these self-appointed envoys stayed away from Berlin, the\r\nrelations between the United States and Germany might to-day be different\r\nthan they are.  Because if Germany at the outset of the submarine\r\nnegotiations had been given the impression by a united America that the\r\nPresident spoke for the country, Germany would undoubtedly have given up\r\nall hope of a ruthless submarine warfare.\r\n\r\nI think President Wilson and Mr. Gerard realised that the activities of\r\nthe German-Americans here were not only interfering with the diplomatic\r\nnegotiations but that the German-Americans were acting against their own\r\nbest interests if they really desired peace with Germany.\r\n\r\nWhen some of the President's friends saw that the German people were\r\nreceiving such biased news from the United States and that Germany had no\r\nopportunity of learning the real sentiment here, nor of sounding the\r\ndepth of American indignation over the _Lusitania_ they endeavoured to\r\nget despatches from the United States to Germany to enlighten the people.\r\nMr. Roy W. Howard, President of the United Press, endeavoured several\r\ntimes while I was in Berlin to get unadulterated American news in the\r\nGerman newspapers, but the German Government was not overly anxious to\r\nhave such information published.  It was too busy encouraging the\r\nanti-American sentiment for the purpose of frightening the United States.\r\nIt was difficult, too, for the United Press to get the necessary\r\nco-operation in the United States for this news service.  After the\r\nsettlement of the _Sussex_ dispute the Democratic newspapers of Germany,\r\nthose which were supporting the Chancellor, were anxious to receive\r\nreports from here, but the German Foreign Office would not encourage the\r\nmatter to the extent of using the wireless towers at Sayville and\r\nTuckerton as means of transmitting the news.\r\n\r\nHow zealously the Foreign Office censor guards what appears in the German\r\nnewspapers was shown about two weeks before diplomatic relations were\r\nbroken.  When the announcement was wirelessed to the United States that\r\nGermany had adopted the von Tirpitz blockade policy the United Press sent\r\nme a number of daily bulletins telling what the American Press,\r\nCongressmen and the Government were thinking and saying about the new\r\norder.  The first day these despatches reached me I sent them to several\r\nof the leading newspapers only to be notified in less than an hour\r\nafterward by the Foreign Office that I was to send no information to the\r\nGerman newspapers without first sending it to the Foreign Office.  Two\r\ndays after the blockade order was published I received a telegram from\r\nMr. Howard saying that diplomatic relations would be broken, and giving\r\nme a summary of the press comment.  I took this despatch to the Foreign\r\nOffice and asked permission to send it to the newspapers.  It was\r\nrefused.  Throughout this crisis which lasted until the 10th of February\r\nthe Foreign Office would not permit a single despatch coming direct from\r\nAmerica to be printed in the German newspapers.  The Foreign Office\r\npreferred to have the newspapers publish what came by way of England and\r\nFrance so that the Government could always explain that only English and\r\nFrench news could reach Germany because the United States was not\r\ninterested in seeing that Germany obtained first hand information.\r\n\r\nWhile Germany was arguing that the United States was responsible for her\r\ndesperate situation, economically, and while President Wilson was being\r\nblamed for not breaking the Allied blockade, the German Foreign Office\r\nwas doing everything within its power to prevent German goods from being\r\nshipped to the United States.  When, through the efforts of Ambassador\r\nGerard, numerous attempts were made to get German goods, including\r\nmedicines and dye-stuffs, to the United States, the German Government\r\nreplied that these could not leave the country unless an equal amount of\r\ngoods were sent to Germany.  Then, when the State Department arranged for\r\nan equal amount of American goods to be shipped in exchange the German\r\nForeign Office said all these goods would have to be shipped to and from\r\nGerman ports.  When the State Department listened to this demand and\r\nAmerican steamers were started on their way to Hamburg and Bremen the\r\nGerman Navy was so busy sewing mines off these harbours to keep the\r\nEnglish fleet away that they failed to notify the American skippers where\r\nthe open channels were.  As a result so many American ships were sunk\r\ntrying to bring goods into German harbours that it became unprofitable\r\nfor American shippers to try to accommodate Germany.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, also, the German Government began its policy of\r\ndiscouraging American business in Germany.  Ambassador Gerard had had a\r\nlong wrangle with the Chancellor over a bill which was introduced in the\r\nReichstag shortly after the beginning of the war to purchase all foreign\r\noil properties \"within the German Customs Union.\"  The bill was examined\r\nby Mr. Gerard, who, for a number of years, was a Supreme Court Judge of\r\nNew York.  He discovered that the object of the bill was to put the\r\nStandard Oil Company out of business by purchasing all of this company's\r\nproperty except that located in Hamburg.  This was the joker.  Hamburg\r\nwas not in the German Customs Union and the bill provided for the\r\nconfiscation of all property not in this Union.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerard called upon the Chancellor and told him that the United States\r\nGovernment could not permit such a bill to be passed without a vigorous\r\nprotest.  The Chancellor asked Mr. Gerard whether President Wilson and\r\nSecretary of State Bryan would ever protect such a corporation as the\r\nStandard Oil Company was supposed to be.  Mr. Gerard replied that the\r\nvery fact that these two officials were known in the public mind as\r\nhaving no connection with this corporation would give them an opportunity\r\nof defending its interests the same as the Government would defend the\r\ninterests of any other American.  The Chancellor seemed surprised at this\r\nstatement and Mr. Gerard continued about as follows:\r\n\r\n\"You know that Germany has already been discriminating against the\r\nStandard Oil Company.  You know that the Prussian State Railways charge\r\nthis American corporation twice as much to ship oil from Hamburg to\r\nBremen as they charge the German oil interests to ship Roumanian oil from\r\nthe Austrian border to Berlin.  Now don't you think that's enough?\"\r\n\r\nThe interview ended here.  And the bill was never brought up in the\r\nReichstag.\r\n\r\nBut this policy of the Government of intimidating and intriguing against\r\nAmerican interests was continued until diplomatic relations were broken.\r\nIn December, 1916, Adolph Barthmann, an American citizen, who owned the\r\nlargest shoe store in Berlin, desired to close his place of business and\r\ngo to the United States.  It was impossible for him to get American shoes\r\nbecause of the Allied blockade and he had decided to discontinue business\r\nuntil peace was made.\r\n\r\nThroughout the war it has been necessary for all Americans, as well as\r\nall other neutrals, to obtain permission from the police before they\r\ncould leave.  Barthmann went to Police Headquarters, and asked for\r\nauthority to go to the United States.  He was informed that his passport\r\nwould have to be examined by the General Staff and that he could call for\r\nit within eight days.  At the appointed day Barthmann appeared at Police\r\nHeadquarters where he was informed by the Police Captain that upon orders\r\nof the General Staff he would have to sign a paper and swear to the\r\nstatement that neither he nor the American firms he represented had sold,\r\nor would sell, shoes to the Allies.  Barthmann was told that this\r\nstatement would have to be sworn to by another American resident of\r\nBerlin and that unless this was done he would not be permitted to return\r\nto Germany after the war.  Mr. Barthmann had to sign the document under\r\nprotest before his American passport was returned.\r\n\r\nThe facts in this as in the other instances which I have narrated, are in\r\nthe possession of the State Department at Washington.\r\n\r\nWhen the German Government began to fear that the United States\r\nmight some day join the Allies if the submarine campaign was\r\nrenewed, it campaigned by threatening the United States with a\r\nRussian-Japanese-German alliance after the war against England and the\r\nUnited States.  These threats were not disguised.  Ambassador Gerard was\r\ninformed, indirectly and unofficially of course, by German financiers and\r\nmembers of the Reichstag that Germany \"would be forced\" to make such an\r\nalliance if the United States ever joined the Allies.  As was shown later\r\nby the instructions of Secretary of State Zimmermann to the German\r\nMinister in Mexico City, Germany has not only not given up that idea, but\r\nGermany now looks forward to Mexico as the fourth member of the league.\r\n\r\nAs Germany became more and more suspicious of Americans in Germany, who\r\nwere not openly pro-German, she made them suffer when they crossed the\r\nGerman frontier to go to neutral countries.  The German military\r\nauthorities, at border towns such as Warnemuende and Bentheim, took a\r\ndislike to American women who were going to Holland or Denmark, and\r\nespecially to the wives of U. S. consular officials.  One time when I was\r\ngoing from Berlin to Copenhagen I learned from the husband of one of the\r\nwomen examined at the border what the authorities had done to her.  I saw\r\nher before and after the ordeal and when I heard of what an atrocious\r\nexamination they had made I understood why she was in bed ten days\r\nafterward and under the constant care of physicians.  Knowing what German\r\nmilitary officers and German women detectives had done in some of the\r\ninvaded countries, one does not need to know the details of these\r\ninsults.  It is sufficient to state that after the wives of several\r\nAmerican officials and other prominent American residents of Berlin had\r\nbeen treated in this manner that the State Department wrote a vigorous\r\nand defiant note to Germany stating that unless the practice was\r\nimmediately discontinued the United States would give up the oversight of\r\nall German interests in Allied countries.  The ultimatum had the desired\r\neffect.  The German Government replied that while the order of the\r\nGeneral Staff could not be changed it would be waived in practice.\r\n\r\nNo matter who the American is, who admired Germany, or, who respected\r\nGermany, or, who sympathised with Germany as she was before, or, at the\r\nbeginning of the war, no American can support this Germany which I have\r\njust described, against his own country.  The Germany of 1913, which was\r\nadmired and respected by the scientific, educational and business world;\r\nthe Germany of 1913 which had no poor, which took better care of its\r\nworkmen than any nation in the world; the nation, which was considered in\r\nthe advance of all countries in dealing with economic and industrial\r\nproblems, no longer exists.  The Germany which produced Bach, Beethoven,\r\nSchiller, Goethe and other great musicians and poets has disappeared.\r\nThe musicians of to-day write hate songs.  The poets of to-day pen hate\r\nverses.  The scientists of to-day plan diabolical instruments of death.\r\nThe educators teach suspicion of and disregard for everything which is\r\nnot German.  Business men have sided with the Government in a ruthless\r\nsubmarine warfare in order to destroy property throughout the world so\r\nthat every nation will have to begin at the bottom with Germany when the\r\nwar is over.\r\n\r\nThe Germany of 1914 and 1915 which arose like one man to defend the\r\nnation is not the Germany which to-day is down on the whole world and\r\nwhich believes that its organised might can defend it against every and\r\nall nations.  The Germany I saw in 1915, composed of sympathetic, calm,\r\ncharitable, patient people is to-day a Germany made up of nervous,\r\nimpatient, deceptive and suspicious people.\r\n\r\nFrom the sinking of the _Lusitania_ to February, 1917, President Wilson\r\nmaintained diplomatic relations with Germany in order to aid the\r\ndemocratic forces which were working in that country to throw out the\r\npoison which forty years of army preparation had diffused throughout the\r\nnation.  President Wilson believed that he could rely upon the Chancellor\r\nas a leader of democracy against von Tirpitz and von Falkenhayn, as\r\nleaders of German autocracy.  The Chancellor knew the President looked\r\nupon him as the man to reform Germany.  But when the crisis came the\r\nChancellor was as weak as the Kaiser and both of them sanctioned and\r\ndefended what von Hindenburg and Ludendorf, the ammunition interests and\r\nthe navy, proposed.\r\n\r\nIf the United States were to disregard absolutely every argument which\r\nthe Allies have for fighting Germany there would still be so many\r\nAmerican indictments against the German Government that no American could\r\nhave a different opinion from that of President Wilson.\r\n\r\nGermany sank the _Lusitania_ and killed over 100 Americans and never\r\napologised for it.\r\n\r\nGermany sank the _Ancona_, killed more Americans and blamed Austria.\r\n\r\nGermany sank the _Arabic_ and torpedoed the _Sussex_.\r\n\r\nGermany promised after the sinking of the _Sussex_ to warn all merchant\r\nships before torpedoing them and then in practice threw the pledges to\r\nthe winds and ended by breaking all promises.\r\n\r\nGermany started anti-American propaganda in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe German Government made the German people suspect and hate President\r\nWilson.\r\n\r\nGermany supplied Russia and Roumania with arms and ammunition and\r\ncriticised America for permitting American business men to aid the Allies.\r\n\r\nGermany plotted against American factories.\r\n\r\nGermany tried to stir up a revolt in Mexico.\r\n\r\nGermany tried to destroy American ammunition factories.\r\n\r\nGermany blamed the United States for her food situation without\r\nexplaining to the people that one of the reasons the pork supply was\r\nexhausted and there was no sugar was because Minister of the Interior\r\nDelbrueck ordered the farmers to feed sugar to the pigs and then to\r\nslaughter them in order to save the fodder.\r\n\r\nGermany encouraged and financed German-Americans in their campaigns in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nGermany paid American writers for anti-American contributions to German\r\nnewspapers and for pro-German articles in the American press.\r\n\r\nGermany prohibited American news associations from printing unbiased\r\nAmerican news in Germany.\r\n\r\nGermany discriminated against and blacklisted American firms doing\r\nbusiness in Germany.\r\n\r\nGermany prevented American correspondents from sending true despatches\r\nfrom Berlin during every submarine crisis.\r\n\r\nGermany insulted American women, even the wives of American consular\r\nofficials, when they crossed the German border.\r\n\r\nGermany threatened the United States with a\r\nRussian-Japanese-German-Mexican alliance against England and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nGerman generals insulted American military observers at the front and the\r\nU. S. War Department had to recall them.\r\n\r\nThese are Uncle Sam's indictments of the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nGermany has outlawed herself among all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES AT WAR\r\n\r\nWhen the German Emperor in his New Year's message said that victory\r\nwould remain with Germany in 1917 he must have known that the submarine\r\nwar would be inaugurated to help bring this victory to Germany.  In\r\nMay, 1916, Admiral von Capelle explained to the Reichstag that the\r\nreason the German blockade of England could not be maintained was\r\nbecause Germany did not have sufficient submarines.  But by December\r\nthe Kaiser, who receives all the figures of the Navy, undoubtedly knew\r\nthat submarines were being built faster than any other type of ship and\r\nthat the Navy was making ready for the grand sea offensive in 1917.\r\nKnowing this, as well as knowing that President Wilson would break\r\ndiplomatic relations if the submarine war was conducted ruthlessly\r\nagain, the Kaiser was a very confident ruler to write such a New Year's\r\norder to the Army and Navy.  He must have felt sure that he could\r\ndefeat the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nTo My Army and My Navy!\r\n\r\nOnce more a war year lies behind us, replete with hard fighting and\r\nsacrifices, rich in successes and victories.\r\n\r\nOur enemies' hopes for the year 1916 have been blasted.  All their\r\nassaults in the East and West were broken to pieces through your\r\nbravery and devotion!\r\n\r\nThe latest triumphal march through Roumania has, by God's decree, again\r\npinned imperishable laurels to your standards.\r\n\r\nThe greatest naval battle of this war, the Skager Rak victory, and the\r\nbold exploits of the U-boats have assured to My Navy glory and\r\nadmiration for all time.\r\n\r\nYou are victorious on all theatres of war, ashore as well as afloat!\r\n\r\nWith unshaken trust and proud confidence the grateful Fatherland\r\nregards you.  The incomparable warlike spirit dwelling in your ranks,\r\nyour tenacious, untiring will to victory, your love for the Fatherland\r\nare guaranties to Me that victory will remain with our colours in the\r\nnew year also.\r\n\r\nGod will be with us further!\r\n\r\nMain Headquarters, Dec. 31, 1916.\r\n\r\n                  WILHELM.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KAISER'S NEW YEAR ORDER TO THE ARMY AND NAVY\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nAmbassador Gerard warned the State Department in September that Germany\r\nwould start her submarine war before the Spring of 1917 so the United\r\nStates must have known several months before the official announcement\r\ncame.  But Washington probably was under the impression that the\r\nChancellor would not break his word.  Uncle Sam at that time trusted\r\nvon Bethmann-Hollweg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCHWAB TO MR. WILSON--\"FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE, GREAT LITTLE\r\nLEADER, THE WHOLE PLACE WILL BLOW UP IF YOU SMOKE HERE!\"]\r\n\r\nDiplomatic relations were broken on February 1st.  Ambassador Gerard\r\ndeparted February 10th.  Upon his arrival in Switzerland several German\r\ncitizens, living in that country because they could not endure\r\nconditions at home, asked the Ambassador upon his arrival in Washington\r\nto urge President Wilson if he asked Congress to declare war to say\r\nthat the United States did not desire to go to war with the German\r\npeople but with the German Government.  One of these citizens was a\r\nPrussian nobleman by birth but he had been one of the leaders of the\r\ndemocratic forces in Germany and exiled himself in order to help the\r\nLiberal movement among the people by working in Switzerland.  This\r\nsuggestion was followed by the President.  When he spoke to the joint\r\nsession of Congress on February 1st he declared the United States would\r\nwage war against the Government and not against the people.  In this\r\nhistoric address the President said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have called the Congress into extraordinary session because there\r\nare serious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made\r\nimmediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally\r\npermissible that I should assume the responsibility of making.\r\n\r\n\"On the 3rd of February last I officially laid before you the\r\nextraordinary announcement of the Imperial German Government, that on\r\nand after the 1st day of February it was its purpose to put aside all\r\nrestraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every\r\nvessel that sought to approach either the ports of Great Britain and\r\nIreland or the western coasts of Europe, or any of the ports controlled\r\nby the enemies of Germany within the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\"That had seemed to be the object of the German submarine warfare\r\nearlier in the war, but since April of last year the imperial\r\nGovernment had somewhat restrained the commanders of its under-sea\r\ncraft, in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger\r\nboats should not be sunk, and that due warning would be given to all\r\nother vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy, when no\r\nresistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their\r\ncrews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their\r\nopen boats.  The precautions taken were meagre and haphazard enough, as\r\nwas proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of\r\nthe cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\n\"The new policy has swept every restriction aside.  Vessels of every\r\nkind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their\r\ndestination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom\r\nwithout warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on\r\nboard, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of\r\nbelligerents.  Even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the\r\nsorely bereaved and stricken people of Belgium, though the latter were\r\nprovided with safe conduct through the prescribed areas by the German\r\nGovernment itself, and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of\r\nidentity, have been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or\r\nof principle.\r\n\r\n\"I was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in\r\nfact be done by any government that had hitherto subscribed to the\r\nhumane practices of civilised nations.  International law had its\r\norigin in the attempt to set up some law, which would be respected and\r\nobserved upon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion and where\r\nlay the free highways of the world.  By painful stage after stage has\r\nthat law been built up, with meagre enough results, indeed, after all\r\nwas accomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear\r\nview at least of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded.\r\n\r\n\"This minimum of right the German Government has swept aside under the\r\nplea of retaliation and necessity, and because it had no weapons which\r\nit could use at sea except these, which it is impossible to employ as\r\nit is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of\r\nhumanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to\r\nunderlie the intercourse of the world.\r\n\r\n\"I am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and\r\nserious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of\r\nthe lives of non-combatants, men, women and children, engaged in\r\npursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern\r\nhistory, been deemed innocent and legitimate.  Property can be paid\r\nfor; the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be.\r\n\r\n\"The present German warfare against commerce is a warfare against\r\nmankind.  It is a war against all nations.  American ships have been\r\nsunk, American lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply\r\nto learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly\r\nnations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way.\r\nThere has been no discrimination.  The challenge is to all mankind.\r\nEach nation must decide for itself how it will meet it.  The choice we\r\nmake for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and a\r\ntemperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a\r\nnation.  We must put excited feeling away.  Our motive will not be\r\nrevenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the\r\nnation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we\r\nare only a single champion.\r\n\r\n\"When I addressed the Congress on the twenty-sixth of February last I\r\nthought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms,\r\nour right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to\r\nkeep our people safe against unlawful violence.  But armed neutrality,\r\nit now appears, is impracticable.\r\n\r\n\"Because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the German\r\nsubmarines have been used, against merchant shipping, it is impossible\r\nto defend ships against their attacks, as the law of nations has\r\nassumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or\r\ncruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open sea.  It is common\r\nprudence in such circumstances--grim necessity, indeed--to endeavour to\r\ndestroy them before they have shown their own intention.  They must be\r\ndealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all.\r\n\r\n\"The German Government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all\r\nwithin the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the\r\ndefence of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned\r\ntheir right to defend.  The intimation is conveyed that the armed\r\nguards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as\r\nbeyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be.\r\n\r\n\"Armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances\r\nand in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual; it is\r\nlikely to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically\r\ncertain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the\r\neffectiveness of belligerents.\r\n\r\n\"There is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: We\r\nwill not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred\r\nrights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated.  The\r\nwrongs against which we now array ourselves are not common wrongs; they\r\ncut to the very roots of human life.\r\n\r\n\"With a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the\r\nstep I am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves,\r\nbut in unhesitating obedience to what I deem my constitutional duty, I\r\nadvise that the Congress declare the recent course of the Imperial\r\nGerman Government to be in fact nothing less than war against the\r\nGovernment and people of the United States; that it formally accept the\r\nstatus of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it, and that it\r\ntake immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough\r\nstate of defence, but also to exert all its power and employ all its\r\nresources to bring the Government of the German Empire to terms and end\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n\"What this will involve is clear.  It will involve the utmost\r\npracticable co-operation in counsel and action with the governments now\r\nat war with Germany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those\r\ngovernments of the most liberal financial credits in order that our\r\nresources may, so far as possible, be added to theirs.\r\n\r\n\"It will involve the organisation and mobilisation of all the material\r\nresources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the\r\nincidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most\r\neconomical and efficient way possible.\r\n\r\n\"It will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all\r\nrespects, but particularly in supplying it with the best means of\r\ndealing with the enemy's submarines.  It will involve the immediate\r\naddition to the armed forces of the United States, already provided for\r\nby law in case of war, at least 500,000 men, who should, in my opinion,\r\nbe chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service; and\r\nalso the authorisation of subsequent additional increments of equal\r\nforce so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training.\r\n\r\n\"It will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to\r\nthe Government, sustained, I hope, so far as they can equitably be\r\nsustained by the present generation, by well conceived taxation.  I say\r\nsustained so far as may be by equitable taxation because it seems to me\r\nthat it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be\r\nnecessary entirely on money borrowed.  It is our duty, I most\r\nrespectfully urge, to protect our people so far as we may against the\r\nvery serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of\r\nthe inflation which would be produced by vast loans.\r\n\r\n\"In carrying out the measures by which these things are to be\r\naccomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdom of\r\ninterfering as little as possible in our own preparation and in the\r\nequipment of our own military forces with the duty--for it will be a\r\nvery practical duty--of supplying the nations already at war with\r\nGermany with the materials which they can obtain only from us or by our\r\nassistance.  They are in the field, and we should help them in every\r\nway to be effective there.\r\n\r\n\"I shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the several executive\r\ndepartments of the Government, for the consideration of your committees\r\nmeasures for the accomplishment of the several objects I have\r\nmentioned.  I hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as\r\nhaving been framed after very careful thought by the branch of the\r\nGovernment upon which the responsibility of conducting the war and\r\nsafeguarding the nation will most directly fall.\r\n\r\n\"While we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be\r\nvery clear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and\r\nour objects are.  My own thought has not been driven from its habitual\r\nand normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and I\r\ndo not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or\r\nclouded by them.\r\n\r\n\"I have exactly the same thing in mind now that I had in mind when I\r\naddressed the Senate on the 22d of January last; the same that I had in\r\nmind when I addressed the Congress on the 3d of February and on the\r\n26th of February.  Our object now, as then, is to vindicate the\r\nprinciples of peace and the justice in the life of the world as against\r\nselfish and autocratic power and to set up among the really free and\r\nself-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of\r\naction as will henceforth insure the observance of those principles.\r\n\r\n\"Neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the\r\nworld is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to\r\nthat peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments\r\nbacked by organised force which is controlled wholly by their will, not\r\nby the will of their people.  We have seen the last of neutrality in\r\nsuch circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"We are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that\r\nthe same standards of conduct and of responsibility for wrong done\r\nshall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed\r\namong the individual citizens of civilised states.\r\n\r\n\"We have no quarrel with the German people.  We have no feeling toward\r\nthem but one of sympathy and friendship.  It was not upon their impulse\r\nthat their government acted in entering this war.  It was not with\r\ntheir previous knowledge or approval.\r\n\r\n\"It was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the\r\nold unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers\r\nand wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of\r\nlittle groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their\r\nfellowmen as pawns and tools.\r\n\r\n\"Self-governed nations do not fill their neighbour states with spies or\r\nset the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of\r\naffairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make\r\nconquest.  Such designs can be successfully worked only under cover and\r\nwhere no one has the right to ask questions.\r\n\r\n\"Cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression, carried, it may\r\nbe, from generation to generation, can be worked out and kept from the\r\nlight only within the privacy of courts or behind the carefully guarded\r\nconfidences of a narrow and privileged class.  They are happily\r\nimpossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full\r\ninformation concerning all the nation's affairs.\r\n\r\n\"A steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a\r\npartnership of democratic nations.  No autocratic government could be\r\ntrusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants.\r\n\r\n\"It must be a league of honour, a partnership of opinion.  Intrigue\r\nwould eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner circles who could\r\nplan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption\r\nseated at its very heart.\r\n\r\n\"Only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honour steady to a\r\ncommon end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest\r\nof their own.\r\n\r\n\"Does not every American feel that assurance has been added to our hope\r\nfor the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening\r\nthings that have been happening within the last few weeks in Russia?\r\n\r\n\"Russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact\r\ndemocratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in all the\r\nintimate relationships of her people that spoke for their natural\r\ninstinct, their habitual attitude toward life.\r\n\r\n\"Autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as\r\nit had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power, was not in\r\nfact Russian in origin, in character or purpose, and now it has been\r\nshaken, and the great, generous Russian people have been added in all\r\ntheir native majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for\r\nfreedom in the world, for justice and for peace.  Here is a fit partner\r\nfor a league of honour.\r\n\r\n\"One of the things that have served to convince us that the Prussian\r\nautocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very\r\noutset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities\r\nand even our offices of government with spies, and set criminal\r\nintrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of council, our\r\npeace within and without, our industries and our commerce.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war\r\nbegan; and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture, but a fact\r\nproved in our courts of justice, that the intrigues, which have more\r\nthan once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating\r\nthe industries of the country, have been carried on at the instigation,\r\nwith the support, and even under the personal direction, of official\r\nagents of the imperial Government accredited to the Government of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\"Even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have\r\nsought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them,\r\nbecause we knew that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or\r\npurpose of the German people toward us (who were, no doubt, as ignorant\r\nof them as we ourselves were), but only in the selfish designs of a\r\ngovernment that did what it pleased and told its people nothing.  But\r\nthey have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that\r\nGovernment entertains no real friendship for us, and means to act\r\nagainst our peace and security at its convenience.\r\n\r\n\"That it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors the\r\nintercepted note to the German Minister at Mexico City is eloquent\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n\"We are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know\r\nthat in such a government, following such methods, we can never have a\r\nfriend, and that in the presence of its organised power, always lying\r\nin wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured\r\nsecurity for the democratic governments of the world.\r\n\r\n\"We are now about to accept gage of battle with this natural foe to\r\nliberty and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to\r\ncheck and nullify its pretensions and its power.  We are glad, now that\r\nwe see the facts with no veil of false pretence about them, to fight\r\nthus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its\r\npeoples, the German peoples included, for the rights of nations great\r\nand small, and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of\r\nlife and of obedience.\r\n\r\n\"The world must be made safe for democracy.  Its peace must be planted\r\nupon the trusted foundations of political liberty.\r\n\r\n\"We have no selfish ends to serve.  We desire no conquest, no dominion.\r\nWe seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the\r\nsacrifices we shall freely make.  We are but one of the champions of\r\nthe rights of mankind.  We shall be satisfied when those rights have\r\nbeen as secure as the faith and the freedom of the nation can make them.\r\n\r\n\"Just because we fight without rancour and without selfish objects,\r\nseeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all\r\nfree peoples, we shall, I feel confident, conduct our operations as\r\nbelligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio\r\nthe principles of right and of fair play we profess to be fighting for.\r\n\r\n\"I have said nothing of the governments allied with the imperial\r\nGovernment of Germany, because they have not made war upon us or\r\nchallenged us to defend our right and our honour.  The Austro-Hungarian\r\nGovernment has, indeed, avowed its unqualified indorsement and\r\nacceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now\r\nwithout disguise by the imperial Government, and it has therefore not\r\nbeen possible for this Government to receive Count Tarnowski, the\r\nambassador recently accredited to this Government by the imperial and\r\nroyal Government of Austria-Hungary, but that Government has not\r\nactually engaged in warfare against citizens of the United States on\r\nthe seas, and I take the liberty, for the present at least, of\r\npostponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at\r\nVienna.  We enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it\r\nbecause there are no other means of defending our rights.\r\n\r\n\"It will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents\r\nin a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus,\r\nnot in enmity toward a people or with the desire to bring any injury or\r\ndisadvantage upon them, but only in armed opposition to an\r\nirresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of\r\nhumanity and of right and is running amuck.\r\n\r\n\"We are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the German people,\r\nand shall desire nothing so much as the early re-establishment of\r\nintimate relations of mutual advantage between us--however hard it may\r\nbe for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from\r\nour hearts.  We have borne with their present Government through all\r\nthese bitter months because of that friendship--exercising a patience\r\nand forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible.\r\n\r\n\"We shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship\r\nin our daily attitude and actions toward the millions of men and women\r\nof German birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and share our\r\nlife, and we shall be proud to prove it toward all who are in fact\r\nloyal to their neighbours and to the Government in the hour of test.\r\nThey are, most of them, as true and loyal Americans as if they had\r\nnever known any other fealty or allegiance.  They will be prompt to\r\nstand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a\r\ndifferent mind and purpose.\r\n\r\n\"If there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with with a firm hand\r\nof stern repression; but if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it\r\nonly here and there, and without countenance, except from a lawless and\r\nmalignant few.\r\n\r\n\"It is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the Congress,\r\nwhich I have performed in thus addressing you.  There are, it may be,\r\nmany months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us.  It is a fearful\r\nthing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most\r\nterrible and disastrous of all wars, civilisation itself seeming to be\r\nin the balance.\r\n\r\n\"But the right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the\r\nthings which we have always carried nearest our hearts--for democracy,\r\nfor the right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their\r\nown governments, for the rights and liberties of small nations, for a\r\nuniversal dominion of right by such a concert of free peoples as shall\r\nbring peace and safety to all nations and make the world itself at last\r\nfree.\r\n\r\n\"To such a task we can dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything\r\nthat we are and everything that we have, with the pride of those who\r\nknow that the day has come when America is privileged to spend her\r\nblood and her might for the principles that gave her birth and\r\nhappiness and the peace which she has treasured.  God helping her, she\r\ncan do no other.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this speech was printed in Germany, first in excerpts and then as\r\na whole in a few papers, there were three distinct reactions:\r\n\r\n1. The Government press and the circles controlled by the Army\r\npublished violent articles against President Wilson and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n2. The democratic press led by the _Vorwaerts_ took advantage of\r\nWilson's statements to again demand election reforms.\r\n\r\n3. Public feeling generally was so aroused that the official _North\r\nGerman Gazette_ said at the end of a long editorial that the Kaiser\r\nfavoured a \"people's kingdom of Hohenzollern.\"\r\n\r\nThe ammunition interests were among the first to express their\r\nsatisfaction with America as an enemy.  The _Rheinische Westfaelische\r\nZeitung_, their official graphophone, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The real policy of America is now fully disclosed by the outbreak of\r\nthe war.  Now a flood of lies and insults, clothed in pious\r\nphraseology, will descend on us.  This is a surprise only to those who\r\nhave been reluctant to admit that America was our enemy from the\r\nbeginning.  The voice of America does not sound differently from that\r\nof any other enemy.  They are all tarred with the same brush--those\r\nhumanitarians and democrats who hurl the world into war and refuse\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Lokal Anzeiger_, which is practically edited by the Foreign\r\nOffice, said President Wilson's attempt to inveigle the German people\r\ninto a revolt against the dynasty beats anything for sheer hypocrisy in\r\nthe records of the world.\r\n\r\n\"We must assume that President Wilson deliberately tells an untruth.\r\nNot the German Government but the German race, hates this Anglo-Saxon\r\nfanatic, who has stirred into flame the consuming hatred in America\r\nwhile prating friendship and sympathy for the German people.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Lokal Anzeiger_ was right when it said the German people hated\r\nAmerica.  The _Lokal Anzeiger_ was one of the means the Government used\r\nto make the German people hate the United States.\r\n\r\nThe _North German Gazette_, which prints only editorials dictated, or\r\nauthorised by, the Secretary of State, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"A certain phrase in President Wilson's speech must be especially\r\npointed out.  The President represents himself as the bearer of true\r\nfreedom to our people who are engaged in a severe struggle for their\r\nexistence and liberty.  What slave soul does he believe exists in the\r\nGerman people when it thinks that it will allow its freedom to be meted\r\nout to them from without?  The freedom which our enemies have in store\r\nfor us we know sufficiently.\r\n\r\n\"The German people, become clearsighted in war, and see in President\r\nWilson's word nothing but an attempt to loosen the bonds between the\r\npeople and princes of Germany so that we may become an easier prey for\r\nour enemies.  We ourselves know that an important task remains to us to\r\nconsolidate our external power and our freedom at home.\"\r\n\r\nBut the mask fell from the face of Germany which she shows the outside\r\nworld, when the Kaiser issued his Easter proclamation promising\r\nelection reforms after the war.  Why did the Kaiser issue this\r\nproclamation again at this time?  As early as January, 1916, he said\r\nthe same thing to the German people in his address from the throne to\r\nthe Prussian Diet.  Why did the Kaiser feel that it was necessary to\r\nagain call the attention of the people to the fact that he would be a\r\ndemocrat when the war was over?  The Kaiser and the German army are\r\nclever in dealing with the German people.  If the Kaiser makes a\r\nmistake or does something that his army does not approve it can always\r\nbe remedied before the mistake becomes public.\r\n\r\nLast Fall a young German soldier who had been in the United States as a\r\nmoving picture operator was called to the General Staff to take moving\r\npictures at the front for propaganda purposes.  One week he was ordered\r\nto Belgium, to follow and photograph His Majesty.  At Ostend, the\r\nfamous Belgian summer resort, the Kaiser was walking along the beach\r\none day with Admiral von Schroeder, who is in command of the German\r\ndefences there.  The movie operator followed him.  The soldier had been\r\nfollowing the Kaiser several days so His Majesty recognised him,\r\nordered him to put up his camera and prepare to make a special film.\r\nWhen the camera was ready His Majesty danced a jig, waved his sceptre\r\nand then his helmet, smiled and shouted greetings to the camera\r\nman--then went on along the beach.\r\n\r\nWhen the photographer reached Berlin and showed the film to the censors\r\nof the General Staff they were shocked by the section of the Kaiser at\r\nOstend.  They ordered it cut out of the film because they did not think\r\nit advisable to show the German people how much their Emperor was\r\nenjoying the war!\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser throughout his reign has posed as a peace man although he\r\nhas been first a soldier and then an executive.  So when the Big War\r\nbroke out the Kaiser had a chance to make real what had been play for\r\nhim for forty years.  Is it surprising then that he should urge the\r\npeople to go on with the war and promise them to reform the government\r\nwhen the fighting was over?\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser's proclamation itself shows that the Kaiser is not through\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Never before have the German people proved to be so firm as in this\r\nwar.  The knowledge that the Fatherland is fighting in bitter self\r\ndefence has exercised a wonderful reconciling power, and, despite all\r\nsacrifices on the battlefield and severe privations at home, their\r\ndetermination has remained imperturbable to stake their last for the\r\nvictorious issue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCould any one except a soldier who was pleased with the progress of the\r\nwar have written such words?\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The national and social spirit have understood each other and become\r\nunited, and have given us steadfast strength.  Both of them realise\r\nwhat was built up in long years of peace and amid many internal\r\nstruggles.  _This was certainly worth fighting for_,\" the Emperor's\r\norder continued.  \"Brightly before my eyes stand the achievements of\r\nthe entire nation in battle and distress.  The events of this struggle\r\nfor the existence of the empire introduce with high solemnity a new\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"It falls to you as the responsible Chancellor of the German Empire and\r\nFirst Minister of my Government in Prussia to assist in obtaining the\r\nfulfilment of the demands of this hour by right means and at the right\r\ntime, and in this spirit shape our political life in order to make room\r\nfor the free and joyful co-operation of all the members of our people.\r\n\r\n\"The principles which you have developed in this respect have, as you\r\nknow, my approval.\r\n\r\n\"I feel conscious of remaining thereby on the road which my\r\ngrandfather, the founder of the empire, as King of Prussia with\r\nmilitary organisation and as German Emperor with social reform,\r\ntypically fulfilled as his monarchial obligations, thereby creating\r\nconditions by which the German people, in united and wrathful\r\nperseverance, will overcome this sanguinary time.  _The maintenance_ of\r\nthe _fighting force_ as a real people's army and the promotion of the\r\nsocial uplift of the people in all its classes was, from the beginning\r\nof my reign, my aim.\r\n\r\n\"In this endeavour, while holding a just balance between the people and\r\nthe monarchy to serve the welfare of the whole, I am resolved to begin\r\nbuilding up our internal political, economic, and social life as soon\r\nas the war situation permits.\r\n\r\n\"While millions of our fellow-countrymen are in the field, the conflict\r\nof opinions behind the front, which is unavoidable in such a\r\nfar-reaching change of constitution, must be postponed in the highest\r\ninterests of the Fatherland until the time of the homecoming of our\r\nwarriors and when they themselves are able to join in the counsel and\r\nthe voting on the progress of the new order.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was but natural that the Socialists should hail this declaration of\r\nthe Kaiser's at first with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"Internal freedom in Prussia--that is a goal for which for more than\r\none hundred years the best heads and best forces in the nation have\r\nworked.  Resurrection day of the third war year--will go down in\r\nhistory as the day of the resurrection of old Prussia to a new\r\ndevelopment,\" said the _Vorwaerts_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It has brought us a promise, to be sure; not the resurrection itself,\r\nbut a promise which is more hopeful and certain than all former\r\nannouncements together.  This proclamation can never be annulled and\r\nlapse into dusty archives.\r\n\r\n\"This message promises us a thorough reform of the Prussian three class\r\nelectoral system in addition to a reform of the Prussian Upper House.\r\nIn the coming new orientation the Government is only one factor,\r\nanother is Parliament, the third and decisive factor is the people.\"\r\n\r\nOther Berlin newspapers spoke in a similar vein but not one of them\r\npointed out to the public the fact that this concession by the Kaiser\r\nwas not made in such a definite form, _until the United States had\r\ndeclared war_.  As the United States entered the war to aid the\r\ndemocratic movement in Germany this concession by the Kaiser may be\r\nconsidered our first victory.\r\n\r\nAs days go by it becomes more and more evident that the American\r\ndeclaration of war is having an important influence upon internal\r\nconditions in Germany just as the submarine notes had.  The German\r\npeople really did not begin to think during this war until President\r\nWilson challenged them in the notes which followed the torpedoing of\r\nthe _Lusitania_.  And now with the United States at war not only the\r\npeople but the Government have decided to do some thinking.\r\n\r\nBy April 12th when reports began to reach Germany of America's\r\ndetermination to fight until there was a democracy in Germany the\r\ndemocratic press began to give more serious consideration to Americans\r\nalliance with the Allies.  Dr. Ludwig Haas, one of the Socialist\r\nmembers of the Reichstag, in an article in the Berlin _Tageblatt_ made\r\nthe following significant statements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"One man may be a hypocrite, but never a whole nation.  If the American\r\npeople accept this message [President Wilson's address before Congress]\r\nwithout a protest, then a tremendous abyss separates the logic of\r\nGermans from that of other nations.\r\n\r\n\"Woodrow Wilson is not so far wrong if he means the planning of war\r\nmight be prevented if the people asserted the right to know everything\r\nabout the foreign policies of their countries.  But the President seems\r\nblind to the fact that a handful of men have made it their secret and\r\nuncontrolled business to direct the fate of the European democracies.\r\nWith the press at one's command one can easily drive a poor people to a\r\nmania of enthusiasm, when they will carry on their shoulders the\r\ncriminals who have led to the brink of disaster.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE NEW OLD PRESIDENT.  LONG LIVE AMERICA!  LONG LIVE\r\nPEACE!  LONG LIVE THE AMMUNITION FACTORIES!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Haas was beginning to understand that the anti-American campaign in\r\nGermany which the Navy started and the Foreign Office encouraged, had\r\nhad some effect.\r\n\r\nEverything the United States does from now on will have a decisive\r\ninfluence in the world war.  The Allies realise it and Washington knows\r\nit.  Mr. Lloyd-George, the British Prime Minister, realised what a\r\ndecisive effect American ships would have, when he said at the banquet\r\nof the American Luncheon Club in London:\r\n\r\n\"The road to victory, the guaranty of victory, the absolute assurance\r\nof victory, has to be found in one word, 'ships,' and a second word,\r\n'ships,' and a third word, 'ships.'\"\r\n\r\nBut our financial economic and military aid to the Allies will not be\r\nour greatest contribution towards victory.  The influence of President\r\nWilson's utterances, of our determination and of our value as a\r\nfriendly nation after the war will have a tremendous effect as time\r\ngoes on upon the German people.  As days and weeks pass, as the victory\r\nwhich the German Government has promised the people becomes further and\r\nfurther away, the people, who are now doing more thinking than they\r\never have done since the beginning of the war, will some day realise\r\nthat in order to obtain peace, which they pray for and hope for, they\r\nwill have to reform their government _during the war_--not after the\r\nwar as the Kaiser plans.\r\n\r\nMilitary pressure from the outside is going to help this democratic\r\nmovement in Germany succeed in spite of itself.  The New York World\r\neditorial on April 14th, discussing Mr. Lloyd-George's statement that\r\n\"Prussia is not a democracy; Prussia is not a state; Prussia is an\r\narmy,\" said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It was the army and the arrogance actuating it which ordered\r\nhostilities in the first place.  Because there was no democracy in\r\nPrussia, the army had its way.  The democracies of Great Britain and\r\nFrance, like the democracy of the United States, were reluctant to take\r\narms but were forced to it.  Russian democracy found its own\r\ndeliverance on the fighting-line.\r\n\r\n\"In the fact that Prussia is not a democracy or a state but an army we\r\nmay see a reason for many things usually regarded as inexplicable.  It\r\nis Prussia the army which violates treaties.  It is Prussia the army\r\nwhich disregards international law.  It is Prussia the army,\r\nrepresented by the General Staff and the Admiralty, which sets at\r\nnaught the engagements of the Foreign Office.  It is Prussia the army\r\nwhich has filled neutral countries with spies and lawbreakers, which\r\nhas placed frightfulness above humanity, and in a fury of egotism and\r\nsavagery has challenged the world.\r\n\r\n\"Under such a terrorism, as infamous at home as it is abroad, civil\r\ngovernment has perished.  There is no civil government in a Germany\r\ndragooned by Prussia.  There is no law in Germany but military law.\r\nThere is no obligation in Germany except to the army.  It is not\r\nGermany the democracy or Germany the state, it is Germany the army,\r\nthat is to be crushed for its own good no less than for that of\r\ncivilisation.\"\r\n\r\nThe United States entered the war at the psychological and critical\r\nmoment.  We enter it at the moment when our economic and financial\r\nresources, and _our determination_ will have the decisive influence.\r\nWe enter at the moment when every one of our future acts will assist\r\nand help the democratic movement in Germany succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT WILSON\r\n\r\nThe United States entered the war at a time when many Americans\r\nbelieved the Allies were about to win it.  By May 1st, 1917, the\r\nsituation so changed in Europe that it was apparent to observers that\r\nonly by the most stupendous efforts of all the Allies could the German\r\nGovernment be defeated.\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of the war, when Teutonic militarism spread over\r\nEurope, it was like a forest fire.  But two years of fighting have\r\nchecked it--as woodsmen check forest fires--by digging ditches and\r\npreventing the flames from spreading.  Unlimited submarine warfare,\r\nhowever, is something new.  It is militarism spreading to the high seas\r\nand to the shores of neutrals.  It is Ruthlessism--the new German\r\nmenace, which is as real and dangerous for us and for South America as\r\nfor England and the Allies.  If we hold out until Ruthlessism spends\r\nits fury, we will win.  But we must fight and fight desperately to hold\r\nout.\r\n\r\nDr. Kaempf, President of the Reichstag, declared that President Wilson\r\nwould \"bite marble\" before the war was over.  And the success of\r\nsubmarine warfare during April and the first part of May was such as to\r\narouse the whole world to the almost indefinite possibilities of this\r\nmeans of fighting.  The real crisis of the war has not been reached.\r\nWe are approaching it.  The Allies have attempted for two years without\r\nmuch success to curb the U-boat danger.  They have attempted to build\r\nsteel ships, also without success, so that the real burden of winning\r\nthe war in Europe falls upon American shoulders.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the United States we are not making the blunders at the\r\nbeginning of our intervention which some of the European nations have\r\nbeen making since August, 1914.  America is awakened to the needs of\r\nmodern war as no other nation was, thanks to the splendid work which\r\nthe American newspapers and magazines have done during the war to\r\npresent clearly, fairly and accurately not only the great issues but\r\nthe problems of organisation and military tactics.  The people of the\r\nUnited States are better informed about the war as a whole than are the\r\npeople in any European country.  American newspapers have not made the\r\nmistakes which English and French journals made--of hating the enemy so\r\nfuriously as to think that nothing more than criticism and hate were\r\nnecessary to defeat him.  Not until this year could one of Great\r\nBritain's statesmen declare: \"You can damn the Germans until you are\r\nblue in the face, but that will not beat them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nProfessor Charles Gray Shaw, of New York University, stated before one\r\nof his classes in philosophy that there was a new \"will\" typified in\r\ncertain of our citizens, notably in President Wilson.\r\n\r\n\"The new psychology,\" said Professor Shaw, \"has discovered the new\r\nwill--the will that turns inward upon the brain instead of passing out\r\nthrough hand or tongue.  Wilson has this new will; the White House\r\ncorroborates the results of the laboratory.  To Roosevelt, Wilson seems\r\nweak and vacillating; but that is because T. R. knows nothing about the\r\nnew will.  T. R. has a primitive mind, but one of the most advanced\r\ntype.  In the T. R. brain, so to speak, will means set teeth, clenched\r\nfist, hunting, and rough riding.\r\n\r\n\"Wilson may be regarded as either creating the new volition or as\r\nhaving discovered it.  At any rate, Wilson possesses and uses the new\r\nvolition, and it remains to be seen whether the political world, at\r\nhome and abroad, is ready for it.  Here it is significant to observe\r\nthat the Germans, who are psychologists, recognize the fact that a new\r\nand important function of the mind has been focused upon them.\r\n\r\n\"The Germans fear and respect the Wilson will of note writing more than\r\nthey would have dreaded the T. R. will with its teeth and fists.\"\r\n\r\nAs a psychologist Professor Shaw observed what we saw to be the effect\r\nin Germany, of Mr. Wilson's will.\r\n\r\nTHE WILSON WILL\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nThe United States enters the greatest war in history at the\r\npsychological moment with a capable and determined president, a united\r\nnation and almost unlimited resources in men, money and munitions.\r\n\r\nThere is a tremendous difference between the situation in the United\r\nStates and that in any other European country.  During the two years I\r\nwas in Europe I visited every nation at war except Serbia, Bulgaria and\r\nTurkey.  I saw conditions in the neutral countries of Holland, Denmark,\r\nSwitzerland and Spain.  The one big thing which impressed me upon my\r\narrival in New York was that the United States, in contrast to all\r\nthese countries, has, as yet, not been touched by the war.  Americans\r\nare not living under the strain and worry which hang like dreadful dull\r\nclouds over every European power.  In Switzerland the economic worries\r\nand the sufferings of the neighbouring belligerents have made the Swiss\r\npeople feel that they are in the centre of the war itself.  In France,\r\nalthough Paris is gay, although people smile (they have almost\r\nforgotten how to smile in Germany), although streets are crowded, and\r\nstores busy, the atmosphere is earnest and serious.  Spain is torn by\r\ninternal troubles.  There is a great army of unemployed.  The submarine\r\nwar has destroyed many Spanish ships and interrupted Spanish trade with\r\nbelligerents.  Business houses are unable to obtain credit.  German\r\npropaganda is sowing sedition and the King himself is uncertain about\r\nthe future.  But in the United States there is a gigantic display of\r\nenergy and potential power which makes this country appear to possess\r\nsufficient force in itself to defeat Germany.  Berlin is drained and\r\ndead in comparison.  Paris, while busy, is war-busy and every one and\r\neverything seems to move and live because of the war.  In New York and\r\nthroughout the country there are young men by the hundreds of\r\nthousands.  Germany and France have no young men outside the armies.\r\nHere there are millions of automobiles and millions of people hurrying,\r\nhappy and contented, to and from their work.  In Germany there are no\r\nautomobiles which are not in the service of the Government and rubber\r\ntires are so nearly exhausted that practically all automobiles have\r\niron wheels.\r\n\r\nSome Americans have lived for many years with the idea that only\r\ncertain sections of the United States were related to Europe.  Many\r\npeople, especially those in the Middle West, have had the impression\r\nthat only the big shipping interests and exporters had direct interests\r\nin affairs across the ocean.  But when Germany began to take American\r\nlives on the high seas, when German submarines began to treat American\r\nships like all other belligerent vessels, it began to dawn upon people\r\nhere that this country was very closely connected to Europe by blood\r\nties as well as by business bonds.  It has taken the United States two\r\nyears to learn that Europe was not, after all, three thousand miles\r\naway when it came to the vital moral issues of live international\r\npolicies.  Before Congress declared war I found many Americans\r\ncriticising President Wilson for not declaring war two years ago.\r\nWhile I do not know what the situation was during my absence still the\r\nimpression which Americans abroad had, even American officials, was\r\nthat President Wilson would not have had the support of a united people\r\nwhich he has to-day had he entered the war before all question of doubt\r\nregarding the moral issues had disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AUTHOR'S CARD OF ADMISSION TO THE REICHSTAG ON APRIL\r\n5TH, 1916.]\r\n\r\nIn the issue of April 14th of this year the _New Republic_, of New\r\nYork, in an editorial on \"Who willed American participation?\" cast an\r\ninteresting light upon the reasons for our intervention in the Great\r\nWar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Pacifist agitators who have been so courageously opposing, against\r\nsuch heavy odds, American participation in the war have been the\r\nvictims of one natural but considerable mistake,\" says _The New\r\nRepublic_.  \"They have insisted that the chief beneficiaries of\r\nAmerican participation would be the munition-makers, bankers and in\r\ngeneral the capitalist class, that the chief sufferers would be the\r\npetty business men and the wage-earners.  They have consequently\r\nconsidered the former classes to be conspiring in favour of war, and\r\nnow that war has come, they condemn it as the work of a small but\r\npowerful group of profiteers.  Senator Norris had some such meaning in\r\nhis head when he asserted that a declaration of war would be equivalent\r\nto stamping the dollar mark on the American flag.\r\n\r\n\"This explanation of the great decision is an absurd mistake, but the\r\npacifists have had some excuses for making it.  They have seen a great\r\ndemocratic nation gradually forced into war, in spite of the manifest\r\nindifference or reluctance of the majority of its population; and they\r\nhave rightly attributed the successful pressure to the ability of a\r\nsmall but influential minority to impose its will on the rest of the\r\ncountry.  But the numerically insignificant class whose influence has\r\nbeen successfully exerted in favour of American participation does not\r\nconsist of the bankers and the capitalists.  Neither will they be the\r\nchief beneficiaries of American participation.  The bankers and the\r\ncapitalists have favoured war, but they have favoured it without\r\nrealising the extent to which it would injure their own interests, and\r\ntheir support has been one of the most formidable political obstacles\r\nto American participation.  The effective and decisive work on behalf\r\nof war has been accomplished by an entirely different class--a class\r\nwhich must be comprehensively but loosely described as the\r\n'intellectuals.'\r\n\r\n\"The American nation is entering this war under the influence of a\r\nmoral verdict reached, after the utmost deliberation by the more\r\nthoughtful members of the community.  They gradually came to a decision\r\nthat the attack made by Germany on the international order was\r\nsufficiently flagrant and dangerous to justify this country in\r\nabandoning its cherished isolation and in using its resources to bring\r\nabout German defeat.  But these thoughtful people were always a small\r\nminority.  They were able to impose their will upon a reluctant or\r\nindifferent majority partly because the increasingly offensive nature\r\nof German military and diplomatic policy made plausible opposition to\r\nAmerican participation very difficult, but still more because of the\r\noverwhelming preponderance of pro-Ally conviction in the intellectual\r\nlife of the country.  If the several important professional and social\r\ngroups could have voted separately on the question of war and peace,\r\nthe list of college professors would probably have yielded the largest\r\nmajority in favour of war, except perhaps that contained in the Social\r\nRegister.  A fighting anti-German spirit was more general among\r\nphysicians, lawyers and clergymen than it was among business\r\nmen--except those with Wall Street and banking connections.  Finally,\r\nit was not less general among writers on magazines and in the\r\nnewspapers.  They popularised what the college professors had been\r\nthinking.  Owing to this consensus of influences opposition to pro-Ally\r\northodoxy became intellectually somewhat disreputable, and when a final\r\ndecision had to be made this factor counted with unprecedented and\r\noverwhelming force.  College professors headed by a President who had\r\nhimself been a college professor contributed more effectively to the\r\ndecision in favour of war than did the farmers, the business men or the\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\n\"When one considers the obstacles to American entrance into the war,\r\nthe more remarkable and unprecedented does the final decision become.\r\nEvery other belligerent had something immediate and tangible to gain by\r\nparticipating and to lose by not participating.  Either they were\r\ninvaded or were threatened with invasion.  Either they dreaded the loss\r\nof prestige or territory or coveted some kind or degree of national\r\naggrandisement.  Even Australia and Canada, who had little or nothing\r\nto gain from fighting, could not have refused to fight without severing\r\ntheir connection with the British Empire, and behaving in a manner\r\nwhich would have been considered treacherous by their fellow Britons.\r\nBut the American people were not forced into the war either by fears or\r\nhopes or previously recognised obligations.  On the contrary, the\r\nponderable and tangible realities of the immediate situation counselled\r\nneutrality.  They were revolted by the hideous brutality of the war and\r\nits colossal waste.  Participation must be purchased with a similarly\r\ncolossal diversion of American energy from constructive to destructive\r\nwork, the imposition of a similarly heavy burden upon the future\r\nproduction of American labour.  It implied the voluntary surrender of\r\nmany of those advantages which had tempted our ancestors to cross the\r\nAtlantic and settle in the New World.  As against these certain costs\r\nthere were no equally tangible compensations.  The legal rights of\r\nAmerican citizens were, it is true, being violated, and the structure\r\nof international law with which American security was traditionally\r\nassociated was being shivered, but the nation had weathered a similar\r\nstorm during the Napoleonic Wars and at that time participation in the\r\nconflict had been wholly unprofitable.  By spending a small portion of\r\nthe money which will have to be spent in helping the Allies to beat\r\nGermany, upon preparations exclusively for defence, the American nation\r\ncould have protected for the time being the inviolability of its own\r\nterritory and its necessary communications with the Panama Canal.  Many\r\nconsiderations of national egotism counselled such a policy.  But\r\nalthough the Hearst newspapers argued most persuasively on behalf of\r\nthis course it did not prevail.  The American nation allowed itself to\r\nbe captured by those upon whom the more remote and less tangible\r\nreasons for participation acted with compelling authority.  For the\r\nfirst time in history a wholly independent nation has entered a great\r\nand costly war under the influence of ideas rather than immediate\r\ninterests and without any expectation of gains, except those which can\r\nbe shared with all liberal and inoffensive nations.\r\n\r\n\"The United States might have blundered into the war at any time during\r\nthe past two years, but to have entered, as it is now doing, at the\r\nright time and in the clear interest of a purely international\r\nprogramme required the exercise of an intellectualised and imaginative\r\nleadership.  And in supplying the country with this leadership Mr.\r\nWilson was interpreting the ideas of thoughtful Americans who wished\r\ntheir country to be fighting on the side of international right, but\r\nnot until the righteousness of the Allied cause was unequivocally\r\nestablished.  It has taken some time to reach this assurance.  The war\r\noriginated in conflicting national ambitions among European Powers for\r\nprivileged economic and political positions in Africa and Asia, and if\r\nit had continued to be a war of this kind there never could have been a\r\nquestion of American intervention.  Germany, however, had been dreaming\r\nof a more glorious goal than Bagdad and a mightier heritage than that\r\nof Turkey.  She betrayed her dream by attacking France through Belgium\r\nand by threatening the foundations of European order.  The crucifying\r\nof Belgium established a strong presumption against Germany, but the\r\ncase was not complete.  There still remained the dubious origin of the\r\nwar.  There still remained a doubt whether the defeat of German\r\nmilitarism might not mean a dangerous triumph of Russian autocracy.\r\nAbove all there remained a more serious doubt whether the United States\r\nin aiding the Allies to beat Germany might not be contributing merely\r\nto the establishment of a new and equally unstable and demoralising\r\nBalance of Power in Europe.  It was well, consequently, to wait and see\r\nwhether the development of the war would not do away with some of the\r\nambiguities and misgivings, while at the same time to avoid doing\r\nanything to embarrass the Allies.  The waiting policy has served.\r\nGermany was driven by the logic of her original aggression to threaten\r\nthe security of all neutrals connected with the rest of the world by\r\nmaritime communications.  The Russian autocracy was overthrown, because\r\nit betrayed its furtive kinship with the German autocracy.  Finally,\r\nPresident Wilson used the waiting period for the education of American\r\npublic opinion.  His campaign speeches prophesied the abandonment of\r\nAmerican isolation in the interest of a League of Peace.  His note of\r\nlast December to the belligerents brought out the sinister secrecy of\r\nGerman peace terms and the comparative frankness of that of the Allies.\r\nHis address to the Senate clearly enunciated the only programme on\r\nbehalf of which America could intervene in European affairs.  Never was\r\nthere a purer and more successful example of Fabian political strategy,\r\nfor Fabianism consists not merely in waiting but in preparing during\r\nthe meantime for the successful application of a plan to a confused and\r\ndangerous situation.\r\n\r\n\"What Mr. Wilson did was to apply patience and brains to a complicated\r\nand difficult but developing political situation.  He was distinguished\r\nfrom his morally indignant pro-Allies fellow countrymen, who a few\r\nmonths ago were abusing him for seeking to make a specifically American\r\ncontribution to the issues of the war, just as Lincoln was\r\ndistinguished from the abolitionists, not so much by difference in\r\npurposes as by greater political wisdom and intelligence.  It is\r\nbecause of his Fabianism, because he insisted upon waiting until he had\r\nestablished a clear connection between American intervention and an\r\nattempt to create a community of nations, that he can command and\r\nsecure for American intervention the full allegiance of the American\r\nnational conscience.  His achievement is a great personal triumph, but\r\nit is more than that.  It is an illustration and a prophecy of the part\r\nwhich intelligence and in general the 'intellectual' class have an\r\nopportunity of playing in shaping American policy and in moulding\r\nAmerican life.  The intimate association between action and ideas,\r\ncharacteristic of American political practice at its best, has been\r\nvindicated once more.  The association was started at the foundation of\r\nthe Republic and was embodied in the work of the Fathers, but\r\nparticularly in that of Hamilton.  It was carried on during the period\r\nof the Civil War and was embodied chiefly in the patient and\r\npenetrating intelligence which Abraham Lincoln brought to his task.  It\r\nhas just been established in the region of foreign policy by Mr.\r\nWilson's discriminating effort to keep the United States out of the war\r\nuntil it could go in as the instrument of an exclusively international\r\nprogramme and with a fair prospect of getting its programme accepted.\r\nIn holding to this policy Mr. Wilson was interpreting with fidelity and\r\nimagination the ideas and the aspirations of the more thoughtful\r\nAmericans.  His success should give them increasing confidence in the\r\ncontribution which they as men of intelligence are capable of making to\r\nthe fulfilment of the better American national purposes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring 1915 and 1916 our diplomatic relations with Germany have been\r\nexpressed in one series of notes after another, and the burden of\r\naffairs has been as much on the shoulders of Ambassador Gerard as on\r\nthose of any other one American, for he has been the official who has\r\nhad to transmit, interpret and fight for our policies in Berlin.  Mr.\r\nGerard had a difficult task because he, like President Wilson, was\r\nconstantly heckled and ridiculed by those pro-German Americans who were\r\nmore interested in discrediting the Administration than in maintaining\r\npeace.  Of all the problems with which the Ambassador had to contend,\r\nthe German-American issue was the greatest, and those who believed that\r\nit was centred in the United States are mistaken, for the capital of\r\nGerman-America was _Berlin_.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a great deal of trouble in Germany from the American\r\ncorrespondents when they went there,\" said Ambassador Gerard in an\r\naddress to the American Newspapers Publishers Association in New York\r\non April 26th.\r\n\r\n\"Most of them became super-Ambassadors and proceeded to inform the\r\nGerman Government that they must not believe me--that they must not\r\nbelieve the President--they must not believe the American people--but\r\nbelieve these people, and to a great extent this war is due to the fact\r\nthat these pro-German Americans, a certain number of them, misinformed\r\nthe German Government as to the sentiments of this country.\"\r\n\r\nJames W. Gerard's diplomatic career in Germany was based upon\r\nbluntness, frankness and a kind of \"news instinct\" which caused him to\r\nregard his position as that of a reporter for the United States\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nBerlin thought him the most unusual Ambassador it had ever known.  It\r\nnever knew how to take him.  He did not behave as other diplomats did.\r\nWhen he went to the Foreign Office it was always on business.  He did\r\nnot flatter and praise, bow and chat or speak to Excellencies in the\r\nthird person as European representatives usually do.  Gerard began at\r\nthe beginning of the war a policy of keeping the United States fully\r\ninformed regarding Germany.  He used to report daily the political\r\ndevelopments and the press comment, and the keen understanding which he\r\nhad of German methods was proved by his many forecasts of important\r\ndevelopments.  Last September he predicted, in a message to the State\r\nDepartment, ruthless submarine warfare before Spring unless peace was\r\nmade.  He notified Washington last October to watch for German intrigue\r\nin Mexico and said that unless we solved the problem there we might\r\nhave trouble throughout the war from Germans south of the Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMBASSADOR GERARD ARRIVING IN PARIS]\r\n\r\nDuring the submarine controversies, when reports reached Berlin that\r\nthe United States was divided and would not support President Wilson in\r\nhis submarine policy, Ambassador Gerard did everything he could to give\r\nthe opposite impression.  He tried his best to keep Germany from\r\ndriving the United States into the war.  That he did not succeed was\r\nnot the fault of _his_ efforts.  Germany was desperate and willing to\r\ndisregard all nations and all international obligations in an attempt\r\nto win the war with U-boats.\r\n\r\nLast Summer, during one of the crises over the sinking of a passenger\r\nliner without warning, Mr. Gerard asked the Chancellor for an audience\r\nwith the Kaiser.  Von Bethmann-Hollweg said he would see if it could be\r\narranged.  The Ambassador waited two weeks.  Nothing was done.  From\r\nhis friends in Berlin he learned that the Navy was opposed to such a\r\nconference and would not give its consent.  Mr. Gerard went to Herr von\r\nJagow who was then Secretary of State and again asked for an audience.\r\nHe waited another week.  Nothing happened and Mr. Gerard wrote the\r\nfollowing note to the Chancellor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your Excellency,\r\n\r\n\"Three weeks ago I asked for an audience with His Majesty the Kaiser.\r\n\r\n\"A week ago I repeated the request.\r\n\r\n\"Please do not trouble yourself further.\r\n\r\n\"Respectfully,\r\n\r\n\"JAMES W. GERARD.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador called the Embassy messenger and sent the note to the\r\nChancellor's palace.  Three hours later he was told that von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg had gone to Great Headquarters to arrange for the\r\nmeeting.\r\n\r\nSometimes in dealing with the Foreign Office the Ambassador used the\r\nsame rough-shod methods which made the Big Stick effective during the\r\nRoosevelt Administration.  At one time, Alexander Cochran, of New York,\r\nacted as special courier from the Embassy in London to Berlin.  At the\r\nfrontier he was arrested and imprisoned.  The Ambassador heard of it,\r\nwent to the Foreign Office and demanded Cochran's immediate release.\r\nThe Ambassador had obtained Mr. Cochran's passports, and showed them to\r\nthe Secretary of State.  When Herr von Jagow asked permission to retain\r\none of the passports so the matter could be investigated, the\r\nAmbassador said:\r\n\r\n\"All right, but first let me tear Lansing's signature off the bottom,\r\nor some one may use the passport for other purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ambassador was not willing to take chances after it was learned and\r\nproved by the State Department that Germany was using American\r\npassports for spy purposes.\r\n\r\nIn one day alone, last fall, the American Embassy sent 92 notes to the\r\nForeign Office, some authorised by Washington and some unauthorised,\r\nprotesting against unlawful treatment of Americans, asking for reforms\r\nin prison camps, transmitting money and letters about German affairs in\r\nEntente countries, and other matters which were under discussion\r\nbetween Berlin and Washington.  At one time an American woman\r\ninstructor in Roberts' College was arrested at Warnemuende and kept for\r\nweeks from communicating with the Ambassador.  When he heard of it he\r\nwent to the Foreign Office daily, demanding her release, which he\r\nfinally secured.\r\n\r\nMr. Gerard's work in bettering conditions in prison camps, especially\r\nat Ruhleben, will be long remembered.  When conditions were at their\r\nworst he went out daily to keep himself informed, and then daily went\r\nto the Foreign Office or wrote to the Ministry of War in an effort to\r\nget better accommodations for the men.  One day he discovered eleven\r\nprominent English civilians, former respected residents in Berlin,\r\nliving in a box stall similar to one which his riding horse had\r\noccupied in peace times.  This so aroused the Ambassador that he\r\nvolunteered to furnish funds for the construction of a new barracks in\r\ncase the Government was not willing to do it.  But the Foreign Office\r\nand the War Ministry and other officials shifted authority so often\r\nthat it was impossible to get changes made.  The Ambassador decided to\r\nhave his reports published in a drastic effort to gain relief for the\r\nprisoners.  The State Department granted the necessary authority and\r\nhis descriptions of Ruhleben were published in the United States and\r\nEngland, arousing such a world-wide storm of indignation that the\r\nGerman Government changed the prison conditions and made Ruhleben fit\r\nfor men for the first time since the beginning of the war.\r\n\r\nThis activity of the Ambassador aroused a great deal of bitterness and\r\nthe Government decided to try to have him recalled.  The press\r\ncensorship instigated various newspapers to attack the Ambassador so\r\nthat Germany might be justified in asking for his recall, but the\r\nattack failed for the simple reason that there was no evidence against\r\nthe Ambassador except that he had been too vigorous in insisting upon\r\nlivable prison camp conditions.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nI have pointed out in previous chapters some of the things which\r\nPresident Wilson's notes accomplished in Germany during the war.\r\nSuppose the Kaiser were to grant certain reforms, would this destroy\r\nthe possibilities of a free Germany, a democratic nation--a German\r\nRepublic!\r\n\r\nThe German people were given an opportunity to debate and think about\r\ninternational issues while we maintained relations with Berlin, but as\r\nI pointed out, the Kaiser and his associates are masters of German\r\npsychology and during the next few months they may temporarily undo\r\nwhat we accomplished during two years.  Americans must remember that at\r\nthe present time all the leading men of Germany are preaching to the\r\npeople the gospel of submarine success, and the anti-American campaign\r\nthere is being conducted unhindered and unchallenged.  The United\r\nStates and the Allies have pledged their national honour and existence\r\nto defeat and discredit the Imperial German Government and nothing but\r\nunfaltering determination, no matter what the Kaiser does, will bring\r\nsuccess.  Unless he is defeated, the Kaiser will not follow the Czar's\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nIn May of this year the German Government believed it was winning the\r\nwar.  Berlin believed it would decisively defeat our Allies before\r\nFall.  But even if the people of Germany again compel their Government\r\nto propose peace and the Kaiser announces that he is in favour of such\r\ndrastic reforms as making his Ministry responsible to the Reichstag,\r\nthis (though it might please the German people) cannot, must not,\r\nsatisfy us.  Only a firm refusal of the Allies will accomplish what we\r\nhave set out to do--overthrow the present rulers and dictators of\r\nGermany.  This must include not only the Kaiser but Field Marshal von\r\nHindenburg and the generals in control of the army, the Chancellor von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg, who did not keep his promises to the United States\r\nand the naval leaders who have been intriguing and fighting for war\r\nwith America for over two years.  Only a decisive defeat of Germany\r\nwill make Germany a republic, and the task is stupendous enough to\r\nchallenge the best combined efforts of the United States and all the\r\nAllies.\r\n\r\nProphecy is a dangerous pastime but it would not be fair to conclude\r\nthis book without pointing out some of the possibilities which can\r\ndevelop from the policy which President Wilson pursued in dealing with\r\nGermany before diplomatic relations were broken.\r\n\r\nThe chief effect of Mr. Wilson's policy is not going to be felt during\r\nthis war, but in the future.  At the beginning of his administration he\r\nemphasised the fact that in a democracy public opinion was a bigger\r\nfactor than armies and navies.  If all Europe emerges from this war as\r\ndemocratic as seems possible now one can see that Mr. Wilson has\r\nalready laid the foundation for future international relations between\r\nfree people and republican forms of governments.  This war has defeated\r\nitself.  It is doubtful whether there ever will be another world war\r\nbecause the opinion of all civilised people is mobilised against war.\r\nAfter one has seen what war is like, one is against not only war itself\r\nbut the things which bring about war.  This great war was made possible\r\nbecause Europe has been expecting and preparing for it ever since 1870\r\nand because the governments of Europe did not take either the people or\r\ntheir neighbours into their confidence.  President Wilson tried to show\r\nwhile he was president that the people should be fully informed\r\nregarding all steps taken by the Government.  In England where the\r\npress has had such a tussle to keep from being curbed by an autocratic\r\ncensorship the world has learned new lessons in publicity.  The old\r\npolicy of keeping from the public unpleasant information has been\r\nthrown overboard in Great Britain because it was found that it harmed\r\nthe very foundations of democracy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A POST-CARD FROM GENERAL VON KLUCK.]\r\n\r\nInternational relations in the future will, to a great extent, be\r\nmoulded along the lines of Mr. Wilson's policies during this war.\r\nDiplomacy will be based upon a full discussion of all international\r\nissues.  The object of diplomacy will be to reach an understanding to\r\n_prevent_ wars, not to _avoid_ them at the eleventh hour.  Just as\r\nenlightened society tries to _prevent_ murder so will civilised nations\r\nin the future try to prevent wars.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson expressed his faith in this new development in international\r\naffairs by saying that \"the opinion of the world is the mistress of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\nThe important concern to-day is: How can this world opinion be moulded\r\ninto a world power?\r\n\r\nOpinion cannot be codified like law because it is often the vanguard of\r\nlegislation.  Public opinion is the reaction of a thousand and one\r\nincidents upon the public consciousness.  In the world to-day the most\r\nimportant influence in the development of opinion is the daily press.\r\nBy a judicious interpretation of affairs the President of the United\r\nStates frequently may direct public opinion in certain channels while\r\nhis representatives to foreign governments, especially when there is\r\nopportunity, as there is to-day, may help spread our ideas abroad.\r\n\r\nWorld political leaders, if one may judge from events so far, foresee a\r\nnew era in international affairs.  Instead of a nation's foreign\r\npolicies being secret, instead of unpublished alliances and iron-bound\r\ntreaties, there may be the proclaiming of a nation's international\r\nintentions, exactly as a political party in the United States pledges\r\nits intentions in a political campaign.  Parties in Europe may demand a\r\nstatement of the foreign intentions of their governments.  If there was\r\nthis candidness between the governments and their citizens there would\r\nhe more frankness between the nations and their neighbours.  Public\r\nopinion would then be the decisive force.  International steps of all\r\nnations would then be decided upon only after the public was thoroughly\r\nacquainted with their every phase.  A fully informed nation would be\r\nconsidered safer and more peace-secure than a nation whose opinion was\r\nbased upon coloured official reports, \"Ems\" telegrams of 1870 and 1914\r\nvariety, and eleventh-hour appeals to passion, fear and God.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the world may then be a stronger international force\r\nthan large individual armies and navies.  The opinion of the world may\r\nbe such a force that every nation will respect and fear it.  The\r\nopinion of the world may be the mistress of the world and publicity\r\nwill be the new driving force in diplomacy to give opinion world power.\r\n\r\nGermany's defeat will be the greatest event in history because it will\r\nestablish world democracy upon a firm foundation and because Germany\r\nitself will emerge democratic.  The Chancellor has frequently stated\r\nthat the Germany which would come out of this war would be nothing like\r\nthe Germany which went into the war and the Kaiser has already promised\r\na \"people's kingdom of Hohenzollern.\"  The Kaiser's government will be\r\nreformed because world opinion insists upon it.  If the German people\r\ndo not yet see this, they will be outlawed until they are free.  They\r\nwill see it eventually, and when that day comes, peace will dawn in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cornell University,\r\n    Ithaca, N.  Y.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nReturning to Ithaca, I find your letter with its question relating to\r\nthe temporary arrest of a vessel carrying munitions of war to Spain\r\nshortly after the beginning of our war with that country.  The simple\r\nfacts are as follows: Receiving a message by wire from our American\r\nConsul at Hamburg early during the war, to the effect that a Spanish\r\nvessel supposed to carry munitions for Spain was just leaving Germany,\r\nI asked the Foreign Office that the vessel be searched before leaving,\r\nmy purpose being not only to get such incidental information as\r\npossible regarding the contraband concerned, but particulars as to the\r\nnature of the vessel, whether it was so fitted that it could be used\r\nwith advantage by our adversaries against our merchant navy, as had\r\nhappened during our Civil War, when Great Britain let out of her ports\r\nvessels fitted to prey upon our merchant ships.\r\n\r\nThe German Government was very courteous to us in the matter and it was\r\nfound that the Spanish ship concerned was not so fitted up and that the\r\ncontraband was of a very ordinary sort, such as could be obtained from\r\nvarious nations.  The result was that the vessel, after a brief visit,\r\nproceeded on her way, and our agents at Hamburg informed me later that\r\nduring the entire war vessels freely carried ammunition from German\r\nports both to Spain and to the United States, and that neither of the\r\nbelligerents made any remonstrance.  Of course, I was aware that under\r\nthe usages of nations I had, strictly speaking, no right to demand\r\nseizure of the contraband concerned, but it seemed my duty at least to\r\nsecure the above information regarding it and the ship which carried it.\r\n\r\nI remain, dear sir,\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\n    (_Signed_) ANDREW D. WHITE.",
