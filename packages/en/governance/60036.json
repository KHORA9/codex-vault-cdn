We were then holding our breath as\r\nwe looked on, after the disasters of Cambrai and St. Quentin, upon the\r\nBritish troops still fighting desperately against superior numbers and\r\ndefending the Channel Ports \"with their backs to the wall\" and barely\r\nleft with room to manœuvre. The enemy was at the same time seriously\r\nthreatening Amiens and Epernay, and the possible withdrawal of the\r\nFrench Government from Paris was being again discussed. It was a trying\r\nfour months on both sides of the Channel. But England and France never\r\ndespaired of the future. Both nations were determined to fight on to\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\nIn July came the second great victory of the Marne, followed by the\r\nwonderful triumphant advance of the Allied Armies all along the line,\r\nside by side with our brethren of the United States, who were pouring\r\ninto France at the rate of 300,000 men a month. And now I finish when\r\nthe all-important matter of discussion is what shall be the terms of\r\npermanent peace imposed upon Germany, what shall be the punishment\r\ninflicted upon her and, so far as is possible, the compensation exacted\r\nfrom her for her unforgivable crimes against our common humanity. The\r\ntransformation scene of the huge world war within four months has been\r\none of the most astounding episodes in the history of mankind, and the\r\ntremendous struggle on the West Front has proved, as it was bound to\r\nprove from the first, the crisis of the whole conflict.\r\n\r\nThroughout the terrible period from November, 1917, when for the\r\nsecond time in his long political career he took office as Premier\r\nof the French Republic, Georges Clemenceau has borne the full burden\r\nof political responsibility in his war-worn and devastated country.\r\nIt has been no light task for any man, especially for one within\r\neasy hail of eighty years of age. When he became President of Council\r\nand Minister of War the prospect of anything approaching to complete\r\nsuccess seemed remote indeed. It was a thankless post he assumed, and\r\nneither friends nor enemies believed at first that physically, mentally\r\nor politically could he bear the strain and overcome the intrigues\r\nwhich were at once set on foot against him. But those who had the\r\nadvantage of knowing Clemenceau well took a much more hopeful view of\r\nhis chances of remaining Prime Minister until the close of the war.\r\nHis mind as well as his body has been in strict training all his life.\r\nThe one is as alert and as vigorous as the other. In the course of his\r\nstirring career his lightness of heart and gaiety of spirit, his power\r\nof taking the most discouraging events as part of the day's work, have\r\ncarried him triumphantly through many a difficulty. Personally, I felt\r\nconfident that nothing short of unforeseen disease, or a bomb from the\r\nforeign or domestic enemy, would bring him down before he had done his\r\nwork. For below his exterior vigour and his brilliancy of conversation\r\nhe possesses the most relentless determination that ever inspired a\r\nhuman being. Moreover, a Frenchman may be witty and light-hearted and\r\nvery wise at the same time. The world of the Middle Ages found that out.\r\n\r\nI read, therefore, with some amusement in Mrs. Humphry Ward's recent\r\nbook of Victorian Recollections that, having met Clemenceau at dinner,\r\nin the 'eighties, she came to the conclusion that he was \"too light a\r\nweight to ride such a horse as the French democracy.\" A very natural\r\nmistake, no doubt, for one of us staid and solemn Victorians to make,\r\naccording to the young cynics and jesters of to-day who gird at us!\r\nIt is precisely this inexhaustible fund of animal spirits and his\r\nnever-failing cheerfulness and brilliancy which have given Clemenceau\r\nthe power over France which he possesses to-day. Frenchmen have felt\r\nthe more assured confidence in themselves and their future when they\r\nsaw, day after day, their own representative and ruler full of go and\r\nof belief in himself at the time when the issue for them all was\r\nhanging in the balance. No real leader of men can ever afford to be a\r\npessimist. He must assume a certitude if he have it not. There was no\r\nneed for Clemenceau to assume anything. It was all there.\r\n\r\nI have known this great Frenchman at many critical stages in his\r\nexciting life. What I most admire about him, is that he is always the\r\nsame man, no matter what his personal position at the moment may be.\r\nNever excessively elated: never by any chance cast down. Good or bad\r\nfortune, success or failure, made no difference to him. The motto of\r\nthe Tenth Legion might well be taken as his own. \"_Utrinque paratus_\"\r\nhas been the watchword of this indefatigable and undaunted political\r\nwarrior throughout. It is well to recall, also, that he has invariably\r\ntold his country the full truth about the situation as it appeared\r\nto him at the time, alike in opposition and in office, as deputy, as\r\nsenator, and as journalist at large.\r\n\r\nBeginning his political career as the intimate friend and almost pupil\r\nof the out-and-out Radical Republican, Etienne Arago, a sympathiser\r\nwith the nobler men of the Commune, whom he endeavoured to save from\r\nthe ruthless vengeance of the reactionaries headed by Thiers, he had\r\npreviously voted at Bordeaux in the minority of genuine Republicans\r\nwho were in favour of continuing the war against Germany when all but\r\nenthusiastic patriots held that further resistance was hopeless. Many a\r\ntime of late those events of _l'Année Terrible_ must have come back to\r\nhis mind during these still more terrible four years. His attitude now\r\nis but the continuation and fulfilment of the policy he advocated then.\r\nThereupon, five years devoted to service on the Municipal Council of\r\nParis and to gratuitous ministrations as a doctor to the poor of one of\r\nthe poorest districts of the French metropolis: a continuous endeavour\r\nto realise, in some degree, by political action, the practical ends\r\nfor which the Communards had so unfortunately and injudiciously\r\nstriven. Then political work again on the floor of the Assembly at one\r\nof the most stirring periods of French history: supporting Gambetta\r\nvigorously in his fight as the head of the Republican Party against\r\nthe dangerous reactionism of the Duc de Broglie and Marshal MacMahon,\r\nand opposing and denouncing the fiery orator whom he succeeded as\r\nthe leader of the Left, when that statesman adopted trimming and\r\nopportunism as his political creed.\r\n\r\nThe long fight against colonisation by conquest, the exposure of\r\nshameless traffic in decorations, the support and overthrow of\r\nBoulanger, the Panama scandal, the denunciation of the alliance with\r\ndespotic Russia, the advocacy of a close understanding with England.\r\nIn each and all of these matters Clemenceau was well to the front.\r\nThen came the crash of exclusion from political life, due to the many\r\nenemies he had made by his inconvenient honesty and bitter tongue\r\nand pen. Once more, after the display of almost unequalled skill and\r\ncourage as a journalist, exceptionally manifested in the championship\r\nof Dreyfus, a return to political life and unexpected acceptance of\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nFrom first to last Clemenceau has been a stalwart Republican and a\r\nthoroughgoing democratic politician of the advanced Left, with strong\r\ntendencies to Socialism. These tendencies I begged him more than once\r\nto turn into actual realities and to join, or at least to act in\r\ncomplete harmony with, the Socialists. This seemed possible towards\r\nthe close of the Dreyfus affair. But I must admit here that, much as\r\nI regret that Socialism has never enjoyed the full advantage of his\r\nservices, Clemenceau, as an avowed member of the Socialist Party, could\r\nnot have played the glorious part for France as a whole which he has\r\nplayed since the beginning of the war. It was far more important, at\r\nsuch a desperate crisis, to carry with him the overwhelming majority of\r\nhis countrymen, including even the reactionaries, than to act with a\r\nminority that has shown itself at variance with the real sentiments of\r\nthe Republic, when France was fighting for her existence.\r\n\r\nThat Clemenceau has, at one time or another, made great mistakes is\r\nbeyond dispute. It could not be otherwise with a man of his character\r\nand temperament. But this, as he himself truly writes me, is \"all of\r\nthe past.\" At no moment, in any case, has he ever failed to do his best\r\nfor the greatness, the glory, the dignity of France as they presented\r\nthemselves to his mind. This is incontestable. In the following pages\r\nI have endeavoured not to write a biography of the statesman who has\r\nbeen constantly in public life for more than fifty years, but to give\r\na study of the growth of a commanding personality, who is an honour to\r\nhis country, and of the surroundings in which his great faculties were\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page of letter]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page of letter]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: page of letter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             [Translation]\r\n\r\n\r\n Le Président du Conseil, Ministere de la Guerre. Paris, July 1st, 1918.\r\n\r\n Dear Mr. Hyndman,\r\n\r\n I can really only thank you for your too flattering letter, inspired\r\n by our old friendship. I have nothing to say about myself, except\r\n that I am doing my best, with the feeling that it will never be\r\n enough. France is making incredible sacrifices every day. No effort\r\n will be considered too high a price to ensure the triumph of a nobler\r\n humanity. Success is certain when all free peoples are in array\r\n against the last convulsions of savagery.\r\n\r\n In so vast a drama, my dear friend, my personality does not count.\r\n Whether I was right or wrong at this time or that interests me no\r\n longer, since it all belongs to the past. I have kept nothing of what\r\n I have said or written. It is impossible for me to furnish you with\r\n details or to mention anyone who would be able to do so. I can but\r\n express to you my gratitude for your friendly intention. I desire only\r\n to witness the day of the great victory, then I shall be rewarded far\r\n beyond my merits, especially if you add thereto the continuance of\r\n your fraternal feelings towards myself.\r\n\r\n                      Very affectionately yours,\r\n\r\n                                                         G. CLEMENCEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\n [_This letter was written seventeen days before the commencement of\r\n the great Franco-British offensive._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n                              EARLY LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are all accustomed to think of La Vendée as that Province of France\r\nwhich is most deeply imbued with tradition, legend and religion. Even\r\nin this period of almost universal scepticism and free thought, the\r\npeasants of La Vendée keep tight hold of their ancient ideas, in which\r\nthe pagan superstitions of long ago are curiously interwoven with the\r\nfading Catholicism of to-day. Nowhere in France are the ceremonies of\r\nthe Church more devoutly observed; nowhere, in spite of the spread\r\nof modern education, are the people as a whole more attached to the\r\ncreed of their forefathers. Here whole crowds of genuine believers can\r\nstill display that fervour of religious enthusiasm which moved masses\r\nof their countrymen to such heroic self-sacrifice for a losing and\r\nhopeless cause more than four generations since. Even men who have\r\nlittle sympathy with either theological or social conventions of the\r\npast are stirred by the simple piety of these people, uplifted for the\r\nmoment out of the sordid and monotonous surroundings of their daily\r\ntoil by the collective inspiration of a common faith.\r\n\r\nHere, too, in the Bocage of La Vendée amid the heather and the forest,\r\ninterspersed with acres of carefully tilled soil, the fays and\r\ntalismans and spirits of days gone by delightedly do dwell. But below\r\nall this vesture of fancy and fable we find the least pleasing features\r\nof the life of the small proprietors and labourers on the land and\r\nfishermen by the sea. Their feelings of human sympathy are stunted, and\r\neven their family relations are, in too many instances, rendered brutal\r\nby their ever-present greed for gain. The land is a harsh taskmaster,\r\nwhen its cultivation is carried on under such conditions as prevail in\r\nthat portion of France which abuts on the Bay of Biscay. The result is\r\na harsh people, whose narrow individualism and whole-hearted worship\r\nof property in its least attractive guise seem quite at variance with\r\nany form of sentiment, and still more remote from the ideals of poesy\r\nor the dreams of supernatural agencies which affect the imagination.\r\nBut there is the contrast and such are the people of the Bocage of La\r\nVendée.\r\n\r\nHere, on September 28th, 1841, at the village of Mouilleron-en-Pareds,\r\nnear Fontenay le Comte, on the Bay of Biscay, Georges Benjamin\r\nClemenceau was born. His family came of an old stock of La Vendée who\r\nhad owned land in the province for generations. His father was a doctor\r\nas well as a landowner; but his practice, I judge, from what his son\r\ntold me, was confined to gratuitous services rendered to the peasants\r\nof the neighbourhood. M. le Dr. Clemenceau, however, was scarcely\r\nthe sort of man whom one would expect to find in a remote village of\r\nsuch a conservative, not to say reactionary, district as La Vendée. A\r\nthorough-going materialist and convinced Republican, he was the leader\r\nof the local party of extreme Radicals.\r\n\r\nBut he seems to have been a great deal more than that. Science, which\r\ntook with him the place of supernatural religion, neither hardened\r\nhis heart nor cramped his appreciation of art and poetry. Philosopher\r\nand philanthropist, an amateur of painting and sculpture, inflexibly\r\ndevoted to his political principles, yet ever ready to recognise\r\nability and originality wherever they appeared, this very exceptional\r\nmedical man and country squire had necessarily a great influence upon\r\nhis eldest son, who inherited from his father many of the qualities\r\nand opinions which led him to high distinction throughout his career.\r\nHatred of injustice, love of freedom and independence of every kind,\r\nbrought the elder Clemenceau into conflict with the men of the Second\r\nEmpire, who clapped him in prison after the _coup d'état_ of December\r\n1851. Liberty in every shape was, in fact, an essential part of\r\nthis stalwart old Jacobin's political creed, while in the domain of\r\nphysiology and general science he was a convinced evolutionist long\r\nbefore that conception of the inevitable development of the universe\r\nbecame part of the common thought of the time.\r\n\r\nWith all this the young Clemenceau was brought into close contact from\r\nhis earliest years. A thoroughly sound physique, strengthened by the\r\ninvigorating air of the Biscayan coast, laid the foundations of that\r\nindefatigable energy and alertness of disposition which have enabled\r\nhim to pass triumphantly through periods of overwork and disappointment\r\nthat would have broken down the health of any man with a less sound\r\nconstitution. Georges Clemenceau owed much to the begettings and\r\nsurroundings, to the vigorous country life and the rarefied mental\r\natmosphere in which his earlier years were passed. Seldom is it\r\npossible to trace the natural process of cause and effect from father\r\nto son as it is in this case. From the wilds of La Vendée and the rough\r\nsea-coast of Brittany circumstances of the home and of the family life\r\nprovided France with the ablest Radical leader she has ever possessed.\r\n\r\nAt first, it appeared little likely that this would be so. Clemenceau,\r\nentering upon his father's profession, with the benefit of the paternal\r\nknowledge and full of the inculcated readiness to probe all the facts\r\nof life to the bottom, took up his medical studies as a serious\r\nbusiness, after having gone through the ordinary curriculum of a school\r\nat Nantes. It was in the hospital of that city that he first entered\r\nas a qualified student. After a short stay there he went off to Paris,\r\nin 1860, at the age of nineteen, to \"walk the hospitals,\" as we phrase\r\nit, in the same capacity. It was a plunge into active life taken at a\r\nperiod in the history of France which was much more critical than it\r\nseemed.\r\n\r\nThe year which saw Clemenceau's arrival in Paris saw also the Second\r\nEmpire at the height of its fame and influence. As we look back to\r\nthe great stir of 1848, which, so far as Paris and France were\r\nconcerned, was brought about by the almost inconceivable fatuity of\r\nLouis Philippe, we marvel at the strange turn of events which got rid\r\nof Orleanist King Log in order to replace him by a Napoleonist King\r\nStork. But we may wonder still more at the lack of foresight, capacity\r\nand tact of Louis Philippe himself, who had been in his youth the\r\ndemocrat Citoyen Egalité, and an excellent general, with all the hard\r\nexperience of his family misfortune and personal sufferings in exile as\r\na full-grown man, possessed, too, of a thorough knowledge of the world\r\nand an adequate acquaintance with modern thought in several departments\r\nof science and literature. Yet, enjoying all these qualifications for a\r\nsuccessful ruler, Louis Philippe failed to understand that a democratic\r\nmonarchy, and a democratic monarchy alone, could preserve France from a\r\nrepublic or a military dictatorship. This was astounding. He refused to\r\nagree to the democratic vote claimed by the people, and then ran away.\r\nSo the House of Orleans joined the House of Bourbon in the array of\r\ndiscrowned Heads of the Blood Royal. The short-lived Republic of 1848\r\nexisted just long enough to scare the bourgeoisie by the installation\r\nof the National Workshops, which might well have succeeded but for\r\ntheir unintelligent opposition, and the peasantry by the fear of\r\ngeneral Communism, into a demand for a ruler who would preserve them\r\nfrom those whom they considered the maniacs or plunderers of Paris.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the ironies of history that the French Revolution which\r\npromulgated ideas of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity that shook\r\nthe whole civilised world should have been unable to furnish France\r\nherself with a democratic republic for well-nigh a hundred years after\r\nthe overthrow of Louis XVI. For scarcely had the Republic of 1848,\r\nwith Louis Blanc, Ledru Rollin, Albert, and others as its leaders,\r\nbeen founded than the Buonapartist intrigues were successful. Louis\r\nNapoleon, who just before had been the laughing-stock of Europe,\r\nwith his tame eagle at Boulogne that would persist in perching on a\r\npost instead of on his head, with his queer theories of Imperialist\r\ndemocracy and his close association with the Italian Carbonari, was\r\nelected President of the French Republic.\r\n\r\nThis was the outcome of an overwhelming plebiscite in his favour. There\r\ncould be no doubt about the voice of France on this occasion. Paris may\r\npossibly have been genuinely Republican at that time. The Provinces,\r\nwhose antagonism to Paris and the Parisians was very marked, then and\r\nlater, were undoubtedly Buonapartist. From President to Emperor was\r\nno long step. Louis Napoleon, though a man of no great capacity, did\r\nat any rate believe in himself, in his democratic Imperialism and his\r\ndestiny. The set of adventurers and swindlers around him believed only\r\nin full purses and ample opportunities for gratifying their taste\r\nfor luxury and debauchery. Having obtained control of the army by\r\nthe bribery of some and the imprisonment of others of the Republican\r\ngenerals, all was ready for the infamous butchery of peaceful citizens\r\nwhich cowed Paris and established the Empire at the same time. Once\r\nmore the plebiscite was resorted to with equal success on the part of\r\nthe conspirators. The hero of the _coup d'état_, with his familiar\r\ncoterie of Morny, Flahault, Persigny, Canrobert and other rogues and\r\nmurderers of less degree, became Napoleon III and master of Paris and\r\nof France in December, 1852.\r\n\r\nThe French threw their votes almost solid in favour of the Empire,\r\nand thus tacitly condoned the hideous crime committed when it was\r\nestablished. Whenever the Emperor's right to his throne was challenged\r\nhe could point triumphantly to that crushing vote of the democracy\r\nconstituting him the duly elected Emperor of the French and hereditary\r\nrepresentative--however doubtful his parentage--of that extraordinary\r\nCorsican genius who, when Chateaubriand and other detractors sneered at\r\nhis origin, boldly declared, \"_Moi je suis ancêtre._\"\r\n\r\nFrom that day to this, democrats and Republicans have had a profound\r\ndistrust of the vote of the mass of the people as recorded under a\r\nplébiscite, or a referendum, of the entire male population. This lack\r\nof confidence in the judgment of the majority, when appealed to on\r\npolitical issues, though natural under the circumstances, is obviously\r\nquite illogical on the part of men who declare their belief in popular\r\ngovernment. It amounts to a permanent claim for the highly educated\r\nand well-to-do sections of an intellectual oligarchy, on the ground\r\nthat they must know better what is good for the people than the people\r\nknow for themselves. This might conceivably be true, if no pecuniary\r\ninterests or arrogance of social superiority were involved. But as\r\nthis state of things cannot be attained until production for profit,\r\npayment of wages and private property cease to exist, democrats and\r\nRepublicans place themselves in a doubtful position when they denounce\r\na reference to the entire population as necessarily harmful. All that\r\ncan be safely admitted is that so long as the mass of men and women\r\nare economically dependent, socially unfree and very imperfectly\r\neducated, the possibility of their being able to secure good government\r\nby a plébiscite is very remote. But this applies as well to universal\r\nsuffrage used to obtain parliamentary elections, and the argument\r\nagainst reposing any trust in the mass of the people may thus be\r\npushed to the point of abrogating the vote altogether save for a small\r\nminority. And this would land us in the position of beginning with an\r\nautocracy or aristocracy and ending there.\r\n\r\nAt the time I am speaking of it is indisputable that a considerable\r\nmajority of intelligent and educated Frenchmen were Republicans.\r\nWhat they meant by a Republic comprised many different shades of\r\norganised democracy. But Republic, as Republic, in opposition and\r\ncontradistinction to Monarchy or Empire, was a name to conjure with\r\namong all the most distinguished Frenchmen of the time. How did it come\r\nabout, then, that this minority, which should have been able to lead\r\nthe people, was distrusted and voted down by the very same populace\r\nwhose rights of self-government they themselves were championing\r\non behalf of their countrymen? There was nothing in the form of a\r\nRepublic, as was shown little more than twenty years afterwards, which\r\nwas of necessity at variance with the interests or the sentiments of\r\nFrenchmen. Even the antagonism between Paris and the Provinces, already\r\nreferred to, was not so marked as to account for the fact that twice in\r\nsuccession Louis Napoleon should have obtained an overwhelming personal\r\nvote in his favour as the man to be trusted, above all other Frenchmen,\r\nto control the destinies of France.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means certain that Paris herself was hostile, before the\r\n_coup d'état_, to the Napoleonic régime with its traditions not only\r\nof military glory but of capable civic administration. For the double\r\nplébiscite was more than a vote of acquiescence: it was a vote of\r\nenthusiasm: first for Louis Napoleon as President, and then for Louis\r\nNapoleon as Emperor. It is not pleasing to have to admit this; but\r\nthe truth seems to be that, as Aristotle pointed out more than two\r\nthousand years ago, great masses of men are much more easily led by a\r\npersonality than they are roused by a principle. That the plébiscite\r\nhad been carefully worked up by assiduous propaganda; that many of the\r\nignorant peasants believed they were voting for the Napoleon of their\r\nchildhood in spite of the impossible; that there was a great deal of\r\nbribery and not a little stuffing of the ballot boxes by officials\r\nwith a keen sense of favours to come; that the army was imbued with\r\nNapoleonic sympathies and helped to spread the spurious ideals of\r\nImperialism--all this may be perfectly true. Yet, when all is said and\r\nevery allowance is made, the fact remains that, even so, the success of\r\nthe Napoleonic plébiscites is imperfectly explained. The main features\r\nof the vote were obvious: The French people were sick of hereditary\r\nmonarchy: the Republican leaders were out of touch with the people: the\r\nideals of the past overshadowed the hopes of the future: Napoleon was a\r\nname to conjure with: the Republicans had no name on their side to put\r\nagainst it: the \"blessed word\" Republic had no hold upon the peasantry\r\nof rural France. So plébiscite meant one-man rule. That is not to say,\r\nas so many argue nowadays, that the complete vote of the democracy on\r\nsuch an issue must of necessity be wrong; but it does affirm that a\r\nthoroughly educated, responsible democracy, accustomed to be appealed\r\nto directly on all matters of importance, is a necessity before we\r\ncan have any certainty that the people will go right. Even if they\r\ngo wrong, as in this case of Napoleon III, it is better in the long\r\nrun that they should learn by their own errors than that the blunders\r\nof the dominant classes should be forced upon them. Great social and\r\npolitical problems can rarely be solved even by the greatest genius.\r\nAnd the genius himself, supposing him to exist, cannot rely upon\r\nproviding his country with a successor. On the whole, consequently,\r\nit is less dangerous to human progress that we should risk such a\r\nreactionary vote as that which seated Napoleon III at the Tuileries\r\nthan give no peaceful outlet whatever to popular opinion.\r\n\r\nBut the democrats and republicans, radicals and socialists of Paris,\r\nwho saw all their most cherished ideals crushed by the voice of the\r\npeople whom they were anxious to lead to higher things, and beheld a\r\ntravesty of Napoleonic Imperialism suppressing all freedom of political\r\nthought and writing, were not disposed to philosophise about the\r\nexcuses for a popular decision which led to such unpleasant results\r\nfor them. They had welcomed the abdication of Louis Philippe and the\r\ninstallation of the Republic as the beginning of a new era not only for\r\nParis but for all France, after the reactionary clericalism of Louis\r\nXVIII and Charles X, followed by the chilly middle-class rule of the\r\nOrleanist monarch. But now a pinchbeck Napoleonism, with much sterner\r\nrepression, weighed upon all that was most progressive and brilliant in\r\nthe capital city. It was a bitter disappointment, not to be softened by\r\nthe reflection that France herself was still far from the economic and\r\nsocial stage where their aspirations could be realised.\r\n\r\nThus Napoleon III was master of France and, feeling that war was\r\nadvisable in order to strengthen his position at home, gladly joined\r\nwith Great Britain in a joint campaign against Russia. This was wholly\r\nunnecessary, as has since been clearly shown. But, by promoting a\r\nbetter feeling between France and England than had previously existed,\r\nsome good came out of the evil brought about by the treacherous\r\nsuppression of the Emperor Nicholas's agreement with the English\r\nCabinet. The foolish bolstering up of Ottoman incapacity and corruption\r\nat Constantinople when the Western Powers could easily have enforced a\r\nmore reasonable rule was a miserable result of the whole war. But that\r\nthe Crimean adventure helped to consolidate the position of the Emperor\r\nthere is no doubt.\r\n\r\nWhen also the affair of the Orsini bomb, thrown by one of his old\r\nCarbonari fellow-conspirators, impelled Louis Napoleon into the Italian\r\ncampaign which won for Italy Lombardy and for France Savoy and Nice,\r\nthe French people felt that their gain in glory and in territory had\r\nmade them once more the first nation in Europe. Magenta and Solferino\r\nwere names to conjure with. The Army had confidence in the Emperor\r\nand his generals. So the prospect for republicans and the Republic\r\neight years after the _coup d'état_ was less promising than it had\r\nbeen since the great revolution. Napoleon III was generally regarded\r\nas the principal figure in Europe. He was delivering those New Year\r\nproclamations which men awaited with bated breath as deciding the\r\nquestion of peace or war for the ensuing twelvemonth. His Empress\r\ndominated the world of fashion as her consort did the world of\r\npolitics. Every effort was made to render the Court as brilliant as\r\npossible, and to attract to it some of the old nobility, who were, as a\r\nwhole, little inclined to recognise by their presence the power of the\r\nman whom they both despised and hated. But the Second Empire was for a\r\ntime a success in spite of the reactionists and the republicans alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                        PARIS UNDER THE EMPIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nParis of the early sixties was a very different city from the Paris of\r\nto-day. It was still in great part the Paris of the old time, on both\r\nbanks of the Seine. Its Haussmannisation had barely begun. The Palais\r\nRoyal retained much of its ancient celebrity for the cuisine of its\r\nrestaurants and the brilliancy of its shops. But to get to it direct\r\nfrom what is now the Place de l'Opéra was a voyage of discovery. You\r\nwent upstairs and downstairs, through narrow, dirty streets, until,\r\nafter missing your way several times, you at last found yourself in the\r\ngarden dear to the orators of the French Revolution, and since devoted\r\nto nursemaids and their babes. Much of Central Paris was in the same\r\nunregenerate state. Even portions of famous streets not far from the\r\nGrands Boulevards, which were then still French, could scarcely be\r\ndescribed as models of cleanliness. The smells that arose from below\r\nand the water of doubtful origin that might descend upon the unwary\r\npasserby from above suggested a general lack of sanitary control which\r\nwas fully confirmed in more remote districts.\r\n\r\nNapoleon III was a man of mediocre ability. His _entourage_ was\r\nextravagantly disreputable. But he and his did clear out and clean\r\nup Paris. The new quarters since built owe their existence in the\r\nfirst instance to the initiative of the Emperor's chief edile, Baron\r\nHaussmann, and his compeers. The great broad streets which now traverse\r\nthe slums of old time were due to the same energetic impulse. Whether\r\nsuch spacious avenues and boulevards were constructed in order to\r\nfacilitate the operations of artillery and enable the new mitrailleurs\r\nmore conveniently to massacre the \"mob,\" whether the architecture\r\nis artistic or monotonous, Clemenceau the doctor must for once be\r\nat variance with Clemenceau the man of politics, and admit that the\r\nmonarch who, as will be seen, imprisoned him in 1862, did some good\r\nwork for Paris during his reign of repression. At any rate Napoleonic\r\nrule at this period represented general prosperity. Business was good\r\nand the profiteers were doing well. The bourgeoisie felt secure and\r\ninternational financiers enjoyed a good time. Nearly all the great\r\nbanking and financial institutions of Paris had their origin in the\r\ndecade 1860-1870. Law and order, in short, was based upon comfort and\r\naccumulation for the well-to-do.\r\n\r\nBut the peasantry and the workers of the cities were also considered in\r\nsome degree, and the reconstruction of the capital provided, directly\r\nand indirectly, both then and later, for what were looked upon as \"the\r\ndangerous classes\"--men and women, that is to say, who thought that the\r\nwage-slave epoch meant little better for them and their children than\r\npenal servitude for life. Constant work and decent pay softened the\r\nclass antagonism, conciliating the proletariat without upsetting the\r\nmiddle class or bourgeoisie. Such a policy, following upon two fairly\r\nsuccessful wars, was not devoid of dexterity. A curbed or satisfied\r\nParis meant internal peace for all France. Neither the miserable\r\nfiasco in Mexico nor the idiotic abandonment of Austria to Prussia\r\nhad yet shaken the external stability of the Empire. Napoleon III and\r\nhis Vice-Emperor Rouher were still great statesmen. There was little\r\nor nothing to show on the surface that the whole edifice was even\r\nthen tottering to its fall. The keen satire of Rochefort, of the Duc\r\nd'Aumale, and the full-blooded denunciations of Victor Hugo failed to\r\nproduce much effect. Some genuine and capable opponents were beguiled\r\ninto serving the Government under the impression that the Empire\r\nmight be permanent, and in this way alone could they also serve their\r\ncountry. Nor can we wonder at such backsliding.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Paris, such the France that saw the young medical student,\r\nGeorges Clemenceau, enter upon his preparation for active life as\r\ndoctor and physiologist. He devoted himself earnestly to his studies in\r\nthe libraries, to his work in the hospitals, and to careful observation\r\nof the social maladies he saw around him, which made a deep and\r\npermanent impression on his mind. But, determined as he was to master\r\nthe principles and practice of his profession, the bright, active and\r\nvivacious republican from La Vendée brought with him to Paris too clear\r\na conception of his rights and duties as a democrat to be able to avoid\r\nthe coteries of revolt who maintained the traditions of radicalism in\r\nspite of systematic espionage and police persecution. Clemenceau shared\r\nhis father's opinions in favour of free speech and a free press.\r\n\r\nThat was dangerous in those days. _La Ville Lumière_ was obliged\r\nto hide its light under a bushel. Friends of democracy and\r\nanti-imperialistic speakers and writers were compelled, in order\r\nto reach their public, to adopt a style of suppressed irony not\r\nat all to the taste of the vivacious republican recruit from\r\nMouilleron-en-Pareds. Then, as ever thereafter, he spoke the truth\r\nthat was in him, regardless of consequences. In this course he had\r\nthe approbation and support of his father's friend, Etienne Arago,\r\nbrother of the famous astronomer. Arago the politician was also a\r\nplaywright, an ardent republican who had taken his full share in all\r\nthe agitations of the previous period, an active and useful member of\r\nthe Republican Government of 1848 as Postmaster-General, and a vigorous\r\nopponent of the policy of Louis Napoleon. He was sent into exile prior\r\nto the _coup d'état_. Both then and nearly a generation later this\r\nstalwart anti-Imperialist was exceedingly popular with the Parisians,\r\nand, having returned to Paris, was able to aid Clemenceau in forming a\r\ncorrect judgment of the situation, at a time when a less clear-sighted\r\nobserver might have striven to cool his young friend's enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAs it was, Clemenceau contributed to some of the Radical fly-sheets\r\nand then fêted the 24th of February. No date dear to the memory of\r\nRepublicans could be publicly toasted without conveying a reflection\r\nupon the Empire, and as all important events in French history, from\r\nJuly 14th onwards, are duly calendared according to the month and\r\nday of the month, Clemenceau's crime in celebrating February 24th by\r\nspeech and writing was obvious. He therefore fell foul of the Imperial\r\npolice. The magistrate could admit no point in his favour, and there\r\nwas in fact no defence. Consequently Georges Clemenceau, _interne de\r\nl'hôpital_, had the opportunity given him of reflecting for two months\r\nupon the advantages and drawbacks of his political creed, during a\r\nperiod of Buonapartist supremacy, in the prison of Mazas. This was in\r\n1862.\r\n\r\nThree years later he took his doctor's degree. His formal essay on\r\nthis occasion gained him considerable reputation. It was entitled _De\r\nla Génération des Éléments Anatomiques_, and proved not only that he\r\nhad worked hard on the lines of his profession but that he was capable\r\nof taking an original view of the subjects he had mastered. This\r\nwork has been throughout the basis of Clemenceau's medical, social,\r\npolitical and literary career. I got the book not long ago from the\r\nLondon Library, and on the title-page of this first edition I read in\r\nthe author's own bold handwriting, \"_A Monsieur J. Stuart Mill hommage\r\nrespectueux de l'auteur G. Clemenceau_\": a tribute to that eclectic\r\nphilosopher and thinker which he followed up shortly afterwards by\r\ntranslating Mill's study of Auguste Comte and Positivism into French.\r\nClemenceau was no great admirer of Comte, and specially disapproved\r\nof the attempt of some of that author's pupils and followers to\r\nlimit investigation and cultivate agnosticism on matters which they\r\nconsidered fell without the bounds of their master's theories and\r\ncategories.\r\n\r\n\"We are not of those,\" writes Clemenceau, \"who admit with the\r\nPositivist that science can give us no information on the enigma of\r\nthings.\" This seems scarcely just to the modern Positivists, for\r\nalthough Comte himself wished to restrict mankind from the study of\r\nastronomy, for example, outside of the solar system, they have been as\r\nready as the rest of the world to take advantage of discoveries beyond\r\nthat system which throw light upon some of the difficult material\r\nproblems nearer at hand. And Clemenceau, too, appears to fall into the\r\nline of reasoning with which he reproaches Comte; for, as will be seen\r\nlater, he views nature as a mass of matter evolving and differentiating\r\nand organising and vivifying itself with the interminable antagonisms\r\nand mutual devourings of the various forms of existence on this\r\nplanet, and possibly on other worlds of the infinitely little, and\r\nthen, when the great suns die out, disappearing and beginning all over\r\nagain as two of these huge extinguished luminaries collide in space.\r\nThis material philosophy, when carried to its ultimate issue, still\r\nanswers no question and furnishes no clue to the strange inexplicable\r\nmovement of the universe in which man is but a sentient and partially\r\nintelligent automaton. What explanation does this give of any of the\r\nproblems of social or individual ethic, or of the impulse which led\r\nClemenceau the doctor to treat his patients in Montmartre gratuitously,\r\ninstead of building up a valuable practice in a rich quarter? and urged\r\nClemenceau the politician to pass the greater part of his life in an\r\nuphill fight against the domination of the sordid minority and the\r\ntimid acquiescence of the apathetic masses rather than accept the high\r\npositions which were pressed upon him time after time?\r\n\r\nSuch reflections would be out of place at this point, but for the fact\r\nthat Clemenceau has invariably contended that his career has been all\r\nof a piece, maintaining that the vigorous young physiologist and doctor\r\nof twenty-four and twenty-five held the same opinions and was moved\r\nby the same aspirations that have guided the mature man throughout.\r\nWhether heredity and surroundings fully account in every particular for\r\nall that he has said, done and achieved is a question which Clemenceau\r\nalso might decline to answer with the definiteness he considers\r\ndesirable in general philosophy. But that his doctor's thesis of 1865\r\ndid in the main give the scientific basis of his material creed can\r\nscarcely be disputed.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1866, was the year of the Prusso-Italian war\r\nagainst Austria. The success of Prussia, which would quite probably\r\nhave been a failure but for the incredible fatuity of the Imperial\r\nclique at Vienna, was one of the chief causes, unnoted at the time,\r\nof the downfall of Napoleon III. Few now care to recall the manner in\r\nwhich the Austrian Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Benedek, was compelled\r\nto abandon his entire strategy in deference to the pusillanimous orders\r\nof the Emperor, or how Benedek, with a loyalty to the House of Hapsburg\r\nwhich it has never at any period deserved, took upon himself the blame\r\nof defeats for which Francis Joseph, not himself, was responsible.\r\nBut Louis Napoleon was equally blind to his own interests and those\r\nof France when he stood aside and allowed the most ambitious and most\r\nunscrupulous power in the world to become the virtual master of Central\r\nEurope. It was a strange choice of evils that lay before the Radical\r\nand Republican parties in all countries during this war. None could\r\nwish to see upheld, still less strengthened, the wretched rule of\r\nreactionary, tyrannous and priest-ridden Austria; yet none could look\r\nfavourably on the growth of Prussian power.\r\n\r\nThe further conquest by Italy of her own territory and the annexation\r\nof Venice to the Italian crown were therefore universally acclaimed.\r\nBut those who knew Prussia and its military system, and watched the\r\nnefarious policy which had crushed Denmark as a stage on the road\r\nto the crushing of Austria, even thus early began to doubt whether\r\nthe substitution of Prussia for Austria in the leadership of the\r\nold Germanic Bund might not speedily lead to a still more dangerous\r\nsituation. Either this did not suggest itself to Napoleon III and his\r\nadvisers, or they thought that Austria might win, or, at worst, that\r\na bitterly contested campaign would enable France to interpose at\r\nthe critical moment as a decisive arbiter in the struggle. Probably\r\nthe last was the real calculation. It was falsified by the rapid and\r\nsmashing Prussian victories of Königgratz and Sadowa, and Napoleon\r\ncould do nothing but accept the decisions of the battlefield. But from\r\nthis moment the Second Empire was in serious danger, and any far-seeing\r\nstatesman would have set to work immediately to bring the French army\r\nup to the highest possible point of efficiency and prepare the way for\r\nalliances that might help the Empire, should help be needed in the\r\nnear future. Neither Louis Napoleon nor his councillors and generals,\r\nhowever, understood what the overthrow of Austria meant for France.\r\nThey turned a deaf ear then and afterwards to the warnings of their\r\nablest agents abroad, and thus drifted into the crisis which four years\r\nlater found them without an ally and overwhelmed them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                      DOWNFALL AND RECONSTRUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1866, Clemenceau, after a visit to England, crossed the\r\nAtlantic for a somewhat prolonged stay in the United States. He could\r\nscarcely have chosen a better time for making acquaintance with America\r\nand the Americans. The United States had but just emerged from the\r\nCivil War, which, notwithstanding the furious bitterness evoked on both\r\nsides during the struggle, eventually consolidated the Great Republic\r\nas nothing else could; though, owing to the behaviour of \"society\"\r\nin England, the tone of our leading statesmen and the action of the\r\n_Alabama_, the feeling against Great Britain was naturally very strong.\r\nThis animosity--it was no less--of course did not extend to the young\r\nFrench physician of republican views who had already suffered for his\r\nopinions in Paris, and whose sympathies were with the North against the\r\nSouth throughout. He was well received in the Eastern States, and wrote\r\nseveral letters to the _Temps_ on the industrial and social conditions\r\nof America which were then of value, and still serve to show how marked\r\nis the contrast between the self-contained nation of fifty years\r\nago and the Anglo-Saxon world power that has successfully tried her\r\nstrength in the international struggle against Germanic infamy to-day.\r\nWhat is not so easy to comprehend is M. le Dr. Clemenceau, as we know\r\nhim, acting as professor of French in a young ladies' college at the\r\nvillage of Stanford, in the neighbourhood of New York. His record in\r\nthat capacity is amusingly described by one of his friends[A] in a\r\nbright little sketch of his early experiences.\r\n\r\n\"An admirable horseman, the young Frenchman accompanied the still\r\nyounger American misses in their rides. There were free and delightful\r\nlittle tours on horseback, charming excursions along the shady roads\r\nwhich traverse the gay landscape of Connecticut. Such years carried\r\nwith them for Clemenceau ineffaceable memories of a period during\r\nwhich his temperament accomplished the task of gaining strength and\r\nacquiring refinement. At the same time that he enriched his mind with\r\nsolid conceptions of Anglo-Saxon philosophy, and perfected his general\r\ncultivation, he took his first lessons in the delicacies of American\r\nflirtation. It was in the course of these pleasing jaunts, where\r\nthe fresh laughter of these young ladies echoed through the bright\r\nscenery, that it was his lot to become betrothed to one of them, Miss\r\nMary Plummer. Henceforth, in consequence of the sound, independent\r\nand many-sided education which he had, so to say, imposed upon\r\nhimself, Clemenceau had completed the last stage of his intellectual\r\ndevelopment. He was ripe to play great parts. For the rest, events were\r\nnot destined long to delay the throwing into full relief his versatile,\r\nintrepid and powerful characteristics.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so Clemenceau, thus prepared to meet what the future might have\r\nin store for him, returned to Paris. There are cities in the history\r\nof the human race which have taken unto themselves a personality, not\r\nonly for their own inhabitants, but for succeeding ages, and for the\r\nworld at large. Babylon, Athens, Jerusalem, Rome, Bagdad, Florence,\r\neach and all convey to the mind a conception of chic individuality and\r\ncollective achievement which brings them within the range of our own\r\nknowledge, admiration and respect, which raises them also to the level\r\nof ideals of culture for men living in far different civilisations.\r\nThey are still oases of brightness and greenery amid the wilderness\r\nof unconscious growth. The wars of old time, the cruelty of long-past\r\ndays, the records of brutality and lust are forgotten: only the memory\r\nof greatness or beauty remains.\r\n\r\n    \"Terror by night, the flaming battle-call,\r\n       Fire on the roof-tree, dreadful blood and woe!--\r\n     They cease for tears, yet joyful, knowing all\r\n               Is over, long ago.\r\n\r\n     Knowing, the melancholy hands of Time\r\n       Weave a slow veil of beauty o'er the place\r\n     Of blood-stained memory and bitter crime\r\n               Till horror fades in grace.\r\n\r\n     The mournful grace of long-forgotten woe\r\n       And long-appeased sorrows of the dead,\r\n     The deeper silence of those streams that flow\r\n               Where ancient highways led.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the great cities of the past which is still the present Paris\r\ntakes her undisputed place. In youth, in maturity, in age, the charm\r\nof intellectual and artistic Paris ever affects not merely her own\r\ncitizens, but the strangers within her gates. And the young Vendéen\r\nClemenceau was from the first a Parisian of Parisians. The attraction\r\nof Paris for him was permanent. From his arrival in 1860 until the\r\npresent time practically his whole life has been spent in the French\r\ncapital. Many years afterwards he gave expression to the influence\r\nParis had upon him. Paris for Clemenceau is the sun of the world of\r\nscience and letters, the source of light and heat from whose centre art\r\nand thought radiate through space. \"Intuition and suggestion spreading\r\nout in all directions awake dormant energy, sweep on from contact to\r\ncontact, are passed on, dispersed, and finally exhausted in the inertia\r\nof material objects. Here is the radiance of humanity, more or less\r\npowerful, more or less durable as time and place may decree.\"\r\n\r\nIt is this impatience of Paris with results already achieved, this\r\ndesire to reach out and to embrace new forms in all departments of\r\nhuman achievement, which give the French city her position as an\r\nindispensable entity in the cosmos of modern life. \"Boldness and\r\nboldness and boldness again\" was Danton's prescription for the orator,\r\nand it might be taken as the motto of intellectual and artistic Paris.\r\nThere is no hesitation, no contentment, no waiting by the wayside. New\r\nideas and new conceptions must ever be replacing the old. Experience\r\nmay teach what to avoid: experiment alone can teach what to attempt.\r\nAnd this not incidentally or as a passing phase of endeavour, but as a\r\nprinciple to be applied in every region of human effort. \"The Rights\r\nof Man,\" \"Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,\" \"Property is robbery\" are\r\nas thought-provoking (though they solve no problem) in the domain\r\nof sociology as Pasteur's achievements in physiology and medicine.\r\nWhatever changes the future may have in store for us, we who are not\r\nFrenchmen cannot dispense with the leadership and inspiration that come\r\nto us from Paris.\r\n\r\nOn his return to France from America Clemenceau renewed his\r\nacquaintance and friendship with those who shared his political\r\nand social opinions, especially Etienne Arago, now an old man, and\r\npractised as a doctor in the working-class district of Montmartre.\r\nHere, by his gratuitous medical advice to the people and his steady\r\nadherence to his democratic principles, he gained an amount of\r\npopularity and personal devotion from the men and women of Montmartre\r\nwhich, in conjunction with Arago's advice and support, prepared the way\r\nfor the positions which he afterwards attained. Meanwhile the Second\r\nEmpire was going slowly downhill. The change which had already taken\r\nplace was not generally recognised. Nevertheless, the failure of the\r\nill-fated Mexican Expedition with its Catholic support, its sordid\r\nfinancial muddling and the degrading system of plunder carried on in\r\nMexico itself by Marshal Bazaine, the effect on Paris of the murder of\r\nVictor Noir by a member of the Buonaparte family, and the Government's\r\ngrowing incapacity to handle domestic and foreign affairs all told\r\nagainst the prestige of Napoleon. Only a successful diplomatic stroke\r\nor a victorious war could rehabilitate the credit of the Empire. The\r\ntime had gone by for either. Bismarck's disgraceful forgery at Ems was\r\nas unnecessary as it was flagitious. Sooner or later the Second Empire\r\nwould have collapsed from its own incompetence. But that waiting game\r\ndid not suit the grim statesman of Berlin. He knew that the French army\r\nby itself could not hold its own against the Prussian and other German\r\nforces; he felt convinced also that Austria would not move without\r\nmuch clearer assurances of success than Napoleon could supply; while\r\nItaly was still tied to her Ally of 1866, and England was devoted to\r\na policy of profitable non-intervention. So Napoleon was half driven,\r\nhalf tricked into a hopeless campaign, and every calculation on which\r\nBismarck relied was verified by the results. Nay, the plébiscite which\r\nLouis Napoleon risked eighteen years after the _coup d'état_ went\r\nentirely in his favour, and it was in reality quite unnecessary, from\r\nthe point of view of internal politics, that any risk of war should\r\nbe run. The Empress, however, has always had the discredit of not\r\nhaving been of that opinion. Hence steps were taken which played into\r\nBismarck's hands.\r\n\r\nAt first, as I have heard Clemenceau say himself, it was almost\r\nimpossible for a patriotic Republican to desire victory for the\r\nFrench armies. That would only have meant a new life for the decadent\r\nEmpire. Sad, therefore, as was the long succession of disasters, and\r\nterrible the devastation wrought by German ruthlessness, not until\r\nthe culminating defeat of Sedan, the surrender of Napoleon and the\r\ndecree of Imperial overthrow pronounced by the people of Paris, could\r\nmen feel that French soldiers were really fighting for their country.\r\nThenceforward the struggle was between democratic and progressive\r\nFrance and autocratic and reactionary Prussia. The Empire for whose\r\nhumiliation the King of Prussia had gone to war existed no longer. A\r\nRepublic was at once declared in its place. Any fair-minded enemy would\r\ndirectly have offered the easiest possible terms for peace to the new\r\nFrance. But that was not the view of Prussia. France, not merely the\r\nSecond Empire, was to be defeated and crushed down, because she stood\r\nin the way of that permanent policy of aggression and aggrandisement\r\nto which the House of Hohenzollern, with its Junker supporters, has\r\nalways been devoted. This was the moment when England should have\r\ninterfered decisively on the side of her old rival. It was not only\r\nour interest but our duty to do so, and the whole nation would have\r\nenthusiastically supported the statesmen who had given it a vigorous\r\nlead in the right direction. Unfortunately Queen Victoria, then as\r\never bitterly pro-German, was utterly unscrupulous in enforcing her\r\nviews upon her Government: the men then in office were essentially\r\ncourtiers, who combined servility at home with pusillanimity abroad:\r\nthe _laissez-faire_ school of parasitical commercialism which regards\r\nthe accumulation of wealth for the few as the highest aspiration of\r\nhumanity held the trading classes in its grip. Consequently, the\r\nmonarch and the ruling class of the day thought it was cheaper, and\r\ntherefore better, to leave France to her fate, and make a good cash\r\nprofit out of the business, rather than courageously to withstand the\r\nbeginnings of evil and uphold the French Republic against the brutality\r\nand greed of Berlin. It is sad, nearly fifty years later, to reflect\r\nupon the results of this mistaken and cowardly policy. The war was\r\ncontinued, owing chiefly to English indifference, until France lay at\r\nthe feet of the conquerors.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the news of the defeat and surrender of Sedan reach\r\nParis than a general shout for the overthrow of the Empire went up\r\nfrom the people throughout the French capital. The collapse of the\r\nSecond Empire was in fact even more sudden and dramatic than its rise.\r\nThe whole imperial machinery fell with a crash. There was not a man\r\nin Paris among the friends of the Emperor in good fortune who had the\r\ncourage and capacity to come to the front in the time of his distress.\r\nThe bigoted Catholic Empress, against whom Parisians cherished an\r\nanimosity scarcely less bitter than that which their forbears felt for\r\nMarie Antoinette, was with difficulty got safely out of the city, and\r\nParis at once took control of her own destinies. A Republic having\r\nbeen proclaimed, Republicans, Radicals and Socialists, harried and\r\nproscribed the day before, rushed to the front the day after, and\r\nforthwith became masters of the city. Clemenceau as one of them was\r\nimmediately chosen Mayor of Montmartre, at the instance of his old\r\nfriend Etienne Arago.\r\n\r\nIt was a period for action, not for argument, or reflection, or\r\npropaganda. Clemenceau understood that. In his capacity as Mayor of\r\nMontmartre, by no means an easy district to manage, he exhibited\r\nmarvellous energy, as well as sound judgment, in every department of\r\npublic affairs. Everything had to be reorganised at once. There was\r\nno time to respect the inevitable details of democratic authorisation\r\nand delay. Clemenceau with his natural rapidity of decision was the\r\nvery man for the post. Patriotic and revolutionary excitement seethed\r\nall round him. Society seemed already to be in the melting-pot.\r\nThe enthusiasm evoked by eloquent orations in favour of Socialism\r\nwas accompanied by the discharges of cannon and the rumbling of\r\nammunition-wagons. But public business had to be carried on all the\r\nsame. Clemenceau was indefatigable and ubiquitous. He prevented the\r\npriests from intriguing in the municipal schools, he established purely\r\nsecular education, hurried on the arming of the battalions and kept a\r\nsharp eye on the defences of the city. Simultaneously he set on foot a\r\nseries of establishments for giving warmth, food and general help to\r\nthe number of people who had sought refuge on the heights. He acted\r\nthroughout practically as municipal dictator, raising, arming and\r\ndrilling recruits for the new republican army, as well as organising\r\nand administering all the local services.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine piece of work. Having been so closely in touch with the\r\nbulk of the population of Montmartre, he was able to act entirely in\r\ntheir interests and with their concurrence throughout. They therefore\r\nwarmly supported him against the reactionists and religionists who,\r\nthen as always, were his most virulent enemies. It was no easy task to\r\nmaintain order and carry out systematic organisation at this juncture.\r\nThe downfall of the Empire occurred on September 4th, the Republic,\r\nwith General Trochu--the man of the undisclosed strategical \"plan\"--as\r\nPresident and Jules Favre as Vice-President, being declared the same\r\nday. On September 19th Paris was invested by the Germans. Seeing that\r\nthere were then no fewer than 400,000 armed men, at various stages of\r\ntraining, in the capital, with many powerful forts at their disposal,\r\nwhile the Germans could spare at the beginning of the siege no more\r\nthan 120,000 men for the attack, the French having still several armies\r\nin the field, successful resistance by the Republic seemed by no means\r\nhopeless. Paris might even have had her share in turning the tide of\r\nvictory. Clemenceau was of that opinion.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be. France failed to produce a great general, and the\r\n\"bagman Marshal,\" as Bazaine was called in Mexico, by shutting himself\r\nup with 175,000 men in Metz, rendered final defeat certain; though if\r\nMarshal MacMahon's advice had been followed, and if General Trochu had\r\nlater sufficiently organised the forces at his disposal in Paris to\r\nbreak through the German lines, a stouter fight might have been fought.\r\nAs it was, one French army after another was defeated in the field,\r\nand Paris and Metz were forced to surrender by literal starvation. On\r\nJanuary 28th, 1871, an armistice was signed between Bismarck and Jules\r\nFavre and the revictualling of the famine-stricken Parisians began, the\r\nsiege having lasted a little over four months. A National Assembly was\r\nsummoned to decide the terms of a definite peace or in what manner it\r\nmight be possible to continue the war.\r\n\r\nSo well satisfied were the voters of Montmartre with the conduct of\r\ntheir Mayor during all this trying time that they decided to send him\r\nas their representative to Bordeaux and polled just upon 100,000 votes\r\nin his favour. To Bordeaux, therefore, Clemenceau went, on February\r\n12th, as deputy for one of the most radical and revolutionary districts\r\nof Paris. Though neither then nor later an avowed Socialist, no\r\nSocialist could have done more for practical democratic and Socialist\r\nmeasures than Clemenceau had done. That, of course, was the reason why\r\nhe was elected by so advanced a constituency.\r\n\r\nHe found himself strangely out of his element when he took his seat\r\nin the National Assembly. Perhaps no more reactionary body had ever\r\nmet in France. The majority of the members were thorough-going\r\nConservatives who at heart were eager to restore the monarchy. They\r\nwere royalists but slightly disguised, dug up out of their seclusion,\r\nfrom all parts of the country, who thought their time had come to\r\nrevenge themselves not so much upon the Buonapartists who had governed\r\nFrance for twenty years as upon Paris and the Parisians who had chased\r\nCharles X and Louis Philippe out of France. They well knew that the\r\ncapital would never consent to the restoration of the candidate of\r\neither of the Bourbon factions. These fitting champions of a worn-out\r\nLegitimism or Orleanism were old men in a hurry to resuscitate the\r\ndead and galvanise the past into fresh life. Their very heads betrayed\r\ntheir own antiquity. So much so that a favourite pastime of young\r\nladies of pleasure in the Galleries, who had flocked to Bordeaux,\r\nwas what was irreverently called \"bald-headed loo.\" This consisted\r\nin betting upon the number of flies that would settle within a given\r\nperiod upon a devoted deputy's hairless occiput. Unfortunately these\r\nancient gentlemen found in M. Thiers a leader who could scarcely have\r\nbeen surpassed for ingenuity and unscrupulousness. He deliberately\r\ntraded upon prejudices, and his main political assets were the fear\r\nand distrust which he awakened in one set of his countrymen against\r\nanother. In modern as in ancient society there is an economic and\r\nalmost a personal antagonism between country and town.\r\n\r\nThe man of the Provinces, living always in the rural districts, the\r\ntiller, the producer, the indefatigable toiler, the parsimonious\r\naccumulator of small gains, the respecter of ancestral traditions and\r\nthe devotee of old-world methods and well-tried means of gaining a poor\r\nlivelihood, profoundly affected likewise by his inherited religion,\r\nhas, in most cases, a deep-seated contempt, strangely enough not\r\nwholly divorced from fear, for the man of the town, and especially\r\nfor the man of Paris. This animosity, which has by no means wholly\r\ndisappeared to-day, was keenly in evidence forty and fifty years ago.\r\nThere is an economic cause at the bottom of the antipathy, but this\r\ndoes not account for its many-sided manifestation. The countryman\r\nnaturally desires to sell his produce at as high a price as possible.\r\nIt is for him almost a matter of life and death to do so. The townsman,\r\non his side, the artisan or labourer or even the _rentier_ of the great\r\ncities, is naturally anxious to obtain the necessaries of life which he\r\ngets from the rural districts at as low a rate as he may be able to buy\r\nthem having regard to his wages or his income. Hence any expenditure\r\nwhich tends to benefit the country is regarded with suspicion by the\r\ntownsman and contrariwise as between town and country, except such\r\noutlay as cheapens the cost of transportation, where both have an\r\nidentical interest.\r\n\r\nBut this general divergence of economic advantage, which has existed\r\nfor many centuries does not wholly account for the ill-feeling which\r\ntoo often appears. There is a psychological side to the matter as well.\r\nThus the peasant, even when he is getting satisfactory prices for his\r\nwares, despises his own customers when they pay too much for small\r\nluxuries which they could easily do without. Moreover, he considers\r\nthe cleverness of his fellow-countrymen of the city, their readiness\r\nto change their opinions and adopt new ideas, their doubts as to the\r\nsuper-sanctity of that individual property, property which is the small\r\nlandowner's god, as evidences of a dangerous disposition to upset all\r\nthat ought to be most solemnly upheld. The townsman, on the other\r\nhand, too often looks down upon the peasant and the rural provincial\r\ngenerally as an ignorant, short-sighted, narrow-minded, grasping\r\ncreature, full of prejudices and eaten up with superstition, who, out\r\nof sheer obstinacy, stands immovably in the way of reforms that might,\r\nand in many cases certainly would, benefit them both.\r\n\r\nIt is the task and the duty of the true statesman to bridge over these\r\ndifferences as far as possible, to try to harmonise interests and\r\nassuage feelings which under existing conditions are apt to conflict\r\nwith one another. Thus only can the whole country be well and truly\r\nserved. M. Thiers pursued precisely the contrary course. In order to\r\nfoster reaction and to strengthen the position of the bourgeoisie, he\r\nand his supporters set to work deliberately to excite the hatred of the\r\ncountry-folk against their brethren of the towns. They were willing to\r\naccept the Republic only on the distinct understanding that it should\r\nbe, as Zola expressed it, a bourgeoised sham. The bogey of the social\r\nrevolution was stuck up daily to frighten the timid property-owners.\r\nAbove all, Paris was pointed out as the danger spot of order-respecting\r\nFrance. Paris ought to be muzzled and kept under even more strictly by\r\nthe self-respecting Republic than by the Empire. That way alone lay\r\nsafety. Thus the dislike of the provincials for the capital was fanned\r\nto so fierce a heat that the very title of capital was denied to her.\r\nAs a result of this unpatriotic and traitorous policy Paris herself\r\nwas unfortunately forced to the conviction that the reactionists of\r\nBordeaux were determined to deprive her of all her rights, and that the\r\ngreat city which founded the Republic would be made to suffer dearly\r\nfor her presumption. Nearly all that followed was in reality due to\r\nthis sinister policy of provocation, adopted and carried out by M.\r\nThiers and his bigoted followers.\r\n\r\nClemenceau's position was a difficult one. Knowing both peasants and\r\nParisians intimately well, he saw clearly the very dangerous situation\r\nwhich must inevitably be created by such tactics of exasperation. As\r\none of the deputies of Radical Republican Paris, he did his utmost\r\nat Bordeaux to maintain the independence of his constituents and to\r\nresist the fatal action of the majority. As the son of a landowner in\r\nLa Vendée, he understood clearly the views of the provincials and how\r\nnecessary it was that they should be thoroughly informed as to the\r\naims of the Parisians. But Paris had first claim on his services. He\r\ntherefore associated himself with Louis Blanc, voted with him against\r\nthe preliminaries of peace and in favour of the continuance of the war.\r\nThere was a strong opinion at this time that many of the Buonapartists\r\nin high military command, as well as in important civil posts, were\r\ntraitors to the Republic and had acted, as Bazaine unquestionably\r\ndid, in the interest of the Imperial prisoner instead of on behalf\r\nof France. These factionists too were hostile to Paris, and a demand\r\nwas made, in which Clemenceau joined, for a full investigation of the\r\nconduct of such men during the siege. Unfortunately, affairs in the\r\ncapital were now becoming so critical and the probability of another\r\nrevolution there seemed so great that Clemenceau felt his duties as\r\nMayor of Montmartre were still more urgent than his votes and speeches\r\nat Bordeaux, as deputy for that district. Consequently, after less than\r\na month's stay at Bordeaux, he returned to Paris on the evening of\r\nMarch 5th. The Commune of Paris was set on foot within a fortnight of\r\nthat date, on March 18th, 1871.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                              THE COMMUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, the revolt was brought about by the ill-judged and\r\narbitrary conduct of the agents of the National Assembly. To attempt\r\nto seize the guns of the National Guard as a preliminary to disarming\r\nthe only Citizen force which the capital had at its disposal was as\r\nillegal as it was provocative. It was virtually a declaration of civil\r\nwar by the reactionaries in control of the national forces. The people\r\nof Paris were in no humour to put up with such high-handed action on\r\nthe part of men who, they knew, were opposed even to the Republic which\r\nthey nominally served. They resisted the attempt and captured the\r\ngenerals, Lecomte and Thomas, who had ordered the step to be taken.\r\n\r\nSo far they were quite within their rights, and Clemenceau at first\r\nsympathised wholly with the Federals. The Parisians had undergone\r\nterrible privations during the siege, they were exasperated by the\r\ndenunciations that poured in upon them from the provinces, they saw\r\nno hope for their recently won liberties unless they themselves were\r\nin a position to defend them, they had grave doubts whether they had\r\nnot been betrayed within and without during the siege itself. It is no\r\nwonder that, under such circumstances, they should resent, by force of\r\narms, any attempt to deprive them of the means of effective resistance\r\nto reactionary repression.\r\n\r\nThere was also nothing in the establishment of the Commune itself which\r\nwas other than a perfectly legitimate effort to organise the city\r\nafresh, after the old system had proved utterly incompetent. But the\r\nattempt to disarm the population of Montmartre roused passions which\r\nit was impossible to quell. Clemenceau, as Mayor of the district, did\r\nall that one man could do to save the two generals, Lecomte and Clément\r\nThomas, from being killed. With his sound judgment he saw at once that,\r\nwhether their execution was justifiable or not, it would be regarded as\r\nmurder by many Republicans whom the cooler heads in Paris desired to\r\nconciliate. As was proved afterwards, he exerted all his power to check\r\neven the semblance of injustice. But his final intervention to prevent\r\nthe tragedy of the Château Rouge came too late, and Lecomte and Thomas,\r\nwho had not hesitated to risk the massacre of innocent citizens on\r\nbehalf of a policy of repression, were regarded as the first victims of\r\nan infuriated mob.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of Clemenceau's own endeavours to save these misguided\r\nmilitarists was that he himself became \"suspect\" to the heads of the\r\nCentral Committee of the Commune sitting at the Hôtel de Ville, which\r\nhad taken control of all Paris. He was the duly elected and extremely\r\npopular Radical-Socialist--to use a later designation--Mayor of perhaps\r\nthe most advanced arrondissement in the capital, he had been sent to\r\nBordeaux by a great majority of his constituents to sit on the extreme\r\nleft, and, in that capacity, had stoutly defended the rights of Paris;\r\nhe was strongly in favour of most of the claims made by the leaders of\r\nthe Commune. But all this went for nothing. The new Committee wanted\r\ntheir own man at Montmartre, and Clemenceau was not that man.\r\n\r\nSo Mayor of Montmartre he ceased to be, but earnest democrat and\r\ndevoted friend of the people he remained. Unfortunately, having a wider\r\noutlook than most of those who had suddenly come to the front, he could\r\nnot believe that mere possession of the capital meant attainment of\r\nthe control of France by the Parisians, or the freeing of his country\r\nfrom German occupation. For once he advocated prudence and suggested\r\ncompromise. A reasonable arrangement between the administrators of\r\nParis with their municipal forces and the National Assembly with\r\nits regular army seemed to Clemenceau a practical necessity of\r\nthe situation. He therefore urged this policy incessantly upon the\r\nCommunists. It was an unlucky experience. Pyat, Vermorel and others so\r\nstrongly resented his moderate counsels that they issued an order for\r\nhis arrest, with a view to his hasty, if judicial, removal. Failing to\r\nlay hold upon Clemenceau himself, they captured a speaking likeness of\r\nthe Radical doctor in the person of a young Brazilian. Him they were\r\nabout to shoot, when they discovered that their proposed victim was\r\nthe wrong man. Possibly these personal adventures in revolutionary\r\ndemocracy under the Commune may have influenced Clemenceau's views\r\nabout Socialism in practical affairs in after life.\r\n\r\nIt is highly creditable to Clemenceau that a few years later one of his\r\ngreatest speeches was delivered in the National Assembly to obtain, the\r\nliberation and the recall from exile of the very same men who would\r\ngladly have silenced him for good and all when they were in power.\r\nHowever, he escaped their well-meant attentions, and, leaving Paris,\r\nwent on a tour of vigorous Radical propaganda through the Provinces.\r\n\r\nThis was a most important self-imposed mission. Clemenceau, as he\r\nshowed by his vote at Bordeaux, was strongly in favour of continuing\r\nthe war and bitterly opposed to any surrender whatever. At the same\r\ntime he was a thoroughgoing Republican who did not forget that the mass\r\nof Frenchmen must have voted for the Empire a few months before, or\r\nNapoleon's plébiscite, of course, could not have been so successful,\r\neven with the whole of the official machinery in the hands of the\r\nImperialists. Differing from Gambetta afterwards on many points, the\r\ncoming leader of the advanced Radicals was at this period entirely at\r\none with the man who had not despaired of France when all seemed lost.\r\nBut in order to carry on the war with any hope of success and to keep\r\nthe flag of the Republic flying, it was essential that the people of\r\nthe provincial towns and the peasants should be kept in touch with\r\nParis and be convinced that the only chance of safety and freedom\r\nlay in sinking all internecine differences for the sake of unity. No\r\nman, not even Gambetta himself, was better qualified for this service.\r\nThroughout his tour he kept the independence, welfare and freedom of\r\nFrance as a whole high above all other considerations. But the risks he\r\nran were not trifling. The local reactionists were by no means ready\r\nto accept his views. The police was set upon his trail, with great\r\ninconvenience to himself. But at no period of his life has Clemenceau\r\nconsidered his personal safety of any account. He had set himself to\r\naccomplish certain work which he deemed to be necessary, and he carried\r\nit through without reference to the dangers around him. Nor must the\r\nsuccess of this propaganda be measured by its immediate results. The\r\ngreat thing in those days of defeat and despair was to keep up the\r\nnational spirit and to declare that, though the French armies might\r\nbe beaten again and again, the France of the great Revolution and\r\nthe Republic should never be crushed down. Believing, as Clemenceau\r\ndid, in the religion of patriotism and the sacred watchwords of the\r\neighteenth-century upheaval, he spoke with a sincerity that gave to his\r\nutterances the value of the highest oratory. The speeches produced a\r\npermanent impression on those who heard them, and their effect was felt\r\nfor many years afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut this was quite as objectionable to Thiers and the case-hardened\r\nreactionists as his previous conduct had been to Pyat and the\r\nextremists of the Commune. Men of ability and judgment are apt to be\r\ncaught between two fires when prejudice and passion take control on\r\nboth sides. It was, in fact, little short of a miracle that the future\r\nPrime Minister of France did not complete his services to his country\r\nby dying in the ditch under the wall of Père-la-Chaise at the early age\r\nof thirty-one.\r\n\r\nFew movements have been more grotesquely misrepresented than the\r\nCommune of Paris. For many a long year afterwards almost the whole of\r\nthe propertied classes in Europe spoke of the Communists as if they had\r\nbeen a gang of scoundrels and incendiaries, without a single redeeming\r\nquality; while Socialists naturally enough refused to listen to\r\nvirulent abuse of men most of whom they well knew were inspired by the\r\nhighest ideals and sacrificed themselves for what they believed to be\r\nthe good of mankind. At the beginning Paris assuredly had no intention\r\nwhatever of courting a struggle with the supporters of the Republic at\r\nBordeaux, however reactionary they might be. Such men as Delescluze,\r\nCourbet, Beslay, Jourde, Camélinat, Vaillant, Longuet, to speak only\r\nof a few, were no mere hot-headed revolutionaries regardless of all\r\nthe facts around them. Paris was admirably administered under their\r\nshort rule--never nearly so well, according to the testimony of two\r\nquite conservative Englishmen who were there at the time. One of these\r\nwas the famous Oxford sculler and athlete, E. B. Michell, an English\r\nbarrister and a French _avocat_; the other was my late brother, Hugh,\r\na Magdalen man like Michell. They both knew Paris well, and both were\r\nof the same opinion as to the municipal management under the Commune.\r\nMichell in an article in _Fraser's Magazine_, then an important review,\r\nwrote as follows:\r\n\r\n \"It is extremely important that the serious lesson which the world\r\n may read in the history of the Revolution should not be weakened in\r\n its significance or interest by any ill-grounded contempt either\r\n for the acts of the Communal leaders or for the sincerity of their\r\n motives. We have seen that the army on which the Revolutionists\r\n relied, and by means of which they climbed to power, was not, as\r\n certain French statesmen pretended, and some English papers would\r\n have had us believe, a 'mere handful of disorderly rebels,' but\r\n a compact force, well drilled, well organised, and valiant when\r\n fighting for a cause that they really had at heart. It is equally\r\n false and unfair to regard the Communal Assembly as a crew of\r\n unintelligent and mischievous conspirators, guided by no definite\r\n or reasonable principle, and seeking only their own aggrandisement\r\n and the destruction of all the recognised laws of order. Yet it is\r\n certain that such an idea respecting the Commune is very generally\r\n entertained by ordinary English readers. It may be shown that the\r\n policy of this Government, though defaced by many gross abuses and\r\n errors, had much in it to deserve the consideration, and even to\r\n extort the admiration, of an intelligent and practical statesman. . . .\r\n\r\n \"Foreign writers have delighted to represent the purposes of the\r\n Commune as vague and unintelligible. Even in Paris and at Versailles\r\n writers and talkers affected at first to be ignorant of the real\r\n projects and principles entertained by the Revolutionists. But the\r\n Commune of 1871 has itself destroyed all possibility of mistake upon\r\n the subject. It has put to itself and answered the question in the\r\n most explicit terms. The _Journal Officiel_ (of Paris) contained, on\r\n April 20th, a document worthy of the most careful perusal. It appears\r\n in the form of a declaration to the French people, and explains fully\r\n enough the main principles and the chief objects which animated the\r\n men of the Commune. Without bestowing on this address the ecstatic\r\n eulogies to which certain Utopian philosophers have deemed it\r\n entitled, we may credit it as being a straightforward, manly, and not\r\n altogether unpractical _exposé_ of the ideas of modern Communists.\r\n\r\n \". . . 'It is the duty of the Commune to confirm and determine the\r\n aspirations and wishes of the people of Paris; to explain, in its\r\n true character, the movement of March 18th--a movement which has been\r\n up to this time misunderstood, misconstrued, and calumniated by the\r\n politicians at Versailles. Once more Paris labours and suffers for\r\n the whole of France, for whom she is preparing, by her battles and\r\n her devoted sacrifices, an intellectual, moral, administrative, and\r\n economic regeneration, an era of glory and prosperity.\r\n\r\n \"'What does she demand?\r\n\r\n \"'The recognition and consolidation of the Republic as the only form\r\n of government compatible with the rights of the people and the regular\r\n and free development of society; the absolute independence of the\r\n Commune and its extension to every locality in France; the assurance\r\n by this means to each person of his rights in their integrity, to\r\n every Frenchman the full exercise of his faculties and capacities as\r\n a man, a citizen, and an artificer. The independence of the Commune\r\n will have but one limit--the equal right of independence to be enjoyed\r\n by the other Communes who shall adhere to the contract. It is the\r\n association of these Communes that must secure the unity of France.\r\n\r\n \"'The inherent rights of the Commune are these: The right of voting\r\n the Communal budget of receipts and expenditure, of regulating and\r\n reforming the system of taxation, and of directing local services; the\r\n right to organise its own magistracy, the internal police and public\r\n education; to administer the property belonging to the Commune; the\r\n right of choosing by election or competition, with responsibility and\r\n a permanent right of control and revocation, the communal magistrates\r\n and officials of all sorts; the right of individual liberty under an\r\n absolute guarantee, liberty of conscience and liberty of labour; the\r\n right of permanent intervention by the citizens in communal affairs by\r\n means of the free manifestation of their ideas, and a free defence of\r\n their own interests, guarantees being given for such manifestations\r\n by the Commune, which is alone charged with the duty of guarding and\r\n securing the free and just right of meeting and of publicity; the\r\n right of organising the urban defences and the National Guard, which\r\n is to elect its own chiefs, and alone provide for the maintenance of\r\n order in the cities.\r\n\r\n \"'Paris desires no more than this, with the condition, of course,\r\n that she shall find in the Grand Central Administration, composed\r\n of delegates from the Federal Communes, the practical recognition\r\n and realisation of the same principles. To insure, however, her own\r\n independence, and as a natural result of her own freedom of action,\r\n Paris reserves to herself the liberty of effecting as she may think\r\n fit, in her own sphere, those administrative and economic reforms\r\n which her population shall demand, of creating such institutions as\r\n are proper for developing and extending education, labour, commerce,\r\n and credit; of popularising the enjoyment of power and property in\r\n accordance with the necessities of the hour, the wish of all persons\r\n interested, and the data furnished by experience. Our enemies deceive\r\n themselves or deceive the country when they accuse Paris of desiring\r\n to impose its will or its supremacy upon the rest of the nation, and\r\n of aspiring to a Dictatorship which would amount to a veritable attack\r\n against the independence and sovereignty of other Communes. They\r\n deceive themselves or the country when they accuse Paris of seeking\r\n the destruction of French unity as established by the Revolution.\r\n The unity which has hitherto been imposed upon us by the Empire,\r\n the Monarchy, and the Parliamentary Government is nothing but a\r\n centralisation, despotic, unintelligent, arbitrary, and burdensome.\r\n Political unity as desired by Paris is a voluntary association of\r\n each local initiative, a free and spontaneous co-operation of all\r\n individual energies with one common object--the well-being, liberty,\r\n and security of all. The Communal Revolution initiated by the people\r\n on the 18th of March inaugurated a new political era, experimental,\r\n positive, and scientific. It was the end of the old official and\r\n clerical world, of military and bureaucratic _régime_, of jobbing in\r\n monopolies and privileges, to which the working class owed its state\r\n of servitude, and our country its misfortunes and disasters.'\"\r\n\r\nThe two Englishmen, coming straight to my house from Paris, gave me a\r\nfavourable account of the administration of municipal Paris, especially\r\nat the time when Cluseret held command.\r\n\r\nOthers who were there at the same time were similarly impressed. Paris\r\nceased even to be the Corinth of Europe, since all prostitutes had been\r\nordered out of the city. The leaders set an example of moderation in\r\ntheir style of living, which was the more remarkable as they had no\r\nauthority but their own sense of propriety to limit their expenditure.\r\nHow little they regarded themselves as relieved from the ordinary rules\r\nof the strictest bourgeois social order is apparent, also, from the\r\nfact that Jourde and Beslay, who were responsible for the finances of\r\nthe Commune, actually borrowed £40,000 from the Rothschilds in order\r\nto carry on the ordinary business of the Municipality. Yet at the\r\ntime not less than £60,000,000 in gold, apart from a huge store of\r\nsilver, was lying at their mercy in the Bank of France; enough, as some\r\ncynically said, if judiciously used, to have bought up all M. Thiers'\r\nGovernment and his army to boot. The fact that the Communists left\r\nthese vast accumulations untouched proves conclusively that they were\r\nthe least predatory, some might say the least effective, revolutionists\r\nwho ever held subversive opinions. In all directions they showed the\r\nsame spirit. Every department was managed as economically and capably\r\nas they could organise it. But always on the most approved bourgeois\r\nlines. Many of the reforms they introduced, notably those by Camélinat\r\nat the Mint, are still maintained.\r\n\r\nHow, then, did it come about that people of this character and capacity\r\nwere regarded almost universally as desperate enemies of society,\r\nfrom the moment when they came to the front in their own city? It is\r\nthe old story of the hatred of the materialist property-owner and\r\nprofiteer for the idealist who is eager at once to realise the new\r\nperiod of public possession and co-operative well-being. The fact\r\nthat such an indomitable anarchist-communist as the famous Blanqui,\r\nwho spent the greater part of his life in prison, took an active part\r\nin the Commune and that others of like views were associated with\r\nthe rising scared all the \"respectable\" classes, who regarded any\r\nattack upon the existing economic and social forms as a crime of the\r\nworst description. A tale current at the time puts the matter in a\r\nhumorous shape. A number of communists, when arrested, were put in\r\ngaol with a still larger number of common malefactors. These latter\r\ngreatly resented this intrusion, boycotted the political prisoners,\r\nand, it is said, would have gone so far as to attack their unwelcome\r\ncompanions but for the intervention of the warders. Asked why they\r\nexhibited such animosity towards men who had done them no harm, the\r\nordinary criminals took quite a conservative, bourgeois view of their\r\nrelations to the new-comers. \"We,\" they said, \"have some of us taken\r\nthings which belonged to other people; but we have never thought for a\r\nmoment of abolishing the right of property in itself. Not having enough\r\nourselves, we wanted more and laid hands upon what we could get. But\r\nthese men would take everything and leave nothing for us.\" So even the\r\ngaol-birds embraced the bourgeois ethic of individual ownership.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the International Working Men's Association had been founded\r\nin London in 1864, just seven years before. Although the late Professor\r\nBeesly, certainly as far from a violent revolutionist as any man could\r\nbe, took the chair at the first meeting and English trade unionists\r\nof the most sober character constituted the bulk of the members in\r\nLondon, the terror which this organisation inspired in the dominant\r\nminority all over Europe was very far indeed in excess of the power\r\nwhich it could at any time exercise. But the names of Marx, the learned\r\nGerman-Jew philosopher, and Bakunin, the Russian peasant-anarchist,\r\nwere words of dread to the comfortable classes in those days. Marx\r\nwith Engels had written the celebrated \"Communist Manifesto,\" at the\r\nlast period of European disturbance, in 1848, analysing the historic\r\ndevelopment and approaching downfall of the entire wage-earning system,\r\nwith a ruthless disregard for the feelings of the bourgeoisie. Its\r\nconclusion appealing to the \"Workers of the World\" to unite was not\r\nunnaturally regarded as a direct incitement to combined revolt. Though,\r\ntherefore, few had read the Manifesto this appeal had echoed far and\r\nwide, and the organisation of the International itself was credited\r\nwith the intention to use the Commune of Paris as the starting-point\r\nfor a world-wide conflagration. Thus the movement in Paris, which\r\nat first had no other object than to secure the stability of the\r\ndemocratic Republic, was regarded as an incendiary revolt, and the\r\nbrutal outrages of M. Thiers, aided by the mistakes of the Communists\r\nthemselves, gradually forced extremists to the front. Some were like\r\nDelescluze, noble enthusiasts who knew success was impossible, and\r\ncourted death for their ideal as sowing the seed of success for their\r\ngreat cause of the universal Co-operative Commonwealth in the near\r\nfuture; others were such as Félix Pyat, a furious subversionist of the\r\nmost ruffianly type, who mixed up personal malignity and individual\r\nhatred with his every action, and brought discredit on his own\r\ncomrades. Victory for the Socialist ideals, with the Germans containing\r\none side of Paris and the Versailles troops attacking the other,\r\nwas impossible--would have been impossible even if the Communists\r\nhad suppressed their truly fraternal hatreds and had developed a\r\nmilitary genius. They did neither. Cluseret showed some inkling of\r\nthe necessities of the case, but Dombrowski, Rossel and other leaders\r\nexhibited no capacity. The wonderful thing about it all was that during\r\nthe crisis, which lasted two months, Paris was so well administered.\r\nThe sacrifice of the hostages and the tactics of incendiarism pursued\r\nat last, not by the Communist leaders, but by the Anarchist mob broken\r\nloose from all control, have hidden from the public at large, who read\r\nonly the prejudiced accounts of the capitalist press, the real truth\r\nabout the Commune of Paris.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may have been done in resistance to the invasion of M.\r\nThiers' army of reaction, nothing could possibly justify the horrible\r\nvengeance wreaked upon the people of Paris by the soldiery and their\r\nchiefs. It was a martyrdom of the great city. The _coup d'état_ of\r\nLouis Napoleon was child's play to the hideous butchery ordered and\r\nrejoiced in by Thiers, Gallifet and their subordinates. There was not\r\neven a pretence of justice in the whole massacre. Thousands of unarmed\r\nand innocent men and women were slaughtered in cold blood because\r\nParis was feared by the bloodthirsty clique who regarded her rightly\r\nas the main obstacle to their reactionary policy. It was but too\r\nclear evidence that, when the rights of property are supposed to be\r\nimperilled, all sense of decency or humanity will be outraged by the\r\ndominant minority as it was by the slave-owners of old or the nobles\r\nof the feudal times.\r\n\r\nBut the Commune itself, as matters stood, was as hopeless an attempt to\r\n\"make twelve o'clock at eleven\" as has ever been seen on the planet.\r\nJohn Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry was not more certainly foredoomed\r\nto failure than was the uprising of the Communists of Paris in 1871.\r\nBut the Socialists of Europe, like the abolitionists, have celebrated\r\nthe Commune and deified its martyrs for many a long year. The brave\r\nand unselfish champions of the proletariat who then laid down their\r\nlives in the hope that their deaths might hasten on the coming of a\r\nbetter day hold the same position in the minds of Socialists that John\r\nBrown held among the friends of the negro prior to the great American\r\nCivil War. It was an outburst of noble enthusiasm on their part to\r\nface certain failure for the \"solidarity of the human race.\" But those\r\nwho watched what happened then and afterwards can scarcely escape from\r\nthe conclusion that the loss of so many of its ablest leaders, and the\r\ngreat discouragement engendered by the horrors of defeat, threw back\r\nSocialism itself in France fully twenty years.\r\n\r\nRecent experience in several directions has shown the world that\r\nenthusiasm and idealism for the great cause of human progress, and the\r\nco-ordination of social forces in the interest of the revolutionary\r\nmajority of mankind, cannot of themselves change the course of events.\r\nUnless the stage in economic development has been reached where a new\r\norder has already been evolved out of the previous outworn system, it\r\nis impossible to realise the ideals of the new period by any sudden\r\nattack. Men imbued with the highest conceptions of the future and\r\npersonally quite honest in their conduct may utterly fail to apply\r\nplain common sense to the facts of the present. Dublin, Petrograd and\r\nHelsingfors, nearly forty years later, did but enforce the teachings of\r\nthe Commune of Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                        CLEMENCEAU THE RADICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this Clemenceau, though not himself a Socialist, saw by intuition.\r\nHis powers of organisation and capacity for inspiring confidence among\r\nthe people might have been of the greatest service to Paris at that\r\ncritical juncture in her history--might even have averted the crash\r\nwhich laid so large a portion of the buildings of the great city in\r\nruins and led to the infamous scenes already referred to. This was not\r\nto be, and Clemenceau was fortunate to escape the fate of many who were\r\nas little guilty of terrorism or arson as himself.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the men responsible for the death of Generals Lecomte\r\nand Thomas was held on November 29th, 1871. Clemenceau himself was\r\naccused of not having done enough to save their lives. He was in no\r\nwise responsible for what had occurred, was strongly opposed to their\r\nexecution, and, as has been seen, did all that he could do to prevent\r\nthe two assailants of his own friends and fellow-citizens from being\r\nkilled. That, however, was no security that he would have escaped\r\ncondemnation if the evidence in his favour had not been so conclusive\r\nthat even the prejudiced court could not decide against him. He was\r\ncompletely cleared from the charge by the evidence of Colonel Langlois,\r\nand given full credit for his efforts on behalf of the militarists who\r\ncertainly could be reckoned among his most bitter enemies. Scarcely,\r\nhowever, was his life relieved from jeopardy under the law than he was\r\ncompelled to risk it, or so he thought, on the duelling ground. Here\r\nClemenceau was quite at home. He used his remarkable skill in handling\r\nthe pistol with moderation and judgment, being content to wound his\r\nadversary, Commandant Poussages, in the leg. None the less, the result\r\nof his encounter was that he was fined and committed to prison for a\r\nfortnight as a lesson to him not to act in accordance with the French\r\ncode of honour in future.\r\n\r\nBut the truth is, M. Thiers did not wish to make a peaceful settlement\r\nwith the people of the capital of France. Conciliation itself was\r\nbranded as a crime as much by the political leaders and military chiefs\r\non his side as it was by the Communist extremists on the other. The\r\nVersaillais aimed at the conquest of Paris by force of arms: they did\r\nnot desire to enter peacefully by force of agreement. And having won,\r\nParis was treated by the Republican Government as a conquered city. All\r\nsorts of exceptional laws, such as Napoleon III himself never enacted,\r\nwere registered against the liberties of her inhabitants, and she was\r\ndeprived of her fair share of representation in the National Assembly.\r\nThe capital of France was a criminal city.\r\n\r\nClemenceau on March 21st, 1871, had brought into the National Assembly\r\nat Versailles a measure which established the Municipal Council of\r\nParis with 80 members. This was a valuable service to the capital and\r\none of which the man himself was destined to take advantage. For,\r\nhaving failed to bring about a reasonable compromise between the\r\nVersailles chiefs and the leaders of the Commune, and having also lost\r\nhis seat for Montmartre in the Assembly as well as the Mayoralty of\r\nthat district, he gave up general politics and after the fall of the\r\nCommune accepted his election as Municipal Councillor for Clignancourt.\r\nHe devoted the next five years of his life to his doctor's work, giving\r\ngratuitous advice as before to her poor around him, and to constant\r\nattendance as a Municipal Councillor, where he was the leader of the\r\nradical section. He thus gained a knowledge of Parisian life and the\r\nneeds of Parisians which no other experience could have given him.\r\n\r\nAs one of the municipal representatives he never ceased to protest\r\nagainst the shameful legislation which deprived Paris of its rights.\r\nBut he did more. The man who is regarded by many, even to-day, as\r\nessentially a political destroyer with no idea of a constructive policy\r\nin any department made himself master of the details of municipal\r\nadministration and was a most valued colleague of all who, acting on\r\nthe extreme left of the Council, endeavoured, while upholding the\r\ndignity of the city against the repressive policy of the Government, to\r\nimprove the management of city affairs in every department. In this he\r\nwas as successful as the circumstances of the time permitted. He became\r\nin turn Secretary, Vice-President and President of the Council.\r\n\r\nThough this portion of Clemenceau's career is little known, the\r\ncontinuous unrecognised municipal service he rendered to Paris during\r\nthose eventful years gave him a hold not only upon Montmartre but\r\nupon the whole city which has been of great service to him at other\r\ntimes. He had, in fact, become a thorough Parisian from the age of\r\nnineteen onwards, which can by no means always be said of men who\r\nhave afterwards taken a leading part in French politics. It is very\r\ndifficult to say what qualities are those which entitle a man to this\r\ndistinguished appellation. I have myself known Frenchmen able, witty,\r\nbrilliant and original, good speakers and clever writers, who somehow\r\nnever seemed to be at home with Parisians and Parisian audiences.\r\nCritical and cynical, though at times enthusiastic and idealist, the\r\nParisian crowd takes no man at his own valuation and is no less fickle\r\nthan crowds in cities generally are. But Clemenceau has never failed\r\nto be on good terms with them. I attribute this to the fact that in\r\naddition to his other higher qualities, which impress all people of\r\nintelligence, Clemenceau has in him a vein of sheer humorous mischief\r\nthat savours of the Parisian _gamin_ rather than of the hard-working\r\nstudent from La Vendée. There is something in common between him and\r\nthe young rogues of the Parisian streets who are not at all averse from\r\nenjoying life at the cost of poking fun at other people and even at\r\nthemselves. This spirit of Paris early got hold of Clemenceau and he of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, on February 26th, 1876, he was again elected\r\ndeputy to the National Assembly. He now began the active and continuous\r\npolitical life which had been broken off at its commencement by the\r\nsecond revolution followed by the gruesome tragedy just recounted.\r\n\r\nThat he had never lost his sympathy for the men and women of the\r\nCommune, little reason as he personally had for good feeling towards\r\nthem, was, proved by his delivery of his speech in favour of the\r\nAmnesty of the Communists, some of whom had been so eager to get\r\nrid of him for good and all when they had been in power for a short\r\ntime themselves. The speech at once put Clemenceau among the first\r\nParliamentary orators of the day. At this time a man of such capacity\r\nwas greatly needed on the extreme left. Others, who had lost much of\r\ntheir energy and fervour in the long struggle against repression,\r\nwere little inclined to run further risks for the sake of a really\r\ndemocratic Republic, still less for a set of people who in their\r\nmisguided efforts for complete freedom had endangered the establishment\r\nof any Republic at all. They were content with what they had done\r\nbefore and with the positions they occupied then. It was greatly to\r\nClemenceau's credit that he did not hesitate a moment as to the line he\r\nshould take. Popular or unpopular, fair play and freedom for all were\r\nhis watchwords.\r\n\r\nWhen the Amnesty question came up again in 1879 Clemenceau's speech in\r\nfavour of the release of the indefatigable Communist Blanqui was, like\r\nhis appeal for the amnesty of the members of the Commune generally,\r\nvery creditable to him, for it was an unpopular move and gained him\r\nlittle useful political support from any party. Perhaps no man in\r\nthe whole history of the revolutionary movement ever devoted himself\r\nso entirely and with such relentless determination to the spread of\r\nsubversive doctrines as Auguste Blanqui. He began early and finished\r\nlate. He was first imprisoned at the age of twenty-one and spent more\r\nthan half of his seventy-six years of existence in gaol or exile. He\r\nwas a strong believer in organised violence as a means of bringing\r\nabout the realisation of his communist ideals. Insurrection against\r\nthe successive French Governments he regarded as a duty. It was a duty\r\nwhich he faithfully fulfilled. In 1827 he was an active fighter in the\r\ninsurrection of the Rue St. Denis. It was suppressed and Blanqui was\r\nwounded. He was one of the leaders of the successful rising against\r\nCharles X in 1830, in which he was again wounded. In the reign of\r\nLouis Philippe, which followed the failure to establish a Republic, he\r\nspeedily went to work again. Insurrection, conspiracy, establishment of\r\nillegal societies, accumulation of weapons and explosives for organised\r\nattacks, attempts to constitute a communist republic, were followed by\r\nthe usual penalties, and after his participation in the insurrection\r\nof the Montagnards, by condemnation to death commuted to imprisonment\r\nfor life. Such was Blanqui's career up to 1848. Then the revolution\r\nof that year set him free again. No sooner was he released than he\r\nbegan afresh, forming a revolutionary combination which led to another\r\nthree days of insurrection, with the result that he was sentenced to a\r\nfurther ten years of imprisonment. In 1858, under the Second Empire,\r\nhe returned to Paris, his birthplace, but was soon ejected and passed\r\neight years more in exile. In 1870 and 1871 Blanqui took part in the\r\noverthrow of Napoleon III, and in the Commune which followed, was\r\ncaptured by the Versaillais troops and sentenced to transportation to\r\nNew Caledonia, after the Communards had offered to exchange for him the\r\nArchbishop of Paris, then held by them as a hostage. Instead of being\r\nshipped off to New Caledonia he was imprisoned at Clairvaux, where he\r\nremained until 1880, when he was elected, while still in gaol, deputy\r\nfor Bordeaux, was not allowed to take his seat but was released, and\r\ndied in Paris in 1881.\r\n\r\nThis brief summary gives but a poor idea of Blanqui's activities and\r\nsufferings. At the period when Clemenceau pleaded for his release he\r\nwas still, at seventy-one, the most dangerous revolutionary leader in\r\nFrance. From the first and throughout he was absolutely uncompromising\r\nin his adherence to his communist theories, and, being at the same time\r\nof dictatorial tendencies, he was an extremely difficult man to work\r\nwith. None the less Blanqui represented the highest type of educated\r\nanarchist. He never considered himself for a moment. So long as he was\r\nable to keep the flag of revolution flying, and thus to prepare the\r\nway, by constant attempts at direct action, for the period when the\r\npeople would be strong enough and well-organised enough to achieve\r\nvictory for themselves, he was satisfied. A leader of his knowledge and\r\ncapacity must have known and did know that his views could not possibly\r\nbe accepted and acted upon, even if scientifically correct for a later\r\ndate, at the stage of evolution which France had reached in his day.\r\nBut, like Raspail, Delescluze, Amilcare Cipriani, Sophie Perovskaia,\r\nand more than one of the French dynamitical anarchists, he deliberately\r\nsacrificed his whole career, as he also risked his life time after\r\ntime, in desperate efforts to uplift the mass of the people from\r\ntheir state of economic and social degradation. Nothing daunted him.\r\nHis courage was of that exceptional quality which is strengthened by\r\ndefeat. Even his bitterest enemies respected his devotion to his cause,\r\nhis disregard of danger and the spirit he maintained, in spite of years\r\nupon years of confinement. He hated and despised the bourgeoisie, with\r\ntheir capitalist wage-earning, profit-making system, even more than he\r\ndid monarchy and aristocracy. He revolted against the slow processes\r\nof social evolution, as he did against the inherited wrongs of class\r\nrepression. No weapon of agitation came amiss to him. Journalist,\r\npamphleteer, author, orator, organiser, conspirator, he covered in his\r\nown person the whole of the ground open to a convinced revolutionist.\r\nThe suppressive order of to-day must be smashed up to give an outlet\r\nto the liberative order of to-morrow. Such a programme was in direct\r\nopposition to the ideas of Clemenceau, who, individualist as he is,\r\nhas always regarded political action and trade organisation of a\r\npeaceful nature as the best means of attaining thorough reform and\r\nsocial reconstruction without running the risk of provoking monarchist\r\nor imperialist repression. Blanqui to him was an idealist who, by\r\nhis very honesty and singleness of purpose, played into the hands of\r\nreaction, when he spent so much of his life as he lived outside of a\r\nprison in one broken but relentless effort to overthrow the existing\r\nsociety of inequality and wage-slavery by the same forcible methods\r\nthat capitalist society itself uses to maintain the system in being.\r\nOn the other hand, the right to freedom of person and freedom of\r\nexpression was erected by the Radical leader into something not far\r\nfrom an intellectual religion. On this ground, therefore, he argued\r\nstrongly in favour of Blanqui's release, though quite possibly, and\r\nindeed probably, Blanqui's freedom, had it been secured, would have\r\nbeen vigorously used against Clemenceau and his party--whom the great\r\nAnarchist-Communist would have regarded as mere trimmers--to the\r\nadvantage of the reactionists themselves. But in this case as in that\r\nof the amnesty to the Communists, the Clemenceau of the Rights of Man\r\nand Liberty, Equality and Fraternity overcame Clemenceau the practical\r\npolitician. That he failed to get Blanqui out of prison could only have\r\nbeen expected, having regard to the character of the Assembly to which\r\nhis appeal is addressed.\r\n\r\nHis Amnesty speech made a fine beginning for Clemenceau's active\r\nParliamentary life. It put him on a very different level from that\r\noccupied by the mere political adventurers and intriguers whose main\r\nobjects were either to help on the reconstitution of some form of\r\nmonarchy or to secure for themselves posts under the Republic of much\r\nthe same kind as existed under the Empire. Men who but yesterday had\r\nbeen champions of a genuine Republic in which the interests of the\r\nmajority of the French people should be considered first, foremost and\r\nall the time had now become mere plotters for reaction, or opportunists\r\nanxious never to find an opportunity. They were Republicans in name\r\nbut not in spirit. They were convinced that the most important portion\r\nof their policy consisted henceforth not in organising the factor of\r\ndemocracy for general progress but in reassuring their conservative\r\nopponents and the propertied classes generally, from the plutocrat to\r\nthe peasant proprietor, that the Republic meant only a convenient form\r\nof government, in which all classes should agree harmoniously together\r\nto stand at ease for the next few generations. Their arguments in\r\nfavour of such a scheme of permanent repose were unfortunately only\r\ntoo striking. They had but to recall the downfall of the Commune and\r\nto point to the ruins of fine public buildings to appeal effectively\r\nto the feelings of a large and influential portion of the people.\r\nEnthusiasm had become suspect, idealism the antechamber to violent\r\nmania, even Radicalism a vain thing.\r\n\r\nGambetta himself, regarded in England as the most eloquent and capable\r\nleader of the Republican party, invented an excuse for the existence\r\nof the Republic which he had taken an active part in creating, by the\r\nformula, \"It is that which divides us the least.\" Indifference on\r\nevery important question except colonial expansion became the highest\r\npolitical wisdom. It was, in fact, hesitating opportunism and cowardly\r\ncompromise which then dominated France. Such tactics evoked no loyalty\r\nand solved no problem. The old became cynical, the young contemptuous.\r\nTo attack such flabby consistency in doing nothing seemed as bootless\r\nan enterprise as entering into conflict with a feather-bed. The early\r\nyears of the French Republic constituted a period of apathy led,\r\nwith one or two exceptions, by mediocrity. Even the scathing sarcasm\r\nand biting irony of Rochefort failed to produce any serious effect\r\nupon the smug stolidity of the rest-and-be-thankful representatives\r\nof the French middle class. Hence arose \"a divorce between politics\r\nand thought,\" and men of capacity became disgusted with the form of\r\ngovernment itself. All this played directly into the hands of reaction\r\nand was preparing the way for a series of attempts against the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt was at this unhopeful period of stagnation, compromise and\r\nmediocrity that Clemenceau came to the front as leader of the\r\nLeft in the National Assembly. He at once showed that he had every\r\nqualification for this important position--never more important than\r\nwhen there was a conspiracy afoot to prove to the world that there\r\nwas no Radical Left at all. At the time he entered the Assembly in\r\n1876 Clemenceau was thirty-five years of age, with an irreproachable\r\npast behind him and the full confidence of the Republicans of Paris\r\naround him. In his work in Montmartre and on the Municipal Council the\r\npeople had come to know what manner of man he was. Without their steady\r\nsupport it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for him to\r\ncarry on the uphill fight he fought for so many years. His principles\r\nupon every subject of public policy were from the first clear and well\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nFreedom of person, of speech and of the press were cardinal points\r\nin his programme. He demanded that Paris should be released from\r\nall exceptional measures of repression inflicted by the so-called\r\nConservatives upon the whole of the inhabitants of the capital as\r\nrevenge for the rash action of a small number of fanatical idealists\r\nand as a means of keeping down any agitation against their own\r\ncorruption and incompetence. He claimed also that no perpetual\r\ndisability, in the shape of imprisonment and exile, should attach to\r\nthe members of the Commune of Paris, and he called for the fullest\r\npardon and freedom even for the irreconcilable Anarchist, Blanqui.\r\nOn questions of political rights, universal secular education, the\r\nseparation of Church and State, the generous treatment of the rank and\r\nfile of the army, the prevention of the intrigues of the Catholics,\r\nand the expulsion of the Jesuits, Clemenceau took the line of an\r\nout-and-out democrat. So, likewise, in regard to the treatment of the\r\nworking classes. Though not really a Socialist, the Radical leader\r\nrecognised clearly the infinite hardships suffered by the wage-earners\r\nunder the capitalist system, and proposed and supported palliative\r\nlegislation to lessen and redress their wrongs. In foreign affairs\r\nhe was a man of peace, never forgetting the outrages committed by\r\nthe German armies in the war nor the territory seized and the huge\r\nindemnity exacted by the German Government at the peace; but hoping\r\nalways that the friendly development of the peoples of both France and\r\nGermany might avert further antagonism and eventually lead to a full\r\nunderstanding which would assuage the hatreds of the past and lay the\r\nfoundations of mutual good feeling in the future. To colonisation by\r\nconquest and colonial adventures generally Clemenceau was steadfastly\r\nopposed. The entire policy of expansion he regarded as injurious to the\r\ntrue interests of the country, diverting to doubtful enterprises abroad\r\nresources which were required for the development of Republican France\r\nat home. Such colonial schemes also were apt to create difficulties and\r\neven to risk wars with other nations which could in no wise benefit the\r\npeople, while they might strengthen the financiers whose malefic power\r\nwas already too great.\r\n\r\nSuch in brief was the general policy which Clemenceau set himself to\r\nformulate and put to the front on behalf of the only party which at\r\nthat moment could exercise any serious influence in the political\r\nworld. The whole programme was closely knit together, and for\r\nmany years stood the brunt of the bitterest Parliamentary warfare\r\nconceivable. It was a conflict of ideas that Clemenceau entered upon.\r\nHe conducted it throughout on the most approved principle of all\r\nwarfare: Never fail to attack in order to defend. The advice of the\r\nAmerican banker, \"David Harum,\" might have been enunciated as the motto\r\nof Georges Clemenceau the French statesman: \"Do unto others as they\r\nwould do unto you, and do it _first_.\"\r\n\r\nBut the main point of all, that which assured and confirmed and\r\nstrengthened his leadership under the most difficult and dangerous\r\ncircumstances, was his resolute opposition to compromise. This was\r\ncontrary to all the ideas of political strategy and tactics which then\r\nprevailed in France. \"Men became Ministers solely on condition that\r\nthey refused when in power to do that which they had promised when\r\nin opposition\"--quite the English method, in fact. He himself never\r\nfailed to denounce nominal Republicans who set themselves stubbornly\r\nagainst reform and progress in every shape, as mere reactionists in\r\ndisguise. They were, in fact, the staunch buttresses of that bourgeois\r\nRepublic of which Clemenceau not long afterwards said to me, \"_La\r\nRépublique, mon ami, c'est l'Empire républicanisé_.\" It was indeed a\r\nrepublicanised Empire which best suited the leading French politicians\r\nof that day. For at first bourgeois domination of the narrowest and\r\nmeanest kind, leading, so the reactionaries hoped, to the restoration\r\nof the monarchy, had its will of Paris and all that Paris at its best\r\nstood for. As we look back upon that period of pettifoggery in high\r\nplaces, the wonder is that the Royalists were not successful. If they\r\nhad had a king worth fighting for they might have been; for more than\r\none President was certainly not unfavourable to the monarchy or empire.\r\nPrime Ministers were similarly tainted with reaction, and the army was\r\nnone too loyal to the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                      FROM GAMBETTA TO CLEMENCEAU\r\n\r\n\r\nMedici, Mazarin, Riquetti-Mirabeau, Buonaparte, Gambetta--these names\r\nrecall the great influence which Italians have had upon French affairs.\r\nFew, if any, nations have allowed persons of foreign extraction to lead\r\nthem as France permitted the five recorded above. Much, too, as these\r\nItalians were affected by their French surroundings, there is something\r\nin them all quite different from what we regard as distinctively French\r\nintelligence and general capacity. Possibly that gave them their power\r\nof control. They had that faculty of detachment, of looking at the\r\nsituation from without, which is so invaluable to anyone who has to\r\nplay a great part in the world. Some of them could so far survey, as\r\nwell as enter into, the peculiarities of the French mind that they\r\ncould play upon its weaknesses as well as call forth its strength.\r\nYet, with all their genius, the four men named failed to accomplish\r\nwhat they set out to achieve, and none left behind him amid his own\r\nimmediate followers those who were capable of carrying on his work.\r\n\r\nLéon Gambetta had but fourteen years of active political life, and\r\nduring only eleven of those years was he in a position to make himself\r\nseriously felt. But what an amazing career this was of the grocer's boy\r\nof Cahors who stirred all France to enthusiastic support or ferocious\r\ndenunciation between 1871 and 1882! When William Morris died, the\r\ndoctor who attended him was asked what he died of. \"He died of being\r\nWilliam Morris,\" was the reply. Although Gambetta's death was due to a\r\npistol-shot received under circumstances never fully explained, it may\r\nbe said that he also died of being Léon Gambetta. For his inner fires\r\nhad burnt the man out. He crowded all the excitement and passions of a\r\nlong lifetime into those stormy eleven years, and without some account\r\nof him and his efforts for the foundation of the Republic the story of\r\nClemenceau is not complete.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1848 and enabled to come to Paris by the touching\r\nself-sacrifice of a maiden aunt who believed that her nephew's\r\nconfidence in his destiny to do great things would be realised,\r\nGambetta was soon regarded as a leader among the young men of the\r\nQuartier Latin, who were in full revolt against the Empire. He\r\ndistinguished himself by his easy-going, rough-and-tumble mode of life,\r\nhis carelessness about study of the law which was to be his means of\r\nearning a livelihood, and his perfervid eloquence in the political\r\ncircles which he frequented. Lawyer, journalist, bohemian orator of\r\nthe clubs, strongly anti-Imperialist, he had much personal magnetism,\r\nbut was not generally recognised as a man of exceptional ability. The\r\nfew cases he had had in the Courts did not give him any considerable\r\nstanding. Such was Gambetta when a number of Republican journalists\r\nwere arrested on November 12th, 1868, for starting a subscription to\r\nerect a monument to M. Baudin, the Republican deputy who had been shot\r\ndown in cold blood during Louis Napoleon's massacre of the people\r\nof Paris on December 2nd, 1851--seventeen years before. Among these\r\nprisoners was the famous Delescluze, then editor of the _Réveil_. His\r\ncounsel was Léon Gambetta. Gambetta's speech was not merely a defence\r\nof his client, it was a scathing indictment of the Empire, from its\r\nfoundation on the ruin of the Republic of 1848 by the _coup d'état_\r\nonwards. \"Who,\" the advocate asked, \"were the men who 'saved' France\r\nat the cost of the death or transportation or exile of all her most\r\neminent citizens? They were, to quote Corneille, 'un tas d'hommes\r\nperdus de dettes et de crimes.' These are the sort of people who for\r\ncenturies have slashed down institutions and laws. Against them the\r\nhuman conscience is powerless, in spite of the sublime march-past of\r\nthe martyrs who protest in the name of religion destroyed, of morality\r\noutraged, of equity crushed under the jackboot of the soldier. This is\r\nnot salvation: it is assassination.\" And this was no longer a press\r\nprosecution: it was the Emperor and his set of scoundrels who were now\r\non their trial before the people of France and Europe.\r\n\r\nThe speech gave Gambetta great popularity and the opening into public\r\nlife he desired. The cause itself was lost before the trial began.\r\nDelescluze was fined and imprisoned. \"You may condemn us, but you can\r\nneither dishonour us nor overthrow us,\" cried Gambetta. From that time\r\nforward he was regarded as a new force on the side of the Republic.\r\nHis behaviour in the Corps Législatif, to which he was soon afterwards\r\nelected, justified this opinion. When the disasters of the Empire came\r\nGambetta was one of the first to cry for Napoleon's abdication and the\r\nestablishment of the Republic, taking an active part in the foundation\r\nof the new order in Paris. It may be said that he worked side by side,\r\nthough never hand in hand, with Clemenceau.\r\n\r\nBut those scenes of the downfall of the Empire in the capital, dramatic\r\nand exciting as they were, could bear no comparison with his bold\r\nescape from beleaguered Paris in a balloon and the magnificent effort\r\nhe made to rouse the Provinces against the invaders. He failed to turn\r\nthe tide of German victories, but he prevented the shameful surrender\r\nwithout a fight for the French Republic which many would have been glad\r\nto accept, and he, more than any other man, kept the flag flying, when\r\nLegitimists, Orleanists and Buonapartists were all doing their utmost\r\nto set on foot a reactionary government against the best interests\r\nof France. All this is part of the common history of the time. But\r\nwe are apt, in looking back over that period of his activities, to\r\nunderrate the almost superhuman energy he displayed, to attach too much\r\nimportance to the mistakes he inevitably made, and to forget that his\r\nown countrymen were among his worst enemies in the work he undertook.\r\nAlso, if the Empire had left the Republic one single really first-rate\r\ngeneral at the disposal of France, the result might have been very\r\ndifferent from what it was. There is such a thing as luck in human\r\naffairs, and luck was dead against Gambetta. All the more credit to him\r\nfor never losing heart even in the face of continuous disasters and\r\neven betrayals. First as leading member of the Government of Defence,\r\nand then as virtual Dictator of France, Gambetta bridged over for the\r\ntime being the bitter antagonism which separated Paris, the besieged\r\nseat of government, from the rest of France. Immediately on his arrival\r\nat Tours he created a new National Government out of the unpromising\r\nelements gathered together almost accidentally there. The fall of Metz\r\nand the threatened starvation of Paris, which might lead to surrender\r\nat any moment, made Gambetta's own position desperate. The Paris\r\nGovernment, which apparently looked only to Paris, had failed to make\r\na resolute effort to break through the lines of the German investment\r\nbefore Metz fell, and then lost heart altogether, refusing even to\r\nlisten to any remonstrance from outside against a humiliating peace.\r\nGambetta never gave way. Arrived at Bordeaux, he stuck to his text\r\nof carrying on the war, having in the meantime vigorously denounced\r\nthe Government in Paris for its weakness. He and his fellow-delegates\r\nwere deaf to the counsels of despair brought red-hot by members of the\r\nGovernment; but at last, overwhelmed by circumstances he could not\r\ncontrol, the young Dictator resigned. After Paris had surrendered there\r\nwas really no further hope, and those who voted in the new Assembly, as\r\ndid Louis Blanc, Clemenceau and others, for the continuance of the war,\r\ndid so more by way of protest against the apathy which pervaded the\r\nwhole Assembly, and because foreign intervention in favour of France\r\nand against Germany seemed possible even thus late in the day, than\r\nbecause they saw at the moment any prospect of success.\r\n\r\nThus France lay prostrate at the feet of Germany, but at least Gambetta\r\nand the Republicans who acted with him showed their confidence that she\r\nwould rise again. They were not responsible for the collapse of the\r\nFrench nation: undismayed by defeat they believed in Republican France\r\nof the near future.\r\n\r\nGambetta had created new armies out of disarray and disorder, and\r\nhe had also aroused a fresh spirit which rose superior to disaster.\r\nThe victory of the Republic in years to come over all the forces of\r\nreaction was largely due to the work done during Gambetta's four months\r\nof dictatorship.\r\n\r\nUniversal Suffrage, General Secular Education, No Second Chamber,\r\nthe Republican form of Government: those were the principal measures\r\nadvocated by the extreme Left of the National Assembly, and these were\r\nadvocated by Gambetta both at Bordeaux and when he took his seat at\r\nVersailles as one of the Deputies for Paris. But the Royalists were\r\nstill in a majority, and were determined to take every advantage of\r\ntheir position while power still remained in their hands. Their object\r\nwas to render Republicanism hateful. The object of their opponents\r\nwas to show that no other form of government was possible and to\r\nprevent any other form from being established. Now that the Republic\r\nhas been maintained for more than forty-seven years, under all sorts\r\nof difficult and dangerous circumstances, the obstacles which stood\r\nin its way at the start are sometimes under-estimated. Continuous\r\nagitation was needed to keep the country fully alive to the intrigues\r\nof the Royalists and Catholics. It was essential to put the misdeeds of\r\nthe Empire and the real objects of the monarchists constantly before\r\nthe public. No man in France was better qualified for this work than\r\nGambetta, and he did it well, so well that the whole reactionary party\r\nwas infuriated against him. There was no opportunism about him at\r\nthis period, beyond the necessary adaptation of means to ends under\r\ncircumstances which rendered immediate success impossible.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers, in consequence of his horrible suppression of the Commune,\r\nwas by far the most powerful public man in the country. He was acting,\r\nthough a Constitutional Monarchist, as trustee for a provisional form\r\nof government which could not be distinguished from a conservative\r\nRepublic. The longer this continued the better the chance of obtaining\r\na Government which would not be conservative. It was of great\r\nimportance, therefore, to keep M. Thiers on the Republican side, and\r\nthis was made easier by the action of M. Thiers' own old friends.\r\nSo antagonistic was their attitude to the former Minister of Louis\r\nPhilippe that, even when Gambetta supported the ex-Mayor of Lyons,\r\na fervid Radical, M. Barodet, against M. Thiers' eminent friend and\r\ncoadjutor M. de Rémusat, as representative of Paris, and the former won\r\nby 40,000 votes, Thiers never wavered in his decision to keep away from\r\nany direct connection with the monarchists. They therefore determined\r\nto upset the President, did so by a majority of 26 votes in the\r\nAssembly, and elected a President of their own in the person of Marshal\r\nMacMahon. This was on May 24th, 1873.\r\n\r\nReaction had won at Versailles. It remained to be seen whether it would\r\nwin in the country. A \"Ministry of Combat\" for reaction, headed by\r\nthe Duc de Broglie, was formed, and a Ministry of Combat it certainly\r\nproved to be. They were allowed no peace by their opponents, who\r\nnever ceased to attack them all round, and they met these persistent\r\nassaults by attempts secretly to cajole and suborn public opinion. So\r\nthe great combat went on. The majority remained a majority and rejected\r\nthe Republic. It was useless. But in his anxiety to win speedily\r\nin conjunction with M. Thiers, Gambetta himself and his followers\r\npractised that very opportunism which he had previously denounced. A\r\nnon-democratic Senate, which had always been opposed by Republicans,\r\nwas enacted as an essential part of the Republican Constitution, and on\r\nFebruary 25th, 1875, the French Republic was firmly established as the\r\nlegal form of government by the very same majority that, in the hope of\r\nrendering any such disaster to monarchy impossible, had made Marshal\r\nMacMahon President and the Duc de Broglie Premier.\r\n\r\nBut it was a truncated Republic that Gambetta had thus obtained. What\r\nhe had gained by political compromise he had lost in the enthusiasm\r\nof principle. A leader who desires to achieve great reforms must\r\nalways keep in close touch with the fanatics of his party. They alone\r\ncan be relied upon in periods of crisis, they alone refuse to regard\r\npolitics merely as a remunerative profession. The compromise--for men\r\nof principle compromise spells surrender--of February 25th, 1875, was\r\ndestined to be fatal to the democratic parliamentary dictatorship\r\nwhich Gambetta might have achieved by common consent of his party, had\r\nhe pursued his original policy of democratic Republicanism through\r\nand through. He stunted the growth of his own progeny by helping to\r\nestablish a Republicanised Empire. No doubt this averted friction for\r\nthe time being, but it slackened the rate of progress, placed obstacles\r\nin the path of democracy, and destroyed public enthusiasm. By one of\r\nthe strange ironies of political life, however, it so chanced that,\r\nnearly thirty years later, Clemenceau himself owed his return to\r\nParliament to the institution of that same Senate the creation of which\r\nhe had always resolutely opposed.\r\n\r\nBut during these years of reconstruction from 1871 to 1875 Clemenceau\r\nhad been excluded from the Assembly and actively engaged in the work\r\nof the Municipal Council of Paris. There he did admirable service in\r\nconsolidating the organisation of Parisian municipal life to which he\r\nhad been instrumental in giving expression in legal shape as Deputy for\r\nMontmartre. Paris had become the bugbear of all the reactionists and\r\nlaw-and-order men. The capital was constantly referred to by them as if\r\nthe last acts of despair of the irresponsible extremists of the Commune\r\nwere the habitual diversions of the Parisian populace when allowed\r\nfree play for the realisation of their own aspirations. The Parisians,\r\nin fact, according to these persons, were burning with the desire\r\nto destroy their own city in order to avenge themselves upon their\r\nprovincial detractors and enemies. It was important to show, therefore,\r\nnot only that Paris could manage her own affairs coolly and capably,\r\nbut also that she could take a progressive line of her own which might\r\ngive the lead to other French cities in more than one direction. This\r\nwas precisely what the Municipal Council did, and Clemenceau, by his\r\nconstant attendance and the continuous pressure he exerted as an active\r\nmember of the Left of that body, prevented the Council from being used\r\nat any time as a centre of reactionist intrigue. By this means also he\r\nstrengthened his personal influence in his own democratic district as\r\nwell as in Paris as a whole. He took care likewise all the world should\r\nknow that on the matter of the full restitution of Parisian rights and\r\nthe return of the Assembly to the capital he was as determined as ever,\r\nand that in the affairs of general politics he was and always would be\r\na thoroughgoing Radical Republican. Thus he was building up for himself\r\noutside the Chamber a reputation as a capable municipal administrator\r\nas well as a fearless champion of the public rights of the great city\r\nhe had made his home. At the same time his local popularity, due to his\r\nthorough knowledge of social conditions and his advocacy of municipal\r\nimprovements of every kind, added to his gratuitous service as doctor\r\nof the poor, gave him an indisputable claim upon the votes of the\r\npeople when, after having become President of the Municipal Council, he\r\nshould decide to offer himself for re-election to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nAnd from February 25th, 1875, onwards, matters were taking such a turn\r\nthat the presence of a thoroughly well-informed, determined, active\r\nand fearless representative of Paris became necessary. A leader was\r\nwanted on the extreme Left who should loyally support the moderate\r\nRepublicans when they were going forward and have the courage to\r\nattack them when they seemed inclined to hesitate or go back. The\r\nsuccess of the conservative compromise in the constitution of the\r\nRepublic had strengthened the belief of the reactionary majority in\r\nthe Assembly in their own power under the new conditions. Gambetta's\r\nown moderation deceived them as to the real position in the country.\r\nThey began to think that the Republicans were afraid not only of how\r\nthey would fare in the elections to the newly constituted Senate, but\r\nthat the result of the General Elections which must shortly be held\r\nwould be unfavourable to their cause. The Prime Minister, M. Buffet,\r\naided and abetted by the President, MacMahon, who never forgot that\r\nthe members of the Right were his real friends, made full use of the\r\nExceptional Laws and the State of Siege, which was still in force, to\r\nshow the Republicans plainly what a reactionary majority would mean.\r\nThe \"Conservatives\" and Imperialists had things all their own way.\r\nDemocracy became a byword and Radicalism a vain thing.\r\n\r\nWith the Ministry at their command and the President in their hands,\r\nthey needed only to obtain the control of the Senate to have the people\r\nof France entirely at their mercy. Then, with the army favourable,\r\nwith whole cohorts of anti-Republican officials at their service, they\r\nmight postpone the General Elections, maintain the state of siege\r\npermanently, and prepare everything for a monarchical restoration or a\r\nBuonapartist plébiscite. _L'Empire républicanisé_ indeed!\r\n\r\nM. Buffet, within a few months of the declaration of the Republic as\r\nthe real form of government of France, spoke quite in this sense.\r\nHappily the forces of reaction fell out among themselves. They could\r\nnot trust one another in any sharing of the booty which might fall\r\nto the general lot. Therefore, when the time came for nomination and\r\nelection of the seventy-five members of the Senate to be elected by the\r\nAssembly, their intestine differences lost them the battle: one portion\r\nof their motley group even went over to the enemy. So the Republicans\r\nactually obtained a majority by the votes of their opponents. In\r\nthis way the danger of the Senate as a whole being used against the\r\nRepublic was averted and the Radicals had secured the first point in\r\nthe political game. Yet, in spite of this preliminary success, the\r\nreactionists had a majority of the Senate of 300 when the limited\r\nvotes of the country had been polled. But the Republicans in revenge\r\ngained a surprising majority at the General Elections for the National\r\nAssembly, such a majority that it might have been thought any further\r\nserious effort on the part of the anti-Republicans would be impossible\r\nand even that Gambetta's previous policy of opportunism was unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIt was at this election of 1876 that Clemenceau was returned again for\r\nthe 18th Electoral District of Paris to the National Assembly as a\r\nthoroughgoing Radical Republican, and took his seat on the extreme Left\r\nunder the leadership of Gambetta.\r\n\r\nMarshal MacMahon, the President, was a good honest soldier who\r\nserved his country as well as he knew how, but was quite incapable\r\nof understanding the new forces that were coming into action around\r\nhim. The Parisians were never tired of inventing humorous scenes in\r\nwhich he invariably figured as the well-meaning pantaloon. Everybody\r\ntrusted his honour, but all the world doubted his intelligence. He was\r\nby nature, upbringing and surroundings a conservative in the widest\r\nsense of the word. Radical Republicanism was to him the accursed thing\r\nwhich would bring about another Commune of Paris, if its partisans\r\nwere given free rein. Although, therefore, incapable of plotting\r\ndirectly for the overthrow of the Constitution he had pledged himself\r\nto uphold, he was liable to yield to influences the full tendency of\r\nwhich he did not discern. Thus it happened that he allowed himself\r\nunconsciously to become the tool of the highly educated and clever\r\nDuc de Broglie, who was undoubtedly a monarchist and, what was still\r\nworse, a statesman imbued with the ideals of clericalism and of the\r\nJesuits--precisely those powers which the growing spirit of democracy\r\nand Republicanism most feared. It was this growing spirit and its\r\nexpression in the National Assembly that the Prime Minister, M. Jules\r\nSimon, who succeeded de Broglie had to recognise and deal with.\r\nGambetta was still the leader of the Republican Party, and with him for\r\nthis struggle were all the more advanced men, including Clemenceau, who\r\nafterwards stoutly opposed his policy of opportunism and compromise.\r\nM. Jules Simon, finding the majority of the Assembly in favour of\r\nsteady progress towards the Left, was quite unable to check the\r\nmovement in this direction or to refuse the legislation to which the\r\nRepublican demands of necessity impelled him. The President could not\r\nsee that an extremely moderate man, such as Jules Simon undoubtedly\r\nwas, would not have taken this course unless he had been convinced\r\nthat the Republic had to be in some degree republicanised if serious\r\ntrouble were to be averted. In short, Marshal MacMahon felt that the\r\nfloodgates of revolution were being opened, and forthwith knocked\r\ndown the lock-keeper. In other words, he sent for M. Jules Simon and\r\ntalked to him in such a manner as gave the Premier no option but to\r\nresign. Resign he did. Thereupon France was thrown into that turmoil of\r\npeaceful civil war ever afterwards known as the _Coup du Seize Mai_.\r\nThe Duc de Broglie, with a trusty phalanx of seasoned reactionaries\r\nand devotees of priestcraft, again took office, regardless of the fact\r\nthat the majority of the Chamber was solid against them all. Even\r\nwith the most strenuous support of the President of the Republic,\r\nthe de Broglie Ministry never had a chance from the first. They were\r\nin a hopeless minority, and their attempt to govern, on the basis of\r\nMacMahon's reputation and the support of the priests, could not but\r\nresult in failure, unless the Marshal himself were prepared to risk a\r\n_coup d'état_. This the Duc de Broglie and his followers were ready to\r\nattempt, but it was useless to embark upon anything of the kind so long\r\nas the President held back.\r\n\r\nThen came the famous division, following up a most violent discussion,\r\nwhich for many a long year formed a landmark in the history of the\r\nRepublic. Three hundred and sixty-three Republicans declared against\r\nthe President's Ministry of reaction and all its works. But Marshal\r\nMacMahon still would not understand that in his mistaken attempt to\r\noverride the National Assembly in order to save France from what he\r\nbelieved would be an Anarchist revolution, he himself, with his group\r\nof monarchists and clericals, was steadily impelling the country into\r\ncivil war. The action taken against Gambetta, then at the height of his\r\nvigour and influence, for declaring in his famous phrase that, in view\r\nof the attitude of the Chamber, the President must either \"give in or\r\nget out,\" made matters still worse. The President's manifestoes to the\r\nAssembly and the country also only confirmed the growing impression\r\nthat a sinister plot was afoot against the Republic itself, in the\r\ninterest of the Orleanists.\r\n\r\nThis was a much more serious matter than appeared on the surface.\r\nIn the six years which had passed since the withdrawal of the\r\nGerman armies and the suppression of the Commune, France had become\r\naccustomed to the Republic and to the use of universal suffrage as a\r\ndemocratic instrument of organisation. Great as were its drawbacks in\r\nmany respects, the Republic was, as Gambetta phrased it, the form of\r\ngovernment which divided Frenchmen the least. The people, who comprised\r\nnot only the enlightened Radical Republicans of the cities, but the\r\neasily frightened small bourgeoisie and the peasantry, could now make\r\nthe Assembly and the Senate do what they pleased. They were not as yet\r\nprepared to push those institutions very fast or very far, but they\r\nwere unquestionably moving forward and were in no mind whatever to\r\ngo back either to Napoleonism, Orleanism or Legitimism. France as a\r\nRepublic was becoming the France of them all.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the 363 deputies who voted against the Duc\r\nde Broglie's rococo restoration policy and Marshal MacMahon's\r\nconstitutional autocracy stood firmly together, sinking all differences\r\nin the one determination to safeguard and consolidate the Republic,\r\nthere could be no real doubt as to the result. Those 363 stalwarts\r\nissued a vigorous appeal to the country, and the issue was joined in\r\nearnest at the General Elections. Gambetta, meanwhile, was the hero of\r\nthe hour, straining every nerve for victory, exhausting himself by his\r\nfurious eloquence, and the other advanced leaders did their full share\r\nof the fighting. In all this political warfare Clemenceau was as active\r\nand energetic as the fiery tribune himself, and as one of the framers\r\nand signatories of the great Republican appeal identified himself\r\npermanently with the document which recorded, as events proved, the\r\ndecision of France to be and to remain a Republic.\r\n\r\nAlthough it did not seem so at the time, the President played\r\ncompletely into the hands of the Republicans by the Message he sent\r\nto the Assembly and the Senate just before the prorogation he had so\r\nautocratically decreed. Here is a portion of it:--\r\n\r\n \"Frenchmen,--You are about to vote. The violence of the opposition\r\n has dispelled all illusions. . . . The conflict is between order and\r\n disorder. You have already announced you will not by hostile elections\r\n plunge the country into an unknown future of crises and conflicts. You\r\n will vote for the candidates whom I recommend to your suffrages. Go\r\n without fear to the poll.\r\n\r\n                                          (Signed) \"MARÉCHAL MACMAHON.\"\r\n\r\nThe elections followed. It is difficult to exaggerate the advantage\r\nwhich is given in a French General Election to the party in power at\r\nthe time. An unscrupulous Minister of the Interior has at his disposal\r\nall sorts of devices and machinery for helping his own side to victory.\r\nHe can bring pressure of every kind to bear upon individuals directly\r\nor indirectly dependent on the Government of the day, and the whole\r\nofficial caste may be enlisted on behalf of the administration in\r\ncontrol. This is the case ordinarily and in quiet times. But here was\r\na direct stand-up fight between Reaction and Clericalism on the one\r\nside and Republicanism and Secularism--for that was at stake too--on\r\nthe other. Both Marshal MacMahon and the Duc de Broglie honestly\r\nbelieved that they were doing their very utmost to preserve France\r\nfrom rapine and ruin. Every Radical Republican of the old school or\r\nthe new was to them a bloody-minded Communard in disguise, veiling\r\nhis instincts for plunder with eloquent appeals for patriotism and\r\nhumanity. It is easy for the fanatics of conservatism and reaction thus\r\nto delude themselves. And once self-deceived they lose no chance of\r\nimposing their own wise and sober views upon the misguided people! So\r\nit happened in this case. Never were the powers of the Government in\r\noffice strained to the same extent as in these elections of 1877--the\r\nelections which followed on the \"_Seize Mai_\" stroke of MacMahon. Not\r\nan opportunity for coercing, cajoling and intimidating the voters was\r\nmissed. In every urban district and rural village throughout France\r\nthe State, the Church, the Municipality, the Commune were used to\r\nthe fullest extent possible to obtain a vote favourable to the de\r\nBroglie Ministry. Swarms of priests and Jesuits buzzed around the\r\nconstituencies, and promises of an easy time of it in this life and\r\nthe next if things went the right way were made in profusion. If the\r\nRepublic could be beaten by the forces of reaction it would be beaten\r\nnow! Gambetta had predicted that the 363 would return to the Assembly\r\nas 400. This was not to be. But in view of the tremendous efforts made\r\nto stem the tide of progress, not only by promises, but by serious\r\nthreats wherever threats might tell, the wonder is the Republicans were\r\nso successful as they proved to be. In spite of all that the President\r\nand the Prime Minister and the Catholic Church and the Jesuits--who\r\nwere fighting for the right to remain in France--and the curés and\r\nthe State functionaries, and all that the agencies of aristocratic,\r\nmonarchist and Buonapartist--more particularly Buonapartist--corruption\r\ncould do, the Republicans returned to the Chamber with a substantial\r\nmajority of upwards of 100 votes. This victory was universally\r\nrecognised not only in France but throughout Europe as irrefragable\r\nevidence that the French people had finally decided for a Republic, and\r\nhad dealt at the same time a serious blow to the Church.\r\n\r\nBut, obvious as this was to everybody else, the respectable old\r\nsoldier who had been a party to all this reactionary turmoil was still\r\nunconvinced of the error of his ways! He repeated the formula of the\r\nMalakoff fortress: _J'y suis, j'y reste_. But the Republicans were more\r\ntenacious than the Russians. They resolved to dislodge him, political\r\nMarshal though he was. A resolution was passed by the Assembly to\r\ninquire into corrupt practices during the election. It was a challenge\r\nto battle, and signed by such men as Albert Grévy, H. Brisson, Jules\r\nFerry, Léon Gambetta, Floquet, Louis Blanc and Clemenceau.\r\n\r\nA great debate, lasting several days, followed, in which de Broglie\r\ndefended himself in a high-handed manner against the fervid\r\ndenunciations of Gambetta. A Committee of Inquiry was nominated and\r\nthe arena of the struggle changed to the Senate, which presently, as\r\nmight have been expected from its reactionary character, gave a small\r\nvote of confidence in the Marshal and his Ministers. Nevertheless the\r\nfeeling in the country was such that even MacMahon could not hold on.\r\nDe Broglie resigned, and the Marshal evolved--almost from the depths of\r\nhis inner consciousness--an \"extra-Parliamentary Cabinet\" which might\r\nhave been called \"The Cabinet of Men of No Account.\" But these were so\r\nunknown and so incompetent that all France made fun of them; and the\r\nwill of the old Marshal, which nothing else could conquer, was broken\r\nby ridicule. In December, 1877, the President of the Republic saw that\r\nunless he appealed to the army, as the Buonapartists vigorously incited\r\nhim to do, an appeal which more than probably the army itself would\r\nhave rejected, there was no course open to him but the alternative\r\nwhich Gambetta had pointed out as being the Marshal's inevitable\r\ndestiny if he kept within the limits of law and order--to give in or\r\nget out. The old soldier of the Empire gave in, and did his country\r\na service by accepting the rebuff which he had courted: a moderate\r\nRepublican Ministry under the Premiership of M. Dufaure took office.\r\nMacMahon himself remained President of the Republic until January,\r\n1879 (when he was succeeded by Jules Grévy), but his reactionary\r\npower was broken and France entered on a moderately peaceful era of\r\nrecognised Republicanism. Gambetta was the acknowledged leader of\r\nthe Republican majority; and Clemenceau, after this first taste of\r\nvictory, now began that fine career of destructive, anti-opportunist\r\nRadicalism and semi-Socialist democracy which made him for many\r\nyears the most redoubtable politician and orator in the Republic.\r\nThe Radical-Socialist Clemenceau stood next in succession to the\r\nOpportunist Gambetta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                               THE TIGER\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a political leader in the course of some fifteen years of\r\nParlamentary life has upset, or has helped to upset, no fewer than\r\neighteen administrations and has always refused to take office himself,\r\nthat leader is likely to have created a few enemies. When, in addition\r\nto these feats of destruction, he has during the same period secured\r\nthe nomination and election of three Presidents of the Republic and\r\nhas thus proved an insuperable obstacle to the realisation of the\r\nlegitimate ambitions of the most important public men in France who\r\nwere not elected, it is clear that personal popularity was not the\r\nobject he had in view. It is impossible for the ordinary politician\r\nor journalist to judge fairly a man of this sort. Politics in modern\r\nEurope is an interesting game and, quite frequently, a remunerative\r\nprofession. Party interests sap all principle and the attainment of\r\npersonal aims and ambitions in and out of Parliament is, as a rule,\r\nquite incompatible with common honesty. Instead of Court intrigues and\r\nbackstair cabals there are nowadays lobby \"transactions\" and convenient\r\nsales of titles and positions arranged, for value received, at private\r\nmeetings. That is as far as democracy has got yet. It is all an\r\nunderstood business, often complicated with more flagitious pecuniary\r\ndealings outside.\r\n\r\nRepublican Government, or Constitutional Government, means, therefore,\r\nthe success or failure of vote-catching and advantage-grabbing schemes,\r\nquite irrespective, from the public point of view, of the merits of the\r\nproposals which are put forward. Honest enthusiasts, who really wish\r\nto get something done for the benefit of the present or the coming\r\ngeneration, are only useful in so far as they act as stokers-up of\r\npublic opinion for the profit of the political promoter of this or that\r\nfaction. Steam is needed to drive the machine of State. Men of real\r\nconvictions furnish that steam. But they are fools for their pains, all\r\nthe same. Half the amount of energy used in the right direction would\r\ngain for them place, pelf, and possibly power, which is all that any\r\nman of common sense goes into politics for. Anybody who carries high\r\nprinciple and serious endeavour into political life is not playing the\r\ngame. Everybody around him wants to know what on earth he is driving\r\nat. The only conceivable object of turning a Ministry out is to get\r\nin. To turn a Government out in order to keep out yourself is an\r\nunintelligible and therefore dangerous form of political mania, or a\r\npersistent manifestation of original sin.\r\n\r\nClemenceau was found guilty on both counts. But he was the ablest\r\npublic man in all France. Moreover, he was successful in the diabolical\r\ncombinations he set on foot. The thing was uncanny. That he should\r\nbegin by overthrowing other politicians was all in the way of business.\r\nBut that he should go on at it, time after time, for year after year,\r\nwhile other and inferior men took the posts he had opened for them, was\r\nnot to be explained by any known theory of human motives. If he had\r\nbeen a cranky religionist, now, that would conceivably have met the\r\ncase. He might have been \"possessed\" from on high or from below. But\r\nClemenceau was and is a free-thinker of free-thinkers: neither Heaven\r\nnor Hell has anything to say to him. Clearly it is a case of malignant\r\natavism: Clemenceau has thrown back to his animal ancestry. What is\r\nthe totem of the tribe which has entered into him, whose instinct of\r\ndepredation pervades his every political action? We have it! He is of\r\nthe jungle, jungly. His spring is terrific. His crashing attack fatal.\r\nHe looks as formidable as he is. In short, he is a Tiger, and there you\r\nare. That accounts for everything!\r\n\r\nWhen Clemenceau was re-elected Deputy for the 18th Arrondissement\r\nto the National Assembly, on October 14th, 1877, and took the active\r\npart in the renewed struggle with Marshal MacMahon already spoken of,\r\nGambetta was the leader at the height of his power and influence, with\r\na solid Republican majority of more than a hundred votes. But from\r\nthis period he became steadily more and more Opportunist, which gained\r\nhim great credit in Great Britain, and Clemenceau was thenceforth the\r\nrecognised leader of the advanced Left. MacMahon having resigned, M.\r\nGrévy was elected President with the support of Gambetta.\r\n\r\nFrom the first Clemenceau had vigorously opposed the establishment\r\nof a Second Chamber in the shape of a Senate divorced from a direct\r\npopular vote. This was a step calculated to hamper progress at every\r\nturn, and at critical moments to intensify those very antagonisms which\r\nit was Gambetta's intention, no doubt, to compose entirely, or at any\r\nrate to mitigate. Clemenceau did not view the matter from Gambetta's\r\npoint of view. The Monarchists and Buonapartists were the domestic\r\nenemy, as the Germans had been and might be again the foreign enemy.\r\nThe only sound policy for strengthening the Republic to resist both\r\nwas to favour those measures political and social which would make\r\nthat Republic, which they had established with so much difficulty and\r\nat such great cost, a genuinely democratic Republic. Any surrender to\r\nthe reactionists and the clericals must inevitably dishearten those\r\nparties, now shown to be the majority of the whole French people, who\r\nwere for the Republic and the Republic alone. Opportunism also gave\r\nthe anti-democrats and intriguers a false notion of their own power,\r\nvirtually helped them to carry on their underground agitations for a\r\nchange of the new constitution, and provided them in the undemocratic\r\nSenate with a political force that might be turned to their own purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was more important all through, thought Clemenceau, to inspire\r\nyour own side with confidence than to placate your opponents by\r\nhalf-measures. It was, in fact, not enough to eject officials who were\r\nknown to be hostile to the Republic; it was still more essential to\r\ngive such shape to the political forms and so vivify political opinion\r\nthat even the most unscrupulous officials could not turn them to the\r\naccount of reaction. Both steps were necessary to carry out a thorough\r\ndemocratic programme. In fact, the whole scheme of administration in\r\nFrance could not be permanently improved merely by substituting one set\r\nof bureaucrats for another. Much more drastic measures of a peaceful\r\ncharacter were indispensable, and these Opportunism thwarted. Gambetta\r\nmay not have given up his desire to carry these Radical measures in\r\n1877 and 1878: he still retained and expressed his old opinions upon\r\nclericalism and its sinister influence. But he was no longer the\r\nvehement champion of the advanced party at Versailles, and the position\r\nwhich he had abandoned Clemenceau took up and pushed further to the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nThere was no matter on which the lines of cleavage between the\r\nRepublicans and the reactionists were more definitely and clearly drawn\r\nthan on the question of the Amnesty of the Communists. No man in the\r\nAssembly was stronger in favour of their complete amnesty by law than\r\nClemenceau. This he showed in 1876, and in his powerful advocacy of the\r\nrelease of the great agitator and conspirator Blanqui in 1879. Every\r\nreactionary and trimming man of moderate views was bitterly opposed to\r\na policy of justice towards the victims of the wholesale measures of\r\nrepression formulated by M. Thiers and so frightfully carried out by\r\nGeneral Gallifet and the Versailles troops in 1871. Even when measures\r\nof partial amnesty were passed, their application was nullified as\r\nfar as possible by Ministers. It was part of an organised policy\r\nto frighten the bourgeoisie and peasants into another Empire. The\r\nreprisals of the Bloody Week and the transportations to Cayenne and New\r\nCaledonia had not by any means fully satisfied the enemies alike of the\r\nCommune and the Republic. So Clemenceau and his friends never ceased\r\ntheir attacks upon M. Waddington and others who took the rancorous\r\nconservative view of unceasing persecution of the men and women who,\r\nafter all, were the first to declare the Republic. M. Waddington, as\r\nPremier, got a resolution passed by the Chamber in his favour. But this\r\ndid not silence either Clemenceau's friends or himself. Here, in fact,\r\nwas a crucial case of his power of getting rid of an obnoxious Ministry\r\neven in the face of a Ministerial majority. The Tiger showed his\r\nclaws and made ready to spring. But first he gave fair warning of his\r\nintentions. Nothing could be plainer than this: \"Why has the Minister\r\nof Justice demanded a partial amnesty? Because he is anxious that the\r\ncountry should not forget the horrors of the Commune. But then, if you\r\ndo not wish it to forget the horrors of the Commune, why do you desire\r\nthat those who have been condemned should forget the horrors of its\r\nrepression? Because for eight long years we have kept under cover the\r\nabominable facts at our disposal, you have thought yourselves in a\r\nposition to trample on us! You say: We shall not forget the hostages\r\nand the conflagrations. Very well. I who speak here tell you: If you\r\nforget nothing, your opponents will remember too.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech from which that passage is an excerpt was regarded as\r\na distinct menace on Clemenceau's part. It was followed up by the\r\nextreme Left with a series of interruptions, interrogations and\r\ndenunciations which ended in the retirement of M. Waddington. He had\r\nhis majority but he had no Clemenceau. So out went Waddington and his\r\ncolleagues. In came M. Freycinet--\"the white mouse.\" \"We have had,\"\r\nsaid Clemenceau's organ, _La Justice_, \"in the Waddington cabinet a\r\nDufaure cabinet without M. Dufaure. To-day we have a Waddington cabinet\r\nwithout M. Waddington. It is a botch upon a botch.\" A nice welcome for\r\nM. Freycinet! A pleasing congratulation for the President, M. Grévy!\r\nThe administration was regarded as a political monstrosity. It had two\r\nheads, M. Freycinet and M. Jules Ferry, one looking to the right and\r\nthe other to the left. The friends of Freycinet could not stand Ferry:\r\nthe friends of Ferry abhorred Freycinet. This new political marriage\r\nnot only began but went on with mutual aversion. It stood at the\r\nmercy, therefore, of Clemenceau, who was less inclined to be merciful\r\nsince the Premier declared himself bitterly hostile to the plenary\r\namnesty proposed by the famous old Republican, M. Louis Blanc. Also on\r\naccount of clerical tendencies. Out goes Freycinet, therefore, in his\r\nturn, and in comes M. Jules Ferry, with various clerical, educational\r\nand other troubles of his own hatching to clear up. Ministries, in\r\nshort, were going in and out on the dial of Presidential favour like\r\nthe figures of a Dutch clock. Clemenceau was getting his claws well\r\ninto the various political personages all the time. As none of them\r\nhad any blood to lose in the shape of principles there was no great\r\nharm done--except to the Republic! It was the perpetual immolation\r\nof a sawdust brigade. A keen critic of the period said of the Ferry\r\nMinistry--which was beaten on its proposal to postpone on behalf of\r\neducation the reform of the magistracy and all that this carried with\r\nit in regard to the amnesty--that it wished to die before it lived.\r\nDown it went for the moment, and returned to place out of breath and\r\nhalf-ruined. But there the Ministry still was, and that by itself was\r\nsomething in those days of political topsy-turveydom, with Clemenceau\r\nand his party ever ready to assert themselves.\r\n\r\nThus the Republic stumbled rather than marched on, from the date\r\nof Marshal MacMahon's resignation and the installation of M. Grévy\r\nas President up to the period of the declaration of July 14th, in\r\nremembrance of July 14th, 1789, and the Fall of the Bastille, as the\r\nfête day of the Republic after the passage of a practically complete\r\namnesty. This was really a great triumph for all Republicans, as it put\r\nthe Republic in its true historic relation to the past, the present\r\nand the future. With such a national fête day, with the certainty that\r\nRepublicans, if they chose to keep united, could always command a large\r\nmajority in the Assembly, the elections of 1881 might well have been\r\na first step towards a thorough political and social reorganisation\r\nof the Republic. Unfortunately there were several causes of disunion.\r\nPresident of the Assembly though he was, and therefore excluded by\r\nhis position as well as by M. Grévy's prejudice against him from\r\ncoming into immediate competition with M. Ferry for the Premiership,\r\nGambetta was actively supporting the _scrutin de liste_, or political\r\nappeal to the whole country, against _scrutin d'arrondissement_, or\r\nlocal elections. This was regarded as a bid on his part for a clear\r\nParliamentary dictatorship. Already on October 20th, 1880, Clemenceau\r\nhad denounced the hero of the dictatorship of despair of 1871, fine as\r\nhis effort had then been, as aiming at personal power ten years later.\r\nA victory at the polls gained through _scrutin de liste_ would probably\r\nensure him success in this venture.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of open and secret opposition, Gambetta had\r\nsufficient influence to carry the _scrutin de liste_ through the\r\nNational Assembly. But with the curious irony of fate he was defeated\r\nby a majority of 32 in the Senate which he himself had been so largely\r\ninstrumental in forcing upon the Republic! This was on June 9th, 1881.\r\nThree months before, M. Barodet had brought forward a resolution\r\nbacked by 64 deputies which, if carried, would have abolished the\r\nequality of rights between the Senate and the National Assembly, would\r\nhave withdrawn the right of the former to dissolve Parliament, would\r\nhave made the Chamber permanent like the Senate, would have modified\r\nthe system of election of the second House; would have prevented the\r\nre-enactment of the _scrutin de liste_ by again making the electoral\r\nlaw for the deputies part of the Constitution; and lastly would have\r\nsummoned a Constituent Assembly in order to carry out these reforms.\r\nThis whole project was discussed in the Assembly on May 31st. There\r\nwas no mistake about Clemenceau's attitude. He formulated a vigorous\r\nindictment against the Constitution of 1875 and attacked the Senate\r\nwith great violence. The Constitution of 1875 was, he declared, a\r\npowerful weapon of war expressly forged for use against the Republic.\r\nThe Senate with its anti-democratic method of election was a permanent\r\ndanger to the State. It was not in any sense an element of stability\r\nbut an element of resistance. \"What is the use of talking of a brake\r\non the machine or a weight to counterbalance popular opinion? Does not\r\nuniversal suffrage provide its own brake, its own regulator?\" This\r\ntime, however, Clemenceau missed his _coup_. M. Barodet's motion was\r\nrejected and the conservative Republic rumbled on comfortably, though\r\nClemenceau shortly afterwards very nearly toppled M. Ferry's Cabinet\r\nover, the Ministers only securing a vote in their favour by a majority\r\nof 13 made up by their own votes.\r\n\r\nLooking back to that period when the whole Constitution seemed almost\r\ncertain to go into the melting-pot and come out again in a thoroughly\r\ndemocratic shape, it is remarkable to notice how, in spite of the\r\nefforts of Clemenceau, M. Naquet and other democrats, the Republic of\r\ncompromise has steadily adhered to its old machinery. Why the cumbrous\r\nand often reactionary Senate, elected in such wise as to exclude\r\ndemocratic influence, should have been maintained for more than forty\r\nyears is difficult to explain. But nations, as our own belated and\r\nunmanageable Constitution proves, when once they have become accustomed\r\nto a form of government, are very slow indeed to adapt it to rapidly\r\nchanging economic and social developments. This, it may be said,\r\nsuits the English turn of mind with its queer addiction to perpetual\r\ncompromise. But the French are logical and apparently restless. Yet\r\ntheir Constitution remains an unintelligible muddle. Their real\r\nconservatism overrides their revolutionary tendencies except in periods\r\nof great perturbation. Thus the Opportunist Republic of Gambetta,\r\nwhich ought to have been a mere makeshift, has held on, with partial\r\nrevision, for more than forty years. Fear of the monarchists on one\r\nside and of the Communists, afterwards the Socialists, on the other has\r\nkept Humpty-Dumpty up on his wall.\r\n\r\nThe elections of 1881, conducted as they were amid much excitement,\r\ngave the Republicans of all parties a crushing majority--a majority in\r\nthe Assembly greatly out of proportion even to the total vote. There\r\nwere five millions of votes for Republicans against 1,700,000 for\r\nthe various sections of monarchists. The Republican deputies in the\r\nChamber, however, numbered 467 to only 90 \"conservatives.\" According\r\nto the returns, this was a victory for the Government and its chief,\r\nM. Jules Ferry, especially as the Prime Minister had arrived at some\r\nunderstanding with Gambetta, who at this time had become extremely\r\nunpopular with the democracy of Paris. But those who were of this\r\nopinion reckoned without the question of Tunis and, above all, without\r\ntaking account of the difficulty of facing the criticisms of the\r\nirreconcilable Clemenceau. Clemenceau had always opposed a policy of\r\ncolonial adventure. This of Tunis was from his point of view not only\r\nadventurous but dangerous. Tunis had been offered to France in an\r\nindefinite way at the Peace-with-Honour Congress of Berlin in 1878.\r\nBut the policy of expansion pushed on by financial intrigues did not\r\ntake shape at once. When it did it was serious enough, for France not\r\nonly had to deal with troubles in Algeria itself, with the natural\r\nopposition of the Bey of Tunis to French interference and annexation,\r\nbut Italy took umbrage at the advance, regarding Tunis as specially\r\nher business, Turkey was by no means favourable, and there was even\r\na possibility that Germany might stir up trouble for purposes of her\r\nown. Moreover the whole business had been extremely ill-managed, not\r\nonly by the Government itself but by M. Albert Grévy, the brother of\r\nthe President, who was the Governor-General of Algeria. This personage,\r\non account of his Presidential connections, could neither be censured\r\nnor replaced. So credits were asked for, troops were moved, a railway\r\nconcession granted--everything as usual, in short, when annexation is\r\nbeing prepared.\r\n\r\nClemenceau quite rightly denounced the whole mischievous business as\r\nthe policy of intriguers and plutocrats, and demanded an inquiry into\r\nthe affair from the first. He did not measure his phrases at all.\r\nFrench blood and French money, sadly needed at home, were being wasted\r\nabroad. M. Ferry, to do him justice, fought hard for his policy of\r\ncolonisation by force of arms. His attacks upon the extremists who\r\ncriticised him did not lack point or bitterness. Discharged officials\r\nfrom the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and returned Communards from\r\nNoumea who composed the public meetings and irregular assizes that\r\ncondemned him, M. Ferry, \"as is fitting, kicked aside with his boot.\"\r\nAs to Clemenceau, if he had allowed matters to take their own course\r\nin Tunis, what a tornado of malediction would have raged around them\r\nfrom that orator! \"I can hear even now the philippics of the honourable\r\nM. Clemenceau.\" Clemenceau did not get the inquiry he demanded. But\r\non November 10th M. Ferry retired, so badly had he been mauled in\r\nthe fray. It was a win, that is to say, for Clemenceau, who by his\r\nspeech on November 9th again overthrew the Government in spite of the\r\ncordial support of Gambetta. What made this victory of Clemenceau and\r\nthe extreme Left the more astounding was the fact that the Treaty\r\nconcluding the \"first pacification\" of Tunis had been confirmed on May\r\n23rd by a majority of 430 to 1. Clemenceau was that one. Six months\r\nlater, therefore, he had his revenge. The _expédition de vacances_,\r\nwhich had developed into a _guerre de conquête_, cost M. Jules Ferry\r\nhis Premiership, notwithstanding this unheard-of majority. The Tiger at\r\nwork indeed!\r\n\r\nSo now at last, in spite of M. Grévy's ungrateful conduct towards him,\r\nin spite likewise of the rejection of the _scrutin de liste_, Gambetta\r\nbecame President of the Council instead of President of the Chamber.\r\nHe was still at this time in the eyes of all foreigners the most\r\neminent living French statesman. In England particularly his accession\r\nto office was received with jubilation in official circles. It meant,\r\nso said Liberals like Sir Charles Dilke, who were then in power, a\r\npermanently close understanding between France and England, a joint\r\nsettlement of the troublesome and at times even threatening Egyptian\r\nquestion, as well as a fair probability of the arrangement of other\r\nthorny problems between the two countries. But in order to accomplish\r\nall this Gambetta must carry the Assembly, the Senate and the bulk of\r\nhis countrymen with him, and control a solid Republican party, even\r\nif Clemenceau and his squadrons still hung upon his flank. Gambetta,\r\nhowever, had shaken the confidence of the country. It was no longer\r\nClemenceau and his friends only who accused him of aiming at supreme\r\ndictatorial power. The public in general suspected him too. Nor did\r\nhis immediate friends, either old or young, do much to destroy this\r\nunfortunate impression.\r\n\r\nTruth to tell, Gambetta was not the man he had been a few years\r\nbefore. He looked fat, even bloated, unhealthy and sensual. His\r\nmagnificent frame had undergone deterioration. A brilliant French\r\njournalist cruelly comparing him to Vitellius, as a man of gluttony\r\nand debauchery combined, summed up his career against that of the\r\nextraordinary Roman general and Emperor who had played so many parts\r\nsuccessfully, as soldier in the field and as courtier in the palace,\r\nand wound up in derision of Gambetta with the terrible phrase, \"_Je\r\nte demande pardon, César!_\" And over against this self-indulgent and\r\nfiery man of genius was a very different personage, who had taken up\r\nthe rôle which had once been that of the great tribune of the French\r\npeople. Spare, alert, vigorous, always in training, despising ease and\r\nnever taken by surprise; equal, as he had just shown, to fighting a\r\nlone hand victoriously, yet never despising help in his battles even\r\nfrom the most unexpected quarters--what chance had Gambetta against\r\nsuch a terrible opponent as Clemenceau? None whatever. Down he went,\r\nafter a Premiership of but sixty-six days. Many believe that, finding\r\nthe situation too complicated, and relying still upon obtaining the\r\n_scrutin de liste_ later--as indeed came about some time after his\r\ndeath--Gambetta deliberately rode for a fall. Certain it is that M.\r\nSpüller, who had Gambetta's complete confidence, gave this explanation\r\nof his intentions three weeks before his defeat in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nGambetta, with all his great reputation, being overthrown, straightway\r\nhis old Secretary of 1871, de Freycinet, came again to the front.\r\nThe affairs of Egypt, always with Clemenceau's genial assistance,\r\nmade short work of him. The Anglo-French Condominium having fallen\r\nthrough and England having thought proper to suppress a people \"rightly\r\nstruggling to be free,\" de Freycinet was anxious to reassert the claims\r\nof France in Egypt after a fashion which threatened unpleasantness\r\nwith Great Britain. Whatever Clemenceau may have thought privately\r\nof English policy at this juncture, he would have none of that. His\r\narguments convinced the Assembly that French intervention in Egypt\r\nagainst England would be dangerous and unsuccessful. France, said\r\nClemenceau, had neither England's advantages nor England's direct\r\ninterests in Egypt. France is a continental, not a great sea power. Her\r\napprehensions are from the East. Do nothing which may drive England\r\ninto the arms of Germany.\r\n\r\nWhat was much worse, the same colonial expansion which had been carried\r\nout in Tunis was now followed up in Tonquin, Annam and Madagascar, at\r\ngreat expense and to little or no advantage. Clemenceau still opposed\r\nthis entire policy on principle. Ferry thought France would recompense\r\nherself for the disasters of 1870-71 by these adventures: Clemenceau\r\nwas absolutely convinced to the contrary. \"Why risk £20,000,000 on\r\nremote expeditions when we have our entire industrial mechanism to\r\ncreate, when we lack schools and country roads? To build up vanquished\r\nFrance again we must not waste her blood and treasure on useless\r\nenterprises. But there are much higher reasons even than these for\r\nabstaining from such wars of depredation. It is all an abuse, pure and\r\nsimple, of the power which scientific civilisation has over primitive\r\ncivilisation to lay hold upon man as man, to torture him, to squeeze\r\neverything he has in him out of him for the profit of a civilisation\r\nwhich itself is a sham.\" There could be no sounder sense, no higher\r\nmorality, no truer statesmanship than that. Clemenceau had aspirations\r\nthat France should lead the world, not by unjustifiable conquests\r\nover semi-civilised populations, but by displaying at home those\r\ngreat qualities which she undoubtedly possesses. His attacks were\r\ninspired, therefore, not by personal animosity against Jules Ferry or\r\nany other politician, but against a megalomania that was harmful to\r\nhis country and the world. Unfortunately, Clemenceau could not, this\r\ntime, persuade the Assembly or his countrymen to recognise the dangers\r\nand disadvantages of expansion by conquest in the Far East, until the\r\ndisaster of Lang Son and the demand for additional credits enabled him\r\nto push the perils of such a policy right home. Then M. Ferry was once\r\nmore discharged, practically at Clemenceau's behest.\r\n\r\nSo matters went on, Clemenceau striving his utmost, in opposition, to\r\nenforce the genuine democratic policy of abstention from Imperialism\r\nabroad and strengthening of the forces of the Republic at home which\r\nthe successive Opportunist Administrations in power refused to\r\naccept. In each and every case, Tunis, Tonquin, Annam, Madagascar\r\nand Egypt, he considered first, foremost and all the time what would\r\nmost benefit Frenchmen in France, and refused to be led astray by any\r\nwill-o'-the-wisps of Eastern origin, however gloriously they might\r\ndisport themselves under the sun of finance. But now came a still more\r\nawkward matter close at home. There are not the same facilities for\r\nshutting down inquiries into the financial peccadilloes or corrupt\r\nmalversations of public men in France as there are in England. Monetary\r\nscandals will out, though political blunderings may be glossed over, as\r\nin the cases of the Duc de Broglie, M. Jules Ferry and M. Albert Grévy.\r\nThe President, M. Grévy, was very unfortunate in his relations. His\r\nbrother, the Governor-General of Algeria, had shown himself dreadfully\r\nincompetent in that capacity. But M. de Freycinet, M. Jules Ferry and\r\nthe whole Ministerial set had entered into a conspiracy of silence and\r\nmisrepresentation, throwing the blame of his mistakes upon anybody but\r\nthe Governor-General himself, in order to uphold the dignity of the\r\nPresident quite uninjured. Now, however, the President's son-in-law,\r\nM. Wilson, was found out in very ignoble transactions. He was actually\r\ndetected in the flagitious practice of trading in decorations, the\r\nLegion of Honour and the like, not for what are considered on this\r\nside of the Channel as perfectly legitimate purposes, the furtherance,\r\nnamely, of Party gains or Ministerial advantages, but in order to\r\nincrease his own income. The thing became a public scandal. Those\r\nwho could not afford to buy the envied distinctions were specially\r\nincensed. But out of regard for the President, out of consideration\r\nfor their personal advancement in the future, because when you start\r\nthis sort of thing you never know how far it will go, because other\r\nMinisters in and out of office had had relations of their own addicted\r\nto similar trading in other directions--for all these reasons, good and\r\nbad, nobody cared to take the matter up seriously.\r\n\r\nNobody, that is to say, except that tiger Clemenceau. He actually\r\nthought that the honour of the Republic was at stake in the business:\r\nwas of opinion that a President should be more careful than other\r\npeople in keeping the doubtful characters of men and women of his\r\nown household under restraint. And he not only thought but spoke and\r\nacted. M. Rouvier, who was then Premier, felt himself bound to stand\r\nby the President and exculpated him from any share in the affair.\r\nThis made matters worse. For M. Grévy, when the whole transaction was\r\nfully debated, could not withstand the pressure of public opinion\r\nagainst him; Clemenceau carried his point and the President resigned.\r\nThereupon M. Rouvier thought it incumbent upon him to retire too,\r\nthough Clemenceau took pains to tell him that this was a concern\r\npurely personal to the President and not a political issue at all.\r\nThere was consequently a Presidential Election and a new Ministry at\r\nthe same time. So great was Clemenceau's influence at this juncture\r\nthat although three of the most prominent politicians in the Republic\r\nwere eager for the post, he, out of fear of the election of the\r\nirrepressible expansionist M. Ferry, persuaded the electors to favour\r\nthe appointment of the able and cool but popularly almost unknown\r\nM. Sadi-Carnot--who turned out, it may be said, quite an admirable\r\nPresident up to his outrageous assassination.\r\n\r\nBy this time Clemenceau had fully justified his claim to the\r\ndistinction of being the most formidable and relentless political\r\nantagonist known in French public life since the great Revolution.\r\nAs he would never take office himself and was moved by few personal\r\nanimosities, he stood outside the lists of competers for place. He\r\nhad definite Radical Republican principles and during all these years\r\nhe acted up to them. He was throughout opposed, as I have said, to\r\ncompromise. He fought it continuously all along the line. Moreover, he\r\nhad a profound contempt for politicians who were merely politicians.\r\n\"I have combated,\" he said, \"ideas, not persons. In my fight against\r\nRepublicans I have always respected my party. In the heat of the\r\nconflict I have never lost sight of the objects we had in common, and I\r\nhave appealed for the solidarity of the whole against the common enemy\r\nof all.\"\r\n\r\nAs, also, he triumphantly declared in a famous oration against those\r\nwho were engaged in sneering at Parliamentary Government and the\r\ntyranny of words, he was ever in favour of the greatest freedom of\r\nspeech, and even stood up for the commonplace debates which often\r\nmust have terribly bored him. \"Well, then, since I must tell you so,\r\nthese discussions which astonish you are an honour to us all. They\r\nprove conclusively our ardour in defence of ideas which we think right\r\nand beneficial. These discussions have their drawbacks: silence has\r\nmore. Yes, glory to the country where men speak, shame on the country\r\nwhere men hold their tongues. If you think to ban under the name of\r\nparliamentarism the rule of open discussion, mind this, it is the\r\nrepresentative system, it is the Republic itself against whom you are\r\nraising your hand.\"\r\n\r\nA great Parliamentarian, a great political Radical was Clemenceau the\r\nTiger of 1877 to 1893. He, more than any other man, prevented the\r\nRepublic from altogether deteriorating and kept alive the spirit of the\r\ngreat French Revolution in the minds and in the hearts of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                    THE RISE AND FALL OF BOULANGER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relations of Clemenceau to General Boulanger form an important\r\nthough comparatively brief episode in the career of the French\r\nstatesman. Boulanger was Clemenceau's cousin, and in his dealings with\r\nthis ambitious man he did not show that remarkable skill and judgment\r\nof character which distinguished him in regard to Carnot and Loubet,\r\nwhose high qualities Clemenceau was the first to recognise and make use\r\nof in the interest of the Republic. Boulanger was a good soldier in the\r\nlower grades of his profession, and owed his first important promotion\r\nto the Duc d'Aumale. This patronage he acknowledged with profound\r\ngratitude and even servility at the time; but repaid later, when he\r\nturned Radical, by what was nothing short of treacherous persecution of\r\nthe Orleanist Prince. Boulanger went even so far as to deny that he had\r\never expressed his obligations to the Duke for aid in his profession, a\r\nstatement to which the publication of his own letters at once gave the\r\nlie.\r\n\r\nThe General was, in fact, vain, ostentatious and unscrupulous. But\r\nhaving gained popularity among the rank and file of the French army\r\nby his good management of the men under his command and his sympathy\r\nwith their grievances, he was appointed Director of Infantry, and\r\nin that capacity introduced several measures of military reform and\r\nsuggested more. A little later, circumstances led him into close\r\npolitical harmony with the Radicals and their leader. At this juncture\r\nClemenceau seems to have convinced himself that good use could be made\r\nof the general, who owed his first great advance to Orleanist favour,\r\nwithout any danger to the Republic. Having, as usual, upset another\r\nshort-lived Cabinet, Clemenceau therefore exercised his influence to\r\nsecure his relation the post of War Minister in the new Administration\r\nof M. Freycinet. This was in January 1886. At first he was true to his\r\nRadical friends and carried out the programme of army reforms agreed\r\nupon between himself and Clemenceau, thus justifying that statesman's\r\nchoice and support. The general treatment of the French conscript was\r\ntaken in hand. His food was improved, his barrack discipline rendered\r\nless harsh, his relations to his officers made more human, his spirit\r\nraised by better prospects of a future career. All this was good\r\nservice to the country at a critical time and should have redounded\r\nto the credit of the Radical Party far more than to Boulanger's own\r\nglorification. This, however, was not the case. All the credit was\r\ngiven to the General himself. Hence immense personal influence from one\r\nend of the country to the other.\r\n\r\nPractically every family in France was beneficially affected, directly\r\nor indirectly, by Boulanger's measures of military reform, and thanked\r\nthe brave General for what had been done. Not a young man in the army,\r\nor out of it, but felt that his lot, when drawn for service or actually\r\nserving, had been made better by the War Minister himself. So it ever\r\nis and always has been. The individual who gives practical expression\r\nto the ideas which are forced upon him by others is the one who is\r\nregarded as the real benefactor: the real workers, as in this instance\r\nClemenceau and his friends, are forgotten.\r\n\r\nOne of the incidents which helped to enhance Boulanger's great\r\npopularity was what was known as the Schnäbele affair. This person\r\nwas a French commissary who crossed the French frontier into\r\nAlsace-Lorraine to carry out some local business with a similar German\r\nofficial which concerned both countries. He was arrested by the German\r\nmilitary authorities as not being in possession of a passport. This\r\naction may possibly have been technically justifiable, but certainly\r\nwas a high-handed proceeding conducted in a high-handed way. At that\r\ntime France was constantly feeling that she was in an inferior position\r\nto Germany, and her statesmen were slow to resent small injuries,\r\nknowing well that France was still in no position to make head against\r\nthe great German military power, still less to avenge the crushing\r\ndefeats of 1870-71. When, therefore, Boulanger took a firm stand in\r\nthe matter and upheld in a very proper way the dignity of France, the\r\nwhole country felt a sense of relief. France, then, was no longer a\r\nnegligible quantity in Europe. M. de Bismarck could not always have\r\nhis way, and Boulanger stood forth as the man who understood the real\r\nspirit of his countrymen. That was the sentiment which did much to\r\nstrengthen the General against his opponents when he began to carry out\r\na purely personal policy. He had inspired the whole nation with a sense\r\nof its own greatness.\r\n\r\nHe was then the most popular man in the country. He stood out to the\r\npeople at large as a patriotic figure with sound democratic sympathies\r\nand an eminent soldier who might lead to victory the armies of France.\r\n\r\nThenceforth Boulanger gradually became a personage round whom every\r\nkind of social and reactionary influence and intrigues of every\r\nsort were concentrated. To capture the imposing figure on the black\r\nhorse, to fill him with grandiose ideas of the splendid part he could\r\nplay, if only he would look at the real greatness and glory of his\r\ncountry through glasses less tinted with red than those of his Radical\r\nassociates, to inspire him with conceptions of national unity and\r\nsanctified religious patriotism which should bring France, the France\r\nof the grand old days, once more into being, with himself as its noble\r\nleader--this was the work which the fine ladies of the Boulevard St.\r\nGermain, hand in hand with the Catholic Church, its priests and the\r\ncultivated reactionaries generally, set themselves to accomplish.\r\nFrom this time onwards the _mot d'ordre_ to back Boulanger went round\r\nthe _salons_. Legitimists, Orleanists and Buonapartists were, on this\r\nmatter, temporarily at one. Each section hoped at the proper moment\r\nto use the possible dictator for the attainment of its own ends.\r\nThus Boulanger was diverted from the Radical camp and weaned from\r\nRadical ideas even during his period as War Minister in M. Freycinet's\r\nCabinet. So subtle is the influence of \"society\" and ecclesiastical\r\nsurroundings upon some natures, so powerful the effect of refined\r\nand charming conversation and genial flattery delicately conveyed,\r\nthat men of far stronger character than Boulanger have now and then\r\nsuccumbed to it. Only devotion to principle or ruthless personal\r\nambition can hold its own against such a combination of insidious\r\nforces dexterously employed--and women of the world and Jesuits are\r\nboth very dexterous--when once the individual to be artistically\r\ntrepanned permits himself to be experimented upon. Boulanger, though\r\nnot devoid of cleverness, was at bottom that dangerous description of\r\ndesigning good fellow who all the time means well; and he fell a victim\r\nto the delightful women and clever adventurers around him. He himself\r\nwas probably not aware that he had passed over to the enemy until the\r\nirresistible logic of events and his changed relations with his old\r\nfriends proved to him how far he had gone.\r\n\r\nM. Rouvier, a shrewd and cynical politician of the financial school,\r\nsaw through the General, understood how dangerous he might become, and\r\nrefused to accept the ex-Minister of War into the Cabinet he formed on\r\nthe fall of Freycinet. But Boulanger had now so far established himself\r\npersonally that neither a political check nor even general ridicule\r\naffected his career. Even his duel with M. Floquet, a farce in which\r\nGeneral Boulanger made himself the clown, could not shake him. Floquet\r\nwas a well-known Radical of those days, who had been a fellow-member\r\nof the League of the Rights of Man with Clemenceau at the time of the\r\nCommune. Boulanger was a soldier, accustomed to the use of arms all\r\nhis life, and reported to be a good fencer. Floquet, quite unlike his\r\nold friend of years before, scarcely knew which end of his weapon to\r\npresent to his opponent, so inexperienced was he in this sort of lethal\r\nexercise. When, therefore, the duel between the two men was arranged,\r\nthe only point discussed was how small an injury would Boulanger, in\r\nhis generosity, deign to inflict upon his Radical antagonist, in order\r\nthat the seconds might declare that \"honour is satisfied.\" No doubt\r\nClemenceau himself, who acted as one of Floquet's seconds on this\r\noccasion, took that view of the matter.\r\n\r\nWhat actually occurred was quite ludicrous. Floquet, duly instructed\r\nthereto by his own friends, stood, good harmless bourgeois as he was,\r\nlike a waxwork figure, with his rapier stuck out at arm's length\r\nstraight in front of him. No science there. But there was still less on\r\nthe other side. Boulanger, to the amazement of Clemenceau and everybody\r\non the ground, in what appeared to be a sudden stroke of madness,\r\nimmediately rushed at Floquet and his rigid skewer and, without any\r\nsuch elaborate foolishness as the laws of fence enjoin, carefully\r\nspitted his own throat on the point of Floquet's weapon. Honour was\r\nthus satisfied and ridicule began. But ridicule did not kill.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was Boulanger cured of his self-inflicted wound than he went\r\non much as he did before. Having ceased to be Minister for War, he\r\nwas sent down to command an army corps at Clermont-Ferrand. According\r\nto all discipline, and regulations duly to be observed by generals at\r\nlarge, this kept the man appointed out of Paris. Not so Boulanger. He\r\nvisited the capital at least twice. Thereupon he was deprived of his\r\ncommand and his name was removed from the Army List. That, by the rules\r\nof war and politics, ought to have finished him. But it didn't. The\r\nRadicals and Republicans had still no idea what an ugly Frankenstein\r\nthey had created for themselves. True, Clemenceau had declared\r\ndefinitely against his own protégé the moment he saw the line he was\r\ntaking; but he underrated entirely the position to which Boulanger had\r\nattained, not only among the reactionaries but in the hearts and minds\r\nof the French people. For Boulanger, now gifted with a free hand, went\r\ninto the political arena at once, and was a candidate simultaneously\r\nfor the Nord and the Dordogne: provincial districts with, of course, a\r\ntotally different sort of electorate from that of the capital, where\r\nthe _brav' Général_ with his fine figure on horseback was already the\r\nhero of the Parisians. He was elected and sat for the Nord.\r\n\r\nStill Clemenceau, far-seeing and sagacious as he generally is in\r\nhis judgment of political events and personal character, failed\r\nto appreciate what his cousin had drifted into rather than had\r\ndeliberately worked for. Nor perhaps did he estimate highly enough\r\neither the cleverness or the unscrupulousness of the men and women\r\nwho were backing him. Certain it is that, although Boulangism was now\r\nbecoming a powerful political cult, Clemenceau and other advanced men,\r\nsuch as my old friend Paul Brousse, President of the Paris Municipal\r\nCouncil, were still of opinion that Boulanger was going down rather\r\nthan up. It was a mistake that might have cost not only the Radicals\r\nbut the French Republic as a whole very dear. For the General had the\r\nqualities of his defects. Agreeable, good-natured, frank, accessible\r\nand friendly to all who approached him, with enough ability to gauge\r\nfairly well what was going on around him, loving display for its own\r\nsake, and ever ready to pose in dignified and pleasing attitude, before\r\na populace by no means averse from well-managed advertisement, while\r\nnot apparently bent upon forcing his own will or dictatorship upon the\r\ncountry--Boulanger, both before and after his election for the Nord,\r\nwas much more formidable than he looked to those who only measured his\r\npower from the standpoint of wide intelligence. This the rather because\r\nthere was no lack of money to push his pretensions to high place.\r\n\r\nBoulanger came to the front also at a time when the bourgeois Republic\r\n(owing to the weakness, incapacity and instability of the bourgeois\r\npoliticians themselves) was discredited and was believed to be\r\ntottering. Clemenceau's own unceasing campaign against widespread\r\nabuses and incapable Ministers was largely responsible for this. There\r\nwas a general sense of insecurity and unsettlement, engendered by the\r\nfall of Administration after Administration, due to political or\r\nfinancial proceedings of doubtful character, exposed and denounced\r\nby Clemenceau and the Radicals themselves. Some of the Radicals and\r\nintellectuals even now supported Boulanger as an alternative to\r\nperpetual upsets. Disgusted with lawyers, professional politicians\r\nand place-hunters of high and low degree, the people likewise were\r\nagain on the look-out for a saviour of France who should secure for\r\nthem democracy without corruption, and honest leadership devoid of\r\nSocialism. The old story, in fact.\r\n\r\nAt this particular moment, too, the organised forces in Paris, the army\r\nand the gendarmerie, were Boulangists almost to a man. The danger,\r\ntherefore, of the Boulangist agitation now being carried on alike\r\nin Paris and in the Departments seemed to a looker-on to be growing\r\nmore serious every day. This, however, continued not to be the view\r\nof Clemenceau and his party. They thought, in spite of the voting in\r\nthe Nord and the Dordogne and the apparent popularity of the General\r\nin Paris, that the whole thing would prove a mere flash in the pan;\r\nthat the good sense and Republican conservatism of the French people\r\nwould display itself when peril really threatened the Republic; and\r\nthat Boulanger would be even less successful than the Duc de Broglie.\r\nThen came the General Elections. Boulanger was candidate for Paris.\r\nOnce more the obvious evidence of his great popularity was overlooked\r\nby the Clemenceau group, the Boulangist fervour went on unrecognised,\r\nand it seemed that it might depend upon the General himself at any\r\nmoment--as indeed proved to be the case--whether he should follow in\r\nthe footsteps of Louis Napoleon and accomplish a successful _coup\r\nd'état_, or fall permanently into the background. But up to the last\r\nmoment his opponents could not believe that a general with no great\r\nmilitary career behind him, a citizen with no great name to conjure\r\nwith, a politician with no great programme to attract voters, could win\r\nParis or become master of France.\r\n\r\nThe crisis really was the more acute since there was no rival\r\npersonality, no Republican of admitted ability and distinction ready\r\nto stake his reputation against Boulanger. Though Clemenceau, as\r\nthe preparations for the election proceeded and Boulanger's growing\r\nstrength became manifest, now did his utmost to stem the tide, there\r\nwas no doubt that, failing a really powerful opponent, Boulanger would\r\nhold the winning place at the close of the poll. He took up a bold\r\nposition. He was the hero of the hour. The whole contest was admirably\r\nstage-managed and advertised on his side. He rode through the city on\r\nhis black horse, a fine figure of a man, full of confidence of victory,\r\nthe halo of a coming well-earned triumph around him. It was universally\r\nfelt that the previous votes of the provinces would be quite eclipsed\r\nby the vote of the capital. Parisians, peasants and miners, small\r\nowners and proletariat would for once be together.\r\n\r\nThis was the unshaken opinion of his friends and followers, who seemed\r\nin those exciting days to have with them the great majority of the\r\npeople. On the other side a wave of incapacity was actually flooding\r\nthe intelligence of his opponents. Instead of putting forward a really\r\nrepresentative man, either Republican or Socialist, with a fine\r\ndemocratic record behind him, they made an absolutely contemptible\r\nchoice for their champion. One Jacques, an obscure liquor-dealer, whom\r\nnobody ever heard of before the election, or gave a thought to after\r\nit, was chosen to fight for Paris against the General. This man had\r\nnever done or said or written anything that anybody could remember,\r\nor would remember if he could. If no Radical Republican was ready to\r\nstand, Joffrin, an old member of the Commune and a skilled artisan most\r\nloyal to his principles, always returning at once to his trade when\r\nhe failed to be elected for the National Assembly, would have been a\r\nfar better and more worthy candidate in every way. The election then\r\nwould have been a conflict between the enthusiasm of social revolution\r\nand the fervour of chauvinist reaction. As it was, the Boulangists\r\ncould say and did say with truth that the General would represent the\r\ncitizens of Paris much more genuinely than Jacques. The result of this\r\nerror of tactics could, have been foreseen from the first. General\r\nBoulanger won by a heavy majority.\r\n\r\nThat evening saw the crisis of the whole Boulangist agitation. Such\r\na victory at such a time called for immediate and decisive action.\r\nThat was the universal opinion. A political triumph so dramatic and so\r\nconclusive could only find a fitting climax in the victor proclaiming\r\nhimself to be a Cromwell, a Monk or a Napoleon. Nothing less was hoped\r\nfor by the reactionists: nothing less was feared by the Republicans.\r\nThe figures of the poll were welcomed with enthusiastic cheering all\r\nalong the boulevards, and the Boulangist anthem, \"_En revenant de la\r\nRevue_,\" was played from one end of Paris to the other. The ball was\r\nat the General's feet. He might have failed to win his goal, but all\r\nParis expected he would make a good try for it. This meant that the\r\nvery same night he should either go straight to the Elysée himself or\r\nmake some bold stroke for which he had prepared beforehand, that would\r\nfire the imagination of the people. Such was the prevailing impression.\r\nThe General celebrated his election for the City of Paris at dinner at\r\nDurand's famous restaurant, surrounded by his intimate supporters. The\r\nexcitement outside was tremendous. Hour after hour passed. Nothing was\r\ndone, nothing apparently had been made ready. The strain of waiting\r\nbecame almost unbearable. The crowd gradually got weary of anticipating\r\nthe opening of a drama whose prologue had so roused their expectations.\r\nAt last, instead of staying to watch the first scenes of a revolution,\r\nthey took themselves off quietly to bed. Boulanger's chance of\r\nobtaining supremacy was gone.\r\n\r\nIt was always said that, backed by the Radicals, and supported by\r\nthe President, the Minister of the Interior, M. Constans, a most\r\nresolute and unscrupulous man, who was himself in the crowd outside\r\nthe restaurant, was the main cause of this miserable fiasco. Strong\r\nprecautions had been taken against any attempt at violence. Powerful\r\nforces whose loyalty to the Republic was beyond question had been\r\nsubstituted for brigades of known Boulangist tendencies. That M.\r\nConstans would not, under the conditions, have stuck at trifles was\r\nwell known. He was kept at a distance from France for years afterwards,\r\non account of his ugly character, in the capacity of French Ambassador\r\nat Constantinople, a city where at that time such a trifling peccadillo\r\nas murder was scarcely noticed. So Boulanger knew what to expect.\r\nMoreover, Clemenceau and the Radical Republicans, as well as Jaurès and\r\nSocialists of every shade of opinion, had become thoroughly alarmed by\r\nwhat they had heard and seen during the election, and would not have\r\ngiven way without a fight to the death. The jubilant group at Durand's,\r\nintimidated by these assumed facts, and Boulanger with his lack of\r\ndetermination and easy self-indulgence, let the opportunity slip.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of excuses and explanations were made for the hesitation of\r\nthe General to provoke civil war. But on that one night he should have\r\nmade his position secure or have died in the attempt. Success was, so\r\nfar as a foreigner on the spot could judge, quite possible. It might\r\neven have been achieved without any forcible action. There was no\r\ncertainty that, when the move decided upon was actually made, either\r\ntroops or the people would have sided against the hero of the day. But\r\nthat hero failed to rise to the level of the occasion, and the result\r\nwas fatal to the immediate prospects of himself and his followers.\r\nA warrant was issued for his arrest and he ran away from Paris. He\r\nnow became an object of pity rather than of alarm. He was condemned\r\nin his absence, and not long afterwards his suicide on the grave of\r\nhis mistress, in Brussels, ended his career. Thus the estimate which\r\nClemenceau had formed of his permanent influence was justified. But it\r\nwas a narrow escape. The three pretenders who had come to France to\r\nwatch the final development soon found their way across the frontier.\r\nNevertheless, General Boulanger, with all his weakness and hesitation,\r\nwas for many months the most dangerous enemy the Republic ever faced.\r\nHis downfall helped also to add to the number of Clemenceau's bitter\r\nenemies, and was partly instrumental in bringing about the political\r\ndisaster which befell him later. For the Radicals who had been deceived\r\nby Boulanger cherished animosity against the Radical leader for reasons\r\nwhich, though quite incompatible, were decisive for them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                         PANAMA AND DRAGUIGNAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great Panama Canal Affair was only one of many financial scandals\r\nwhich seriously damaged the good fame of the French Republic founded\r\nupon the fall of the Empire, and consecrated by the collapse of the\r\nCommune of Paris. But this Panama scandal was by far the most important\r\nand most nefarious, alike in respect to the amount of money involved,\r\nthe position and character of the people mixed up in it, and the wide\r\nramifications of wholesale corruption throughout the political world\r\nthat were in the end revealed.\r\n\r\nM. Ferdinand de Lesseps, the originator and organiser of the Suez\r\nCanal, was a man of quite exceptional ability, energy and force\r\nof character. He carried through his great project in the face of\r\nobstacles, political and financial, that would certainly have broken\r\nthe heart and frustrated the purpose of a weaker personality. At no\r\nperiod did he show any disposition to keep the canal under harmful\r\nrestrictions, and the Khedive Ismail Pasha, though a Turk of no\r\nscruples, who backed him throughout, also took a very wide view of the\r\nservices which the canal would render to the world at large. It was\r\nto be neutral and open under the same conditions to the ships of all\r\nnations. Unfortunately, England, whose commerce has chiefly benefited\r\nby the canal, bitterly opposed its construction, going so far at one\r\ntime as actually to prohibit the Khedive from carrying on the canal\r\nworks in his own territory, thus occasioning considerable delay. As\r\nit happened, however, this delay itself was turned by de Lesseps to\r\nthe advantage of the Canal Company, as he used the time to create new\r\nengines for excavation which in the end expedited the completion of the\r\nwaterway.\r\n\r\nThe result of this ignorant British opposition was that the finance\r\nof the great enterprise was chiefly provided in France, and, when the\r\ncanal was first opened in 1869, it was considered, as in fact it was,\r\na triumph of French sagacity and foresight over the obstructionist\r\njealousy of England. This view was accompanied also by natural\r\njubilation at the consequent increase of French influence in Egypt\r\nitself. Count Ferdinand de Lesseps, therefore, became a great French\r\nhero who, by his capacity, persistence and diplomacy, had not only\r\ngained glory for France and extended her power, but had also furnished\r\nhis countrymen with an excellent investment for their savings, on\r\nwhich British commerce was paying the interest. His popularity in\r\nFrance was well earned and unbounded. The work of de Lesseps was, in\r\nfact, regarded as the one great and indisputable success of the French\r\nEmpire. Anything which he took in hand thereafter was certain to prove\r\nof great value to the country and an assured benefit to those who\r\nfollowed his financial lead. He was also a lucky man. He and his set\r\nhad won against heavy odds.\r\n\r\nIt is true the cost of the Suez Canal had been more than double his\r\noriginal estimate, even up to the time when it was first opened, and\r\nmany millions sterling had been expended since; it was likewise the\r\nfact that his great idea had taken fully ten years to realise in the\r\nshape of a completed enterprise. But this was the larger tribute to\r\nhis foresight and power of overcoming obstacles due either to natural\r\ncauses or to the malignity of enemies. Thus Ferdinand de Lesseps, ten\r\nyears after the Suez Canal had been made available for shipping between\r\nthe Mediterranean and the Red Sea, held an unequalled position in the\r\neyes of French engineers, French bankers and, what was more important,\r\nFrench investors.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1879 M. de Lesseps, following the course adopted\r\nby him in the case of the isthmus of Suez, called a Congress of the\r\nnations to consider the entire project of a Panama Canal. There was\r\nnothing new in the matter. The line of the canal had been surveyed\r\nby a capable French engineer nearly forty years before. The Congress\r\nestimated the actual cost of the construction of the canal at about\r\n£25,000,000, or a little more than the highest sum thought sufficient\r\nby the English engineer of the Panama Railroad. But the mere figures\r\nare of little importance. That they were quite insufficient, as the\r\nbusiness was managed, has since been abundantly proved. But at first\r\nthere is no reason to believe that de Lesseps was other than quite\r\nstraightforward. He had bought the concession for the canal from\r\nMr. Buonaparte Wyse, who had acquired it from the United States of\r\nColombia, through whose territory the canal as surveyed ran. That\r\nthis concession itself had previously been found very difficult to\r\nfinance in any shape was a matter of common knowledge; that also the\r\ncanal, when constructed, might prove far less valuable in every way\r\nthan was calculated for world commerce was the opinion of many skilled\r\nengineers. But then the same things had been said about Suez. So the\r\nFrench public rushed in to subscribe the money required for the French\r\nCompany immediately formed by M. de Lesseps to exploit the concession.\r\n\r\nThe great name of de Lesseps covered the whole risk and rendered\r\ncriticism quite useless. But the management of the excavation was\r\nwildly incapable and inconceivably extravagant. It was very soon\r\ndiscovered that the original estimates were absurdly at variance\r\nwith the cost of the real work to be done. The entire enterprise, as\r\nundertaken in 1884, was entered upon possibly in good faith, but in\r\na wholly irresponsible and ignorant manner. In spite of warnings as\r\nto the certainty of encountering exceptional obstacles, no steps were\r\ntaken to provide against contingencies, to inform the shareholders\r\nas to the position, or to revise the plans in accordance with the\r\nfacts. The canal was inspected by M. Rousseau at the end of 1885. This\r\nengineer gave a most unfavourable report in regard to the excavations\r\nand constructions already carried out at vast expense, and the\r\nenormous additional sum needed to give any chance of completing the\r\nworks. Instead of honestly facing this most unpromising situation and\r\ndisclosing to the shareholders the real state of the case, or declaring\r\nthat at least three times the amount would be required to bring the\r\nproject to a satisfactory conclusion, and calling for this huge sum\r\nat once, the directors resorted to all the worst tactics of the\r\nunscrupulous promoter. This part of the matter went into the hands of\r\nM. Jacques Reinach and M. Cornelius Herz, names and persons afterwards\r\ncovered with obloquy in connection with the whole affair. They set to\r\nwork systematically, and were restrained by no inconvenient scruples.\r\nStrong political influence in both Chambers was needed in order to\r\nobtain the passing of the Panama Lottery Bill. Strong political\r\ninfluence was bought, though the Bill itself was not carried. From\r\n1885-86 onwards this wholesale bribery was continued on an enormous\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThe company was as careless of men's lives as it was of shareholders'\r\nmoney. Labourers from all parts of the world had been gathered\r\ntogether in what was then a deadly climate, without proper sanitation\r\nor reasonable medical attendance. Some time prior to the financial\r\ntroubles it was known that such anarchy and horror prevailed on\r\nthe Isthmus that intervention by the French Government, or even by\r\nan international commission, was called for. Nothing but the great\r\nreputation of de Lesseps could possibly have upheld such a state of\r\nthings, or have obtained more and still more money to perpetuate the\r\nchaos. Even when the truth as to the frightful mortality of the men\r\nemployed and the incredible waste, due to incompetence and corruption,\r\nmust have been known to the President of the Company (M. de Lesseps\r\nhimself) and his fellow-directors, when, likewise, they must have been\r\nconvinced that the company was drifting into a hopeless position, they\r\nstill appealed to their countrymen for more and more and more money\r\nto throw into the bottomless quagmire at Panama, and sink of French\r\nsavings in Paris, to which the whole company had been reduced.\r\n\r\nBy the year 1888 no less than 1,400,000,000 francs had been expended in\r\none way or another, while not one-third of the necessary work had been\r\ndone. Of that £55,000,000 nominal amount not a few millions sterling\r\nfound their way into the pockets of deputies, senators, and even\r\nAcademicians, to say nothing of commissions and brokerages of more or\r\nless legitimate character.\r\n\r\nPoliticians in France are no worse than politicians in other countries.\r\nBut the proportion of well-to-do men among them is less than elsewhere.\r\nThere was consequently a margin of them always on the look-out for an\r\nopportunity of adding to their income, and this margin was much larger\r\nin the National Assembly before payment of members than it is to-day.\r\nFor such men the Panama finance was a glorious opportunity. Nobody\r\ncould suspect de Lesseps of being consciously a party to a fraud. To\r\nmake a French venture like the Panama a great success, in spite of\r\nall difficulties, was a patriotic service. To receive good pay for\r\ndoing good work was a happy combination of circumstances none the less\r\ngratifying that, the work being honestly done, remuneration followed or\r\npreceded in hard cash. The extent to which this form of corruption was\r\ncarried and the high level in the political world to which streams from\r\nthe Panama Pactolus were forced up is only partially known even now.\r\nBut so wide was the flow and so deep the stream that, when the outcry\r\nagainst the Company began in earnest, statesmen whose personal honour\r\nhad never been challenged were afflicted with such alarm, on the facts\r\nbeing laid before them, that they did their very utmost to suppress\r\nfull investigation.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not easy to accomplish. For there were no fewer\r\nthan 800,000 French investors in the Panama Company. All of these were\r\nvoters and all had friends. It became a question, therefore, whether it\r\nwas more dangerous to the Republic and its statesmen--for personal as\r\nwell as political considerations came in--to compel full publicity, or\r\nto hush the whole thing up as far as possible. Meanwhile, the public,\r\nand important journals not suspected of Panamism, took the whole thing\r\ndown from the Cabinet and the Bureaux into the street.\r\n\r\nFor the opponents of the Republic it was a fine opening. That enormous\r\nsums out of the £55,000,000 subscribed had been paid away to senators,\r\ndeputies and Academicians, for services rendered, was certain. Who\r\nhad got the money, and under what conditions? Imputations of the most\r\nsinister character were made all round. Paris rang with accusations\r\nof fraud. That more than a hundred deputies were concerned in Panama\r\ncorruption is a matter of common knowledge. One who was in a position\r\nto know all the facts declared that more than a hundred who were mixed\r\nup in other nefarious transactions used Panama to divert attention from\r\ntheir own malfeasances. However that may be, public opinion, excited by\r\nthe clamour and denunciations of eight hundred thousand shareholders\r\nand electors, clove to Panama. It became an instrument of political\r\nwarfare as well as of personal delation. The obvious determination of\r\nPresidents Carnot and Loubet to prevent a clear statement from being\r\nissued and the Directors prosecuted only rendered the sufferers more\r\ndetermined to get at the facts and wreak vengeance on somebody.\r\n\r\nThere were two views as to Count de Lesseps--to give him his title,\r\nwhich had its value in the Affair--and his conduct in the Panama Canal\r\nCompany. There were those who held that de Lesseps, beginning as an\r\nenthusiast, and believing himself perhaps to be inspired in everything\r\nhe undertook, no sooner found that his carelessness, in disregarding\r\nreal natural difficulties and in organising the excavations on the\r\nspot, must result in failure, unless he could obtain unlimited\r\nresources, and doubtful of ultimate success even then, began at once\r\nto display the worst side of his character. The successful adventurer\r\nbecame, by degrees, the desperate gambler with the savings of his\r\ncountrymen. Instead of regarding himself as the trustee of the people\r\nwho, on the strength of his reputation and character, had risked their\r\nmoney, he deliberately shut his eyes to the real facts. He resorted to\r\nall the tricks of an unscrupulous charlatan, misrepresented the truth\r\nin every respect and had no thought for any other consideration than\r\nto get in more funds. For this purpose he paraded the country, making\r\nthe utmost use of his personal and social advantages, and losing no\r\nopportunity for unworthy advertisement. All this time he knew perfectly\r\nwell that his enterprise was doomed. Consequently, there was little\r\nto choose between de Lesseps and Reinach, Herz and the rest of them,\r\nexcept that he was perhaps the greatest criminal of all. Such was the\r\nview of the promoter-in-chief taken by lawyers and men of business who\r\nlooked upon the whole matter as a venture standing by itself, to be\r\njudged by the ordinary rules of financial probity.\r\n\r\nOn the other side a capable and influential minority regarded\r\nde Lesseps as an enthusiast, a man of high character and noble\r\nconceptions, quite devoid of the power of strict analysis of any matter\r\npresented to him, and destitute of common sense. His financial methods\r\nand commercial obliquities were due to his overweening confidence in\r\nhis own judgment and faith in his good fortune to pull him through\r\nagainst all probabilities. The one great success he had achieved\r\nrendered him a man not to be argued with or considered on the plane of\r\nordinary mortals. He saw the object he was aiming at, felt convinced\r\nhe would accomplish it, regarded all who differed from him as ignorant\r\nor malignant, and went straight ahead to get money, not for his own\r\npurposes but in order to carry out the second magnificent scheme to\r\nwhich he had committed himself. Corruption and malversation by others\r\nwere no concern of his.\r\n\r\nPresident Sadi-Carnot, a cold, silent, upright man, little given to\r\nallow his feelings to inflame him at any time, warmly took this view of\r\nde Lesseps' character. M. Carnot had been brought into close contact\r\nwith de Lesseps on another of his vast projects. The President, like\r\nmany others, refused to look at the Panama matter from the point of\r\nview of fraud or imposture. Money was for de Lesseps always a means,\r\nnever an end. When the whole matter was brought before him, and one of\r\nthe legal personages whose duty it was to investigate the whole of the\r\nfacts came to a very harsh conclusion as to de Lesseps' responsibility\r\nfor the waste, corruption and malversation, M. Carnot said with some\r\nvivacity: \"No, no; M. de Lesseps is not a man of bad faith. I should\r\nrather consider him punctilious. Only his natural vehemence carries\r\nhim away; he is a bad reasoner, and has no power of calculation. Hence\r\nmany regrettable acts on his part, done without any intention of\r\ninjuring anybody. I knew him well, having seen him very close, when his\r\nimagination suggested to him the scheme for excavating an inland sea in\r\nAfrica. A commission of engineers, of whom I was one, was appointed to\r\nhear him and study his proposal. We had no difficulty in showing that\r\nthe whole thing was a pure chimera. He seemed very much astonished, and\r\nwe saw that we had not convinced him. Take it from me as a certainty\r\nthat he would have spent millions upon millions to create his sea, and\r\nthat with the best of good faith in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis was probably the truth, so far as de Lesseps himself was\r\npersonally concerned. Promoters, discoverers and inventors of genius\r\nare men of mighty faith in their respective enterprises. As a great\r\nanarchist once said of his own special nostrum for regenerating\r\nhumanity at a blow: \"All is moral that helps it, all is immoral that\r\nhinders it.\" So with de Lesseps. All was moral that got in money to\r\nconstruct his canal: all was immoral that checked the flow of cash\r\nto the Isthmus. But an enthusiast of this temper, \"without power of\r\ncalculation,\" is a very dangerous man, not only to the subscribers\r\nto his shares, but to the Republican politicians who confined their\r\nenthusiasm to the acquisition of hard cash for use not in Panama but in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the Panama Canal Company collapsed, and the thing was put into\r\nliquidation. But that was not the end of it. All sorts of schemes were\r\nafoot for carrying on the works and completing the canal before the\r\nconcession expired in 1893. Although, however, from the date of the\r\nbreakdown onwards--when it was stated that fully £70,000,000 would be\r\nneeded in addition to the amount already expended or frittered away to\r\ncarry out the canal--most virulent attacks were continually made upon\r\nprominent politicians and financiers, as well as upon the Directors of\r\nthe Company, neither the political nor the legal consequences of the\r\ndisaster were felt to the full extent until four years later. Judicial\r\ninvestigations, it is true, were going on. But it was an open secret\r\nthat, in spite of the losses and complaints of the shareholders, and\r\nthe strong desire of the public that the whole vast transaction should\r\nbe exposed in every detail, the anxiety of men in high place was to\r\ncalm down natural feeling in the matter. What made this attitude more\r\nsuspicious was the fact that the Government had certainly not shown\r\nitself unfavourable to the scheme, but on the contrary had helped it,\r\neven when the gravest doubts had been thrown upon its practicability,\r\nat a cost vastly exceeding anything contemplated by the Company. In\r\nfact, an atmosphere of general distrust pervaded Paris and the whole\r\nof France. Yet Panama still had its friends, and it was believed that\r\nsomehow or other the affair would be tided over.\r\n\r\nBut there was a good deal more to come. Things, in fact, now took\r\nthat dramatic turn which seems the rule in France with affairs which\r\ndirectly or indirectly influence high politics and high finance. There\r\nwere people who believed that the entire enterprise could be set on\r\nits legs, although parts of the recent excavations were deteriorating\r\nand some of them had been covered already with luxuriant tropical\r\ngrowths which one imaginative critic spoke of as \"forests.\" Either the\r\nGovernment, they thought, could be forced to take up the enterprise\r\nitself, or at any rate would think it best, in view of what had\r\nalready been done, to support de Lesseps in a fresh scheme, should the\r\nconcession be renewed. This, no doubt, was the opinion of M. Gauthier,\r\nwho urged the Government in the Assembly to appoint a commission to\r\nprepare plans for the completion of the Canal. This, he declared, was\r\nthe only means of safeguarding the interests of the shareholders and\r\nthe many hundreds of millions of francs sunk by poor French investors\r\nin this great enterprise.\r\n\r\nSuch a daring proposal necessarily raised the whole question of the\r\nresponsibility for the serious engineering and financial fiasco. The\r\nGovernment was at once charged from several quarters, not as being\r\nanswerable for past mistakes in supporting the Panama Company, but with\r\npresent obliquity in screening and protecting delinquents who should\r\nlong since have been brought to justice. One deputy vehemently declared\r\nthat the only reason why no adequate action was taken was that \"men\r\npossessed of great names and high positions\" checked any attempt to\r\nhandle the scandal boldly. Other deputies declaimed with equal warmth\r\nagainst throwing good money after bad. Meanwhile rumours floated round\r\nthe Chamber as to the number of deputies who had put their services at\r\nthe disposal of the Company for money received. Later, this accusation\r\ntook definite shape as a formal accusation that fifty deputies had\r\nreceived among them the sum of £120,000. Senators and Academicians were\r\nin the same galley. Exaggeration was imputed, but the figures were\r\nproved afterwards to be less than the truth. Then everybody concerning\r\nwhose position there could be the slightest doubt was accused of having\r\n\"touched.\"\r\n\r\nEven MM. Rouvier and Floquet were taunted with having accepted large\r\nsums. The Chamber passed a resolution \"calling for prompt and vigorous\r\naction against all who have incurred responsibilities in the Panama\r\naffair.\" This might mean anything or nothing. It was pointed out,\r\nhowever, by a high authority that a judicial inquiry was proceeding all\r\nthe time. But the public became impatient because nothing was done to\r\nstop the campaign of vilification on the one hand or to prosecute the\r\nDirectors on the other; though de Lesseps was being denounced daily in\r\nthe press as a fraudulent adventurer. Excitement ran very high. The\r\nshareholders and some of the deputies cried aloud for justice.\r\n\r\nMatters being thus exceptionally perturbed, Baron Jacques Reinach,\r\nthe chief agent in the manipulation of political corruption, committed\r\nsuicide by apoplexy. That was the gruesome explanation given in the\r\npress of this financier's sudden death. His fellow Semite, Cornelius\r\nHerz, survived the tragedy. Just at this moment, when everybody thought\r\nthat something must be done, the Panama Concession was extended for a\r\nyear. The Panamists took heart again and believed all would blow over.\r\nSo the ups and downs of public expectation went on.\r\n\r\nThen, quite suddenly and without any general notification, all the\r\nDirectors of the Panama Canal Company, Count Ferdinand de Lesseps,\r\nM. C. de Lesseps, M. Fontane, M. Eiffel and M. Cottu were formally\r\ncharged in court with having resorted to fraudulent methods in order to\r\nengender confidence in chimerical schemes, and with obtaining credits\r\non imaginary facts, squandering the money of the shareholders and\r\nlending themselves to most nefarious practices. A terrible indictment!\r\n\r\nBy this time all who cherished a political or personal grudge against\r\nany public man of note had no better or surer means of discrediting\r\nhim than by imputing to him some connection with the Panama affair.\r\nMud of that sort was warranted to stick. Never was there a greater\r\nscandal. Never were people more credulous. Never did political feeling\r\nrun higher, and never certainly was there a keener anxiety to connect\r\nleading Republicans with the seamy side of the concern. The more\r\nthat could be done in this way the better for the Conservatives and\r\nanti-Republicans who still constituted a very formidable combination\r\nin Parliament and in the press. It was not likely, therefore, that\r\nClemenceau would be able to escape criticism and calumny if he had been\r\nin any way connected with men some of whom were then rightly regarded\r\nas malefactors.\r\n\r\nIn a time of so much excitement it was easy to mix up truth and fiction\r\nto an extent which would render it extremely difficult for Clemenceau\r\nto clear the public mind of allegations made against him, however false\r\nthey might be. All Clemenceau's enemies, and he had not a few, took\r\nadvantage of the situation to try and overwhelm him with obloquy. Now\r\nwas the opportunity to pay off many old scores; and they set to work\r\nto do it with whole-souled zest and vitriolic acrimony. Circumstances\r\naided them. They did not stick at trifles in their efforts to crush\r\nthe Radical leader who had fought the good fight against reaction and\r\nImperialism with such vigour and success for so many long years. M.\r\nClemenceau was at this time editor of _La Justice_, a journal founded\r\nby himself and written by men of ability, most of whom are still his\r\nfriends. The tone of the paper and the style of the contributions were\r\nno more calculated to bring over recruits from his adversaries than\r\nwere his speeches and tactics in the Assembly. He was ever a fighter\r\nwith tongue and with pen. Though he wrote little, if anything, in _La\r\nJustice_ himself, the inspiration came from its editor. One thing he\r\nlacked, and always has lacked--money. If now they could only get hold\r\nof evidence that Clemenceau was contaminated with Panama, the worst foe\r\nof French obscurantism would be put out of action and his influence\r\npermanently destroyed. So they calculated. And not without good reason,\r\nas afterwards appeared.\r\n\r\nCornelius Herz, the co-corrupter of political impeccables, with\r\nJacques Reinach, his \"apoplectic\" fellow-Jew, had subscribed £1,000\r\nto _La Justice_ in its early days. What could be better? A Semite of\r\nSemites, a Panamist of Panamists, he it was who with sinister features\r\nand corrupt record stood forth as the dexterous wire-puller of the\r\nmalignant marionette, Georges Clemenceau. If _La Justice_ had been\r\ntainted with the accursed thing, Clemenceau had had his share, and\r\nthe lion's share, too, in this wretched swindle. Did anybody really\r\ncare what a journal of small circulation like _La Justice_ published\r\nor stood for? Certainly not. But Clemenceau, the terrible leader of\r\nthe Left, the upsetter of Ministries, the creator of Presidents,\r\nthe overthrower of the Church and the enemy of all religion, here\r\nwas a man worth buying; and beyond all question Clemenceau had been\r\nbought--bought by Reinach and Herz, whose tool, therefore, he was and\r\nhad been! The calumnies were credible; for if senators and Academicians\r\nhad succumbed to the wiles of the serpents of Old Jewry, why should\r\nnot the Aristides of Draguignan have fallen a victim to the astute\r\nde Lesseps and his \"_entourage du Ghetto_\"? Nor did this wind up the\r\nindictment. There was more to come. A group of rascals of the Titus\r\nOates type were set to work, to put incriminating facts on record in\r\nwriting, behind the scenes. They forged the endorsement as well as the\r\nbill. Documents of this character proved to the complete satisfaction\r\nof all who wished to believe it that Clemenceau was corrupt. The very\r\nfact that he was known not to be well-off strengthened the case against\r\nhim. The empty sack could not stand upright! The _Petit Journal_, a\r\npaper of great circulation, was foremost in all this business, and its\r\neditor, M. Judet, distinguished himself by his exquisite malignity amid\r\nthe crowd of Clemenceau's detractors.\r\n\r\nIt was an ugly experience. Panama was dinned into Clemenceau's ears\r\ndaily. And there was enough to go upon to make the attacks most\r\ngalling. Herz had been a large subscriber to the funds of Clemenceau's\r\norgan. Moreover, Reinach and Herz had called upon him, though not\r\nhe upon them. That was quite enough. The assailants did not stop to\r\ninquire when Herz ceased to have anything to do with _La Justice_,\r\nneither did they investigate who sent Reinach and Herz to the Radical\r\nleader, nor what passed between Clemenceau and the two Jewish\r\nfinanciers. They were only too glad to be able to take the whole thing\r\nfor granted and to strengthen any weak links in the chain of evidence\r\nby the suborned perjuries of M. Norton and his colleagues.\r\n\r\nSo it went on. The fact that first the murdered President Carnot,\r\nwho could not believe that de Lesseps was worse than a misguided\r\nenthusiast, and then President Loubet, who wished to deal with the\r\nentire matter in a thoroughly judicial fashion, had owed their\r\npositions to Clemenceau's nomination and support rendered the hunting\r\ndown of their political friend a delightful pastime for the whole\r\nreactionary combination. Things had come to such a pass that the\r\ncommon opinion grew that there was \"something in it.\" People actually\r\nbelieved that Clemenceau really had wrecked his entire career and ruled\r\nhimself out of public life by taking bribes like the hundred other\r\ndeputies, when he had refused to accept time after time positions which\r\nwould have given him control of the national treasury and of France.\r\n\r\nClemenceau was quite unmoved by the storm of detraction which raged\r\naround him. He bided his time with a coolness that could scarcely\r\nhave been expected from a man of his character. At length his chance\r\ncame. The whole affair was brought up again before the National\r\nAssembly. Clemenceau rose to defend himself against this long campaign\r\nof successful misrepresentation. So great had been the effect of the\r\nattacks upon him that rarely, if ever, has a favourite orator stood\r\nup to address a more hostile audience. It seemed as if he had not a\r\nsingle friend in the whole House. Not a sound of greeting was heard.\r\nHe was met with cold and obviously hostile silence. Clemenceau dealt\r\nin his most telling manner with his own personal conduct throughout.\r\nHe completely immolated his accusers and dissipated their calumnies.\r\nWhen he sat down, the whole Assembly, which had received him as if\r\npersuaded of his guilt, cheered him enthusiastically as a much wronged\r\nman. A greater triumph could hardly be. The condemnation in open court\r\nof the forgers, whose nefarious malpractices had built up the edifice\r\nof calumny and misrepresentation upon which Clemenceau's enemies relied\r\nfor the proof of their case, cleared the atmosphere so far as his\r\npersonal integrity was concerned.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately for Clemenceau, there were other charges against\r\nhim from which he could not hope to clear himself, and would not have\r\ncleared himself if he could. Now all his political crimes were recited\r\nagainst him at once. He had been the means of bringing to naught M.\r\nJules Ferry's great schemes of colonial expansion in the East. He had\r\nopposed running the risk of war for the sake of Egypt. He had been\r\nlargely instrumental in causing the failure of General Boulanger, whom\r\nnot only reactionists but many vigorous Radicals admired and believed\r\nin. He had never lost a chance of pointing to the danger of priestly\r\ninfluence and the anti-Republican attitude of the heads of the Catholic\r\nChurch. By his action in favour of the strikers at Carmaux, whom he\r\nwent down himself specially to encourage and support, he had alienated\r\na large section of the bourgeoisie.\r\n\r\nNot the least weighty of the charges brought against him, and one which\r\nperhaps had as much effect as any in bringing about the crushing result\r\nof the poll, was that Clemenceau had steadily opposed the alliance with\r\nRussia. This was regarded as still further and more conclusive evidence\r\nof downright treachery to France. Those were the days when France felt\r\nthe need for an ally who could give her powerful military support, and\r\nher people were not disposed to inquire too closely into the character\r\nof the Czar's Government. Clemenceau regarded the connection as\r\nimmoral, injurious, calculated to reduce France's democratic influence\r\nand to lessen the probability of a close _Entente_ with England. But\r\nClemenceau's adversaries had no concern whatever with the Radical\r\nleader's reasons for his action, which all democrats and Socialists,\r\nat any rate, must have cordially approved. All they wanted was another\r\nugly weapon wherewith to discredit and defeat the man who, though he\r\nhad not gone so far as the extreme Socialists desired, had done enough\r\nto hinder and rout reactionaries with their monarchist or Buonapartist\r\nrestorations. At the moment Clemenceau's anti-Czarist policy injured\r\nhim as a politician, but it certainly did him great credit as a man.\r\n\r\nBut, worse than all, he had steadily pursued his policy of a lifetime\r\nas a close and constant friend of England and of the English _Entente_.\r\nThat was still more criminal than Panamism or anti-Imperialism. For\r\nEngland at that time was, and to a large extent naturally, very\r\nunpopular in France. Clemenceau, therefore, was overwhelmed with\r\ncharges of being in the pay of Great Britain and working for Great\r\nBritain as well as for Panama. Broken English was used to hurl insults\r\nat him, which lost none of their fervour by being uttered in a foreign\r\ntongue. He had escaped from the obloquy of Panama, but it should go\r\nhard if one or other of these counts did not ruin him. The political\r\nwarfare became more bitter than ever. His persecutors were relentless:\r\n_la politique n'a pas d'entrailles_.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that I begged Clemenceau to make some terms with\r\nthe Socialists, who were gaining ground rapidly and appeared to be\r\nthe coming party in France. His recent tactics had been decidedly\r\nfavourable to Socialist views. And again I express my surprise that\r\nClemenceau, while holding fast to his opinions as to the necessity for\r\nmaintaining \"law and order\" in every sense, should never have seen his\r\nway to adopting the definite Socialist view as to the necessary and\r\nindeed inevitable policy of collective social progress. But his strong\r\npersonal individualism has prevented him from embracing our principles.\r\n\r\nThe statesman may quite honestly accept the theories of economists\r\nand sociologists, while compelled to adapt their application to the\r\ncircumstances of his time. No really capable Socialist who has taken\r\nan active part in public life has ever attempted to do anything else.\r\nIn France the Guesdists, who are certainly the most thoroughgoing\r\nMarxists in the country, have always proceeded on these lines in their\r\nmunicipal, and not unfrequently in their State, policy. Jaurès was a\r\nspecially fine example of the opportunist in public affairs; so much\r\nso that he was taunted by more extreme men with being a Ministerialist\r\nbefore he was a Minister. Vaillant the Blanquist, in theory at least an\r\nadvocate of a physical force revolution where possible, was in favour\r\nof an eight-hour law, compensation for injury to workmen, and so on.\r\nOne and all, that is to say, were ready to use the social and political\r\nforms of to-day in order to prepare the way for the complete revolution\r\ntomorrow. All Clemenceau's speeches and writings, before and after the\r\nPanama crash and its consequences to him, contain many passages which\r\nevery convinced Socialist would accept. I always felt, nevertheless,\r\nthat I was arguing with a man deaf of both ears when I put forward my\r\nwell-meant suggestions. Socialism, Clemenceau then declared--this,\r\nof course, was now nearly a generation ago--would never become an\r\neffective political power in France. France, and above all rural\r\nFrance, which is the real France, constituting the bulk of Frenchmen,\r\nis and will always remain steadfastly individualist--\"founded on\r\nproperty, property, property.\" That was their guiding principle in\r\nevery relation in life, and, he added, \"I have seen them close at\r\nevery stage of existence from birth to death. It is as useless to base\r\nany practical policy upon Socialist principles as it is chimerical to\r\nrepose any confidence in Socialist votes.\" \"But,\" I urged, \"extremes\r\nmeet: the Catholics and Socialists, both of whom are your opponents,\r\nmay combine with the men whose minds have been poisoned by the Panamist\r\nand Anglophobe imputations of the _Petit Journal_ and turn you out\r\nof your constituency in the Var for which you now sit as deputy.\" He\r\nlaughed at the very idea of such a defeat.\r\n\r\nBut the persistence and malignity of monarchists and men of God of the\r\nCatholic persuasion are hard to beat. Socialists with an anarchist\r\ntwist in their mental conceptions are not far behind them. So the\r\nfight for the constituency of Draguignan, which Clemenceau had chosen\r\nin preference to a Paris district at the previous election, developed\r\ninto a personal tussle unequalled in bitterness at that period. Every\r\nincident of the candidate's life was turned to his discredit. The\r\nPanama scandal and his relations with Semitic masters of corrupt\r\npractices were only a portion of an atheist record unparalleled for\r\ninfamy. All the Ministries he had destroyed, all the true lovers of\r\nFrance whom he had gibbeted, all the patriotic colonial policies he had\r\nfrustrated were brought up against him, embroidered with every flaming\r\ndesign the modern votaries of the Inquisition could invent! He had been\r\nguilty, in fact, of the unpardonable offence of making too many enemies\r\nat once. What might have been counted to him for righteousness by one\r\nfaction was blazoned forth as the blackest iniquity by another. His\r\nanti-Imperialism with his friendly attitude to the strikers incensed\r\nthe reactionaries. His refusal to make common cause with them in an\r\nout-and-out programme against bourgeois Republicanism infuriated the\r\nextremists. All his energy, all his oratory, all his genuine love for\r\nand services to France in days gone by went for nothing. The friends of\r\nJules Ferry, too, were eager for their revenge. Clemenceau had thought\r\nhis loss of the seat was impossible. Nevertheless the impossible\r\noccurred. He was thrown out of Draguignan at this General Election of\r\n1893, and after more than seventeen years of arduous and extremely\r\nuseful service was compelled to retire from Parliamentary life. It was\r\na complete break in his career.\r\n\r\nClemenceau at this period was fifty-two, and still in the prime\r\nof a vigorous life. He looked what he was, active, alert, capable\r\nand highly intelligent. His face was an index to his character. It\r\ngave an impression of almost barbarous energy, which induced his\r\nSocialist detractors, long afterwards, to speak and write of him as\r\n\"The Kalmuck.\" But this was merely caricature. Refinement, mental\r\nbrilliancy, deep reflection and high cultivation shone out from his\r\nanimated features. A teetotaller, abstemious in his habits, and\r\nalways in training, Clemenceau, with his rapidity of perception,\r\nquickness of retort and mastery of irony combined with trenchant wit,\r\nwas a formidable opponent indeed. Add to this that he was invariably\r\nwell-informed--_très bien documenté_--in the matters of which he\r\ntreated. It is quite inconceivable that he should refer to or deal\r\nwith any speech, or convention, or treaty which he had not thoroughly\r\nstudied. It was hopeless to catch Clemenceau tripping on any matter of\r\nfact or political engagement. Moreover, as remarked before, his rule in\r\npolitics was based upon the soundest principle in all warfare: Never\r\nfail to attack in order to defend.\r\n\r\nAs an orator he was and is destitute of those telling gestures,\r\nmodifications of tone and carefully turned phrases which we associate\r\nwith the highest class of French public speaking. His voice rarely\r\nrises above the conversational level and, as a rule, he is quiet and\r\nunemotional in his manner. But the directness of his assaults and the\r\ndynamitical force of his short periods gain rather than lose on that\r\naccount; while his power of logical, connected argument, marshalling\r\nwith ease such facts and quotations as he needs, has never been\r\nsurpassed. His famous Parliamentary encounter with my friend and\r\ncomrade Jean Jaurès was a remarkable example of his controversial\r\nability. My sympathies were, of course, entirely with the eloquent\r\nand able champion of Socialism, whose power of holding even a hostile\r\naudience was extraordinary, as was shown in that same National\r\nAssembly many a time. I was of opinion then, and I believe now, that\r\nJaurès had much the stronger case. He spoke then, as he always did,\r\nwith eloquence, fervour and sincerity. As an oratorical display it\r\nwas admirable. But I am bound to admit that, as a mere question of\r\nimmediate political dialectics, the Radical Premier got the better\r\nof the fray. It is possible, of course, that had Jaurès followed\r\nClemenceau instead of having preceded him, that might have made a\r\ndifference. But Jaurès's style, with its poetic elevation and long and\r\nimposing periods, was not so well suited as that of Clemenceau to a\r\npersonal debate on immediate practical issues before such an audience\r\nas the French National Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn private conversation Clemenceau is the most delightful yet\r\nunartificial talker I ever had the pleasure of listening to. Others\r\nwho possess great gifts in this direction are apt to work up their\r\neffects so that you can hear, as it were, the clank of the machinery\r\nas their pyrotechnic monologues appeal to your sense of cleverness\r\nwhile they balk your desire for spontaneity. There is none of this\r\nwith Clemenceau. He takes his fair share in any discussion and leaves\r\nnothing unsaid which, from his point of view, can elucidate or brighten\r\nup the friendly discussion. Never was any man less of a brilliant bore.\r\n\r\nAnother quality he possesses, which proved exceedingly useful to him\r\nat more than one stage of his adventurous career. Clemenceau was,\r\nand possibly is even to-day, at the age of seventy-seven, the most\r\ndangerous duellist in France. A left-handed swordsman and a perfect\r\npistol-shot, no one who valued the integrity of his carcase was\r\ndisposed to encounter with either rapier or pistol the leader of the\r\nextreme Left. Even the reactionary fire-eater, Paul de Cassagnac, who\r\nhimself had killed three men, shrank from meeting his quietus from\r\nClemenceau. His power of work also is extraordinary. In this he was\r\nonly equalled by Jaurès. Even an English barrister of exceptional\r\nphysique, striving to make his mark or endeavouring to keep the place\r\nalready won, could scarcely surpass the inexhaustible energy and\r\nendurance of either of these great Frenchmen. It is doubtful whether\r\nthe generation of younger men keep abreast with the pace set by their\r\nelders in this respect. Both Jaurès and Vaillant complained to me more\r\nthan once that, to use an English expression, the younger deputies did\r\nnot \"last over the course,\" and thus frequently lost in the Committees\r\nwhat they had gained in the set debates. Certainly, few of the French\r\npoliticians of to-day, at half Clemenceau's age, would care to attempt\r\nto do the work which he is doing now, day after day, with all the\r\nanxiety and responsibility that now rest upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nWhat perhaps is still more noteworthy, especially from the English\r\npoint of view, Clemenceau has never at any period of his career been a\r\nwell-to-do man. His complete independence of monetary considerations,\r\nat a time when place-hunting had been brought to a fine art in French\r\npolitics, gave him an influence all the greater by consequence of\r\nits rarity. Politicians whom he could have easily eclipsed in the\r\nrace for well-paid positions, or the acquisition of wealth, became\r\nPrime Ministers, and rich people, while Clemenceau remained what he\r\nhad always been, the leader of the most difficult party to control,\r\nwithout the means which have usually been considered indispensable for\r\nsuch a thankless post. Only once did he offer himself as the candidate\r\nfor a well-paid office--the Presidentship of the Chamber--to which\r\nhis experience and services fully entitled him. He was then beaten by\r\none vote. Honourable and dignified as is the chairmanship of such an\r\nAssembly, it was well for France, in the long run, that the recorder of\r\nthat single vote should have allowed what he believed to be a personal\r\ngrievance to influence his natural inclination to support Clemenceau.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                      PHILOSOPHER AND JOURNALIST\r\n\r\n\r\nRarely has a politician received a heavier blow than this which fell\r\nupon Clemenceau in 1893. Ordinarily, a man of his intellectual eminence\r\nand remarkable political faculties has no difficulty, if he loses one\r\nseat in the National Assembly of any country, in speedily getting\r\nanother. Not so with Clemenceau. His very success as leader of the\r\nadvanced Left and the proof that, though always a comparatively poor\r\nman, he had remained thoroughly honest amid all the intrigues and\r\nfinancial scandals around him told against him. He interfered with\r\ntoo many ambitions, was a stumbling-block in the way of too many high\r\npolicies, to be able to command his return for another constituency.\r\nThe same interests and jealousies which had combined against him at\r\nDraguignan would have attacked him with redoubled fury elsewhere.\r\nPersistent determination to carry really thorough democratic reforms in\r\nevery department, combined with very high ability, relentless disregard\r\nof personal claims, complete indifference to mere party considerations\r\nand perfect honesty are qualities so inconvenient to modern politicians\r\nof every shade of opinion that the wonder is Clemenceau had held his\r\nposition so long as he did. To have destroyed no fewer than eighteen\r\nmore or less reactionary administrations, while always refusing to form\r\na Cabinet himself, was a title to the highest esteem from the mass of\r\nhis countrymen: it was a diabolical record from the point of view of\r\nthe Ministers whom he had displaced and the cliques by whom they had\r\nbeen surrounded. Not a French statesman but felt that his reputation\r\nand his hold upon office were more secure now that Clemenceau's\r\nmasterly combinations and dynamitical oratory were safely excluded\r\nfrom the National Assembly. So Clemenceau, at this critical period\r\nof his life and career, could rely upon no organised political force\r\nstrong enough to encounter and overcome the persistent hostility of his\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nA weaker man would have felt this exclusion less and have been\r\ndiscouraged more. After seventeen years of such valuable work as\r\nClemenceau had done, to be, to all appearance, boycotted from the\r\nAssembly for an indefinite period was a strange experience. I wrote\r\nhim myself a letter of sympathy, and in his reply he expressed his\r\nspecial bitterness at the attitude of the Socialists towards him. This\r\nhostility might have been easily averted without any sacrifice of\r\nprinciple on Clemenceau's part. But Clemenceau, defeated and driven out\r\nof his rightful place in active French politics, did not hesitate for\r\na moment as to the course he would pursue. He had left the National\r\nAssembly as the first Parliamentarian in France: he at once turned\r\nround and at the age of fifty-two became her first journalist. Nothing\r\nin his long life of stress and strain is more remarkable than the\r\nsuccess he then achieved and the vigour with which he devoted himself\r\nto his new vocation.\r\n\r\nIt is no easy matter, especially in France, for a publicist and\r\njournalist to discover a fresh method of bringing his opinions to\r\nbear upon the public. Yet this is what Clemenceau did. He applied his\r\nhumanist-materialist philosophy to the everyday incidents of French\r\nlife. That philosophy is a strange compound of physical determinism\r\nand the ethical revolt against universal cruelty involved in the\r\nunregulated struggle for existence. The fight for life is inevitable.\r\nSo far, throughout historic times it has been a long campaign in\r\nwhich the usurping minority have always won. Wholesale butchery and\r\ncannibalism by conquering tribes have been transformed first into\r\nslavery, then into serfdom, lastly into the wage-earning system of our\r\nown time. In each and every case the many have been at the mercy of the\r\ndominating few. There is little or no effective attempt made to remedy\r\nthe evils arising out of such a state of things. The struggle for\r\nmere subsistence still goes on below, and those who revolt against it\r\nor endeavour seriously to ameliorate it by strikes or combinations are\r\ntreated as misdemeanants or criminals. Mining capitalists, industrial\r\ncapitalists, railway capitalists, landowners large and small have the\r\nlaw, the judges, the magistrates, the police and all the reactionary\r\nforces on their side. Hence the grossest injustice and the most\r\nabominable oppression of the poor.\r\n\r\nTherefore the State ought to intervene, not in order to repress the\r\naspirations and punish the attempts of the wage-earning class to obtain\r\nbetter conditions of life for themselves and their children, but to\r\nprotect this most important portion of the community in every possible\r\nway: to secure for them shorter hours of labour, thorough education,\r\nfull opportunity for legitimate combination, boards of arbitration to\r\navert strikes, fair play at the hands of the courts and the police.\r\nThe State, in fact, is to act as a national conscience and perpetual\r\ntrustee for the poor. Note that the struggle for existence, the fight\r\nfor subsistence must go on--Clemenceau has never contemplated the\r\npossibility of a human scheme of co-operation by which competition\r\nwould be wholly eliminated--but its harsher features ought to be\r\nreduced. There is no complete overthrow of mutual destruction, and\r\nno condition of universal fellowship is in view. Only the mind and\r\nheart of the community must be changed; men must survey modern society\r\nfrom the point of view of humane guidance and prepare the material\r\ndevelopment and economic arrangements which shall by degrees render\r\nindividual injustice and cruelty as unheard-of as now is anthropophagy.\r\n\r\nAt the back of all this lies a picturesque pessimism and what nowadays\r\nis frequently spoken of as a philosophy of despair. No sooner has this\r\nplanet, its solar system, its galaxy of suns and worlds reached its\r\nfull development than they all begin to traverse the downward path\r\nwhich leads slowly and inevitably to decay and eventual destruction,\r\nuntil the entire process unconsciously and inevitably begins over\r\nagain. Infinity oppresses us all: the cosmos with its interminable\r\nrepetitions eludes conception by the human intelligence. Yet we live\r\nand strive and feel and hope and have our conceptions of justice and\r\nsympathy and duty which come we know not whence and pass onwards we\r\nknow not whither. Man as a highly organised individual entity becomes\r\nsuperior to the mere matter of which his mind is a function, because as\r\nan individual he can rise up out of himself and criticise and reflect\r\nupon that which, without any such power of conception, surrounds,\r\nupholds and then immolates him. \"The universe crushes me,\" wrote\r\nPascal, \"yet I am superior to the universe, because I know that it is\r\ncrushing me and the universe knows nothing about it at all.\" Strange\r\nto find Clemenceau quoting and agreeing with an intelligence so wholly\r\ndifferent from his own as Pascal's!\r\n\r\nThen, fate, necessity, the Nemesis of Monism working on to its foreseen\r\nbut uncontrollable destiny, dominates the cosmos and through the cosmos\r\nthat infinitesimally small but sentient and critical microbe man, who\r\ncreates an individual ethic out of this determinist material evolution.\r\nFrancis Newman, the brother of the famous John Henry the Cardinal,\r\nsaid that it is as impossible for man to comprehend matter developing\r\nand reproducing itself from all time as it is for him to conceive of\r\nan omnipotent deity superintending the matter he has created in its\r\nevolution from all time. We are therefore driven back, whether we like\r\nit or not, upon the ancient and never-ending discussion of free-will\r\nand predestination in a non-theological form which leaves in the main\r\nall the psychologic phenomena untouched, including Clemenceau's own\r\nsocial morality that impels him to champion the cause of the oppressed.\r\nBeyond the demand for justice in the abstract and freedom in the\r\nabstract applied as a test to each special case as it arises, there\r\nis no guiding theory in Clemenceau's philosophy. The recognition of\r\nthe struggle for existence among human beings, as among plants and\r\nanimals, does not imply any conscious co-ordination of effort, arising\r\nout of the growth of society, in order to do away with the antagonism\r\nengendered by life itself. So with all his humanism Clemenceau will\r\nnot accept the theories of scientific Socialism which could give an\r\nunshakable foundation to his own views of life. That is the weakness\r\nwhich runs through all his books and articles. His own individuality is\r\nso powerful that he simply cannot grasp the possibility of anything but\r\nindividual effort, personal suasion and isolated measures of reform.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we come upon a passage which, written obviously in\r\nperfect good faith, would, within its limits, be accepted as a\r\nfair statement of Socialism from an outsider: \"Socialism is social\r\nbeneficence in action, it is the intervention of all on behalf of\r\nthe victim of the murderous vitality of the few. To contend, as the\r\neconomists do, that we ought to oppose social altruism in its efforts\r\nis to misrepresent and seriously calumniate mankind. To complain that\r\ncollective action will degrade the individual by some limitation of\r\nliberty is to argue in favour of the liberty of the stronger which\r\nis called oppressive. Is it not, on the contrary, to strengthen the\r\nindividual by restraining and controlling every man who injures another\r\nman as does the employer of to-day when left to the bare exigences\r\nof competition? . . . . Follow the _laissez-faire_ policy for the\r\nindividual, says the anti-social economist, and speedily a whole\r\nregiment of devotees will rush to the succour of the vanquished. We\r\nalways wait, but see nothing save the terrible condition of humanity\r\nwhich ever remains. . . . . Against this anarchy it is man's glory to\r\nrevolt. He claims the right to soften, to control fatality if he cannot\r\nescape from it. How?\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Clemenceau, whom in active life none would accuse of undue\r\nsentiment, goes off into a series of moral reflections and the need\r\nfor perpetual moral preachments which really lead us nowhither;\r\nthough, some pages further on, he quotes Karl Marx, who speaks of\r\nthe unemployed as the inevitable \"army of reserve\" due not to human\r\nimmorality but to the necessary functioning of the unregulated\r\ncompetitive capitalism of our period. Yet the great French Radical\r\nshrinks from the organised social collective action and revolution\r\nneeded to lift us out of this anarchy of oppression. He turns to the\r\nindividual himself and his hard lot under the domination of fate. He\r\nhas a justifiable tilt at free-will and personal responsibility. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\"But what is absurd, contradictory, idiotic is the responsibility\r\nof the creature before the creator. I say to God, 'If you are not\r\nsatisfied with me, you had only to make me otherwise,' and I defy him\r\nto answer me.\" And then, quoting from \"Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead,\"\r\nhe cites Minos as discussing with a new-comer who is brought before him\r\nfor punishment:\r\n\r\n\"All that I did in life,\" says Sostrates, \"was it done by me\r\nvoluntarily, or was not my destiny registered beforehand by Fate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Evidently by Fate,\" answers Minos.\r\n\r\n\"Punish Fate, then,\" is the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Let him go free,\" says Minos to Mercury, \"and see to it that he\r\nteaches the other dead to question us in like manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Substitute Fate for Jehovah or by the laws of the Universe, and tell\r\nme,\" puts in Clemenceau, \"when the pot owes his bill to the potter.\"\r\nAll this and the farewell benediction which the author vouchsafes to\r\nthe human plaything of all these pre-ordered decisions of society do\r\nnot get us much further, even though after so many mischances he may\r\nlive on only to appreciate more thoroughly \"the sublime indifference of\r\nthings eternal.\" That is not very consolatory by way of a materialist\r\nviaticum. But it is the best Clemenceau can give.\r\n\r\nNone the less it is easy to comprehend why this sort of philosophy,\r\nillustrated and punctuated by the keenest criticism and sarcasm on\r\nthe wrongs and injustice of our existing society, produced a great\r\neffect. The commonest incidents of everyday life were made the text\r\nfor vitriolic sermonising on the shortcomings of statesmen and judges,\r\npriests and police, industrial capitalists and mine-owners. Here and\r\nthere, also, a description of working-class life is given, so accurate,\r\nso vivid, so telling that administrators of the easiest conscience were\r\nled to feel uncomfortable at the kind of social system with which they\r\nhad been hitherto satisfied. With no phase of French life is Clemenceau\r\nbetter acquainted than with the habits and customs of the French\r\npeasantry. Thus we have a description of the peasant tacked on to a\r\nnice little story of a poor fellow who, strolling along the highway on\r\na hot day and feeling thirsty, plucks a few cherries from the branch\r\nof a cherry-tree which overhangs the road. The small proprietor is\r\non the look-out for such petty depredations and at once kills the\r\natrocious malefactor who had thus plundered him. The cherry-eater \"had\r\ndespoiled him of two-ha'porth of fruit!\" It justified prompt execution\r\nof the thief by the owner. That such small robbery did not at once\r\ngive the latter the power of life and death over the thief is a point\r\nof view that the peasant can never take. Why? Because of the penal\r\nservitude for life to which he is condemned by the very conditions of\r\nhis existence, and the greed for property driven into him from birth to\r\ndeath. It is the outcome of private ownership: the result of the fatal\r\nsaying, \"This is mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"The peasant is the man of one idea, of a sole and solitary love.\r\nBowed, he knows only the earth. His activity has but one end and\r\nobject: the soil. To acquire it, to own it, that is his life, harsh\r\nand rapacious. He speaks of _my_ land, _my_ field, _my_ stones, _my_\r\nthistles. To till, to manure, to sow the land, to mow, to uproot, to\r\nprime, to cut what comes from the land, that is the eternal object of\r\nhis entire physical or intellectual effort. Amusement for him: not a\r\nbit of it. He has no other resource than to console himself for the\r\ndisappointment of to-day with the hope of to-morrow. He is at war with\r\nthe seasons, the elements, the sun, rain, hail, wind, frost. He fights\r\nagainst the neighbouring intruder, the invading cattle, the birds, the\r\ncaterpillars, the parasites, the thousand-and-one unknown phenomena\r\nwhich, without any apparent reason, bring down upon him all sorts of\r\nunlooked-for ills.\r\n\r\n\"Then has he risen at dawn for nothing, badly fed, badly clothed,\r\nsweating in the sun, shivering in the wind and the rain, exhausting his\r\nenergies against things which resist his utmost efforts? Do sowing,\r\nmanuring, labour and the pouring out of life all, too, go for nothing,\r\nwithout rest, without leisure, without any thought but this: I toiled\r\nand suffered yesterday, I shall toil and suffer to-morrow? And all this\r\nis balanced by no pleasures but drunkenness and lust. No theatres, no\r\nbooks, no shows, no enjoyments of any kind. Hard to others, hard to\r\nhimself, everything is hard around him.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the peasant of Western France. Though the peasant of the\r\nSouth is of a livelier and happier disposition on the surface, both\r\nare at bottom the same. And France is still in the main rural France\r\nas Clemenceau himself impressed upon me many years ago. That is the\r\ninfluence which holds in check the advanced proletariat of the towns\r\nand mining districts. They can see nothing outside private property,\r\nproperty, property: yet it is this very unregulated individual\r\nownership which forces them to fight out their existence against the\r\nhardships of nature with inefficient tools, insufficient manure and no\r\nadequate arrangements for marketing the produce they have for sale.\r\nHigh prices and a few advantages gained have somewhat ameliorated the\r\nlot of the peasant, but it is still a hard, depressing existence which\r\ncannot be made really human and happy for the great majority under the\r\nconditions of to-day. The only boon the peasant has is that he is not\r\nunder the direct sway of the capitalist exploiter. What that means in\r\nthe mines Clemenceau had an opportunity of seeing very close, as a\r\nmember of the Commission appointed to examine into the coal-mines of\r\nAnzin in 1884. He tells of his experience ten years later in one of the\r\npits he descended. \"Never go down a coal-mine,\" wrote Lord Chesterfield\r\nto his son. \"You can always say you have been below, and nobody can\r\ncontradict you.\" Clemenceau did not follow this cynical advice. He\r\nwent down, \"and after having waded through water, bent double, for\r\nhundreds upon hundreds of yards through dripping scales which hang\r\nfrom the upper stratum, I crawled on hands and knees to a nice little\r\nvein _twenty inches thick_. On this seam human beings were at work,\r\nlying on their side, bringing down coal which fell on their faces and\r\nreplacing it continuously by timber in order not to be crushed by the\r\nupper surface. You must not neglect this part of the work!\" He was\r\nnot allowed to talk with the men themselves, and when they came to\r\ninterview him secretly they implored him not to let the manager or the\r\nemployers know, or they would be discharged at once! The old story of\r\nminers in every country which even the strongest Trade Unions are as\r\nyet scarcely able to cope with, though the tyranny in French mines has\r\nbeen checked since the time Clemenceau wrote. These and similar cases\r\nof oppression on the part of the capitalist class caused Clemenceau to\r\nsupport Socialists more and more in their demands for limitation of\r\nthe then unrestricted powers of individual employers and \"anonymous\"\r\ncompanies. So, too, individualist as he was, he wrote article after\r\narticle in defence of the right of the men to strike against grievous\r\noppression, holding that the combination of the workers was more than\r\nsufficiently handicapped by the fact that they were bound to imperil\r\ntheir own subsistence as well as the maintenance of their wives and\r\nchildren by going on strike at all. This argument he applied to all\r\nstrikes in organised industries.\r\n\r\nBut Clemenceau naturally found himself drawn into bitter antagonism\r\nto the doctrine of _laissez-faire_ and the law of supply and demand.\r\n\"You say all must bow down to them. I contend all must revolt against\r\nthem.\" \"The individual struggle for existence is only a great\r\n_laissez-faire_! Far from being liberty, it is the triumph of violence,\r\nit is barbarism itself. The man who mastered the first slave founded\r\na new system . . . so completely that after some ages of this rule a\r\nphysiocrat overlooking it all would have sagely pronounced: Slavery is\r\nthe law of human societies. This with the same amount of truth as he\r\nsays to-day: The law of supply and demand is an immutable ordinance.\r\nAnd, for all that, the supreme irony of fate has decreed that the\r\nfirst slave-driver was at the same time the first sower of the seed of\r\nliberty, of justice. For by enslaving men he created a social relation,\r\na relation different from that enjoined by the primitive form of the\r\nstruggle for existence: kill, eat, destroy. Henceforth man was bound to\r\nman. The social body was formed.\" Man had to discover the law governing\r\nthe new relation, and he found it at last in the first flashes of\r\njustice and liberty. \"What, then, is this your _laissez-faire_, your\r\nlaw of supply and demand, but the pure and simple expression of force?\r\nRight overcomes force: that is the principle of civilisation. Your law\r\nonce formulated, let us set to work against barbarism!\"\r\n\r\nAll that is telling criticism; though to-day it reads a bit antiquated\r\nin view of the revolt everywhere against both these catch-phrases and\r\nthe anarchist chaos which they connote. But here again Clemenceau,\r\nwith all his acuteness and brilliancy, displays the need for a guiding\r\nhistoric and economic theory--the sociologic theory which scientific\r\nSocialism supplies. It was not justice or liberty which created\r\nslavery, or destroyed slavery, but economic development and social\r\nnecessity. The cult of abstraction leads to social revolt but not to\r\nmaterial revolution.\r\n\r\nHolding the opinions he did, it was inevitable that Clemenceau should\r\nput the case of the Anarchists such as Vaillant, Henry, Ravachot.\r\nThey were the victims of a system. They could not rise as a portion\r\nof a collective attack against the unjust class dominion and economic\r\nservitude which crushed them and their fellows down into interminable\r\ntoil with no reward for their lifelong sufferings. So they made war\r\nas individuals for anarchy. _Vive l'Anarchie!_ were the last words of\r\nHenry. The man was a fanatic. \"The crime seems to me odious. I make no\r\nexcuse for it,\" says Clemenceau, but he objects to the capital penalty.\r\n\"Henry's crime was that of a savage. The deed of society seems to\r\nme a loathsome vengeance.\" Clemenceau compares, too, the anarchists\r\nof dynamite to the would-be assassin Damien, so hideously tortured\r\nbefore death. \"My motive,\" said he, \"was the misery which exists in\r\nthree-quarters of the kingdom. I acted alone, because I thought alone.\"\r\nThe anarchist, asked by his mother why he had, become an anarchist,\r\nanswered, \"Because I saw the suffering of the great majority of human\r\nbeings.\" Vaillant, Henry, Caserio and their like are overmastered by\r\nthe same idea as Damien. They kill members of the king caste of our\r\nsociety of to-day in order to scare the bourgeoisie into justice. There\r\nis no arguing with honest fanatics of this type. Whether society is\r\njustified in guillotining or hanging them is another matter. That their\r\nmethod is futile, as all history shows, gives society the right if it\r\nso chooses to regard it also as criminal.\r\n\r\nThe above is all argument and criticism put with almost savage vigour.\r\nBut Clemenceau used likewise the lighter touch of French irony. Thus\r\na wretched family of father, mother and six children, tramping along\r\nthe high road near Paris, found some coal which had dropped from a\r\nwagon long since out of sight. They pick up these bits of chance fuel\r\nas a godsend. They have gleaned after the reapers. Straightway, the\r\nstory of Boaz and Ruth occurs to Clemenceau, of Boaz and his descendant\r\nof Nazareth, who is the God of Europe to-day. The Hebrew Boaz, the\r\nlandowner of old, gladly leaves the wheat-ears to be gleaned by Ruth\r\nand marries her into the bargain. The Christian Boaz, the coal-owner of\r\nour time, gets the males of the distressed family of coal-gleaners six\r\ndays' imprisonment. Such is progress through the centuries! The moral\r\nof the whole story is brilliantly touched in.\r\n\r\nSo again in his comment on the catastrophe at the Charity Bazaar. It\r\nwas the rank and religiosity of the persons burnt alive which rendered\r\nthe tragedy so much more terrible than if the crowd thus incinerated\r\nhad only consisted of common people! It was the cream of French piety\r\nthat was there sacrificed. Quite an ecclesiastical and political\r\npropaganda was developed from their ashes. The spirit of class made\r\nthese accidental victims of gross carelessness martyrs of Christian\r\nheroism. Yet \"if I go to dance at a charity ball, paying twenty francs\r\nfor my ticket, and expire on the spot, I am not on that account a\r\nhero. . . . These gatherings are not exactly places of torture.\r\nPeople laugh, flirt, and amuse themselves, it is an opportunity\r\nto display fine dresses, and the charity sale has supplemented the\r\nOpéra Comique for marriage-provoking interviews superintended by good\r\ngrandmothers. . . . Here is class distinction in action. Observe these\r\naristocratic young gentlemen beating with their canes and kicking their\r\nfrightened womenkind in their cowardly attempt to get out of danger.\r\nThen see the servants rushing in to save them! Look also at the workmen\r\nby chance on the spot risking their lives with true heroism, the\r\nplumber Piquet, who saved twenty people and, though much burnt himself,\r\nwent back to his work-shop without a word.\" The contrast is striking.\r\nIt is not drawn by a Socialist.\r\n\r\nThen the criticism on the German fête in commemoration of the victory\r\nof Sedan. \"William II is obliged to keep his people in training, to\r\nmilitarise them unceasingly, body and soul. . . . In spite of the\r\nhandsome protests of most of the Socialist leaders, we may be sure that\r\nit is in very truth the soul of Germany whose innermost exultation\r\nis manifested in these numberless jubilations which have beflagged\r\nevery village in the Empire. . . . It is the curse of the triumphs of\r\nbrute force to leave room in the soul of the conqueror for nothing but\r\na blind faith in settlement by violence.\" Then follows a prophetic\r\nsummary of what must be the inevitable consequence of this consecration\r\nof brutal dominion inspired by the hateful instincts of barbarism,\r\nwhich together prepare to use in Central Europe the most efficient\r\nmeans of murder at the disposal of scientific civilisation. The ethics\r\nof the nation are being deliberately corrupted for the realisation of\r\nthe Imperial policy!\r\n\r\nThus Clemenceau, like others of us who knew the old Germany well, and\r\nhad watched its sad hypnotisation by the spirit of ruthless militarism,\r\nforesaw what was coming more than twenty-five years ago. And thus\r\nanticipating and reflecting, he chanced to see on one of the monuments\r\nof Paris illumined by the sun, \"The German Empire falls.\" It was dated\r\n1805! \"Short years pass. What remains of these follies? If law and\r\nright outraged, reason flouted, wisdom contemned must blight our hopes,\r\nas your warlike demonstrations too clearly prognosticate, then for you,\r\nmen of Germany, the inscription of the Carrousel is patient and bides\r\nits time.\r\n\r\n\"And yet two great rival peoples worthy to understand one another could\r\nnobly make ready a nobler destiny.\"\r\n\r\nThere you have the statesman and idealist as well as the clear-sighted\r\njournalist. Clemenceau saw the storm-cloud ever menacing and ready\r\nto break upon France. He warned his countrymen of their danger, bade\r\nthem prepare to meet it, but hoped continuously that his forecasts\r\nmight prove wholly erroneous. Jaurès unfortunately, with all his vast\r\nability, was too idealist and far too credulous. Hence his great\r\ninfluence was thrown against the due preparation of his own country; he\r\ndid his utmost to support the anti-navy men even in Great Britain, and\r\nonly began to recognise how completely mistaken he had been just before\r\nhe was assassinated by the modern Ravaillac of religionist reaction. To\r\nanticipate fraternity in a world of conflict is to help the aggressor\r\nand to court disaster. This Clemenceau the Radical knew: to this the\r\nFrench Socialists shut their minds.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that the Vendéen by birth, the Parisian by adoption,\r\nshould feel himself drawn rather to the ideals of the French capital,\r\nwhich in matters of intelligence and art is also the capital of Europe,\r\nrather than to the narrow spirit of the Breton countryside which he has\r\nso vigorously sketched. In his writings as in his political activities\r\nthis preference, this admiration find forcible expression. From the\r\ndays of Julian the great Pagan Emperor down to the French Revolution\r\nand thence onwards, Clemenceau briefly traces the development of the\r\nCity by the Seine, the French Renaissance and the University of Paris,\r\nby the influence of the writings of Montaigne--\"this city in right of\r\nwhich I am a Frenchman\"--and Rabelais: this meeting-place of Europe,\r\nthis Central Commune of the planet proposed by Clootz, the Prussian\r\nidealist, becomes in the words of the same foreign enthusiast \"a\r\nmagnificent Assembly of the peoples of the West.\" We may forgive the\r\nFrench statesman his unbounded enthusiasm for the Paris where he has\r\nspent the whole of his active life. \"One phrase alone, 'The Rights of\r\nMan,' has uplifted all heads. Lafayette brings back from America the\r\nvictory that France sent thither and straightway the great battle is\r\njoined between Paris of the French Revolution and the coalition of\r\nthings of the past.\" \"True, we have measured\r\n\r\n    _A la hauteur des bonds la profondeur des chutes_,\r\n\r\n\"but at least we have striven, and we abate not a jot of our generous\r\nambitions. Thus decrees the tradition of Paris . . . that Paris which now\r\nas ever holds in her hands the key to supreme victory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                        CLEMENCEAU AS A WRITER\r\n\r\n\r\nM. Clemenceau had a ready pen as well as a very bitter one, and he did\r\nnot confine himself to articles on politics and sociology. Besides _La\r\nMêlée Sociale_, of which I have given some account in the previous\r\nchapter, he published the following books in order within eight years:\r\n_Le Grand Pan_, a volume of descriptive essays; _Les Plus Forts_, a\r\nnovel; _Au Fil des Jours_, and _Les Embuscades de la Vie_, which were,\r\nin the main, collections of sketches and tales. At the same time he\r\ndid a great deal of ordinary journalism, including his articles on the\r\nDreyfus case, which make in themselves four good-sized volumes.\r\n\r\n_Le Grand Pan_ followed close upon _La Mêlée Sociale_, and came as\r\na delightful surprise to M. Clemenceau's readers, a piece of pure\r\nliterature. In this book he no longer writes as a citizen of Paris, a\r\nman of the boulevards and pavements, but as one country-born and bred,\r\nknowing the hills and the sea. Although he describes his own Vendéen\r\nscenery with loving familiarity, making the \"_Marais_,\" the \"_Bocage_\"\r\nand the \"_Plaine_\" live before us, he does not cling to them with the\r\nmonotonous affection of some French writers, who are, as it were, dyed\r\nin their own local colour. Without elaboration, without the detailed\r\nbuilding-up of a scene which is the careful habit of some others, he\r\nconveys in two or three lines the _feeling_ of a countryside and that\r\nelusive but immutable thing, the character of a landscape. This belongs\r\nreally to the poet's art, and gives, I cannot tell why, a deeper\r\nimpression, a far more lasting pleasure than all the abundance and\r\ndetail of prose. Clemenceau's neighbour, and almost fellow-countryman,\r\nRenan, had this gift. All the grey waters of the rocky Armorican shore\r\nseem to sweep through the first lines of his essay on the Celtic\r\nSpirit; and the influence of Renan is marked in _Le Grand Pan_. The\r\nfirst article, which gives the book its title, sets the reader's fancy\r\nsailing among the Greek Isles, steered by poetry and tradition, in\r\nthe light of the golden and the silver age. Clemenceau, like Heine,\r\nmourns for the overthrow of the Greek gods in the welter of quarrelling\r\npriesthoods and fierce Asian ugliness that flooded the Mediterranean\r\nworld. \"Pan, Pan is dead!\" But in the Renaissance--\"the tumultuous\r\npageant of Art hurrying to meet the classic gods reborn\"--he welcomes\r\nthe magnificent restoration of the ancient and eternal Powers. And\r\nhe claims for the nineteenth century the honour of beholding another\r\nre-birth of the gods of Nature in the development of science, and the\r\nlabour that has brought some of the secrets of earth within our ken.\r\n\r\nBut science, as we know, has revealed the horrors as well as the\r\nwonders of earth. It troubles us; man has shed rivers of needless\r\nblood, but we shrink from recognising Nature as she is, \"red in\r\ntooth and claw.\" It did not trouble the ancient Greeks; their\r\ngods, developing from the rough deities of place or tribe into the\r\nembodiments of the natural forces of matter or of mind, were outside\r\nhuman ethic, although they were cast in human form. They might take the\r\nshape of mortals, but only Euripides and a few other hypersensitive\r\nmoralists thought of blaming the gods when, as often happened, they\r\nfell below the standards of human conduct. But we are creatures of\r\nanother era; and man, criticising and even condemning the Powers that\r\nrule his little day, has, for good or ill, reached out to a level that\r\nis above the gods, whose plaything he still remains.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another change. Man--_some_ men, that is to say--have\r\ntaken the animals into their protection and fellowship: and M.\r\nClemenceau is truly one of these. Not only those charming, kindly\r\nessays, _La Main et la Patte_ and _Les Parents Pauvres_, in _Le Grand\r\nPan_, but the history of the two pigeons in the _Embuscades de la Vie_,\r\nand a hundred little touches and incidents throughout Clemenceau's\r\nbooks show him to be a man of most generous sympathies, looking at\r\nanimal life from a far higher and finer point of view than the majority\r\nof his countrymen.\r\n\r\nThere is much else in _Le Grand Pan_ that it would be pleasant to dwell\r\nupon: a delicate classic spirit, a certain ironic grace, humour and\r\nmockery, but everywhere and above all keen indignation at needless\r\nhuman suffering and a sympathy which is poles apart from sentiment, for\r\nhuman pain. M. Clemenceau might well be called \"a soldier of pity,\"\r\nas, in one of the Near Eastern languages, the members of his first\r\nprofession, the doctors, are termed. But I must pass on. _Le Grand Pan_\r\nis, as it deserves to be, the best known of M. Clemenceau's books,\r\nand no one who has overlooked it can form a complete idea of this\r\nremarkable man.\r\n\r\nIt is said that anyone who has the power of setting down his\r\nimpressions on paper can write at least one good novel, if he\r\ntries, for he will draw with varying degrees of truth or malice\r\nthe individuals he has met, liked, or suffered from, and the main\r\ncircumstances of his life. What a Homeric novel M. Clemenceau might\r\nhave written if he had followed these lines! But _Les Plus Forts_ is\r\nunfortunately no such overflow of personal impressions and memories;\r\nit is merely what used to be called \"a novel with a purpose.\" That is\r\nto say, it is one of the many works of fiction which not only record\r\nthe adventures of certain imaginary yet typical characters, but also\r\ncontain severe criticism of contemporary social conditions and life.\r\nSuch novels were much more common in England during the nineteenth\r\ncentury than in France. In English fiction the sequence is unbroken\r\nfrom _Sandford and Merton_ to the earlier works of Mrs. Humphry Ward's\r\nvenerable pen. But in 1898 there were still not many French novels\r\nconcerned with the serious discussion of social conditions, and M.\r\nClemenceau's early work stands out among these for sincerity and\r\nsimplicity of intent. However, in spite of the excellent irony of some\r\npassages--notably the description of the Vicomtesse de Fourchamps'\r\ncareer--_Les Plus Forts_ is to modern readers a trifle tedious and a\r\nlittle naive. It is of the same calibre as Mr. Shaw's two first novels,\r\nbut less eccentric and not so amusing. M. Clemenceau himself would\r\nprobably write upon it \"_Péché de jeunesse_,\" and pass on. Yet it\r\ndeserves more attention than that; for _Les Plus Forts_ unconsciously\r\nreveals the central weakness of its author's criticism of modern life.\r\nThe situation is a good one, although the actors are not so much\r\ncharacters as types.\r\n\r\nHenri de Puymaufray, a ruined French gentleman, who has lost the\r\nworld and found a kind of Radicalism, and Dominique Harlé, a rich\r\npaper manufacturer, live side by side in the country as friendly\r\nenemies or, rather, close but inimical friends. Their views of life\r\nare as the poles asunder, but for the purposes of the story they\r\nmust be constantly meeting in conversational intimacy; and they have\r\neach an almost superhuman power of expressing themselves and their\r\nattitude towards the world they live in. The chief link between them\r\nis Harlé's supposed daughter and only child, Claude, whose real father\r\nis Puymaufray. Both these elderly gentlemen are deeply concerned\r\nabout Claude's future; each wishing, as parents and guardians often\r\ndo, to make the child's career the completion of their own ambitions\r\nand hopes. Here Harlé has the advantage; he knows what he wants, that\r\nis, money and power, and he means his daughter to have plenty of\r\nboth. He is the ordinary capitalist, with a strain of politician and\r\nCabinet-maker, who ends by founding a popular journal that outdoes\r\nHarmsworth in expressing the \"Lowest Common Factor of the Mind.\"\r\nSociety, the Church, and a particularly offensive form of charity all\r\nserve him to increase his own power and the stability of his class. All\r\nis for the best in the best of bourgeois worlds. Such is the theory\r\nof life which he puts before his supposed daughter, together with a\r\n_prétendant_ who will carry out his aims. Unhappily, Puymaufray has\r\nnothing positive to set against this very solid and prosperous creed.\r\nHe and Deschars, the young traveller whom he wishes to give Claude\r\nfor a husband, can only talk pages of Radicalism in which the words\r\n\"pity\" and \"love\" would recur even more frequently if M. Clemenceau's\r\nfine sense of fitness did not prevail. What do they really want Claude\r\nto do? The best they can offer her appears to be a life of retired and\r\ngentle philanthropy, inspired by a dim sense of human brotherhood,\r\nwhich might, under very favourable circumstances, deepen into a sort of\r\nSocialist mood.\r\n\r\nBut \"mere emotional Socialism cuts no ice.\" This has often been said,\r\nand means that a vague fraternal purpose and a perception of the deep\r\ninjustice of our present social system, even when sharpened with the\r\nmost destructive satire, will never change this world for the better,\r\nunless they lead up to some theory of construction that is based on\r\neconomic facts. Pity and brotherhood may move individuals to acts of\r\nbenevolence, but they cannot alone recast the fabric of society, or\r\neven bring about fundamental collective reforms. Besides, when young\r\npeople are asked to give up certain definite things, such as money,\r\npleasure and power, they must see something more than mere renouncement\r\nahead. They must be shown the fiery vision of an immortal city whose\r\nfoundations they may hope to build. Clemenceau's own knowledge of human\r\nnature works against his two heroes, and he says:\r\n\r\n\"Deschars was the child of his time. He had gone about the world as\r\na disinterested beholder, and he returned from voyaging without any\r\nkeen desire for noble action. . . . Perhaps, if he had been living and\r\nworking for some great human object, Deschars would have carried Claude\r\naway by the very authority of his purpose, without a word. . . .\"\r\n\r\nAnd Madame de Fourchamps observes:\r\n\r\n\"It is very lucky for the poor that there are rich people to give them\r\nbread.\"\r\n\r\nTo which Claude replies:\r\n\r\n\"My father's factory provides these workmen with a livelihood; where\r\nwould they be without him?\"\r\n\r\nThen, instead of a few plain words on labour-value, Puymaufray can only\r\nreply:\r\n\r\n\"Well, they give him something in exchange, don't they?\"\r\n\r\nThe old capitalist fallacies here uttered in their crudest form\r\ncannot be refuted by mere injunctions to pity and goodwill; and even\r\nthe magnificent words Liberty, Equality, Fraternity are no adequate\r\nreply. To the successful profiteer and all who acquiesce in his\r\ndomination they mean: Liberty of Enterprise, Equality of Opportunity,\r\nand Fraternity among Exploiters. Facts and the march of events alone\r\ncan persuade Dominique Harlé and his like to use their ingenuity in\r\nserving their fellow-creatures, and not in profiting by them. And only\r\ncollective action, guided by some knowledge of the direction in which\r\nour civilisation is tending, can hasten the march of events.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how greatly the \"novel with a purpose\" has developed\r\nduring the last twenty years in England and, to a less extent, in\r\nFrance. The characters are creatures of their conditions; and it\r\nis these conditions, not the characters, that do the talking. Some\r\nnovels to-day are such careful and withal highly interesting guides\r\nto the sociology of England towards the end of the black Industrial\r\nAge that we cannot wonder if their authors take themselves too\r\nseriously as politicians and reformers. Yet these works show, after\r\nall, the same defect as _Les Plus Forts_, they have no constructive\r\ntheory of life to set against the very well-defined, solid, and still\r\napparently effective system which they criticise. All their most ironic\r\ndescriptions, their most penetrating satire are negative, and, in the\r\nend, the utterances of men \"wandering between two worlds, one dead, one\r\npowerless to be born.\"\r\n\r\n_Au Fil des Jours_ is an interesting collection of pieces in which the\r\nauthor has not made up his mind whether he will write short stories or\r\narticles upon social conditions. There is no harm in that; some people\r\nmay even say that M. Clemenceau has produced a new variety of readable\r\nmatter; but, curiously enough, the substance of the story is often\r\nso telling that one quarrels with the writer for not having put it\r\ninto the best shape. Take one of the pieces in _Au Fil des Jours_--_La\r\nRoulotte_. Briefly, a weary old gipsy drives in a covered donkey-cart\r\ninto a country hamlet, and stops by the riverside, where all the\r\ngossips are washing. He is received with hostile and watchful silence,\r\nbecause gipsies are always the scapegoats in a peasant district, and\r\nanything and everything that may be lost, stolen or strayed--even if\r\nit turns up again--is always laid to their account. In the night he\r\ndies, unnoticed; and, after some further time has passed, the villagers\r\ninspect his cart. Finding him there, dead, with a very small grandson\r\nliving, they fetch the local constable and the mayor. The arm of\r\nthe Law begins to function, the child is sent to the workhouse, the\r\nmoribund donkey is \"taken care of\" by one of the villagers, and the\r\ndilapidated old cart, which only contained a few rags, is left by the\r\nriverside.\r\n\r\nBut the French peasant knows how to turn every little thing to profit:\r\nnothing is useless in his eyes. Gradually handy fragments of the\r\ndonkey-cart begin to disappear. Bits of the iron fittings vanish, the\r\ntilt-props go, a shaft follows, one wheel after another slips away and\r\nis no more seen. In fact, the donkey-cart, as such, disappears from\r\nmortal sight. Then, one fine day, a gipsy-woman comes swinging along\r\nthe road, where she had followed the traces of the donkey-cart, and\r\nasks for news of her old father and her little boy. The authorities of\r\nthe village tell her of the old gipsy's death and burial: they do not\r\nrequire her to pay for his obsequies only because they see it would\r\nbe no use. She goes to fetch the child from the workhouse, and then\r\nasks for the donkey and cart. The former, they tell her, died in the\r\nhands of the villager who \"took care of him\" (and sold his skin for a\r\nfair sum). She accepts this loss with resignation; but the cart, as\r\nshe says, cannot have died: where is her father's \"_roulotte_\"?--Ah,\r\nwell, nobody in the village knows anything about _that_! It _was_ here,\r\nno doubt, since the old gipsy died in it--but since then----The Law,\r\nonce more represented by mayor and constables, can only shrug its\r\nshoulders in the finest French manner and disclaim all responsibility\r\nfor a vagabond's goods. But the gipsy-woman persists: she begins even\r\nto clamour for her rights. \"_Rights, indeed!_\" The village, hitherto\r\nindifferent, becomes hostile; and the old cry that meets the gipsy\r\neverywhere is raised, for someone on the edge of the crowd calls\r\nout, \"Thief!\" It is a mere expression of disapproval, not a direct\r\naccusation, but the whole village takes it up joyfully: \"Thief! Thief!\"\r\nSo the gipsy-woman, who, as it chanced, has stolen nothing, is hounded\r\nout of the commune with sticks and stones and objurgations by those who\r\nhad themselves appropriated her old donkey-cart piecemeal. \"A bit of\r\nrusty iron whizzed past her as she crossed the bridge. It may once have\r\nserved as her donkey's shoe.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the tale: a sample of many in _Au Fil des Jours_. Irony and\r\nrealism are not wanting, nor yet the grimly picturesque, but the\r\nreader is left thinking: \"What a little gem this would be if it were\r\ntold by Maupassant, or some other master of the _conte_!\" Certainly\r\nM. Clemenceau has something else to do than tell _contes_! But his\r\nliterary material is so fine that it is his own fault if we expect\r\nthe very best of him. As it is, he does not take the trouble to cut\r\nthe story out clearly from the matrix of thought and memories which\r\nenfolded it in his own mind. The effect on the reader is, one might\r\nsay, a little vague and murmurous, like some tale half-heard in a crowd.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange thing that the countryside, Nature, the pure and\r\nnever-failing spring of inspiration for poetry and human delight,\r\nshould turn so different a countenance towards those who live with her,\r\nyear out and year in, winning sustenance for us all from her broad\r\nand often ungenial breast. Our Mother Earth is an iron taskmaster to\r\nthe tillers of the soil grinding out their youth and strength, bowing\r\ntheir eyes to their labour, so that all her beauty passes them by\r\nunseen. Either Nature keeps her charms jealously for the untroubled\r\nmind and the leisured eye, or else all the beauty that we see in her is\r\nborrowed, a glamour lent by some immaterial force--not ours, perhaps,\r\nbut certainly not her own. Be this as it may, in the _Embuscades de la\r\nVie_ M. Clemenceau beholds and describes the careless, endless, natural\r\nbeauty amid which the peasant-lives that he sketches for us are set;\r\nbut these themselves are often as ugly as bare stone, and the men and\r\nwomen are hard and close-fisted with one another mainly because the\r\nearth is so grudging to them. These stories are the most clear-cut of\r\nall Clemenceau's essays in fiction. They are not exactly _contes_,\r\neither: they are the discoveries, one might say, of Clemenceau in\r\nhis ancestral character as the descendant of a line of doctors and\r\nlandowners who worked for generations among the small bourgeois and the\r\ntillers of the soil. How he knows them! and--if French fiction is to\r\nbe believed--how unchangeable they are! Since the bourgeois gained his\r\nfreedom in the great Revolution by using the arm of the sans-culotte,\r\nwhat a grip he has kept upon his possession! and how much dearer to him\r\nhis property is than anything else in the world! Clemenceau does but\r\ntake up the theme of Balzac and others when he describes provincial\r\nFrance and its twin gods, money and the land--money which compels\r\nloveless marriages, envy, fawning, bitterness, perpetual small cheating\r\nor endless insect-like toil; and the land, in whose service men work\r\nthemselves and their kindred to the bone, and grudge a pittance to old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nThe bourgeoisie and their customs vary with their nationality, but\r\npeasant life is much the same all over Europe. Clemenceau found similar\r\ntraits of life and character in Galicia to those of La Vendée; and\r\nothers will tell us that from Ireland to Russia, from the Baltic to\r\nthe Black Sea, the peasant and the small farmer conduct their lives\r\nupon the same lines: hard work, dependence upon the seasons, family\r\nauthority, tribal feuds, and a meticulous social system of comment and\r\nconvention, under which the individual finds himself far less free than\r\nin the unhampered, unnoticed life of the towns.\r\n\r\nYet many of the \"ambushes of life\" are to be found in the cities; and\r\nabout a third of these tales are laid in the towns and among the\r\nwell-to-do middle class. M. Clemenceau's satire plays freely upon\r\nthe \"marriage of convention,\" by which two families agree, after a\r\ncertain amount of haggling and mutual sharp practice, to bind two young\r\nstrangers together in the closest of relationship, for time, and also,\r\nwe are told, for eternity, in the interest of property alone. Still,\r\nhuman nature adapts itself to anything, and even such marriages have\r\ntheir compensations, as our author lightly and ironically points out.\r\nBeing a genuine sociologist, he does not handle these tales of the\r\nbourgeoisie and their vagaries within what is, after all, an artificial\r\nand exclusive form of existence, as seriously as he does the great\r\nplain outlines of peasant life.\r\n\r\nWhether he writes of town or country, of _Fleur de Froment_ and _Six\r\nSous_, or of a _ménage à trois_; whether he calls up a Greek courtesan\r\nto theorise about her profession, or describes a long-standing bitter,\r\nand motiveless peasant feud, his style is always fluent and charming,\r\nvivid with irony, and graceful with poetic thought. Yet the defect as\r\nwell as the merit of M. Clemenceau's fiction and essay-writing is just\r\nthis admirable, unvarying ease and fluency. One feels that he writes\r\nwith perfect unconsciousness, as the thoughts come into his head.\r\nAnd, after a while, the ungrateful reader is inclined to ask for some\r\nkind of selection in the feast before him, where all is good, very\r\ngood, even, but nothing is _excellent_. Like a far greater writer,\r\nClemenceau--on paper at least--\"has no peaks in him.\" His literature\r\nwas an admirable \"by-product\" of his almost limitless capacities; his\r\nactions and not his writings are the achievements of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n                   CLEMENCEAU AND THE DREYFUS AFFAIR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn December, 1894, Captain Dreyfus, a member of the General Staff, was\r\nfound guilty of treason by a Court Martial. The Court was unanimous.\r\nHe was condemned to be sent to the Ile du Diable, there to expiate\r\nhis offence by the prolonged torture of imprisonment and solitary\r\nconfinement, in a tropical climate. It was a terrible punishment. But\r\nthe offence of betraying France to Germany, committed by an officer\r\nentrusted with the military secrets of the Republic, was a terrible one\r\ntoo. It seemed so incredible, especially as Captain Dreyfus was a man\r\nof considerable means, that up to the last moment the gravest doubt\r\nas to the possibility of his having committed such a crime prevailed.\r\nWhen, however, the Court declared against him as one man, and without\r\nthe slightest hesitation, there could no longer be any question of the\r\ncorrectness of the decision. For the trial had lasted four whole days,\r\nand Dreyfus had been defended by one of the ablest advocates at the\r\nParis Bar. \"What need have we of further witness?\"\r\n\r\nThat was the universal feeling. Nearly a quarter of a century before,\r\nMarshal Bazaine had betrayed France to her mortal enemy, and had\r\nescaped the penalty which was his due. Common soldiers were frequently\r\ncondemned to death and executed for impulsive actions against their\r\nsuperiors. High time an example should be made of a man of higher\r\nrank. Dreyfus was lucky not to be shot out of hand. That an Alsatian,\r\na rich man, a soldier sworn to defend his country, an officer employed\r\nin a confidential post, should thus sell his nation to Germany was\r\nfrightful. The thing was more than infamous. No punishment could be\r\ntoo bad for him. Permanent solitary confinement under a blazing sun is\r\nworse than immediate death. All the better. His fate will encourage the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nAnd Captain Dreyfus was a Jew. That made the matter worse. Powerful as\r\nthey are in politics and finance, Jews are not popular in France. By\r\nCatholics and sworn anti-Semites they are believed to be capable of\r\nanything. Even by men of open mind they are regarded with distrust as\r\ncitizens of no country, a set of Asiatic marauders encamped for the\r\ntime being in the West, whose God is a queer compound of Jahveh, Moloch\r\nand Mammon. There was thus the bitterest race and religious prejudice\r\neager to confirm the judgment of the Court Martial. The case was\r\ndecided. Dreyfus was sent off to the Island of the Devil.\r\n\r\nClemenceau shared the general opinion. He accepted the statement of\r\nthe president of the Court Martial that \"there are interests superior\r\nto all personal interests.\" And these were the interests which forbade\r\nthat the court martial should be held in public, or that the secret\r\nevidence of treason should be disclosed. Given the honour, good\r\nfaith, capacity and freedom from prejudice of the judges, this was a\r\nreasonable contention on the part of the chief officer of the Court.\r\nBut there was that to come out, in this very Dreyfus case, which should\r\nthrow grave doubt upon the advisability of any sittings behind closed\r\ndoors of any court that deals with matters into which professional,\r\npersonal or political considerations may be imported. Secrecy is\r\ninvariably harmful to democracy and injurious to fair play.\r\n\r\nThree years later Clemenceau began to understand what lay behind this\r\nveil of obscurity which he then allowed to be thrown over the whole of\r\nthe Dreyfus proceedings. He took upon himself the full burden of his\r\nown mistake. When he had distinguished his fine career by the vigorous\r\nand sustained effort in favour of justice to the victim, he reprinted\r\nat full length his articles denouncing the man about whom he had been\r\nmisled. \"I cannot claim,\" he writes, \"credit for having from the first\r\ninstinctively felt the iniquity. I believed Dreyfus to be guilty, and\r\nI said so in scathing terms. It seemed to me impossible that officers\r\nshould lightly inflict such a sentence on one of themselves. I imagined\r\nthere had been some desperate imprudence. I considered the punishment\r\nterrible, but I excused it on the ground of devotion to patriotism.\"\r\nNothing was farther from Clemenceau's thoughts, even at the close of\r\n1897, than that Dreyfus should after all be not guilty. He laughed\r\nat Bernard Lazare when he said so. Meeting M. Ranc by accident, this\r\npolitician and journalist confirmed the opinion of Lazare and declared\r\nthat Dreyfus was innocent. Again Clemenceau smiled incredulously,\r\nand was recommended to go at once and see M. Scheurer-Kestner,\r\nVice-President of the Senate, the famous Alsatian whose high qualities\r\nhe many years afterwards proclaimed in a funeral oration.\r\n\r\nThe editor of _l'Aurore_ called upon that courageous and indefatigable\r\nchampion of Dreyfus; and comparison of the handwriting of Esterhazy,\r\nthe chief witness against the captain, with that of the _bordereau_\r\nattributed to Dreyfus and decisive of his guilt, convinced Clemenceau,\r\nnot that Dreyfus was innocent, but that the judgment had been quite\r\nirregular. Therefore he resolved to begin a campaign for a revision\r\nof the case. He did not share Scheurer-Kestner's view as to the\r\nenormous difficulty and danger of such an undertaking. Trouble and\r\nmisrepresentation he anticipated. Bitter opposition from the members\r\nof the court and of the General Staff--Yes. Virulent misrepresentation\r\ndue to priestly hatred--Yes. Unceasing malignity of anti-Semites--Yes.\r\nStrong political objection to any reopening of a \"_chose jugée_,\" on\r\npublic grounds--Yes. But, in spite of all, the truth in modern France\r\nwould easily and triumphantly prevail! \"Events showed me how very far\r\nout I was in my calculations.\"\r\n\r\nAs on more than one occasion in his stormy life, therefore, Clemenceau\r\nunderrated the strength of the enemy. He had to contend against a\r\ncombination of some of the strongest interests and passions that\r\ncan affect human life and sentiment. There had been from the very\r\ncommencement a bitter feeling among some of the most powerful sections\r\nof French society against the Republic. As was shown in the rise\r\nof Boulanger, Clemenceau, by exposing the drawbacks of successive\r\nRepublican Governments, had done much to strengthen this feeling\r\namong its opponents and to weaken the loyalty of its supporters.\r\nThere was, in fact, nothing in the Republic itself to be enthusiastic\r\nabout. It was essentially a bourgeois Republic, living on in a welter\r\nof bourgeois scandals, unbalanced by any great policy at home, any\r\ngreat military successes abroad, or any great personalities at the\r\nhead of affairs. The glories of France were dimmed: the financiers of\r\nFrance--especially the Jew financiers--were more influential than ever.\r\nAll this helped the party of reaction.\r\n\r\nReligion, too, had come in to fortify finance and build up the\r\nanti-Semite group. The Catholics, to whom Jews and Free-Masons are\r\nthe red flags of the political and social bull ring, had not very\r\nlong before challenged the former to deadly combat in that Field of\r\nthe Cloth of Gold on which, to use the phrase of one of their less\r\nenlightened competitors, they \"do seem a sort of inspired.\" It is\r\npossible that had the Catholic Union Générale listened to the advice\r\nof their ablest and coolest brain, who was, be it said, neither a\r\nFrenchman nor a Catholic, the great financial combination of the\r\nChurch, with all its sanctified funds of the faithful behind it, might\r\nhave won. Even as it was, it drove a Rothschild to commit suicide,\r\nwhich was regarded as a great feat at the time.\r\n\r\nBut M. Bontoux was too ambitious, he did not possess the real financial\r\nfaculty, his first successes turned such head as he possessed. The\r\nJews, therefore, were able to work their will upon the whole of his\r\nprojects and groups, and the devout Catholic investors of Paris, Vienna\r\nand other places had the intolerable mortification of seeing their\r\nsavings swept into the coffers of the infidel. This had happened some\r\nyears before the Dreyfus case. But losers have long memories, and here\r\nwas a sore monetary grievance superadded to the previous religious\r\nhatred of the Hebrew.\r\n\r\nDreyfus was a Jew. Nay, more, he came of financial Jews who had had\r\ntheir pickings out of the collapse of the Union Générale as well as out\r\nof the guano and other concessions malignantly obtained in the Catholic\r\nRepublic of Peru. Monstrous that a man of that race and name should\r\nbe an officer in the French Army at all! Still more outrageous that\r\nhe should be placed by his ability and family influence in a position\r\nof military importance, and entrusted with serious military secrets!\r\nSomething must be done.\r\n\r\nNow the persons forming the most powerful coterie in the higher circles\r\nof the French Army at this time were not only men who had been educated\r\nat the famous military academy of St. Cyr and imbued with an _esprit\r\nde corps_ cultivated from their school-days upwards, but they were\r\nofficers who believed heartily, if not in the religion, at any rate in\r\nthe beneficent secular persuasion of the Catholic Church. They were,\r\nas was clearly shown, greatly influenced by the Jesuits, who saw the\r\nenormous advantage of keeping in close touch with the chiefs of the\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nThen there were the monarchists and Buonapartists, male and female, of\r\nevery light and shade, who were eagerly on the look-out for any stroke\r\nthat might discredit the new studious but scientific and unbelieving\r\nclass of officers, whom the exigencies of modern warfare were making\r\nmore and more essential to military efficiency. Their interest was to\r\nkeep as far as possible the main higher organisation and patronage of\r\nthe army and the General Staff a close borough and out of the hands of\r\nthese new men.\r\n\r\nAll this formed a formidable phalanx of organised enmity against any\r\nofficer who might not suit the prejudices or, at a critical moment,\r\nmight be dangerous to the plans of people who, differ as they might in\r\nother matters, were at one in disliking capable soldiers who were not\r\nof their particular set. And here was Dreyfus, who embodied in his own\r\nperson all their most cherished hatreds, who could be made the means of\r\nstriking a blow at all similar intruders upon their preserve, in such\r\nwise as greatly to injure all their enemies at once. Unfortunately for\r\nhim, Dreyfus was at the same time an able officer--so much the more\r\ndangerous, therefore--and personally not an agreeable man. Not even\r\ntheir best friends would deny to clever Jews the virtue of arrogance.\r\nDreyfus was arrogant. He was not a grateful person to his superiors or\r\nto his equals. They all wanted to get rid of him on their own account,\r\nand their friends outside were ready enough to embitter them against\r\nhim because he was a Jew.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that there was an elaborate plot afoot among all\r\nwho were brought in contact with Dreyfus, or that, when the charge\r\nagainst him was formulated, there was a deliberate intention, on the\r\npart of the members of the Court Martial, to find him guilty, no matter\r\nwhat happened. But it is now quite certain that, from the first, the\r\nidea that he was a spy was agreeable to his fellow-officers in the\r\nMinistry of War; and, being satisfied as to his responsibility for the\r\ncrime that they wished to believe him guilty of, they did not stick\r\nat trifles, in the matter of procedure and testimony, which might\r\nrelieve their consciences and justify their judgment. Knowing, then,\r\nthe powerful combination which would oppose to the death any revision\r\nof Dreyfus's trial, Scheurer-Kestner, resolute and self-sacrificing as\r\nhe was, might well take a less sanguine view than Clemenceau of the\r\nprobabilities of certain victory as soon as the truth was made known.\r\n\r\nBut when once he began to doubt whether Dreyfus had had fair play,\r\nClemenceau immediately showed those qualities of personal and\r\npolitical courage, persistence, disregard of popularity, and power\r\nof concentrating all his forces upon the immediate matter in hand,\r\nindifferent to the numbers and strength of his opponents, which had\r\ngained him so high a place in the estimation of all democrats and\r\nlovers of fair play long before. \"If there are manifest probabilities\r\nof error, the case must be revised.\" That was his view. But the\r\nNational Army and the National Religion, as bitter opponents of justice\r\nput it, were one and indivisible on this matter. Militarism and\r\nJesuitism together, backed by the high society of reaction and a large\r\nsection of the bourgeoisie, constituted a stalwart array in favour of\r\nthe perpetuation of injustice. There was literally scarce a crime of\r\nwhich this combination was not capable rather than admit that by any\r\npossibility a Court Martial on a Jew captain could go wrong.\r\n\r\nThe Minister of War, General Billot, the Prime Ministers Méline and\r\nBrisson, generals of high standing such as Mercier, Boisdeffre, Gonse,\r\nZurlinden and others, officers of lower rank and persons connected\r\nwith them, were gradually mixed up with and defended such a series\r\nof attempted murders, ordered suicides, wholesale forgeries, defence\r\nand decoration of exposed spies, perjury, misrepresentation and false\r\nimprisonment that the marvel is how France survived such a tornado of\r\nturpitude. Clemenceau little knew what it would all lead to when, by no\r\nmeans claiming that Dreyfus was innocent, he and Scheurer-Kestner and\r\nZola and Jaurès, and all honest Radicals and Socialists, demanded that,\r\neven if Dreyfus were guilty, he could not have been _legally_ condemned\r\non false evidence and forged documents: the latter never having been\r\ncommunicated to his counsel. It was on this ground that Clemenceau\r\ndemanded a revision of the trial.\r\n\r\nBut quite early in the fray the defenders of the Court Martial became\r\ndesperate in their determination that the matter should never be\r\nthoroughly investigated. The honour of the army was at stake. Colonel\r\nPicquart, a man of the highest credit and capacity, comes to the\r\nconclusion in the course of his official inspection of documents\r\nat headquarters that the incriminating paper on which Dreyfus was\r\ncondemned, but which he was never allowed to see, was not in his\r\nhandwriting at all, but in that of Major Esterhazy, an officer disliked\r\nand distrusted by all fellow-officers with whom he had served.\r\nPicquart, in fact, suspected that Esterhazy was a Prussian spy and\r\nthat he forged the _bordereau_ which convinced the Court Martial of\r\nDreyfus's guilt. But before this, in 1894 when the story leaked out\r\nthat an officer having relations with the General Staff was suspected\r\nof treachery, it was not Dreyfus whose name was first mentioned. His\r\nold comrades said with one accord, \"It must be Esterhazy: we thought\r\nso.\" Esterhazy, however, soon made himself necessary to the army chiefs\r\nand their Catholics. If his character was blasted publicly, down\r\nthese gentry would come, and with them the whole of the proceedings\r\nagainst Dreyfus. They therefore suggested to Picquart that he should\r\nsimply hold his tongue. \"_You_ are not at l'Ile du Diable,\" they said.\r\nBut Picquart would persist, so they sent him off to Tunis. However,\r\nthanks to Scheurer-Kestner and others, the truth began to come out,\r\nand Picquart still refused to be silenced. So instead of dealing with\r\nEsterhazy, they arrested his accuser and gave the Major a certificate\r\nof the very highest character.\r\n\r\nAs it began, so it went on. Clemenceau's daily articles and attacks\r\ndrove the militarists, the Catholics, the anti-Semites, and the\r\nreactionaries generally, into a fury. Colonel Henry, Colonel Paty du\r\nClam, the Jesuit Father du Lac, the editors and contributors of the\r\n_Figaro_, the _Echo de Paris_ (the special organ of the Staff), the\r\n_Gaulois_ were in a permanent conspiracy with the generals named above,\r\nand the General Staff itself, to prevent the truth from being known. It\r\nwas all of no use. Picquart under lock and key was more effective than\r\nPicquart at large. Slowly but surely men of open mind became convinced\r\nthat, little as they wished to believe it, something was wrong. But\r\nthese were always the minority. Few could grasp the fact that an\r\ninnocent man was being put in chains on the Ile du Diable, virtually\r\nbecause there was an agitation in favour of his re-trial in Paris.\r\n\r\nThen came Zola's terrible letter in the _Aurore_, which Clemenceau had\r\nsuggested, and gave up his daily article in order to give place to.\r\nHe also supplied the title \"_J'Accuse_.\" Zola summed up the whole\r\nevidence relentlessly against the General Staff and its tools and\r\nforgers, Esterhazy, Henry, Paty du Clam and the rest of them.\r\n\r\nSuch an indictment, formulated by a novelist who was universally\r\nrecognised as one of the leading men of letters in Europe, quite\r\noutside of the political arena, would have attracted attention at\r\nany time. In the midst of a period when all feelings and minds were\r\nwrought up to the highest point of tension, it came as a direct and\r\nheavy blow at the whole of the military party. It is difficult to\r\nrealise to-day the sensation produced. It had all the effect of a\r\ncombined attack of horse, foot and artillery for which preparation\r\nhad been made long before by a successful bombardment. There was no\r\neffective answer possible in words. This the military cliques and\r\ntheir friends at once saw and acted upon. They abandoned discussion\r\nand forced Zola and _l'Aurore_ into court on a charge of treason and\r\nlibel. The action stirred all Europe and riveted attention throughout\r\nthe civilised world. This was due not merely to Zola's great reputation\r\nand popularity, to the political position held by Clemenceau, to the\r\nenthralling interest of the Dreyfus affair itself, to the excitement of\r\nthe life-and-death struggle between freedom and reaction, but to the\r\nfact that behind all this lay the never-dying hostility of Germany to\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAll this was too much for the criminal champions of \"the honour of\r\nthe Army.\" _L'Aurore_ and Zola must be prosecuted. They were. And\r\nClemenceau conducted his own defence. It was a crucial case, and the\r\nfamous advocate Labori had previously done his best for Zola, pointing\r\nout that the whole drama turned on the prisoner then suffering at the\r\nIle du Diable: perhaps the most infamous criminal, perhaps a martyr,\r\nthe victim of human fallibility. He had shown, however, that \"all the\r\npowers for Justice are combined _against_ Justice,\" and had called for\r\nthe revision of a great case.\r\n\r\n\"After the jury have adjudicated, public opinion and France herself\r\nwill judge you,\" said Clemenceau himself. \"You have been told that a\r\ndocument was privately communicated to the Court. Do you understand\r\nwhat that means? It means that a man is tried, is condemned, is covered\r\nwith ignominy, his own name, that of his wife, of his children, of his\r\nfather, of all his connections eternally blasted, on the faith of a\r\ndocument he had never been shown. Gentlemen, who among you would not\r\nrevolt at the very idea of being condemned under such conditions? Who\r\namong you would not adjure us to demand justice for you if, brought\r\nbefore a tribunal, after a mockery of investigation, after a purely\r\nformal discussion, the judges, meeting out of your presence, decided\r\non your honour and your life, condemning you, without appeal, on a\r\ndocument of whose very existence you were kept in ignorance? Who among\r\nyou would quietly submit to such a decision? If this has been done, I\r\ntell you your one duty above all others is that such a case should be\r\nre-tried.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the main point, as Clemenceau saw even more clearly than\r\nM. Labori. No man, guilty or innocent, could be justly condemned\r\nand sentenced on the strength of a written document the purport and\r\neven the existence of which had been deliberately concealed from the\r\nprisoner and his counsel. It scarcely needed further argument, not\r\neven the direct proof which was forthcoming that Colonel Sandherr,\r\nthe president of the Court Martial, had a bitter and unreasoning\r\nprejudice against Jews. If the validity of the document had been beyond\r\nall possibility of question; if witnesses whose good faith had been\r\nunquestionable had seen Dreyfus write it with their own eyes: even\r\nthen the trial was legally vitiated by the fact that it had not been\r\nshown to the accused. But if the document was forged----? All the other\r\npoints, serious as some of them were, counted little by the side of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThat, therefore, Clemenceau dealt with most persistently. That,\r\ntherefore, the General Staff, with its coterie of Jesuits, anti-Semites\r\nand spies, was determined to cover up. The generals who bore witness in\r\nthe case against Zola and _l'Aurore_ showed by their threats and their\r\nadmissions they knew that it was they themselves and the members of\r\nthe secret Court Martial who were really on their trial at the bar of\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nIt was in this sense that Clemenceau closed his memorable defence.\r\nHe declared against the forger of the _bordereau_, the Prussian spy,\r\nEsterhazy, who was sheltered and honoured by the chiefs of the French\r\nArmy. \"Yes, it is we,\" he cried, amid derisive shouts and howls in\r\ncourt, \"it is we who are the defenders of the army, when we call upon\r\nyou to drive Esterhazy out of it. The conscious or unconscious enemies\r\nof the army are those who propose to cashier Picquart and retain\r\nEsterhazy. Gentlemen of the jury, a general has come here to talk to\r\nyou about your children. Tell me now which of them would like to find\r\nhimself in Esterhazy's battalion? Tell me, would you hand over your\r\nsons to this officer to lead against the enemy? The very question is\r\nenough. Who does not know the answer before it is given?\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the jury, I have done. We have passed through terrible\r\nexperiences in this century. We have known glory and disaster in every\r\nform, we are even at this moment face to face with the unknown. Fears\r\nand hopes encompass us around. Grasp the opportunity as we ourselves\r\nhave grasped it. Be masters of your own destinies. A people sitting in\r\njudgment on itself is a noble thing. A stirring scene also is a people\r\ndeciding on its own future. Your task, gentlemen of the jury, is to\r\npronounce a verdict less upon us than upon yourselves. We are appearing\r\nbefore you. You will appear before history.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                        THE DREYFUS AFFAIR (II)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis trial of Zola and _l'Aurore_ was the greatest crisis in the long\r\nsuccession of crises which centred themselves round Dreyfus. The more\r\nserious the evidence against the conduct of the Court Martial and the\r\nhonour of the army, the more truculent became the attitude of the\r\nmilitarists, Catholics, anti-Semites and their following. Passion\r\nswept away every vestige of judgment or reason. There was no pretence\r\nof fair play to the defendants. Inside the Court, which was packed\r\nto overflowing, inarticulate roars came from the audience when any\r\ntelling argument or conclusive piece of testimony was put in on the\r\nside of truth and justice. Outside, an infuriated mob of reactionists\r\ndemanded the lives of the accused. The smell of blood was in the air.\r\nThe likelihood of organised massacre grew more obvious every day.\r\nClemenceau told me himself--and he does not know what fear is--that if\r\nZola had been acquitted, instead of being condemned, the Dreyfusards\r\npresent would have been slaughtered in court.\r\n\r\nHow determined the whole unscrupulous and desperate clique were to\r\ncarry their defence of injustice to the last ditch was displayed when\r\nM. Brisson, the President of the Republic, himself a man credited with\r\naustere probity and cool courage, was forced by them to authorise\r\nproceedings against Colonel Picquart, because he had offered the\r\nhighest personage in France to help him to discover the truth. Picquart\r\nwas therefore to be victimised still further: likewise for the honour\r\nof the army! He was duly incarcerated and degraded. France herself was\r\nbeing found guilty and cashiered by the persecution of this high-minded\r\nand courageous colonel. Esterhazy runs away when his treachery and\r\nforgeries are finally exposed. Clemenceau and the Dreyfusards are\r\nwilling that he should have a safe-conduct back again, if his coming\r\nwill help to manifest the truth. A very different attitude towards\r\na culprit convicted, not by a secret Court Martial, but by his own\r\npublic actions and admissions. Yet General Gonse and the General Staff\r\nwere ready at first to aid and support Colonel Picquart in exposing\r\nMajor Esterhazy, as only a German spy, in constant communication and\r\ncollusion with Colonel Schwartzkopfen, acting on behalf of the German\r\nArmy and the German Government. Esterhazy was no direct agent of the\r\nFrench Staff! When, however, it was discovered that Colonel Picquart's\r\ninvestigations went far to clear Captain Dreyfus altogether, and proved\r\nthat he had at any rate been condemned on a forged document, _then_\r\nPicquart himself was to be treated as a criminal, unless he suppressed\r\nthe truth at once, and held his tongue for ever.\r\n\r\nAnd so this extraordinary case was now being tried in the open street\r\nbefore the public of France and of the world--for every civilised\r\nnation followed the changes and chances of Dreyfus's martyrdom--and so\r\nday after day, week after week, month after month, year after year,\r\nClemenceau, Scheurer-Kestner, Jaurès and the Socialists fought on for\r\na re-trial. The highest Court of judicature in France, worthy of its\r\nhistory, accorded the right of appeal. A sense of doubt was beginning\r\nto creep through the community. Thereupon, the Generals, their Church,\r\ntheir Press, their Mob, _their_ Army, began afresh a very devil dance\r\nof organised forgery, calumny, perjury, vituperation, attempted murder\r\nand concomitant infamies.\r\n\r\nLooking back at that period of desperate antagonism, it seems strange\r\nthat open conflict should have been averted. It was no fault of the\r\nGeneral Staff and its myrmidons that it did not break out. That such a\r\nresult of their campaign of injustice and provocation would have been\r\nwelcomed by many of the chiefs of the French Army is beyond question.\r\nAt more than one juncture the outlook was so threatening that two, if\r\nnot three, pretenders to the throne of France were in the country at\r\nthe same time. Things did not take the turn they expected, and they\r\nwent off again. All this was known, of course, to Clemenceau, who was\r\nalso well aware that a great deal more lay behind the Dreyfus affair\r\nthan the guilt or innocence of Dreyfus. Nor did the fact by any means\r\nescape him that those semi-occult ecclesiastical influences which had\r\nbeen against him all his life, not for personal reasons, but because\r\nhe was a Radical, a free-thinker and a champion of free speech, a free\r\npress, secular and gratuitous education, and separation of Church and\r\nState--that those hidden powers were at work behind the General Staff\r\nin the Dreyfus case in the hope of gaining ground on a side issue which\r\nthey were losing steadily on the main field of battle.\r\n\r\nThis it was which made the collision between the two opposing forces so\r\ncritical an event for France. This, too, accounted for the desperation\r\nof the losing party.\r\n\r\nThe Jesuits of the Dreyfus affair had none of the diabolical far-seeing\r\ncoolness of the type represented by the Père Rodin in Eugène Sue's\r\n_Wandering Jew_. They were infuriated fanatics whose unreasoning\r\nanxiety to torture and burn their heretic opponents was reflected in\r\nthe blundering mendacity and undisguised hatred of their tools of the\r\nmilitary Staff. Hence, in the long run, they delivered themselves into\r\nthe hands of the Frenchmen of the future--Zola, Jaurès, Picquart and\r\nClemenceau. Clemenceau's daily articles, which constituted the most\r\nformidable barrage on behalf of Dreyfus, make up five closely printed\r\nvolumes. They are full of life and fire; but they are full also of\r\ncrushing argument enforced with irony and sarcasm and illustrated by\r\ntelling references to recent history. Abuse and misrepresentation could\r\nnot permanently hold their own in a discussion thus conducted. Forgery\r\nand perjury when brought home to the real criminals necessarily made\r\ntheir case worse. Nothing is more surprising than the lack of dexterity\r\nand acumen on the part of the reactionary forces. They forgot that a\r\nbludgeon is a poor weapon against a rapier in the hand of an expert.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that after a long contest, whose interest, even for\r\noutsiders, was maintained throughout by tragical incidents such as the\r\nsuicide of Colonel Henry--the forger for _esprit de corps_ as Esterhazy\r\nwas the forger for money and power--the attempted poisoning of Picquart\r\nand the attack upon Labori, a re-trial was forced from the Government\r\nof the day. The names of the chief opponents are already forgotten,\r\nsuch minor actors and apologists of injustice, forgers and spies on the\r\n\"right side\" were never remembered. Who now cares whether the _petit\r\nbleu_ was written by Schwartzkopfen or not? Who can recall what Major\r\nLauth did or bore witness to? The trail of the serpent is over them\r\nall. That is what the world bears in mind to-day. The broad features\r\nof the drama are recorded on the cinema film of history. The faces and\r\ncharacters of the villains of the piece are already blotted out. Only\r\nthe heroes of the conflict remain. And of these heroes Clemenceau might\r\nfairly claim to be the chief. The re-trial at Rennes was, when all is\r\nsaid, mainly his work.\r\n\r\nWhat a re-trial it was! The Court was still a Court Martial. The\r\npresident of the court, Colonel Jouaust, was still a violently\r\nprejudiced officer. The judges behind him were all inspired by that\r\nfatal _esprit de corps_ which accepts and acts upon the Jesuit motto\r\nthat the end justifies the means, where the interests of a particular\r\nset of men are concerned. In fact, the combination in favour of\r\nmilitary injustice remained what it had been throughout: a body\r\nresolved that, come what might, the victim of the forged document and\r\nother criminal acts should not be formally acquitted, even if monstrous\r\nillegality at the first trial forced a revision.\r\n\r\nNearly five years had now elapsed from the date of Dreyfus's original\r\ncondemnation, when, released from his imprisonment, he stood at the\r\nBar after that long period of physical and moral torture. Clemenceau\r\nis not a man of sentiment: he had long doubted whether Dreyfus was\r\nreally innocent: even the outrageous proceedings at the first Court\r\nMartial had failed to convince him that there might not be something\r\nbehind the forged _bordereau_, concealed from the prisoner, which\r\ncould in a degree justify his judges: not until the close of the case\r\nagainst Zola and _l'Aurore_ was his mind made up that, \"consciously\r\nor unconsciously,\" a terrible crime had been committed. But now, with\r\nDreyfus himself present, with all the old witnesses contradicting, more\r\ndirectly than ever, one another's testimony, yet allowed incredible\r\nlicence of exposition and explanation by the Court; with the evidence\r\nof General Gonse, General Mercier, Roget, Cinquet, Gribelin, Lauth and\r\nJunck cut to ribands by the questions of Dreyfus's advocates; with\r\nColonel Picquart brought up short by Colonel Jouaust, who had allowed\r\nall sorts of long-winded and irreconcilable accounts to be given\r\nby his favourites subject to no interruption--with all this almost\r\ninconceivable unfairness going on all day and every day through the\r\nRennes Court Martial, Clemenceau seems to have been really affected,\r\nnot only by the injustice done, but by the personal sufferings which\r\nthe prisoner on trial had undergone and was undergoing.\r\n\r\nColonel Jouaust's interruption of Colonel Picquart's closely knit but\r\npassionless statement by the exclamation \"_Encore!_\" was destined\r\nto become famous. It summed up in one word the whole tone of the\r\nprosecuting judges on the Bench. Yet as the case proceeded and the\r\ncriticisms of Clemenceau and his coadjutors became still more scathing\r\nthan they had been before, it was difficult to see how even a suborned\r\ncourt could avoid a verdict of acquittal. But this Court dared not\r\nbe just. There was too much at stake. The whole of the chiefs of the\r\narmy had taken sides against the prisoner. They were there to secure\r\ncondemnation of Dreyfus again at all costs. The Court, headed by\r\nColonel Jouaust, was forced to do the same. It was the \"Honour of the\r\nArmy\" backed by Esterhazy, Henry and Sandherr against the character of\r\none miserable Jew. There could be no hesitation under such conditions.\r\nDreyfus was found \"Guilty, with extenuating circumstances.\"\r\nExtenuating circumstances in the dealings of a spy and a traitor who,\r\nnot being in any pressing pecuniary need whatever, had deliberately\r\nand infamously sold France to the enemy! Not one of the five judges\r\nwho rendered this verdict could really have believed Dreyfus to be\r\nguilty. France was more dishonoured by this decision than if the Court\r\nhad definitely declared against the whole weight of the evidence that\r\nDreyfus was a traitor.\r\n\r\nDreyfus was thereafter \"pardoned\" and released. That special plot of\r\nthe anti-Republican clerico-military syndicate of Father du Lac, to\r\nuse Clemenceau's phraseology, had after all miscarried. As the result\r\nof incredible efforts Dreyfus was at last a free man. The world could\r\njudge of the character of his accusers and of his champions. It did\r\njudge, and that verdict has never been revised. A gross injustice had\r\nbeen partly remedied but could never be fully obliterated. That Dreyfus\r\nwas innocent the world at large had no doubt.\r\n\r\nYet, strange to say, there are still men, who certainly had no feeling\r\nagainst Dreyfus but quite the contrary, who were not convinced. I have\r\nheard this view expressed from several quarters, but the opinions of\r\ntwo personal friends of the most different character and career made a\r\nconsiderable impression upon me at the time. The first was my friend,\r\nthe late George Henty, well known as a special correspondent and author\r\nof exceedingly successful books for boys. Henty was a thorough-going\r\nTory, but he had no doubt that Dreyfus was a terribly ill-used man and\r\nthe victim of a foul plot--until he went over to France to watch the\r\nre-trial by court martial at Rennes. He returned in quite a different\r\nframe of mind. He knew I was entirely favourable to Dreyfus, as he\r\nhimself had been when he crossed the Channel. Meeting him by accident,\r\nI asked him his opinion: \"All I can tell you, Hyndman, is that I\r\nwatched the man carefully throughout and he made a very bad impression\r\nupon me indeed. The longer I looked at him the worse I felt about him.\r\nI don't deny for a moment that his first trial was abominably conducted\r\nand that he was entitled to fair play. I daresay I may be all wrong,\r\nthe weight of the evidence might have overborne me as a juryman. But,\r\nas it was, I felt that if I myself had been one of the jury I should\r\nhave given a verdict against him. The man looked and spoke like a spy,\r\nand if he isn't a spy,\" Henty went on in his impulsive way, \"I'll\r\nbe damned if he oughtn't to be one.\" That, of course, is simply the\r\nstatement of an impressionable Englishman, who, however, understood\r\nwhat was going on.\r\n\r\nThe other anti-Dreyfusard was a very different personality. It was the\r\nfamous German Social-Democrat Wilhelm Liebknecht. I knew him well.\r\nA man of a cooler temper or a more judicial mind I never met. As I\r\nhave mentioned elsewhere, he and Jaurès, the great French Socialist\r\nleader and orator, were staying with me together in Queen Anne's\r\nGate, just after the Rennes Court Martial. Jaurès had done immense\r\nservice in the Dreyfus matter, second only to that of Clemenceau. He\r\nhad studied the evidence thoroughly on both sides. Like Clemenceau,\r\nhe had been forced to the conclusion that such methods of defence\r\nwould never have been used, unless they had been necessary to cover\r\nup the unjust condemnation of an innocent man, who was known to his\r\njudges to _be_ innocent shortly after he had been shipped off to his\r\nplace of punishment. Jaurès's articles in _La Petite République_ had\r\nhelped Dreyfus greatly in one way, though in another they told against\r\nhim, as the Socialists themselves were unfairly charged with being\r\nanti-patriots and even in German pay. There seemed no possibility\r\nthat he could be mistaken. Liebknecht was just as strong on the other\r\nside. He was confident that Dreyfus was a traitor. One of his main\r\ncontentions rested on the statement that there existed an honourable\r\nunderstanding, never broken under any circumstances, between civilised\r\nGovernments that, should a man be wrongfully accused of being a spy and\r\nbe brought to trial for that offence, the foreign Government which he\r\nwas supposed to be serving should notify the other Government concerned\r\nthat it had got hold of the wrong man. Now the German Government\r\nhad never done this in any way, at any period of the Dreyfus affair.\r\nOf this Liebknecht affirmed he was absolutely certain. Statements as\r\nto Dreyfus's innocence had been made by German military officers;\r\nbut the German Government itself, which knew everything, had never\r\nmoved. Therefore, urged Liebknecht, Dreyfus was a spy. But the German\r\nSocialist leader gave his own view too. \"Have either of you,\" he asked\r\nJaurès and myself, \"read carefully through the verbatim report of the\r\nre-trial at Rennes?\" I admitted I had not. Jaurès said he had. \"Well,\"\r\nLiebknecht went on, \"I was where I was in a position to read the whole\r\nof the pleading and the evidence day by day and word by word. For I was\r\nin prison the whole of the time, and the study of the verbatim report\r\nwas my daily avocation. I am as certain as I can be of anything of the\r\nkind that Dreyfus had disclosed secrets to our Government. He may have\r\ndone so in order to secure more important information in return. That\r\nis possible. But communicate French secrets to Germany, in my opinion,\r\nhe unquestionably did.\"\r\n\r\nWe debated the matter fully several times. Nothing Jaurès or I could\r\nsay shook Liebknecht's conviction. Nor was it shaken to the day of\r\nhis death. I have heard since, on good authority, that more than one\r\nof those who had risked much for Dreyfus never spoke to him again\r\nafter the Rennes re-trial. That may easily have arisen from personal\r\ncauses, for Dreyfus was not an agreeable man. But I have no ground for\r\nbelieving that Clemenceau ever saw reason to waver in his opinion in\r\nthe slightest degree.\r\n\r\nI recall this now, when the lapse of years has calmed down all\r\nexcitement and many of the chief actors are dead, to show how, apart\r\nfrom the mass of sheer prejudice and unscrupulous rascality which\r\nhad to be faced and overcome, there was also an element of honest\r\nintellectual doubt among the anti-Dreyfusards. The presence of this\r\nelement in the background made Clemenceau's task more difficult than it\r\nwould otherwise have been. Even at the present time there may be found\r\ncapable observers who lived through the whole conflict, certainly\r\nnot sympathetic to militarism, Catholicism or anti-Semitism, who are\r\nstill ready to argue that Dreyfus may have been ill-used but that he\r\ndeserved the fate to which he was originally condemned! This, however,\r\nmay be said with perfect truth, that the victory of his opponents over\r\nClemenceau, Jaurès, Zola and all they represented would have been a\r\ndisaster to France, whatever view may be taken of Dreyfus himself.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the first report of the Committee appointed to examine into the\r\nwhole of the Dreyfus case was presented. It exonerated Dreyfus from all\r\nblame, declared him to have been the victim of a conspiracy based upon\r\nperjury and forgery. This report secured the complete annulment of the\r\ncondemnation at Rennes and restored him to his position in the army,\r\nafter years of martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                           AS ADMINISTRATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this time Clemenceau, owing to his apparently resolute determination\r\nnot to take office, no matter how many Ministries he might successfully\r\nbring to naught, had got into a backwater. He had become permanently\r\nSenator for the Department of the Var in 1902, a startling, almost\r\nincomprehensible move when his continued furious opposition to that\r\nbody is remembered. However, having thus made unto himself friends of\r\nthe mammon of unrighteousness, he found their \"eternal habitations\" a\r\nnot unpleasing dwelling-place. His position as publicist and journalist\r\nwas assured and nothing could shake it; his criticisms by speech and\r\npen were as telling and vigorous as ever. But at sixty-five years of\r\nage he was still a free-lance, a force which all parties were obliged\r\nto consider but with which no Ministry could come to terms. It was a\r\nstrange position. So his countrymen thought. Those who most admired\r\nhis ability and his career saw no outlet for his marvellous energy\r\nthat would be permanently beneficial to the country in a constructive\r\nsense. Perhaps no politician of any nation ever so persistently refused\r\nto \"range himself\" as did Clemenceau for thirty-five years of stormy\r\npublic life. He revelled in opposition: he rejoiced in overthrow. He\r\nwas on the side of the people, but he would not help them to realise\r\ntheir aspirations in practical life. He was a political philosopher\r\ncompact of incompatibilities. As an individualist he was a stalwart\r\nchampion of individual freedom: as a man of affairs he advocated the\r\nuse of State power to limit the anarchic domination of personal power.\r\n\r\nThere was no understanding such a man. He would remain a brilliant\r\nFrenchman of whom all were proud until the end, when he would be buried\r\nwith public honours as the champion Ishmaelite of his age. \"When\r\nI saw he doubted about everything, I decided that I needed nobody\r\nto keep me ignorant,\" wrote Voltaire. Much the same idea prevailed\r\nabout Clemenceau. He was the universal sceptic: the man whose sole\r\nintellectual enjoyment was to point out the limitless incapacity of\r\nothers with epigrammatic zeal. I myself, who had watched him closely,\r\nwas afraid that he would allow all opportunities for displaying his\r\nreally great faculties in a ministerial capacity to slip by and leave\r\nto his friends only the mournful task of writing his epitaph: \"Here\r\nlies Clemenceau the destroyer who could have been a creator.\"\r\n\r\nBut this was all nonsense. \"_Ce jeune homme_\"--Clemenceau will die\r\nyoung--\"_d'un si beau passé_\" had also before him _un bel avenir_.\r\nNothing is certain with Clemenceau but the unforeseen. At the very\r\ntime when people had made up their minds that he was a back number, he\r\nhad a brand-new volume of his adventures ready for the press. After a\r\nfew conversations with M. Rouvier and then with M. Sarrien, he became\r\nMinister of the Interior in the latter's Cabinet. He took office for\r\nthe first time on March 12th, 1906, at a very stirring epoch.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to exaggerate the impression produced by this step\r\non the part of M. Clemenceau. His accession to M. Sarrien's Cabinet\r\neclipsed in interest every other political event. Here was the great\r\npolitical leader and organiser of opposition, the Radical of Radicals,\r\nthe man who had declined the challenge alike of friends and of enemies\r\nto take office, time after time, at last seated in a ministerial chair.\r\nAll his past rose up around him. The destroyer of opportunism: the Guy\r\nEarl of Warwick of ministries: the universal critic; the immolator\r\nof Jules Perry and many another statesman; the one Frenchman who had\r\nmaintained the ideals of the French Revolution against all comers--this\r\nterrible champion of democracy _à outrance_ now placed himself in the\r\nofficial hierarchy, whence he had so often ousted others. His victims\r\nof yesterday could be his critics of to-day. How would this terrible\r\nupsetter of Cabinets act as a Minister himself? That was what all the\r\nworld waited with impatience to see. They had not days, but only hours\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nThat was the time when, M. Delcassé having been forced to resign\r\nfrom the Foreign Office, almost, it may be said, at the dictation of\r\nGermany, the Morocco affair was still in a very dangerous condition,\r\nthreatening the peace of France and of Europe. But even the critical\r\nnegotiations at Algeciras were for the moment overshadowed by a\r\nterrific colliery disaster in the Courrières-Lens district, causing\r\nthe death of more miners than had ever been killed before by a similar\r\ncatastrophe. This horrible incident occurred but a few days before\r\nClemenceau became Minister of the Interior, and it fell within the\r\nimmediate sphere of his official duties.\r\n\r\nThe mines where the accident occurred had long been regarded as very\r\ndangerous, fire-damp being known to pervade them from time to time,\r\nand the miners throughout the coal regions had long held that the\r\nowners had never taken proper precautions to ensure the safety of the\r\nmen. They went down the pits day after day, not only to work on very\r\ndifficult and narrow seams, but at the hourly risk of their lives.\r\nOwing to the great social and political influence of the mine-owners\r\nit was practically impossible to get anything done, and the general\r\ntreatment of the men employed was worse than is usual even in those\r\ndistricts in our own and other countries where coal magnates are\r\nmasters. The pitmen under such conditions were less cared for and more\r\nharshly treated than animals, probably because they were less costly\r\nand could be more easily replaced.\r\n\r\nThree days before the main explosion there had been an outburst of\r\nfire-damp at a small adjacent mine, whose workings were in direct\r\ncommunication with the larger pits. This alone ought to have been taken\r\nas a serious warning to the engineers in control. But markets were\r\ngood, coal was in great demand, the \"hands\" were there to take risks.\r\nSo this minor difficulty was dealt with in a cheap and convenient\r\nway, and the extraction of coal went on upon a large scale from the\r\nimperilled shafts as it did before. Meanwhile the dangerous gases were\r\nall the time oozing in from the smaller pit to the larger ones. For\r\nthree days this went steadily on, and nothing whatever was done, either\r\nin the way of taking further precautions where the original danger\r\nbegan, or of testing the character of the air in the bigger mines to\r\nwhich the other pit had access.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, March 10th, no fewer than 1,800 men went down the shafts\r\ninto the mines. A full account of what actually took place could never\r\nbe given. All that was learned from the survivors was that the miners\r\nworking with bare lights in these dangerous pits suddenly encountered\r\nan influx of fire-damp. Explosion after explosion took place. The\r\nunfortunate men below, threatened at once with suffocation or being\r\nburned alive, rushed in headlong disorder for the cages which would\r\nlift them to the surface. Horrible scenes inevitably took place. Those\r\nin front were pressed on by those behind, who, as one of them expressed\r\nit, were breathing burning air. For the majority there was and there\r\ncould be no hope. Out of the 1,800 miners who went down in the morning,\r\nmore than 1,150 were either stifled by the gas or burnt alive. The\r\nheroism displayed by the pitmen themselves, in their partially\r\nsuccessful endeavours to rescue their entombed comrades, was the only\r\nbright feature in the whole of this frightful disaster. Some of these\r\nfine fellows went down to what seemed certain death, and others worked\r\nat excavation until almost dead themselves in their efforts to save a\r\nfew from the general fate. No wonder that the feeling throughout the\r\nneighbourhood was desperately bitter.\r\n\r\nThe war, sad to say, has much modified our general conception of\r\nthe value of human life, even when unnecessarily thrown away. But\r\nsacrifices for a great cause on the battlefield or on the ocean,\r\nhowever serious, are made as a rule for high ideals. They differ widely\r\nfrom the loss of life deliberately occasioned by capitalist neglect or\r\ngreed. Thus a mining accident on a large scale, or a conflagration\r\nin a peaceful city, produces a stronger impression on the public mind\r\nthan the loss of ten or twenty times the number of soldiers or sailors\r\nin a world-wide struggle. Among the widows and children and relations\r\nand comrades of the victims on the spot the exasperation against the\r\nemployers was still greater. Class hatred and personal hatred were\r\nexcited to a very high pitch.\r\n\r\nThis was the more natural for two reasons. First, the company on whose\r\nproperty the immolation of so many pitmen had occurred, and to whose\r\nmismanagement and cold-blooded indifference the avoidable explosions\r\nwere due, had made enormous, almost incredible profits. From dividends\r\nof fifty per cent. in 1863 their returns had risen to profits of 1,000\r\nper cent. in 1905. Yet they could not spare the comparatively small sum\r\nnecessary to safeguard the lives of the men who obtained this wealth\r\nfor the shareholders. Secondly, the Germans, who rendered assistance\r\nin the attempts to rescue the Frenchmen still in the workings below,\r\nopenly proclaimed that it was quite impossible--as indeed was the\r\ntruth--that such an accident on such a scale should have occurred in\r\nGermany. That the Empire in Germany should be far more careful of\r\nthe lives and limbs of the miners than the Republic in France, and\r\nthat huge profits should have been made still huger by the refusal of\r\nthe French coal-owners to adopt the ordinary precautions enforced by\r\nlaw on the other side of the frontier--these considerations, driven\r\nhome by the results of the great catastrophe, rendered the situation\r\nexceedingly perilous from every point of view. A strike for increased\r\nwages seemed a very poor outcome of the horrors inflicted upon the\r\nactual producers of the coal under such conditions.\r\n\r\nClemenceau was perhaps the best man in the country to deal with the\r\nminers at such a juncture. A Socialist of mining experience would\r\npossibly have taken more decidedly the side of the men, but he would\r\nnot have been able to carry with him to the same extent the support of\r\nthe Chambers. And Clemenceau had gone very far already on collectivist\r\nlines. Not many years before, in an article on \"The Right to Strike,\"\r\nhe had put the case of the men very strongly indeed. In a vehement\r\nprotest against the theory of supply and demand, as applied to the\r\nhuman beings compelled to sell labour power as a commodity, and the\r\npolitical economy of the profiteers based upon subsistence wages\r\nfor the workers--all being for the best in the best of possible\r\nworlds--Clemenceau set forth how the system worked in practice:--\r\n\r\n\"The State _gives_ to some sleek, well-set-up bourgeois immense\r\ncoal-fields below ground. These fine fellows turn to men less well\r\ndressed than themselves, but who are men all the same, men with the\r\nsame wants, the same feelings, the same capacity for enjoyment and\r\nsuffering, and say: 'We will grant you subsistence; sink us some pits\r\nin the earth; go below and bring us up coal, which we will sell at a\r\ngood price.'\r\n\r\n\"Agreed. The pits are sunk, the coal comes out of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"But, observe, those comfortable bourgeois for their outlay of _five\r\nhundred francs_ (£20) have now a bit of paper which is worth _forty\r\nthousand francs_ (£1,600).\r\n\r\n\"The miners, who watch what is going on, think this a good deal, and,\r\nas they have got nothing by way of profit, they protest and ask for a\r\nshare.\r\n\r\n\"'That, my friend, is impossible. The price of coal has fallen this\r\nyear, the price of man must come down in proportion. All I could do for\r\nyou is to reduce your wages. You object to that. All right; down the\r\nshaft you go: don't let us talk about it any more.'\r\n\r\n\"But the men won't go down.\r\n\r\n\"'You don't make money this year. All right. But when you made huge\r\nprofits, did you give us even the crumbs from your banquet?'\r\n\r\n\"'I wasn't a shareholder then; it was my father.'\r\n\r\n\"'_My_ father, like myself, was a miner. He died of consumption, his\r\nlungs choked with coal-dust. Now it is my turn to cough and spit black.\r\nAnd my wife, looking at her babes, asks herself whether I shall live\r\nlong enough for them to be old enough, before my death, to go down into\r\nthe mine which will kill them in turn. If I crack up too soon, misery,\r\nruin, beggary, wholesale wretchedness for wife and children.'\r\n\r\n\"They don't come to terms. The strike begins.\r\n\r\n\"Economists argue, to begin with, that the State has no right to\r\ninterfere in the relations between miners and mine-owners. The\r\nmine-owner is at home on his own property. Certain securities for life\r\nand limb may be demanded, nothing more. But no sooner does a strike\r\nbegin than the State, which five minutes ago had no right to interfere,\r\nis called upon to bring in horse, foot and artillery on the side of the\r\ncoal-owners. Then the miners have no rights left, and the judges decide\r\nagainst them on shameless pretexts and condemn them to prison, when\r\nthey cannot bear false witness in support of the police and military.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were Clemenceau's views on the right to strike and the grievances\r\nof the men, before he accepted the post of Minister of the Interior and\r\nbegan to deal with the troublous state of things at Courrières-Lens,\r\nwhere the terrible accident had occurred and a strike had been entered\r\nupon, while the entire district was in a state of mind bordering upon\r\nanarchist revolt.\r\n\r\nThe first step he took was as bold and as remarkable an act as any\r\nin the whole of his adventurous life. He went down at once to Lens\r\nhimself. Arrived there, he walked straight off, without any escort\r\nwhatever, to meet and confer with the committee of the miners\r\nthemselves. Courageous and honourable as this was, it failed at first\r\nto impress the strike committee. This was natural enough. They were\r\nlamenting the wholesale butchery of their comrades and were incensed\r\nagainst the employers who, with hundreds upon hundreds of dead pitmen\r\nbelow, would not deal fairly with the survivors. Clemenceau therefore\r\nmet with a very cool reception. But he was nothing daunted, and began\r\nto address them. Gradually, he convinced the committee that he meant\r\nfairly by the men, and that he had not come down, alone and unarmed as\r\nhe was, with any intention of suppressing the strike, but, so far as\r\nhe could, to see that they had the fairest of fair play, according to\r\ntheir rights under the law.\r\n\r\nThereupon, the committee agreed that Clemenceau should go with them\r\nto speak to a mass meeting of the miners. It was a doubtful venture,\r\nbut Clemenceau went. In the course of his speech he reassured the men\r\nupon the attitude of the Government as represented by himself. He\r\ntold them plainly: \"You are entitled to strike. You will be protected\r\nby the law in doing all which the law permits. Your rights are equal\r\nto the rights of President or Ministers. But the rights of others\r\nmust not be attacked. The mines must not be destroyed. For the first\r\ntime, you will see no soldiers in the street during the strike. True,\r\nsoldiers have been placed in the mines, but solely to protect them,\r\nnot in any way to injure you. On the other hand, you must not resort\r\nto violence yourselves. The strike can be carried on peacefully and\r\nwithout interference. Respect the mines upon which you depend for your\r\nlivelihood.\"\r\n\r\nThis was quite plain, and Clemenceau adhered to his own programme as\r\nhe had formulated it. But the difficulty was apparent from the first,\r\nand it is a difficulty which must always recur when a great strike\r\nis organised. If the State claims the right to intervene, in order\r\nto protect the laws and liberties of those who wish to work for the\r\nemployers, in spite of the strike and the decisions of the strikers,\r\nantagonism to such action is practically certain beforehand. For,\r\nin this case, as the strikers say, the State is using the forces of\r\nthe military and the police in order to protect \"blacklegs\" who, by\r\noffering their labour to the employers at such a time of acute class\r\nwar, act in the interests of the coal-owners and against the mass of\r\nthe workers. Socialists argue that the strikers are sound in their\r\ncontention, and that by assuring to non-strikers the right to work the\r\nGovernment practically nullifies the right to strike. When, therefore,\r\nin this typical Courrières case, the strikers as a whole remained out,\r\nnotwithstanding certain insufficient offers by the coal-owners, and a\r\nminority of non-strikers claimed the help of the law, with support\r\nof the State army, to weaken by their surrender the position of the\r\nmajority of their fellow-workers in the same industry, then the ethics\r\nof the dispute between sections of the miners could not be so easily\r\ndetermined as M. Clemenceau from his individualist training assumed.\r\n\r\nIf the employers were in the wrong, as it appears they were, then to\r\ncall out the military to protect those miners who showed themselves\r\nready to make immediate terms with injustice was, however good the\r\nintention, to take sides against the main body of the men. So it\r\nseemed to these latter. When, therefore, the soldiers defended the\r\nnon-strikers, the strikers assailed the military, who had not attacked\r\nthem. Clemenceau accordingly decided that the strikers had broken the\r\nlaw, as undoubtedly they had, by stoning and injuring the servants of\r\nthe State, who were upholding the law as it stood. The truth is that,\r\nso long as these antagonistic sections exist among the working class,\r\nand persist in fighting one another, it is practically impossible for\r\nthe State not to intervene in order to keep the peace. There may be\r\nno sympathy with blacklegs, but the Minister of the Interior could\r\nscarcely be blamed for protecting them against an infuriated mob, which\r\nwould probably have killed them, or for insisting upon the release of\r\nthose whom the strikers had seized. That the temper of the crowd had\r\nbecome highly dangerous was apparent a little later, when the Socialist\r\nMayor was knocked down as he was trying to calm them.\r\n\r\nAll this rendered M. Clemenceau's second and third visits to the scene\r\nof class warfare far more stormy than the first. Owing to the horror\r\nand hatred created by the avoidable holocaust in the Courrières mines,\r\nand the further discovery that engineers appointed by the State had\r\nplayed into the hands of the employers, the situation got worse from\r\nday to day. The strike itself was not only an effort to get more wages,\r\nbut a declaration of hostility to the mine-owners, and those of the\r\nminers' own class who showed any tenderness towards them, or were ready\r\nto take work under them. Their own leaders and representatives had\r\nno longer any influence with the men or control over them. M. Basly,\r\nthe deputy who acted throughout for the miners, had as little power\r\nover the strikers as anybody else. The whole movement was taking an\r\nanarchist turn. Also, agents were at work among them both from the\r\nreactionary and the revolutionary side whose main object, for very\r\ndifferent reasons, was to foster disturbance and influence passion.\r\nForeign emissaries likewise were said to be at work.\r\n\r\nClemenceau's task was therefore an exceedingly hard one. He had ever\r\nin mind the old eighteenth-century watchword which, from his point of\r\nview, is the foundation of the French Republic--Liberty, Equality and\r\nFraternity. And the greatest of these is liberty! He throughout forgot,\r\nor overlooked, that, even according to his own pronouncements, liberty\r\nin any real sense is impossible for the weaker--the majority who own no\r\nproperty--against the stronger--\"Les Plus Forts,\" the minority who own\r\nall the property. This triune fetish Clemenceau, with all his keenness\r\nof criticism, might be said to worship: yet to worship in a more or\r\nless reasonable way. He could not shut his eyes to the truth that, for\r\nmen and women whose livelihood was at the mercy of capitalists, there\r\ncould be no real liberty, dominated as the workers were by their daily\r\ncompulsion to obtain the wherewithal for the necessaries of life. The\r\nonly way by which even partial justice could be secured, under the\r\nsystem of payment of wages, was combination among the wage-earners.\r\nHence he recognises the liberty to strike. But he was equally\r\ndetermined, as he puts it, to defend the liberty of those who would not\r\nstrike. It was logical: it was in harmony with the law; but it was a\r\nvirtual help to the employers none the less.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of his second visit he enforced his view in his usual\r\nemphatic way. Three miners who would not join the strike were being\r\nparaded through the town by the strikers with an insulting placard hung\r\naround their necks: \"_Nous sommes des poires cuites; des faux frères._\"\r\nClemenceau insisted that they should be released, and succeeded in\r\nfreeing them. The very fact, however, that it was possible for the\r\nstrikers to act in this way, without protest, showed how small was the\r\nminority and how strong the feeling against these claimants of the\r\nliberty of taking the other side. Clemenceau likewise acted with vigour\r\nagainst all who were guilty of any violence. But the strikes still\r\nspread.\r\n\r\nSpeaking at Lyons on May 3rd, he explained the difficulties of the\r\nsituation:--\"My position is between the political demagogues of the\r\nChurch, the clericals and the reactionaries on one side, who tried\r\nhard to hound on the troops I was forced to call in to fire upon\r\nthe strikers, who greatly provoked them. This the ecclesiastics and\r\nrestorationists did with the hope of fomenting a revolt against the\r\nRepublic--a revolt supported by certain military chiefs, inspired by\r\nthe clericals and their shameless lack of discipline.\" The Separation\r\nof Church and State was being decided while all this was going on.\r\n\"Their object was to bring about a massacre in the interest of the\r\nCatholic Church and the monarchy. This plot was frustrated. Butchery\r\nwas avoided.\r\n\r\n\"On the other side, I am accused by the revolutionary Socialists of\r\nindulging in brutal military oppression because I suppress anarchist\r\nrioting. This though no striker was killed or wounded. I acted for\r\ntranquillity, while the monarchists fostered disturbances. They wanted\r\na Government of the Republic which should rely for support solely\r\non the Right. The anarchists helped the monarchists, who had agents\r\nthroughout the perturbed districts, by denouncing the Republic and\r\nexcusing mob violence. Yet how stood the case? Was it I who organised\r\na campaign of panic? Was it I who was responsible for the original\r\nexplosion and strike? Was it I who brought about the state of things\r\nwhich resulted in general disturbance and might have tended towards\r\nanother _coup d'état_? Nothing of the sort. I was suddenly called upon\r\nto deal with unexpected troubles. I acted for the maintenance of the\r\nRepublic, and kept the peace under the law.\"\r\n\r\nBy taking office at the time when he did it was at once apparent\r\nthat Clemenceau had brought himself into the full whirlpool of strike\r\ndifficulties which then arose. He was called upon to solve in everyday\r\nlife, as a man committed to a policy of justice to the workers,\r\nproblems which, at critical moments, are almost insoluble under the\r\ncapitalist system of wage-earning and production for profit. Has any\r\nsection of the community the right to hold up the life of a nation\r\nor a great city in order to secure advantages for itself? At first\r\nsight the answer would undoubtedly be \"No.\" But if the conditions of\r\nexistence for those who act in this way are admittedly such as ought\r\nnot to continue in any civilised country, it is not possible to reply\r\nso confidently in the negative. Neither can the \"No\" be repeated with\r\ncertainty when employers, or the State itself, are guilty of a direct\r\nbreach of faith towards the workers, unless, by ceasing to carry\r\nout their duties, they actually imperil the welfare of the entire\r\ncollectivity of which they form a part. In short, all depends upon the\r\ncircumstances, which have to be considered most carefully in each case.\r\nIt fell to Clemenceau's lot to decide in what might almost be taken as\r\nthe test incident--the strike of the electrical engineers and workers\r\nof Paris.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something in M. Clemenceau's horoscope which has\r\ndecreed that his career shall be diversified and rendered interesting\r\nby a series of dramatic events. This strike of the electricians of\r\nParis was certainly one of them.\r\n\r\nScene: Cabinet of the Minister of the Interior. The Minister, M.\r\nClemenceau, at work at his desk and dictating to his secretary.\r\nEverything going on quite nicely. No sign of more than ordinary\r\npressure. Electric light functioning as usual for the benefit of the\r\nRadical leader as well as for Parisians of every degree. Hey presto!\r\nDarkness falls upon the bureau of the Minister. Very provoking. What\r\nis the matter? Corridors and other bureaux suffering the like eclipse.\r\nEvidently something wrong at the main. Candles obtained, lamps got out\r\nfrom dusty cupboards, oil hunted up. Ancient forms of illumination\r\napplied. Darkness thus made visible. Telephones set going. All Paris\r\nobscured. A city of two or three millions of inhabitants suddenly\r\ndeprived of light. What has happened? The entire electrical service\r\ndisorganised until to-morrow by the sudden and unexpected strike of the\r\nwhole of the skilled men in the electrical supply department. Lovers\r\nof darkness because their deeds are evil likely to have a good time.\r\nBusiness arrested, fathers and mothers of families perturbed. Dangers\r\nof every sort threatened. Apaches and other cut-throats preparing for\r\naction in the to them providential enactment of endless gloom.\r\n\r\nSuch is the baleful news borne over the telephone wires to the much\r\ntroubled Minister of the Interior, with his wax tapers and old-world\r\nlamps glimmering around him. How preserve his Paris, his _ville\r\nlumière_, from the depredations of the miscreants engendered by the\r\nsocial system of the day, when light fails to disclose their approach?\r\nHow protect the savings of the conscientious bourgeois and the diamonds\r\nof the high-placed _horizontale_ from removal and conveyance under\r\ncover of the night? To surrender to the strikers is to admit their\r\nright as a few to blackmail the many. It is to sanctify the action of\r\nthe despoiling minority above by giving way to the organised minority\r\nbelow. Immediate decision is essential. Night is upon us, when no man\r\ncan work, save the man who communises movable property to his own use.\r\nLight is a necessary of security for property, nay, even for life. The\r\nState must come in to fulfil the functions which the Creator neglected\r\nto provide for when He divided the night from the day. The sapper is\r\nthe man to supplement the deficiencies of Providence and to mitigate\r\nthe social revolution by electrical engineers. _Rien n'est sacré pour\r\nun sapeur!_ No sooner thought of but acted upon. M. Clemenceau, as\r\nMinister of the Interior and trustee for the well-being of the citizens\r\nof Paris, calls upon the State engineers under military control to\r\nlight up Paris afresh. The thing is done. Paris sees more clearly and\r\nbreathes more freely. Society itself has the right to live.\r\n\r\nBut stay a moment: here is M. Jaurès. He has a word to say. What are\r\nyou doing, M. Clemenceau? You are outraging all your own principles.\r\nYou are interfering with that very right to strike which you yourself\r\nhave declared to be sacred. You are using the military discipline of\r\nthe comrades of the men out on strike against the electrical companies,\r\nto render their protest nugatory, by employing the sappers against\r\nthem. You have, in fact, called out the powers of the State to crush\r\nthe workers in a particular industry. If you were true to yourself,\r\nyou would convert the electrical supply of Paris now in the hands of\r\ngreedy monopolists into a public service, and give the strikers every\r\nsatisfaction. That is the only real solution of social anarchy.\r\n\r\nTo him Clemenceau: \"But this was not merely a strike or a limited\r\nliability class war against employers. It was a bitter fight between\r\ntwo irreconcilable antagonists against inoffensive passers-by. The\r\npeople of Paris, for whom I am concerned, had nothing to do with the\r\nmatter. I myself knew nothing about the decision to strike till my own\r\nwork was rendered impossible by the sudden infliction of darkness upon\r\nme by these resuscitated Joshuas. Not only was the general security\r\nthreatened, as I have declared, but the lives of your own clients,\r\nJaurès, were threatened by immersion in a flood below ground. The\r\ninundation of the Metropolitan (the Underground Railway) had already\r\nbegun. The workers of Paris who used that means of communication in\r\norder to return to their work would most certainty have been drowned\r\nowing to the suspension of electrical pumps and lifts, had not the\r\nsappers and the firemen, both of them sets of public functionaries,\r\nrushed at once to the rescue. Were the workmen of Paris engaged in\r\nother departments to be allowed to perish, with the State standing\r\nby, wringing its hands in hopeless ineptitude, while the electrical\r\nengineers got the better of their masters in a dispute about wages?\r\nThis was a practical question which I had to decide at once. I decided\r\nin favour of the inoffensive people of Paris and against the electrical\r\nengineers on strike.\"\r\n\r\nTaking a wide view of the whole question, I hold Jaurès's opinion\r\nto be the right one. But Clemenceau had to deal with an immediate\r\npractical difficulty of a very serious kind indeed. The lights went\r\nout at six o'clock. Night was coming on. No time could be lost in\r\nnegotiating with the engineers. Still less was nightfall the period\r\nwhen a public service could be instituted in hot haste. The matter\r\nwas settled in that form and for that occasion. But none the less\r\nthe real point at issue was not thus easily disposed of. Clemenceau\r\nwas right in preventing Paris from being left all night in darkness.\r\nJaurès was right in claiming that the State should have a more definite\r\nand consistent policy than that of dealing with differences between\r\nwage-earners and employers by such hand-to-mouth methods.\r\n\r\nIt was just at this point that, notwithstanding all adverse criticisms\r\nin regard to the instability of Ministries, and the scenes of apparent\r\ndisorder which sometimes arise, the French National Assembly displayed\r\nits immense superiority to the Parliaments of other countries when\r\nserious matters of principle were involved. The desire to get to the\r\nbottom of a really dangerous question, to hear the arguments on both\r\nsides taken, as far as possible, out of the narrow limits of personal\r\nor party politics, puts the French Assembly on a very high level.\r\nFrom the point of view of economic development France is far behind\r\nGreat Britain, America and Germany. The great factory industry and the\r\nlegislation growing out of it are not nearly so far advanced. But, in\r\nthe wish and endeavour to investigate the principles upon which the\r\nfuture regulation of society must proceed, France gives the lead.\r\n\r\nThis openness of mind and anxiety to let both views have fair play\r\nhave grown under the Republic in a wonderful way. Where else in the\r\nworld would men of all parties and all sections allow the two chief\r\norators of the Left--Jaurès, the Socialist leader of the opposition,\r\nClemenceau, the Individualist Minister--to debate out at length,\r\nin two long sittings, the issues between genuine Socialism and\r\nthat nondescript reformist Collectivism which goes by the name of\r\nSocialistic Radicalism: the latter really meaning, to Socialists,\r\ncapitalism palliated by State bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a great oratorical duel, and those who contend that\r\noratory has lost its significance and virtue in modern times would\r\nhave to admit that they were wrong, not only in this particular case,\r\nbut in regard to other speeches delivered by the two chief disputants\r\nafterwards. The debate itself was a contrast between styles just as it\r\nwas a conflict of principles. Jaurès was an orator of great power and\r\nwonderful capacity for stirring the emotions. His voice, his face, his\r\ngestures, his method of argument and fusing of forcible contentions\r\ninto one compact whole made so great an impression that he could\r\ncapture a large audience with the same ease, even on subjects remote\r\nfrom the immediate matter of his address--as once he held the Assembly\r\nentranced by a long digression on music in the course of a fine speech\r\non the tendencies of the time.\r\n\r\nIf it might be urged that he occasionally used too many words to\r\nexpress his meaning, this was easily forgiven by his countrymen, on\r\naccount of his admirable turn of phrase and his understanding use of\r\nthe modulations of the French language. However prejudiced his hearers\r\nmight be against him (and his personal appearance was not such as to\r\ndisarm an opponent), they had only to listen to Jaurès for ten minutes\r\nto feel interested in what he had to say. From this to admiration and\r\nexcitement was no long step. Short, stout and somewhat cumbrous in\r\nfigure, wearing trousers nearly halfway up his calves, with a broad,\r\nhumorous, rather coarse face, his eyes full of expression and not\r\nwanting in fun, troubled with a curious twitching on the right cheek\r\nwhich affected his eye with a sort of wink, Jaurès was certainly not\r\nthe personality anyone would have fixed upon as the greatest master\r\nof idealist and economic Socialist oratory in France, and perhaps\r\nin Europe. But his sincerity, his eloquence soon overcame these\r\ndrawbacks on the platform and in the tribune, just as his bonhomie\r\nand good-fellowship did in private life. He had been a Professor\r\nof Literature in the University of Toulouse, and was a man of wide\r\ncultivation. But his learning never made him pedantic, nor did his\r\ngreat success turn his head. Gifted with extraordinary vitality, his\r\npowers of work were quite phenomenal. To say that he \"toiled like\r\na galley-slave,\" for the cause to which he devoted himself, was no\r\nexaggeration. Yet he was always fresh, always in good spirits, always\r\nready to contribute wit and vivacity to any company in which he found\r\nhimself. Add to this much practical good sense in the conduct of his\r\nparty and the affairs of the world, and all must admit that in Jaurès\r\nthe Socialist party of France had a worthy chief and Clemenceau a\r\nworthy antagonist. The galleries, like the Assembly itself, were always\r\ncrowded when either orator was expected to address the House.\r\n\r\nJaurès dealt with the development of society from the chaos of\r\nconflicting classes and mutual antagonisms to the co-ordination of\r\ncommon effort for the common good. This can and should be a peaceful\r\nsocial evolution. Property for all means a universal share, not only in\r\npolitics, but in the production and the distribution of wealth. This\r\ncould not be obtained under the conditions of to-day, where those who\r\npossessed no property but the labour in their bodies were at the mercy\r\nof the classes who possessed all else; where only by strikes in which\r\nthe State took the side of the employers could the wage-earners obtain\r\nan infinitesimal portion of their rights. By collectivism, leading up\r\nto Socialism and general co-operation, every individual would have a\r\ndirect interest in and be benefited by the general social increase of\r\nwealth, due to the growing powers of man to produce what is useful and\r\nbeneficial to all.\r\n\r\nSocialism substitutes order for anarchy, joint action of every member\r\nof society for the mutual antagonism which is now the rule. Legal\r\nexpropriation with compensation will gradually put the community\r\nin control of its own resources. Our task is to convince the small\r\nproprietor and the small bourgeoisie that they will benefit by the\r\ncoming transformation. Incessant social reform on Socialist lines would\r\nlead to the realisation of Socialist ideals in a practical shape. Such\r\nstrikes as that at Courrières, followed by the military intervention\r\nof the State, at M. Clemenceau's direction, and repression of the\r\nstrikers, displayed the injustice of the existing system and proclaimed\r\nthe necessity for accepting the higher view of social duty by which all\r\nwould benefit and none would suffer.\r\n\r\nThe speech thus briefly summarised was delivered at two sittings of the\r\nChamber, and was listened to with profound attention by those present,\r\nthe great majority of whom were directly opposed to Socialist views. No\r\nhigher tribute could have been paid.\r\n\r\nClemenceau rose to reply to the Socialist leader a few days later.\r\nTwenty years had passed over his head since I last described his\r\npersonal appearance, his vigorous individuality and his incisive,\r\nclear-cut, witty conversation and oratory. Time had affected him\r\nlittle. He was still the same energetic and determined but ordinarily\r\ncool political fighter that he had shown himself in the eighties of\r\nthe last century. His head was now bald, and his moustache grey, but\r\nhis eyes looked out from under the heavy white eyebrows with all the\r\nold fire, and the alertness of his frame was apparent in his every\r\nmovement. Though many years older than his Socialist challenger, there\r\nwas nothing to choose between them in regard to physical and mental\r\nvigour. Jaurès had been eloquent and persuasive; he brought in the\r\nideals and the strategy of the future to illuminate the sad truths\r\nof the present. He relied upon the history of the past and the hopes\r\nof humanity ahead to constitute a policy of preparation for coming\r\ngenerations of Frenchmen, while applying the principles he advocated,\r\nas far as possible, to the events of the day. Clemenceau confined his\r\nanswer, which also extended over two sittings of the Chamber, to the\r\nmatters immediately in hand and the criticisms on his method of dealing\r\nwith them. This sense of practicality, not devoid of sympathy with the\r\ndisinherited classes of our day, gave the Minister of the Interior a\r\ngreat advantage and precisely suited his style. The interval between\r\nthe two speeches also told in favour of Clemenceau. The ring of\r\nJaurès's fine sentences had died down in the meantime. His glorious\r\naspirations were discounted hour by hour by the continuance of the\r\nconflict, whose existence he himself could not but admit, which formed,\r\nin fact, part of his case, and in a way strengthened his indictment.\r\nYet this had to be dealt with all the same.\r\n\r\nClemenceau began his oration with a glowing tribute to Jaurès's passion\r\nfor social justice. But his magnificent eloquence has eliminated the\r\nwhole of the bad side of life. He rises to the empyrean, whence he\r\nsurveys creation through a roseate atmosphere which is raised far above\r\nplain facts. \"For myself, I am compelled to remain in the valley where\r\nall the events which Jaurès leaves out of his picture are actually\r\ntaking place. That accounts for the difference in our perspective.\r\nI am accused of attacking the workers and of doing worse than other\r\nGovernments. I have never attacked the workers, I have never done\r\nthem wrong. The duty of the Government is to maintain tranquillity.\r\nThis I have done without injury to the toilers, though I had to face\r\n85,000 strikers in the Pas de Calais and 115,000 in Paris--the largest\r\nnumber ever known on strike at the same time in France. I went down to\r\nCourrières to ensure liberty. We have all of us here to go through our\r\neducation in Liberty. Education is not a matter of words, but of deeds.\r\nThose deeds form part of the education. The working classes become\r\nworthy of taking over the responsibility of Government for themselves\r\nwhen their own deeds are in accordance with the law. If speeches alone\r\ncould teach administration, the Sermon on the Mount would have dictated\r\npractical politics for centuries.\r\n\r\n\"In these disturbances my orders, issued through the highest police\r\nauthorities, were precise. Maintain, I said, Liberty to strike, liberty\r\nto work. Soldiers to be called in only in case of actual violence.\r\nBut the miners themselves infringed the liberties of others. They\r\nindulged in the anarchical wrecking of houses belonging to men of\r\ntheir own class. I have here photographs of the destruction wrought.\r\nWere Monsieur Jaurès Minister of the Interior--misfortune comes so\r\nsuddenly--he himself would send down troops to stop wholesale pillage.\r\nYet, if he did, he would in turn be denounced, by the anarchist heads\r\nof the General Confederation of Labour, as the enemy of the class\r\nwhose cause he now champions. I challenge M. Jaurès to say what he\r\nwould do under such circumstances as I have had to face\"--the orator\r\npauses and waits. There is dead silence. No answer. \"By not replying,\r\nyou have replied. There have, I repeat, been no dead or wounded among\r\nthe working class. On May 1st, when general disorders were openly\r\nthreatened, I took precautions against organised outbreak. No trouble\r\narose.\"\r\n\r\nThe Republic, he continued, was a rule of freedom for the individual,\r\nso far as it could be secured under existing conditions. Those\r\nconditions and the law itself might work injustice, but it was then\r\nthe duty of the State, and the Minister who had to translate its\r\nfunctions into action, to mitigate such harshness by protecting the\r\nweaker side. Soldiers had been sent down to Courrières not to attack\r\nthe strikers--no attack had been made upon them--but to prevent the\r\nstrikers themselves from destroying the mines and inflicting illegal\r\npunishments upon those of their class who did not agree with them. When\r\nthis was done, the strikers molested the soldiers, who never fired a\r\nshot. The lieutenant in command was assailed, though his sabre remained\r\nall the time in its sheath. The right of men to work on terms they\r\nthemselves are willing to accept could not be contested as the law now\r\nstood. \"But, says M. Jaurès, by assuring non-strikers the right to\r\nwork, I myself am violating the right to strike, which I have declared\r\nto be the inalienable privilege of the wage-earners. But then, I ask,\r\nwhat are the non-strikers to do? They also have wives and children\r\nwho demand to be fed. What law justifies me in preventing them from\r\nworking? Republicanism means the right of the individual to combine\r\nwith others to resist oppression and obtain advantages. This freedom\r\nis admitted. It does not include the freedom to oppress others, still\r\nless to assault servants of the State, who are acting in order to\r\nsafeguard the law as it stands. When the Socialists of M. Jaurès's\r\nschool begin to deal with facts, and not with ideals at present all in\r\nthe air, what sort of programme do they formulate?\r\n\r\n\"Here we have it. An eight-hours working day for all trades. The\r\nright of State Employees to form Trade Unions and to strike.\r\nProportional Representation. A progressive Income Tax, and so on. A\r\nnice little programme, but a bourgeois programme all the same. No\r\nidealism, no Socialism there! M. Jaurès, however, claims the immediate\r\nNationalisation and Socialisation of all departments of industry,\r\nincluding the land. But such unification of society is in reality the\r\nCatholicisation of Society. There is a definite programme of Radical\r\nReforms, nevertheless, constituting an advance towards a Socialist\r\npolicy. They are formulated by the bourgeoisie, but Socialists threaten\r\nto vote against the Budget, which is necessary in order to carry out\r\nsome of their own proposals. Take Old Age Pensions. These need money.\r\nThe Socialists refuse the required funds. Yet Socialists are for the\r\nRepublic. So far we cordially agree. So far I, of necessity, work\r\nwith them. But if they at the same time denounce Republicans as the\r\nenemies of the workers and secure a majority of votes in that sense,\r\nthen that is to vote for the defeat of the Republic. If Socialists\r\nwould work with the Radicals, in order to attain the ends they have in\r\ncommon, none would be more glad than I. But if such common action is\r\nimpossible, then let each work on in their own way.\"\r\n\r\nIt was said at the time that at the close of the debate, when\r\nClemenceau was leaving the Assembly, he remarked to Jaurès, \"After all,\r\nJaurès, you are not the good God.\" To which Jaurès replied: \"And you\r\nare not even the Devil.\"\r\n\r\nI have dealt with this famous controversy at some length, without\r\nattempting to give the speeches in full, because, although the\r\ndiscussion led to no decision at the moment, it certainly brought\r\nbefore the public of France and even the public opinion of Europe\r\nthe direct theoretical and practical difference between Socialism and\r\nwell-meaning Radicalism, in an intelligible manner, as nothing else\r\nwould. The effect upon French politics within the next few months, in\r\nspite of further desperate outbreaks in 1907, was also remarkable.\r\nJaurès's speech did much to consolidate the Socialist Party as a\r\nunified section of the Chamber; and Clemenceau himself was so far\r\ninfluenced by it and by the trend of events that, as will be seen,\r\nit affected his policy as Prime Minister in the formation of his own\r\nCabinet shortly afterwards. Looking at the matter from the Socialist\r\npoint of view, therefore, Jaurès was building better than his opponents\r\nin the Chamber knew, and Socialists had no reason to regret the\r\napparent victory of his formidable antagonist at the time. In fact, as\r\nBernard Shaw said in regard to a very different debate under widely\r\ndifferent circumstances in London more than thirty years before: \"The\r\nSocialist was playing at longer bowls than you know.\"\r\n\r\nIt is this power of detachment, this recognition that theory and\r\nsentiment play a great part in the moulding of public character and\r\npublic opinion, even in the practical affairs of everyday life, that\r\nrenders France--independent, idealist, revolutionist, conservative\r\nand thrifty France--so essential a factor in the discussion of the\r\nworld-problems of to-day. France alone among the nations rises above\r\nthe smoke of class warfare; and though her own social and economic\r\nconditions are not themselves ready for the definite solution of social\r\nproblems, she indicates the route which may be most safely followed\r\nby countries more economically advanced. Both Jaurès and Clemenceau,\r\ntherefore, rendered good service to mankind when they used their utmost\r\nefforts to place before the peoples and the students of all nations\r\nthe views of the Socialist, with his outlook on the future, and the\r\nRadical, with his policy of the present based on the traditions of\r\nthe past. Jaurès, in the prime of his manhood and the fullness of\r\nhis fame, was torn from the useful and noble work which lay well\r\nwithin his power and his intelligence by the murderous revolver of a\r\nreactionary assassin: a loss indeed to his party, his country, and the\r\nworld at large! His antagonist, Clemenceau, still works on as nearly\r\nan octogenarian, with all the vigour and energy of his fiery youth,\r\non behalf of that France, who, to-day, as for many a long year past,\r\nhas been the mistress and the goddess of the materialist democrat and\r\nRadical champion of the people.\r\n\r\nOn October 23rd, after six months of service as Minister of the\r\nInterior, Clemenceau was called back from Carlsbad, whither he went\r\nevery year before the war to conjure attacks of gout (which might at\r\nleast, in all reason, have spared a lifelong teetotaller), in order\r\nto form a Cabinet of his own in place of M. Sarrien. That Cabinet was\r\nremarkable from many points of view. Comments upon its constitution\r\nand significance may be reserved for a wider survey. Suffice it to say\r\nhere that Clemenceau himself, in addition to holding the Presidency of\r\nthe Council as Prime Minister, remained Minister of the Interior, thus\r\ndeclaring his intention not to shirk any of the responsibility he had\r\ntaken upon himself or the animosity he had incurred in his dealings\r\nwith strikes and other social questions.\r\n\r\nFrance was passing through a very difficult period. Whatever view a\r\nthoroughgoing Socialist may take as to the need for a wider general\r\npolicy than that adopted by Clemenceau, it is not easy to see how, the\r\nFrench people being unprepared to accept a purely Labour or Socialist\r\nGovernment, the Republic could have been peacefully maintained, but\r\nfor the cool determination of the Radical Republican at the head\r\nof affairs. Scarcely a day passed without some fresh economic and\r\nsocial conflicts that called for prompt action. These, however, arose\r\nin provinces and cities and under conditions where the antagonism\r\nbetween wage-earners and employers, between capital and labour, in\r\nthe ordinary way offered no exceptional features for the statesman.\r\nBut in the spring and summer of 1907 a more complicated and dangerous\r\nuprising, which developed into little short of an attempt at an\r\nAnarchist-communist, anti-Republican revolution, broke out in the South\r\nof France among the wine-growers.\r\n\r\nThe peasants of the districts round Narbonne and Montpellier, together\r\nwith many of the inhabitants of those towns, who were themselves\r\ndependent upon the wine industry, made, in fact, a desperate local\r\nattack upon the existing Government of France. Disaffection had\r\nbeen growing for a long time and was due to a series of economic\r\nand agricultural troubles among the wine-growers, which successive\r\nMinistries had not understood, far less attempted to cope with. It had\r\nits direct origin in a natural cause. This cause was the appearance in\r\nthe Bordeaux country of the deadly enemy of all _vignerons_, large and\r\nsmall--the much-dreaded phylloxera. The vineyards of the Gironde were\r\ndevastated and the famous clarets shipped from Bordeaux ceased to be\r\nthe product of Bordeaux grapes. Thereupon the inferior vintages of the\r\nMidi came into abnormal demand. But the wine-producers of the West were\r\nnot wholly defeated, even while the phylloxera continued his ravages\r\nand no method of checking the mischief had been discovered. There are\r\nways and means of meeting even such a calamity.\r\n\r\n\"Would your lordship like madeira served with that course?\" said a\r\nbutler to a well-known bishop who was giving a dinner, in days long\r\nbefore the war, to a number of his clergy. \"Madeira!\" was the reply, in\r\ngreat surprise. \"Why, I have not a single bottle in my cellar.\" \"Oh,\r\nyes, my lord, you have. _Monseigneur oublie peut-être que je suis de\r\nCette._\" Madeira, so the story goes, was duly served. But Cette is not\r\nthe only town in France where the art of blending and refining wine\r\nfor foreign and even home palates has been brought to a high pitch. At\r\nany rate, during the phylloxera period, Australian, Algerian, Spanish\r\nand other wines, which previously had been regarded contemptuously by\r\nforeign and French consumers of claret, were, it was alleged, imported\r\nat Bordeaux in great quantity and came out again with the old familiar\r\nBordeaux labels and duly impressed corks.\r\n\r\nThus adulteration, which John Bright declared was a legitimate form\r\nof competition, made its appearance in a widely different industry\r\nfrom his own, to the detriment, even thus early in the struggle, of\r\nthe legitimate growers of more acid but more genuine beverages in the\r\nSouth. Adulteration became a war-cry among the peasants, who felt\r\nthemselves defrauded. Republicans of great commercial reputation and\r\nhigh standing in finance were accused, rightly or wrongly, of being\r\ndeeply and profitably concerned in this nefarious traffic. That was\r\nall bad enough. But, at last, a remedy for the vineyard plague was\r\ndiscovered and widely used, with the aid of the Government, partly by\r\nchemical applications to the vines, partly by bringing in new stocks\r\nfrom without. Then followed exceptionally good vintages in the Bordeaux\r\ncountry, while the adulteration, falsification, manipulation of other\r\nwines with sugar and the like continued. Hence an abnormal glut of wine\r\nof every degree, with a corresponding fall in price.\r\n\r\nThe peasants, whose views of the admirable law of supply and demand\r\nwere very crude, only discovered that the more wine they produced the\r\nless money could they get for it! To produce for the consumer, at a\r\nloss to themselves, at once struck them as an unfair dispensation in\r\nthe order of the market, since it affected the sales of their wines.\r\nObviously, they said, the Government was to blame. How could they pay\r\ntaxes when wine was fetching a derisory price? Why should they borrow\r\nto pay taxes when wine was fetching a derisory price? Let Government\r\ntake short order with the adulterators and big producers out there in\r\nthe West, who were preventing the hard-working toilers on the soil in\r\nthe South from disposing of their sole saleable product at a profit.\r\nA Republic which couldn't protect the backbone of the nation, the\r\nSouthern wine-growers, to wit, was of no use to them. And the people\r\nof the South, as M. Clemenceau knows very well, for he is Senator for\r\nthe Var, are a vivacious and an excitable folk. But their vivacity\r\nand excitement had already been worked up to a high pitch by gradual\r\nexasperation before M. Clemenceau himself took office. It was his hard\r\nfate to meet the full fury of the storm as Premier of France.\r\n\r\nNo trifling storm it was. The whole countryside, in the late spring and\r\nsummer, was aflame. Commune after commune, district after district,\r\ntook part in the agitation. Peasants and _prolétaires_ made common\r\ncause against the authorities. Taxes should not be paid. Tax-gatherers\r\nshould appear at their peril. The Government was an unjust Government,\r\nand should be defied. And it was so. Meetings were held in every town\r\nand village. Capable representatives and leaders, of whom a M. Albert\r\nwas the chief, were chosen by the men themselves. Attempts to confer\r\nwith the people as a whole resulted in failure. The old story was told\r\nagain. The reactionaries of the Right took the side of the people, and\r\nshouted against \"adulteration,\" because they were victims of a chaotic\r\neconomic system, because also they objected to the use of troops, who\r\nbelonged to and were paid by the whole people, in order to maintain\r\nthat system in full vigour. What was to be done? Things got worse\r\nand worse. The Minister of the Interior felt obliged to call out the\r\ntroops in order to prevent downright ruin being wrought in Narbonne,\r\nMontpellier and St. Béziers. There were killed and wounded on both\r\nsides. Hence a serious ministerial crisis was threatened which, as\r\nmatters stood, could scarcely fail to tell in favour of reaction and\r\nagainst the only Republic then possible.\r\n\r\nThe facts were beyond dispute. In consequence of the causes and results\r\nsummarised, the temper of the people became unmanageable. There were\r\nterrible riots of a wholly anarchist character. The doors of public\r\nbuildings were soaked with kerosene and then set on fire. At Narbonne,\r\nMontpellier and St. Béziers attacks were made on peaceful citizens\r\nat dead of night by uncontrolled mobs of armed men recruited from\r\nthe worst members of the population. Soldiers on the spot refused to\r\nfire in reply to revolver shots aimed at them. The provocations to\r\nthe troops, who were brought in solely to maintain order, were almost\r\nintolerable, but they were borne with heroic calm. At first they fired\r\nin the air. Then they fired in earnest, and there were killed and\r\nwounded on both sides. Hence there was the greatest excitement in the\r\nChamber and unrest throughout Paris, where the wildest rumours were\r\nspread.\r\n\r\nEverything pointed to a serious political upset when Clemenceau rose to\r\ngive an account of the circumstances and to defend the action of the\r\nGovernment. This is, in brief, what he said: \"I did my best to avoid\r\nsending troops, and directed that they should not be used except in\r\ncase of absolute necessity. But can a Government allow a wine-growers'\r\ncommittee to forbid the villagers to pay taxes? Can it quietly permit\r\ntax-collectors to be molested when they arrive in the communes? Can\r\nit look on with indifference while 300 mayors of communes declare\r\na general strike and hold up the entire business of the community?\r\nEverywhere the committees of the wine-growers took upon themselves\r\nto give their orders in place of the constituted authority, and were\r\nobeyed. Soldiers who mutinied against their officers were applauded\r\nand a large sum was raised for their compensation. No Government could\r\nstand that. Citizens were bound to pay their taxes. No Minister can\r\ndeny that. I could have resigned. I do not want office. But I felt it\r\nmy duty to remain when the troops were attacked.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this speech the ministerial crisis ended. The difficulties on\r\nthe spot slowly calmed down, owing largely to the good sense and\r\nloyalty to the Republic of M. Albert and other leaders of the men. But\r\nthe Socialists have never forgiven M. Clemenceau for calling in the\r\nmilitary at Courrières and Narbonne, and particularly for the bloodshed\r\nat the latter town. This has been a great misfortune for both sides,\r\nthe rather that both could plead justification for the course they\r\ntook. The Socialists contended that the troubles arose in the North\r\nand in the South from causes whose development the Government ought to\r\nhave watched and whose results it should have foreseen. The State ought\r\nto have made ready, and introduced adequate legislation to encounter\r\nand overcome these troubles by peaceful methods, which all governments\r\nhave, or ought to have, at their command. Clemenceau could and did\r\nanswer that he was in no wise to be held responsible personally for\r\noutbreaks which had arisen from circumstances over which he had no\r\ncontrol, and that all he had to do was to prevent any mistakes that\r\nhad been made from leading to violent action that must harm innocent\r\npersons and injure the Republic. The split between Radicals and\r\nSocialists remains unbridged to this day.\r\n\r\nYet in the Senate on more than one occasion in 1906 Clemenceau,\r\ninterrupting a speaker, declared: \"I claim to be a Socialist!\" And\r\nagain, \"When I accepted the offer to form a Government I conceived\r\nthe idea of governing in a Socialist sense. Years ago I offered to\r\nco-operate with M. Jules Guesde to carry Socialist measures on which\r\nwe mutually agreed.\" This has never been denied. It ought to have been\r\npossible to come to terms on palliative measures at least.\r\n\r\nFor the strike difficulties did not end in 1906 and 1907, nor did\r\nClemenceau change his policy in dealing with them. Non-strikers were\r\nalways to be protected against strikers: anything in the shape of\r\nviolence on the part of strikers, no matter how great the provocation,\r\nwas to be repressed by the forces of the State. Also civil servants,\r\nbeing the servants of the State, were not to be allowed to combine\r\nin trade unions against the State as employer. Still less could\r\nClemenceau allow them the right to strike against the State. They then\r\nbecame, as he expressed it, \"rebellious bureaucrats,\" allied with\r\nthose who would like to destroy \"_la Patrie_.\" To them the amnesty\r\ngranted to the rebellious wine-growers and rural anarchists of the\r\nSouth must be denied. Civil servants in revolt and the bigots of\r\nanti-militarism--Hervé was at this time an ardent peace-at-any-price\r\nman and fanatical anti-militarist--were guilty of a crime against their\r\ncountry; and with such criminals the Government was engaged in battle.\r\n\r\nOnce more an actual strike close to Paris gave point to all these\r\ndeclarations, and put Clemenceau and his Government again at variance\r\nwith the Socialists by the acute difference of principle which was\r\nthen accentuated in practice. This was at Vigneux, when there was a\r\nstrike of the workers in the sand-pits. Clemenceau, who was still\r\nMinister of the Interior as well as Prime Minister, used the gendarmes\r\nto protect the non-strikers or blacklegs still working in the pits. As\r\na result, there was open conflict between the two sides. Two of the men\r\non strike were killed, and several of the gendarmes were injured. This\r\naroused great indignation against the Government among the organised\r\nworkers. They felt that the right to strike became illusory, if, at\r\nany moment, the Ministry could turn the scale against the strikers, no\r\nmatter how great their grievances or how just their claims might be, by\r\nbringing in the State to uphold the minority of the men in standing by\r\nthe masters.\r\n\r\nIn practice, as has often been found in England, such intervention on\r\nbehalf of the blacklegs means that the strike may be broken in the\r\ninterest of the capitalists. The deputies of the places where the\r\nstrikes took place interviewed Clemenceau on the matter. It is clear\r\nthat the antagonism went very deep. In answer to a bitter attack\r\nClemenceau again defended his action in the Chamber. The question was\r\none not of mere opinion, but of justice. \"When the workers are in\r\nthe wrong they must be told the truth about it. The Government will\r\nnever approve of anarchy.\" (\"You are anarchy enthroned yourself,\"\r\ncried Jaurès.) \"My programme is Social Reform under the law against\r\ngrievances, and Social Order under the law against the revolutionists.\"\r\nFinally, the National Assembly passed a vote of confidence in\r\nClemenceau as against the Socialists. That, of course, was to be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nI have given a fairly detailed account of these affrays--they were no\r\nless--between Clemenceau and the Socialists because they are of great\r\nimportance, not only as explaining the vehement hostility which has\r\nsince existed between them, but because the points at issue affect\r\nevery civilised country to a greater or less degree. Capital and\r\nlabour, capitalists and wage-earners, are at variance everywhere. Their\r\nantagonism can no more be averted or bridged over than could the class\r\nstruggle between land and slave-owners and their chattel slaves, or\r\nthe nobles and their serfs. Only the slow process of social evolution\r\nleading up to revolution can solve the problem. Meanwhile, combination\r\non the one side is met by combination on the other. Outside political\r\naction, which is ineffective until the workers themselves understand\r\nhow to use it, there is no weapon for the wage-earners or wage-slaves\r\nbut the strike. They suffer, even when they win, far more than the\r\ncapitalists or employers, who are only deprived of the right to make\r\nprofits out of their hands, while those same hands are undergoing the\r\npangs of hunger and every sort of privation, not only for themselves\r\nbut for their wives and children.\r\n\r\nArbitration, when the social conditions have reached the stage where\r\nthis is feasible, may postpone the crucial battle and smooth over the\r\nmatter temporarily; but it can do no more than that. A step towards\r\nthis arbitration was made under M. Millerand's measure declaring\r\nstrikes illegal unless decreed by a majority of the employees upon\r\na referendum, and the enactment of an arbitration clause. But when\r\nstrikes actually take place and the men's blood is up, then comes the\r\nreal tug-of-war.\r\n\r\nShould the State--obviously the capitalist State to-day--interfere to\r\nkeep order and maintain the right to work for non-strikers, or should\r\nit refrain from interference altogether? When Jaurès and the Socialists\r\nwere challenged to say what they would do under the circumstances,\r\nthey failed to answer, as already recorded. This put them in a weak\r\nposition. An opposition must have a policy which it would be prepared\r\nto act upon if it took office. Socialism, however desirable, could\r\nnot be realised all at once. But it was open to Clemenceau, as to any\r\nother Minister entrusted with full powers by the State, _to bring at\r\nleast as much pressure to bear upon the capitalists and employers\r\nas upon the strikers_, and to insist that they should yield to the\r\ndemands of the men and continue to work the mines, out of which, by the\r\npurchase of the labour-power of the pitmen, they had derived such huge\r\nprofits. This course was not adopted by the Minister of the Interior,\r\nnor does it seem to have been demanded by Jaurès. The troubles in the\r\nwine districts arose from different economic causes, and had to be\r\ndealt with in a different way. But the truth is that, in periods of\r\ntransition, no Government can go right. It was Clemenceau's lot to have\r\nto govern at such a period of transition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                  STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF CLEMENCEAU\r\n\r\n\r\nStrikes and anarchist troubles, however, formidable as they were in the\r\nNorth and in the South, were by no means the only serious difficulties\r\nwhich Clemenceau had to cope with, first as Minister of the Interior\r\nand then as Premier. The danger from Germany, as he well knew, was\r\never present. Anxious as France was to avoid misunderstandings which\r\nmight easily lead to war, eager as the Radical leader might be to\r\nenlarge upon the folly and wickedness of strife between two contiguous\r\ncivilised peoples, who could do so much for one another, it was always\r\npossible for the German Government to put the Republic in such a\r\nposition that the alternative of humiliation or hostilities must be\r\nfaced. Less than a year before Clemenceau accepted office, the German\r\nKaiser himself had taken a most provocative step in Morocco, the object\r\nof which can now be clearly seen. Germany had no real interests in\r\nMorocco worthy of the name. Several years later the German Minister of\r\nForeign Affairs pooh-poohed the idea that Germany, distant from Morocco\r\nas she was, with only 200 Germans in the country, and not more than\r\n£200,000 worth of yearly commerce, all told, with the inhabitants,\r\ncould be concerned about political matters in that Mohammedan kingdom.\r\n\r\nWith France the case was very different. Algeria was adjacent to the\r\nterritories of the Sultan of Morocco, and, if the wild tribes on the\r\nfrontier were stirred up against the infidel, the most important French\r\ncolony was threatened with serious disturbance. It was all-important\r\nfor France, therefore, that there should be a government at Fez strong\r\nenough and enlightened enough to keep peace on the border. Clemenceau,\r\nwho had always been so stern an opponent of colonial adventures, and\r\nhad overthrown several Cabinets which he considered were prone to\r\nencourage harmful exploits, had himself spoken out very plainly about\r\nMorocco. Long before capitalist interests were involved on any large\r\nscale the French ownership of Algeria necessitated a definite Moroccan\r\npolicy. This again brought with it the obligation of constant pressure\r\nupon the Sultan to induce him to consider French interests. These\r\ninterests could be harmonised with those of Spain and Great Britain,\r\nand were so settled by special agreements in April, 1904, just a year\r\nbefore the German Emperor's _coup de théâtre_ startled the world.\r\nFrance's special interests in Morocco were thus recognised all round,\r\nand Germany, far from raising any objection, expressly disclaimed any\r\ndesire to interfere, so long as \"the open door\" was left for German\r\ngoods. But the general antagonism between France and Germany was a\r\nmatter of common knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, therefore, that the Sultan of Morocco, alarmed lest\r\nFrench attempts to introduce \"order\" and \"good government\" into his\r\nrealm might end, as it had always done elsewhere, by destroying his\r\nindependence, should appeal to the Kaiser, who had proclaimed his\r\nsympathy for the Moslem, to help him against the less sympathetic\r\ninfidel. For a long time these appeals fell upon deaf ears. Even when\r\nthe Kaiser visited Gibraltar, after an interview with the King of\r\nSpain, he refused pressing invitations to cross the Straits and meet\r\nenvoys of the Moroccan potentate at Tangier. This was in March, 1904.\r\nBut in March, 1905, when everything looked peaceful, the Kaiser went to\r\nTangier in the _Hohenzollern_, landed with an imposing suite, met the\r\nuncle of the Sultan, who came as a special envoy to the German Emperor,\r\nand addressed him in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"I am to-day paying my visit to the Sultan in his quality of\r\nindependent sovereign. I hope that under the sovereignty of the Sultan\r\na free Morocco will remain open to the peaceful competition of all\r\nnations, without monopoly and without annexation, on the footing of\r\nabsolute equality. The object of my visit to Tangier is to make known\r\nthat I have decided to do all in my power to effectually safeguard\r\nthe interests of Germany in Morocco. Since I consider the Sultan an\r\nabsolutely free sovereign, it is with him that I desire to come to an\r\nunderstanding on suitable measures for safeguarding these interests. As\r\nto the reforms that the Sultan intends to make, it seems to me that he\r\nmust proceed with much caution, having regard to the religious feelings\r\nof the population, so that public order may not be disturbed.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the declaration of the German Emperor. What gave special\r\npoint to his address was the fact that at that very moment a French\r\ndelegation was at the capital, Fez, in order to obtain necessary\r\nreforms from the Sultan, and was meeting week after week the most\r\nobstinate resistance from him and his Government. It was obviously open\r\nsupport of the Sultan in his refusal to accept French representations,\r\nand a declaration of hostility to France on the part of the Kaiser.\r\nNothing more arrogant or offensive can well be imagined. France, from\r\nthe Socialist point of view, was wrong in her attempt to instruct the\r\nSultan how to deal with a state of things which undoubtedly threatened\r\nthe peace of Algeria, but the Kaiser's intervention after such a\r\nfashion was wholly unwarrantable, and threatened the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nWhat was the meaning of this extraordinary display of Imperial\r\ndiplomacy and Prussian direct action? There were statesmen--Sir Charles\r\nDilke was one--who believed that the German Emperor was really devoted\r\nto peace, and that no war could take place in Europe so long as he\r\nlived. There was a general feeling in England to the same effect,\r\nlargely engineered by Lord Haldane and others of like nature, whose\r\nspiritual or political home was in Germany. But all can see now that\r\nthis was an illusion. The only difference between the Kaiser and the\r\nmost aggressive and bloodthirsty Junker or pan-German was as to the\r\ntime and season when the tremendous Central European and partially\r\nMohammedan combination that he had formed should commence the attack.\r\nWilliam II wished to wait until the road had been so completely\r\nprepared for the aggressive advance that victory on every side would\r\nbe practically certain. The Junker party, with which the Crown Prince\r\nidentified himself, were in a hurry, and the Emperor could only keep\r\nthem in good humour by these periodical outbursts which enabled him to\r\npose as the dictator of Europe.\r\n\r\nAll through, the Kaiser's real ambition was that which he occasionally\r\ndisclosed in a well-known drawing-room in Berlin. He would not die\r\nhappy unless he had ridden at the head of the Teutonic armies as the\r\nCharlemagne of modern Europe. But this megalomania was only indulged\r\nin with his intimates. Elsewhere he stood forth as the rival of his\r\nuncle as the Prince of Peace. According to him, therefore, it was M.\r\nDelcassé who forced him to act in this peremptory way at Tangier; and\r\nefforts were made to convince all the Governments in Europe that the\r\nFrench Minister of Foreign Affairs had tried to boycott Germany out\r\nof Morocco. France, rather than take up the challenge, got rid of M.\r\nDelcassé. Thus the Emperor displayed his power for the appeasement of\r\nhis Junkers, established a permanent source of difficulty on the flank\r\nof France, and gave the Mohammedan world to understand once more that\r\nGermany, not England, was the champion of Islam.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, German political, financial and commercial influence of\r\nevery kind was making astounding advances, not only in France itself,\r\nbut also in every country that might at the critical moment be able\r\nto help either France or Russia; while German armaments, military and\r\nnaval, and German alliances for war were being worked up to the point\r\nwhich, if carried on for ten, or perhaps even for five years more,\r\nwould have rendered the German power almost, if not quite, irresistible\r\nby any combination that could have been made in time against it. The\r\nKaiser, in short, was playing a successful game of world-peace in\r\norder to make sure of playing at the right moment a successful game\r\nof world-war. Desperate as the conflict has been, it may have been\r\nfortunate for mankind that the Junkers, his son and the General Staff\r\nforced the Emperor's hand.\r\n\r\nWhen, consequently, Clemenceau took the lead in French affairs, he\r\nsoon found that the sacrifice of M. Delcassé, the friend of Edward\r\nVII, to the pretended German injury had been made in vain. There was\r\nno intention whatever, either then or later, of coming to a really\r\npermanent settlement of outstanding grievances against France, although\r\nthe position in Morocco was eventually used to gain great advantages in\r\nother parts of Africa. Germany was, in fact, a permanent menace to the\r\npeace of Europe and the world; but those who said so, and adduced plain\r\nfacts to justify their contentions, were unfortunately denounced both\r\nby capitalists and Socialists in every country as fomenters of war.\r\nThis insidious propaganda, which tended to the advantage of Germany in\r\nevery respect, was already going on in 1906, when M. Clemenceau joined\r\nM. Sarrien's Cabinet, and when he formed a Cabinet of his own. This was\r\npublicly recognised.\r\n\r\nThis is what M. Clemenceau said at Hyères, after some furious attacks\r\nhad been made upon France in the German official newspapers; no German\r\nnewspapers being allowed to print comments on foreign affairs without\r\nthe consent of the Foreign Office: \"No peace is possible without\r\nforce. When I took office I myself was persuaded that all European\r\nnations were of one mind in wishing for peace. But almost immediately,\r\nwithout any provocation whatever from us, a storm of calumny and\r\nmisrepresentation broke out upon us, and we were compelled to ask\r\nourselves, 'Are we prepared?'\"\r\n\r\nOn October 23rd of the same year, M. Sarrien resigned, and M.\r\nClemenceau formed his Cabinet. It comprised, among others, Messrs.\r\nPichon (Foreign Affairs), Caillaux (Finance), Colonel Picquart (War),\r\nBriand (Justice and Education), Viviani (Labour), and Donmergue\r\n(Commerce). A more peaceful Cabinet could hardly be. M. Pichon, who\r\ntook the place from which M. Delcassé had been forced to resign\r\nbecause he too strongly opposed German influence in Morocco and\r\nrefused a European Conference on the subject as wholly unnecessary,\r\nwas an old friend and co-worker with Clemenceau on _La Justice_, and\r\nhad gone into diplomacy at Clemenceau's suggestion. He had since held\r\npositions in the East and in Tunis, and he and Clemenceau were believed\r\nto be entirely at one in abjuring all adventurous colonial policy. M.\r\nCaillaux, at the head of the Department of Finance--people are apt to\r\nforget that M. Caillaux, now in gaol under serious accusation, was\r\nthus trusted by Clemenceau--was certainly not opposed to Germany, but\r\neven at that time was favourable to a close understanding with that\r\npower. Colonel Picquart, who now received his reward for having, though\r\npersonally an anti-Semite, destroyed all his own professional prospects\r\nin his zeal to obtain justice for the Jew Dreyfus, was certainly as\r\npacific a War Minister as could have been appointed. But what was more\r\nsignificant still, M. Briand, himself a Socialist, and the hero of the\r\ngreat inquiry into the separation of Church and State which had now\r\nbecome inevitable, was placed in a position to carry that important\r\nmeasure to its final vote and settlement; and M. Viviani, likewise a\r\nSocialist, became head of the new department, the Ministry of Labour.\r\nWhen I saw these two men, Briand, whom I remembered well as a vehement\r\nanarchist, and Viviani, who was a vigorous Socialist speaker and\r\nwriter, in the Cabinet of which Clemenceau was the chief, I could not\r\nbut recall the conversation I had with the French Premier sixteen years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nSeated comfortably in his delightful library, surrounded by splendid\r\nJapanese works of art, of which at that time he was an ardent\r\ncollector, M. Clemenceau had spoken very freely indeed. Of course, he\r\nknew quite well that I was no mere interviewer for Press purposes,\r\nand, indeed, I have always made it a rule to keep such conversations,\r\nexcept perhaps for permitted indiscretions here and there, entirely\r\nto myself. There is no need for me to enlarge upon his quick and\r\nalmost abrupt delivery, his apt remarks and illustrations, his bright,\r\nclever, vigorous face and gestures. I put it to him that Socialism was\r\nthe basis of the coming political party in France and that, vehement\r\nindividualist as he might be himself, it was impossible for him to\r\nresist permanently the current of the time, or to remain merely a\r\nsupremely powerful critic and organiser of overthrow. Sooner or later\r\nhe must succumb to the inevitable and take his seat as President of\r\nCouncil, and to do this with any hope of success or usefulness he would\r\nhave to rely in an increasing degree upon Socialist and semi-Socialist\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nTo this Clemenceau answered that he was quite contented with his\r\nexisting position; that he had no wish to enter upon office with its\r\nresponsibilities and corrupting influence; while, as to Socialism, that\r\ncould never make way in France in his day.\r\n\r\n\"Looking only at the towns,\" he said, \"you may think otherwise, though\r\neven there I consider the progress of Socialism is overrated. But the\r\ntowns do not govern France. The overwhelming majority of French voters\r\nare country voters. France means rural France, and the peasantry of\r\nFrance will never be Socialists. Nobody can know them better than my\r\nfamily and I know them. Landed proprietors ourselves--my father's\r\npassion for buying land to pay him three per cent. with borrowed money\r\nfor which he had to pay four per cent. would have finally ruined him,\r\nbut that our wholesome French law permits gentle interference in such\r\na case--we have ever lived with and among the peasantry. We have\r\nbeen doctors from generation to generation, and have doctored them\r\ngratuitously, as I did myself, both in country and in town. I have seen\r\nthem very close, in birth and in death, in sickness and in health,\r\nin betrothal and in marriage, in poverty and in well-being, and all\r\nthe time their one idea is property; to possess, to own, to provide\r\na good portion for the daughter, to secure a good and well _dot_-ed\r\nwife for the son. Always _property_, ownership, possession, work,\r\nthrift, acquisition, individual gain. Socialism can never take root\r\nin such a soil as this. North or south, it is just the same. Preach\r\nnationalisation of the land in a French village, and you would barely\r\nescape with your life, if the peasants understood what you meant. Come\r\nwith me for a few weeks' trip through rural France, and you will soon\r\nunderstand the hopelessness of Socialism here. It will encounter a\r\npersonal fanaticism stronger than its own. Your Socialists are men of\r\nthe town; they do not understand the men and women of the country.\"\r\n\r\nNow the same M. Clemenceau, after a long struggle side by side with\r\nthe Socialist Party, first in the Dreyfus case and then in the\r\nanti-Clericalist and Separation of Church and State movement, finds\r\nthat events have moved so fast, in a comparatively short space of time,\r\nthat he is practically compelled to take two active Socialists into his\r\nown Cabinet. This, too, in spite of the fact that his action in calling\r\nin the troops at Courrières and insisting upon liberty for non-strikers\r\nor black-legs had turned the Socialist Party, as a party, definitely\r\nagainst him. No more significant proof of the advance of Socialist\r\ninfluence could well have been given. That it was entirely on the side\r\nof peace and a good understanding with Germany cannot be disputed.\r\n\r\nBut this did not make the Morocco affair itself any less complicated\r\nor threatening. Notwithstanding the Conference which Germany succeeded\r\nin having convoked at Algeciras, and the settlement arrived at in\r\nApril, 1906, after a sitting of more than three months, the condition\r\nof Morocco itself had not improved. The fact that the Conference gave\r\nFrance the preference in the scheme of reforms proposed and in the\r\npolitical management of Morocco, against the efforts of Germany and\r\nAustria, suited neither the Sultan nor the Kaiser. Troubles arose\r\nof a serious character. The French considered themselves forced to\r\nintervene. The old antagonism broke out afresh. So much so that the\r\nFrench Premier spoke with more than his usual frankness in an interview\r\nwith a German newspaper in November:--\r\n\r\n\"The Germans have one great fault. They show us extreme courtesy to-day\r\nand marked rudeness the day after. Before this Morocco affair, feeling\r\nin France had much improved. Many of us thought an understanding with\r\nGermany very desirable, and I freely admit your Emperor did a good deal\r\nto engender this feeling. Then, although we had dismissed Delcassé,\r\nthe German press attacked us. It went so far as to declare that you\r\nwere to extort from us the milliards of francs necessary to finance an\r\nAnglo-German war. . . . I do not want to have any war, and if we desire\r\nno war we necessarily wish to be on good terms with our neighbours.\r\nIf, also, our relations are unsatisfactory, we are anxious to improve\r\nthem. Such is my frame of mind. Moreover, if I have a chance of doing\r\nso, I shall be glad to act on these lines. Of course it is imperatively\r\nnecessary for us to be always strong and ready for all eventualities.\r\nThat, however, does not mean that we want war: quite the contrary. To\r\nwish for war would mean that we were mad. We could not possibly carry\r\non a war policy. If we did, Parliament would soon turn us out, as it\r\ndid Delcassé.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be clearer than that. And what made the pronouncement\r\nmore important even than the strong but sober language used was the\r\nfact that, after as before the Conference of Algeciras, there was\r\nreally a great disposition among certain sections in France to come\r\nto terms with Germany, rather than to strengthen the understanding\r\nwith England. The expression of this opinion could be frequently heard\r\namong the people. It was fostered, even in the face of the German press\r\ncampaign against the Clemenceau Administration, by powerful financial\r\ninterests and by Clerical reactionary elements which were at this time\r\nless hostile to Germany than to England.\r\n\r\nThroughout, however, Clemenceau stood for the _Entente_ with the\r\nlatter power as the only sound policy for his country. In this respect\r\nhe was at one with the old statement of Gambetta that a breach of\r\nthe alliance with England would be fatal to France. For Clemenceau,\r\ntherefore, who had more than once in his career suffered so severely\r\nfor his friendship for England, to state that an understanding with\r\nGermany had been seriously contemplated was a striking testimony to\r\nthe immediate tendency of the time at that juncture. Whether the whole\r\nof this fitful friendliness on the side of Germany was simulated\r\nin order to foster that remarkable policy of steady infiltration of\r\nGerman interests, German management, and German goods into France,\r\nwith far other than peaceful aims, is a question which can be much\r\nmore confidently answered now than at the period when this peaceful\r\noffensive was going on. Enough to say that the Clemenceau Ministry was\r\nnot, at first, at all averse from a permanent arrangement for peace\r\nwith Germany, so long as English animosity was not aroused.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, nevertheless, that French policy in Morocco was,\r\nin the long run, quite contrary to the views on colonial affairs which\r\nClemenceau had so strongly expressed and acted upon hitherto. Whatever\r\nexcuse may be made on account of the proximity of Morocco to Algeria,\r\nand the necessity for France to protect her own countrymen and secure\r\npeace on the border, the truth remains that the French Republic was\r\nallowed by her statesmen to drift into what was virtually a national\r\nand capitalist domination of that independent country, backed up by a\r\npowerful French army. Clemenceau in his defence of these aggressions\r\nrecites those familiar apologies for that sort of patriotism which\r\nconsists in love of another people's country and the determination to\r\nseize it, which we Englishmen have become so accustomed to in our own\r\ncase. If we didn't take it, somebody else would. If we leave matters as\r\nthey are, endless disturbances will occur and will spread to our own\r\nterritory. A protectorate must be established.\r\n\r\nBut a protectorate must have a powerful armed force behind it, or there\r\ncan be no real protection. National capital is being invested under\r\nour peaceful penetration for the benefit of the protected people.\r\nThe rights of investors must be safe-guarded. Our countrymen--in\r\nthis instance Frenchmen--have been molested and even murdered by the\r\nbarbarous folk whom we have been called upon to civilise. Such outrages\r\ncannot be permitted to go unpunished. Towns bombarded. Villages burnt.\r\nPeace re-established. More troops. \"Security of life and property\"\r\nensured by a much larger army and the foundation of civilised\r\nCourts. Protection develops insensibly into possession. The familiar\r\nprogression of grab is, in short, complete.\r\n\r\nThat is pretty much what went on with Morocco, whose entire\r\nindependence as a sovereign State had only just been internationally\r\nacknowledged. What is more, it went on under M. Clemenceau's own\r\nGovernment, consisting of the same peaceful politicians enumerated\r\nabove. No doubt the action of Germany against France and French\r\ninterests, on the one side, and the support by England of France and\r\nFrench interests, on the other, hastened the acceptance of the \"white\r\nman's burden\" which her capitalists and financiers were so eager to\r\nundertake; if only to upset the schemes of the Brothers Mannesmann\r\nin the troublous Mohammedan Sultanate. But it is strange to find\r\nClemenceau in this galley. For, unjustifiable as were the proceedings\r\nof Germany at the beginning and all through, it is now obvious that\r\nFrance, by her own policy, put arguments into the mouth of the\r\npeace-at-any-price and pro-German advocates; that also she played the\r\ngame of the Kaiser and his unscrupulous agent Dr. Rosen. This worthy\r\nhad been in the employment of Prince Radolin, who thus described him:\r\n\"He is a Levantine Jew whose sole capacity is intriguing to increase\r\nhis own importance.\" It was disgraceful of Germany to make use of such\r\na man to stir up Morocco against France. But it was certainly most\r\nunwise, as well as contrary to international comity, for France to put\r\nherself in the wrong by an aggressive policy in that State. Especially\r\nwas this the case when such a terrible menace still overhung her\r\nEastern frontier, and, as events proved, not a man could be spared for\r\nadventures in Morocco or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe war between rival Sultans and the attack upon the French settlers\r\nat Casablanca could not justify such a complete change of front.\r\nJaurès, in fact, was in the right when he denounced the advance of\r\nGeneral Amadé with a strong French army as a filibustering expedition,\r\ndangerous in itself and provocative towards Germany. But Clemenceau\r\nsupported his Foreign Minister, Pichon, in the occupation of\r\nCasablanca, which had been heavily bombarded beforehand, and, on\r\nFebruary 25th, declared that France did not intend to evacuate Morocco,\r\nneither did she mean to conquer that country. He had, he averred, no\r\nsecrets, and, as in the matter of the anarchist rising in the South,\r\nsaid he was ready to resign. This was evidence of impatience, which was\r\nharmful at such a critical period in French home and foreign affairs.\r\nIt looked as if Clemenceau had been so accustomed to turn out French\r\nGovernments that he could not discriminate even in favour of his own!\r\nBut the Chamber gave him a strong vote of confidence, and he remained\r\nat his post.\r\n\r\nThere were two important developments in foreign affairs going on\r\nduring this year, 1908, of which the difficulties in Morocco, serious\r\nas they were, constituted only a side issue. The one was open and\r\nabove-board: the other was known only to those who kept very closely in\r\ntouch with German politics.\r\n\r\nThe first was the rapid improvement in the relations between France\r\nand Great Britain, for which Clemenceau himself and King Edward VII\r\nwere chiefly responsible. We are now so accustomed to regard the\r\n_Entente_ as part and parcel of English foreign policy that it is not\r\neasy to understand how bitter the feeling was against Great Britain\r\nwhich led important Frenchmen to take the view of an agreement with\r\nGermany spoken of above. English domination in Egypt, to the practical\r\nexclusion of French influence and control even over the Suez Canal;\r\nEnglish conventions with Japan, checking, as was thought, that\r\nlegitimate French expansion in Asia by which M. Jules Ferry had hoped\r\nto counterbalance the defeats of 1870-71; English settlement of the\r\nirritating Newfoundland Fisheries question; English truculence and\r\nunfairness in the infamous Boer War; English antagonism to Russia,\r\nFrance's trusted ally and heavy debtor--all these things stood in the\r\nway of any cordial understanding. It may well be that only Clemenceau's\r\nstrong personal influence, supported by his nominee President\r\nFallières, prevented steps being taken which would have been fatal to\r\nthe revival of genuine good feeling between the Western Powers. The\r\nfollowing passage in the _Encyclopædia Britannica_ does no more than\r\njustice to Clemenceau's services in this direction:\r\n\r\n\"M. Clemenceau, who only late in life came into office and attained\r\nit when a better understanding with England was progressing, had been\r\nthroughout his long career, of all public men in all political groups,\r\nthe most consistent friend of England. His presence at the head of\r\naffairs was a guarantee of amicable Anglo-French relations, so far as\r\nthey could be protected by statesmanship.\" This tribute in a permanent\r\nwork of reference is thoroughly well deserved.\r\n\r\nHappily, too, his efforts had been earnestly supported long before,\r\nand even quietly during, the Boer War, by Edward VII, as Prince\r\nof Wales and as King. But this very connection between the French\r\nRadical statesman and the English monarch was the subject of most\r\nvirulent attacks. It was, in fact, made the groundwork of an elaborate\r\naccusation of treachery against Clemenceau, who was represented as\r\nthe mere tool of Edward VII in promoting the permanent effacement\r\nof France. The King was an English Machiavelli, constantly plotting\r\nto recover for the British Empire, at the expense of France, that\r\nworld-wide prestige which the miserable Boer War and the rise of\r\nGerman power on land and sea, in trade and in finance, had seriously\r\njeopardised. A book by the well-known M. Flourens, written at this\r\ntime to uphold that thesis, went through no fewer than five editions.\r\nHere is the pleasing picture of the late King presented for the\r\ncontemplation of the Parisian populace by this virulent penman:\r\n\r\n\"Edouard VII montait sur le trône à l'age où, si l'on consulte les\r\nstatistiques, 75% des rois sont déjà descendus dans la tombe. Il\r\nsortait d'une longue oisiveté pour entrer dans la vie active a l'époque\r\noù, dans toutes les carrières et fonctions publiques, les hommes font\r\nvaloir leurs droits à la retraite.\r\n\r\n\"S'il y avait un conseil de revision pour les rois, comme il y en a un\r\npour les conscrits, il eût été déclaré impropre au service.\r\n\r\n\"L'obésité déformait son corps, alourdissait sa marche, semblait,\r\nsous le développement des tissus adipeux, paralyser toute activité\r\nphysique, toute force intellectuelle. Sa figure, contractée par la\r\ndouleur, trahissait, par moment, les souffrances qu'une volonté de fer\r\ns'efforcait de maîtriser, pour dissimuler aux yeux de ses sujets la\r\nmaladie qui, à cet instant même, menaçait sa vie.\r\n\r\n\"A voir sa corpulence maladive, on ne pouvait s'empêcher de se rappeler\r\nles paroles que Shakespeare met dans la bouche d'un de ses ancêtres, à\r\nl'adresse du fameux Falstaff, le compagnon dissolu des égarements de sa\r\njeunesse: 'Songe à travailler, a diminuer ton ventre et a grossir ton\r\nmérite--quitte ta vie dissolue! Regarde la tombe, elle ouvre, pour toi,\r\nune bouche trois fois plus large que pour les autres hommes!'\r\n\r\n\"De tous côtés, les lanceurs de prédictions, depuis le fameux archange\r\nGabriel jusqu'à la non moins fameuse Mme. de Thèbes, s'accordaient pour\r\nentourer son avènement des plus sinistres prévisions, pour annoncer\r\nsa fin prochaine et l'imminence d'une nouvelle vacance du trône\r\nd'Angleterre.\r\n\r\n\"Symptôme plus grave! Les oracles de la science n'étaient pas moins\r\nmenaçants que les prophéties des devins. Deux fois, les pompes de son\r\ncouronnement durent être décommandées, deux fois les fêtes ajournées\r\net les lampions éteints. Les hôtes princiers, convoqués a grands frais\r\nde tous les points du globe, pour participer à ces réjouissances,\r\nattendirent, dans l'angoisse, l'annonce d'une cérémonie plus lugubre.\r\n\r\n\"La volonté d'Edouard VII triumpha de toutes ces résistances. Il\r\ndéclara avec une indomptable énergie que, coûte que coûte, il était\r\ndécidé a ne pas descendre dans la tombe avant d'avoir posé sur sa tête,\r\navec tout l'éclat, avec toute la solennité traditionnels, aux yeux\r\ndes représentants émerveillés de tout son vaste empire, aux yeux de\r\nl'Univers jaloux, la couronne de ses Pères, sa double couronne de Roi\r\net d'Empereur, que les mains avides de la mort semblaient vouloir lui\r\ndisputer.\"\r\n\r\nHis account of Edward VII reads curiously to-day, the more so when we\r\nrecall the fact that M. Emile Flourens was at one time French Minister\r\nof Foreign Affairs, and that, at the moment when the book first\r\nappeared, the King was frequently in Paris, and on good terms with\r\nRepublicans of all sections.\r\n\r\nAfter pointing out how scrupulously he had as Prince of Wales\r\nsuppressed his political opinions, during his mother's lifetime, even\r\nwhen his power, had he exerted it, might have been advantageous to his\r\ncountry, the French critic gives him full credit for having made the\r\nbest of his life in many ways. He had travelled all over the world,\r\nhad studied humanity and society in all shapes, had \"warmed both hands\r\nbefore the fire of life\" in every quarter of the globe. But, though\r\nhis features as a private personage were familiar to everybody, he\r\nremained a sphinx, mysterious and unfathomable, even to his friends, in\r\npublic affairs. He was well known to Parisians everywhere, and was as\r\npopular in working-class centres as in the most aristocratic _salons_.\r\nParis was, in fact, the only city where he was at his ease and at home,\r\nwhere, in fact, he was himself. By far the most sympathetic Briton to\r\nParisians who ever was in Paris, he exercised a real influence over\r\nall classes. They were kept carefully informed as to his tastes, his\r\nmanners, his intimates, his vices and his debts, and were the more\r\nfriendly to him on account of them. The warmest partisans of his\r\naccession, however, were his creditors, who were mortally afraid that\r\nhis habits would not give him the opportunity for discharging his\r\nliabilities out of his mother's accumulations.\r\n\r\nThe description of the position of the British Empire at the close of\r\nthe Boer War was less flattering even than the personal sketch of its\r\nKing and Emperor. \"At this moment the astounded peoples had felt the\r\nBritannic colossus totter on its foundation, this colossus with feet\r\nof clay which weighs down too credulous nations by its bluff, by its\r\narrogance, by rapine, by insatiable rapacity, which already grips the\r\nentire globe like a gigantic cuttle-fish and sucks its marrow through\r\nthe numberless tentacles of its commerce, until the day when it shall\r\nsubjugate the whole planet to its domination--always provided that it\r\ndoes not encounter on its way another still more powerful octopus of\r\ndestruction which will attack and destroy it.\"\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that this challenger of the British supremacy was the\r\nrising power of Germany. As an Englishman I admit the infamy of the\r\nBoer War, and recognise that our rule in India and Ireland has been\r\nanything but what it ought to have been. M. Clemenceau knew all that as\r\nwell as we British anti-Imperialists do. But even in 1907-8 much had\r\nhappened since 1900. Democracy was slowly making way in Great Britain\r\nlikewise, and freedom for others would surely follow emancipation\r\nfor herself. It was not to be expected that all Frenchmen should see\r\nor understand this. A nation which has under its flag a fourth of\r\nthe population and more than a seventh of the habitable surface of\r\nthe world can scarcely expect that another colonial country, whose\r\ncolonies the British have largely appropriated, in the East and in\r\nthe West, will admit the \"manifest destiny\" of the Union Jack to wave\r\nof undisputed right over still more territory. There was a good deal\r\nto be said, and a good deal was said, about British greed and British\r\nunscrupulousness: nor could the truth of many of the imputations be\r\nhonestly denied.\r\n\r\nIt called, therefore, for all Edward VII's extraordinary knowledge\r\nof Paris, his bonhomie, shrewd common sense, and uncanny power of\r\n\"creating an atmosphere\" to overcome the prejudice thus created against\r\nhimself as a master of intrigue, and Clemenceau as his willing tool.\r\nMatters went so far that at one moment the King's reception in his\r\nfavourite capital seemed likely to be hostile, and might have been so,\r\nbut for the admirable conduct of the high-minded, conservative patriot,\r\nM. Déroulède. But, luckily for France, Great Britain and the world\r\nat large, these difficulties had been overcome; and almost the only\r\ngood feature in the trouble with Morocco was the vigorous diplomatic\r\nhelp France received from England--a good feature because it helped to\r\nwipe away the bitter memories of the past from the minds of the French\r\npeople. The extremely cordial reception of President Fallières and M.\r\nClemenceau in London, and the King's own exceptional courtesy at all\r\ntimes to M. Delcassé, whom the French public regarded as the victim of\r\nGerman dictatorial demands, tended in the same direction. All the world\r\ncould see that Clemenceau's Administration had so far strengthened the\r\nAnglo-French _Entente_ as to have brought it almost to the point of an\r\nalliance: nor thereafter was the Triple Entente with Russia, as opposed\r\nto the Triple Alliance, very far off.\r\n\r\nAt this same time, however, matters were going so fast in Germany\r\ntowards an open breach that the only wonder is that the truth of\r\nthe situation was not disclosed, and that Germany, quite ready, and\r\ndetermined to be more ready, for war at any moment, was allowed to\r\ncontinue her policy of pretended peace.\r\n\r\nEngland and, to a large extent, France still believed in the pacific\r\nintentions of the Fatherland. Yet a meeting was held in Berlin of the\r\nheads of all the departments directly or indirectly connected with\r\nwar, at which the Kaiser delivered a speech which could only mean one\r\nthing: that Germany and her Allies would enter upon war so soon as\r\nthe opportunity presented itself, and the preparations, including the\r\ncompletion of the Kiel Canal (or perhaps before that great work had\r\nbeen accomplished), gave promise of a short and decisive campaign.\r\nRumours of this address reached those who were kept informed as to\r\nwhat was being contemplated by the Kaiser, his Militarist Junker\r\n_entourage_ and the Federal Council. Unfortunately, when the statement\r\nwas challenged, a strong denial was issued, and the pacifists and\r\npro-Germans, honest and dishonest, laughed at the whole story as a\r\nbaseless scare.\r\n\r\nHow far it was baseless could be learnt from deeds that spoke much\r\nlouder than words. Even thus early great accumulations of munitions of\r\nwar were being made at Cologne, and the military sidings and railway\r\nequipments, which could only serve for warlike and not commercial\r\npurposes, were being completed. Six years before the war, all the work\r\nnecessary for an aggressive descent on the West and for the passage\r\nthrough Belgium had been done.\r\n\r\nEurope was comfortably seated over a powder magazine. M. Clemenceau\r\nmight well discuss in London, when he came over to Sir Henry\r\nCampbell-Bannerman's funeral, as Premier of France, how many hundred\r\nthousand men, fully equipped for war, England could land within a\r\nfortnight in North-Eastern France, should a sudden and unprovoked\r\nattack be made. But he got no satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, that what with strikes, anarchist outbreaks,\r\nthe troubles in Morocco, the menacing attitude of Germany--who,\r\nas Clemenceau put it, said, \"Choose between England and us\"--and\r\nthe attempts to form an enduring compact with England, Clemenceau\r\nas President of Council, with all his energy, determination and\r\nversatility, had enough on his hands to occupy all his thoughts. But\r\nthis did not exhaust the catalogue of his labours during his term of\r\npremiership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                     END OF CLEMENCEAU'S MINISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is easy to be tolerant of the Catholic Church and Catholics in\r\na Protestant country; though even in Great Britain, and of course\r\nonly too sadly in the North of Ireland, there are times when the\r\nbitterness inherited from the past makes itself felt, on slight\r\nprovocation, in the present. At such times of sectarian outburst we\r\nget some idea ourselves of what religious hatred really means, and\r\ncan form a conception of the truly fraternal eagerness to immolate\r\nthe erring brethren, nominally of the same Christian creed, which\r\nanimated the true believers of different shades of faith, whether\r\nOrthodox or Arian, Catholic or Huguenot, in days gone by. Those who\r\nchance to remember what Catholicism was in Italy, the Papal States,\r\nor Naples, two generations ago--the Church then claiming for itself\r\nrights of jurisdiction and sanctuary, outside the common law--those\r\nwho understand what has gone on in Spain quite recently, can also\r\nappreciate the feeling of Frenchmen who, within the memory of their\r\nfellow-citizens still living, and even themselves in some degree under\r\nthe Empire, had suffered from Clerical interference and repression,\r\nwhen the chance of getting rid of State ecclesiasticism was presented\r\nto them at the beginning of the twentieth century. The Church had\r\nentirely lost touch with the temper of the time. Though it may have\r\nbeen impossible for the Vatican to accept the brilliant suggestion that\r\nthe great men of science should all be canonised and the discoverers\r\nof our day should receive the red hat, as secular Cardinals, there was\r\nno apparent reason why a form of supernaturalism which had lived\r\ninto and out of two forms of human slavery, and was passing through a\r\nthird, should have been unable to adapt itself in some degree to modern\r\nthought. A creed which, in its most successful period, had conveniently\r\nabsorbed ancestor-worship as part of its theological propaganda in\r\nChina, need not, one would have thought, have found it indispensably\r\nnecessary to the salvation of its votaries to cleave to all the old\r\nheresies, inculcated in days when criticism of the incomprehensible and\r\nunbelievable involved the unpleasant possibility of being tortured to\r\ndeath, or burnt alive.\r\n\r\nNor certainly could its worst enemy have predicted that the\r\ninfallibility of the Pope would be invented and thrust upon the\r\nfaithful, as a doctrine whose acceptance was essential to their\r\nspiritual welfare, in a period when it was being proved every day\r\nand in all departments of human knowledge that what was universally\r\nbelieved to be a certainty yesterday is discounted as a fallacy\r\nto-morrow. Nothing in all the long controversy about the Separation\r\nof Church and State in France produced a greater or more permanent\r\neffect upon intelligent Frenchmen than this preposterous claim of\r\nPapal infallibility. Explain it away, whittle down its significance by\r\nany amount of Jesuitical sophistry, and still this declaration that\r\na mere man could never be mistaken, because he was the Vicegerent\r\nof God, shook the whole framework of Catholic domination, so far as\r\nany participation of the State in the matter was concerned. And the\r\ncareer and character of many of the Pope's predecessors rendered the\r\ndogma more utterly preposterous to all who had even a smattering of\r\nthe history of the Vatican than might otherwise have been the case.\r\nThat John XXIII should have been infallible threw a strange light upon\r\nCatholic morality in its highest grades. Yet if Pius infallible, why\r\nnot John?\r\n\r\nWhat, however, had more practical effect in turning the scale of public\r\nopinion against the Papacy, its nominees and believers as servants and\r\npaid employees of the State, was the fact that in all the practical\r\naffairs of French life the Catholic Church, as represented by its\r\necclesiastical hierarchy, had taken the wrong side. Theoretical or\r\ntheological difficulties would never have upset the regard of the\r\nFrench people for the National Church. But, time after time, the\r\nClerical party ranged itself with the reactionists, throwing over all\r\nits wisest counsellors, whose devotion to the Church had never been\r\nquestioned, when they advised standing by the cause of the people, and\r\nrelied solely upon the judgment of bigoted Jesuits. Zola, whom these\r\ncreatures hated, showed in his \"Germinal,\" thoroughgoing materialist\r\nas he was, what a noble part a priest of the Church could play, when\r\nthe young ecclesiastic stands between the strikers who form part of his\r\nflock and the soldiers who are about to fire upon them. Individuals\r\nmight thus rise up to and above the level of their creed, but the\r\nChurch in France, as a whole, was represented by men of God who were\r\na good deal worse than men of Belial. Nor was this all. They pursued\r\na policy of relentless obscurantism. Their object was not to develop\r\neducation but to stunt its growth: not to teach the truth but to foster\r\nlies. So manifest was the determination to take no high view of their\r\nduties that such a man as the venerable Dr. Leplay, a Catholic of\r\nCatholics whose religious convictions did not prevent him from becoming\r\na master of the theories of Marx, lamented that his Church was proving\r\nitself wholly incompetent to cope with or to stem what, as a Christian,\r\nhe recognised was the rising tide of infidelity.\r\n\r\nOf this infidelity, the free-thinker and champion of secularism,\r\nClemenceau, was a type and a prominent example. He saw the Church\r\nas a pernicious influence. His feeling towards it was even more\r\nvehement than that of Voltaire or Gambetta. \"_Écrasez l'infâme!_\" \"_Le\r\ncléricalisme voilà l'ennemi!_\" If thought was to be free, if Frenchmen\r\nwere to be emancipated from superstition and intolerance, the power of\r\nthe Catholic Church must be weakened and, if possible, destroyed. For\r\nhim, in this matter, compromise was impossible. His begettings, his\r\nsurroundings, his education, his profession, his political life all\r\nmade him relentless on this point. Behind the Duc de Broglie, behind\r\nthe persecutor of Dreyfus, behind the pretender Boulanger, behind\r\nreaction in all its forms hid the sinister figure of the unscrupulous\r\npower, working _perinde ac cadaver_ against all that was noblest in\r\nFrance, against all that was highest in the ideals of the Republic. And\r\nif Clemenceau knew well that under all circumstances and at every turn\r\nof events the Catholic Church was the enemy of France and of himself,\r\nthe Church had no doubt at all that Clemenceau was its most formidable\r\nfoe in French political life.\r\n\r\nLong before and after his defeat in the Var, in 1893, the Catholics\r\nnever hesitated to join with their enemies, if only this combination\r\nwould help them to overthrow Clemenceau. Whatever differences the\r\nFrench Premier might have with the Socialists on strikes and social\r\naffairs generally, on the matter of the separation of Church and\r\nState they were heartily at one. In fact, Clemenceau was even more\r\nuncompromising than they. The whole texture of his thought revolted\r\nagainst showing any consideration for a Church which, from his point\r\nof view, had been for centuries the chief and most formidable enemy of\r\nprogress in France and the most capable organiser of attacks upon all\r\ndemocratic and Republican ideals.\r\n\r\nThe greatest names in French history are the names of those whom the\r\nCatholic Church has persecuted or martyred. Its leaders would resort to\r\nthe same tactics now, and have only failed to do so because the power\r\nhas slipped from their hands as the truths of science and the wider\r\nconceptions of human destiny have permeated the minds of the masses.\r\nThere was no likelihood that, as Prime Minister, Clemenceau, the\r\nfree-thinker and materialist, would be inclined to modify his opinions\r\nin favour of what might be regarded as statesmanlike concessions\r\nto the Right on ecclesiastical matters. The danger lay in the other\r\ndirection. It was one of the remarkable incidents, in connection with\r\nhis first tenure of the Presidency of the Council, that the final\r\nsettlement of this important question of the relations of Church\r\nand State should come when he himself was at the head of the French\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Briand's measure for the complete laicisation of the Church so\r\nfar as the State was concerned was introduced into the Chamber, he\r\npointed out in his report that the proposal for complete separation\r\nwas not dictated by hatred or political prejudice, nor did it involve\r\nanything at all approaching to the change in the relations of property\r\nwhen, at the time of the French Revolution, the Church owned one-third\r\nof the total wealth of France. This Act was the assertion of definite\r\nprinciples which were necessary in order to secure for the State full\r\nmastery in its own country. Freedom of worship for all. No State\r\npayment to ministers of any creed. Equitable management of Church\r\nproperty taken over by the towns and Communes.\r\n\r\nThe Bill, after considerable debate in the National Assembly, was\r\npassed by a large majority. In the Senate M. Clemenceau denounced\r\nthe settlement as too favourable to the clergy. His criticism was\r\nas mordant as usual. But he neither proposed an amendment nor voted\r\nagainst the Bill, which passed the Senate without even the alteration\r\nof a word, by a greater proportional majority than it did in the Lower\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nThis, it might have been thought, would have been the end of the\r\nmatter for Clemenceau. He had done his full share towards putting\r\nthe Catholic Church out of action, and might have been contented, as\r\nPremier, with any further settlement that M. Briand, the member of his\r\nown Cabinet responsible for this important measure, and M. Jaurès, the\r\npowerful leader of the Socialist Party, might come to in regard to\r\nthe properties of the Church, about which there had been much bitter\r\nfeeling. But Clemenceau has the defects of his qualities. The Pope\r\nhad refused to permit his clergy to avail themselves of the excellent\r\nterms French Republicans, Radicals and Socialists had been ready to\r\naccord to them. He had issued two Encyclicals which could certainly be\r\nread as intended to stir up trouble in the Republic--which, in fact,\r\nhad brought about some disorder. When, therefore, everything seemed\r\narranged on this prickly question of valuations and appropriations,\r\nClemenceau could not resist the temptation to show the unsatisfactory\r\nnature of the entire business to him. It was one of those moments of\r\nimpulse when \"the Tiger\" could not refrain from giving free play to\r\nhis propensities, at the expense of his own kith and kin, failing the\r\npresence of his enemies to maul. It was thought that the Ministry must\r\ncome down; for both M. Briand and M. Jaurès took this outburst amiss.\r\nBut a conversation in the lobby brought the great irreconcilable very\r\nsensibly to a compromise, and Clemenceau failed to give the Catholics\r\nthe malicious enjoyment they anticipated. It was a strange ebullition\r\nwhich exhibited the perennial youth of this statesman of the unexpected.\r\n\r\nIn other directions than social affairs and Morocco, where he\r\nunfortunately relied upon the Right more than upon the Left in the\r\nAssembly for the support of his Administration, Clemenceau proved that\r\nhis claim to act as the advocate of reform as well as the upholder of\r\norder was no pretence.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been its alleged deficiencies in some respects,\r\nClemenceau's first Ministry was by far the most Radical Government\r\nthat had held office under the Republic. And the boldness and decision\r\nwhich he and his Cabinet displayed in dealing with what they regarded\r\nas Anarchist action--it is fair, perhaps, to recall that Briand himself\r\nhad first achieved fame as an Anarchist--on the part of the workers,\r\nthey also put in force, when high-placed officers, with a powerful\r\npolitical backing, tried to impose their will upon the State. Thus the\r\nnavy, as has too often happened in French annals, had been allowed to\r\ndrift into a condition which was actually dangerous, in view of what\r\nwas going on in the German dockyards, and the probable combination\r\nof the Austrian and Italian fleets, with German help, in the\r\nMediterranean. At the same time, admirals were in the habit of acting\r\npretty much as they saw fit in regard to the fleets and vessels under\r\ntheir control. Consequently, important men-of-war had been wrecked\r\ntime after time, and more than one serious accident had occurred. In\r\nalmost every case also, so powerful was the _esprit de corps_, in the\r\nwrong sense, that the officers in command at the time were exonerated\r\nfrom blame. There was, therefore, a strong public opinion in favour of\r\nsomething being done to improve both the fleet itself and the spirit\r\nwhich animated its commanders. Admiral Germinat, a popular officer\r\nwith, as appears, a genuine loyalty to his profession and a desire to\r\nremedy its defects, thought proper to write a very strong letter to\r\na local service newspaper, making a fierce attack upon the general\r\nmanagement of the navy, without having given any notice of his views\r\neither to the Minister of Marine or the Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nThereupon, M. Clemenceau at once put him on the retired list.\r\nImmediately a great hubbub arose. The very same people who had approved\r\nof Clemenceau's policy, in regard to those whom they called anarchist\r\nworkmen, were now in full cry after the President of Council, for\r\ndaring to deal thus drastically with a man who, however his good\r\nintentions may have been and however distinguished his career, was\r\nbeyond all question an anarchist admiral. The matter became a question\r\nof the day. It was brought up in the Senate amid all sorts of threats\r\nto the stability of the Government. M. Clemenceau, as usual, took up\r\nthe challenge boldly himself. His speech was so crushing that the whole\r\nindictment against the Ministry collapsed. The evidence of indiscipline\r\non the Admiral's part, not only on this occasion but on several others,\r\nand the declaration that Admiral Germinat would not be excluded from\r\nthe navy, when he had purged his offence and when his services would be\r\nadvantageous to the country, settled the matter and strengthened the\r\nMinistry.\r\n\r\nBy acquiring the Chemin de Fer de l'Ouest and combining it with other\r\nGovernment railways, the Ministry made the first important step towards\r\nnationalisation of railways. Clemenceau defended this measure on\r\ngrounds that would be, and were, accepted by Socialists; but events\r\nhave shown in this particular case that a good deal more is needed than\r\nthe establishment of another department of State bureaucracy to render\r\nthe railways a national property really beneficial to the community.\r\nAs carried out in practice, the acquisition of the Chemin de Fer de\r\nl'Ouest has rather set back than advanced the general policy of railway\r\nnationalisation in France.\r\n\r\nA more important measure was that introduced by M. Caillaux and,\r\namazing to say, passed through the Assembly, for a graduated\r\nincome-tax. How this majority was obtained has always been one of\r\nthe puzzles of that period. There is no country in the world where a\r\ntax upon incomes is more unpopular than in France, and from that day\r\nto this, in spite of the desperate need for funds which has arisen,\r\nthis tax has never yet become law. But it was a genuine financial\r\nreform and creditable to the Government. The Socialists supported it,\r\nthough in itself it is only a palliative measure of justice in purely\r\nbourgeois finance. From this period dates the close alliance between\r\nthe Socialists as revolutionaries and M. Caillaux as the adventurous\r\nfinancier and director of the Société Générale, which later produced\r\nsuch strange results in French politics, and intensified Socialist\r\nhatred for M. Clemenceau. But at this time M. Caillaux, with the full\r\nconcurrence and support of the Prime Minister, was attacking all the\r\nbourgeois interests in their tenderest place. The wonder is that such\r\na policy did not involve the immediate fall of the Ministry. Quite\r\npossibly, had Clemenceau remained in office, it might have become a\r\npermanent feature in French finance. Boldness and boldness and boldness\r\nagain is sometimes as successful in politics as it is in oratory.\r\nAlthough, therefore, to attack pecuniary \"interests\" of a large section\r\nof the nation is a far more hazardous enterprise than to denounce\r\neminent persons or to overthrow Ministries, this move might then have\r\nbeen successful if well followed up.\r\n\r\nOn March 8th, in this year 1909, Clemenceau unveiled a statue to\r\nthe Radical Minister Floquet, with whom he had worked for many\r\nyears. The revolutionary Socialists announced their intention of\r\ndemonstrating against him on this occasion. They objected to him and\r\nhis administration on account of the expedition to Morocco--in which\r\nClemenceau had certainly run counter to all his previous policy on\r\ncolonial affairs--on account of cosmopolitan finance, Russian loans\r\nand the shooting down of workmen on strike. It was the last that\r\noccasioned the bitterest feeling against him, and this was really not\r\nsurprising.\r\n\r\nClemenceau had made the workers' liberty to strike in combination\r\nsecure, but he did not use the power of the State against the\r\nemployers, who, in the mines especially, could on his own showing be\r\nconsidered only as profiteering trustees under the State. Also, he\r\nrefused to all Government servants the right to combine or to strike.\r\nThis disinclination to take the capitalists by the throat, while using\r\nthe official power to restrain the workers, had a great deal more to do\r\nwith the menacing attitude of the Socialists than Morocco or finance.\r\nHowever, there was no disturbance. Clemenceau took advantage of the\r\noccasion to deliver a speech which was in effect a powerful defence\r\nof the idealist Republicanism of the eighteenth century against the\r\nrevolutionary Socialism of the twentieth.\r\n\r\nThe French Revolution is deified by nearly all advanced Frenchmen.\r\nIts glorification is as much the theme of Jaurès and Vaillant as of\r\nGambetta and Clemenceau. Bourgeois revolution as it turned out to be,\r\nowing to economic causes which neither individualists nor collectivists\r\ncould control, orators of the Revolution overlook facts and cleave to\r\nideals. Thus Clemenceau told his audience that the French Revolution\r\nwas a prodigious tragedy, which seemed to have been the work of\r\ndemi-gods, of huge Titans who had risen up from far below to wreak\r\nPromethean vengeance on the Olympians of every grade. The French\r\nRevolution was the inevitable culmination of the deadly struggle\r\nbetween the growing forces of liberty and the worn-out forces of\r\nautocracy without an autocrat. Yet, said he, the Revolution itself was\r\nmade by men and women inspired with the noblest ideals, but educated,\r\nin their own despite, by the Church to methods of domination, condemned\r\nalso by the desperate resistance of immeasurable powers to prompt and\r\npitiless action followed by corresponding deeds of brutal reaction.\r\nThe people who had just shed torrents of blood for the freedom of the\r\nworld passed, without audible protest, from Robespierre to Napoleon.\r\nYet the Revolution is all of a piece. The Republic moves steadily on\r\nas one indissoluble, vivifying force. Compare the France of the panic\r\nof 1875 with the France of to-day. Her position is the result of\r\nunderstandings and alliances and friendships based on the authority\r\nof her armed force. France has resumed her position in Europe, in\r\nspite of a few weak and mean-spirited Frenchmen, whose opposition only\r\nstrengthened the patriotic enthusiasm of the nation at large. The\r\nhistory of the Republican Party had been one long consecration of the\r\nwatchwords of the French Revolution. Liberty of the Press. Liberty\r\nof public meeting. Liberty of association. Liberty of trade unions.\r\nLiberty of minds by public schools. Liberty of thought and religion.\r\nLiberty of secular instruction. Liberty of State and worship. Laws had\r\nbeen passed for relief of the sick. A day of rest had been prescribed\r\nfor all. Workmen's compensation for injury had been made imperative.\r\nThe Income Tax had been passed by the Assembly. \"The Revolution is in\r\neffect one and indivisible, and, with unbroken persistence, the work of\r\nthe Republic goes on.\" A fine record! So argued Clemenceau.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the mistakes which Socialists so bitterly resented,\r\nthis was a great victory for the Republicans and for the Administration\r\nof which Clemenceau was the head. Not the least important claim to\r\nnational recognition of good service done was the establishment of\r\nthe Ministry of Labour, over which Viviani, the well-known Socialist,\r\npresided. The pressure of events, as well as the pressure of the\r\nSocialists themselves, might well have pushed the Radical-Socialist\r\nPremier farther along the Socialist path.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for the Prime Minister, and, from more than one point\r\nof view, for the nation, M. Clemenceau had another of those strange\r\nfits of impatience and irascibility which he had exhibited more than\r\nonce before. The political antagonism between M. Clemenceau and\r\nM. Delcassé was of long standing, and was intensified by personal\r\nbitterness. During his tenure of the office of Minister for Foreign\r\nAffairs, a position which he had held for seven years, in successive\r\nAdministrations of widely different character, M. Delcassé had been\r\nsubjected to vehement attacks by the leader of the Radical Left. His\r\npolicy in relation to Morocco had been specially obnoxious to M.\r\nClemenceau. That policy M. Clemenceau had most severely criticised\r\nat the time when M. Delcassé was stoutly resisting that extension\r\nof German influence in Morocco which led to the Foreign Minister's\r\ndownfall and the Conference of Algeciras, that M. Delcassé had refused\r\nto accept. The relations between the two statesmen could scarcely have\r\nbeen worse; but hitherto the Radical leader had carried all before him.\r\n\r\nNow came a dramatic climax to the long struggle. A debate arose in\r\nthe French Assembly on the condition of the navy. It was admittedly\r\nnot what it ought to have been. M. Picard, the Minister of Marine,\r\nmade a conciliatory reply to interpellations on the subject of\r\npromised immediate reforms and even complete reconstitution. But this\r\nwas not enough for M. Delcassé. The Assembly was not hostile to M.\r\nClemenceau, and certainly had no desire to oust his Administration;\r\nyet M. Delcassé's direct attack upon the Premier brought the whole\r\ndebate down to the level of a personal question. Nevertheless, what he\r\nsaid was quite legitimate criticism. M. Clemenceau had been a member\r\nof the Commission of Inquiry on the Navy, and could not get rid of\r\nhis responsibility for the present state of things. The great critic\r\nof everybody and everything was open to exposure himself. He who had\r\nenjoyed twenty-five years of running amuck at the whole political\r\nworld was now being called to account in person as an administrator.\r\nSo far M. Delcassé. Clemenceau retorted that M. Delcassé had himself\r\nbeen on the Naval Commission of 1904. He was full of great policies\r\nhere, there and everywhere. What had they resulted in? The humiliation\r\nof France and the Conference of Algeciras. Clemenceau was evidently\r\nmuch incensed. The fact that he had been obliged, as he thought, by\r\nGermany's action, to follow M. Delcassé's Moroccan tactics rendered\r\nthe position exceptionally awkward. It raised the whole question of\r\nM. Delcassé's foreign policy. This gave him a great advantage when\r\nit came to direct political warfare. For M. Delcassé was considered,\r\neven by those who opposed him, as the victim of German hatred, since\r\nhe had refused to surrender to German threats and was sacrificed\r\nsimply because France dared not face a war. So when he recounted his\r\nagreement with Spain, his agreement with Italy, his agreement--\"too\r\nlong delayed\"--with England, his mediation in the Spanish-American War\r\nand his Treaties of Arbitration, the Assembly went with him. Then, too,\r\nhis assaults upon Clemenceau raised the fighting spirit on Delcassé's\r\nside. The feeling was: \"This time Clemenceau is getting as good as he\r\nbrings.\" The Prime Minister has not done his duty either as President\r\nof the Inquiry or as President of Council. \"I say to him as he said to\r\nJules Ferry: 'Get out. We won't discuss with you the great interests of\r\nthis nation.'\"\r\n\r\nVery good sword-play. But had Clemenceau kept cool, as he certainly\r\nwould have done on the duel ground, there might have been no harm\r\ndone. However, he burst out into furious denunciation, exasperated by\r\nthe ringing cheers which greeted his opponent's conclusion. It was M.\r\nDelcassé's fault that France had to go to Algeciras. M. Delcassé would\r\nhave carried things with a high hand. \"But the army was not ready,\r\nthe navy was not ready. I have not humiliated France: M. Delcassé\r\nhas humiliated her.\" A purely personal note, disclosing facts that\r\nwere the more bitter to the Assembly inasmuch that they were true. It\r\nwas indecent--that was the sensation that ran round the House--for\r\na Premier thus to expose the weakness of his country on a personal\r\nissue, no matter what provocation he may have received. The hostile\r\nvote, therefore, was given against Clemenceau himself, not against his\r\nGovernment, and he promptly resigned.\r\n\r\nHad he desired to bring about his own overthrow he would have acted\r\nprecisely as he did; and some thought that this was his intention.\r\nIt was an unworthy conclusion to a Premiership which, whatever its\r\nshortcomings, had done extremely good work for the Republic, and to\r\na Government which had lasted longer than any French Administration\r\nsince the downfall of the Empire. The character and leadership of the\r\nMinistry under M. Briand, which succeeded Clemenceau's Cabinet, proved\r\nthat only by his own fault had he ensured his official downfall.\r\n\r\nAs usual, he turned round at once to other work, and accepted an\r\nengagement to speak throughout South America, publishing a pleasant\r\nrecord of his experiences in an agreeably written book. The Prime\r\nMinister of yesterday was the genial lecturer the day after.\r\n\r\n NOTE.--It was said at the time that M. Briand's intrigues in the\r\n lobbies were the real cause of Clemenceau's defeat and resignation.\r\n Lately this has been confirmed to me on good authority. At any rate,\r\n M. Briand benefited. It was he who succeeded his chief.\r\n\r\n                                                          H. M. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                        CLEMENCEAU AND GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nClemenceau flung himself out of office in an unreasonable fit of\r\ntemper. A man of his time of life, at sixty-eight years of age, with\r\nhis record behind him, had no right to have any personal temper\r\nat all, when the destinies of his country had been placed in his\r\nhands. Probably he would admit this himself to-day. But, during his\r\nexceptionally strenuous period of office, he had, as we have seen, more\r\nthan once shown an impulsiveness and even an irritability that were not\r\nconsonant with his general disposition. Throughout, there appeared to\r\nbe an inclination on his part to take opposition and criticism too much\r\nto heart. As if, in fact, the great Radical overthrower of opportunism\r\nwas annoyed at being compelled, as all administrations must be, to\r\nadopt to some extent a policy of opportunism himself. His outburst\r\nagainst all compromise with the Church was one instance of this.\r\nHis uncalled-for resignation on account of M. Delcassé's attack was\r\nanother. This might well have been the end of his official experiences.\r\nCertainly no one would have ventured to predict that eight years later\r\nwould come the crowning achievement of his remarkable career. His own\r\nremark on leaving office was not calculated to encourage his personal\r\nadherents or to give his country confidence in his leadership. \"I came\r\nin with an umbrella, I go out with a stick,\" was all very well as the\r\nepigram of a journalist: it was too flippant a remark for a serious\r\nstatesman such as Clemenceau had shown himself to be. But the time was\r\nnot far off when all his main policy, as man of affairs, politician,\r\nand as publicist would be overwhelmingly justified. As we have seen,\r\nClemenceau was all his life strongly opposed to colonial expansion.\r\nHis action with regard to Morocco, apparently so contrary to this,\r\narose from an even stronger motive, his desire to build up French\r\ndefence against Germany on every side.\r\n\r\nBut his general distrust of colonisation by conquest in Egypt, China,\r\nMadagascar, and elsewhere had been based upon France's need for using\r\nall her strength and all her resources to build up the power of the\r\nFrench Republic within the limits of France. This is true of all\r\nnations at a period when the power of man over nature is increasing\r\nso rapidly in every department: perhaps, properly understood, in\r\nagriculture most of all, when science is capably applied to production\r\non the land. That is to say, that even in countries such as England,\r\nwhere the cry of over-population is so frequently raised, and where the\r\ncult of colonisation and emigration has been exalted to the position of\r\na fetish, it would be far better to devote attention to the creation\r\nof wealth at home than to the development of waste lands, however\r\nfertile, abroad. Concentration of population, given adequate regulation\r\nof employment in the interests of the whole people, and attention to\r\nthe requirements of space, air and health, is not only devoid of danger\r\nbut is an element in national prosperity--\"nothing being more plain\r\nthan that men in proper labour and employment are capable of earning\r\nmore than a living,\" as John Bellers wrote more than two hundred years\r\nago; and \"a nation wherein are eight millions of people is more than\r\ntwice as rich as the same scope of land wherein are but four,\" as Petty\r\nwisely stated, about the same date.\r\n\r\nIf this was so obviously true at the end of the seventeenth century, it\r\nis tenfold, not to say a hundredfold, more certain in the twentieth,\r\nhaving regard to the marvellous discoveries and inventions since made\r\nand still but partially applied in every direction. But France is the\r\nland where such considerations are most decisive in dealing with the\r\nbasis of national polity. France has enormous advantages in regard\r\nto soil, climate, the industrious habits and skill of her people,\r\nand the consequent monopoly on the world market of whole branches\r\nof commerce, where taste and luxury have to be gratified. Moreover,\r\nshe possesses a source of income unparalleled in Europe and scarcely\r\nworth noting elsewhere, except in the case of Italy. I calculate that\r\nFrance receives, one year with another, from visitors who come thither,\r\nmerely to see and to spend, an amount, by way of profit, of not less\r\nthan seventy millions sterling. This large sum alone, if used for\r\nenhancing the productiveness of the French soil and French industry\r\ngenerally, would immensely benefit the people in every respect. French\r\nthrift, again, had piled up out of the products of industry immense\r\npecuniary accumulations. There could have been no better investment of\r\nthese funds possible than the improvement of the defences of France\r\nagainst invasion, the completion of her railway and canal system,\r\nthe development of her mines, so greatly coveted by her aggressive\r\nneighbour, the concentration of her military and naval forces at home,\r\ninstead of scattering any portion of them abroad, the expenditure\r\nupon thorough education and scientific agricultural and industrial\r\nexperiments. All this even Imperialist Frenchmen can see now.\r\n\r\nSo with regard to Russia. The alliance of the French Republic with the\r\nEmpire of Russia gave France, apparently, a better position in Europe,\r\nthe pusillanimous and short-sighted English statesmen having rejected\r\nan alliance which was afterwards forced upon Great Britain when wholly\r\nunprepared for war. Here also Clemenceau's views were justified by\r\nthe event. The close connection between a democratic Republic and an\r\nautocratic Empire put France in an unenviable moral position before\r\nthe world. More materially serious than this ill-fated combination,\r\nethically, was the necessity imposed upon the French of lending\r\ncontinually to Russia, until the total amount of the Russian loans held\r\nin France amounted to many hundreds of millions sterling.\r\n\r\nSuch huge sums, again, would have been far more advantageously spent\r\nat home than in building strategical and other railways, and financing\r\ngold and other mines, in the vast Muscovite Empire. Financiers gained\r\nlargely by these loans. But the peasants and small bourgeoisie\r\nof France were unknowingly dependent for their interest upon a\r\npoverty-stricken agricultural population, which could not possibly\r\ncontinue to pay the large sum due yearly on this amount to their\r\nWestern creditors without utter ruin. Thus unsound finance followed\r\nhard on the heels of more than doubtful policy, and France was the\r\nweaker and the poorer for both.\r\n\r\nThis was all the more fatal to real French interests, inasmuch that,\r\nat the same time, the home population of the Republic was slowly\r\ndecreasing, while the population of her threatening rival, Germany,\r\nwas steadily growing, and the wealth of the German Empire, both\r\nagricultural and mineral, was likewise rapidly expanding with every\r\ndecade. Consequently, the position of France was becoming more and\r\nmore precarious, and the relative strength on the two sides of the\r\nfrontier less and less favourable to the Republic. It must be admitted,\r\nunder such circumstances, that those who favoured a Russian alliance,\r\nin spite of all its manifest drawbacks, had a great deal to say for\r\nthemselves. But that Great Britain should have failed to see that\r\nthe declension of French power was a peril to herself, long before\r\nthe _Entente_ was brought about by Edward VII, and that a pacific\r\nunderstanding alone was not sufficient to ensure the maintenance of\r\npeace, is a truly marvellous instance of the blindness of British\r\nstatesmanship! Only the phenomenal good luck that has so far attended\r\nthe United Kingdom hindered our governing classes from landing this\r\ncountry, as well as the French, in overwhelming disaster. How narrow\r\nthe escape was is not yet fully understood.\r\n\r\nClemenceau was at all times in favour of an Anglo-French offensive and\r\ndefensive alliance, and he clung to this policy in the face of the most\r\nserious discouragement from abroad and, as has been seen, at the cost\r\nof vitriolic misrepresentation and hatred at home. It was in vain,\r\nhowever, that for many years he preached this political doctrine. Even\r\nwhen the relations between the two countries were greatly improved, the\r\nvery proper Liberal and Radical and Labour dislike in England of the\r\nentanglement with Czarist Russia rendered the close combination which\r\nseemed so essential to all who, like Clemenceau himself, knew what was\r\nreally going on in Germany, exceedingly difficult to bring about.\r\n\r\nThe terrific war has thrown into high relief facts always discernible\r\nexcept by those who would not see. Here Clemenceau's own bitter\r\nexperience of the war of 1870-71, and his yearly visits to Austria,\r\nenabled him to form a clearer conception of the real policy of Germany\r\nand the ruthless brutality which underlies modern Teutonic culture\r\nthan any of his contemporaries. It is no longer doubted that the\r\nFranco-German war was welcomed by Prince Bismarck, and made inevitable\r\nby him, in order to crush France and ensure German military supremacy\r\nin Europe. Bismarck himself made no secret of the manner in which he\r\nhad deceived Benedetti at Ems by a forged telegram; and the refusal of\r\nthe Germans to make a reasonable peace with France immediately after\r\nSedan was conclusive evidence of what was really intended. During the\r\ncampaign, also, the Germans resorted to the same hideous methods of\r\nwarfare on land, on a smaller scale, which have horrified the entire\r\ncivilised world, on land and on sea, during the great war which\r\ncommenced forty-four years later.\r\n\r\nAll this Clemenceau himself saw. While, therefore, in his speeches\r\nand writings, he never shut out the possibility that the people of\r\nGermany, rising superior to their militarist rulers, might come to\r\nterms for permanent peace with the people of France, he at the same\r\ntime cherished no illusions whatever as to the policy of those military\r\nrulers, and the small probability that German Social-Democracy would be\r\nable to thwart the designs of the German aggressionists. Unfortunately,\r\nin France, as in Great Britain, a considerable section of all classes,\r\nbut especially of the working class, represented by Labour Unions and\r\nSocialists, would not believe that at the end of the nineteenth and\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century any great civilised power could\r\nbe harbouring such designs as those attributed to Germany. Vaillant,\r\nfor example, who, like Clemenceau, had seen the horrors inflicted upon\r\nFrance in the war of 1870, was vehement on that side. So enamoured was\r\nhe of peace that he never lost a chance of assuring Germany that under\r\nno circumstances would the French Republic go to war. He advocated a\r\ngeneral strike, in all countries affected, should a rupture of peace be\r\nthreatened; entirely regardless of the fact that the Social-Democrats\r\nthemselves had declared that such a strike was absolutely impossible in\r\nGermany itself.\r\n\r\nThe same with Jaurès. Not only did this great Socialist believe that\r\npeace might be maintained by concessions to Germany; but, although\r\nin favour of \"the Armed Nation\" for France herself, for the purpose\r\nof defending her against a German invasion, he actually came over to\r\nLondon and addressed a great meeting, called by anarchist-pacifists who\r\nwere all strongly in favour of the reduction of the British fleet. That\r\nfleet which, as Bebel himself put it, was the only counterbalance in\r\nEurope for Germany herself against Prussian militarism and Junkerdom,\r\nJaurès spoke of with regret as a provocation to war! Germany could, in\r\nfact, always rely in all countries upon a large number of perfectly\r\nhonest pro-Germans, and a lesser proportion who had purely financial\r\nconsiderations in view, to oppose any policy which was directed\r\nagainst the spread of German domination. This was the mania of\r\nanarchist-pacifism and anti-patriotism which Clemenceau, both in and\r\nout of office, did his utmost to expose and resist. Honesty of purpose\r\ncould be no excuse whatever for fatuity of action.\r\n\r\nClemenceau, therefore, from the moment when he gave up the Premiership,\r\nlost no chance of inculcating the need for vigorous preparation. France\r\nmust be ready to meet a German assault by land and by sea. When the\r\ntime came she was not ready on either element, and without the help in\r\nfinance, in munitions, in clothing, and by arms, on land and on the\r\nocean, at once given by England--whom Clemenceau always upheld as the\r\nfriend of the Republic--France would have been overrun and crushed,\r\nbefore she could possibly have obtained aid from elsewhere. In spite of\r\nthe Franco-German agreement of 1909, the danger of such an attack in\r\n1911 was very great: so much so that war was then commonly expected,\r\nand was only averted because Germany thought she would be in a more\r\ncommanding position to carry out her predetermined policy three or\r\nfour years later. The Franco-German Convention relating to Morocco, of\r\nNovember 4th, 1911, after the Agadir difficulty, was no better than a\r\npretence. It was not intended, in good faith, to ensure a permanent\r\npeace, so far as Germany was concerned. This Clemenceau felt sure of,\r\nthough the treaty was by no means unfavourable to France. He was ready\r\nto make all sacrifices, however mortifying, provided only a genuine\r\ntreaty of peace and understanding between the two peoples could be\r\nsecured. But this must not be done blindly. It must be an integral part\r\nof a serious national policy.\r\n\r\nTherefore, speaking in the Senate on the 12th February, 1912, in\r\nopposition to the treaty with Germany about Morocco, he went on: \"We\r\nshall make every effort to give fresh proofs of our goodwill--we have\r\ngiven enough and to spare already during the past forty years--in order\r\nthat the consequences of this treaty may fructify under conditions\r\nworthy of the dignity of the two peoples; but we must know what the\r\nother party to the treaty is about, what are his intentions, what he\r\nthinks, says, proposes to do, and what signs of goodwill _he_ likewise\r\nhas vouchsafed. That is the question we must have the courage to ask\r\nourselves. This question I deal with at my own risk and peril, without\r\nbeing concerned as to what I have to say, because I have at heart no\r\nbad feeling, no hatred, to use the right word, towards the German\r\npeople. I want no provocation; firmly resolved as I am to do nothing\r\nto sacrifice a vestige, however trifling, of our capacity to win if\r\nattacked, I am equally convinced that peace is not only desirable\r\nbut necessary for the development of French ideas in the domain of\r\ncivilisation. . . . The German people won two great victories which\r\nchanged the equilibrium of Europe, in 1866 and in 1870. . . . _We\r\nthen knew, we had the actual proof in our hands, that, if the enemy\r\nhad occupied Paris, the capital of France would have been reduced\r\nto ashes._ Prince Bismarck, in reply to the expostulations of Jules\r\nFavre, declared that the German troops must enter at one of the gates,\r\n'because I do not wish, when I get home, that a man who has lost a\r\nleg or an arm should be able to say to his comrades, pointing to me:\r\nThat fellow you see there is the man who prevented me from entering\r\nParis.' When Jules Favre said that the German Army had glory enough\r\nwithout that, M. Bismarck retorted, 'Glory! we don't use that word.'\r\nThe German, so far as I can judge of him, is above all the worshipper\r\nof force, and rarely misses an opportunity of saying so; but where he\r\ndiffers from the Latin is that his first thought is to make use of this\r\nforce. As the vast economic development of the Empire is a perpetual\r\ntemptation in this respect, he wants the French to understand that\r\nbehind every German trader there stands an army of five millions of\r\nmen. That is at the bottom of the whole thing.\" Moreover, he continued,\r\nhaving pocketed a fine indemnity last time, Germany is greedy for a\r\nmuch bigger one now. \"Even quite lately the German Press has never\r\nwearied of proclaiming that France shall pay out of her milliards\r\nthe cost of building the new German fleet. That is the frame of mind\r\nof Germany, that is the truth which clearly appears in your treaty:\r\nGermany thinks first and foremost of using to advantage her glory and\r\nher force.\r\n\r\n\"But this is not all. She has conquered her unity by force, by iron,\r\nby blood; she has so fervently yearned for this unity--nothing more\r\nnatural--that now she wants to apply it; she wishes to spread her\r\nsurplus population over the world. She finds herself compelled,\r\ntherefore, by a fatality from which she cannot escape, to exercise\r\npressure upon her neighbours which will compel them to give her the\r\neconomic outlets she needs. . . . There is always land for an owner who\r\nwishes to round off his estate. There are always nations to be attacked\r\nby a warrior-nation which would conquer other peoples. I am not here\r\nfor the purpose of criticising the German people, I am trying to\r\ndescribe their state of mind towards us. . . .\r\n\r\n\"And now what of us, the French people? The people of France are\r\na people of idealism, of criticism, of indiscipline, of wars, of\r\nrevolutions. Our character is ill adapted for continuous action;\r\ndoubtless the French people have magnificent impulses, but, as the poet\r\nsays, their height has ever been measured by the depth of their fall.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a survey of \"the terrible year\" and its results, the orator\r\nrecounts what difficult work it was that Frenchmen had to carry out\r\nafter the collapse. It was not only that they had to change their\r\nGovernment, but this Government must be taught how to govern itself.\r\n\r\n\"That has created a hard situation for us. We are absorbed in this\r\ngreat task. We hope to bring it to a successful conclusion. The\r\nintervention of public opinion to-day in its own affairs, calmly,\r\nsoberly, without a word of braggadocio, that is one of the best signs\r\nthat France has yet given.\r\n\r\n\"The work we have done must be judged not by what we see but by the\r\nideas, the spirit that we have breathed into the heart of all French\r\ncitizens.\"\r\n\r\nAfter giving conclusive proof that in 1875, in the Schnäbele affair, as\r\nwell as at Tangier, Morocco and Casablanca, Germany's policy had been\r\nto wound, weaken and irritate France, Clemenceau wound up as follows:\r\n\r\n\"In all good faith we desire peace, we are eager for peace because we\r\nneed it in order to build up our country. But if war is forced upon\r\nus we shall be there! The difficulty between Germany and ourselves\r\nis this: Germany believes the logical consequence of her victory is\r\ndomination. We do not believe that the logical consequence of our\r\ndefeat is vassalage. We are peaceful but we are not subjugated. We do\r\nnot countersign the decree of abdication and downfall issued by our\r\nneighbours. We come of a great history and we mean to continue to be\r\nworthy of it. The dead have created the living: the living will remain\r\nfaithful to the dead.\"\r\n\r\nThis great speech was prophetic. Clemenceau knew what were the real\r\nintentions of Germany. It was this fact that made him so bitter\r\nagainst all who, honest, patriotic and self-sacrificing as they might\r\nbe, were in favour of weakening France in the hour of her greatest\r\ndanger. His warning against the financiers who were so solicitous that\r\nforeign policy should be guided by manipulators of loans, interest\r\nand discounts was also specially appropriate at a time when German\r\ninfluence was becoming dominant in many of the banks and pecuniary\r\ncoteries of Paris. Such warnings were also timely in view of the\r\nstrange hallucinations--or worse--which then dominated English\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nFor it was in this same year that Lord Haldane, having reduced the\r\nEnglish artillery, full of sublime confidence in the rulers of Germany,\r\nreturned from Berlin to tell us through Mr. Asquith and Viscount Grey\r\nthat never were the relations between Germany and England better!\r\nIt was in this same year, too, that Mr. Lloyd George and the whole\r\nRadical Party were convinced that Great Britain might safely reduce her\r\narmaments on land and on sea, and the Unionists themselves scarcely\r\ndared to take up the challenge. It was in this same year, again, that\r\nnearly all the leaders of the Labour Party convinced themselves that\r\nthe Germans had the best of good feeling towards France and England.\r\nHaving been most artistically and hospitably \"put through\" in the\r\nFatherland, they returned to England brimful of zeal against all who,\r\nknowing Germany and Germans well for some fifty years, could not take\r\nthe asseverations of the Kaiser, or of his trusted friend Lord Haldane,\r\nat their face value: a value which this legal nobleman admitted a few\r\nyears later he knew at the time to be illusory, and not in accordance\r\nwith what he then declared to be the truth.\r\n\r\nClemenceau did not condescend to such shameless falsification. Whatever\r\nmistakes he made, from the Socialist and anti-Imperialist point of\r\nview, in matters of domestic importance, or concerning Morocco, where\r\nthe danger of France from the other side of the frontier had to be\r\nconsidered, whether in office or out of it, he treated his countrymen\r\nwith the utmost frankness.\r\n\r\nSo time passed on. The preparations of Germany were becoming more\r\nand more complete. The influence of the pan-German Junkers and their\r\nflamboyant young Crown Prince was becoming so powerful that the Kaiser\r\nfelt his hand being forced before success in \"the great design\"\r\nappeared quite so certain as he would like it to be. The German army\r\nwas largely increased, powerful war-vessels were being added to the\r\nnavy. A policy was being pursued which roused fears of aggression.\r\nAll through 1913 and the first months of 1914 Clemenceau in his new\r\npaper, _L'Homme Libre_, continued day after day his warnings and his\r\ninjunctions to all Frenchmen. He had no mercy for those who unceasingly\r\npreached fraternity and disarmament for France when Germany, more\r\npowerful and increasingly more populous, was arming to the teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Such fraternity,\" he said, at the unveiling of Scheurer-Kestner's\r\nstatue, \"is of the Cain and Abel kind. Against the armed peace and\r\narmed fraternity with which Germany is threatening us nothing short\r\nof the most perfect military education and military organisation can\r\nbe of any avail. All Europe knows, and Germany herself has no doubt\r\nwhatever, that we are solely on the defensive. Her fury for the\r\nleadership of Europe decrees for her a policy of extermination against\r\nFrance. Therefore prepare, prepare, prepare. Here you see 870,000 men\r\nin the active army of Germany on a peace footing, better trained,\r\nbetter equipped, better organised than ours, as opposed to 480,000\r\nFrenchmen on our side. Doesn't that convince you? And Alsace-Lorraine\r\nat the mercy of such creatures as Schadt and Förstner? Observe,\r\nGermany has great projects in all parts of the world. It would be\r\nchildish for us to complain. What is intolerable is her pretension to\r\nkeep Europe in perpetual terror of a general war, instead of general\r\ninternational discussion of her claims. Every Frenchman must remember\r\nthat, if Germany's increasing armaments do impel her to war, the loss\r\nof the conflict would mean for us the subjugation of our race, nay,\r\neven the termination of our history. Meanwhile, with Alsace-Lorraine\r\nbefore me and the statue of Scheurer-Kestner now unveiled, I claim for\r\nus the right never to forget. To be or not to be, that is for us the\r\nquestion of the hour. Gambetta, after Sedan, called upon all Frenchmen\r\nin their day of deepest depression to rise to the level of their duty.\r\nHe consecrated once again Republicans as the party of patriotic pride.\r\nFrance must live. Live we will!\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, one of the chief reasons why France was unready to\r\nmeet the onrush of the modern Huns was that the Socialists were all\r\nbemused with their own fatuous notion that the German Social-Democracy\r\ncould stop the war. Instead, therefore, of investigating the truth of\r\nClemenceau's statements, they merely denounced him as a chauvinist and\r\nan enemy of the people, and twaddled on about a general strike on both\r\nsides of the Rhine. As an old Socialist myself, who, as a member of\r\nthe International Socialist Bureau, had discussed the whole question\r\nat length with Liebknecht, Bebel, Singer, Kautsky and others, I knew\r\nthat, as they themselves explained to me, there was little or no hope\r\nof anything of the sort being done when war was once declared. I viewed\r\nthis whole propaganda, therefore, with grave alarm, and Bebel himself\r\nwarned the French that the Social-Democrats would march with the rest.\r\nIf an opportunity came something might be done, but----Since then\r\nthe old leaders had died and the new chiefs, as we all see now, were\r\nImperialists to a man. Thus Clemenceau's prognostications and warnings\r\nwere only too completely justified. Prince Lichnowsky's revelations\r\nconclusively prove this, and the German Social-Democrats have been at\r\npains to confirm it. On March 11th, 1914, Clemenceau stated precisely\r\nwhat they would do.\r\n\r\nHow anxious, how eager, the French were at the critical moment to avoid\r\neven the slightest cause of offence is shown by the fact that all their\r\ntroops were withdrawn fully eight miles back along the German frontier,\r\na portion of French territory which the Germans made haste to seize.\r\nEven before this, every effort was made to provoke the French troops\r\nby petty raids across the frontier, and at last the Germans declared\r\nthat the French had sent aeroplanes to drop bombs on Nuremberg--a\r\nstatement which the Germans themselves now admit to have been a pure\r\nfabrication. But the facts of the invasion of Belgium and France are\r\ntoo well known to call for recital here.\r\n\r\nClemenceau did what might have been expected of him. He appealed to\r\nall Frenchmen of every shade of opinion to sink all minor differences\r\nin one solid combination for the defence of the country. Day after\r\nday, this powerful journalist and orator laboured to encourage\r\nhis countrymen and to denounce unceasingly all who, honestly or\r\ndishonestly, stood in the way of the vigorous and successful\r\nprosecution of the war which should free France for ever from yet\r\nother attempts by Germany to destroy her as an independent nation.\r\nThe memory of the dark days of 1870 was obliterated by the horrors of\r\n1914 onwards. In good and bad fortune the Radical leader kept the same\r\nresolute attitude and used the like stirring language. _L'Homme Libre_,\r\ndefaced and then suppressed by the Censor, was succeeded by _L'Homme\r\nEnchaîné_. Ever the same policy of relentless warfare, against the\r\nenemy at the front, and the traitors at the rear, was steadily pursued.\r\nMinistry might come, Ministry might go, but still Clemenceau was at his\r\npost, save when illness compelled him to quit his work for a short time.\r\n\r\nNor did he waver in his views as to the general strategy to be pursued.\r\nWithout making any pretence to military knowledge, but well advised by\r\nexperts on military affairs, and firmly convinced that whatever success\r\nGermany might achieve elsewhere she would never be satisfied unless\r\nFrance was crushed, he persistently opposed diversion of strength from\r\nthe Western front. _There_ this terrific struggle for world-domination\r\nwould eventually be decided. The civilisation of the West must be\r\nsubdued to German culture, France and England must be brought under\r\nGerman control, before the great programme of Eastern expansion for the\r\nTeutonic Empire could be entered upon with the certainty of success.\r\nThese were the opinions he held as to Germany's real objects.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in opposition to the views of important personages in Great\r\nBritain and in Allied countries, Clemenceau withstood any frittering\r\naway of force on tempting adventures, away from the main field of\r\nwarfare. This not because he confined himself to the narrow programme\r\nof freeing France from the invaders, but because the waste of troops\r\non wild-cat enterprises weakened the general strength of the Allies at\r\nthe crucial point of the whole struggle. In that decision his judgment\r\nwas at one with the ablest British strategists, and the event has\r\nshown that he did not underrate the importance of the warfare on the\r\nWestern front. There alone, especially after the collapse of Russia,\r\nwas it possible to deliver a crushing blow at the German power. There\r\nalone could all the forces of the Allies of the West be effectively\r\nconcentrated for the final blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                             THE GREAT WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe events of the great war, from 1914 onwards, are too recent and\r\ntoo deeply graven on all our minds to call for lengthy recital or\r\ncriticism. What many, if not most, people believed to be outside the\r\nlimits of calculation occurred. The German armies commenced their\r\ncampaign by outraging the neutrality of Belgium, which, in 1870, even\r\nBismarck had respected. In a few days they crashed down the great\r\nBelgian fortresses, which capable experts had calculated would check\r\nthe Teutonic advance for at least a month, with howitzers specially\r\nconstructed and tested for that purpose; soon they exhausted the\r\nresources of barbarism in torturing, butchering and shooting down\r\nunarmed men, women and children whose country they had solemnly sworn\r\nto safeguard; and they devastated and destroyed homes, beautiful\r\nbuildings, and great libraries, which even a Turcoman horde might\r\nhave spared, and extorted tremendous ransom and blood-money from the\r\ndefenceless inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThat accomplished, this torrent of ruffianism and infamy poured in upon\r\nFrance with almost irresistible fury. The horrors of 1870-71 were far\r\noutdone. The defeats of Mons, Charleroi and Metz, the impossibility\r\nthat their opponents should resist such overwhelming odds, made the\r\nGermans believe that for the second time in half a century they would\r\nforce Paris to surrender. Then they were prepared to wreak upon the\r\ngreat city, the social capital of Europe, the full vengeance of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy, even for those who remember what occurred in the\r\nterrible year of the downfall of the Second Empire, and the prostration\r\nof the French Republic before the German invaders, to imagine what\r\nwere the feelings of all Frenchmen who went through that period of\r\nmartyrdom for their country when they saw a still worse storm of\r\nbrutality and hatred breaking out upon them--when, too, more rapidly\r\nthan before, Amiens was in danger and Paris seriously threatened.\r\nClemenceau, with his devotion to France and almost worship of the city\r\nwhere he had spent his whole manhood, was more hardly hit than perhaps\r\nany of his countrymen. He had experienced the horrors of the former\r\ninvasion; and though, when France was at its lowest, he never despaired\r\nof the Republic, no ordinary man of seventy-three could possess the\r\nresource and resilience of a man of thirty.\r\n\r\nYet Clemenceau showed little loss of vigour compared with his former\r\nself. No Englishman has ever undergone what he underwent at that\r\nperiod. Undoubtedly, when the news came to us of the great retreat of\r\nAugust, 1914, our heartfelt sympathy went out to our own men. We were\r\nall likewise full of admiration for our French comrades who still held\r\nthe Franco-British line unbroken. But at least our hearths and homes\r\nwere kept in safety for us--the raids of aircraft excepted--by the\r\nmagnificent courage of our sailors in the North Sea and of our soldiers\r\nwho freely gave their lives to protect us from the enemy. If we would\r\nfully appreciate what was happening to France and Belgium, in spite\r\nof all their efforts, we must imagine the county of Durham completely\r\noccupied by the German hordes, Yorkshire overrun and the chance of\r\nsaving London from the enemy dependent upon the result of a battle to\r\nbe fought in the neighbourhood of Cambridge. It would be well if we\r\ncould display at such a crisis in England the same cool courage that\r\nthe Parisians did; if we had generals at our disposal such as Joffre\r\nand Foch and Gallieni; and statesmen in reserve such as Clemenceau.\r\nThat was how things looked prior to the first battle of the Marne,\r\nwhich checked the early flood of German invasion and removed for the\r\ntime being the necessity for retiring from Amiens and Epernay and\r\nmoving the seat of government from Paris.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this trying period Clemenceau never lost heart\r\nfor a moment, nor his head either; and day after day in his journal\r\nhe surveyed the whole situation without fear, devoid of illusion,\r\nyet confident always that France and her Allies could not be beaten\r\nto their knees. When things looked worst and Paris was being drained\r\nof her population by order, in preparation for a siege, and when the\r\nGovernment was about to be removed to Bordeaux, this is how Clemenceau\r\nwrote, recalling the past to cheer his countrymen in the present:\r\n\r\n\"The seat of government at Bordeaux is a new phase of the war which\r\nmust follow its course: a renewal of the war in the Provinces, as in\r\nthe days of the Gambettas, of the Freycinets. The same struggle against\r\nthe same German invasion, with the capital of France reduced to the\r\nsimple condition of a fortress, with France herself--provincial France,\r\nas we say--taking in hand her own defence outside the traditional lines\r\nof political and administrative concentration in which she has lived.\r\n\r\n\"How men and times have changed! . . . And now after full\r\nfour-and-forty years I find myself again at Bordeaux, before the\r\ntheatre I had not seen since 1871, looking for men who had undergone\r\nthe misery of survival and failing to find them. Who now remembers that\r\nJules Simon on his arrival had in his pocket an order for the arrest\r\nof Gambetta? In the Provinces, as in Paris, foreign war and civil war\r\nwere being carried on. I only recall these terrible memories of past\r\ndissensions to enhance the value of the magnificent consolation that\r\nuplifts our hearts at the spectacle of the truly fraternal union of all\r\nthe Frenchmen of to-day. Gambetta maintained the war against invasion\r\nin the midst of the most cruel attacks of a merciless opposition.\r\nCompare this with the present attitude of all parties in the presence\r\nof a Government from which all only demand that every means should be\r\nused with the maximum of efficiency.\" Nor does the writer hesitate\r\neven at this moment of trial to criticise the shortcomings of his\r\ncountrymen. As opposed to the persistent preparations of Germany,\r\nFrenchmen, he says, have been too careless, too light-hearted, too apt\r\nto rely upon the inspiration and enthusiasm of the moment to repair\r\ntheir neglect, \"while an implacable enemy was sharpening his sword\r\nagainst us with unwearying zeal.\" And this had been proved to be the\r\ntruth years before; while so lately as November 22nd, 1913, the French\r\nAmbassador in Berlin, M. Jules Cambon, had solemnly warned M. Pichon,\r\nthen as now French Minister for Foreign Affairs, \"For some time past\r\nhostility against us is more marked, and the Emperor has ceased to be a\r\npartisan of peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe man who used his pen to tell Frenchmen disagreeable truths in\r\nthis wise and followed them up by giving chapter and verse from the\r\nFrench Yellow Book, with the text of the threatening conversations\r\nof the Emperor and General von Moltke with the King of the Belgians,\r\nmay be granted the credit of entirely disregarding his own political\r\ninterests, at least.\r\n\r\nSo also when the Anglo-French forces had won the great seven days'\r\nbattle on the Marne, Clemenceau at once uttered a note of warning\r\nagainst undue confidence and excessive elation. \"Let us be very careful\r\nnot to believe that we can reckon upon an uninterrupted series of\r\nsuccesses up to the final destruction of the aggressor. The curtain\r\nfalls on the horrible scenes of foreign invasion in Belgium and\r\nFrance. A mortal blow has been inflicted upon the invincible Kaiser\r\nwho had never fought a battle. . . . But it would be sheer madness to\r\nimagine that we have nearly finished with an enemy who will shortly\r\nobtain fresh forces, vast forces even, from his uninvaded territory.\r\nA great part of his military resources are still untouched. Automatic\r\ndiscipline will soon reassert itself. The struggle will last very long\r\nyet and be full of unforeseen dangers. The stake is too heavy for the\r\nGerman Empire to decide suddenly to give up the game. Remember your\r\nmistakes of the past, rejoice soberly in your victory of the present,\r\nmake ready now for still heavier trials in the future.\" Such was the\r\ncounsel of Clemenceau to Frenchmen on September 15th, 1914. Above all,\r\n\"Leave nothing you can help to chance. Our military leaders have just\r\nvictoriously undergone racking anxieties. It is for us to show our\r\nconfidence in them by giving them credit for the patience and firmness\r\nwhich they will desperately need.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly in regard to the magnificent series of defensive victories\r\nat Verdun, of which Clemenceau gives a fine picturesque account.\r\nAfter justly glorifying the prowess of the heroic French soldiery,\r\nwhose chances of victory at the commencement of those long weeks\r\nof unceasing battle seemed small indeed; after bitter sarcasms on\r\nthe miserable Crown Prince with his premature jubilations over his\r\nsupreme carefully stage-managed \"triumph\"; after a terrible picture\r\nof masses of the German troops marching through a hurricane to what\r\nthey were assured was certain victory and then their dead bodies\r\nliterally kept erect by the pressure of their dead comrades as a mass\r\nof corpses--after all this, and his legitimate pride in the hardly won\r\nvictory, Clemenceau goes on to remind his countrymen again that this\r\nis not the end. \"Verdun is the greatest drama of resistance. But all,\r\nAll must at once set to work to make ready for a thorough offensive: a\r\ncomplete offensive that needs no interpretation. For this we must have\r\n_preparation_. For this we must have _science_. For this we must have\r\n_method_. For this we must have _manœuvres_. Keep those words well in\r\nmind, for nothing can be worse than to forget them. Never too soon:\r\nnever too late. What would be the cost to us, in our turn, of a _coup\r\nmanqué_?\"\r\n\r\nThat is the tone throughout. But here and there in _L'Homme Enchaîné_\r\nwe find Clemenceau the controversialist in a lighter, but not less\r\ntelling, style. I give an extract from his scathing attack on the\r\nDanish littérateur, M. Brandès, in the original:--\r\n\r\n\"Oui, retenez-le, lecteur, la crainte de M. Brandès dans les\r\ncirconstances actuelles est que l'Allemagne puisse être humiliée! Le\r\nDanemark a été humilié par le _peuple de seigneurs_ qu'est la race\r\nallemande. La France aussi, je crois, et la Belgique même; peut-être\r\nBrandès le reconnaitra-t-il. Il n'a pas protesté. Il refuse même de\r\ns'expliquer a cet égard, alléguant que son silence (assez prolixe)\r\nest d'or--d'un or qui ne résisterait pas à la pierre de touche. Mais\r\nsa crainte suprême est que les machinateurs du plus grand attentat\r\ncontre la civilisation, contre l'indépendance des peuples, contre la\r\ndignité de l'espèce humaine, les auteurs des épouvantables forfaits\r\ndont saignent encore la Belgique et la France n'éprouvent une\r\n_humiliation_.\"[B] Brandès among the neutrals is of the same type as\r\nRomain Rolland and Bertrand Russell among the belligerents. All their\r\nsympathies are reserved for the criminals. And there are others, who\r\nare actually eager to embrace the murderers as their \"German friends\"!\r\n\r\nIn quite another style is his tribute to Garibaldi when his son\r\nRicciotti--two of whose own sons had fallen fighting for France against\r\nthe Germans--was himself visiting Paris:--\r\n\r\n\"Garibaldi was one of those magicians who give their commands to the\r\npeoples. These are the true performers of miracles. For they take no\r\naccount of human powers when the spirit of superhumanity impels them\r\nto adventures of rash madness which for them prove to be evidence of\r\nsupreme sanity.\r\n\r\n\"Those who know, or think they know, talk. But words are not life.\r\nLiving humanity instinctively gives its devotion to men who rise up, in\r\nhistoric episodes whose law is to us unknown, to accomplish in their\r\nheroic simplicity precisely those very feats which 'reason' had never\r\nanticipated. To achieve this miracle calls for the man. It requires\r\nalso the historic moment. The hour struck, and Garibaldi was there.\r\nBut of that hour he himself was to a marvellous degree the mild yet\r\nimperious expression. Obviously inspired with an idea, he refused to\r\nsee obstacles or to recognise impossibilities. 'I shall go through with\r\nit,' and through he went. That seems simple enough to-day. How was it\r\nno one was found to do it before him? He went through with it, handing\r\nover the crown to royal supplicants, and then hid himself in his island\r\nto avoid the annoyance of his glory.\r\n\r\n\"He had given freedom. Let freedom do its work.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the struggle, even when the military situation\r\nlooked most desperate for the future of his country, Clemenceau never\r\nlost confidence. His faith in France and her steadfast ally Great\r\nBritain never wavered. That was a great service he then rendered to\r\nFrance and civilisation. But he did more. At a time when on the other\r\nside of the Channel, as in Great Britain, in Italy, and in Russia,\r\nthe national spirit was clouded by deep suspicion of enemy influence,\r\nbribery and corruption in high places, with almost criminal weakness,\r\nwhen strength and determination were essential to success, Clemenceau\r\ndid not hesitate to denounce treachery where he believed it to exist.\r\nNothing like his courage in this respect has, unfortunately, been\r\nshown by statesmen in any other of the Allied countries. The fact\r\nthat fomenters of reaction were, for their own ends, engaged on the\r\nlike task of exposing the men who were unworthy of the Republic did\r\nnot deter him, bitterly opposed as he was to the Royalist clique of\r\nwhich M. Léon Daudet was the chief spokesman, from demanding thorough\r\ninvestigation and the punishment of traitors, if traitors there were,\r\nin their midst. The time has not yet come to estimate the full value of\r\nthe work he thus did, or the dangers from which, by his frankness, he\r\nsaved the Republic.\r\n\r\nBut already we can form a judgment of the perils which surrounded\r\nFrance in 1917. The feeling of depression and distrust was growing. The\r\norganisation of the forces of the Allies was inferior to that of the\r\nenemy. The effect of the collapse of Russia was becoming more serious\r\neach day. Great Britain, which had rendered France quite invaluable\r\naid in all departments, had accepted Mr. Lloyd George's personal\r\nstrategy, which consisted in breaking through to the Rhine frontier by\r\nway of Jerusalem and Jericho, owing to the apparent hopelessness of a\r\nfavourable decision on the West front. The French Government itself,\r\nalarmed at the enormous sacrifices France was making in every way,\r\ndiscouraged at the progress of the defeatist movement which weakened\r\nthe position of Socialists in the Cabinet, and alarmed at the manner in\r\nwhich German agents and German spies, whom they were afraid to arrest,\r\npervaded almost every department--the French Government, itself shaken\r\ndaily by attacks from the Right and from the Left, felt incapable of\r\ndealing with the situation as a whole. There was, for a moment, a\r\nsensation in Paris not far removed from despair.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture a cry arose for Clemenceau. For many years he had\r\npredicted the German attack. For more than a full generation he had\r\nadjured his fellow-Frenchmen to prepare vigorously for the defence\r\nof _la Patrie_. That he feared nobody all were well aware. Of his\r\npatriotism there was no doubt. Then, as more than forty years before,\r\nhe never despaired of the Republic. Old as he was, whatever his defects\r\nof temper, whatever his shortcomings in other respects, the one man\r\nfor such a crisis was Georges Clemenceau. Office was thus forced upon\r\nhim, and, as he stated, he accepted power strongly against his will.\r\nAt seventy-six, and approaching seventy-seven, not the most ambitious\r\npolitician would be eager to take upon himself the responsibility of\r\ncoping with such difficulties as Clemenceau was called upon to face.\r\nIt was hard enough to undertake as Minister of War the onerous work of\r\nthat exhausting department.\r\n\r\nBut still more trying was the necessity imposed upon him of dealing\r\nwith the traitors of various degree who had been trading upon the\r\nlives and sacrifices of the men at the front. Probably no other French\r\nstatesman would have dared to enter upon this dangerous and difficult\r\ntask. The suspected men were highly placed, both politically and\r\nfinancially. They were surrounded by influential cliques and coteries,\r\nin Parliament and in the Press, to whom it was almost a matter of life\r\nand death to prevent disclosures which would inevitably be made, if the\r\nvarious cases were brought into court. It was even doubtful whether he\r\nwould get the support of the Assembly, the Senate, or the Presidents of\r\nCouncil who preceded him, if he decided to push things to extremity,\r\nas, in view of his own criticisms and denunciations, he was bound to\r\ndo. Should such misfortune occur or should the malefactors be indicted\r\nand acquitted, all that Clemenceau had been saying against them would\r\nturn to the advantage of the domestic enemy. It was a great risk to run.\r\n\r\nThere was also another obstacle in the way of Clemenceau's acceptance\r\nof the Premiership. The relations between himself and M. Poincaré,\r\nthe President of the Republic, had been anything but good. M.\r\nClemenceau had energetically championed the claim of M. Pams for the\r\nPresidency. M. Pams had been, in fact, M. Clemenceau's candidate, as\r\nMM. Sadi-Carnot, Loubet and Fallières had been before him. This time\r\nhe did not win. The fight was fierce, the personal animosity between\r\nthe parties very keen, and M. Poincaré's victory was asserted to have\r\nbeen achieved by intrigue of a doubtful character. The war had called\r\na truce to individual rancour, and the _union sacrée_ was supposed\r\nto inspire all hearts. Still it was by no means certain that trouble\r\nwould not come from that quarter. A President of Council with a hostile\r\nPresident of the Republic over against him must find the difficulty of\r\nthe post at such a time immensely increased.\r\n\r\nThen there were the Socialists to consider. True, they had taken\r\noffice in the Cabinet of M. Briand, whose policy towards strikers of\r\nanarchist methods had been even more stern than that of M. Clemenceau.\r\nBut they regarded Clemenceau as an unforgivable enemy. The calling in\r\nof the military at Courrières, at Narbonne, Montpellier and St. Béziers\r\nhad never been forgotten. Clemenceau for them was the Tiger crossed\r\nwith the Kalmuck. It was far more important, the French Socialists\r\napparently thought, to hamper Clemenceau and prevent him from forming\r\nan administration than it was to beat the German armies and clear\r\nFrance of the Boches. Such, at any rate, was the opinion of a minority,\r\nwhich afterwards became the majority, of the party. Therefore, even\r\nSocialists who thoroughly sympathised with Clemenceau in his policy\r\ntowards Germany, and had previously taken part in a Cabinet pledged to\r\ncarry on the war \"_jusqu'au bout_,\" would have nothing to do with a\r\nClemenceau Administration. The upshot of these fatuous, anti-patriotic\r\nand anti-Socialist tactics on their part will be seen later. Yet the\r\nknowledge that the Socialists as a whole would give him at best a\r\nlukewarm support, and at worst would vigorously oppose him, was not an\r\nencouraging factor in the general calculation of what might occur.\r\n\r\nNeither could high finance be relied upon. The great bankers, great\r\nbrokers, and great money institutions as a whole, were heartily sick of\r\nthe war. They wanted peace with Germany on almost any terms, if only\r\nthey could get back to business and begin to recoup their losses during\r\nmore than three years of war. Nor, apart from downright treachery of\r\nwhich he held positive proof, could the proposed new Premier close his\r\neyes to the fact that German influence had so subtly and thoroughly\r\npervaded the French money market that many Frenchmen were still looking\r\nat the economic problems of France through spectacles made and tinted\r\nin Germany.\r\n\r\nThere was consequently a combination possible which might drive\r\nClemenceau headlong out of office at any moment, if he entered upon his\r\nsecond attempt to control French affairs at such a desperately critical\r\nstage of the war.\r\n\r\nBut the formidable old Radical leader did not hesitate. Sceptic as he\r\nmight be in all else, one entity he did believe in: the unshakable\r\ngreatness of France: one Frenchman he could rely upon--himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                           THE ENEMY WITHIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the war, as for many years before the Germans\r\nbegan their great campaign of aggression, every country with which the\r\nFatherland might in any way be concerned was permeated with German\r\nagents and German spies. Great Britain was one of the nations specially\r\nfavoured in this respect. The ramifications of their systematic\r\ninterpenetration of the social, political, financial, commercial\r\nand even journalistic departments of our public life have never yet\r\nbeen fully exposed; nor, certainly, have the very important personages\r\nwho conducted this sinister propaganda been dealt with. Even when the\r\nDefence of the Realm Act is ended and the Censorship is abrogated, it\r\nis doubtful if the full truth will ever be generally known, so powerful\r\nare the influences directly interested in its suppression.\r\n\r\nIn the United States of America, where similar work was done upon an\r\nenormous scale and at vast expense, under circumstances still more\r\nfavourable to success than in this island, the American Government\r\nacted with a decision and a vigour that are not yet understood. Even\r\nso, the amount of mischief done was very great, and, for the first two\r\nyears of the war at least, the German efforts were largely successful.\r\nThat a duly accredited Ambassador to a friendly power should have been\r\nat the head of this vast conspiracy in America, as Count Bernstorff\r\nunquestionably was, introduces a new and most dangerous precedent into\r\nthe comity of international relations. Italy, in like manner, suffered\r\nvery seriously from German intrigues. The history of the carefully\r\norganised disaster upon the Isonzo has yet to be written. That it was\r\nthe result of well-arranged collaboration between clerical organisers\r\nof treachery, inspired by Austria, German agents, with unlimited\r\nfinancial backing, who had sympathisers in high place, and honest\r\nand dishonest fanatics of the pacifist persuasion, does not admit of\r\nquestion. Certain it is that in this one case alone German underground\r\nmachinations were responsible for the crushing defeat of an army of\r\n500,000 men, holding a position where 50,000 good troops could have\r\nheld a million at bay.[C]\r\n\r\nBut if Great Britain, the United States, and Italy were thus\r\nhoneycombed with secret service agents from Germany, the nation which\r\nthe Kaiser, his Chief of Staff and the Junkers were most anxious to\r\ncrush down beyond the possibility of recovery was still more imperilled\r\nby astute German infiltration. Up to the crisis of Agadir in 1911,\r\nFrench finance was, to an ever increasing extent, manipulated by German\r\nJews, who made it their special business to become more Parisian than\r\nthe Parisians themselves. They were consequently regarded with favour\r\nby people whose patriotism was beyond question. Scarcely a great\r\nFrench finance institution but had close relations in some form with\r\nGermans, whose continuous attention to business and excellent general\r\ninformation rendered them valuable coadjutors for the French, who, as\r\na rule, are not very exactly informed on foreign matters. Very few saw\r\nany danger in this. It seemed, indeed, a natural result of the great\r\ngrowth of German trade, as well as of the position which Germans had\r\nacquired as capable managers of the growing French factory industry in\r\nthe North-Eastern provinces.\r\n\r\nThis latter point is of importance. So long as any industry remains in\r\nthe old form, where individual skill, meticulous attention to detail,\r\nand close observance of quality are the rule, the French are second\r\nto none in their methods. But when the next stage is reached, and\r\nmachine production reigns on a very large scale, with its concomitant\r\nstandardisation of output, then the French seem to fail for lack of\r\nthe thorough organising faculty of the German or the American. Hence\r\nin many directions the highly educated, methodical, progressive\r\nforeigner from across the frontier had begun to take the place of the\r\nmore conservative Frenchman. This process could be observed in the\r\ndepartment of motor-cars, where the French, who were undoubtedly the\r\npioneers, had begun to fall behind upon the world market in the time\r\njust anterior to the war. Not only the Americans, but the Germans, and\r\neven Italy, showed more capacity to gauge the necessities of the coming\r\nperiod than France in their output of cars.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to this, Frenchmen, the most thrifty people in the\r\nworld, are disinclined to use their savings in the development of their\r\nown country. In literature, in science, in art, they display great\r\nfaculties of initiative. In the matter of investment they prefer to\r\nrely upon others. Even the underground railways of their metropolis\r\nwere started by a foreigner: the French investors only coming in to buy\r\nthe debentures of companies which they might just as well have started\r\nthemselves. They complained that the Germans were making vast profits\r\nout of \"their own\" iron mines of Lorraine which had been taken from\r\nFrance in an undeveloped state in 1871; yet they failed to exploit the\r\nstill richer deposits in Briey, of which the Germans were so envious\r\nthat the desire to possess them was one of the minor causes of the war.\r\nSimilar instances of neglected opportunities could be pointed out in\r\nmany districts.\r\n\r\nThis indifference of the thrifty French investors to the possibility\r\nof enriching their own country by the use at home of the money capital\r\nobtained from their own savings, and the profits derived from visitors,\r\nastonished lookers-on. Clemenceau denounced the folly of financial wars\r\nof conquest in semi-civilised countries when France needed her own\r\nresources for the improvement of her own soil and what underlay it, as\r\nwell as to make adequate preparation for war. But the loans to foreign\r\nnations and foreign banks were economically as prejudicial to her real\r\ninterests as the injurious colonial policy. That was proved only too\r\nclearly, even in the field of military preparation when, in August and\r\nSeptember, 1914, tens of thousands of men, unsupplied with clothing and\r\nequipment, were to be seen in and around Paris. England had to provide\r\nthem with what they required.\r\n\r\nIn such a state of affairs, where neglect of consideration as to the\r\npurposes of loans was the rule, so long as the interest seemed quite\r\nsecure, German banks could and did act with great advantage. They\r\nborrowed French savings at a low rate and employed them for profitable\r\nobjects, or for their own more complete war preparations on economical\r\nterms. After the shock of Agadir, when war at one period seemed\r\ncertain, the French called in most of their loans and thenceforward\r\nwere rather more cautious. But, in the meantime, and even afterwards,\r\nFrance's savings had been used to strengthen her bitterest enemy.\r\nAnd this was the end the Germans kept constantly in view when they\r\nborrowed. France, in fact, built up German credit against herself, at\r\nthe same time that Germany was able to estimate exactly the economic\r\npower of her destined victim, and to investigate, without appearing to\r\ndo so, the weak points in French preparation for defence. The German\r\nbanks and their French friends played together the same game, in a\r\ndifferent way, that the Deutsche Bank and the Dresdner Bank did in\r\nLondon and the Banca Commerciale in Italy. The whole formed part of the\r\nvast economic octopus scheme, in finance and in industry, which went\r\nhand in hand with the co-ordination of military effort destined for\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to discern how all this peaceful financial manipulation\r\nplayed into the hands of the German Government and fostered German\r\ninfluence in Paris and in France. There was nothing which could be\r\nreasonably objected to, under the conditions of to-day, if Holland, or\r\nBelgium, had been the nation concerned. But with Germany it was quite\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nNot only was French money being used on German account, but, under\r\ncover of quite legitimate finance and apparently genuine newspaper\r\nenterprise, most nefarious schemes were hatched in peace whose full\r\nutility to the enemy would only be disclosed in war. Taking no account\r\neven of the actual operations of bribery, which we now know were\r\ncarried on upon a very large scale, everybody who was directly or\r\nindirectly interested in the various forms of parasitical Franco-German\r\nfinance had personally excellent reasons for pooh-poohing distrust of\r\nthe friendly nation on the other side of the frontier. Thus the most\r\npressing warnings addressed to the French Government might be rendered\r\nalmost useless--as, in fact, they were--by influence brought to bear\r\nfrom quarters that were pecuniarily above suspicion. An atmosphere\r\nfavourable to German propaganda was created which covered up and\r\nfavoured the sinister plans of men and women who were actually in\r\nGerman pay. This went on long before the war, and was continued in\r\nstill more dangerous shape after the war had begun.\r\n\r\nThen there were the honest pacifists, who regarded all war, even\r\ndefensive war, as disastrous to the workers. Whether Germany won or\r\nFrance won in any conflict, the capitalists and the capitalists alone\r\nwere the real enemy. Two such different men as Edouard Vaillant and\r\nGustave Hervé held this opinion; and both at great international\r\nSocialist congresses declared that every effort should be made to\r\nprevent France from coming to an actual struggle with Germany, no\r\nmatter what the provocation might be. When, however, they saw what\r\nthe policy of the Kaiser and his Junker militarists really meant they\r\nchanged their minds. So, in the early days of the war, did the majority\r\nof French Socialists; and several of their principal men, including\r\nJules Guesde, the leader of the Marxists, and Albert Thomas, joined M.\r\nBriand's Cabinet.\r\n\r\nBut there was always an active section left which in all good faith\r\nstood to their views that under the capitalist system nothing could\r\njustify the workers of one country in killing the workers of another.\r\nThey had no interest in their own nation which was worth defending\r\nin the field. The past of France was for them a record of class\r\noppression, the present of France the continuance of chattel slavery in\r\ndisguise, the future of France no better than the permanence of penal\r\nservitude for life as wage-slaves to the bourgeoisie. German domination\r\ncould be no worse for them than the economic tyranny of their own\r\ncapitalist countrymen.\r\n\r\nThis form of social fanaticism now exists in every European nation.\r\nIt is as bitter and, given the opportunity, as unscrupulous and cruel\r\nas any form of religious intolerance that ever exercised control.\r\nEconomic theory entirely obscures history and facts with such men.\r\nNot even the awful horrors of the German invasion, horrors quite\r\nunprecedented in modern warfare and systematically practised in\r\norder to engender terror, and destroy the means of creating wealth,\r\ncould convert Socialists of this school. As a Socialist I understand\r\ntheir fanaticism, though I despise their judgment. Capitalism under\r\nthe control of home employers and financiers is bad, but it can be\r\ncontrolled by educated workers. Capitalism in victorious alliance with\r\nforeign Junkerdom would have made France uninhabitable for Frenchmen,\r\nand would have thrown back democratic Socialism for at least two\r\ngenerations throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this furious minority, in conjunction with Socialists of\r\npolitical intrigue, among whom Jean Longuet (son of Charles Longuet\r\nthe member of the Commune and grandson of Karl Marx) was the leader,\r\nbecame eventually the majority, owing to the weakness of the heads of\r\nthe patriotic section. This success laid the French Socialist Party\r\nopen to the charge of being not only anti-patriotic but definitely\r\npro-German. It led to the retirement of forty-one Deputies from the\r\n\"unified\" combination. The violent animosity of the main body to\r\nClemenceau at the time when he was forced into office, and the refusal\r\nof Socialists to accept portfolios in his Cabinet, when the cause of\r\nthe Allies was at its lowest point, from November, 1917, to July,\r\n1918, looked to outsiders a miserable policy for the party, not to be\r\nexplained by the devotion of its members to MM. Malvy and Caillaux.[D]\r\nPersonal malevolence and political pusillanimity together were the\r\nimputations made against those who thus declined to serve France in\r\nher utmost need. Happily for Europe, their strength was not equal to\r\ntheir ill-will, and Clemenceau, after his first month of power, was\r\nable to treat them as a negligible quantity. So they remain to-day.\r\nA very great opportunity of serving the workers of their country has\r\nbeen missed: that the bitterest enemy of France and of freedom has not\r\nbeen greatly helped in her war for universal domination is no fault of\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nDuring the first three years and more of the war, however, a conspiracy\r\nwas being conducted which, aided unfortunately by much of apathy and\r\nineptitude on the part of successive French Governments, and supported\r\nunintentionally or intentionally by one of the leading statesmen of\r\nFrance, went near to wrecking the fortunes of the Republic. That this\r\nfateful plot failed to achieve the full success which the Germans\r\nanticipated from it is due to Clemenceau. Sordid monetary sympathy with\r\nthe enemy is difficult to forgive: Socialist fanaticism and Socialist\r\nintrigues which must tell to the disadvantage of the nation are hard\r\nto reconcile with common honesty; but downright infamous treachery,\r\nbribery, corruption, and wholesale attempts to organise defeat put all\r\nwho are guilty of them outside the law. Yet matters had come to such a\r\npass that all these various forms of treason to France, to the Allies,\r\nand to soldiers at the front could be carried on with impunity.\r\n\r\nThough the guilty persons were well known and their German plots were\r\nscarcely concealed, none of the Ministers responsible for the public\r\nsafety dared arrest them. Journals that were obviously published in the\r\ninterest of the enemy were allowed to spread false information as they\r\npleased, and to attack all statesmen and politicians who were honestly\r\ntrying to serve France with vitriolic misrepresentation. Day after\r\nday this went on. Day after day, as the situation without grew more\r\nprecarious, the chiefs of this criminal endeavour to bring France to\r\nruin grew bolder in their well-paid treachery. The people of Paris and\r\nthe soldiery in the trenches, whose minds also German agents strove to\r\ndebauch with plausible lies, were becoming hopeless of justice being\r\ndone. Ministry succeeded Ministry and still the traitors were treated\r\nwith consideration by the Minister of the Interior, M. Malvy, and other\r\nmen in high place.\r\n\r\nBeyond question the man officially responsible for all this shameful\r\nlaxity, at one of the most trying crises of the whole war, was M.\r\nMalvy, who enjoyed the whole-souled support of the Socialist Party,\r\non account of creditable behaviour towards the workers, altogether\r\noutside of questions arising from the war. But his conduct in regard\r\nto traitors and pro-Germans had become so weak as to be capable of the\r\nworst interpretation.\r\n\r\nOn July 24th, 1917, Clemenceau declared that he utterly distrusted\r\nM. Malvy. It was known even thus early that this Minister had shown\r\ndeplorable incapacity in his dealings with men who are known to have\r\nbeen actual traitors. He had, in fact, decided not to arrest persons\r\nenumerated in what was called \"List B,\" that is to say, men and women\r\nmore than suspected of criminal intrigue against France. Had not\r\nAlmereyda himself assured M. Malvy, as Minister of the Interior, that\r\nhe and all other Anarchists and anti-patriotic agitators would really\r\ndesist from their sinister proceedings? This was enough. Without\r\ntaking any steps against them, or even obtaining any security for the\r\nfulfilment of this promise in the air, M. Malvy left these miscreants\r\nalone to do what they pleased. So things went on as before; though, as\r\nhas since been proved, several of these active agitators for peace,\r\ndisaffection and surrender were paid agents of the German Government.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, a resolution of confidence in M. Ribot's\r\nAdministration was proposed in the Senate, Clemenceau voted for the\r\nresolution, but made special exception in the case of M. Malvy, in whom\r\nhe declared he had no confidence whatever. Later, Clemenceau boldly\r\naccused M. Ribot and his whole Administration of being themselves\r\nall responsible for the existence of the treacherous German Bonnet\r\nRouge and Bolo conspiracy. Most unfortunately, notwithstanding the\r\nuniversal distrust thus awakened and spreading from Paris throughout\r\nFrance, Republican Ministers, who ought to have been the first to move\r\nto safeguard the interests of France and her Republic, against the\r\ndangerous plots of men known to be immersed in abominable dealings with\r\nthe enemy, failed altogether in their duty. They left it to avowed\r\nRoyalists and reactionaries to lead the attack upon persons guilty of\r\nthese crimes. What, consequently, ought to have been done at once,\r\nlegally and thoroughly, by men who had received political power by vote\r\nof the French people, and were trustees for the defence of the country,\r\nagainst the foreign enemy from without and the domestic enemy within,\r\nwas left largely to be accomplished by M. Léon Daudet and M. Barrès.\r\n\r\nThese men made no secret of the fact that they were actuated by motives\r\nentirely antagonistic to the democratic policy of the Allies and\r\nhostile to the only form of government possible in France. This did\r\nnot render their indictment less crushing when the facts were fully\r\ndisclosed, but it certainly weakened the force of the attack. What\r\nis more, it gave a large and, later, apparently the largest section\r\nof the Socialist Party the excuse, which they were eager to grasp,\r\nfor supporting M. Malvy, and more particularly their friend M. Joseph\r\nCaillaux, against what they were pleased to denounce as abominable\r\ndetraction.\r\n\r\nNewspapers to-day are credited, perhaps, with more political influence\r\nthan they really possess. But it is clear that if nearly the whole\r\nof the important press of a country can be captured by a particular\r\nfaction, and only such news is allowed to be published as suits the\r\nconvenience of the Government in power, the people at large have no\r\nmeans of correcting the false impressions of events thus thrust upon\r\nthem. That is an extreme case, which has, so far, been realised, in\r\npractice, in only one country. But the German agents who were so\r\nactive in Paris were fully alive to the advantages of such a policy\r\nof purchase and manipulation of the press for their own ends. They\r\nmade efforts to secure a control of the majority of the shares in some\r\nof the most influential journals of Paris. How far this process was\r\nsurreptitiously carried will never be known: not far enough, certainly,\r\nto affect the tone of the organs they were anxious to manipulate.\r\n\r\nBut enough was done to show the great danger which would have resulted\r\nto the community, had a newspaper trust been successfully created on\r\nthe scale contemplated, but fortunately never carried out, by the\r\ninfamous Bolo Pasha and his associates. Their own journal, _Le Bonnet\r\nRouge_, even when increased during the war from a weekly to a daily\r\nissue, was not by any means sufficient for their needs, although that\r\ntraitorous sheet alone was able to do a great deal of mischief. But\r\ntheir control was extended to the _Journal_, a paper, prior to the\r\nwar, of considerable circulation and influence. Their attempts to\r\nexpand further were in full swing when, thanks to the work of MM. Léon\r\nDaudet and Barrès in the _Action_ _Française_, and still more to that\r\nof their bitter opponent Clemenceau in _l'Homme Enchaîné_ and in the\r\nSenate, the French Government was forced to arrest the proprietors of\r\nthe _Bonnet Rouge_ and put them on their trial as traitors. It was\r\nknown that M. Caillaux and M. Paix-Séailles--the latter connected\r\nwith M. Painlevé's Cabinet and the repository of anti-French\r\nconfidences--had contributed considerable sums to the support of the\r\nincriminated paper.\r\n\r\nWhen M. Almereyda, one of the most important persons connected with the\r\n_Bonnet Rouge_ (to whose columns a leading Socialist was a contributor)\r\ndied suddenly in prison, the editor of that journal telegraphed to M.\r\nCaillaux concerning the lamentable departure of \"our friend.\" As these\r\nfacts were accompanied by other revelations still more compromising,\r\npublic opinion became greatly excited. There could be no doubt that\r\nthe conspiracy was more than a mere anti-patriotic newspaper intrigue\r\nof financial origin, or an attempt of discredited politicians to\r\nfloat themselves back into office on the wave of discouragement and\r\ndefeatism: it was an endeavour, supported throughout by German funds,\r\nto destroy French confidence in order to ensure French destruction.\r\nA complete exposure of the whole plot, in which M. Caillaux and Bolo\r\nPasha were alleged to be the leading figures, was threatened in\r\nthe course of the _Bonnet Rouge_ trial. Eleven members of the Army\r\nCommittee of the Senate were appointed to consider M. Caillaux's\r\nconnection with M. Almereyda and the _Bonnet Rouge_.\r\n\r\nM. Caillaux has been by far the most formidable advocate of a German\r\npeace from the first. That an ex-Premier of France should take up such\r\na position would seem almost incredible, but that Signor Giolitti in\r\nItaly and Lord Lansdowne in England have pursued the same course in a\r\nless objectionable way. The political relations between Clemenceau and\r\nM. Caillaux in the years prior to the war had not been unfriendly. M.\r\nCaillaux had been Finance Minister in Clemenceau's Cabinet in 1907, and\r\nthey had both worked together for M. Pams against M. Poincaré in the\r\ncontest for the Presidency. But two more different personalities it\r\nwould be difficult to find.\r\n\r\nM. Caillaux is a financier of financiers. His whole career has been\r\nassociated with the dexterous manipulation and acquisition of money\r\nin all its forms. Clemenceau never had anything to do with finance in\r\nhis fife, and wealth is the last thing anybody could accuse him of\r\npossessing. Clemenceau, though no sentimentalist, makes an exception\r\nin his view of life where Frenchmen, France and Paris are concerned.\r\nWith Caillaux audacious cynicism in everything is the key-note of\r\nhis character all through. Moreover, the one is very simple in his\r\nhabits, and the other is devoted to ostentation and display. Caillaux's\r\ncynicism is as remarkable as that of Henry Labouchere, though more\r\nmalignant. When he carried the Income Tax through the Assembly and was\r\nupbraided for having made himself the champion of such a measure, he\r\nclaimed that, though he had obtained for his measure a majority in the\r\nAssembly, he had used such arguments as would destroy it in the country.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the truth of that story, it is certain that the\r\nresult has been as predicted. So in the course of the Agadir affair.\r\nM. Caillaux, as Prime Minister during the whole of the proceedings,\r\nwas reluctant, and perhaps rightly so, to assert the claims of\r\nFrance with vigour. He was, in fact, quite lukewarm on behalf of his\r\ncountry, the representatives of other nations doing more for France,\r\nit is said, than she, or her Premier, did for herself. No sooner,\r\nhowever, was the business settled than M. Caillaux, the judicious but\r\nunavowed anti-expansionist, claimed that he had secured Morocco for\r\nFrance! However this may be, M. Caillaux has always favoured a close\r\npolitical and financial understanding with Germany, as by far the more\r\nadvantageous policy for France, in opposition to a similar _entente_\r\nwith England: a view which, of course, he was quite entitled to take\r\nand act upon, though its success in practice must have reduced France\r\nto the position of a mere satellite of the Fatherland. Before the war\r\nit was possibly a justifiable, though scarcely a far-seeing, policy.\r\n\r\nThe war itself rather strengthened than weakened his tendency in this\r\ndirection. Having comfortably recovered from the unpleasing effect\r\nof the murder of M. Calmette of the _Figaro_, for which crime his\r\nwife was acquitted, he used all his influence, in and out of France,\r\nto bring about a peace with Germany, which could with difficulty be\r\ndistinguished from complete surrender, as soon as possible. This while\r\nthe German armies were in actual occupation of more than a fifth of his\r\ndevastated country, that fifth being the richest part of France. His\r\ninterviews with Signer Giolitti, a vehement partisan of Germany, and\r\ncertain strange intrigues in Rome and elsewhere, could only be regarded\r\nas the more suspicious from the fact that he travelled with a passport\r\nmade out in a fictitious name. Altogether M. Caillaux's proceedings at\r\nhome and abroad, in Europe and in South America, gave the impression\r\nthat he was pursuing a policy of his own which was diametrically\r\nopposed to the welfare of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nSome who have watched closely M. Caillaux's career from his youth up\r\nare of opinion that the man is mad. But there is certainly method\r\nin his madness. Whatever the defects to which the high priests of\r\ninternational financial brotherhood may plead guilty, they never\r\nadmit lunatics into their Teutono-Hebraic Holy of Holies. Access to\r\nthe interior of that sanctuary is reserved for the very elect of the\r\nartists in pecuniary conveyance. But it is precisely within this\r\ninnermost circle of glorified Mammon that M. Joseph Caillaux is most\r\nat home and most influential. And these people, so ensconced in their\r\ngolden temple, were the ones most anxious to bring the war to an end no\r\nmatter what became of France. This, as has been well said, was a civil\r\nwar for Jews; but for the Jews of the great international of Mammon\r\nit was civil war and hari-kari at one and the same time. So there was\r\nweeping and wail in Frankfurt-am-Main, there was wringing of hands in\r\nBerlin on the Spree, and the Parisian devotees of the golden calf were\r\nnot less profuse in their lamentations.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, international finance was, and is, the most\r\npacifist of all the Internationals, and M. Joseph Caillaux as director\r\nof the _Société Générale_, a portion of the great _Banque de Paris et\r\nPays Bas_, represented its view perfectly. But that he is not devoid\r\nof political as well as financial astuteness is apparent from the\r\nextraordinary success he has achieved in securing close intimacy and\r\nfriendship with the French Socialists. This has assured him the support\r\nnot only of Jean Longuet and his friends, with whom he was specially\r\nbound up, but also of _L'Humanité_, with Renaudel, Sembat, Thomas and\r\nothers connected with that useful journal. It has, indeed, been very\r\ndifficult to understand the bitter hatred which the Socialists of\r\nFrance have manifested towards the thoroughgoing patriot Clemenceau,\r\nand their persistent championship of pro-Germans such as Caillaux\r\nand Malvy. But the dry-rot of pro-Germanic pacifism has infected a\r\nlarge proportion of the younger school of international Socialists\r\nin every country. With Socialism, as with commerce and finance, the\r\nGerman policy of unscrupulous penetration has been pursued with great\r\nsuccess. Honest fanatics as well as self-seeking intriguers have fallen\r\nvictims to their wiles. Caillaux was equally fortunate in capturing\r\nboth sections. Even the rougher type of German agents, such as Bolo and\r\nDuval, were not without their friends in the Socialist camp.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of his conduct before the Army Committee of the\r\nSenate was, in effect, an informal trial of M. Caillaux, M. Malvy's\r\ncase having already been remitted by the same body for definite\r\nadjudication by the High Court. Naturally, M. Caillaux and his friends\r\nstrained every nerve, first to prevent Clemenceau from being forced\r\ninto office by public opinion; and then, when his assumption of\r\nthe Premiership became inevitable, to upset his Ministry while its\r\nmembers were scarcely warm in their seats. The French Socialist Party,\r\nunfortunately, aided M. Caillaux and his friends in their attacks,\r\nafter having declined the Premier's offer of seats in his Cabinet.\r\nShortly afterwards Clemenceau himself was summoned to appear as a\r\nwitness before the Committee of the Senate on this serious indictment.\r\nIt is difficult for us to imagine the sensation which this produced.\r\nHere was M. Caillaux, who had been Prime Minister of France only a\r\nfew short years before, who had previously been Clemenceau's intimate\r\ncolleague, openly charged with the despicable crime of trading France\r\naway to the enemy.\r\n\r\nNo wonder a great many thoroughly patriotic Frenchmen could not\r\nbelieve, even in the face of the evidence, that a statesman of M.\r\nCaillaux's ability, with a great future before him after the war, could\r\nbe guilty of such actions as those which were imputed to him. But his\r\nold colleague who had just taken office was in possession of documents\r\nwhich threw an ugly shadow upon all M. Caillaux's recent proceedings.\r\nAs usual Clemenceau went straight to the point. The Government had not\r\nfurnished the members of the Committee with mere surmises or doubts\r\ncast upon the general conduct of the incriminated person. There were\r\nprinted statements already at their disposal of the gravest character.\r\nWith three notorious persons M. Caillaux had intimate connections.\r\nOne of them, when arrested, had died suspiciously in prison: the two\r\nothers were still under arrest upon most serious charges. If this were\r\nthe case of a common citizen he would have been brought at once before\r\na magistrate. The whole country was crying out for the truth in this\r\nCaillaux case as well as in the Malvy affair.\r\n\r\nThis happened soon after Clemenceau had accepted office. A month later,\r\nM. Caillaux being in the meantime protected against arrest by his\r\nposition as deputy, Clemenceau repeated that if all the probabilities\r\naccumulated against Caillaux had been formulated against any private\r\nperson his fate would have been practically decided already. \"The\r\nGovernment has undertaken responsibilities. The Chamber must likewise\r\nshoulder responsibilities. If the Chamber refuses to sanction the\r\nprosecution of M. Caillaux, the Government will not remain in office.\"\r\n\r\nM. Caillaux's admitted conferences with well-known defeatists in Italy\r\nwere of such a nature that Baron Sonnino, the Italian Minister for\r\nForeign Affairs, had himself informed the French Government that he\r\nwas inclined to expel Caillaux forthwith. No doubt he would have done\r\nso, but for the fact that M. Caillaux had been, and might possibly\r\nstill be again, an important personage in French and European affairs.\r\nThroughout, Clemenceau promised that the public should have the full\r\ntruth. He kept his word. The delays in bringing M. Caillaux to a\r\ndefinite judgment have not been due to him. M. Caillaux's immunity as\r\ndeputy was suspended. He was arrested and imprisoned on January 15th,\r\n1918. Four days later came the partial disclosure of the documents\r\nfound in his private safe in Florence.\r\n\r\nThat such papers should ever have been left by a man of M. Caillaux's\r\nintelligence where they might quite conceivably be attached, and\r\nthat he should have carefully put in writing the names of men whom\r\nhe hoped to use for the purpose of furthering a _coup d'état_, do\r\nunquestionably support the theory that he is subject to intermittent\r\nfits of madness. His extraordinary proceedings at Buenos Aires, where,\r\naccording to the United States representative in the Argentine capital,\r\nhe entered into a series of most compromising negotiations with the\r\nGerman von Luxburg, were no good evidence of the permanent sanity of\r\nthis successful and experienced man of affairs. But \"madness in great\r\nones must not unwatched go.\" His object was avowed in that remote city:\r\nto make peace with Germany at any price, for the purpose of reviving\r\ninternational finance. All these statements coming in succession, and\r\naccompanied by the formulation of the cases against M. Malvy, Bolo\r\nPasha, with Duval and others of the _Bonnet Rouge_ clique, at length\r\nroused furious public indignation, which the actions of M. Humbert, the\r\nsenator and owner of the _Journal_, the paper that Bolo had in effect\r\nbought, further inflamed. Who could be regarded as entirely free from\r\ntreacherous designs, when such a crushing indictment as that officially\r\nformulated against Caillaux could be accepted as correct?--when a\r\nMinister of the Interior could be publicly charged with criminal\r\nweakness towards persons more than suspected of high treason of\r\nthe most sordid type?--and when a man of Bolo Pasha's career and\r\nassociations evidently exercised great influence, not to say authority?\r\n\r\nThe revelations at the trials of the accused persons, and the ugly\r\nevidence submitted not only made matters look worse for M. Caillaux,\r\nbut roused general amazement that such deadly intrigues should have\r\nbeen allowed to go so far under the very eyes of the authorities. The\r\ncareer of Bolo Pasha, the direct agent-in-chief of the main conspiracy,\r\nwas well known. The men with whom he was on terms of close intimacy\r\nwere suspected persons, long before any action was taken. The secret\r\nservice department was well aware that he had huge sums of money\r\nat his disposal that were very, very far in excess of any that he\r\ncould command from his private resources. The origin of his title of\r\ndishonour from the Khedive could not have escaped notice. Yet he, a\r\nborn Frenchman, all whose begettings and belongings were a matter of\r\nrecord, pursued his shameless policy in the interest of Germany with\r\napparent certainty of immunity from interference.\r\n\r\nIt was this very same certainty of immunity that made all but a few\r\nafraid to speak out. Bolo, in fact, was a privileged person, until\r\nthere was a statesman at the head of affairs who not only did not\r\nfear to take the heavy responsibility of the arrest and imprisonment\r\nof M. Caillaux, but was also determined that the proceedings in the\r\nother cases already commenced should be pushed to their inevitable\r\nconclusion. \"The unseen hand\" in France, therefore, was no longer\r\nunseen. Yet so wide was the reach of the octopus tentacles, directed by\r\nunderground agency, that even to this day not a few innocent, as well\r\nas guilty, people are in mortal fear lest disclosures may be made which\r\nwill in some or other way implicate them. For the trial of M. Caillaux\r\nhas yet to come.\r\n\r\nThe two really dramatic episodes in all this gradual exposure of infamy\r\nwere the arrest and imprisonment of M. Caillaux, upon the suspension\r\nof his privileges as deputy, and the public trial of Bolo Pasha. After\r\nwhat had happened since August, 1914, it seemed almost impossible that\r\nany Minister, however powerful he might be, would venture to go to the\r\nfull extent of what was indispensably necessary with M. Caillaux. A\r\nman who had been Prime Minister of France, who in that capacity had\r\ngathered round him groups of politicians whose members looked to him to\r\nensure their personal success in the future, was formidably entrenched\r\nboth in the Senate and in the Assembly. To incur the personal enmity\r\nof such a capable statesman and such a master of intrigue as Joseph\r\nCaillaux was more than any of the previous Ministries had dared to\r\nrisk. There were too many political reasons against it. Even the most\r\nhonest of the Socialist Ministers themselves seem to have felt that.\r\nAll the time, likewise, an influential portion of the Press vigorously\r\nsupported the ex-Premier. They carried the war into the enemy's camp by\r\ndenouncing his critics either as unscrupulous and lying reactionaries,\r\nwho were endeavouring to ruin a really progressive statesman, as men\r\nimbued with such lust for slaughter and eagerness for revenge that they\r\nhad lost all grip of the actual situation, or as malignant intriguers\r\nbehind the scenes whose one object was to blacken the character\r\nof an opponent who stood in the way of their schemes for personal\r\naggrandisement.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, M. Caillaux, holding the eminent position already referred\r\nto in the world of finance, had the whole-souled and entire-pocket\r\nbacking of the French and German-Jew international money-lords. These\r\nmagnates of plutocracy, marvellous to relate, found themselves on\r\nthis issue hand in glove with the most active international French\r\nSocialists. Nobody who was in the least afraid of political cliques,\r\nof journalistic coteries, of financial syndicates, or of Socialist\r\nrancour, could put Caillaux under lock and key. And the military\r\noutlook lent itself to the encouragement of the leading advocate of\r\nsurrender and his acolytes. The word was assiduously passed round that,\r\nnow Russia was out of the fray, a drawn battle was the very best that\r\nthe Entente could hope for.\r\n\r\nFrance was bled white, Great Britain was war-weary and her workers\r\nwere discontented, Italy--think of Caporetto--while, as to the United\r\nStates, America was a long way off, President Wilson was still \"too\r\nproud to fight\" in earnest, American troops could never be transported\r\nin sufficient numbers across the Atlantic, and, to say nothing of\r\ndangers from submarines, there was not enough shipping afloat to do\r\nit. All pointed, therefore, to prompt \"peace by negotiation,\" and\r\nwhat better man could there be to negotiate such a peace than M.\r\nJoseph Caillaux? It was because he was the one political personage\r\nin France who could secure fair terms for his distressful country,\r\nat this terrible crisis, that he was so persistently attacked by the\r\nChauvinists as a pro-German and accused of the most sordid treachery by\r\nmen who envied him his power at the international Council Table!\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation. So long as M. Caillaux was at large, and able\r\nto direct the whole of the forces of defeatism, no genuinely patriotic\r\nMinistry could be successfully formed, or, if formed by some fortuitous\r\nconcurrence of circumstances, could last for three months. Treachery\r\nbreeds treachery as loyalty engenders loyalty. When Clemenceau took\r\noffice, therefore, everything depended upon what he did with Caillaux.\r\nParis and all France held their breath as they awaited the event.\r\nPatriots were doubtful: defeatists were hopeful: soldiers were on the\r\nlook-out for a man.\r\n\r\nOn January 15th, then, M. Caillaux was arrested and put in prison\r\nby Clemenceau and his Ministry. All the predictions of upheaval and\r\ndisaster, indulged in by M. Caillaux's friends, were falsified. The\r\ncountry breathed more freely. Thenceforward, France knew whom to back.\r\nBut, supposing that M. Caillaux had still been within the precincts of\r\nParliament and carrying on his political plots when the terrible news\r\ncame of the disasters of Cambrai and St. Quentin, and when the German\r\narmies were within cannon-shot of Paris--how then? Those who knew\r\nbest how things stood believe themselves that counsels of despair and\r\npusillanimity might have prevailed, to the ruin of the country.\r\n\r\nNo such fateful issue as that involved in Caillaux's arrest hung upon\r\nthe result of the trial of Bolo Pasha. But Bolo's whole career was a\r\ntragical farce, to which even Alphonse Daudet could scarcely have done\r\nfull justice. Bolo was a Frenchman of the Midi: a Tartarin with the\r\ntendencies of a financial Vautrin: a fine specimen of the flamboyant\r\nand unscrupulous international adventurer. His first experience in the\r\ndomain of extraction was as a dentist in the country of his birth. A\r\nhandsome, blond young man of fine appearance and manners and methods of\r\naddress attractive to women, he soon found that the drawing of teeth\r\nand other less skilled professions led to the receipt of no emoluments\r\nworthy of his talents. To take in a well-to-do partner and decamp with\r\nhis wife and the firm's cash-box was more in the way of business.\r\n\r\nSo satisfactory was this first adventure that he extended his field\r\nof operations, and several ladies had the advantage of paying for his\r\nattentions in the shape of all the money of which they chanced to be\r\npossessed. Somehow or other he found himself in the Champagne country\r\nduring the wine-growers' riots, and continued to have a good time in\r\nthe district while they were going on. But in 1905 the claret region\r\nproved more lucrative. For in Bordeaux the charm of his disposition\r\nproduced so great an effect upon the widow of a rich merchant of that\r\ncity that she succumbed to his attractions and married him. This\r\nprovided Bolo with the means for setting on foot all sorts of financial\r\nenterprises in Europe and America. He thus became a promoter of the\r\nopen-hearted and sanguine type, found his way into \"society\" of the\r\nkind which opens its arms to such men, had sufficient influence to\r\nbecome a chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and by 1914 had lost all\r\nhis wife's money and more into the bargain--was, in fact, in very\r\nserious financial straits from which he saw no way of extricating\r\nhimself. Certain Egyptian friends he had made, who later obtained for\r\nhim his title of Pasha from the Khedive, were not then in a position to\r\nhelp him.\r\n\r\nBut Bolo without money meant a German agent in search of a job. It\r\nproved easy to get it. He notified the Germans through the Egyptians\r\nthat he could do good service in France if only he were provided with\r\nplenty of funds. He was so furnished with hundreds of thousands of\r\npounds. _L'Homme Libre_ said of him that he revelled in the prestige\r\nof having money, to such an extent that he believed that money was\r\neverything. Rather, perhaps, he had become so accustomed to indulge\r\nin pleasures and political and financial intrigues of every sort that\r\nhe would run any risk rather than give up the game. So it was that he\r\ncarried on the dangerous policy, if such it could be called, sketched\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nAbout his guilt there could be no doubt. That he had been closely\r\nconnected with people in high places as well as in low, and possessed\r\nconsiderable personal magnetism, was clear. All this came out in court,\r\nwhere persons of every grade, from Ministers and Senators to Levantine\r\nrogues and Parisian courtesans, passed in and passed out like figures\r\non a cinema film. Bolo, of course, denied every charge, and posed as a\r\nfinancier of high degree, but he was condemned to death, and his appeal\r\nagainst the sentence was fruitless, though he pretended he could make\r\nharrowing disclosures. He met his death bravely on April 10th. His fate\r\nwas a heavy blow to other spies and conspirators.\r\n\r\nThere was an interpellation on the Bolo trial, a month before his\r\nexecution that led to a powerful speech by Clemenceau, in which he\r\ndeclared that he was first for liberty, next for war, and finally for\r\nthe sacrifice of everything to secure victory. He then made a vigorous\r\nappeal to the Socialists to join with the rest of the country in\r\nsupporting his Government in a supreme effort to free France from the\r\ninvader. \"It is a great misfortune that my administration should be\r\ndenounced by Renaudel\"--then editor of _L'Humanité_--\"as a danger to\r\nthe workers. My hands are to the full as hardened by toil as those of\r\nRenaudel and Albert Thomas, good bourgeois citizens as they are, like\r\nmyself. I have in my pocket a paper in which Renaudel is stigmatised\r\nas Clemenceau's orderly; nay, adding insult to injury, he is held\r\nup to public obloquy as _Monsieur_ Renaudel.\" Then, addressing the\r\nSocialist group, he declared with vehemence: \"We have done you no harm,\r\nbut my methods are not yours. You will not defeat Prussian Junkerdom\r\nby baa-ing around about peace.\" The appeal was quite bootless. On a\r\ndivision confidence in the Clemenceau Government was voted by 400 to\r\n75. The Socialists were the 75. The vote was a direct outcome of the\r\nsordid and gruesome Bolo case.\r\n\r\n\r\n           SUMMARY OF EVENTS RELATING TO TREACHERY IN PARIS,\r\n                      JULY, 1917, TO JULY, 1918.\r\n\r\n _July, 1917._--Clemenceau attacks M.

By 1917, as already recorded,\r\nanti-patriotic and pro-German intrigues in Paris and France had become\r\nmore and more harmful to that \"sacred unity\" which had been constituted\r\nto present an unbroken front to the enemy. After the miserable\r\nbreakdown of Russia, largely due to the Bolshevik outbreak fostered\r\nby German intrigue and subsidised by German money, the position was\r\nexceedingly dangerous. German troops withdrawn from the Eastern front\r\nwere poured into France and Flanders by hundreds of thousands, and the\r\nAllied armies were hard put to it to hold their own. At this time,\r\nwhen it was all-important to maintain the spirit of the French army,\r\nthe enemy offensive in Paris and throughout France became more and\r\nmore active. What made the situation exceptionally critical was the\r\nfact that the rank and file of the French soldiery began to feel that,\r\nhowever desperately they might fight at the front, they were being\r\nsystematically betrayed in the rear. While, therefore, Clemenceau, in\r\nhis capacity as Senator and President of the Inter-Allied Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, voiced the great and growing discontent of the country with\r\nthe lack of real statesmanship displayed in the conduct of the war, he\r\nalso fulminated against the weakness of the wobbling Ministers who,\r\nknowing that defeatism and treachery were fermenting all round them,\r\ntook no effective steps to counteract this pernicious propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe notorious _Bonnet Rouge_ group, however, with M. Joseph Caillaux,\r\nBolo Pasha, Almereyda and others in close touch with M. Jean Longuet\r\nand his pacifist friends of the Socialist Party, were allowed to carry\r\non their virulent anti-French campaign in the Press and in other\r\ndirections practically unchecked. It might even have been thought that\r\nthese persons had the sympathy and support of members of the Government.\r\n\r\nThus, when M. Painlevé took office on M. Ribot's resignation in August,\r\n1917, the outlook was dark all round. The position of the Allied armies\r\nwas by no means satisfactory: the state of affairs in Paris itself was\r\nnot such as to engender confidence: Mr. Lloyd George's headlong speech\r\nof depreciation on his return from Italy had undone all the good of the\r\nunanimous resolution passed by the Inter-Allied Parliamentary Committee\r\nof which Clemenceau was President, declaring that no peace could be\r\naccepted which did not secure the realisation of national claims and\r\nthe complete triumph of justice all along the line. In short, a fit\r\nof despondency, almost deepening into despair, had come over Allied\r\nstatesmen. Notwithstanding distrust, however, war-weariness was not\r\nspreading among the soldiers and sailors. But among the politicians\r\nit was, and German \"peace offensives\" were being welcomed in quarters\r\nwhich were supposed to be resolute for \"_la victoire intégrale_.\" M.\r\nPainlevé's administration was scarcely hoisted into the saddle before\r\nit was ignominiously thrown out again. The instability of successive\r\nFrench Ministries was becoming a danger which extended far beyond\r\nthe limits of France. The unification of the Allied command and the\r\nconcentration of effort on the Western front had become imperative.\r\nThe arrest of all those against whom there was serious suspicion of\r\ntreason, no matter how highly they might be placed, was a necessity of\r\nthe moment. Vigorous support for the generals and armies engaged in\r\nresisting the reinforced enemy was called for from every quarter. So\r\nthe President, M. Poincaré, found himself in a dilemma. But none of\r\nthe leading politicians who had been prominent since the war began was\r\nprepared to take the responsibility of forming an administration and\r\nthen acting upon the lines which the situation demanded.\r\n\r\nIt was at this crisis, perhaps the most dangerous that France has had\r\nto face in all her long history, that the President asked Clemenceau to\r\nbecome the Prime Minister. He was then seventy-six years of age and had\r\nwithdrawn from all those conferences and discussions behind the scenes\r\nwhich, under ordinary circumstances, invariably precede the acceptance\r\nof office. The Socialists declared that, no matter what Clemenceau's\r\npolicy might be, they could not serve under him as President of\r\nCouncil. Clemenceau could not rely upon support from M. Poincaré, and\r\non every ground he was much disinclined to come to the front under\r\nexisting conditions. But his duty to France and its Republic outweighed\r\nall other considerations, and this old statesman shouldered the burden\r\nwhich far younger men declined to take up.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists went quite wild against him--to the lasting injury, as\r\nI hold, of their party and their cause--the Radicals and Republicans\r\nthemselves were more than doubtful of the possibility of his success.\r\nMany politicians and journalists of the Right doubted whether they\r\ncould make common cause with the man who above all other things stood\r\nfor the permanence of Republicanism and was the bitter enemy of\r\nClericalism in every shape. Shrewd judges of public opinion stated that\r\nhis Ministry could not last three months.\r\n\r\nBut courage, frankness and good faith, backed by relentless\r\ndetermination, and the genius that blazes up in the day of difficulty,\r\ngo far. The whole French people suddenly called to mind that this\r\nold Radical of the Bocage of La Vendée, this Parisian of Parisians\r\nfor nearly sixty years, whatever mistakes he may have made in\r\nopposition or in office, had invariably stood up for the greatness,\r\nthe glory, the dignity of France; that he had voted at Bordeaux for\r\nthe continuance of the war when France lay at the feet of the ruthless\r\nconqueror and Gambotta was striving to organise his countrymen for\r\nresistance to the death; that from those dark days of 1871 onwards he\r\nhad always vehemently adjured his countrymen to make ready to resist\r\ncoming invasion; that from August 1914 he had never failed to keep a\r\nstout heart himself and to do his utmost to encourage his countrymen\r\neven when the outlook was blackest for the Allies; that he had ever\r\nbeen the relentless denouncer of weakness and vacillation, as he\r\nhad also been the unceasing opponent of pacifism, pro-Germanism and\r\ntreachery of every kind; that now, therefore, when _la Patrie_ was in\r\ndesperate danger, when Paris might yet be at the mercy of the enemy,\r\nof whose hideous ruffianism they had had such bitter experience,\r\nGeorges Clemenceau was the one man to take control of democratic and\r\nRepublican France in the interest of every section of the population.\r\nThese stirring memories of the past rose up behind Clemenceau in the\r\npresent.[E]\r\n\r\nThus it was that the new Prime Minister, coming down from the Senate to\r\nread his Declaration to the National Assembly, as the French custom is,\r\nwas certain beforehand of a cordial reception from the great majority\r\nof the Deputies. What might happen afterwards depended upon himself and\r\nhis Ministry: what should occur on this his first appearance in the\r\ntribune after nearly eight years of absence depended on themselves.\r\nThey took good care that, at the start at least, he should have no\r\ndoubt as to their goodwill. Only the Socialist minority abstained.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration itself was worthy of the occasion, and it was a\r\nstirring scene when the veteran of the Radical Party, the Tiger of the\r\nold days, rose to deliver it to the House, which was crowded on the\r\nfloor and in the galleries with deputies and strangers eager to hear\r\nwhat he had to say:--\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, we have taken up the duty of government in order to carry\r\non the war with renewed energy and to obtain a better result from our\r\nconcentrated efforts. We are here with but one idea in our minds, the\r\nwar and nothing but the war. The confidence we ask you to give us\r\nshould be the expression of confidence in yourselves. . . . Never has\r\nFrance felt more keenly the need for living and growing in the ideal\r\nof power used on behalf of human rectitude, the resolve to see justice\r\ndone between citizens and peoples able to emancipate themselves. The\r\nwatchword of all our Governments since the war began has been victory\r\nfor the sake of justice. That frank policy we shall uphold. We have\r\ngreat soldiers with a great history led by men who have been tested and\r\nhave been inspired to deeds of the highest devotion worthy of their\r\nancestral renown. The immortal fatherland of our common humanity,\r\novermastering the exultation of victory, will follow, on the lines of\r\nits destiny, the noble aspiration for peace, through them and through\r\nus all. Frenchmen impelled by us into the conflict have special claims\r\nupon us. We owe them everything without reserve. Everything for France:\r\neverything for the triumph of right. One simple duty is imposed upon\r\nus, to stand by the soldier, to live, suffer and fight with him, and to\r\nthrow aside everything that is not for our country. The rights on our\r\nfront, the duties in our rear must be merged in one. Every zone must be\r\nthe army zone. If men there are who must cherish the hatreds of bygone\r\ndays, sweep them away.\r\n\r\n\"All civilised nations are now arrayed in the like battle against\r\nmodern forms of ancient barbarisms. Our Allies and ourselves together\r\nconstitute a solid barrier which shall not be surmounted. Throughout\r\nthe Allied front, at all times and in all places, there is nothing\r\nbut solid brotherhood, the surest basis for the coming world. . . . The\r\nsilent soldiers of the factory, the old peasants working, bent over\r\ntheir soil, the vigorous women who toil, the children who help in\r\ntheir weakness--these likewise are our _poilus_ who in times to come,\r\nrecalling the great things done, will be able to say with the men in\r\nthe trenches, 'I, too, was there.' . . . Mistakes have been made. Think\r\nno more about them save only to remedy them.\r\n\r\n\"But, alas! there have also been crimes, crimes against France which\r\ndemand prompt punishment. We solemnly pledge ourselves, before you and\r\nbefore the country, that justice shall be done with the full rigour of\r\nthe law. Personal considerations or political passion shall neither\r\ndivert us from fulfilling this duty nor induce us to go beyond it.\r\nToo many such crimes have cost us the blood of our soldiers. Weakness\r\nwould mean complicity. There shall be no weakness as there shall be no\r\nviolence. Accused persons shall all be brought before courts-martial.\r\nThe soldier of justice shall make common cause with the soldier in\r\nthe field. No more pacifist plots: no more German intrigues. Neither\r\ntreason nor semi-treason. War, nothing but war. Our country shall not\r\nbe placed between two fires. Our country shall learn that she is really\r\ndefended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"The day will come when from Paris to the smallest village of France\r\nstorms of cheers will welcome our victorious colours tattered by\r\nshell-fire and drenched with blood and tears--the glorious memorials\r\nof our great dead. It is for us to hasten the coming of that day, that\r\nglorious day, which will fitly take its place beside so many others in\r\nour history. These are our unshakable resolves, gentlemen: we ask you\r\nto give them the sanction of your approval.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is a free summary of a Ministerial pronouncement that will ever\r\nbe memorable in the annals of France and of mankind. It swept the\r\nChamber away as the recital marched on. But organised attacks upon the\r\nPresident of the Council at once followed. Now came the supreme test\r\nof the mental and physical efficiency of this wonderful old man whose\r\nyouth is so amazing. He could read a telling manifesto with vigour\r\nand effect. Would he be able to reply with equal power to a series of\r\ninterrogations in an atmosphere to which he had been a stranger for so\r\nmany years? Questions, by no means all of them friendly, poured in upon\r\nClemenceau from every part of the Chamber. From his attitude towards\r\nCaillaux and Malvy to his view of the League of Nations and his policy\r\nin regard to negotiations with the enemy, no point was missed that\r\nmight embarrass or irritate the statesman who had undertaken to stand\r\nin the gap. He showed immediately that he was fully capable of taking\r\nhis own part. The fervour of the new France was heard in every phrase\r\nof his crushing reply:\r\n\r\n\"You do not expect me to talk of personal matters. I am not here for\r\nthat. Still, I have heard enough to understand that the criticisms upon\r\nme should make me modest. I feel humble for the mistakes I have already\r\nmade and for those which I am likely to make. I do not think I can\r\nbe accused of having sought power. But I am in power. I hope it will\r\nnot be a misfortune for my country. You tell me I have made mistakes.\r\nPerhaps you do not know the worst of them. I am here because these are\r\nterrible times when those who through all the struggle have loved their\r\ncountry more than they knew see the hopes of the nation centred on\r\nthem. I am here through the pressure of public opinion, and I am almost\r\nafraid of what it will demand of me, of what it expects of me.\r\n\r\n\"I have been asked to explain myself in regard to war aims, and as to\r\nthe idea of a League of Nations. I have replied in my declaration, 'We\r\nmust conquer for the sake of justice.' That is clear. We live in a\r\ntime when words have great power, but they have not the power to set\r\nfree. The word 'justice' is as old as mankind. Do you imagine that the\r\nformula of a League of Nations is going to solve everything?\r\n\r\n\"There is a committee at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs even now\r\npreparing a scheme for a League of Nations. Among its members are the\r\nmost authoritative exponents of international law. I undertake that\r\nimmediately their labours are finished I will table the outcome of it\r\nin this Chamber, if I am still Prime Minister--which does not seem\r\nlikely.\" (Laughter and cheers.)\r\n\r\n\"I am not unfavourable to arbitration. It was I who sent M. Léon\r\nBourgeois to The Hague, where a series of conventions were agreed upon\r\nwhich Germany is now engaged in violating. Many believe that a miracle\r\nwill bring about a League of Nations. I do not myself think that a\r\nLeague of Nations will be one of the results of this war. If to-morrow\r\nyou proposed to me that Germany should be included in a League of\r\nNations, I should not consent. What guarantees do you offer me?\r\nGermany's signature? Go and ask the Belgians what they think of that.\r\n\r\n\"You never weary of saying that the first thing is for Germany herself\r\nto destroy German militarism, but she is far from destroying it; she\r\nstill holds it fast.\r\n\r\n\"M. Forgeot wants to make war, but while we are making war he wants\r\nus to talk about peace. Personally, I believe that when you are doing\r\nthings you should talk as little as possible. Do M. Forgeot's ideas\r\ncome within the range of practical politics? Do people believe that\r\nthe men in the trenches and the women in the factories do not think of\r\npeace? Our thoughts are theirs. They are fighting to obtain some decent\r\nsecurity of life; and when you ask me my war aims, I reply that my war\r\naim is victory in full.\" (Loud cheers and Socialist interruption.)\r\n\r\n\"I understand your aspirations, some of which I share, but do not let\r\nus make mistakes about war. All these men want peace. But if, while\r\nthey are fighting, the rumour goes round that delegates of one or other\r\nbelligerent country are discussing terms of peace--that yesterday we\r\nwere on the eve of peace, that next day there was a break-off--then\r\nwe are condemned to flounder about in mud and in blood for years\r\nstill. That is the way to disarm and discourage us all. For these\r\nreasons, I am not in favour of Conferences where citizens of different\r\nbelligerent countries discuss peace which the Governments alone are\r\nable to decide. I want to make war. This means that for the moment we\r\nmust silence all factious discussion. Is there a man who has been more\r\nof a party man than I? I see to-day that I have been far too much of a\r\nparty man. My programme is a military and economic programme. We have\r\ngot Allies, to whom we owe loyalty and fidelity, which must override\r\nevery other consideration.\r\n\r\n\"We have not yet achieved victory. We have come to a cruel phase of\r\nthe war. A time of privation is at hand, a time when our spirit must\r\nrise to greater heights yet. Do not, then, speak of peace. We all want\r\npeace, we are making great sacrifices to obtain peace, but we must get\r\nrid of old animosities and turn solidly against the enemy. Leave all\r\nother questions alone.\r\n\r\n\"There is one on which, however, I must touch. Scandals have been\r\nspoken of. Do you think we can have three years of war without\r\nGermany trying to keep spies busy in our midst? I complained that our\r\nlook-out was insufficient, and events have too clearly shown that I\r\nwas right. I am told to tell you the truth. You shall have it. But we\r\nmust distinguish between crimes and accusations. As the examination\r\nproceeds facts will be disclosed which will have their effect. How\r\ncan you expect me to mention names or reveal fragments of truth?\r\nCertain people have been guilty of indiscretion, want of reflection,\r\nor weakness. It is not I but the judge who has to decide. You shall\r\nhave the truth. In what form? If there is any revelation of a political\r\nnature to make there is a political tribunal in this country to make\r\nit. It shall judge. Just as civil justice must do its work during war\r\ntime, so must political justice.\" (A voice: \"Caillaux!\") \"I mention no\r\nname. A journalist has freedom as to what he may say, it is his own\r\nresponsibility; but the head of the Government has a quite different\r\ntask. I am here to put the law in motion if political acts have been\r\ncommitted which are subject to a jurisdiction beyond the ordinary\r\ntribunals.\r\n\r\n\"Those facts will be brought before the tribunal, but I refuse here to\r\naccuse any man.\r\n\r\n\"Justice is our weapon against treason, and where treason is concerned\r\nthere can be no possibility of pardon. In any case, you have got\r\na Government which will try to _govern_ in the strict, but high,\r\nidealistic sense of the word. Where I differ from you, gentlemen of\r\nthe Extreme Left, is when you want to bring abstract conceptions into\r\nthe field of hard facts. That is impossible. We shall try to govern\r\nhonestly and in a Republican spirit. You are not obliged to think we\r\nshall succeed. But we shall do our best. If we make mistakes, others\r\nhave done so before us, others will do so after us. If at last we see\r\nbefore us the long-awaited dawn of victory, I hope--if it is only\r\nto complete the beauty of the picture--that you will pass a vote of\r\ncensure upon me, and I shall go happy away! I know you will not do\r\nthat; but allow me to point out, as I have a right to tell you, that\r\nyou have almost passed a vote of censure on me already before listening\r\nto my Ministerial programme. I challenge you to say that we have made\r\nany attempt to deceive you. If we get painful news, our hearts will\r\nbleed, but we shall tell that news to you here. We have never given\r\nanybody the right to suppose that we constitute a peril to any class of\r\ncitizen or a danger to the national defence. If you think the contrary,\r\nprove it, and I will leave the House. But if you believe that what we\r\nwant above all is the welfare of France, give us your confidence, and\r\nwe will endeavour to be worthy of it.\"\r\n\r\nHis deeds have been on a level with his words. Bolo and Duval shot:\r\nCaillaux in gaol: Malvy exiled by decree of the Senate: the _Bonnet\r\nRouge_ gang tried and condemned: the wretched intrigue in Switzerland\r\nwith the poor German tool, Austria exposed and crushed: a new spirit\r\nbreathed into all public affairs: the army reassured by his perpetual\r\npresence under fire and his unfailing resolve at the War Office that\r\nthe splendid capacity and intrepidity of all ranks at the front shall\r\nnot be sacrificed by treachery or cowardice at the rear: the Higher\r\nCommand brimful of enthusiasm and confidence, due to the appointment of\r\nthe military genius Foch as generalissimo of the United Allied Armies\r\nand the reinstatement of General Mangin at the head of his _corps\r\nd'armée_: the Allies, like France herself, convinced that they have at\r\nlast discovered a man. Such was the stirring work that Clemenceau had\r\nbeen doing since he took office.\r\n\r\nSo to-day Clemenceau is still democratic dictator of the French\r\nRepublic as no man has been for more than a century. When the enemy\r\nwas arrayed in overwhelming numbers close to Amiens and within a few\r\nmiles of Calais, when the German War Lords were decreeing the permanent\r\nsubjugation of the territories they occupied in the West and in the\r\nEast, when the long-range guns were bombarding the capital and the\r\nremoval of the seat of government to the provinces was again being\r\nconsidered, the great French nation felt more confident of its future\r\nthan at any moment since the victories won around Verdun. To every\r\nquestion Clemenceau's answer invariably was, \"Je fais la guerre. Je\r\nfais la guerre. Je fais la guerre.\"\r\n\r\nThose who doubted were convinced: those who were doubtful saw their\r\naspirations realised: those who had never wavered cheered for victory\r\nright ahead.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th, 1918, the French Socialist group in the Chamber of\r\nDeputies made another of those attacks upon the National Administration\r\nwhich, sad to say, have done so much to discredit the whole Socialist\r\nParty, and even the Socialist cause, throughout Europe and the world.\r\nPacifism and Bolshevism together--that is to say, an unholy combination\r\nbetween anti-nationalism and anarchism, have indeed shaken the\r\ninfluence of democratic Socialism to its foundations, just at the time\r\nwhen a sound, sober and constructive Socialist policy, in harmony with\r\nthe aspirations of the mass of the people in every Allied country,\r\nmight have led mankind peacefully along the road to the new period of\r\nnational and international co-operation. The Socialist Deputies in the\r\nChamber held Clemenceau's Ministry, which they had done their very\r\nutmost to discredit and weaken, directly responsible for the serious\r\nmilitary reverses recently undergone by the French and Allied armies.\r\nThey insisted, therefore, upon Clemenceau's appearance in the tribune.\r\nBut when they had got him in front of them their great object evidently\r\nwas not to let him speak. There this old statesman stood, exposed to\r\ninterruptions which were in the worst of bad taste. At last he thought\r\nthe opportunity for which his enemies clamoured had come, and began to\r\naddress the Assembly. But no sooner had he opened his mouth than he was\r\nforced to give way to M. Marcel Cachin. Only then was he enabled to get\r\na hearing, and this is a summary of what he said:--\r\n\r\n\"I regret that, our country being in such great danger, a unanimous\r\nvote of confidence cannot be accorded to us. But, when all is said,\r\nthe opposition of the Socialists does not in the least enfeeble the\r\nGovernment. For four long years our troops have held their own at the\r\nfront with a line which was being steadily worn down. Now a huge body\r\nof German soldiers fresh from Russia and in good heart come forward to\r\nassail us. Some retreat was inevitable. From the moment when Russia\r\nthought that peace could be obtained by the simple expression of wishes\r\nto that end we all knew that, sooner or later, the enemy would be able\r\nto release a million of men to fall upon us. That meant that such a\r\nretirement as we have witnessed must of necessity follow. Our men have\r\nkept their line unbroken against odds of five to one. They have often\r\ngone sleepless for three days and even four days in succession. But\r\nour great soldiers have had great leaders, and our army as a whole has\r\nproved itself to be greater than even we could expect.\r\n\r\n\"The duties we have to perform here are, in contrast to their heroism,\r\ntame and even petty. All we have to do is to keep cool and hold on. The\r\nGermans are nothing like so clever as they believe themselves to be.\r\nThey have but a single device. They throw their entire weight into one\r\ngeneral assault, and push their advantage to the utmost. True they\r\nhave forced back our lines of defence. But final success is that alone\r\nwhich matters, and that success for us is certain. The Government you\r\nsee before you took office with the firm resolve never to surrender. So\r\nlong as we stand here our country will be defended to the last. Give\r\nway we never shall.\r\n\r\n\"Germany has once more staked her all on one great blow, thinking\r\nto cow us into abandoning the conflict. Her armies have tried this\r\ndesperate game before. They tried it on the Marne, they tried it on the\r\nYser, they tried it at Verdun, they tried it elsewhere. But they never\r\nhave succeeded, and they never shall. Our Allies to-day are the leading\r\nnations of the world. They have one and all pledged themselves to fight\r\non till victory is within our grasp. The men who have already fallen\r\nhave not fallen in vain. By their death they have once more made French\r\nhistory a great and noble record. It is now for the living to finish\r\nthe glorious work done by the dead.\"\r\n\r\nThis great speech raised the overwhelming majority of the Assembly\r\nto the highest pitch of enthusiasm. Nearly all present felt that the\r\ndestinies of France hung in the balance, and that any vote given which\r\nmight tend to discourage the men at the front at such a time was a\r\ndirect service rendered to the enemy whose bombs were even then falling\r\nin the heart of Paris. The vote of confidence in Clemenceau and his\r\nMinistry was carried by 377 votes to 110; and of these 110 more than a\r\nthird were convinced shortly afterwards that the course they had then\r\ntaken in order to preserve the unity of their forces as factionists was\r\nunworthy of their dignity as men.\r\n\r\nThen, too, when the tide turned and the German hordes, after fresh\r\nglorious battles of the Marne and of the Somme, were in headlong\r\nretreat, Clemenceau, unelated by victory as he was undiscouraged by\r\ndefeat, repeated again: \"Je fais la guerre. Je fais la guerre. Je fais\r\nla guerre.\" Not until the German armies were finally vanquished would\r\nthe Republican statesman talk of making peace. On both sides of the\r\nAtlantic, therefore, as on both sides of the Channel, knowing Great\r\nBritain and the United States by personal experience and able to gauge\r\nthe cold resolution of the one and the inexhaustible resources and\r\ndetermination of the other, speaking and writing English well, he is\r\nnow, as he has been throughout this tremendous war, a tower of strength\r\nto the forces of democracy and a very present help to all who are\r\nresolved to break down German militarism for evermore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                              CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Georges Clemenceau, President of the Council and Minister of War, and\r\nMarshal Foch, General-in-Chief of the Allied armies, have well deserved\r\nthe gratitude of the country.\"\r\n\r\nThat is the Resolution which, by the unanimous vote of the Senate\r\nof the French Republic, will be placed in a conspicuous position in\r\nevery Town Hall and in the Council Chamber of every commune throughout\r\nFrance. The Senators of France are not easily roused to enthusiasm.\r\nWhat they thus unanimously voted, in the absence of Clemenceau, amid\r\ngeneral acclamation, is a fine recognition of his pre-eminent service\r\nas well as of his indefatigable devotion to duty at the most desperate\r\ncrisis in the long and glorious history of his country. Nothing like\r\nit has ever been known. The reward is unprecedented: the work done has\r\nsurpassed every record.\r\n\r\nIt is well that the great statesman should be honoured in advance of\r\nthe great military commander. Marshal Foch has accomplished marvels in\r\nmore than four years of continuous activity, from the first battle of\r\nthe Marne to the signing of the armistice of unconditional surrender.\r\nAll Europe and the civilised world are indebted to him for his masterly\r\nstrategy and successful manœuvres. But France owes most to Clemenceau.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of this historic sitting Clemenceau himself entered\r\nthe Senate. He received an astounding welcome. Everyone present rose\r\nto greet him. Men who but yesterday were his enemies, and are still\r\nhis opponents, rushed forward with the rest to applaud him, to shake\r\nhands with him, to thank him, to embrace him. The excitement was so\r\noverwhelming that Clemenceau, for the first time in his life, broke\r\ndown. Tears coursed down his cheeks and for some moments he was unable\r\nto speak. When he did he, as always, refused to take the credit and\r\nthe glory of the overthrow of the Germans and their confederates to\r\nhimself. In victory in November, as when he was confronting difficulty\r\nand danger in March and July, his first and his last thoughts were of\r\nFrance. The spirit of France, the citizens of France, the soldiers and\r\nsailors of France: these were they who in comradeship with the Allies\r\nhad achieved the great victory over the last convulsions of savagery.\r\nHe had been more than fully rewarded for all he had done by witnessing\r\nthe expulsion of the foreigner and the liberation of the territory.\r\nHis task had merely been to give full expression to the courage and\r\ndetermination of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nClemenceau spoke not only as a French statesman, as the veteran\r\nupholder of the French Republic, but as one who remembered well the\r\nhorrors and defeats of 1870-71, now followed, forty-eight years later,\r\nby the horrors and the triumphs of 1918. The Senators who heard him\r\nand acclaimed him felt that Clemenceau was addressing them as the man\r\nwho had embodied in himself, for all those long years, the soul of the\r\nFrance of the Great Revolution, and now at last was able to show what\r\nhe really was.\r\n\r\nThis moving reception in the Senate had been preceded by an almost\r\nequally glowing display of enthusiasm in the Chamber of Deputies.\r\nThere too--with the exception of a mere handful of Socialists whose\r\nextraordinary devotion to Caillaux and Malvy blinds them to the genius\r\nof their countryman--the whole Assembly rose up to welcome and cheer\r\nhim. Clemenceau, speaking there, also, under strong emotion, after two\r\nstirring orations from M. Deschanel and M. Pichon, assured the Deputies\r\nthat the armistice which would be granted to Germany could only be on\r\nthe lines of those accorded to Bulgaria, Austria-Hungary and Turkey.\r\nMarshal Foch would decide the details, which now all the world knows.\r\n\r\nBut, after having dealt with the armistice implored by Germany,\r\nClemenceau went back to the past and said: \"When I remember that I\r\nentered the National Assembly of Bordeaux in 1871, and was--I am the\r\nlast of them--one of the signers of the protests against the annexation\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine . . . it is impossible for me, now peace is certain\r\nand our victory assured, to leave the tribune without paying homage to\r\nthose who were the initiators and first workers in the immense task\r\nwhich is being completed at this moment.\r\n\r\n\"I wish to speak of Gambetta\" (the whole House rises with prolonged\r\ncheering) \"--of him who, defending the territory under circumstances\r\nwhich rendered victory impossible, never despaired. With him and with\r\nChanzy I voted for the continuation of the war, and in truth, when I\r\nthink of what has happened in these fifty years, I ask myself whether\r\nthe war has not continued all the time. May our thoughts go back to\r\nthem; and when these terrible iron doors that Germany has closed\r\nagainst us shall be opened, let us say to them: 'Pass in first. You\r\nshowed us the way.'\"\r\n\r\nThe French Premier went on to speak of the problems of peace, which\r\ncould only be solved, like the problems of war, by national unity for\r\nthe common cause, \"for the Republic which we made in peace, which we\r\nhave upheld in war, the Republic which has saved us during the war.\" He\r\nappealed \"First for solidarity with the Allies, and then for solidarity\r\namong the French.\" This was needful for the maintenance of peace and\r\nthe future of their common humanity. Humanity's great crusade was\r\ninspired not by the thought of God but of France. \"_Ce n'est pas Dieu,\r\nc'est la France qui le veut._\"\r\n\r\nThe Deputies rose again and again. It would have been strange if they\r\nhad not.\r\n\r\nBut fine though these speeches were, and impressive as was the Prime\r\nMinister's adjuration that, since the problems of peace were harder\r\nthan those of war, they must prove their worth in both fields--it\r\nwas Clemenceau's personal influence that gave them their special\r\nvalue. Undoubtedly the splendid fighting of the French and British\r\nand American troops and the admirable skill of their commanders had\r\nproduced that dramatic change from the days of depression from March\r\nto July to the period of continuous triumph from July to November.\r\nThis Clemenceau never allows us for one moment to forget. But he it\r\nwas who had breathed new life into the whole combination, military\r\nand civilian, at the front and in the factories. No man of his time\r\nof life, perhaps no man of any age, ever carried on continuously such\r\nexhausting toil, physical and mental, as that which this marvellous old\r\nstatesman of seventy-seven undertook and carried though from November\r\n1917 to November 1918.\r\n\r\nHis energy and power of work were those of a vigorous young man in\r\nthe height of training. Starting for the front in a motor-car at four\r\nor five o'clock in the morning at least three times a week, he kept\r\nin touch with generals, officers and soldiers all along the lines\r\nto an extent that would have seemed incredible if it had not been\r\nactually done. Once at the front he walked about under fire as if he\r\nhad come out for the pleasure of risking his life with the _poilus_\r\nwho were fighting for La Patrie. Marshal Foch and Higher Command were\r\nin constant fear for him. But he knew what he was about. Valuable as\r\nhis own life might be to the country, to court death was a higher duty\r\nthan to take care of himself, if by this seeming indifference he made\r\nFrenchmen all along the trenches feel that he and they were one. He\r\nsucceeded. Fortune favoured him throughout. Then having discoursed\r\nwith the Marshal and his generals, having saluted and talked with the\r\nofficers, he chatted with the rank and file of the soldiery and rushed\r\nback to Paris, arriving at the Ministry of War at ten or eleven o'clock\r\nat night, ready to attend to such pressing business as demanded his\r\npersonal care. And all the time cheerful, alert, confident, showing,\r\nwhen things looked dark, as when the great advance began, that the\r\nPrime Minister of the Republic never for one moment doubted the Germans\r\nwould be hurled back over the frontier and France would again take her\r\nrightful place in the world.\r\n\r\nAnd that is not all. Clemenceau's influence in the Council Chamber of\r\nthe Allies was and is supreme. The old gaiety of heart remains, but\r\nthe soundness of judgment and determination to accept no compromise\r\nof principle are more marked than ever. Many dangerous intrigues\r\nduring the past few months, of which the world has heard little, were\r\nsnuffed clean out by Clemenceau's force of character and overwhelming\r\npersonality. The French Prime Minister wanted final victory for France\r\nand her Allies. Nothing short of this would satisfy him. There was\r\nno personal loyalty he wished to build up, no political object that\r\nhe desired to attain, no section or party that he felt himself bound\r\nto propitiate. Therefore the other Ministers of the Allies found\r\nthemselves at the table with a statesman who was something more than an\r\nindividual representative of his nation. He was the human embodiment of\r\na cause. What that meant and still means will only be known when the\r\ndust of conflict has passed from us and the whole truth of Clemenceau's\r\npolicy can be told.\r\n\r\nFor my part I have done my best as an old and convinced\r\nSocial-Democrat, and on some important points his opponent, to give\r\na frank and unbiassed study of Clemenceau's fine career. His very\r\nmistakes serve only to throw into higher relief his sterling character\r\nand the genius which has enabled him to command success. Read aright,\r\nhis actions do all hang together, and constitute one complete whole.\r\nComprising within himself the brilliant yet thorough capacity of his\r\nFrench countrymen, he has risen when close upon eighty to the height of\r\nthe terribly responsible position he was forced to fill.\r\n\r\nTherefore his efforts have been crowned with complete victory. Having\r\nforgotten himself in his work, the man Clemenceau will never be\r\nforgotten. He will stand out in history as the great statesman of the\r\nGreat War.\r\n\r\nAnd now that he and we have won--our aid, as none knows or\r\nappreciates better, having been absolutely indispensable to the\r\nFrench triumph--Clemenceau feels so deeply that France as a whole\r\nhas shared in the great awakening that, having himself appointed the\r\ndevout Catholic Marshal Foch generalissimo of the Allied armies, he,\r\nof all men, joined in the _Te Deum_ of Thanksgiving in the Cathedral\r\nof Lille! The work he has done, the risks he has run, the unshakable\r\ndetermination he has displayed, have raised him high above all petty\r\nconsiderations of politics, creeds, classes, or conditions. Therefore\r\nhe is the hero of France after her desperate struggle for national\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Adulteration, John Bright on, 194\r\n\r\n  Albert, 16\r\n\r\n  Amadé, General, 212\r\n\r\n  Arago, Etienne, 9, 24, 32, 35\r\n\r\n  Armistice of 1871, 36\r\n\r\n  Aumale, Duc d', and Boulanger, 95\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bakunin, 50\r\n\r\n  Barodet, 69, 86, 87\r\n\r\n  Barrès, M., 265\r\n\r\n  Basly, M., miners' agent, 180\r\n\r\n  Bazaine, Marshal, 32, 36, 40\r\n\r\n  Bebel and Jaurès on the Fleet, 238\r\n\r\n  ---- and the Social-Democrats, 244\r\n\r\n  Beesly, Prof., 50\r\n\r\n  Bellers, John, 234\r\n\r\n  Benedek, Marshal, 27\r\n\r\n  Berlin, brutality and greed of, 34\r\n\r\n  Beslay, 45, 49\r\n\r\n  Billot, General, 157\r\n\r\n  Bismarck--the forgery at Ems, 33\r\n\r\n  Blanc, Louis, 16, 39, 78, 85\r\n\r\n  Blanqui, 49, 56, 58, 59, 61\r\n\r\n  \"Blessed word,\" the, 19\r\n\r\n  Boer War, the, 216, 217\r\n\r\n  Boisdeffre, General, 157\r\n\r\n  Bolo Pasha, 273-280\r\n\r\n  _Bonnet Rouge_, arrest of proprietors, 267\r\n\r\n  Bordeaux, the Government at, 249\r\n\r\n  Boulanger, General, 10\r\n\r\n  Boulanger, General, and Army reforms, 96\r\n\r\n  ----, as War Minister, 96\r\n\r\n  ----, candidate for Paris, 101\r\n\r\n  ----, deprived of his command, 99\r\n\r\n  ----, downfall, its effect on the influence of Clemenceau, 105\r\n\r\n  ----, elected for the Nord, 100\r\n\r\n  ----, enters politics, a candidate for the Nord and the Dordogne, 99\r\n\r\n  ----, fails to profit by his success, 103\r\n\r\n  ----, flight and suicide, 104\r\n\r\n  ----, his duel with M.

His speeches\r\nin the Chamber of Deputies from 1876 up to 1893, and in the Senate,\r\nsince 1902, will be found in the _Journal Officiel_ and the _Annales\r\ndu Sénat_. There are several studies of Clemenceau and his career: the\r\nmost recent is _Clemenceau_ (8vo, Paris--Charpentier, 1918), of which\r\nM. Georges Lecomte is the author. But he has been disinclined to have\r\nany detailed personal biography published. Though he must be well aware\r\nof the eminent part he has played in the history of his own country\r\nand of Europe, he has always preferred to speak of himself, and to be\r\nspoken of, as only one of the people of the France whom he has so well\r\nserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] M. Maurice Le Blond.\r\n\r\n[B] \"Yes, bear in mind, reader, Monsieur Brandès's fear under existing\r\nconditions is that Germany may be humiliated! Denmark has been\r\nhumiliated by the people of supermen who constitute the German race.\r\nFrance, also, I take it, and even Belgium: perhaps Brandès will admit\r\nthat? He has not protested. He even refuses to explain himself on this\r\npoint, declaring that his silence (prolix enough) is golden--that sort\r\nof gold which won't stand the touchstone. But his overmastering dread\r\nis that the organisers of the greatest crime against civilisation,\r\nagainst the independence of the peoples, against the dignity of the\r\nhuman species, the authors of the appalling atrocities from which\r\nBelgium and France are still bleeding, may not themselves undergo\r\n_humiliation_.\"\r\n\r\n[C] I happen to know the configuration of this district well, having\r\nwalked all over it in 1866, after I went up into the Tyrol with\r\nGaribaldi.\r\n\r\n[D] Since the extreme pacifist and anti-nationalist section of\r\nSocialists captured the French Socialist Party a body of the French\r\nSocialist Deputies have constituted a group of their own in the\r\nAssembly. They number in all forty-one and they have a well-edited and\r\nwell-written daily journal, _La France Libre_, which represents their\r\nviews. Among their leading members are the Citizens Varenne, De la\r\nPorte, Compère Morel, Albert Thomas and others. They are thoroughly\r\nsound Socialists in all domestic affairs, but they cannot accept the\r\nviews of those who are now led by Jean Longuet and Marcel Cachin on\r\nquestions affecting the independence and welfare of France as a nation.\r\nTheir opinions are, in fact, much the same as those which have been\r\nso vigorously and successfully championed by the National Socialist\r\nParty in Great Britain. It seems a pity that none of their party have\r\nseen their way to accept the positions in the Cabinet offered by M.\r\nClemenceau. The results of the General Election in Great Britain may\r\ngive them encouragement to do so.\r\n\r\n[E] CLEMENCEAU'S MINISTRY.\r\n\r\n  CLEMENCEAU, Prime Minister and Minister for War.\r\n  PICHON, Foreign Affairs.\r\n  PAMS, Interior.\r\n  KLOTZ, Finance.\r\n  LEYGUES, Marine        }\r\n  CLEMENTEL, Commerce    }\r\n  CLAVALLE, Public Works } Members of late Ministry.\r\n  LOUCHEUR, Munitions    }\r\n  COLLIARD, Labour       }\r\n  BORET, Supplies and Agriculture.",
