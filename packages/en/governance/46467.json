Perhaps that matters little,\r\nwhile his history so flourishes, by reason of being more creditable, as\r\nwell as far more credible, than that of England, for the last few years.\r\n\r\nStill, in such a case, the man who did the thing is the one to tell it.\r\nAnd his veracity has now become a proverb.\r\n\r\nMy refusal seemed to pain Sir Thomas, because he is so bashful; and no\r\none can see him pained, without grieving for his own sake also, and\r\ntrying to feel himself in the wrong.\r\n\r\nThis compelled me to find other arguments; which I did as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"First, my dear sir, in political matters, my humble view's are not\r\nstrong, and trenchant--as yours are become by experience--but\r\nexceedingly large, and lenient; because I have never had anything at\r\nall to do with politics.\r\n\r\n\"Again, of science,--the popular name for almost any speculation, bold\r\nenough,--I am in ignorance equally blissful, if it were not thrilled\r\nwith fear. What power shall resist the wild valour of the man, who\r\nproves that his mind is a tadpole's spawn, and then claims for that mind\r\nsupreme dominion, and inborn omniscience? Before his acephalous rush,\r\ndown go piled wisdom of ages, and pinnacled faith, cloud-capped heights\r\nof immortal hope, and even the mansions everlasting, kept for those who\r\nlive for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"All those he may upset,\" replied Sir Thomas, with that sweet and\r\nbuoyant smile, which has saved even his supernatural powers, from the\r\nsneers of those below him; \"or at least, he may fancy that he has done\r\nit. But to come to facts,--can he upset, or even make head, or tail, of\r\nsuch a little affair as I am? Not one of his countless theories about me\r\nhas a grain of truth in it; though he sees me, and feels me, and pokes\r\nme in the side, and listens, as if I were a watch run down, to know\r\nwhether I am going. I assure you, that to those who are not frightened\r\nby his audacity, and fame, his 'links of irrefragable proof' are but a\r\nbaby's dandelion chain. In chemistry alone, and engineering, has science\r\nmade much true advance. The main of the residue is arrogance.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that branch of science, we are all Professors,\" I answered, to\r\ndisarm his wrath; knowing that, in these riper years, honest indignation\r\nwrought upon his system, as youthful exultation once had done; and I\r\ncould not afford to have a hole made in my ceiling. \"However, Sir\r\nThomas, I shall stick to my resolve. Though your life--when its\r\nlargeness is seen aright--will be an honour to the history of our race,\r\njustice comes before honour; and only you can do justice to it.\"\r\n\r\nHumility, which competes with truth, for the foremost place in his\r\ncharacter, compelled him to shake his head at this; and he began again,\r\nrather sadly.\r\n\r\n\"My purpose is a larger one, than merely to talk of my own doings. I\r\nwant to put common sense into plain English, and to show--as our medical\r\nmen show daily--that the body is beyond the comprehension of the mind.\r\nThe mind commands the body to lie down, and be poked at, and probed, and\r\npried into, with fifty subtle instruments, or even to be cut up, and\r\nanalysed alive; and then understands never the more of it. If the mind\r\ncan learn nothing of the body it lives in, grows, rejoices, and suffers\r\nwith, how can it know all about it, for millions of years before either\r\nexisted? How can it trace their joint lineage up to a thing, that had\r\nneither a head, nor a body?\r\n\r\n\"Go to; what I offer is not argument, but fact; and I care not the head\r\nof their ancestor for them. But if I write it, will you remove whatever\r\nmay offend a candid mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you offend no mind but that,\" said I, being fresh from a sharp\r\nreview of something I had written; \"you will give small offence indeed;\r\nand to edit you will be a sinecure.\"\r\n\r\nBoth these predictions have proved correct; except indeed that a few\r\nkind readers of sadly unscientific mind have hankered for some\r\nexplanation of parts which they failed to witness.\r\n\r\nThe reply is truly simple--\"if you were not there the fault was yours;\r\nhere are the facts as in evidence, better supported, and less strange,\r\nthan those you accept without a wink; and perhaps your trouble in\r\nrealising a case of specific levity proceeds from nothing but your own\r\nexcessive specific gravity.\"\r\n\r\nR.

And I would not have troubled any\r\none's attention, if I could only have been let alone, and not ferreted\r\nas a phenomenon.\r\n\r\nWhen the facts, which I shall now relate, were fresh and vivid in the\r\npublic mind, it might have been worth twenty guineas to me to set them\r\nin order and publish them. Such curiosity, then, was felt, and so much\r\nof the purest science talked, about my \"abnormal organism,\" that nine,\r\nor indeed I may say ten, of the leading British publishers went so far\r\nas to offer me £20,[1] with a chance of five dollars from America, if I\r\nwould only write my history!\r\n\r\nBut when a man is in full swing of his doings and his sufferings, how\r\ncan he stop to set them down, for the pleasure of other people? And even\r\nnow, when, if I only tried, I could do almost as much as ever, it is not\r\nwith my own consent that you get this narrative out of me. How that\r\ncomes to pass, you shall see hereafter.\r\n\r\nEvery one who knows me will believe that I have no desire to enlarge a\r\nfame, which already is too much for me. My desire is rather to slip away\r\nfrom the hooks and crooks of inquirers, by leaving them nothing to lay\r\nhold of, not even a fibre to retain a barb; myself remaining like an\r\nopen jelly, clear, and fitter for a spoon than fork,--as there is said\r\nto be a fish in Oriental waters, which, being hooked, turns inside out,\r\nand saves both sides by candour.\r\n\r\nOne reason why I now must tell the simple truth, and be done with it, is\r\nthat big rogues have begun to pile a pack of lies about me, for the sake\r\nof money. They are swearing one another down, and themselves up, for\r\nnothing else than to turn a few pounds out of me; while never a one of\r\nthem knows as much as would lie on a sixpence about me. Such is the crop\r\nof crop-eared fame!\r\n\r\nNow, if there is any man so eminent as to be made money of, surely he\r\nought to be allowed to hold his own pocket open. Otherwise, how is he\r\nthe wiser for all the wonder concerning him? And yet those fellows, I do\r\nassure you, were anxious to elevate me so high, that every sixpence\r\npitched at me should jump down into their own hats. This is not to my\r\nliking; and I will do my utmost to prevent it. And when you know my\r\npeculiar case, you will say that I have cause for caution.\r\n\r\nSo fleeting is popularity, such a gossamer the clue of history, that\r\nwithin a few years of the time when I filled a very large portion of the\r\npublic eye, and was kept in great type at every journal office, it may\r\neven be needful for me to remind a world, yet more volatile than myself,\r\nof the thrilling sensation I used to create, and the great amazement of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nThese were more natural than wise; for I never was a wonder to myself,\r\nand can only hope that a truthful account of my trouble will commend me,\r\nto all who have time enough to think, as a mortal selected by nature for\r\nan extremely cruel experiment, and a lesson to those who cannot enjoy\r\nher works, without poking sticks at them.\r\n\r\nMy father was the well-known Bucephalus Upmore--called by his best\r\nfriends \"Bubbly Upmore\"--owner of those fine soap-boiling works, which\r\nused to be the glory of old Maiden Lane, St. Pancras. He was one of the\r\nbest-hearted men that ever breathed, when things went according to his\r\nmind; blest with every social charm, genial wit, and the surprising\r\nproducts of a brisk and poetical memory. His figure was that of the\r\nbroadest Briton, his weight eighteen stone and a half, his politics and\r\nmanners Constitutional all over. At every step he crushed a flint, or\r\nsplit a contractor's paving-stone, and an asphalt walk was a quagmire to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMy mother also was of solid substance, and very deep bodily thickness.\r\nShe refused to be weighed, when philosophers proposed it; not only\r\nbecause of the bad luck that follows, but also because she was neither a\r\nbull, nor a pen of fat pigs, nor a ribboned turkey. But her husband\r\nvouched her to be sixteen stone; and if she had felt herself to be much\r\nless, why should she have scorned to step into the scales, when she\r\nunderstood all the rights of women?\r\n\r\nThese particulars I set down, simply as a matter of self-defence,\r\nbecause men of science, who have never seen me, take my case to support\r\ntheir doctrine of \"Hereditary Meiocatobarysm,\" as they are pleased to\r\ncall it, presuming my father to have been a man of small specific\r\ngravity, and my mother a woman of levity. They are thoroughly welcome to\r\nthe fact, out of which they have made so much, that the name of my\r\nmother's first husband was Lightbody--Thomas Lightbody, of Long Acre, a\r\nman who made springs for coaches. But he had been in St. Pancras\r\nchurchyard, seven good years before I was born; and he never was\r\nmentioned, except as a saint, when my father did anything unsaintly.\r\n\r\nBut a truce to philosophy, none of which has ever yet bettered my\r\ncondition. Let every tub stand, or if stand it cannot, let every tub fly\r\non its own bottom. Better it is to have no attempt at explanation of my\r\ncase, than a hundred that stultify one another. And a truly remarkable\r\nman has no desire to be explained away.\r\n\r\nLike many other people, who have contrived to surprise the world before\r\nthey stopped, I did not begin too early. As a child, I did what the\r\nother children did, and made no attempt to be a man too soon. Having\r\nplenty of time on my hands, I enjoyed it, and myself, without much\r\nthought. My mother alone perceived that nature intended me for\r\ngreatness, because I was the only child she had. And when I began to be\r\na boy, I took as kindly as any boy to marbles, peg-top, tip-cat, toffy,\r\nlollipops, and fireworks, the pelting of frogs, and even of dogs, unless\r\nthey retaliated, and all the other delights included in the education of\r\nthe London boy; whose only remarkable exploit is to escape a good hiding\r\nevery day of his life.\r\n\r\nBut as a straw shows the way of the wind, a trifle or two, in my very\r\nearly years, gave token of future eminence. In the days of my youth,\r\nthere was much more play than there ever has been since; and we little\r\nyoungsters of Maiden Lane used to make fine running at the game of \"I\r\nspy,\" and even in set races. At these, whenever there was no wind, I was\r\nabout on a par with the rest of my age, or perhaps a little fleeter. But\r\nwhenever a strong wind blew, if only it happened to be behind my jacket,\r\nOld Nick himself might run after me in vain; I seemed not to know that I\r\ntouched the ground, and nothing but a wall could stop me. Whereas, if\r\nthe wind were in front of my waistcoat, the flattest-footed girl, even\r\nPolly Windsor, could outstrip me.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that happened to me was this, and very unpleasant the\r\neffects were. My mother had a brother, who became my Uncle William, by\r\ncoming home from sea, when everybody else believed him drowned and done\r\nfor. Perhaps to prove himself alive, he made a tremendous noise in our\r\nhouse, and turned everything upside down, having a handful of money, and\r\nbeing in urgent need to spend it. There used to be a fine smell in our\r\nparlour, of lemons, and sugar, and a square black bottle; and Uncle\r\nWilliam used to say, \"Tommy, I am your Uncle Bill; come and drink my\r\nhealth, boy! Perhaps you will never see me any more.\" And he always\r\nsaid this in such a melancholy tone, as if there was no other world to\r\ngo to, and none to leave behind him.\r\n\r\nA man of finer nature never lived, according to all I have heard of him.\r\nWherever he might be, he regarded all the place as if it were made for\r\nhis special use, and precisely adapted for his comfort; and yet as if\r\nsomething was always coming, to make him say \"good-bye\" to it. He had an\r\nextraordinary faith in luck, and when it turned against him, off he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nOne day, while he was with us, I came in with an appetite ready for\r\ndinner, and a tint of outer air upon me, from a wholesome play on the\r\ncinder-heaps. \"Lord, bless this Tommy,\" cried Uncle William; \"he looks\r\nas if he ought to go to heaven!\" And without another word, being very\r\ntall and strong, he caught hold of me under the axle of my arms, to give\r\nme a little toss upward. But instead of coming down again, up I went,\r\nfar beyond the swing of his long arms. My head must have gone into the\r\nceiling of the passage, among the plaster and the laths; and there I\r\nstuck fast by the peak of my cap, which was strapped beneath my chin\r\nwith Spanish leather. To see, or to cry, was alike beyond my power, eyes\r\nand mouth being choked with dust; and the report of those who came\r\nrunning below is that I could only kick. However, before I was wholly\r\ndone for, somebody fetched the cellar-steps, and with very great\r\ndifficulty pulled me down.\r\n\r\nUncle William was astonished more than anybody else, for everybody else\r\nput the blame upon him; but he was quite certain that it never could\r\nhave happened, without some fault on my part. And this made a soreness\r\nbetween him and my mother, which (in spite of his paying the doctor's\r\nbill for my repairs, as he called it) speedily launched him on the waves\r\nagain, as soon as his money was got rid of.\r\n\r\nThis little incident confirmed my mother's already firm conviction that\r\nshe had produced a remarkable child. \"The Latin Pantheon is the place\r\nfor Tommy,\" she said to my father, every breakfast time; \"and to grudge\r\nthe money, Bucephalus, is like flying in the face of Providence.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart,\" father always answered, \"if Providence will pay the\r\nten guineas a quarter, and £2 15s. for extras.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you possessed any loftiness of mind,\" my mother used to say, while\r\nshe made the toast, \"you would never think twice of so low a thing as\r\nmoney, against the education of your only child; or at least you would\r\nget them to take it out in soap.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many times must I tell you, my dear, that every boy brings his own\r\nquarter of a pound? As for their monthly wash, John Windsor's boy, Jack,\r\nis there, and they get it out of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That makes it so much the more disgraceful,\" my mother would answer,\r\nwith tears in her eyes, \"that Jack Windsor should be there, and no Tommy\r\nUpmore! We are all well aware that Mr. Windsor boils six vats for one of\r\nours; and sixty, perhaps, if he likes to say it. But, on the other hand,\r\nhe has six children against our one; and which is worth the most?\"\r\n\r\nMy father used to get up nearly always, when it came to this, and take\r\nhis last cup standing, as if his work could not wait for him. However,\r\nit was forced into his mind, more and more every morning, that my\r\nlearning must come to a question of hard cash, which he never did\r\napprove of parting with. And the more he had to think of it, the less he\r\nsmiled about it. At last, after cold meat for dinner three days running,\r\nhe put his best coat on and walked off straightway for the\r\n_Partheneion_, which is in Ball's Pond, Islington. He did not come home\r\nin at all a good temper, but boiled a good hour after boiling time, and\r\nwould not let any one know, for several days, what had gone amiss with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFor my part, having, as behoves a boy, no wild ambition to be educated,\r\nand hearing from Jack Windsor what a sad case he was in, I played in the\r\nroads, and upon the cinder-hills, and danced defiance at the classic\r\npile, which could be seen afar sometimes, when the smoke was blowing the\r\nother way. But while I was playing, sad work went on, and everything was\r\nsettled without my concurrence. Mrs. Rumbelow herself, the Doctor's\r\nwife, lady president of the college, although in a deeply interesting\r\nstate--as dates will show hereafter--not only came in a cab to visit my\r\nmother, but brought with her on the dicky, as if he were nobody, the\r\nseventh nephew of the Lord Mayor of London, who could do a Greek tree,\r\nif it was pencilled out.\r\n\r\nThis closed all discussion, and clenched my fate, and our tailor was\r\nordered to come next morning. My father had striven his utmost to get me\r\ntaken as a day-boy, or at any rate to be allowed to keep a book against\r\nthe Muses. But Mrs. Rumbelow waved her hand, and enlarged upon liberal\r\nassociations, and the higher walks of literature, to such an extent that\r\nmy father could not put a business foot in anywhere. And before I was\r\nsent to bed that night, when I went for my head to be patted, and to get\r\na chuck below the chin, he used words which hung long in my memory.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Tommy, thy troubles are at hand;\" he said, with a tender gaze at\r\nme beneath his pipe. \"They can't make no profit from the victualling of\r\nthy mind; but they mean to have it out of thy body, little chap. 'Tis a\r\nwoe as goes always to the making of a man. And the Lord have mercy on\r\nthee, my son Tommy!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[1] Sir Thomas cannot be accepted here, without a good-sized grain of\r\nsalt. Exciting as his adventures are, and sanguine as his nature is,\r\nwhat can he be thinking of, in the present distress of publisher, strict\r\neconomy of libraries, and bankruptcy of the United States?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_ITUR AD ASTRA._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grandest result of education is the revival of the human system,\r\nwhich ensues when it is over. If it be of all pangs the keenest to\r\nremember joy in woe, and of all pleasures the sweetest to observe\r\nanother's travail, upon either principle, accommodated (as all\r\nprinciples are) to suit the purpose, how vast the delight of manhood in\r\nreflecting upon its boyhood!\r\n\r\nDr. Rumbelow, of the _Partheneion_, which is in Trotter's Lane, Ball's\r\nPond, combined high gifts of nature with rich ornaments of learning. In\r\nvirtue of all this, he strove against the tendency of the age towards\r\nflippancy, and self-indulgence, the absence of every high principle, and\r\nthe presence of every low one. Having to fill both the heads and the\r\nstomachs of thirty-five highly respectable boys, he bestirred himself\r\nonly in the mental part, and deputed to others the bodily--not from any\r\ngreed, or want of feeling, but a high-minded hatred of business, and a\r\nlofty confidence in woman. So well grounded was this faith, that Mrs.\r\nRumbelow never failed to provide us with fine appetites.\r\n\r\nHere, and hence, I first astonished the weak minds of the public, and my\r\nown as much as anybody's. Although we had several boys of birth, the\r\nboy of largest brains and body took the lead of all of us. And this was\r\nBill Chumps, now Sir William Chumps, the well-known M.P. for St.\r\nMarylebone. His father was what was then called a \"butcher,\" but now a\r\n\"purveyor of animal provisions.\" He supplied under contract the whole\r\n_Partheneion_; and his meat was so good that we always wanted more.\r\n\r\nBill Chumps, being very quick at figures, had made bright hits about\r\nholidays impending, by noting the contents of the paternal cart, and\r\nblowing the Sibylline leaves of the meat-book, handed in by the foreman.\r\nBut even Chumps was not prepared for a thing that happened one fine\r\nFriday.\r\n\r\nWe had been at work all the afternoon, or, at any rate, we had been in\r\nschool; and a longing for something more solid than learning began to\r\nrise in our young breasts.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shouldn't I like a good pig's fry?\" the boy next to me was\r\nwhispering.\r\n\r\n\"Or a big help out of a rump-steak pie?\" said the fellow beyond him,\r\nwith his slate-sponge to his mouth.\r\n\r\nBut Chumps said, \"Bosh! What's the good of pigs and pastry? Kidneys, and\r\nmushrooms, is my ticket, Tommy. Give us the benefit of your opinion.\"\r\n\r\nChumps was always very good to me, although I was under his lowest\r\nwaistcoat-button. For my father was a very good customer of that eminent\r\nbutcher his father; not only when he wanted a choice bit of meat, but\r\nalso as taking at a contract-price all bones that could not be sent out\r\nat a shilling a pound, as well as all the refuse fat, which now makes\r\nthe best fresh butter.\r\n\r\nIn reply to that important question, I looked up at Chumps, with a\r\nmixture of hesitation and gratitude. Being a sensitive boy, I found it\r\nso hard to give an opinion without offence to elder minds, yet so\r\nfoolish to seem to have no opinion, and to spoil all the honour of being\r\nconsulted. A sense of responsibility made me pause, and ponder,\r\nconcerning the best of all the many good things there are to eat, and to\r\nlay \"mechanically,\" as novelists express it, both hands upon a certain\r\nempty portion of my organization, when Dr. Rumbelow arose!\r\n\r\nWe did not expect him to get up yet for nearly three-quarters of an\r\nhour, unless any boy wanted caning; and at first a cold tremor ran\r\nthrough our inmost bones, because we respected him so deeply. But a\r\nglance at his countenance reassured us. The doctor stood up, with his\r\ncollege-cap on, a fine smile lifting his gabled eyebrows (as the evening\r\nsun lights up gray thatch), his tall frame thrown back, and his terrible\r\nright hand peacefully, under his waistcoat, loosening the button of\r\ndidactic cincture. He spread forth the other hand, with no cane in it;\r\nand a yawn--such as we should have had a smack for--came to keep company\r\nwith his smile.\r\n\r\n\"Boys!\" he shouted, sternly at first, from the force of habit when we\r\nmade a noise; \"boys, Lacedæmonians, Partheneionidæ, hearken to the words\r\nwhich I, with friendly meaning, speak among you. It has been ordained by\r\nthe powers above, holding Olympian mansions, that all things come in\r\ncircling turn to mortal men who live on corn. Times there are for the\r\ndiligent study of the mighty minds of old, such as we, who now see light\r\nof sun, and walk the many-feeding earth, may never hope to equal. But\r\nagain there are seasons, when the _dies festi_ must be held, and the\r\n_feriæ Latinæ_, which a former pupil of mine translated 'a holiday from\r\nLatin.' Such a season now is with us. Once more it has pleased the good\r\nLucina to visit our humble _tugurium_; and we are strictly called upon\r\nto observe the _meditrinalia_. Since which things are so, it behoves me\r\nto proclaim to all of you _feriæ tridui imperativæ_.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor's speech had been so learned, that few of us were able to\r\nmake out his meaning. But Chumps was a boy of vast understanding, and\r\nextraordinary culture.\r\n\r\n\"Three days' holiday. Holloa, boys, holloa!\" cried Chumps, with his cap\r\ngoing up to the roof. \"Three days' holiday! Rump-steak for breakfast,\r\nand lie a-bed up to nine o'clock. Hurrah, boys! holloa louder, louder,\r\nlouder! Again, again, again! Why, you don't half holloa!\"\r\n\r\nTo the ear of reason it would have been brought home, that the boys were\r\nholloaing quite loud enough; and of that opinion was our master, who\r\nlaid his hands under his silvery locks, while the smile of good-will to\r\nus, whom he loved and chastened, came down substantially to the margin\r\nof his shave. But behold, to him thus beholding, a new and hitherto\r\nunheard-of prodigy, wonderful to be told, arose! He sought for his\r\nspectacles, and put them on; and then for his cane, and laid hold of\r\nit--because he beheld going up into the air, and likely to get out of\r\nhis reach, a boy!\r\n\r\nIt is not for me to say how I did it. Nobody was more amazed than I\r\nwas; although after all that had happened ere now to me, I might have\r\nbeen prepared for it. Much as I try to remember what my feelings were,\r\nall I can say is that I really know not; and perhaps the confusion\r\nproduced by going round so (to which I was not yet accustomed), and of\r\nlooking downward at the place I used to stand on, helped to make it hard\r\nfor me to think what I was up to.\r\n\r\nWith no consideration, as to what I was about, and no sense of being out\r\nof ordinary ways, I found myself leaving all the ground, and its places,\r\nnot with any jump, or other kind of rashness, but gently, equably, and\r\nin good balance, rising to the shoulders of the other little chaps, and\r\nthen over the heads of the tallest ones. My sandals, because of the\r\nweather being warm, were tied with light-blue ribbon, according to the\r\nwishes of my mother; and these made a show which I looked down at, while\r\neverybody else stared up at them.\r\n\r\nChumps was a very tall boy for his age, by reason of all the\r\nmarrow-bones he got; and the same thing had gifted him with high\r\ncourage. So that while all the other boys could only stare, or run away,\r\nif their nerves were quick, he made a spring with both hands at my feet,\r\nto fetch me back to the earth again. And at the same instant he said,\r\n\"Tommy!\" in the very kindest tone of voice, entreating me to come down\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nI do not exaggerate in saying that I strove with all my power to do\r\nthis; and with his kind help I might have done it, if the string of my\r\nshoe had been sewed in. But unhappily, like most things now, it was made\r\nfor ornament more than use; and so it slipped out and was left in his\r\nhand; while, much against my will, I rose higher and higher. At the same\r\ntime I found myself going round and round, so that I could not continue\r\nto observe the countenance of Dr. Rumbelow, gazing sternly, and with\r\nsome surprise, at me. But I saw him put on his spectacles, which was\r\nalways a bad sign for us.\r\n\r\n\"_Capnobatæ_ is the true reading in Strabo, as I have so long contended.\r\nFetch me a cane!--a long, long, cane!\" the doctor shouted, as I still\r\nwent up. \"This is the spirit of the rising age! I have long expected\r\nsomething of this kind. I will quell it, if I have to tie three canes\r\ntogether. Thomas Upmore, come down, that I may cane you. Not upon my\r\nhead, boy, or how can I do it?\"\r\n\r\nFor no sooner had I heard what was likely to befall me, than my heart\r\nseemed to turn into a lump of cold lead. At once my airy revolutions\r\nceased, my hands (which had been hovering like butterflies) stopped, and\r\ndropped, like beetles that have struck against a post, and down I came\r\nplump, with both feet upon the tassel of the trencher-cap upon the\r\ndoctor's head.\r\n\r\nThis must have been a very trying moment, both for his patience and my\r\ncourage, and it is not fair to expect me to remember everything that\r\nhappened. However, I feel that if I had been caned, there would have\r\nbeen a mark upon my memory; even as boys bear the limits of the parish\r\nin their minds, through their physical geography. Likely enough my head\r\nwas giddy, from so much revolving; and Chumps living near us marched me\r\nhome, with a big lexicon strapped on my back, to prevent me from trying\r\nto fly again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people, and more especially our writers of fiction, history,\r\nphilosophy, and so forth, indulge in reflection, at those moments, when\r\nthey are soaring above our heads; but I have always found myself so\r\nunlucky in this matter, as in many others, that nothing would ever come\r\ninto my head, when aloft, to be any good when I came down. Or, at least\r\nonly once, as will be shown hereafter; and that was the exception, which\r\nproves the rule.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I might now give many nice and precise descriptions of\r\n\"variant motions and emotions, both somatic and psychical\"--as Professor\r\nBrachipod expressed them--which must, according to his demonstration,\r\nhave been inside me, at my first flight. Very likely they were; and even\r\nif they were not, it would never pay me to be positive--or negative\r\nperhaps is the proper word now--because ignorant science is\r\nremunerative, and nothing can be got by impugning it.\r\n\r\nYet that consideration, I assure you, has nothing to do with my present\r\nsilence. I am silent, simply because I know nothing; and if all so\r\nplaced would try my plan, how much less would be said and written!\r\nNevertheless all biologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and the\r\nrest of our race who make it their study (after proving it wholly below\r\ntheir heed) these men, if they deign to be called such, have a claim\r\nupon me for all my facts; which I will not grudge, when I know them.\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset, they felt this; and my father and mother, who had\r\nnot slept well, through talking so much of my above adventure--recounted\r\nperhaps with some embellishment by Chumps--hardly had got through their\r\nbreakfast before some eminent \"scientists\" were at them. For my part,\r\nhaving made a hearty supper, (after long scarcity of butcher's meat,) or\r\nperhaps from having swallowed so much air, I had slept long and soundly,\r\nand was turning for another good sleep, when I heard great voices.\r\n\r\n\"Madam, allow me to express surprise,\" were the words which came up to\r\nme, through the ceiling, at the place where my head had made the hole,\r\n\"extreme surprise at the narrowness of your views. Must I come to the\r\nconclusion, that you refuse to forward the interests of science?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied mother, who was always polite, when she failed to make\r\nout what people meant, \"science is what I don't know from the moon. But\r\nI do know what my Tommy is.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Upmore,\" was the answer, in a soft sweet voice, which I\r\nfound afterwards to be that of Professor Brachipod, \"in consulting the\r\ninterests of science, we shall consult those of the beloved Tommy. His\r\nexistence is so interwoven with a newly formed theory of science\"----\r\n\r\n\"You impudent hop'-my-thumb, what do you mean,\" broke in a deep sound,\r\nwhich I knew to be my father's, \"by calling my wife your dear indeed?\r\nFirst time as ever you set eyes on her. Out you go, and no mistake.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this ensued a heavy tread, and a little unscientific squeak; and\r\nout went Professor Brachipod, as lightly as if on the wings of his\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n\"Upmore, this violence is a mistake,\" another and larger voice broke in,\r\nas my father came back quietly; \"the Professor's views may be erroneous;\r\nbut to eliminate him, because of somatic inferiority, is counter to the\r\ntendency of the age. My theory differs from his, _toto coelo_. But in\r\nthe cause of pure reason, I protest against unmanly recourse to\r\nphysics.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall have the same physick, if you don't clear out;\" said my\r\nfather, as peaceable a man as need be, till his temper was put up; \"an\r\nEnglishman's house is his castle. No science have a right to come\r\nspoiling his breakfast. You call me unmanly, in your big words. You are\r\na big man, and now I'll tackle you. Out goes Professor Jargoon.\"\r\n\r\nThere was some little scuffle, before this larger Professor was\r\n\"eliminated,\" because he was a strong man, and did not like to go; but\r\nwithout much labour he was placed outside.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if either of you two chaps comes back,\" my father shouted from his\r\nthreshold, \"the science he gets will be my fist. And lucky for him, he\r\nhaven't had it yet.\"\r\n\r\nRunning to the window of my room, I saw the professors, arm-in-arm,\r\ngoing sadly up the cinder-heaps; and glad as I was to be quit of them, I\r\ndid not like the way of it. However, I hoped for the best, and went\r\ndown in my trousers and braces to breakfast. My father was gone to his\r\nboiling by this time, for nothing must ever interfere with that; but my\r\nmother would never give up her breakfast, till she saw the bottom of the\r\nteapot.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tommy darling,\" she cried, as she caught me, and kissed me quite\r\ninto the china-cupboard, for we always had breakfast in the kitchen,\r\nwhen out of a maid-of-all-work: \"my own little Tommy, do you know why\r\nyou fly? All the greatest men in the kingdom have been here, to prove\r\nthat you do it from reasons of Herod, Heroditical something--but he was\r\na bad man, and murdered a million of little ones. They may prove what\r\nthey like; and of course they know more about my own child, than I do. I\r\ndon't care that for their science,\" said mother, snapping her thumb,\r\nwhich was large and very fat; \"but tell me, Tommy, from your own dear\r\nfeelings, what it was that made you fly so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't fly, mother; I only went up, because I could not help it.\r\nBecause I was so empty, and felt certain of getting full again, quite\r\nearly in the holidays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Begin at once, darling, and don't talk. Oh, it is a cruel, cruel thing,\r\nthat you should leave the ground for want of victuals, when your father\r\nclears eight pounds a week. Deny it as he may, I can prove it to him.\r\nBut I have found out what makes you fly. A flip for their science, and\r\nthundering words!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, mother, I don't want to do it again;\" I answered as well as I\r\ncould, with my mouth quite full of good bacon, and a baker's roll; \"but\r\ndo please tell me what made me do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, the reason is out of the Bible. You cannot help flying, just\r\nbecause you are an angel.\"\r\n\r\n\"They never told me that at school,\" I said; \"and old Rum would have\r\ncaned me, if he could reach. But he never would have dared to cane an\r\nangel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Tommy, hush! How dare you call that learned old gentleman, with\r\nwhite hair, 'old Rum'? But never mind, darling. Whatever you do, don't\r\nleave off eating.\"\r\n\r\nFor this I might be trusted, after all I had been through; and so well\r\ndid I spend my days at home (especially when Bill Chumps came to dine\r\nwith us, upon his own stipulation what the dinner was to be), that\r\ninstead of going up into the air at all, the stoutest lover of his\r\nnative land could not have surpassed me in sticking to it.\r\n\r\nChumps, though the foremost of boys, was inclined to be shy with\r\ngrown-up people, till mother emboldened him with ginger-wine, and then\r\nhe gave such an account of my exploit, that my father, and mother,\r\nlooked at him with faces as different as could be. My mother's face was\r\nall eyes and mouth, with admiration, delight, excitement, vigorous\r\nfaith, and desire for more; my father's face was all eyebrows, nose, and\r\nlips; and he shook his big head, that neighbour Chumps should have such\r\na liar for his eldest son. Nothing but the evidence of his own eyes\r\nwould ever convince Bucephalus Upmore, that a son of his, or of any\r\nother Englishman, came out of an egg; without which there was no flying.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Upmore, you should be ashamed of yourself,\" my mother broke in\r\nrather sharply, \"to argue such questions before young boys. But since\r\nyou must edify us, out with your proof that the blessed angels were so\r\nborn. Or will you deny them the power to fly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never did I claim,\" answered father, with a little wink at Chumps, \"to\r\nknow the ins and outs of angels, not having married one, as some folk\r\ndo, until they discover the difference. Our Tommy is a good boy enough,\r\nin his way; but no angel, no more than his parents be. If ever I see him\r\ngo up like a bubble, I'll fetch him down sharp with my clout-rake; but\r\nif I don't use my rake till then, it will last out my lifetime, I'll bet\r\na guinea. Now, Tommy, feed, and don't talk or look about. You'll be\r\nsorry when you get back to school, for every moment that you have\r\nwasted.\"\r\n\r\n\"My mind is not altogether clear,\" said mother, \"about letting him go\r\nback to the Latin Pantheon\"--this was her name for the _Partheneion_;\r\n\"he is welcome to have a gentle fly now and then, as Providence has so\r\nendowed him, and I am sure he would never fly away from his own mother;\r\nbut as for his flying, because he is empty in his poor inside--I'll not\r\nhear of it. Bucephalus, how would you like it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't say at all, mother, till I have tried it. Shall be glad to hear\r\nTommy's next experience. Back he goes to-morrow morning; and by this day\r\nweek, if they starve him well, he'll be fit to go sky-high again. A\r\nlikely thing, indeed, that I should pay ten guineas beforehand, for a\r\nquarter's board, and tuition in classics and mathematics, all of the\r\nfinest quality, and another ten guineas in lieu of notice, and get only\r\nthree weeks for the whole of it! Come, Tommy, how much have you learned,\r\nmy boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, ever such a lot, father! I am sure I don't know what.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my son, give us a sample of it. Unless there's too much to break\r\nbulk at random. Tip us a bit of your learning, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, father, till I've got my fingers up. When they come right,\r\nI say _hic_, _hæc_, _hoc_, and the singular number of _musa_, a song. I\r\nhave told mother every word of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Out and out beautiful it sounds,\" said mother; \"quite above business,\r\nand what goes on in the week. Dr. Rumbelow must be a wonderful man, to\r\nhave made such great inventions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's very hard to pay for it, and leave it in the clouds,\" my\r\nfather said, sniffing as if he smelled pudding. \"Let's have some more of\r\nit, sky-high Tommy.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother looked at me, as much as to say, \"Now, my dear son, astonish\r\nhim\"; and my conscience told me that I ought to do it; and I felt myself\r\ntrying very hard indeed to think; but not a Latin word would come of it.\r\nPerhaps I might have done it, if it had not been for Chumps, who kept on\r\nputting up his mouth, to blow me some word, bigger than the one that I\r\nwas after; while all that I wanted was a little one. And father leaned\r\nback, with a wink, to encourage me to take the shine out of himself, by\r\nmy learning. But I could only lick my spoon.\r\n\r\n\"Come, if that is ten guineas' worth of Latin,\" said my father, \"I\r\nshould like to know what sixpenn'orth is. Tell us the Latin for\r\nsixpence, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was natural that I should not know this; and I doubt whether even\r\nChumps did, for he turned away, lest I should ask him. But my mother\r\nnever would have me trampled on.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Upmore, you need not be vulgar,\" she said, \"because you have had no\r\nadvantages. Would you dare to speak so, before Latin scholars? Even\r\nMaster Chumps is blushing for you; and his father a man of such fine\r\ncommon sense! No sensible person can doubt, for a moment, that Tommy\r\nknows a great many words of Latin, but is not to be persecuted out of\r\nthem, in that very coarse manner, at dinner time. Tell me, my dear,\" she\r\nsaid, turning to me, for I was fit to cry almost, \"what is the reason\r\nthat you can't bring out your learning. I am sure that you have it, my\r\nchick; and there must be some very good reason for keeping it in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, I'll tell you what it is,\" I answered, looking at my father, more\r\nthan her; \"there is such a lot of it, it all sticks together.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the best thing I ever heard in my life;\" cried father, as soon\r\nas he could stop laughing, while Chumps was grinning wisely, with his\r\nmouth full of pudding. \"What a glorious investment of my ten guineas, to\r\nhave a son so learned, that he can't produce a word of it, because it\r\nall sticks together! To-morrow, my boy, you shall go back for the rest\r\nof it. Like a lump of grains it seems to be, that you can't get into\r\nwith a mashing-stick. Ah, I shall tell that joke to-night!\"\r\n\r\n\"So you may,\" said mother, \"so you may, Bucephalus; but don't let us\r\nhave any more of it. 'Tis enough to make any boy hate learning, to be\r\nblamed for it, so unjustly. Would he ever have flown, if it had not been\r\nfor Latin? And that shows how much he has got of it. Answer that, if\r\nyou can, Mr. Upmore.\"\r\n\r\nBut my father was much too wise to try. \"Sophy, you beat me there,\" he\r\nsaid; \"I never was much of a hand at logic, as all the clever ladies\r\nare. Bill Chumps shall have a glass of wine after his pudding, and Tommy\r\ndrink water like a flying fish; and you may pour me a drop from the\r\nblack square bottle, as soon as you have filled my pipe, my dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will, Bucephalus, with great pleasure; if you will promise me\r\none little thing. If Tommy goes back to that Latin Pantheon, they must\r\nlet him come home, every Sunday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fly home to his nest, to prevent him from flying;\" my father replied,\r\nwith a smile of good humour, for he liked to see his pipe filled;\r\n\"encourage his crop, and discourage his wings. 'Old Rum,' as they call\r\nhim, wouldn't hear of that at first. But perhaps he will, now that he\r\nhas turned out such a flyer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PURSUIT OF SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people seem to find the world grow worse, the more they have of it;\r\nthat they may be ready to go perhaps to a higher and better region. But\r\nnever has this been the case with me, although I am a staunch\r\nConservative. My settled opinion is that nature (bearing in her reticule\r\nthe human atom) changes very slowly, so that boys are boys, through\r\nrolling ages; even as Adam must have been, if he had ever been a boy.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the boys at Dr. Rumbelow's were not so much better than\r\nboys are now, as to be quoted against them. They certainly seem to have\r\nhad more courage, more common-sense, and simplicity, together with less\r\naffectation, daintiness, vanity, and pretension. But, on the other hand,\r\nthey were coarser, wilder, and more tyrannical, and rejoiced more freely\r\nthan their sons do now, in bullying the little ones. The first thing a\r\nnew boy had to settle was his exact position in the school; not in point\r\nof scholarship, or powers of the mind, but as to his accomplishments at\r\nfisticuff. His first duty was to arrange his schoolfellows in three\r\ndefinite classes--those who could whack him and he must abide it, those\r\nhe would hit again if they hit him, and those he could whack without\r\nany danger, whenever a big fellow had whacked him. Knowledge of the\r\nworld, and of nature also, was needed for making this arrangement well:\r\nto over-esteem, or to undervalue self, brought black eyes perpetual, or\r\nuniversal scorn.\r\n\r\nBut to me, alas, no political study of this kind was presented. All the\r\nother boys could whack me, and expostulation led to more. Because I was\r\nthe smallest, and most peaceful, among all the little ones, and the\r\nbuoyancy of my nature made a heavy blow impossible. Yet upon the whole,\r\nthe others were exceedingly kind and good to me, rejoicing to ply me\r\nwith countless nicknames, of widely various grades of wit, suggested by\r\nmy personal appearance, and the infirmity of lightness. Tom-tit,\r\nButterfly-Upmore, Flying Tommy, and Skylark, were some of the names that\r\nI liked best, and answered to most freely; while I could not bear to be\r\ncalled Soap-suds, Bubbly, Blue-bottle, or Blow-me-tight. But whatever it\r\nwas, it served its turn; and the boy, who had been witty at my expense,\r\nfelt less disposed to knock me.\r\n\r\nBut, even as with the full-grown public, opinion once formed is loth to\r\nbudge, so with these boys it was useless to argue, that having flown\r\nonce, I could not again do it. If they would have allowed me simply to\r\nmaintain the opposite, or to listen mutely to their proofs, it would\r\nhave been all right for either side. But when they came pricking me up,\r\nwith a pin in the end of a stick, or a two-pronged fork (such as used to\r\nsatisfy a biped with his dinner, and a much better dinner then he gets\r\nnow), endeavouring also to urge me on high, by an elevating grasp of my\r\nhair and ears, you may well believe me, when I say how sadly I lamented\r\nmy exploit above. I was ready to go up, I was eager to go up; not only\r\nto satisfy public demand, but also to get out of the way of it; and more\r\nthan once I did go up, some few inches, in virtue of the tugs above, and\r\npricks in lower parts of me. But no sooner did I begin to rise, with\r\ngeneral expectation raised, and more forks ready to go into me, than\r\ndown I always came again, calling in vain for my father and mother,\r\nbecause I could not help it.\r\n\r\nUpon such occasions, no one had the fairness to allow for my\r\ncircumstances. Every one vowed that I could fly as well as ever, if I\r\ntried in earnest; and I was too young to argue with them, and point out\r\nthe real cause; to wit the large and substantial feeding, in which I\r\nemployed my Sundays. By reason of this I returned to school, every\r\nMonday morning, with a body as heavy as my mind almost; and to stir up\r\neither of them was useless, for a long time afterwards.\r\n\r\nAs ill luck would have it, it was on a Monday, that science made her\r\nnext attack on me. And now let me say, that if ever you find me (from\r\nyour own point of view) uncandid, bigoted, narrow-minded, unsynthetical,\r\nunphilosophical, or anything else that is wicked and low, when it fails\r\nto square with theories,--in the spirit of fair play you must remember\r\nwhat a torment science has been to me.\r\n\r\nFive of them came, on that Monday afternoon, four in a four-wheeler, and\r\none on the dicky; and we had a boy who could see things crooked, through\r\nsome peculiar cast of eye, and though the windows were six feet over\r\nhis head, he told us all about it, and we knew that he was right.\r\n\r\nPresently in came the doctor's page (a boy who was dressed like Mercury,\r\nbut never allowed in the schoolroom, unless he had urgent cause to\r\nshow); his name was Bob Jackson, and we had rare larks with his clothes,\r\nwhenever we got hold of him--and he waved above his head, as his orders\r\nwere to do, a very big letter for the doctor. Every boy of us rushed\r\ninto a certainty of joy--away with books, and away to play! But woe,\r\ninstead of bliss, was the order of the day. Dr. Rumbelow never allowed\r\nhimself to be hurried, or flurried, by anything, except the appearance\r\nof his babies; and when he was made, as he was by and by, a Bishop, for\r\nfinding out something in Lycophron, that nobody else could make head or\r\ntail of, he is said to have taken his usual leisure, in loosing the\r\nbutton enforced by Mrs. Rumbelow, ere ever he broke the Prime Minister's\r\nseal.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" he said now, after looking at us well, to see if anybody wanted\r\ncaning, \"lads who combine the discipline of Sparta with the versatile\r\ngrace of Athens, Mr. Smallbones will now attend to you. Under his\r\ndiligent care, you will continue your studies eagerly. In these\r\ndegenerate days, hard science tramples on the arts more elegant. Happy\r\nare ye, who can yet devote your hours to the lighter muses. At the stern\r\ncall of science (who has no muse, but herself is an Erinnys), I leave\r\nyou in the charge of Mr. Smallbones. Icarillus, you will follow me, and\r\nbring the light cane, with the ticket No. 7. A light cane is sweeter for\r\nvery little boys.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart went down to my heels, while bearing my fate in my hands, I\r\nfollowed him. Conscience had often reproached me, for not being able to\r\nfly, to please the boys. Universal consent had declared that it all was\r\nmy fault, and I ought to pay out for it. What was the use of my trying\r\nto think that the world was all wrong, and myself alone right? Very\r\ngreat men, like Athanasius, might be able to believe it; but a poor\r\nlittle Tommy like me could not. But I tried hard to say to the doctor's\r\ncoat-tails, \"Oh, please not to do it, sir, if you can please to help\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Rumbelow turned, as we crossed a stone passage (where my knees\r\nknocked together from the want of echo, and a cold shiver crept into my\r\nbones), and, seeing the state of my mind and body, and no boy anywhere\r\nnear us, he could not help saying, \"My poor Icarillus, cheer up, rouse\r\nup, _tharsei_! The Romans had no brief forms of encouragement, because\r\nthey never required it. But the small and feeble progeny of this\r\ndecadent country--Don't cry, brave Icarillus; don't cry, poor little\r\nfellow; none shall touch you but myself. What terror hath invaded you?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor stooped, and patted my head, which was covered with thick\r\ngolden curls, and I raised my streaming eyes to him, and pointed with\r\none hand at the cane, which was trembling in my other hand. My master\r\nindulged in some Latin quotation, or it may have been Greek for aught I\r\nknow, and then translated, and amplified it, as his manner was with a\r\njunior pupil.\r\n\r\n\"Boys must weep. This has been ordained most wisely by the immortal\r\ngods, to teach them betimes the lesson needed in the human life, more\r\noften than any other erudition. But, alas for thee, poor Icaridion! it\r\nseems, as from the eyes afar, a thing unjust, and full of _thambos_. For\r\nthou hast not aimed at, nor even desired, the things that are unlawful,\r\nbut rather hast been ensnared therein, by means of some necessity hard\r\nto be avoided. Therefore I say again, cheer up, Tommy! Science may vaunt\r\nherself, as being the mistress of the now happening day, and of that\r\nwhich has been ordained to follow; but I am the master of my own cane.\r\nThomas Upmore, none shall smite thee.\"\r\n\r\nA glow of joy came into my heart, and dried up my tears in a wink or\r\ntwo, for we knew him to be a true man of his word, whether to cane, or\r\nto abstain; and if the professors had kept in the background, I might\r\nhave soared up for them, then and there. But it never is their nature to\r\ndo that; and before I had time to be really happy, four out of the five\r\nwere upon me. Hearing the doctor's fine loud voice, they could no more\r\ncontain themselves, but dashed out upon us, like so many dragons, on the\r\nback of their own eminence--Professors Brachipod, and Jargoon,\r\nChocolous, and Mullicles; than whom are none more eminent on the roll of\r\nmodern science. The fifth, and greatest of them all, whose name shall\r\nnever be out-rubbed by time, but cut deeper every year, Professor\r\nMegalow, sat calmly on a three-legged stool, which he had found.\r\n\r\nNone of these learned gentlemen had seen my little self before; and an\r\nearnest desire arose in my mind, that not one of them ever should see me\r\nagain. Their eyes were beaming with intellect, and their arms spread out\r\nlike sign-posts; and I made off at once, without waiting to think, till\r\nthe doctor's deep voice stopped me.\r\n\r\n\"Icarillus,\" he said, and though he could not catch them, my legs could\r\ngo no further, \"Athena, the Muses, and Phoebus himself, command thee to\r\nface the enemy. This new, and prosaic, and uncouth power, which calls\r\nitself 'science,' as opposed to learning, wisdom, and large\r\nphilosophy--excuse me, gentlemen, I am speaking in the abstract--this\r\narrogant upstart is so rampant, because people run away from her. Tommy,\r\ncome hither; these gentlemen are kind, very kind--don't be afraid,\r\nTommy; you may stand in the folds of my gown, if you like. Answer any\r\nquestion they may ask, and fly again, if they can persuade you.\r\nProfessors Brachipod, and Jargoon, Chocolous, and Mullicles, my little\r\npupil is at your service.\"\r\n\r\nBeginning to feel my own importance, I began to grow quite brave almost,\r\nand ventured to take down my hands from my face, and turn round a\r\nlittle, and peep from the corners of my eyes at these great magicians.\r\nAnd as soon as I saw, that the foremost of them had been carried out of\r\nour house by father, and sent away over the cinder-heaps, there came a\r\nsort of rising in my mind, which told me to try to stick up to them. And\r\nwhen they fell out one with another, as they lost no time in doing, they\r\nmade me think somehow about the old women who came to pick over our\r\nash-heaps--until through the doorway I saw another face, the kindest and\r\ngrandest I ever had seen, the face of Professor Megalow.\r\n\r\nBefore I had time to get afraid again, there was no chance left to run\r\naway; for the four professors had occupied all the four sides of my\r\nbody. They poked me, and pulled me in every direction, and felt every\r\ntender part of me, and would have been glad to unbutton my raiment, if\r\nthe master had allowed it. And they used such mighty words as nobody may\r\nreproduce correctly, unless he was born, or otherwise endowed, with a\r\nten-chain tape at the back of his tongue. Every one talked, as fast as\r\nif the rest were listening eagerly; and every one listened, as much as\r\nif the rest had nought to say to him. For all worked different walks of\r\nscience, and each was certain that the other's walk was crooked.\r\n\r\nI assure you, that this was a very difficult thing for me to deal with,\r\nhaving so many tongues going on about me, and so many hands going into\r\nme, and a strong pull in one direction, crossed by a stronger push in\r\nthe other. Moreover, two learned gentlemen wanted to throw me up\r\nperpendicular; while other two, of equal learning, would launch me on\r\nhigh horizontally. Between, and among, and amid them all, there was like\r\nto be nothing but specimens left of unfortunate Tommy Upmore.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen!\" shouted Dr. Rumbelow; but they did not answer to\r\nthat name. \"Professors, professors, forbear, I beseech you. Is this\r\nscientific investigation? I will have no vivisection here\"--for they\r\nhurt me so much, that I now screamed out--\"I am sorry to lay hands upon\r\nyou, but humanity compels me. Now, unless you all sit down, I shall send\r\nArgeiphontes for the police. I grieve that you drive me to such strong\r\nmeasures. But I cannot have my little Icarus treated like Orpheus, or\r\nActæon.\"\r\n\r\nLuckily for me the doctor's body might vie with his mind in grasp of\r\nsubject; and he soon had Professors Brachipod, Jargoon, and Mullicles\r\nseated in their chairs. But the fourth professor (whose name was\r\nChocolous, and himself a foreigner of some kind) entreated that he might\r\nnot be compelled to sit.\r\n\r\n\"Not for five, six, seven year, have I seet in ze shair,\" he cried, with\r\nhis arms spread out, and his back in a shake against some degradation;\r\n\"I must not, and I will not, seet. Herr Doctor, in many languages\r\nlaboriously excellent, present not to me zis grade indignity. I vill\r\nkeek, if you not leave off.\"\r\n\r\nHe was very angry, but his friends seemed to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n\"Oblige me, gentlemen,\" said Dr. Rumbelow, decorously quitting this\r\nexcitement, \"by telling me, why your learned friend resists my kindly\r\nefforts. When the body is seated, the mind is calm. What find we in\r\nPlato upon that subject? Not only once, but even thrice, in a single\r\ndialogue, we discover, directly and inferentially----\"\r\n\r\n\"A flip for those old codgers, sir!\" exclaimed Professor Brachipod.\r\n\"Chocolous knows more than fifty Platos, though his leading idea is\r\nfundamentally erroneous\"--(\"I say nah, I say non, I say bosh!\" broke in\r\nProfessor Chocolous)--\"his leading idea that the human race may recover\r\nits primordial tail, by abstaining, for only a few generations----\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven chenerations, first; and when he have attained one yoint, seven\r\nmore. I am ze first. But in two, tree, four hundred year, continued in\r\nze female line, wizout ever going upon ze shair----\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Chocolous!\" broke in Professor Mullicles. \"How can molecular\r\naccretion ever be affected by human habitude? 'Tis a simple inversion\r\nof the fundamental process. Every schoolboy now is perfectly aware, that\r\nthe protoplasmatic anthropomorphism was a single joint of tail.\r\nMolecular accretion immediately commenced; and the result--is such a\r\nfellow as you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"And such a fellow as Professor Megalow,\" the little German answered,\r\nwith quiet self-respect; \"if I vos one, he vos ze oder. Professor\r\nMegalow, vot for, you stay back so?\"\r\n\r\n\"My reason for staying back so, as our learned friend expresses it,\"\r\nsaid the tall man, with the kind and noble face, at last advancing, \"is\r\nthat the matter now in hand, though deeply interesting, and (to judge by\r\nresults) even highly exciting, is one that I have never dealt with. When\r\nI was kindly asked to come, I was very glad to do so. But with your good\r\nleave, I will form no opinion; until I find some grounds for it.\"\r\n\r\nThe four men of science were struck dumb, at the rashness of such a\r\nresolution; while Dr. Rumbelow took advantage of their amazement, to say\r\na word.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Megalow, allow me the honour of shaking hands with you, sir.\r\nYou speak like a genuine acolyte of that glorious sage, Pythagoras. The\r\nereneuticon, in all truth, must precede the hermeneuticon. Whenever you\r\nlike to examine Tommy, he shall be at your service.\"\r\n\r\nThis offer was highly disinterested; but I did not enjoy its\r\nmagnanimity, especially as my protector now became so engrossed with the\r\ngreat professor, that he quite forgot poor little me.\r\n\r\n\"Now is your time, to go through with the question,\" spake the\r\narch-enemy, Brachipod, \"which, beyond all doubt, is nothing more than a\r\ncase of organic levigation----\"\r\n\r\n\"Levigation be d--d!\" cried Professor Jargoon. \"Any fool can see, that\r\nit is gaseous expansion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gaseous expansion is bosh, bosh, bosh,\" shouted Professor Chocolous;\r\n\"ze babe, zat vos born a veek longer dis day, vill tell you--bacilli,\r\nbacilli!\"\r\n\r\n\"How pleasant it would be, to hear all this nonsense,\" declared\r\nProfessor Mullicles, \"if ignorance were not so dogmatic! The merest\r\nneophyte would recognise, at once, this instance of histic fluxion.\"\r\n\r\nWithout any delay, a great uproar arose, and the four professors rushed\r\nat me, to save rushing at one another. My heart fell so low, that I\r\ncould not run away, though extremely desirous of doing so; and the\r\nutmost I could manage was to get behind a chair, and sing out for my\r\nfather and mother. This only redoubled their zeal, and I might not have\r\nbeen alive now to speak of it, had not Professor Brachipod pulled out an\r\nimplement like a butcher's steelyard, and swung back the others, with a\r\nsweep of it.\r\n\r\n\"He belongs to me. It was I who found him out. I will have the very\r\nfirst turn at him,\" he cried. \"I'll knock on the head any man, who\r\npresumes to prevent me from proving my theory. Just hold him tight,\r\nwhile I get this steel hook firmly into his collar. Now are you\r\nsatisfied? This proves everything. Can this levigation be d--d, Jargoon?\r\nAll his weight is a pound and five ounces!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned round in triumph, and a loud laugh met him. He was weighing my\r\njacket, without me inside it. For mother had told me, a hundred times,\r\nthat a child had much better be killed, than weighed. At the fright of\r\nhis touch, I slipped out of my sleeves, and set off at the top of my\r\nspeed away. In the passage, I found a side door open, and without\r\nlooking back dashed through it.\r\n\r\n\"Go it, little 'un!\" a cabman cried, the very man who had brought mine\r\nenemies; and go it I did, like a bird on the wing, without any knowledge\r\nof the ground below. Some of our boys, looking out of a window, called\r\nout, \"Well done, Tommy! You'll win the--\" something, it may have been\r\nthe Derby, I went too fast to hear what it was. Short as my legs were,\r\nthey flew like the spokes of a wheel that can never be counted; and I\r\nleft a mail-cart, and a butcher's cart too, out of sight, though they\r\ntried to keep up with me. Such was my speed, on the wings of the wind,\r\nwith my linen inflated, and my hair blown out,--the nimblest professor,\r\nthat ever yet rushed to a headlong conclusion, were slow to me. In a\r\nword, I should have distanced all those enemies, had I only taken the\r\nright road home.\r\n\r\nBut alas, when I came to the top of a rise, from which I expected to see\r\nmy dear parents, or at any rate our cinder-heap, there was nothing of\r\nthe kind in sight. The breeze had swept me up the Barnet road; and\r\nyonder was the smoke of our chimney, like a streak, a mile away down to\r\nthe left of me. All the foot of the hill, which is now panelled out into\r\nwalls, and streets, of the great cattle-market, remained to be crossed,\r\nwithout help of the wind, ere ever I was safe inside our door. And the\r\nworst of it was, that the ground had no cover,--not a house, nor a\r\ntree, nor so much as a ditch, for a smallish boy to creep along; only\r\npiles of rubbish, here and there, and a few swampy places, where snipes\r\nsometimes pitched down, to have a taste of London.\r\n\r\nTired as I was, after that great run, and scant of breath, and\r\nfaint-hearted--for the sun was gone down below Highgate Hill, and my\r\nspirits ever seem to sink with him--I started anew for my own sweet\r\nhome, by the mark of the smoke of our boiling-house. I could hear my\r\nheart going pit-a-pat, faster than my weary feet went; for the place was\r\nas lonely as science could desire, for a snug job of vivisection. Of\r\nthat grisly horror I knew not as yet the name, nor the meaning\r\nprecisely; but a boy at our school, who was a surgeon's son, used to\r\ntell things, in bed, there was no sleeping after. And once he had said,\r\n\"If they could catch you, Tommy, what a treat you would be, to be\r\nlectured on!\"\r\n\r\nAs the dusk grew deeper in the hollow places, and the ribs of the naked\r\nhills paler, I began to get more and more afraid, and to start back, and\r\nlisten at my own footstep. And before I could hear what I hoped to\r\nhear--the anvil of the blacksmith down our lane--the air began to\r\nthicken with the reeking of the earth, and the outline of everything in\r\nsight was blurred, and a very tired fellow could not tell, at any\r\nmoment, what to run away from, without running into worse. At one time,\r\nI thought of sitting down, and hiding in a dip of the ground, till night\r\ncame on, and my enemies could not see me; but although that might have\r\nbeen the safest plan, my courage would not hold out for it. So on I\r\nwent, in fear and trembling, peeping, and peering, both behind me and\r\nbefore, and longing with all my heart to see our own door.\r\n\r\nBut instead of that, oh, what a sight I saw--the most fearful that can\r\nbe imagined! From the womb of the earth, those four professors (whose\r\nnames are known all over it), Brachipod, Jargoon, Chocolous, and\r\nMullicles, came forth, and joined hands in front of me. They laughed,\r\nwith a low scientific laugh, like a surgical blade on the grindstone.\r\n\r\n\"Capital, capital!\" Brachipod cried; \"we have got him all snug to\r\nourselves, at last. Let me get my hook into my pretty little eel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Famous, famous!\" said the deep voice of Jargoon; \"now you shall see,\r\nhow I work my compressor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hoch, hoch!\" chuckled Chocolous; \"ve have catch ze leetle baird at\r\nlast. I vill demonstrate his bacilli.\"\r\n\r\nBut the one that terrified me most of all was Professor Mullicles;\r\nbecause he said nothing, but kept one hand, upon something, that shone\r\nfrom his long black cloak.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, gentlemen, kind gentle gentlemen,\" I sobbed, dropping down on my\r\nknees before them, \"do please let me go to my father, and mother. They\r\nlive close by, and they think so much of me, and I am sure they would\r\npay you, for all your inventions, a great deal more than the Government.\r\nI only flew once, and I didn't mean to fly, and I am sure it must have\r\nbeen a mistake altogether; and I will promise, upon my Sammy, as Bill\r\nChumps says, not to do it any more. Oh, please to let me go! It is so\r\nlate; and I beg your pardon humbly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eloquent, and aerial Tommy,\" replied that dreadful Brachipod, \"this\r\ncase is too momentous, in the interests of pure science, for selfish\r\nmotives to be recognized. It will be your lofty privilege, to abstract\r\nyourself, to revert to the age of unbroken continuity, when that which\r\nis now called Tommy was an atom of protobioplasm----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stow that rubbish,\" broke in Jargoon.\r\n\r\n\"Ach, ach, ach! All my yaw is on the edge!\" screamed Chocolous, dancing\r\nwith his hands up.\r\n\r\n\"Proto-potatoes!\" spoke Mullicles sternly, advancing to support his view\r\nof me.\r\n\r\n\"D--n,\" exclaimed all of them, unanimous for once, when there was no\r\nview of me to be had; \"was there ever such a little devil? After him,\r\nafter him! He can't get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't he?\" thought I, though I did not dare to speak, having not a\r\nsingle pant of breath to spare. For, while I was down on my knees for\r\nmercy, through the tears in my eyes, I had seen a lamp lit. I knew where\r\nthat lamp was, and all about it, having broken the glass of it, once or\r\ntwice, and lamps were a rarity in Maiden Lane as yet. It was not a\r\nquarter of a mile away, and the light of it shone upon my own white\r\npillow.\r\n\r\nSo when those philosophers parted hands, to shake fists at one another,\r\nout of the scientific ring I slipped, and made off, for the life of me.\r\nMy foes were not very swift of foot, and none of them would let another\r\nget before him; so that, if I had been fresh and bold, even without any\r\nbreeze to help me, I might have outstripped them easily. But my legs\r\nwere tired, and my mind dismayed; and the scientific terms, in which\r\nthey called on me to stop, were enough to make any one stick fast. And\r\nthe worst of it was, that having no coat on, I was very conspicuous in\r\nthe dusk, and had no chance of dodging to the right or left. So that I\r\ncould hear them gaining on me, and my lungs were too exhausted for me to\r\nscream out for father.\r\n\r\nThus, within an apple-toss of our back door, and with nothing but a\r\ndown-hill slope, between me and our garden, those four ogres of grim\r\nscience had me lapsing back into their grasp again. Their hands were\r\nstretched forth, in pursuit of my neck, and their breath was like flame\r\nat the tips of my ears--when a merciful Providence delivered me. I felt\r\nsomething quivering under my feet; over which I went lightly, with a\r\npuff of wind lifting the hollows of my hair, and shirt-sleeves. In an\r\ninstant, I landed on a bank of slag; but behind me was a fearful\r\nfour-fold splash!\r\n\r\nSo absorbing was my terror, and so scattered were my wits, that for ever\r\nso long I could not make out, what had happened betwixt me and my\r\npursuers, except that I was safe, and they were not. There they were,\r\nstruggling, and sputtering, and kicking--so much at least as could be\r\nseen of them--throwing up their elbows, or their heels, or heads, and\r\nexecrating nature (when their mouths were clear to do it) in the very\r\nshortest language, that has ever been evolved. At the same time, a smell\r\n(even stronger than their words) arose, and grew so thick, that they\r\ncould scarcely be seen through it.\r\n\r\nThis told me, at once, what had befallen them, or rather what they had\r\nfallen into,--videlicet, the cleaning of our vats, together with Mr.\r\nJohn Windsor's; whose refuse and scouring is run away in trucks, upon\r\nthe last Saturday of every other month. It would be hard to say, what\r\nvariety of stench, and of glutinous garbage, is not richly present here;\r\nand the men from the sewers, who conduct it to the pit, require brandy,\r\nat short intervals. In the pit, which is not more than five feet deep,\r\nyet ought to be shunned by trespassers, the surface is covered with\r\nchloride of lime, and other materials, employed to kill smell, by\r\noutsmelling it; and so a short crust forms over it, until the contents\r\nbecome firm and slab, and can be cut out, for the good of the land, when\r\nthe weather is cold, and the wind blows away.\r\n\r\nNow certain it is, that all the science they were made of, could never\r\nhave extricated those professors, without the strong arms of my father,\r\nand mother, and even small me at the end of the rope. The stuff they\r\nwere in, being only half cooled (and their bodies grown sticky with\r\nrunning so), fastened heavily on them, like tallow on a wick, closing so\r\ncompletely both mouth and eyes, that instead of giving, they could only\r\nreceive, a lesson in materialism. Professors Brachipod, and Chocolous,\r\nbeing scarcely five feet and a quarter in height, were in great danger\r\nof perishing; but Mullicles, and Jargoon, most kindly gave them a jump\r\nnow and then, for breath. And, to be quit of an unfragrant matter, and\r\ntell it more rapidly than we did it,--with the aid of a blue-man from\r\nthe Indigo works, and of two thickset waggoners, we rescued those four\r\ngentlemen from their sad situation, and condoled with them.\r\n\r\nNot for £5 per head, however, would any of our cabmen take them home;\r\nthough a man out of work had been tempted by a guinea, to relieve them a\r\nlittle, with a long-handled broom, and to flush them with a bucket,\r\nafterwards. Under heavy discouragement, they set forth on their several\r\nways, surveyed by the police at a respectful distance, on account of the\r\ndanger to the public health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\"GRIP.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mother was so frightened, at the fright I had been through, that she\r\ntook it for an urgent sign from Heaven, that my education should be\r\nstopped at once. Having had as much of school as I desired, I heartily\r\nhoped, that her opinion would prevail; but father was as obstinate as\r\never, and after the usual argument--in which she had the best of the\r\nwords perhaps, and he of the meaning--I was bound to the altar of the\r\nMuses once again, with a promise of stripes, if I should try to slip the\r\ncord. Dr. Rumbelow undertook, that no professor of anything harder than\r\nlanguages--unless it were Professor Megalow--should come in, at any door\r\nof the _Partheneion_, without having tallow poured over him, which he\r\nhad found, from high Greek authority, to be the right ointment for\r\nNeo-sophistæ. And he said that my father must have been familiar with\r\nthe passage he referred to, and had thus discomfited all the\r\nPansophistæ, better than any modern Deipnosophist could have done. But\r\nmy father said no; he had never even heard of the gentleman, with the\r\nhard name to crack; and as for them Prophesiers, they ought to have\r\nprophesied what his clots was, before tumbling into them. He ought to\r\nhave an action of trespass against them; and, but for the law, he would\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nTo make it quite certain, that no man of science should analyse,\r\nsynthesise, generalise, or in any way scientise me, I was now provided\r\nwith a guardian, intrepid of neologisms ten yards long. The father of\r\nour Bill Chumps, Mr. Chumps, the Purveyor of Meat, was the owner of a\r\ndog, who was the father of a pup, who was threatening, every day, to\r\nmake mincemeat of the author of his existence. The old dog might have\r\ntackled him, Bill told me, or at any rate could have shown a good\r\nturn-up, but for having broken his best fighting-tooth, on the spiked\r\ncollar of the last mastiff he had slain. Through this disability on the\r\npart of old _Fangs_, he found his son _Grip_ too many for him; yet could\r\nnot be brought to confess it, and abstain from a battle, at every\r\nopportunity. These encounters in no wise disturbed Mr. Chumps, but\r\nbecame inconvenient to Mrs. Chumps, when she heard the piano (which had\r\ncost £10, for her daughter, Belinda, to learn her scales) upset, and\r\nentirely demolished. If it had been possible to hang _Grip_, hanged he\r\nwould have been that very day; for the mistress had nursed _Fangs_\r\nthrough his distemper, and never would listen to a word against him.\r\nWhereas the whole fault was upon the side of _Fangs_; of which I am\r\nquite certain, from the character of _Grip_, as it unfolded itself\r\nbefore me, when he became my own dear dog.\r\n\r\nProvidentially, their attempt to hang him had proved a miserable\r\nfailure. Not that he resisted--he was too docile, and kind, and\r\nintelligent, to do that--but because his neck was much too thick, and\r\nmanifold, and his wind too good, for any rope to be of much account to\r\nhim. And before they could try any other form of murder, his master came\r\nhome, and made short work with them, knowing the superiority of the dog.\r\nNow, that same evening, the day being Monday, the very choice club, to\r\nwhich he, and my father, and Mr. John Windsor belonged, as well as the\r\nlargest potato-man at King's Cross, and the owner of the Indigo-blue\r\nconcern, and the most eminent merchant in the cat's meat line, and\r\nseveral other gentlemen of equal distinction, held their bi-daily\r\ncongress at \"_The Best End of the Scrag_,\" at the corner.\r\n\r\nThat night there was a very fine attendance; and my father, who had long\r\nbeen acknowledged to be the wittiest man on our side of the\r\nroad--perhaps because he got no chance at home, to say what came inside\r\nhim--upon this occasion was compelled, by the nature of some of the\r\nsmells he had gone through, to be at his best, as he generally was,\r\nafter not less than two glasses and a half. And he told the adventure,\r\nof the four professors, not as a sad and deplorable thing, but rather as\r\nmatter for merriment. In such a light did he put it, that all the\r\ngentlemen laughed heartily, most of all Mr. John Windsor, who knew, even\r\nbetter than my father did, the variety of organic substance, active in\r\nthat pit just then.\r\n\r\n\"There's things there,\" he said, \"to my living knowledge, that'll never\r\ncome out of their hair while they live. And those big Savage-Johns\r\nalways have long hair, and as fuzzy as a cat stroked upward. Why, the\r\nvery last Friday, when I was a-cooling, a pair of them comes with a\r\nbrazen machine, and asked me, as quiet as a statue, permission for to\r\ntaste my follet oils. I up with the wooden spoon, and offered them a\r\ndrop; but that was not their meaning. It was som'at about som'at we\r\ngives off, according to them philanderers. And I says--'Government\r\ninquiry, gents?' And they says--'No, sir; but for purposes of science.'\r\n'Tell me,' says I, 'what the constitootion is of this here clot,' and\r\nthey said 'Composite organic' something; while my composites all was\r\nupon the upper floor, and never a hurdy-gurdy allowed inside. 'So much\r\nfor science!' says I; 'Jim, show these gentlemen out, by the back-alley\r\ndoor.' And now that you come to discourse of it, Bubbly, it strikes me\r\nthey might have come very likely, smelling up a side-wind for your poor\r\nTommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope they have had enough of that,\" said father; \"if they come\r\nany more, I'll boil them down, and make 'Science-sauce for the million,'\r\nHow would you like, John, to pay your money, and get no change out of\r\nit, along of such a lot?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the missus,\" Mr. Windsor asked--\"won't allow Thistledown, as\r\nmy Jack calls him, to go to old Rum's any more, I suppose? Afraid of the\r\nladies, Mr. Upmore is.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what to do,\" Mr. Chumps broke in; \"Upmore, you buy my\r\nyoung dog _Grip_. I'd give him to you with all my heart, if it wasn't\r\nfor the bad luck of it; though he is worth ten guineas of anybody's\r\nmoney, for he comes of the best blood in England. Downright House of\r\nLords bull-dog he is; same as should be chained to the pillars of the\r\nState, to keep them Glads, and Rads, away. Just you put him in charge\r\nof Thistledown--or whatever you call that little yellow-haired chap, and\r\nI'll back _Grip_ against all the Science, that ever made a pint contain\r\na pot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the figure?\" my father asked, knowing how generously all men\r\ntalk, and that Mr. Chumps' bull-dogs were a fashionable race.\r\n\r\n\"If you was to offer me more than a crown,\" replied Mr. Chumps, with his\r\nfist on the table; \"I should say, 'Bubbly, he's no dog of yours, because\r\nyou desire to insult me.' But put you down a crown, as between old\r\nfriends, and before this honourable company, I say, 'Bucephalus Upmore,\r\n_Grip_ is your dog.' Why so? John Windsor here knows why, and so does\r\nHarry Peelings from King's Cross, and so does Bill Blewitt, and Sandy\r\nMewliver, and all this honourable company. And so do you, Bubbly Upmore,\r\nif you are the man I have taken you for. Gentlemen, it is because Mr.\r\nUpmore has told the best story I have sat and listened to, ever since\r\nlast election day; he digged a pit for his enemies in the gate, and they\r\nfell into it themselves; as well as because my son, Bill Chumps, who\r\nwill make his mark, mind you, if you live to see it, has taken a liking\r\nto this gentleman's son--Thistledown, or Bubble-blow, or\r\nUp-goes-the-donkey--they've got at least fifty names for him--and, in my\r\nhumble opinion, he must be protected from the outrages of all those\r\nfellows, philo-this, and anti-that,--my son Bill knows their names, and\r\nall about them--who have made the world a deal too clever for a quiet\r\nman's comfort.\"\r\n\r\nThese very simple and sensible words were received with much knocking on\r\nthe table; and my father put down his five-shilling piece, so that all\r\nthe other gentlemen had time to see it, before they began talking, as\r\nthe subject compelled them to do, of the merits of their children,\r\nrespectively, severally, and all together. And they parted, in thorough\r\ngood will, inasmuch as not anybody listened to anybody else.\r\n\r\nMy father's opinion, at the time, had been that the warmth of Mr.\r\nChumps' political and social feelings (promoted by the comforts of the\r\nclub) had hurried him into a disregard of money, which his friends\r\nshould never lose a moment to improve. But when the journeyman came over\r\nin the morning, on his way to the _Partheneion_, with _Grip_ trotting\r\nchained at the tail of the cart, my father cried--\r\n\r\n\"What! Has Chumps no more conscience, than to impose upon a friend like\r\nthis? I, who have known him all these years, to pay as good a\r\ncrown-piece as was ever coined, for a one-eyed, nick-eared, hare-lipped,\r\nbroken-tailed son of a [female dog] like that! Gristles, you go back,\r\nand tell your master, that you saw me put an ounce of lead through him.\"\r\n\r\nMy father strode in, to fetch his gun, which he kept well-charged in the\r\nclock-case now, for the sake of so many Professors; and _Grip_, for a\r\nsurety, would have been dead, and boiling, in less than five minutes,\r\nexcept for his luck. His luck was that I, being under debate between my\r\ntwo parents, had slipped out of doors, being old enough now by\r\nexperience to know, that they took the kindest view of me, when I was\r\nout of sight. And coming round the corner, to peep in at the window,\r\njust to see whether they had settled my concerns, there I saw this poor\r\ndog--hideous they might call him--doubtfully glancing in every\r\ndirection, dimly aware that the world was against him, scenting the\r\ndeath of a dog in the air. One of his eyes was out of sight, and one of\r\nhis ears was in need of a sling, his tail (which had lately been cracked\r\nby his father) hung limp in the dust with a pitiable wag, and every hair\r\non his body was turned the wrong way. His self-respect had suffered a\r\ntremendous blow, by the effort of mankind to hang him yesterday, and by\r\ndragging at the tail of a cart to-day; and as sure as dogs are dogs, he\r\nwas aware of the awful decision against him.\r\n\r\nGristles was a hard man, and would not say a word, to comfort or to\r\nplead for him, having got a little snap from him, a month or two ago; so\r\nhe looked down over the back of the cart, and whistled--\"Pop goes the\r\nWeasel\"--while the poor dog implored him, with all his one eye full of\r\nwistful enquiry, what harm he had done.\r\n\r\n\"All right, guv'nor,\" shouted Gristles, as my father came forthwith his\r\nbig double-barrel; \"my mare will stand fire like a church. But mind you,\r\nit ain't no good to shoot at his head, with nothing no smaller than a\r\ndockyard cannon. Have at his heart, where you sees him now a-panting;\r\nbut for God's sake, guv'nor, don't shoot me.\"\r\n\r\nThat fellow's cowardly cruelty made my father relent, for his heart was\r\nkind; and before he could put up his gun again, I was lying upon _Grip_,\r\nand hugging him. The unfortunate dog, for his last resource, had\r\nappealed to the only weak face he could find, and my own fright enabled\r\nme to enter into his.\r\n\r\n\"You little fool, Tommy, get out of the way,\" my father shouted; but I\r\nwould not budge, and _Grip_ put his quivering tongue out, and licked my\r\ncheek, and besought me with a little speech of whine.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said my father, being glad of an excuse for a milder\r\ncourse, as his wrath went down, and knowing that, if he did this thing,\r\nMr. Chumps would never look at him again, which would cost him as much\r\nas £20 a year; \"very well, Tommy, if you like the brute you shall have\r\nhim, and I hope he will be grateful to you. Gristles, here's\r\nhalf-a-crown for you, and you need not tell your master what I\r\nsaid--only that I seemed a little disappointed with the first appearance\r\nof the dog; which is rather a good fault, you know, in a dog who has got\r\nto keep off strangers; and my compliments, and I begin to feel sure that\r\n_Grip_ will soon begin to grow upon us.\"\r\n\r\nThis prophecy was fulfilled right well, so far as my mother and self\r\nwere concerned, and even my father grew fond of _Grip_, as soon as he\r\nfound what a wonder he was; but the dog, while regarding him with deep\r\nrespect, could never forgive his own narrow escape, any more than forget\r\nmy timely aid; for his memory was as tenacious as his teeth. On me the\r\ndog fastened his strong heart at once, with an attachment more than\r\ndogged, making the best of whatever I did, expecting no credit for his\r\nown good works, humbly and heartily wagging his tail, for the mere hope\r\nof a kind word, or look.\r\n\r\nAnd, after a little while, no one who knew him--at least if he were any\r\njudge of a dog--could consider him ugly, from a proper point of view,\r\nand without any personal feeling. For his eye, that had seemed to be\r\ngone, came back, so as nearly to agree with the other one, yet working\r\nenough, on its own account, to redouble his power of expression; while\r\nhis tail (being oiled and done up with bell-wire) returned to its\r\nnatural tendency; and as for his ear of a gingery yellow, the colour was\r\nso rich that it wanted shading, and gained it by having a division\r\nintroduced. So that, on the whole, he had succeeded, without any serious\r\ndamage to himself, in impressing the main principle of the present\r\nage--that of parental submission to the child.\r\n\r\nNow, when I appeared at the _Partheneion_, under convoy of this gallant\r\nanimal, Dr. Rumbelow scarcely knew what to do. After looking at _Grip_,\r\nwith some surprise, he fired a strong volley of quotations at him; but\r\nthe dog moved never a tail-point for them, and instead of being\r\nfrightened, he would not even blink, but gazed at them calmly; as much\r\nas to say, \"There is not a pinch of shot in the whole of them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor, though one of the bravest of mankind, could not return his\r\ngaze, with equal largeness and frank placidity of criticism, but shouted\r\nfor Mercury, his page, and bade him remember the glorious day whereon he\r\nslew the monster Argus. Bob Jackson, failing to recall that date, looked\r\nas if he would rather keep aloof from _Grip_, who opened his nostrils,\r\nand curled up his lips, and shot fire out of his discordant eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Good doggie, good doggie,--poor fellow\"--said the page, in a tenderly\r\ncondescending tone, while approaching sideways gingerly; \"if he is a\r\nvery good doggie, he shall have this beautiful collar to wear,--oh lor!\"\r\n\r\nHe was lying on his back, with _Grip_ standing across him, but scarcely\r\nthinking it worth while to bite him, unless he should endeavour to make\r\nescape. \"Fetch me the big cane, labelled No. 1,\" the Doctor shouted\r\nvaliantly, \"the father of all canes, the _rhopalos_, which has warmed\r\nthe back of a prime-minister. With that will I rescue my Hermes, though\r\nthe Hydra herself stand over him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; no, sir; for God's sake don't go near him,\" cried Bill Chumps,\r\nrunning up the playground; \"_Grip_ can beat any two men in the world,\r\nbecause no blow can hurt him. Leave him to me, sir; I understand him,\r\nand he knows me well enough, though he never took to me, somehow or\r\nother, as his dear old father does. He has taken wonderfully to Fly\r\nTommy. Somebody come, and give Tommy a good whack.\"\r\n\r\nOf the many brave boys, who had rejoiced in doing this, even without\r\ninstigation last week, there was not one who would now discharge this\r\nduty, for the public weal. \"Why should I hit him?\" said boy after boy,\r\nwho said last week, \"Why shouldn't I?\"--\"I am a deal too fond of poor\r\nTommy for that. Hit him yourself, if you want him hit.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I will, then, you pack of dirty cowards,\" answered Chumps, being put\r\nupon his mettle, though he told me afterwards that he was in a horrid\r\nfunk; and he gave me at once a good sounding smack, on a part of my body\r\nthat was covered with material warranted to wear, and having three stout\r\nseams with a piece to let out. Before the echo of the Five's court\r\nceased, _Grip_ was between us, looking up at me, as if to ask, \"What am\r\nI to do?\" doubting in his mind whether justice would allow him to wage\r\nwar against his late master's son.\r\n\r\n\"Worthy is he to be piled with praise--not _cumulari_, but _qui\r\ncumuletur_, boys of the second form observe--inasmuch as he has not\r\ndoubted to encounter, singly, or in maniple, all the foes of the pusill\r\ncommitted to his charge. Great is the manhood of this dog; and yet it\r\nsomewhat repenteth me that, provoked by the wanton assaults of science\r\nupon the sweet retirement of the Muses, I have promised him the tub, and\r\nthe collar, and the bowl, of the deceased, and perhaps now constellated\r\nanimal, Heracles Poikilostiktos. Mercury, brush thy pulverulent\r\n_petasus_, and with the aid of thy lyre, or that of the ever\r\nready-minded Chumps, conduct this formidable animal to the many-strewn\r\ncouch prepared for him. _Partheneionidæ_, the hour has struck. With\r\ngrateful ardour, let us hasten to the banquet of the mind provided for\r\nus, by the generous wisdom of the men of old.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, our great master strode to the school-room door; and\r\nwe (his children and the fruit of his cane) looked vainly for chance of\r\nescape from work. Then, with as much of a sigh as childhood yet has\r\nlearned from nature's book, we followed the learned steps afar, with two\r\nfor one in length, but only one for two in speed, I ween.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTRUE SCIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some years now, I had a quiet time, increasing in knowledge very\r\ngradually, but as fast as my teachers thought needful. For the only true\r\nway to get on in learning, is not to be in too much of a hurry, counting\r\nevery step, and losing breath, and panting into violence of\r\nperspiration; but rather to take, as the will of the Lord, whatever gets\r\ncarried into us, allowing it to settle, and breed inside, with the help\r\nof imagination. Under the steadfast care of _Grip_, and furtherance of\r\nDr. Rumbelow, I advanced pretty fairly in fine acquirements, which have\r\nproved, once or twice, to be serviceable.\r\n\r\nTo me, and to all the school, and indeed a considerable number of the\r\nhouses around, it was a sad and bitter day, when William Chumps,\r\nEsquire--for that was his proper style now, under stamp (as he showed\r\nus) of several letters--was at last compelled to say farewell to the\r\n_Partheneion_, and the whole of us. He had been elected to a\r\nscholarship, founded for that purpose by his father at the\r\n_Partheneion_, to the amount of five shillings a week for three years,\r\nas a tribute to humane letters, and the many good contracts for meat Mr.\r\nChumps had performed. And Bill was to take it to Oxford, and perhaps\r\nwhen the \"Chumps Scholarship\" became talked about, obtain some good\r\norders to supply his college; for a great deal of meat is consumed in\r\nHall.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" said Bill, the very day he was to leave, when he saw me crying\r\nabout his departure, for he always had been so good to me, \"keep up your\r\nspirits, young fellow, and don't blub. The fault of your nature is,\r\nbeing so soft. Now, why am I going to the grandest old place, and the\r\nfinest young fellows, on the face of the earth? Simply because I have\r\ngot so much pluck. I am not such a wonderfully clever cove, though\r\neverybody seems to think so; and I have plenty to learn yet, I can\r\nassure you. And of course I know well enough, that I am going among big\r\nswells, who have a right to be swells, not snobs from the Poultry, and\r\nMincing Lane, such as used to try to snub me here. But do you think I\r\nhave a particle of funk? Feel the muscle in my arm, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bill,\" I replied, \"you could knock them all down; but when you had done\r\nit, there would be fifty more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, my boy, I will not hurt one of them, unless he endeavours to\r\ncock over me. If it comes to any fighting, at my time of life, it must\r\nbe done with pistols. But my mind is made up, not to meddle with any\r\nman, unless he insults me, and then let him look out. They will very\r\nsoon discover that I mean to be a gentleman, although my father may be\r\ncalled a butcher; and when they see that, if they are gentlemen\r\nthemselves, they will be very glad to show me the way. The great defect\r\nof your character, Tommy, is that you have not got go enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think I have heard enough of that,\" I said; \"just because I\r\ndon't want to fly, to please you chaps that cock over me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are putting the cart before the horse,\" replied Chumps, having\r\ntaken already six lessons in logic, from a man who came on purpose; \"you\r\nhave an extraordinary gift of flying, which would make your fortune,\r\nTommy, and enable your father to leave off poisoning the public, if only\r\nyou would cultivate it. I can do very good Latin Elegiacs, and tidy\r\nGreek Iambics, and run a mile in four minutes and three-quarters; but\r\nhow many years might I hammer at all that, and scarcely turn a sixpence?\r\nBut you--you have only to put on your wings, and astonish all the North\r\nof London. If I had only got your turn for flying, with my own for the\r\nclassics, and for going to the top, I tell you what it is, Tommy\r\nUpmore--in ten years I'd be the Prime Minister of England.\"\r\n\r\nMy own opinion was, that without any flying, Bill would arrive at the\r\ntop of the tree, in about five years, which was a long time yet for any\r\none to look forward to; and thinking so much of him now, and grieving so\r\ndeeply for the loss of him, I allowed his words to sink into my mind, as\r\nthey never had done before. Hitherto I had been inclined to think, if\r\never I thought about it, that my want of proper adhesion to the ground\r\nwas a plague to me, and no benefit. My father treated it as a thing to\r\nlaugh at, and to disbelieve in; my mother was afraid that I never might\r\ncome down, within her reach, and the same as I went up; while the rest\r\nof the world was content to take it entirely from a selfish point of\r\nview, as a question of science, or of low curiosity.\r\n\r\nBut before we could say any more about that, \"old Rum,\" as we called\r\nhim, came into the hall, where Chumps was waiting with his boxes, for\r\nhis father's meat-van to fetch them. The doctor had already said\r\nfarewell to Bill, before all the school, and as a public essay; but now\r\nhe came to say good-bye, and to give him a few kind words, with a\r\nfriendly heart. Bill was as tall as his master now, being an exceedingly\r\nstrapping fellow, and thoroughly thriven on the marrow of the ox; but\r\nwhen the Doctor took his hand, and spoke to him in a low, soft voice,\r\nwithout any Latin turn in it, the cup of Bill's feelings began to run\r\nover, and I ran away, not to look at it.\r\n\r\nHere in a passage, as facts would have it, with my eyes full of tears\r\nand shadow, I ran into the arms, or legs, of a strong, hard man. Hard in\r\nthe matter of bones, I mean, and the absence of any fat about him, but\r\nas soft and tender in heart, and vein, as anything he had ever\r\ndissected.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tommy! It is indeed our Tommy!\" exclaimed Professor Megalow.\r\n\"Prolepsis of our race, what trouble is upon you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir,\" cried I, \"if you could only stop Bill Chumps from going away\r\nfrom us! The place will be nothing, after he is gone, and nobody will\r\nwant to stop here. Whatever you order is sure to be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Professor, as he lifted me up, and looked at me kindly\r\nwith his large, calm eyes, \"I have come a long way to make that\r\ndiscovery; and I wish it were so in Great Russell Street.\"\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of his labours, and forgetting a far more important\r\nmatter in our eyes--the two half-holidays procured for us, when he\r\nthought that we seemed to require them. For now his vast knowledge, and\r\naccuracy, simplicity, gentleness, and playful humour, had won the warm\r\nfriendship of our Dr. Rumbelow, who seldom caned any of us now, except\r\nfor lying. For my part, I loved this kind gentleman, and grieved that he\r\nhad not once asked me to fly for him.\r\n\r\n\"My friend, you are often in my thoughts,\" he said, as if he knew all\r\nthat was passing in my mind; \"let us sit down a while in this quiet\r\ncorner, and consider a highly scientific case, which happens to be in my\r\npocket.\"\r\n\r\nSmiling at the fright his words had caused, he drew forth a pretty\r\nlittle globular box, yellow, pellucid, and inlaid with stars of gold;\r\nand this he held so that the light of the sun glanced through it,\r\nilluminating things inside, that danced with colour, purple, and orange,\r\nand rosy red. I pulled out my handkerchief, and dried my eyes, and\r\npushed back my curls, for a hearty good stare.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, your mind is of a wholesome type,\" said the great Professor\r\npleasantly; \"brief should be the pangs of youthful woe. And they are all\r\ngood to eat, Tommy; and as you suck them, you can pull them out of your\r\nmouth, and see the sun shine through, and then put them back, and find\r\nthem ever so much sweeter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I can't get at them, sir! What good can they be, if I can't get\r\nat them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your reasoning is wonderfully sound and good, from its own point of\r\nview,\" he answered. \"But get at them, Tommy, and they shall be yours;\r\nyou shall have box and all, if you open it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was very hard upon me; for I had no more chance of opening it, than\r\nof flying in the air, as people say, and indeed, according to my gifts,\r\nmuch less. In vain I pulled, and squeezed, and pressed, examined every\r\npart of it, and then worked away again, screwing up my lips, and eyes,\r\nso sternly that the Professor could not help laughing. And the worst of\r\nit was, that the more I laboured, the greater the temptation of the\r\ninside grew, everything dancing with a play of colours glorious to see,\r\nand feel that all was good to eat.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, I can't, I can't get at them; do please to show me the way,\r\nsir,\" I cried; for truly it was enough to make me cry.\r\n\r\n\"My boy,\" said the Professor, looking gravely at me, and seeming to wink\r\nwith one large clear eye, though it was not a wink, but rather the\r\neffect of a most sagacious and delightful nod; \"I have long anticipated\r\nthat result. It is always agreeable to find one's prognosis confirmed by\r\nevents, though they often fail to do it. No one has found out the secret\r\nof this box, though very clever men have striven at it, and among them\r\nthree noted puzzle-makers. Perfect simplicity is deeper than any depth\r\nof complexity. Tommy, behold, and with good will devour. Ha, a\r\npractical, rather than a theoretic mind!\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps he made that observation because, without stopping to ask how\r\nthe box came open, I fell to at once upon its choice contents. The\r\nflavour was altogether new to me, and wonderfully fine and penetrating,\r\nleaving no part of the mouth in idleness, and warming the entire length\r\nof throat with hope. At the same time, these goodies had just enough\r\nabout them of roughness, to compel the tongue to stop, and invite it to\r\ndwell upon their surface gently, equably, earnestly, and with much\r\ndelight refraining from speech, while thus better employed.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said the Professor, and one \"ah\" of his contained all the fulness\r\nof three volumes; \"Tommy, be just, and consider them fairly. They are\r\nmade from my own design, and stamped with cuneiform--ah, I see it now!\r\nThe young mind is plagued so with ancient tongues, that the young tongue\r\nrejoices in demolishing their symbols. By taking a patent for this\r\ndesign, I might get on better than by building dragons. But let us\r\nreturn to our point, my good Tommy.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he was setting against one another the tips of his long\r\nmiddle fingers, which I took for the point to be returned to, and said,\r\n\"Yes, sir, if you please, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"My young friend, I take it that the point, from which we have allowed\r\nour minds to be pleasantly diverted, is whether you will allow me just\r\nto give you a lift in the air--a very gentle lift; not for any\r\nscientific view whatever, but only for a little satisfaction to myself.\r\nIf from old experience of professors, you have any misgiving, say so,\r\nTommy, and I will not touch you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir,\" said I, with my mouth running over; \"don't be afraid, sir, to\r\nlift me where you like.\"\r\n\r\nAt this good encouragement. Professor Megalow nodded, as if in pleasant\r\ncommune with himself; and then with one hand softly tossed me to his\r\nshoulder, where I sate very nicely, as on a spring-cushion, rather than\r\na feather-bed, however. Then he handed me up the box, which I put\r\nbetween my knees, and began to sing, according to my habit, when\r\ncontented with the world.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the Professor, as he walked about (having, now and then, a\r\nlittle whistle to himself), and took me to look at a map of mountains\r\n(placed at a mountainous height above my usual level of intelligence),\r\n\"Tommy, this is very good; this is quite delightful. Do you know, why\r\nthis is so delightful, little Tommy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" I replied, for I was very clever then; \"it is jolly, because\r\nthey are so capital to suck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not only that, Tommy; although I am perfectly open to conviction upon\r\nthat point\"--here he opened his mouth, and I popped a goody in, as if he\r\nwere the boy, and I the celebrated man--\"but also because, my most\r\ngenerous young friend, it confirms my opinion, or, in finer words, my\r\ntheory. Most of us, as we get older and older, grow more and more\r\ninterested in ourselves. Possibly you are too young, small Tommy, to\r\nhave any desire as yet to hear an empirical, rather than a scientific\r\nopinion, about your peculiar, but not altogether unparalleled, case.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, to say anything you like. And I won't be afraid,\r\nand I won't tell my mother, unless you are sure that you would not be\r\nafraid. And if you talk as plainly as you did just now, I will try to\r\nmake out what the meaning is.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Megalow put me down, with a gentle clap on my back, as if he\r\nhad found me one too much for him. And then, with a jerk of his\r\nprominent chin, and a rub of his nose, he considered me.\r\n\r\nAnd while he was doing all this, such a smile of large good-will\r\nillumined us, that I would have been glad to be dissected, if it would\r\nplease him, and not hurt much.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that saddened me was this--he did not appear to be at all\r\nastonished, by anything discovered in me. And I now called to mind, that\r\nhe never had shown any special excitement about my case, as all the\r\nother scientific men had done. And my mother had said that he could not\r\nbe half so clever as his reputation was, because of his letting me alone\r\nso. Though perhaps he was paid by the year for his work, and the others\r\nby the job; which would account for everything. That may have been so,\r\nand I thought about it now, and concluded (from brief observation of his\r\nhat) that he only got his money at the end of the year.\r\n\r\n\"The difference,\" said the Professor calmly, with a glance of affection\r\nat his large-skulled hat, which was rolling on the floor without taking\r\nany harm, \"according to my very humble opinion, is not so much of kind\r\nas of degree, my Tommy. It has long been well known that the various\r\nfamilies of the human race--as we may venture still to call it--differ\r\nvery greatly in specific gravity; the Celt, for instance, is especially\r\nheavy in proportion to his size, and the Jute the opposite. There was, I\r\nbelieve, an exceptionally light and buoyant race in North America,\r\naboriginal so far as we know; and the lightest member of that race,\r\nTommy, would probably have despised your highest flight. At the same\r\ntime, and although I have met with a case of almost equal levity--the\r\nexample being, I regret to say, feminine--you must not imagine that I am\r\nendeavouring to disparage your exploits, my dear Tommy. Don't cry, my\r\ndear child; I had no idea that you were so sensitive upon this matter.\r\nYour admirable master has always told me, that your main desire is to\r\nstop upon the ground, and that both your parents wish it. You nod your\r\nhead, as if I understood your feelings. Then why are your blue eyes full\r\nof tears?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, I wasn't at all longing to go up. Only I didn't\r\nknow anybody else had done it. And I shan't care to go up any more,\r\nafter that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" cried the Professor, with his great rich smile; \"human nature\r\nhas no exceptions half so wonderful as its laws are. My good little\r\nfriend, allow me to comfort you, and to restore your self-respect. It is\r\nnot by any means a common thing for members of the English race to\r\nfly--excuse me for using the popular, but incorrect word, to describe\r\nyour exploits. But there is a power that beats you, Tommy, in your own\r\nprovince, and that is Time. At three o'clock I have a lecture to deliver\r\nupon your antitype, the apteryx, a bird that has abdicated the rights,\r\nwhich some of us desire to usurp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, do let me come and hear it, if old Rum will let me go. Bill\r\nChumps has heard you lecture, and he says----\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank him heartily for his approval;\" replied the Professor, at the\r\nsame time showing me his watch, which ticked with a bullet upon cat-gut;\r\n\"William Chumps is a fine young man, with a great spirit in a strong\r\nbody; and I would ask your kind master to let you come, if I thought the\r\nsubject good for you. But, my dear little fellow, I am sure that it is\r\nnot so. The less your mind runs upon the regions of the air, and the\r\nmore you endeavour to bring your body, by good feeding, exercise,\r\npleasant sports, and moderate labours, to the normal specific gravity,\r\nthe better it will be for yourself, and your parents, whose only child\r\nyou are. And I venture to differ from my learned brethren, Professors\r\nBrachipod, and Jargoon, Chocolous, and Mullicles, in thinking that it\r\nwill be no worse for the interests of science. Good-bye, Tommy; you may\r\nkeep the box, as a souvenir of this long interview; be sure that you eat\r\nall you can of good meat, solid bread, and glutinous material; and don't\r\nswallow too much Latin and Greek, which tend to undue elation. If you\r\nwere a lazy boy, I should not tell you this; but I hear that you are an\r\nambitious boy, and eager to learn everything. I shall observe you, my\r\ninteresting friend, and from time to time hint to your learned master\r\nany trifle that escapes the unmedical mind.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted me up, and kissed my forehead; and as I picked up his hat--a\r\ntrifle which had escaped his universal mind--and by jumping on a chair\r\nclapped it on his mighty head, I could not help paying him the usual\r\ntribute paid at his departure--glistening eyes, that is to say, and a\r\nsmile of loving wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT WASHED.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father, Bucephalus Upmore, had been, at the time of my birth, a\r\nRadical, and owed his conversion from loose ideas to no amount of\r\nargument, or even of wider observation, but to a little accident. Upon\r\nhis return, one winter night, from a meeting in St. Pancras, not only of\r\na liberal, but a wildly generous character, somebody tripped him up, and\r\nstole his watch, and purse, and Sunday hat. A small man might have\r\naccepted this as a lesson against subversive views, and a smaller one as\r\na confirmation of them; but my father was not of that sort. His practice\r\nwas, to take his stand upon what he considered right, and allow no\r\nevidence to move him one hair's breadth from the true conclusions poured\r\ninto him. And he never read anything, that did not cap and sawder down\r\nhis own contents.\r\n\r\nThis had made his life thus far most happy, enabling him to despise all\r\npeople who differed in any way from him, as well as to enlarge himself,\r\nwithout any compulsion to pay for it. And he might have gone on in this\r\neasy way, calling upon the people behind him to rob the people in front\r\nof him, if he had not undergone the bad luck to be robbed himself. When\r\nhe came to speak of this, among his friends, not one of them failed to\r\nexpress deep sorrow, and to assure him that such things must happen,\r\nwhenever the Conservatives were in office. At the same time they\r\nintimated gently, that when he made so much money out of working men, it\r\nserved him right to lose some of it.\r\n\r\nHis feelings were hurt by this sometimes; especially when the suggestion\r\ncame from gentlemen, who had attained that degree, by adulterating the\r\nvictuals of the working man. However, he smothered his common sense, as\r\nthe first duty is of Liberals; till his body and mind came thump upon a\r\nstumbling-block, and no mistake.\r\n\r\nArising in a vast hall of Reform, to second a motion that all men are\r\nequal, and must have the same money for their work (whether they do it,\r\nor leave it undone), and must not do more than six hours in a day--for\r\nfear of imparting infection to the rest--with his mouth full of reason,\r\nand his heart full of hope [that none of his men might be there to hear\r\nhim], my dear father gave a stamp, and found it fall upon something soft\r\nand dull. He felt himself more at home through this, having so much soft\r\nstuff round his vats, and his eloquence mounted to full swell, till he\r\nwanted to jump to give emphasis. This he attempted to do with a clap of\r\nhis hands, to complete a grand sentence, when up came something between\r\nhis legs, and got stuck on the top of his highlows. With laudable\r\nagility, my father stooped, while the audience cheered lustily,\r\nsupposing him to be in quest of some word big enough to express his\r\nsentiments.\r\n\r\nThese, however, demanded outlet, in a very short one, when he found in\r\nhis hand his own lost hat, with a hole in the brim from the stamp of his\r\nheel, and the crown chock-full of heads for speech, and demolitionist\r\nstatistics. He examined his hat, and descried B. U. just in under the\r\ntuck of the lining, where a Liberal always puts his mark, on the\r\nVote-by-ballot principle.\r\n\r\nThis alone was enough to shake his confidence in his party; though all\r\nthe gentlemen around him looked quite incapable of doing anything. And\r\nhe might, as he said to my mother, have believed that his old hat had\r\ncome down from heaven, if only his new hat, bought last Friday, had been\r\nleft for him to go home with. That, however, was not the case; his new\r\nhat managed to leave that great assembly upon the head of some eminent\r\nLiberal; and my father went home with his old hat on, greasy, and dirty,\r\nand showing signs of conflict, but containing a head that would be\r\nRadical no more.\r\n\r\nNow, I need not have told that little story--which repeats itself among\r\nsuch people, more often than it is repeated--except to explain what it\r\nwas that took us, in the summer holidays, to a place called\r\n\"Happystowe-on-Sea.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears that my father was by no means satisfied so to lose his\r\nhats--though in truth it was no great grievance, thus to save the\r\ncontents at the cost of the case--and like a thorough Briton, as he\r\nalways was, he determined not to get the worst of it. Several\r\nopportunities for reprisal had been allowed to escape him; when, soon\r\nafter Bill Chumps went to Oxford, there came among us, and excited our\r\nprinciples, a contested election for Marylebone. By means of their\r\nnoble organization, the Liberals knew, from the outset, that the battle\r\nof freedom was sure to be won; or, as our people put it, rank bribery\r\nand corruption, truckling and swilling would defeat the right.\r\nNevertheless, a just hope was entertained, on both sides, of a very\r\nlively contest, and a fair occasion (without legal intervention) for\r\nsounding the capacity of an adversary's head. My father was flying a big\r\nblue flag, which we could see from the _Partheneion_, with \"Church and\r\nState for ever\" on it; and Mr. John Windsor, and Chumps Esquire--as we\r\ncalled the great butcher in respect of his son--and \"_The Best End of\r\nthe Scrag_,\" all had the same; and only a man who knocked horses on the\r\nhead durst hang out the red rag, up our Lane.\r\n\r\nI speak of this, only as a circumstance to prove that our neighbourhood\r\nwas Constitutional, and that the Radical element, however respectable it\r\nmight have been when kept at home, had no right whatever to come\r\ninvading us, and desiring to trample on our principles. They knew that\r\nfor nearly three hundred and fifty yards, the inhabitants were all\r\ntrue-Blue, beginning with the Indigo factory on the South, and going all\r\nthrough the ash-heaps, and ending with my father. But in the wantonness\r\nof triumph, when their majority was posted up 2,000 [though our side\r\nclaimed 1,500 in front] these \"Demi-Cats\"--as Bill had sent us word from\r\nOxford to entitle them, and so we did--must needs assemble at King's\r\nCross, in their thousands, and resolve to storm every Blue house in\r\nMaiden Lane.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of their enterprise was most glorious; nothing could\r\nstand before them. They broke all the glass that had a blue flag near\r\nit, and they knocked down every man who had got blue eyes. The premises\r\nof Mr. Chumps were sacked; his legs of mutton walked off, as if they\r\nwere alive, and his salt beef was stuck on poles, even bigger than the\r\nskewers he weighed it out with; every drop in the cellars of the\r\nConservative Hotel ran uphill inside a big Radical, and Mr. John Windsor\r\nlost soap enough pretty nearly to clean half the Liberals. However, he\r\ncontrived to get over a back wall, together with his wife and daughter\r\nPolly--Jack was luckily at the _Partheneion_, and the other four gone to\r\nsee their Aunt, with old _Fangs_ to protect them from the Liberals--and\r\nby taking an in-and-out way through the cinders, the three arrived\r\nsafely at our back door, without breath enough to blow out one of their\r\nown dips.\r\n\r\nTill now my father had scarcely struck a blow on behalf of the\r\nConstitution, beyond giving his vote, and knocking down a man who was\r\nanxious to do the like to him; but now it did seem a bit too hard that\r\nthe Liberals should extinguish thus all liberty of opinion.\r\n\r\n\"John,\" he said now, as he brought in the fugitives, and heard a\r\ntremendous noise coming up the Lane, \"this is what I call coming it too\r\nstrong. Mrs. Windsor, ma'am, you are all of a tremble. Sophy, get\r\nwhiskey and water, at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bubbly,\" poor Mr. Windsor gasped, \"this is most kind, and cordial of\r\nyou. My dear, you require a stimulant, however much you dislike it. But,\r\nUpmore, down with your flag, at once! Down with your flag, that the\r\nfellows may go by.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, Mr. Upmore,\" implored Mrs. Windsor, a lady of a most superior\r\nkind; \"please not to lose a moment in hauling down your flag; it is\r\nflying in the face of Providence. Do cut the ropes, if it won't untie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will I?\" said my father, and his face took on, as my mother said\r\nafterwards, a very fine expression; \"lower my flag, to the scum of the\r\nearth! Ladies, go down to the cellar, and keep quiet. You will have no\r\none here, while my flag is flying. Mr. Windsor is a man of high spirit,\r\nas he has proved many times, in our debates. He, and I, will go to the\r\nboiling-house, and defend the true-blue, come what will.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother declares that Mr. Windsor was going, at his best pace, to the\r\ncellar-stairs, when she locked him out, and pulled out the key; but\r\nmother was always severe upon him, because of his wholesale ways, and\r\ntalk. At any rate, he did not flag or fly, although he may have longed\r\nto do so perhaps.\r\n\r\n\"Now, John,\" said my father, as he took his arm, to confirm his courage\r\n(which required it), and led him down the red-tiled passage to the\r\nboiling-house; \"you have had a great many good laughs at my little\r\nsteam-engine, haven't you? Very well, we'll try it on the 'Great\r\nunwashed;' if there happens to be a bit of fire left. My men are all\r\naway, the same as yours--or else these fellows would not come to sack\r\nus. I gave them the quarter-day to vote, the same as you did with yours;\r\nand mine are gone the right colour to a man, I do believe. But I\r\nhappened to say, 'leave a little steam on;' and I can get up a great\r\ndeal in ten minutes, and the blackguards won't be here for twenty.\r\nThey've got three blue houses yet to wreck, and my double-gates will\r\nkeep them out, at least five minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, I see, what you mean to do. What a glorious fellow you are,\r\nBubbly! I'll go half the waste of phleg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then go and see that all the bolts are right, while I get up steam, and\r\nhave the double hose ready.\"\r\n\r\nThese two gallant, and sturdy, boilers very soon had the front and back\r\ngates barred and bolted, and strengthened with struts against the\r\nstyles; so that all the men who could get at them must take at least\r\nfive minutes to get through them; and meanwhile the furnace of the\r\nlittle engine was beginning to roar, and the steam to puff.\r\n\r\n\"Capital! I call this first-rate stoking;\" exclaimed my father, as he\r\nstopped to breathe. \"Now you understand the hose, John? It is only\r\nthree-inch pipe, and therefore as handy as a walking-stick. You put your\r\nnozzle upon that trestle, commanding the back doors, while I keep ready\r\nfor the time they have broken the front gate down. We have got a big vat\r\nof hot stuff to draw from; but I don't think they'll want half of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bubbly, I don't seem to understand it,\" said Mr. Windsor, who was\r\nslow-headed, and losing his presence of mind, perhaps (although he had\r\ngot his coat off) from working so hard while he was fat, and with\r\nterrible Liberal screeches already arising in the air, above the rattle\r\nof the gates; \"suppose, my dear friend, that we killed some fellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"No hope of that,\" said my father, being now in a rancorous, and\r\ndetermined frame; \"I am afraid that the temperature won't be above 160°,\r\nif so much; and it cools in passing through the air too fast. It will\r\nonly make their eyes sharp, and their faces clean, as they should be on\r\na holiday. No white feather, John Windsor, now! Ah, they've fetched the\r\nblacksmith, as I knew they would. Think of your wife and children, John,\r\nand of the British Constitution. Things must be come to a very pretty\r\npass, if a man mayn't syringe a born jackass! Especially when the\r\njackass kicks his gate in.\"\r\n\r\n\"In for a penny, then, in for a pound,\" his brother boiler answered,\r\nwith his courage up; \"whatever you order shall be done, friend Bubbly.\r\nThis vat shall run away, before I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go bail for the front gate, Johnny, if you'll be ready for the\r\nrear attack, supposing they've the cheek to try one. This engine works a\r\ndouble hose, you see, on the principle of a well-coil. Now, my fine\r\nfellows, what do you want here?\"\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith, though working against his will--for my father always\r\npaid him ready money--had prized one heavy gate off its hinges, and the\r\nother was swagging to fall with it.\r\n\r\n\"We wants you, guv'nor, and your scurvy flag;\" cried the leader of the\r\nmob, a chimney-sweep.\r\n\r\n\"B'iler, b'iler; we wants the Tory b'iler!\" cried a hundred dirty\r\nfellows, as the gates crashed in.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and you shall have him,\" said my father, who was standing just\r\noutside the slow-house door, with the nozzle of the hose tucked under\r\nhis arm, and a rod in his right hand to put the pressure on; \"if you\r\ncome a yard further, you shall taste the boiler. Only let blacksmith\r\nGrimes get out of the way. I don't wish to boil a respectable neighbour.\r\nAnd I don't want to boil you, unless you insist on it.\"\r\n\r\nNot only Grimes, but a great many others would have liked to get out of\r\nthe way at this; but the bulk of the tumult behind shoved on, and the\r\nheads, that were fain to hang back, got jammed up in front against the\r\nsmash, and then shot over. Father just waited, till the chimney-sweep, a\r\ntermagant of the highest rank, was hurra-ing, and waving a\r\nsoot-brush,--and then he let go hot candles at them. In a long white\r\ncolumn, flew the scalding fluid, spreading, like a sheaf, when it met\r\ntheir faces, and coating every man of them with poisonous gray froth. No\r\nman could swear, for his mouth was bunged up; and no man could strike,\r\nfor his arms were stuck to him, with a weight of deposit, like a\r\nstalactite. Good stearine it was, of the value of at least three\r\nhalfpence a pound, in the unrefined state; and it went inside their\r\nshirts, and stung like hornets, and settled into every cracked place of\r\nthe skin, and made a man tight in his linings. And to add to their\r\ngrief, such a steam arose among them--not to mention something else\r\nbeginning with same letters--that the slits of any eyes, that were left\r\nhalf open, were as useless as in a thick London fog.\r\n\r\n\"There's a deal more to come,\" said my father calmly; \"noble reformers,\r\nstand shoulder to shoulder; as one of your writers has beautifully\r\nsaid--the deeper we go, the more strength we get.\"\r\n\r\nThe issue is told in a ballad written that same night at \"_The Best End\r\nof the Scrag_;\" which,--though inspired by Liberal ale, for \"_The\r\nScrag_\" had not a drop left of its own, and was obliged to send across\r\nthe road for it--is a poem of high merit; and my father was told upon\r\nthe best authority that the poet, from first to last, received nearly\r\nfifteen shillings for it. Our house subscribed for sixpence-worth, and\r\nso did Mr. Windsor; and all the boys of the lower order, up to\r\nGrotto-day, were singing--no matter what their politics might be--and\r\nwrapping their bulls' eyes up in, \"The lay of the soporific\r\nsoap-boilers.\" The Radicals bore this satire well, having had their own\r\nway in everything, and laughed on the right side of their mouths; and\r\neven the men, who had been cased in grease, made a good thing of it,\r\nwhen they scraped themselves, by going to the rag-and-bone-shops. Yet,\r\nas bad luck would have it, the leading mind among them--that of Mr. Joe\r\nCowl, the Master-sweep--was not content, and broke out into a summons at\r\nthe Clerkenwell Police Court. For Mr. Cowl, meeting all the first of the\r\ndischarges, before the stearine was well up in the hose, was a loser\r\ninstead of a receiver of deposit. All the soot on his body was clean\r\nwashed off; and nothing being left to fill the pores, the abnormal\r\nexposure of his system led to a pungent, pervasive, and radical catarrh.\r\nMrs. Cowl sent for a doctor, but her husband Joe had still enough\r\nvitality to kick him out; and then jumping from the frying-pan into the\r\nfire, shouted loudly for a lawyer; and he recommended law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFOR CHANGE OF AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said my father to Mr. John Windsor, who was urging him to leave\r\nhome for a while, that Joe Cowl's anger might blow over; \"people pretend\r\nnot to understand it, John; but you know as well as I do what it is. How\r\ncould I ever live, for a fortnight at a stretch, or even three weeks, as\r\nmight be needful, without a breath of the air of the works, John?\"\r\n\r\n\"When I was obliged to spend a week in Parree,\" replied Mr. Windsor\r\n(who, as Mrs. Windsor said, had \"acclimatised himself uncommon quick to\r\nthe French style, and their accent\"), \"I thought I should have died for\r\na day or two, from the downright emptiness of the air. But, my dear\r\nfellow, I found out some places, where the air was as nourishing, every\r\nbit, as it is at our works on an over-time day. Bubbly, I contrived to\r\nbilk the doctor, by going twice a day to a place with a hole in it, over\r\nsome large cookery vapours. And you must contrive to find a place like\r\nthat. I'll tell you what, go away to the seaside. At the seaside now,\r\nthey are always making smells.\"\r\n\r\n\"So they are, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Windsor, who was come to join in the\r\nattack on father; \"the last time I was at Brighton, my dear, with all\r\nthe poor children, how I envied you, dwelling,--as the poet so\r\ngraphically describes it,--in the sweet fragrancy of home. Mr. Upmore,\r\nthe air is never empty at any fashionable seaside place; and for the\r\nsake of your dear wife, and your wonderfully interesting boy, who is a\r\ndear friend of my clever Johnny's, you cannot, with any consistency\r\nwhatever, refuse to respond to the call of duty; for duty it is, and\r\nshould be looked at in that light, without a second thought of paltry\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has the gift of eloquence,\" declared her husband; \"and sometimes I\r\nalmost wish she hadn't. It comes to her from her mother's side, whose\r\nmother was a celebrated Baptist preacher. And when it is upon her, she\r\nhas no consideration of other people's money, and not so very much of\r\nmine. But you must not take the whole of this for high talk, Bubbly. To\r\nmake yourself scarce just now, will fetch you a pound, for every penny\r\nyou have to spend. An old friend of mine is well up the back-stairs; and\r\nalthough he could never do a stroke for me--for some reason, which he\r\nexplains much better than I can understand it--he whispered to me, last\r\nnight, 'keep in with the gentleman, who boils higher up the Lane than\r\nyou do. His fortune is made, if he keeps quiet, and the present\r\nGovernment remains in office. He will have more jobs than he can do, and\r\nhe must call you in, to help him.' I thought I had better tell you,\r\nBubbly; because we have always been straight-forward; and if you are\r\npulled up in the Police-court, why, you might have to wait months,\r\nbefore you got a contract.\"\r\n\r\nMy father stood up, for nothing could be more illustrative of true\r\nfriendship, more incentive to patriotism, and more ennobling to the\r\nhuman race, than this announcement from his brother boiler. He had\r\npassed through a good deal of emotion lately, having been not only\r\ntoasted largely, wherever he appeared with his purse in his pocket, and\r\nvisited with post-cards more than once (from people whose names were in\r\nthe papers) but even invited to a hot dinner, which he took care to go\r\nto, at the Mansion-House. For that Lord-Mayor was not one of those, who\r\ndesire to have no successor.\r\n\r\n\"John Windsor, we have always been straight-forward. There has never\r\nbeen the shadow of a doubt between us. Our friendship has never known a\r\ncloud upon it;\" I was home for the holidays now, and these words of my\r\nfather's made me stare a little; \"you know what I am, John,--a humble\r\nBriton, who thinks for himself, and sticks to it. Business is business;\r\npolitics come in the evening, to smoke a pipe with. When I was a Rad, I\r\nmay have thought of making something out of it. But I only made a loss\r\nof two good hats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear, hear!\" interrupted Mr. Windsor; \"and now by repulse of the Rads,\r\nyou have gained three hundred hats, the poet says.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff!\" cried my father; \"there were not thirty; and shocking bad hats\r\nall of them. You are welcome to your share, if you will take your half\r\nof this confounded summons, Windsor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, come,\" said Mrs. Windsor, \"if you once begin with\r\npolitics--the point is to settle where to go to, and I think Mrs. Upmore\r\nshould have a voice in that. What coast do you prefer, my dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"My views are of very little moment,\" mother answered quietly, as she\r\ncame in, with a bottle of cherry-brandy in her hand; \"Bucephalus is so\r\nbigoted. But I love to see the sun rise over the sea from the window,\r\nand then go to bed again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your taste, ma'am, is of the very highest order,\" said Mr. Windsor, who\r\nnever could persuade his wife to turn her hand to pickles, and bottled\r\nfruit, and gravies; \"and many a time have I enjoyed the fine results\r\nthat comes of it. To see the sun rise over the sea, and the poor fellows\r\nshaking about in their boats, and then to go to bed again, while they\r\nare catching fish enough for your breakfast, prawns, and lobsters, and a\r\nsole with egg and breadcrumbs, and perhaps (if they are lucky) just a\r\nsalmon-collop--ah, that is what I call seaside! And then, you lounge\r\nabout, and see fine ladies jumping up and down, as the white waves knock\r\nthem; and then you have a pipe, and smell fine smells, and talk to an\r\nold salt, as if you were his captain; and he shows you, through his\r\nspy-glass, how rough it is outside, with the people in the vessels\r\nlooking enviously at you; and by that time, Bubbly, why you want your\r\ndinner; and you eat it, as if you was made for nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't remember much about it,\" answered father, though evidently\r\nstruck by this description; \"why, it must be thirty years since I saw\r\nthe sea. Ah, how we go up and down in life! I dare say I was no bigger\r\nthan that little shrimp there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Upmore!\" exclaimed Mrs. Windsor, whose manner, we were told, was\r\nmore aristocratic than anything on our side of King's Cross; \"Mr.\r\nUpmore, with all your opportunities, is it possible that you have not\r\never felt it your very first duty, to take your dear wife, and your\r\nTommy, to the sea? Whatever should we do, without the sea? A great part\r\nof our commerce comes over it, and my Johnny can very nearly swim! Dear\r\nMrs. Upmore, you should not lose a minute, in taking your darling boy to\r\nthe sea. It seems to be considered so essential now, that all young\r\npersons should be taught to swim.\"\r\n\r\n\"My Tommy can fly, ma'am,\" replied dear mother; \"and what is swimming to\r\ncompare with that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said Mr. Windsor, \"if you want to see the sun rise\r\nover the sea, the best chance for it is on the east coast. I'm very\r\npartial to Brighton myself, not being so exclusive as Mrs. W. about a\r\nlittle smell here, or a sort of odour there. That feeling of the higher\r\norders seems to be cutaneous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spontaneous, you mean, Mr. Windsor, or perhaps contagious, or\r\nindigenous.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean what I say, my dear. And what I say is this--to the best of my\r\nknowledge, the sun don't get up out of the sea, at Brighton, though he\r\ndoes come over it, in fine weather, by the time the upper classes are\r\nlooking about. But I won't pretend to speak positive, because I never\r\ngot up to look for him. Only this I do say, and it stands to reason,--if\r\nyou want to compel him to get up there, you had better go where the sea\r\nruns east.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, I see!\" my father answered; \"I am not sure, that I should\r\nhave thought of that. John, you are a clever fellow, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope that he was;\" cried Mrs. Windsor; \"because you have made\r\nyourself famous, Mr. Upmore, with my husband to stand in front of you,\r\nare you going to begin to look down upon us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be so hot, my dear. I assure you, Bubbly, that she means it for\r\nthe moment; but it goes in two seconds, like a spurt of steam. Now, I\r\nhappen to know a very nice little place, on the east coast, Norfolk or\r\nSuffolk, I believe, for I never can carry all the counties in my head.\r\nHappystowe-on-Sea is the name of it; none of your blessed sewers there.\r\nI know a man who boils there, twice a week; he would let you in as a\r\nvisitor, of course, and you would get the nourishment of his air. Barlow\r\nhis name is, Billy Barlow; a rising man in compos, and cocoa; he has\r\nfound a way to make one out of the other, and both of them out of old\r\nshoes, I believe; and I thought of running down to him, to get a\r\nwrinkle; but Mrs. W. seemed to think there was something _infra dig_ in\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot be too particular, in my humble opinion,\" said Mrs. Windsor,\r\n\"not only not to admit any shadow of fraud, into our own transactions,\r\nbut in no way to countenance any one tainted with secrets, however\r\nlucrative.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the true way of looking at things; all on the square, ma'am,\r\nand all above board. And nothing else answers in the long run, does it?\r\nHowever,\" continued my father, \"if I should by any chance be down that\r\nway, I might like to look in at Barlow's works,--without letting him\r\nknow who I was, of course. I should understand all his devices, at a\r\nglance.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would know me in a moment, if I went down;\" Mr. Windsor was trying\r\nnot to wink at father; \"but he never would guess that you were in the\r\ntrade, if you wear your blue coat, and brass buttons, the one that makes\r\nthe boys call you 'the Admiral.' And by the sea-side, that would be the\r\nproper thing. Only fair play, Bubbly, and honour bright. Snacks--as our\r\nJack says--in whatever you find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooh!\" cried father; \"after all our experience, what could a country\r\nbumpkin teach us? Ah, Mrs. Windsor, what things we could tell you, if\r\nladies' nerves were stronger! But, John, I've a great mind to take your\r\nadvice, and encourage the policy of our noble Government, in doing me a\r\ngood turn, as early as they can. We will get away before those\r\nunprincipled Rads can serve their skulking summons. That Joe Cowl means\r\nto get up to-morrow, after shamming to be dead for a fortnight,--a\r\nConservative sweep would have cured his cold, by stopping up a\r\nchimney--and on Friday he goes for his summons, I hear. The Beak is a\r\nRad, and will let him have it. I shall trust you to keep it all dark\r\nabout us, and mum's the address of our luggage, and letters. But Friday\r\nwill find all the Upmore family stowed away happy, at Happystowe.\"\r\n\r\nMy father was ever a man of his word. He made his arrangements for\r\nhalf-time boiling, and the completion of all contracts, and left money\r\nenough for a fortnight's work, and then we set off in the soap-van; with\r\nold _Jerry_ in the shafts, and a hamper of good things, and our best\r\nclothes on, and _Grip_ sitting up in front, and the tilt hanging down,\r\nas if by accident, over the third hoop from the back, so that nobody\r\ncould tell that we had got a bit of luggage. And we jogged along up the\r\nLane first towards Hampstead, so that all the neighbours thought we were\r\ngoing for a pic-nic, as indeed we thoroughly deserved to do, and they\r\nwished us a pleasant day and no rain; for they all had a kindly will to\r\nus. But as soon as we had thanked them, and got them out of sight, what\r\ndid father do but turn old _Jerry_, and take the shortest cut to\r\nShoreditch?\r\n\r\nAt that time, London was not such a thorough rat-warren of railways as\r\nit is now; and although I had travelled by steam before, it was new\r\nenough to be delightful. We were going by a line, which was then\r\nconsidered the most dangerous in Great Britain; and this made my mother\r\nput her head out of the window, in her anxiety about me, and father,\r\nwhenever there was anything at all to see. We wanted to look out for\r\nourselves; but she declared that she understood things best; and there\r\nwas no chance of getting at the other window, because four people put a\r\ncloth along their knees, and went on eating, for leagues, and hours. So\r\nmy father went to sleep, and I tried to get peeps (behind dear mother's\r\nbonnet) of the far world flying by. With all my heart I longed to see\r\nthe sea, of which I had heard so many things, wonderful, terrible, and\r\nenchanting. My mother had bought me a straw-hat, with a blue ribbon on\r\nit, like a gallant sailor's; and she should have endeavoured, after\r\nthat, to show me the sea, if it ever came in sight. But nothing that I\r\ncould say--though I never stopped bothering, as she called it--would\r\nkeep her attention to that point; and I found out afterwards the reason\r\nfor it; she was not at all sure about knowing the sea, when she saw it,\r\nand was afraid of making some mistake.\r\n\r\n\"What do I care about the sea?\" said father, rather grumpily, when I\r\npestered him. \"People call it the sea, because you can't see it. Or if\r\nyou do, you can't see anything else. I would much rather have a good\r\nLondon fog. Go to sleep, boy; and don't keep jerking at my legs so.\"\r\n\r\nMy father had been out of sorts for some time, which had made it\r\ndesirable that he should come away, even without any summons against\r\nhim. His appetite was queer, and he wanted setting up. Before Mr.\r\nWindsor came urging him so, I heard him say to mother,\r\n\r\n\"A leg of mutton goes twice with me now; and I call that a very serious\r\nsign.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then be more free-handed with your money,\" answered mother.\r\n\r\nAnd now he was touchy, because poor _Grip_ though accustomed to living\r\nin a tub at school, was aggrieved at the box which the Company provided\r\nfor dogs on their travels, and expressed his grief in a howl, that\r\nout-howled the engine. His chest was capacious, and his lungs elastic,\r\nhis heart also of the finest order; and for these gifts of nature, my\r\nfather condemned him!\r\n\r\n\"Now, rouse up, rouse up, everybody;\" father shouted, as if we had all\r\nbeen asleep--which he alone had been, in spite of _Grip_--when the bus\r\nfrom the \"Happystowe Road,\" (which was five or six miles from the\r\ngenuine Happystowe) pulled up, in a ring of newly planted trees, and in\r\nfront of a porch with square pillars to it. \"Tommy, look sharp, and\r\ncount all our boxes in. Put them down in Latin, if it comes more easy.\r\nSophy, accept my arm, up the steps; never pretend to be younger than you\r\nare. Mrs. Roaker, we are come to spend a week with you if agreeable, and\r\nnot too expensive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Upmore!\" said mother, in a tone of quiet dignity, such as she had\r\nheard Mrs. Windsor use; \"as if a few pounds made any difference to you!\r\nWe are out for the holidays, and we mean to have them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the thing to begin with is a rattling good dinner,\" father\r\nanswered, without any dignity at all; \"bless my--something the dinner\r\ngoes into, Mrs. Roaker,--if it isn't going on for seven o'clock! And\r\nnothing all the way, but hard boiled eggs, and a cold duck, and ham\r\nsandwiches. I never was so hungry in all my life; starving is the proper\r\nword for it. What can we have for dinner, ma'am, and what is the\r\nshortest time for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything you please to name, sir;\" said the landlady, who understood\r\nthings; \"and the time will naturally depend upon the nature of the\r\n_plats_ you order.\"\r\n\r\n\"No foreign kickshaws, and no French plates, for me, ma'am! A pair of\r\nfried soles, and a bit of roast mutton, hot from the fire, and a cold\r\napple-pie. Sophy, can you think of anything else you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we have a bedroom with a fine sea view?\" My mother had been pensive\r\nall day, and religious, because of leaving home, and of the dangers of\r\nthe train. \"We have not seen the sea yet, Mrs. Roaker, to our certain\r\nknowledge. You must not suppose us to be any sort of Cockneys; and\r\nindeed we live quite outside of London, in a beautiful place, with green\r\nfields round it; still we are what you may call inlanders, and we feel a\r\nkind of interest in the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sophy, you had better order dinner, after that;\" said my father, very\r\nshortly; \"now, Tommy, you be off. I am not going out, till I've had my\r\ndinner. But I can't stand any more of your plague about the sea. Find\r\nsomebody to show you where it is; or you ought to find it out, by the\r\nrow it makes. I hear a noise now, like an engine with the steam slack.\r\nBut don't tumble into it, when you find it; though you never were born\r\nto be drowned, that I'll swear.\"\r\n\r\nWithout any answer to this cut at me,--which I did not deserve, as old\r\nRum could have told him--I whistled for _Grip_, who was looking about,\r\nafter running all the way from the station, for any dog anxious to\r\ninsult him; and as soon as he came, and made a jump at me, we set off\r\ntogether without more ado, to find out where the sea was, by the noise\r\nit made; of which I was beginning now to read in Homer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_THALATTA!_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was five years now, since I had first gone up, (without any intention\r\nof doing so) from the surface of the earth into the regions of the air,\r\nthrough the sudden expansion of my heart and system, at the thought of\r\nthree days' holiday. In the interval, there had been times of elation\r\nand elevation, when it was difficult for me to keep down, and the mere\r\nshake of an elbow would have sent me up. And among them, I recollect one\r\nChristmas-eve, when there was a hard frost on, and the people at the\r\nHampstead ponds were skating, and the ice was all green for boys to\r\nslide on, and the trees on the hill were all feathered with snow, and\r\nJack Windsor came up to me, and said, \"plum-pudding for dinner, at your\r\nhouse, Tommy; I smelled it, as I came up the Lane\"--I was all on the\r\nflutter to fly, and astonish the people, who were putting skates on; and\r\nI could not have helped it--for there was nothing to lay hold of--if\r\n_Grip_ (who was full of my bodily welfare) had not laid hold of me by\r\nthe tails of the scarlet comforter, which mother had knotted so tightly,\r\nthat I could not get it off.\r\n\r\n\"Get away, you vile dog! Go up, Tommy,\" Jack Windsor cried, and would\r\ngladly have kicked _Grip_, if prudence had permitted it; \"oh, Tommy, do\r\ngo up; I have heard so much about it, and I'd give anything to see you\r\nfly!\"\r\n\r\nFor my part, I was not at all afraid; my feet were off the ground, and\r\nthere is very little doubt, that I should have escaped from the\r\ncomforter, and _Grip_, if Jack had not made such a stupid fuss about it.\r\n\r\n\"Halloa there! What are you boys doing?\" A heavy policeman came\r\ngrumbling along, without any sense of the situation; \"if you don't move\r\non, and take that beast of a dog further, I'll walk you pretty quick to\r\nthe station.\"\r\n\r\n\"331 V.,\" answered Jack, who inherited his mother's lofty style, \"if you\r\nknew who we are, you'd employ your cheek to keep your tongue in, and\r\nsave me the trouble of reporting you.\"\r\n\r\nThe constable pretended not to hear him; but the whole of my volatile\r\npower was gone--so sensitive has it always been--and instead of going up\r\nto the sky, I was glad to sit down upon the broad back of the faithful\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nAnd now, I can assure you, and you will readily believe it, that having\r\nbeen plagued so long by boys, (and grown-up people, quite as\r\ntroublesome, at times) concerning what had happened to me, at an early\r\nage, and being rebuked, and jeered, and scoffed at--sometimes for having\r\nthis gift, and sometimes for not making more of it, and sometimes for\r\nsetting up a false claim to it--young as I was, I had thought a good\r\ndeal, and made up my mind, in fifty different ways, about it.\r\n\r\nBut though my conclusions perpetually varied, there was one grain of\r\nwisdom to be found in all. It had pleased Heaven, to afflict me with an\r\nunusually light corporeal part, and then to relieve that affliction, in\r\nsome measure, by the gift of a buoyant and complacent mind; so that I\r\nwas able--unless a bad cold, or measles, or mumps, or chilblains stopped\r\nme--to be hopeful that all would turn out for the best, and to keep my\r\nnature boyish, throughout a boyhood of some perplexity.\r\n\r\n_Grip_, though faithful, and sage, as almost all the patriarchs put\r\ntogether, might still be considered a juvenile dog, by those who dwell\r\nchiefly on the right side of things. To say that his heart was still in\r\nthe right place, would be little less than an insult to him, and to the\r\ngreat race of which he was one; but it is not so wholly a matter of\r\ncourse, that his mind was still ardent, and his spirit lofty. Very few\r\n\"Scientists\" of any candour could have looked at _Grip_, when prepared\r\nfor battle (with his ears pricked up, and his neck on the rasp, and his\r\ntail set with stiffening bulges) without finding a nobler result of\r\nevolution, and a likelier survival, than their own.\r\n\r\nHis thankful spirit had not yet exhausted the joys of freedom from the\r\nRailway box; and perhaps--though it is not for me to say it--the\r\nHappystowe air was more mercurial than that of our works, which confined\r\nhis meditations too persistently to one theme--bone. But let that pass;\r\nit is quite impossible to explain everything that happens; all I know is\r\nthat _Grip_ set off from the porch of the _Twentifold Arms Hotel_, with\r\na flourish, and a scurry, and a gambol of delight. With a gentle breeze\r\nmoving behind me, I started, to catch him and get the first sight of the\r\nsea; and then, down a steep path, we came round the corner of what must\r\nhave been a live rock, and behold----\r\n\r\nBehold! was a word you might have shouted at me, like thunder, without\r\nmy knowing it. Because my whole nature was absorbed in beholding, or\r\ngazing, or staring, or mooning, or being bemooned--for the things were\r\ndone to me, without my doing any one of them. Behind me, shone the low\r\nsummer sun, throwing out my shadow any length it pleased, on an endless,\r\nmeasureless, countless, unimaginable world of silver, like the moon come\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nIf I could have uttered any syllable, to let off, or thought of any\r\ndefinite idea, to keep in the wondrous inconceivable expansion of my\r\nnature, perhaps, even now, I might have stayed upon the ground. But\r\nbeing as I was, away I went, starting, at a height of about ten feet\r\nabove the level of Spring-tides, with a moderate Westerly breeze behind\r\nme, and the light of the sinking sun coming up, under the soles of my\r\nshoes, as I slowly went round. And unluckily I had all my best clothes\r\non--new from a shop down in Liverpool Street, the first Sunday of the\r\nsummer holidays.\r\n\r\nPeople, who have never been up like this, might suppose, at first sight,\r\nthat I was terrified; especially at being carried out to sea, as my\r\nfirst acquaintance with that great space. But without laying claim to\r\nany share of courage, I may state, as a simple matter of fact, that I\r\nhappened to feel no fear whatever. My father, (as truthful a man as ever\r\nlived, and from whom I inherit that quality) had said that I never was\r\nborn to be drowned; and if I thought at all (which I disremember doing)\r\nthat alone would have reassured me. At any rate, I looked around, as\r\ncalmly as if I were sitting down to dinner; but with this disadvantage,\r\nthat I could not keep my gaze very firmly fixed upon anything, because\r\nof the rotation of my body. For instance, I was able to shout down to\r\n_Grip_ (who was howling most mournfully in the gap, and making sad jumps\r\nto come after me) that I was all right, and would come back, by and by;\r\nbut before I could judge whether he was consoled, my eyes were on a ship\r\na long way out. If there had been much wind, perhaps it would have\r\nproved a ticklish thing for me; but the air was calm, and full of yellow\r\nlight, the sea was below me, like a floor of silver, the sky of a pure\r\nsoft blue, wherever the sun did not interfere with it; and nothing on\r\nany side suggested danger, or uneasiness.\r\n\r\nBut, whatever the state of things may be, the human element is certain\r\nto rush in, and spoil all the comfort of nature. I had not been at all\r\ndisconcerted, at perceiving that some people on the beach were surprised\r\nby my appearance, at a considerable height above their heads. They were\r\ncalling out loudly to one another, and running together, or running\r\naway, and rubbing their eyes, as if the sun had taken the accuracy out\r\nof them. This rather pleased me, and improved my flight (which depends\r\nvery much upon the approval of mankind), and I was beginning to practise\r\nmovements, which I had thought of, and heard of from Jack Windsor. Jack\r\nhad been taking swimming lessons, and being a wonderfully heavy fellow,\r\nhad tried very hard to keep his head up. He had learned the whole theory\r\nof it beautifully, and showed me how easy it was to do; but as yet he\r\nhad never been able to do it. Whatever I have done above the surface of\r\nthe earth--which people are stupid enough to call flying--is nothing\r\nmore than swimming in the air, or floating; or best of all, perhaps, I\r\nshould say treading, as people who are heavy enough \"tread water.\" And\r\nmy great desire was to be my own master, to steer myself a little, as a\r\nman can do in swimming; instead of going round and round, at the air's\r\ndiscretion, like a bunch of lime-berries in September.\r\n\r\nBut, just as I was learning with my hands and feet, and some guidance of\r\nthe silken summer tunic at my hips,--what did I discover but a great\r\nlong gun, taken up by a man, from a boat upon the beach, and then being\r\npointed with a careful aim at me! I endeavoured to scream out--\"I am\r\nTommy; only Tommy Upmore going for a fly; if you shoot me, you will be\r\nhanged for murder!\"--but I give you my word that my fright was so great,\r\nthat no sound of any use would come out of my mouth. Old Rum's cane was\r\nquite a joke, compared to this. Every atom of my levity turned to lead,\r\nmy hands fell to my sides, and my feet struck together, and I dropped,\r\nlike a well-bucket, when the rope is broken.\r\n\r\nAnd I never had a luckier drop in my life--good as it is for all mortals\r\nto come down--for just above my hair, (which had been floating, like a\r\nsunset cloud, they say, but was now standing out, like a badger's, with\r\nalarm) a heavy charge of duck-shot, that would have killed _Grip_ dead,\r\nwent whistling like a goods'-train engine; and a streak of white still\r\nmay be discovered in my head, from the combination of fear and fact.\r\n\r\nAnd my drop was quite as lucky at the lower end; for descending, as you\r\nmight say without exaggeration, almost vertically, (though my head, the\r\nlightest portion of my system, still was up) instead of falling into the\r\nsea, I was received in a sail, spread to catch me by a very lovely boat.\r\n\r\nSome moments elapsed, as I have reason to believe, before either my\r\nrescuers, or myself, were fit to go into all the questions that arose.\r\nNaturally enough, they were surprised at the style of my visit to them;\r\nwhile I was not only embarrassed by shyness, at finding myself among\r\ngreat people, but also to some extent confused in mind, from the many\r\ngyrations of my upward, and the rapid descent of my downward course;\r\nmoreover, I had never been in a boat till now, and the motion of the\r\nboards upon the water disconcerted me, more than any action of the air.\r\n\r\nBut while I was balancing myself like this, after stepping from the sail\r\nthat was spread for me, a beautiful lady, who had been sitting on a fur,\r\nand looking at me with surprise and interest, arose and came towards me,\r\nwith some little doubt enlarging the brightness of her large bright\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you are a boy--a boy!\" she cried, as if Nature ought to have made\r\nme a girl; \"and as pretty a boy as I ever beheld. From the way you went\r\nround, and the height it was up, I thought it must be a machine at\r\nleast--one of those wonderful things they invent, to do almost anything,\r\nnowadays. Whatever you are, you can speak, I am sure; and I am not going\r\nto be afraid of you. Where do you come from? And what is your name? And\r\nhow long have you been up in the air, like that? And have you got any\r\nfather, and mother? And how did you get such most wonderful hair, like\r\nspun silk, every bit of it? And--and, why don't you answer me?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, ma'am,\" I said, looking up at her with wonder, for I\r\nnever had seen such a beautiful being, although I had been to a play,\r\nseveral times; \"I was trying to think, what question you would please to\r\nlike me to begin with answering. I'm afraid that I cannot remember them\r\nall, because of my head going round so. But my name is 'Tommy Upmore,'\r\nand I come from Maiden Lane, St. Pancras.\"\r\n\r\n\"St. Pancras! Why, that is in London, surely. Did you come in a balloon,\r\nor how can you have done it? Sit down and rest; I am sure you must be\r\ntired. Though you look like a rose, Master Tommy Upmore.\"\r\n\r\nI answered the beautiful lady, as soon as presence of mind permitted,\r\nthat I had not come the whole way from London, through the sky, as she\r\nseemed to suppose, but only from yonder place on the shore; where I\r\nshowed her _Grip_, still howling now and then, and striving with all his\r\neyes, and heart, to make sure what was become of me. She replied that,\r\neven so, it was in her opinion wonderful; and she doubted if she could\r\nhave been brought to believe it, unless she had seen it with her own\r\neyes. I told her that several most eminent men of science saw nothing\r\nsurprising in it; but accounted for it easily, in various ways, without\r\nany two having to use the same way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile she was begging me not to be afraid, herself having now\r\novercome all fear; and she signed to the boatmen (who had fallen back,\r\nwith their frank faces wrinkled, as a puzzle is) that they might come\r\nforward, and be kind to me. It was not in their power to do this,\r\nbecause they had not yet finished staring; therefore she offered me her\r\nown white hand, and I wished that I had washed mine lately.\r\n\r\n\"These are my children,\" she said, as I followed her down the planks,\r\nwithout a word; \"it was Laura, who saw you first up in the air, and Roly\r\nwho ordered the men to row over, when that wicked young man put his gun\r\nup. We thought it was some new kind of bird. And so you are--a boy bird!\r\nRoly, and Laura, let me introduce you to this young gentleman. There is\r\nnothing about him to be afraid of, although he has come down from the\r\nclouds, or rather from the clear sky, this beautiful evening. He\r\ndeclares that he can be scientifically explained; and when that can be\r\ndone, there is nothing more to say. Roly has never known what fear is,\r\never since he cut his teeth.\"\r\n\r\nFrom all I have seen of this gentleman since then--and I have seen a\r\ngreat deal of him for twenty years, and never can see too much of him--I\r\ncan fully confirm what his dear mother said. Just then, he was a boy of\r\nabout my age, or a year or two older he might be; but pounds, and tens,\r\nand twenty pounds, heavier, and an inch or two taller, and many shades\r\ndarker. I was as fair in complexion, before a great mob of troubles came\r\ndarkening me, as if I had sprung from a boiling of Pontic wax,\r\nbesprinkled with roses of Cashmere. But Roly (or to give him his full\r\ndeserts, Sir Roland Towers-Twentifold) was a dark, and thoughtful, and\r\ndetermined lad, who meant to make his mark upon our history, and is\r\ndoing it.\r\n\r\nHe came up, and took my hand, as if he would squeeze any cloudiness out\r\nof me; and nothing but the pinches I had often had at school, enabled me\r\nto bear it without a squeak. He had been at the helm, as they call it,\r\nto direct the boat the right way to catch me; and although he was\r\ngreatly surprised, he concluded--as all Englishmen do upon such\r\noccasions--that the time to explain things would ensue, after they had\r\nbeen dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW ADMIRAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo me, who am accustomed to myself, it has always seemed much more\r\nwonderful, that my father should deny my peculiar powers, than that I\r\nshould possess them. \"Go up, Tommy,\" he has said a thousand times;\r\n\"don't be so shy about it, but up with you! The proof of the pudding is\r\nin the eating. Only fly up to the bedroom window sill, as that little\r\nsparrow from the road has done, and I'll own that I'm a fool, and you a\r\nwonder. But, until you have done it, in my sight, my son, I shall stick\r\nto my old experience, that all the human race are liars, but not one of\r\nthem a flyer.\"\r\n\r\nHis strong opinion proved itself, as the manner of strong opinions is;\r\nand instead of being able to arise, while he was waiting, with his hands\r\nin his pockets, and a pipe in his mouth, I was more inclined to go into\r\nthe ground, whenever it happened to be soft.\r\n\r\nAnd so, even now, (when some fifty people had seen me in the air, and\r\nwere ready to make oath to a great deal more than I had done) father\r\nstuck to it, that they all were liars, or fools, or crazy, or else tipsy\r\nat the least. But he scarcely knew what to say at first, when just as he\r\nwas going to sit down to dinner, a mighty great noise arose under the\r\nwindow, of sailors hurraing, and the brass-band roaring, and _Grip_ as\r\nloud as any of them, barking at his utmost.\r\n\r\n\"D--n it,\" said my father to my mother; \"is this the quiet place John\r\nWindsor spoke of? When a man can't even sit down to his dinner----\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner indeed! Don't think twice of your dinner;\" cried mother from the\r\nwindow, in great excitement, \"here is a thing that you never saw before,\r\nand will never see again, if you live to be a hundred. Our Tommy in a\r\nflag, and all the sailors in the kingdom, taking off their hats, and\r\ncheering him, and the dear little poppet as modest as ever, exactly like\r\nan Angel! And a beautiful lady, you can see by the look that all the\r\nplace belongs to her--you can tell at a glance who she is, of\r\ncourse--Bucephalus, how slow you are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Slow, for not knowing at a glance a female, I never saw or heard of, in\r\nall my life! And in a strange place I was never in before! How should I\r\nknow her from Adam--or at least, Eve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bucephalus! Why, of course she must be Lady Towers-Twentifold, widow of\r\nthe late, and sincerely lamented, Sir Robert Towers-Twentifold, who\r\ndied, after tortures surpassing description, from swallowing his own\r\ncorundum tooth. Every stick, and stone, for ten miles in every direction\r\nbelongs to him, and he leaves a lovely widow, and an only son, the\r\npresent Sir Roland Towers-Twentifold, scarcely any older than our Tommy,\r\nand an only daughter Laura. Bless me, how true everything is coming! I\r\ncan believe every word of it, now I see them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Including the man with the corundum tooth. In the name of Moses,\r\nSophy, how the deuce have you found out all this already?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have found out nothing; and I am surprised at your low way of putting\r\nit, Bucephalus. When I met the chambermaid, could I do less than pass\r\nthe time of day to her? But look, they have carried our Tommy three\r\ntimes, with the 'Conquering Hero comes' twice and a half, round the--I\r\nforget what dear Jane Windsor says is the right foreign name for it--and\r\nI think, Mr. Upmore, the least we can do, is to throw up the window, and\r\nbow our acknowledgments gracefully, as the papers say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm blowed if I'll do anything of the sort. Half a crown's worth of\r\ncoppers would be gone in no time. Keep behind the curtain, Sophy; or\r\nback we all go to business to-morrow morning; and I heartily wish we had\r\nnever come away. At home, when I am hungry, I can get my dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh dear, he has spoiled his white ducks with tar, and _Grip_ is in a\r\ndreadful mess of wet, and the sailors want to hoist him too, if he would\r\nonly let them! I see what it is--how stupid of me! Tommy has been flying\r\nall over the sea, and _Grip_ has been swimming after him! Oh,\r\nBucephalus, how can you eat your dinner? Is this a proper time, for you\r\nto be devouring dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right enough there, Sophy;\" answered father, \"I ought to have\r\nhad it five hours ago. I call it tempting Providence with one's\r\nconstitution, to go so long after breakfast-time. I only hope, the\r\nzanies won't come wanting to hoist me.\"\r\n\r\nAlas, that the stronger of my parents should have shown such\r\nincredulity! Did it follow that, inasmuch as he was heavy, all his\r\nproductions must draw the beam? If so, dead must drop all the wit of\r\nFalstaff, and all the sweet humour of Thackeray. And how could my father\r\nhave made light sperm, or the soap, that he labelled \"the froth of the\r\nsea\"? Such questions, however, come dangerously near to science, and its\r\nvast analogies. Enough, that my father paid dear in the end, for all\r\nthis incredulity; as will be made manifest, further on; and sorry shall\r\nI be to tell it.\r\n\r\nMy dear mother was already of opinion, that it was a crime upon any\r\none's part, even to attempt to explain my achievements, and downright\r\ntreason to deny them. When the beautiful Lady Twentifold--as people\r\ncalled her for convenience, though her proper name was\r\n_Towers-Twentifold_--came, when the public was tired of shouting, to\r\nlearn all that could with propriety be learned, of the origin of her\r\n\"great little wonder,\" few people verily would believe what my mother\r\nwas fanciful enough to do. The lady (to whom the hotel belonged, and all\r\nthe people there, in my opinion) sat down in the parlour downstairs,\r\nwith my hand in hers--for she had taken dear liking to me, because I\r\nresembled a child she had lost--and she begged the landlady to go to my\r\nmother, without any card or formality, and ask whether she might have\r\nthe pleasure of seeing, and telling her about her boy.\r\n\r\nIt is a very clumsy thing for me to find fault with the behaviour of my\r\nparents, and I am not prepared to do so now. There may have been fifty\r\nreasons, clear to people much wiser than myself; but certainly I was\r\namazed, and angry, when Mrs. Roaker came back to say, that the lady\r\nfrom London was so fatigued, with the dreadful effects of her journey,\r\nthat she begged to thank her ladyship most warmly, for very great\r\nkindness to her dear son; but felt quite unequal to an interview with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"How many of you are there, Tommy?\" Lady Twentifold asked, without my\r\nknowing why. But she always went straight to the meaning of things.\r\n\r\n\"Only me, ma'am, if you please;\" I answered, looking up, in fear that\r\nthere ought to have been more; \"but I did hear a woman say, that there\r\nhad been another; but he went to heaven, before me, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady looked at me, with her eyes quite soft, which they had not\r\nbeen, when she received that message; and she seemed to be uncertain,\r\nwhether she was right, in putting her next question.\r\n\r\n\"Has your father been married more than once, my dear? I mean, is this\r\nlady your own dear mother, or become your mamma, since you can\r\nremember?\"\r\n\r\nI told her, that I could not remember any one thing about it, though I\r\noften thought. But this was my mother, Mrs. Upmore; everybody said so;\r\nand more than that, there was nobody else in all the world, who made a\r\nquarter so much of me.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, I am quite satisfied upon that point,\" she answered; \"there may\r\nbe some reason, which I do not know of. Or perhaps your dear mother is\r\nnot at all strong. Give her my compliments, and say that I hope she will\r\nbe better soon, and the Happystowe air relieve her weakness. Now shake\r\nhands with Roly, and little Laura; and good-bye till we see you again,\r\nflying Tommy.\"\r\n\r\nI had told her that my name was \"flying Tommy;\" and she was much\r\npleased to hear it, because it showed, that the Happystowe air was not\r\nto blame, for my adventure. Then Sir Roland came up, and took my hand,\r\nand said that he hoped I would take him for a fly; and then, the most\r\nbeautiful child I had ever set eyes on, stole up shyly, and put her\r\nlittle hand in mine, and left me to say good-bye to her.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, I felt as heavy as _Grip_ (who weighed half a\r\npound for every ounce that a human being of his size would weigh), and\r\nmy father and my mother agreed, from different points of view, about\r\nme,--that I must be kept indoors, and fed, and put at my books, to\r\nsteady me. We had brought some Greek in the bottom of a box, which\r\nfather considered great nonsense, though it might be very good for\r\nchildren. And he told me to find out the Greek for soap, and spermaceti,\r\nand steam-engine, and write them down, so that he could read them; which\r\nI entirely failed to do. Meanwhile he set off, with his Admiral's coat,\r\nto inspect the sea and the shipping, and Mr. Barlow's boiling premises.\r\n\r\nThe day after that again was Sunday, when the rule of our house, and of\r\nmost houses in Maiden Lane, was to lie in bed until nine o'clock, and\r\nhave breakfast at ten, and attend to the dinner till dinner-time, and\r\nsaunter in the fields towards Highgate, if the weather was fine in the\r\nafternoon, and to go to church, or chapel, sometimes, if there was\r\nnothing else to do in the evening; and then have a good supper, and be\r\noff to bed. But now mother said, and my father was quite unable to\r\ngainsay it, that, being in a country place like this, where everything\r\ndepends upon example, with my father acknowledged to be an Admiral--not\r\nonly because of his coat, and occasional d--ns, and general demeanour,\r\nbut also because he had shaken his head, when requested to look at a\r\nship through a spy-glass for twopence, and told the ancient tar that he\r\nhad seen a deal too much of that--moreover with Tommy adored by all the\r\naristocracy of the neighbourhood, and by the brave sailors, and people\r\nof less refinement, accepted as an angel, the least we could do was to\r\nmake an effort, and try to be at church by eleven o'clock.\r\n\r\nMy father replied, that as concerned himself there need be no difficulty\r\nwhatever, because as soon as he had done his breakfast, his only\r\npreparation was to smoke a pipe; but he did not believe that it was\r\npossible for mother, (who had spent all Saturday in the village-shops,\r\nbecause she had come in such hurry from home, that she had brought\r\nnothing fit to be seen in) to have all her toggery spick-and-span, and\r\nher hair done up to the nines, so early. But, if only to show him how\r\nlittle he knew, my mother was ready before he was; and father declared\r\nthat she ruined his sleep, having got up to see the sun rise upon the\r\nsea, and stopped up to see herself grow brighter, and brighter, in the\r\nlooking-glass. Dear mother had a great mind not to go to church, with\r\nsuch a wicked story ringing in her ears; until father told her that she\r\nlooked stunning, and was fit to be put on a transparent lid--the lid of\r\na box of transparent soap.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Bucephalus, now you see,\" she said, as she placed her primrose\r\nglove, on the sleeve of his blue coat with brass buttons, \"one little\r\nportion perhaps of the reason, which led me to decline an interview,\r\nthat night, with Lady Towers-Twentifold. My main reason was, of course,\r\nthat I knew so thoroughly well what ladies are. If I had allowed her to\r\nsee me, and satisfy all her great curiosity, about this wonderful\r\ndarling of a Tommy, the chances are ten to one, that her ladyship would\r\nnever have invited him to Twentifold Towers. But now, I intend that he\r\nshall go there; and what will the Windsors say to that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was a very fine reason, Sophy. But I don't see the other,\r\nthat I ought to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then Tommy is sharper than you, ten times. But walk a little better, if\r\nyou please, my dear. Who can take you for an Admiral, if you drag your\r\nfeet like that?\"\r\n\r\nFrom a joke, Mr. Windsor's idea had grown into a great and solid fact.\r\nMrs. Roaker, and most of the Happystowe people, had made up their minds\r\nby this time, that my father was \"Admiral Upmore.\" He was too honest,\r\nand plain a man, to encourage this mistake for a moment, and, whenever\r\nhe got the chance, declared most stoutly, that he was no Admiral. The\r\npublic, however, would not believe him, having met with some indications\r\nin commercial dealings with him, that he prized the royal effigy; from\r\nwhich it was clear, what his motive was in desiring to disguise his\r\nrank. And the Boots of the _Twentifold Arms_ could swear that he saw\r\n_Admiral_ printed, on the back of the label of a hairy trunk, which had\r\nonly B. U. on the front of it. And so he did, to a certain extent; for\r\nmother had taken an advertising card beginning with _Admirable_, and\r\ncut it across, and put father's initials on the other side.\r\n\r\n\"They may call me what they like,\" my father said, when tired of\r\ncontradiction, \"so long as they don't charge me for it. _Admiral_ Upmore\r\nserves my turn, uncommonly well, for two things. Billy Barlow would lock\r\nhis gate, if he knew that I am only Boiler Upmore; and I am finding out\r\nsome fine things there. And again, if any lawyer comes sneaking after my\r\nheels, with that chummy's process, he'll find his mistake in the\r\nvisitor's list. But, Tommy, you'll catch it, if you let out a word of\r\nthis in Maiden Lane. Why, I never should hear the last of it!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so the whole three of us went to church; and the sailors sitting on\r\nthe tombstones--most of which were like chests of drawers, but without\r\nany handles to the names below--touched their hats to the Admiral's\r\nlady, and the gallant Admiral himself, and the smart little chap, who\r\nhad been for a fly, like the cherub aloft, who smiles luck to poor Jack.\r\nIt was one of dear mother's proudest moments--for the men at our works\r\nwould never touch their hats, unless they had been tipped a shilling\r\nquite lately--and she bowed with her feathers (which had been a cock's)\r\nthrowing off quite a flash, and a rustle; until she was compelled to\r\nlook very grave, by the remark of an ancient tar, that he had never seen\r\nso fine a woman.\r\n\r\nBut alas, how fate does ring her changes with articulate-speaking\r\nmortals--the triumph of the chime, the hesitation of the back-stroke,\r\nand the toll of disappointment! Ere ever the bells in the tower had\r\nceased, and the organ taken up the tale, dear mother was a\r\npensive-hearted female, and her feathers out of plume. For in coming up\r\nthe aisle, she had whispered to the buxom pew-opener; \"Lady\r\nTowers-Twentifold has been seeking to make my acquaintance. Can we sit\r\nanywhere near her pew?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, ma'am;\" said Mrs. Button, turning the handle of a large\r\nenclosure; \"the Admiral, and yourself, can have her ladyship's pew, this\r\nmorning, and this evening too, if you come again. Her ladyship has\r\nfifteen pews, in the fifteen parishes she owns, and she takes them all\r\nin turn; and it won't be our turn, for ten Sundays yet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nLARGE IDEAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was lucky for me, that my mother had failed to amaze Lady\r\nTwentifold, with the elegance of her apparel. But after having taken all\r\nthat trouble, and lost all her comfort of the morning, she felt it no\r\nless than a personal slight, that her ladyship should have disgraced\r\nherself so, by neglecting divine worship.\r\n\r\n\"But she went to some other church,\" said father.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe a word of it,\" answered mother, with both hands on her\r\nprayer-book; \"she spent her whole morning in bed, no doubt. I never\r\ncould endure those slothful ways; and the less we have to do with such\r\npeople, the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, who ever dreamed of our having anything to do with them?\" My\r\nfather was astonished at any new idea always. \"Sophy, I won't have this\r\nrubbish any more. I came down here, to enjoy myself, and live well, and\r\nimprove my liver; as well as to bilk the vile harpies of the law, and\r\nfind out Billy Barlow's tricks. But if I'm to put out my pipe, and smoke\r\nwet rolls (like Tom's taffy-sucks), and never be seen in my\r\nshirt-sleeves, and never get a smell of hot meat, till the bats are\r\nabout, and be cut short of my d--ns indoors, and backed up in them out\r\nof doors,--why the world will have come to such a stuck-up pitch, as\r\nwould soon turn me into a Radical.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother said less, but pondered more. In bygone days, she had seemed\r\ncontent with the place in which she found herself, proud of the works,\r\nand the sample-boxes, and our renown for quality; and insisting upon it,\r\nthat we should be styled in all transactions \"Upmore & Co.\" But lately,\r\nor indeed for a long time now, her mind had been taking an elevated\r\ntone, which lowered the quality of our victuals. She talked a great deal\r\nmore of honour, and much less of honesty; she began to look down upon\r\nthe Sunday papers; and she would not let her friends say \"Ma'am\" to her.\r\nMy father declared, that this disease began with my going to the\r\n_Partheneion_, and was made much worse by Mrs. Windsor, and the four\r\nprofessors, and was now turned into a pestilence, by these\r\nbathing-machines, and the sailors at the church, and the brass-horn\r\nrogues coming round with the cap, and \"my lady, if you please,\" upon the\r\nsands.\r\n\r\nThis \"growth of refinement\" as dear mother called it,--\"spread of\r\nhumbug\" was my father's name for it--turned her attention, quite\r\nsuddenly, to what she called my associations. The habit of my body, and\r\nmind, had been that of London boyhood in general,--to rush into anything\r\ngoing on, without waiting for an introduction, to give my opinion\r\nwithout invitation upon any public spectacle, or even a proceeding\r\nintended to be private until I came round the corner, and upon every\r\noccasion to ignore humanity's false exclusiveness. But on Monday\r\nmorning, when we sat down to look at the people bathing--which my\r\nfather, from some old-fashioned feeling, would never stop to do, but\r\nkept his distance,--mother began to give me a lesson, concerning the\r\nduties of society.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" she said, \"did you remark that the little boys go into one\r\nmachine, and the little girls into the other? And they are not allowed,\r\nby the Board of Health, to be less than fifty yards apart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother,\" I replied, \"I was looking at that; and it seems to be the\r\norder on the board. But somehow they seem to contrive, in spite of it,\r\nto get all together in the water. And the girls--if I can make out which\r\nthey are--seem to go all the way over to the boys! The board says that\r\nthey will be prosecuted, with the extreme rigour of the law. There goes\r\nanother girl, I declare!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Tommy, hush! Or society will expel us, like a pair of Pariahs.\r\nWhat I want you to notice, for your own good, is that high society has\r\nrules quite different from what the children in the street have. You,\r\nunluckily, have been permitted, while your father was in a smaller way\r\nof business, to associate with almost any boy of respectable trousers,\r\nin the roadway. I admit that I have not been as strict as I should be,\r\npartly because it was no good. But now it is high time to draw the line.\r\nYou see how they put a cord along down there? Now what do you suppose\r\nthey do it for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I don't know, mother; unless it is, for people to tumble over\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Tommy, no. It is to keep the people out. The inferior classes must\r\nnot come interfering with those who can pay for all the room they want.\r\nYour father is a Tory; but I begin to think, that I shall be a Radical;\r\nbecause I find them make people pay more, for getting into anything. A\r\nticket for a week, for both of us, to see the people bathe, and dress\r\ntheir hair, and everything, was only half a crown for me, and\r\nfifteenpence for you, my dear! And you may sit, all the time, on the\r\nground of the earth, which is so much cleaner than the seats they make.\r\nCome into this hole, with the rushes on the top--where I dare say some\r\nwild animal has lived--and never mind the people in the waves, my dear.\r\nWhat I want you to be, is a great man, Tommy; a very great man, who may\r\nlook down upon the little ones, and remember (when he has lost his own\r\ndear mother) that he owes all his greatness to her counsel, and high\r\nprinciples.\"\r\n\r\nMy dear mother spoke with such depth of feeling--especially in reference\r\nto her own end--that I had not the least idea what to say, and did not\r\nlike to cry, until I had waited for some more.\r\n\r\n\"School-life is hardening you, my son;\" she said. \"I have known the day,\r\nwhen you would have been crying long ago, at the description of all that\r\nI go through. However, it is all for the best, and my own doing. I must\r\nexpect you to grow up. And grown-up men must never cry. Tommy, you can\r\nhave two bull's-eyes, out of my pocket, if you know where to find them,\r\nwhile I am wiping my poor eyes. They were under my handkerchief right\r\nside down, and the old pair of gloves on the top of them, that I put on\r\nwhen the promenade is over. You have got them, my son? Well, take one at\r\na time, and don't bite them, until I have said a few words. Don't be\r\nafraid, Tommy. I am not going to deliver a lecture, such as nobody ever\r\nthat knows me could expect of me. You will have a great mind, my dear,\r\nas well as five talents of the body that will come to five and twenty,\r\nwhen the woman begins to sweep the house. And with all these great\r\nblessings of the Lord upon you, your first duty is to keep them all to\r\nyourself. That was one reason, why I would not come out, when they made\r\nsuch a fuss about you, the other night. They had no right to come\r\nbetween you and me; and heartily thankful as I felt to them, is it\r\nlikely that I would put up with that sort of thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, mother,\" I could not help saying, \"suppose there had been nobody\r\nthere, when I came down? You were out of sight altogether; and though I\r\nmight not have gone down through the water, if my legs had gone in, they\r\nwould have stuck there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk of such dreadful things, my dear. I am speaking sincerely\r\nout of gratitude. No one has ever accused your poor mother of any\r\ndeficiency in that. But I think, that the least Lady Twentifold could\r\ndo, was to come to church on Sunday, if only to thank the Lord for the\r\nservice she had been enabled to render you. Few ladies have had such a\r\nchance afforded them; but she thinks much more of her fifteen pews. Now,\r\nTommy, if you meet her on the beach, or any of the members of her\r\nfamily, you are not to rush up to them, as if you were under a great\r\nobligation, and make them talk large. You may show yourself; but wait\r\nfor them to accost you, as Mrs. Windsor says. You know what to accost a\r\nperson means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mother, from _costa_, the Latin for a rib. And it often comes in\r\nHomer. 'And thus accosting him in reply spake sovereign Agamemnon.' Old\r\nRum does it like that, nearly always.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, what a clever boy you are! I love to hear a bit of Latin from\r\nyou. But whatever you say to the Twentifold people, you never must speak\r\nof your master as 'Old Rum.' It sounds quite low, and it contains no\r\nlearning. You may speak of Dr. Rumbelow, if you like, and your place of\r\neducation, the _Pantheon_--though why it should have the same name as a\r\nbazaar, I am very much afraid I shall never understand. But mind, more\r\nthan anything else, my son, what I am going to tell you now. You say\r\nthat none of them asked you, on Friday, what was your father's path in\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mother; none of them said a word about it. All they wanted to know\r\nwas about myself. But I'm not sure, I did not tell about Old Rum.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it won't matter much, if you did, my dear. But the boys at school\r\ncall you 'soap,' and 'tallow,' and 'bubbles,' and 'dips,' and a quantity\r\nof things; all of which prove how low they are themselves. Now, we will\r\nnot allow these great people to do that. And the only way to stop them,\r\nis not to let them know private matters, that can be no concern of\r\ntheirs. Above all things, be truthful as the day, my son. Your father is\r\nnot an Admiral; and you must acknowledge that he is not--supposing that\r\nthe question should come up--and if they want to know any more about\r\nhim, which people of any good manners would not, just tell them (in so\r\nmany words) the truth--that your father is a gentleman, the head of his\r\nown firm of merchants in the Metropolis, and invited to dine at the\r\nMansion-house, from his eminence in politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose they should ask about the boiling, mother; and the things\r\nthat we sell, and the smell in the Lane----\"\r\n\r\n\"What a stupe you are! As if you didn't know by this time, after all the\r\nschooling you have had, that in good society nobody knows of anything\r\nthat doesn't smell nice. The highest of them do all that themselves; but\r\nas for talking of it, and in the presence of ladies--why it makes them\r\nfaint. Your mother is of a good family, Tommy; and you get your\r\ndistinguished appearance from her. And though I did marry a Lightbody\r\nfirst, and after his time an Upmore, I have often been told that my\r\nancestors had a knighthood in their family, which makes it improper for\r\na son of mine, to say anything about soap-boiling. Moreover, I will tell\r\nyou, as a very great secret, which you must not say a word about in\r\nMaiden Lane, what your father was saying in his sleep, the other night.\r\nIt was the first night we came down here, and the strange bed, and the\r\nkicking noise the sea makes, and the late dinner, and the Welsh rabbit\r\nto top up with, perhaps interfered with his natural rest; for he has not\r\ntold a word of his dreams for years. He thought he was talking to you,\r\nmy dear, and you were at the top of a ladder, or a tree, so far as I\r\ncould make out his words. 'Tommy, come down,' he said; 'come down,\r\nTommy; and I'll show you where all the money is put, for you to go into\r\nParliament.' And then I suppose that you wouldn't come down, for he\r\nslapped at his leg, where he keeps his money; and he called out\r\nlouder--'They meddle with me! I'll meddle with them, when it comes to a\r\nplum; and let them know who Upmore is. And if I am too old, my son shall\r\ndo it.' And then he got sore, where he knocked himself; for his hand is\r\nheavy, and his veins are large; and he awoke very grumpy, and rubbed his\r\nleg; and I could not get any more out of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Bill Chumps is going into Parliament!\" I cried, being struck by\r\nthis strange coincidence; \"and I should like to go very much, wherever\r\nhe is; and Roly Twentifold is sure to go too; and we ought to do\r\nsomething between us, mother, for the good of the country, and all the\r\npoor people, and to make things fetch more money. I was reading about a\r\ngreat man, the other day----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to hear about any great men, until you are one of them,\r\nTommy. Go and play on the sands, while I rest for an hour; this air does\r\nmake me yawn so. Are you sure you have got your dumbbells in your\r\npockets, and your fisherman's lead round the top of your stomach? Then\r\nwhistle for _Grip_, for there might be Professors down here, for aught\r\nwe know of. And come back, as soon as the London papers are down, if\r\nthere is anything about any of us.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of the weight I had now to carry, for fear of going out to sea\r\nagain, I ran away joyfully down the sands, as they call the gravel where\r\nthe sand should be. At the ring of the steel-whistle which I carried\r\nround my neck, _Grip_ came bounding from the Inn to meet me, and with\r\nmutual confidence we began to poke about, for something to afford a\r\nhunt. Then I heard a voice holloaing out, \"Hi, Tommy!\" and with a long\r\nstride, quite like that of a man, Sir Roland Twentifold came down to me.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I thought you had given us the slip,\" he shouted, for he always\r\nspoke as if he wanted every one to hear; \"I came down with my pony on\r\nSaturday, but I could not see a sign of you. And I did not like to call\r\nat the Inn, because of your mother's bad health, you know. And on\r\nSundays, my mother won't let me go far; because she is religious, and so\r\nam I. There are so few fellows who care for that now, that I stick up\r\nfor it, and mean to do so. I won't have everything turned upside down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care that my _Grip_ doesn't roll you over,\" I exclaimed, for the\r\ndog had no muzzle on; \"I can't always hold him, when he takes a\r\ndislike.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Grip_, come here,\" he said, \"and talk to me. I have got a dozen dogs,\r\nwho could eat you, _Grip_. But if you are good, they shall be good to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at this idea, for _Grip_ could thrash any\r\nthree dogs I knew. But to my astonishment, _Grip_ came up, and wagged\r\nhis tail softly to Sir Roland, and sniffed about him pleasantly, and\r\nthen offered his grisly ears for a loving rub.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be nervous, doggy,\" went on Sir Roland, as if he were talking to\r\nan Italian greyhound; \"you smell rather doggy; but I don't mind that. If\r\nyour master goes for a fly every day, and you swim after him, you'll\r\nsoon be cured.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only fancy,\" I said, as I pulled his tail, that he might not take up\r\nwith a stranger so; \"he had never seen the sea before, any more than I\r\nhad; but the moment he knew I was in your boat, in he dashed, to come\r\nand look after me. And he is not at all a water-dog, as you must know,\r\nhaving such a lot of dogs of your own. He swallowed such a lot of salt\r\nwater, that he could only gurgle, instead of growling, when the sailors\r\npetted him; and I do believe if you had not managed to get hold of his\r\ncollar, with that long stick, he would have been a drowned dog, the same\r\nas I have seen twenty of together, when the wind blows down the\r\nreservoir of the Water-company. Oh, how sad it must be, for their Master\r\nand Mistress. If _Grip_ was to die, I never should get over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a soft you are! Why, you are crying now, with _Grip_ all alive to\r\nlick your face! Such a chap, as you, would never do at Harrow. We should\r\ncall you 'Fanny,' instead of Tommy Upmore. Now, don't be offended. You\r\ncan't expect to be anything but a muff, after going to a private school,\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bill Chumps is not a muff, and he was there six years. If Bill Chumps\r\nheard you talk like that, he'd take you by the back of the neck, and\r\nthrow you over the top of that bathing-waggon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Tommy,\" said Sir Roland, whose nature was truly\r\ngenerous; \"it was cowardly of me to talk like that, when you can't help\r\nyourself, of course. Every fellow should stick up for his own hole. But\r\nwhat Bill Chumps are you talking about? There can't be very many Bill\r\nChumpses, I should think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should rather think not. There is nobody like him. He is gone to\r\nPope's Eye College now, at Oxford, with a scholarship founded by his own\r\nfather, for the benefit of all descendants. And they say he gets on\r\nwonderfully, though everybody cut him, for a week or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what a wonderful thing!\" cried Roly, as he told me immediately\r\nthat I must call him, unless I wanted to get a flyer; \"I was at Oxford,\r\nlast Commemoration-time, to see my cousin, who went up from Harrow, just\r\nat the time when Chumps went up. He is two years older than I am, and a\r\ndecent kind of fellow in his way, but sadly short of what we call _go_;\r\nthough he belongs to a bigger lot than I do. The Earl of Counterpagne is\r\nhis name, as the song says about somebody. And your Chumps, everybody\r\ncalls him Bill Chumps, had pulled him out of Sandford Lasher, at the\r\nvery last moment to save him from croaking. There were other men there,\r\nwho were ready to go in; but Chumps was first, and though he was not a\r\ngreat swimmer, in he jumped, and pulled him up, when he was all but done\r\nfor. Bad luck for me, as some people would say; but splendid luck, as I\r\nthink; for I don't want to go into the House of Lords; and what's the\r\ngood of your own way, unless you make it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was just like Bill,\" I said; \"he never stopped to think, unless\r\nthere was lots of time for it. He means to be a great man, and he will\r\nbe too.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the sort of fellow, I should like to be. I have often thought of\r\nrunning away from home, and the land, and the money, and all that stuff,\r\nand setting up properly on my own account, with two night-gowns, and six\r\nday-shirts. Who can give any cuds to a fellow, who starts with a heap of\r\nmoney round his neck? If it were not for my mother, and little Laura, I\r\nwould have started long ago. Whatever I do, I shall get no credit,\r\nbecause of what those dirty Radicals call my 'enormous social\r\nadvantages.' By the bye, I do hope you're not a Radical, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should rather hope not,\" I said, with grand contempt. \"My father is a\r\nConservative; and so am I. Though I don't pretend yet to know so very\r\nmuch about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the better for that. I will teach you,\" cried Sir Roland. \"I know\r\nall about it, ever since I can remember. And when my cousin went to call\r\nupon Bill Chumps, as he was bound to do after that, the first thing he\r\nsaw was a great card stuck in the corner of the glass above his\r\nchimney-piece, with a baron of beef, and a haunch of mutton, trimmed\r\nwith ribbons at the top, and then 'W. Chumps, butcher,' in big letters,\r\nand a great lot more about meat below, ending with 'House-lamb, when in\r\nseason.' My cousin was surprised, but of course he said nothing about\r\nit, until he knew Chumps well. And then he asked him why; and Chumps\r\nsaid--'just to see whether you were a snob, or not.' And now I tell you,\r\nTommy, that my cousin just opens his door, and shows out any swell, who\r\npretends to patronise his friend, Bill Chumps. But Chumps keeps his\r\ndistance, and does not want them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wonder I never heard anything about it. If butcher Chumps had\r\nheard of it, wouldn't he talk?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't suppose Chumps ever said a word about it. He is just that sort\r\nof fellow, as they say. They wanted to get him a medal; but he would not\r\nhear of it, at any price. I shall make his acquaintance, when I go up;\r\nand I intend to get him into Parliament. And you too, Tommy, as soon as\r\nyou are old enough. Only you must try to grow a bit. You are to come,\r\nand stop at our place, when the Admiral goes back to London.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTWENTIFOLD TOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I had seen the Tower of London,--when our van went to a wharf\r\nclose by,--and even the new City prison, and several magnificent houses\r\nbuilt by brewers, all these were nothing but dirt in my eyes, when they\r\nlit upon \"Twentifold Towers.\" This grand building was too long for a\r\nfar-sighted man to see it all at once, and too high for me to think of\r\nflying over it, and the depth that it went to, below the ground, was\r\nenough to make one giddy. And the number of servants, and the way they\r\ndid things, and the little they thought about money, was amazing.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all this, I was sad in my heart to stop behind, even in\r\nso grand a place, when my father and mother were gone back home. For I\r\nthought of all the corners that I knew so well, and the places in the\r\ncinders, where the wind blew warm, and the holes where you might roast a\r\nbig potato, (if you watched the proper time for clinkering,) and the\r\ngrassy remainders of great green fields, where the lark, after warbling\r\nin the sky so long, shut both his wings, and shot down in silence, to\r\nrun about, and feel the land, where he felt that he had been an egg. And\r\nthen I thought of several fellows, by no means grand in trousers, or in\r\nmanners--such as Joe Grimes, the blacksmith's boy, and Charley Turps,\r\nson of the carpenter--who could enter into my views, and let me into\r\ntheirs, without a bit of language wasted, and who had forgiven me by\r\nthis time, for being what they called a \"Latin Tea-kettle;\" and of whom,\r\nby this time, there could not be one, without a long tale of his own to\r\nunfold, and a long one of mine to feel for. Moreover, I am not ashamed\r\nto own--for the true shame ought to be upon the other side--that fat\r\nPolly Windsor had promised now, for more than five years, to be my\r\nbride; and I wanted to amaze her with a true account of the things I saw\r\nthe girls do down here. And as I thought of all these delights, I did\r\nnot care twopence to be a great man, if my greatness would rob me of\r\nhalf of them.\r\n\r\nBut before going further, I am bound to stop, and do justice to a man,\r\nwho was not so very great--any more than I shall ever be--but that which\r\nis tenfold rarer now, a truthful, honest, and courageous man.\r\n\r\nIt was not the loss of two Sunday hats, which changed my father's\r\npolitics, but the running away of the man who stole them, without\r\nleaving his name in the lining. My father began to look beneath the\r\nsurface, having taken all he heard on trust, till now; and as soon as he\r\nhit upon facts, he found that he must not find fault with this man, for\r\nrunning. For now, he was enabled to perceive that the essence of the\r\nLiberal is--to run. To run with the current of opinion first, judging\r\nfrom the froth which way it goes; and to run away from his own\r\nprinciples next, because they are bad, while his conscience still is\r\ngood; to run, with all speed, from the voice of reason; and above all\r\nto put his best foot foremost, in running for his pocket from the\r\nenemies of England.\r\n\r\nHaving set his mind, and heart, against that style of going, my father\r\ndiscovered that his own life grew more honest, and open, in little\r\ndealings, from a firmer standard in larger ones. And though he was here,\r\nto some extent, with a view to smooth the way for a Government contract,\r\nand test the true value of Billy Barlow's tricks; the sterling weight of\r\nhis principles never fell into the scale of his interests.\r\n\r\n\"How Tommy may turn out, is more than I can say,\" he exclaimed, after\r\nreading Lady Twentifold's letter, in which she apologised most\r\ngracefully, for the liberty she had been tempted to take, in begging\r\nthem to spare their dear bright boy, for a few days' visit at the\r\nTowers, though she had been prevented by absence from calling upon\r\nAdmiral, and Mrs. Upmore; but her dear son, Roland, who would bring this\r\nnote, would explain that she had only just been told of their sudden\r\nreturn to London, etc., etc., all most pleasing, and put in the kindest\r\nand prettiest way--\"whether Tommy will stick to the business,\" said\r\nfather, \"and make it pay better than his poor governor--as he calls me,\r\nwhen my back is turned--and be able, by the time he is fifty years old,\r\nto pay his way into Parliament, and represent the boiling interest,\r\nwhich is abominably treated there--it lies in the doom of the future to\r\nbring forth. But after all the years, I have lived in the world,\r\nalthough I have only been on committees, and never more than\r\nvice-chairman, I know too well what Statesmen are. If they can fish up,\r\nagainst one another, so much as the passing of a bad penny-piece, when\r\nthey were at school together, the man at the top of the tree will never\r\nhear the last of it. If our Tommy goes on, as his schooling shows, he\r\nmay happen to be heard of by and by, though there's nothing wonderful\r\nabout him yet, except these lies about his flying; and none the Rads, if\r\nhe turns out a Tory, and none of the Tories, if he turns into a Rad,\r\nshall ever be able to say of him then, that he started under false\r\ncolours. Hand me one of my invoice-slips; there are three, or four, over\r\nin that pocket-book. I'll be as straight-forward as Bill Chumps was,\r\nwith the Earl, according to Tommy's tale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what are you going to do?\" cried mother; \"after all the lecture I\r\ngave Tommy, and all I have done on the sands, oh dear! It is flying in\r\nthe face of Providence.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord--if you mean Him by 'Providence'--loves the men He has made,\r\nto tell the truth; and the women likewise, to the extent of their\r\npowers, though not so much insisted on. Sir Roland is gone to the beach\r\nwith his pony, to wait for your answer, I believe. Tommy shall take it\r\ndown to him. Read it as you go, my son, and then put it in this\r\nenvelope.\"\r\n\r\nWhat I had to read, and deliver, to my affable, yet rather arrogant\r\nfriend, ran as nearly as may be to this effect:\r\n\r\n\"Bucephalus Upmore, Son and Successor to the late S. Upmore, of the\r\nold-established Boiling and Refining Works, etc., etc.,\" in large type;\r\nand then in good round hand this--\"presents his respects to Lady\r\nTowers-Twentifold, and begs to thank her, on behalf of self and wife,\r\nfor your kind invitation to our son, Thomas. The same is a good boy,\r\nand well brought up, so far as can be seen to; and his schoolmaster\r\nready to answer for him, and will never do any disgrace to the business,\r\nunless he gets into bad company. But from experience of the world, B. U.\r\nexpects to hear no more from your ladyship, as soon as she knows all\r\nabout our Tommy. He can't fly, no more than his father can, and he goes\r\nfrom Happystowe by Railway-bus, as soon as all of us has had our dinner,\r\nwhich was a great mistake in coming down, to start with breakfast only.\r\nOffering your ladyship all good wishes, from a happy stay here at\r\nHappystowe, remain your obedient servant to command, Bucephalus Upmore,\r\nof address above.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it went very much against my grain, to deliver this letter to my\r\nfriend Roly--for my friend I may call him, by this time, after the\r\nthings we had done, and enjoyed, together. For I had taught him several\r\ningenuities, such as a London boy can show, of clogging the wheels of\r\nthe bathing-waggons, and pouring a little tar into the shoes left on the\r\nbeach by paddlers, and other devices even better; so that we had made\r\nrare larks together, and he would find it dull without me.\r\n\r\n\"All up now,\" I cried, as he came, at full gallop, for his answer; \"the\r\ngovernor has done for all my chance of ever going up to your place. Look\r\nwhat he says! And not half of it is true. We are boilers; but we don't\r\nmake dips like that.\"\r\n\r\nSir Roland was looking at a bunch of rushlights, very well done, but\r\nmuch older than I was--for night-lights had long superseded them--and he\r\ncould not help laughing, though he tried severely. And I had talked\r\nrather largely about commerce, once or twice, when we got into abstract\r\nsubjects, as we used, when the last chance of a lark was gone. \"He has\r\ndone it on purpose,\" I said, \"to pull me down. Why, he might have used\r\nhis new bill-heading, quite like a picture you can look at, with a palm\r\nin the middle, and an olive full of oil, and two great cannons made into\r\ncandlesticks, for his Virgin-honey patent that burns like bees, and\r\nland-steam on one side, and sea-steam on the other, to show the extent\r\nof his transactions. Tell my dear lady, that wretched old thing came\r\ndown, I am sure, from my grandfather. Oh, what was mother about, to let\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Admirals are wilful men,\" replied Sir Roland, seriously regarding that\r\nvile bill-head; \"and they won't always listen to their wives.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I ever call him an Admiral? Did he ever say he was an Admiral? Did\r\nany of us ever tell a single lie, about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, my boy, don't be excited,\" Sir Roland said, as gravely as he\r\ncould contrive; \"I have seen a great deal of the world, though I am\r\nyoung; and of course I was aware, from the very first moment, that you\r\nbelonged to the commercial classes; which (as I read the other day) are\r\nrapidly becoming the mainstay of England, against the wild inrush of\r\nanarchy. You know, I told you that, the other night, after we had cut\r\nthe mooring-ropes of the three machines of the Radical. Very well, if\r\nyou are in trade, where is the difference between big and little? The\r\nretail dealers are the loftier class, because they make less profit. I\r\nhave thought about these things, for several hours, and I am not misled\r\nby what I read. And the conclusion I have come to is just this--that\r\nthe retail man is of a higher class, in every way, than the wholesale\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I said, as firmly as I could say it, and proudly repressing all\r\ntendency to tears, \"we are wholesale, wholesale all over. Even father\r\ncan't say less than that, when he wants to run down all of us, to keep\r\nour ideas from spending.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Tommy, what you are,\" Sir Roland replied, as he buttoned up\r\nhis coat; \"you may be a gentleman, in any calling, if you don't run\r\nother people down. That is the surest sign of a cad; and I've never seen\r\nany sign of that, in you. Now, I must be off, like the wind, for home;\r\nbecause I am resolved to come back in time for you. We shall want you,\r\nall the more for this, friend Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't come now, if you ask me;\" I called out, as he stuck his legs\r\nround his pony; \"because I shall know, you are thinking about the dips.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep out your things from the rest, and have them ready. The\r\nStation-bus goes at two o'clock. I shall come with a light trap, at\r\nhalf-past one; and nobody will ask you about coming.\"\r\n\r\nBy this he meant, that I should have to come _nolens volens_, as we said\r\nat school; but having more faith in my father's knowledge of the world,\r\nI did not expect it. However, with mother's consent, my clothes and\r\nbooks were packed in my own little box, while father laughed, and said,\r\n\"Please yourselves; so long as they go safe to Maiden Lane.\" But soon he\r\nwas obliged to confess his mistake, and let mother triumph over him. For\r\nwhile the bus was standing at the door, and our luggage was going down\r\nheavily, and my father, in the window, was taking his last look at a\r\ngreat ship in the distance, a quick light sound of wheels came up the\r\nstaircase; and running out that way, I saw a horse with his forehead\r\npulled up right against the forehead of the bus-horse, as if they were\r\nplaying at \"conquerors.\" The new horse was beautiful, and full of pride;\r\nand the bus-horse looked at him, with mild reproach, between his shabby\r\nblinkers, as if he were saying--\"Wait till you grow old, and you won't\r\ncome flustering a poor horse-brother, with your dash, and frippery, and\r\nself-conceit.\"\r\n\r\n\"This for you, ma'am!\" cried the Boots to my mother, running up as if he\r\nhad no breath left, from the labour and peril of our boxes, \"and young\r\nMaster Roland, ma'am,--please, ma'am, his compliments, and he is waiting\r\nfor Master Tommy, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most polite, and most kind of her ladyship indeed! Bucephalus, what do\r\nyou say to that? Which of us understands good society best; if you\r\nplease, my dear, if you please to answer me? What did I tell you, on\r\nMonday week, Tommy, about what had been in my family? It requires that\r\nkind of preparation, to understand these things, my dear. But he can't\r\ngo, with less than a guinea in his pocket. Pull out, Mr. Upmore.\"\r\n\r\nMy father was obliged to do all that, except that he took five per\r\ncent., as the style of the age is, from the beauty of the guinea; and\r\ndear mother, (bearing a tear of pride in one eye, and a bigger one of\r\nsorrow in the other) went to the bag that her purse was locked in, and\r\ngot out half a sovereign, and looked at it.\r\n\r\n\"Don't change it, Tommy,\" she said, \"until you don't know at all how to\r\nhelp it. You are going to be with great people, my pet, and you will\r\nhave to do things handsomely. But they won't expect a little boy, like\r\nyou, to stand treat, or tip the maids, or anything of that sort; and if\r\nyou bring this back to me, you shall have it all to go to school with.\"\r\n\r\nThus, with more money than I ever had before, or ever could have dreamed\r\nof owning, I sat by the side of Sir Roland Towers-Twentifold, and\r\nwatched him drive his horse, which he did, as he did everything, with\r\nthe greatest vigour, and capacity. We seemed to go as fast as I could\r\nfly--with science, and a strong breeze after me--and _Grip_ had to use\r\nall his legs to keep up; and I looked back sadly at the poor old bus,\r\nwith father, and his German pipe, upon the box, and mother with her\r\nhandkerchief waving from the window; and Roly would not stop, for me to\r\nsay another word to them.\r\n\r\nNow, I need not have told all this, except for the mean charge brought\r\nagainst me, that I got into Twentifold Towers, and thence into public\r\nlife, by trickery, by false pretences, and imposture on the part of all\r\nof us, having conspired among strangers to present my father as an\r\nAdmiral--\"The Admiral of the Fleet-ditch\" those unprincipled jokers have\r\ndared to call him, because the old Fleet-stream comes down our valley.\r\nPossibly, if the general public (and especially the Inn) at Happystowe\r\nhad not endowed my father with that Naval rank, and therein confirmed\r\nhim (in spite of all protest), I might not have got my first invitation,\r\nwhich he cast away like a true Briton. But I leave the world at large,\r\nto judge the merits; for I have always found it waste of time to reason\r\nwith malicious persons.\r\n\r\nHave I patience to think of such small fry, when I speak of the\r\ngreatness of everything at Twentifold Towers, and for miles around? Not\r\na cold, rigid, and stuck-up greatness, such as you must fold your arms\r\nto look at, and thank the Lord, in private, that you are not like it;\r\nbut a warmth of beauty and of kindness shed abroad, which set me on the\r\nflutter, when I came to feel it; though my mother had provided me with\r\nfifteen pounds of lead, in the hollow at the bottom of my chest. But, at\r\nfirst I was frightened, as you may suppose, and kept asking myself what\r\ngood would be my best clothes, even to play in, at such a place? Then\r\nLady Twentifold came out, and kissed me, and looked at the tears in my\r\neyes with love--because she had lost a little boy like me--and my heart\r\nwent to her, so that I saw nothing of the height or size of anything, so\r\nlong as I could see her, and think about her, and feel how good she was\r\nto me.\r\n\r\n\"You will see a great friend, by and by,\" she said. \"What a\r\ndistinguished boy you are, to have formed such lofty friendships! And\r\nchiefly because of your bodily gift of weighing less than you ought to\r\nweigh. Why, a boy, with the mind of a Shakespeare to come, might pour\r\nforth poem after poem, and nobody care to inquire into him. Even\r\nProfessor Megalow, universal as he is, might never even chance to hear\r\nof him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, is it Professor Megalow?\" I asked, with glad excitement. \"I am not\r\nafraid of any place, when I know that he is near it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ariel, how unkind of you! If we ill-treat you, spread your wings. But I\r\nhave not even seen your great friend yet. He will not be here, till\r\ndinner-time. He is carving, what he cares for more than anything we can\r\noffer--a poor dead whale at Crowton Naze.\"\r\n\r\nNow, behold the reward of virtue--for in the present state of this\r\nwicked world, it may be taken as a high reward to escape the pains of\r\npunishment! If I had gone, as an Admiral's son, to Twentifold Towers,\r\nhow should I have looked, when Professor Megalow, knowing all about us,\r\nand having smelled our works afar--which probably helped to draw him\r\ntowards us, for congenial nutriment--now came up, with that large sweet\r\nsmile, which spreads all over his face and body, and said, \"My dear\r\nlittle friend, how are you?\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first time I ever beheld him in evening dress, and he\r\nastonished me; because a very old hat had always been part of his\r\nequipment. He may have contrived to leave it somewhere, for he cannot\r\nhave come with a good one. Neither was that the only thing in his\r\npresent appearance amazing; for he had put himself into a black velvet\r\ncoat, as the smartest thing he could find in his trunk; and grand, I can\r\ntell you, he looked in it. From daybreak until he had to go and wash, he\r\nhad been at work at that great whale, not only directing a mob of\r\nclod-hoppers, how to hop about upon a whale, but also, with his own iron\r\narms, performing all work that called for skill and strength. And yet,\r\nthere was no sign of work about him; neither any talk, or thought of\r\nwork; and he would not be made (though Lady Twentifold tried her best to\r\nmake him, and so did Sir Roland with downright \"fishers\"--as we used to\r\ncall tapping a master at school, to do a hard sentence for us), by no\r\nmanner of means could he be brought to speak, as if he wanted to be\r\nlistened to.\r\n\r\nThis was the very thing that I had known, ever since he first came,\r\nwith the other four Professors. Of them there was not one that would\r\nleave off talking, for the sake of the public, or of one another, or\r\neven for his own sake; neither would they breathe enough, to let another\r\nvoice in; but the measure of every man's mind was his lungs. And to\r\ncountervail this, it has been laid down by nature, that the men who have\r\nsomething to say don't say it.\r\n\r\nBut, though this Professor, in his leisure time, would play round the\r\nedge of his learning, rather than plunge other people into it; it was\r\nquite impossible for even me (a careless, and light-headed boy) to be\r\nwith him, without learning something. And my firm belief is, that\r\nalthough I know very little, at this time of writing, whatever I have\r\nlearned of larger things than little human creatures, was gained upon\r\nthat whale, where the great mind came to study the great body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nWHALEBONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dear mother always says, and allows no contradiction about it, that\r\nthis whale, being all bones and blubber, had no right whatever to come\r\nashore there, and to set me against my father's trade. She declares that\r\nall science is full of smells, a thousand times worse than we make; and\r\nthat all their fuss about drains is just, that they may get themselves\r\ncleaned up, for nothing. All the people before her, in generation, lived\r\nto be ninety, without any drain upon them; except her own parents, and\r\nwhy did they die? Why, because there was a drain carried through their\r\ngarden; and the smell came in, and choked them!\r\n\r\nIn support of this view, there is much to be said; and according to my\r\nown experience, ten people are killed, by the making and opening of\r\ndrains, for one who can hope in his lungs, that he breathes better air\r\nwhen near them. Nature has designed the human race, to stand well apart\r\non the face of the earth, and not huddle up in hillocks, as the emmets\r\ndo; and their certainty of fighting, when they get too thick, shows\r\nthis, without further argument. And another thing that proves it, is the\r\nfact, that when they clot together, they make drains; which destroy\r\neverybody who is fond of them. My father was as well as any man could\r\nbe, till what they call \"sanitary engineering\" broke his constitution;\r\nand the lively smells, that our works had scattered, were bottled into\r\ndeadly poison.\r\n\r\nAs yet, I was too young to understand such matters, or even to give a\r\nthought to them; but the standing I took upon that whale, and the\r\npleasure with which I went into him, did a great deal for me, in the\r\ngood opinion (than which there could be no better one) of the kind\r\nProfessor Megalow. Roly would not come anigh our operations, after one\r\nexperiment, and a short one; but I, with my quickness and lightness of\r\ntread, was of some little service, I do believe, in the cause of\r\nharmless science. I learned all the names of the Professor's tools, and\r\ncould bring them to him, without wanting any ladder; and any little cut,\r\nthat could be made without much strength, I could make under his\r\ndirection, while he was at the bigger work. He did not attempt to get\r\nall the skeleton, greatly as he longed to do so; for this was no whale\r\nto be found every day, but one who had no business here; and his name\r\nwas something like chocolate. The Professor sighed heavily; as his bones\r\ngrew more, and more, attractive, and hung over us, like a great arbour\r\ndrooped with a fine lot of creepers; but he knew, long since, what it is\r\nto depend, for money, upon the Government. Lucky would he be, to get the\r\nhead, and fins, and tail, and some odds and ends, if a dozen rival\r\nclaimants would let him have so much.\r\n\r\n\"That whale is mine,\" said Lady Twentifold; \"he chose to land on my\r\nproperty, and I give him to Professor Megalow; not to the Government,\r\nthat won't pay a penny, but to the Professor, to put in his own garden.\"\r\n\r\n\"That whale belongs to me,\" said the local receiver of the droits of the\r\nAdmiralty; \"the foreshore is vested in the Crown, and the Admiralty\r\nrepresents the Crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clearly, there can be no question,\" said the man, who represented the\r\nTrinity House, \"that the whale is ours; and we mean to have him.\"\r\n\r\nThen there came a lawyer, employed by the crew of the boat who had first\r\nharpooned him; and another retained by the men who stuck him last; and\r\nanother by a captain who had espied him go down; and another by a\r\nfisherman who headed him ashore; and one by the Coast-guard, who had\r\nseen him stranded first; and two by a man who had foretold the weather,\r\nand kept his ropes ready, though he never had to use them. But, in spite\r\nof all these claims, the men who got him, or at least got all the best\r\nof him, were the men who made no claim at all; but came down, with carts\r\nand casks, and helped themselves.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I thought it not only unjust, but stupid, that I should\r\nwork so hard, and establish a right, as the Professor said, to a very\r\nconsiderable share of blubber, and my father not get a pailful! I wrote\r\nto him, beginning with a line of Latin--not so much to accredit my\r\nlearning, as to make him pay proper attention,--and after that, I said\r\nthat here there was any quantity of stuff, such as he could never get,\r\nfor love or money, (unadulterated), and it was to be had, for the\r\nasking; or rather for taking, without asking. I told him, how it shone\r\nin the sun, and held together, and took different colours as you looked\r\nat it; and I was sure that he would make his fortune; because he could\r\nget it for nothing, and make it mix up into everything. And I was\r\ncertain of stirring him up, and getting five shillings, by return of\r\npost, when I added--\"Everybody says that Mr. Barlow, of Happystowe\r\ncandle-works, will make a thousand pounds, out of this poor whale, that\r\nis being cut up by me, and Professor Megalow.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother was kind enough to answer; but without any sort of reference\r\nto business. My father took no more notice of my letter, than if I had\r\nsent him a bark of _Grip's_, instead of a pill-box, filled with sample\r\nfrom my own knife, at a place where the blubber was more than fourteen\r\ninches thick. And this goes some way to prove, that his mind was already\r\non the rise above the smaller details, and getting into larger views of\r\nlofty subjects, such as chemical researches, political oeconomy, and\r\neven Government contracts. And it turned out afterwards, as you will\r\nsee, that he was right in attending to these wholesale sizes.\r\n\r\nDear mother sent me half a crown in stamps, for fear of my changing the\r\nhalf-sovereign, and related a beautiful dream she had enjoyed, about me,\r\nand Professor Megalow, standing on the whale, with our wings spread out.\r\n\"She knew, from all the pictures, what a whale was like, and hoped (for\r\nthe sake of my new overcoat) I kept out of the way, when he spouted.\r\nAnd, if I could bring a piece of genuine bone, for the sake of her\r\nstays, it would be such a comfort, for everything now was adulterated;\r\nand their want of spring ran into her. And then, she added, that she\r\ndid not think I had better write a line to Polly Windsor (though she\r\nsent me a message from Polly, to say that I ought to have done it long\r\nago), because it was not so well to go too far, and create expectations,\r\nwhich might come to nothing. Her own opinion was, that after my last\r\nfly, and the high society it led to, there was no telling what might be\r\nbefore me, in the family way, and otherwise. But above all, she begged\r\nme, for her dear sake, not to trust to the grand dinners I got here, and\r\ntheir turtle and their venison, and their Aspic jelly, but to keep the\r\ntongue of the buckle of my lead-belt in the third hole from the end;\r\nfor, if the wind took me, out over the sea, what could Lady Twentifold,\r\nand the whale, and even the great Professor do?\"\r\n\r\nI was quite content to save fingers from pen, in the direction of Polly\r\nWindsor. Polly was very well in her way; when she chose to be pleased,\r\nand look pretty. Moreover, she was a very well-grown girl, with broad\r\nshoulders, and big arms, and long brown hair, and her feet so truly a\r\npair, that she never could tell her right shoe from her left. And from\r\nher mother she had inherited so much strength of dignity, that, if I\r\nwent to kiss her, when the mood was not in liking, or if she saw me\r\ntrying it with any of her enemies, she would take me up with one hand,\r\nand lay me on the cinders. But I must not say too much of that; or Sir\r\nWilliam Chumps will be down upon me.\r\n\r\nWe had promised to marry one another; ever since she had her first pink\r\nslips, and I went into trousers; but I never vowed not to speak to any\r\nother girl, nor to let her box my ears, and say \"thank you, dear;\" as\r\nshe seemed to believe that I had done. And surely, it is no great\r\nreproach upon me, that now, in this busy time, I never thought about\r\nher, unless I got something very good to suck, and wished that she were\r\nthere to have a bit. For it must be understood, that Professor Megalow,\r\ncould not do a good stroke of work without me, according to the very\r\nbest of my belief; and as he was lodging at Crowton Naze, which was more\r\nthan three miles from the Towers, and as he must get to work, the moment\r\nthat the sunlight came over the sea into the wattles of the whale, there\r\nwas no help for it, but that I must be up, by the crow of a cock, who\r\nlived under my window; for not a serving man, or ruling woman, at the\r\nTowers, would take sixpence a day, to get up so soon. Sir Roland called\r\nme a confounded fool, and said that I came there to play, and not to\r\nwork; and even Lady Twentifold was vexed with me. But, like everybody\r\nelse, she fell under the enchantment of the Professor's eyes, and smile.\r\nAnd I did hear my lady's favourite maid declaring to her cousin, who had\r\nto make my bed, that \"you should have seen my lady's face, when she was\r\ntold, by a friend who pretended to know all about him, that the\r\nProfessor had been married, for several years.\"\r\n\r\nAt any rate, he worked as hard, as if he had a large small family to\r\nkeep; and I was told afterwards, and can well believe (because he was\r\nunder the Government) that he would have been paid, more than twice as\r\nmuch, if he had done less than half the work. But neither of us gave a\r\nthought to that. Our object was to walk off with the whale, or so much\r\nof him as was moveable; before the twelve lawyers, who were hard at\r\nwork, could get an order from the Courts, to stop us. And luckily, this\r\nwas the season of the year, when the law (like a Python) retires for\r\nthree months, to digest its swallowings. Moreover, when a boat's crew of\r\npeople, (who care for the law, about as much as science does) that is to\r\nsay, blunt fishermen came with intention of landing at high water, and\r\nstorming the whale, who was well drawn up,--even the Professor could not\r\nhave stopped them (though Lady Twentifold's bailiff was there, to back\r\nhim up, through thick and thin), if once those fellows could have\r\nlanded. By saying to _Grip_ \"have a care, my boy,\" I was able to do a\r\ngood turn to our cause; for he knew a gun better than I did, and feared\r\nno other thing on earth, but that. One look into the boat convinced him\r\nthat these rogues had got no fire-arms; and as soon as he had knocked\r\nover two, who desired to land, the rest held parley.\r\n\r\n\"Our coast-guard will be withdrawn, next week,\" the Professor assured\r\nthem, in his kind and solid way; and whether they misunderstood his\r\nmeaning, and believed the Preventive men to be in possession, or whether\r\nthey were glad of some good reason for withdrawal; at any rate they\r\nwithdrew as promptly, as every one of English race does now, when it\r\nmight prove troublesome to go on. Moreover, they showed a grand contempt\r\nfor us; which the mere act of running away exhibits. And in all\r\nprobability they were wise; for _Grip_ had struck back upon ancestral\r\nqualities, as some few Englishmen do, even yet. By slow, and solid\r\nholding of his own, he had thrashed all the Twentifold Tower dogs, every\r\none of whom was to have eaten him; and now he was living on whalebone,\r\nand every muscle was as hard as wire. If mental analogy counts for\r\naught, against low physical resemblance, _Grip_ was far more akin to the\r\nEnglish race, than the present generation is.\r\n\r\nThe Professor was delighted with all these works; and, as soon as we had\r\nfinished, and packed up the results, he laid his hand upon my head. Upon\r\nhis own, he had a velvet cap; and the whole of his face was one sweet\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" he said, looking steadfastly at me, and swinging a little from\r\nside to side, for he always stood with his head well back, and his heels\r\na trifle forward; \"what a help you have been, my dear little Tommy--a\r\ntruly strongsiding champion! Now, before I go, to see your good works\r\nstowed away in our dark recesses, tell me what I can do for you, to show\r\nthe gratitude of the nation.\" He was fond of talking in this style,\r\nmaking small things great, and great things small.\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir,\" I said, after thinking awhile, for I believed that\r\nhe could do anything; \"I should be so glad, if you could stop me, from\r\nhaving to go up in the air so.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Megalow's bright smile changed into a smile of sadness. He\r\nbegan to rub his well-established nose, in the fork of his finger and\r\nthumb; and then he whistled, and put his hands into his trouser pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, sir, you can, if you like;\" I said, taking hold of one thumb,\r\nwhich he had left out; \"there is nothing of the things that can be done,\r\nthat you can't do, when you like, sir. I only want to be able to take\r\noff this lead, that makes me blue all round, and to leave these heavy\r\nthings behind; and get to feel the ground under my feet go firm; as it\r\nseems to do, with everybody else but me. I have longed so often to ask\r\nyou, sir; but I did not like, until you asked me. Oh, Sir\r\nMegalo-micro-sauros, do try to help me, if I have helped you.\"\r\n\r\nHe had told me to call him \"Micro-sauros\" once, when I stuck fast with\r\nhis proper name,--\"for our origin now is established, my Tommy; and yet,\r\nwe may modify our pedigrees. My proclivities show me to be devolved, in\r\na very degenerate, and underfed form, from the mighty race of Saurians.\"\r\nAnd as cause, and effect, interlace each other, he spent his life, in\r\ndissecting his ancestors.\r\n\r\n\"Thomas,\" he said now, for whenever he spoke in a very solid vein, he\r\ncalled me that; \"Thomas, my boy, be contented with that, which has been\r\nordained concerning you. Yours is not the only instance of what our\r\nfriends call _Meiocatobarysm_; the meaning of which you have Greek\r\nenough now, as well as experience enough to know. The form of life, in\r\nwhich you find yourself, is perhaps the happiest among all, with which\r\nwe are as yet acquainted--to wit, that of an English boy, of the middle\r\nclass, well-fed, well-taught, well-played (if I may be allowed the\r\nexpression), dressed, quite as well as he cares to be, and walking about\r\nat his leisure, with an eye down the manifold vistas of mischief. In a\r\nfew years, Thomas will have changed all that. He will find himself bound\r\nto pay rates, and taxes, and never know when he has paid them right; to\r\ngo to his office, with a compressor on his head, and measure his words,\r\nlike poison; to doubt his very oldest friends, and be hearty with people\r\nhe can't bear the sight of; and to go home at night, with the certainty\r\nthat one run of bad luck may ruin him. Thomas, be happy while you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir,\" I answered; \"how can I be happy, when everybody expects me\r\nto go up? No one else, in the world, is expected to go up; because he\r\ncouldn't do it, if he tried. And I can't go up, more than once in a way;\r\neven if my mother would allow me. And yet, I am always getting blamed,\r\nby a number of people, for not going up. Even Roly is down upon me now,\r\nto do it; and because I won't try, but keep working at the whale, he\r\nseems to be getting tired of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, that is sad; and yet a natural result. To my far less remarkable\r\nself, it has happened; when kind friends expected me to rise too fast.\r\nReserve yourself, Tommy; and preserve your self-respect. But would you\r\nbe really glad, my boy, to lose this special gift of yours? Remember,\r\nthat if you do, you cease to attract any public attention--doubtful\r\nbenefit as that may be. Do you really wish, to be unable to pirouette in\r\nthe air again?\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Megalow, in the kindest manner, put both hands on my\r\nshoulders, and fixed his very large clear eyes on mine. It was hopeless\r\nfor any one, looked at thus, to tell a lie; neither was my nature that.\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir,\" I said, \"there is nothing I like better, than to\r\nbe taken for a wonder of the world, and to read a whole column in the\r\nNewspapers about me, beginning with 'Unparalleled phenomenon.' But what\r\nI can't bear is, to be always bothered to do it, for people to look at;\r\nand to be laughed at, as if I were a rogue, or else a curmudgeon, when I\r\ndon't go up, to order. Sometimes, I have been tempted to pull my\r\nweights off--but I promised my mother, that I never would do that. And\r\nyou know, sir, that I can only go up, now and then; and always, when I\r\ndon't want to do it. And when I come down again, I am so stupid; and my\r\nhead goes round, for hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"The natural result of anything counter to the ordinary laws of earth.\r\nHave you anything more to explain, concerning your wishes, so far as you\r\nknow them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, except that I should like once, to go up, if it was only as\r\nhigh as his hat, when my father was there, to see me do it. Because he\r\nis so cock-sure that I can't do it; and he calls it nothing but a pack\r\nof lies. And, somehow or other, I assure you, sir, I am just like a lump\r\nof lead, when father is looking at me.\"\r\n\r\n\"A common complaint of the _Mediums_, Tommy, of the effect incredulity\r\nhas on them. But, my dear little anthropic nautilus, I can do nothing,\r\neither to make, or mar your excursions over my own head. As I have told\r\nyou before, there is nothing exceptional in your formation; only it\r\nhappens, that your bodily contour is exactly such as to promote the\r\ntendencies of your specific levity. Do you understand me, noble volant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I think that I do a little; but not very clearly, until I\r\nget older. Bodily contour means the turning of my body, when I go up;\r\ndoesn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Tommy, no. It means physical outline; if that is any clearer to\r\nyou. You give me a lesson in lucidity, as the cant of the day calls\r\nclearness. To put what I mean, into the vulgar tongue--which is the\r\nleast vulgar of all just now--your outward shape is especially fitted,\r\nto help the lightness of your material, in conquering the power of\r\ngravitation. Your chest is very large, and can be much expanded; your\r\nhead is rather small, and of little substance, but endowed with a mass\r\nof curls, which take the wind, like a mop being trundled; your feet are\r\nvery hollow and receive the air; and the palms of your hands are\r\nconcave. Above all, your stomach, my dear little friend, or rather your\r\nhypogastrium, has a curve, which requires continual attention, in the\r\nway of aliment. If neglected, this lends itself at once to inferior\r\npressure. But with all these qualifications, Tommy, you might defy the\r\nbreezes, if you only had a stable mind, and bones a little more like\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Professor had goodly bones of his own, as behoves a great\r\nosteologist; whereas mine are very small, and slight, and it takes some\r\ntime to find them. But I saw no way to increase their size; and before I\r\ncould ask, if such there were, Sir Roland came cantering up, and behind\r\nhim appeared his mother, in a pony-carriage, together with her lovely\r\nchild, Miss Laura.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how we shall miss you!\" exclaimed my dear lady--as I was allowed to\r\ncall her--\"Professor Megalow, if I establish my right to the residue of\r\nthat whale, I shall have it preserved, and a gallery made, in gratitude\r\nfor all that we have learned from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heartily hope that you will,\" he replied, gracefully lifting his\r\nvelvet cap, as he always did at a compliment; \"then there will be some\r\nexcuse, for me to come down, and have another carve at him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor,\" cried Sir Roland, who was always wanting something; \"there\r\nis one thing that you must do, before you go, for the finishing touch\r\nto our gratitude. You must send Tommy up, in this nice quiet reach,\r\nwithout any fellow here to shoot at him; and we'll tie this kite-string\r\nto his belt, after we have taken the lead out; to make sure of his not\r\ndrifting out to sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, and I, are very warm allies,\" my great friend answered gravely;\r\n\"and unless you behave most respectfully to him, I shall tie the\r\nkite-string to you, and with her ladyship's permission, send up you.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a very fine moment for me, who have been compelled by my\r\npeculiar case, to keep such a sharp look-out, what all the people around\r\nme are thinking of. In every condition of things, even my best friends\r\nhave always considered it a nice little piece of excitement, and a\r\npleasure entirely due to them, that I should go up, and encounter all\r\nrisk, while they remained below, with the heartiest wishes for my safe\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nSir Roland Towers-Twentifold looked at the Professor, as if to say, at\r\nfirst, \"You could not do it, if you tried.\" The Professor regarded him,\r\nwith earnest sadness, as much as to say--\"Don't make me try; because it\r\nmight be so bad for you.\" Then Roly, in doubt and alarm, glanced towards\r\nhis mother; who had said that he knew no fear. Her eyes were saddened\r\nwith a gleam of tears, for she had long made up her mind, that the great\r\nProfessor could do anything permitted by the laws of England. Yet\r\nhonour, and fine sentiment, forbade her to forbid, that her son should\r\ndo a thing, which he had urged a friend to do. The wise man enjoyed the\r\nsituation for a moment; then perceived that it was painful to kind and\r\ngood friends, and at once relieved them.\r\n\r\n\"I withdraw my proposal, which was rashly made;\" he said to Lady\r\nTwentifold, with that wonderful mixture of nod and wink, which had\r\nneither nod in it, nor wink, perceptible, and yet conveyed the force of\r\nboth; \"I am truly glad, that I did not give your dauntless son time to\r\naccept my offer. Perhaps it would have puzzled me, if he had. Especially\r\nas my train will be due in an hour, and the drive to the Station takes\r\nforty minutes. Is there any gratitude, in the sons of men? If there be,\r\nhow little time have I left to express it--and yet the wisest plan; for\r\nno length of time would suffice me!\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted her white hand to his lips, in the gallant manner, which\r\nbecame him well; and my dear lady bowed over it, and turned to her\r\ncarriage, with a little sigh, which conveyed to the ponies--if they\r\nunderstood their mistress--that it was through no default of hers, that\r\nthey never would be guided by a strong male hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nA SILLY PAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have often been taunted, by people who know nothing (multiplied into a\r\nmillion fibs) about me, that my mind is as volatile as my body, and goes\r\nabout, in an unsettled manner, for want of the leaden belt, which\r\nmotherly care so long kept round my stomach. It is equally needless, and\r\nuseless, to present reason to such irrationals; and I try to be proud,\r\nin my loftier moments, of affording them amusement, which amuses me.\r\n\r\nBut, to reasonable persons, who can hearken to a thing, and take it into\r\ncommon sense, and weigh it--whenever it concerns their own affairs\r\nenough--to these (if any) I would simply say, \"follow my own history of\r\nmy own acts, and judge, by my own account, of what nobody else can know\r\nso well.\" And any one, proceeding upon this fair principle, will find\r\nmore to approve than to condemn in me, however much I may tell against\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nHoping that fair-play will prevail--as it generally does in the end--I\r\nconfess, that at this very tender age of fifteen, I proved for the rest\r\nof my holidays, untrue to the image of Polly Windsor. Polly was not\r\nthere; and even if she had been, how would she have looked, I should\r\nlike to know, by the side of Laura Twentifold? She was double her size,\r\nthat is certain at the least; but in quality, oh what a difference! And\r\nyet again, manners, and the fear of what I might say greatly against my\r\nown interest, enable me to speak in a chastened style; and to do that, I\r\nhad better leave Polly still absent.\r\n\r\nOn the very day after Professor Megalow returned to his duties in\r\nLondon, my dear lady comforted her mind, by returning to the place still\r\nfull of him. You must understand, that the Professor had never been\r\nactually staying at the Towers; because, without any other fullgrown\r\ngentleman dwelling in the house, it might have looked amiss. So he had\r\nhis own camping place at Crowton-on-the-Naze, which is ten miles further\r\nup the coast than the rising watering-place, called Happystowe. Yet\r\nthere had not been many days, when he failed to put himself into spruce\r\nattire--so far as his nature permitted--and to dine, and make a pleasant\r\nevening, with my lady, and her gallant son, Sir Roland. And when he was\r\ngone, it could not be helped, that the evenings should grow long, and\r\ndull.\r\n\r\nIt must have been August, and about the middle of it (according to our\r\nholidays, which were sadly near their end), when my dear Lady walked\r\ndown the sands, to talk to an ancient fisherman, about keeping the\r\nrelics of the whale upright. Roly was gone, with the Keeper, inland, to\r\nsee about exercising some young dogs, in preparation for the\r\nshooting-time; and the lovely little lady, and myself, were left, to\r\nlook for pretty shells, and to amuse each other. And I never grew tired\r\nof obeying her commands; so sweet was her voice, and so gentle were her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Now I want to show all these,\" she said, \"to my darling Dorothea, that\r\nshe may choose exactly what she likes; and it is high time to put her\r\nnecklace on, that you have made so beautifully, Ariel.\"\r\n\r\nShe always called me \"Ariel;\" because she had heard her mother do it,\r\nonce or twice, and she said it was so much prettier than \"Tommy.\" And\r\nalthough she was more than ten years old, she had not outgrown the\r\nwholesome joy of a little woman in her baby-doll. Dorothea, moreover,\r\nwas quite young at present, and sweetly instructive in the newest\r\nfashions, having only come two days ago from Paris, with the kind\r\nintroduction of Professor Megalow.\r\n\r\n\"You may sit down quite close to dear Dorothea; because you are not\r\nclumsy and rough, like Roly; who cannot at all enter into the feelings\r\nof a lovely and delicate creature, like this. And, Ariel, I am quite\r\nsure that Dolly will like you, as soon as she opens her eyes, which are\r\nshut now--you must understand--from the sea-air being too much for her.\r\nBut you must let me put her necklace on, although you have made it so\r\nbeautifully; not that I would not trust you to do it, but because you\r\ncannot understand her hair. It would hardly be proper, if you did, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nShe was always like this, such a sweet little love; so afraid of hurting\r\nanybody's feelings, and so ready to think everybody good. When I sat\r\ndown near her, on a bank of bed-rushes, with the doll sitting carefully\r\nbetween us, I could not help feeling ungrateful in my heart, for the\r\nprospect of Miss Polly Windsor to-morrow. And I could not quite fancy\r\nthat Maiden Lane--though alive with delights of its proper class--could\r\nsupply such contentment to sight, and thought (not that I put it so\r\ngrandly then) as the place I sate in, and the things I saw. For the tide\r\nwas coming in, with pleasant feeling of the air, and ready briskness of\r\nthe things, that had been waiting for it. At every short step that it\r\nmade in advance--for the waves toddled in, like babies--there was some\r\npretty thing, starting up in front, to run, and to glisten before it.\r\nBut the prettiest thing of all sate there by me.\r\n\r\n\"You are always at work,\" she said, \"always doing something. Why do\r\npeople want us to be educated so? Those funny letters are all Greek, I\r\nknow; because Roly has got some that he learns at Harrow. But he doesn't\r\nseem to like it, more than I like French; and he puts it in a cupboard,\r\nfor the holidays. Ariel, why should you work more than Roly does? He\r\nnever does a thing, unless he likes it.\"\r\n\r\nI had thought this out, and my reply was ready. \"Roly will be a rich\r\nman, and I shall not. He belongs to great people, and I belong to small\r\nones. He will get on all the same, whether he works, or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I call that as unfair as anything can be. And I could not have\r\nbelieved it, though I know you tell the truth, unless I had heard of\r\nsuch things before. We all ought to work, to do good, of course; but not\r\nin the middle of the holidays.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have got to go back to old Rum, on Monday;\" I answered, with a\r\nwistful gaze at her; \"and unless I can say a hundred lines of Homer,\r\nbeginning at the place where we left off, cracks will be the word, and\r\nno mistake. And he's come to be so sharp, from being done so often, that\r\nthere's not a fellow now with the pluck to run a tib, or a crib, or a\r\nleary round the corner. _Ton d' apameibomenos_ is the only cock that\r\nfights.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a lucky thing it is to be a girl!\" She cast her eyes down, after\r\nlooking at me, to learn my opinion of this sentiment; for that opinion\r\nshowed itself as opposite as could be, to hers. \"I only mean because we\r\ndon't get cracks, and we don't jump on one another, as they do to you\r\nsometimes; oh, Ariel, how can you put up with that? And then they tie a\r\nstring to your toe at night. What courage it must take, to be a boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Before Bill Chumps went to Oxford,\" I replied, while looking at the\r\ntiny foot, she put forth on the sand; \"he shut up all bullying, in our\r\nschool. There used to be a lot of it; and after getting taw, or togy, in\r\nthe playground, and rats in school, a fellow couldn't sleep, for fear of\r\ncramp. But Bill set up a different fashion altogether; and the little\r\nfellows now begin to cock over us, who are their seniors. I am getting\r\nbigger than I used to be, and so well up in the school, that I am very\r\nuseful, in doing the big fellows' exercises. And they never jump on me,\r\nas they used to do, when I couldn't try to fly for them. _Grip_ would\r\nhave something to say to them, next morning, if they tried it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I do love _Grip_, because he is so ugly; and I love you, Ariel,\r\nbecause you are so pretty, and so kind, and gentle; and you never do\r\nmischief, unless Roly sets you the example. I shall cry, when you go\r\naway; I'm sure I shall; and I shall put Dorothea into mourning for you.\r\nI don't believe a bit that your papa makes candles; and if he does--how\r\ncould we go to bed, without them? I should just like to ask people that.\r\nAnd what could they say, I should be glad to know?\"\r\n\r\nTo me this appeared an extremely sensible, and large-minded view of the\r\ncase, and I did not hesitate to promote it.\r\n\r\n\"And what would you do without soap, Lady Laura? My father makes soap of\r\nthe finest quality. A great deal better, as everybody says, than any\r\nturned out by Mr. Windsor, though he put his name on every\r\ncake--'Windsor's best brown Windsor.' And no better than curds, every\r\nsquare of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if I see any of it in my room, I shall throw it straight out of\r\nthe window, and say 'Please to bring me Ariel's soap.' But you must not\r\ncall me 'Lady Laura.' My mother is a lady, but I am not; till I marry my\r\ncousin, Lord Counterpagne; as they say I shall have to do, when I grow\r\nup. But I don't care about him at all, till then. He has got red hair,\r\nand his eyes are crooked.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough it was no concern of mine, this arrangement appeared to me most\r\nunfair. But I did not dare to say a word against it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Ariel,\" my little beauty went on, after taking up her doll, and\r\ncoaxing it; \"can you think of anything so bad, as marrying a person you\r\ndon't like? Because you can never get away, you know; according to the\r\nlaw of the land, I believe, and according to the Bible. My mother has\r\nnever said a word about it; but Roly declares that I am bound to do it,\r\nand he is always determined to have his own way. Oh, Dorothea, what\r\nwould you do?\"\r\n\r\nI knew very little of the world as yet, and in matters above me, I was\r\nloth to speak; but I could not help saying--\"There is lots of time yet.\r\nYou may trust me to help you, if you only let me know.\"\r\n\r\n\"How stupid I am! I never thought of that;\" she turned over towards me,\r\nand put up her hands, as if for me to help her; and then suddenly began\r\nto stroke my hair, as she had often longed to do, but had hitherto\r\nrefused my invitation. \"I must do it once, before you go, to see how the\r\nwhole of it is fastened on. Don't be afraid; I won't hurt you, Ariel. I\r\nknow how Ethel Jones does mine. And if they want to marry me, and I\r\ndon't like it, all you will have to do, is this--to get into the train,\r\nand come down here, and then take off your lead, and fly away with me,\r\nand come back when the ceremony is over.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how could they do it, without you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"You musn't expect me to be reasonable always;\" she answered, and began\r\nto play with me, gently, and beautifully, and laughing all the time.\r\n\r\n\"What a pair of silly little things you are!\" Lady Twentifold came upon\r\nus suddenly, while Laura was trying to uncurl my hair, and I was\r\noffering to kiss her, but afraid to do it; while she was dodging in and\r\nout, to tempt me more; \"Ariel, you told me this morning, that unless you\r\nlearned a hundred lines of Greek to-day, you had better not be born,\r\nnext Monday. And you asked me to write a letter of apology, to your\r\nlearned Dr. Rumbelow. He is likely to be our new Bishop, I was told\r\nthis morning; and it will put Roly down, for he made sure that his\r\nMaster would receive the offer. So I hope that you will never call him\r\n'Old Rum,' any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Rum to be the Bishop, my dear lady!\" I cried, as if I had quite\r\nlost my place. \"And who is to be our master, I should like to know? Oh,\r\nI won't learn another line; 'twould be trouble thrown away.\"\r\n\r\nMy practical conclusion was borne out by facts--sad facts for all sons\r\nof the _Partheneion_. Dr. Rumbelow's luck was a joy to us, at first;\r\nbecause we all liked him, and got off a lot of work. But our joy soon\r\nwent, and a bad time followed; as we all found out, and pretty quickly\r\ntoo. For the new master's name, was Crankhead, \"Ernest Mauleverum\r\nCrankhead,\" M.A., a Cambridge man, and a lofty Wrangler; but without\r\nmuch Greek, as we soon found out.\r\n\r\nNow, before I left Twentifold Towers, and returned to the smell of our\r\nworks,--which had changed very greatly for the worse, while I was away\r\ndown here,--Sir Roland Towers-Twentifold (being well sixteen, and tall\r\nfor his age, and of long experience, at one of our largest public\r\nschools) took me aside into a saddle-room, wherein he was learning to\r\nsmoke cigars, and put into a nutshell all the essence of the British\r\nConstitution. How I wish, I could remember what he said! But it sank\r\ninto my mind, too deeply ever to be brought up again; and it blended\r\nwith, and flourished in, the flower of my life; as liquid manure\r\nreappears in bright flowers, \"_inscripti nomina regum_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" he went on, as soon as ever he had put into ten words the\r\nlessons of a thousand years, \"you will see now, how it is that we don't\r\nget on. We never get a man to take the lead, who knows his own mind,\r\nand will stick to it, and throw up his situation, rather than carry it\r\non, against his own lights. And then, there come a lot of fellows\r\nswarming for first pull, as we rush to the swipes-can after cricket; and\r\nthe louder any cad is for his rights (which are sure to mean the wrongs\r\nof some quieter chap), the surer he is to get served first. Now, can you\r\ncall this Government?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't pretend to know much about it,\" I replied, for we had held some\r\nconversation of this kind before; \"but my father says, that any business\r\ncarried on, as the Government of this country is, would have to put its\r\nshutters up, within three months, if it started with a hundred thousand\r\npounds. But you mustn't tell any one that he said this; for I believe,\r\nby the way he would not answer me, that he has got a fine Government\r\ncontract, by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father is quite right; he is a man of strong sense;\" Sir Roland\r\nmade answer, as soon as he could, after taking a large puff of smoke the\r\nwrong way; \"let him get every farthing he can from the Government, and\r\nthen he will be able to understand them. Why, I might not have got the\r\nknowledge that I have, except for a trick that they wanted to play about\r\nmy cousin Counterpagne, when he comes of age. Counterpagne is soft, and\r\nhis mother no better; and being of an ancient Tory race, they expected\r\nto have things made smooth for them. But I can't stop, to tell you all\r\nthat now. You are to come back at Christmas, and you shall hear it then.\r\nCounterpagne is to marry little Laura, to prevent any mischief to our\r\nproperty, and influence; and between us, we shall send six members up,\r\nbesides Counterpagne himself in the Peers of course, and me in the\r\nCommons, for the Towers' own hole. But, Tommy, look at me, and tell me\r\nthis. If under a Government, that calls itself Conservative, as the\r\npresent fellows do, such things can be done, as I was going to tell you;\r\nwhat is to be expected of the Radicals? I'll tell you what; if the\r\nConstitution lasts till I am of age, which seems a most unlikely\r\nthing--I shall want you, and every man of sense I know, to collect, and\r\nput your shoulders to the wheel. Remember that.\"\r\n\r\nI did not at all understand what he meant, although he had spoken\r\nseveral times to this effect. But I promised to do all I could; and was\r\npleased with the thoughts of becoming so important.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, you will rise,\" my friend continued, without asking what I was\r\nthinking of; \"such a fellow as you are, must go up, unless he makes a\r\ndownright fool of himself. You can beat me all to fits, in Greek and\r\nLatin, though you have only been at a dirty little private school. You\r\nhave got a most wonderful face of your own; so easy-going, and\r\nsweet-tempered, that it makes every fellow think you slow, and drop all\r\njealousy about you. And more than all,--and that alone should be enough\r\nto make your fortune--you can draw the attention of the whole world upon\r\nyou, whenever you please, by going over their heads. I have been very\r\ngood, in letting you off, without sending you up, a lot of times. But\r\nyou know that I have done it upon one condition--you must cultivate the\r\nart, without any one's knowledge, and be ready to go up, at some great\r\nmoment, when I give the signal. Pretend, for the present, that you\r\ncan't do it; but practise, as I told you, more and more. I have shown\r\nyou the muscles you must try to strengthen, and the places where you\r\nmust lay on fat. It is nothing in the world, but a kind of swimming; and\r\nthere everything depends upon your being quite at home. Now, remember\r\nwhat I say; and when you come down at Christmas, I shall put you through\r\nyour paces, and expect to find you perfect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Roly,\" I replied, \"you talk as lightly as all the men of science\r\ndid about me. I will do my very utmost to please you, I am sure. But I\r\nnever expect to be of any service to you. You are learning to smoke, and\r\nyour smoke goes up; and that makes you think that I can do the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so, Tommy. A great deal of it went down, until I understood it.\r\nAnd now look at that!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL OECONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy going from home, after so many years, we had not only done ourselves\r\nno good--in the opinion of our friends, who could not go--but we had\r\nopened the door to a swarm of changes, which came rushing in upon the\r\nheels of each other. To me, the greatest change of all appeared to have\r\ntaken place in Maiden Lane itself; for the houses had turned black, and\r\nthe windows grimy, and the roadway and the pavement (wherever there was\r\nany) seemed to cry aloud for washing, and the people too, unconscious as\r\nthey were of such desire.\r\n\r\nExcitement appeared to be the main thing now, and hurry, and suspicion,\r\nand no time to look about; whereas both at Happystowe, and\r\nCrowton-on-the-Naze, the chief business of the natives was, to look at\r\none another; and when there was no more to be made of that, to consider\r\nthe meaning of the sand and sea. And taken on the whole, those folk\r\nlooked wiser, and a great deal happier than ours did.\r\n\r\nBut to dwell upon that, would be ungraceful now, when I call to mind\r\nthat our own boiling, and the agitation of my father's engine had a\r\ngreat deal to do with the ferment around us. No sooner had my father\r\nreturned to business--with Joe Cowl, and the summons, wiped off his\r\nconscience, and Billy Barlow's new devices written in his heart--than he\r\nfound on his desk, he could never tell how, a sealed invitation to\r\ntender for soap, for the heads of all the convicts (with average\r\nstated), in six great castles, for the improvement of our race. The\r\nconsumption of soap, per head was given, and a number of smaller\r\nparticulars, all in print and proper columns; and then the requirement\r\nfor samples, to be delivered at six places. And in pencil, very faint\r\nupon the margin, there was written, \"It must not be soft, and it must be\r\nstrong. Price not to be too low, like the Rads' stuff. Tallow will be\r\nwanted soon. _Rub this out._\" There was something so touching in this,\r\nand so full of fine feeling, as between man and man, that my father\r\nimmediately filled his pipe, and had a good smoke to consider it. At one\r\ntime, his heart warmed up with thinking of the goodwill remaining in\r\npolitics yet, and the loyalty every one is bound to show to, and expect\r\nfrom, his own side. And yet again, he could not feel sure, that he ought\r\nto have any faith at all in this. Why should there be six samples sent,\r\nof a stone weight each, to six different places, and all to be left\r\nwithout the money? It looked like a hoax, with Joe Cowl at the root of\r\nit, to get a paltry laugh at him; or else a swindle, to get\r\nthree-fourths of a hundredweight of soap, for nothing. He resolved to\r\nact warily, and so he did. \"If they mean well to me,\" he said, \"they\r\nwill never examine my samples.\"\r\n\r\nThey meant so thoroughly well to him, that they sniffed at his samples,\r\nand found them shocking--for he sent the worst stuff he could lay hand\r\non, for fear of having it stolen--and then they gave an order for sixty\r\ntons, to be furnished at once, and sixty more to follow. Our works had\r\nnever sent out such a lot before, at one delivery; and no wonder that\r\nthey could not think of me.\r\n\r\n\"John Windsor shall not have a finger in the pie;\" my father said right\r\nmanfully; \"I am not at all sure that his politics are sound. He would\r\nlower my quality, to get the next himself. You know how he wanted to run\r\naway, Sophy, when that great bombardment came. Let every vat stand upon\r\nits own bottom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bucephalus, you are quite right,\" mother answered; \"as you always are,\r\nwhen you get on. Work double tides, Bubbly, and double your hands. Don't\r\nlet them have a penny, if you can help it.\"\r\n\r\nSo grand was the commodity thus produced, with the help of the lessons\r\nat Happystowe, that it is remembered to the present day, and cited as\r\nthe type of excellence. For sanitary purposes it was needed and it not\r\nonly met but transcended them. There was not a convict left with a stub\r\nof hair, though their hair is always bristly; and very few had such\r\nconstitution, as to keep any roots for future trouble. Universal\r\nsatisfaction was expressed, and my father put up the Royal Arms, twice\r\nas big as the knacker's across the road, and done in thicker timber.\r\n\"Thoroughly candid, and straight-forward,\" he said to every one who\r\nspoke of it; \"good value for money, good money for value. Public\r\nconfidence met, by private industry, enterprise, and honour. I serve\r\nthem exactly as I should serve you. Just to turn five per cent. on my\r\nmoney, and no more. If any man calls that exorbitant, let him come and\r\ndo it cheaper.\"\r\n\r\nThe only thing at all mysterious was the requirement for six samples, to\r\nbe delivered at six places far apart. But that was explained most\r\npleasantly, so that my father rubbed his hands, and chuckled, while he\r\nwas reading the debates, in the early part of the following session. A\r\nfiguresome member of the Opposition, who thought himself fit to be\r\nChancellor of the Exchequer, had given notice of a question, concerning\r\na certain contract for soap, to be supplied to Her Majesty's penal\r\nestablishments, etc., with dates, and other insinuations. And he made a\r\nvery hasty speech about it, confounding the _post_, and the _propter\r\nhoc_; quite as if my father, whom he dared to call a \"wholly unknown\r\nmanufacturer,\" had been preferred for a lucrative contract, because of\r\nhis behaviour at election-time! So far as wickedness can be good, this\r\nman spoke well, having got up all his facts; and he sate down in\r\ntriumph, as he thought.\r\n\r\nBut before he had time to digest his cheers, the gentleman, who was to\r\nreply got up, with a beautiful smile, and a very pleasant glance at a\r\npaper laid before him, \"I am furnished with particulars, from the head\r\nof the department, concerning this heinous transaction, sir,\" he said;\r\n\"and I find that large samples were delivered in six quarters, widely\r\napart, and wholly unconnected; the names of which I will read, if\r\ndesired.\" Loud cheers followed from every corner of the House--for\r\nnobody likes to have his own rights interfered with--and the speaker\r\nconcluded, \"I will ask for no apology. From the Honourable Member for\r\nClap-trap, it would be of no more value than his imputation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said my father, when he had read this twice; \"I call that\r\nsomething like a Government. If we only get a few more contracts, Sophy,\r\nwe'll send Tommy into the House to see about them. There might be a\r\nstranger thing, my dear, than a long blue paper for ten thousand pounds,\r\nwith \"Thomas Upmore\" signed for Her Majesty above, and \"Bucephalus\r\nUpmore,\" for himself below. What a rage John Windsor will be in, when he\r\nreads about those six samples, and not one of them gone out of his gate!\r\nI had sense enough to keep the whole of that inside my own waistcoat.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it would have been good, and even pleasant for the public--lustily\r\nthough they condemned us, at the time--if the only increase of activity\r\nshown in those parts had come out of our chimneys. But there always is a\r\nmob of people, who never will leave well alone; and these had got up\r\ndeputations, petitions, memorials, circulars, indignation meetings,\r\ncommittees, commissions, and worst of all missiles, concerning the\r\nwholesome smell we made, and had made before some of their fathers were\r\nborn. When the unenlightened mass of minds falls into this bubonic fever\r\nof excitement, the right thing to administer is gruel, in the form of\r\ngeneral promises, a desire to hear all that can be said, and a\r\nthoroughly unselfish gratitude towards those, who have made the worst of\r\nyou. But my father had never possessed this wisdom, which belongs of\r\nsweet right to the Liberals; and whether on the ground of true British\r\nprinciple, or the Royal Arms, or the money coming in, he took a firm\r\nstand, with his hands in his pockets, and his legs well apart, and\r\ndefied the public.\r\n\r\n\"Every blessed flue of mine,\" he said, \"have gone ten feet higher, since\r\nI were a boy; and with present foundations, can't go no higher. Before\r\nfolk grumble, their place is to stump up. If every cantankerous fellow,\r\nwho don't know a wholesome smell by the touch of it, would put down a\r\nhalf-crown, if he has got one, instead of signing lies against me, I\r\ndon't know but what I might lay foundations, and change my insurance,\r\nand go twenty foot higher. Though a heap of disease would break out, I\r\nexpect. Look at the plants in my bed-room window, scarlets, and blue\r\nthings, and lilies of the Nile! Is there any man, or woman, round these\r\nparts, half so good-looking, or so sweet to come by? They like it\r\nrarely, and so would you, if you understood what is good for you. And\r\nwho was here first, you, or I, and my fathers, for three generations of\r\nboilers? We didn't want the houses; they came round us; every brick of\r\nthem was laid, with my smoke to set it. And very good neighbours they\r\nhave always been, till this scientific stuff came up, about cur-bones,\r\nand oxen, and the Lord knows what! I tell you what--if you don't like\r\nit, budge yourself, but you won't budge me.\"\r\n\r\nSuch speeches only made the fuss grow louder; until the authorities felt\r\nthemselves compelled to do something sanatory. There was no\r\n\"Metropolitan Board of Works,\" as yet, I believe; or if there was, it\r\nnever came up our way. But the Vestry of St. Pancras had many stormy\r\nmeetings, which my father deigned not to attend; but his workmen were\r\nthere in great force, and made more noise than our new steam-engine. In\r\nshort, the matter came (as every matter does now, and the practice\r\nalready was beginning) to what is called \"a reasonable and satisfactory\r\ncompromise, conciliating all interests.\" The complaint of the public had\r\nbeen about the air, and the noxious exhalations, and vile odours, as\r\nthey chose to call them. But who can see the air? Who can tell what is\r\nin it? It varies with every puff of wind. Let us turn to something\r\ntangible. The earth is a thing that can be dealt with, and the earth is\r\nat the bottom of every mischief on the face of it. So, to cure the smell\r\nof our chimneys, they ordered a four-foot culvert down our valley, where\r\nthe course of the old Fleet-stream had been; and the voice of the public\r\nwent off to it.\r\n\r\nThis being settled, my father was enabled to make tenfold the smells he\r\nhad ever made before, without any one hoisting a handkerchief. An\r\ninquisitive stranger would sometimes ask, whether this neighbourhood was\r\nalways choked with vapours, which he coarsely stigmatized. A piece of\r\nvaluable advice, common (yet neglected universally) about the prior\r\nclaims of his own affairs, was the only reward for his sympathies. What\r\nright had a fellow, with a walking-stick, to come grumbling against our\r\nrate-payers, and their engineers, and contractors? Measures were being\r\ntaken, or at any rate were in contemplation; and every man with a horse\r\nand cart would get fifteen shillings a day for them.\r\n\r\nBut alas, how little do we forecast, while we vindicate, our own\r\nwelfare! It would have been better for my dear father--as upright and\r\ndownright a man as ever lived--to have gone to the expense of a new\r\nchimney-stack one hundred feet high, or even to have put out all his\r\nfires, than to have helped to bring that drain, down our hitherto Maiden\r\nvalley. The soil in the bottom was of concentrated essence, combining\r\nall the density of bygone generations with the volatile relics of their\r\nlabours. It would grow almost anything, if only scratched, and no\r\nhealthier place for a walk could be found; but wisdom is not justified\r\nof her fathers, when she goes to turn them up.\r\n\r\nIn happy ignorance of woes impending, I went back to the _Partheneion_,\r\nand found the whole establishment turned upside down. _Grip_ came with\r\nme, as a thing of course, and found his old barrel standing on its head,\r\nand a notice upon it in large letters--\"No dogs allowed.\" If anything\r\nrouses the juvenile spirit, such rude breach of prescription does it.\r\nWith the help of Jack Windsor, who was quite of my mind, I replaced the\r\nbarrel in its old position, which was snug in a corner impregnable to\r\nguns, and I fastened him there with his own long chain, and said, \"Now\r\ndefend yourself, old boy. I have got lots of money, and you shall not\r\nstarve.\" He fully understood the situation; and if any demand for\r\nsympathy arose, it would be on behalf of the individual attempting to\r\ndislodge him.\r\n\r\nThen all of us were summoned to the hall, to hear an oration from the\r\n\"Principal\"--as he styled himself, to start with--our new schoolmaster,\r\nErnest Mauleverum Crankhead, a short brisk gentleman, quite young, with\r\na pale square face, a yellow moustache, and very quick bronzy eyes,\r\nwhich never took two seconds' rest upon anything. Accustomed as we were\r\nto the long grave countenance, waving white locks, and calm abstracted\r\ngaze of our simple old Dr. Rumbelow, we could not believe that we saw\r\nthe new man; until he stood up at what he called the _rostrum_, and hit\r\nit three times, with an ivory hammer.\r\n\r\n\"Going, going, gone!\" Jack Windsor whispered; and gone was the glory of\r\nthe _Partheneion_. We knew it, we felt it, without a word uttered, our\r\nhearts fell into the heels of our socks; and no boy thought twice of the\r\nthings in his pocket. Our account would be with a sharp hand now, a\r\nresolute, and a malignant one; and what was worst of all, and which a\r\nboy descries at the very first glance,--we should not have to deal with\r\na gentleman. \"I shall never go up any more,\" thought I.\r\n\r\nI remember very little of what Crankhead said; and none of it is worth\r\nrepeating. But he gave us to understand, that the sooner we forgot\r\neverything we had learned hitherto, and began on lines entirely new, the\r\nbetter it would be for our own minds, and what mattered far more, our\r\nsuccess in life. For the few, whose parents might still be benighted\r\nenough to insist upon Greek and Latin, a Classical Master would be kept,\r\nbut the College--for such he had the cheek to call it--would henceforth\r\naim at a loftier mark. Science was the noble, and simple distinction,\r\nthe all-absorbing element of this age. Mankind had been lying on their\r\nbacks till now, looking up at the stars, and at imaginary Powers; now\r\nthey arose, and asserted their rights, and their kinship to every\r\norganic being, and the interchangeability of everything. Classes for\r\nscience would be formed to-morrow, under the charge of the four most\r\neminent Professors of the period, Professors Brachipod, and Jargoon,\r\nChocolous, and Mullicles!\r\n\r\nAt the sound of their names, these gentlemen appeared. Conscience, and\r\nprudence, alike induced me to push Jack Windsor in front of me, because\r\nhe was both broad and thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nNO EXTRAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing older now, by several years, than when I had expected to be cut up\r\nall alive, and having been taught by Professor Megalow, that science is\r\nnot of necessity cruel, I managed to sleep pretty well that night, and\r\nresolved to be brave in the morning. And truly there was no great need\r\nfor courage; which rather disappointed me, and cast a slur upon my\r\nvalue, as a boy of exceptional interest. Not one of the four Professors\r\ntook the trouble to look twice at me; each had his whole time taken up,\r\nin fighting for his own tongue, and purse. Their payment was to be by\r\nhead of pupils--whether they fitted the head, or not--and being four in\r\nnumber, they put universal knowledge into four departments, each with a\r\nbigger name than the other. And each of our chaps, without ever having\r\nheard what the meaning of these big names was, had to put down his own\r\n(however short it might be) under sixteen columns, out of thirty-two,\r\nheaded with the titles of the mysterious studies. Each of the Professors\r\nwas to take eight sciences, for the subjects of his lectures; and most\r\nunfairly we were not allowed to know the human names presiding over each\r\nhumanity. Every single boy of us wanted to sign to be under Professor\r\nChocolous; not only because (as a general rule) great fun can be had\r\nwith a German, and he is nearly always easy-tempered, familiar, and\r\nkind-hearted; but also because we had heard of his ambition to transmit\r\na nascent tail to his descendants, and what could be finer than to help\r\nin its establishment? And next to him, we wanted to be under Mullicles,\r\nalthough about him we knew very little; except that he looked very soft,\r\nand expected to be disintegrated, without notice, into his component\r\nparticles. On the other hand, Brachipod was as sharp, and full of\r\npoints, as a cupping instrument; and Jargoon as dry, and creaky with\r\nlong words, as a slow steam-roller pounding granite.\r\n\r\nWith heavy dismay I sate down, and gazed at the broad sheet laid before\r\nme. At the top were placed alphabetically the names of the thirty-two\r\nsciences proposed; names which it must have been anguish to conceive,\r\nagony to pronounce, and despair to remember. Under each name was a\r\ncolumn, for the hapless victim to inscribe his own; and at the bottom a\r\nmerciful notice--\"No pupil need enter for more than sixteen of the above\r\nstudies, during the present term. But all will be expected, in the\r\nensuing term, to proceed to those which they now pretermit. The fee for\r\neach course of lectures is one guinea, payable in advance.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough I could get on with Homer pretty well, and had read the first\r\nbook of Herodotus, and one of \"Porson's Four,\" and some Xenophon, it\r\ntook me a long time to make out the name of any one of those sciences. I\r\nturned to my Lexicon, and sought for some, and for others I hunted in my\r\nLatin Dictionary, and seemed to get near some, but not to be sure;\r\nwhile of others there was no vestige. I was not aware yet, that the\r\nauthors of these words are as rash with the Classics, as they are with\r\nlogic, and maltreat the dead languages, as freely as the living.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what I'll do,\" Jack Windsor said; \"I'll go in for all\r\nthirty-two; and let father stump up, if he's got the blunt for it. Here\r\ngoes 'John Windsor,' thirty twice over.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a flood of light those plain words shed on my foggy, and\r\nthickly-fibred brain, unwitting as yet of the Athenian prototypes of all\r\nthe Pansophists, pea for pea, in the pods of Aristophanes! The _blunt_\r\nwas the point of all points with these hungry professors; and none could\r\nbe got out of me. And yet, I should never have thought of that, without\r\nJack's plain way of putting it. So I squared my elbow, and sprang my\r\npen, and took care that the ink in it was not too round, and I said,\r\n\"Don't jerk my elbow, Jack; it is no time for larks of any sort.\" And\r\nthen I wrote, in fair hand, across all thirty-two columns, these simple\r\nwords. \"Father don't pay for extras. They tried it on before, but he\r\nwould not have it. Signed, Thomas Upmore; witness, John Windsor.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a bold stroke of mine; and it succeeded, as a bold stroke often\r\ndoes, when it has the force of truth behind it. As soon as all these\r\nsignatures of zealots for new learning (of whom a great many could not\r\nspell their own names) had been received in \"Council,\" by our new\r\nPrincipal, and his four \"highly-cultured coadjutors\"--oh Lord, where is\r\ngood English buried?--there came a squeaky call, from their sacred cell\r\n(as different from old Rum's sonorous, \"send him hither,\" as the cry of\r\na mouse behind the wainscot is from the roar of a lion) and the boy who\r\nhad the longest ears made it out to be--\"the presence of Thomas Upmore\r\nis required.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I never had any great amount of pluck, which is a steadfast\r\nelement; while all my elements were light and fleeting, and never would\r\nstand up together (as in a fine character they must do) without going up\r\ninto the air, and turning round. A miserable shiver went through my\r\nheart, and turned my bright cheeks to a sad pale blue--so the other\r\nfellows said; though it recked me naught what manner of boy I might be,\r\nto look at.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, keep your pecker up;\" Jack Windsor hit me a slap on the back, to\r\nimpress this counsel, which would have taken all my breath away, if it\r\nhad not been gone already; \"think of your dad, and all the money he is\r\nmaking. Stick well up to them, that's the only ticket. Make them all\r\nshake in their shoes, dear Tommy. They will send for me next. If you\r\nfrighten them well, you will give me pluck to go on with it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was all very nice, from his own point of view; but I heartily\r\nwished that he had to go first, to show me the right way of doing it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, you are so brave,\" I said, \"if you would only come with me,\r\nand make believe you had been sent for too, I should take it so very\r\nkind of you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you wish you may catch it?\" he replied, turning round, to be\r\nready for the path of retreat.\r\n\r\n\"Well, at any rate, come to the door,\" said I; \"to know that you are\r\nthere, will be better than nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh bother, don't be such a funk,\" Jack answered; \"why, Tommy, they\r\nwon't eat you.\" And he took good care that they should not eat him, by\r\nbolting, as fast as his fat legs would go.\r\n\r\nNone of this tended to relieve my mind; but I tried to remember\r\nAchilles, and Hector, and all the brave men I had been reading of; yet\r\nin spite of them all, I took good care, so far as trembling hands\r\nallowed, to leave the door behind me open. It was now in my power, after\r\nfifteen years of growth, to go at such a pace with the wind behind\r\nme--and any wind blowing from a scientific point would surely find\r\nitself behind me--that if I could only get one yard's start, all the\r\nscience yet invented--with the Devil at the tail of it--might break its\r\nwind without coming up with me. _Dat vires animus._ The whole of my\r\n_animus_ was up and eager. I thought of all these wise men in our\r\nclot-pit; and out of despair I plucked hope, and defiance.\r\n\r\nThe longest dining-table in our hall, which would take thirty boys, and\r\ntheir plates, on each side, had been proved to be not half long enough\r\nfor the length of the papers necessary for the lantern jaws of science.\r\nAccordingly, three long boards, upon which Dr. Rumbelow's Hermes had\r\ncleaned our knives, had been brought from his out-house, and set up,\r\nwith green baize over them, to carry ink and papers. Our new master sat\r\nat the end of this length, with a brace of Professors, on his right hand\r\nand his left. To my innermost parts I recalled these four, and was\r\namazed to find that they knew not me. Principal Crankhead waved his\r\nhand, for me to stand silent at the bottom of the table; and then they\r\nall turned round, and stared at me, with the exception of Herr\r\nChocolous, who stood, with his chair pushed under the table, to assert\r\nhis upright principles. And he seemed to me to be labouring not to\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n\"The name of this pupil appears to be Thomas Upmore,\" began Mr.\r\nCrankhead, \"the son of Bucephalus Upmore, a gentleman residing in a\r\nplace called Maiden Lane. Instead of expressing his preference for\r\nsixteen of the subjects proposed for his study, he has stated very\r\nbriefly, that his father declines to pay for what he calls _extras_. He\r\ndoes not appear to have realized that these are the essential parts of\r\nall true education. Boy, what do you come here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, to be taught,\" I said, with a courage which\r\nsurprised me, \"to learn 'whatever is necessary for a liberal education,'\r\naccording to what Dr. Rumbelow says to parents and guardians, in this\r\npaper.\" I pulled an old circular of the _Partheneion_ from my pocket,\r\nand spread it on the table. \"But father gave out, from the first, that\r\nhe never would pay a shilling for extras; unless they agreed to take it\r\nout in soap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take out science in soap, indeed!\" muttered Professor Brachipod,\r\nforgetting how much he had done in that way; though certainly without\r\nintending it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Upmore, tell us, if you can remember,\" Principal Crankhead went\r\non, without deigning to notice old Rum's _prospectus_, \"what are the\r\n_extras_, as you call them, which your father has refused to pay for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drilling, and drawing, and dancing, sir, and washing, and French, and\r\nbacon for breakfast, sixpence a time for the delicate boys; and I think\r\nthere was something about new-laid eggs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zere is no sooch ting, I vill not allow it pass\"--broke in Professor\r\nChocolous, \"vat you call ze new-laid egg have no right to be so called,\r\nbecause----\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is generally stale, Professor. Well, Upmore, we seem to have\r\nascertained what your father considered objectionable. But none of them\r\nbelong to the domain of science. Your mind is a little confused,\r\nperhaps, as is only natural, at your age, after giving so much of it to\r\nGreek and Latin. Now take a fresh paper, and put your initials--we shall\r\nunderstand them--in the sixteen columns of your selection. Sit down, my\r\nlad; we shall teach you something yet.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly my mind was now confused, neither by Latin nor Greek, but by\r\nthe proximity of such a mass of learning, and its manner of foreclosing\r\nme. With a fog of big words spreading over my eyes, and pouring in at my\r\nears, as I tried to sound them, I took up the pen which had been thrown\r\nto me; then I put it in my mouth, and said to myself--\"it can't matter\r\nmuch what I sign; I'll go in for the biggest of the lot, to brag of\r\nthem. Father likes something that he can't pronounce.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no word of less than five syllables there, and a good many of\r\nthem went up to eleven. These I picked out, to learn first, with my\r\nthumbnail, after counting upon all ten fingers; and then I fell back on\r\nthe decasyllabic branches of wisdom, and got my sixteen. But, before\r\nputting anything down in ink--which my father would have had to pay\r\nfor, unless he went down to the County Court--I found in my mouth a\r\nlittle bit of the stuff (a twisted, brittle, filmy stuff it is), which\r\nmay be the nerve of the quill for aught I know; and it saved me most\r\nhappily from knowing what its name is.\r\n\r\nFor it got very easily into my throat,--so widely was that poor throat\r\nagape, at the prospect of all those tremendous words--and I put the\r\nfeather-end in, to try to pull it out; and then I began to chew the\r\nharl; and who ever did that, without improving what he was going to\r\nwrite at first? Those gentlemen still were as eager as ever, that I\r\nshould be shut up and done with; while I became unable to share their\r\nhurry, and desirous to see the case clearly.\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir,\" I said, from the bottom of the table, after\r\ngetting on a stool to be heard all up it; \"the meaning of this paper is,\r\nthat I am going to learn all this, for nothing.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Crankhead stared at the men of science, and with one accord they\r\nstared at him; and they would have been amused at my mistake, if it had\r\nnot been too serious.\r\n\r\n\"Upmore, you have a great deal yet to learn;\" the Principal spoke\r\nseverely; \"do you imagine that Science has ever imparted her blessings,\r\nfor nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure, I did not know, sir,\" I replied; \"but you said that all\r\nthese were essential parts of true education; and old Rum says--Dr.\r\nRumbelow, I mean,--in this paper, that all those are included in the\r\nmoney for the term.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have changed all that, my boy. Our ideas of what education is\r\nare entirely different from those of the obsolete system, under which\r\nyou have been trained hitherto.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if you please, sir, my father ought to have had a new paper sent\r\nhim, before he sent me back to school; or how can he tell what he is to\r\npay? I am sure, that he won't pay a farthing more than he had to pay\r\nlast quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thomas Upmore, you may go;\" the new Principal said, quite loftily,\r\nafter whispering, and receiving whispers; \"you need not return to the\r\nschoolroom at all, or to any part of these premises, except where your\r\nclothes and books are. You are too benighted, and contumacious, to\r\ndeserve any higher education; such as you expect to get for nothing.\r\nBranker, see that this boy does not communicate with the other boys.\r\nPack all his things up, and put him in a cab.\"\r\n\r\nThus was I discharged, very rudely as I thought, from the poor old\r\n_Partheneion_, now entitled the _Epistemonicon_; and I could not help\r\ncrying at the manner of it, because people would say that I had been\r\nexpelled.\r\n\r\nBut Branker, the new man-of-all-work, who seemed to care little about\r\nhis place, at the sight of a shilling in my hand, allowed me to have a\r\nword or two, in the passage, with Jack Windsor.\r\n\r\n\"Jack, they have given me the sack,\" I said; \"because I wouldn't put my\r\nname down, for father to pay sixteen guineas extra. If I had, I should\r\nhave been whacked at both ends, for certain. He would have whacked me\r\nfor doing it; and they would have whacked me worse, for not getting the\r\ntin. You have put down your dad for thirty-two guineas. Mind that, and\r\nI wish you luck of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop the cab, Tommy; stop the cab,\" cried Jack; \"I'll come away with\r\nyou, in five minutes. I must go in and tell them, I did it for a lark.\r\nWhy, I should get double the hiding that you would. My governor has got\r\nsuch a host of kids.\"\r\n\r\nI ran to fetch _Grip_, that he might run behind, and I waited in the\r\ncab, for about two minutes, and then out rushed Jack, without any hat\r\non, and jumped in, and banged up the glass, and shouted, \"Jarvey, off\r\nfor Maiden Lane, as hard as you can go!\" Then we got out of sight in the\r\nback of the cab, and laughed, through the tears on our cheeks, at going\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nSo it came to pass, that the boiling-interest was not represented any\r\nlonger, in those halls of science. When my father heard what I had done,\r\nhe shook my hand very heartily, and said that he never could have\r\nthought I had so much pluck; and he would not mind paying half again as\r\nmuch, but honestly, and on the square, you know, for my education to go\r\non all right; and he would send them his bills, just to let them see\r\nwhat a sight of money their establishment had lost.\r\n\r\n\"And what language, I should like to know, was all that science to be\r\nput in? Elamites, Parthians, Medes, at least\"--he said, as he looked at\r\nthe paper of the fees--\"to be any good value, for sixteen guineas.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, father,\" I answered; \"it was all to be told us in English, every\r\nword of it; only very big words of course, such words as you couldn't\r\nmake head or tail of.\"\r\n\r\n\"None the more honest for that,\" said father; \"why, they make them out\r\nof their own heads! I could do that, if I chose to try. Greek and Latin\r\nis what I pay for; and this new lot don't know nought of it. If it\r\nwasn't for my knowledge of the law, I'd have a defamation action against\r\nthem, for sending my only son home in a cab like this, and not have the\r\nmanners to pay the fare! They have done the same thing to Jack Windsor,\r\nyou say. Every mouth in the Lane will be full of it to-morrow. If John\r\nWindsor would go snacks, I should feel half inclined to consider about\r\nconsulting a Solicitor. And I believe it would pay; I do believe it\r\nwould. I am a public man now, and under Government I act; and such a man\r\nshould not have his son kicked out, by a bunch of those dirty\r\nProfessors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bubbly, don't open old wounds,\" advised mother; \"our Tommy is come\r\nhome, and I am deeply thankful for it. How could they help getting rid\r\nof him, when they never could have taught him half he knows? They knew\r\nthat he had served his time with their master, the great Professor\r\nMegalow; and how could they open their mouths before him? And how could\r\nthey hold up their heads before Tommy, when they thought of the pit he\r\nled them into?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aha, I see! That's it,\" cried father; \"well, I musn't be angry with\r\nthem after all. One good turn deserves another. And talking of that, we\r\nshall have no pits left, if what I was told to-day is true. The Vestry\r\nare going to send a man and two boys, all up through our valley, in the\r\ncourse of next month, with sticks and a line, to take measurements, and\r\nall the rest of it, for this drainage scheme. Well, it won't hurt us;\r\nbut I doubt very greatly whether the smell they are sure to make will be\r\nwholesome for my workmen. I must try to leave more of my stuff about, to\r\nkeep the air fresh and the bad smells away. Sophy, I must be off; you\r\nmight give me a nip of Hollands, before I light my pipe. And while I am\r\nat work, you and Tommy can put your heads together, concerning the next\r\nthing to be done with a young scamp, who has been expelled from school.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nSELF-DEFENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me now, that my education might fairly be entrusted to\r\nmyself, at least until after Christmas-time; but whether it was, that my\r\ndear parents were eager to push me on with learning, or else that they\r\nhad enjoyed enough of my company for the present, the issue was settled\r\nagainst me, and without another week of holidays. Jack Windsor was in\r\nthe same box with me; and his mother and mine laid their heads together,\r\nand came to the conclusion that Dr. Rumbelow had acted very badly. With\r\nthe aid of a noble \"manual of epistolary correspondence,\" they indited a\r\njoint letter to the new bishop, which must have grieved his upright\r\nsoul. He answered right humbly, and in few words, that he grieved as\r\ndeeply as they could do, at the utter subversion of a wholesome school;\r\nwhich would not have happened, if he could have helped it. But he had\r\nnever been the owner, and only acted under the will of Trustees, who had\r\nnot consulted him, when he left. Feeling the deepest interest in his\r\nbeloved pupils of many happy years, he watched the result with sad\r\napprehension, but could not interfere with it. But for any, whose\r\nparents desired their removal from the influence of wild doctrines, he\r\ncould with high confidence recommend an orthodox, and most efficient\r\nteacher, an old pupil of his own at Oxford, an accurate scholar, and\r\nmost active man, now doing excellent work in the Church. This was the\r\nReverend St. Simon Cope, curate of St. Athanasius, a District church in\r\nKentish Town.\r\n\r\nArmed with this letter, the two ladies went to see Mr. Cope; and came\r\nback in high feather, perfectly full of him, and of new ideas. I could\r\nnot understand their talk at all, and perhaps that was more than they\r\ndid themselves. However, I made out that I was to get up at half-past\r\nfive next Monday, put a strap-load of Greek on my back, and knock, at\r\nhalf-past six exactly, at the corner-house in Torriano Square.\r\n\r\nAll this I accomplished, not without some groans, and was met at the\r\ndoor by Mr. Cope himself. I wanted to have a good look at him, but\r\nentirely failed to manage it; so wholly did my nature fall under the\r\ninfluence of his, that when I went home at night, and father said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tommy, what is the new chap like?\"\r\n\r\nI could only answer, \"I don't know. He is not like any man I ever saw\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he whack you, Tommy?\" went on my father; \"you must want it, after\r\nall this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"He!\" I exclaimed with a lofty air; \"he need never whack any fellow. I\r\ncan tell that.\"\r\n\r\nOf this wonderful man, it might truly be said, that he was wholly free\r\nfrom selfishness. Can anything, half so strange as that, be declared of\r\nany other human being? That my own little body should go up into the\r\nair, is exceptional, though not unparalleled. But for the human mind to\r\nleave the ground, is an outrage on the laws of gravitation, ten\r\nthousandfold as rare as any I have yet accomplished. And now that I have\r\ntime to consider it calmly, this must have been the reason, why I could\r\nnot make him out, even with my outward eyes. And probably this was the\r\nreason, why we all admired, obeyed in an instant, and thoroughly revered\r\nhim; and yet we found our spirits rise, when we got away to people more\r\nof our own cast.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman never was in a hurry, but always calm and gentle, and\r\nquite ready to be interrupted; yet the quantity of work he got through\r\nin a day was enough for ten men of his strength. Twice every day, he had\r\nservice in his church, without even a clerk to help him, and four hours\r\nevery day he spent in visiting poor people. Moreover, he always had in\r\nhand some article for the great Reviews, and a heap of other careful\r\nwork; and besides all this, (and I dare say the hardest of the lot to\r\ndeal with) a score of us day-pupils, to be taught, and fed, and tended.\r\nYet never was one of us ready with a lesson, without the master being\r\nthere to hear him. And he more than heard us; he poured his own mind,\r\nwith all its clear and vivid power, as far into our thick brains as ever\r\nit would go, so that even Jack Windsor (who had no more taste in his\r\nhead than a lignified turnip) told me, going home one night, that Horace\r\nwas a fine chap after all, when you came to know what he was driving at.\r\nNo other man in the world could have brought our Jack to that\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nNow, in spite of all this, and the spending of every penny that he\r\nearned among the poor, the Reverend St. Simon Cope was not loved at all\r\nin Kentish Town; except by a few half-starving outcasts, and a good many\r\nladies with nothing to do. And the reason of this was as plain as a\r\npole--he was one of the \"High-church parsons,\" whom the free-will of the\r\nBriton will never accept.\r\n\r\nUnder the care of this excellent man, I got on very fast in \"Nescience,\"\r\n(as the _Epistemonicon_ gentlemen called the classics), and history, and\r\ntheology, and everything else except their own fads. From my very sad\r\ndeficiency in weight, I never was a fighter, though often tempted\r\ngrievously; but Jack Windsor was happily enabled to prove, that which\r\nhas been proved perpetually in Town and Gown disputations, to wit, the\r\nclear superiority in conflict of the true Academic element.\r\n\r\nFor, as we came home about noon of a Saturday, with five days and a half\r\nof Greek inside us,--in a place where a bridge was, we were met, only\r\nJack Windsor and myself, by a maniple--if they deserve the term--from\r\nthe now adulterous _Partheneion_. These were fellows of the lewder sort,\r\nwho had taken up gladly with all the new stuff, and were rank with all\r\nChemical mixtures. Without looking twice at them, we could see they\r\ndesired to give us a hiding. And they began the base unequal conflict,\r\nby casting very hard stones at us. With pleasure, and without disgrace\r\n(considering the force of numbers against us) we would have fled, by the\r\nroad that had brought us; but they had provided against this measure, by\r\nposting large boys behind us. There was nothing around us, but a world\r\nof thumps; and the air was darkened with impending fists.\r\n\r\n\"Stop a bit; hold hard;\" cried Jack Windsor, with his back against the\r\ncoping of the bridge; \"give us fair play, you lot of sneaking cowards. I\r\nsee a chap, who has been at our house, and squibbed a wasp's nest with\r\nme. Let me speak a moment to Bob Stubbs. Now, Bob, I know you were an\r\nhonourable chap, till you got among dirty foreigners. I don't want to\r\nfight you, 'cos we always were good friends. But pick out the biggest of\r\nyour scientific lot, and let me have a fair turn with him; while Tommy\r\nhere tackles some fellow of his size. You must all be going to the bad,\r\nup there; if you bring a score of fellows to pitch into two. In the old\r\ndays, we always allowed fair play.\"\r\n\r\nBeing English boys, they were moved by this; and after some little talk,\r\ntwo rings were formed--one for Jack and his antagonist, and the other,\r\nalas! for me and mine. Loth as I was to fight, it seemed better than to\r\nbe pounded passively; and so I pulled off my coat, and squared up, as my\r\nfather had shown me he used to do. And, whether by reason of his ancient\r\nsystem being more practical than the new lights, or whether in virtue of\r\nmy own quickness, in hopping away when knocked at, I may say, without\r\nany exaggeration, that I hit the other fellow more than he hit me; until\r\nI was grieved to see him bleed, and then I put down my fists, and shook\r\nhands with him.\r\n\r\nBut my own little combat was no more in comparison with Jack Windsor's,\r\nthan the skirmish between two charioteers of the \"Iliad,\" while their\r\nheroes fight. Jack was in earnest, and knew no remorse. He had been hit\r\non the forehead by a stone, and could swear that the fellow before him\r\nwas the one who threw it. Moreover, this boy had shouted, \"Come on,\r\nSuds!\" with a most contemptuous toss of his head, being bigger than\r\nJack, though not so strong, for our Jack was built up like a milestone.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Suds,\" he shouted; \"come on, my lad of lather!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll lather you, if I can,\" said Jack.\r\n\r\nThe battle was long, and quick with a spirit of trenchant valour, on\r\neither side. I did not see the beginning, because I was strenuously\r\noccupied with my own engagement; but that being brought to a happy\r\nconclusion, the boy I had conquered joined me, with much good will, in\r\nobserving the other fight. And here let me mention that his name was\r\nBellows, Jeremiah Bellows of Blackpool, a prominent orator, as everybody\r\nknows, of the Liberal party, by and by.\r\n\r\nWhen Bellows, and I, came up to look, there was no mistaking the nature\r\nof the fray. Very little time had been lost in repose between the\r\nrounds, and the action had been so vigorous, and so well sustained, that\r\non either side now it was a harder job to fetch the breath, than to give\r\nthe blow. Whichever might conquer, there could be no doubt that the\r\nfight was a credit to his school.\r\n\r\nHappily for us, the \"noble science of self-defence\" was not yet one of\r\nthe thirty-two taught by the four Professors. Otherwise Jack would have\r\nlong been vanquished, for he had not much of polemical skill; and I was\r\nastonished at his endurance, having always found him peaceful. But I\r\nknew, by the way his lips were set, and his square style of going\r\nforward, that his mind was made up, to be knocked to pieces, sooner than\r\nknock under.\r\n\r\nThis was a lesson to me, than which I have never had a better one in all\r\nmy life. There was scarcely a pin to choose between those two, in the\r\nmatter of affliction. Jack had got one eye quite bunged up, and his\r\nenemy had both eyes half-way closed; the nose of our Jack was gone in at\r\nthe middle, and that of his adversary at the end; and their other\r\ncontusions might pretty nearly match. Yet Jack won, all of a heap. And\r\nwhy? Because he would rather be killed, than yield. The other fellow\r\nwould rather yield, than stand the very smallest chance of being killed.\r\n\r\nSo when Jack came up for another good round, his enemy sate, and looked\r\nat him, and thought it would be wiser to negotiate. He was not by any\r\nmeans whacked, he declared, and he went on to prove it, though still\r\nsitting down--as Britannia never lets her tail drop now, without\r\nelevating her tongue, to stand for it--but his mind was made up, not to\r\nincur further danger of blood-guiltiness.\r\n\r\nAfter all the insults put upon him, Jack would not let him off, without\r\na clearer understanding.\r\n\r\n\"Either you are whacked, or not,\" said he; \"if you are whacked, say so\r\nstraightforrard, and I will shake hands with you. If you are not, stand\r\nup again.\"\r\n\r\nThis was plain English, the only sensible thing in a case of that kind.\r\nThe other boy looked about; but saw no way to shuffle out of it, having\r\nnot yet been Prime Minister.\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to fight any more,\" he said, \"until I perceive the\r\nnecessity of it. At the same time, you can see yourself, that I am not a\r\nbit afraid of you. Every one who knows me will bear me out in that. I\r\ncould prove it, if I had time; but there goes the dinner-bell, and we\r\nall must run. Not from you, mind, not from you; only because we are\r\nobliged to bolt.\"\r\n\r\nLikely enough, there are people who would be glad to make light of this\r\nvictory; as they do with all those we always lose, while blowing up the\r\ntrumpet in the very new moon, if ever we cannot help winning one. But\r\nJack, and I, took a natural view of the facts we ourselves had created.\r\nScience had bitten the dust before the powers of ancient literature,\r\nthough the latter had struggled at fearful odds; and seven of the boys,\r\nwho had seen it, persuaded their parents to take them from the Gorgon,\r\nand apprentice them again to the gentle Muse, who only strikes in\r\nself-defence. And as soon as my father and mother heard it--by reason of\r\nmy bruises, one of which required raw beefsteak,--they were for ever\r\nconfirmed in their perception of their own wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut alas! I scarcely know how to tell the next event in my sad career.\r\nGladly would I leave it all untold, save by mine enemies; if the latter\r\nwould only tell it truly, or leave it untold falsely. But this it is\r\nhopeless to expect. There is a certain rancour in all persons of loose\r\npolitics; wherewith--to put it liberally--nature, abhorring a vacuum,\r\nhas stopped the vast gap of their principles. And this pervasive\r\nbitterness, when not obtaining vent enough, as it fairly might do upon\r\none another, sometimes sets them raking up the private life, and\r\ndomestic history, of those who are not like themselves.\r\n\r\nIt has been related, some way back, that the great authorities of our\r\nparish, having been urged by fussy people--most of whom paid no rates at\r\nall--to abate, what they were pleased to call, the nuisance of our\r\nwholesome smell, had arrived at last at a resolution, to cure the air of\r\nour chimney-tops, by carrying a big culvert through the valley, a\r\nhundred yards below. How this was to effect that purpose, none of us\r\nclearly understood; but as it would not come near our works, yet saved\r\nthem from being grumbled at, we accepted the conviction of the public,\r\nthat it must prove a perfect cure. And reasoning by analogy, we expected\r\nno stroke to be struck, for a score of happy years yet to come.\r\n\r\nBut Joe Cowl, that same chimney-sweep who had tried to summon father,\r\ntold all his friends, till he quite believed, that he never had been the\r\nsame man, since the time my father syringed him. If this had been true,\r\nhow much it would have been to his benefit, and his neighbours'! But\r\nbeing scant of introspection, he positively made a grievance of it! He\r\ncontrived to push himself on the Committee appointed by the Vestry, for\r\nthe drainage of Maiden valley, for no other reason in the world, than\r\nthat he hoped to pester us, by carrying out that noisome scheme. As\r\neverybody said, there was no reason for such hurry; the valley had been\r\na valley for more thousands of years than we could count, without\r\nwanting a bodkin put along it. In wet weather it drained itself; and in\r\ndry weather what was there to drain? The Lord had made it, as seemed\r\nHim best; and could any ratepayer improve His works?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, by stirring up, and rushing about with his best clothes\r\non, and grouting (like a pig, with his ring come out) and writing, every\r\nother day, to every paper that would print his stuff, Chimney-sweep Cowl\r\nrobbed all the parish of the pleasure of considering the next thing to\r\nbe done. For he made them actually begin this job, at very little more\r\nthan three years from the time of their voting it urgent, and not very\r\nmuch over two years from the time they raised the cash for it. But we\r\nlet him see, when it was begun, that we were rather pleased than\r\notherwise; and father went down and told Cowl himself, with as pleasant\r\na smile as need be seen, that he would lend them a spare wheel-barrow,\r\nif they would put new gudgeons in; and as a large ratepayer of St.\r\nPancras, he would try to keep them to their work. And it is a sad thing\r\nnow to think of, that if he had been a bad-tempered man, and shunned\r\nthem altogether, he might have been alive, while I write this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no man in London, except the Reverend St. Simon Cope, worked\r\nharder now than my father did. Not from any narrow-minded hankering\r\nafter bullion; nor the common doom of our species, to find its final\r\ncause, as well as case, in _specie_; but from the stern resolution of a\r\nman, to turn out a good article, at a good figure, and to keep his own\r\nfinger, and no others, in his pie. Mr. John Windsor had been trying very\r\nhard, to dip his own ladle into our warm vats; but while father valued\r\nhim most highly as a friend, and would eagerly have done anything\r\nwhatever, that lay in his power, to help him; he found it lie more and\r\nmore beyond his power, to let him come into his yard just now. Plump and\r\nportly as Mr. Windsor was, and equally blunt at either end, my father\r\nkept calling him--as soon as he was gone--the thin end of the wedge, and\r\ntelling dear mother to be very careful, not to say a word to let him in.\r\nThis was exactly in accordance with my mother's own view of the case;\r\nand she said, that she first had insisted upon it, and that if Mrs.\r\nWindsor came sounding her for ever--as she did, even on a Sunday--it\r\nwould take her a long time to discover any hollow place in her presence\r\nof mind. For she always answered.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear, what do I care for odious business? You know, how much\r\nsooner you would hear me talk, about delightful Happystowe, and the sun\r\ncoming over the sea, and the shrimps, and the shameful proceedings of\r\nthe bathing females--for I never can call them ladies--and that dear\r\ngood Lady Towers-Twentifold, who longed so extremely to make my\r\nacquaintance; and has written once more, for my Tommy to go down, and\r\nspend the holidays with his old friend, Sir Roland, at Twentifold\r\nTowers. What a pity it is, that we live so far asunder!\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you think, dear,\" Mrs. Windsor asked demurely, \"that when the\r\nwind was blowing towards the windows of the Tower, her ladyship might\r\nobject a little to the--the flavour of Mr. Upmore's operations?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nAH ME!\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile a fact is under fifty years of age, surely it is early days to\r\ndespise it, as if in its dotage, and to traduce it as a mere tradition.\r\nYet this was already, at the time I speak of, done by the wiseacres of\r\nMaiden Lane to the great, and well-established fact, that the Cholera,\r\nwhen it first appeared in the year 1832, had avoided--as if it ran away\r\nfrom the feeding smells, and pursued the opposite--every house, where a\r\nman could say that he ever tasted our chimney-stack. On the other hand,\r\nit had followed strictly, as on any good map can be shown, the main\r\nlines of the sewage system, so far as these could yet be traced. For as\r\nyet, they were very bold in places, and then vanished, without a mouth.\r\n\r\nNow, if there had been any medical man, with power to think for\r\nhimself--as certainly some do, in every century--he might have chanced\r\nto put these two facts together, and breed a conclusion. And the\r\nconclusion must have been--increase your chimneys, issuing a fine\r\ndetergent smell, and abolish all drains, that bottle up and condense\r\ndestructive odours, sending them out with a fizz at the traps, to rush\r\ninto first-floor windows. But alas! there was no such man just then;\r\nand I fear that even now he is hard to find. Drain, drain, drain, was\r\nthe cry of the period; and ventilate all your drains, that every one may\r\nsmell them, and inhale a rich interest for his sewage-rate.\r\n\r\nMy father had never been blessed with any scientific education. He had\r\nthriven most stoutly, as his years increased, by dwelling in a feeding\r\natmosphere. In an unwise moment, he convinced himself, that a change of\r\ninhalation would improve his lungs; which were as sound as a bell used\r\nto be, in the days when people knew how to cast them. The only fault\r\nanywhere near them was, that from the increase of \"adipose deposit,\"\r\nthey had not the room to swing, that in thinner years they had. But he\r\nsaid to himself, and to my mother too--though she had the sense to say\r\n'nonsense'--that a daily influx of entirely fresh odours would enable\r\nhim to holloa, as he used to do.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see Tommy look so well,\" he asked, \"as when he came back\r\nfrom the inside of the whale? I require something of that sort; and I\r\nshall go, and smoke my pipe, every evening after tea, in the bracing air\r\nof Joe Cowl's drain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds very well,\" dear mother answered, \"but I do think, Bubbly,\r\nthat you ought to ask Dr. Flebotham first, what he thinks about it.\"\r\n\r\nTo me it seems a sufficient proof, how grand my dear father's\r\nconstitution was, that for more than two months he pursued this medical\r\ncourse, as he loftily termed it, without any visible harm to himself.\r\nAnd to the last moment of his life--so stout and solid was his faith in\r\nhis own mind--he declared that his illness had nothing whatever to do\r\nwith the cause we assigned for it. But after looking blue in the face\r\none Sunday, and suffering from cold hands and feet, he came home at\r\nnight, with a desperate headache, such as he had never felt before. My\r\nmother, in alarm, gave him brandy and salt; but he took the brandy, and\r\nleft out the salt. On the following day, he was terribly sick, and as\r\nblue as the men at the Indigo works; and Dr. Flebotham pronounced it a\r\ncase of aggravated English Cholera. He ordered strong measures to be\r\ntaken at once, hot applications, and a bottleful of chalk, with opium in\r\nlarge quantities.\r\n\r\n\"We must not be nervous, my dear madam,\" he said to my mother, who was\r\ncrying sadly; \"our dear patient has an iron constitution, and great\r\nstrength of will, and a rare fund of courage. Why, he won't admit even\r\nnow, that there is much amiss with him; and nothing will make him stay\r\nin bed. The recumbent position is the one he should preserve, to give\r\nour therapeutic course fair play; yet he keeps on calling for his boots,\r\nand would go to his work without them, if you left the door unlocked. We\r\nmust humour him, my dear madam; we must tell him that he shall go\r\nto-morrow to his most useful, and in many ways I am sure--delightful\r\noccupation; without which this neighbourhood would lose one of its\r\nmost--most pungent associations. Though Mr. Windsor certainly does, in\r\nhis smaller way, make a much stronger st--stimulate our olfactory powers\r\nto even higher action, is what I mean. And it seems to be now very\r\ngenerally admitted, apart from all incontrovertible statistics, I may\r\nindeed say that it has been proved, _a priori_, by our new lights, that\r\nthe chemical constituents, which you liberate by rapid evaporation, are\r\nfor hygienic purposes the very ones which Nature has omitted to supply.\r\nBut bless me, I have a lady doing well with twins! You will remember all\r\nmy directions. I shall have no time to dine to-day. I hope to look in\r\nagain, at six o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted his hat, and had scarcely time for me to run after him, and\r\nsay, \"If you please, sir, mother does so hope that you will not be\r\noffended, if we have a roast fowl on the table hot, when you come from\r\nthe poor lady, with the two babies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" replied Dr. Flebotham; \"that is the very first nourishment,\r\nyour dear father should take, in a solid form. He must not touch it\r\nto-day, of course; but a very small slice, quite cold, to-morrow. It\r\nshould be roasted this afternoon, and it must be excessively tender. It\r\nmight be as well, for me to judge of that myself. It should be a large\r\none, and yet very young--such as they call capons. Tell your dear\r\nmother, that I will try it for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thank you, sir, thank you! How very kind you are!\" I exclaimed,\r\nwith the tears coming into my eyes. \"Only please to be punctual at six\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\nHe made this promise; and made it good.\r\n\r\n\"Unless the case becomes complicated,\" said the Doctor, three days\r\nafterwards, \"with cardiac symptoms, or pulmonary, or possibly renal\r\nderangement, or any other resultant cachexy of the organisms; we may\r\nanticipate, my dear madam, a condition of gradual convalescence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Doctor, he is ever so much better already!\" my mother exclaimed\r\nimpatiently; \"he has ordered our Tommy to go himself, as far as the shop\r\nof the famous Mr. Chumps, and to try to be back by twelve o'clock, with\r\nthree pounds cut thick of tender rumpsteak, and two dozen of oysters\r\nfrom Tester's. And he is coming downstairs, to dine at one o'clock. But\r\nhe is so weak, that I shall have to help him. Deary me, what a thing to\r\nthink of! And a week ago, he carried me up, when I slipped, and hurt my\r\nancle. And I am not so light as I was, you know, sir. All that I leave\r\nnow to my son Tommy. He will never be good weight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very few medical men,\" replied the Doctor, with a pleasant smile at\r\nboth of us, \"would like to have the question of diet so completely taken\r\nout of their own hands. But as soon as therapeusis has reinstated our\r\npatients, though it be but a little, they are apt to think themselves\r\nquit of us. And then there comes the relapse, my dear madam; then there\r\ncomes the sad relapse; and the blame of it is cast on us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has taken a great many bottles, sir, such as I never could have\r\nbelieved;\" my mother answered sorrowfully, \"and it will be a little too\r\nhard upon him, not to let him have his change. How much will you please\r\nto allow him, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not an ounce, if I could help it--liquid nourishment for three days\r\nmore. Our poor stomach is still most delicate, and unfitted for solid\r\nfood. Restrict him, at any rate, to three ounces, and the like number of\r\noysters.\"\r\n\r\nThis was easier said than done. My father got through a good pound of\r\nsteak, and at least a dozen oysters; and after that, he felt so well,\r\nthat he had a pint of ale, and some of his healthy red returned to him.\r\nMy mother was so pleased with this, that she came to his chair, and\r\nkissed him; and he said,\r\n\r\n\"My dear, I thought at one time, I never should kiss you no more, nor\r\nTommy neither. But the Lord has shown Himself most merciful. And I don't\r\nsee, as a pipe would hurt me.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day, he was so much better, that at nine o'clock I went back to\r\nschool, and worked with a light heart; trying to make up for the work I\r\nhad fallen back with. And Mr. Cope was most kind to me, and said that I\r\ndid very well.\r\n\r\nI was let off, early in the afternoon, as mother had asked that I might\r\nbe; and with a good wind at my back, I made my way home, at such a pace,\r\nthat every one turned to look at me; for my lead had been laid aside,\r\nthrough father's illness, which was weight enough. My mother was equally\r\nshort of breath, with pleasure and excitement, when she ran out to kiss\r\nme. And she said,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tommy, your father is as well as ever, I do believe. He came\r\ndownstairs without a stick, and he wrote for an hour about something;\r\nand then he made a capital dinner, and slept a little in the afternoon.\r\nAnd Dr. Flebotham came and saw him, and said, 'My dear sir, not too\r\nfast! You are getting well, at a wonderful rate, but you must avoid\r\nexcitement. You are not quite out of our hands yet.' And then he turned\r\nto me, and said, 'We must be careful of the heart, dear madam. The heart\r\nhas had a sharp trial, and has borne it well; so far as we can see. But\r\nwe must not be too hard upon it, while its action is so weak. Any sudden\r\nshock, for instance, might have very grave results.' Your father began\r\nto laugh at this, until he remembered how very kind the doctor had been,\r\nand so skilful. And then he begged his pardon, and shook hands with him;\r\nand the doctor said, 'Not a bad grip that, Mr. Upmore, for a hand that\r\nwas like a swab, on Monday. Keep him quiet, and he will do. Ah, I shall\r\nboast of this case, a little; and I am sure you will help me, madam.'\r\nAnd so I will, Tommy, though I never can approve of being called\r\n'Madam,' like a Frenchwoman; for your dear father is in such spirits,\r\nthat he has taken an ounce of bird's-eye with him, and gone to his\r\nfavourite corner, by the tree; where the wind brings down the smoke so\r\nwell, and what the people who write in the papers call the 'pestilential\r\nfumes.' All he now wants to set him up, is that, and a quart of\r\nfresh-drawn stout; and he said, that he would wait for that, till you\r\ncame home from school to fetch it. So don't stop now, to do anything, my\r\ndear, except to put your slop-coat on, but run down to the tree, and\r\nhere is the eightpence--a couple of Joeys, as you call them--and there's\r\ngoing to be a crab for supper, Tommy; such a beauty, from a friend of\r\nyours! I'll tell you all about it, when you come back, and you shall\r\nhave his toes to suck, while you help me to do his cream.\"\r\n\r\nI did love a crab, I always did. And as the greatest delight in oysters\r\nhovers over opening them (for no delight does more than hover), so of a\r\ncrab, the finest hope is in getting him ready to be eaten, and in\r\ntasting stolen bits of him.\r\n\r\n\"You may look at him, Tommy,\" my dear mother said; and there he lay\r\namong lettuces, with his sweet legs clasped, as if in prayer for some\r\none to come and eat them, and his fat claws crossed, in resignation to\r\nthe mallet, or the rolling-pin.\r\n\r\nIt was not a sight to cause depression in the hungry human mind; neither\r\ncould that effect be got from a very well-browned backstone cake; which\r\nmother allowed me to smell, before she put it back, to crisp a bit. Oh,\r\nif she had only said, \"My dear boy, put your belt on,\" what a difference\r\nit would have made! But she never thought of it, any more than I did;\r\nand I always tried not to think of it.\r\n\r\nWith all these things to set me up, and a holiday and a half to come,\r\nout of the two ensuing days--for this was Friday afternoon--I set off,\r\nrather at a dance than walk, with my arms thrown up, and lungs expanded;\r\nand my broad-brimmed Leghorn giving flips at the wind, like a pigeon's\r\nwing; and the tucks, and gathers, and quilted flounces of my blouse\r\nlifting, and filling in the air, like clouds; and scarcely so much as a\r\nthread of my curls--as mother was fond of expressing it--that did not\r\nglisten in the sun, and hover like a crown of golden gossamer. Instead\r\nof opening the gate, I flew over it, and could scarcely keep between the\r\nwalls below, and I heard mother calling,\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tommy, dear Tommy, come back for your belt.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I tried to do it; but the breeze was behind me, and I must go on.\r\nThen, where the old weeping plane-tree stands, at the bottom of our\r\ngarden and enjoys the smoke, there was father on the bench, with his\r\nback against the trunk, and his red plush waistcoat on, and a long\r\n\"churchwarden\" in his mouth, and his favourite pewter waiting for the\r\nstout, and his face so bright at seeing me, that I called out,\r\n\r\n\"Father is quite well again! As well as he ever was, in all his life!\"\r\n\r\nAnd he said--\"Yes, Tommy, thank the Lord, I am. I've been thinking of\r\nyou all day, my boy. Come, and give me a kiss. Why, how wonderful you\r\nlook!\"\r\n\r\nFor the joy was more than I could bear; and instead of being able to go\r\nto him, I was lifted in a moment, from the surface of the earth, quicker\r\nthan I ever had gone up before. Now, the faster I go up, the faster I go\r\nround,--this seems to be a law of my ascents--yet I do not remember to\r\nhave felt much fear; and indeed there was little to be afraid of, unless\r\nit was a fall into our own chimneystacks. And in my vile stupidity, I\r\neven called down--\r\n\r\n\"Now, father, now will you believe at last?\"\r\n\r\nAlas, that my very last words to him should have been of low, and\r\nunfilial triumph! As I tried to look down at him, through the tree, to\r\nshow him how comfortable I was up there, I saw him rush out, with his\r\npipe in one hand, from the bower of the drooping branches; and he stood,\r\nwith his legs wide apart, and his hat off, and threw down his pipe, and\r\nrubbed his eyes with both hands, and then lifted them up, and cried--\r\n\r\n\"The Lord forgive me--that He hath made a son of mine to fly!\"\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished his exclamation, I could see him no more,\r\n(because of the way in which I was carried round,) and thus escaped the\r\nawful shock of seeing my own dear father fall. And before I could look\r\nagain in that direction, the briskness of the wind, which was\r\nnorth-west, had taken me so far, that the plane-tree came between, and I\r\ncould not see the fearful thing that I myself had done.\r\n\r\nYet somehow, or other, my mind misgave me, that I had left some harm\r\nbehind; and my weight grew greater and greater; as I saw no more of\r\nfather, who ought to have run up the hill to watch me, as people do to a\r\nballoon. This made me come down, at the bottom of our yard, when I might\r\nhave gone over the Regent's Canal. My flights are always cut short by\r\ngrief; but no other, by such a grief as this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCOMFORT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I came to know what I had done, through shameful levity, and\r\nheedlessness, and selfish triumph and greedy ways--for that crab had\r\nmuch to do with it--also through laziness, and, self-conceit, and the\r\nabsence of humble gratitude--which would have taught me to fall on my\r\nknees, instead of skipping up like a bubble--for many hours I lay and\r\ngroaned, and was much more likely to sink into the earth, than ever to\r\nmount into the air again.\r\n\r\nMy mother, in her first great shock and anguish, had called me a wicked\r\nboy, and said that I never ought to have been born; and I could only\r\nanswer--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how much I wish I had never been! But it was more your doing than\r\nmine, mother.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that I should have gone mad, after seeing the people come with\r\nfather's coffin, if I had been left in the house, to hear, and think of\r\nall that they were doing. For mother was not at all strong-minded, but\r\nkept on falling from one condition of heart into the opposite; and\r\nsometimes cried by the hour, and sometimes laughed at herself, for the\r\nsoreness of her eyes. And then it was so clear what father had been, by\r\nthe way that every one spoke well of him--so gentle, and generous, and\r\nkind-hearted, and living entirely for the good of others--that instead\r\nof being comforted, I cried more, to think that it was I, who had\r\ndestroyed all this. Several people took me by the hand, or patted my\r\nhead, and made me look up at them, all of them seeming to say the same\r\nwords, so far as I took heed of them--\"Don't fret, my boy, don't knock\r\nunder like that. It can't be helped now. Why, you did not mean to do it;\r\nand you must bear it, like a man, you know.\"\r\n\r\nBut all this only made me fret the more; my heart was so broken that I\r\ntouched no food, and I kept on asking every man, who looked at all like\r\nan authority, to please to get me sent to prison for seven years' hard\r\nlabour. Finding no one ready to do this, I banished myself to the\r\ncoal-cellar, and had a fresh cry with the maid, whenever she came to\r\nfill the scuttles. For no one else came near me now, my poor mother\r\nbeing unwell upstairs, and the command of the house handed over to\r\npeople, who called themselves her nearest relatives; and were so, if\r\nUncle Bill had met with a watery grave, as was supposed. These people\r\nwere the Stareys of Stoke Newington,--a widow lady, and her two\r\nunmarried daughters, beginning now to be old maids. Mrs. Starey was\r\nmother's half-sister, yearly fifteen years the elder; and so her\r\ndaughters were my half first cousins, and might have tried to help me.\r\nMother said afterwards, when she came to know of all their conduct, that\r\nthey did their best to send me after father; and for a very good reason\r\nof their own--if I were out of the way, they would be the nearest to\r\nher (if Uncle Bill were drowned, as they had reason to hope of him) and\r\nunder my father's will that might be of no little service to them. But\r\nit is not in my nature, to believe that they would act so. And even by\r\nseeming so to do, they lost all chance of everything. So much wiser, as\r\nwell as sweeter, is it in the long run for us, to be kind to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBut to dwell upon this, is hateful to me, and I cannot bear ill-will.\r\nMost likely the truth was simply this, that they had quite enough to do,\r\nwith mother lying ill, and father dead, and could not be bothered with\r\nme as well, and therefore, were glad to be quit of me, saying that a\r\nboy's grief soon forgets itself. And if I did not eat, it was because I\r\nwas not hungry; but time and youth would soon cure that. And perhaps\r\nthey might have done so.\r\n\r\nHowever, a man who was not in the habit of judging people harshly, the\r\nReverend St. Simon Cope, was highly indignant with them. As soon as he\r\nheard of our sad loss, he thought he had a right to come and help us, as\r\na minister of the Lord, though we were not in his District, and even\r\nbelonged to another parish. Mr. Cope was not at all the man to move his\r\nneighbour's landmark, and he knew that our parson (who never came near\r\nus) was largely Evangelical, as the people who went to hear him said. So\r\nthat Mr. Cope came to visit us, and was careful to put it so, not as a\r\nminister of the Word, but as my tutor in dead languages. In whatever\r\ncapacity he meant to come, no sooner did he see how we were placed, than\r\nhe threw parish boundaries overboard, and became the true minister of\r\nChrist. It is not for me to tell what he said; such matters are far\r\nabove me. And in truth it was less what he said than did, and his manner\r\nof doing it, that moved us. I had thought him a very cold man before--so\r\nlittle had he shown of feeling, as perhaps was needful among boys, but\r\nnow brave tears were on his firm thin cheeks; and I sobbed to look at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" he said, as he drew me forth from the coal which was all over\r\nme, and he never had called me \"Tommy\" before, which made it sound so\r\nkind to me; \"Tommy, you must get up, and wash, and take some food, and\r\ncome with me. Your dear mother is very poorly, and I have promised to\r\ntake you to her. It is the greatest comfort she can have; but she must\r\nnot see you look like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I been and killed mother too? Will mother die, sir, do you think,\r\nthe same as my father did, through me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear boy. Your mother will soon be well again, when she sees\r\nyou. She keeps on calling 'Tommy, Tommy!' But they say that you refuse\r\nto go to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"They told me, sir, that she never would bear the sight of me again, as\r\nlong as she lived. And she keeps on saying, 'Wicked Tommy, wicked Tommy,\r\nwhy ever were you born?' And I wish I never had been, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me for a moment, Tommy. Not one word of that is true. What\r\nshe may have said at first, I cannot tell, and you must not think of;\r\nfor she cannot have known what she said. I am sure, that you have a\r\ntender heart, and not a bitter one, my child. You have been afflicted\r\nheavily, and you blame yourself unjustly. Your only fault was sudden\r\nand thoughtless joy; and your mother sees that now. She wants you to\r\nforgive her, for she behaved unkindly, and she feels it. And if you wish\r\nto make her well, go up, and see her, and give her a kiss, and let her\r\ntalk, while you say little. Then she will get some sleep to-night; she\r\nhas not had a wink, since her sad shock. And to-morrow, she will be well\r\nalmost, and able to face her sorrow calmly, for her illness is more of\r\nthe mind than body. But go, and do what I told you first; and then I\r\nwill take you to the door.\"\r\n\r\nThus it was that this good man saved us, or me at least, from black\r\ndespair, and consequent insanity; for who can be sane, when hope is\r\ndead? Everything came to pass, exactly as he had foretold it; though I\r\nwill not attempt to describe what passed, between dear mother and\r\nmyself. Such matters are more for the heart, than tongue. Enough, that\r\nwhen she was quite worn out, with feeling things, and talking of them,\r\nshe fell into a smiling sleep, and I smoothed the bows of her night-cap,\r\nand tried not to believe how pale she was, and how many little sheaves\r\nof silver grief had set up in her fine dark hair.\r\n\r\nThen, when she was fast asleep, after having managed, with my help, to\r\nget through a calf's sweetbread--which Mr. Cope himself went all the way\r\nto Mr. Chumps, to fetch for us--and there was no likelihood of her\r\nwanting me till morning, my tutor said,\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, you look respectable; which could hardly be said of you just\r\nnow. Get your nightclothes, and whatever you want, and reverse the\r\naccustomed walk. Come with me to Kentish Town and I will bring you back\r\nin a day or two. But I cannot give you much time to get ready, and you\r\nwill have to walk six miles an hour.\"\r\n\r\nIf he had told me to take his hand, for an urgent appointment with the\r\nDevil, I should have done it, without two thoughts; but the only\r\nengagement he had to keep, was with his congregation. This was at eight\r\no'clock in the evening; and counting me, and a baby, there were eight of\r\nus there for the good of it, without including the minister. This made\r\nme think, with a turn of tears, of a story my father used to tell, of\r\nhis asking the Clerk at some church, why the Vicar had service at five\r\no'clock of an afternoon on week-days, instead of seven, or eight, or\r\nnine. \"Lord bless you, sir,\" the Clerk replied, \"if we was to go into\r\nthem long hours, we should never keep up with the time of day; five is\r\nour number at the outside, and no more.\" And although the joke was very\r\nsmall, it made me smile, as a bad joke does; when I never expected to\r\nhave another smile. The service, moreover, did me good; though I never\r\nheard a word of it.\r\n\r\nHe put me with the other boys, next day; and they were very kind to me,\r\nknowing the trouble that I was in. Jack Windsor was not there now;\r\nbecause Mr. Cope had plainly told his father, that he found it useless\r\nto go on with him, unless there were any downright need of a standard to\r\npass--and it must be a low one--for the Army, or for medicine, or for\r\nHoly Orders. For all lower purposes, his tutor said that he was quite up\r\nto the average; he could write and spell, quite well enough, and was up\r\nto the mark in arithmetic. But of Latin and Greek, if by great pressure,\r\nany more were ground into him, there was no chance of it staying longer,\r\nthan the time his nails (which he was always biting) would take to grow,\r\nif he left off. Mr. Windsor answered loftily--for, together with his\r\nwife, he had always taken Jack to be a wonder--that he considered his\r\nson too good, by a d--d sight, for any of the lines of life Mr. Cope had\r\nbeen kind enough to mention, and he would take away poor Jack that day,\r\nand put him into his own office; where he would learn life, instead of\r\nburying dead languages.\r\n\r\nNow, my dear father was in the habit of speaking his mind quite plainly;\r\nbut he never would have spoken like that, so rudely; and sooner would he\r\nhave bitten his tongue, very severely, I am sure, than have sworn, in\r\nthe presence of a parson!\r\n\r\nHowever, although Jack was gone, there were several fellows who had\r\nheard all, and a great deal more than all, about me, and my inborn\r\naffliction; and although they behaved with extraordinary kindness (being\r\nall on the way to be gentlemen) whenever they thought that I was not\r\nlooking, they were looking at me, with desire to form their own opinions\r\nsilently, and compare them freely, when my back was turned. For the\r\nresult of any peculiarity, less conspicuous perhaps than mine, is to\r\nattract attention; and that becomes a curse far greater, than the\r\nblessing of even the noblest gifts.\r\n\r\nWhen the Doctor was kind enough to spare my mother all the public pain\r\nof an inquest, by certifying \"sudden death, from failure of the heart,\r\nafter violent attack of Cholera,\" it might have been hoped, that\r\noutside strangers would have gone on their way, without meddling. So all\r\nright-minded persons did. They had their little talk among themselves,\r\nand expressed a very natural surprise, and agreed, or differed,\r\naccording to the peace, or pugnacity of character. And the matter would\r\nhave been a nine days' wonder, for the nine or ten beholders, but for\r\nthe prying self-conceit of a picker-up of news for the _Pratt Street\r\nExpress_, a penny paper, coming out on Saturdays. I will not speak ill\r\nof this gentleman; for I came to know him afterwards, and found him a\r\npleasant, and well-meaning man. He had no intention of inflicting pain;\r\nand he freely admitted, that a sense of duty compelled him to write,\r\nwhat he did not believe a word of, lest a rival journal should get the\r\nstart of his.\r\n\r\nMy tutor, Mr. Cope, sent a line to my mother on Tuesday, to inform her,\r\nthat he thought it would be, for very many reasons, wiser that I should\r\nnot be present, at the funeral of my beloved father. He did not tell me,\r\nthat it was to be that day; and I did not venture to ask about it,\r\nleaving myself entirely in his hands. My mother wrote back, as it\r\nafterwards appeared, that she quite agreed with him, and would not\r\nexpect me, until all was over. That same evening, he took me home, and\r\nasked me on the road, whether I could bear to hear a few words from him.\r\nI said yes, whatever he thought fit, for my heart was strengthened,\r\nwhile I held his hand.\r\n\r\nAfter words of religious consolation, which fell from his lips, as if\r\nfrom heaven--for the whole of his life was above this world, and the\r\npreface to a better one--he proceeded partly as follows, though I\r\ncannot put it quite as he did--\r\n\r\n\"From all that I hear, and allowing much for large exaggerations, you\r\nhave a remarkable gift, my boy; of which I heard something from my\r\nfriend, the Bishop. From my own observation, I know that your bodily\r\nframe is of wonderful buoyancy; as your mind was also, until this sad\r\ndistress, for the time, oppressed it. You have very good abilities, far\r\nabove the average, an extremely tenacious memory, quick apprehension,\r\nwith clearness of insight, and a love of whatever is elegant; which\r\nwould make you a very good classical scholar, with industry, good\r\nteaching, and above all, good health. That last is the point, which\r\nmakes me doubt the wisdom of pressing you much, in that way; although\r\nyou have never known a day of illness, until this trouble fell upon you.\r\nFor a body so light can scarcely contain the substance needful for hard\r\nwork. But your duty, as to that, will depend very much upon what your\r\nfather's orders were. He has left, (as I happened to observe) a\r\nstatement in writing of his wishes concerning you. One of the ladies in\r\nthe house had opened his desk, which had the key left in, while looking\r\nfor some paper, to boil the kettle. And I fear, that she would have used\r\nthis important paper, in ignorance of what she was doing at the moment,\r\nif I had not asked her to put it back. Then I locked the desk, and your\r\nmother has the key. It was not a will--your mother has his will--but to\r\nyou it should have all the authority of a will. These things are\r\nimportant; but what I would speak of is, from my point of view, more\r\nimportant still. You know, that whatever is given to us, is given for\r\nsome good purpose. Your mental gifts are not wonderful; although, as I\r\nhave said, they are above the average. But your bodily gifts are quite\r\nexceptional--I think I may say, though I have never studied physics--and\r\nfor them, you will have a good account to render.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how, sir, how?\" I asked with some excitement; \"as yet I have only\r\ncome to trouble, through all that. Please to tell me any way of doing\r\nany good with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"At present I cannot,\" Mr. Cope replied; \"but as sure as I am speaking\r\nto you, Tommy Upmore, the way and the means will appear, by and by. It\r\nis your duty, to improve your gift, so far as discretion and health\r\npermit, and to await the opportunity for some great good, to your\r\ncountry, humanity, or religion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nBOIL NO MORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat very evening, it was thought wise that the members of the Starey\r\nfamily, who had come so kindly to our aid, should return to the bosom of\r\ntheir own affairs, at that pleasant place, Stoke Newington. My dear\r\nfather was so widely known, and so loved and admired, by all the trade,\r\nthat he received an exceedingly large funeral. My dear mother told me,\r\nhow many high firms, nearly all of them wholesale, were represented; but\r\nI was pleased only because of her pleasure, or rather of the comfort she\r\ndrew from it. Moreover, there were ancient friends who came, as well as\r\nstill more of new date, and even some nephews of the name of Upmore,\r\nwith warm recollections of their dear Uncle, and hopes of a mutual\r\n(though posthumous) remembrance. Some of these had a good claim to be\r\nfed, in the hunger and thirst of unavailing sorrow--for none of them was\r\ndown for sixpence--and my mother, who had made a great effort to attend,\r\nnaturally left Mrs. Starey, and her daughters, to offer consolation to\r\nthese mourners. Among them, so deep a flow of sympathy was opened, that\r\nwhen Mr. Cope and myself came in, all the members of the Starey family,\r\nfor our three had fetched the residue, were (as Mr. Cope said\r\nafterwards) totally unable _stare_. This made it incumbent upon us to\r\nsend them home; and two cabs were ordered, with drivers of well-known\r\nintegrity, who received the whole of them, and their goods, on condition\r\nof getting their money, as soon as their job was discharged\r\nconscientiously. Only they must get it from the people they took home,\r\nand not from those compelled to pack them off. Like all other sensible\r\narrangements, this turned out to all reasonable satisfaction; though the\r\nStareys made a fearful fuss about it, grieving to go away at all, and\r\nstill more to do it at their own expense. They seemed to forget\r\naltogether, that when starvation stared them in the face, my father set\r\nthem up in a small candleshop, and supplied them for three months, on\r\nfull credit. But such is the way of the world; and what right have I to\r\nbe finding fault with it, while yet I continue to belong to it?\r\n\r\nWhen all this was over, and my mother gone to sleep, I opened the paper\r\nwhich she had given me; and with two of our own best candles lit, (for\r\nmy father would never have gas in the house, to ruin our eyes and to\r\ndisgrace our business) I read every word of it, sighing sometimes, and\r\nsometimes crying, to find how good he had been to me, who had paid him\r\nout so badly. And private as the matter was, the public, having taken\r\nsuch a kindly interest in me, might fairly call me ungrateful, if I shut\r\nthem out of all of it. Neither could that be done, without a confusion\r\narising between us. My dear father had clear ideas, as to his own will\r\nand way; and while he enjoyed himself much in the world, he carried on\r\nhis work to suit. He had written a letter to me, to be read when he\r\ncould no more talk to me; though he little thought, how soon that would\r\nbe. After things which I need not enter into, he proceeded with these\r\nwords, the whole being written in a plain round hand:\r\n\r\n\"You will see, my son, that I have worked hard, chiefly that you may do\r\nwell. If anything happens to me of a sudden, as may be the case, after\r\nwhat I have gone through, your mother will be well provided for, as she\r\nhas thoroughly deserved of me. Everything will be at her discretion; but\r\nI am sure that she will carry out whatever I wish concerning you. Cut no\r\ncapers with my hard earnings; I think you have too much sense for that,\r\nand I have taken good care to prevent it. None of your high society\r\nnonsense, which is not fit for a tradesman's son; but a steady rise in\r\nthe world, which is according to the laws of England. When the business\r\nhas been well disposed of, after completion of all jobs in hand,\r\naccording to the meaning of my will, you must go on with your\r\nschool-learning, at the Oxford colleges, where your friend Bill Chumps\r\nhas done so well. I have had a long talk with Mr. Cope, though I did not\r\ntell your mother of it, and he says that the money will not be thrown\r\naway; for it makes you anybody's equal, except among the nobility. You\r\nhave quite as good a head piece as Bill Chumps, if you will stick to it,\r\nas he has done; and you will see that it pays as well to boil down\r\nanimals, as to cut them up, when a man understands the business.\r\n\r\n\"When you have been through the Colleges, I intend to send you into\r\nParliament, that you may flabergast the Radicals. These are now making\r\nso much bluster, and getting their own wicked way so fast, that unless a\r\nfirm stand is made against them, no man's life will be his own, no more\r\nthan his land or money will. Robbery is the beginning, and robbery is\r\nthe end of it; and in the middle stands the man with the biggest pair of\r\njaws; and laughs, as he pockets all their thievery. If this goes on, a\r\nman had better lie down on his back, and rant all day, than labour hard,\r\nand be robbed of it. You have heard me talk of this, my son; but we have\r\nonly turned the first leaf yet; if Mr. Panclast gets the power he has\r\nset his stubborn heart on.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, I am not a wise man, nor even to be called a clever one; but I\r\nam of a sort that is going by, and perhaps will be missed hereafter.\r\nThat is to say, an Englishman, of common sense, and of fair play, and of\r\ntidy pride in his Country. All these are dragged in the dirt, by the\r\npeople now getting upper hand of us; and what will come of it? They will\r\ndrag themselves in the dirt, and their children; until our grandsons are\r\nashamed to say--'I am an Englishman.'\r\n\r\n\"Now mind you this, my dear son, though you have little chance of doing\r\nit, fight you, tooth and nail, against the white-livered lot of\r\nPanclast. Who is he, by right of gab, and words no more English than\r\nhimself, to upset the meaning of England, and the value of an\r\nEnglishman? A change will come, among the changes he is always starting,\r\nwhen people will try to respect themselves; and finding it all too late\r\nfor that, will turn against him, who has made it so. Then a very few\r\nmen, without possessing any quality at all wonderful, except their love\r\nof their Country, may lay hold of the sense of our disgrace, and make it\r\nserve for common sense. Then good-bye to Mr. Panclast!\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, I wish that I might live, to see a son of mine bear share, in\r\nsuch an act of righteousness. But I hear your mother with the dinner\r\nready, and I will go on about it, to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe abruptness of this conclusion made me as sad almost as anything;\r\nalthough I do not see how my father, writing so much in prophetic vein,\r\ncould have added anything of more precision, for my future guidance. I\r\nthoroughly understood his wishes, from the above brief sketch of them,\r\nand they agreed entirely with my own; so far at least as I had paid\r\nattention to such matters. Very few boys at school as yet, had made up\r\ntheir minds immutably,--as Sir Roland Twentifold had done already, and\r\nas every school-boy now does at once--what side in politics is the only\r\nright one, and how it may best be promoted.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had the time, and spirit, to look round and think again,\r\nwe could not help admiring, more and more, my father's wisdom. Not, by\r\nany manner of means, on account of the sum he had left for our benefit;\r\nthough this turned out to be three times as much as my mother, in her\r\nmost hopeful moments, had ever dreamed of finding it. It would be\r\nunnatural, if this had failed to increase her admiration; but she wished\r\neverybody to understand, that of that she thought nothing, in comparison\r\nwith subjects so much higher. When coarse people said--\"He has cut up\r\ngrandly. My dear lady, I congratulate you, and your most interesting\r\nson, with all my heart;\" she simply waved her hand, and said, \"Sir, you\r\ncan never have felt, as I do. Money is only an added trouble, when the\r\nguiding hand is gone, and gross exaggerations are made about it.\" And\r\nshe felt most deeply the great injustice, and cruel hardship, of paying\r\nfor probate a sum which made her weep again; because of the utter want\r\nof feeling, exhibited by the Revenue.\r\n\r\nHowever, all this had one good effect, perhaps contemplated by the\r\nRevenue. To some extent, it helped to turn the channels of her grief\r\ntowards indignation, as well as compelled her to look sharp, to baffle\r\nthe harpies of the law, by all the resources of honesty. And so well did\r\nshe manage, with the aid of Mrs. Windsor, (who became a very dear friend\r\nnow, and entered into all her righteous feelings) that much\r\ndisappointment, and many low suspicions, rankled in the stony heart of\r\nSomerset House.\r\n\r\nBut that, which my mother, and myself, and even the lawyer whom we were\r\nobliged to employ, found the most remarkable, was the skill and\r\nforethought displayed by father, in the settlement of all trade-affairs.\r\nI need not go into particulars now; any more than I need state exactly\r\nthe value of his net estate. Upon that point, there are always people,\r\nwho know ten times as much as the acting executor can discover, and are\r\nnot to be put down, by any process of sworn arithmetic; though as yet it\r\nhad not become the duty of any public journal, to measure the depth of a\r\ndead man's pocket, and tell the world, how he divided it. It will be\r\nenough, for those who care to follow my humble fortune, to know that\r\nKentish Town, Camden Town, Islington, and Ball's Pond were wrong--though\r\nthey all agreed about it, and, if any stranger doubted, doubled it--in\r\nputting it at considerably over the sum of a hundred thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Works, my father had provided that any Government\r\ncontracts, taken before his death, should be executed; and if any more\r\nwere offered, upon like terms, his Executors should accept them, so long\r\nas the Conservatives remained in office. But if, as he clearly\r\nanticipated, the Kingdom were over-run shortly by Radicalism and\r\nrobbery, the long-established firm of Upmore was not to be associated\r\nwith them. For they cut down contracts to the uttermost farthing, and no\r\nhonest man could work under them. In that case, our works must be\r\noffered for sale, upon certain conditions, and terms, etc., all of which\r\nproved his wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut nothing proved his wisdom, and clenched his words, with a\r\nsledge-hammer power, so much as the speedy result upon his proviso about\r\ncontracts. For fear of spoiling my education, and attaching a soapy\r\nsmell to me, it was strictly declared, that I must keep away from\r\nmeddling with a business, which I did not understand. This alone will\r\nshow the absurdity of the cries (now raised for party purposes) of\r\n\"soap,\" and \"dips,\" and \"where's the grease-pot?\"--with which I still\r\nhave to contend, when I rise to address our enlightened operatives. My\r\nfather had foreseen, I will not say all,--for no Jeremiah could have\r\never done that--but some of the mumbling, and blear-eyed decrepitude of\r\nthe British nation, which now sets us longing to be Boers, or Zulus, or\r\nanything but what we unhappily are. And this foresight was shown in the\r\nresult of the very next general election. The Radicals, (who are forced,\r\nby their own consciences, to set every other nation in the world before\r\ntheir own) came in with a rampant and blatant--the former to the friends\r\nof our country, and the latter to her foes--majority of six score at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the result made known, with a mighty flourish of trumpets,\r\nand a proclamation of the Millennium, than a private and confidential\r\ncircular was received by all substantial and enterprising Boilers. In\r\nit, the very ancient date of this typical firm was stated, as well as\r\nits rare advantages in position, and a thousand other things, including\r\na vested right in Government contracts, and a certainty of being bought\r\nout, at a very noble figure, by the Committee of the new Cattle Market.\r\nMoreover, ashes were in great demand, for a newly formed\r\nBuilding-Company would take a million loads at once, to erect a thousand\r\nsubstantial villas, entirely upon, and for the most part of them.\r\n\r\nEverything was going up and off, just then, like steam, and smoke, and\r\nbubbles mixed, as they used to be at our chimney-top. When a Liberal\r\nGovernment first comes in, it sets all knaves a-dancing; and even honest\r\nfolk prick long ears up, at the infectious fanfarade of the great\r\nRogue's March. There are certain to be, at once, bright summers, kindly\r\nwinters, and vernal springs; and autumn will stand so thick with corn,\r\nthat even the British farmer may have some hope, to get a gleaning.\r\nTrade shall flourish, bubble-companies abound; adulteration--alone of\r\nBritish industries,--be subsidised; and every foreign bullet, fired\r\ninto the back of an Englishman, shall go back, ton for ton, in gold.\r\n\r\nNational securities went up, with the certainty that they might be\r\nsacked, without outlay in defending them; and commercial circles squared\r\nthemselves, with the magic joy, which precedes the sure accomplishment\r\nof the impossible. Every sort of investment was in demand, and everybody\r\nexpected ten per cent. on his capital, without posting it. Even Mr.\r\nWindsor, a stout old Tory, fell into the rush of the Liberal flood, and\r\nlonged to buy my father's works; but my mother begged him not to do so,\r\nfor she would have been loth to see him disappointed; and the price was\r\nhigh. She told him of my father's caution; and he wisely saw its force.\r\n\r\nI am heartily glad, that it was so; for without that risk, our friend\r\nand neighbour lost as much as he could afford; when the usual relapse\r\nset in, from braggart talk, and swindling promise.\r\n\r\nBut while these were new, and bright, they served our turn, without\r\nfault of ours; and a Radical, of high faith, and sound cash, lost\r\nboth--I am very sorry to say--in carrying on our fine old trade.\r\n\r\nWhen these arrangements were complete, my dear mother carried out what\r\nshe knew to be my father's wishes--though he had not found time to state\r\nthem--by removing to a house upon Haverstock Hill, which stood in its\r\nown grounds, and saw as little of London as a \"genteel villa\" could wish\r\nto do; while the omnibuses passed our gate, every twenty minutes both to\r\nand fro.\r\n\r\nUnder the lawyer's advice, she bought this house, when she had tried it;\r\nand then she set up a cook, and housemaid, and a boy to do the knives,\r\nand a pony, twelve hands high, to carry me, when he went quietly, or to\r\npitch me off, when he was cross. And, whatever the weather was, every\r\nday, by 'bus, or pony, or afoot, I went to Mr. St. Simon Cope; to learn\r\nthe classics on week-days, and to hear him preach on Sundays. Until I\r\nbecame eighteen years old, and obliged to go to Oxford.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE SEAT OF LEARNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the very day before I went to Corpus College, Oxford, my mother did a\r\nthing she had never done, nor allowed to be done before. She took me to\r\nthe Standard-man, who was ready in fine weather then, at the corner of\r\nthe road, (where people rest in going up the hill) to tell them how much\r\nthey weighed and measured, for a penny apiece, and anything more they\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nMy mother gave him twopence, which she said was such a lucky sum, that\r\nit might save all the ill effects, though Mr. Cope had assured her that\r\nthere could be no harm done by it; and after great deliberation, with a\r\nview to sixpence, and measuring me round the chest--thirty-nine inches\r\nand a half, and levelling the top of my head at five feet six and\r\nthree-quarters (to which I added two inches afterwards), he put me on\r\nhis plate, and started backward in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Must be zummat wrong with this here,\" he said; \"no young gent, of that\r\nbigness, ever could draw under six stone six. There's plenty of grown up\r\npeople does; but then they be dwarfs, or mites, or scrummies. But you be\r\na fair-grown young gent, sir; taller, and bigger than the average of the\r\nBritish army, now-a-days; though not up to the size of the Peelers.\r\nNever can be true weight this. Ma'am, will you please step on, to try\r\nthe machine? Twopence pays for two, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am astonished, that you should think of such a thing,\" my dear mother\r\nanswered, as she turned away; \"I dare say, your machine is as right as\r\nusual. You don't buy, or sell, by it. Tommy, my dear, have your ticket\r\nprinted; and come after me to our carriage-entrance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I puts you at eighteen, ma'am, eighteen stone, every pound of it;\" the\r\nStandard-man called after her, and thereby lost the sixpence which I was\r\nholding in my hand for him; \"but as for this young gent, if he ain't\r\nflying Tommy, as I've heer'd of,--my opinion is that he ought to be.\"\r\n\r\nI was sorry to find, that the like opinion, or at least a suspicion to\r\nthat effect, had already reached Oxford, long before I did. Mr. Cope had\r\nmost kindly accompanied me, when I went up to matriculate; but certainly\r\nhe would have kept strict silence, as to my sad affliction, unless he\r\nhad thought it his duty perhaps, to speak of it confidentially to the\r\nTutor appointed me by the College; and that appointment was rather a\r\nformal than a real matter in my time, and would scarcely be made, till I\r\nwent into residence. I have known many men, who could not tell, which of\r\nthe College-Tutors was their special Mentor; though in that respect, I\r\nwas very lucky.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, I saw at once, when the College met for the term at\r\nChapel, that in some way or other, my fame had outrun me; and I could\r\nnot ascribe it to my mental gifts, which were by no means eminent. All\r\nthe under-graduates looked at me, with warm but not rude inquiry; and\r\neven the Dons, from their lofty thrones, vouchsafed me sidelong glances.\r\n\r\nAnd before very long, there was no doubt left; for the captain of the\r\nCollege Boat-club called upon me, quite early in the day, and apologized\r\nfor self-introduction, on the score of public duty. As behoved a\r\nfresh-man, I was rather nervous in the presence of one so exalted; but\r\nhe very soon set me at my ease; and as soon as the buttery was open, I\r\nsent for a tankard of Corpus ale, at his most kind suggestion. In a very\r\npleasant manner, he drank my health, and said that he saw a great future\r\nbefore me, if I would only go in for it. I begged him to explain; which\r\nhe did at once, after asking whether, as a Corpus-man, I would let him\r\ndrop all formality. Being proud to be called a Corpus-man--_a lucus a\r\nnon lucendo_ nuncupative--I assured him once for all of my good-will,\r\nand freedom from little prejudices. Thereupon he stood up, and asked me\r\nto do the same; and without further ceremony took me by the collar, and\r\nwith one arm at full length, held me in the air, without even putting\r\nhis lips together. At first, I was certainly surprised a little, having\r\nheard so much of Oxford etiquette; but the smile on his face reassured\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Noble!\" he exclaimed, \"even better than I hoped. Upmore, we shall be\r\nhead of the river, four nights after the eights begin. And the beauty of\r\nit is, that you look quite unlike a feather-weight.\"\r\n\r\nAll this was far beyond my comprehension; and he laughed again, when I\r\ntold him so.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course, what I mean is, that we want a coxswain, and you are\r\nthe very man for it. Our present man is two stone too heavy, as well as\r\na bad hand at the lines. And no man fit for it came up, last term.\"\r\n\r\n\"What lines?\" I asked, \"I can say the Georgics, and all the odes of\r\nHorace, and the three first books of the '_Iliad_,' except the catalogue\r\nof ships; but I don't know what a coxswain is.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll soon teach you the catalogue of ships,\" he answered, with a laugh\r\nat his own wit; \"and the Corpus ship shall be the first. And as for not\r\nknowing what a coxswain is, you are all the better for that, because you\r\ncan't have formed a bad style yet. Can you tell me exactly what your\r\nweight is? I should say well under eight.\"\r\n\r\nUpon this point I satisfied him, by producing the ticket of the\r\nStandard-man; which exalted me yet more in his esteem.\r\n\r\n\"Six stone six,\" he cried; \"and nearly forty inches round the chest! By\r\nJove, what a stunning coxswain! And another pull we shall get out of\r\nyou. With the wind astern, your head of hair will be as good as a\r\nlugsail; and with the wind ahead, we can reef it hard. My dear boy, what\r\na blessing you will be, to old Corp first, and then to the University!\r\nNo lectures to-day, as I suppose you know. I'll just go and tell the\r\nother men, what a wonderful piece of good luck has turned up; and then\r\nI'll go down to the barge with you. We'll have a day's practice with a\r\nfine old tub, and if you can't steer pretty fairly by Hall-time, you're\r\na much bigger muff than you look, and I'm no judge of\r\nfizzy--fizzyoggery. My name it is Green, as the poet observes; but you\r\ndon't see much of it in my eye. Ta, ta, Upmore, for half an hour. Don't\r\ngo out, till I come back. We'll fit you up with the water-toggery.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Green went down my stairs--for I lived in a garret of the highest\r\nquality--even quicker than I could have gone myself, though I gladly\r\nwould have challenged him to a race up; and he chanted as he went a loud\r\nsong of triumph; and all these things amazed me. What I had expected to\r\nfind at Oxford, from the look of the place, and from what I had heard,\r\nwas stiffness, formality, quiet, seclusion, and above all a Classic, and\r\nreligious air.\r\n\r\nBill Chumps, of course, could have told me better; but through a number\r\nof causes, I had seen very little of him lately; and the last time we\r\nmet, he had no idea that I was to go up so soon. Indeed, there had been\r\na little misunderstanding, between the Chumpses and the Upmores. We had\r\na sort of an idea, that since Bill got his double-first, and fellowship\r\nat Pope's Eye, he had not cared to come, and have his bit of dinner with\r\nus, altogether in the ancient way. Whereas Mr. Chumps, as I found out\r\nafterwards, sticking to business, as he always did, took it amiss--and\r\nunreasonably, I think--that when we went so high up Haverstock Hill, and\r\nthe gate was a good one to turn in at, he was never even asked to send\r\nhis cart, with the young man in blue, for orders. And what made it worse\r\nwas, that Gristles, his foreman, had set up in business on his own\r\naccount, not more than ten doors from the \"_Mother-red-cap_,\" which was\r\nall in a straight drive from our place. So that when he came, hat in\r\nhand, and \"solicited our custom,\" and old _Grip_ knew him, and was\r\ngreatly pleased to see him, my mother and I (without harbouring a\r\nparticle of disrespect towards Mr. Chumps) pledged our faith, to let him\r\ncall for orders.\r\n\r\nThere were other reasons as well, why Bill had only made a formal call\r\nupon us, since we came away from Maiden Lane. But, if I am to go through\r\nevery little in and out, the course of my narrative will be as crooked,\r\nas the voyage of the pair-oar tub, when I first held rudder-lines on the\r\nIsis. Only it is possible, that Miss Windsor, (now grown up into a fine\r\nyoung lady), may have had something to do with it; not only because of\r\nBill's tendency towards her, but because she happened to hear my mother\r\nsay, when his double-first was announced to us, that he might thank his\r\nfather's meat for it. No one should ever repeat a thing, said without\r\nspite, yet growing spiteful by mere repetition; even as transfusions,\r\nharmless at first, grow poisonous. And I am sorry to say, that Miss\r\nWindsor had not enjoyed, as she should have done, our going up the Hill.\r\n\r\nThis was the thing that pleased me most, of all I found at Oxford, that\r\nthere never was any ill-will amongst us, back-biting, or scandal about\r\none another. Every young man settled into his own set, whether by\r\nintroduction, or connection, taste, or accident, or whatever it might\r\nbe. If he took a dislike to any one--as young men ignorant of the world\r\ndo, more than we old stagers,--he could drop his acquaintance very\r\neasily, without saying a word against him; and no resentment was shown,\r\nor felt. The two men happened not to suit each other. Each was likely to\r\ndespise the other; but not to think any further harm of him. And when\r\nwe did take to one another, I assure you it was something like. Among\r\ncivilized people, there can be no warmer heart of friendship, combining\r\nthe weakness of the school-boy, with the set strength of the man. And\r\nthis was how I felt towards Green, who was the first to take me up; and\r\nthat is how he has felt towards me, even to the time I write these\r\nwords; and whatever I say about him, he will think as good as can be\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nWhen he took me down, to make a coxswain of me, his good nature, and\r\nhigh spirits, rendered my coaching, (as he called it) a pleasure, and a\r\npride to me. He brought No. 7, whose name was Brown; and after rigging\r\nme out in a manner, which made me think how proud my mother would have\r\nbeen to look at me, they put me on the hindermost seat of what they\r\ncalled a tub; but to me it appeared a most alarming vessel. However, I\r\nfelt no fear of drowning, any more than a cork does; and before very\r\nlong, I became quite happy. The beauty of the river, and the trees\r\nbeside it, bright with the April of their hopes, and the meadows, where\r\nthe grass began to dimple, as the light wind touched it, also the\r\nskimming of the boats around us, and the flashing of the feathered oar,\r\ntogether with the newness, and the freedom of the scene, exalted my\r\nspirits to the flying pitch.\r\n\r\nBut never again should I transcend the control of this earthly mass,\r\nthrough joy. Whenever the expansion of high spirits would lift me into\r\nthe soaring vein, there comes the remembrance of what I did to my dear\r\nfather,--and down goes all. Alas, all my rise into the air, since then,\r\nsprings from a darker, and a deeper source, and one more active in the\r\npresent age--honest wrath at roguery. But of that I knew nothing at\r\nOxford; and little, until I became, against my own desire, mixed up with\r\npolitical, and national affairs.\r\n\r\nWith these heavy matters to carry through, I dare not linger as I would\r\nlove, among the sweet memories of Oxford life. With a very few lessons,\r\nI learned enough to steer our Corpus eight, at practice first, and then\r\nin the momentous races, which began upon the 10th of May, that year. The\r\nfright I was in, that first evening of the races, was more than I can\r\ndescribe, and it makes me tremble now to think of it. But, with Green\r\nlooking at me, as calm as a statue, and Brown behind him smiling, I\r\ngathered up my courage, and did my best, and we made our bump below the\r\nGut. And I sent off a telegram to my mother, for the wires were just\r\nestablished then--\"We have made our bump\"--which the people in London\r\nturned into something ludicrous; but she knew from my letters what was\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\nI am told that Oxford men are now become addicted to total\r\nabstinence,--a craze unheard of in my time, save as a last resource for\r\nincurables. And even when we ran the Corpus flag to the top of the rope,\r\nas we did very soon, and held a great supper in the captain's room, to\r\ncelebrate this fine event, very few indeed of us could be fairly said to\r\nhave crossed the large boundary of temperance.\r\n\r\nMuch of the glory was ascribed to me, who had earned it, only by\r\ninanity; of which, as a lofty merit, there were then far fewer instances\r\nthan now. So often was my bodily welfare pledged, first in Champagne,\r\nand then in claret, and then in port-wine, and in rum-punch next, and\r\nfinally in Champagne again, that the fusion of physical and psychical\r\nemotions plunged me at length into the last new science, whose name is\r\n\"Hyle-Ideology.\"\r\n\r\nGreen, and Brown, and the rest of our oars were forbidden to exhibit\r\nmutuality, lest the Corpus flag should come down to-morrow; but the\r\nrudder fell under no such restrictions, and hard as I strove to maintain\r\na stiff helm, it was more than any hand, and head, could do. However,\r\nthey put me in a deep armchair, through the back of which they passed a\r\ncurtain-rope. Then they gave me a tassel in either hand, and lifting\r\nship and all, upon their heads, bore me with a favourable breeze to bed,\r\nwhile all of us chanted a nautical song. I steered the ship, throughout\r\nher course, with gravity so accurate, and so discreetly was she\r\nmanoeuvred, that she never once capsized. Now, this will show, whether\r\nany one of us could have had one drop too much.\r\n\r\nAfter this, my popularity, not only in the College, but throughout the\r\nUniversity, became so vast, that the difficulty was to get a bit of\r\nvictuals in my own room. All my friends enjoyed my simplicity of mind,\r\nand Maiden Lane views of the world; which were not at all Socratic,\r\nPlatonic, Stoic, nor even Academic. Moreover, they found me so glad to\r\nbe taught, and so grateful, and unpretending, that they taught me every\r\nkind of light learning they knew; so that I got on wonderfully, in every\r\nstudy, never contemplated by Founders, and Benefactors.\r\n\r\nHappily indeed for me, athletic contests were as yet most crude;\r\notherwise my speed of foot before the wind would have hurried me into a\r\nworld of troubles. We had a few College races, and even some rudiments\r\nof University work; but as yet nothing powerful, and glorious. How\r\nshould I have felt, after being chosen to run against Cambridge, for the\r\nhundred yards, the quarter of a mile, and the hurdle race, if there had\r\nbeen a stiff wind blowing in my teeth, at the starting-post? All this\r\nwould have probably fallen upon me, if the athletic contests had then\r\nbeen in vogue; and I might have won everlasting fame, or base disgrace\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nAs it was, I believed--though the whole is now forgotten--that I had\r\nestablished deathless fame, by steering the Oxford boat three times to\r\nvictory over Cambridge. It was natural perhaps that I should be chosen\r\nfor this distinguished honour, as the coxswain of the first crew on the\r\nIsis, and nearly two stone lighter than any other coxswain on the river,\r\nwhile looking as big as bow almost, and with some crews bigger. Yet from\r\nmy low self-estimate, I was taken by surprise, when the captain of the\r\nUniversity Boat-club wrote to me, and even begged me, for the sake of\r\nour University (which had been beaten three years running) to accept the\r\noffice. Will a duck swim, will a dog bark, will a frog hop, will a\r\nLiberal run away? Without a moment's thought, I accepted; and thus began\r\na course of triumphs for the stronger colour, which made the very cabmen\r\nshy of mounting the light-blue rosette.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nHEREDITARY LAWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat man has not described, or made believe to be describing, the race\r\nwhich the journals delight to call the \"Inter-University Contest\"? What\r\nmarvel, that we have sold our birth-right to an acephalous mollusk, when\r\nthe simple use of the tongue has passed into such headless mongreldom?\r\nSelf-consciousness compels such creatures to befoul their origin.\r\n\r\nI, Tommy Upmore, am not a bit better than any of my neighbours; not half\r\nso good as most of them--for I know my own faults, and I don't know\r\ntheirs, or at any rate don't want to know them--but what should I be, if\r\nI hearkened to a foe, who takes out of me every gift of God, and turns\r\nme adrift, to act by nothing but the standard, apes have formed for me?\r\n\"Truth is great, and shall prevail,\" he shouts; and to show her\r\ngreatness, proves that she never did exist till now.\r\n\r\nHappily, this stuff never troubled us, while I was at Oxford. We looked\r\nupon the chosen spirits of three thousand years, and more, as likelier\r\nto have left things worthy of our heed and sequence, than the\r\nhalf-taught men who spring up now, and by dint of smashing make a row.\r\nThe _pudor_, and _verecundia_, of youth were still existing; and we\r\nlooked up to our College Tutors, and University Lecturers,--men who had\r\nmade a life-long study of the work they dealt with, who attempted not to\r\ngloze our minds with universal smattering, but forced us to learn of\r\nsome few subjects what is knowledge, and what is not. And this was the\r\ndistinction Mr. Cope had first tried to drive into me:\r\n\r\nBut no man, not di-cephalous--as some of our ancestors have been,\r\naccording to the \"Scientists\"--can manage to serve two masters well; and\r\nbeing thus apprenticed to the river, I neglected the Aonian heights. My\r\nmother believed, and Mr. Cope assisted her in believing, that I might\r\nhave done very well in the Schools; though not so grandly as Bill\r\nChumps. But I passed all examinations fairly, with my solid grounding,\r\nand in the final one obtained what was called \"an honorary fourth.\" This\r\nsatisfied my ambition; though some cuts at me have been made about it,\r\nby people who knew no better.\r\n\r\n_Grip_, who had been, for so many years, my trustful and trustworthy\r\nfriend, and had taken the warmest interest in my trencher-cap (which he\r\ncracked up) and leading-strings (which he pulled off) was immensely\r\npleased with my bachelor's gown, although himself a Benedict. Throughout\r\nthe whole of my first term, Mr. Luker, the celebrated dogman, had kept\r\nhis brain at boiling-point (as he confessed most frankly, when I became\r\nhis admiring client) to make this noble dog his own. With the choicest\r\nliver, he waylaid him, and the sweetest female blandishments; and\r\n_Grip_, with either dewlap laughing, accepted all kind overtures, but\r\nenfeoffed himself to none of them. At last, a very large sack was made\r\nof tarred material, treble thick, and _Grip_ (overcome by his love of\r\nthe beautiful) was inveigled into it. But no sooner did he find his tail\r\nshut in, and feel the Philistines on him, than he rent their toils, like\r\na bursting shell, and flew among them, like a charge of grapnel.\r\nThereupon Mr. Luker came to me, and explained his disappointment about\r\nthe dog; and assured me, that if he could only have got him, he might\r\nhave made a hundred pounds of him--to go to Egypt, and do more than\r\nEngland can, put courage into the native animal. And he undertook, if I\r\nwould come to terms, to pledge his sacred word of honour, that \"neither\r\nhimself nor any other gentleman, in Oxford, or in London, should\r\ninterfere with the honesty of the dog.\" Alas, poor dogs, whose honesty\r\ndepends upon that of their master!\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Luker set before me, in words whose eloquence I cannot\r\nreproduce, the loss, not only personal but national, not only national\r\nbut universal, if _Grip_ were allowed to depart this life, without\r\nissue, legitimate and guaranteed. To him, the survival of the race of\r\n_Grip_ was of infinitely greater moment, than the continuation of the\r\nblood of Shakespeare, or Sir Isaac Newton. \"Men comes, and they goes,\"\r\nhe said, \"and the Dooce himself couldn't pick half the ins and the outs\r\nof them. But when it comes to dogs, Mr. Up, you can follow the breed, as\r\ntrue as their own noses is.\"\r\n\r\nSo we came to a compact,--that he, understanding this elevated subject\r\nthoroughly, should provide, for old _Grip_, as meet a consort as\r\nknowledge of the dog-world might produce; and that I should have the\r\npick of baby _Grips_, whenever I gave a certificate of race, as soon as\r\neach family was two months old. Thus I was enabled to fulfil old\r\npromises made to sundry friends, especially Sir Roland Twentifold, and\r\nJack Windsor. And I always knew, which pup to choose, by following the\r\nlaw of paternity among dogs, that the father growls most at his noblest\r\nson.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was good for us both, (for surely I was idle enough without\r\nhim) that my old friend, Sir Roland, had made up his mind, to have\r\nnothing to do with Oxford.\r\n\r\n\"When the institutions of the Country are in danger,\" he said, the last\r\ntime he came home from Harrow, \"a man in my position must not waste\r\nthree years. The very week after I am twenty-one, I shall be returned\r\nfor Twentibury. Toggins will vacate the seat, to order; I shall stick to\r\nit, till there is a vacancy for the county; and then we put Toggins in\r\nagain. Upmore, it is quite right that you, who have never been out of\r\nleading-strings, should go into them for three years more, and get among\r\nfellows who may do you good. But for me, it would be folly to waste\r\nthree years, and know less at the end than when I began. Why, at\r\ntwenty-one I should be a 'Junior Sophist,' or whatever they call a man\r\nwho has passed his Little-go; and I should have to wait a great deal\r\nlonger, if I meant to equal Chumps. I don't want to equal Chumps; he is\r\na wonderful fellow, and I mean to make him useful. But that is not my\r\nline of life. I don't care a penny for the Classics; but I care, every\r\npenny I possess, for the reputation of my Country.\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he came to see me at Oxford, (as he did, one Summer-term) his\r\ntalk was chiefly to the same effect. \"I am afraid you are a very lazy\r\nlot,\" he said; \"you don't seem to me, to have anything to live for,\r\nexcept to play cricket, or pull, or smoke, or spoon upon girls in\r\nconfectioners' shops\"--this was meant for me, who had taken him to see,\r\nwhat lovely brown eyes a very nice girl had, at a place where we ate\r\nices; but Master Roland (clever as he thought himself) little knew why I\r\nadmired those brown eyes; which I may, or may not, have time to explain\r\nhereafter--\"and when you have done all that, and yawned, and perhaps\r\nplayed a horn out of the window very badly, or cards yet worse, you can\r\ngo to bed, as happy as if you had done a great day's good. Pish! I am\r\nvery glad I never joined you. I want bigger games than yours.\"\r\n\r\nThis made me feel unhappy, as if I were despised; whereas the wise men\r\nof all ages have continually told young men, to take their enjoyment\r\nwhile they can; going far towards proving, at their own expense, that\r\nfolly has more joy than wisdom. But Sir Roland did not mean all this;\r\nand I took it for nothing but his way of talking; because he would have\r\nliked to be among us, but saw that he had thrown the chance away. My\r\nidea of life was, to spend as much of it for other people's benefit as\r\nthey permit--in which matter they are most contrary--and the rest for my\r\nown good, with honest enjoyment, and the certainty of better things to\r\ncome; if I do not labour chiefly to anticipate them here. And when I say\r\nmy own good, I mean, of course, the good of my Country, and relatives,\r\nand friends; without which my own could not very well exist.\r\n\r\nAnd after all, politics are a very small part of the general life of\r\nmost of us. Unless our character becomes involved, and our self-respect\r\ngrows downward, (like a troublesome toe-nail, that affects our walk) by\r\nreason of base things done in our name, against our consent and\r\nconscience; and unless we see things given away, which our fathers gave\r\ntheir lives for; and unless we are plagued by nursery Acts of\r\nParliament, very good for the unbreeched--it matters but little to most\r\nof us, whether the First Lord of the Treasury be a Conservative, or a\r\nLiberal. With such things I never troubled my head, even when I grew to\r\nbe a Bachelor of Arts; until Sir Roland Twentifold came driving me about\r\nthem, and his strength of will was tenfold mine.\r\n\r\n\"Roly,\" I said, when I had kept my \"Master's term,\" and enjoyed it\r\nrarely among old friends, without a stroke of work; \"you will never get\r\na bit of good out of me. I am not eloquent, I have no gift of speech; I\r\ntried it at the Union once, and when everybody cried out, 'Bravo,\r\nTommy!' I could only laugh, and thank them, and sit down. If my father\r\nhad been a Rad, when he brought me up, (as he had been in his early\r\ndays) no doubt I should have been a sound Rad too. And for that matter,\r\nso would you, I do believe, if you had been brought up to it. I know at\r\nleast a dozen very honourable Rads, some of them very clever fellows\r\ntoo; who would no more think of doing anything mean, if they had the\r\ngovernment of the Country, than you would yourself, if you had it all\r\nyour own way. Then, why should we cry out, before we are hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it's too late to cry out, when we are. What you say is true\r\nenough, my good Tommy. Those friends of yours are all honourable enough,\r\nindividually, I dare say--though the less you have to do with them the\r\nbetter--but when they fall under the dominance of party, what becomes of\r\nall their scruples? They sink their own wills, they efface\r\nthemselves--according to the expression now in vogue--they fall under\r\none imperious mind; and no difference is left between black and white.\r\nMy father kept hounds, as you have heard me say; and when I was a small\r\nboy, I rode my pony with them. There was one most obstinate old stager\r\nof the pack, who had a wonderful nose while he was young, and had taken\r\nthe lead of all of them. But when he grew old he went all abroad; yet\r\nthe rest had to follow him all the same, on a false scent, more often\r\nthan a true one. At his dictation, all the younger ones, from habit,\r\nsank their own better perceptions, and loyally rushed after sheep, or\r\ndonkeys, or anything he gave tongue to. But all these things we can talk\r\nof better, when you come down; as you must, next month. You have only\r\nbeen once to us, since you lost your father, more than five years ago.\r\nAnd my mother always says, when I go home, 'Have you brought Ariel with\r\nyou, at last?'\"\r\n\r\n\"How wonderfully kind she has always been to me!\" I answered, liking\r\nsoft thoughts, better than the hard flash of politics; \"if she wishes to\r\nsee me again, my duty is to go to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is one way of putting it! A painful duty, my dear Tommy? We\r\nwill try to make it a pleasant one. You can't shoot; though people shoot\r\nat you, when you take a flying fit. Come down in July, and stay three\r\nmonths, and I'll make you a first-rate shot, by the time the partridges\r\nare ready. You learn everything, like smoke, you see. I'll back you to\r\nbeat Counterpagne on the first; though he has been at it all his life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget one important point,\" I answered, hoping that the objection\r\nmight not prove fatal. \"When a gun goes off, it kicks very hard, they\r\ntell me. And it seems too probable, that it would kick me over.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it, if you lean forward. You are easy to take up, but you\r\nare not at all easy to put down, Master Tommy. You are as quick as\r\nlightning, to begin with. Nature has provided you with that, no doubt,\r\nto atone for your want of thunder. Don't be always running down\r\nyourself. There are very few fellows who can do what you can; even if\r\nyou have altogether dropped your wings, through the gross feeding of\r\nthese Oxford butteries. But I mean you to put on your wings again. I\r\nhave a whole lot of things for you to do; and flying is a most essential\r\npart. Professor Megalow is coming down; now that I am of age, and all\r\nthat sort of thing, he can stop at the Towers, as long as he likes. I am\r\nsorry to inform you, that he is a Rad. But a man of his size may be\r\nanything he likes, without being any the worse for it. I intend to\r\nconsult him about you, Tommy, how we may launch you on the clouds\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not seen him for years,\" I said; \"if he is going to be there,\r\n'twill be enough to make me fly again.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nA COUNTY MEETING.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow easy it is, for a good-natured man to be taken for the opposite; and\r\nyet how hard for ill-natured people, to put on the guise of kindness!\r\nNot that the world is distinctly divided into those two classes; for the\r\ngreater part of it have mixed natures, and are operated on by the\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\nThere scarcely could be any one with a better nature, than Sir Roland\r\nTwentifold. He was large-hearted, quick-hearted, soft-hearted too, (when\r\ntouched at the proper fibre) and yet any Radical stranger who met him,\r\nwould have thought him the opposite of all these. He had private, and\r\npersonal motives, (which he disdained to speak of, as being too small;\r\nyet perhaps they were the spring of everything) for strongly abhorring\r\nwhat he called, \"the faction now ruining this Country.\" I never could\r\nbelieve that any faction would be so factious, as to harm their Country,\r\nknowingly, and of set purpose. Yet this he believed, from the bottom of\r\nhis heart; and it cannot be denied, that their words, and deeds, have\r\ngone far to bear out his assumptions.\r\n\r\nIt must have been the third week in July, and the prime of a glorious\r\nsummer--such as we never are blest with now--when I had the happiness\r\nof visiting, once more, the noble Towers-Twentifold. The woods, and the\r\nhills, and the meadows, and even the hollow places that faced the north,\r\nhad cast away the shivers, yet preserved the freshness, of the cooler\r\ntime of growth. Many of the fields were lined, or hillocked, with the\r\npeaceful tide of hay, which is late in coming into harbour there; while,\r\nupon the forward slopes, green corn was wavering into fluent pathways\r\nfor the wandering wind. And among all the view of the land, flowed in\r\nthat faint reflection from the distant sea, which looks as if light\r\nthrew a shadow of itself.\r\n\r\nBlessed was this neighbourhood, to have no railway, out-shrieking the\r\nsea-gulls, out-reeking the whale, and even out-roaring the sea in a\r\nstorm! The station was so far away, that good sound people let their\r\njourneys depend very much upon the weather; which is the proper thing\r\nfor them to do. And after the abominable rush of London--which never\r\nshould make any fuss about smells, that it never has time to blow its\r\nnose at--there came into my heart such a quietude of comfort, that I\r\nbegged the groom, who was sent to fetch me--Sir Roland being absent at a\r\ncounty meeting--to drive as slowly as the horse would go.\r\n\r\nFor several years now, I had been as happy as anybody ought to wish to\r\nbe. I had plenty of money, (through my father's labour, and my mother's\r\nliberality) to keep myself, and to help a friend, without wasting any\r\nupon that third desirable object (in Solon's opinion) the punishment of\r\nan enemy. I was blest with plenty of friends, but cursed as yet with no\r\nsingle enemy; and though many of my friends were poor, they had too much\r\npride to sponge on me, beyond the mere fringe of a Turkish towel. I had\r\nliked a great number of girls, here and there, in a strictly moral and\r\nmoveable way, so as never to get any heart-ache about them, any more\r\nthan they got it about me. And as for Polly Windsor, who had seemed to\r\nbe marked out, by the finger of commerce, as my bride, she had certainly\r\nshown herself kind and obliging, after we moved into our new house, and\r\nhad helped my dear mother to spend much cash, in adorning it with\r\nhideous devices.\r\n\r\nBut, as soon as Bill Chumps came back from Oxford, with his\r\ndouble-first, and his six feet two, to read for the Bar at Lincoln's\r\nInn, she became too personal--and I might say bodily--in her sentiments,\r\nto suit my taste.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to grow any more, Tommy?\" she had asked, as if love were a\r\nquestion of inches; \"why Mr. Chumps must be a foot more than you are;\r\nthough you have got your heels three inches high.\"\r\n\r\n\"On account of the curve of my foot,\" I answered; and she knew what I\r\nmeant, though too delicate to say it; for her feet were like a pair of\r\nsoles, without any right and left to them. And this made another little\r\nbreach between us.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there was now in my mind, as there always had been\r\nindistinctly, the remembrance of a pair of sweet brown eyes, which used\r\nto grow bright, and dim, with mine, in the joy, and grief of early days.\r\nI knew, without thinking about it, that Laura Twentifold was far above\r\nme; far out of sight beyond poor me, in birth, and beauty, and goodness.\r\nAlso I knew, that she was intended to marry her cousin, the Earl of\r\nCounterpagne; for the good of the family, and of the kingdom too. None\r\nthe more for that, could I help longing to see what she was like, now\r\ntime was come for her to be quite a full-grown young lady, with a will\r\nof her own, as I heartily hoped, and a kind recollection of her old\r\nplayfellow. Since the time of the whale, I had never beheld her, except\r\nin a great many dreams of the night; because she had been sent from\r\nhome, to learn foreign language, and every accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe dinner-bell was ringing, as we drove up to the door; for her\r\nladyship held by the good old fashions, and would have no new-fangled\r\ngong in the house; and I had only a quarter of an hour, to make ready.\r\nSo that I was not at all done up, to my liking, failing to find--as\r\nalways happens in a hurry--some of the things that were most becoming.\r\nThis flurried me, doubtless, and heightened my colour, so that I blushed\r\nat my own red cheeks. But anything was better, as my own sense told me,\r\nthan to keep ladies waiting, for an unimportant young chap like me.\r\n\r\nWhen I entered the drawing-room, Lady Twentifold, looking more\r\nbeautiful, and sweet than ever, came up, and took me by both hands, and\r\nwith all the friendliness of early days, touched my forehead with her\r\nsmiling lips. At her graceful condescension, tears gleamed in my eyes;\r\nand she took them for the thanks I could not utter. Then Professor\r\nMegalow, with his gentle stateliness enhanced by the silver now\r\nappearing in his curls, shook hands with me cordially, as if I had been\r\nhis equal, and said some of the pleasant things, which were always ready\r\nfor his pleasant voice. I could not help feeling ashamed of myself,\r\nhaving never done anything to deserve such friends.\r\n\r\n\"We must call him 'Ariel' no more, I fear,\" Lady Twentifold said to the\r\nProfessor, with a smile; \"we must get you to invent a new name for him,\r\nout of the depths of your palæontology.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we must allow him to name himself; as some of my animals have\r\nhad to do. What shall we call you, my old confederate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everybody seems to call me Tommy,\" I answered, finding this the truth;\r\n\"and it sounds more natural than any other name. One of the examiners\r\nforgot himself, and called me Mr. Tommy, in the Schools, instead of Mr.\r\nUpmore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come, Mr. Tommy,\" Lady Twentifold replied, \"and let me show you an\r\nold friend, whom you have not seen, I think I may say, ever since you\r\nwere my Ariel. Laura, do you know who this is?\"\r\n\r\nThe loveliest maiden the eye could light on, even in a flight among the\r\nangels, came forward from the shelter of the summer curtains, and looked\r\nat me, with shy surprise. It was a very short look; and yet it has\r\nlasted in my heart all life, and will last there through all future\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nEach of us wanted to say something; but neither knew exactly what to\r\nsay. So we only shook hands, and waited for the easier times of talking.\r\n\r\n\"We never wait for Roland, now he is so busy,\" our hostess said to the\r\nProfessor; \"he has scarcely time to feel the necessity, which others\r\nfeel, for nourishment. When he is an older politician, he will not live\r\nentirely on politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"Zeal is the great point, in any pursuit,\" he answered, as she took his\r\narm; \"unhappily it cools too often, before it is replaced by habit. But\r\nin his case, it will not be so. He has more than zeal; he has\r\nconstancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes, I wish that he had less;\" Lady Twentifold answered, with a\r\nlittle sigh, while her daughter came for my timid guidance; \"when there\r\nare so few of us, it seems hard that the public should claim so large a\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\nWe dined in a snug little room, and at an oval table I believe; for our\r\nsmall company would have looked forlorn, in the grand old dining-room.\r\nFor my part, though the Professor talked, as he did when he chose, most\r\nwonderfully, with rapid turns of pleasant thought, and leaving, for\r\nslower minds, suggestions to bear fruit at leisure, I remember nothing\r\nbut the smiles, and gaiety, his bright humour spread. The smiles\r\nespecially I rejoiced in--not my own, but sweeter ones, which thus I had\r\nthe happiness of watching, and sometimes of sharing in. Are not all\r\nsweet smiles the offspring of a sweet reflection; and therefore can they\r\nbe complete, until themselves reflected? Beautiful Laura, at every\r\nsmile, looked up for me to share in it; and thus our eyes made bright\r\nacquaintance, and our minds went on together, without any need of words.\r\nAnd every now and then, she asked me some little question about myself,\r\nwhich made me proud to be myself, for the sake of such fair memory.\r\n\r\nJust when the dinner was over, the youthful master of the house came in,\r\nand after the proper apologies, told us that he had glorious news that\r\nday. Toggins, the member for Twentibury, had been brought to see the\r\nerror of his ways at last; being led, however lamely, to wholesome\r\nrepentance, by a very serious attack of gout. His first righteous act\r\nhad been to sit up in bed, and sign an undertaking to apply for the\r\nChiltern Hundreds, at once; so that the writ might be issued, before the\r\nProrogation in August. According to Sir Roland, he ought to have made\r\nthat application a year ago and more, in fact upon the very day when the\r\nheir became of age. But Mrs. Toggins, who had a good deal of money,\r\nliked the M.P., behind his name, and urged him to forego the only\r\nhonourable course. What can be done with a warming-pan, that slips out\r\nof its handle?\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, mother! He can never get out of that;\" my dear friend\r\nshouted, as he cast an unfolded letter among the glasses; \"I got hold of\r\nhis doctor, and his parson too. Could his Colchicum work, when his\r\nconscience would not? And between us, we beat the old lady altogether;\r\nand she now declares, that it is all her doing. Ah, that's what I call a\r\ncounty meeting. Something like 'organization' there! He began to get\r\nbetter, with alarming rapidity, as soon as the weight was off his mind;\r\nand I promised him the best glass of port he ever tasted, if he would\r\ndine here, on the day of my return. Then I thought it safer, to set off\r\nwith this. I have had my dinner, let me drink his good health.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Megalow was delighted with all this young enthusiasm; for\r\nanything natural always pleased him, whether it were Radical, or Tory.\r\nAnd Sir Roland's sister, who loved him dearly, got up, and embraced, and\r\nkissed him. But his mother tried vainly to look glad, and said the very\r\nthings she thought and felt, according to her loving, and simple nature.\r\n\r\n\"I am trying to be glad, for your sake, Roly; because you have so long\r\nwished for this. And no doubt it is right, that a gentleman should keep\r\nhis promise, as he has done at last. I suppose that the Country has a\r\nclaim upon you, as you say, and feel so deeply; at the same time, I\r\nthink it might have left you to me, for a few more years at least. There\r\nis nothing particularly bad going on just now, that I am aware of; and\r\neven Mr. Panclast seems to promise a great deal more mischief, than he\r\ncarries out. If there were any great national disgrace for you to stop,\r\nI would gladly spare you, even if I had to sit up all night. But when\r\nthere is nothing--not even for a man to marry his sister--why should you\r\nwork so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" said Sir Roland, \"it is too late to begin, when a thing is\r\nover. The most reckless lot that ever held the reins, or flung them on\r\nthe horse's back, and lashed him, are now in power--and what sort of\r\npower? The power to go at a furious pace, without caring how many people\r\nthey drive over, or what neck they break, except their own. No power to\r\nstop, and consider their course, or regard the ancient landmarks, and no\r\ncare how they smash up a fine old coach, not a stick of which belongs to\r\nthem. Professor Megalow, I beg your pardon. I forget things, when I get\r\nexcited.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is better than remembering them;\" the Professor replied with a\r\ncourteous bow; \"we have never had a great legislator, who did not begin\r\nwith strong prepossessions.\"\r\n\r\nThis, and the sense of his own mistake, brought the young host to his\r\nmanners again. The ladies departed gracefully, and we had no more\r\npolitics; but a great deal of far more interesting things, including\r\nsome soft sweet songs from Laura; until my friend took me, to smoke a\r\npipe with him, in his own little room, before going to bed.\r\n\r\n\"Now, we can say what we please,\" he began, after giving me his own pet\r\nmeerschaum, which he had begun, in strict confidence, at Harrow. \"What\r\nstrange things we do come across! How can such a great man as the\r\nProfessor ever have become a Liberal? I shall spare some of them, for\r\nhis sake, while I slash at the party in general. To my mind it seems\r\nalmost to prove, that some of them must have high principles, though\r\nthey keep them out of their performances. No, thank you, no cigars for\r\nme! A pipe soothes me, a cigar only irritates; I like to see the fruit\r\nof my own works, not to cast away the root, when done with. And now, my\r\ndear Tommy, the next job is to bring you in for North Larkmount.\r\nLarkmount is a fine constituency, consisting of honest freemen, or at\r\nleast they always turn the poll. But we can't get you in, just at\r\npresent, I'm afraid. However, that won't matter much. I shall not say a\r\nword this Session; but see how they do things, and get acclimatised.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want to get in at all,\" I said; \"or at any rate, not for a\r\nlong time yet. I would rather enjoy myself, for a year or two, and be an\r\nM.A., before being M.P.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so. You must buckle to, at once. I have arranged it all, with the\r\ngreatest care. Not another Session must be lost, before I have you, and\r\nChumps, to back me. The enemy have several evil works on hand, and they\r\nwill invent a lot more in the holidays. I shall have in Chumps for his\r\ngreat abilities; and you, beloved Tommy, for your flying powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not like that way of putting it at all;\" I replied, with my usual\r\nfrankness. \"I cannot fly now, any more than you can. And if I could,\r\nthey would not let me, in the House of Commons.\"\r\n\r\n\"That shows how much you know about it. If you had been up in the\r\ngallery, as I have, to see what they were at, night after night, you\r\nwould know that they were as larky as a lot of schoolboys. I got\r\nProfessor Megalow down here, as he thinks, because of the _pelvis_ (or\r\nwhatever he calls it), of a mighty dragon, in the cliff at Happystowe.\r\nBut really, and truly, my dear friend, that he might put you on your\r\nwings again, or else show me the proper way to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have behaved very badly,\" I exclaimed, \"and not like a friend,\r\nbut a selfish politician.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nOLD BONES, AND YOUNG ONES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much was I vexed at this idea, that Sir Roland Towers-Twentifold\r\nvalued me, only as a flying puppet, a machine to be started from a\r\nspiral spring, or a little boy's coloured balloon, that I assure you,\r\nalthough I was on a bed soft as a dew-cloud--for we did not lie upon\r\ncast-iron yet--scarcely a wink of sleep came near me, without being\r\nscattered into a fire-wheel of dreams. If it appeared to me a small\r\nthing--as it did in modest moments--that I should be brought from\r\nLondon, like a tailor to take orders, or a fellow to exhibit Punch, and\r\nJudy--yet how could I reconcile it with the fitness of things, that\r\nProfessor Megalow should be tempted, with the very biggest dragon for\r\nhis bait, to come down, upon the really ignoble errand of flipping me\r\nup, like a pith-ball of elder, between the plates positive and negative.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought of consulting him, as to what I should do in the\r\nmorning; for who else could advise me, so kindly, or so well? But I saw\r\nthat his counsel was not to be had, without a disclosure of everything;\r\nand I had no right to tell him of his own \"mission\" here. So that on the\r\nwhole, I was compelled to act, (as I nearly always find to be the case\r\nwith me) by the dim light only of my own perceptions. \"I have no right\r\nto make any scene,\" I thought; \"neither is it possible for me to leave\r\nabruptly, without giving reason; Lady Twentifold has been most\r\nwonderfully kind to me, ever since she first saw me; and she can have no\r\npaltry political motive, such as this one-idea'd Roland has. And then\r\nthere is beautiful Laura, sweet Laura--I suppose I ought to call her\r\nMiss Twentifold, but consider the years I have known her--there never\r\nhas been anybody like her, since the days of Paradise, and how\r\ndreadfully rude I should appear to her! Of course, I must never think of\r\nher at all, any more than I might of the pole-star. Still, I should like\r\nher to think of me, if she ever deigns to do it, with all kindness and\r\ngood-will. Ah, ha! Lack is the luck! I am a most unhappy fellow. My\r\nmother said once, that I had no right to be born; and who should know so\r\nwell as she?\"\r\n\r\nBut before I had quite finished \"doing my hair\"--as the ladies express\r\nit, and mine very often took almost as long as a lady's to do, because\r\nof there being so much of it,--Sir Roland came thumping my dressing-room\r\ndoor, and with his usual impetuosity, rushed in.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, shake hands, like a man,\" he exclaimed, \"or I'll pull all your\r\nhair out of trim again. You cut up, as rough as a clinker, last night;\r\nthe first time I ever saw you out of temper. However, a new hope sprang\r\nup in my breast. Do you know what you did, as you went along the\r\npassage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I remember nothing, except that I said to myself--'I am not a\r\nmachine, and I won't be treated as a machine. If he only wants me as a\r\nJack in the box----'\"\r\n\r\n\"A Tommy in the box, you mean. No, no. You must lay aside all those\r\nsmall ideas. It is not I that want you, it is your Country, your noble,\r\nbut outraged Fatherland. Those are the sentiments that should exalt you,\r\ninstead of petty wrath against your ancient friend. But I see a new\r\nprovision in the laws of gravitation--which Panclast will bring in a\r\nbill to abolish, before we are very much older. In your anger, you tried\r\nto stride loftily, as behoves the most illustrious of all coxswains; but\r\ninstead of so doing, you never touched the ground! You flitted, without\r\nany coarse agency of legs; like the ghost of Achilles, at the great\r\ndeeds of his son.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought there was something unusual about it,\" I answered,\r\nwithout any heroism; \"but my mind was so occupied with its wrongs, that\r\nI never noticed how I walked.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is another most excellent sign. Temporary absence of perception.\r\nThe main point will be, to enlarge the indignation--to ennoble it, to\r\nmake it national, instead of individual. Your course of reading at\r\nOxford--even though you read nothing there at all, except novels--has\r\nproduced, in your system, a fundamental change. In your early days,\r\nexhilaration carried you over the heads of the public. You have seen too\r\nmuch of the world by this time, to be exhilarated any more. Joy can no\r\nmore elevate you; and Nature (rejoicing as she does in exceptions) has\r\nfound a fresh way, to keep you in the list. But a perilous turn of the\r\nbalance for you, I am sadly afraid, dear Tommy. Joy is not frequent,\r\neven in the days of boyhood. But indignation--oh, Tommy, Tommy, what a\r\nlot of lead pipe you must carry round you, if you once become liable to\r\nleave the earth, every time you see wrong being done upon it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Clear out,\" said I; \"I want to finish dressing, and not to be plagued\r\nwith immoral reflections. If you want to spare me all that lead pipe,\r\nregulate your own conduct first, by the lofty standard you want to bring\r\nme up to. That little business about Toggins, for instance, might force\r\nme to put on a pound or two; though a lily-white act, in comparison with\r\nthe things you do at election-time.\"\r\n\r\nTo enter into that matter did not suit him, while in his present fine\r\nvein of morality; so that he only made a face--being still a boy, as\r\nmuch as I was--then he pulled in his tongue, and tapped his lips, and\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n\"Not a word about that, to the Professor, mind. I have boasted to him,\r\nabout the purity of everything; and he has promised to come and be\r\ngratified. And gratified he shall be, by everything that is noble. Now\r\nlook alive! I shall have a busy day to-day. I mean to go canvassing,\r\nthough of course I need not do it. But I am sure, that the women would\r\nbe angry, if I didn't; and with this clash of changes coming, it is not\r\nonly wise, but necessary, to keep them on our side, as they are by\r\nnature. If nothing else showed the Conservative cause to be the true\r\none, it would be enough that the women always take to it.\"\r\n\r\nWith this, which moved me a great deal more than the rest of his\r\narguments put together, he set off to shave himself, which he insisted\r\nupon doing, now and then, with a competent eye to the future. And no\r\nsooner was he gone, than I set to, to get everything about me into the\r\nproper place, that I might not be taken, at breakfast-time, for a young\r\nman at all of a Radical turn.\r\n\r\nThis made me late, though I had got up very early; earlier than any\r\nother of the party, except Professor Megalow; and when I came in, he was\r\ndescribing, with his usual clearness and quietness, the object of his\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\n\"It is still _in situ_, in the composite bed, none of which is of hard\r\nmaterial; and indeed it would be easier to extricate it perfect, if the\r\nmatrix were more consistent. We shall want a very careful hand to-day;\r\nand at the same time, light feet under it. Unhappily, I am a little\r\nabove the proper scientific stature; neither can I any longer claim the\r\nflexibility of my earlier days. Unless I can secure a very able\r\ncoadjutor, such as I once had the good luck to obtain, there will be\r\ngreat risk of injuring one of the finest specimens of the noble\r\nDeino-Saurians, I have ever had the fortune to behold. Let me try to\r\ndescribe to you the exact position, which makes the extraction so\r\ndifficult.\"\r\n\r\nThis he did so well, that I could see the place; though without any idea\r\nof the treasure it contained. He asked if he might take some dry toast,\r\nand with it built up a rough resemblance of the cliff, and excavation;\r\nthen he lodged, in the back of the hole, three joints of a prawn, to\r\nrepresent the relics of the monster, and shored up the crumbling of the\r\ntoast, with a stump of lead-pencil, and some sprigs of parsley.\r\n\r\n\"The position is rather precarious, you perceive,\" he said to Lady\r\nTwentifold, and her daughter, who watched his frail structure with great\r\ninterest; \"and of the people you sent most kindly, to help me yesterday\r\nmorning, intelligent as they were, and very obliging, there is not one\r\nwho goes into this bower, without some trembling, and a superstitious\r\nawe. They are not so much afraid of the cliff falling on them, as of the\r\noutrage they fancy they are doing, to some unknown gigantic power.\r\n'Could he eat me, sir, if he come to life again?' the bravest and\r\nbiggest of them asked me; one of your under-keepers, I believe.\r\n'Certainly he could, if he were carnivorous,' I was obliged to answer;\r\nand that last word frightened them, beyond all former fear. Now, I could\r\nextract this grand relic by myself, for I am not beneath average human\r\nstrength, if I ventured to make more headway; but you see that in\r\nbrittle material, such as this, I am afraid that the whole might fall\r\nsuddenly, and perhaps destroy the beauty of the specimen. And even\r\nwithout that, I want another hand, most sadly; it need not be a very\r\nstrong one, for I would bear the weight of this--the heavier end; but it\r\nmust be a hand that does not shake, as I am sure the bold gamekeeper's\r\nwould.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I will come, and help you with the greatest pleasure,\" exclaimed\r\nSir Roland, \"and obey every whisper. My canvass at Twentibury will do\r\nto-morrow. This is of infinitely more importance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is most kind of an eager politician,\" the Professor answered, with a\r\ngrateful smile, \"to show such preference for the bygone world. But alas!\r\nmy dear friend, you are much too tall. There is no room for you, at that\r\nend of the cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Professor Megalow, may I go with you?\" Miss Twentifold asked,\r\nwith her lovely eyes sparkling. \"I am not very strong; but my hand is\r\nsteady, and I should enjoy it so. Dear mother, say that I may go and\r\nhelp. I would put on my shrimping-dress, and a thick cloak.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help looking at her with alarm; while I did not yet like to\r\nout-bid her for her wish. Lady Twentifold glanced at her with pride, but\r\nserious misgivings about the risk. And the Professor firmly answered\r\n\"No!\"\r\n\r\nBeing thus relieved, I was only too glad to offer my services, which\r\nwere at once accepted.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy is the lad cut out, by nature, for this very operation,\" the\r\nProfessor said kindly, as he took my hand, which was hardened by long\r\nuse of the rudder-lines; \"he is a model of strength, so far as light\r\nweight permits; and his lightness of touch has long been proved. If I\r\nhad my pick of the young men of England; for a job like this, I should\r\nchoose our Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I may come, and see it, without being in the way. I am sure Mamma\r\nwill let me do that,\" cried Laura; \"and the Professor cannot be\r\nhardhearted, if he tries. And I particularly want to go to Happystowe\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will be burdened with her, she may go,\" Lady Twentifold said to\r\nher visitor; \"and I should like to join you in the afternoon, or meet\r\nyou perhaps upon your way back; for I must be at home, till two\r\no'clock.\"\r\n\r\nThings were soon ready, and we three set off, in a light waggonette, for\r\nHappystowe; and but for one thing, it would have been hard to say,\r\nwhich of the three was the happiest. The Professor, with his bag of\r\nsacred tools, was glowing with the prospect of a mighty prize, in his\r\nspecial field of glory, and the tangible proof of his own inductions,\r\npublished in a treatise ten years ago. His fair companion was beaming\r\nwith the brightness of her own youth and beauty, and the joy of the air,\r\nand of a day among the rocks, with her sketch-block and her\r\nshrimping-net. But I, by reason of that one thing, I was happier than\r\nthree times three, or nine times nine of all their happiness. A fig for\r\nthe science, and the old dry bones, the traces of the lubbers that\r\ndeformed the earth--for they were too big only to disfigure it--till\r\nbeauty was created, to make them die of shame. And a fig even for the\r\nblue sky, and gray sea, and brown rocks standing up to be painted; if\r\nonly I might watch Laura's face--without any token of doing so--catch\r\nthe glint of a smile that began far away, and sometimes receive to the\r\nhome of my heart a gaze of good-will, all intended for me.\r\n\r\nI would gladly have dwelt in that happy waggonette, till all the old\r\ndragons came to look for their bones, with Laura sitting by my side and\r\nlaughing, and often saying very simple things, and the Professor\r\nopposite, to balance us, enjoying (as he always did) the company of the\r\nyoung, and nodding in his humorous way, for me to explain to this young\r\nlady some of his less recondite terms, as if I were an acolyte, at\r\nleast, of science. He did it on purpose, I am very well assured; because\r\nhe perceived the condition of my heart, and desired to promote it by the\r\naction of the mind. Being steadfastly Liberal, and taking a very large\r\nview of genealogy, he discovered no unfitness of things whatever, in my\r\ntendency to a deep tenderness, towards a member of the race so far above\r\nme.\r\n\r\nBut that most delicious drive was gone in no time, as everything\r\ndelicious is. We put up, of course, at the \"_Twentifold Arms_,\" where\r\nseveral of the maids remembered me, and Mrs. Roaker was most generous.\r\nAnd it seemed to me one of the most delightful traits in the character\r\nof Professor Megalow, that he should be so wholly wrapped up in his\r\ntools, as to make it my duty to hand Miss Twentifold, down the three\r\nsteps of that fortunate carriage. She never said--\"Oh no, thank you; I\r\nhave my bag to hold; and I can get down very well,\" as girls do\r\ngenerally, whom it is a very small privilege to help down. But she gave\r\nme her beautiful hand, with her beautiful foot on the step, and her\r\nbeautiful eyes for a moment met mine; so that altogether I was quite\r\noverpowered with the sense of beauty, and--which is yet greater in the\r\nend--of goodness.\r\n\r\nThe Professor's face wore a truly scientific air, as he noticed these\r\nthings, for nothing ever really escaped him; and he rubbed his nose\r\ngently, as he gazed at the far offing, as if he had descried there a\r\npalæozoic ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nON THE ROCKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew and far apart the days are, such as came out of the heaven just\r\nthen, when the stoutest Briton, and his wife, can find no hole\r\nready-made, or to be well picked, in the weather. And what is the good\r\nof the finest weather to him, if he employs it in picking holes in his\r\nfriends, or his enemies, or even in himself? But any one, who loves\r\nlarge ways and thoughts, or even little ways, when they are\r\ngood-natured, might have looked with true pleasure, at the Professor for\r\nthe first, and at Laura and me, for the latter enjoyment.\r\n\r\nProfessor Megalow heartily enjoyed the company of young people, and old\r\nhats; and to-day, he had put his great head into a hat, with very good\r\nreason to assign for it, of fine archæological interest. And even if\r\nthings had been as adverse with me, as they were for the moment\r\nprosperous, no moderate misery could have held its own, against the\r\ninflux of his geniality. He marched on before us, to the haven of his\r\nhopes, with a long forked tool upon his shoulder, and a bag of learned\r\norgans in the other hand, and he never turned round, unless we called\r\nupon him; which proved the perfection of scientific insight.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how I should like to be like him!\" said Laura; \"but I never can\r\ncarry a long name long. I learn to pronounce them, and to try to know\r\ntheir meaning; and then the next day, I am as wise as ever. Nearly all\r\nthe young ladies now are so scientific. As one of the books says, it is\r\nsuch a manifold addition to their interests.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not to the interest felt in them;\" I answered, though afraid of my own\r\nwords. \"It makes them so conceited, and so full of their own ideas. And\r\nthey talk, as if they knew everything, with the little bits they pick up\r\nfrom books. That is not the way great men get on. They get on, by their\r\nown observations, and experiments, and by putting this and that\r\ntogether; and so they make great discoveries. And when they have done\r\nit, they are always humble, because of the quantity they can't find out.\r\nLook at our dear friend there! Does he ever pretend to know anything at\r\nall? Does he ever lay down the law about anything? Even upon subjects,\r\nhe understands more thoroughly than any other man yet born, he speaks\r\n(when he does speak at all) with more doubt, and diffidence, and\r\nhumility, than a school-girl does, who knows nothing about it, except\r\nfrom one of his own books. The smaller the mind, the more positive it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then ladies ought to be very positive--at least I mean most of them,\r\nlike me. But how slowly we are walking! The Professor will think, that\r\nwe have no zeal for his bones at all. Whereas I fully mean to go in, and\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you won't think of doing that,\" I answered, as we turned the\r\ncorner, and could see the excavation; \"unluckily, you were not\r\nentrusted to me, or I should forbid it most decidedly. It looks rather\r\ndangerous, and is sure to be very dirty; and what good can you do in\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\n\"What good can I do anywhere, if it comes to that? I came here, to see\r\neverything, and I mean to do it, unless the Professor forbids it, and he\r\nwould not have let me come, if he intended that. Let us go and ask him.\r\nNo, he is too busy!\"\r\n\r\nHis attention was wholly engaged, as we saw, and he was speaking\r\nearnestly to the man, who had been left in charge of the place, last\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n\"You see no difference,\" he said; \"I do, and a very considerable\r\ndifference, Barnes. There has been no rain in the night, and no\r\ngroundswell to produce any vibration. Your shores are all standing, it\r\nis true, but not quite as they stood yesterday. We must have three hours\r\nmore of work in there, before I have exhausted the _situs_; and I would\r\nnot allow any man to come in with me now. Tommy, keep away, and take\r\nMiss Twentifold. I shall have to collect all my forces, and shore up\r\nafresh, before I dare use a tool. The cliff is quite low, but too high\r\nto be safe; and there is a public footpath along the top. The tide is\r\ngoing out; in half an hour, you might get some good shrimping round the\r\npoint. Allow me to commend that pursuit to you, for the next two or\r\nthree hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going in and out, yourself,\" I said, though I took good care to\r\nlead Miss Twentifold away; \"as if there were no sign of danger whatever.\r\nBut if we should do more harm than good, the best plan would be to go\r\nshrimping, as you say. But how shall we know, sir, when you are ready\r\nfor us,--or at least for me, of course, I mean? Lady Twentifold will be\r\ndown, perhaps, about three o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"When all is made safe, and I want your good hand,\" the Professor\r\nanswered, with a look at me, and a wave of his faithful old hat to the\r\nlady, (which said--for all his hats said something--\"I like you very\r\nmuch, but I don't want you now\") \"you will see, my dear friends, this\r\nconspicuous example of the industry of the Orient, waving on that pole.\"\r\n\r\nHe pulled from his hat a large yellow silk handkerchief, spotted with\r\nwhite, and shook it at us, as a flag-signal to be off.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what shall we do? Shall we obey orders, or is there anything you\r\nwould like better? Perhaps you are afraid of the rocks, and the\r\nsea-weed, and the way the waves come running up the hollow places.\"\r\n\r\nI said this, on purpose to stimulate her; perceiving the very fine\r\nspirit she had, which the colour in her cheeks was enough to prove. All\r\nI was afraid of was, that she might doubt the propriety of going round\r\nthe point with me.\r\n\r\nBut she was too simple and good, to do that. She thought not of harm,\r\nany more than she had done it; and the only expression in her eyes was\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n\"Where have you put the nets?\" she asked; \"you shall have Roly's, and I\r\nwill have my own.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if there had been in my nature yet any lingering of the old\r\ntendency to rise into the air, through exultation, could anything have\r\nbaulked it of its operation now? Within a mere mile of the spot, still\r\nshown as the scene of my early exploit, with the weather set fair, and\r\nthe wind the right way, and with beauty at my side, a millionfold more\r\nenchanting than any first view of the sea--what was the reason that I\r\ndid not fly?\r\n\r\nLet Professor Brachipod explain that, if he can; and there is nothing\r\nthat he will not explain most ably, whether he is able, or whether he is\r\nnot. Some great change had \"permeated my organisation\"--as they call it,\r\nas if I were full of pipes--which made me cleave rather to the earth (in\r\nperiods of exuberant happiness) than soar to the sky, to complete it\r\nthere. Perhaps when I grow old, I shall become less earthy, and again\r\nseek my happiness by going upward; but nothing now sets me on the\r\nsprings of my system, except the most expansive and elevating\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nAnd to put aside that, and all questions whatever of the motives for\r\nthis, or the reasons against that, would manners (any more than common\r\nsense, and sound judgment) have allowed me to fly away from lovely\r\nLaura? So long as I had her at my side, what else in the earth, or the\r\nair, or the sky, could I desire?\r\n\r\nNo one has noticed--to the best of my knowledge--what a comfort there\r\nis, in the pattering of feet, when they keep time, and answer well to\r\none another. Not as a single pair, I mean, each coming after the other\r\nwith a gap; but as a pair of a pair-going feet, toe and heel exactly to\r\none another, with no more space crosswise between them, than the other\r\nfoot requires to come up, and fill the gap. And when this is done upon a\r\nfirm gray sand, with just enough spring to make it beautiful to walk,\r\nand just enough yield to take a light impression, how can the most\r\nscientific human body, with a fair human body at the side of it,\r\ncontinue to lament that it is not quadruped?\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the rocks, it was even better. For here, there was such\r\na fine slippery spread of the carpet of the sea, and so many green\r\nfringes, covering traps where a little foot might sink, and perhaps get\r\nsprained, or at any rate get soaked, that at every few yards there was\r\nneed of a hand, or sometimes of two, for discretion of step. And at\r\nevery such aid, there was a smile to pay; not to mention the downcast of\r\neyes sometimes, and sometimes their uplifting with a soft, sweet light,\r\nand the fluttering of lashes in the fresh wind from the sea, and the\r\nmurmuring of lips, more pink and melodious than any clear Pacific shell.\r\nAnd when the brisk freedom of the salt air shed the dark clusters of her\r\nhair, upon her face and neck, veiling the gentle blush and the shy\r\ndamask, my very best manners, and most deep responsibility, struggled in\r\nvain to prevent me from saying--\"You are the very image of a beautiful\r\nmoss-rose.\"\r\n\r\nShe was not at all offended, but looked calmly at me; and answered, to\r\nmy horror--\"What a beautiful idea! I shall tell Mamma, that you said\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please don't do anything of the sort,\" I exclaimed; \"she would be\r\nsure,--or at least she might--I cannot exactly make you understand. But\r\nshe might not be altogether pleased, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't see why. She is very fond of poetry. But if she would not\r\nlike it, you should not have said it. But don't be so distressed. I will\r\npromise not to tell her; because I am sure that you meant no harm. Oh,\r\nhere is my first shrimping-pool!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will sooner bite my tongue out,\" thought I to myself, as in humble\r\nconfusion I unbound the nets--\"than utter another syllable of\r\nadmiration. What a fool I am! But who could help it?\"\r\n\r\nThis put me on my very best behaviour, for a while; and even when she\r\nslipped upon an oozy slab, and nearly fell into a pool a foot deep, I\r\ndid not hold her up, any more than I could help. And after that, being\r\nunder orders not to use my net (which I began with, upside down) until I\r\nknew something about it; but rather to watch how she managed, and to\r\nlearn to do the like,--not an inch of advantage did I try to take, but\r\nwith scrupulous honour held my net betwixt us, and smiled as if my face\r\nwas as stiff as were my hands.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid you don't enjoy this work;\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid of enjoying it too much;\" said I.\r\n\r\nAnd that made her laugh; for she had not the least idea of the darkness\r\nof my meaning.\r\n\r\n\"Now, you may fish upon your own account,\" she told me; \"you see how you\r\nmust draw the net along beneath the ledges, with the hinder part of the\r\nrim kept higher, to brush the rock so that they can't get back over it;\r\nand go well in under all the fringes of the weeds; and then up with the\r\nother rim, and fetch it out briskly. Now, you fish a little; while I\r\nlook on, and applaud you, if honesty and facts permit. You shall have\r\nthis large pool all to yourself, and it is the best among all the rocks.\r\nAnd you can manage Roly's net, which is half again the size of mine, you\r\nsee. Now, I particularly want two dozen prawns, and they are not at all\r\nplentiful on this coast. I have only got seven yet, with all these\r\nshrimps. But everybody says that you are so lucky; and I shall believe\r\nit, if you catch one prawn; they are much quicker to get away than\r\nshrimps, and so it requires more skill to catch them. Well, I declare!\r\nYou have got at least a dozen. I never saw so many in one haul before.\r\nLet me take them out, or they will be sure to jump away from you. Oh,\r\nwhat a very spiteful creature!\"\r\n\r\nA very large prawn, with no sense of the beautiful--at least as existing\r\nin the race that boils him--had rasped her most exquisite forefinger\r\n(which looked in the water as pellucid as himself) with the vile long\r\ncrock-saw, which he carried on his head. And what made it the more\r\nmeritorious on her part, she held fast to him still, and dropped him\r\ninto the bag.\r\n\r\n\"How wonderfully brave you are!\" I cried; \"it is bleeding, two or three\r\nlarge drops. Put it into your mouth, and suck out the poison. Oh, how I\r\nshould like to do it for you! Don't be so intrepid! You never can tell.\r\nHe may have been living with a water-snake. I could tell you such\r\nstories, if it would stop bleeding. Let me tear up my handkerchief, and\r\nbind it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is nothing at all; and if they were poisonous, how should we eat\r\nthem? I split a piece of popweed, and put it on like a thimble, and that\r\nstops the bleeding immediately. It is not the first time they have given\r\nme a rasp. My dear mother likes me to wear gloves, whenever I go\r\nshrimping; but I always pull them off. I like to feel things, with my\r\nown hands. There, what a fuss about nothing! Now go on. How wonderfully\r\nfortune favours you! I have heard it so often, and now I can see it. Try\r\nthat corner, there is always something there. Roly caught a fine silver\r\nmullet there, last summer; and I caught a little fish, we didn't knew\r\nthe name of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me try to smile nicely,\" I said to myself; \"I always get the best\r\nluck when I smile. Cause and effect are always hugging one another. To\r\ndoubt one's luck, is to doubt it nearly always. I want to impress her\r\nwith my good luck, for what impression is more favourable? Faint heart\r\nnever won fairy prawns. That corner looks full of miraculous draught.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please to let go--let go, Miss Twentifold! He may pull me in, but\r\nhe mustn't pull in you.\"\r\n\r\nFor seeing me engaged with a mighty adversary, my lovely companion\r\nrushed forward, and put fair hands on the pole of the net, because my\r\nlight figure was thrown off its balance, by an unexpected weight and\r\nforce.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever it is, you shall have all the glory,\" she answered, as she\r\nobeyed me; \"only I was afraid you were tumbling in.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I will, if it is needful. I don't mean to let him go,\" I exclaimed,\r\nas I set my heels firmly in a ledge. \"Here he comes! What in the world\r\nhave we caught?\"\r\n\r\n\"A giant of a lobster, a perfect giant!\" She was clapping her hands,\r\nwith delight, as she said it. \"Oh, I never beheld such a monster in my\r\nlife! And there never was any one, with luck like yours. There, anybody\r\nelse would have lost him but you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mean to lose him, if he murders me,\" I shouted, as I swung him\r\nout mightily, and laid hold of him; \"oh, he has laid hold of me, in the\r\nmost inhuman manner! Whatever shall I do, to get out of his clutches?\"\r\n\r\nFor this trenchant radical had nipped me by the wrist, with one mighty\r\nclaws, and was clutching about with the other, to embrace me somewhere\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tommy, take care of your nose,\" she cried, forgetting all formality\r\nin fright; \"oh, what will your mother say, if you lose your nose? I know\r\nan old sailor, who has got the mark now. There, that claw is harmless at\r\nany rate. Now let us consider about the other.\"\r\n\r\nShe had cleverly pushed a large stone between his unoccupied nippers;\r\nbut the villain lay stubbornly on his back, in a great tussock of weeds,\r\nspreading his long whiskers, and dappled joints, and lashing about the\r\nblue fans of his tail, and exerting all the leverage of his body, to\r\ndrive his toothed fangs through my poor wrist; and if any one else had\r\nbeen there but Laura, I should have roared with the violence of pain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am so sorry! Oh, how very dreadful! I would not have had it\r\nhappen, for all the lobsters in the world.\" As she spoke she knelt by\r\nme, and her cheek touched mine, and a shower of her hair came streaming\r\ndown, so that I could put my lips to it.\r\n\r\n\"Let him pinch away as hard as he pleases,\" I exclaimed, \"he'll be tired\r\nbefore I am, of this position.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it was impossible not to feel, that the position would be\r\nbetter without its drawbacks. Even love's young dream may be sweeter,\r\nwithout nightmare; and painful is the bravest smile of pain. With a\r\nquick thought, she ran for the handle of her net, and slipping it out of\r\nthe socket, entered the taper end in at the heel of the claw, and with\r\nthe aid of my other hand, unlocked my horny handcuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nBENEATH THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now let us go back, as fast as we can,\" she said, when she had wrapped\r\nup my wrist very softly, with her muslin handkerchief--which I took care\r\nnever to restore to her; \"the tide is coming in, and if it gets to the\r\npoint before us, we shall have to go a mile inland. And I declare, we\r\nhave forgotten all about the Professor's signal, which may have been\r\nwaving for an hour! And perhaps my dear mother may be waiting for us.\r\nBut this unequalled lobster will account for all delay. How quiet he is,\r\nsince we tied his claws! I ought to beg your pardon for the liberty I\r\ntook, in calling you 'Tommy;' but I was in a fright, and it sounds so\r\nvery natural, because of the Professor; and Mamma is almost as bad as he\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will only ask you one thing,\" was my answer; \"try to be as bad, or as\r\ngood, in that way. Call me 'Tommy,' every time you speak. Why, don't you\r\nremember when I put a new leg to your doll? And you gave me such a kiss,\r\nthat I have thought of it ever since. And you said--'You are to call me\r\n_Lo_, remember. All the people I like best are to call me _Lo_. And I\r\nthink I like you best of almost everybody in the world,' But of course\r\nyou have forgotten all that now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What extraordinary creatures children are!\" she exclaimed, as if she\r\nwere the mother of the \"Lo\"; and then she came nearer to me, and\r\nsaid--\"I remember that you were a great favourite of mine; and I don't\r\nlike you not to call me anything. But look, there goes the great\r\nhandkerchief!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall not get out of it like that;\" I answered, with a little\r\ngroan, as if my wrist was in great pain, for fear of any wrath on her\r\npart. \"People should always understand each other; and how can they do\r\nthat, without any names? You should call me 'Tommy,' upon all occasions;\r\nbecause I am Tommy, and nothing else; and even the Examiners call me\r\n'Tommy,' because of my steering the eight so much. But it never would do\r\nfor me, to call you 'Laura,' except when we are quite by ourselves, you\r\nknow; or with only the Professor, who never would tell, and I don't\r\nsuppose he would ever notice it. In general society, I must call you\r\n'Miss Twentifold.' But in particular cases, now and then, I should be\r\nvery much obliged indeed, if I might,--just to keep up the practice, as\r\none might express it, call you only 'Laura.'\"\r\n\r\nI would gladly have put something else before \"Laura;\" but I thought\r\nthis was far enough to go just yet; and it would make it all the nicer,\r\nthat her mother should not know it.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" she replied, with as clear an intonation of my friendly, and\r\ngenial, but not romantic name, as I ever yet was accosted with, \"I shall\r\nleave it entirely to your own discretion, to call me what you like, and\r\nwhen you like. And I see no possibility of harm in my calling you, what\r\nall the Examiners at Oxford do. They gave you the most honourable class\r\nof all, I hear; because you never asked for it. The Bishop says, that\r\nyou might have beaten Mr. Chumps.\"\r\n\r\nThis must have been an error on the Bishop's part, or hers; because\r\nthere was no way to beat a double-first then; though now a man may go\r\ninto perhaps five and twenty firsts. But I did not attempt to contradict\r\nher, after all her kindness.\r\n\r\n\"I hope, you have never seen Mr. Chumps;\" I said, purposely making him\r\nas formal as I could; for I knew that if Bill Chumps came down here, for\r\ncanvassing purposes, or anything else, he would be sure to get elected\r\nfar in front of me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I have,\" she said, \"a very tall gentleman, taller than\r\nProfessor Megalow, or Roly; but not to be compared with them, in any\r\nother way. He has very red cheeks, and rather high cheek bones,\r\naccording to my recollection.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a nose that sticks up a good deal,\" I replied. \"Did you understand,\r\nwhen he came down, that his father carries on the business still? Not\r\nthat it matters, as we all think now, from by any means a lofty point of\r\nview.\"\r\n\r\n\"It never came into my mind to ask,\"--and herein her simplicity put me\r\ndown--\"anything at all about his father. Why should I? Roly brought him;\r\nas he brings anybody, who can be of use to him in politics. It is not my\r\nplace, to have anything to say to them, except what is expected from the\r\npeople of the house. And I believe he saved the life of my first cousin,\r\nLord Counterpagne; and that alone would make him no stranger here. But\r\nlook! If it were possible for the Professor to be in a hurry, he would\r\nbe so now. We have been a long time, and I am afraid he will be angry.\r\nLet us put on steam--as Roly says.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted no steam put on at present, but found no fair means of\r\npreventing it; and a few quick steps brought us up to the pebble-bank,\r\nunder the cliff of the sacred relics.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" the Professor cried, coming down to meet us, \"no wonder I have\r\nwaved my bandana in vain. What a magnificent specimen! And the beauty of\r\nhim is, that he is good to eat; which, alas! was more than I could say\r\nfor my specimen in there; when the lady superior of all the fish-women\r\nof Happystowe asked me just now, how I meant to cook my bones. She has\r\nmarched away in sadness, at my dreadful waste of time. However, at last,\r\nall is perfectly ready; and I would have gone to work without you,\r\nexcept for the dread of your reproaches. We have made all the front\r\nquite safe, and the fissure at the back is not extending. The light is\r\ngood still; but we have no time to lose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my mother,\" asked Laura, \"has she not come yet? She was to have\r\nbeen here, an hour ago. She will be so sorry, to see nothing of the\r\nwork!\"\r\n\r\n\"She has sent down a groom, with a kind little note, to say that she\r\ncannot come till five o'clock, and begging me on no account to wait for\r\nher. I would gladly have put it off until to-morrow, but any change of\r\nweather might be fatal, or even a ground-swell with this springtide, of\r\nwhich there are some signs already. This rock, is not like the hard\r\nsandstone further north, or even firm chalk; but a brittle\r\nconglomerate. We are not our own masters; we must set to work at once.\r\nTommy, I will not keep you long inside; and Miss Twentifold should stand\r\nbehind this high-water mark.\"\r\n\r\nHe took off his hat, and laid it down upon the shingle; and then with a\r\nshort tool of steel in one hand, (something like what the police call a\r\n\"Jemmy,\" but forked at one end, and gouge-shaped at the other) and a\r\nsquare of soft felt in his left hand, he went into the cave, or rather\r\nexcavation; and I (with my hat off) followed him. There was plenty of\r\nlight, when the eyes got used to it; and I saw that the roof was\r\nestablished with short slabs of wood, supported by timber props.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there can be no danger whatever,\" I said, almost with some\r\ndisappointment; \"it is as safe as the dome of St. Paul's, I am sure. Of\r\ncourse, you know best, sir; but I should have gone straight at it. Can\r\nyou spare me a tool to work with?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied, \"you must use no tool; but only follow my directions.\r\nWhy, what is the matter with your wrist--the right one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, but a trifle of a pinch,\" I said; \"I can use it as well as\r\never, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; then watch me, but don't speak loud. There is no danger now,\r\nas you truly observe; or else I would have kept you outside, my Tommy.\r\nBut you see that, to secure our object without fracture, I have yet to\r\ndig out a good bit of the shale--for it scarcely deserves to be called\r\nrock. And when that is done, there may be some little risk, because we\r\ncannot get any shores behind it. From what you have seen with me, you\r\nknow at once, that the object before us is no _pelvis_, as Sir Roland\r\ninsists upon calling it. All that part was easily secured; but I saw\r\nindications of continuance; and following them up, discovered\r\nthese,--which are very grand joints of the _vertebræ_. The weight will\r\nbe very considerable, and we must try to preserve the articulations,\r\nwhich might be injured, if we got it out piece-meal. All you have to do\r\nis, to support the lower end, without jerking it, lest it should drop\r\nfrom the jarring; while I release the upper part. Then with a good heft,\r\nout we get it, with this felt under it, to prevent abrasion. Barnes\r\nkeeps his eyes on the cliff outside, and will call us at once, if the\r\ncrack grows larger. Ah! you fit exactly, as I said you would; with your\r\nfoot in that nick, what can be better?\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word, I watched his skilful work, as he followed with his tool\r\nevery curve of nature's bold carving, now brought out into high relief;\r\nuntil he had the other part (bedded obliquely into the rock-wall) almost\r\nas free as mine was. Then he inserted one side of the felt, under the\r\nmighty back-bones of the monster, and saying--\"Now both hands, my clever\r\nTommy!\" with the leverage of a bigger tool, which he caught up from the\r\nfloor, gradually brought out the reluctant mass.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole of it lay on the edge of the niche, (which he had\r\nlengthened, to allow for the jut) and was ready to come out, being all\r\ndetached, he passed a piece of rope along it upon either side, taking\r\nadvantage of the knuckles of the bones (such as I have often sucked, in\r\nox-tail soup) and making fast at either end, to hold it altogether. Then\r\nhe rubbed his nose, and looked at me, with a very sweet chuckle; and I\r\nfeared that he would knock his bare head against the roof; for he had\r\nscarcely had a chance of standing upright, all the time, except just\r\nwhere there was a sort of pudding-basin in the shale stuff.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we call in Barnes?\" he asked; \"I am afraid his hands would shake.\r\nIt looks like a Death's head, and cross-bones combined, in its present\r\nmost tantalizing attitude. I thought I heard a crack. My young friend,\r\nlisten. Run you outside, and reconnoitre; it is impossible for me, under\r\nany circumstances, to abandon these bones of rapture now. _Impavidum\r\nferient ruinæ._ But I beg you to try a little _alibi_. Go out, and see\r\nhow things look; and if all is serene, return, and help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" I answered; \"if there was a crack, no doubt it was Barnes\r\ncracking nuts outside. He fills his pockets with Brazilian nuts, fit\r\nonly for a blacksmith. If you are ready, sir, so am I. Why, it is not\r\nhalf so big as I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"It weighs, Tommy, at least five times your weight. We will put up this\r\nplank, and slide it down. Here it comes gently! What, you here, Laura!\r\nYou see, if I don't tell your Ma--as the children say to one another.\r\nLet it drop, Tommy, let it drop, if it hurts you.\"\r\n\r\nFor whether from sudden alarm about Laura, or the damage done to my own\r\nwrist, my end of the mass slipped away from me, and turned; and the\r\nthree-inch plank, we were guiding it down, flew up, as if struck by a\r\ncannon-ball, and just missing my head knocked away the main bearers of\r\nthe roof above us. I saw a great mass coming down upon Laura, and\r\nbefore I could think, I had her in my arms and under me; then a roar,\r\nand a flash of light, and black darkness came, and the last sense of\r\nspreading arms over her.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to know what I was about again, lo there I was lying in a\r\nbed of sea-weed; with my head supported by a soft smooth arm coming\r\nunder the curls at the back of my neck, and my breast laid bare to the\r\nwind of the sea, and a great deal of water gone into it. Moreover, I\r\nseemed to be dirty all over, as if I had been rolled along a\r\nknife-board; and a quantity of grime was in my mouth, so that I could\r\nhardly speak for grit.\r\n\r\n\"I don't seem to know where I am,\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind about that, till by and by;\" a soft voice whispered into my\r\near; and soft lips felt nice, and warm, upon my cheek. \"Are you better,\r\noh, darling Tommy, are you better?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be, if I could blow my nose,\" I said; \"there is nothing the\r\nmatter with me, except that. But what is all this roaring noise, if you\r\nplease? Is it coming down again? If it does, I am done for.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, dear! There is nothing coming down at all, except the waves of the\r\nsea. There is a heavy ground-swell. But none of it can come near you,\r\ndear Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Professor said there would be a ground-swell,\" I answered, with\r\nsome nerve of memory touched. \"There seems to be nothing, that he does\r\nnot know.\"\r\n\r\n\"He seems not to have known everything, this time. Did he know that the\r\nrock would come down upon Laura, and must have killed her, but for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"The rock come down? Oh, I remember now! Something came down. But it was\r\nall my fault. And perhaps I have killed her. Oh, please to let me die,\r\nif I have killed beautiful Laura!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! You are not to excite yourself. You have not killed Laura; you\r\nhave saved her life. She is not hurt at all, or at least very little;\r\nnot a quarter so much as you are, my poor darling. Here, you are to take\r\nthis, as soon as you can swallow.\"\r\n\r\nShe put some vessel to my lips; and I saw large dark eyes, and a\r\ntrembling smile, and fair cheeks flowing with a flood of tears. Then I\r\nswallowed something warm, and said--\"Oh, you must be Laura!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am not. I am Laura's mother--your dear lady, as you used to call\r\nme. Now, rest a few minutes, and you will be better. You must not try to\r\nget up, by yourself; nor even with my help, till the Professor has\r\nexamined you. He is up at the Inn, with darling Laura, who cannot be\r\ninduced to go home, until she hears that you are well enough to come\r\nwith us. I sent a boy for him, the moment you revived. Here he comes. He\r\nwill soon tell us all about you. Don't be afraid; you are a hero, not a\r\ngoose.\"\r\n\r\nI felt more like a goose, and one going to be cooked, when my learned\r\npatron, after some kind words, began to make search for my injuries. By\r\ncalling, he was a physician; and if he had only stuck to art, and\r\ndiscarded science, made the most of his talents, and the least of his\r\ngenius, and preferred the twinkles to the broad light of knowledge;\r\ndoubtless he would have been making his twenty thousand a year, with a\r\nbaronetcy, and the fame that breathes its last with its owner. And the\r\nlaying of his fingers on my poor body would have cost fifty guineas,\r\ninstead of nothing but some groans.\r\n\r\n\"The more he groans, the better I am pleased with him,\" he observed with\r\nthe spirit of the true philosopher; \"it proves that his sufferings are\r\ncapable of expression, and that he has power to put them into form. The\r\ngreater the damage to his outward husk,--for he could not expect to come\r\noff unhurt--the smaller the injury to the kernel of this Tommy. His\r\nbones are as sound as my Deino-Saurian's, which rolled on my feet, and\r\nmost happily inflicted, without receiving injury. There, now, my dear\r\nfriend, did you feel that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should rather think that I did,\" groaned I; \"oh, it was dreadful! It\r\nwas as bad as the way the four Professors poked at me. I hope you won't\r\nhave to do that again, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I think not,\" he replied, in a tone which would have been blessed,\r\nif less dubious; \"the fact of his perceiving my light touch there\r\nconvinces me, Lady Twentifold--so far as we may trust observations,\r\nwhich we have not verified--that he has taken no internal harm, in the\r\npart that was most exposed to it. The brattice came down and protected\r\nhis head--being clear of the fall myself, I could see the beginning of\r\nthe accident at that end. The main weight fell upon his back just\r\nhere--you told me that you wished to have everything stated, as plainly\r\nas I could state it, otherwise I would not give you these details--and\r\nwhen we dug him out, the main weight was there still. I rejoice to\r\nassure you, that he will be none the worse, after a week or two of good\r\nnursing. Any frame of stiff construction would probably have been\r\nbroken; but our dear young friend, this heroic youth Tommy, has a frame\r\nof unusual elasticity, partaking rather of the pterotic character, and\r\nhis internal organs are adapted to it. But I would not advise, that he\r\nshould walk as yet, or attempt any movement not absolutely needful. We\r\nwill send for the cushions of your carriage, if you please, and lay them\r\non these planks, and our Tommy on the top; and then with the strong arms\r\nof Barnes, and my own, we will take our young hero to the waggonette.\r\nYou may thank him for the safety of your dear child. I was too far away,\r\nto be of any use. You will candidly acquit me of all blame, I am sure.\r\nYour daughter disobeyed me, in entering the place; and even after that,\r\nthere would have been no disaster, except for the accident to our young\r\nfriend's wrist. All the rest of the excavation is still firm, as you\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will have every bit of it pulled down to-morrow, now that you have\r\ngot all you want, Professor. And to blame you, would be almost as\r\nwicked, as to fail to thank the Almighty.\"\r\n\r\nI know that she discharged that latter duty; but I doubt, if she ever\r\nacquitted herself so thoroughly, as to the former point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nPLEASANT, AND UNPLEASANT THINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverybody said, without one exception, unless it were that of some\r\nlow-minded fellow, that I had performed a most gallant, valiant, and you\r\nmight fairly term it, heroic deed. But I could not at all take this view\r\nof it myself; not only because of that modesty which sometimes suffers\r\nmisunderstanding, from its terror of becoming conspicuous, but also\r\nbecause I had acted purely from instinct, and without two thoughts. If\r\nthere had been two thoughts, the first would have been to save Laura--an\r\nact of mere selfishness; and the second would have been to save\r\nmyself--an act of almost equal selfishness. However, casuistry is not in\r\nmy line, and if people chose to think me a very fine fellow, I should\r\nhave been guilty of self-assertion, if I had kept on contradicting them.\r\n\r\nNobody was allowed to contradict me, for at least a fortnight; and\r\neverything was done to anticipate my wishes. I lay on a beautiful couch,\r\nand read novels, for fear of any harm to my system; and although there\r\nwas a great deal of \"_débris_\" in them, and most of the heroes had been\r\npushed off cliffs, and some of them overwhelmed in caverns, I did not\r\nfind one who had saved, at a stroke, his lady-love's bones, and his\r\nown, and a dragon's. And the best thing of all was, that Laura made a\r\npoint of coming to see me, three times every day. Her mother was\r\ngenerally with her, it is true; but there are methods of exchanging\r\nglances, over kind shoulders, or behind beloved backs; and sometimes\r\nLady Twentifold was called away, while her daughter must be left, just\r\nto say good-bye.\r\n\r\nIn another thing also, I was very lucky. My affection for my mother was\r\nintense and deep: but to be assured of her welfare was enough just now.\r\nBy no means did I want her indefatigable love, and assiduous devotion,\r\nat this crisis. Lady Twentifold had written, in the-kindest manner, to\r\nsuggest that she could come to assuage anxiety, and contribute her\r\ntender care; but the letter had arrived at \"Placid Bower\"--as we had\r\nbeautifully named our house--to distinguish it from the Boiling\r\nscenes--one hour after my dear mother's hasty departure for the port of\r\nLiverpool. By the earlier post, she had received a letter from the\r\nManager of a \"Sailor's Refuge\" there, requesting her to set off by the\r\nnext Express train, if she wished to see her dear brother William alive.\r\nThis was that very same Uncle Bill of mine, who had tossed me through\r\nthe ceiling, as above recorded; and partly in consequence of that\r\nexploit, had betaken himself to the briny waves again, and had long been\r\nsupposed to be lying beneath them. That, however, he had forborne to do,\r\ncontriving on the contrary to keep above them, during many adventurous\r\nyears; until he was landed quite lately at Liverpool, in the last stage,\r\nas every one declared, of a long low African fever. He had not heard a\r\nword of our changes in life, but had given the address of the\r\nSoap-works, and the new Boiler had forwarded the letter.\r\n\r\nMy mother's kind heart was affected deeply; and she left home in such a\r\nhot flurry, with nothing but a few clothes and her cheque-book, that she\r\nnever even thought of leaving any address, or orders concerning her\r\nletters. And we might have heard none of all this, for a month--for she\r\nwas rather superstitious about sending bad news, and had not heard a\r\nword about my accident--except for the kindness of Miss Windsor, who\r\nhappened to call at \"Placid Bower,\" as she often did for a good\r\nluncheon. The cook gave her this, with much good-will, being troubled\r\nwith the knife-boy (who had tried to kiss her, and did not care, how or\r\nwhen, he came home at night), as well as in distress, about her wages,\r\nand the emptiness of the beer-cask; and then Polly, like the mistress of\r\nthe house, sat down, and examined the outsides of all the letters; not\r\nin any spirit of curiosity, in which, (as she confessed) she had always\r\nbeen too deficient, but to find whether she could be of any service.\r\nKnowing Lady Twentifold's letter at a glance, not so much by the\r\npost-mark, or the crest, as its \"unstudied air of aristocracy,\" she went\r\nto my four-legged desk, and wrote a letter beginning--\"Dear Tommy\"\r\n(which some one far superior to herself considered a very great liberty\r\nindeed, and had a great mind not to call me Tommy any more), and\r\ncovering four sides, with a galloping scrawl, all about nothing, except\r\nthat my mother had been suddenly called away to Liverpool, and no one\r\nknew when she would come back again.\r\n\r\nI endeavoured to reconcile my mind to this, trusting that my excellent\r\nmother would take good care of herself, as she generally did, and\r\nfeeling how very much better it was, that her mind should be free from\r\nanxiety, until I could announce my own recovery. And for this latter\r\nblessing I was not in any haste, finding all my medicaments wonderfully\r\nnice, and clinical treatment exceedingly fine.\r\n\r\n\"When are you coming downstairs, old chap?\" Sir Roland inquired, in his\r\nbrisk short style, when I had endured with all resignation a fortnight\r\nof these therapeutics. \"The world won't stand still for the best of us,\r\nyou know. The Professor has packed up his bones, and is going. He can't\r\nhope for any more big lizards; and of this one he has got every bit of\r\nscurf left, I believe. Wonderful, what fancies people have! If you\r\noffered him the Blue Ribbon, not a smile would appear on his philosophic\r\ncountenance. But offer him a thread from the tail, or the _pelvis_, or\r\nthe _pubes_, or whatever he calls it, of some hideous beast that died\r\nwhen mirrors were invented, and you'll get a smile worth walking ten\r\nmiles to see. I tried to take a rise out of him the other day, with a\r\nbig marrow-bone I mashed up, and stuck together inside out; and I rode\r\ntwenty miles, to put the product into a petrifying well, for three days\r\nand nights. I made sure of having him; it looked so natural, and every\r\nbit of join was sawdered over with the drip-stuff.\r\n\r\n\"'New specimen from our cliff, sir,' I said. 'I hope it may induce you\r\nto prolong your stay.'\r\n\r\n\"And really for a moment, he looked puzzled, and I made sure of having\r\nfetched him. Then he stood up, and put his hand upon my shoulder; and\r\nyou should have seen the laugh in his great eyes.\r\n\r\n\"'I hope, my young friend, you will retire from the House, when the\r\nquestion of our next grant is discussed,' he said; 'I shall put this in\r\na case, as a great curiosity; and label it \"_Specimen of a Conservative\r\nM.P._\" The inversion, and the petrification, are the leading features of\r\nthe type.'\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of that now, Tommy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I think that it served you most splendidly right, and will teach\r\nyou how to play tricks with great men. I should like to have seen you,\r\nwith his strong hand on your shoulder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, if you can laugh like that, you heartless radical, there can't be\r\nmuch the matter with your inner parts, unless it is your heartless\r\nheart. And very little wrong with your outward either, to judge by the\r\ncolour on your cheeks, when I came in. You were as bright, as 'a red red\r\nrose newly blown in June.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Because your sweet sister had just been with me,\" thought I; but I only\r\nsaid, \"Yes, I am a little better. My strength is coming back to me\r\ngradually, I believe. With your dear mother's wonderful kindness, and\r\nthe help of a good constitution, I hope to be toddling about as usual,\r\nbefore very long. But Professor Megalow says, that I must shun most\r\ncarefully every possible form of excitement.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of that. But you appeared to me to be in a state of\r\nexcitement, when I came in. And there was somebody going down the other\r\nstairs, I thought; a quick light foot it seemed to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are so many echoes in this house,\" I answered, throwing one\r\nweary arm across my face; \"if you had only got to keep in one room, and\r\nlisten to them, hour after hour, as I have got to do, you would find out\r\nthat a very little thing excites one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I beg your pardon, dear Tommy,\" he replied; \"I should be the last\r\nto hurry you, I am sure; after all the great things that you have done\r\nfor us. But I do want you to be about again, for a lot of reasons; if it\r\nwere only to canvass Larkmount, before they forget your exploit, and\r\nbefore that very dainty colour has time to get spoilt. All the Larkmount\r\nfemales will be in love with you; and everything is driven by the\r\nthimble there. The Rads are going to be fools enough, I hear, to bring\r\nforward an oily fellow, fifty years old, pitted with the small-pox, and\r\nwith stubby black hair, against your soft carmine, and ambrosial curls.\r\nAnd another thing I forgot to tell you, Counterpagne will be here\r\nto-morrow, or the next day; and he is such an awful stick over the wine.\r\nHe thinks himself wronged, with less than two hours of it; and what I\r\nshall do with him, when the Professor is gone, surpasses my imagination.\r\nHe never says anything, except what he has read in the papers of the\r\nmorning; and whatever they have said, he repeats word for word, for he\r\nhas got a tremendous memory. And he does it all the same, if he has\r\nhappened to get hold of a Radical journal, before the sound doctrine;\r\nwhichever side he gets first, he swallows; and his stubbornness, pegs\r\nhim fast to it; and whatever the other side says is therefore all\r\nrubbish, and rot, and roguery. His temper is none of the best; and that\r\nmakes it so much harder to get on with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can you do with him, all day long, if he is that sort of\r\nfellow?\" I asked; \"surely he must be even worse, before he has read\r\nanything at all; because he must want you, to settle his mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all; he would resent it deeply. He must have a thing in type,\r\nand take it in slowly, before his opinion--as he calls it--can be\r\nformed. And then, I am relieved of him for several hours, and am only\r\ntoo glad to be out of the way, while he marches all over the gardens,\r\nand shrubberies, and even the chase--as he calls the home-farm--for\r\nhours of spooning with poor Laura.\"\r\n\r\n\"What an atrocious thing to do!\" I cried, feeling indignation almost\r\nlift me from the couch. \"It is bad enough to spoil your evenings; but to\r\nruin all her mornings is ten thousand times worse. How can you bring\r\nyourself to allow it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am thankful for the mercies that I thus ensue,\" he answered, with\r\nheartless, and most infinite levity; \"what can be the value of a girl's\r\ntime, Tommy? And she likes it, of course--for he makes fine speeches. Or\r\nif she doesn't like it, why she ought to do so, and the sooner she\r\nlearns the way the better. She will have to put up with him, all day\r\nlong, as soon as they are married, which it is high time now to settle.\r\nI may tell you, in confidence, that Counterpagne is just the fellow to\r\nbe made a fool of; and so we must fix him, before that happens. Not that\r\nhe is any great catch, you know. He will take quite as much as he\r\nbrings; and his family is ever so much newer than ours is, for he only\r\nbelongs to us in the female line. Still, this 'alliance' (as the cads of\r\nthe papers call it) has been determined on, for very good reasons; and\r\nit plugs up a leak in some wicked old will.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very wicked will, I call it, a very wicked will, and a still more\r\nwicked deed--to bind two persons together for life, without asking\r\nwhether they suit each other. If you were a beautiful, clever,\r\nsweet-tempered, warm-hearted, pure-minded, and lovely young lady,\r\nwithout a particle of selfishness, or two thoughts of a trumpery\r\ncoronet--how would you like to marry Lord Counterpagne, taking him\r\naccording to your own account? His temper is bad, to begin with--and to\r\nend with too, for any one who cares about his sister's welfare. Roly,\r\nbad temper is the curse of life. Those who are plagued with it, should\r\nlive apart, or only with those they are afraid of; unless they have\r\nenough of self-knowledge, and enough strong will, to quench it utterly.\r\nHas the Earl of Counterpagne got those?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he has, he has concealed them from me, thus far. He thinks his bad\r\ntemper a very fine thing. But, my dear Tommy, what concern is this of\r\nyours?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, I suppose; because she is not my sister. But I will say my say,\r\nand have done with it; and you may think me an upstart meddler, if you\r\nlike. All of you have been so kind to me, and above all your dear\r\nmother, that I would rather die out of the way, than see a great misery\r\nfalling upon you. And the greatest misery in all the world is, for a\r\ngentle, sweet, loving, and sensitive creature, to be shackled for life\r\nto a man, conceited, stuck-up, narrow-minded, cold-hearted, selfish, and\r\nabove all black-tempered. And if you bring such a thing to pass, you\r\nwill rue it to the last day of your life, dear Roland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, he is not half so bad as all that?\" Sir Roland replied,\r\nwith more self-command, than I expected from him. \"Counterpagne is a\r\ngentleman, in his way, and only requires humouring. Tommy, I thank you\r\nfor your warning, which is uncommonly impressive, and\r\ndisinterested\"--here he fixed his piercing eyes on mine, but I was not\r\nthinking of myself at all, in the larger interests my own words had\r\naroused; \"but you have talked a great deal too much for your good. Go to\r\nsleep, and allow me to consider--what comes next.\"\r\n\r\nHe was going to say something harsher, as I saw. But his manly sense of\r\nmy condition, and of the service I had been happy enough to render,\r\nwithheld him from speaking out his mind, just then. And I was glad, when\r\nhe was gone, and I could think things over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WELFARE OF THE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great double blow fell upon me now, far worse than the fall of the\r\nrocks upon my back--for then I had the sweetest of comfort in my\r\narms--to wit the departure of Professor Megalow, and the arrival of the\r\nEarl of Counterpagne. If the learned Professor had been labouring for\r\nthe union of the two most interesting creatures yet extinct, with the\r\nprospect of neozoic forms, big enough to exhaust even his teratology, he\r\ncould scarcely have exhibited higher powers of match-making, than he now\r\nhad exerted for my benefit. He looked upon me as an acolyte of\r\nscience--because of my manual services--and took any failure of mine as\r\na defeat, henceforth, of that great power. Moreover, his heart was as\r\nsoft as a child's, and as versatile, and as abundant; and the dry humour\r\n(which knowledge of the world had spread over the depth of feeling) was\r\nno more than the lid of the well of tears.\r\n\r\nWhat a different nature filled, or tried to fill, his chair, at the\r\nplenteous table of the Towers, next day! Lord Counterpagne had a great\r\nmany good points; he believed so himself; and who am I to contradict\r\nhim? But he went a great deal further than that--he believed that he\r\nhad no bad ones; and upon that matter, a very feeble arguer need not\r\nhave feared to tackle him. He was soft, without being soft-hearted,\r\nstubborn without any real firmness, and slow-witted, without solidity.\r\nFar be it from me, to make the worst of him, because of his presumption\r\nabout Laura; his own face was enough to give a clear account of him; and\r\nhow can he object to that?\r\n\r\nI was heartily glad, not for my own sake, but because it showed the good\r\ntaste of sweet Laura, that she strove her very utmost--without\r\ntransgressing the venial limits of truth--to keep liberally out of the\r\nway of this noble lord. My firm belief is, that she disliked him, with a\r\nloftier disgust than I could cherish. For I did believe that he had some\r\ngood points; and I made it my business to put these before her, with the\r\nnoblest candour possible.\r\n\r\n\"Ah well!\" she said, \"I am surprised, that you should recommend him so.\r\nI thought you had more--more insight, I think the fashionable word seems\r\nnow to be; as well as more, I will not say regard, but consideration for\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as much as I could do,--when she spoke thus, and looked at me, as\r\nif her last friend was gone,--to forbear from a good burst of anger, and\r\nsorrow, and (the hardest of all things to keep under) great love. But I\r\ndid not presume, for a moment, to hope that I should find the proper\r\nanswer yet; supposing I were bold enough to show that last, in any\r\nplainer style than that of sighs, and looks, and forbearance to look, or\r\nto speak sometimes, and little unaccountable changes of colour, and very\r\nsoft tones, and an evident contempt of all low considerations, and cold\r\nsubjects. With all these, and a thousand more, I had been keeping my\r\ndistance from others, and from her before them; yet striving\r\nimperceptibly to steal nearer, as a child sidles towards a shy bird,\r\nwith salt.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to feel very much obliged to me,\" I answered, \"considering\r\nhow you are situated, for trying to make the best of everything.\"\r\n\r\nAt this her eyes flashed, as I meant them to do; and she put up her lips\r\nin a resolute way.\r\n\r\n\"I am not situated at all,\" she replied; \"what a word to use about me!\r\nAll the world seems to have made up their minds, that I have no will of\r\nmy own whatever. And you, who might at least have been hoped to know me\r\nbetter, seem to be contented with the general mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I wish that we were young again,\" I couldn't help sighing, and\r\ntaking her hand as I said it; \"and could talk as we used to do, at the\r\nseaside. We never had any misunderstandings then.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we won't have any now,\" she answered kindly, with a dear little\r\nsigh (as my heart told my ears); \"after all you have done for me, how\r\ncould I endure it? Only, I don't understand why you should take such a\r\nviolent fancy to Lord Counterpagne. We had better drop the subject\r\naltogether. It is scarcely one for us to talk about.\"\r\n\r\n\"If anybody knows, you ought to know that it is not a pleasant theme for\r\nme,\" I said, with a look at which she blushed, and turned away; \"if I\r\nhate anybody on earth, it is his lordship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" she exclaimed, gazing at me with astonishment, but certainly no\r\nanger in her clear brown eyes; \"I thought you had agreed to drop the\r\nsubject. And after all your praises, to say such a thing as that! Why,\r\nyou must dislike pure virtue! But I have been forgetting that I keep my\r\ncousin waiting. I ought to have met him, by the fountain long ago. And\r\nhis dignity is hurt, if I am not there first. Now, you must keep quiet;\r\nand not walk about so much. Since the good Professor went, you never lie\r\ndown at all. And he made you lie down, all day long! Good-bye now, till\r\ndinner-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to stick in here,\" I cried, as she hurried lightly\r\nacross the lawn, and my words seemed too late to overtake her, \"while\r\nthat muff of a lord has you, all to himself. The idea of his showing his\r\nnasty huffs to you! As soon as I am well, I'll have it out with him, as\r\nsure as my name's Tommy. Let me see him dare to pull his long face out\r\nat you; and if I don't double up his counterpane, if I don't make a\r\nMilord Blanket of him----\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it was useless to go on like that, for she never looked back,\r\nto encourage me. My nature, moreover, is not pugnacious, until the very\r\nlast straw is piled upon my back, or peace is more certain to bring\r\nthumps, than war. My lord had been a little supercilious to me, when I\r\ntried to save Roly from this lonesome plague; still, there had been\r\nnothing that I could show offence at, although I might take it inwardly;\r\nand when I spoke of Bill Chumps, as my earliest friend, he had shown\r\nsome fine feeling, and real good-will. And now, when I tried to turn\r\nthings over, calmly and fairly in my mind, and put aside hopeless\r\nwishes, I found it very hard to make right with myself--as a gentleman\r\nis bound to do--my own line of behaviour. When I speak of myself as a\r\ngentleman, of course I do not pretend to be one \"of the gentry\"--as some\r\npeople call those who are born of good position in the country, and so\r\nforth--but only to convey that, by education, association, and avoidance\r\nof low things, I now might claim to be measured by that high standard;\r\nthough a long way from coming up to it.\r\n\r\nAnd taking this view, I was forced to acknowledge, that I must not go on\r\nas I should like to do, and might be said--without any power of\r\ndenial--to have already begun to do. I found myself treated with\r\nextraordinary kindness, by people of a far higher rank than myself, for\r\na number of reasons, which need not be recounted, but had all worked up\r\nto this fine result; and by means of this confidence on their part, my\r\nbehaviour was become of great importance to them. I do not refer now to\r\nnational questions, matters of science, or politics, or even the use of\r\nmy special faculties; but to the nearer and dearer home-interests,\r\ninvolving the welfare of the family. And being still very young, and of\r\nno experience, I puzzled my head, in trying vainly to discover, what was\r\nthe right thing for me to do. My conscience seemed to tell me, that I\r\nought to run away, and let everything take its course without me; and\r\nthis I was very near doing, once or twice. But before I could pack up my\r\ntrunk (which was a big one) my heart stood firmly in the way; and\r\nwhether it persuaded my mind, or not, is more than I can tell; but\r\ncertainly my mind, with a good show of reason, supported it. Why should\r\nthe loveliest, and sweetest, and best, of all maidens in the world be\r\nsacrificed, for an object so low--from a high point of view--as a bag of\r\ndirty money, or a strip of land, still dirtier? Much happier would it\r\nhave been for her--with her warm loving nature, and sensitive\r\nheart--once for all, to have been crushed in the cave, than slowly, and\r\ncoldly, and consciously, to be overwhelmed, and thus buried alive, by\r\nthe burden of the one, who should truly be her light, and life, and\r\nliberty. To prevent that, most clearly was my first duty.\r\n\r\nAnd while I was proving to my conscience this--which pure inexperience\r\nalone could excuse it, for not having understood long ago--it came to my\r\nknowledge, that Lord Counterpagne was not, (in other ways than those\r\nalready mentioned as unsuitable) fit to be trusted with the sacred love,\r\nand pure heart of any good maiden. Into this I shall not enter, any more\r\nthan I can help; for the discussion of such matters (which even ladies\r\nsometimes taunt us with avoiding) can cure nobody, and may taint many.\r\nEnough that it quenched all further doubt (which became at once unmanly\r\nsqueamishness) as to my duty, towards him and her; and would have made\r\nme loathe the sight of him near Laura, even if she had been nothing to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, you are not in your usual spirits,\" Sir Roland said to me, as he\r\nsat in the chair of hospitality, after the ladies had retired, with the\r\nEarl on his right hand, and me on his left; \"I fear that you are walking\r\ntoo much, my dear boy, before you have got your strength up again. If\r\nyou do that, the Radical candidate for Larkmount will get all the\r\nfellows pledged to him, before I can even show you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is thinking too much about his election;\" Lord Counterpagne\r\nremarked, with that long slow chuckle, which proved his enjoyment of his\r\nown poor wit; \"and from what I have seen in the papers to-day, he will\r\nhave a lot of questions to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"About the cession of Gibraltar, and the total abandonment of India,\"\r\nSir Roland answered, with a wink at me. \"I saw that you were deep in\r\nthat subject, my cousin; and I hope that you found it suit your taste.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justice is justice,\" the Earl replied; \"and narrow considerations\r\nshould not be allowed to blind us, as against the larger view. For\r\ninstance, how should we like the Spaniards to be in permanent occupation\r\nof Dover castle, and the mouth of the Thames? And, to a Spanish mind,\r\nGibraltar combines the advantages of both those positions. I confess\r\nthat I reflected seriously over the forcible manner in which that was\r\nput. And supposing that I had been by birth a Spaniard, which is very\r\neasily conceivable----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. You are not a bit like a Spaniard, and you had better not\r\nreflect as one, until you are re-conceived. We have got those places,\r\nand we mean to keep them; as the Spaniards would keep Dover castle, if\r\ntheir ancestors had taken it, and they could stick to it. The electors\r\nof Larkmount are Englishmen; and they would never have Tommy, if he\r\ntalked such stuff. To-morrow, you'll get hold of a Tory paper first, and\r\nread all about our glorious heritage, and the paramount duty of keeping\r\nit intact. Here, my dear fellow, take another glass of port. You require\r\nit for your constitution.\"\r\n\r\nHis lordship looked angry, but did as he was bidden, for he was\r\nheartily afraid of his strong-minded cousin; and to turn the\r\nconversation, I broke in, saying to Sir Roland,\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, if it suits you, I shall be most happy, to go over, and see\r\nthose highly interesting people. Your Twentibury business comes on next\r\nFriday, and you go up to take your seat next Monday. But if I am to have\r\nthe honour of being returned, it cannot be for some three months yet.\r\nAnd when you go to London, I think of going too. I am rather uneasy\r\nabout my mother. I have not heard from her, for a long time; and I don't\r\neven know, where she is at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; you shall come up with me, and be back again to practise at\r\nthe rabbits, for the first. Counter, I mean to educate this Tommy and\r\nI'll back him to wipe your eye, when the long-tails come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will have to beat his tutor, before he can do that,\" Lord\r\nCounterpagne answered, with his drawling smile, which never followed any\r\nbut his own ideas.\r\n\r\nAnd then they began to talk about sporting matters; such as I had heard\r\nof continually, at Oxford, but knew very little of, in any other way.\r\n\r\nIt grieved me very deeply, as I watched this man (who scarcely ever\r\ndeigned to consider me at all), to think that I must leave him here with\r\nLaura, for I knew not how long, to go sauntering about, and sitting upon\r\nbenches out of doors, and poking into flowers, or gold and silver fish,\r\nand droning all his paragraphs from the papers into her poor weary ears.\r\nSometimes she would rouse her bright spirit, as I knew, and give him\r\nsuch an answer, as of right should do him good; but the worst of him\r\nwas, that his wits were not quick enough to enter into anything that\r\nwent against himself. And Laura, on the whole, was so gentle, and\r\nlong-suffering, and desirous to keep any visitor happy, and herself of\r\nso lively a disposition, that she seemed too likely to try to make the\r\nbest of him,--far more than he deserved, and nearly as much as he\r\nrequired. All this made it more, and more, miserable for me, as the\r\nMonday for my farewell drew nigh, and there came no letter from my\r\nmother, to relieve me of that sad necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nBECAUSE HE HAD NO PITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday was a very lovely day, and people came from nearly two miles off,\r\nto church. The church was just outside the eastern lodge, at the end of\r\nthe finest avenue; and it was very little larger than that lodge, and\r\nscarcely looked so serious. But the parson was a very worthy man to\r\npreach, and he often said things that could be talked about. So that any\r\npeople, who were staying in the neighbourhood, for the sake of the air,\r\nor the views, or the moderate price of meat and butter, or even the salt\r\nwater, were glad (if the Sunday was fine, and a fly could be found, at a\r\nreasonable figure) to be able to say, before they left the\r\nneighbourhood, that they had heard the famous preacher, Mr. Arkles, one\r\nof the few who can still be heard _gratis_.\r\n\r\nNaturally enough, the pews belonging to the Towers, and its race, were\r\nthree quarters of the church. But if any respectable people came in, and\r\nlooked about, as if they were used to cushions, and objected to the free\r\nseats, which had none (and in fact had no room for them, being about as\r\nwide, and rough, as a kidney-bean stick) there never was any\r\nhesitation, on the part of the Officials of the Towers, from the\r\nhousekeeper downwards (according to the dresses of the persons that came\r\nin, and their power of conveying their importance by their looks), to\r\npush open any door, with some yards of room inside it, and nod solemnly,\r\nyet Christianly, over the top rim of their Prayer-books. In the chief\r\npew of state, there was seldom anybody, to be found at Morning Service,\r\nexcept a few visitors at the Towers; not from any turn on the part of\r\nLady Twentifold against Mr. Arkles--though the public very generally put\r\nit down to that--but simply because she had so many parishes, in all of\r\nwhich she liked the clergymen; and she felt it a duty, in the proper\r\nround of Sundays, to make calls upon all of them, in right order, and in\r\nchurch. But, of a Sunday evening, when the dinner-time allowed, and the\r\ntrees of the avenue dropped no drop, all the \"cover-parties,\" (as the\r\nold butler called us, for whom he had to lay the table) used to march to\r\nthe little old church--for my lady would have no carriage out on a\r\nSunday evening--and behave ourselves, according to our nature, there.\r\n\r\nUpon this Sunday, which was to be my last with Laura, for I could not\r\ntell how long, Sir Roland had driven his mother away, in the light\r\nmail-phaeton to some far-off church, but the young lady stayed at home,\r\nto attend to the visitors, and take them to the parish church. Lord\r\nCounterpagne had a great mind not to go; and it would have been better\r\nfor him, as it happened, if he had persisted in this irreligious tone;\r\nbut even his stupidity was beginning to perceive, what a dreadful\r\ncondition I was in, concerning Laura; and that she would not have me\r\ndisdainfully spoken of, when I was away, and could not defend myself.\r\nAnd these considerations made him go to church.\r\n\r\nEverything went on, as well as need be, until we had got some distance\r\ninto the First Lesson. I had seen a big weather-beaten man come in, at\r\nthe beginning of the _Venite_, forgetting himself, for the moment, so\r\nthat he kept his broad hat on his head, until he was reminded where he\r\nwas. This made me look at him with more attention, and wonder what had\r\nbrought him hither; for he seemed to be not of the neighbourhood. He\r\nrefused to come up to the grade of the pews; though the footmen of the\r\nTowers cast glances at him, as if he were worthy to come in with\r\nthem--which they never did to any below a tradesman, or a farmer--and\r\nwhen he took his hat off, he put it on a stick, and sat down upon the\r\nfree bench, and propped himself up. Then he stood up, at leisure, with\r\nhis staff in his hand, and began to survey the congregation. The\r\nclergyman looked at him, as much as to say--\"You are not behaving very\r\nwell, my friend;\" but he never returned his gaze, nor seemed to know\r\nthat there was any clergyman. His manifest desire was, to see everybody\r\nthat happened to be inside those four walls; and a kindred curiosity\r\narose, on my part, to know all about him. I saw that he was stout, and\r\nat least of middle age, with a ruddy face, and grizzled whiskers, and\r\nthat candid expression of a puzzled state of mind, which generally shows\r\nan honest nature. It was clear, that he had not found what he sought,\r\nthough his eyes were especially turned to our high pew. He looked at\r\nMiss Twentifold, and he looked at me; and I could scarcely help smiling\r\nat his disappointment, as I watched his lips, and could almost hear him\r\nsay to himself--\"No that is not the man.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Earl of Counterpagne was lounging at the back of our deep\r\npew; for he was very lazy, and had taken a great deal to drink last\r\nnight, as I knew by his behaviour at the billiard-table; and being out\r\nof sight of Mr. Arkles, and his flock, he was stopping his ears with his\r\ndainty fingers, to shut out the \"horrible row,\" as he called it, of\r\ntheir hearty, but untutored chanting. And throughout the reading of the\r\nPsalms, there he stayed, putting up his feet; which I could see, vexed\r\nLaura.\r\n\r\nThe First Lesson happened to be the twelfth chapter of the Second Book\r\nof Samuel, and Mr. Arkles began to read it beautifully; for he had a\r\nfine voice, and loved brave English. But before he had gone very far, my\r\nlord, being weary of his lounge, stood up to take a stretch, and have a\r\nlook at the inferior people; among whom there were some bright comely\r\ngirls, not unwilling to catch a great nobleman's glance. The clergyman\r\nread in a loud clear voice, as if himself were the prophet--\r\n\r\n\"The man, that hath done this, shall surely die. And he shall restore\r\nthe lamb fourfold; because he did this thing; and because he had no\r\npity. And Nathan said to David----\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou art the man.\"\r\n\r\nA far louder voice than Mr. Arkles' shouted these words, like thunder;\r\nand the big man pointed his staff, at the pale face of Lord\r\nCounterpagne.\r\n\r\n\"Yon stands the man, that made a harlot of my daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Churchwardens, I call upon you to remove that person;\" the clergyman\r\nsaid, as soon as he recovered, from the breathless astonishment that\r\nfilled the church.\r\n\r\nTwo elderly men arose, to do his bidding; but before they could get near\r\nhim, the big man clapped his broad hat on his head, and walked out\r\nslowly through the open door, by which he had been standing.\r\n\r\nThen my lord turned round to us, with a very ghastly smile, and said\r\naloud, \"It is only some poor madman; but he ought to be taken into\r\ncustody.\"\r\n\r\nLaura, who had become as pale as death, shrank from him to my side; and\r\nI took her hands, in fear that she might faint; but she did not do that,\r\nthough her hands trembled coldly in mine, and a large tear rolled down\r\neither fluttering cheek.\r\n\r\nTo the rest of the service we paid small heed, though going through the\r\nforms of it; and it was all in vain, that our companion tried to catch\r\nour glances, and to smile it off.\r\n\r\nWe three were the last to leave the church; and Mr. Arkles very kindly\r\nfollowed us from the vestry, (into which he had called the\r\nchurchwardens) and told us at the churchyard gate, how sorry he was for\r\nthe disgraceful scene, and the alarm of the young lady. Then he shook\r\nhands with her, and lifted his hat very stiffly to Lord Counterpagne,\r\nand left us at the eastern lodge.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the avenue, leading to the Towers, which was more than\r\nhalf a mile in length, the Earl began to walk, at a pace very different\r\nfrom his wonted dawdle, and seemed to be casting his eyes, in a nervous\r\nmanner, between the great trunks of the trees. The servants of the house\r\nwere far in front, sometimes in sight, and sometimes hidden by the dips\r\nof the land, and the turns of the road, whose beauty he did not\r\nappreciate. This, however, I was capable of doing; and I did not see why\r\nwe should be in a hurry, because his lordship was perhaps in a fright.\r\nSo I said, to break the solemn silence (which seemed to have fallen upon\r\nus somehow, after a little weak talk about the weather),\r\n\r\n\"Why should we go at such a headlong rate? The day is very warm; and why\r\nshould we endeavour to beat it, at its own business?\"\r\n\r\nLaura, who was walking between us, gave me a sweet little glance, almost\r\nthe first she had ventured to exchange with me, since that occurrence in\r\nthe church; but Lord Counterpagne said--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well. I forgot that you had not recovered your activity,\r\nUpmore; after all that business, when you were the pillars of Hercules,\r\nor somebody? Who was it--Atlas? You are fresh from Oxford. A remarkable\r\ninstance of the unexpected. Your principal gift is of flight, I believe;\r\nthough you have never favoured me with a specimen.\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was spiteful, to the last degree; possibly because I had not\r\nsided with him, throughout what I considered the confusion of a\r\nblackguard.\r\n\r\n\"Your lordship may envy me that gift,\" I said, with more irritation than\r\nI ought to have shown, in the presence of gentle Laura; \"but I have\r\nnever yet used it, to escape those I have injured.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I could answer his furious stare, a man of great substance\r\nappeared, from behind a big tree, and stood before us. In one hand he\r\nhad the staff, which had given so much point to his Scriptural\r\ndenunciation; and he held the other open, with great fingers bent, and a\r\nrapid growth of tendency, towards the collar of the Earl.\r\n\r\n\"Mind what you're about,\" I said, going up to him, with every\r\nexpectation of being tossed into the hole of the tree, that had\r\nconcealed him; and I pointed to Laura; and he said--\r\n\r\n\"Roight, lad; teak t' yoong leddy a waa, if tho wool. A foo pri'ate\r\nwords, is aw' oi ston here fur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I come back, to help you?\" I called out to Lord Counterpagne, as\r\nI hurried off with Laura, to get her out of sight of it; and although he\r\nwas in a very low ebb of heart (as his face, and legs showed), he had\r\nthe courage to say--\r\n\r\n\"No. This is a private affair--an attempt to sponge on me. Fellow, take\r\nyour hands off.\"\r\n\r\n\"To sponnge on e, eh?\" I heard the loud voice roar; \"ool't lack a mony\r\nsponnges, afore oi've a dooed wi' e.\"\r\n\r\nAnd desirous as I was to know, how this was to happen, I durst not look\r\nround; because of darling Laura, who was terrified so that I had no\r\nresource, but to help her along, with both comfort and support.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what does that mean?\" she asked, with the saddest forebodings in\r\nher tearful eyes; and I answered,\r\n\r\n\"It must be the way, the grasshoppers are always going on, in this hot\r\nweather. It is the way they make love, you know, to one another.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds much heavier than a grasshopper,\" she whispered, as a yet\r\nlouder stroke awoke the echoes; \"and if that's the way they make\r\nlove,--I am sure, it is not at all what I should like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh that I knew what way of doing it you do like!\" I murmured even in\r\nthat crisis, and she seemed not to hear me, except with her cheeks.\r\n\r\nIt struck me, that she should have been more anxious, for me to hurry\r\nback to the succour of the Earl. But, (either from not knowing what was\r\ntoward, or from a readiness to keep me out of danger, or even perhaps\r\nsome resignation to the code of justice) she took me quite up to the\r\nsteps of the terrace, before she could at all dispense with me. And\r\nthough I ran back at full speed, with three or four men after me, to the\r\nspot where I had left Lord Counterpagne; there was no evil-doer there,\r\nfor us to apprehend, unless it was my lord himself. And we found him in\r\nsuch a very sad condition, that we were all afraid to lift him up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nPERFIDY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything of that kind makes me sad; because I am in such a struggle to\r\nbelieve, what everybody now has settled long ago--and the younger he is,\r\nthe more he feels it--that all our forefathers, in comparison with us,\r\nwere low savages, fools, and brute beasts of the earth. And doubtless,\r\nto this perception of the nature, from which we ourselves descend--or\r\nrather, by some gift (more marvellous a thousandfold than mine) ascend,\r\ntower above their wretched loins, and soar into the seventy-seventh\r\nheaven, or at least as much as we have left of it undemolished--to this\r\npure disdain of the brutes who begot us, are due our strong yearning\r\ntowards, and reverend faith in, the great father of us all,--a little\r\nsnail, without a head.\r\n\r\nBut so long as my nature is so disloyal to that great All-father, as to\r\nwant a hat; thoughts will come into that superfluous, and therefore\r\nuniversally weak, part of the present human being, which goes into the\r\nchimney-pot--evolved, alas! as a penalty for that disloyalty. Oh, that\r\nFather Mollusk could only have foreseen a tithe of the woes, which the\r\nevolution of a head would entail upon his headstrong descendants!\r\nUnwise was he in his generation; and some Satan must already have been\r\n_in posse_, or why did Mother Mollusk---- But such questions are not\r\nScience; which allows no question of her bashful physiology.\r\n\r\nHappier would have been my position now, if the survival of the fittest\r\nhad omitted me, or at least had restored me to the patriarchal state of\r\nheadless existence, at the bottom of the sea. All birds are now proved\r\nto have been evolved from lizards; which accounts for my complicity with\r\nthe Saurian race, and their influence upon my destiny. And another\r\npiercing genius has certified us, that the canine race, being threatened\r\nwith extinction, after milliards of years, by hydrophobia,[2] lay down,\r\nand eccnested the protoplastic flea; who took to his labour of love,\r\nwith congenital tripudiation, and rescued the author of his origin from\r\nimpending annihilation _thus_.\r\n\r\nHydrophobia was the product of _ennui_, of lying chained up in the sun,\r\nand meditating too profoundly, as all dogs do. Thus, a dread of the\r\ndepths of reflection was instituted in the mind of Towser, which\r\ndeveloped, in the intellect of his descendants, into hydrophobia; and\r\nmust have undone them to the ends of their tails, without the evolution\r\nof the genial flea. He, with an infusion of fresh blood, sprang forth,\r\ndeveloped, his saltatory powers, by development of long legs--or _vice\r\nversâ_, for I am not sure which way that link goes,--and has ever since\r\nsatisfied the exigency that developed him, by preserving every son of a\r\ndog thence generated, from the paraphrenitis of nothing to scratch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           \"_Acrior illum\r\n     Cura donat._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought of all this, (though without any room for the moral lesson it\r\nso well conveys) as I came upon old _Grip_, spread out largely in the\r\nsun, upon the pet flower-bed, upon the pet lawn, of that elegant _Rus in\r\nurbe_, as the house-agent called it--\"Placid Bower.\" _Grip_ had caught a\r\nlizard, which he did not care to eat, getting more in the trencher way,\r\nthan he could away with, and finding his teeth more and more like a\r\nhay-rake, which has done its work upon a score of farms, by August. But\r\nit was against all the principles of his life, and the time-honoured\r\npolicy of the nation he belonged to, to let go a hold he once had laid.\r\nAnd yet, as I could see by the twitching of his shoulder, and munch of\r\nhis lip, he could scarcely tell how to defer the crisis, and climax, of\r\na thoroughly exhaustive scratch. For no one durst wash him, except\r\nmyself; and I had never been near him, for six hot weeks.\r\n\r\nPoor old chap! It made all my low spirits go lower, to think that he\r\ncould never more hear me, or see me, until I came as nigh him, as the\r\nlength he once could jump. There was no need to chain him up any more,\r\nfor fear of his flying at some visitor. He had lived in the world such a\r\nlength of time now, that he cared not to strive any more against vice;\r\nunless it came meddling with his own dear belongings. All that old\r\ninterest, of sticking up for honesty, he had long since resigned to his\r\nOxford son, _Grapple_; whom he now approached with great consideration,\r\nthrough the loss of his teeth, and the stiffness of his loins. _Grapple_\r\nwas bodily as good as _Grip_ had been, in his fighting hey-day, neither\r\nwas his pluck inferior; but the difference between them, in warmth of\r\nheart, and faith, and steadfast loyalty, was almost as great as that\r\ngrown up, between our grandfathers and ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut I did not expect, well aware as I was of his staunch, and\r\nwell-proven fidelity, such warmth, and I might say such wildness of\r\nwelcome, as the ancient dog afforded me. When I called out \"_Grip_,\" he\r\npricked up his ears, as if he could never more believe them; and then he\r\nturned his poor eyes, spread with film; and looked at me, as if I were a\r\nmemory. Beginning to get an idea of some bliss, he slowly arose, and\r\nshook himself; but still with his dull eyes set on me, and a tremulous\r\ninquiry of his worn-out tail.\r\n\r\n\"_Grip_,\" I said, \"_Grip_, what an old stupe you are!\" and the sudden\r\njoy made a young dog of him. With a mighty bark, such as he never\r\nexpected to compass again, he leaped up at me, and put his great\r\nossified paws on my breast, and offered me the delicate refreshment of\r\nhis tongue. Then he capered about, and made such a proclamation, that\r\nthe servants rushed out; and seeing me rushed back, to get things a\r\nlittle tidy, before they let me in.\r\n\r\nI found that my mother was still from home, but expected to come back\r\nthat night, and had written, to have the best bedroom prepared, for an\r\ninvalid gentleman whom she would bring. This would, of course, be her\r\nbrother William, of whom I had fully thought to hear as dead, and was\r\ngreatly pleased to find it otherwise, having kind memories of him, and\r\nbeing uncommonly short of relatives.\r\n\r\nAs there was still a good piece of daylight, and it seemed dull to sit\r\nthere by myself, I resolved to reward the faithful _Grip_, by taking him\r\nto see his native land, as he fairly might consider Maiden Lane. So we\r\nset forth together to call on Mr. Chumps, who still carried on his\r\nnutritious business, and wore the blue apron more stoutly than ever.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, my lad!\" he cried, as I opened the shop-door, which rang a sharp\r\ntocsin against beef and mutton-reivers, \"you are come just in time for a\r\nglass of the fizzing. Have you heard the good news? No, I s'pose not;\r\nyou've been down among all them swells, so long. Wonder almost, you\r\nwould deign to look us up. Go on into the parlour, with the missus, and\r\nour Linda. In ten minutes thirty seconds, I shall put the shutters up,\r\nand wouldn't take 'em down for the Dook, or his Royal Highness.\r\nLeastways, I might for H.R.H., if he were going to give a supper-party;\r\nbut not for his Grace,--won't have shanks with his legs. Bill will be\r\nback in ten minutes; go in, lad.\"\r\n\r\nIn the parlour I found Mrs. Chumps, and her daughter Belinda, and some\r\none else sitting in the corner, who seemed to be doubtful about turning\r\nround, at the sound of my voice, or whatever it might be. The room was\r\nrather gloomy, from a balcony over the windows, and the evening now set\r\nin; and I thought, what a very shy young lady they have got! Or perhaps,\r\nshe has had too much tea and cake, and is gone fast asleep in the\r\ncorner. Not to disturb her, I sat down far away.\r\n\r\n\"Poor dear!\" said Mrs. Chumps, who was looking very well, and you might\r\nsay ten years younger, with a new front to her hair, and a pink binding\r\nto her bosom, and a pair of long-skirted kid-gloves on her lap, and a\r\njuvenile jacket with Bohemian scollops, hung behind her, as if she had\r\njust pulled it off--which she never could have done, unless born in it.\r\n\"Poor dear, she naturally feels it so deeply. Oh, Tommy Upmore, you men\r\nnever feel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't we?\" I replied, while wondering who the poor dear was, and what\r\nher feelings were. \"Mrs. Chumps, if you had only seen the stroke of our\r\neight, that beat Cambridge three years running, when he was compelled to\r\nhave his wise tooth out, and he had only cut it two years, I can assure\r\nyou, and the dentist attributed its state entirely to the way the wind\r\ncame over his left shoulder, and he begged me to support him with my\r\nmoral presence, that was how he put it, from his demoralisation----\"\r\n\r\n\"How exactly you do talk like your dear mother!\" Mrs. Chumps answered,\r\nand rather shut me up; for a Bachelor of Arts ought to do more than\r\nthat. \"I dare say the young man felt that deep enough; and my very best\r\nsympathies would be with him, having had out, from first to last, five\r\nand forty of 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ma!\" cried Miss Belinda, \"Now how can you be so wicked? Mr. Upmore\r\nknows better, when he sees them all there. And as for five and forty,\r\nand at fifty shillings each--oh, Mr. Upmore, how many have we got?\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends upon circumstances,\" I replied, for fear of being wrong,\r\nhaving never been told at Oxford, nor yet by Mr. Cope, nor yet by Dr.\r\nRumbelow, nor any of the Classics I had dealt with yet. \"Some have got\r\nmore, and some have less, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that;\" Mrs. Chumps resumed,--\"such subjects are meant for\r\nyoung people, or those who have never known what ill health means. But,\r\nmy dear Tommy, the exact sum is twelve thousand, one hundred, and\r\ntwenty-five pounds, deducting the duty of three per cent.; and hard it\r\nis to have to break the even money. But the poor dear does her best to\r\nfeel resigned; and the other will have to pay six per cent.; that's one\r\ncomfort, at any rate. And lucky she may count herself to get it at that\r\nreckoning, when the whole twenty-five should have come this way. But\r\nthere, we must be easier to please, as I'm sure has always been my\r\nmotto. It will fetch me back to the Church, it will; just when I was\r\ngoing to join the Congregation. They provides in the Church such a\r\ntenderness of feeling, as I first learned out of the Catechism. N. or M.\r\nit says, and he was both, for his name was 'Nathaniel Matthew,' and he\r\nsat at the receipt of Customs. And my Godfather, and Godmother, in my\r\nBaptism, wherein I was made an Inheritor. There is no such fine feeling\r\namong them Dissenters. Poor dear, it is a sad blow for her! There was\r\ntears in her eyes when she told us of it, and no Mammon of\r\nunrighteousness could stop them rolling. My son William, who was first\r\nof all the Colleges, is gone to the lawyer now, to give the proper\r\norders, as a Barrister of Lincoln Inn is bound to do. She have just\r\ndropped in to talk about the mourning; her dear mamma says black; but\r\nher mind is too distressful, and not at all suitable to her bright\r\ncomplexion. Lavender, to my mind, is as deep as need be; and the poor\r\ndear never seen him till his funeral, that took place at Highgate\r\nyesterday. Give us your opinion, Mr. Upmore, if you please; after coming\r\nfrom all their Ladyships.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't understand, Mrs. Chumps,\" I answered, wondering at my own\r\nstupidity. \"I have not the least idea, what the circumstances are.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more don't I, altogether. The whole have come such a sudden blow to\r\nus. Belinda, darling, run and fetch the papers. Oh, bless the girl,\r\nshe's gone without the keys, I do believe!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Chumps laid down her gloves, and began hunting in her pockets; then\r\nhurried from the room upon her daughter's track, while I sat bewildered.\r\nThen a sad sigh issued from the gloomy corner, and a melancholy whisper\r\nfollowed it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Tommy, Tommy, will you ever forgive me? For years, you were the\r\nchosen of my heart. But--but you slighted me, you know you did; ever\r\nsince you became so rich, and grand. Whatever has happened is all your\r\nown fault--and--and he is so many sizes bigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Polly Windsor!\" I exclaimed, going up to look at her. \"Have you been\r\nthere, all that time, and never spoke a word to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how could I do it in the presence of spectators? And I was so\r\nafraid, that you would make a dreadful scene, when you heard of all this\r\nmoney, and my perfidy. Oh no, you must never call it that, dear Tommy.\r\nYou would break my poor heart. When I think of the many times, we have\r\nsettled almost everything, sitting in the cleanest of the\r\ncinder-holes--my dress, and yours, and what the breakfast was to be, and\r\nwhere we would have our holidays--and now, oh now, you can be nothing\r\nmore to me than the best man, if they even allow you to be that. But I\r\nshall insist upon it, and Bill, in return, may settle all about the\r\nbridesmaids. Oh, here they come again! For my sake, control your\r\nfeelings.\"\r\n\r\nI found no difficulty at all in doing this, and was heartily glad when I\r\ngot at last to the kernel of the story, which was simply this. Mrs.\r\nWindsor, who had always spoken very highly of her grand connexions, had\r\nan uncle well posted in the Custom-House, and for many years enjoying\r\nfine opportunities--such as they seldom seem to get there now--of making\r\ndue provision, for the benefit of himself. This thoroughly honest old\r\ngentleman contrived, by strict economy, and frugal speculations, to die\r\nof the value of more than half a plum; and having neither chick nor\r\nstick to care for, had left the sum of five and twenty thousand pounds,\r\nto be divided equally between his two God-daughters, Polly Windsor, and\r\nanother yet more distantly related, whose name I have forgotten, but can\r\nfind out if required. It must not be supposed for a moment, that these\r\nfacts had any influence whatever on the heart of our Bill Chumps, which\r\nhad found its purer half, and more exalted aim, in Polly, ever since he\r\npassed his little-go. Still, there were so many of the Windsor family,\r\nand soap had been so dull of late, and candles had looked down so much,\r\nthat the paternal purveyor of meat, (more stubborn of fibre than a\r\nClare-market steak), steeled his heart, and his block-knife, against an\r\nalliance, which would cost a fellowship of three hundred pounds a year.\r\n\r\nNow this Custom-house money had redressed all that. Bill, who was sure\r\nto have his way in the end, as he always had done hitherto, was welcome\r\nto have it at once, with the blessing of the slaying and the boiling\r\ninterest. I alone was to be left in the cold; and sympathy was felt for\r\nme, whenever I was present. But no sooner was I gone, than I found out\r\nonce, by coming back sharply for my walking-stick, that everybody\r\nlaughed, and made a good joke of it; as if I had been served quite\r\nright, and taught not to give myself airs--which I am sure I never did!\r\nAnd this imbued me with such a sense of wrong, that I declined to be the\r\nbride's best man at the wedding, any more than I would be Bill's\r\nbridesmaid; and instead of feeling any envy for him, I was sorry; being\r\nmorally certain that he would pay out for it. For Polly Windsor's mother\r\nhad a temper of her own; as my dear father (a very sound judge of women)\r\nhad said in my presence, at least fifty times, when she had taken up her\r\nglass with her gloves on, a thing no right-minded woman ever thinks of\r\ndoing. And such things can seldom, or I might say never, be thrown off\r\nin the female line.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was no concern of mine, what sort of a handful Bill Chumps\r\nhad got; and the public will perceive, that I should not have gone into\r\nthis question at all, as I have been obliged to do, except for the\r\nstories put about, concerning my share in the matter--which, as you\r\nsee, was none! But no sooner does a man become highly distinguished in\r\npolitics--as I have been compelled to do--than everything he has handled\r\n(from the time he used his coral) is raked up, and ransacked, and rifled\r\nagainst him. Fifty times, have I been charged at elections, and five\r\ntimes in the House itself, by Irish members, with having jilted the\r\ndaughter of a brother, and far superior, soap-maker to my father! It is\r\nbelow my dignity, to explain such matters, at the crisis of a very\r\nimportant debate, or even when they are throwing eggs at me. But I do\r\nhope, that now having set down the facts, with every word ready to be\r\nsworn to, I have heard the last of that vile calumny.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n[2] Alas that the newest, and perhaps noblest, of all scientific\r\ndiscoveries--the doctrine of creation by eccnesis--cannot be claimed by\r\nan English, or even--as _a priori_ should have been--a learned Scotch\r\nprofessor, but passes to the credit of a French _savant_, hitherto\r\nunknown, but now immortal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nFREE TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen one has been wronged by the outer world, the sooner he gets back to\r\nthe bosom of his family, the likelier will he be to bear it well; and as\r\nsoon as the Champagne was finished, I made off. It was useless to be in\r\nany hurry with old _Grip_, for he knew how undignified it is to pant,\r\nthough the formal cause thereof be portliness; so that by the time we\r\nboth got back to \"Placid Bower,\" my mother had been at home more than an\r\nhour, and had packed Uncle William off to bed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, darling Tommy, so weak he is,\" she told me, as soon as we had heard\r\nall about one another, and finished dinner; \"I have only got to hold up\r\nmy finger, and he does it. And I know the day when it was--'Get away,\r\nSophy;' or 'Do you think I'd put up with such--something--rubbish?' or\r\n'Pack up my traps, if you want to try that game.' And he seems to have\r\nsomething on his mind, that he cannot quite bring himself to tell me, in\r\nthe few times when he is at all fit to do it. You must understand, that\r\nhe goes up and down pretty regular, according to the time of day,\r\nwhenever the weather keeps side with it. Let him have his breakfast, and\r\nget up at his leisure, and have the barber in to shave him and the\r\ndoctor to tell him that his pulse is better, and then let him sit, and\r\nsee the sun come in, even through a shrubbery of chimney-pots, and tell\r\nhim that he shall have one pipe, supposing he manages to eat his dinner\r\nwell, and you should see how happy, and how smiling, he lies back. But,\r\nas soon as the dusk comes on, and the daylight goes, and we can find no\r\nstar to show him, but only dull lamps in the narrowness of the streets,\r\nthen he seems to lose all hope altogether, and turn over on his back,\r\nand put his hands together. And he says, 'Let me die, Sophy; I should\r\nlike to die, if I thought there was any hope of going up to heaven.' And\r\nI say to him, 'William, don't think of such dreadful things; you are not\r\nan old man yet, you know.' And then he looks at me, more pitiful than\r\nyou could endure, if you had known what a lively boy he was; and he\r\ndoesn't say another word, as if it was all useless, but sighs till you\r\ncan see his great ribs shake. Oh, Tommy, he brings me down so low\r\nsometimes, that I feel only fit to see a clergyman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother, you don't look at all like yourself,\" I answered, for she had\r\nalways been so pleasant; \"you never must give way to such melancholy\r\nthoughts. Uncle Bill will soon be better, in this fine air here; and\r\nwe'll show him the sun through the trees, every morning, and the cock\r\nthat flies up into the weeping-ash to crow, and the lambs on the hill,\r\nthat have just been shorn, and play like a lot of white mice in the\r\ndistance. And then in the evening, if he feels down-hearted, we'll shut\r\nout the darkness before it comes on, and light up the gas, and a dozen\r\nbest candles, and play a game of cards to amuse him, or tell stories. I\r\ncan tell stories now, like fun, of all the larks we had at Oxford; and\r\nsailors are like children, so easy to amuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my dear,\" said mother, \"we will do the best we can; and your\r\ncheerful countenance is enough to scare the blues. But he is not long\r\nfor this world, I am sure of that--poor William! But I do feel so\r\nthankful, that he will die among his friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" I replied, for I had not seen him yet, as he had fallen into\r\nlight sleep after painful journey, \"you have caught the infection of his\r\nlowness, mother. 'However bad the case is, never pull long faces,' as\r\nyou used to sing to me, when I got caned.\"\r\n\r\nBut when I went to look at Uncle Bill, that night, as he lay fast asleep\r\nupon his little narrow bed--for nothing would induce him to go into a\r\nfour-poster--I felt very much afraid that dear mother was too right. I\r\nnever should have guessed, that this could be my Uncle Bill, of whom I\r\nhad such playful memories, and to whose buoyant spirits, and frolicsome\r\nnature, nothing had ever been known to come amiss. The great frame was\r\nthere, and the big tarry hands, and the brown wrists tattoed with a true\r\nlover's knot, and a Union Jack, and blue anchors. And I still could\r\ndescry the short stubby nose, which used to give such a merry lift to\r\nhis mouth, and the scar on his cheek, that filled up when he laughed, as\r\nto my recollection he was generally doing. For if ever there had been a\r\nman who was fond of his joke, it was my Uncle William. But, alas! there\r\nwere very few more for him now.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, I carried his bit of breakfast up, as my mother had\r\narranged it on a little tea-tray; but he took a long time to make out\r\nwho I was, though my mother, of course, had said a great deal about me.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy? What Tommy? I remember lots of Tommies;\" he said, with a\r\npleasant smile still on his face, although it was so gray and wasted;\r\n\"there was Tommy, the cook's mate on board the _Saucy Lass_, and Tommy\r\nthe cabin-boy, in the _Erysipelas_, and Tommy the cheating old nigger at\r\nRio, and Tommy that had the dodge for catching flying fish, and\r\nTommy----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, no; your own nephew Tommy. Tommy Upmore, that used to be a\r\nlittle boy at the soap-works, when you came back from sea, and you\r\ntossed him through the ceiling, and his head stuck fast. But you are not\r\nto talk; you must only think about it.\"\r\n\r\nHe obeyed me, like a child, looking at me now and then, as if to refresh\r\nhis memory, while I held the tea-cup to his lips, and put some buttered\r\ntoast into his mouth, between whiles. And the great jaws, that used to\r\nlift a kitchen-table, could scarcely crush the soft toast, without the\r\ntea to help them.\r\n\r\n\"Mother will come in, and sit with you now,\" I said, when he had eaten\r\nas much as he could manage; \"and at eleven o'clock, you will have a bowl\r\nof soup, and a glass of port wine; and after that, you go to sleep. We\r\nare not going to bother you with any doctor, at least, until the\r\nafternoon. And then perhaps Dr. Flebotham, a very clever man, who almost\r\nsaved my dear father's life, will look in, to have a little chat with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Tommy, no,\" he answered, looking at me steadily, as if his\r\nbreakfast had supported him; \"'twould only be running up a bill for\r\nnothing, and your mother has paid a deal too much for me already. But\r\nshe shall have it all back again, my boy, and a pretty penny on the top\r\nof it, if you can keep a secret. I can call you to mind, pretty clearly\r\nnow; though not a bit like what you used to be, except for the swab on\r\nthe top of your head. Can you keep a secret, Tommy boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" I replied, with my eyes upon his, and my countenance full of\r\ndecision; \"it is the very thing that I have always been most famous for,\r\nof all the many things that I can do.\"\r\n\r\nIn spite of this very strong assurance, he seemed to be doubtful, as if\r\nI had said too much.\r\n\r\n\"How can you be famous for it,\" he asked, perhaps with some reason,\r\n\"unless you are accustomed to brag about them? But 'tis Hobson's choice\r\nwith me, Tommy, between you and your mother. And the youngest lad is\r\nsafer than the very oldest woman. Get your dear mother to go upon an\r\nerrand,--the longer the better,--when I am at my best, about noon of the\r\nday; and then get me a pipe, to improve my breath; and you shall know\r\nwhat there is, so far as I can fetch my wind to tell it. I remember all\r\nabout you, my lad, now.\"\r\n\r\nI put my fingers to my lips, to convince him what an enemy I was to\r\nexcess of conversation; and I saw that he was pleased, and it helped to\r\nsatisfy him, that there could be no mistake in trusting me. And the way\r\nin which I managed to get my mother off the premises, was enough to\r\nestablish my repute in this way. For I told her what was true, that\r\nafter all the many years Mrs. Windsor, and she, had been such hearty and\r\nwarm friends, never falling out--except once for three years, upon the\r\nquestion whether when you sew a button on a shirt, the thread should be\r\nwound round the stitches that go through it, before fastening off, or\r\nwhether (as my mother said) that does more harm than good--after all\r\nthis staunch and uninterrupted love, it would seem a very heartless\r\nthing on her side, if she failed to set off, at the first hour allowed\r\nby good breeding for call (which in Maiden Lane was always eleven\r\no'clock, except upon a washing-day), and congratulate her cordially, and\r\nfind out everything about the engagement of Polly to Bill Chumps.\r\n\r\nMy dear mother was quite as eager to do this, as I to persuade her of\r\nthe duty of it; supposing only that Uncle Bill could get on without her,\r\nfor two hours and a half. Two hours and a half meant five, I knew; for\r\ntwo hours at least would be spent in cabs; inasmuch as my mother never\r\ngot into a cab, without making the driver go all the way, according to\r\nher own directions. This being to him an increase of income, he was glad\r\nto navigate accordingly, and enjoyed a geographical lecture at the end\r\nof the journey, which was worth another shilling to him. For my dear\r\nmother felt a great truth, which has never been properly felt by our\r\nSchool-boards, so that the foundation of their scheme is rotten; viz.,\r\nthat people must be paid for learning; which is perhaps the saddest\r\ntrial of the human life.\r\n\r\nUncle Bill should have been depressed, and frightened, by this first\r\nparting from his kindly watchful nurse; but he took quite a different\r\nview of the matter, and resolved to have all the pipes that he could\r\nget, and a glass of hot grog, with the window open.\r\n\r\n\"Surely it is bad for you, sir,\" I said.\r\n\r\nBut he answered, \"My son, what do you know about it? I am making my\r\naccounts up for a better world; and what good-will can I hope for, if I\r\ncast them up all dry?\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had made himself quite comfortable, with an ounce of best\r\nbird's-eye, and three clean pipes, and the appearance of more rum not\r\nfar off, he said, \"Tommy, lock the door, and put the key beneath the\r\nbaccy-box, and let me know if your dear mother happens to turn back, for\r\nwomen are very liable to do that sort of thing. Very well; now come and\r\nsit close by me. I can't spin a long yarn, for want of wind, nor yet a\r\nvery plain one; but you must help it out.\r\n\r\n\"About three years ago, after knocking about in a lot of little craft,\r\nin the Indian seas, sometimes up, and sometimes down, according to the\r\nfortunes of seafaring men, I was skipper of a schooner in the sponge and\r\ncoral trade, or the Beachymess, or anything that might turn up, from a\r\nterrapin to a tarpaulin, as we say. We were trading with the natives,\r\nbetween whiles, every man on his own hook, with his own ventures, while\r\nwe waited for the super-cargo's orders, according as he landed to get\r\nfreight. And not being full, he took us to the--well, never mind, what\r\nislands, but a very savage part, where the people are idolaters, and\r\ncannibals. Here there was a settlement of white men, hailing from every\r\nland under the sun almost, where it doesn't turn them black, and make\r\nniggers of them. As lazy a lot as could be found pretty well, but they\r\nkept themselves with fire-arms against the natives, and collected goods\r\nfor shipment, in a fort they had set up.\r\n\r\n\"We had orders from the factor, who was also part-owner of the craft,\r\nwhose name was the _Saucy Lass_, to leave him at the fort, for a couple\r\nof days, while we made the opposite coast, about three leagues off; to\r\ntraffic for ourselves, if we could, and to lay in provisions, and our\r\nstock of water. For the water at the fort, though very good while fresh,\r\nwould not keep three days in cask, when out at sea. He showed us where\r\nbeautiful water could be got, and plenty of cassavas, yams, and such\r\nlike, and fruit none of us knew the names of. But he warned us to be on\r\nour guard, and stand off at night, and keep the brass guns loaded, for\r\nthe natives of that island were much worse than this; and these were bad\r\nenough, in all conscience. There was no reef between the two islands,\r\nbut one enormous reef round both of them, with water as clear as plate\r\nglass inside, and a light air, and sands that shone like snow.\r\n\r\n\"We found the pretty stream of good water, as he told us, and began to\r\ntake in our supply with the boats, for we carried more hands than is\r\nusual aboard a schooner of three hundred tons, several having shipped\r\nwithout much wages, on the chance of doing something for themselves; and\r\nthere was not a Lascar among them, but mostly British, and two or three\r\nGermans. So that we were not afraid of half a thousand savages, without\r\ntreachery, or surprise, or some other dirty trick.\r\n\r\n\"But the part where we landed showed no sign, at first, of having any\r\nliving creatures upon it bigger than wild pigs, and goats, and an animal\r\nsomething like a hare, that was very good eating; and the quantity of\r\nfruit upon the trees was such, that most of us found ourselves doubled\r\nup with colic. But I served out a good supply of cordials for that; and\r\nafterwards, the fine appearance of the place, and the softness of the\r\nair, and the colour of the ground (which was almost as good as a meadow\r\nto us) seemed to make us sleepy, and inclined to lie about.\r\n\r\n\"And it would not be true of me to tell you, Tommy, that I was the\r\nbreadth of a rope's end better than the hands put under me. I never was\r\nvery strong for discipline, from knowing that I should not like to have\r\nit done to me, and being more used to come under it than over it,\r\naccording to the want of luck and money. But we happened to have a very\r\ngood Scotch mate, whose name was Rob McAlister.\r\n\r\n\"'Captain,' he says to me, when I was lying easy, on a bank of some\r\nstuff that was as soft as feathers, and wishing I had somebody to fill\r\nmy pipe, and light it; 'Captain, it mis-gi'es me much, but we be\r\no'erfeckless.'\r\n\r\n\"'You go to Jericho, Rob,' I answered; 'or fill my pipe first; and\r\nstrike me a light, and then go to the top of that rock, and look out.'\r\n\r\n\"Before I had finished my pipe, he came back, and told me that the woods\r\nwere so thick inland, that they might hold a thousand people, without\r\nshowing one. But he felt almost sure that he had heard a screech, not of\r\na bird or wild beast, but a man; and this made me pay some attention,\r\nbecause I knew that his hearing was wonderfully sharp; for he had saved\r\nus once, by hearing breakers through a full gale of wind at night, when\r\nno other man could perceive the sound.\r\n\r\n\"'Call the hands together, and draw down to the boats,' was the order I\r\ngave; 'I shall be down there myself, by the time you have got them\r\nready.' But whether I fell off to sleep, or what, is more than I can\r\ntell; only one thing is certain, the men were at the boats, before I\r\nwas near them, and before I had begun to think at all about it. Then\r\nthey sent a lad to fetch me, whose name was Tommy, understrapper to the\r\ncook; but before he could find me, a terrible scream made me sit up, and\r\nlook round. Upon the slope behind me, were a lot of darkies running, and\r\nin front of them a white man, flying for his life, who had clearly\r\ncaught sight of our boats, just when his case seemed altogether\r\nhopeless.\r\n\r\n\"Our men had seen him, and were pushing out a little; while others waved\r\ntheir guns, and shouted to him, to put on his last bit of speed, and\r\nthey would save him. From the place where they stood, they could see the\r\ngreat multitude of his pursuers, which I could not do; and this made me\r\nwrong them, in thinking them cowards, for not coming up the hill, to\r\nhelp. Meanwhile he was coming down the hill, with his breath too short\r\nto be used, and his heart pumped out, and his naked legs covered with\r\nblood, and his face as white as birch-bark, and as resolute as iron.\r\nThree of his pursuers were in front of the rest, and not more than\r\nthirty yards behind him, and each bore a javelin, which he would not\r\nthrow yet, for fear of missing aim in the rush of it. None of them had\r\nseen me, where I sat and watched them, through the bush that sheltered\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I saw that they must pass, within a few yards of my lair, so I crawled\r\nbehind a tree which was feathered with some creepers, and there stood\r\nupright, with my double-barrelled shot-gun, which I luckily had brought\r\nfor the chance of game. Then I gave a little whistle, and the flying man\r\ndescried me, and turned in that direction. 'Don't stop,' I whispered;\r\nand he saw what I meant, and continued down the hill, as if he had not\r\nseen me. Then as his three pursuers rushed past the tree, I let out with\r\nmy fist at the left ear of the nearest one, and sent him sprawling; then\r\nI shot the two others as dead as a door-nail, before they could turn to\r\nlance me. Big limber fellows they were both; one of them fell forward on\r\nhis head, and turned a somersault, down the steep ridge he was so\r\nhastily descending.\r\n\r\n\"'On, for your life!' I cried, 'you are too blown to fight. Tell the\r\nmate to come with half a dozen men to meet me.' He doubted for a moment\r\nabout leaving me, but seeing me loading again in all haste, and the rest\r\nof his pursuers standing still in great amazement, on he went, and I\r\ncould hear him panting down the hill. Then as soon as I had loaded, I\r\nmade after him with speed; seeing which, the other savages set up a\r\nfearful whoop, and came rushing down the hill, perhaps three hundred\r\naltogether. Two javelins hissed over my head; and then I turned, and\r\ndropping on my knee, sent two heavy loads of duck-shot, right into the\r\nfaces of the foremost. This dropped three or four of them, and the rest\r\nstopped again, as if they had never seen a thing like this before; and\r\nthe roar of the gun among the rocks was not a trifle. Without stopping\r\nto load again, on I hastened, and met Bob, and six sturdy fellows, eager\r\nfor a shot.\r\n\r\n\"'Not yet,' I cried, 'not until we are aboard; and then let us give them\r\na general salute.'\r\n\r\n\"All saw the force of this, and as soon as we had lifted the poor\r\nrunaway into my boat, we pushed off, when somebody exclaimed--'Why,\r\nwherever is poor Tommy?' It was this boy's scream which had so luckily\r\naroused me; and then in his terror he had tumbled on a rock, and lay\r\nthere stunned, until the present moment. Tommy was a favourite with\r\nevery one, and it was impossible to leave him to be killed; so the mate,\r\nand two others, volunteered to go and fetch him; although it was no\r\nsmall danger, because the savages had rallied, and were coming on again.\r\nBut we sat ready, with our guns presented, and mis-liking perhaps the\r\nlook of them the villains hesitated. So our three men brought poor Tommy\r\nto the water's edge, and we gave them a good cheer, which they heartily\r\ndeserved. We saw little Tommy hoisted on the back of Bob McAlister, for\r\nhis legs had quite failed him; and just as we were stretching out our\r\narms, to ease him in, the savages let fly at us a volley of their\r\njavelins.\r\n\r\n\"'Give it them!' I cried, and every gun rang out with a fine blaze of\r\nfire, for the evening was set in. Away scampered every baccy-coloured\r\nskin that could; for at least half a score of them could move no more.\r\nBut alas, they had done for our poor little Tommy! A javelin had passed\r\nthrough his loin, and pinned him to the brave mate's shoulder, so that\r\nhe was dead in about five minutes. Our men were so enraged, that they\r\nlonged to land again, and go after the savages; but I would not allow\r\nit, with night coming on, and two of our number wounded. So we made for\r\nthe _Saucy Lass_, and got on board, tired with our day's work, and very\r\nsad about poor little Tommy. Now, my lad, I am not come to the chief\r\npart yet; but I can't tell any more, for coughing now. Find something\r\nfor your mother to be off about, to-morrow; and perhaps if you behave\r\nyourself, you shall hear the rest of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nA PAIR OF BLUE EYES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mother, who was very sharp about some things, could not have failed\r\nto discover from me, or else from Uncle Bill, who was as simple as a\r\nchild, that he had spent a long time in telling me a portion of one of\r\nhis manifold adventures; which recalled to my mind, once or twice, the\r\nrare doings of that grandest of all rovers, Captain Robinson Crusoe. But\r\nwhen she returned from a very long visit to Mrs. Windsor, she had such a\r\nquantity not only to tell, but to give her own opinion on, and to get it\r\nconfirmed by mine (whenever she could stop), that it was next to\r\nimpossible for her to look about, as she generally did, or even wait to\r\nbe talked to, unless it was about the matter she was so wrapped up in.\r\nAnd she declared that she had not heard a quarter of it yet; being\r\nforced by her duties here, to come away abruptly--though she could not\r\nhave had less than five hours there, however well she steered the\r\ncabman--and if she could only be sure, that her dear invalid would not\r\nmiss her so very much, she had promised to go again, and give her very\r\nhumble advice about many things, to-morrow. It was very painful for\r\nher--she confessed that freely--when she remembered what might have\r\nbeen; and £12,125 might better have stopped in the boiling connection,\r\nthan gone into the meat trade, to buy up opposition. However, her dear\r\nboy would not break his heart; had he cared to come forward, he might\r\nhave put a spoke in somebody's wheel; and there always had been\r\nsomething about Polly, which she would be the last to remind her mother\r\nof.\r\n\r\nWhen the coast was quite clear, as Captain. William expressed it, after\r\nlooking down the \"drive,\" as we called it (which was very nearly twelve\r\nyards long, whenever the gate was opened outwards), and receiving a wave\r\nfrom a new white handkerchief--for my dear mother had taken three that\r\nday, having wept into her capstrings yesterday--he made his\r\npreparations, or directed me to make them, for a very long voyage in the\r\nnarrative trade. He had three pipes ready, not to smoke them hot, for\r\nfear of any tendency towards coughing, and a glass of \"regulation,\" to\r\nbe served when he made signal, and his little spy-glass handy, that he\r\nmight see the bus from Hampstead, at a turn of the road a long way up\r\nthe hill; and he always expected to see sailors on it, and if he saw\r\none, he would be sure to drink his health.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" he said in a determined tone; \"I mean to have a quid, and no\r\nmistake. It is six months now, since I have had a quid. In the pocket of\r\nthat coat behind the door----\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir,\" I answered, looking at him with surprise; \"you have been\r\nmost strictly forbidden to do it. You spoke of it yesterday, and Dr.\r\nFlebotham said that congestion at least might ensue. Try to wait till\r\nmother comes, and if she allows it----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be crafty, Tommy, now. I hate crafty people. Your mother would\r\nnever allow it, you know well; and my only chance for it is, when she is\r\ngone away. Do as I tell you. I am the skipper here. Mutiny, indeed, from\r\na younker just shipped! You won't hear another word, until you bring my\r\nknife from the pocket with the yellow button to it, and a cake of\r\nCavendish from the little midship locker. Very good; now cut where I\r\nscar my nail. It's not so much the comfort of it that I want, as to keep\r\nthe throat juicy, and prevent me coughing, from hauling so many dry\r\nwords out of my hold. Very well done, Tommy; I shall promote you. Now,\r\nwhere did I break my yarn off?\"\r\n\r\n\"About your all getting safe into the ship, sir, with two men wounded,\r\nand poor little Tommy dead. And you said, you hadn't come to the best\r\npart yet. Though I thought it was very good indeed already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my son, you shall hear the rest of it, and judge. As soon as we\r\nhad brought ourselves round with victuals, for the sake of the hard day\r\nwe had been through, I sent for the man we had rescued, and held a long\r\ntalk with him in my cabin. As yet, I have only been able to meet with\r\ntwo men who had the gift of gratitude, and both of those happened to be\r\nWelshmen. The name of this man was Rees Edwards; and a smarter hand\r\nnever went aloft. Welshmen, as a rule, are not first-rate seamen; but\r\nwhen they are good, they beat everything; and Rees Edwards was the best\r\nof them I ever came across. His last trip had been in an American bark\r\ncalled the _Beaver_, engaged in the Beachymess, and sponge-trade, among\r\nthese Pacific islands. She had struck in the night, on the great\r\ncoral-reef surrounding these two islands, and a smart breeze from\r\nseaward setting in, they had found it impossible to haul her off. A\r\nheavy sea got up, and she broached to, with the rocks grinding through\r\nher timbers. But the crew contrived to launch their boats, and finding a\r\npassage through the reef, made land, and were very soon surrounded by\r\nthe natives.\r\n\r\n\"These fellows shammed to be as good as gold at first, (though of course\r\nthey knew nothing of their lingo) and supplied them with food, and gave\r\nthem huts to live in, and laid themselves out to be obliging. So that\r\nthe castaways, eighteen in number, began to go about the place, as if\r\nthey were at home, and prepared, with the rough tools they could make,\r\nto build a craft big enough to carry them away. But suddenly two of\r\ntheir number were missing, and then two more, and then another couple;\r\nand the natives endeavoured to persuade them by signs, that these had\r\nonly wandered away into the woods, and would soon find their way home\r\nagain. The surviving dozen did their best to hope so, but took more care\r\nto keep together, and not to go abroad at all at night.\r\n\r\n\"But very soon, they found out the horrible meaning of it. For suddenly\r\nthe savages, having lost all patience, with their appetites whetted by\r\nthe relish of white flesh, fell upon them in the night, and killed them\r\nall but three, leaving nothing but their bones by the morrow night.\r\nThose three they kept alive, because they were too thin; until they\r\nfattened up two, and devoured them. The third, and last, was our friend\r\nRees Edwards, who fell into a melancholy frame of mind, and refused to\r\ngrow eatable, upon any kind of ration. So they put him in the temple,\r\nwhere they kept their chief idol, believing that this would improve his\r\ntexture, and consecrating him to be sacrificed, whether he were fat, or\r\nwhether he were lean, upon the appearance of the following moon.\r\n\r\n\"Edwards, however, was a very clever fellow, and pretending to be\r\naltogether resigned to his fate, obtained some privileges, as a holy man\r\nnow, and devoted to the glory of their great idol, _Jumbilug_. He kept a\r\nsharp watch upon the moon as well; and took strengthening victuals, as\r\nhe saw her getting thinner. He had learned a good deal of their lingo by\r\nthis time, and found out from them about the white man's fort, over\r\nagainst the further end of that island. And the very night before the\r\nnew moon would appear, he slipped through a hole, which he had long been\r\nboring in the mud wall of the joss-house, and escaped into the woods,\r\nwith a long start of his enemies. He made his way eastward by the stars,\r\ntill sunrise, and eastward the whole of the following day, with his\r\nenemies upon his track, as you have heard already.\r\n\r\n\"'Now, captain,' he said, when his tale was finished; 'you have done me\r\nthe best turn one man can do another; and I wish I could make you some\r\nsmall return. _Jumbilug_ is the finest woman I ever saw; and it would\r\nnot be so very hard to run away with her.'\r\n\r\n\"I told him, that this was not in my line at all, having always been shy\r\nof the sex; except to make a joke, or pass a compliment. But he laughed,\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n\"'No fear of her tongue, captain, although she has got a very handsome\r\none; and her teeth are all pearls, and her lips are coral, and her eyes\r\nare as blue as the sky, and much brighter, and her hair is spun gold;\r\nyou never saw such a beauty.'\r\n\r\n\"'I don't care a d--n for all that,' I replied, 'a woman aboard is the\r\ndevil himself.'\r\n\r\n\"But, when I found that all these beauties were real, and could have no\r\ndeception about them, (because the fair woman was made of wood) I became\r\nvery eager to possess these charms, if it might be done, without\r\nfool-hardiness. Edwards assured me, that with a little dash, and\r\nmanagement, it might well be done; for _Jumbilug's_ house was a good bit\r\naway from the town of these savages, and very near the sea. And if we\r\ndesired to punish the barbarians--as every man John of us burned to\r\ndo--for the murder of poor little Tommy, and the massacre, roasting, and\r\ndevouring of seventeen helpless white men, nothing could be such a\r\ndesperate blow to them, as to lose their idol. For generation, after\r\ngeneration, had spent their best treasures in adorning her.\r\n\r\n\"'If she's worth a penny, she's worth £50,000; and they'd rather lose\r\ntheir biggest chief, and all their wives, and daughters. I'm no judge of\r\njewels, captain, but her eyes are something to beat all female\r\nembellishment. They come after you, all over the place, and they shine\r\nby night, like a million fire-flies. The tradition of the people is,\r\nthat they were brought by a bird with great wings, from a country far\r\naway; perhaps an old trading ship from Borneo. Anyhow, there they are;\r\nand the pearls of teeth, as big as my thumb pretty nearly, and the\r\ntongue some red jewel they pick out of the rocks, and the hair spun gold\r\nalmost down to her waist, and the whole of the breast covered up with\r\nfine pearls--ah, you should have seen her when the full moon shone, as\r\nit did upon the night when I was dedicated!'\r\n\r\n\"This description, my dear Tommy, produced a very fine effect upon my\r\nmind. I have heard your dear mother say, a hundred times, that nothing\r\nis so elevating to the male nature as admiration of a virtuous female.\r\nAnd where could I hope to find any female, half so virtuous as\r\n_Jumbilug_? But I cautioned Rees Edwards, not to let our fellows know,\r\nwhat the value of this fair maiden was.\r\n\r\n\"'You are right,' he made answer, 'we should lose half her pearls;\r\nthough the other things won't come out easily at all. When the priest\r\nwas asleep one night, I just ventured to feel the bright tip of her\r\ntongue; but it was firm, anchored in good holding ground. We must have a\r\nscheme to bring her off entire, and not let them know that we do it for\r\nher value, but for the outrage and cruelty of them. All that we can plan\r\nout afterwards; but first find out, whether they are up for it. Of\r\ncourse if they are not, we can't drive them to it.'\r\n\r\n\"I questioned our fellows about this matter, and found them not only\r\nquite ready, but eager, and I might say wild, to go forth upon this\r\nventure. And that, not only for the spree, as sailors call it; but with\r\nthe prospect combined, of revenge for the loss of little Tommy, and of\r\npunishing niggers for eating superior flesh, and of bringing back snug\r\nbits of plunder, on their own account. For I promised them everything\r\nthey could lay hold of, and carry away, except _Jumbilug_ herself--not\r\nfor her value, as I told them plainly, but as a curiosity for a Museum;\r\nwhich might even give me £50 for her. They knew that I had never been a\r\ngreedy man, and they promised to give me some of their own share, if it\r\nshould be worth my acceptance.\r\n\r\n\"Being hard-set for time, we resolved to do it, on the very next night,\r\nhaving made up our minds to keep our allies at the fort outside it,\r\nbecause of the claims they might set up. There would be no moon, and\r\nthose wretched man-eaters would be all fast asleep, as Rees Edwards told\r\nus, within two hours after sunset. They might have set a watch upon the\r\nschooner; but they could not see boats at that distance from the shore,\r\nand they had no canoes on this side of the point. So we left the wounded\r\nmen, to mind the craft, with the two brass carronades loaded; and\r\nslipped off, all in the yawl this time, ten of us, I think, besides the\r\nWelshman, with muffled oars, and all guns loaded.\r\n\r\n\"By water the distance was less than by land, and with Rees Edwards\r\nsteering, we made the land, right under the joss-house in about three\r\nhours. It was very dark here; for the starlight was shut out, by trees\r\noverhanging the water; and leaving two hands to mind the yawl, and just\r\nkeep her afloat, for all was calm as a duck-pool, nine of us landed with\r\nguns and axes, and without a word, made for the temple.\r\n\r\n\"We found the very hole, by which Edwards had escaped, only roughly\r\nstopped with brushwood, which we removed quietly; and then the Welshman\r\nentered, and went round the place, knowing every corner of it, as soft\r\nas a mouse, and then came back, and whispered--\r\n\r\n\"'Only the old priest here, and he's snoring in the lobby. Captain,\r\ncome in, and the rest wait signal.' This had been settled between us;\r\nand first we gagged the old priest, and corded him, for he was not a bad\r\nfellow, compared with some, and had been pretty good to his captive.\r\nThen we rolled up _Jumbilug_, whose eyes were sparkling, in a piece of\r\nsailcloth, which I had brought for the purpose, and we lashed it round\r\nher ankles, and above her golden hair. Then we ran to the front gate,\r\nand let in our fellows, and they struck a light, and looked about them.\r\n\r\n\"There was plenty of glitter, and a lot of little images, and Brummagem\r\nbeads, and bits of glass, and such like, but very little gold--except\r\n_Jumbilug's_ own--for the island produced none, I dare say. However,\r\nthere were pearls upon almost every image, and a lot of lovely shells,\r\nand shining spar, and coral. Every man took whatever caught his eye,\r\nwhile Edwards and myself lifted _Jumbilug_, who was about five feet\r\nlong, from her pedestal, and carried her--though she was a precious\r\nweight--to the boat, and laid her in the stern-sheets. Then we ran back,\r\nand fetched out our men, for fear of accidents; and all well-laden made\r\noff in high feather. And it was high time, I can tell you, Master Tommy,\r\nfor we heard a tremendous row, before we turned the point, screeching,\r\nand wailing, and the shrieks of women. Perhaps they had seen our lights\r\nup in the village, which was not more than half a mile away, and the\r\nbuilding had windows in the dome made of talc, or some such\r\nhalf-transparent stuff. We were heartily pleased with our job, and gave\r\nthem three cheers for their liberality.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning, we made sail for the fort all pledged to say nothing\r\nabout our exploit, even to the factor; but every man stowing away his\r\nown loot, without any quarrelling about it, and, of course, giving\r\nproper share to those outside. But when Rees Edwards came into my cabin,\r\nand we unrolled _Jumbilug_ privately, I can tell you that I stared, as I\r\nnever stared before at any female figure. She was ten times as gorgeous\r\nas he had described her; and the wealth of whole ages was in and upon\r\nher. I insisted that Edwards should take his fair share, though he laid\r\nno claim to anything. We stood her upright against the bulk-head, as\r\nhandsome as paint, and as bright as a star; and then we looked at her,\r\nand she looked at us, as if begging us not to spoil her beauty.\r\n\r\n\"'First choice to you, captain,' said the Welshman; but I answered, 'No,\r\nlet us toss for it;' and so we did, and I won, and made choice of her\r\neyes. And then we went on, turn and turn, until there was nothing left\r\nbut the wooden block; and even that was very clever, I can tell you, and\r\nwould fetch £50 for a museum, I believe. He got the teeth, which I was\r\nvery glad of,--a dozen large pearls half as big as my thumb; but I got\r\nthe golden hair, and made a present of it all, except one lock, to Rob\r\nMcAlister, who was prouder of it than of his sweetheart. Also I got--but\r\nthere, what's the use of talking of it? You have heard what careless\r\nscattergoods all honest sailors are. There is nothing left of all of it,\r\nbut only these here; and they'd have gone long ago, but for being in my\r\ncaul.\"\r\n\r\nUncle William sighed a little, at the end of his long yarn, as if he\r\nshould never spin such another; and then, from inside the blue woollen\r\nthing he wore on the hoops of his ribs, out he pulled a little packet,\r\nsomething (like a worn-out piece of bladder from a jam-pot) rolled, and\r\ntied with yellow silk.\r\n\r\n\"Open it yourself,\" he said, \"but have a care of my caul, young Tommy,\r\nwhich has saved me fifteen times from drowning; though the Lord knows, I\r\nshall never want it any more. This old ship is chartered for a voyage to\r\nKingdom come. Perhaps that Coast-fever has been and spoiled the colour\r\nof them. I haven't seen them, now, for a twelvemonth or more; though I\r\nfeel 'em going into my ribs pretty often. One will be for you, and one\r\nfor your mother; as soon as you have put me under ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle Bill,\" I said, \"we don't mean to do anything of that kind. You\r\nshan't go aloft, as you call it, for forty years yet. Why, what most\r\nwonderful things, I declare! What lovely gold, and what amazing stones!\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a very pleasant smile; \"Something like your hair,\r\nthe gold is spun up, Tommy, ain't it? Only yours have got more touch of\r\nnut-colour in it. Indian work, that is, I reckon; stolen out of some\r\nwreck, with the stones, no doubt. No savage work there, and no English\r\ngoldsmith, nor French either, could come near it. Mysore, or Tanjore, or\r\nTrichinopoly; but I believe the stones must have come from Borneo. At\r\nleast, so the only knowing man I ever showed them to, thought they must\r\nhave done, though he couldn't say how; and _Jumbilug_ had worn them for\r\nthree hundred years, at a rough guess; for ten men's time, the savages\r\ntold Edwards. He told me, he believed they must be blue diamonds; but I\r\nnever heard of such things; I call them sapphires. And I wouldn't tell\r\nyou, what the island is--why, do you think? Because such a Government\r\nas we've got now, would insist upon what they call 'restitution.' They'd\r\nsend out one of them iron pig troughs things they have turned the\r\nBritish navy into to re-build _Jumbilug_, and fit her up again, with her\r\neyes at our expense; and all the rest at the cost of the British\r\ntaxpayers; and then give her a Royal salute, and steam away, for fear of\r\nhurting the feelings of the natives.\"\r\n\r\n\"And perhaps,\" I replied--for this reminded me of Roly's views upon that\r\nsubject--\"they would put half a hundred of plump Englishmen ashore, as a\r\nmeet and proper offering to the injured _Jumbilug_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nSTRONG INTENTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch a weight came off the heart of good Uncle William, and such a\r\nrelief was afforded to his ribs--where the parcel had made a great hole,\r\nas he showed me like the postmaster's stamp on a bonnet-box--that as\r\nsoon as he restored his caul to its proper and inborn aptitude of\r\ncomfort, he was enabled to be just to another tidy quid, and another\r\nglass of grog, not so very fountain-heady.\r\n\r\n\"Don't let me see them any more,\" he said, when he found himself ready\r\nfor a bit to eat; \"they have buttoned up the locker of my poor stomach,\r\nand I believe that's how I took the fever, to which I was never born\r\nnatural. But not a word to your dear mother about them, until I tip the\r\nsignal. That old Jew wanted, oh, how he did try, to get these beauties\r\nout of me! He would have given me a thousand pounds apiece for them; and\r\nthat proves them to be worth at least ten times as much. Get a fair\r\nopinion about them, my lad; and then lock them away, unless you want the\r\nmoney.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help admiring the very clever way, in which Uncle William\r\nhad encircled the blue stones with the spun wreath of pure gold, as fine\r\nas any hair, quite as if they were a pair of brooches in gold setting.\r\nAnd this fetched the colour up, or made them show by contrast, with a\r\nlustre, at once very clear and very dark; though both of the crystals\r\nwere still in the rough. They were something like a pear in form; which\r\nexplains little, for pears are as different in shape as men are. What I\r\nmean is a pear of the variety which the dealers call the \"Duchess,\"\r\nwhich tapers less than the Jargonelle, but much more than the Bergamots.\r\nBetween the two crystals there was very little difference, in size, or\r\nweight, or colour, each of them turning an ounce in the scales. But much\r\nas I admired them, and could look at them for hours; it did not seem\r\nlikely that they could be worth what Uncle William talked about.\r\n\r\nUpon this point I determined to consult Professor Megalow, who knew\r\nnearly as much about stones as bones; till I saw in the _Times_ that he\r\nwas sent to Egypt, upon some important scientific errand; and then it\r\noccurred to me to ask Sir Roland. Not that he was likely to know\r\nanything about it, but that he might commend me to a skilful and upright\r\njeweller, such as a family of rank and wealth were likely to have\r\ndealings with.\r\n\r\nAnd even while I was thinking of him, up he rode, in his usual haste,\r\nupon a showy-looking hack; for the Twentifolds had given up their London\r\nestablishment, at the death of the previous baronet. With very great\r\npleasure, I ran down to meet him; for although \"Placid Bower\" was not\r\nvery grand, I knew that he would be well pleased with it, his nature\r\nbeing very kind, and frank, and hearty. Of course he spoke first, for he\r\nalways took the lead.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tommy, what a beautiful place you have got! I envy you, my dear\r\nboy, that I do. And such a look out! You can see the Victoria tower, and\r\nread the clock over the bridge with a moderate glass; and on a clear\r\nday, you can see the Derby run. You rogue, you never told me of this\r\nsnug shop, the very place for an industrious M.P. And that is what I'm\r\ncome about; as well as the pleasure of seeing you, my dear friend, and\r\nyour good mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother will be home in an hour or two,\" I said; \"and we'll make your\r\nhorse comfortable, and you too, I hope. She is gone to see Bill Chumps'\r\nintended, and advise about all the great preparations. He is going to\r\nmarry Miss Windsor, who has come into a tidy little lump of\r\nmoney--£12,125, entirely at her own disposal. But of course, they will\r\nhave a settlement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holloa!\" he answered; \"well that beats me. I thought you were sweet in\r\nthat quarter, Master Tommy. But you look very jolly, so I hope it is all\r\nright. Take me into your own den first. I want to have a pipe, and a\r\nchat with you. Well, here we are! Just the sort of place I like. Books\r\nenough to look at, and remind you of past woes; with their backs shown\r\nlike scattered enemies. But I don't half like this news of yours. I did\r\nnot mean Chumps to get married, for ten years. It takes all the\r\nenterprise out of a man. On the other hand, the cash will be handy for\r\nhim, and enable him to apply himself to politics, though not half enough\r\nto live upon. But I have very large ideas in my head. When do they mean\r\nto be made miserable for life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere this side of Michaelmas, my mother seems to say. They have\r\nlong been engaged, though old Chumps would not have it, until her\r\nGodfather discharged responsibilities. You are quite wrong, Roly, in\r\nsupposing that I have any call, for a moment, to wear the willow. It is\r\ntrue that Miss Windsor, and your most obedient, have been very intimate\r\nfrom tender years, and ever must cherish sweet memories of playing\r\ntogether in the soapsuds. But she does not approach--she in no way\r\nrealizes--she never has been to me more than a bubble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, your metaphor is fine; and (which is a much greater rarity)\r\nappropriate. Now, let us consider how all this bears on the one ambition\r\nof my life, and of every life at all worth living--the kicking of the\r\nRads off the foul perch they are crowing on. They have made it foul,\r\nmind. It was clean enough, when they hopped up, by cackling, and\r\nflapping their wings, and nudging sideways, as if they meant rather to\r\ngo down, than up. All the honest cocks on the top bar took it easy, and\r\nput their heads under their wings, and tucked up one leg, and spread out\r\nthe claws of the other; till down they went headlong, tumbling on their\r\ncombs at the rush of a cock, who had sworn he would not fight. And fight\r\nhe won't now, to preserve his hen's eggs; but only to keep his own perch\r\nto himself, and the few little bantams he allows to come up. Meanwhile,\r\nrats and weasels increase and flourish; not a sound egg of trade is\r\nthere left in the nest; and of all the fat chicks of the colonies, not\r\none is allowed to jump up on the mother's broad back, and practice a\r\nlittle crow, under her protection. In fact, my dear Tommy, the big cock\r\nof all, having crowed himself up to the top of the roost, has forbidden\r\nevery other cock to chuckle in his throat, unless it is in chorus with\r\nhim. Meanwhile, his own run is on every side invaded, and his chicks\r\ncarried off, and his corn-bin robbed; but all he cares for is to keep\r\nhis own perch, and be clucked to, as if he were the only cock on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say that is all true enough,\" I answered; \"but I don't see how\r\nwe are to better it. What can two little cockerels, such as you and I,\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, it is that accursed spirit, or want of spirit, that keeps the\r\npest triumphant. I am a very little cockerel; as you say, and should\r\nbite the dust before the old rooster. Reason and right go down before\r\nhim, and all the old principles of patriotism are a mixen for him to\r\ncrow on. But why? There have been infinitely finer cocks, who would have\r\nrolled in the dirt, if they had tried to cut such capers. The reason is\r\nsimply craven terror, and the want of firm union against him. Truth, and\r\ncommon sense, and common interests, must prevail in the end; if only\r\nthey are backed up against crowing humbug. And it is the first duty of\r\nevery one, who cares for his country, to bear his little share in this.\r\nEloquence, eloquence, is all the cry--unrivalled eloquence, vast\r\nexperience, unparalleled powers of mind, and so forth. But all of these\r\ncannot turn black into white, nor prove that we are clean, when they\r\nhave dragged us through the mud. We are bad enough now, with our\r\nCountry despised, our manufactures ruined, our agriculture bankrupt, our\r\nland worth nothing, our army made an infant-school, and our kingdom rent\r\nin twain; but madness, ten times worse than that, is threatened, and\r\npromised, for the very next Session.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let us hear the worst of it;\" I answered very calmly, being used\r\nto these rodomontades of Sir Roland's, and not having found myself much\r\nthe worse yet. \"What does the enemy mean to do, next year?\"\r\n\r\n\"You may smile, Tommy. I am afraid you are as bad as the rest; who won't\r\ntry to stop the blow, until their backs are broken. What do you think of\r\nthese three little measures, out of seven, which the Cabinet propose to\r\nemploy the Recess in preparing, and maturing, as they call it? To give\r\nthe county franchise to every man who has a dust-bin, or even a dust-pan\r\nif he lives a hundred miles from London. To prohibit landowners from\r\nhaving any children, after a date to be settled by the Act. To abandon\r\nMalta, Gibraltar, and Aden, and all other places held unjustly, and\r\nsurrender the British fleet, and all ships of war now building, to\r\nFrance, and Russia, and the Irish Land League. A pretty fair programme I\r\ncall that.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so should I, Roly, if I believed a word of it. But don't carry on\r\nwith any more such chaff. Have a glass of good ale, good English malt, a\r\nsound constitutional draught, as you call it. I ordered in a firkin, and\r\nit has just got bright.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, if Englishmen drank this,\" exclaimed Sir Roland, after a good pull\r\nat the fresh, and freshening beverage, in my silver pot, one of the\r\nmany I had earned as coxswain of victorious crews, \"if Britons, instead\r\nof whining about their digestions, and sipping the flat sourness of\r\nhalf-ripened grapes, took a good swig of such hearty stuff as that, very\r\nsoon we should be Britons again. The need of the age is good ale, my\r\nTommy; not the public-house stuff, but the genuine thing, such as every\r\ngood brewery can turn out when it likes. The decay of the nation, and\r\nthe triumph of the hypocrites date from the difficulty of getting decent\r\nbeer. And think of the brotherhood created by good beer. I take a pull,\r\nTommy, so do you; we look at one another, and we trust one another, and\r\na mutual warmth goes down into our glad bosoms. Will you get such a\r\nfeeling from your sulky glass of claret, or your poisonous artificial\r\nwaters, or even the fizz-up-the-nose of your touch-and-go Champagne? No,\r\nmy boy. One of my most cherished hopes is to supply the noble\r\nworking-man, with a real good article in the way of ale; and then let\r\nhim be a Rad, or let him be a Tory--at any rate he will be an Englishman\r\nagain. Let us have another pull, to illustrate that sentiment.\"\r\n\r\nI could not help laughing at Sir Roland's warmth, and confidence.\r\nWhatever he said, he had a way of saying, (without gesticulation, or\r\nappearance of excitement) which made at once a short cut into the mind\r\nof any listener. Perhaps because it came so straight, and clear, and\r\nsure, from his own mind; and generally in simple words, which are the\r\nwings of eloquence.\r\n\r\n\"Now, tell me what you came for, Roly,\" I said, being tired of politics;\r\n\"have you any news from home, or anything of interest to the\r\nbeer-quaffing Briton? I don't care twopence about the Government. They\r\ncan't do any harm, for six months now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't they, indeed? Why, that is the very season, when they disgrace us\r\nmost of all, without even having to cut the double shuffle, in answer to\r\nany honest question. However, as you don't want any more of that--though\r\nyou must be roused up before February--I'll do what I can for you, in\r\nsmaller matters. Understand, then, that poor Counterpagne--who ought to\r\nhave made a better fight of it; I don't think an old man could have\r\npunished me like that, though I should be devilish sorry to give him\r\nsuch occasion--he has got no bones broken, any more than you had, when\r\nthe rock gave you such a thumping. But it would have been better for\r\nhim, if he had; as regards his popularity at our place. My mother won't\r\ngo near him; which she must have done, if his damage had been more\r\ndangerous. You know, my darling mother is a little bit sentimental, and\r\nby no means worldly-minded; but the most stubborn of the stubborn, in\r\nher quiet, and very gentle way. She won't argue a point; she will let\r\none talk for ever, without a word of contradiction; and there her\r\nconviction remains, as unmoved as the table one has been talking over. I\r\nknew by her face, that Sunday evening, that it was all up with\r\nCounterpagne's chance of Laura.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" I cried, for the news was well worth it; and then at his\r\nlook of astonishment I said, \"Your dear sister, in my opinion, is the\r\nmost perfect of all created beings; and I would rather have my eyes put\r\nout, than see her made miserable, by a heartless, selfish, weak-minded,\r\ncold-natured, priggish, and altogether unprincipled fellow, who could\r\nnever have the smallest idea of her value.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be uncommonly warm about it, Tommy. What has poor\r\nCounterpagne ever done to you? He has his faults, I know; and he is not\r\na sound Conservative. But he has scarcely enough character, to be so bad\r\nas you suppose him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a great deal more character, or want of it, than you think. And\r\nnow that I can do him no harm with you, I will tell you a thing which I\r\nhave kept to myself; though I had a hard job to conceal it from you,\r\nwhen I saw him continually at your sister's side. Some days before that\r\nNathan and David business, and the very fine thrashing he received, I\r\ngot a letter from an old friend of mine at _Corpus_, which was sent on\r\nto me from this place. And the writer, (without knowing more of Lord\r\nCounterpagne, than that Chumps knew him, and I knew Chumps) said that he\r\nhad met him at his Club in London, where he was by no means popular. And\r\nthen, at the very time when he was preparing to visit you, and carry on\r\nhis courtship, he was living with an actress of very low repute, and had\r\npromised (as she said) to marry her. With that I have nothing to do; and\r\nI know that it is not supposed now to be any harm at all. But I thought\r\nit a low thing, for him to come, fresh from such company, and hold your\r\nsister's hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right, Tommy; it was a low thing; and no gentleman, who\r\nthought twice, would have done it. And over and above all that, you\r\nknow that I have a great contempt for Counterpagne.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that you have. How can you help it? And yet for some trumpery\r\nbits of ground, or some dirty seat in Parliament, you have been eager to\r\nsacrifice the purest, and warmest, and sweetest heart in all the world,\r\nto such a wretch!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy, you speak hotly, and a little beyond your business. What makes\r\nyou take up this question so intensely?\"\r\n\r\nSir Roland looked at me, in such a way, that I resolved to have it out\r\nwith him, and sail, or sink, at least under true colours.\r\n\r\n\"The simple fact,\" I said, looking full into his eyes, for no man should\r\nfrighten me, in a manly business, \"that I love your sister, as purely,\r\nand entirely, as even she can deserve to be loved. There is not the\r\nleast necessity, for you to tell me, that I am a presumptuous fool or\r\nass, or anything else that you like to call me, for daring to do such a\r\nthing. But I have dared it; and shall dare it, all my life. And though I\r\nhave very little hope of success; it has done me good, and has elevated\r\nme. Not in the social scale, I mean, or any of that stuff, but as a\r\nman--a man who has a right to give his heart, though he may get nothing\r\nbut disdain, for it. I have wanted, for a long time, to tell you this;\r\nthat we might understand each other. You have seen my reluctance to\r\naccept favours from you--to get put into the House, and so on. I could\r\nnot do that, while I kept you in the dark, about a thing likely to\r\nchange all your feelings. You cannot say now, that I have humbugged\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nSir Roland, though generally so quick of reply, as almost to snap the\r\nwords out of one's mouth, took so much time to think, that I felt my\r\nheart beat, like the wing of a bird that is rising.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tommy,\" he said, looking more perplexed than angry, and taking me\r\nby the hand; \"you have spoken as a man; and I thank you for it. And you\r\ndeserve, that I should speak with equal candour. I will not say anything\r\nto hurt your feelings, more than may be avoided. As regards money, and\r\ncharacter, and education, and kindliness of nature, and warmth of heart,\r\nyou are all that a man need desire for his sister. But as regards\r\nbirth--my dear fellow, excuse me, you know that I would not say anything\r\nto pain you, about such an accident, if I could help it--there comes the\r\npoint, which is hard to get over. We Twentifolds do not pretend to be,\r\nof royal, or even of noble descent, in the direct line; though we have\r\nintermarried often enough with the best blood in England; but this we\r\ncan say, that for five hundred years, we have always been of the\r\nforemost rank of commoners, and baronets, ever since such things were.\r\nIn the last hundred years, there has only been one taint----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let me hear all about that,\" I exclaimed; \"I am truly delighted,\r\nthat there has been that. Was it in the tallow-line, my dear Roly?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, it was not. It was in oil and beeswax,\" he answered, with a\r\nfrown which was very like a smile; \"the subject is a sore one, and\r\npursuit would make it sorer. You had better ask my mother, what the\r\nstory is. She tells it, with simplicity and sympathy. But to come back\r\nto tallow--as you coarsely put it. Let everything between us be exactly\r\nas it was. After what you have done for Laura--who would not be alive,\r\nto marry any one, but for you--I shall not attempt to interfere between\r\nyou. Like the present Government, I shall 'maintain an attitude of\r\nmasterly inactivity;' which may, or may not, have the usual result--to\r\nwit, servile passivity. Not a word about this subject again between us;\r\nuntil I renew it. Also bear in mind one thing,--even if you succeed with\r\nmy mother, and with Laura, you will not have my consent (without which\r\nnothing whatever can come of it) until you have done something great,\r\nand glorious, to win the fame, which leaps over all distinctions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n_FAMES FAMÆ._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is a fame, that overleaps distinctions? And how may a poor fellow\r\nget hold of it? I knew a man once, who could crackle all his knuckles,\r\nlike a pair of four-chambered revolvers, and then fire off his wrists,\r\nand elbows, like double-barrelled rifles, after them. We called him the\r\n\"distinguished knuckle-duster;\" and he called himself, the \"famous\r\nartilleryman.\" Would an exploit of that sort overleap the pride of\r\nbirth; and endow our humble candles with the winding-sheet of pedigree?\r\n\r\nIt was not in my nature, to be put down, without having something to say\r\nfor it. My mind was of ordinary substance, and perhaps rather heavy; to\r\nbalance the body, as well as to keep the heart company, at times when\r\nthe pair were in trouble together. But my body was not a mere somebody,\r\nneither an anybody, nor a common nobody; but a substance, in some wise\r\nremarkable, and surely as distinguished as that of the great\r\nknuckle-duster. He had won fame, to his own satisfaction; by deeds more\r\nsurprising to the public ear, but far less so to the public eye, than\r\nthose of which I was capable.\r\n\r\nNow, which is more potent, the ear, or the eye? Which throws the\r\nquickest flash into the brain, and fills it with action the longest?\r\nEven before we have learned enough of speech, to be certain that all men\r\nare liars, how slowly creep in, at the sides of the head, the things\r\nthat leap in, at the front of it! \"Hot are the stings of the eye, but\r\ncold the pains of the ear,\" says an ancient; pithier for once than\r\nHorace.\r\n\r\nThis being so, what should prevent me, from attaining a hotter fame than\r\neven Mr. Panclast's? He could beat his drum upon the ear alone, and\r\nsound his own trumpet into waxy cells; but I could fly straight into the\r\nretina of the brain, and block the whole traffic of the optic nerve.\r\n\r\n\"I will cultivate the lofty gifts of nature,\" I exclaimed, when\r\neverybody else was gone to bed; \"for the sake of my country, I am bound\r\nto do it. Sir Roland was right, and the great Professor wrong. Why did\r\nhe say to me--'Fly no more; aerial Tommy, fly no more'? Why, simply\r\nbecause he is a Rad, and foresees confusion to the Rad race, in my\r\npowers when developed. So far as my own convictions go, there is\r\nscarcely the seed of a fig, between a Rad, and a Tory, when they are let\r\nalone. But the difference is, that a Rad can be lashed up, like a\r\nhalf-broken horse, into any fit of kicking, and cares not a rap, what he\r\nsmashes in his rage. But a Tory is far less impetuous; he has a much\r\nstronger perception of the rights of others, and especially of his\r\ncountry's claim upon him. Such are the men, who are needed now. Panclast\r\nhas an extraordinary gift of lashing up quiet folk, to kick against\r\ntheir neighbours, and of running round the corner, when his own legs\r\nare in jeopardy. However, he is the master of the yard for the present,\r\nin virtue of his powers of swearing, Roly says--but there must be a\r\ngreat deal more than that.\"\r\n\r\nThe upshot of my very callow reflections, was that I determined, to\r\nbegin, at once, to improve my long dormant aerial gifts. Or rather, I\r\nshould say, my repressed, and snubbed, and even dreaded specialty, of\r\nrising from the ground. Although my frame was firmer, and more weighty\r\nthan it used to be, and therefore less elastic, and expansive, than in\r\nboyhood, there was room enough to hope, that some of, if not all these\r\nlosses might be retrieved, by care and skill, by regimen, strict diet,\r\nand the increased power of the muscles. And if these proved\r\ninsufficient, there could be no doubt of one thing--a very little\r\nartificial aid would liberate me, from the growing tyranny of\r\ngravitation.\r\n\r\nWith all this in my mind, I went to bed, and dreamed a dream; which,\r\ncontrary to the usual laws of such visitants, became of the very\r\ngreatest service to me.\r\n\r\nMy conscience had reproached me, while I said my prayers, for a very\r\nunworthy, and unjust reflection, upon Professor Megalow, as above set\r\ndown. From him, I had received the very greatest kindness; and to\r\nimagine, that any party motives could have led him to dissuade me from\r\ninvading the upper firmament, was very mean and nasty of me, as well as\r\nmost absurd. He was not at all a partisan, or active politician, but\r\nquietly held his opinions, upon reasons which satisfied him, and\r\ntherefore cannot have been weak ones. And my last thoughts, or nearly\r\nso, having been about him, he appeared to me naturally in my sleep.\r\n\r\nI dreamed, that I stood between Professor Megalow and my old enemy,\r\nProfessor Brachipod, in the schoolroom of the _Partheneion_. Dr.\r\nRumbelow also was in the distance; with his college-cap on, and the\r\nbiggest of all his canes under his arm. The two learned professors were\r\ndiscussing my case, with very great interest, and some warmth.\r\n\r\n\"He will never fly again,\" said Professor Megalow; \"he is too solid now,\r\nand his bones are all set.\"\r\n\r\n\"The very reason for his flying all the more,\" quoth Brachipod,\r\ncontradictory even in a dream. \"He can not only mount, but propel\r\nhimself now. See, I manipulate him, and off he goes, ten times as high\r\nas he ever went before!\"\r\n\r\nThen he did something to me, and up I went; while he shouted, \"That\r\nproves my theory. Can anything be finer? Chocolous, Mullicles, and\r\nJargoon, come and confess, what a set of fools you are. Bravo, Tommy,\r\nuse your arms and legs!\"\r\n\r\nWith such powerful action did I do this, while rushing up swift as a\r\nrocket, that I knocked half the roof of the _Partheneion_ off, yet stuck\r\nfast somehow, and could scarcely breathe.\r\n\r\nAnd no wonder; for round my neck, when I awoke, was the linen sheet,\r\ntight as a bowstring; while my poor arms and legs, instead of oaring\r\nambient air, were all twisted up in the counterpane, and blanket, like\r\nan \"apple-pie bed,\" combined with what we used to call \"cat's cradle.\"\r\nBut the worst of all was, that I could not remember, (though I sat up in\r\nthe bed, and thought, as soon as I was free) what in the world it was,\r\nthat had been done to me, by Professor Brachipod, to send me up over\r\npeople's heads at such a pace!\r\n\r\nNeither, in the morning, could I call to mind an atom of the thing, that\r\nI wanted so much to recollect; though I knew, that it was something very\r\nsimple, and most easy, and such as I could manage at almost any\r\nmoment--just the very thing, in fact which alone was needed, to restore\r\nmy early powers, and perhaps to place them, in some measure, under my\r\nown command. After cudgelling my slow brain to no purpose, I resolved to\r\ntake the bull by the horns, and do no less, than go, and see Professor\r\nBrachipod himself.\r\n\r\nOn the brink of an enterprise so perilous, duty alike to my friends, and\r\nself, demanded all possible precaution. The first thing I did was to\r\ntell Uncle Bill--for I feared to let my mother know--whither he should\r\nsend for my remains, if I did not come home by dinner-time. Also I took\r\na most trusty friend, to walk up and down, on the opposite side of the\r\nstreet, and listen keenly for any squeal, at all like vivisection. Also,\r\nI had a great mind to buy an American revolver, but felt ashamed of such\r\na relapse into savagedom, and was satisfied with a bit of English oak;\r\nsuch as my quickness of turn might avail with, against a robustness\r\nabove my own. So with _Grip_ at my heels, I rang the bell.\r\n\r\nThe Professor was at home, and in answer to my card, sent a nice young\r\nlady, of Brachipod race, to say that he was just in the crisis of a very\r\nimportant experiment, but would come to me in a few minutes, if I could\r\nkindly wait so long.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid we must hardly let that fine dog in;\" she said, with a\r\npleasant smile, which made me feel ashamed. \"I am very fond of them; but\r\ndear papa is a little nervous now; he has not been well lately.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will pardon me for bringing him,\" I answered, \"but he is\r\nvery old, and a walk is such a treat to him. May I put him in some\r\nouthouse? He is as quiet as a lamb. Oh, thank you; that will do\r\nbeautifully. I hope, I am not interrupting the Professor; his time, of\r\ncourse, is so valuable.\"\r\n\r\nPresently he came down; and I was thoroughly ashamed of my own alarm.\r\nInstead of the Brachipod, who used to jump, and gesticulate, and poke\r\nknuckles into me, I beheld an infirm, and disabled old man, who was\r\nkilling himself prematurely, by wanting to know too much about it. His\r\nface was melancholy, and almost pitiful, as if from perpetual\r\ndisappointment; his forehead was channeled with a chart of hopeless\r\nsoundings; and even the vivacity of his eyes was sad.\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad to see you,\" he said kindly, and gazing with a little\r\nsigh at me. \"I remember you well. But how much you are grown! I fear we\r\nused to frighten you, in the days gone by. We took the wrong course\r\naltogether. If we had only been gentle, and patient, we might have done\r\nmuch with your singular case, and learned things of very deep interest.\r\nIt was bad luck. There were too many of us, and the spirit of rivalry\r\nspoiled everything. I should have kept you to myself, as I had every\r\nright to do. But poor Jargoon, and unhappy Chocolous--you have heard\r\nwhat a sad loss all Science has sustained? Have you not? They have both\r\nfallen victims to the spirit of research. I ought not to grieve for\r\nthem; for there can be no nobler termination to a scientific life.\r\nJargoon, as you know, had a doltish theory--though I should not call it\r\nthat, when he cannot contradict me--about the universal action on all\r\norganisms, of what he called gaseous expansion. He made a great\r\ndiscovery, as he believed, of a primary element, 'Proto-hylic\r\nNephelin,'--intensely inflammable in combination. He was trying its\r\neffects upon the human system, by inhalation through a straw; when\r\nunhappily Mrs. Jargoon struck a match, to seal an important letter. In a\r\nmoment, the Professor, and his theories were abolished; so exhaustively,\r\nthat they could hold the inquest, upon nothing but the calcination of\r\nhis left glass-eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard anything more shocking,\" I exclaimed, forgetting all the\r\nevil, in the sadness of his end, and admiring the courage of the great\r\ndiscoverer. \"And poor Professor Chocolous--was he abolished too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so entirely; but perhaps more sadly. You know that by his theory--a\r\nperfectly absurd one--all causation was referred to the agency of\r\nbacilli--_bacteria_ we used to call them, but the other word is the more\r\ncorrect. Moreover, he was indulging in a life-long hope, to establish,\r\nin his own person, the one thing which alone convinces the\r\nmultitude,--ocular proof (as the outsiders term it) that the human race\r\nhas lost its noblest, and far more essential member than the head is--in\r\na word, its tail, by assuming an attitude never contemplated, in the\r\nscientific stages of evolution. A learned American has, in my opinion,\r\ncut the ground from under the feet of Chocolous, by showing that the\r\ncaudal loss results from the abandonment of the quadrumanous life; and\r\nthat the only chance of recovery lies in the resignation, not of chair,\r\nbut house, and the reinstitution of arboreal habitude. But, to pretermit\r\nhis theories, (which appear to me weak and outrageous) his end, before\r\neven the nucleolus of a tail was established, is a most melancholy tale.\r\nThe very day after he had inoculated his dextral ulna with a new\r\nbacillus (discovered in the windpipe of a duck) he received,--as the\r\nrule is with learned Germans, and the exception with learned\r\nEnglishmen,--a most flattering invitation--which is in fact a\r\ncommand--to present himself in very high quarters. You may suppose, what\r\na fuss he was in--for few of those foreigners have much self-respect--to\r\nput himself into his very best clothes, and to have all his theories\r\nready in his hat. I suppose, that he would not be allowed to carry that,\r\nbut I have never had the opportunity of learning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, sir,\" I said, \"with all your fame, and all the immense things,\r\nthat you have discovered----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Tommy, no!\" he replied, with much meekness; \"but my scientific\r\nstatus is none the worse for that. However, Herr Chocolous, the\r\ndistinguished German, was happy to be thought worth looking at; and he\r\nprepared himself well, in every point but one. He should have provided\r\nhimself with cross-trees, or guttapercha buffers, ever so small, just to\r\ntake his bearing. 'What will you do, if you have to sit down?' I asked\r\nhim, with some prescience of the woe in store for him. 'Bosh!' was his\r\nanswer, for he loved that word, 'zey vill never ask a poor man, like\r\nme, to seet!' 'Well, I dare say not,' I replied, having never found any\r\noccasion to understand such things; and off he went, standing up in a\r\nHansom, and looking more like Punch, than a man of any science.\r\n\r\n\"About a fortnight afterwards, I was sent for, not to Court; oh no, no\r\nfear of that for an Englishman!--but to the death-bed of our poor\r\nChocolous; for whom I had always entertained sincere affection and\r\nprofound respect. I found him as lively as ever, and jumping, to show me\r\nhow his theories had been established. There was no Mrs. Chocolous, as\r\nperhaps you know; and nobody to care for him, except the\r\nmaid-of-all-work. But she was crying dreadfully; and he was proving to\r\nher some new and unsustainable theory of bacilli.\r\n\r\n\"'I vill be dead,' he cried, 'zis time to-morrow. For vy? For because my\r\nteory is ze true one. Both of zem, both of zem, proved in one second!\r\nPrachibot, if you leeve, tree tousand year, never you vill have sush\r\ntriomp!'\r\n\r\n\"Of course I could not contradict him then; but as soon as I came to\r\nhear all about it, the only thing proved was the soundness of my advice.\r\nFor it seems, that as soon as he had been introduced, and received most\r\ngraciously; another great German appeared, of even superior eminence in\r\nanother line. And our poor friend Chocolous was kindly asked to sit. He\r\npretended not to hear, and made a very fine retreat, with a deep bow,\r\nand one heel going back behind the other. But not even so, could he back\r\nout. Very nicely, but firmly, was he told, (in total ignorance of all\r\nhis magnificent theories) to sit down; which is not supposed to be the\r\nproper thing, in such a presence. The chairs were rather large, and had\r\na very slippery covering, being at the same time hard, and bright.\r\nNothing could be worse for a man to sit upon, who was cherishing hopes\r\nof inaugurating the recovery of our lost member.\r\n\r\n\"What could he do? He could neither sit down, nor by any means refuse to\r\ndo so; the third course (as a great master of shuffling puts it) was to\r\nsit, and yet not to sit. And this the poor Professor was obliged to do,\r\nin a posture of cardinal adversity. He brought his _scapulæ_ to bear\r\nagainst the back of the chair, which was upright; then he super-posed,\r\nbut not imposed, the sessile portion of his organisation; supporting his\r\nweight by his right wrist entirely, and maintaining non-contact in the\r\ncritical quarters with the unscientific institution. This was most\r\nskilfully managed; as only a man deeply grounded in organisation could\r\nhave organised it; and but for one little point, all had been well. This\r\npoint was the simultaneity, of the great bacillar experiment, with the\r\nperil to caudal aspirations. Between two stools, or rather I should say,\r\nbetween the ulnar and the lumbar difficulty, Science lost one of her\r\nvery brightest stars. The ligatures, skilfully placed to confine the\r\nexperiment to a safe area, gave way, beneath the whole burden of a\r\nwell-fed frame. The issue need not be described, although most deeply\r\ninteresting. Mortification ensued; and our friend, acknowledged to be\r\nforemost in a most important study, left nothing but his papers, which I\r\nam now preparing, with the aid of Mullicles, for publication.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a sad case!\" I could not help exclaiming; \"really it seems, as if\r\nScience destroyed all her great admirers, as the female spider does; in\r\naddition to all the poor flies of the public. I do hope, Professor, that\r\nyou will take care of yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no fear for me, because all my theories are sound,\" he\r\nreplied, with a sweet smile of certainty; \"but I have great misgivings\r\nabout Mullicles. Histic fluxion, as he calls it, is his craze; and he\r\npushes his experiments beyond the bounds of prudence. I am sure that it\r\nmust be a great blow to you, to have heard, that of the four learned\r\nmen, who desired to promote your interests in early life, two alone are\r\nleft, for the study of your case. You are come to me, I doubt not,\r\nbecause you have discovered, with the aid of Professor Megalow (from\r\nwhom I have heard of you, more than once, as a very promising acolyte)\r\nthat my theory about you was the true one. I would only request you to\r\nbe candid with me.\"\r\n\r\nI was touched by his diffidence, and gladly told him everything; how the\r\ndeath of my dear father had entirely deprived me of all my early\r\nbuoyancy through sudden exultation; and how, instead of that, my only\r\ntendency to rise was apparently created now by wrath, and sense of\r\nwrong. But even this, I told him, was a rare case now; especially as I\r\nhad done my utmost to repress it. Then I added, that I wished, for\r\nreasons which I need not mention, to recover my peculiar gift, but keep\r\nit under my own control.\r\n\r\n\"I can promise you all but that last,\" he replied; \"and that you can\r\nonly secure, by returning to your former system of artificial weights.\r\nSee how exactly everything has verified my diagnosis! 'Organic\r\nlevigation' was the term I used, as if by a happy insight; and no better\r\nexplanation can be rendered now. My dear young friend, you must place\r\nyourself entirely under my directions. But unhappily, I cannot undertake\r\nthe matter _gratis_; though my ardour for Science would induce me so to\r\ndo, if my circumstances were as they ought to be. You are well aware of\r\nthe disgraceful fact, that in England there is no State-subvention for\r\nthe highest of all purposes--scientific research. We spend all our\r\nsubstance, and our brains, without emolument, or honour; while those who\r\nmake improvements in some trumpery handicraft, or poison the public by\r\npure quackery, obtain position, and title, and large fortunes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not the fame!\" I answered with my usual politeness; and he smiled,\r\nand his pale, worn eyes glistened, through his double glasses.\r\n\r\nThen I asked what his terms would be; and found them so moderate, that I\r\ndoubled them; as was only fair to his high repute. But he made me pledge\r\nmy honour to one thing--that during his lifetime I would not divulge his\r\nmethod, if it proved successful. I am happy to say that he still is\r\nliving, and of very great renown, and good position; so that my promise\r\nremains still in force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL EMERGENCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything seemed to go well with me now, except for one sad\r\nvisitation--the loss of my dear Uncle William. He, by his brave\r\nresignation, and patience, childlike simplicity, and wonderful yarns, as\r\nwell as pipes, and grog, and quids--whenever he could get them--had\r\nendeared himself greatly, in a few days, not only to me, but to all at\r\nthe Bower. Even _Grip_ went to see him, and took such a fancy to him,\r\nthat he would sit with his chin in the wasted brown hand, and look at\r\nhim sorrowfully by the hour; as if they were two poor old broken chaps\r\ntogether. And the night Uncle Bill died, _Grip_ never stopped howling;\r\nand he went about the place, and scarcely ate a bit of victuals, until\r\nhe had attended the funeral.\r\n\r\nBut Uncle Bill's death, though very sad to us, was painless, and placid,\r\nand happy to himself. He had said, that he should like to see the\r\nchaplain; and accordingly Mr. Cope came in. We left them to themselves,\r\nand there was not much said; only they had a little prayer together; and\r\nMr. Cope asked him if he had any doubts, and he said \"None whatever.\" In\r\nthe morning, he was passed beyond all doubts; and I, who sat up with\r\nhim, cannot say exactly the hour, when his Angel came for him.\r\n\r\nHe always felt faith in the Lord, all his life; and though he may not\r\nhave lived up to it, surely his last end was better than that of a man\r\nwho endeavours to outstrip the Devil, by growing a tail to frighten him.\r\n\r\nOne thing surprised me about Uncle Bill, as soon as I had spirit to\r\nthink of it; and that was--why had he never said a word about\r\n_Jumbilug's_ eyes, to my mother, or myself, when he knew that his last\r\ntime for business was come? I had even gone so far as to ask him, (when\r\nDr. Flebotham pronounced his own task accomplished) whether he would\r\nlike me to bring them in, and show them; or whether there was anything\r\nhe wished to say about them. But he put his pipe-stem to his lips--for\r\nhe was allowed to do anything now, that would make his last hours\r\ntranquil--and he tried to shake his head, as if to say--\"all that is\r\nsettled.\" And the only provision he made for death, (as regards this\r\nworld, and its dealings) was to have his favourite pipe buried with him,\r\nand a quarter of a pound of bird's-eye, and a box of the \"Bottom of the\r\nAtlantic Matches,\" which nothing can prevent from striking. For he had\r\nbeen among savage tribes so much, that all this became orthodox on his\r\npart.\r\n\r\nWhether he was lawyer enough to know--for sailors do pick up queer\r\nthings--that he saved the family £4,500, by this behaviour; or whether\r\nit was only that he would not now disturb himself, and did not wish to\r\nbe reminded of the only stars, that living people care for; or whether\r\nhe would not confuse his last pipe; at any rate, in the most decisive\r\nmanner, he conveyed to me, that he would have no more said about\r\n_Jumbilug's_ eyes--which he would have condemned, at any less momentous\r\nmoment--but all was to be, as he had once for all directed. This made me\r\nfeel a certain sense of trusteeship; as if I were placed in full charge\r\nof these stones, and must most exactly do, whatever he had ordered.\r\n\r\nBut when I was told, for the first time, of their value, I found it very\r\nhard to trust my ears. Such a great injustice did it seem to me, (who\r\nhave an ardent love of fairness) that the cleverest man in the world\r\nmight work, for sixty years--the entire parenthesis of anybody's meaning\r\nhere--without earning half of the value of one of the eyes of a\r\nbarbarous idol.\r\n\r\nFor the great jewel-merchant in Hatton Garden, to whom Sir Roland took\r\nme, could scarcely believe his own eyes at first--the day being of\r\nLondon texture--until he put on a strong jet of light (reflected by\r\nwhite mirrors) and took a double magnifier, and went into the very\r\nbottom of both stones. Even then, he was almost afraid of his own\r\njudgment, and looked at us doubtfully, and shook his head, and even the\r\nhand that held such treasures.\r\n\r\n\"If I did not know you to be Sir Roland Twentifold, and this young\r\ngentleman to be a friend of yours, and therefore above all suspicion, it\r\nwould be my duty to call in the police, and place these in their\r\ncharge,\" he said; \"as the produce of some tremendous robbery. I have\r\nbeen in the trade, for more than forty years, and Crown jewels, and\r\nthose of the great R---- family have passed through my hands; but until\r\nnow, never such a pair of blue diamonds as these are. They must be well\r\nknown; they must have a great history. I know all the leading gems of\r\nEurope; but these are entirely new to me. Is there any reason, why I\r\nshould not know the story?\"\r\n\r\n\"None whatever,\" I replied, \"if you will receive it first in confidence.\r\nAnd then if you think that my right to them is perfect, I care not how\r\nthe story spreads.\"\r\n\r\nI told him all I knew; while he listened with deep interest, and so did\r\nSir Roland, who had not heard all till then. I insisted especially upon\r\nUncle William's character, and his great superiority to piracy, or\r\nrapine; and enforced the fact that he had not run away with that idol,\r\nwith any view to its value, but simply as a deed of justice, against a\r\nmost horrible tribe of cannibals, who had eaten as much as seventeen\r\nwhite men, and had vowed the sole survivor as a sacrifice, to the image\r\nwith these resplendent eyes. The jeweller's sympathies went warmly with\r\nme, and with Uncle Bill in his operations; but he could not help\r\nsighing, and I asked him why.\r\n\r\n\"Because I never had such a chance myself;\" he answered, with a candid\r\nsmile. \"And to think of your luck, in escaping all duty! Your Uncle?\r\nWhy, let me see--three per cent. They could not have been valued for\r\nprobate, or administration, at less than £150,000; and probably I should\r\nhave had to appraise them. Since the disappearance of the French blue\r\ndiamond, there is nothing in that line to come near them. Each of them\r\nis worth at least two Hope's; that is, if they cut, as I am sure they\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is there not some ground to fear,\" I asked, \"that when all the\r\nfacts become known, our Government might insist upon restoring them?\r\nThey seem to exist for the purpose of surrendering every British right,\r\nwhether public, or private.\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly they do,\" he answered sadly; \"but your very clever Uncle\r\nhas provided against that. You can make oath, with clear conscience,\r\nthat you do not know the name of the place they came from; and if they\r\nwere there three hundred years, how can they be traced from Borneo? No,\r\nyou need not have the smallest apprehension about that. They belong to\r\nyou as absolutely, as the watch now in your pocket. And I congratulate\r\nyou warmly, upon such a grand possession.\"\r\n\r\nThen I asked him, with some diffidence, what the fee for his opinion\r\nwas. But he said, \"None. Only when you have them cut, I should like it\r\nto be done through our house, if you think fit. We are proud to say now\r\nthat such work can be done in London, as well, or even better than in\r\nAmsterdam. It is a new industry, and deserves to be encouraged. And to\r\nmake a good job of such gems as those, would give a fine impetus to the\r\nEnglish art.\"\r\n\r\nThis I promised gladly; and after some kind words of caution from him,\r\nand of good advice from Roly--who never left anything unhandled--we took\r\na cab direct to \"Placid Bower,\" feeling as important, I do believe, as\r\nany two young men in all London.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of Sir Roland, who dined with us that day, I handed to\r\nmy mother that one of the two stones, which the jeweller had pointed\r\nout, as rather the more precious. But she was so amazed, when we had\r\ntold her all the story, that it was quite impossible to refrain from\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"You expect me to believe a single word of that!\" she cried, having\r\nscant faith in youthful verity. \"No, no, Master Tommy, I was born before\r\nyou were. And what would your dear father have said, to hear such\r\nthings! Your poor Uncle William was a man of such a nature, that if he\r\nhad twelve pockets, there were twenty-four holes in them. He would have\r\ntold me, of course, not you; if he had thought them worth speaking of.\r\nHe had daily opportunity of testing my discretion. Put them under your\r\npillow, Tommy, and don't let me hear any more of them.\" And she marched\r\naway, leaving her blue diamond contemptuously, in the fingerglass.\r\n\r\n\"Take her at her word, you millionaire of a Tommy;\" Sir Roland said to\r\nme, when he had shut the door.\r\n\r\nAnd at first I was so touchy, that I felt inclined to do so. But better\r\nsense prevailed; and on the following day, I left both the jewels at our\r\nbanker's, (one in my mother's name, and the other in my own) locked up\r\nin a box, with other valuables. And this was a great weight off my mind;\r\nand I said to myself, as I came away, \"My blue eye shall never see the\r\nlight again; unless it is to please a pair of lustrous brown ones, a\r\nmillion times more beautiful than any jewel ever seen. But, alas, I\r\nshall never have such luck as that!\"\r\n\r\nBefore I had time to fetch many sighs about it, or even to be certain\r\nthat I need sigh at all, (for Hope has a liking for my heart, because\r\nshe finds herself so well treated there) behold, there came to pass a\r\nthing, that drove me to the very place, whither I was longing for to go.\r\n\r\n\"This very day,\" Sir Roland cried, as he jumped off his horse, and left\r\n_Grip_ to mind him, \"this very day, Mrs. Upmore, if you please, you must\r\nsend your dear son down to Larkmount-on-the-hill. The powers of evil are\r\nconspiring against him; and nothing but his lovely face, and hair, and\r\nthe way he lets the sunshine come under his heels, will scatter the\r\ndevices of the democrats. Now, you hate all democracy; you know you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I understand the nature of it, Sir Roland,\" said my mother,\r\nwho was proud of accuracy, \"I am not much for it, as a question of\r\ndegree. They sweep away all degrees, or try to do so. And how can Tommy\r\never be an M.A. then?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right--too right I am sorry to say;\" Sir Roland replied quite\r\ngravely, for he always agreed most warmly with ladies, and by so doing\r\ngenerally converted them; \"better had he not attempt to be an M.A., with\r\nthe present Government in power. He will be exposed to the most fearful\r\nrisk. If the measures now proposed are passed next year, there are very\r\nsolid grounds for believing that a bonfire will be made of M.A.'s upon\r\nHampstead Heath, to celebrate the Democratic triumph. You saw the\r\nMartyr's Memorial at Oxford, when you went to see what Tommy was up to\r\nonce?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, Sir Roland, all cut into small ribs, not as if they had caught\r\nfire at all, but as clean as the three Holy Children. But what I thought\r\nmost of, was the College halls, and kitchens, and the places with a\r\nsliding shutter, where the butter is buttery, and no best Dorset.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in vain is it that ladies have such powers of observation. But how\r\nwould you like to see all that swept away, and instead of it,\r\nBoard-schools, dissenting chapels, co-operative stores, and social\r\nscience institutes? And unless you send Tommy down with me to Larkmount,\r\nthat is all we shall have to look forward to. He alone can save the\r\nCountry, from the vast deluge of anarchy now pouring in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I do feel it hard upon me,\" dear mother answered, \"to be losing\r\nhim again; almost before he has had time to get into gray mourning for\r\nhis uncle. But his dear father's foremost principle was,--and he was\r\nputting by money, to support it--that Tommy should go into Parliament,\r\nand speak up courageously for the boiling interest. It is useless to\r\nhope that Jack Windsor could do it, even if there were no other\r\nchildren; he can count sixpennyworth of halfpence; but if you ask him\r\nwhy, he stares at you. But Tommy is always as pat with an answer, as a\r\nCheap-jack, or a Prime-minister; and sometimes more than he should say\r\nto the mother, that brought him up, and fermented him. And now it seems\r\na Providence, Sir Roland, to speak without offence to any one, that he\r\nshould be M.A. and M.P., without paying anything at all expensive; and\r\nmake the one defend the other, against the people his dear father could\r\nnever put up with, though many times they promised him their custom.\"\r\n\r\n\"And never gave it, I'll answer for that,\" Sir Roland replied most\r\ntruly. \"Tommy, you have heard what your kind mother says; and I hope\r\nyou will carry out her principles; all of which are of the very highest\r\norder.\"\r\n\r\nThis settled everything; and next day, my dear mother packed me up,\r\nwithout more than one tear on the top of my shirts, about which she was\r\nmost particular. But she looked at me very hard, when she had finished;\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n\"Why, mercy on me, child, what a fidget you have become, about your\r\nclothes! When you used to go to Oxford, the trouble always was, to get\r\nyou to look twice into your chest of drawers. But now, one would think,\r\nthat your own mother knew nothing about what is fit for you to wear!\r\nThere is something going on down there, I do believe, that you don't\r\nthink fit to trust me with. I have always understood that those voters\r\nof the public are very crafty people, to have to deal with. And they\r\nmake you promise almost anything they like. Now, don't you go, and\r\npromise to marry any of their daughters, without consulting me about it.\r\nYou are a great catch now, and entitled to look high. Now, bear my words\r\nin mind, although I see that you don't mean to tell me anything. You are\r\njust like your father, when it comes to that.\"\r\n\r\nFor I felt, that I had no right to tell her a word about Laura\r\nTwentifold, until I knew more; and it would have been more than I could\r\nbear to have the matter lightly spoken of, and constantly referred to,\r\nas a common love-affair; while to me it was so deep, and sacred. And I\r\nknew, that she would hurry off at once to Mrs. Windsor, and perhaps Mrs.\r\nChumps, to have a good talk over it; which would have been to me a\r\ndreadful profanation. So I made her mind comfortable, and then departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nVOTE FOR TOMMY!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was indeed high time for me to be stirring, if I meant to be returned\r\nfor Larkmount; about which I cared supremely little, except as a\r\nstepping-stone, towards my true love, and ambition. For, although the\r\ninfluence of the Towers should have been paramount in the borough, as a\r\nmatter of right and long usage, the times were become so perverted that\r\na brisk opposition was got up; and some Liberal orators had been brought\r\ndown, who had nothing whatever to do with the place, and cared not a\r\nfarthing for its interests. My competitor was the owner of a paper-mill,\r\nout of which he had made a good lump of money; and he announced his\r\nintention to spend it freely, for the national good--as he presumed to\r\nsay. As yet, I had only paid a single visit to the enlightened electors,\r\nand their wives; whereas Mr. Squelch had been working hard for months,\r\nwith his agents, committees, and \"organisation\" of every kind, in full\r\nactivity. But Sir Roland was as confident, as ever he could be, and made\r\nlight of the enemy's start in advance.\r\n\r\n\"They don't understand human nature,\" he said; \"all their promises will\r\nhave got stale, and insipid, and all their bolts of clap-trap will have\r\nbeen shot. In fact they will have bored the poor electors so, that we\r\nshall be a welcome novelty. We shall have all the ladies on our side, of\r\ncourse; and in these days of ballot, that is everything. An elector may\r\npromise as much as he pleases; but he dare not tell a lie about his\r\nvote, to his wife.\"\r\n\r\nAlso concerning my infinitely higher, and a thousandfold dearer\r\nambition, it was high time for me to be doing my best; and I grew hot\r\nand cold, when I thought of it. Hot, when I heard from Sir Roland--who\r\ntook the pleasure of a cannibal in telling me, while I could only reply,\r\n\"Oh yes,\" \"To be sure,\" \"Very nice,\" and such like inanities, because of\r\nthe compact between us,--how my Lord This, and Sir Somebody That, had\r\nbeen staying at the Towers, and were most agreeable, and had shot very\r\nfairly, and had admired the neighbourhood, (discharging far too well, I\r\nfeared, that duty towards their neighbour) and had promised most readily\r\nto come again, for the hunting, and the woodcocks, in November.\r\n\r\nAnd cold I became, (quite as cold as a boy, who wants to have his bed\r\nwarmed, and a treacle-posset, and his head wrapped up in a blanket)\r\nwhenever I fell back upon my own poor chances, and knew that I must put\r\nthem to the trial very soon.\r\n\r\nThis was quite certain to require all my skill, as well as a great deal\r\nof good luck at the moment. And one piece of fortune befriended me; to\r\nwit, that none of those owners of the earth were there, at the time of\r\nmy arrival. Two were to come, in about ten days' time; but I hoped to\r\nget on a good bit before that, and talk of them as strangers, by the\r\ntime they came. For ladies in the country, who have not been spoiled in\r\nLondon, like the faces they are accustomed to.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all that, my hopes were low; not only because of my\r\ncommercial birth, and want of high style, and of dashing disdain, and a\r\ndozen other lofty attributes; but also because of my natural deficiency\r\nin crass weight, and stolid material.\r\n\r\nSomebody might say to the most perfect of all created beings, somebody\r\nperhaps, with a foot like a duck, and a back like the bole of a\r\nChurchyard yew,--\"Well, if I did have a husband at all, I should like\r\none to make a mark, when the ground is wet; I should like one, who could\r\ncome round a corner safely, without looking for a church-tower, to see\r\nwhat way the wind is. Ah, I see how he manages so well down\r\nhere--because you've got such a lot of weathercocks! Miss Twentifold,\r\nwhat would you say to yourself, for slighting good solid Englishmen, if\r\nyour bridegroom made it a honey-moon indeed, by soaring to the moon, and\r\nleaving you to weigh the honey?\"\r\n\r\nTruly, there are people who would say all that; however far beyond their\r\nown business it might be. But would they have the chance of saying it?\r\nIf so, they would be welcome; for the right word would be mine--the word\r\nthat was worth all the world, and its works.\r\n\r\nWhile I was entering into these thoughts, on the road from the Station\r\nto Twentifold Towers, Sir Roland was preparing a little device; in my\r\nopinion neither friendly, nor brotherly, nor even seemly. Having\r\nreturned the day before, he sent a groom with a dog-cart, to bring me\r\nand my luggage from the Railway, according to the train agreed upon;\r\nand a pleasant drive it would have been, except for the troubles\r\ninvading my heart. But just as we came to a little gate, opening into\r\nthe grounds, about half a mile from the house, the man said to me,\r\n\r\n\"If you please, sir, would you mind taking the short cut here to the\r\nfront? I have got a little job to do at the blacksmith's; and Sir Roland\r\nsaid, I had better not keep you waiting I shall be home with your traps,\r\nabout a quarter of an hour after you.\"\r\n\r\nI was rather glad to stretch my legs with a pleasant walk, on such a\r\nlovely afternoon; so I took my bit of oak, with which I had gone to\r\nencounter Professor Brachipod, and cheerfully entered on the footpath\r\nway. But when I had walked about a hundred yards, swinging my stick in\r\ndefiance of dull care, and indulging in a song (which is a favourite of\r\nmine, because I have steered so many crews to triumph with it)--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The flag that braves a thousand years,\r\n        The battle, and the breeze!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSuddenly in a bosky dell, I stood face to face with Sir Roland, and his\r\nsister. Laura was amazed; and so was I. And Sir Roland maliciously kept\r\nhis eyes intent upon his sister's face.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Tommy, what a nightingale you are!\" he said. \"We took a little\r\nstroll, for the chance of this meeting. Well done, old fellow! I am very\r\nglad to see you. I forgot to tell you, Laura, what a treat we might\r\nexpect. Why, you don't seem at all glad to see friend Tommy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Upmore knows that I am always glad to see him;\" the sweet voice,\r\nwhich always made me tremble, replied; as she put her hand in mine, and\r\nfaced the sun, with a lovelier blush than he can kindle in the west;\r\n\"but I did not in the least expect to see him; and in these lonely\r\nplaces, one is taken by surprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so indeed!\" I exclaimed, with a glance of great\r\nindignation at her brother, who was smiling, as calmly as if he had done\r\nnothing; \"but Sir Roland thought, doubtless, that it was not worth\r\nwhile, to speak of a visitor so insignificant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure it was not that,\" she answered softly; \"but he is now so full\r\nof politics, that we must excuse him everything. For an hour, I have had\r\nto listen to nothing but a lecture upon the Constitution. Oh, I do think\r\nthe trees are so much more glorious, than the poor little men who cut\r\nthem down!\"\r\n\r\nThis was uncommonly clever on her part; for it set her brother off upon\r\nhis favourite tirade, which he never missed a chance of delivering. And\r\nso we walked into the avenue, pretending to listen with the deepest\r\ninterest; while I only knew that at my side was Laura; and she, to make\r\nup for the slight put upon me, gave many kind glances, and one or two\r\ndelicious smiles.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, remember, no waste of time, to-morrow!\" her brother said\r\nfirmly, as soon as he had got to the bottom of the very deep vials of\r\nhis wrath, by which time we were at the door almost; \"no spooning about\r\ntrees, or the beauties of nature, or any other beauties,--but good solid\r\nwork. We shall breakfast early, and have a long day at it. I shall drive\r\nyou to the \"_True-Blue Hotel_\" myself, and take with me a fellow, who\r\nhas a brother at the paper-mills, I have a grand trick against old\r\nSquelch, in the bottom of my turbid heart, as some ancient writer calls\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be getting very fond of tricks;\" cried his sister, as she\r\nran away, to dress for dinner; \"perhaps some will be played upon you,\r\nbefore long.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was my state now of mind, heart, and soul--as well as of body,\r\nwhich had long been in training for a great constitutional effort--that\r\nthe paper-mill-man might have passed through his mill, as waste paper,\r\nthe promises made him. Sir Roland had eight or nine carriages sent from\r\nthe Towers, of three generations, including some now in use for\r\ncock-lofts; and we took all the children of Larkmount, in batches, for a\r\ndrive, with their pinnies full of sugar-plums. There was nothing in the\r\nBribery Acts as yet, to make such a proceeding penal; though now, if a\r\ncandidate takes a fly out of the eye of a child, he is bound to ask\r\nfirmly--\"My dear, is your father an elector? Oh, then, I must put that\r\nfly back into your eye; or else my election will be null and void.\"\r\n\r\nBut the way these children enjoyed their drives, in a carriage with two\r\nhorses--for none of them had less--and a big coat of arms, and a hand\r\nsticking up; and the way they drummed their feet, and holloaed--\"Vote\r\nfor Tommy! Down with Squelch!\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Down with the paper-man, brown and old!\r\n     Up with young Tommy, all curls and gold!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n--it was indeed a day to make one proud of the British Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"We'll do it again. We'll do it three times; if you are all good\r\ntrue-blue children;\" Sir Roland said to the biggest-voiced ones, when\r\nthe horses had made a good day of it; \"blue jackets for the boys, and\r\nfor the pretty girls blue bonnets, or hats, if they stand to their\r\nprinciples. But no yellow, mind you; touch no dirty yellow. Yellow\r\nfever, and jaundice for you, if you do. You shall all have the Gee-gees,\r\nto go and vote for Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Vote for Tommy! All curls and gold!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWe heard the clear voices from the hill in chorus, for half a mile, or\r\nmore, of our homeward road.\r\n\r\nElated as I was, by this triumph of pure principles, and display of\r\nunselfish innocence, all I kept asking myself was this--\"Will a body,\r\nworth the Constituency piled on the top of the Constitution, and the\r\nKingdom on the top of the Continent, ever be persuaded to 'vote for\r\nTommy?' I must know my fate. I can't go on, like this. To-night I shall\r\nhave to carry on again, as if all I cared about was piano and\r\nback-gammon; and tobacco and billiards, afterwards. Roly is full of\r\nresources; but I seem somehow to have lost the very simplest move of\r\ntactics! Where are all my wits gone? I am only fit to be in the\r\nGovernment.\"\r\n\r\nBut if my wits stood me in no stead, Luck (which is a very far higher\r\npower, coming immediate from Heaven), she--for beyond any doubt she is\r\nfemale, like the Angels--down she came, and stood at my right hand, and\r\nordered me to listen, while she did my work for me.\r\n\r\n\"Roly,\" Lady Twentifold said, when I had sung my song about the flag,\r\nwhich was now become a plague; \"he has done a very hard day's work\r\nto-day, and he is not made of iron as you are. To-morrow, he shall have\r\na whole holiday, with me and Laura, at Crowton and Sunny Bay. You have\r\ngot business at Ipswich, I know, and will not be back till dinner-time.\r\nBut if Tommy will not find it dull to come with us, and the day is as\r\nfine as to-day has been, we will go and see Sunny Bay--such a pretty\r\nplace!--and look for shells, and sharks' teeth, and carnelians. Unless\r\nyou would rather go practising, Tommy, with the keeper, before they come\r\nshooting again? There are plenty of pheasants, in some places, still.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he had better go with you;\" Sir Roland answered for me, as he loved\r\nto do. \"The fates have been against Tommy's shooting so far. He has only\r\nbeen out with me twice at the rabbits, back in the summer; but I find\r\nthee apt; and duller should'st thou be than the fat cigar, Tommy--none\r\nshall teach thy young idea how to shoot, but I. Go thou with the mother,\r\nand play at periwinkles, and sand-hoppers, and cowries; an thou wilt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nSUNNY BAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the wide world, there are lovelier bays than any to be found upon\r\nour eastern coast. But people, whose happiness is only comparative, may\r\nhie them away to superlative places, of Italy, or of the Cannibal\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\nBut for me, there is no place that need be more lovely, than Sunny Bay,\r\nwhen there is no sun upon it; except what goes out from the shore into\r\nthe sea. A bay in the west takes an unfair advantage--it looks at its\r\nbest, when the world is looking at it. While nobody gets up to see the\r\nbest time of an easterly bay; or even if he does, he has nobody to\r\nadmire it with him. And what use to admire a thing, by oneself?\r\n\r\nYet anything, fit to be called a bay, is so rare upon the weary stretch\r\nof coast, that it must not be looked in the mouth too closely, nor\r\nmeasured by the red tape of Government survey. If only it have a fairly\r\ncarven curve, and two definite points not too far apart, a bay it is to\r\nbe thankful for; and one to be proud of, and rejoice in, if there are\r\nhills and trees around it.\r\n\r\nSunny Bay had all of these; and as we drove down the Crowton lane\r\ntowards it, I thought I had never seen anything so beautiful, the sea\r\nbeing gentle, and the sky clear and sweet. Lady Twentifold was pleased\r\nwith my delight; for many of her visitors made very little of it.\r\n\r\n\"It is the prettiest place upon the eastern coast; at least in my humble\r\nopinion,\" she said, \"though I do not pretend to be much of a judge. Roly\r\nmakes light of it, after all his travels. But to me the familiar places\r\nare the sweetest; when we think of dear friends, who have seen them with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at her eyes, still as beautiful as ever, and full of the warm\r\nhome-love, which gives soft beauty to the simplest things.\r\n\r\n\"Laura is like her!\" I said to myself; \"Laura is like her. What more can\r\nbe wished; except to share so sweet a heart?\"\r\n\r\nBut the first thing to do was to share the dinner, or luncheon perhaps\r\nis the stricter word, if strict words are needful in a matter where none\r\nwas. The carriage was sent away to the Inn at Crowton; for no house here\r\nintruded upon the pleasant meeting of land and sea. The rocks were just\r\nof the proper height, for table, chairs, and footstools, with bright\r\ngreen fringes, here and there, and mossy banks above the tide, and a\r\ncrystal rill for the weaker vessels, and white sand for dainty feet to\r\ntap. To me it appeared, that all was perfect; except my clumsy self,\r\nwith hands that trembled, and a heart that beat too fast.\r\n\r\n\"You are not well, my dear!\" Lady Twentifold exclaimed, for she often\r\naddressed me kindly thus, when strangers were not present; chiefly\r\nperhaps from my fancied likeness to the dear child she had lost. \"That\r\ncanvassing has been too much for you. You are not intended for public\r\nlife. I wish Roly would not force you into it so. Now, candidly, which\r\ndo you enjoy the most; such a day as yesterday, or a day like this?\"\r\n\r\nWith perfect truth, I answered--\"Oh, such a day as this, a million\r\ntimes! But, I am as well as I can be, and wonderfully happy, I assure\r\nyou. May I come, and look for shells with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure you may. But don't forget your promise to my loves of\r\nburrow-ducks. You had better begin, before the tide comes up. Here are\r\nthe flat trowel, and the long flag basket. Mind, the least touch brings\r\nthem off, if you take them by surprise. But if you let them know that\r\nyou want them, they won't come, without being knocked to pieces. My\r\nlittle dears were taken from their nest near here. And the scenery they\r\nprefer to everything, is limpets. Now, Laura, if you mean to try another\r\nsketch, I think this corner of the rocks, will be the best place for\r\nyou, according to the way the light falls now. Tommy will follow me, I\r\ndare say; as soon as he has done his duty to the little ducks.\"\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was not quite the one I should have made, if the\r\nordering had been left to me. Greatly as I admired, and loved \"my dear\r\nlady,\" I certainly should have sent her shell-hunting; while I stayed in\r\nthe corner, where the light fell so nicely, to offer to the nascent work\r\nof art the only criticism that ever is judicious--downright,\r\nthick-and-thin, admiration. However, not being the marshal of the\r\nforces, I made off, with tremendous zeal, to get a stock of limpets.\r\n\r\nBut, whether the tide was coming in too fast; or whether it was going\r\nout, at a pace to make one anxious about the welfare of the sea; or\r\nwhether the limpets took to jumping, like sand-hoppers, carrying their\r\nrocks along with them; or whether there was no strange phenomenon at\r\nall, save the one that is strangest yet surest of all--the result,\r\n(which I am not in a position to explain, even if it concerned any\r\nsalaried tide-waiter) was to fetch me very suddenly back to that corner;\r\nwith the loves of the burrow-ducks left to woo the waves.\r\n\r\nMy own love was gazing, and, as I hoped, dreaming, about something that\r\nher pencil could not trace. That little reed of so many whispers, with\r\nthe secret of Midas inside it, was lying on her block; and the only line\r\nit made, was its one true production--its own shadow. But who, that ever\r\nmoved it, and made it far more eloquent than any poet's tongue, could\r\nhave granted to it the expression of the face, now leaning over it?\r\n\r\nWhat sympathy have rocks? Ever since they first began, the chief object\r\nof their life has been to knock human beings (generally on the shins,\r\nand knees) and to petrify them in a cave, at every opportunity, and to\r\nkeep them from getting away from the sea, when the poor pulse is being\r\nbeaten out of them. Typical are they of all that is stubborn, rugged,\r\nand relentless; and now one of them fetched me a knock on the knee\r\n(while my presence of mind was with Laura) that sent me down into a\r\ngulley of sand, with my limpet-trowel running into me. This was a\r\npointed steel implement, such as bricklayers use; and my escape was\r\nnarrow. A heavy man must have had a very heavy wound, and perhaps a\r\nfatal one; for the handle of the trowel struck the ground before me,\r\nwhile the steel was pointing at my breast. But Nature has allowed me\r\nsome compensation for the short weight unfairly served out to\r\nme,--especially quickness of eye, and of body. In a word, what there is\r\nof me is good stuff--though not much to boast of, as you will remind me.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what a fearful thing! What a very dreadful thing! Darling Tommy,\r\nare you quite dead again? You are always doing it, for the good of\r\nothers. Oh, put your poor head up, and let me look at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not at all the right thing,\" I answered, after a groan or two,\r\nto ensure attention; \"the proper thing is, for me to look at you. And\r\nthat is how I got into all this trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"How good of you, Tommy! How very good of you! But do let me see, where\r\nyour dreadful wound is. I won't be afraid of it, I promise you I won't;\r\nbecause you got it all for my sake. You are always getting wounds, for\r\nmy sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I am. And why?\" As I put this question, I continued to lie in\r\nthe pit of my fall; the position being very nice, with Laura added to\r\nit. \"Because I am all wounds, and all dead, for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, don't be so stupid;\" she said, with one arm going under my side,\r\nin a spirit of inquiry, and the other coming very softly round my neck;\r\nto coax me to get up, if I could only find the power. \"You know, that\r\nyou never are stupid, unless you are stunned, or bewildered, through\r\nyour dreadful heroism. Oh, do let me try to get this fearful thing from\r\nunder you. I won't cut my hands; and if I do, what can it matter? Very\r\nlikely, you are bleeding to death, all this time. Why don't you let me\r\nsee, where your terrible wound is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, I have only got a little scratch,\" I answered; \"and I feel so\r\nvery comfortable, as I am. If you could put your face the very least bit\r\nnearer----\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think, you could lie quiet, while I go and fetch my mother? She\r\nhas so much presence of mind, and she is----\"\r\n\r\n\"How far away?\" I asked in an earnest whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nearly a mile along the sands, I am afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll get up at once, if you will kindly try to help me. Only\r\npromise, that you won't be frightened by a little scratch, dear. It is\r\nnothing but the very smallest trifle, I assure you. I know one thing\r\nthat would make it well at once. But there's no such luck for me as\r\nthat. Both hands, darling--I may call you that now, mayn't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just for the moment, while you are so sad, and helpless. Oh, but it is\r\na very serious wound! Let me tie it up for you; it is bleeding quite\r\nfast. I know what to do for you. I'll put some laver to it.\"\r\n\r\nThe point of the steel had just gashed my chin--a narrow shave for me;\r\nas an inch or two lower would have sent it into my throat, no doubt.\r\n\r\n\"If you could hold the laver to it, while I run and fetch dear\r\nmother----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for the world. I want you, and you only. I love your dear mother\r\nvery warmly, as you know. But oh, Laura, you can never know, how I love\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are taking an unfair advantage of me now;\" she whispered, as she\r\ndropped her eyes, but not her hands; \"I always thought, that you were\r\nso upright, and manly.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am;\" I answered, with my usual candour; \"but I don't care how I\r\nsneak, or what I do; if I can only get you to be fond of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What right have you to talk, with your chin in that condition? You will\r\nundo all the good my stupid hands can do you.\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her sweet eyes, to reproach me, as she spoke. And behold they\r\nwere full of large bright tears!\r\n\r\nI only said--\"Darling, darling, darling!\" each time, if possible, with\r\ngreater fervour. And she answered, with a smile--\"That is what I like to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nPREPARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government of England never guides us long, without guiding itself\r\ninto a fearful mess. The Tories, and the Radicals, are much alike in\r\nthis; but they differ very widely in their way of getting out of it. The\r\nformer resign, or appeal to the Country; which seldom responds to their\r\nchivalry. The latter jumble up, (instead of joining) issue; and jump\r\ninto Jack-of-the-lantern vagaries, all over any bog, where nobody can\r\nshoot them.\r\n\r\nThis was the policy in practice now. Our foreign relations, being\r\nanything but friendly, were to be allowed to please themselves at our\r\nexpense; while the gaze of the Country should be turned inward, and its\r\nhands employed in tearing their own vitality. Very grand measures were\r\nbeing prepared, for a fine subversion of established things; Liberal\r\nstatesmen being quite convinced by their own condition, that the\r\nuniverse was wrong. Of all these projects the Country heard, with its\r\nusual self-complacence, growing more and more accustomed to be managed,\r\nand driven, by some half-dozen busybodies; according to the usage of\r\ndemocracies.\r\n\r\n\"We must make a stand somewhere,\" said sensible people; but left\r\nsomebody else to make it. \"I draw the line at this,\" or \"I draw the line\r\nat that,\" declared the steadfast Briton; but if he drew it anywhere, it\r\nwas only in the clouds. What could any single hand, or even a hundred\r\nstout men, with a hundred hands apiece, avail, when things were gone so\r\nfar? The only man, who could extinguish the fire, was the very man\r\nblowing his large bellows at it; and in the headstrong weakness of his\r\nnature, he had shouted for a gentleman smaller than himself, but skilful\r\nin the manufacture of malignity.\r\n\r\nSo little desire had I, to share, in the rough affray impending, and so\r\nkeenly did I feel my own helplessness, that nothing but Sir Roland's\r\nstern resolve could have held me to the pledge of public life. All I\r\ncared for was, to be allowed to take my Laura, who had promised to give\r\nherself to me; and it recked me very little how the public might be\r\ngoverned, if my home might boast so sweet a Queen. But, although Lady\r\nTwentifold had given her consent, and waived all obstacles of pride and\r\nbirth, in the warmth of her good-will towards me, she made it a\r\ncondition that we must secure the concurrence of her son, as the head of\r\nthe family, and master of the race of Twentifold. And he (while as\r\nfriendly to me as ever, and faithful to his promise not to interfere)\r\nsternly pronounced that he never would consent, until I had rendered\r\nsome good service to the Country.\r\n\r\n\"How am I to do it?\" I inquired, with sound reason. \"Your condition\r\namounts to a total forbiddance. I have no great abilities, as you are\r\nwell aware. I shall never be an orator. I cannot even put ten big words\r\ntogether, without breaking down. To move the public ear now, the tongue\r\nmust thunder forth a thousand thumping words, for every hollow tooth of\r\nmeaning. And not only that, but a fellow must be able to work his words,\r\nso as to have two kinds of meaning--one for the public, and one for\r\nhimself; when he finds it important to deny them. No, Roly, I shall\r\nnever be distinguished. No honest man has any chance of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"How high can you go now, with a little indignation?\" he asked, instead\r\nof answering me. \"I know that you are practising; although you are so\r\ncrafty, that no one has a bit of chance of seeing you. Why should you be\r\nshy of a power, so much rarer than the most entrancing eloquence?\r\nPrepare; you can never prepare too much. If I could only do what you\r\ncan, Tommy, I would have a Dissolution in February, and be the Premier,\r\nafter a very little practice. Why don't you let me know, how you get\r\non?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you don't deserve it;\" I answered with some spirit; and by this\r\ntime he knew that I had some will of my own. \"If you had said to me,\r\nabout my darling Laura--'Tommy, you shall have her; and I trust to your\r\nown good feeling, not to leave a stone unturned, for the discomfiture of\r\nthe Radicals'--you might have had me for your dog,--to sit up, or dance\r\nround the room, or jump over your handkerchief, at order. That would\r\nhave been the wiser course for you to take.\"\r\n\r\nI spoke with some emotion; and to my mind my words appeared altogether\r\nunanswerable. But he looked at me steadily, and his face expressed no\r\nsense of contrition. Neither did his answer.\r\n\r\n\"I considered all that; but I found it would be an entire mistake, so\r\nto trust you. Not from any doubt of your honour, my dear fellow, or\r\ndesire to oblige me, after date. But simply because all your power would\r\nbe gone. For a twelvemonth, after you have married Laura--supposing that\r\nsuch a thing ever comes to pass--there will be no possibility of\r\nstirring up any indignation in your system. She is so confoundedly\r\nsweet-tempered, that you (who have got too much of that already)\r\ndoubling your stock--as married people do, at first--would regard the\r\nloss of India, or even a French invasion, with perfect equanimity; if\r\nthey let you alone with your Laura. And without indignation, you have no\r\nwings now. I have taken the trouble to ascertain that point. And my\r\nsettled conviction is, that after you are married, you will never fly\r\nagain, until you have a good fight with Laura.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a very low, and coarse way you have of putting things!\" I\r\nexclaimed with--as our Poets say--a mixture of emotions. Rapture, at the\r\nthought of ever having Laura; rage, at the base idea of ever falling out\r\nwith her; and astonishment at Sir Roland's foresight, and grasp of the\r\nmatter, in all its bearings. \"Why, you look upon me, entirely as a\r\nsubject for experiments!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" he made answer, with a smile so like my Laura's, (whenever she\r\nwanted to be funny) that his very worst sentiments might no more annoy\r\nme; \"you are too fond of regarding things, from a narrow point of view.\r\nScience possesses no interest for me. I take facts, as I find them. I\r\ncare not a stiver why you fly. I find that you do so; and that is\r\nenough. Science would wander about for years, asking everything she met,\r\nto explain the reason. But sense is quite satisfied with the mere fact;\r\nand proceeds at once to make it useful. Professor Megalow, who knows\r\neverything (except the iniquities of the Rads) has told me repeatedly,\r\nthat there has not been, for some centuries, any Englishman superior\r\n(even in his finest moments) to the power of gravitation; except a\r\ncertain Thomas Upmore. Now, I care not, two skips of a flea, for the\r\nfact that there have been, and perhaps still are, some exceptions, among\r\nAmerican aboriginals, to a law supposed to be universal. The British\r\npublic cannot see those fellows; and probably has never heard of them.\r\nBut the British public can see Tommy; and though capable no longer of\r\namazement--after all it has been dragged through--it is capable still of\r\na mild surprise, and of rubbing its eyes, and of trying to think. Our\r\nduty it is, to promote that effort--a sore, and a stiff one at first, no\r\ndoubt, after five years of Liberal surrender of that right. One rare\r\ngift, if properly used, may restore the use of another. Thought in the\r\nnational body is as rare, as flight in the individual. Restore the\r\ndefunct power, my dear boy; or at least restore the desire for it, which\r\nalone must prove fatal to the Radicals. And then, but not till then,\r\nwill I hail you as my brother, in the flesh, and in the spirit.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds very well, if I knew but how to do it,\" I answered with some\r\nkindly marvelling at the importance attached to me. \"You make it a _sine\r\nquâ non_ of brotherhood, in the humble being before you, '_ut patriæ sit\r\nidoneus, utilis agris_.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. You could not have put it better. His country, and the\r\nagricultural interest--very nearly dead, and with which dies England; as\r\nher bitter enemies have long found out. I have no fear of you, when you\r\nonce get in; which this Autumn Session will enable you to do. The writ\r\nwill be issued next week, the vacancy having been declared already.\r\nSquelch has not a chance; and you shall take your seat formally, so as\r\nto be ready for the great fight in the Spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Chumps?\" I asked; \"when is Bill coming down? He will do you a great\r\ndeal more good than I can. You seem to take it easily, about getting him\r\nin for Silverside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because there is no chance of any opposition. Flanker will not resign\r\nuntil February. I have had a little talk with him, and made that square.\r\nThe oddest part of all is, that I had the hardest work to get out my own\r\nwarming-pan. The others have behaved like gentlemen. There will be six\r\nof us, with the three who still remain. All staunch fellows, and not a\r\nfool among them, unless it is your humble servant. Come, and have a game\r\nof pyramids, friend Tommy.\"\r\n\r\nVery often, when I thought about Sir Roland Twentifold, I could not help\r\nfeeling surprised at his devotion to that dryest and dullest of all\r\ngames, at least in my opinion--politics. He was fond of field-sports, a\r\nbold rider, a good shot, a great lover of dogs, and of outdoor life, and\r\na hater of town-existence. Yet all these were only light pleasures to\r\nhim; while politics, and the strife of parties, seemed to be his\r\npassion. Handsome as he was, and a fine young man, with a rent-roll even\r\nfiner, and therefore at a high demand in the London market, he passed\r\namong all the fair snares, uncaught, with a pleasant smile justly\r\ndistributed.\r\n\r\nI ventured to ask Lady Twentifold once, how she, (so free from\r\nprejudice, and so full of good-will to the world at large) could have\r\nbrought up her son, with such set convictions, and principles, perfectly\r\nupright, but sometimes almost too unbending. She looked up, with a kind\r\nbut rather melancholy smile, from the paper, on which she was making a\r\npencil-sketch of a very grand oak-tree, still in its prime, but as\r\nrugged as a ruin.\r\n\r\n\"Who brought up this tree?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nature does everything now,\" I replied; \"it used to be the Lord; but it\r\nis Nature now. In a few years more, it will be Science. When we tire of\r\nthat, it will be Accident. And after that, Something even nobler.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the tree will be the tree;\" she answered gently, for her fear about\r\nme was that I might grow too scientific, if led into arguments against\r\nit; \"I prefer to say, that the Almighty made it so, though few ladies\r\nnow would agree with me. My dear Tommy, I have no more to do with the\r\nbent of Roly's mind, than I have with the twists, and turns, of this\r\ntree. He inherits it all from his grandfather; upon, I suppose, what the\r\nlearned people call, the system of alternation. My dear husband,\r\nRoland's father, would never go near Westminster; although we had a\r\nhouse in London then, to see our friends in the season. He sat for\r\nTwentibury, in his own chair, or in the saddle, according to the season;\r\nand everything went on as nicely as could be. But his father had been of\r\nan uncomfortable nature, desiring to make speeches, and to meddle\r\ngenerally, his grandfather having been a strong Jacobite; and the whole\r\nof it comes out again in my Roly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nFOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BENEFIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe alternate system, as Lady Twentifold called it, happily prevails in\r\nthe national England, as well as in the domestic. When one batch of\r\nStatesmen has done a world of harm, and are getting skilful at it--as in\r\nthree years, or four at the outside, they are sure to learn to be--a cry\r\nof \"Turn them out\" begins first in the gallery.\r\n\r\nThen the people who pay more, look up, and soon become inclined to rap\r\ntheir sticks. Before long, a general demand arises, for the room rather\r\nthan the company, of the individuals on the platform. If they are\r\ngentlemen, they make their bow, and retire, heartily wishing bad luck to\r\ntheir successors. But if they are--something that rhymes with Rads, they\r\npretend to hear nought, till a stunning row arises; and then they do\r\nthis, they call out--\r\n\r\n\"Policeman, let in all the public, who had got no tickets. They won't\r\nhave seen any part of our performance; and therefore they can judge\r\nimpartially.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the very thing going on just now. The Government had no leg\r\nleft to stand on,--a very good reason for their not going out,--but\r\nsitting on the quarter, which had been well kicked (to keep Britannia's\r\nin countenance) they were doing what we little boys in Maiden Lane were\r\nclever at, (until the new system abstracted our material) that is to\r\nsay, making go-cartfuls of dust, to blow through a pipe at the inquiring\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nSeven measures, of primary importance, had been promised; and hecatons\r\nof wise rogues had been sent round, to inoculate the public with an itch\r\nfor home-dust, as a pleasant little change from the national mud-stains.\r\nAnd a flourish of trumpets had filled the air of England, with a\r\nKrakatoa volume of that fine material, which contains the germs of\r\neverything. In the gracious speech from (their own cracks in) the\r\nThrone, Ministers solemnly informed the Country, that internal repairs\r\nwere its urgent need, and the only way to make them was to pull it all\r\nin pieces, and double all the stuff, with the blessing of the Lord. The\r\ngood old material had groaned at this; but what is the use of groaning,\r\nwith the hatchet in the air?\r\n\r\nThe first need of all was to get rid of landowners. Land belongs to\r\nevery one, and therefore to no one. Why have men got feet, except to\r\nplant them where they like? Nature has implanted in the human heart a\r\nprofound desire for the ownership of land. This proves, that everybody\r\nmust own land. But how, without kicking every other body out? Towards\r\nthat, the first step is, to kick out present owners. When the others get\r\nin, they must be kicked out too. There is no other way to have it\r\ncultivated properly; but this will ensure a \"succession of crops.\" A\r\nnarrow-minded man may fight hard to keep his foot upon what he has spent\r\nhis hands and mind in earning. But with a little patience, that evil\r\nwill die out.\r\n\r\nNothing can be simpler than to provide, that after a certain date, no\r\nlandowner shall be capable of prolonging his unjust tenure, by the\r\nsuppeditation of heirs to his estate. No physical means will be taken to\r\nthis end. He will still remain in full enjoyment of every British right,\r\ncivil, moral, social, and politico-oeconomical. But he must not have\r\nchildren; or if he dares to do so, the State will take them from him;\r\nand enlist them in the Army, at the usual age of British\r\nsoldiers--sixteen. Or if they be girls, they will have a free passage to\r\nthe Chiefs guaranteed to be ravaged by the Boers.\r\n\r\nThe second great measure was the Dust-bin franchise, or--at sufficient\r\ndistance from London to ensure intelligence--that of the Dust-pan. A\r\nsanitary, not to say a necessary measure, appealing to every heart and\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\nThe third, (whose preamble was eloquence itself, to such an extent that\r\nit cannot be cited) enabled the surrender, without consideration, of all\r\nstrong places, at present held by Her Majesty's forces, upon foreign\r\nsoil, or soil which (without such British occupation) would be foreign\r\nto this realm. Also, of all British ships of war, whether built to pass\r\nover the waves, or beneath them, together with all fittings, and\r\nimplements of war, (in proportions to be defined by the schedules\r\nthereafter) to the following Powers; that is to say, France, Russia, and\r\nthe Irish Republic, heretofore better known as the Land-League.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Bill provided for the abolition of every Municipal\r\nCorporation, or other corporate, or incorporate, body of burgesses, or\r\nancient freemen, making claim to deal with their own affairs, without\r\nlicence from the Home Secretary, or the Local Government Board, or the\r\nRailway Station, that might be nearest. Unless such Municipal Body could\r\nshow, that they had not been constituted for more than ten years, and\r\nconsisted entirely of Liberals.\r\n\r\nShort and sweet was the fifth Bill of Government. It had no preamble but\r\nthis, \"Whereas no Englishman knows how to govern himself,\" and then it\r\nenacted, that no man should play cards, chess, back-gammon, quoits,\r\nskittles, billiards, bagatelle, or any other game of chance, or skill,\r\nexcept in the presence of a certified policeman, at a distance of not\r\nless than half a mile from any Licensed Victualler, with no more than\r\ntwo sterling pence at stake; every such game to be discontinued,\r\nimmediately upon the Home-Secretary's yawn, which would be announced\r\nthroughout all English counties, by telephonic agency. But in Scotland,\r\nand Wales, and wherever else the Liberal cause was predominant, all\r\npeople might play, whenever, wherever, and for whatsoever sum, they\r\npleased.\r\n\r\nOf the sixth Bill, the man of the greatest experience, and insight to be\r\nfound, (at any cubeage of mileage from London, and all its stupidity)\r\ncould not make head, or tail; though he sat up, until a policeman from\r\nthe Home Department ordered him to bed. The only theory at all to be\r\nentertained about it, was that the gentleman, entrusted with the draft,\r\nhad taken another, to inspire him for his labours; or else had imbibed,\r\ntoo deeply perhaps, the spirit of his subject. It was all about Ireland,\r\n(from which the great St. Patrick expelled all the devils, on the herd\r\nof swine system,--except that they stopped at home, as well as swam the\r\nChannel) for nothing can ever convey, to the unmeasurable apogee of\r\nRadical brains, the wisdom of leaving unstirred Camerina. Since that\r\nparty, by means of cold summers and hot ravings, stuck their heels into\r\nthe Country's ribs, they had never allowed it to chew anything, but\r\nblack wild oats of Ireland. Perish India, perish Colonies, perish\r\nEngland, perish everything, except savages who stab all kindness! And\r\ntheir last panacea was this great measure,--to govern Ireland, according\r\nto Irish ideas. \"Whereas no Irishman obeys the laws, and thereby incurs,\r\nillegally, irrationally, and unjustly, the stigma of lawlessness; be it\r\nenacted, that after the passing of this Act, there shall be no laws in\r\nIreland.\" With the aid of Hibernian Members, this Bill was certain to\r\npass; and it could do no harm.\r\n\r\nThe seventh, and last, of the measures, upon which the Government staked\r\nits existence, (although they had fifty-two more, which they pledged\r\nthemselves to carry, if shoved on much) was sensible, and simple, and\r\nconsistent with all Legislation in that province. It merely prohibited\r\nthe opening of flowers, whether under glass, or out of doors, after six\r\no'clock p.m. Forasmuch as a scientific Member had assured the Licensed\r\nAnti-Victualler, that divers of them are guilty of intoxicating agency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nFAIR COUNSEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Of all truths, the surest is the truth well established by the\r\nbehaviour of Britons for many years now,--one man may steal a horse and\r\ncanter away, with every hat (even the owner's) tossed up, in applause of\r\nthe brilliant proceeding; while the same man's first cousin, (who peeped\r\nthrough the hedge, at the dew on grass, or the daisies) lies groaning in\r\nthe stocks, and perhaps touches his hat to the luck, which rides over\r\neverything. If any other man, of any English era, from Heptarchy to\r\nHecatarchy, (that last child of Hecate) had stolen from his happy mead,\r\nand lashed into foam, and thrown upon his knees, with his strong back\r\nbroken, that fine old nag the British Constitution; after the horse he\r\nwould have had the cart--which is not his own order of placing them--and\r\nthe cart would have been the one that drives to Tyburn.\"\r\n\r\nThus said Sir Roland. But owning no land, and no sentiments (therewith\r\ntransmitted, and tripled at every other generation) I scarcely knew who\r\nhad been stealing the horse, and only hoped that the nag would come home\r\nagain. For a horse is the most sacred of all property, infinitely dearer\r\nthan house, wife, or child--according to the precedents of English\r\nlaw--and very likely he deserves it.\r\n\r\nBut what did I care about horses, or hedges, or the clever man who made\r\nthe horse jump the hedge, (ready-saddled that he might steal him) or\r\neven the state of the British Constitution, which passes through so many\r\nhorse-chanting hands? My convictions were solid, and their grounds of\r\nthe same character; all grouted in with concrete, and pointed with best\r\nPortland cement, and not a bit of lime-blow anywhere, nor any sign of\r\njob-work to be found in them. Yet I am not ashamed to say,--because I\r\nshall secure all honest sympathies--that if my orders had been to make\r\ntea for the man who stole the horse, and a bran-mash and litter, for the\r\nanimal thus stolen, and to whistle to both of them, while they did their\r\nduties; the teapot, and the bucket, and the other necessaries, would not\r\nhave been out of the reach of my arm.\r\n\r\nBut, why? As everybody has taken to ask now. \"Why do you do this? And\r\nwhy don't you do that?\" The last thing that any man should have to\r\nexplain; because it leads him into a tremendous lot of lies. He has not\r\nthe least idea, why he did a single one of them. But he can't say that;\r\nand he sets to with after-thoughts, like a man who builds his house of\r\nthe chimney-pots.\r\n\r\nIn my case, however, there is no hard why. To the youngest, (or even the\r\noldest) intelligence, the flexibility of my principles, (though granitic\r\nas above) needs no explanation, when I set before them Laura.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Tommy, don't be made a party man;\" she said to me, just before\r\nParliament met, and while I was holding a skein of floss-silk (which is\r\ndifficult stuff to manage) that she might wind it for some lovely work.\r\n\r\n\"You are the party that makes me one;\" I answered, with a sigh, to earn\r\nsome gratitude; \"can anybody question the purity of my motives, when he\r\nlooks at you, dear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want compliments, instead of common sense, Tommy. Of politics I\r\nknow next to nothing, although I hear so much every day. But all I hear\r\nis upon one side so much, that I cannot help thinking, what the other\r\nside may be; and sometimes I should like you to try it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Darling, have you any thought, that has not its image, and counterpart\r\nwith me? Whatever passes through your most beautiful mind, at the very\r\nsame moment comes through mine. Only yours is so very superior.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Tommy, no. You must never say that, because I shall fear that you\r\nare laughing at me. Now, don't drop the silk--no, I don't look\r\nentrancing; and there was nothing whatever in the situation, to compel\r\nyou to do it, or me to allow it. You keep on manufacturing excuses of\r\nthat sort. And a rising Statesman should be above such conduct. Where\r\nwas I? You have quite deranged my thoughts. Oh, about the present state\r\nof the nation, to be sure! Roly is a great alarmist; but I cannot see\r\nany harm at all going on; and I do hate wars, and faction-fights. Why\r\nneed you go up, to take your seat at all? My father was in Parliament\r\ncontinually; but he took care never to go near it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither would I, if I could help it, Laura. But the times are very\r\ndifferent now. I have not the least chance, dear, of ever attaining what\r\nI long for most in all the world, except by going up; and more than\r\nthat, doing something to satisfy your dear brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, promise me one thing. Make beautiful speeches, (as you ought to\r\ndo, after all your practice, in saying fine things to me every day) and\r\nso become a leader of great principles; but try not to be harsh with any\r\none. It would spoil your nature, which is so sweet, and cheerful.\r\nRemember that the gentlemen, you disagree with, have a right to their\r\nown opinions, and a claim to be treated as gentlemen; instead of being\r\nabused--oh, in shocking language! Sometimes Roland makes me stare.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is very hot indeed,\" I could not help admitting, as I smiled at the\r\nhorror on the sweet kind face. \"But remember, dearest, that they give\r\nhim reason; for they care very little what they say themselves. And much\r\nworse than that, is what they do; at least in his honest opinion. He\r\nbelieves them to be ruining his Country. Can a warm-hearted young man be\r\nexpected to sprinkle rose-water on the destroyers of his Country?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the opposite extreme;\" she insisted, with more common sense\r\nthan could be gainsaid. \"Surely he might express what he feels, in\r\nforcible language; without imputing bad motives, and all sorts of\r\nwickedness, to people who may be doing harm, but are not doing it on\r\npurpose. At any rate, Tommy,--though he is past cure, and soon puts me\r\ndown, if I dare to say a word--I shall cease to believe, that you care\r\nfor me, if I hear of your going on so.\"\r\n\r\nWell, here was a cleft stick for me to be in! If I should fail to prove\r\nmyself a red-hot Tory Sir Roland would have none of me. Whereas, if I\r\nwon his good-will in that way, his sister would throw me over. Not that\r\nshe put it so coarsely as that; but when a girl says, that she will not\r\nbelieve in a man's affection for her, it generally means that her own\r\nfor him will be in still greater danger. My fortune is, always to get\r\ninto scrapes; and my nature, to get out of them.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to \"Placid Bower,\" as the elected of\r\nLarkmount-on-the-Hill, (for paper had not the least chance against soap)\r\nI found my dear mother in a state of much excitement, and ready to\r\nbelieve almost anything.\r\n\r\nNow, why does excitement so multiply the powers of faith, when it ought\r\nto do the opposite? However, so it does; and the slaves of \"pure reason\"\r\nare as credulous as any, in their ardour for it.\r\n\r\nBut my dear mother, (though the kindest-hearted, and most liberal-minded\r\nof nearly all women) always considered it an insult, to have pure\r\nreason, in any form, applied to her. And right she was, when the\r\npremises were hers, and she had bought out even the Ground-landlord.\r\n\r\n\"Tommy,\" she said, \"I am always most particular, in my expressions about\r\nthe Government. Your father took some excellent Government contracts,\r\nthrough his heroism with the three-inch hose; otherwise how could we\r\nhave bought this house? It is useless for you to talk, as if that\r\nGovernment was not the same as this one. That may be true; but it proves\r\nnothing. A Government must be the Government; and the Government it was,\r\nthat paid us so much money. So that I will hear no complaints against\r\nthem, for this trifle, or for that; because of all things, I have such a\r\nscorn for ingratitude. We may not like everything they do, about cards,\r\nand Policemen, and Railway Stations, and preventing my Evening\r\nPrimroses, because of the great abilities of Lord Beaconsfield. But we\r\nmust not be selfish, my dear son, nor expect to have everything to our\r\nliking. In a penny evening paper, which seems to be clever, and writes\r\nabout everything, I have found out everything they mean to do; and I\r\nquite agreed with him, that stupid people may misunderstand it. For\r\ninstance, I don't like giving up the fleet; though no doubt it is a most\r\nexpensive thing, and your dear Uncle William is now no more. But the\r\nfirst, and greatest of the Acts they mean to do, appears to me like a\r\nsign-post, with the finger of Providence upon it. Not that I should ever\r\nfeel the very least desire. And nothing could come of it, in my time, of\r\ncourse. But it would be so beautiful for you, my dear!\"\r\n\r\nIt took me some time, to discover what this meant. And my mother was not\r\nvery anxious to explain. But at last I found out, that the sign-post\r\npointed to my possession of the Twentifold estates, if Sir Roland were\r\nprohibited from having any heirs! That one of the best and simplest of\r\nher sex should have strayed into the snare of covetousness, (set by all\r\nmeasures, that dabble with property) determined me at once, to fight\r\nthat measure to the utmost.\r\n\r\nBill Chumps was come back from his wedding tour (having been called to\r\nthe bar, and the altar, one day after each other) but not as yet called\r\ninto Parliament, by the voice of Sir Roland Twentifold. His father gave\r\na dinner at \"_The Best End of the Scrag_,\" because his own house was not\r\nlarge enough; and no man, who was there, ever tastes a fine joint,\r\nwithout saying--\"Ah, but you should have had a cut from the baron, and\r\nthe saddle of old Chumps, that day. I have often tasted fine meat; but\r\nby George, sir, I never knew what velvet was till then!\" There was not a\r\nforeign kickshaw handed round; but any man, who wanted unintelligible\r\ncompounds, might go and fill his spoon, at the sideboard.\r\n\r\nSir Roland was there, and made the speech of the evening, a great deal\r\nbetter than Bill's--for Bill got his at the back of his tongue\r\nbeforehand, and then forgot every word of it; and his heart (being meant\r\nto play second fiddle) refused to come up, and take first one. But Roly\r\ndid really roll it out, in a style which gave me great hopes, that he\r\nmight upset most of the seven Bills of the enemy, without calling upon\r\nmy poor resources. And we had a jolly evening, I can assure you; though\r\nthere is no time to say any more about it now.\r\n\r\nIn return, I invited (with mother's good leave) a snug little party of\r\nloyal, enlightened, and truly large-hearted Conservatives to dinner, at\r\nour humble \"Placid Bower,\" on the Monday evening, with the Session\r\nbeginning on the following day. Mr. Windsor was there, and my old friend\r\nJack (now growing very partial to Belinda Chumps), as well as Mr.\r\nPeelings, the great potato-dealer, Mr. Blewitt of the Indigo factory,\r\nand of course Mr. Chumps, and his son William, and several other\r\ngentlemen, one of whom was the owner of \"_The Pratt Street Express_,\" a\r\nsound and influential journal. The object of the dinner was in the\r\nforemost place to dine; and then to deliver, for my comfort and\r\ndirection, the safest, most practical, and constitutional counsels, ever\r\nyet vouchsafed to any youthful representative.\r\n\r\nOf all these gentlemen, Jack included, there was not one but regarded me\r\nas sent into Parliament for his own use and benefit, as well as for a\r\nhigh example of wisdom, after following his advice. But the worst of it\r\nwas, that no two of them gave me the same advice, beyond general\r\nprecepts--to look sharp, to be cautious, to keep my pluck up. As soon as\r\nI wanted to thread my needle, and make my coat with their\r\nfurnishing--behold, it was not even yarn, or I might say wool, grown\r\nlong enough for combing. They had thought out none of the things they\r\ntalked of; and the round-hand lessons in a copy-book would serve me as\r\ngood a turn as theirs.\r\n\r\nHowever, they all agreed in condemning all the seven great measures of\r\nthe Government; although upon widely diverse grounds, disagreeing very\r\nwarmly, as to what their badness was. And this made me doubt, when I\r\ncame to dwell upon it, whether after all they could be so very bad. When\r\na dog is tail-piped, sympathy arises in every bosom that has tails\r\nbehind it; as soon as he is pelted, his merits grow on every one, who\r\ncannot find a stone to throw at him; but let him have sticks, bottles,\r\ntiles, flints, brickbats, each expressive of a different stand point,\r\nyet all promiscuously hurled at him,--and to every candid mind, that\r\ncannot get the window open, what is he, before he turns the corner? Why,\r\na hero, a martyr, a saint of a dog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHT WAY TO SURRENDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not in my power, to describe to you all the mixture, or the\r\nmagnitude, of my feelings, when I entered what our noble\r\njournalists--who choose words, like oysters, by their fatness--call the\r\n\"Portals of St. Stephen.\"\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to say, that a policeman met me; the _differentia_ of\r\nthat species being to jump up (like the teeth of Cadmus) outside of all\r\nrequirement, and to vanish (like Berenice's hair) inside it.\r\n\r\n\"You can't come in here, young man.\" He made this remark (looking over\r\nmy head, for his stature was six feet four, and his mouth opened\r\nupwards, as all good police-mouths do) in a tone, which conveyed that it\r\nwas unofficial, and required some apology for excess of affability.\r\n\r\n\"Peeler, yes he can though! He have a right in there;\" exclaimed a voice\r\nbehind me. \"He don't look very nobby p'raps, with all that hair, but he\r\nhave the same right as I have, Master Bobby. In marches Tommy Upmore,\r\nM.P. Tommy, now won't you shake hands with me? One old friend is worth a\r\nscore of new ones. Without me, so help me Sammy, never would you be\r\nhere, my boy! But I bears no malice, if your mind is the same. Shake\r\nhands, Tommy. There's worse gen'lemen to be found, than Joseph Cowle,\r\nEsquire, M.P.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps I have never received, or inflicted, a stronger sensation of\r\nsurprise. This may have been, to find my own importance (which must have\r\nbeen growing too rankly) assaulted by a policeman, and asserted by a\r\nchimney sweep.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Cowl?\" I asked, while giving him my hand; though his own would not\r\nhave been the worse for a \"_repetatur haustus_\" of the little boiler\r\nengine; \"Have you quite recovered from your dreadful cold?\"\r\n\r\n\"All Liberals suffers from throatiness,\" he replied; \"same as Tories\r\ndoes from cheekiness. M.P. for Chimneystacks now I am, Tommy; with an e\r\nto the tail of my name as well. The missus would have it, with her\r\neducation; though beyond me to pronounce it, without 'Cowly.' How you\r\nare going up the tree, hot cockles!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you up the chimney!\" I replied, with a glance at his dress, which\r\nwas worthy of the first of May. \"I never could have guessed who you\r\nwere; and how could you recognise me, Mr. Cowly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come now! Come now!\" He spoke, as a groom to a horse cutting too many\r\ncapers. \"After the print of you, on the title-page of all the leading\r\nmagazines--'Head of hair unparalleled outside the Polar regions, 3s. 6d.\r\nper bottle, and then throw away your combs!' Ah, Tommy, dust comes\r\nperfessional to me. We know what sends you into this here crib. Five\r\nhundred a week, and a royalty on sales. Pays better than ledgery\r\nslating!\"\r\n\r\nI had heard of these absurd reports ere now, and I never hope to hear\r\nthe last of them. Is there any credulity, among barbarians, a hundredth\r\npart as wild as that of the British public, in such matters? People of\r\nfair common sense, and with some experience of the world, believed that\r\nI was making an enormous income, by lending my name, and my\r\ncountenance--full-front, profile, and three-quarters--to fellows who\r\nadvertised hair-oil, balsams, electric, and fifty other sorts of comb,\r\nand even my own father's speciality, soap (such as cured all the\r\nconvicts)--not one of whom, I deeply regret to assure you, upon my\r\nhonour, as the member for Larkmount, ever paid me a shilling, or even\r\nasked me to dinner!\r\n\r\nBut one is apt to dwell too much upon such trifles. If I have put a\r\npenny (one per cent., honest) into any enterprising tradesman's pocket,\r\nI make him a present of the honest portion, which would not be worth\r\nlegal expenses.\r\n\r\nQuestions of a thousandfold more importance thronged upon me now, as I\r\nentered the House, under convoy of the Member for Chimneystacks, who\r\nwhispered to me, that the Dust-pan Bill was mainly of his own\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nHaving been introduced already, at the end of the Autumnal sitting, I\r\ndid not require his services in that way, but found a quiet corner for\r\nmy hat, and thought of the time when I put down my trencher some five\r\nyears ago in the chapel of _Corpus_.\r\n\r\nThen we rushed to hear the Royal Speech, rather like a mob of workmen,\r\nwhen the bell rings; and Sir Roland, whose strength lay in hurrying\r\nothers more than himself, appeared quite at his leisure, and laughed, as\r\nhe shook my hand, to find it trembling.\r\n\r\n\"You'll soon get over that;\" he said, as if he had been some fifty\r\nyears in Parliament. \"But who is your friend with the dark complexion?\"\r\n\r\nI told him the story; but he did not laugh at all heartily, as I had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\"An exceedingly dangerous fellow,\" he exclaimed. \"To be sure, I know all\r\nabout him now. One of the cleverest of all the Clasts, with the true\r\npass-word for the Cabinet. An anarchist, a socialist, a communist, and\r\neverything else that rhymes with fist, which is the only tool to meet\r\nthem with. Chumps is the man for such fellows; but we shall not have him\r\nhere for a fortnight. There now, Faithful Commons, go home. But they\r\nwill have no homes to go to, except a common, if all this comes to pass.\r\nAnd yet, how well it has been made to sound, for people who do not care\r\nfor sense!\"\r\n\r\nI was not of his opinion, upon that point. To my simple mind, plain\r\nEnglish words, mainly of English birth, and showing (one after other)\r\nwhat they mean, without any tangles or knots in them, are the right\r\nwords to move the English heart. Whoever speaks thus, wins all my ears,\r\nand goes a long way towards winning my heart; because he is my brother\r\nEnglishman. And even for sound, what power is there, whatever the scowl\r\nof the cloud may be, in long foreign thunder, below the horizon, and\r\nperhaps meaning something, in Italy, or Greece? But the Royal Speech, as\r\nusual, meant nothing anywhere; any more than the poor man, who foretells\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\n\"A greenhorn like you, Tommy,\" said Sir Roland, as if he had served at\r\nleast through the Long Parliament, \"would expect a great fight, and a\r\nsmash-up, at once, to follow up that palaver. But Thong, who knows\r\neverything, tells me that nothing, except little Irish rows, will be on\r\nfor a fortnight. And we can do a heap more good, he says, by going down\r\nto Silverside, and making Chumps safe, than by hanging about for any\r\ntrumpery divisions. It is jolly to see a fellow in his troubles. Suppose\r\nwe start to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart;\" I answered. And in saying this, I had used the\r\nright words, at the right moment. Not that I cared to see Bill in the\r\nstraw so much, although it is a pleasant spectacle; but that I did long,\r\nwith all my heart, to hear Laura's opinion on politics, with the whole\r\nof Her Majesty's speech cut out, and pasted up--as I had told her to do\r\nit--in the corner of my little room, where I meditated, and had left a\r\nwoolly outline of my head against the wall.\r\n\r\nOur work was to be at Silverside; where Bill and his father already were\r\nin residence, having taken the front that looked over the porch, on the\r\nHigh Street side of the \"_Bull-and-Mouth Hotel_.\" William Chumps,\r\nEsquire, had brought down \"his lady, a lovely bride of some nineteen\r\nsummers,\" as the _Silverside Constitutional_ described her, though I\r\ncould depose that she was four and twenty, being eleven months older\r\nthan myself, and no bride of any summer at all, but married to Bill for\r\nthree months of the winter. There was no taint of envy in my feelings.\r\nShe certainly looked very handsome, and had spent a good lump of her\r\n£12,000 in apparel; and Bill, of course, was mightily proud of her. But\r\nto dream, for a moment, that I was pining, as her melancholy manner\r\ntowards me conveyed,--I longed very often to bring my Laura; but a\r\nscene of that kind was not fitted for her! Patriotic sentiments\r\nrepressed my private anger; and I worked very hard for Bill; and wrote\r\nhim some good posters.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I am off for the _Towers_,\" I said to Sir Roland, only two days\r\nbefore the one fixed for the poll; \"I can't stand any more of this, and\r\nBill cannot want me any longer. I have had the very kindest letters from\r\nyour mother; and if you prefer racket to home-life, I don't. I will meet\r\nyou in London, any day you may appoint. But I must have a little quiet\r\nfirst. 'Tis as bad as a boat-race every day; and at Henley once I lost\r\nmy nerve, from too much of it, and we got whacked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see;\" he replied, as he was fond of doing. \"Another man's laurels,\r\nwreathed with orange-blossom, are hard to behold philosophically. Go,\r\nTommy, go and recruit your roses. But remember our compact. You have won\r\nnothing yet.\"\r\n\r\nHe might say what he pleased, when he smiled like Laura; though his\r\nsmile was strength, and hers was sweetness. That evening, I arrived\r\nwhere I was welcome; and the lovely blush, and soft whisper of a kiss,\r\nwere worth a world of politics, and Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe privilege of changing their minds has always been handsomely yielded\r\nto fair ladies; so long as they do not change there with their precious\r\nhearts, and pure affections. I found my Laura in a vastly different\r\npolitical vein from her previous one. She had taken some peeps into the\r\nnewspapers, not at all for the sake of the public, but for mine; and all\r\nthe deep warmth of her nature was stirred, by the Radical outrage, to\r\nher country and her home.\r\n\r\n\"About the suffrage, and the Constitution, and the Abstinence-cause, I\r\nknow nothing, or less than nothing--as gentlemen express it, though I\r\ndon't see how there can be less than nothing;\" she said to me, the very\r\nday after my arrival. \"But about right and wrong, everybody has a right\r\nto some opinion. For poor landowners, what is it but robbery, downright\r\nrobbery, to take away their land, and compel them to start afresh to\r\nearn more? But, oh, Tommy, Tommy, it takes all my breath away, to think\r\nof surrendering the English fleet to the bitterest enemies of England!\r\nOh, come in here, that I may show you something it will strengthen all\r\nyour principles to see.\"\r\n\r\nThere are few things more impressive to the model British mind--of which\r\nmine is, I am proud to say, a very tidy specimen--than a genuine series\r\nof ancestors in oil, proved (by internal and external evidence)\r\nextraneous to Wardour Street. Monuments perhaps have a still grander\r\nsavour, especially recumbent figures of the Knight, and his Lady, on a\r\nslab together, with the little ones that failed to come to harm,\r\nsculpturally coming up, like frogs for the blessing. But these are very\r\nrarely to be found in any Chancel, or Chapel, by the dozen; while the\r\npictures have an old family habit of keeping together. And to me it\r\nappeared that the Twentifold race were what our dear cousins, (who\r\nsupply our slang, after stealing our standards) call \"real grit,\" for\r\nnever having driven me, or anybody else, into this caravan of dead\r\nTwentifolds. For my gallery of ancestors was restricted to a photograph\r\nof my dear father, and an ancient daguerreotype of Uncle Bill.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Laura,\" I cried, when I saw them stretching, (like the windows of\r\na Stop-at-all-Stations-train) for a furlong without any corner; \"how can\r\nyou look at all these great people, and come down from them, to a nobody\r\nlike me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" she said. \"How dare you talk like that? I didn't bring you here,\r\nto be impudent, Tommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am astonished,\" I replied, \"astonished, that with all these\r\nlooking at you, you can look at me!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is there astonishing in it?\" she asked, coming up, and putting\r\nboth hands on my shoulders. \"It is, because I love you, dear.\"\r\n\r\nAt any other time, I must have kissed her, for those simple, and noble\r\nwords. It was no thought of all those ancestors that robbed me of that\r\npleasure; but I could not bear that she should look into my eyes, and\r\nsee how full they were of tears. Then I ventured to put my arm round her\r\nwaist, and she gave me her left hand, to comfort me.\r\n\r\n\"Here's the fine old gentleman, I brought you in to look at;\" her voice\r\nwas quite gay again, to pass the fuss over; \"does he look, as if he\r\nwould surrender our fleet, to the enemies of England?\"\r\n\r\n\"He looks fitter to make all her enemies surrender. What a resolute\r\nface, and how his foot is planted! Ah, if we had any man to plant his\r\nfoot, and shut his mouth in that style, now! All open mouth now--as Roly\r\nsays--open mouth, tongue instead of chin, and instead of strong fist,\r\nchattering fingers. A man of that stamp can never have belonged to any\r\ntime later than Nelson's. No Government would employ him now, in any of\r\nour trumpery 'demonstrations.' Let me look at him. It does me good.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture, being by no well-known artist, would doubtless be called a\r\ndaub, by all art-critics rightly flourishing. But to me it seemed full\r\nof life and spirit, not always to be found in mighty masters. An Admiral\r\nof the ancient days, and himself growing ancient, stood at a gangway\r\nbefore his men, to repel assault of boarders. In his right hand was a\r\nbig sword, flashing almost as brightly as his eyes, while his left hand\r\npointed to the Union-jack, waving through a cloud of smoke above.\r\n\r\n\"Who was he?\" I asked. \"He means to do it. I should have been sorry to\r\nboard that ship?\"\r\n\r\nShe drew from behind the frame a plate of gilt metal, engraved in red,\r\n\"Admiral Sir Rupert Towers-Twentifold, A.D. 1740.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he did it;\" she answered, with her eyes almost as bright as his;\r\n\"He cut three men down, with his own hand, and then leaped on board the\r\nSpanish ship, drove the crew below, and captured it. He was the sixth\r\nback in straight line from Roly; and Roly sometimes looks exactly like\r\nhim. That makes it my favourite picture of them all. Though I like Roly\r\nbetter, when he looks quiet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't do to look quiet always;\" I replied, with the spirit of the\r\nconflict caught; \"except for such sweet souls as you. Darling, you make\r\nlovely patchwork. Will you do a little job for me, without a word to any\r\none?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nSPARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government had intended wisely to deal the first of their seven\r\ngreat blows at the weal of their hostile Country, with the Bill (which\r\nthey were sure to pass) for swamping the votes of the enemy. With this\r\nonce done, to suit their book, any dissolution of Parliament must\r\nredound to their sole benefit. But this pretty plot was not played out,\r\naccording to arrangement; for the Irish members stopped it.\r\n\r\nThese, although they had their own bear-garden now in College Green,\r\nfound treason there too orthodox to afford any pure enjoyment, and made\r\na point of coming over to keep their pepper-boxes hot; which, according\r\nto the Kill-England Compact, were to be at their service for ever. And\r\nstill sticking together--like bots in a horse, though without any humour\r\napparent--they made everything go, or not go, according to their own\r\nappetite.\r\n\r\nTheir appetite now was all wide-mouth, for the third part of our fleet,\r\nprotocolled to them; and with national ardour, and stupidity, they\r\nroared for the passing of that Bill at once; and the Government, of\r\ncourse, gave way to them. Stupidity I say, because if they had waited\r\nfor the Dust-pan Bill, they would have had our fleet entire.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, I begin to have some little hope now;\" Sir Roland said to\r\nus, as soon as we had finished an excellent dinner, as his guests, at\r\nthe _Cockles_ Club--for so everybody calls the \"Horatius Cocles\" at\r\nWestminster Bridge. There were twenty of us there, all M.P.'s; and not\r\none would have feared to take a header off the bridge, having Mr.\r\nPanclast under his arm. \"To-morrow the fight begins; and the enemy\r\n(through his own currish nature) affords us one more chance. If he had\r\ntaken up the dust-pan first, with the regiment behind him that sucks his\r\nbuttons, he must have swept everything before him. But in dread of\r\nO'Woundy, and Digger, he takes up the craze every Briton cries shame at,\r\nbefore he has thoroughly gagged them. I need not remind you, that public\r\nopinion, as it used to be called, is against this Bill, more than all\r\nthe others put together. But public opinion is a dead letter now; since\r\nthe Press tried to pass their own for it. And even if it had the Press\r\nto back it, the Hecatons would light their pipes with it. To me it\r\nappears that our last chance lies in the ghost, long expatriated, of\r\npatriotism; if only it might for one half-hour revisit the glimpses of\r\nthis English moon. But what says our excellent and powerful ally, the\r\nnewly elected of Silverside?\"\r\n\r\nBill, though he had only got his seat three days, had already made two\r\nspeeches; and being always full of argument, he was glad to make\r\nanother. But, as he made another, containing the very same observations\r\nin the House, next day, I need not report what he said just now. Not\r\nthat I would blame any man, for saying the same things twice, or twenty\r\ntimes. No man can put a new head to his hammer, every time he thumps a\r\nblock of coal; and we Britons used to be a fine block of Wallsend, hard\r\nto splinter, and impossible to crack, without fifty good thumps in the\r\nhole of each other. The Government knew this, and made their fire of the\r\nrubble.\r\n\r\nOur case, though the best that could possibly be found, seemed likely to\r\nbe a bad one. Mr. Thong, who knew exactly how every vote would go,\r\nreported that the best we could hope for was a minority of fifty. Every\r\nIrishman, of course, would vote for the glory of Ireland, and the\r\ndisgrace of Great Britain. Except some half-dozen, who had been in our\r\nArmy, or Navy, and still had some regard for the old flag. So that our\r\nhearts were very gloomy, when the great debate began.\r\n\r\nThe Government introduced their Bill, with the old clap-traps about\r\n\"universal peace, goodwill everywhere, fraternity of nations, symmetry,\r\nharmony, beneficence of commerce, expansion of the intellect, and so on.\r\nTo all these noble things now there remained one wretched little\r\nobstacle, which it was our duty and our privilege to remove at once, the\r\nleprous stain of blood-guiltiness, and greed\"--in the mill of their\r\neloquence they ground up metaphors--\"and that obstacle was the ambition\r\nof England. If once we proffered, to the world at large, this\r\nmagnificent pledge of our candour, confidence, and chivalrous resolve\r\nnot to raise our hands against those who might indeed appear desirous to\r\ntrample on our bodies, but would abstain, when they found them so\r\ndefenceless,--then, and not till then, should we be able to claim the\r\nproud title of promoters of the glorious cause of humanity.\" There was a\r\ngreat deal more, even finer than this; but is it not written in the\r\nchronicles of Hansard?\r\n\r\nThe Liberal benches were rent with explosions of applause, like an\r\nancient fig tree; while on our side presently, an honourable Member\r\ngained earnest attention, by imitating to a nicety the clucking of a\r\nhen, that calls her chicks together.\r\n\r\nBeing new to the manners of the House, and zealous upon all points of\r\norder, up I jumped, and began to run about, trying to catch with my hat\r\nthe Dame Partlet, so intrusive in high places. Roars of laughter were my\r\nreward, the greatest of great guns joining in; and even the omnipotent\r\npremier gave me a smile of extraordinary sweetness. I had earned the\r\ngood-will of the House for ever; and until I am grey, I shall be called\r\n\"Green Tommy.\"\r\n\r\nNow, this may seem a very small, and childish affair, at a time most\r\ntruly momentous; and some will accuse me of my accustomed triviality in\r\nrecounting it. But without fear of contradiction from any then present,\r\nand able to form opinion, whether Liberal or Conservative, I say that\r\nthe cluck of an imaginary hen changed the fortunes of Great Britain, for\r\nat least ten years; though her foes will prevail in the end, no doubt.\r\nThat is to say, unless there is, from time to time--as there ought to\r\nbe, according to analogy--an outbreak of savage fury, havoc, mad\r\nbestiality, and wallowing murder, in that centre, heart, soul, brain,\r\nQueen, star, crown, sun, and Deity of the universe, which Mr. Windsor\r\ncalls \"Parree.\" Insanity there makes London sane; as a man I know well,\r\nwho cut down his best friend--too late, alas! for any but the\r\nCoroner--has been afraid ever since to go near a belfry.\r\n\r\nBut the turn, by which that cluck saved our _Capitol_, had nothing to do\r\nwith either vigilance, or terror, but simply led up to a condition of\r\ngood humour. Good humour, which is sure to come after a laugh, and a\r\nboyish laugh especially, brings back to the mind of a man, for a moment,\r\nthat he is not the only man in the world. He may not be able to believe\r\nit very long, and is quite certain not to remember it; still, even to\r\nfancy that there are some others, improves his behaviour, a good bit.\r\n\r\nThe Government saw, that the vein of the moment was not at all in their\r\nfavour; and two of the Cabinet went to crave leave of the Irish Members,\r\nto put off the division. Sir Roland told me, that he hoped they would\r\nget it; while I, knowing nothing of tactics, hoped that the matter might\r\nbe settled out of hand, while the Members appeared so light-hearted. For\r\nsurely no Briton, unless in \"the blues,\"--which all Rads, from disease\r\nof the conscience, suffer--would vote for abandoning every stick and\r\nstone, that our fathers gave their poor brave lives for. But Roly was\r\nright, and I was wrong; as appeared most plainly afterwards. The Irish\r\ncaptain, desiring for a reason of his own, to oblige the prime-minister,\r\ngave orders that the debate might be adjourned, if the Government\r\nparticularly wished it.\r\n\r\nThis, as you will see, proved a good chance for us. But to take things\r\nin their proper order, refreshing my memory by the notes of the Member\r\nfor Silverside, who had learned shorthand, I find pretty nearly as\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nWhen the Bill was entirely before the House--in all its perfect\r\nsymmetry, according to their language, in all its naked enormity,\r\naccording to ours--the Leader of the Opposition rose, and in the most\r\ncourteous and placid manner (which alone might have proved, by its\r\ndifference from theirs, on which side sense and justice lay) moved, not\r\nthe entire rejection of the Bill--for that appeared too hopeless, in the\r\nteeth of their vast majority--but a moderate amendment, which had been\r\nconsidered (as half a loaf is better than no bread) to be the utmost an\r\nEnglishman could hope for. Inasmuch as our foreign possessions, and our\r\nfleet, were declared by the voice of the Universe, to be a standing\r\nmenace to civilization, and an outrage to all foreign sentiment, he\r\nproposed that the fortresses should be dismantled, and the fleet blown\r\nup, instead of being handed over intact, for the use of our enemies.\r\nThis enraged the Government, almost more than the direct negation would\r\nhave done. The usual outcry against half-measures arose; and to support\r\nit, arose Mr. I. Beright.\r\n\r\nThis was a very great orator, one of the greatest of all recent times;\r\nbecause he possessed, what our ancestors had, but we for the most part\r\nhave lost,--the power of putting plain meaning into plain words. A very\r\ngreat man as well, from the clearness, and solid consistence of his\r\nmind; and even yet greater he might have been, if Nature had endowed him\r\nwith the power also of saying \"I be wrong,\" sometimes. However, it was a\r\nreal treat to hear him, whatever one's opinion of his might be; because\r\nthere was no need to fish for his meaning, and be vexed with oneself,\r\nfor not catching it. Indeed, so immense was the force of his words, and\r\nhis aspect so large and commanding, that it took me a long time to set\r\nup again my own weak convictions, against his strong ones. Luckily,\r\nhowever, some little fellows followed, who, doing their utmost to deepen\r\nhis track, succeeded very nicely in obliterating it; like a lot of\r\nchildren following a giant in the snow. Several members also of the\r\nOpposition spoke, appealing to the buried bones of patriotic principle,\r\nand reading long extracts from obsolete speeches, and solemn\r\ndeclarations of the present premier; all of which were capable of being\r\nexplained away, whenever there was no denying them. And at half-past\r\ntwo, the debate was adjourned, on the motion of Lord Grando Crushbill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE, AND THE BREEZE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Europe had concluded long ago, that the Government of England had\r\nleft itself no other blunder to commit, and no further disgrace to fall\r\ninto. But all Europe was wrong in this conclusion; for before our debate\r\ncame on again, tidings of a new disaster, and one more foul scorn to\r\nBritish blood, and heart, rang through the streets of London. Those\r\nstreets were, by this time, so well used to the sound of surrenders, and\r\nmassacres, seizures by Russia of this, and of that, and French\r\nbombardment of Britons, that they took it as calmly as the passing of\r\nthe plague-cart in September, 1665. Men, full of business, shook their\r\nheads at the newsboys, (who spoil their own traffic with chalk, as\r\nEngland has done with her flourish of \"free-trade\") and the extra\r\neditions of the evening papers went back to their offices, except a few\r\ncopies, sold to visitors wise enough to live far north. In short, the\r\npublic knew it all, without paying, and kept all their halfpence, to pay\r\nfor the result.\r\n\r\nWe, who were punctual, heard it all (after prayers) announced, in a\r\ntelegraphic voice; as a thing which should go in at one ear, and out at\r\nthe other, in every head giving up its brains, (as every head, that has\r\ngot any, does) to the only one worth counting. The Liberal Members\r\nseemed thankful for the news; because we could scarcely have rescued the\r\nhero, and redeemed our faith, for twelve hundred pounds; and because it\r\nset us free, to look after some other, who would truckle more kindly,\r\nand pay his own way. But we thought it very bad--very bad indeed;\r\nthough, of course, it was treason to say so. And none of us saw any\r\nlight in it; which shows that our eyes were not open.\r\n\r\nThis piece (of a piece with the rest) of foreign news, happened to\r\narrive on a Saturday; and we (for the sake of the fifty-two reforms) had\r\na Saturday sitting already; which lasted in fact until Church-time on\r\nSunday, and must have despatched any other prime-minister to a place,\r\nwhere even he would scarcely hold all preferment. However, his influence\r\nadjourned the fourth commandment--as it used to treat the third--even in\r\nthe souls of Scotchmen.\r\n\r\nFor the few, who like to see one of our disasters discussed upon its\r\nmerits, the best chance is, when the news arrives near about noon of\r\nSaturday. It is too late then, for the evening papers to shed their\r\nmild light upon it, even if they all employed the gentleman, who settles\r\n(at a glance, and a stroke) all the monthly labour of the magazines. And\r\nas for the Sunday papers, any that were not out on Friday night\r\n(reversing the premier's chronology) have shut their frames now, and are\r\nworking off. This is as it should be, enabling a sound Briton to go to\r\nchurch, without praying for the Commination Service.\r\n\r\nThen upon Monday morning, like a string of horses who have observed the\r\nsabbath, with a loud neigh and caper, rush forth the morning papers.\r\nThey swallow up the earth, like the horse of Job, trample under foot a\r\nfew writers of fiction--as though they had none on their own\r\nbacks--scatter the thunder of their neck (or cheek) upon every man they\r\nhave no fear of, and with one or two quiet exceptions, go down upon\r\ntheir knees, for the jockey of the period to mount them, if he deigns.\r\n\r\nBut on this Monday morning, they came out mildly, (the most rampant nag\r\nknows where his oats are kept) sniffing the air for the direction of the\r\nbreeze; and going gingerly, as if some English flint remained. And they\r\nfound very speedily, and so did we, that the great steam roller had not\r\ncrushed out every power of spark from our ancient metal.\r\n\r\n\"The tone of the Press is changed, at last;\" Sir Roland Twentifold said\r\nto me, when the House was meeting for the final issue; \"too late to help\r\ntheir Country much; but in time to give waverers some excuse for\r\nwavering. There will be as full a House, as ever was known. But our\r\nseats are safe. Come, and let me introduce you to Lord Grando.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the nobleman who had lately come to the forefront of honour,\r\nand of justice; in right of plain language, clear mind, and fine pluck.\r\nWhether he were a fine Christian or not, is more than I can pretend to\r\nsay, but he observed one leading precept, infinitely better than his\r\ngreat opponent. When men reviled him, and persecuted him, and said all\r\nmanner of evil against him, he rejoiced, and was exceeding glad. And of\r\nthis joy he had ample store, to last for many generations. \"_Horrida\r\ngrando_\" was his name with the Rads; and he always came down upon them,\r\nlike a pelt of hail. Yet he carried no frost in his tail; for his manner\r\nwas vigorous, warm, and stimulating.\r\n\r\n\"I am to begin, as you know;\" he said, with a gay smile, to Sir Roland,\r\nin whom he had found a fearless spirit, equal even to his own. \"I have\r\ngreat hopes. What say you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He has the true old English spirit, he never knows when he is beaten;\"\r\nRoly said to me, as we went to our seats, for a crush of Members came\r\npouring in. \"And I will tell you another thing, Tommy,--he will not be\r\nbeaten always. If we can only dish that Dust-pan Bill, (or even if we\r\nhave it) I will back him for First Lord of the Treasury. All he wants is\r\nmellowing, and time will bring it.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the resumption of the great debate, a few little questions were\r\nasked, concerning the very sad news of Saturday. The Leader of the\r\nGovernment replied, that \"there had scarcely been time as yet, to verify\r\nthe last official despatches. However, there appeared to be some grounds\r\nto apprehend, that another unforeseen, and inevitable disaster, in some\r\nmeasure, had befallen the British arms. A limited number of British\r\nofficers appeared, to some extent, to have lost their lives, in the\r\nexecution of their duty. This, however, was beyond prevision. They might\r\nhave incurred some risk, and indeed the result appeared to confirm that\r\nview. But Her Majesty's Government had incurred no responsibility\r\nwhatever, having simply accepted parenthetical functions\r\nunder--certainly not the Man-in-the-Moon, as an honourable Member\r\nsuggested, with a levity incomprehensible, and most reprehensible--but\r\nunder the legitimate and legitimately constituted authorities of--well,\r\nof the locality.\"\r\n\r\nBeing asked, if the dead men were our flesh and blood, he replied, that\r\n\"to such an interrogation, highly impolitic in the present condition of\r\ndifficult and delicate negotiations, seven different forms of reply,\r\nvery naturally, and conclusively presented themselves. But without\r\nfurther advices, and instructions, and the necessary period for their\r\nconsideration, it became his duty to deprecate further expenditure of\r\npublic time.\"\r\n\r\nBeing asked, whether these men had not been sent, with the strongest\r\npledges any words could give, to back them up with a British force, and\r\nunder most solemn assurance, that every act of theirs would be the\r\ndirect act of the Government of England; he replied, that \"no less than\r\nfourteen, entirely distinct and apparently materially repugnant, yet\r\neasily reconcilable constructions, might be placed upon their sealed\r\ninstructions. Each of these interpretations had its own undeniable\r\nmerits, and claim to unbiassed, and leisurely discussion. And, for that\r\npurpose, each of them, as simply as possible, and yet essentially,\r\npresented itself, with a convenient quadrifurcation. As soon as\r\nnegotiations were concluded--by which he did not mean, 'as soon as all\r\nour men were killed;' though the honourable Member was welcome to his\r\ncroak--he would gladly undertake to appoint a day, for the discussion of\r\nthose fifty-six issues. Meanwhile, he refused to be\r\nbadgered.\"--Wherewith down he sat; as no other man can.\r\n\r\nHis candour, good temper, and unusual lucidity were rewarded with an\r\noutburst of natural applause; while the Member for ----, whose brother\r\nhad been killed, arose as if to speak; but could not do it.\r\n\r\nBut not quite so easily did the great man get off. Without condescending\r\nto consult mephitic oracles, Lord Grando Crushbill arose, and spoke well\r\nupon the main question before us. He met the vile Bill, with no weak\r\namendment, no confession and avoidance, but the downright \"damn,\" which\r\nevery foreigner knows well, to be the word whereby we live. No precedent\r\ncould be discovered, for this brief form of suggesting rejection, and\r\nthe Speaker pronounced that it was not in accordance with strict\r\nParliamentary usage, for the noble Member to move--\"Damn the Bill;\" or\r\nat least for the motion to be entered.\r\n\r\nThat speech of Lord Grando--a genuine Philippic--is well known to every\r\ntrue Briton; and as no other man will ever read this book, unless it be\r\na stout American, it is needless for me to cite it here. But while he\r\nwent on, there was gnashing of teeth, and signs of pale liver disease\r\namong the folk, who have learned from Egypt nothing but Egyptian\r\ncourage, and from Africa in general, the Ostrich-trick. After that, it\r\nsounded very mild to move, that the Bill be read this day six months!\r\n\r\nTo second this motion, Chumps arose; as had been arranged beforehand.\r\nAnd Bill spoke uncommonly well, so far as I am a judge of such matters.\r\nHe went at it, as if he was splitting down a sheep, for a good customer\r\ncome for kidneys--his father was the first man in London, I believe, who\r\nput kidneys up to twopence halfpenny, and fourpence is the price in that\r\nsame shop now, and my mother stopped her ears when they asked her such a\r\nfigure, and did the same thing when she told me of it--however, there\r\nwas no mistake about Bill's meaning. He had not left Oxford long enough\r\nas yet, to forget all the very plain directions of Aristotle, Cicero,\r\nand Horace; and whatever was in him, he showed us very honestly, with\r\nmeat-saw, and chopper, and no hems of flank tucked under. If any\r\nobjection could be made, it was this--that he followed his father in the\r\nway of good weight, perhaps a little more substance than we wanted for\r\nour money; as a marrow-bone swindles us, by being solid.\r\n\r\nThings happen oddly in this odd world; and a few years ago, could\r\nanybody have imagined that the brush of Joe Cowl, the chimney-sweep,\r\nwould ever come out at the top of the pot of the English Constitution?\r\nAnd not only so, but that you would find it there, brandished against,\r\nand quite covering with smuts the new bright steel cleaver from the shop\r\nof Mr. Chumps! Time works wonders; and perhaps you will exclaim, that\r\nthe greatest wonder of all was the fact, that the son of \"Bubbly Upmore\"\r\nthe boiler--however, let that stop till we come to it.\r\n\r\nJoe had a very large command of words, irregular perhaps, and\r\nundisciplined, and more than once, we had to call out, \"Order!\" At\r\nfirst, from professional habit, he stopped, and pulled out his book, as\r\nif to enter \"Kitchen-chimney, at five o'clock;\" which made Bill, and me,\r\nwho understood this motion, look at one another, and laugh heartily.\r\nMoreover, he had a large command of voice; as behoved a man who had\r\nbeaten all the rest on his walk, with the shrill cry of, \"Se-veep!\" I\r\nwhispered to the honourable Member on our side, who had done the hen so\r\nbeautifully; and he (being gifted with ventriloquism) in the middle of\r\none of Joe's grandest passages, upset the whole effect, by producing the\r\nloud call of the trade, in its longest melancholy--\"Se-veep!\" so that\r\nJoe jumped round, and stared; as if a rival bag, and brush were after\r\nhim. This was not fair play perhaps; but Cowle deserved it; for the\r\nwhole of his eloquence was nothing but abuse. He blackened all the\r\npeople, on whose shillings he had lived, and besmutted everybody with a\r\nslate above his head. In short, there was no man, or woman, in\r\nexistence, with any right to be so, except Joseph Cowle.\r\n\r\nWe wanted Sir Roland to deliver his speech next; but he said, perhaps\r\ntoo loudly, \"I never follow sweeps;\" and presently the House was\r\nlistening to a gentleman, who is always heard with pleasure for his\r\nbrave manly sentiments, impartiality, and scorn of all pretences. He\r\ndemolished the Bill, in most admirable style, putting all the arguments\r\nagainst it, better than our side had put them; and then to my surprise\r\ndeclared, that in spite of all that, he had made up his mind to vote for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis brought up Sir Roland, and his speech was very fine. Strong\r\nindignation made strong words; as the wrath of the billow creates its\r\nroar. \"For finicking argument what care I? Can a man split straws with a\r\ndagger at his throat? Eternal shame falls upon our land, that any man in\r\nit should have dreamed of such an act. The man who proposed such an\r\noutrage, must have done it, as a lesson towards the stabbing of his own\r\nmother.\" For this he was loudly called to \"order;\" but disdained the\r\ncall, and went on reckless. \"Where can I find words strong enough? The\r\ndifficulty is, not to fashion, but to find them. Language has never been\r\nmade for such cases; for what tongue could have told, that such a case\r\nwould ever be? Yet, perhaps, it was as well, that there should be this\r\ndefect; for what language could move lunatics?\" Here there was a great\r\nrow; but Sir Roland's voice was strong. \"The word I have used may not be\r\nof high courtesy; but it is of deepest charity. I can look across this\r\nHouse, with my hands hanging down, solely upon that supposition. Her\r\nMajesty's Ministers love to leave us in the dark. They keep us so\r\nstill--whether common sense demands their consignment to\r\nstrait-waistcoat, or to the gallows.\"\r\n\r\nSeldom perhaps has any \"limited number of human beings\" made a greater\r\nrow--except in some Liberal massacre--than was now to be had, in all\r\nsizes and samples, among men whose names are watchwords. I saw--though\r\nhe tried to do it quite behind his hat--a Right Honourable Member, whose\r\nname is fame, make a trumpet of his hand, and blow out the most hideous\r\nscreech that ever quelled a \"railway-hooter;\" and I could not have\r\nbelieved my eyes, unless my ears had been at the back of them. In a\r\nword, there was no word, neither any sense among us, head being gone\r\nuniversally, and body left working about, like a worm cut in two.\r\n\r\nIn the thick of this turmoil, Lord Grando came up, and shook hands with\r\nRoly; who was now as quiet, as the stump of the match, that has blown up\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\n\"Something like a maiden speech that was,\" he said; \"but the guillotine\r\nmaiden, I'm afraid my dear fellow. And we shall operate first upon our\r\nown heads. However, better that than slow poisoning.\"\r\n\r\nAt first, I did not understand what he meant; but seeing that Roly did,\r\nI asked him to explain. He seemed to find me wonderfully stupid--as I\r\nam, especially when at all excited, and by this time I was all\r\nexcitement--but he managed to explain that he had done more harm, than\r\ngood by his strong short eloquence. He had moved many hearts, which had\r\nbeen covered up (for reasons of Inland Revenue, like a vehicle unused),\r\nbut he had not done it in the way to bring them out, comfortably, and\r\nwith himself inside them. To do that properly, there must be no\r\nappearance of call, or demand, or anything at all unpleasant--such as\r\nrebukes of conscience are--but a gentle opening of a quiet door at\r\nfirst; as if one came by accident, to find something that belonged to\r\none. But who can blame Roly, for not understanding that? He had stirred\r\nup right feeling, all the wrong way of the grain; and it was not at all\r\nthankful, for being stirred up.\r\n\r\nAfter many more speeches, some right and some wrong, and--which seemed\r\nto be first thought of--some good, and some bad; the Prime-Minister\r\nrose, to wind up the debate, at about ten minutes past midnight. The\r\nHouse was as silent as a hive of smoked bees, with just one fellow, here\r\nand there, not quite dead. I prepared myself for the finest treat of\r\nears, and mind, and perhaps of heart also--though he seldom troubles\r\nthat--and I said to myself, \"No prejudice, if you please!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it was useless to say that. When a man, coming out of his front\r\ndoor, sees another man hacking down his pet tree, is the sense of high\r\nart supreme with him? Does he stop to admire the attitude, the muscles,\r\nthe skilful swing, the bright implement? Nay, rather, in a fine rage,\r\nout he rushes, and shouts, \"What do you mean by this, sir?\"\r\n\r\nBut making allowance for all my \"paltry wrath\"--as his sycophants call\r\nit--I found it impossible to catch the great man's meaning, as it should\r\nbe caught. That is to say, well over the heart, thrown straight at it,\r\nas a good fielder throws up, and not over one's head, or between one's\r\nlegs, or twisting in and out, like a left-handed bowler's ball. But for\r\nall that, I felt that his voice was grand, and his power enormous; if he\r\nwould have used it simply, and after the manner of his favourite author.\r\nThe fault perhaps lies in the multiplicity of his mind, which does not\r\nconsider the simplicity of ours.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, he never had a worse cause to plead; and in the bottom of his\r\nheart--which is sound, I do believe--he must have known that, far better\r\nthan our shallow natures knew it. When at last; he broke out of the\r\ndense haze of argument into the pure sky of eloquence, almost he\r\npersuaded me not be an Englishman, but for the thought that he himself\r\nwas one.\r\n\r\n\"All up now, Tommy!\" Sir Roland said to me, as the last tones of that\r\nsilvery voice, like music for the dead, hung hovering; \"after that, it\r\nis all up with England.\"\r\n\r\nBut I answered--\"Hold my belt, a minute. I will try it, whatever comes\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\nFor the last two hours, and indeed for the whole of the evening, I had\r\nfelt throughout my system, that it was in a very extraordinary state.\r\nThumping of the heart, and great expansion of the chest, tingling of\r\narms and legs, and great inhalings of hot light air, had confused me;\r\nand whenever a draught from the ventilators (which are like a blow of\r\nsteam) came under me, I seemed to feel my dress (which I had chosen for\r\nits lightness), fill, like the feathers of a bird at rising. Sometimes\r\nindignation, sometimes pleasure, sometimes lofty ambition to be useful\r\nto my Country, and to Laura's, had been hoisting at me, like a balanced\r\nlever. \"Don't be afraid,\" I said, \"I can't stop down, any longer. But\r\ntry to get me a hearing.\"\r\n\r\nTo the sudden astonishment of the crowded House, (which could scarcely\r\nbelieve its own eyes at first) I, Tommy Upmore, went up gently, and\r\nsteadily, as a ring of blue smoke rises, from a cigar, where no draught\r\nis. Honourable Members were leaving their seats, for the critical\r\nDivision, which should split up England; but with one accord, they all\r\nturned round and stared. Remembering what Professor Brachipod had told\r\nme, I used my hands and feet so well, with my curls spread out to catch\r\nthe air, that I steered my course, as accurately as I ever steered a\r\nboat to bump another. Beneath me, there seemed to be breathless\r\namazement; but I found myself perfectly calm, and smiled.\r\n\r\nAvoiding all peril of fire, I hovered, with buoyant delight in every\r\nfibre, and a tingle of disdain at the terror of the House--for the\r\ngreatest men looked quite small down there--till I came to a large beam\r\nof the roof; heart of British oak it was; and against it I brought up,\r\nwith a perfectly erect, and perhaps dignified presentment.\r\n\r\nIn this position, I caught the Speaker's eye, and removing my hat, which\r\nI placed upon the beam, made my bow to him, and sought permission to\r\naddress the House. The debate being closed, and the division-bell\r\nringing, I could hardly expect to be allowed to speak. But the case was\r\nexceptional; and more than that, everybody longed to hear what I had got\r\nto say. The Right Honourable, the Speaker, raised his wig, to be certain\r\nthat his head was right, under it; and with no further symptom of\r\nsurprise--for he had seen a great many stranger sights than this--said\r\nslowly,\r\n\r\n\"I find no precedent, for a speech from the roof, by any Honourable\r\nMember. But I am willing to be guided by the sense of the House, in a\r\ncase so unprecedented.\"\r\n\r\nThen the silence, which was now becoming painful to me, by reason of my\r\nloneliness up there, was broken with loud cries of, \"Speak up,\r\nLarkmount!\" from Members who did not know my name,--\"Speak up, Tommy!\"\r\nfrom the gentlemen who did; and \"Speak down, Tommy!\" from my private\r\nfriends, who were beginning to understand all about it.\r\n\r\n\"The Honourable Member for Larkmount has possession of the House,\" said\r\nMr. Speaker.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" I replied, in a very clear voice, at the same time unbuttoning my\r\ncoat, which was made like the one I had flown with at Happystowe; \"I\r\nwill not presume upon your indulgence, nor trespass on the kindness of\r\nthe House below me, except with a very brief quotation, well known to\r\nall British Members, whom I would ask to join me in reciting it.\"\r\n\r\nI had now drawn forth a little Union Jack, made for me by my darling;\r\nand flinging it open from its hollow silver staff, waved it in the\r\nstrong light, around my head, keeping time with the noble lines I sang,\r\nin a voice that made the heart of oak resound, and the hearts and lungs\r\nof men rebound--\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"The flaunting flag of liberty,\r\n       Of Gallia's sons the boast,\r\n     Oh never may a Briton see,\r\n       Upon the British coast!\r\n\r\n     \"The only flag that freedom rears,\r\n       Her emblem on the seas,\r\n     Is the flag that braves a thousand years,\r\n       The battle, and the breeze.\r\n\r\n     \"But fast would flow the nation's tears,\r\n       If traitor hands should seize\r\n     The flag that braves a thousand years,\r\n       The battle, and the breeze.\r\n\r\n     \"And shall we yield to dastard fears\r\n       Our empire of the seas--\r\n     The flag that braves a thousand years,\r\n       The battle, and the breeze?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery face was turned towards me, and every throat joined in with mine,\r\nand every arm was waved (even of the Irish Members) to keep time with my\r\nwaving of the glorious flag. And perhaps there has never been a vaster\r\nroar, even in the British House of Commons, than when I came down, with\r\nmy flag flying bravely, bowed deeply to the Speaker, for his good grace,\r\nand took Sir Roland's arm, to go with him to the lobby; for my head was\r\ngiddy, with excitement, and timidity.\r\n\r\n\"Keep up your pluck, Tommy,\" whispered Sir Roland; \"you have done it\r\nthis time, I believe, my boy. By Jove, how splendidly you sang! You have\r\nsaved the Country, and won Laura.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE ENGLISH LION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople, who care for nothing, are capable of saying almost anything; but\r\neven of these, there are not many, who would call the British House of\r\nCommons, a sentimental body. But anybody, being at all a body, must now\r\nand then feel its flesh rebel at the ghostly proceedings of its\r\nCock-loft tenant. Pure reason (like the doctrine of free trade) is a\r\nvery fine existence, if it would only work. But, alas! like the other,\r\nit finds practical issue mainly in keeping people out of work.\r\n\r\nThe deep love of our birth, which arises with our life, rose anew in the\r\nheart of every Englishman, and forced him to scorn petty faction, and\r\nvote, as his father and mother would have made him. The infamous and\r\ntraitorous plot (which would have ended, in the ancient days, at Tower\r\nHill) ended in a very hot majority of more than fifty, against the\r\nGovernment. As a last faint hope, they appealed to the Country, which\r\nhad long borne patiently its sickness of them.\r\n\r\nPending my second return for Larkmount, (which took to itself all the\r\nglory of my deed, and pelted every Radical, who dared to show his nose,\r\nnear the bottom of the hill it stood upon) I ventured to pay a little\r\nvisit to the Towers; though perhaps I should have waited, till the issue\r\nwas secure. But I make bold to say, from my own experience, that no one,\r\nwho has been through all the ins and outs of love, as I have been\r\nobliged to do, can stop without hurrying to the end of them, whether\r\ngood or bad. And in the sad humility, which true love feels, I was even\r\nscared by fancies, that my darling might dislike the unusual course I\r\nhad adopted, for her sake. It was pretty sure to cause some curiosity\r\nabout her, and perhaps even nasty scientific questions, such as seem to\r\nhave no reverence for the sanctity of home. Few names were more\r\nconspicuous than mine, just now, as perhaps was only natural; and I\r\ncould not resent it. In a very short time, that would be wiped out; for\r\nfame is no better than a schoolboy's slate; and the surest way to\r\nexpunge it, is to try to write it deeper. My little notoriety soon\r\nbecame a nuisance to me; all I cared for was, that those I loved should\r\nlove me for my own sake; and any public reputation seems to interfere\r\nwith that.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have never felt more humble in my life, than when I sat by\r\nLaura's side, one lovely April day, beneath the famous Oak-tree, which\r\nher mother was fond of sketching. The only leaves upon the tree were a\r\nfew that had stood the winter; and the young buds were not ready yet, to\r\npush their faded history by.\r\n\r\nI had always been handy with my knife, from the time I cut bread and\r\nbacon with it; and now I carved upon the bench \"T. U.,\" while she looked\r\non, and encouraged me.\r\n\r\nThen I said, \"Let me put something much better now. Over it I shall cut\r\n'L. T. T.' And when you come here, after I am gone, you will be\r\ncompelled to think of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How strange you are, Tommy!\" she said, as I sharpened my knife on my\r\nboot, for my feet are as fine as a lady's. \"Any one who did not know you\r\nwell, would think that your fame had been too much for you. You are not\r\nhalf so simple, as you used to be. I suppose, you expect to be Prime\r\nMinister, when the Conservatives come in.\"\r\n\r\nI took no notice of this, because I wanted her to go on with it. So I\r\ncarved a very excellent \"L. T.,\" while she kept on looking at the cows\r\nand sheep.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" she cried, pulling out her watch from a place, which was a\r\nvery great favourite with my arm; \"I had no idea it was so late. I must\r\nleave you to finish your sculpture, I am afraid. Good-bye, Tommy, for a\r\nlong time now.\"\r\n\r\n\"What must be, must;\" I replied with great firmness. And then up I\r\njumped, with my knife in my hand, because she was making off so fast.\r\n\"Don't be in such a dreadful hurry, Laura. Why, you are crying, dear!\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I indeed? And even if I were, it need not disturb the condition of\r\nyour mind. All you care about now is politics, like Roly. How I do\r\ndespise all politics!\"\r\n\r\n\"And so do I; except for one little thing;\" I answered, \"and you know\r\nwell what that little thing is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a very little thing indeed,\" she replied, taking good care not to\r\nlook at me; \"the smallest thing in all the world, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do try to have some particle of reason;\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I am all pure reason itself,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"You are all pure beauty, and warm heart;\" I answered; \"and what is the\r\ngood of saying, that you don't care about me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I say that? I don't believe I ever did. I was only trying to think\r\nit, when you behaved so badly. But if I said that, it was a great story,\r\nTommy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know what the penalty for a story is;\" I answered. And her eyes\r\nshone with sunny tears, while she paid it.\r\n\r\n\"Darling sweet,\" I said, for I never touched her, without being carried\r\nquite beyond myself; \"all I was waiting for, was to know, what last\r\nletter I might put here. I want to put a 'U;' I so long to put a 'U;'\r\nthe one you in the world that just suits me to a T. 'Laura Towers\r\nUpmore.' I won't do it, without your full permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear,\" she replied, after some consideration; \"Roly has given his\r\nfull consent now; and my dear mother loves you, like her own son. And\r\nI--well, never mind about me; I am nobody. Only I feel, that your time\r\nshould not be wasted, with all the great things that you will have to\r\ndo, after saving the Country, to begin with. So perhaps it would be\r\nwiser, dear, to put me down with 'U.'\"\r\n\r\nNow what do you suppose that I did next? Embraced her, kissed her, shed\r\ntears with her? As young people do, when they agree to get married, to\r\npractise for the time to come. Nay, such things are not to be talked\r\nabout; or why were trees made, and benches, and moss (the very essence,\r\nand symbol of silence, all the year), and houses far off, to show what\r\nis to come, yet not blink a window beyond their own doors?\r\n\r\nThe real thing that I did--which will stir every female heart, tenfold\r\nmore than chastest salutations--was done with a thumb and finger pushed,\r\non each side simultaneously, to the bottom of my double-breasted\r\nwaistcoat pockets.\r\n\r\n\"Look at these, Laura, while I put our names into a true lover's knot;\"\r\nI said, just as if it was a pair of blue kidney-beans I was showing.\r\n\"They are come to be eclipsed, my darling, by the brilliance of your\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they are amethysts! But I never saw such amethysts. They seem to\r\nhave such a lot of light inside them!\"\r\n\r\n\"So they have, Laura. But what a cold light, darling, compared with what\r\ncomes from your heart into mine!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that cannot be denied; except that the present\r\ncondition of things is a great deal better than the past. The humbug of\r\n\"free trade\" is dead at last. The blessing of \"Paternal Government\"\r\n(delivered over the wrong dish of broth) is gone back, like a curse, to\r\nroost at home. An Englishman now may eat his breakfast, without gulping\r\ndown more lies than tea; and may smile at his children, without a\r\nsmothered sigh, at prolonging a race of dastards. In a word, we have\r\nonce more a Government, that knows its own mind, and has a mind to know.\r\nWhether it be Radical, or Tory, matters little to the average\r\nEnglishman; so long as it acts with courage, candour, common sense, and\r\nconsistency. But if its policy be anarchy, quibbling, robbery,\r\ncowardice, and treason--then we cast it out (like a leper, and a\r\nleopard, mingling sores, and spots, and crawl) and, to save our home,\r\nrecall that true supporter of our shield and sword, noble once, and not\r\nyet ignoble, the sturdy old lion of England.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON: PRINTED BY WILLIAM CLOWES AND SONS, LIMITED,\r\nSTAMFORD STREET AND CHARING CROSS.",
