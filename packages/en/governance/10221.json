THERE IS NOTHING TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE DAY BEFORE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of February, the extra day, dead still, and biting\r\ncold, with thick, lead-colored skies shading down to inky blue at the\r\nwestern horizon. In the ravine below John Watson's house trees cracked\r\nominously in the frost, and not even a rabbit was stirring. The hens\r\nhad not come out, though an open door had extended an invitation, and\r\nthe tamworths had burrowed deeper into the stack of oat straw. The\r\ncattle had taken refuge in the big shed, and even old Nap, in spite of\r\nhis thick Coat, had whimpered at the door to be let in.\r\n\r\nLooking out of the western window, Pearl Watson, with a faint wrinkle\r\nbetween her eyebrows, admitted to herself that it was not a cheerful\r\nday. And Pearl had her own reasons for wanting fine weather, for\r\ntomorrow was the first of March, and the day to which she had been\r\nlooking forward for three years to make a momentous decision.\r\n\r\nThe thought of this day had gone with her in the three years that had\r\npassed, like a radiant gleam, a glorious presence that brightened and\r\nidealized every experience of life, a rainbow that glorified every\r\nblack cloud, and there had been some clouds in her life black enough\r\nto bring out the rainbows' colors too; as when her mother's serious\r\nillness had called her back from the city, where she was attending\r\nschool. But each day had brought her one day nearer the great day,\r\nwhich now she could call \"Tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nIt had never occurred to Pearl to doubt the young doctor's sincerity,\r\nwhen, three years before, he had said he would wait until she was\r\neighteen years old before he asked her something.\r\n\r\n\"And it will depend on your answer,\" he had said, \"what sort of a day\r\nit is. It may be a dark, cold, horrible day, with cruel, biting wind,\r\nor it may be a glorious day, all sunshine and blue sky--that will all\r\ndepend on your answer.\" And she had told him, honestly and truthfully,\r\nnot being skilled in the art of coquetry, that \"it generally was fine\r\non the first of March.\"\r\n\r\nThat the young doctor might have forgotten all about the incident\r\nnever crossed her mind in the years that followed. She did not know\r\nthat there was witchery in her brown eyes and her radiant young beauty\r\nthat would stir any young man's heart and loosen his tongue, causing\r\nhim to say what in his sober moments he would regard as foolishness.\r\n\r\nPearl did not know this; she only knew that a great radiance had come\r\nto her that day, three years before, a radiance whose glory had not\r\ndimmed. Every thought and action of her life had been influenced by\r\nit, and she had developed like a fine young tree on which the spring\r\nsunshine had perpetually fallen, a fine young tree that had been\r\nsheltered from every cold blast, watered by the rains and bathed in\r\nperpetual sunshine, for Pearl's young heart was fed from the hidden\r\nsprings of love and romance. For her the darkest night was lighted by\r\nstars; for her the birds sang of love and hope and happiness; for her\r\nthe commonest flower was rich in beauty and perfume; and so the end of\r\nthe three years found her a well developed, tall, boyishly athletic\r\ngirl, with a color in her cheeks like an Okanagon peach, hair of\r\nrichest brown, with little gleams of gold, waving back naturally from\r\na high forehead; a firm chin, with a dimple; and great brown eyes,\r\nfull of lights, and with a dazzling brilliance that registered every\r\nthought of her brain and emotion of her heart.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when she was twelve years old the young doctor, who had\r\nthen just come to Millford, had been her hero--worshipped afar, and in\r\ngreat secrecy.\r\n\r\nMany a time when the family lived in the village, and Pearl was left\r\nto mind the swarm of boys while her mother was out working, she had\r\nraced to the window just to see him drive by, and, having seen him and\r\nperhaps caught a smile or nod, if he noticed her, she would go back to\r\nher strenuous task of keeping her young brothers clothed and happy and\r\nout of the wealth of a quickened imagination she would tell them more\r\nand more wonderful tales of the glorious world into which their young\r\nfeet had strayed.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor had time and inclination to talk to her, Pearl's\r\nyoung heart swam in a crimson sea of delight, but if by any chance\r\nhe hurried by, his mind filled with other things, she suffered for\r\na brief season all the pangs of unrequited affection, and looked\r\nanxiously in the glass many times to see if her face showed signs of\r\nearly decay.\r\n\r\nBut the mood soon passed and optimism again reigned. During the times\r\nof depression many a sunflower had its yellow petals torn away, as she\r\nsought to wring from it definite information regarding the state of\r\nhis affections. If the sunflower brought in an adverse decision,\r\nwithout a moment's hesitation Pearl began upon another, and continued\r\nuntil a real, honest, authentic flower declared in her favor. But that\r\nshe did not really trust the oracles was shown by the great frequency\r\nwith which she consulted them!\r\n\r\nAs she grew older, Pearl would have liked to talk to some one about\r\nher dreams, but it was hard to begin. There was really nothing to\r\ntell. She might as well try to explain the sparkle of the sunshine, or\r\nthe joyousness of the meadowlark's song in the spring, as to try to\r\nanalyze the luminous wonder that had come into her own heart that day\r\nwhen the purple mist lay on the Tiger Hills, and the snowdrifts were\r\nbeginning to sink and sag and break into little streams. It could not\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nBut still she wondered what experiences other people had had, and\r\nwished that someone would talk to her about it. At the Normal the\r\ngirls had talked about \"crushes\" and \"mashes\" and people having a\r\n\"bad case,\" and she knew that the one qualification they demanded in\r\nmatters of the heart was that the young man should have the means\r\nand inclination to \"show a girl a good time.\" She could not talk to\r\nthem--there did not seem to be any point of contact. And when the\r\nsubject of love and marriage was discussed around the family circle,\r\nher mother's dictum was always brief and concise:\r\n\r\n\"You'll get who's for ye--and you'll have your number. There's lots of\r\ntrouble for them that don't marry, and there's lots more for them that\r\ndo. But there's no use in advisin' or warnin'; it's like the pigs and\r\nthe hot swill--one will stick in his nose and run away squalin'; the\r\nnext one will do the same, and the next and the next. They never take\r\nwarnin's; it's the way of the world!\"\r\n\r\nBut nothing dimmed the glory of Pearl's rainbow dream or stilled the\r\nhappy songs her heart sang day and night. She had often pictured the\r\nday the Doctor would come and tell her that the three years were past.\r\nHe would drive out with his team, for the snow would be too deep for\r\nhis car, and she would first hear the sleigh-bells, even before old\r\nNap would begin to bark, and he would come in with his cheeks all red\r\nand glowing, with snow on his beaver coat; and he would tell her it\r\nwas too fine to stay in, and wouldn't she come for a ride?\r\n\r\nSo sure was she that he would come that she had laid out on her bed,\r\nin the little room under the rafters, her heavy coat, overshoes and\r\nscarf, and had spent some time deciding whether her red tam or the\r\nbrown velvet hat was the most becoming, and finally favored the tam,\r\nbecause she had once heard the Doctor say that red was the color for\r\nwinter, and besides, the brown hat had a sharp rim that might give a\r\nperson a nasty poke in the eye ... in case....\r\n\r\nShe made all her preparations on the day before, because, she told\r\nherself, a doctor's time was so uncertain that he might, remembering\r\nthis, be afraid of being called away on The Day, and so come a day\r\nsooner.\r\n\r\nPearl thought of all this as she stood at the window and looked out on\r\nthe bare farm yard, swept clean of beast or fowl by the bitter cold\r\nwhich had driven them all indoors. A bright fire burned in the\r\nKlondike heater, and from the kitchen came the cheerful song of a\r\ncanary. The house was in a state of great tidiness, with its home made\r\nlounge in front of the fire, piled high with gaily flowered cushions,\r\nand the brightly striped rag carpet which was the culmination of the\r\nunited efforts of the family the winter before, and before the fire a\r\ntiger-striped cat with her paws stretched out to the heat.\r\n\r\nPearl was alone in the room, for all the children were at school, her\r\nfather and Teddy out, and her mother in the kitchen making the last of\r\nthe mincemeat into pies, which sent out a real baking odor of cinnamon\r\nand cloves; a roast of pork that had been \"doing too fast,\" was now\r\nsitting on the top of the high oven, its angry, sparking, sizzling\r\ntrailing off into a throaty guttering. Some sound or smell of it\r\nseemed to have penetrated Nap's dreams, for he wakened suddenly and\r\nsat up, licking his lips and pounding the floor with his tail.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the telephone rang, the three short and one long, which\r\nindicated that it was the Watson family who were wanted. Pearl's heart\r\nthrilled with expectation. Of course he would phone before he came to\r\nmake sure she was at home. The receiver was in her hands in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" she called, almost choking with excitement.\r\n\r\n\"Will you tell your father,\" called back a man's voice at the end\r\nof the wire, \"that the cattle are coming home from the range. Last\r\nnight's snow was too much for them, and Jim Fidler has just phoned\r\nthrough to warn us. They're comin' on mad for feed, tramplin' and\r\nbawlin', and they'll hit your place first--mos' likely--tho' they may\r\nturn south at Beckers--better phone Beckers and see.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" said Pearl, in a steady voice, \"all right, and thank\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nPearl hastily put on a coat and went to the barn to give the unwelcome\r\nnews to her father and Teddy, who were busy fanning out the weed seeds\r\nfrom the seed grain.\r\n\r\n\"They're comin' airly,\" said John Watson, slowly, as he shook down the\r\nbag of seed wheat that he had just filled; \"but I guess they are the\r\nbest judge of whether they can make a livin' outside any longer. Well,\r\nwhat we have we'll share, anyway. There's no use in contradictin' a\r\nbunch of hungry steers. Keep a watch on the phone, Pearlie dear, and\r\nfind out which way they turn at Beckers'. We'll open up an oat stack\r\nfor them, anyway--so if they come rampin' in in the middle of the\r\nnight there'll be something ready.\"\r\n\r\nPearl ran back across the wind-swept yard to the house, for the one\r\nthought in her mind was that a message might come over the phone for\r\nher! Ordinarily the home-coming of the hungry cattle would have been\r\nan event of such importance that it would have driven out all others;\r\nbut there was only one consuming thought in her mind today.\r\n\r\nWhen she came in the phone was ringing, and her mother, with her hands\r\nin the pie-crust, said: \"Pearlie, dear, run in to the phone--that's\r\ntwice it's rung since you were out, and sure I couldn't go--and me\r\nthis way.\"\r\n\r\nPearl took the receiver down and found a conversation in progress. She\r\nhad no thought of listening in--for at once she surmised it might be\r\na message regarding the cattle going to one of the other houses. The\r\nfirst sentence, however, held her in its grip, and all thought of what\r\nshe was doing was driven from her mind.\r\n\r\n\"They are going to offer the doctor the nomination tomorrow--he'll\r\nmake the best run of any one in these parts.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a man's voice, far away and indistinct.\r\n\r\n\"That will please Miss Morrison--she always wanted to get into\r\npolitics;\" it was a woman who replied--\"but I'm not so sure she has\r\nany chance, the doctor is a pretty cautious chap. I often think he has\r\na girl somewhere--he goes to Hampton pretty often.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's not worried over women, believe me,\" the man's voice cut in. \"I\r\nthink he likes that young Watson girl as well as any one, and she has\r\nthem all skinned for looks--and brains too, I guess.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman's voice came perceptibly nearer, and seemed to almost hiss\r\nin her ear--unconsciously she felt the antagonism. \"That's absurd,\"\r\nshe said, with sudden animation; \"why, these people are nobody,\r\nthe mother used to wash for me a few years ago. They are the very\r\ncommonest sort--the father was only a section man. The doctor enjoys\r\nher cute speeches, that's all, but there's absolutely nothing in\r\nit--he as much as told me so.\"\r\n\r\nPearl hung up the receiver with a click, and, pressing her lips\r\ntogether, walked over to the window with two crimson spots burning\r\nlike danger signals on her cheeks. When Pearl's soul was burdened she\r\nalways wanted to get outside, where the sky and the wind and the big\r\nblue distance would help her to think. But the day was too cold for\r\nthat, so instinctively she walked to the window, where the short\r\nafternoon sun was making a pale glow on the heavy clouds.\r\n\r\nOld Nap came from his place behind the table and shoved his cold nose\r\ninto her hand, with a gentle wagging of his tail, reminding her that\r\nall was not lost while she still had him.\r\n\r\nDropping down on her knees beside him, Pearl buried her face in his\r\nglistening white collar, and for one perilous moment was threatened\r\nwith tears. But pride, which has so often come to our rescue just in\r\ntime, stepped into her quivering young heart, she stood up and shook\r\nher head like an angry young heifer.\r\n\r\n\"'Common,' are they?\" she said, with eyes that darted fire; \"not half\r\ncommon enough--decent people that do their work and mind their own\r\nbusiness,--helpin' a friend in need and hurtin' no wan--it would be a\r\nbetter world if people like them were commoner! 'And the mother washed\r\nfor ye, did she, you dirty trollop? Well, it was a God's mercy that\r\nsome one washed for you, and it was good clane washin' she did, I'll\r\nbet--and blamed little she got for it, too, while you lay in your bed\r\nwith your dandruffy hair in a greasy boudoir cap, and had her climb\r\nthe stairs with your breakfast. And you'd fault her for washin' for\r\nyou--and cleanin' your house--you'd fault her for it! I know the kind\r\nof ye--you'd rather powder ye'r neck than wash it, any day!\"\r\n\r\nNo one would recognize the young Normalite who two weeks before had\r\ntaken the highest marks in English, and had read her essay at the\r\nclosing exercises, and afterwards had it printed, at the editor's\r\nrequest, in the _Evening Echo_, for Pearl's fierce anger had brought\r\nher back again to the language of her childhood.\r\n\r\n\"And he as much as told you, did he?\" she whispered, turning around\r\nto glare in stormy wrath at the unoffending telephone--\"he as much as\r\ntold you there was nothing in it?\"\r\n\r\nPearl puckered her lips and shut one eye in a mighty mental effort to\r\nimagine what he would say, but in trying to hear his words she could\r\nonly see his glowing face, the rumpled hair she loved so well, and\r\nthen her voice came back like a perfect phonograph record, that\r\nstrong, mellow, big voice which had always set her heart tingling and\r\ndrove away every fear. She couldn't make him say anything else but the\r\nold sweet words that had lived with her for the last three years.\r\n\r\nThe storm faded from her eyes in a moment, and in the rush of joy that\r\nbroke over her, she threw herself down beside old Nap and kissed the\r\nshiny top of his smooth black head. Then going over to the telephone,\r\nshe shook her fist at it:\r\n\r\n\"Did my mother wash for you, ma'am? She did--and you never had better\r\nwashin' done! Are we common people?--we are, and we're not ashamed.\r\nWe're doin' fine, thank you--all the children are at school but me,\r\nand I've gone thro' the public school and Normal too. The crops are\r\ngood--we have thirty head of cattle and six horses, sound in wind and\r\nlimb. Some day we'll have a fine new house, and we'll live all over it\r\ntoo. John Watson did work on the section, and they'd be fine and glad\r\nto get him back. He owes no man a dollar, and bears no man a grudge.\r\nI wouldn't change him for the Governor-General for me dad--and now\r\nlisten--I'm tellin' ye something, I'm goin' to marry the doctor--if he\r\nwants me--and if you don't like it there's a place you can go to.\r\nI'll not be namin' it in the presence of Nap here, for he's a good\r\nChristian.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, sir,\"--she addressed the telephone again,--\"I thank you for\r\nyour kind words regarding brains and looks. I hope it is a true word\r\nyou speak, for I may need both before I'm done.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe home-coming of the cows at eventime has been sung about, written\r\nabout, talked about, painted, and always it has had in it the\r\nrestfulness of evening,--the drowsy whirr of insects' wings, the\r\nbenediction of the sunset, the welcoming gladness of a happy family.\r\nBut these pictures have not been painted by those of us who have seen\r\nthe hungry cattle come in from the range when the snow covers the\r\ngrass, or the springs dry up, and under the influence of fear they\r\ndrive madly on.\r\n\r\nAll day long the range cattle, about three hundred in number had\r\nsearched the river bottom for the grass which the heavy snowfall of\r\nthe night before had covered; searched eagerly, nervously all the\r\nwhile, bawling, ill-naturedly pushing and horning, blaming each other\r\nin a perfectly human way. Disconsolately they wandered over the river\r\nto the other bank feeling sure they would find grass there, only to\r\nfind the snow over everything, and not even a little rosebush showing\r\nits head.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the old cow, an acknowledged leader of the herd,\r\nwho bore the name of the \"Broncho,\" on account of her wildness, her\r\nglaring red eyes and her branching horns, with an angry toss of her\r\nhead to shake the water from her eyes, lifted her voice in one long,\r\nangry, rolling bellow that seemed to startle the whole herd. It had\r\nin it defiance, and determination. Like the leading spirit among the\r\nleprous men who sat at the gate of Samaria, the \"Broncho\" gathered up\r\nthe feeling of the meeting in one long soul-stirring, racuous bawl,\r\nwhich, interpreted, meant, \"Why sit we here until we die?\"\r\n\r\nThe primitive law of self-preservation was at work--even a cow will\r\nnot starve quietly. The grass had been scarce for days, and she had\r\nlain down hungry each night for a week; and now, when the grass had\r\ngone entirely, the old cow had taken her determination; she would go\r\nhome and demand her right to live. This thought surging through her\r\nsoul, gave decision to her movements. Whether the other cattle came or\r\nnot did not matter in the least--she knew what she was going to do.\r\nThe strong northwest wind which began to whip the fresh snow into\r\nloose waves, turned the cattle to face the south east, in which\r\ndirection the settlement lay. Miserable cattle, like miserable people,\r\nare easily led. It is only the well-fed and comfortable who are not\r\nwilling to change their condition, and so when the others saw the\r\n\"Broncho\" forging up the hill, the whole herd, as if at a word of\r\ncommand, lurched forward up the bank.\r\n\r\nThey surged onward, bawling, crowding, trampling, hooking without\r\nmercy. Companions they had been for months before, eating together,\r\nsleeping together, warming each other, playing together sometimes when\r\nthe sun was bright. That was all forgotten now, for the hunger-rage\r\nwas on them, and they were brutes, plain brutes, with every kind\r\ninstinct dead in their shivering breasts. They knew but one law, the\r\nlaw of the strongest, as they drove onward, stumbling and crowding,\r\nwith the cold wind stinging them like a lash.\r\n\r\nThe night closed in, dark and cheerless, closed in early, under\r\nthe dull gray, unrelenting skies, and although lights blinked out\r\ncheerfully from uncurtained windows, and willow plumes of smoke spread\r\nthemselves on the cold night air above all the farm-houses, the hearts\r\nof the people were apprehensive.\r\n\r\nIt was the last day of February--green grass was still far away--and\r\nthe cattle, hungry, red-eyed and clamorous, were coming home!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE DAY!\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"When time lets slip one little perfect day,\r\n  O take it--for it may not come again.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl woke on the morning of March 1st, it was with a heart so\r\nlight and happy it brought back the many Christmas mornings that\r\nlay scattered behind her like so many crimson roses, spilling their\r\nperfume on the shining road which led back to childhood. The sunshine\r\nthat sifted through the white muslin curtains of the one small window,\r\nwas rich and warm, as if summer had already come, and Pearl suddenly\r\nremembered that the sky had been overcast and heavy the day before,\r\nand the air stinging cold.\r\n\r\nShe went to the window, and looking out saw that that the clouds had\r\nall gone, leaving no trace in the unscarred sky. The sun was throwing\r\nlong blue shadows over the fields, brightening the trees on the river\r\nbank, with a thin rinse of pale gold. Down in the ravine, the purple\r\nblue of the morning twilight was still hanging on the trees. The house\r\nwas very quiet--there did not seem to be anyone stirring, either\r\ninside or out.\r\n\r\nPearl dressed herself hastily, humming a tune in happy excitement. Her\r\nwhole being was charged with happiness--for the great day had come.\r\n\r\nComing down stairs on light feet, she threw a red sweater around her\r\nshoulders and went out the front door. In her great moments, Pearl\r\ncraved the open sky and great blue distances, and on this day of all\r\ndays, she wanted to breathe deep of its golden air. Somewhere she had\r\nread about air that tasted like old wine! And as she stood facing the\r\nearly sun that had come up in a cloudless sky of deepest blue, she\r\nknew what was meant.\r\n\r\nFrom the dull tomb of yesterday, with its cavern-like coldness\r\nand gloom, had come the resurrection of a new day, bright, blue,\r\nsparkling, cloudless, for March had slipped in quietly in the night,\r\nwith a gentle breeze of wonderful softness, a quiet breeze, but one\r\nthat knew its business, and long before daylight it had licked the\r\nhard edges of the drifts into icy blisters, and had purred its way\r\ninto all sorts of forgotten corners where the snow lay thickest.\r\n\r\nIt went past Pearl's face now with velvety smoothness--patting her\r\ncheeks with a careless hand, like a loving friend who hurries by with\r\nno time for anything but this swift re-assurance. But Pearl knew that\r\nthe wind and the sun and the crisp white snow, on which the sunbeams\r\ndanced and sparkled, were her friends, and were throbbing with joy\r\nthis morning, because it was her great day.\r\n\r\nShe went in at last, remembering that the children must be washed and\r\nfed for school, and found Danny's garter for him just in time to save\r\nhim from the gulf of despair which threatened him. She made up the two\r\ntin pails of lunch with which her young brothers would beguile the\r\nnoontide hour. She put a button on Mary's spat, in response to her\r\nrequest of \"Aw, say Pearl, you do this--I can't eat and sew.\" The\r\nsudden change in the weather forced a change in the boys' foot-gear,\r\nand so there had to be a frenzied hunt for rubbers and boots to\r\nreplace the frost-repelling but pervious moccasin.\r\n\r\nOne by one, as the boys were ready, fed, clothed and rubbered, they\r\nwere started on their two-mile journey over the sunny, snowy road,\r\nDanny being the first to so emerge, for with his short, fat legs, he\r\ncould not make the distance in as short a time as the others.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Donald wants you to come over on Friday, Pearl--I almost forgot\r\nto tell you--he wants you to talk to us about the city, and the\r\nschools you were in--and all that. I told him you would!\"\r\n\r\nThis was from Jimmy, the biggest of the Watson boys now attending\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Pearl, \"sure I will.\"\r\n\r\nThere was more to the story, though, and Jimmy went on,--\r\n\r\n\"And the Tuckers said they bet you thought yourself pretty smart since\r\nyou'd been to the city....\r\n\r\n\"And then what happened,\" asked Pearl, when he paused;\r\n\r\n\"He went home--it wouldn't stop bleedin'! but Mr. Donald says a\r\ngood nose-bleed wouldn't hurt him--though of course it was wrong to\r\nfight--but it was no fight--you know what they're like--one good\r\nthump--and they're done!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for you, Jimmy\" said his sister approvingly, \"never pick a\r\nquarrel or hit harder than you need, that's all!--but if trouble\r\ncomes--be facing the right way!\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet,\" said Jimmy, as he closed the door behind him and the\r\nstillness which comes after the children have gone fell on the Watson\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\"Sure and ain't the house quiet when they're gone,\" said Mrs. Watson,\r\nlooking out of the window across the gleaming landscape, dotted in six\r\nplaces by her generous contribution to the Chicken Hill school.\r\n\r\n\"And it won't be long until they're gone--for good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, honest woman,\" cried Pearl gaily, \"you havn't even lost\r\neither Teddy or me, and we're the eldest. It looks to me as if you\r\nwill have a noisy house for quite a while yet, and I wouldn't begin to\r\nworry over anything so far away--in fact, ma, it's a good rule not to\r\nworry till you have to, and don't do it then!\"\r\n\r\nPearl was bringing back \"the room\" to the state of tidiness it enjoyed\r\nduring school hours, moving about with joyous haste, yet with strict\r\nattention to every detail, which did not escape her mother's eye.\r\n\r\n\"It's grand to be as light of heart as you are, Pearlie child,\" she\r\nsaid, \"I'm often afraid for you--when I think of all the sad things in\r\nlife and you so sure that everything will happen right. It is to them\r\nthat the world is brightest that the darkest days can come, and the\r\nlightest heart sometimes has heaviest mournin'.\"\r\n\r\nA little wither of disappointment went over Pearl's bright face, but\r\nshe shook it off impatiently. She wished her mother would not talk\r\nlike this on this day--of all days.\r\n\r\n\"Don't spoil a good day, ma, with sad talk. Look out at the Spring sun\r\nthere, and the cattle, even the wild ones from the range, with their\r\nsides steaming and then nosing around so happy now, for getting all\r\nabout the bad times they had even as late as last evening. There's\r\nno use telling them there's cold days coming--they wouldn't believe\r\nnow--and anyway they'll know soon enough. Isn't it best to let every\r\none have their sunny day--without a cloud on it.\"\r\n\r\nBefore her mother could form an answer, the one long and two short\r\nrings came on the phone. Pearl's heart turned over in its bounding\r\njoy. It had come--she knew it had come.\r\n\r\nShe took down the receiver:\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" she said, in a thin voice.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl,\" said the voice, deep, mellow, eager. She thought she had\r\nremembered what his voice was like, but she hadn't. It was a hundred\r\ntimes sweeter than it had been in her memory.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, holding the receiver so tightly her knuckles went\r\nwhite with the pressure.\r\n\r\n\"What day is it, Pearl,\" he said, with the laugh in his voice, the\r\nbantering laugh that made his patients love him.\r\n\r\n\"O I know\" she said--\"I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't forgotten what we said?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word of it.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice came nearer, though he spoke lower.\r\n\r\n\"The train is not in yet, it is stuck out in the hills, but likely to\r\nget out any minute. Dr. Brander is on it, coming out from the city to\r\noperate for me in a very serious case, I'm not sure when I can get\r\nout--but you'll wait for me--won't you, Pearl?\"\r\n\r\nShe put her red young lips close to the transmitter.\r\n\r\n\"For a thousand years!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it won't be that long,\" he said, with his happy laugh.\r\n\r\nPearl knew exactly how his brows were lifted, and his eyes wide\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\"But it's great to have as good a margin, Pearl--and listen--\" his\r\nvoice fell again until it seemed to whisper in her ear--\"did you\r\nhappen to notice what sort of a day it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Pearl, \"I am not surprised. Didn't I tell you it would\r\nbe?\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me!\" he said.\r\n\r\nThen it was that from Pearlie Watson's young heart there opened up a\r\nshining path straight up into heaven, and every inch of that radiant\r\nhighway was bright with the gleam of angel's wings, and as she stood\r\nthere leaning against the wall, her eyes dazzled with the glory of it,\r\nit seemed as if all the sweet songs that lovers have ever sung, and\r\nall the tender words they have ever spoken came marching, gaily\r\nmarching down the shining high way, right into her heart.\r\n\r\nOutside the sun gleamed and beat on the melting snow, which sent back\r\nquivery vibrations that smote the eyeballs like fire. The cattle shook\r\nthe water from their sun-dazzled eyes, and turned their heads away\r\nfrom it, but it climbed steadily higher until it stood right over\r\nthem, and blazing down upon the snowy world, defied old man Winter to\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\nPearl was never quite sure about it in after years. But that day\r\nshe did not doubt her eyes, that star dust danced in the waves of\r\nsunshine; that the gray snow birds played crack the whip outside the\r\nwindow; that the willow hedge, palpitating in the sunshine, beat time\r\nwith its silvery branches to the music that lilted through her heart;\r\nthat the blue in the sky was bluer than it had been, and the sunshine\r\nmore golden than it ever was in the highest noon in highest June.\r\n\r\nShe was quite sure it was so, for every spot of color within doors was\r\nglorified too. The roses in the cushions on the lounge glowed like\r\na fire in the heart of a green wood; the cat's eyes gleamed like\r\nolivines, but of course Pearl knew from the way he rubbed his head\r\nagainst her shoulder as she sat on the lounge beside him, and from\r\nthe way he blinked at her--he knew, having no doubt in some occult\r\ncat-way, listened in on the phone! There was no mistaking his\r\nswaggering air of importance--he was in on it! and gave much credit to\r\nhimself for having brought it all about.\r\n\r\nThe old dog, being just a plain, honest-hearted, loving dog, only\r\nknew that Pearl was very happy over something. He did not probe the\r\ncause--if it pleased her--it was enough.\r\n\r\nAt four o'clock there came another message--which set Pearl's heart\r\ndancing, and spotted her cheeks with a glowing color--the operation\r\nwas over--apparently successful--and they were driving back to town.\r\nThe other train might be late too, so it would be impossible for him\r\nto come out--but would she still wait? Did the thousand year limit\r\nstill hold?\r\n\r\nThere was just a hint of fatigue in his voice, which awakened all the\r\nmaternal instincts in Pearl, and made her heart very tender to him.\r\n\r\n\"I will wait--forever,\" said Pearl.\r\n\r\n\"Just until tomorrow,\" came back the voice--\"just till tomorrow--and\r\nit will be fine tomorrow--won't it, Pearl! Say it will be fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finer still,\" she replied, with her cheeks like the early roses in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThe day went by on satin wings--with each minute so charged with\r\nhappiness that Pearl could well believe that heaven had slipped down\r\nto earth, and that she was walking the streets of the new Jerusalem.\r\nShe sang as she worked in the house, her sweet, ribbony voice filling\r\nthe room with a gladness and rapture that made her mother, with her\r\nmystical Celtic temperament almost apprehensive.\r\n\r\n\"She's a queer girl, is Pearlie,\" she said that night, when Pearl had\r\ngone upstairs to arbitrate a quarrel which had broken out between\r\nBugsey and Danny as to whose turn it was to split the kindling wood.\r\n\"Day about\" it had been until Bugsey had urged that it be changed to\r\n\"week about,\" and the delicate matter in dispute now was as to the day\r\non which the week expired. Danny, who had been doing the kindling, was\r\ncertain that the date of expiry had arrived, but Bugsey's calendar\r\nset the day one day later, and the battle raged, with both sides ably\r\nargued, but unfortunately not listened to by the opposing forces.\r\n\r\n\"She's a queer child, is Pearlie,\" said Mrs. Watson, as she beat up\r\nthe bread-batter downstairs, \"she's that light-hearted and free from\r\ncare, and her eighteen years old. She's like somethin' that don't\r\nbelong on earth, with her two big eyes shinin' like lamps, and the way\r\nshe sings through the house, settin' the table or scourin' the milk\r\npails or mendin' a coat for the boys--it don't seem natural. She's too\r\nhappy, whatever its' about, and it makes me afraid for her. She's the\r\nkind that sees nothin' wrong, and won't see trouble comin' till its\r\ntoo late. I often feel afraid she's too good and happy for this world.\r\nShe's always been the same, liltin' and singin' and makin' everyone\r\nhappy around her.\"\r\n\r\nJimmy was washing his face in the enamel basin which stood on a box\r\nbelow the mirror, and looking around with a dripping wet face, felt\r\nwith a wildy swinging motion of his arms for the towel. When he had\r\nsecured it, and all danger of soapsuds getting into his eyes was\r\nremoved, he joined the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, Ma!\" he said, \"you don't know Pearl, she's not the saint you\r\ntake her for. I'll bet the Tucker kids don't think she's too good to\r\nlive. Not much! They know she can hold up her end of a row as well as\r\nany one. When she found out they had killed the cat they got from\r\nus, and tanned the skin to make a rim on a cap, you should have seen\r\nPearl. She just cut loose on the two of them, and chased them through\r\nthe sloughs and up the road clear home--larrupin' them with a binder\r\nwhip, as fast as she could swing it--the yowls out of them would have\r\ndone your heart good!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Watson stopped her work, with her floury hands raised in\r\nconsternation.\r\n\r\n\"God's mercy,\" she cried, \"did Pearl do that--and both of them\r\nbigger'n her. Ain't it a wonder they did not turn on her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn\"---Jimmy cried scornfully, \"Turn--is it? They were too busy\r\nrunnin'. Gosh--they would'a flew if they knew how. Served them\r\nright--they knew blame well they deserved it, for Pearl would never\r\nhave given them the cat if they hadn't worked it so smooth. They told\r\nher they wanted a strain of Tiger in their cats, for all of theirs\r\nwere black--and Pearl, gave them our fine young Tom--and they promised\r\nall sorts to be good to him--and when Pearl saw his skin on their\r\ncaps, and put it to them, they said they hadn't said it was a 'strain\r\nof tiger for their cats' they wanted, but a 'strand of tiger for their\r\ncaps'--that's what made Pearl so mad.\" Mr. Donald said Pearl did\r\nquite right, and he told the Tuckers they were the making of great\r\npoliticians--they were so smart at getting out of things. But Gosh,\r\nyou should have seen Pearl! She finished the job off right, too, you\r\nbet, and made them put up slab at the school and did the printin' on\r\nit in red ink. You can see it there,--they have had to print it over\r\nonce or twice. We all know the words off by heart:\r\n\r\n  Young Tom,\r\n  Tiger cat,\r\n  Owned by P. Watson,\r\n  Given away in good faith April 1st,\r\n  Wickedly killed to make a cap, April 15th,\r\n  Avenged by former owner, May 1st.\r\n  T. Tucker.        S. Tucker.\r\n\r\nPeople all look at it when they come to the church, and I guess the\r\nTuckers feel pretty small. Pearl says if they are really sorry, it is\r\nall right, and young Tom has not died in vain. Every cat has to die\r\nsometime, and if he had softened the Tucker's hearts--it is all right.\r\nPearl said she wasn't real sure about them, and I guess if they kill\r\nanother cat, she'll kill them sure--she said that's the way to do with\r\npeople like them. Make them repentant--or dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"God save us all,\" cried Mrs. Watson, in real distress, \"whatever will\r\nhappen to her when she goes out into the world. That's awful talk for\r\na girl especially. Whatever will become of her when she leaves home.\r\nShe'll be in hot water all the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear of Pearlie!\" said her father proudly--as he opened the end\r\ndoor of the stove and picked up a coal for his pipe, placing it\r\nwithout undue haste in the bowl, and carefully pressing it down with\r\nhis thumb. Leaning back in the chintz-covered rocking chair, he spread\r\nhis feet out to the heat which came from the oven door, and repeated,\r\n\"No fear of Pearlie--there ain't a girl in the country better able\r\nto do for herself. Faith--and she's no fool--and never was--I ain't\r\nworrying about Pearlie wherever she goes--or whatever she meets--I\r\nain't worrying.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't worry about anything, John,\" said Mrs. Watson, in reproof,\r\nas she covered the bread with many wrappings and fixed two chairs to\r\nhold it behind the stove for the night; \"you didn't even worry the\r\nnight the crop froze, sleepin' and snorin' the whole night through,\r\nwith me up every half hour watching the thermometer, and it slippin'\r\nlower and lower, and the pan o' water on the woodpile gettin' its\r\nlittle slivers of ice around the edge, and when the thermometer went\r\nto thirty, I knew it was all up with the wheat, but do you think I\r\ncould wake you--you rolled over with a grunt, leavin' me alone to\r\nthink of the two hundred acres gone in the night, after all our hard\r\nwork ... and then to have you come down in the mornin', stretchin'\r\nand yawnin', after a good night's sleep, and says you, as cheerful as\r\ncould be, 'Cold mornin', Ma!'\"\r\n\r\nJohn Watson took his pipe from his mouth, and laughed quietly.\r\n\r\n\"And what was wrong with that, Ma--sure now it was cold--you said\r\nyourself it was,\" he said gently.\r\n\r\nThe boys joined in the laugh, but Mrs. Watson repeated her point.\r\n\r\n\"Cold it was, sure enough, but think o' me up frettin' and fumin', and\r\nyou come down as cheerful as if starvation wasn't starin' us in the\r\nface.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we didn't starve, Ma,\" said Billy, coming to his father's\r\ndefense, \"the crop was all right for feed, and we did well after all.\r\nYou had all your frettin' for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's that way mostly,\" said John Watson, \"I never saw any good yet in\r\nfrettin'. Anyway, Ma does enough of it for all of us, so that lets\r\nme out. There's the two kinds of Irish--them that don't fret over\r\nanything--and them that frets over every thing--that's me and you,\r\nMa--and it works out fine--it runs about even. You've always been so\r\nsure that things were goin' wrong, I've just had to be a little surer\r\nthat they wern't. And then of course I knew that night that you would\r\nwatch the frost--if there was any watchin' to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"John, it is well for you that you have some one to do your watchin',\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Watson. \"You're an easy goin' man, John, but I'll say this\r\nfor you, that a better natured man never lived.\"\r\n\r\nWhen all the family had gone to bed, and the last sound had died out\r\nin the house, Pearl stood long at the window and looked out at the\r\nmoonlit valley. The warm day had melted the frost from the window, and\r\nwhen she put out the lamp, the moonlight seemed almost as clear as\r\nday. Silvery-mauve and blue it lay on the quiet, snowy fields, with a\r\ndeeper color on the trees, as if they had wound yards and yards of the\r\ngauzy stuff around their bare shoulders, for the night was chilly. To\r\nPearl it was even more beautiful than the sunshine of the day, for in\r\nits silvery stillness, she could think and dream without interruption.\r\n\r\nThe night was too beautiful to sleep, and the riot of joy in her heart\r\nmade her forget that anyone ever grew weary or tired. She was part of\r\nthe moonlight, with its glistening witchery, part of the overarching\r\nsky, with its wealth of glittering stars, part of the velvety night\r\nwind that caressed the trees in its gentle passing. Her young soul was\r\nin tune with them all! For the greatest thing in life had come to\r\nher in those few common-place words that had come to her over the\r\ntelephone. He had not forgotten--he was coming tomorrow!\r\n\r\nThe tired note in his voice had awakened an entirely new chord in the\r\nsong her heart sang. He needed her. He needed some one to look after\r\nhim, care for him, watch him, save him from the hundred little\r\nworrying things that were sapping his energy. People did not\r\nunderstand that he ever got tired--he was so strong, so buoyant, so\r\nready to do things for them. Well, there will be someone now, thought\r\nPearl, with a glow that surged through her veins and made her cheeks\r\nflame, to take care of him.\r\n\r\n\"Is the doctor in, Mrs. Clay?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is--but he's sleeping--maybe I can tell you what you want to\r\nknow--step in here--so he won't hear us--he was out all night--and he\r\nmust not be wakened....\"\r\n\r\nAnd when he had to go--she would harness the team and drive him, so he\r\ncould sleep all the way, and when the roads were fit for it, she would\r\ndrive the car--and soon she would be able to set bones and do common\r\nthings like that. He would show her--and then they would go to New\r\nYork--in two or three years maybe--he had told her once he wanted to\r\ndo this--for a post-graduate course--and they would have a little\r\nsuite, and she would study, too.\r\n\r\nAnd always, always, always they would be together--and no matter how\r\nmany people there were praising him and wanting him--he would just be\r\nher man--and at night, when he was tired--and all the noise of the day\r\nwas over and everyone was gone, she would have him all to herself.\r\n\r\nPearl's head sank on the window sill, while an ecstacy of joy swept\r\nover her--happy tears filled her eyes--life was so sweet--so rich--so\r\nfull....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF CLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the operation was over, the two doctors drove back to Millford,\r\nthe younger man so deeply engrossed in his own thoughts he hardly\r\nheard the older doctor's incessant conversation. But that did not in\r\nany wise discourage Dr. Brander, for to him, talking was much like\r\nbreathing, it went on easily, unconsciously, and without the necessity\r\nof a listener.\r\n\r\nOn Dr. Clay there had fallen the pleasant, drowsy feeling of one\r\nwhose work is done for the day, and a hard day it had been, with its\r\nuncertainty of the delayed train, and his patient's condition. But all\r\nhad gone well, and his patient's reaction had been satisfactory. More\r\nthan that, the older doctor had concurred in all that he had done, and\r\ncommended his treatment of the case from the beginning.\r\n\r\nSo, comfortably seated in the cutter, with a brown bear robe over\r\ntheir knees, and the mate of it over the seat, the two doctors drove\r\nhome in the purple-blue twilight, seated side by side, but with minds\r\nfar removed from each other.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's horses knew every road that led home, and trotted on\r\nwithout any guidance or word from him--they were a fine team of glossy\r\nchestnuts of whom the young doctor was extremely proud. But tonight, a\r\nstrange lassitude of spirit was upon him and he only wanted to relax\r\nhis weary brain and dream away the snowy miles to the rhythmic beat of\r\nthe horses' hoofs.\r\n\r\nHe had never been more contented in his life. His work was going\r\nwell--that day the Liberals had offered him the nomination for the\r\ncoming provincial election! It was an honor which he appreciated,\r\nthough he had no desire to enter politics. He loved his work--the\r\npeople he served were devoted to him--he could read it in their faces\r\nand their stammering words. He knew what they wanted to say,\r\neven though it was conveyed in a few halting fragments of\r\nsentences--\"You're all right--Doc--sure--glad you got here--we knew\r\nyou'd make it--somehow--you and them high steppers of yours can get\r\nthrough the snow--if any one can.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly, for a great weariness was on him, he began to think of Pearl,\r\nthe red-cheeked shining-eyed Pearl, who had singled him out for her\r\nfavor ever since he came to the village six years ago; Pearl, with her\r\ncontagious optimism and quaint ways, who had the good gift of putting\r\nevery one in good humor. He smiled to himself when he thought of\r\nhow often he had made it convenient to pass the school just at four\r\no'clock, and give Pearl and the rest of them a ride home, and the\r\ndelight he had always had in her fresh young face, so full of lights\r\nand shadows.\r\n\r\n\"Robbing the cradle, eh, Doc?\" Sam Motherwell had once said, in his\r\nclumsy way, when he met them on the road--\"Nothin' like pickin' them\r\nout young and trainin' them up the way you want them.\"\r\n\r\nHe had made no answer to this, but he still felt the wave of anger\r\nthat swept over him at the blundering words. \"All the same, I wish\r\nPearl were older\"--he had admitted to himself that day. \"If she\r\nkeeps her wise little ways and her clever tongue, she'll be a great\r\nwoman--she has a way with her.\"\r\n\r\nAt the rink, he had always looked forward to a skate with her--it was\r\nreally a dull night for him if she were not there, and now he wondered\r\njust what it was that attracted him so. There was a welcoming gladness\r\nin her eyes that flattered him, a comradeship in her conversation that\r\ndrew him on to talk with more ease and freedom; there was a wholesome\r\nfriendliness in what she said, which always left him a sense of\r\nphysical and mental well-being.\r\n\r\n\"What a nurse she would make,\" he thought, \"what a great nurse;\" \"I\r\nwish she were older ... eighteen is too young for a girl to marry--I\r\nwouldn't allow it at all--if I didn't know who she is getting--that\r\nmakes all the difference in the world ... of course her father and\r\nmother may object, but I believe what Pearl says, goes--what Pearl\r\nsays will go--with all of us! The Parker house can be bought--and\r\nfixed up ... we'll have a fireplace put in, and waterworks--I wish I\r\ndid not feel so tough and tired ... but she said she'd wait a thousand\r\nyears!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the voice of Dr. Brander rasped through his brain, and\r\nbrought him to attention:\r\n\r\n\"Clay, you're in love, or something--I don't believe you've heard a\r\nword I said, you young scamp, in the last six miles--and you've missed\r\na fine exposition on cancers--causes and cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Dr. Brander,\" he apologized, \"I believe I was\r\nalmost asleep. I get into a drowsy habit on my long drives--especially\r\nwhen I am coming home--when the days' work is over--it seems good to\r\nstretch out--but I do apologize: What were you saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I'm done now,\" said his companion, not in the least disturbed; \"I\r\nwant you to tell me about yourself and your work here. You know you\r\ninterest me, Clay. You are a sort of popular idol with all these\r\npeople, and I have been wondering how you do it. A man must give\r\nfreely of himself to be as popular as you are, Clay--do you ever find\r\nyourself giving out under the strain, and in need of a rest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a little tired, sometimes,\" the young man confessed, \"but it's\r\nnothing--at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man watched him narrowly, taking careful note that the pallor\r\nof his face had suddenly changed to a heightened color. \"When we get\r\nsupper, Clay, I want to have a serious talk with you. You may remember\r\nthat I approached this subject the last time you were in the city.\r\nI want to give you the report on the examination I gave you at that\r\ntime.\" There was a quality in his voice which gave the young man a\r\nmomentary sense of dread, not unmixed with a certain impatience. He\r\nwas too tired to be bothered. He wanted nothing but a chance to think\r\nhis own thoughts, as the sorrel team struck off the miles with their\r\ntireless feet.\r\n\r\nWhen they had had supper at the Chinese restaurant, they went to the\r\ndoctor's office. The sun, though long since set, still threw spikes\r\nof light upon the western sky and caught the under side of one ragged\r\ncloud which seemed to have been forgotten in an otherwise clear sky.\r\n\r\nIn the office, a cheerful coal fire glowed through its mica windows,\r\nand in front of the doctor's leather chair, were his slippers, and\r\nover it was thrown a brightly colored house coat.\r\n\r\nA gasoline lamp threw a strong white light on the comfortable room,\r\nand the city papers lay, still unfolded, on the table beside a pile of\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nThe old doctor exclaimed with delight:\r\n\r\n\"Who fixes you up so fine, Clay--surely there's a woman around this\r\nplace!\"\r\n\r\n\"My landlady\"--said the young doctor, \"looks after me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know,\" said the older man, \"I know the kind of fellow you\r\nare--the kind women love to fuss around. I'll bet you get dozens of\r\nbedroom slippers and ties and mufflers at Christmas. Women are like\r\ncats--they love to rub their heads against any one that will stroke\r\nthem and say 'poor pussy'--they're all the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe old doctor seated himself in the big chair and warmed his hands\r\nbefore the glowing coals.\r\n\r\n\"And now, Clay, I want to talk to you. There are certain facts that\r\nmust be told. I have been interested in your case ever since I met\r\nyou. You are a distinct type, with your impulsive temperament, clear\r\nskin and tapering fingers. But what I have to say to you would have\r\nbeen said easier if I did not know you so well--and if I had not been\r\nhere and seen you in your native setting--as it were.... Being\r\na medical man yourself, Clay, you know the difficulties of the\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor sat down suddenly, and smiled wanly:\r\n\r\n\"There need be no difficulty, Dr. Brander\", he said, \"I am ready to\r\nhear ...\" he left the sentence unfinished.\r\n\r\nThe old doctor went on:\r\n\r\n\"There is no immediate cause for alarm,\" he said, speaking slowly,\r\n\"people live for years with it, as you know--a cracked plate sometimes\r\noutlasts the good one--and as a matter of fact none of us are entirely\r\nfree from it.\"\r\n\r\nThe old doctor was swaying backwards as he spoke, and his voice rose\r\nand fell with the motion, as the tone of a phonograph when the door is\r\nopened or shut.\r\n\r\n\"You will have to be more careful, though, Clay, you will have to call\r\na halt on your activities--there must be no more of the all night\r\nsessions of yours--and those fifty mile drives--it is just like\r\nthis--you are carrying a mortgage on your business--a heavy\r\nmortgage--and yet one that the business can carry--with care, great\r\ncare. Many a good business man carries a heavy mortgage and pays well\r\ntoo, but of course it cannot stand financial strain or stress like the\r\nbusiness which is clear of debt. With great care, you should be good\r\nfor many years--but you must not draw on your reserves--you must never\r\nspend your capital--you must never be tired, or excited, or hurried,\r\nor worried.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this climate is a bit strenuous in winter--you must get out before\r\nanother one comes, and live some place that is easier. This country\r\nkeeps a man on his toes all the time, with its brilliant sunshine,\r\nits strong winds, its bracing air. You need a softer air, a duller\r\natmosphere, a sleepier environment that will make you never do today\r\nwhat you can put off till tomorrow, and never put off till tomorrow\r\nwhat you might as well put off till the day after tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a life!\" broke from the young man's lips.\r\n\r\n\"A very fascinating life, my dear sir,\" said the old doctor, intoning\r\nhis words like a very young clergyman--\"a fascinating life, and one\r\nthat I would enjoy. Here we hurry up in the morning and hurry to bed\r\nat night so we can hurry to get up again in the morning--we chase\r\nourselves around like a cat in the ancient pursuit of its own tail,\r\nand with about the same results. The Western mind is in a panic all\r\nthe time--losing time by the fear of losing time. The delights of\r\nmediation are not ours--we are pursued, even as we pursue; we are the\r\nchasers and the chased; the hunter and the hunted; we are spending and\r\nthe spent; we are borrowed and lent--and what is the good of it all? I\r\nhave always wanted to be an Oriental, dreaming in the shade of a palm\r\ntree, letting the sun and the wind ripen my fruits and my brain, while\r\nI sat--with never a care--king of the earth--and the air--O, take it\r\nfrom me, young fellow, there are wonderful delights in contemplation,\r\ndelights of which we are as ignorant as the color blind are of the\r\nchanging hues of the Autumn woods, or the deaf man is of music. We are\r\ndeaf, blind and dumb about the things of the soul! We think activity\r\nis the only form of growth.\"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor, whose handsome face had grown pale, watched him with\r\na sort of fascination. The words seemed to roll from his lips without\r\nthe slightest effort, and apparently without causing his heart one\r\nemotion. If the young doctor had not known him so well, he would have\r\nthought him entirely unconcerned:\r\n\r\n\"We are cursed, you and I, and all of us,\" he resumed, with too much\r\nactivity. We are obscessed with a passion for material achievement! We\r\nare hand-worshippers--leg-worshippers--speed-worshippers. We mistake\r\nactivity for progress.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is progress,\" burst from the young man, \"activity does bring\r\nachievement--development.\"\r\n\r\nThe door of the office opened suddenly, and two young fellows rushed\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming to the lacrosse meeting, Doc,--we are going to\r\norganize, and we want you for President again, of course.\"\r\n\r\nThen, seeing the city doctor, whom they recognized,--\r\n\r\n\"Excuse the interruption, but we can't get on without Dr. Clay, he's\r\nthe whole works of the lacrosse team.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not be able to go over tonight, boys,\" said the Doctor, \"but\r\nyou'll get on all right. You are getting to work pretty early--this is\r\nthe first fine day.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the lacrosse boys had gone, Dr. Clay finished his argument:\r\n\r\n\"These fellows prove what I was saying. When I came here six years\r\nago, there was not even a baseball team in the place--the young\r\nfellows gathered on street corners in summer, loafing and\r\nidling, revelling in crazy, foolish degrading stories--absolute\r\ndegenerations--now see them--on the tail of a blizzard, they dig out\r\ntheir lacrosse sticks and start the game on the second fine day.\r\nFrom the time the hockey is over now, until hockey time again--these\r\nfellows talk and dream lacrosse, and a decenter, cleaner lot of lads\r\nyou won't find anywhere. Activity has saved them--activity _is_\r\ngrowth, it is life--it is everything!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man shook his head slowly:\r\n\r\n\"They are not saved, my dear boy--none of us are--who depend on\r\noutward things for your happiness. Outward things change--vanish.\r\n'As a man thinketh in his heart--so is he!'--that is the secret of\r\ntriumphant living. As a man thinketh. These fellows of yours--for I\r\nknow this lacrosse team has been one of the many ways you took of\r\nsapping your energy--do not think. They play, run, scrap, cheer, but\r\nthere's no meditation--no turning inward of the thoughts, no mental\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\n\"It would not be natural for growing boys, alive to their fingertips,\r\nto sit yapping like lazy collie dogs, just thinking,\" said the young\r\ndoctor heatedly. \"They want avenues of self-expression, and in\r\nlacrosse and hockey they find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Artificial aids to happiness--every one of them--crutches for lame\r\nsouls--the Kingdom of Heaven is within you,\" the old doctor rambled\r\non, \"but it is all a part of this great new country--this big west is\r\nnew and crude and distinct--only the primary colors are used in the\r\npicture, there are no half tones, no shadows, and above all--or\r\nperhaps I should say behind all--no background. A thing is good or\r\nbad--black or white--blue or red. We are mostly posters here in this\r\ngreat big, dazzling country.\"\r\n\r\nIn the silence that fell on them, the young man's mind went limping\r\nback to the old doctor's first words--the dreadful, fateful,\r\nsignificant words. He had said it--said the thing that if it were true\r\nwould exile him from the world he loved! On him the ban had fallen!\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said he, standing behind his chair, whose back he held\r\nwith nervous fingers, \"there is no chance that you might be mistaken.\r\nIt is hard for me to believe this. I am so strong--so well--so much\r\nalive, except my cough--I am as well as ever I was, and the cough is a\r\nsimple thing--this seems impossible to me!\"\r\n\r\nThe old doctor had gone to the window to watch the throng of boys\r\nand girls who raced past on their way to the hill for an evening's\r\nsleigh-ride.\r\n\r\n\"It always seems impossible,\" he said, with the air of a man who is\r\ntotally disassociated from human affairs, and is simply stating an\r\ninteresting fact, \"that is part of the disease, and a very attractive\r\npart too. The people who have it, never think they have--even to the\r\nlast they are hopeful--and sure they will be better tomorrow. No, I am\r\nafraid I am not mistaken. You know yourself the theory Clay, of the\r\ntwo sets of microbes, the builders and the destroyers. Just at the\r\npresent moment, the destroyers have the best of it--they have put one\r\nover on the builders--but that does not say that the good microbes are\r\nnot working--and may yet win. You are young, buoyant, happy, hopeful,\r\ntemperate in your habits--all of which gives you a better chance--if\r\nyou will throw the weight of your influence on the side of the\r\nbuilders--there is a good chance of winning--I should think with your\r\nIrish blood you would enjoy the fight, Clay.\"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor turned around suddenly and threw back his head, with\r\nan impatient gesture.\r\n\r\n\"I love a fight, Dr. Brander, but it has to be of something worth\r\nwhile. I have fought for the life of a man, a woman, a child, and I\r\nhave fought joyfully--for life is sweet, and I desired it for these\r\npeople, believing it to be a good gift. But in the fight you outline\r\nfor me, I see nothing to fire man's heart. I won't fight for life if\r\nit means just breathing and scraping along at a poor, dying rate,\r\ncheating the undertaker of a nice little piece of legitimate\r\nbusiness--I can't grow enthusiastic over the prospect of\r\nalways thinking about myself--and my rest--and my sleep--or my\r\nclothes--always looking for a draught or fleeing from the night air or\r\na thunderstorm--never able to do a man's job or a day's work. I can't\r\ndo it, Dr. Brander, and you couldn't do it. It's a poor, miserable,\r\ndull existence, unhappy for me, and no service to any one.\"\r\n\r\nTwo red spots burned in his cheeks, and the old doctor, noticing them,\r\nwished again that he had come to see him sooner.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Clay,\" he said, sitting down again, with his hands spread\r\nout on his knees, \"you exaggerate this thing. You do not think you\r\nare working unless you are slaving and owling around all hours of the\r\nnight, setting bones and pulling teeth, or ushering into this wicked\r\nworld sundry squalling babies who never asked to come, and do not like\r\nit now they are here. You have been as strong as an ox, and keen as\r\na race-horse, now you have to slow up--you have to get out of this\r\ncountry before another winter, and when you come back in Spring you\r\ncan go on with your patients--always with care.\"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor surveyed him with curling lip.\r\n\r\n\"Resume my practice,\" he said, \"how simple. Send word ahead, I\r\nsuppose, by circular letter--\r\n\r\n\"'Dear Friends, I will be with you May 1st, to attend to your medical\r\nneeds. Save your appendicitis and neuralgia and broken bones for\r\nme. Medical season opens for business May 1st, every one welcome'.\r\nSomething like that ought to be sufficient to hold my practice. It has\r\nalways seemed to me very inconsiderate for people to get sick in\r\nthe winter, and certainly it is no time for infants to begin their\r\ncareer.... Now, see here, Dr. Brander, I appreciate all you say. I\r\nknow why you are talking this way to me. It is out of the kindness\r\nof your heart--for you have a soft old heart behind all that\r\nprofessionalism. But it does not look reasonable to me that a man who\r\nhas really lived, can ever drag along like you say. Who wants to live,\r\nanyway, beyond the time of usefulness? I don't. I want to pass out\r\nlike old Prince--you remember my good old roan pacer, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"That red-eyed old anarchist of yours that no one could harness but\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the one--as good a horse as ever breathed--misunderstood, that\r\nwas all--well, he passed on, as the scientists say, last Fall, passed\r\non in a blaze of glory too, but just how glorious his death was, I\r\ndon't believe I realized until tonight.\r\n\r\n\"How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a thirty mile drive to see Mrs. Porter, at Pigeon Lake--and\r\njust as I was about to start, another message came that it was very\r\nurgent if her life was to be saved. Old Prince would not drive\r\ndouble--and my team was tired out. So I started with him alone. The\r\nsnow came on when I was half way there, and that made the going\r\nbad--to add to the difficulties, a strong wind drove the blinding\r\nsnow in our faces. But the old boy ploughed on like a wrecking\r\nengine--going out in a storm to clear the track. He knew all about it,\r\nI never had to urge him. The last mile was the worst--he fell once,\r\nbut staggered to his feet and went on, on three legs.... When we got\r\nto the house, I knew it was all up with old Prince--he had made his\r\nlast journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he was still living when I came out to see him four hours later.\r\nThe men had put him in a box stall, and had done all they could, but\r\nhis eyes were rolling, and his heart missed every fourth beat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The two little girls came out and cried over him, and told him he had\r\nsaved their mother's life, and tried to get him to eat sugar lumps ...\r\nand--right to the last there was the same proud look in his red eyes,\r\nand he gave me a sort of wink which let me know it was all right--he\r\ndidn't blame me or any one--and so I kissed him once, on the white\r\nstar on his honest forehead, and I put my left arm around his head so\r\nhe couldn't see what was coming, and sent a bullet through his brain.\"\r\n\r\n\"We buried him on the hillside overlooking the lake, and the little\r\ngirls put a slab up over him, which says:\r\n\r\n  \"Prince of the house of Clay\r\n  Who saved our mother's life,\r\n  Lies here in peace, and lives\r\n  In grateful memory in our hearts.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence, in which each man's mind went back to the one\r\noverwhelming thought--that bound them so close together.\r\n\r\nThen the young doctor said slowly: \"If what you say is true, I envy\r\nPrince--and would gladly change places with him.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man recovered himself in a moment: \"You take things too\r\nseriously, Clay,\" he said quickly: \"be glad you are not married. A\r\nwife and children clutter up a man's affairs at a time like this--you\r\nare quite free from family ties, I believe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite free,\" the young man replied, \"all my relatives live in the\r\nEast, all able to look after themselves. I have no person depending on\r\nme--financially, I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Marriage,\" began the old doctor, in his most professional tone, as\r\none who reads from a manuscript, \"is one-fourth joy and three-fourths\r\ndisappointment. There is no love strong enough to stand the grind of\r\ndomestic life. Marriage would be highly successful were it not for the\r\nfearful bore of living together. Two houses, and a complete set of\r\nservants would make marriage practically free from disappointments.\r\nI think Saint Paul was right when he advised men to remain single if\r\nthey had serious work to do. Women, the best of them, grow tiresome\r\nand double-chinned in time.\"\r\n\r\nThe young doctor laughed his own big, hearty laugh, the laugh which\r\nhis devoted patients said did them more good than his medicine.\r\n\r\n\"I like that,\" he said, \"a man with a forty-two waist measure, wearing\r\nan eighteen inch collar, finding fault with a woman's double chin. You\r\nare not such a raving beauty yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\"I do not need to be. I am a doctor, a prescriber of pills, a mender\r\nof bones, a plumber of pipes ... my work does not call for beauty.\r\nBeauty is an embarrassment to a doctor. You would be happier, young\r\nfellow, without that wavy brown hair and those big eyes of yours, with\r\ntheir long lashes. A man is built for work, like a truck. Gold and\r\nleather upholstering do not belong there. Women are different; it is\r\ntheir place in life to be beautiful, and when they fail in that, they\r\nfail entirely. They have no license to be fat, flabby double-chinned,\r\nflat-footed. It is not seemly, and of course you cannot tell how any\r\nof them may turn out. They are all pretty at sixteen. That is what\r\nmakes marriage such a lottery.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't agree with you at all,\" said his companion, \"it is absurd to\r\nexpect a woman of fifty to have the slim grace of a girl of eighteen.\r\nMy mother was a big woman, and I always thought her very beautiful.\r\nI think you have a pagan way of looking at marriage. Marriage is a\r\nmutual agreement, for mutual benefit and comfort, for sympathy and\r\ncompanionship. Family life develops the better side of human nature,\r\nand casts out selfishness. Many a man has found himself when he gets a\r\nwife, and in the caring for his children has thrown off the shackels\r\nof selfishness. People only live when they can forget themselves, for\r\nselfishness is death. Your a great doctor, Dr. Brander, but a poor\r\nphilosopher.\"\r\n\r\nThe older man smiled grimly.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Clay,\" he said, \"did you ever think of how nature fools us\r\npoor dupes? Nature, old Dame Nature, has one object, and that is to\r\npeople the earth--and to this end she shapes all her plans. She makes\r\nwomen beautiful, graceful, attractive and gives them the instinct to\r\ndress in a way that will attract men. Makes them smaller and weaker\r\nthan men, too, which also makes its appeal. Why, if I hadn't watched\r\nmy step, I'd been married a dozen times. These little frilled and\r\npowdered vixens have nearly got me.... If nature used half as much\r\ncare in keeping people healthy and free from accidents, as she does\r\nin getting them here--it would be a happier world. But that is not\r\nnature's concern--She leaves that to the doctors!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how does the time go? Isn't that the train whistle?\"\r\n\r\n\"No hurry,\" said Dr. Clay, rising, \"it stops at the water-tank, and\r\nthat whistle is for the hill.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked over to the station in silence, and stood watching the red\r\neye that came gliding through the moonlit valley. The train seemed to\r\nbe slipping in to the station without a sound, in the hope that no one\r\nwould notice how late it was.\r\n\r\n\"Come up and see me, Clay,\" said the old man kindly. \"I want to give\r\nyou a thorough examination--and I will expect you in a week--we'll\r\ntalk things over, and see what is best. You have my bag, don't bother\r\ncoming on--all right then--here's a double seat--so I can stretch\r\nout--though it's hardly worth while for an hour. Goodbye Clay,\r\nremember all I told you!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor went back to his office, he sat long in his chair in\r\nfront of the fire, and thought. The place was the same--the cheerful\r\nfire--the rows of books--the Fathers of Confederation picture on\r\nthe wall--and his college group. Everything was the same as it had\r\nbeen--only himself. Everything in the room was strong, durable, almost\r\neverlasting, able to resist time and wear. He was the only perishable\r\nthing, it seemed.\r\n\r\nHe wondered how people act when confronted by the ruin of their hopes.\r\nDo they rave and curse and cry aloud? He could not think clearly--his\r\nmind seemed to avoid the real issue and refuse to strike on the sore\r\nplace, and he thought of all sorts of other things.\r\n\r\nThe permanence--the dreadful permanence of everything in the room\r\nseemed to oppress him. \"Man is mortal,\" he said, \"his possessions\r\noutlive him every last one of these things is more durable than I am\".\r\nThe gray wall of the office--so strong and lasting--what chance had\r\nan army of microbes against it--the heavy front door, with its cherry\r\npanels and brass fittings, had no fear of draughts or cold. It had\r\nlimitless resistance. The stocky stove, on its four squat legs, could\r\nhold its own and snap its fingers at time. They were all so arrogantly\r\nindestructible, so fearfully permanent--they had no sympathy, no\r\ncommon meeting ground with him.\r\n\r\nA knock sounded on the door, and when he opened it, the station agent\r\nwas there, with a long box in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"It's marked 'Rush,' so I thought I had better shoot it over to you,\r\nDoc,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, old man,\" the Doctor said mechanically, and put the box down\r\non the table. On a white label, in bright red letters, stood out the\r\nword 'Perishable.'\r\n\r\nThe word struck him like a blow between the eyes. \"Perishable!\" Then\r\nhere was something to which he might feel akin. He opened the box,\r\nwith detached interest. A sweet breath of roses proclaimed the\r\ncontents. He had forgotten about sending for them until now--Pearl's\r\nroses for this day--nineteen American Beauties!\r\n\r\nHe carefully unpacked the wrapping, and held up the sheaf of\r\nloveliness, and just for one moment had the thrill of joy that beauty\r\nhad always brought to him. Pearl's roses! The roses, with which he\r\nhad hoped to say what was in his heart--here they were, in all their\r\nexquisite loveliness, and ready to carry the words of love and hope\r\nand tenderness--but now ... he had nothing to say ... love and\r\nmarriage were not for him!\r\n\r\nHe sat down heavily, beside the table over which the roses lay\r\nscattered, spilling their perfume in the room.\r\n\r\nHe fingered them lovingly, smoothing their velvety petals with a\r\ntender hand, while his mind sought in vain to readjust itself to the\r\nchange the last two hours had brought.\r\n\r\nHe turned again to the fire, which glowed with blue and purple lights\r\nbehind the windows of isinglass, curling and flaming and twisting,\r\nwith fascinating brilliance. Long he sat, watching it, while the\r\nsounds outside in the street grew less and less, and at last when he\r\nwent to the window, he found the street in darkness and in silence.\r\nThe moon had set, and his watch told him it was two o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe wind whimpered in the chimney like a lonesome puppy, rising and\r\nfalling, cying out and swelling with eerie rhythm; a soft spring wind,\r\nhe knew it was, that seemed to catch its breath like a thing in pain.\r\n\r\nLooking again at the roses, he noticed that the leaves were drooping.\r\nHe hastily went into the dispensary and brought out two graduates\r\nfilled with water to put them in; but when he lifted them--he\r\nsaw, with poignant pain--they were gone past helping--they were\r\nfrost-bitten.\r\n\r\nThen it was that he gathered them in his arms, with sudden passion,\r\nand as he sat through the long night, he held them closely to him, for\r\nkin of his they surely were--these frosted roses, on whose fragrant\r\nyoung hearts the blight had so prematurely fallen!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTANGLED THREADS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt daybreak, when the light from the eastern sky came in blue at the\r\nwindow blind, and the gasoline lamp grew sickly and pale, the doctor\r\nwent to bed. He had thought it all out and outlined his course of\r\naction.\r\n\r\nHe did not doubt the old doctor's word; his own knowledge gave\r\ncorroborative evidence that it was quite true, and he wondered he had\r\nnot thought of it. Still, there was something left for him to do. He\r\nwould play up and play the game, even if it were a losing fight. His\r\nown house had fallen, but it would be his part now to see that the\r\nminimum amount of pain would come to Pearl over it. She was young,\r\nand had all the world before her--she would forget. He had a curious\r\nshrinking from having her know that he had the disease, for like most\r\ndoctors, he loathed the thought of disease, and had often quoted\r\nto his patients in urging them to obey the laws of physiological\r\nrighteousness, the words of Elbert Hubbard that \"The time would come\r\nwhen people would feel more disgrace at being found in a hospital than\r\nin a jail, for jails were for those who broke men's laws, but those in\r\nthe hospital had broken the laws of God!\"\r\n\r\nHe shuddered now when he thought of it, it all seemed so\r\nunnecessary--so wantonly cruel--so so inexplicable.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Pearl must not know, for instinctively he felt that if she\r\nknew he was a sick man, she would marry him straight away--she would\r\nbe so sweet about it all, and so hopeful and sure he would get well,\r\nand such a wonderfully skilful and tender nurse, that he would surely\r\nget well. For one blissful but weak moment, which while it thrilled\r\nit frightened him still more--he allowed himself to think it would be\r\nbest to tell her. Just for one weak moment the thought came--to be\r\nbanished forever from his mind. No! No! No! disaster had come to him,\r\nbut Pearl would not be made to suffer, she would not be involved in\r\nany way.\r\n\r\nBut just what attitude to take, perplexed him. Those big, soft brown\r\neyes of hers would see through any lie he tried to invent, and he\r\nwas but a poor liar anyway. What could he tell Pearl? He would\r\ntemporize--he would stall for time. She was too young--she had seen so\r\nlittle of the world--it would be hard to wait--he believed he could\r\ntake that line with her--he would try it.\r\n\r\nWhen he awakened, the sun was shining in the room, with a real spring\r\nwarmth that just for a minute filled him with gladness and a sense of\r\nwellbeing. Then he remembered, and a groan burst from his lips.\r\n\r\nThe telephone rang:\r\n\r\nReaching out, he seized it and answered.\r\n\r\n\"It's me,\" said a voice, \"It's Pearl! I am coming in--I know you're\r\ntired after yesterday, and you need a long sleep--so don't disturb\r\nyourself--I'll be in about two o'clock--just when the sun is\r\nbrightest--didn't I tell you it would be finer still today?\"\r\n\r\n\"You surely did, Pearl,\" he answered, \"however you knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not coming just to see you--ma wants a new strainer, and Bugsey\r\nneeds boots, and Mary has to have another hank of yarn to finish the\r\nsweater she's knitting--these are all very urgent, and I'll get them\r\nattended to first, and then....\"\r\n\r\nShe paused:\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll come and see me, Pearl\"--he finished, \"and we'll have the\r\nmeeting which we adjourned three years ago--to meet yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" she said, \"and goodbye until then.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch, it was just ten--there was yet time.\r\n\r\nReaching for the telephone, he called long distance, Brandon. \"Give me\r\nOrchard's greenhouses,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAfter a pause he got the wire:\r\n\r\n\"Send me a dozen and a half--no, nineteen--American Beauty roses on\r\ntoday's train, without fail. This is Dr. Clay of Millford talking.\"\r\n\r\nHe put back the telephone, and lay back with a whimsical smile,\r\ntwisting his mouth. \"The frosted ones are mine,\" he said to himself,\r\n\"there will be no blight or spot or blemish on Pearl's roses.\"\r\n\r\nIt was quite like Pearl to walk into the doctors' office without\r\nembarrassment. It was also like her to come at the exact hour she had\r\nstated in her telephone message--and to the man who sat waiting for\r\nher, with a heart of lead, she seemed to bring the whole sunshine of\r\nSpring with her.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, Dr. Clay did not notice what women wore, they all looked\r\nabout the same to him--but he noticed that Pearl's gray coat and furs\r\njust needed the touch of crimson which her tam o'shanter and gloves\r\nsupplied, and which seemed to carry out the color in her glowing\r\ncheeks. She looked like a red apple in her wholesomeness.\r\n\r\nHe had tried to get the grittiness of the sleepless night out of his\r\neyes, and had shaved and dressed himself with the greatest care,\r\ntelling himself it did not matter--but the good habit was deeply\r\nfastened on him and could not be set aside.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing about the well-dressed young man, with his carefully\r\nbrushed hair and splendid color, to suggest disease. Pearl's eyes\r\napproved of each detail, from the way his hair waved and parted back;\r\nthe dull gold and purple tie, which seemed to bring out the bronze\r\ntones in his hair and the steely gray of his eyes; the well-cut\r\nbusiness suit of rough brown tweed, with glints of green and bronze,\r\ndown to the dark brown, well-polished boots.\r\n\r\nPearl was always proud of him; it glowed in her eyes again today,\r\nand again he felt it, warming his heart and giving him the sense of\r\nwell-being which Pearl's presence always brought. All at once he felt\r\nrested and full of energy.\r\n\r\nWhen the first greetings were over, and Pearl had seated herself, at\r\nhis invitation, in the big chair, he said, laughing:\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a fine day, Miss Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is that!\" said Pearl, with her richest brogue, which he had often\r\ntold her he hoped she would never lose.\r\n\r\n\"And you are eighteen years old now,\" he said, in the same tone.\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen, going on nineteen,\" she corrected gaily.\r\n\r\n\"All right, eighteen--going on--nineteen. Three years ago there was a\r\nlittle bargain made between us--without witnesses, that we would defer\r\nall that was in our minds for three years--we'd give the matter a\r\nthree years' hoist--and then take it up just where we left it!\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded, without speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Now I have thought about it a lot,\" he went on, \"indeed I do not\r\nthink a day has gone by without my thinking of it, and incidentally,\r\nI have thought of myself and my belongings. I wish to draw your\r\nattention to them--I am twenty-nine years old--I've got a ten years'\r\nstart of you, and I will always expect to be treated with respect on\r\naccount of my years--that's clearly understood, is it?\"\r\n\r\nHe was struggling to get himself in hand.\r\n\r\n\"Clearly understood,\" she repeated, with her eyes on him in\r\nunmistakable adoration.\r\n\r\n\"Six years ago,\" he seemed to begin all over gain--\"I came out of\r\ncollege, with all sorts of fine theories, just bubbling over with\r\nenthusiasm, much the same as you are now, fresh from Normal, but\r\nsomehow they have mostly flattened out, and now I find myself settling\r\ndown to the prosy life of a country doctor, who feeds his own horses\r\nand blackens his own boots, and discusses politics with the retired\r\nfarmers who gather in the hardware store. I catch myself at it quite\r\noften. Old Bob Johnson and I are quite decided there will be a war\r\nwith Germany before many years. We don't stop at Canadian affairs--the\r\nworld is not too wide for us! Yes, Pearl, here I am, a country doctor,\r\nwith an office in need of paint--a very good medical library--in need\r\nof reading--a very common-place, second-rate doctor--who will never\r\nbe a great success, who will just continue to grub along. With you,\r\nPearl, it is different. You have ambition, brains--and something about\r\nyou that will carry you far--I always knew it--and am so glad that at\r\nthe Normal they recognized your ability.\"\r\n\r\nA puzzled look dimmed the brightness of her eyes just for a moment,\r\nand the doctor stumbled on.\r\n\r\n\"I am all right, as far as I go--but there's not enough of me--I'm not\r\nbig enough for you, Pearl.\"\r\n\r\nPearl's eyes danced again, as she looked him up and down, and he\r\nlaughed in spite of himself.\r\n\r\n\"For goodness sake, girl,\" he cried, \"don't look at me, you make me\r\nforget what I was saying--I can't think, when you train those eyes of\r\nyours on me.\"\r\n\r\nPearl obediently turned her head away, but he could still see the\r\ndimple in her cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"I have had a long fight with myself, Pearl,\" and now that he was back\r\nto the truth, his voice had its old mellowness that swept her heart\r\nwith tenderness--\"a long fight--and it is not over yet. I'm selfish\r\nenough to want you---that is about 99.9% of me is selfish, the other\r\ninfinitesimal part cries out for me to play the man--and do the square\r\nthing--I am making a bad job of this, but maybe you understand.\"\r\n\r\nHe came over and turned her head around until she faced him.\r\n\r\n\"I have begun at the wrong end of this, dear, I talk as if you had\r\nsaid--you cared--I have no right to think you do. I should remember\r\nyou are only a child--and haven't thought about--things like this!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, haven't I, though,\" she cried eagerly. \"I've been thinking--all\r\nthe time--I've never stopped thinking--I've had the loveliest time\r\nthinking.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor went on in a measured tone, as one who must say the words\r\nhe hates to utter. All the color had gone from his voice, all the\r\nflexibility. It was as hard as steel now, and as colorless as a dusty\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl, I am going to say what I should say, not what I want to\r\nsay.... Supposing I did induce you to marry me now. Suppose I could\r\n... in ten years from now, when you are a woman grown, you might\r\nhate me for taking advantage of your youth, your inexperience, your\r\nchildish fancy for me--I am not prepared to take that risk--it would\r\nbe a criminal thing to run any chances of spoiling a life like yours.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes looked straight into his, and there was a little muttered cry\r\nin them that smote his heart with pity. He had seen it in the faces of\r\nlittle children, his patients, who, though hurt, would not cry.\r\n\r\n\"And I am selfish enough to hope that in a few years, when you are old\r\nenough to choose, you will think of what I am doing now, and know the\r\nsacrifice I am making, and come to me of your own free will--no, I did\r\nnot intend to say that--I do not mean what I said--the world is yours,\r\nPearl, to choose as you will--I have no claim on you! You start fair.\"\r\n\r\nPearl's cheeks had lost a little of their rosy glow, and her face\r\nhad taken on a cream whiteness. She stood up and looked at him, with\r\nwidely opened eyes. A girl of smaller soul might have misunderstood\r\nhim, and attributed to him some other motive. Though Pearl did not\r\nagree with him, she believed every word he had said.\r\n\r\n\"Supposing,\" she said eagerly, \"that I do not want to start\r\nfair--and don't want to be free to choose--supposing I have made my\r\nchoice--supposing I understand you better than you do yourself, and\r\ntell you now that you are not a second-hand doctor--that you are a sun\r\nand a shield to this little town and country, just as you have been to\r\nme--you bring health and courage by your presence--the people love and\r\ntrust you--suppose I remind you that you are not only a doctor,\r\nbut the one that settles their quarrels and puts terror into the\r\nevil-doer. Who was it that put the fear into Bill Plunkett when he\r\nblackened his wife's eyes, and who was it that brought in the two\r\nchildren from the Settlement, that were abused by their step-father,\r\nand took the old ruffian's guns away from him and marched him in too!\r\nThat's a job for a second-rate doctor, isn't it? I hear the people\r\ntalking about you, and I have to turn my back for fear they hear my\r\neyes shouting out, 'That's my man you're praising' and here he is,\r\ntelling me he is a second-rate doctor! Is that what you were when the\r\nfever was so bad, and all the Clarke's had it at once, and you nursed\r\nsix of them through it? Mrs. Clarke says the only undressing you did\r\nwas to loosen your shoe-laces!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see--I know you better than you do yourself. You don't see\r\nhow big your work is. Is it a small thing to live six years in a place\r\nand have every one depending on you, praising you--loving you--and\r\nbeing able to advise them and lead the young fellows anyway you\r\nlike--making men of them, instead of street loafers--and their mothers\r\nso thankful they can hardly speak of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You evidently don't know what we think of you, any of us--and here\r\nI am--I don't know when it began with me--the first day I saw you--I\r\nthink, when I was twelve--I've been worshipping you and treasuring up\r\nevery word you ever said to me. I don't know whether it is love or\r\nnot, it's something very sweet. It has made me ambitious to look my\r\nbest, do my best and be my best. I want to make you proud of me--I\r\nwill make you proud of me--see if I don't--I want to be with you, to\r\nhelp you, look after you--grow up with you--I don't know whether it is\r\nlove or not--it--is something! There is nothing too hard for me to do,\r\nif it is for you--everything--any thing would be sweet to me--if you\r\nwere with me. Is that love?\"\r\n\r\nShe was standing before him, holding his hand in both of hers, and her\r\neyes had the light in them, the tender, glowing light that seemed to\r\nflame blue at the edges, like the coal fire he had watched the night\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nImpulsively he drew her to him, and for a moment buried his face in\r\nher warm, white neck, kissing the curling strands of her brown hair.\r\n\r\n\"O Pearl,\" he cried, drawing away from her, \"O Pearl--you're a hard\r\ngirl to give up--you make me forget all my good resolutions. I don't\r\nwant to do what I ought to do. I just want you.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a smothered cry in his voice that smote on Pearl's heart\r\nwith a sudden fear. Mothers know the different notes in their\r\nchildren's cries--and in Pearl, the maternal instinct was strong.\r\n\r\nShe suddenly understood. He was suffering, there was a bar between\r\nthem--for some reason, he could not marry her!\r\n\r\nShe grew years older, it seemed, in a moment, and the thought that\r\ncame into her brain, clamoring to be heard, exultantly, insistently\r\nknocking for admission, was this--her mother's pessimistic way of\r\nlooking at life was right--there were things too good to be true--she\r\nhad been too sure of her happiness. The thought, like cold steel, lay\r\nagainst her heart and dulled its beating. But the pain in his eyes\r\nmust be comforted. She stood up, and gravely took the hand he held out\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor,\" she said steadily, \"you are right, quite right, about\r\nthis--a girl of eighteen does not know her own mind--it is too serious\r\na matter--life is too long--I--I think I love you--I mean I thought I\r\ndid--I know I like to be with you--and---all that--but I'm too young\r\nto be sure--and I'll get over this all right. You're right in all you\r\nsay--and it's a good thing you are so wise about this--we might have\r\nmade a bad mistake--that would have brought us unhappiness. But it has\r\nbeen sweet all the time, and I'm not sorry--we'll just say no more\r\nabout it now and don't let it worry you--I can stand anything--if\r\nyou're not worried.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in amazement--and not being as quick as she, her\r\nwords deceived him, and there was not a quiver on her lips, as she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"I'll go now, doctor, and we'll just forget what we were saying--they\r\nwere foolish words. I'm thinking of going North to teach--one of the\r\ninspectors wrote me about a school there. I just got his letter today,\r\nand he asked me to wire him--I'll be back at the holidays.\"\r\n\r\nShe put the red tam on her brown hair, tucking up the loose strands,\r\nin front of the glass, as she spoke. Manlike, he did not see that her\r\nhands trembled, and her face had gone white. He sat looking at her in\r\ndeep admiration.\r\n\r\n\"What a woman you are, Pearl,\" broke from his lips.\r\n\r\nShe could not trust herself to shake hands, or even look at him. Her\r\none hope was to get away before her mask of unconcern broke into a\r\nthousand pieces by the pounding of her heart, which urged her to throw\r\nher arms around him and beg him to tell her what was really wrong--oh,\r\nwhy wouldn't he tell her!\r\n\r\n\"You'll think of this dear,\" he said, \"in a few years when you are, I\r\nhope, happily married to the man of your choice, and you will have a\r\nkindly thought for me, and know I was not a bad sort--you'll remember\r\nevery word of this Pearl, and you will understand that what is\r\nstrange to you now--and you will perhaps think of me--and if not with\r\npleasure, it will at least be without pain.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to give her the roses, which had come just a few moments\r\nbefore she came in, but somehow he could not frame a casual word of\r\ngreeting. He would send them to her.\r\n\r\nShe was going now.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl, dearest Pearl,\" he cried \"I cannot let you go like this--and\r\nyet--it's best for both of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure it is,\" she said, smiling tightly, to keep her lips from\r\nquivering. \"I'm feeling fine over it all.\" The pain in his voice made\r\nher play up to her part.\r\n\r\n\"I can't even kiss you, dear,'\" he said. \"I don't want you to have one\r\nbitter memory of this. I want you to know I was square--and loved you\r\ntoo well to take the kiss, which in after life might sting your face\r\nwhen you thought that I took advantage of your youth. A young girl's\r\nfirst kiss is too sacred a thing.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Pearl's resolution broke down. It was the drawn look in his\r\nface, and its strange pallor.\r\n\r\nShe reached up and kissed his cheek.\r\n\r\n\"A little dab of a kiss like that won't leave a sting on any one's\r\nface,\" she said.\r\n\r\nShe was gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWHERE MRS. CROCKS THREW THE SWITCH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl came out of the doctor's office into the sunshine of the\r\nvillage street, she had but one thought--one overwhelming desire,\r\nexpressed in the way she held her head, and the firm beat of her\r\nlow-heeled shoes on the sidewalk--she must get away where she would\r\nnot see him or the people she knew. She realized that whatever it was\r\nthat had come between them was painful to him, and that he really\r\ncared for her. To see her, would be hard on him, embarrassing to them\r\nboth, and she would do her share by going away--and she remembered,\r\nwith a fresh pang--that when she had spoken of this, he had made no\r\nobjection, thus confirming her decision that for her to go would be\r\nthe best way.\r\n\r\nThe three glorious years, so full of hopes and dreams, were over!\r\nPearl's house of hopes had fallen! All was over! And it was not his\r\nfault--he was not to blame. Instinctively, Pearl defended him in her\r\nmind against a clamorous sense of injustice which told her that she\r\nhad not had a square deal! The pity of it all was what choked her and\r\nthreatened to storm her well guarded magazine of self-control! It was\r\nall so sudden, so mysterious and queer, and yet, she instinctively\r\nfelt, so inexorable!\r\n\r\nPearl had always been scornful of the tears of lovelorn maidens, and\r\nwhen in one of her literature lessons at the Normal, the sad journey\r\nof the lily-maid on her barge of black samite, floating down the\r\nriver, so dead and beautiful, with the smile on her face and the lily\r\nin her hand, reduced form A to a common denominator of tears, and\r\nmade the whole room look like a Chautauqua salute, Pearl had stoutly\r\ndeclared that if Elaine had played basketball or hockey instead\r\nof sitting humped up on a pile of cushions in her eastern tower,\r\nbroidering the sleeve of pearls so many hours a day, she wouldn't have\r\ndied so easily nor have found so much pleasure in arranging her own\r\nfuneral.\r\n\r\nBut on this bright March day, the village street seemed strangely dull\r\nand dead to her, with an empty sound like a phone that has lost its\r\nconnection. Something had gone from her little world, leaving it\r\nmotionless, weary and old! A row of icicles hung from the roof of the\r\ncorner store, irregular and stained from the shingles above, like an\r\nugly set of ill-kept teeth, dripping disconsolately on the sidewalk\r\nbelow, and making there a bumpy blotch of unsightly ice!\r\n\r\nIn front of the store stood the delivery sleigh, receiving its load\r\nof parcels, which were thrown in with an air of unconcern by a blocky\r\nyoung man with bare red hands. The horse stood without being tied, in\r\nan apparently listless and melancholy dream. A red and white cow\r\ncame out of the lane and attempted to cross the slippery sidewalk,\r\nsprawling helplessly for a moment, and then with a great effort\r\nrecovered herself and went back the way she came, limping painfully,\r\nthe blocky young man hastening her movements by throwing at her a\r\npiece of box lid, with the remark that that would \"learn her.\"\r\n\r\nThe sunshine so brilliant and keen, had a cold and merciless tang in\r\nit, and a busy-body look about it, as if it delighted in shining into\r\nforbidden corners and tearing away the covers that people put on their\r\nsorrows, calling all the world to come and see! Pearl shuddered with\r\nthe sudden realization that the sun could shine and the wind could\r\nblow bright and gay as ever, though hearts were writhing in agony!\r\n\r\nShe hoped she would not see any of the people she knew, for the pain\r\nthat lay like a band of ice around her heart might be showing in her\r\nface--and Pearl knew that the one thing she could not stand was a word\r\nof sympathy. That would be fatal. So she hurried on. She would send a\r\nwire of acceptance to her inspector friend, and then go over to the\r\nstable for her horse, and be on her way home.\r\n\r\nBut there is something whimsical about fate. It takes a hand in our\r\naffairs without apology, and throws a switch at the last moment. If\r\nPearl had not met Mrs. Crocks at the corner, just before she took the\r\nstreet to the station, this would have been a different story. But who\r\nknows? We never get a chance to try the other way, and it is best and\r\nwisest and easiest of comprehension to believe that whatever is, is\r\nbest!\r\n\r\nMrs. Crocks was easily the best informed person regarding local\r\nhappenings, in the small town of Millford. She really knew. Every\r\ncommunity has its unlicensed and unauthorized gossips, who think they\r\nknow what their neighbors are thinking and doing, but who more often\r\nthan not get their data wrong, and are always careless of detail. Mrs.\r\nCrocks was not one of these.\r\n\r\nWhen Bill Cavers got drunk, and spent in one grand, roaring spree all\r\nthe money which he and his wife and Libby Anne had saved for their\r\ntrip to Ontario, there were those who said that he went through six\r\nhundred dollars that one night, making a rough guess at the amount.\r\nMrs. Crocks did not use any such amateur and unsatisfactory way of\r\narriving at conclusions. She did not need to--there was a way of\r\nfinding out! To the elevator she went, and looked at the books under\r\ncover of looking up a wheat ticket which her husband had cashed and\r\nfound that Bill Cavers had marketed seventeen hundred and eight\r\ndollars worth of wheat. From this he had paid his store bill, and the\r\nblacksmith's bill, which when deducted, left him eight hundred and\r\nfourteen dollars--she did not bother with the cents. The deductions\r\nwere easily verified--both the storekeeper and the blacksmith were\r\nmarried men!\r\n\r\nThis was the method she followed in all her research--careful,\r\nlaborious and accurate at all costs, with a fine contempt for her less\r\nscientific contemporaries. The really high spots in her life had been\r\nwhen she was able to cover her competitors with confusion by showing\r\nthat their facts were all wrong, which process she referred to as\r\n\"showing up these idle gossips.\"\r\n\r\nJames Crocks, her husband, had chosen for himself a gentler avocation\r\nthan his wife's, and one which brought him greater peace of\r\nmind--proprietor of the big red stable which spread itself over half a\r\nblock, he had unconsciously defined himself, as well as his place of\r\nbusiness, by having printed in huge white letters with black edging\r\nacross the shingled roof, the words:\r\n\r\n\"HORSE REPOSITORY\" PROP.J. CROCKS.\r\n\r\nHere the tired horses could forget the long trail and the heavy loads,\r\nin the comfortable stalls, with their deep bedding of clean straw; and\r\nhere also, James Crocks himself was able to find the cheerful company,\r\nwho ate their meals in quietude of heart, asking no questions,\r\nimputing no motives, knowing nothing of human intrigue, and above\r\nall, never, never insisting that he tell them what he thought about\r\nanything! Most of his waking hours were spent here, where he found the\r\ngentle sounds of feeding horses, the honest smell of prairie hay and\r\nthe blessed absence of human chatter very soothing and restful.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, and James Crocks grew more and more averse to human\r\nspeech--having seen it cause so much trouble one way'n another, Mrs.\r\nCrocks found it was an economy of effort to board one of the stable\r\nboys, and that is how it came about that Mr. Bertie Peters found\r\nhimself called from the hay-mow above the stable, to his proprietors'\r\nguest chamber, and all the comforts of a home, including nightly\r\nportions of raisin pie--and best of all, an interested and\r\nappreciative audience who liked to hear him talk. Mrs. Crocks as usual\r\nhad made a good choice, for as Bertie talked all the time, he was sure\r\nto say something once in a while. A cynical teacher had once said of\r\nBertie, that he never had an \"unuttered thought.\"\r\n\r\nBut even though the livery stable happenings as related by Bertie gave\r\nMrs. Crocks many avenues of information, all of her prescience could\r\nnot be explained through that or any other human agency. The young\r\ndoctor declared she had the gift or divination, was a mind reader, and\r\ncould see in the dark! Many a time when he had gone quietly to the\r\nstable and taken out his team without as much as causing a dog to\r\nbark, removing his sleigh bells to further cover his movements, and\r\nstealing out of town like an absconding bank-teller, to make a call,\r\nreturning the same way, still under cover of night, and flattering\r\nhimself that he had fooled her this time, she would be waiting for\r\nhim, and timed her call to the exact minute. Just as he got in to his\r\nroom after putting his team away, his phone would ring and Mrs. Crocks\r\nwould ask him about the patient he had been to see. She did not always\r\ncall him, of course, but he felt she knew where he had been. There was\r\nno explanation--it was a gift!\r\n\r\nPearl had been rather a favorite with Mrs. Crocks when the Watsons\r\nfamily lived in Millford, but since they had gone to the farm and\r\nprosperity had come to them as evidenced by their better clothes,\r\ntheir enlarged house, their happier faces, and more particularly\r\nPearl's success in her school work in the city, all of which had\r\nappeared in the local paper, for the editor was enthusiastic for his\r\nown town--Mrs. Crock's friendly attitude had suffered a change. She\r\ncould put up with almost anything in her friends, but success!\r\n\r\nBut when she met Pearl on the street that day, her manner was\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\n\"Hello stranger,\" she said, \"I hear you have been doing big things\r\ndown there in the city, winnin' debates and makin' speeches. Good for\r\nyou, Pearl--I always said you were a smart girl, even when your people\r\nwere as poor as get-out. I could see it in you--but don't let it spoil\r\nyou, Pearl--and don't ever forget you are just a country girl. But I\r\nam certainly glad you did so well--for your mother's sake--many a time\r\nI was dead sorry for her having to work so hard! It's a comfort to her\r\nnow to see you doin' so well. Where have been now? I saw you comin'\r\nout of the doctor's office just now--anybody sick? You're not looking\r\nas pert as usual yourself--you haven't been powdering' your face, I\r\nhope! No one sick, eh? Just a friendly call then, was it? See here,\r\nPearl--when I was young, girls did not do the chasin', we let the men\r\ndo that, and I'm here to tell you it's the best way. And look here,\r\nthere's enough girls after Doctor Clay without you--there was a man\r\nfrom the city telling Bertie at the stable that he seen our doctor in\r\na box at the Opera with the Senator's daughter two weeks ago, and that\r\nshe is fair dippy about him, and now that he is thinking of goin'\r\ninto politics, it would be a great chance for him. The other side are\r\ndetermined to make him run for them against old Steadman, and the old\r\nlady is that mad she won't let his name be mentioned in the house. She\r\nsays the country owes it to Mr. Steadman to put him in by acclamation!\r\nAnd the doctor hasn't accepted it yet. The committee went to see\r\nhim yesterday and he turned them down but they won't take no for an\r\nanswer, and they asked him to think it over--I suppose he told you all\r\nabout it--\"\r\n\r\nFor the first time Mrs. Crocks stopped for breath. Her beady eyes were\r\nglistening for excitement. Here was a scoop--if Pearl would only tell\r\nher. She would be able to anticipate the doctor's answer.\r\n\r\n\"What is he goin' to do, Pearl, I know he would tell you; I have\r\nalways said that doctor thinks more of you than he does of any of the\r\nother girls! What did he say about it, will he take it?\"\r\n\r\nPearl was quite herself now--composed, on her guard, even smiling.\r\n\r\n\"I think the doctor would prefer to make his own announcement,\" she\r\nsaid, \"and he will make it to the committee.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Crocks' eyes narrowed darkly, and she breathed heavily in her\r\nexcitement. Did Pearl Watson mean to tell her in as many words, to\r\nmind her own business. But in Pearl's face there was no guile, and she\r\nwas going on her way.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be in a hurry, Pearl,\" said Mrs. Crocks, \"can't you wait a\r\nminute and talk to an old friend. I am sure I do not care a pin\r\nwhether the doctor runs or not. I never was one to think that women\r\nshould concern themselves with politics--that surely belongs to the\r\nmen. I have been a home body all my life, as you know, and of course I\r\nshould have known that the doctor would not discuss his business with\r\na little chit like you--but dear, me, he is one terrible flirt, he\r\ncannot pass a pretty face. Of course now he will settle down no doubt,\r\nevery one thinks he will anyway, and marry Miss Keith of Hampton--the\r\nKeith's have plenty of money, though I don't believe that counts as\r\nmuch with the doctor as family, and of course they have the blue\r\nblood too, and her father being the Senator will help. What! must you\r\ngo--you're not half as sociable as you used to be when you brought the\r\nmilk every morning to the back door--you sure could talk then,\r\nand tell some of the weirdest things. I always knew you would be\r\nsomething, but if you freeze up like a clam when you meet old\r\nfriends--it does not seem as if education has improved you. Can't you\r\nstay and talk a minute?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could stay,\" said Pearl, \"and I can still talk, but I have not been\r\nable to talk to you. You see I do not like to interrupt any one so\r\nmuch older than myself!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl walked away, Mrs. Crocks looked after her with a look of\r\nuncertainty on her face. Pearl's words rang in her ears!\r\n\r\n\"She's smart, that kid--she's smart--I'll say that for her. There is\r\nnot a man in town who dare look me in the eye and take a rise like\r\nthat out of me, but she did it without a flicker. So I know I had her\r\nmad or she wouldn't have said it, but wasn't she smooth about it?\"\r\n\r\nThen her professional pride asserted itself, reminding her that a\r\nslight had been put upon her, and her mood changed.\r\n\r\n\"Of all the saucy little jades,\" she said to herself--\"with the air of\r\na duchess, and the fine clothes of her! And to think that her mother\r\nwashed for me not so long ago, and that girl came for the clothes and\r\nbrought them back again! And now listen to her! You put your foot in\r\nit, Pearl my young lady, when you rubbed Jane Crocks the wrong way,\r\nfor people cannot do that and get away with it! And remember I am\r\ntelling you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl left Mrs. Crocks standing on the street she walked quickly\r\nto the station, but arriving there with the yellow blank in her hand,\r\nshe found her intention of accepting a school in the North had grown\r\nweak and pale. She did not want to go to North, or any place. She\r\nsuddenly wanted to stay. She would take a school some place near--and\r\nsee what was going to happen; and besides--she suddenly thought of\r\nthis--she must not decide on anything until she saw Mr. Donald, her\r\nold teacher, and got his advice. It would not be courteous to do\r\nanything until she saw him, and tomorrow was the day he wanted her to\r\ngo to the school to speak to the children. Why, of course, she could\r\nnot go---and so Pearl reasoned in that well-known human way of backing\r\nherself up in the thing she wanted to do! So she tore off a couple of\r\nblank forms and put them in her purse, and asked the agent if he knew\r\nhow the train from the East was, and he gave her the assurance that it\r\nhad left the city on time and was whoopin' it along through the hills\r\nat Cardinal when last heard from--and stood a good chance of getting\r\nin before night.\r\n\r\nAll the way home, Pearl tried to solve the tangle of thoughts that\r\npresented themselves to her, but the unknown quantity, the \"X\" in this\r\nhuman equation, had given her so little to work on, that it seemed\r\nas though she must mark it \"insufficient data\" and let it go! But\r\nunfortunately for Pearl's peace of mind it could not be dismissed in\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\nOne thing was evident--it was some sudden happening or suggestion that\r\nhad changed his attitude towards her, for there was no mistaking the\r\ntenderness in his messages over the phone the day before--and why did\r\nhe remember the day at all, if it were only to tell her that she\r\nwas too young to really know her own mind. The change--whatever it\r\nwas--had taken place in the interval of his phoning, and her visit,\r\nand Mrs. Crocks had said that a committee had gone to see him and\r\noffer him the nomination! What difference would that make? The subtle\r\nsuggestion of the senator's daughter came back to her mind! Was it\r\npossible--that the Watson family were--what she had once read of in an\r\nEnglish story--'socially impossible.' Pearl remembered the phrase. The\r\nthought struck her with such an impact that she pulled her horse up\r\nwith a jerk, and stood on the road in deep abstraction.\r\n\r\nShe remembered the quarrel she had once had with a girl at school. It\r\nall came back in a flash of rage that lit up this forgotten corner of\r\nher memory! The cause of the quarrel did not appear in the record, but\r\nthat the girl had flung it at her that her people were nothing and\r\nnobody--her mother a washerwoman and her father a section hand--now\r\nstood out in letters of flame! Pearl had not been angry at the\r\ntime--and she remembered that her only reason for taking out the\r\nmiserable little shrimp and washing her face in the snow was that\r\nshe knew the girl had said this to be very mean, and with the pretty\r\ncertain hope that it would cut deep! She was a sorrel-topped, anaemic,\r\nscrawny little thing, who ate slate-pencils and chewed paper, and she\r\nhad gone crying to the teacher with the story of Pearl's violence\r\nagainst her.\r\n\r\nMr. Donald had found out the cause, and had spoken so nicely to Pearl\r\nabout it, that her heart was greatly lifted as a result, and the\r\nincident became a pleasant recollection, with only the delightful\r\npart remaining, until this moment. Mr. Donald had said that Pearl was\r\nsurely a lucky girl, when the worst thing that could be said to her\r\nwas that her two parents had been engaged in useful and honorable\r\nwork--and he had made this the topic for a lesson that afternoon in\r\nshowing how all work is necessary and all honorable. Out of the lesson\r\nhad grown a game which they often played on Friday afternoons, when a\r\nfamiliar object was selected and all the pupils required to write\r\ndown the names of all the workers who had been needed to bring it to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nAnd the next day when lunch time came, Mr. Donald told them he had\r\nbeen thinking about the incident, and how all that we enjoy in life\r\ncomes to us from our fellow-workers, and he was going to have a new\r\ngrace, giving the thanks to where it belonged. He said God was not the\r\nkind of a Creator who wanted all the glory of the whole world--for he\r\nknew that every man and woman or boy or girl that worked, was entitled\r\nto praise, and he liked to see them thanked as they deserved.\r\n\r\nA new grace was written on the board, and each day it was repeated by\r\nall the pupils. Pearl remembered that to her it had seemed very grand\r\nand stately and majestic, with the dignity and thrill of a pipe-organ:\r\n\r\n\"Give us to know, O God, that the blessings we are about to enjoy\r\nhave come to us through the labors of others. Strengthen the ties of\r\nbrotherhood and grant that each of us may do our share of the world's\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\nBut the aesthetic emotions which it sent through her young soul the\r\nfirst time she said it, did not in any way interfere with the sweet\r\nsatisfaction she had in leaning across the aisle and wrinkling up her\r\nnose at her former adversary!\r\n\r\nShe began to wonder now if Mr. Donald had been right in his idealistic\r\nway of looking at life and labor. She had always thought so until this\r\nminute, and many a thrill of pride had she experienced in thinking of\r\nher parents and their days of struggling. They had been and were, the\r\nreal Empire-builders who subdued the soil and made it serve\r\nhuman needs, enduring hardships and hunger and cold and bitter\r\ndiscouragements, always with heroism and patience. The farm on which\r\nthey now lived, had been abandoned, deserted, given up for a bad job,\r\nand her people had redeemed it, and were making it one of the best\r\nin the country! Every farm in the community was made more valuable\r\nbecause of their efforts. It had seemed to Pearl a real source of\r\nproper pride--that her people had begun with nothing, and were now\r\nmaking a comfortable living, educating their children and making\r\nimprovements each year in their way of living and in the farm itself!\r\nIt seemed that she ought to be proud of them, and she was!\r\n\r\nBut since she had been away, she learned to her surprise that the\r\nworld does not give its crowns to those who serve it best--but to\r\nthose who can make the most people serve them, and she found that\r\nmany people think of work as a disagreeable thing, which if patiently\r\nendured for a while may be evaded ever afterwards, and indeed her\r\nmother had often said that she was determined to give her children an\r\neducation, so they would not need to work as hard as she and their\r\nfather had. Education then seemed to be a way of escape.\r\n\r\nSenator Keith, of Hampton, with his forty sections all rented out, did\r\nnot work. Miss Keith, his daughter, did not work. They did not need to\r\nwork--they had escaped!\r\n\r\nIt was quite a new thought to Pearl, and she pondered it deeply. The\r\ncharge against her family--the slur which could be thrown on them was\r\nnot that of dishonor, dishonesty, immorality or intemperance--none of\r\nthese--but that they had worked at poorly paid, hard jobs, thereby\r\ngiving evidence that they were not capable of getting easier\r\nones. Hard work might not be in itself dishonorable--but it was a\r\nconfession.\r\n\r\nSomething in Pearl's heart cried out at the injustice of this. It was\r\nnot fair! All at once she wanted to talk about it to--some one, to\r\neverybody. It was a mistaken way of looking at life, she thought; the\r\nworld, as God made it, was a great, beautiful place, with enough of\r\neverything to go around. There is enough land--enough coal--enough\r\noil. Enough pleasure and beauty, enough music and fun and good times!\r\nWhat had happened was that some had taken more than their share, and\r\nthat was why others had to go short, and the strange part of it all\r\nwas that the hoggish ones were the exalted ones, to whom many bowed,\r\nand they--some of them--were scornful of the people who were still\r\nworking--though if every one stopped working, the world would soon be\r\nstarving.\r\n\r\n\"It is a good world--just the same,\" said Pearl, as she looked away to\r\nher left, where the Hampton Hills shoved one big blue shoulder into\r\nthe sky-line. \"People do not mean to be hard and cruel to each\r\nother--they do not understand, that's all--they have not thought--they\r\ndo not see.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the farm-houses set back in the snowy fields, came the cheerful\r\nSpring sounds of scolding hens and gabbling ducks, with the occasional\r\nbark of a dog. The sunshine had in it now no tang of cold or\r\nbitterness, for in Pearl's heart there had come a new sense of\r\npower--an exaltation of spirit that almost choked her with happiness.\r\nHer eyes flashed--her hands tingled--her feet were light as air. Out\r\nof the crushing of her hopes, the falling of her house of dreams, had\r\ncome this inexplicable intoxication, which swept her heart with its\r\nbaptism of joy.\r\n\r\nShe threw back her head and looked with rapture into the limitless\r\nblue above her, with something of the vision which came to Elisha's\r\nservant at Dothan when he saw the mountains were filled with the\r\nhorses and the chariots of the Lord!\r\n\r\n\"It is a good world,\" she whispered, \"God made it, Christ lived in\r\nit--and when He went away, He left His Spirit. It can't go wrong\r\nand stay wrong. The only thing that is wrong with it is in people's\r\nhearts, and hearts can be changed by the Grace of God.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden feeling of haste came over her--a new sense of\r\nresponsibility--there were so many things to be done. She roused the\r\nfat pony from his pleasant dream, to a quicker gait, and drove home\r\nwith the strange glamour on her soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nRED ROSES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl rode in to the farmyard, she saw her brother Tommy coming\r\nin great haste across the fields, waving his arms to her with every\r\nevidence of strong excitement. The other children were on their way\r\nhome, too, but it was evident that Thomas had far outrun them. Tommy\r\nhad a tale to tell.\r\n\r\n\"There is going to be real 'doin's' at the school on Friday,\" he\r\ncried, as soon as he was within calling distance of her. \"Mr. Donald\r\nhas asked all the big people, too, and the people from Purple Springs,\r\nand the women are going to bring pies and things, and there will be\r\neats, and you are to make the speech, and then maybe there will be a\r\nfootball match, and you can talk as long as you like, and we are all\r\nto clap our hands when your name is mentioned and then again when you\r\nget up to speak--and it's to be Friday.\"\r\n\r\nTommy told his story all in one breath, and without waiting to get\r\na reply, he made his way hurriedly to the barn where his father and\r\nTeddy were working. There he again told it, with a few trifling\r\nvariations. \"You are all to come, and there will be a letter tomorrow\r\ntelling you all about it, but it is a real big day that is going to be\r\nat school, and all the big people, too, and it is to hear Pearl talk\r\nabout what she saw and heard in the city, and there will be cakes and\r\nstuff to eat and the Tuckers said they would not come and Jimmy said\r\n'Dare you to stay away' and they did not take his dare.\"\r\n\r\nTeddy, in true brotherly fashion, professed some doubts of the success\r\nof the undertaking.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl is all right to talk around home, but gee whiz, I don't believe\r\nshe can stand right up and talk like a preacher, she'll forget what\r\nshe was goin' to say, I couldn't say two words before all those\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Watson went on with the fanning of the wheat. He had stopped the\r\nmill only long enough to hear Tommy's message, and Teddy's brotherly\r\napprehensions, he made no comment. But a close observer would have\r\nnoticed that he worked a little faster, and perhaps held his shoulders\r\na little straighter--they had grown stooped in the long days when he\r\nworked on the section. Although his shoulders had sagged in the long\r\nhard struggle, there had always burned in his heart the hope that\r\nbetter days would come--and now the better days were here. The farm\r\nwas doing well--every year they were able to see that they were making\r\nprogress. The children were all at school, and today--today Pearlie\r\nwas asked to speak to all the people in the neighborhood. Pearlie had\r\nmade a name for herself when she got the chance to get out with other\r\nboys and girls. It was a proud day for John Watson, and his honest\r\nheart did not dissemble the pride he felt in his girl.\r\n\r\nPearl herself had a momentary feeling of fear when she heard the plans\r\nthat were being made. The people she knew would be harder to speak\r\nto than strangers. But the exaltation that had come to her heart was\r\nstill with her, and impelled her to speak. There were things which\r\nshould be said--great matters were before the country. Pearl had\r\nattended many political meetings in the city, and also as many\r\nsessions of the Legislature as she could, and so she knew the\r\nProvincial political situation, and it was one of great interest.\r\n\r\nThe government had been in power for many years and had built up a\r\npolitical machine which they believed to be invincible. They had the\r\ncountry by the throat, and ruled autocratically, scorning the feeble\r\nprotests of the Opposition, who were few in number and weak in debate.\r\nMany a time as Pearl sat in the Ladies' Gallery and listened to the\r\nflood of invective with which the cabinet ministers smothered any\r\nattempt at criticism which the Opposition might make, she had longed\r\nfor a chance to reply. They were so boastful, so overbearing, so\r\nchildishly important, it seemed to her that it would be easy to make\r\nthem look ridiculous, and she often found herself framing replies\r\nfor the Opposition. But of course there was a wide gulf between the\r\npompous gentlemen who lolled and smoked their black cigars in the\r\nmahogany chairs on the redcarpeted floor of the House, and the\r\nbright-eyed little girl who sat on the edge of her seat in the gallery\r\nand looked down upon them.\r\n\r\nShe had been in the gallery the day that a great temperance delegation\r\nhad come and asked that the bar might be abolished, and she had\r\nlistened to every word that had been said. The case against the bar\r\nhad been so well argued, that it seemed to Pearl that the law-makers\r\nmust be moved to put it away forever. She did not know, of course,\r\nthat the liquor interests of the province were the strong supporters\r\nof the Government, and the source of the major portion of their\r\ncampaign funds; that the bars were the rallying places for the\r\npolitical activities of the party, and that to do away with the bars\r\nwould be a blow to the Government, and, as the Premier himself had\r\nonce said, \"No Government is going to commit suicide,\" the chances for\r\nthe success of the delegation were very remote. Pearl did not know\r\nthis, and so she was not prepared for it when the Premier and one of\r\nhis Ministers stoutly defended the bar-room as a social gathering\r\nplace where men might meet and enjoy an innocent and profitable hour.\r\n\r\n\"It is one of our social institutions that you are asking us to\r\ndestroy,\" cried the Minister of Education, \"and I tell you frankly\r\nthat we will not do it. The social instincts distinguish man from the\r\nbrute, and they must be cherished and encouraged. Your request is\r\nnot in the best interests of our people, and as their faithful\r\nrepresentatives who seek to safeguard their interests and their\r\nhighest welfare, we must refuse.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the Government desks were pounded in wild enthusiasm! And Pearl\r\nhad come away with a rage in her heart, the wordless rage of the\r\nhelpless. After that she attended every meeting of the Suffrage\r\nSociety, and her deep interest and devotion to the cause won for her\r\nmany friends among the suffrage women.\r\n\r\nThe news of the proposed meeting in the school brought out many and\r\nvaried comments, when it was received in the homes of the district.\r\nMr. Donald sent to each home a letter in which he invited all the\r\nmembers of each family to be present to \"do honor to one who has\r\nbrought honor to our school and district.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Eben Snider, sister of Mrs. Crocks, a wizened little pod of a\r\nwoman with a face like parchment, dismally prophesied that Pearl\r\nWatson would be clean spoiled with so much notice being taken of her.\r\n\"Put a beggar on horseback,\" she cried, when she read the invitation,\r\n\"and you know where he will ride to! The Watsons are doing too\r\nwell--everything John Watson touches turns to money since he went on\r\nthat farm, and this last splurge for Pearl is just too much. I won't\r\nbe a party to it! It is too much like makin' flesh of one and fowl of\r\nthe other. Mr. Donald always did make too much of a pet of that girl,\r\nand then all those pieces in the paper, they will spoil her, no girl\r\nof her age can stand it--it is only puttin' notions in her head, and\r\nfrom what I can hear, there's too much of that now among women. I\r\nnever had no time to be goin' round makin' speeches and winnin'\r\ndebates, and neither has any other decent woman. It would suit Pearl\r\nbetter to stay at home and help her mother; they say she goes around\r\ntown with her head dressed up like a queen, and Jane says she's as\r\nstiff as pork when a person speaks to her. I'll tell Mr. Donald what I\r\nthink of it.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Steadman home, the news of the meeting had a happier reception,\r\nfor Mr. Steadman, who was the local member of Parliament, was asked\r\nto preside, and as the elections were likely to take place before the\r\nyear was out, he was glad of this chance to address a few remarks to\r\nthe electors. He had been seriously upset ever since he heard that the\r\nyoung doctor was to be offered the nomination for the Liberals. That\r\nwould complicate matters for him, and make it imperative that he\r\nshould lose no opportunity of making himself agreeable to his\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nBefore the news of the meeting was an hour old, Mr. Steadman had begun\r\nto arrange his speech, and determined that he would merely make a few\r\nhappy random extempore remarks, dashed off in that light, easy way\r\nwhich careful preparation can alone insure; and Mrs. Steadman had\r\ndecided that she would wear her purple silk with the gold embroidery,\r\nand make a Prince of Wales cake and a batch of lemon cookies--some of\r\nthem put together with a date paste, and the rest of them just loose,\r\nwith maybe a date or a raisin in the middle.\r\n\r\nMrs. Watson was in a state of nerves bordering on stage fright, from\r\nthe time that Tommy brought home the news, a condition which Pearl did\r\nher best to relieve by assuming a nonchalance which she did not feel,\r\nregarding the proposed speech.\r\n\r\n\"What ever will you talk about, Pearlie, dear,\" her mother cried in\r\nvague alarm; \"and to all them people. I don't think the teacher should\r\nhave asked ye, you could do all right with just the scholars, for any\r\nbit of nonsense would ha' done for them, but you will have to mind\r\nwhat you are sayin' before all the grown people!\"\r\n\r\nPearl soaked the beans for tomorrow's cooking, with an air of\r\nunconcern.\r\n\r\n\"Making a speech is nothing, Ma,\" she said, \"when a person knows how.\r\nI have listened to the cabinet ministers lots of times, and there's\r\nnothing to it. It is just having a good beginning and a fine flourish\r\nat the end, with a verse of poetry and the like of that--it does not\r\nmatter what you say in between. I have heard the Premier speak lots of\r\ntimes, and they go crazy over him and think he is a wonderful speaker.\r\nHe tells how he was once a farmer's boy and wandered happily over the\r\npasture fields in his bare feet, and then how he climbed the ladder\r\nof fame, rung by rung--that is fine stuff, every one likes that; and\r\nwhenever he got stuck he told about the flag of empire that waves\r\nproudly in the breeze and has never known defeat, and the destiny of\r\nthis Canada of ours, and the strangers within our gates who have come\r\nhere to carve out their destiny in this limitless land, and when he\r\nthought it best to make them sniffle a little he told about the sacred\r\nname of mother, and how the tear-drop starts at mention of that dear\r\nname, and that always went big, and when he began to run down a\r\nlittle, he just spoke all the louder, and waved his arms around, and\r\nthe people did not notice there was nothing coming; we used to go over\r\nand listen to the speeches and then make them when the teachers were\r\nnot in the room--it was lots of fun. I know lots of the Premier's\r\nspeeches right off. There is nothing to it, Ma, so don't you be\r\nfrightened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pearl, you take things too light,\" said her mother severely, \"a\r\nperson never knows when you are in earnest, and I am frightened about\r\nyou. You should not feel so careless about makin' speeches, it is\r\nnothing to joke about. I wish you would be for writin' out what you\r\nare goin' to say, and then we could hear you go over it, and some one\r\ncould hold the paper for you and give you the word if you forget--it\r\nwould be the safest way!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Ma,\" said Pearl, \"I'll be making it up now while I peel\r\nthe potatoes.\"\r\n\r\nWhile they were talking there came a knock at the door, and when it\r\nwas opened, there stood Bertie from the livery stable, with a\r\nlong green-wrapped box in his hand, which he gave to Mrs. Watson,\r\nvolunteering without delay, all the information he had regarding it.\r\nBertie never failed to reveal all the truth as he knew it--so, keeping\r\nnothing back, he gave the history of the box so far as he had been\r\nable to gather it.\r\n\r\n\"It's for Pearl--and the doctor sent it out. I don't know why he\r\ndidn't give it to her when she was in, for she was in his office--it's\r\nflowers, for it is marked on it--and they came from Hampton.\"\r\n\r\nBertie would have stayed to see the flowers opened, for he knew that\r\nMrs. Crocks would be much interested to know just what they were, and\r\nwhat Pearl said, and what her mother said--and if there was a note\r\ninside--and all the other good stuff he would be able to gather, but\r\nPearl took them, with an air of unconcern, and thanking Bertie, said\r\nquite carelessly:\r\n\r\n\"Don't wait for an answer, Bertie, I can phone if there is any need,\r\nand I know you are in a hurry--we must not keep you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd before Bertie knew what had happened, he found himself walking\r\naway from the door.\r\n\r\nWhen the roses had been put in water, and each of the children had\r\nbeen given a smell and a feel of the velvety petals, and Mrs. Watson\r\nhad partially recovered from the shock that the sight of flowers in\r\nthe winter, always gave her for they reminded her so of her father's\r\nfuneral, and the broken pillar which the Oddfellows sent; Pearl read\r\nthe card:\r\n\r\n  \"To Pearl--eighteen-going-on-nineteen,\r\n  Hoping that the years will bring her nothing\r\n    but joy.\"\r\n\r\nIt was written on one of the doctor's professional cards, and that was\r\nall. But looking again into the envelope there was a folded note which\r\nshe did not read to the assembled and greatly interested group. When\r\nshe was alone in the little beamed room upstairs, she read it:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Pearl:--I forgot to give you the roses when you were in this\r\nafternoon. Accept them now with my deep affection. You have been a\r\nbright spot in my life, and you will always be that--like a red rose\r\nin a dull room. Your success will always be very dear to me, and my\r\nprophecy is that you will go far. I will always think of you with\r\ndeepest admiration and pride. Ever yours,\r\n\r\n\"HORACE CLAY.\"\r\n\r\nPearl read it twice; then impulsively pressed it to her cheek.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds like good-bye,\" she said, with her lips trembling, \"it\r\nsounds like the last of something. Why won't he tell me? It is not\r\nlike him.\"\r\n\r\nA wither of loneliness went over her face as she clasped the note\r\nbetween her hands.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it is that,\" she said fiercely. \"I won't believe it!\"\r\nMrs. Crocks' words were taunting her; \"the doctor thinks more of blue\r\nblood than he does of money, and if he goes into politics it will mean\r\na lot to him to be related to the senator.\"\r\n\r\nAn overwhelming rage was in Pearl's heart, in spite of her\r\ndetermination not to believe the suggestion; a blind, choking rage--it\r\nwas all so unfair.\r\n\r\n\"My dad is more of a man than Senator Keith,\" she said to herself,\r\n\"for all his fine clothes and his big house. He was nothing but a\r\nheeler for the party, and was made Senator because there was no dirty\r\njob that he would not do to get votes for them. I know how he bought\r\nliquor for the Galicians and brought them in by the car-load to vote,\r\nlike cattle, and that's blue blood, is it? Sure it is--you can see it\r\nin his shot-silk face and his two bad old eyes swollen like oysters!\r\nIf the doctor wants him he can have him, and it's blamed little\r\nfrettin' I'll do!... My dad eats with his knife, does he? All right,\r\nhe bought the knife with honest money, and he earned what's on it too.\r\nAll the dirty money they have would not buy him, or make him do a mean\r\ntrick to any one. I am not ashamed of him--he suits me, and he can go\r\non eating with his knife and wearing his overalls and doing anything\r\nhe wants to do. He suits me!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl went back to the kitchen, her father was taking off his\r\nsmock. Supper was ready, and he and Teddy had just come in. The dust\r\nof the fanning-mill was on his face and his clothes. His unmittened\r\nhands were red and rough, and bore traces of the work he had been\r\ndoing. In his hair were some of the seeds and straws blown out by the\r\nmill. There was nothing very attractive about John Watson, unless it\r\nwas his kindly blue eye and the humorous twist of his mouth, but\r\nin Pearl's heart there was a fierce tenderness for her father, a\r\nprotective love which glorified him in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the news, pa,\" she cried, as she impulsively threw her\r\narms around his neck. \"Did you know that I am going to speak in the\r\nschool, and they are all coming out to hear me. Are you glad, Pa, and\r\ndo you think I can do it?\"\r\n\r\nHer burning cheek was laid close to his, and he patted her shoulder\r\nlovingly.\r\n\r\n\"Do I think you can do it, Pearlie, that I do--you can do whatever you\r\ngo at--I always knew that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pearl, child,\" cried her mother, \"don't be hugging your Pa like that,\r\nand you with your good dress on; don't you see the dust and dirt on\r\nhim--you will ruin your clothes child.\"\r\n\r\nPearl kissed him again, and gave him one more hug, before she said,\r\n\"It is clean dirt, Ma, and it will brush off, and I just couldn't\r\nwait; but sure and it's clean dirt anyway.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is gettin' colder,\" said John Watson, as he hung up his smock\r\nbehind the door, \"our Spring is over for awhile, I think. I saw two\r\ngeese leggin' it back as fast as they could go, and each one scoldin'\r\nthe other one--we'll have a good spell or winter yet, I am afraid, in\r\nspite of our two warm days and all the signs of Spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weather like you is too good to last,\" said Mrs. Watson complacently,\r\n\"I knew it wasn't the Spring, it was too good to last.\"\r\n\r\nPearl went to the window and looked out--already there was a threat of\r\nsnow in the whining wind, and as she watched, a stray flake struck the\r\nwindow in front of her.\r\n\r\n\"It was too good to last,\" she said with a sigh which broke into a sob\r\nin the middle, \"It was too good to be true!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE INNOCENT DISTURBER\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there was any lack of enthusiasm among the parents it had no\r\nreflection in the children's minds, for the Chicken Hill School, after\r\nthe great announcement, simply pulsated with excitement. Country\r\nchildren have capabilities for enjoyment that the city child knows\r\nnothing about, and to the boys and girls at Chicken Hill the prospect\r\nof a program, a speech from Pearl Watson, and a supper--was most\r\nalluring. Preparations were carried on with vigor. Seats were scrubbed\r\nby owners, and many an ancient landmark of ink was lost forever.\r\nFrayed window blinds that had sagged and dropped, and refused to go up\r\nor down, were taken down and rolled and put back neat and even, and\r\nthe scholars warned not to touch them; the stove got a rubbing\r\nwith old newspapers; mousy corners of desks were cleaned out--and\r\nobjectionable slate rags discarded. Blackboards were cleaned and\r\ndecorated with an elaborate maple leaf stencil in green and brown, and\r\na heroic battle cry of \"O Canada, we stand on guard for thee\" executed\r\nin flowing letters, in the middle. Mary Watson was the artist, and\r\nspared no chalk in her undertaking, for each capital ended in\r\nan arrow, and had a blanket of dots which in some cases nearly\r\nobliterated its identity. But the general effect was powerful.\r\n\r\nThe day before, every little girl had her hair in tight braids\r\nsecurely knotted with woollen yarn. Boudoir caps were unknown in the\r\nChicken Hill School, so the bare truth of these preparations were to\r\nbe seen and known of all. Maudie Steadman had her four curls set in\r\nlong rags, fastened up with pins, Mrs. Steadman having devised a new,\r\noriginal way of making Maudie's hair into large, loose \"natural\"\r\ncurls, which were very handsome, and not until this day did Mrs.\r\nSteadman show to the public the method of \"setting.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Donald had placed all details of the entertainment in the hands\r\nof Mary Watson and Maudie Steadman, and no two members of a\r\nHouse-Committee ever worked harder, or took more pleasure in making\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n\"Let's not ask the Pipers--they're dirt poor,\" said Maudie, when they\r\nsat down at noon to make out the list of providers.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, we will,\" said Mary, whose knowledge of the human heart was\r\nmost profound. \"If people are poor, that's all the more reason why\r\nthey would be easily hurt, and it's not nice for us to even know that\r\nthey are poor. We'll ask them, you bet--and Mrs. Piper will bring\r\nsomething. Besides--if we didn't ask them to bake, they wouldn't\r\ncome--and that's the way rows start in a neighborhood. We'll manage it\r\nall right--and if there are any sandwiches left over--we'll send them\r\nto the smaller children, and the Pipers will come in on that. It ain't\r\nso bad to be poor,\" concluded Mary, out of her large experience, \"but\r\nit hurts to have people know it!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl, with her father and mother arrived at the school on the\r\nafternoon of the meeting, it came to her with a shock, how small the\r\nschool was, and how dreary. Surely it had not been so mouse-gray and\r\nshabby as this when she had been there. The paint was worn from the\r\nfloor, the ceiling was smoked and dirty, the desks were rickety and\r\nuneven--the blackboards gray. The same old map of North America hung\r\ntipsily between the blackboards. It had been crooked so long, that it\r\nseemed to be the correct position, and so had escaped the eye of the\r\nHouse-Committee, who had made many improvements for this occasion.\r\n\r\nIn the tiny porch, there were many mysterious baskets and boxes and\r\ntin pails of varying sizes, and within doors a long table at the back\r\nof the room had on it many cups and saucers, with a pile of tissue\r\npaper napkins. A delightful smell of coffee hung on the air.\r\n\r\nPearl wore her best brown silk dress, with a lace collar and cuff set\r\ncontributed the Christmas before by her Aunt Kate from Ontario, and at\r\nher waist, one of the doctor's roses. The others had been brought\r\nover by Mary, and were in a glass jar on the tidy desk, where they\r\nattracted much attention and speculation as to where they had\r\ncome from. They seemed to redeem the bare school-room from utter\r\ndreariness, and Pearl found herself repeating the phrase in the\r\ndoctor's letter, \"Like a rose in a dark room.\"\r\n\r\nThe children were hilariously glad to see Pearl, and her lightness of\r\nheart came back to her, when a group of them gathered around her to\r\nreceive her admiration and praise for their beautifully curled hair,\r\ngood clothes and hair ribbons. Bits of family history were freely\r\ngiven to her too, such as Betty Freeman's confidential report on her\r\nmother's absence, that she dyed her silk waist, and it streaked, and\r\nshe dyed it again--and just as soon as she could get it dry, she would\r\ncome--streaks or no streaks--and would Pearl please not be in a hurry\r\nto begin.\r\n\r\nThen the meeting was called to order, and the smaller children were\r\nset like a row of gaily colored birds around the edge of the platform,\r\nso their elders could sit on their little desks in front, and the\r\nschoolroom was filled to its last foot of space. There were about a\r\ndozen chairs for the older people.\r\n\r\nPearl had gone to the back of the room to speak to the old gardener\r\nfrom Steadman's farm, a shy old man, who just naturally sought the\r\nmost remote corner for his own. Her affectionate greeting brought a\r\nglow into his face, that set Pearl's heart throbbing with joy:\r\n\r\n\"It's good to see you, Pearl,\" he said, \"you look like a rose to me,\r\nand you don't forget an old friend.\"\r\n\r\nPearl held the hard old gnarled hand in her own, and her heart was\r\nfull of joy. The exaltation of the day she rode home was coming\r\nto her. Love was the power that could transform the world. People\r\neverywhere, all sorts of people, craved love and would respond to it.\r\n\"If I can cheer up poor old Bill Murray, and make him look like this,\r\nwith a glisten in his eyes, I'm satisfied,\" she thought.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Donald Pearl looked like a rose, too, a rose of his own\r\ngrowing, and his voice trembled a little when he called the meeting to\r\norder and in his stately way bade everyone welcome.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to hand over the meeting to Mr. Steadman in a moment,\" he\r\nsaid, \"but before I do I wish to say that the Chicken Hill School\r\nis very proud today to welcome one of its former pupils, Miss Pearl\r\nWatson.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the gaily colored company who bordered the platform, burst\r\ninto ecstatic hand clapping, in which the older members joined rather\r\nshamefacedly. Demonstrations come hard to prairie people.\r\n\r\n\"The years she spent in this school were delightful years to me,\" went\r\non Mr. Donald. \"She helped me with the younger children--she helped\r\nme to keep up enthusiasm for the work--she helped me to make life\r\npleasant for all of us--she did more--she helped me to believe that\r\nlife is worth the struggle--she helped me to believe in myself. I was\r\nnot surprised that Pearl made a record in her work in the city; she\r\ncould not fail to do that. She is in love with life--to me, she is the\r\nembodiment of youth, with all its charms and all its promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have wanted to hear her impressions of the city. Nothing, to her,\r\nis common-place--she sees life through a golden mist that softens its\r\nsharp outlines. I am glad that every one could come today and give a\r\nwelcome home to our first graduate from Chicken Hill School!\"\r\n\r\nThis threatened to dislodge the seating arrangement on the platform,\r\nfor in their enthusiastic applause, the Blackburn twins on account\r\nof the shortness of their legs and the vigor of their applause, lost\r\ntheir balance and fell. But they bore it well, and were restored\r\nwithout tears! The excitement was so great that no one of the young\r\nrow would have known it if they had broken a bone!\r\n\r\n\"And now I will ask our local member, Mr. Steadman, to take charge\r\nof the meeting, and give the neighborhood's welcome to our first\r\ngraduate!\"\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Steadman arose! He was a stout man, with a square face, and\r\nsmall, beady black eyes and an aggressive manner; a man who felt sure\r\nof himself; who knew he was the centre of his own circle. There was a\r\nwell-fed, complacent look about him too which left no doubt that he\r\nwas satisfied with things as they were--and would be deeply resentful\r\nof change. There was still in his countenance some trace of his\r\nancestor's belief in the Divine right of kings! It showed in his\r\nnarrow, thought-proof forehead, and a certain indescribable attitude\r\nwhich he held toward others, and which separated him from his\r\nneighbors. Instinctively, the people who met him, knew he lacked human\r\nsympathy and understanding, but he had a hold on the people of his\r\nconstituency, for through his hands went all the Government favors and\r\npatronage. Anyone who wanted a telephone, had to \"see Mr. Steadman.\"\r\nThe young people who went to the city to find employment, were wise to\r\nsee Mr. Steadman before they went. So although he was not liked, he\r\nhad a prestige which was undeniable.\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman began his remarks by saying how glad he was to be offered\r\nthe chair on this glad occasion. He always liked to encourage the\r\nyoung, and he believed it our duty to be very tolerant and encouraging\r\nto youth.\r\n\r\nThe boundaries of the platform began to wriggle. They had heard Mr.\r\nSteadman before--he often came in and made speeches--but he never\r\nbrought any oranges--or peanuts or even \"Farmers' Mixed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Youth is a time of deep impressions,\" went on the chairman; \"wax to\r\nreceive--granite to retain. Youth was the time of learning, and he\r\nhoped every boy and girl in his presence would earnestly apply himself\r\nand herself to their books, for only through much study could success\r\nbe attained. That is what put him where he was today.\"\r\n\r\nMore wriggles, and some discussion at his feet!\r\n\r\nHe was glad to know that one of Mr. Donald's pupils had been able to\r\ndo so well in the city. Three cheers for the country! He had always\r\nbelieved it was the best place to be brought up--and was glad to say\r\nthat he too, had spent his youth on a farm. Most of the successful men\r\nof the world came from the farms.\r\n\r\nHe believed absolutely in education for women, education of a suitable\r\nkind, and believed there was a definite place for women in the\r\nworld--a place which only women could fill. That place was\r\nthe home--the quiet precincts of home--not the hurly-burly of\r\npolitics--that was man's sphere--and a hard sphere it was, as he knew\r\nwell. He didn't wish to see any woman in such a hard life, with its\r\nbitter criticism and abuse. He was sorry to notice that there was a\r\nnew agitation among women in the city--it had come up in the session\r\njust closed--that women wanted to vote.\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman threw out his hands with a gesture of unconcern:\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" I say, \"let them vote--if they want to--let them run the whole\r\ncountry; we'll stay at home. It's time we had a rest, anyway!\"\r\n\r\nA little dry cackle of laughter went over the room at this, in which\r\nMr. Donald did not join--so it got no support from the pupils of\r\nChicken Hill, who faithfully followed their teacher's lead.\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman went on blithely:\r\n\r\n\"I am old fashioned enough to want my wife to stay at home. I like\r\nto find her there when I come home. I don't want her to sit in\r\nParliament; she hasn't time--for one thing.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Steadman sat in front, with the purple plume in her hat nodding\r\nits approval:\r\n\r\n\"And I say it in all kindness to all women--they havn't the ability.\r\nThey have ability of their own, but not that kind. Parliaments are\r\nconcerned with serious, big things. This year, the program before\r\nour Provincial Parliament, is Good Roads. We want every part of this\r\nProvince to enjoy the blessing of of good roads, over which they can\r\nbring their produce to market, binding neighborhoods together in the\r\nties of friendship. Good roads for everyone is our policy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now what do women know about making roads? They are all right to go\r\nvisiting over the roads after they are built, but how much good would\r\nthey be in building them?\"\r\n\r\nThis was greeted with another scattered rattle of laughter, followed\r\nby a silence, which indicated intense listening. Even the restless\r\nedging of the platform knew something was happening, and listened.\r\n\r\n\"Our Opposition is coming forward with a foolish program of fads and\r\nfancies. They want the women to have the vote; they want to banish the\r\nbar! They want direct legislation. These are all radical measures,\r\nnew, untried and dangerous. With women voting, I have no sympathy,\r\nas I said. They are not fitted for it. It is not that I do not love\r\nwomen--I do--I love them too well--most of them.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment here--but no one laughed. The audience did not\r\nbelieve him.\r\n\r\n\"There are some women in the city whom I would gladly send to jail.\r\nThey are upsetting women's minds, and hurting the homes. Don't let us\r\ntake any chances on destroying the home, which is the bulwark of the\r\nnation. What sight is more beautiful then to see a mother, queen of\r\nthe home, gathering her children around her. She can influence\r\nher husband's vote--her son's vote.--she has a wider and stronger\r\ninfluence than if she had the vote to herself. Her very helplessness\r\nis her strength. And besides, I know that the best women, the very\r\nbest women do not want to sit in Parliament. My wife does not want\r\nto--neither did my mother--no true woman wants to, only a few\r\nrattle-brained, mentally unbalanced freaks--who do not know what they\r\nwant.\"\r\n\r\nPearl smiled at this. She had heard this many times.\r\n\r\n\"Now, as to banishing the bar, you all know I am not a drinker. I can\r\ntake it--or leave it--but I am broad minded enough to let other people\r\nhave the same privilege that I ask for myself. Men like to gather in\r\na friendly way, chat over old times or discuss politics, and have a\r\nglass, for the sake of good fellowship, and there's no harm done.\r\nThere are some, of course, who go too far--I am not denying that. But\r\nwhy do they do it? They did not get the right home training--that\r\nis why. In the sacred precincts of home, the child can be taught\r\nanything--that's the mother's part, and it is a more honorable part\r\nthan trying to ape men--and wear the pants.\"\r\n\r\nThis brought a decided laugh--though if Mr. Steadman had been sensible\r\nto thought currents, he would have felt twinges in his joints,\r\nindicating that a storm was brewing. But he was having what the\r\npreachers call a \"good time,\" and went merrily on.\r\n\r\n\"Direct legislation is a dangerous thing, which would upset\r\nrepresentative government. It is nothing less than rabble rule,\r\nletting the ignorant rabble say what we are to do. Our vote is too\r\nwide now, as you know, when every Tom, Dick and Harry has a vote,\r\nwhether they own an inch of ground or not. Your hired man can kill\r\nyour vote, though you own a township of land. Do you want to give him\r\nmore power? I think not! Well if the opposition ever get in power, the\r\nwomen and the hired men, and even the foreigners will run the country,\r\nand it will not be fit to live in. We're doing all right now, our\r\npublic buildings, our institutions are the best in Canada. We have\r\nput the flag on every schoolhouse in the country--we have good,\r\nsane, steady government, let us stick to it. I believe that the next\r\nelection will see the good ship come safely into port with the same\r\nold skipper on the bridge, and the flag of empire proudly furling its\r\nfolds in the breeze. We have no fears of the fads and fancies put\r\nforward by short-haired women and long-haired men.\"\r\n\r\nThat being the end of his speech, the place where his superior always\r\nsat down, amidst thunderous applause. Mr. Steadman sat down, too,\r\nforgetting that he had been asked to be the Chairman, and introduce\r\nPearl.\r\n\r\nThe applause which followed his remarks, was not so vociferous as he\r\nhad expected, partly because there were no \"Especially instructed\r\nclappers.\" No one was very enthusiastic, except Mrs. Steadman, who\r\napparently agreed with all he said.\r\n\r\nRising to his feet again he said: \"The good ladies have bountifully\r\nprovided for our needs today--what would we do without the ladies? but\r\nbefore we come to that very interesting item on our program, we are\r\ngoing to hear from Pearl Watson. Pearl Watson is one of the girls who\r\nhas taken full advantage of our splendid educational system, than\r\nwhich there is none better in Canada--or in the world. As a member of\r\nthe Legislature, I am justly proud of our Department of Education, and\r\ntoday we will be entertained by one of our own products, Pearl Watson,\r\non whom we might well hang the label 'Made in Canada.' I do not know\r\nwhether she intends to say a piece--or what, but bespeak for her a\r\nrespectful and courteous hearing.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman sat down, adjusting his gold and blue tie, and removed\r\nhis glasses, which he put away in a large leather case that closed\r\nwith a snap. His attitude indicated that the real business of the day\r\nwas over, now that he had spoken.\r\n\r\nPearl came forward and stepped to the platform, displacing temporarily\r\none of the twins, to make a space where she might step. Having\r\nrestored him safely, she turned to the people. There was a smile in\r\nher eyes that was contagious. The whole roomful of people smiled back\r\nat her, and in that moment she established friendly relations with her\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n\"It has been a real surprise to me,\" she began, in a conversational\r\ntone, \"to hear Mr. Steadman make a speech. I am sure his colleagues in\r\nthe House would have been surprised to have heard him today. He is a\r\nvery quiet man there--he never speaks. The first night I went to the\r\nHouse with a crowd of Normalites, I pointed out our member, to let\r\nthose city girls see what we could raise in the country--but it seems\r\nthe speeches are all made by half a dozen, the others just say 'Aye'\r\nwhen they're told. All on one side of the House say 'Aye'; the other\r\nside say 'No.' I have heard Mr. Steadman say 'Aye,' lots of times--but\r\nnothing more. The Premier, or one of the Cabinet Ministers tells them\r\nwhen to say it--it all looks very easy to me. I would have thought\r\neven a woman could do it. The girls used to tease me about how quiet\r\nmy representative was. He sat so still that it just seemed as if he\r\nmight be asleep, and one girl said she believed he was dead. But one\r\nday, a window was left open behind him--and he sneezed, and then he\r\ngot right up and shut it--Do you remember that day, Mr. Steadman?\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head impatiently, and the expression of his face was not\r\npleasant. Still, no one would attribute anything but the friendliest\r\nmotive to Pearl's innocent words.\r\n\r\n\"My! I was glad that day,\" she said, \"when you sneezed, it was a quick\r\nstop to the rumor--I tell you--and I never heard any more about it.\r\nI am sorry Mr. Steadman is not in favor of women voting, or going to\r\nParliament, and thinks it too hard for them. It does not look hard to\r\nme. Most of the members just sit and smoke all the time, and read the\r\npapers, and call the pages. I have seen women do far harder work than\r\nthis. But of course what Mr. Steadman says about building roads all\r\nover the country, is a new one on me. I did not know that the members\r\nwere thinking of doing the work! But I guess they would be glad to get\r\nout and do something after sitting there all cramped up with their\r\nfeet asleep for the whole winter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still, I remember when Mr. Steadman was Councillor here, and there\r\nwas a bridge built over Pine Creek--he only let the contract--he did\r\nnot build it--it was his brother who built it!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a queer thrill in the audience at this, for Bill Steadman\r\nhad got the contract, in spite of the fact that he was the poorest\r\nbuilder in the country--and the bridge had collapsed inside of two\r\nyears. George Steadman winced at her words.\r\n\r\nBut Pearl, apparently innocent of all this, went on in her guileless\r\nway:\r\n\r\n\"I think Mr. Steadman is mistaken about women not wanting to sit in\r\nParliament. He perhaps does not know what it feels like to stand over\r\na wash-tub--or an ironing board--or cook over a hot stove. Women who\r\nhave been doing these things long would be glad to sit anywhere!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a laugh at this, in which Mr. Steadman made a heroic attempt\r\nto join, shaking his head as he did so, to counteract any evil effect\r\nwhich the laugh might cause.\r\n\r\n\"But I did not intend to speak of politics,\" said Pearl, \"I intended\r\nto tell you how glad I am to be back to Chicken Hill School, and how\r\ngood home looks to me. No one knows how to appreciate their home until\r\nthey have left it--and gone away where no one cares particularly\r\nwhether you are sick or well--happy or miserable. Do you boys find it\r\npretty hard to wash your necks--and you wish your mother hadn't such a\r\nsharp eye on you--be glad you have some one who thinks enough of you\r\nto want your neck to be clean. You hate to fill the wood-box, do you?\r\nO, I know what a bottomless pit it is--and how the old stove just\r\nloves to burn wood to spite you. But listen! By having to do what you\r\ndo not want to do, you are strengthening the muscles of your soul--and\r\ngetting ready for a big job.\r\n\r\n\"Having to do things is what makes us able to do more. Did you ever\r\nwonder why you cannot walk on water. It is because water is so\r\nagreeable--it won't resist you. It lets you have your own way.\r\n\r\n\"The teachers at the Normal talked to us every Friday afternoon, about\r\nour social duties, and rural leadership and community spirit and lots\r\nof things. They told us not to spend our time out of school tatting\r\nand making eyelet embroidery, when there were neighborhoods to be\r\nawakened and citizens to be made. That suits me fine, for I can't tat\r\nanyway. One of the girls tried to show me, but gave it up after three\r\nor four tries. She said some could learn, and some couldn't. It was\r\nheredity--or something.\r\n\r\n\"Anyway, Dr. McLean said teachers were people who got special training\r\nfor their work, and it was up to them to work at it, in school and\r\nout. He said that when we went out to teach, we could be a sort of\r\nsocial cement, binding together all the different units into one\r\ncoherent community, for that's what was needed in Canada, with its\r\nvaried population. One third of the people in Canada do not speak\r\nEnglish, and that's a bad barrier--and can only be overcome by\r\nkindness. We must make our foreign people want to learn our language,\r\nand they won't want to, unless they like us.\r\n\r\n\"He said Canada was like a great sand-pile, each little grain of sand,\r\nbeautiful in its own way, but needing cement to bind it to other\r\ngrains and it was for us to say whether we would be content to be only\r\na sand pile, or would we make ourselves a beautiful temple.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could give it all to you--it was great to hear him. He said\r\nno matter how fine we were as individuals, or how well we did our\r\nwork, unless we had it in our hearts to work with others, and for\r\nothers--it was no good. If we lacked social consciousness, our work\r\nwould not amount to much. I thought of our old crumply horn cow. She\r\nalways gave a big pail of milk--but if she was in bad humor, she would\r\nquite likely kick it over, just as the pail was full. I used to think\r\nmaybe a fly had stung her, but I guess what was really wrong was\r\nthat she lacked social consciousness. She did not see that we were\r\ndepending on her.\r\n\r\n\"That's why the liquor traffic is such a bad thing, and should be\r\noutlawed. Individuals may be able to drink, and get away with it, but\r\nsome go under, some homes are made very unhappy over it. If we have\r\nthis social consciousness, we will see very clearly that the liquor\r\ntraffic must go! No matter how much some people will miss it. If it\r\nisn't safe for everybody, it isn't safe for anybody. I used to wish\r\nDr. McLean could talk to the members of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"He told us one of the reasons that the world had so many sore spots in\r\nit was because women had kept too close at home, they were beginning\r\nto see that in order to keep their houses clean, they would have to\r\nclean up the streets, and it was this social consciousness working in\r\nthem, that made them ask for the vote. They want to do their share,\r\noutside as well as in.\r\n\r\n\"There was a woman who came and talked to us one day at the Normal. She\r\nis the editor of the Women's section of one of the papers, and she put\r\nit up to us strong, that there was work for each of us. We had to make\r\na report of her address, and so I remember most of it.\r\n\r\n\"She said that Canada is like a great big, beautiful house that has\r\nbeen given to us to finish. It is just far enough on so that you can\r\nsee how fine it is going to be--but the windows are not in--the\r\ndoors are not hung--the cornices are not put on. It needs polishing,\r\nscraping, finishing. That is our work. Every tree we plant, every\r\nflower we grow, every clean field we cultivate, every good cow or hog\r\nwe raise, we are helping to finish and furnish the house and make it\r\nfit to live in. Every kind word we say or even think, every gracious\r\ndeed, if it is only thinking to bring out the neighbor's mail from\r\ntown, helps to add those little touches which distinguish a house from\r\na barn.\r\n\r\n\"We have many foreign people in this country, lonesome, homesick\r\npeople--sometimes we complain that they are not loyal to us--and that\r\nis true. It is also true that they have no great reason to be loyal\r\nto us. We are not even polite to them, to say nothing of being kind.\r\nLoyalty cannot be rammed down any ones' throat with a flag-pole.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman cleared his throat at this--and seemed about to\r\nspeak--but she went on without noticing:\r\n\r\n\"Loyalty is a gentle growth, which springs in the heart. The seeds\r\nare in your hands and mine; the heart of our foreign people is the\r\nsoil--the time of planting is now--and the man or woman who by\r\ntheir kindness, their hospitality, their fair dealing, honesty,\r\nneighborliness, makes one of the least of these think well of Canada,\r\nis a Master Builder in this Empire.\r\n\r\n\"If we do not set ourselves to finish the house, you know what will\r\nhappen to it. I remembered this part of her speech because it made me\r\nthink about our school-house the year before Mr. Donald came--when\r\nwe could not get a teacher. Do you remember? Windows were broken\r\nmysteriously--the rain beat in and warped and drenched and spoiled the\r\nfloors. The chimney fell. Destruction always comes to the empty house,\r\nshe said--the unfinished house is a mark for the wantonly mischievous.\r\nTo keep what we have, we must improve it from year to year. And to\r\nthat end we must work together--fighting not with each other--but with\r\nconditions, discouragements, ignorance, prejudice, narrowness--we must\r\nbe ready to serve, not thinking of what we can get from our country,\r\nbut what we can give to it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the silence that fell, the people sat motionless. They did not\r\nnotice that Pearl was done speaking--for their thoughts went on--she\r\nhad given them a new view of the service they might give.\r\n\r\nMrs. Piper, on whose heart, Pearl's words had fallen like a\r\nbenediction, saw that in making her rag-carpet, over which she had\r\nworked so hard--she was helping to furnish one little corner of her\r\ncountry, for it would make her front room a brighter place, and there\r\nher children, and the boys and girls of the neighborhood would have\r\ngood times and pleasant memories. She had thought of it in a vague way\r\nbefore, but Pearl had put it into words for her--and her heart was\r\nfilled with a new rapture. It was worth while to work and struggle and\r\ntry her best to make a pleasant home. There was a purpose in it all--a\r\nplan--a pattern.\r\n\r\nEven Mrs. Thompson had a glimmering of a thought regarding her\r\nprecious flowers, the slips of which she never gave away. With them\r\nshe could gladden the hearts of some of her neighbors, and Noah\r\nThompson, her husband, who made it his boast that he never borrowed or\r\nlent, became suddenly sorry he had refused a neck yoke to his Russian\r\nneighbor.\r\n\r\nGeorge Steadman, too, found his soul adrift on a wide sea, torn\r\naway from the harbor that had seemed so safe and land-locked, so\r\nunassailable; and on that wider sea there came the glimpses of a\r\nsunrise, of a new day. It puzzled him, frightened him, angered him.\r\nIn the newness of it all, he detected danger. It blew across his\r\nsheltered soul like a draught, an uncomfortable, cold-producing\r\ndraught--and when he found himself applauding with the others, he\r\nknew that something dangerous, radical, subtle and evil had been let\r\nloose--the girl would have to be watched. She was a fire-brand, an\r\nincendiary--she would put notions in peoples' heads. It was well he\r\nhad heard her and could sound the warning. But he must be politic--he\r\nwould not show his hand. The children were singing, and every one had\r\nrisen. Never before had he heard the Chicken Hill people sing like\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n  \"O Canada, our home, our native land,\r\n  True, patriot love, in all our sons command;\r\n  With glowing hearts we see thee rise,\r\n  Thou true land, strong and free,\r\n  And stand on guard, O Canada\r\n  We stand on guard for thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe children began the second verse, the people following lamely, for\r\nthey did not know the words; but the children, proud of their superior\r\nknowledge, and with a glow in their impressionable little hearts, sang\r\nexultantly--this song of home and country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF INK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chicken Hill correspondent of the Millford \"Mercury\" described the\r\nmeeting in the school as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The Chicken Hill School was the scene of a happy gathering on Friday\r\nafternoon last, when the neighbors and friends gathered to welcome\r\nhome Pearl Watson, who has just completed a successful First Class\r\nTeacher's Normal course in Winnipeg. Pearl is a great favorite, and\r\ncertainly disappointed no one, for she gave an address on present day\r\nquestions which will not soon be forgotten. Pearl is an out and out\r\nbeliever in temperance and woman suffrage, and before she was through,\r\nshe had every one with her--as one man put it, he'd like to see\r\nthe woman vote, if for nothing else than to get Pearl Watson into\r\nparliament, for there would sure be hides on the barn door if she ever\r\ngot there, and a rustling of dry bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"After Pearl's address, the ladies of the district served\r\nrefreshments, and a good time was spent. Pearl's arm must have ached,\r\nshaking hands, and if she could be spoiled with praise, she would be\r\nspoiled for sure, but Pearl is not that kind. It is rumored that she\r\nwill be offered the Purple Springs school, and if she accepts, we\r\ncongratulate Purple Springs.\"\r\n\r\nWhen George Steadman read the Chicken Hills news, his face became a\r\nyellowish gray color--much like the hue of badly laundried clothes.\r\nHis skin prickled, as if with an electric current, for hot rage ate\r\ninto his soul. His name was not even mentioned. He wasn't there at\r\nall--and he was the member for Millford. Of all the silly rot--well,\r\nhe'd see about it.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, with the offending sheet in his hand, Mr. Steadman\r\nmade his way to the \"Mercury\" office, a dingy, little flat-roofed\r\nbuilding, plastered with old circus posters outside, and filled with\r\nevery sort of junk inside. At an unpainted desk piled high with\r\npapers, sat the editor. His hair stood up like a freshly laundried,\r\ndustless mop; his shirt was dirty; his pipe hung listlessly in his\r\nmouth--upside down, and a three days' crop of black beard peppered his\r\nface. He looked like a man who in early youth had slept on newspapers\r\nand drank ink, and who now would put his feet on the table if there\r\nhad been room, but there was scarcely room for them on the floor, for\r\nit was under the table that he kept his exchanges. There were shelves\r\naround the walls, but they were filled with rubber boots, guns,\r\nbaskets of letters, a few books, miscellaneous articles of clothing\r\nand some empty tobacco jars.\r\n\r\nSo on account of the congested condition on and under the table, Mr.\r\nDriggs was forced to sit in an uncomfortable position, with his legs\r\nand those of the table artistically entwined.\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman began, without replying to the editor's friendly\r\ngreeting:\r\n\r\n\"Who writes this balderdash from our district,\" he asked harshly.\r\n\r\n\"Professional secret,\" replied Mr. Driggs, speaking through his shut\r\nteeth, for he did not wish to dislodge his pipe; the last time he let\r\nit out of his mouth he had had no end of a time finding it. \"Never\r\ngive away names of contributors, not etiquette.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't care a hang for your etiquette--I want to know. The member\r\nfor Millford was not in a trifling mood.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" said Mr. Driggs, holding his pipe still closer.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Driggs,\" said Mr. Steadman haughtily, \"do you know who\r\nyou're talking to--I have it in my power to throw you a good deal of\r\nbusiness one way'n another--I've thrown you a good deal of business.\r\nThere's an election coming on--there will be bills, cards, streamers,\r\nwhat not; good money in printing for the Government--do you savvy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I savvy,\" said Mr. Driggs cheerfully.\r\n\r\n\"Well then\"--George Steadman was sure now he was going to get the\r\ninformation--\"who writes this this stuff from Chicken Hill?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said the editor calmly, \"honest, I don't. This was a\r\nnew one--strange writing--and all that. I called up Pearl Watson to\r\nsee if there had been a meeting, and she verified it, but didn't tell\r\nme anything. She said you presided. Then I ran the item--I thought it\r\nwas very good--what's wrong with it? It seemed like real good country\r\ncorrespondence to me--with that bucolic freshness which we expect to\r\nfind in country contributors, perhaps not the literary polish found in\r\nStoddarts' lectures, but rattling good stuff just the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here Driggs,\" the other man interrupted, \"listen to me. There's\r\nan election coming on--you've always been with us--I don't know what\r\nyou think--and it don't matter. This girl Watson is against us--and\r\nshe's as smart as they make them, and has plenty of nerve. Now I don't\r\nwant to see that girl's name in the paper again. A few more spreads\r\nlike this--and every district in the country will want her. She don't\r\nknow her place--she's got nerve enough to speak anywhere. She spits\r\nout things, hardly knowing what she means--she's dangerous, I tell\r\nyou. If the other side got hold of her and primed her what to say, she\r\ncould do us a lot of harm--here, for mind you, she's got a way with\r\nher. We don't want any trouble. There's a little talk of runnin' Doc.\r\nClay, but I believe he's got more sense than to try it. The last man\r\nthat ran against me lost his deposit. But, understand, Driggs, no\r\nmention of this girl, cut out her name.\"\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Driggs slowly took his pipe from his mouth, and laid it\r\ncarefully on the lowest pile of papers. It's position did not entirely\r\nsuit him, and he moved it to another resting place. But the effect was\r\nnot pleasing even then--so he placed it in his pocket, taking a red\r\nhandkerchief from his other pocket, and laying it carefully over the\r\nelusive pipe, to anchor it--if that were possible.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Steadman,\" he said, in his gentlest manner, \"sit down.\"\r\n\r\nRemoving an armful of sale bills from the other chair, he shoved it\r\nover to his visitor, who ignored the invitation.\r\n\r\n\"You must not attempt to muzzel the press, or take away our\r\nblood-bought liberties. Blood-bought liberties is good! It's a serious\r\nmatter to come to a natural born, heaven inspired Editor, and tell\r\nhim to curb his news instinct. Pearl Watson is a particular friend of\r\nmine. Pearl's sayings and doings are of interest to me as a citizen,\r\ntherefore, I reason they are of interest to all citizens. She is a\r\nyoung lady of great charm, who does honor to our little town. I stand\r\nabsolutely for home boosting. Shop at home--shop early--sell your\r\nhammer and buy a horn--my motto! Pearl Watson--one of the best ads we\r\nhave--I'm for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Mr. Steadman harshly, \"you defy me then, and when\r\nyou defy me, you defy the Government of the Province, the arm of the\r\nGovernment reaches far--Driggs, and you know that before you are done,\r\nI'll put you out of business before two weeks have gone by. You owe\r\nevery one--you owe the paper people--you owe on your printing press.\r\nYour creditors are all friends of the Government. All I have to do is\r\nto say the word and they'll close you out. The Government will put a\r\nman in here who has sense enough to do as he is told.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Driggs' faced showed more concern than he had exhibited before.\r\nThere were certain bills he owed--forgotten to be sure in normal\r\ntimes--but now they came up blinking to the light, rudely disinterred\r\nby Mr. Steadman's hard words. They had grown, too, since their last\r\nappearance, both in size and numbers--and for a moment a shade of\r\nannoyance went over his face. Details of business always did annoy\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nBut an inner voice cautioned him to be discreet. There was always a\r\nway around a difficulty. Mr. Driggs believed in the switch system\r\nwhich prevails in our railroading. When two trains run towards each\r\nother on a track one must go off on a switch, to avoid a collision. It\r\ndoes not take long and when the other train has gone roaring past, the\r\nswitched train can back up and get on the track and go serenely on--he\r\nresolved to be tactful.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Steadman,\" he said, \"I am surprised at all this. Pearl is only a\r\nslip of a girl. What harm can she do you? You are absolutely solid in\r\nthis neighborhood. The government has this country by the throat--the\r\nold machine works perfectly. What are you afraid of?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're not afraid--what have we to be afraid of? We have only sixteen\r\nopposition members in the House--and they're poor fish. We're solid\r\nenough--only we don't want trouble. The women are getting all stirred\r\nup and full of big notions. We can hold them down all right--for they\r\ncan't get the vote until we give it to them--that's the beauty of it.\r\nThe Old Man certainly talked plain when they came there askin' for the\r\nvote. He just laid them out. But I can see this girl has been at their\r\nmeetings--and women are queer. My women, even, thought there was a lot\r\nof truth in what the Watson girl said. So there was--but we're not\r\ndealing with truth just now--politics is not a matter of truth. We\r\nwant to get this election over without trouble. We want no grief over\r\nthis, mind you--everything quiet--and sure. So you got your orders\r\nright now. Take them or leave them. But you know where your bread is\r\nbuttered, I guess.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman went out of the office, shutting the door with a strong\r\nhand. The editor buried his face in his hands and gently massaged his\r\ntemples with his long-ink-stained fingers, and to all appearance, his\r\nsoul was grieved within him. It seemed as though his proud spirit was\r\nchafing at the bonds which the iniquitous patronage system had laid on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFor brief period he sat thus, but when he raised his head, which he\r\ndid suddenly, there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face\r\nwhich spread and widened until it burst into a laugh which threatened\r\nto dislodge the contents of the table. He threw himself back in his\r\nswing chair and piled both feet on the table, even if there was no\r\nroom for them--if ever there had come a time in his history when he\r\nwas in the mood to put his feet on the table, that time was now.\r\n\r\nHe addressed his remarks to his late guests:\r\n\r\n\"You fragrant old he-goat, you will give orders to me, will you--you\r\nare sure some diplomat--you poor old moth-eaten gander, with your\r\ncow-like duplicity.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Driggs could not find the figure of speech which just suited the\r\ncase, but he was still trying.\r\n\r\n\"You poor old wall-eyed ostrich, with your head in the sand, thinking\r\nno one can see you, you forget that there is a portion of your anatomy\r\nadmirably placed--indeed in my mind's eye I can see the sign upon it.\r\nIt reads 'Kick me.' It is an invitation I will not decline. He thinks\r\nhe can wipe our good friend Pearlie off the map by having her name\r\ndropped from the Millford 'Mercury,' forgetting that there are other\r\nways of reaching the public eye. There are other publications, perhaps\r\nnot in the class with the Millford 'Mercury,' but worthy little sheets\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\n\"There is the 'Evening Echo,' struggling along with a circulation of\r\na quarter of a million--it will answer our purpose admirably. I will\r\nwrite the lead today while the lamp of inspiration burns, and I will\r\nhear Pearl speak, and then oh, beloved, I will roll up my sleeves\r\nand spit on my hands and do a sketch of the New Woman--Pearlie, my\r\nchild--this way lies fame.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE DOCTOR'S DECISION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl left him so abruptly, Dr. Clay found himself battling\r\nwith many emotions. His first impulse was to call her back--tell her\r\neverything. Pearl was not a child--she would know what was best. It\r\nwas not fair to deceive her, and that was just what he had done, with\r\nthe best intentions.\r\n\r\nBut something held him back. The very heart of him was sick and full\r\nof bitterness at the sudden slap which fate had given him. His soul\r\nwas still stinging with the pain of it. Everything was distorted and\r\nqueer, and in the confusion of sensations the outstanding one was the\r\ninstinct to hide all knowledge of his condition. No one must know. He\r\nwould go to see the old doctor and swear him to secrecy. After all,\r\nhis life was his own--he was under obligation to no one to stretch it\r\nout miserably and uselessly.\r\n\r\nHe would go on as long as he could, and live it out triumphantly.\r\nHe would go out like Old Prince. He thought of the hymn which gives\r\nthanks to God, \"Who kindly lengthens out our days,\" and the thought\r\nof it was mingled with something like scorn. He did not want any\r\nlengthening out of his time if there could not be real power, real\r\nservice in each day. He would live while he lived, and die when he\r\nhad to, and with that resolution he tried to get back his calmness of\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nLooking at himself in the glass, he had to admit his face was haggard,\r\nand thinner than it had been, and he knew he had lost weight. Still,\r\nthat could be recovered--he was not going to worry or think about\r\nhimself. He had always contended that disease was ninety per cent.\r\nimagination and ten per cent. reality, and now he was going to see.\r\nEvery one is under the death sentence; the day is set for each man. \"I\r\nam no worse off,\" he thought, \"than I was before--if I could only see\r\nit that way--and I will--I am going to be the Captain of my soul--even\r\nthough it may be for a very short cruise--no disease or whimpering\r\nweakness will usurp my place--'Gladly I lived--gladly I died. And I\r\nlaid me down with a will,'\" he quoted, but his mouth twisted a little\r\non the words. Life was too sweet. He loved it too well to lay it down\r\ngladly. O no, there could be no pretence of gladness.\r\n\r\nHe found himself thinking of Pearl, and the tender, loving, caressing\r\nlight in her eyes, her impulsive kiss--her honest words of heavenly\r\nsweetness; what a girl she was! He had watched her grow from a little\r\nbright-eyed thing, who always interested him with her wisdom, her\r\ncheerfulness, her devotion to her family, until now, when she had\r\ngrown to be a serious-minded, beautiful girl, with a manner full of\r\nrepose, dignity, grace--a wonderfully attractive girl--who looked\r\nhonestly into his eyes and told him she loved him, and he had had to\r\nturn away from his happiness and tell her it could not be. And he had\r\nseen the dimming of those shining eyes and the tightening of her lips.\r\nHe had had to hurt Pearl, and that was the bitterest thought of all.\r\n\r\nAgain the temptation came to tell her! But the stern voice of\r\nconscience cried out to him that if she knew she would consider\r\nherself bound to him, and would not take her liberty, and the finest\r\nyears of her young life would be spent in anxiety and care.\r\n\r\n\"I might live to be an old man,\" he said bitterly. \"If I were sure I\r\ncould drop out soon, it would not matter so much. Pearl would still\r\nhave her life ahead of her, and I would come to be but a memory, but\r\nas it is--there's but one straight and honorable course--and I will\r\ntake it.\"\r\n\r\nThen he thought of the roses, and wrote a card and a note, and called\r\nBertie at the Livery Stable to come to the office. When Bertie\r\narrived, much out of breath, the doctor charged him to be quick in his\r\nerrand of delivering them. Bertie was anxious to talk, and volunteered\r\nthe information that Pearl Watson was an awful pretty girl, but Mrs.\r\nCrocks had just met her on the street and been talkin' to her a little\r\nwhile, and she thought Pearl was gettin' pretty stuck up.\r\n\r\n\"Bertie, dear,\" the doctor said, not unkindly, \"did any one ever tell\r\nyou that you talk too easy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure they did,\" said Bertie honestly, \"but Mrs. Crocks likes me to\r\ntalk.\"\r\n\r\n\"O well,\" the doctor smiled, \"you and Mrs. Crocks are not really\r\ndangerous--but Bertie, remember this, silence does not often get any\r\none into trouble, and if you are ever in doubt about whether to tell\r\nthings or not--don't tell them! It's the best way--now, will you try\r\nto remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Bertie pleasantly.\r\n\r\nAll of which Bertie carefully hid in his heart, but his object in so\r\ndoing was not to attain the scriptural sequence--\"that he sin not\r\nwith his mouth,\" It was that he might rehearse it accurately to Mrs.\r\nCrocks!\r\n\r\nThe doctor had forgotten all about the committee who were going to\r\nwait on him that evening to receive his decision regarding the coming\r\nelection. His mind had been too full of his own affairs. But promptly\r\nat eight o'clock, his office bell rang, and the gentlemen came in.\r\n\r\nIt seemed years to the doctor since he had seen them. Life had so\r\nchanged for him in the interval. The committee had come back with\r\ngreater enthusiasm than ever. Corroborative evidence had been pouring\r\nin; the doctor was the only man who could defeat the present member.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor, it is sure up to you,\" said the President, a stocky man,\r\nwhose face had a patchy beard resembling a buffalo-robe on which the\r\nmoths had played their funny tricks, \"and I'll tell you why. The women\r\nare beginning to raise hell all over the country. They have societies\r\nnow, and they're holding debates, and getting up plays--and all that.\r\nThey have the Government scared. My stars, I remember the time women\r\ndidn't bother no more about politics than a yellow dog does about\r\nreligion. But that good day is gone. They're up and comin' now, and\r\ncomin' with a whoop. Now, that's why we want you,--at least it's one\r\nreason--the women like you--you have a way with them--you listen to\r\nthem--and feel sorry over their aches and pains--cure them--if you\r\ncan--but the big thing is--you feel sorry. Now, if you will run, the\r\nwomen will try to make their men vote for you--I don't think any one\r\nof the women will go against you. The men here are mostly for the\r\nGovernment, and this year they have the bridge at Purple Springs for\r\na bait. It's goin' on for sure--work for every one--that votes right.\r\nThe Government has been in so long, you've just had to be on their\r\nside to hold your job--they have their fingers on everything. You know\r\nour candidate has lost his deposit for three elections--but there's a\r\nchance this year--if you'll run.\"\r\n\r\nThen the field organizer took up the argument. He was a young man sent\r\nout from the city office to rally the faithful and if possible see\r\nthat the best candidates were selected. He was a shop-worn young man,\r\nwithout illusions. He knew life from every angle, and it was a dull\r\naffair in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Politics is a game of wits,\" he said; \"the smartest one wins, and\r\ngets in and divides the slush money. The other side howl--because they\r\ndidn't get any. We're sore now because we haven't had a look-in\r\nfor fourteen years--we're thirsty and dry--and we long for the\r\nwater-brooks--which is, government jobs. There's just one distinction\r\nbetween the parties,\" he said, \"one is in and one is out! That's all.\r\nBoth parties have the same platform too, there is only one principle\r\ninvolved, that is the principle of re-election. But it really seems as\r\nif our time is coming.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Mr. Summersad lighted a cigarette and blew billows of smoke at\r\nthe ceiling. His whole bearing was that of a man who had drunk the cup\r\nof life to the very dregs and found even the dregs tasteless and pale.\r\n\r\n\"You are pessimistic,\" said the doctor, \"you surely take a\r\nmaterialistic view of the case. Is it really only a matter of getting\r\nin to the public treasury? That hardly seems worth a man's effort; it\r\nlooks more like a burglar's job.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, Clay,\" said the organizer, with slightly more animation, \"the\r\npolitical game is not a game of sentiment or of high resolves. One man\r\ncannot do much to change the sentiment of a whole province; we must\r\ntake things as we find them. People get as good government as they\r\ndeserve--always. This year the advantage comes to us. 'It is time for\r\na change' is always a good rallying cry, and will help us more than\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the opposition platform this year,\" said the doctor, \"what\r\nwould I have to believe? Haven't you decided on a program, some sort\r\nof course of action?\"\r\n\r\n\"O sure,\" replied the other, \"we have a great platform--woman\r\nsuffrage--banish the bar--direct legislation--we have a radical\r\nplatform--just the very thing to catch the people. I tell you\r\neverything is in our favor, and with your popularity here, it should\r\nbe a cinch.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor looked at him, without enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"But the platform needn't worry you,\" he hastened to explain, \"it's\r\nnot necessarily important--it's a darn good thing to get in on--but\r\nafter that--\"\r\n\r\n\"It can be laid away,\" said the doctor, \"for another election. Well\r\nnow, as I understand it, the case against the present Government is\r\njust that. They promised prohibition years ago, and got in on that\r\npromise--but broke it joyously, and canned the one man who wanted to\r\nstand for it--that's why they deserve defeat and have deserved it all\r\nthese years. But if the Opposition have the same ethics, what's the\r\nuse of changing. Better keep the robbers in we know, than fly to\r\nothers that we know not of.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the organizer had been speaking, the remainder of the committee\r\nwere vaguely uncomfortable. He was not getting anywhere; he was\r\nspoiling everything. They knew the doctor better than he did.\r\n\r\nThe doctor stood up, and there was something about the action which\r\nannounced the adjournment of the meeting.\r\n\r\n\"It does not appeal to me,\" he said, \"not as outlined by you. It's\r\ntoo sodden, too deeply selfish. I see no reason for any man who has a\r\nfairly decent, self-respecting job, to give it up and devote his time\r\nto politics, if you have given me a correct picture of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe organizer became deeply in earnest:--\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Clay,\" he said, \"don't be hasty. I'm telling you the truth\r\nabout things, that's all. You can be as full of moral passion as\r\nyou like--the fuller the better. The Opposition can always be the\r\nSimon-pure reformers. I'm not discouraging you--in fact, we want you\r\nto be that.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor interrupted him, impatiently:--\r\n\r\n\"But I must not expect anything to come of it. Moral reform--and all\r\nthat--is fine for election dope, but governments have no concern with\r\nit, these promises would not be carried out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not saying what we mean,\" said Mr. Summersad, with abundant\r\ncaution; \"I say we want to defeat the Government--that's our business.\r\nWe want to get in--further than that we have no concern. The new\r\nPremier will set our policy. But if you ask me my opinion, I do not\r\nmind telling you that I don't think any government of men are very\r\nkeen on letting the women vote--why should they be? But there's always\r\na way out. What will happen is this--if our fellows get in, they will\r\ngrant a plebiscite, men only voting of course, and it will go strong\r\nagainst the women--but that will let us out.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor's eyes snapped:--\r\n\r\n\"That's surely a coward's way out,\" he said, \"and why should any woman\r\nhave to ask for what is her right. Women, although they are not so\r\nstrong as men, do more than half the work, and bear children besides,\r\nand yet men have been mean enough to snatch the power away from them\r\nand keep it. Well, you have certainly been frank, Mr. Summersad, I\r\nmust thank you for that. I will be equally frank. I do not see\r\nthat there is anything to choose between the two parties. If your\r\npresentation of the case is correct, the country is in a bad way, and\r\nthe political life is a re-incarnation of that fine old game of 'pussy\r\nwants a corner!' I never did see much in it, so I will decline\r\nthe nomination. I am sorry, Mr. Gilchrist,\" he said to the local\r\nPresident. His words had a ring of finality.\r\n\r\nWhen the committee were leaving they met Miss Keith, of Hampton, on\r\nthe street. Miss Keith was worth looking at, with her white fox furs,\r\nhigh-heeled shoes and long black ear-rings. Miss Keith carried a muff\r\nas big as a sheaf of wheat, and a sparkling bead-bag dangled from her\r\nwrist. Miss Keith's complexion left nothing to be desired. When she\r\npassed the committee there came to them the odor of wood violets. The\r\ncommittee were sufficiently interested to break into a group on the\r\ncorner and so be able to turn around and watch her, without appearing\r\nto stop for that purpose.\r\n\r\nShe went into the doctor's office.\r\n\r\n\"By gum,\" said the President, looking at the door through which she\r\nhad disappeared, \"don't these women beat all? They go where they\r\nlike--they do as they like--they wear what they like--they don't care\r\nwhat men think, any more. They're bold--that's what they are! and I\r\ndon't know as I believe in lettin' them vote--By Gosh!\"\r\n\r\nThe organizer raised his hand in warning, and spoke sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Hold your tongue,\" he said, \"they're a long way from votin'. Believe\r\nwhat you like--no one cares what you believe--but sit tight on it! I\r\ntalked too much just now. Let's learn our lesson.\"\r\n\r\nBertie, whose other name was now lost in oblivion, and who was known\r\nas \"Bertie Crocks\" for purposes of identification, standing at the\r\ncorner of the \"Horse Repository,\" saw Miss Keith entering the doctor's\r\noffice, and wondered again how any one ever thought a small town dull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN WITH A SORE THOUGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turning of a key; the opening of a door, are commonplace sounds to\r\nmost of us; but to a prisoner, weary of his cell, they are sounds of\r\nunspeakable rapture. The dripping of a tap, may have in it the element\r\nof annoyance--if we have to get up and shut it off before we can get\r\nto sleep, but a thirsty traveller on the burning sands of the desert,\r\nwould be wild with joy to hear it. All which is another way of saying\r\nthat everything in life is relative.\r\n\r\nOn the day that Pearl spoke in the school-house, there sat in one of\r\nthe seats listening to her, a sombre-faced woman, who rarely came to\r\nany of the neighborhood gatherings. The women of the neighborhood,\r\nhaving only the primary hypothesis of human conduct, said she was\r\n\"proud.\" She did not join heartily in their conversations when they\r\nmet her, and had an aloofness about her which could only be explained\r\nthat way. She had a certain daintiness about her, too, in her way of\r\ndressing--even in the way she did her hair--and in her walk, which\r\nmade the women say with certain resentment, that Mrs. Paine would like\r\nto be \"dressy.\"\r\n\r\nBut if Mrs. Paine had any such ambitions, they were not likely to be\r\nachieved, for although she and her husband had lived for years in this\r\nfavored district, and had had good crops, Sylvester Paine was known\r\nall over the country as a hard man. The women would have liked Mrs.\r\nPaine much better if she had talked more, and complained about\r\nhim--she was too close-mouthed they said. They freely told each other,\r\nand told her, of their hopes, fears, trials and triumphs--but Mrs.\r\nPaine's communications were yea and nay when the conversation was on\r\npersonal matters, and she had a way of closing her lips which somehow\r\nprevented questions.\r\n\r\nBut on the day when Pearl spoke in the school Mrs. Paine's face\r\nunderwent a change which would have interested a student of human\r\nnature. Something which had been long dead, came to life again that\r\nday; fluttering, trembling, shrinking. In her eyes there came again\r\nthe dead hopes of the years, and it made her face almost pitiful in\r\nits trembling eagerness. There was a dull red rage in her eyes too\r\nthat day, that was not good to see, and she was determined that it\r\nshould not be seen, and for that reason, she slipped away when Pearl\r\nwas through, leaving some excuse about having the chores to do. She\r\ncould not bear to speak to the women and have them read her face; she\r\nknew it would tell too much. But she must talk to Pearl. There were\r\nthings that Pearl could tell her.\r\n\r\nThat night she called Pearl on the phone. The other receivers came\r\ndown quickly, and various homely household sounds mingled in her\r\nears--a sewing-machine's soft purring in one house--a child's cry in\r\nanother--the musical whine of a cream separator in a third. She knew\r\nthey were all listening, but she did not care. Even if she could not\r\ncontrol her face, she could control her voice.\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl came to the phone, Mrs. Paine invited her to come over for\r\nsupper the next night, to which Pearl gave ready acceptance--and that\r\nwas all. The interested listeners were disappointed with the brevity\r\nof the conversation, and spoke guardedly and in cipher to each other\r\nafter Pearl and Mrs. Paine had gone: \"Somebody is away, see! That's\r\nwhy! Gee! some life--never any one asked over only at such times--Gee!\r\nHow'd you like to be bossed around like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"She did not begin right--too mealy-mouthed. Did you hear what he's\r\ngoing to buy? No! I'll tell you when I see you--we've too big an\r\naudience right now. Don't it beat all, the time some people have to\r\nlisten in--\"\r\n\r\n\"O well, I don't care! Anything I say I'm ready to back up. I don't\r\npretend I forget or try to twist out of things.\"\r\n\r\nOne receiver went up here, and the sound of the sewing-machine went\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThen the conversation drifted pleasantly to a new and quicker way of\r\nmaking bread that had just come out in the \"Western Home Monthly.\"\r\n\r\nThe next evening Pearl walked over the Plover Slough to see Mrs.\r\nPaine. She noticed the quantity of machinery which stood in the yard,\r\nsome under cover of the big shingled shed, and some of it sitting out\r\nin the snow, gray and weather-beaten. The yard was littered, untidy,\r\nprodigal, wasteful--every sort of machine had evidently been bought\r\nand used for a while, then discarded. But within doors there was a\r\nbareness that struck Pearl's heart with pity. The entrance at the\r\nfront of the house was banked high with snow, and evidently had not\r\nbeen used all winter, and indeed there seemed no good reason for its\r\never being used, for the front part of the house, consisting of hall,\r\nfront room opening into a bed-room, were unfurnished and unheated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine was genuinely, eagerly glad to see Pearl, and there was a\r\ntense look in her eyes, an underglow of excitement, a trembling of her\r\nhands, as she set the table, that did not escape Pearl.\r\n\r\nBut nothing was said until the children had gone to bed, and then Mrs.\r\nPaine departed from her life-long habit of silence, and revealed to\r\nPearl the burdens that were crushing her.\r\n\r\nShe was a thin woman, with a transparency about her that gave her the\r\nappearance of being brittle. Her auburn hair curled over her white\r\nforehead, and snakily twisted around her ivory white ears. Her eyes\r\nwere amber-brown, with queer yellow lights that rose and fell as\r\nshe talked, and in some strange way reminded Pearl of a piece of\r\nbird's-eye maple. She was dressed in the style of twenty years before,\r\nwith her linen collar inside the high collar of her dress, which was\r\nfastened with a bar pin, straight and plain like herself. In the\r\ncentre of the pin was a cairn-gorm, which reflected the slumbering\r\nyellow light in her eyes. The color of her face was creamy white, like\r\nfine stationery.\r\n\r\n\"I thought all my hopes were dead, Pearl,\" she said with dry lips,\r\n\"until you spoke, and then I saw myself years ago, when I came out of\r\nschool. Life was as rosy and promising, and the future as bright to me\r\nthen as it is to you now. But I got married young--we were brought up\r\nto think if we did not get married--we were rather disgraced, and in\r\nour little town in Ontario, men were scarce--they had all come West.\r\nSo when I got a chance, I took it.\"\r\n\r\nPearl could see what a beautiful young girl she must have been, when\r\nthe fires of youth burned in her eye--with her brilliant coloring\r\nand her graceful ways. But now her face had something dead about\r\nit, something missing--like a beautifully-tiled fireplace with its\r\npolished brass fittings, on whose grate lie only the embers of a fire\r\nlong dead.\r\n\r\nPearl thought of this as she watched her. Mrs. Paine, in her\r\nagitation, pleated her muslin apron into a fan.\r\n\r\nThe tea-kettle on the stove bubbled drowsily, and there was no sound\r\nin the house but the purring of the big cat that lay on Pearl's knee.\r\n\r\n\"Life is a funny proposition, Pearl,\" continued Mrs. Paine, \"I often\r\nthink it is a conspiracy against women. We are weaker, smaller than\r\nmen--we have all the weaknesses and diseases they have--and then some\r\nof our own. Marriage is a form of bondage--long-term slavery--for\r\nwomen.\"\r\n\r\nPearl regarded her hostess with astonished eyes. She had always known\r\nthat Mrs. Paine did not look happy; but such words as these came as a\r\nshock to her romantic young heart.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't the hard work--or the pain--it isn't that--it's the\r\nuselessness of it all. Nature is so cruel, and careless. See how many\r\nseeds die--nature does not care--some will grow--the others do not\r\nmatter!\"\r\n\r\n\"O you're wrong, Mrs. Paine,\" Pearl cried eagerly; \"it is not true\r\nthat even a sparrow can fall to the ground and God not know it.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine seemed about to speak, but checked her words. Pearl's\r\nbright face, her hopefulness, her youth, her unshaken faith in God and\r\nthe world, restrained her. Let the child keep her faith!\r\n\r\n\"There is something I want to ask you, Pearl,\" she said, after a long\r\npause. \"You know the laws of this Province are different from what\r\nthey are in Ontario.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice fell, and the light in her eyes seemed to burn low, like\r\nnight-light, turned down.\r\n\r\n\"He says,\" she did not call her husband by name, but Pearl knew who\r\nwas meant, \"he says that a man can sell all his property here without\r\nhis wife's signature, and do what he likes with the money. He wants to\r\nsell the farm and buy the hotel at Millford. I won't consent, but he\r\ntells me he can take the children away from me, and I would have to go\r\nwith him then. He says this is a man's country, and men can do as they\r\nlike. I wonder if you know what the law is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure,\" said Pearl. \"I've heard the women talking about it,\r\nbut I will find out. I will write to them. If that is the law it will\r\nbe changed--any one could see that it is not fair. Lots of these old\r\nlaws get written down and no one bothers about them--and they just\r\nstay there, forgotten--but any one would see that was not fair, 'Men\r\nwould not be as unjust as that'!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know them\", said Mrs. Paine; \"I have no faith in men.\r\nThey've made the world, and they've made it to suit themselves. My\r\nhusband takes his family cares as lightly as a tomcat. The children\r\nannoy him.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke in jerky sentences, often moistening her dry lips, and there\r\nwas something in her eyes which made Pearl afraid--the very air of the\r\nroom seemed charged with discords. Pearl struggled to free her heart\r\nfrom the depressing influence.\r\n\r\n\"All men are not selfish,\" she said, \"and I guess God has done the\r\nbest He could to be fair to every one. It's some job to make millions\r\nof people and satisfy them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Creator should take some responsibility,\" Mrs. Paine\r\ninterrupted, \"none of us asked to be born--I'm not God, but I take\r\nresponsibility for my children. I did not want them, but now they are\r\nhere I'll stand by them. That's why I've stayed as long as this. But\r\nGod does not stand by me.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was colorless and limp like a washed ribbon. It had in it no\r\nanger, just a settled conviction.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Mrs. Paine,\" began Pearl, \"you've been too long alone in\r\nthe house. You begin to imagine things. You work too hard, and never\r\ngo out, and that would make an archangel cross. You've just got to mix\r\nup more with the rest of us. Things are not half so black as they look\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could stand it all--until he said he could take away my home,\" the\r\nwords seemed to come painfully. \"I worked for this,\" she said, \"and\r\nthough it's small and mean--it's home. Every bit of furniture in this\r\nhouse I bought with my butter money. The only trees we have I planted.\r\nI sowed the flowers and dug the place to put them. While he is away\r\nbuying cattle and shipping them, and making plenty of money--all for\r\nhimself--I stay here and run the farm. I milk, and churn, and cook for\r\nhired men, and manage the whole place, and I've made it pay too, but\r\nhe has everything in his own name. Now he says he can sell it and take\r\nthe money.... Even a cat will fight and scratch for its hay-loft.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh well,\" said Pearl, \"I hope you won't have to fight. Fighting is\r\nbad work. It's a last resort when everything else fails. Mr. Paine can\r\nbe persuaded out of the hotel business if you go at it right. He does\r\nnot understand, that's all. That's what causes all the misery and\r\ntrouble in life--it is lack of understanding.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine smiled grimly: \"It's good to be young, Pearl,\" she said.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she spoke again: \"I did not ask you over entirely for\r\nselfish reasons. I wanted to talk to you about yourself; I wanted to\r\nwarn you, Pearl.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about!\" Pearl exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get married,\" she said; \"Oh don't, Pearl, I can't bear to think\r\nof you being tied down with children and hard work. It's too big a\r\nrisk, Pearl, don't do it. We need you to help the rest of us. When I\r\nlistened to you the other day I came nearer praying than I have for\r\nmany years. I said, 'Oh, Lord, save Pearl,' and what I meant was that\r\nHe should save you from marriage. You'll have lots of offers.\"\r\n\r\n\"None so far,\" laughed Pearl, \"not a sign of one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you'll get plenty--but don't do it, Pearl. We need you to talk\r\nfor us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, couldn't I talk if I were married?\" asked Pearl, \"I have heard\r\nmarried women talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the same; they haven't the heart. People cannot talk if their\r\nown hearts are sore. That's why we want to keep you light-hearted and\r\ncarefree. I wish you would promise me, Pearl, that you won't marry.\"\r\n\r\nPearl hesitated, hardly knowing how to meet this.\r\n\r\n\"That's asking a lot, Mrs. Paine. Every girl hopes to marry some\r\ntime,\" she said, at last, and if the light had been better Mrs. Paine\r\nwould have seen the color rising in Pearl's cheeks; \"And you are wrong\r\nin thinking that all men are mean and selfish. My father is not. We've\r\nbeen poor and all that, but we're happy. My father has never shirked\r\nhis share of the work, and he has only one thought now, and that is to\r\ndo well for us. There are plenty of happy marriages. I--can't promise\r\nnot to but there's no danger yet--I have no notion of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Pearl,\" said Mrs. Paine, \"keep away from it. Some way I\r\ncan't bear to think of you tied down with a bunch of kids, and all\r\nyour bright ways dulled with hard work and worry. Well, anyway, you'll\r\ntalk about it--about the vote I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the time,\" Pearl laughingly responded. \"Wherever two or three\r\ngather Pearl Watson will rise and make a few remarks unless some one\r\nforcibly restrains her. I will promise that--that's easy.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl walked home that night the moon was trying to shine through\r\na gray rag of a cloud that was wrapped around its face. The snow on\r\nthe road caught the muffled rays of light, and she could see her way\r\nquite well after her eyes grew accustomed to the darkness. There was\r\na close, protecting feeling about the gray darkness that suited her\r\nmood. It was a comfortable, companionable night, with a soft air full\r\nof pleasant sounds of dogs barking, and sleigh-bells, and with the\r\nlights in the neighbors' houses for company. Pearl was not conscious\r\nof fear. All her life she had gone about in the night as fearlessly as\r\nby day.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine's words troubled her. Was it possible life could be as dull\r\nand drab a thing as it seemed to her. Perhaps, though, she had never\r\nbeen in love! She had married because she did not want to be an old\r\nmaid. Only love can redeem life from its common-place monotony. Maybe\r\nthat was why things had gone wrong.\r\n\r\nShe thought about Mrs. Paine's words about being tied down with\r\nchildren and hard work, and how she had pleaded with her to be warned!\r\nPearl tried to make the warning real and effective--tried to harden\r\nher heart and fill it with ambitions, in which love and marriage had\r\nno place. She tried to tell herself it was her duty to never marry;\r\nshe would be free to work for other women. She tried to think of a\r\nfuture apart from marriage, apart from the hopes and dreams that had\r\nbeen so dear and sweet. Could it be that she was being called of God\r\nto be a leader in a new crusade against injustice? Was it her part to\r\nspeak for other women? Since the day she spoke in the school there\r\nhad been a glowing wonder in her heart which told her she could move\r\npeople to higher thinking and nobler action. She had seen it in their\r\neyes that day. She had seen the high resolve in their faces, seen it,\r\nand been glad and fearful too. Was it possible that God was calling\r\nher to declare a message to the people, and could it be that it was\r\nfor this reason her sweet dreams had been so suddenly broken?\r\n\r\nPearl stopped in the road in her agitation of spirit, as the\r\npossibility of this surged over her. Every sound seemed to have died\r\naway, not a dog barked or a tree creaked in the gray darkness which\r\nshrouded the world. Even the lights in the houses seemed to hold a\r\nsteady gleam, without as much as winking an eye--waiting for her\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nThe whole world seemed to be holding its breath expectantly, in a\r\nwaiting, quivering silence. It was as if her name had been called; the\r\ncurtain had rolled up, and a great audience waited.\r\n\r\nA sudden, helpless feeling set her heart beating painfully into her\r\nthroat, a smothering sense of fear, quite new to her, who had never\r\nknown fear.\r\n\r\n\"I can't do it!\" broke from her, in a cry; \"Don't ask me, Lord, I\r\ncan't! I can't do it alone--but give me the desire of my heart, oh,\r\nLord, and I will never tremble or turn back or be afraid. I will\r\ndeclare the truth before kings!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nENGAGED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trustees of Purple Springs School had reached the climax of their\r\nprofessional duties. They were about to appoint a teacher, and being\r\nconscientious men, anxious to drive a good bargain for the people,\r\nthey were proceeding with deep caution to \"look around.\"\r\n\r\nLooking at the modest equipment of Purple Springs School, the observer\r\nwould wonder why such stress was laid on the teacher's qualifications.\r\nThe schoolhouse was a bleak little structure of wood, from whose walls\r\nthe winds and rain had taken the paint. It was set in an arid field,\r\nthat knew no tree or flower. Its three uncurtained windows threw a\r\nmerciless light on the gray floor and smoked walls.\r\n\r\nFormer teachers had tried to stir the community to beautify the\r\ngrounds and make the inside more homelike, but their efforts had been\r\nfitful and without result. Trees died, seeds remained in the ground,\r\nand gray monotony reigned at Purple Springs. Still, the three trustees\r\nbelieved it was an enviable position they had in their hands to\r\nbestow, and were determined that it should not be given lightly.\r\n\r\nJust at the time that they were hard engaged in \"lookin' 'round,\" the\r\nsecretary's wife came back from a visit to Chicken Hill, and told\r\nabout Pearl Watson, who had been to the city and come back \"quite a\r\ngirl,\" able to talk, and just as nice and friendly as ever. Mrs. Cowan\r\nwas not well read in the political situation of the day, and so did\r\nnot know that Pearl had been guilty of heretical utterances against\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nIf this had been known to the trustees her candidature would not have\r\nbeen considered, for all of the trustees were supporters and believers\r\nin the Government--and with reason. Mr. Cowan had a telephone line\r\nbuilt expressly for him; Mr. Brownlees had been given a ditch--just\r\nwhere he wanted it, digging it himself, and been paid for it by the\r\nGovernment; the third trustee had been made game warden, at a monthly\r\nsalary and no duties; so naturally they would like not to hear their\r\nfriends criticized. Mrs. Cowan only read newspapers to see the\r\nbargains, crotchet patterns, and murders, and after that, she believed\r\ntheir only use was to be put on pantry shelves. So her account of\r\nPearl's address was entirely without political bias.\r\n\r\n\"She's a fine looking girl,\" said Mrs. Cowan, \"and it's nice to hear\r\nher talk, even if she isn't saying anything. She's brown-eyed, tall,\r\nand speaks out plain so every one can hear, and what she says is not\r\ntoo deep--and you'd never know she was educated, to hear her talk.\"\r\n\r\nThe three trustees resolved to look into the case. Being masters of\r\nduplicity, they decided to call on Miss Watson at her home, and to go\r\nin the early morning hours, believing that the misty light of 8 a.m.\r\nwill reveal many things which the glare of high noon might hide. They\r\nwould see first would she be up? They had once had a teacher who lay\r\nin bed the whole day on Saturday. Would she have her hair combed? They\r\nwere not keen on artistic effects in the school buildings, but were a\r\nunit on wanting a tastefully dressed teacher. It was decided that the\r\ncall would be early and unannounced.\r\n\r\nThey found Pearl in a pink and white checked gingham house dress, with\r\nher brown hair done up in the style known as a French roll, sewing\r\nat a machine in the front room, and at once Mr. Cowan, who was the\r\ndominant spirit of the party signalled to the others--\"So far so\r\ngood.\" Miss Watson, even though the hour was early, was up, dressed\r\nneatly--and at work. All of this was in the glance which Mr. Cowan\r\nshot over to his colleagues.\r\n\r\nInvestigating still further, for Mr. Cowan knew the value of detail in\r\nestimating human character; the general arrangement of the room won\r\nhis approval. It was comfortable, settled, serene--it looked like\r\nhome--it invited the visitor to come in and be at rest. A fire burned\r\nin the heater, a bird sang in the kitchen, a cat lay on the lounge and\r\ndid not move when he sat down beside it, showing that its right of way\r\nhad not been disputed. Mr. Cowan saw it all.\r\n\r\nAfter the introductions were over, Mr. Cowan put forth some questions\r\nabout her qualifications, and at each answer, his colleagues were\r\ngiven to understand by a faint twitter of his eyes that Miss Watson\r\nwas still doing well.\r\n\r\n\"You're young of course,\" said Mr. Cowan, with the air of a man who\r\nfaces facts--but his natural generosity of spirit prompted him to add\r\n\"but you'll get over that, and anyway a girl is older in her ways than\r\na boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"We measure time by heart-beats,\" said Pearl, as she handed him a\r\nflowered cushion to put behind his head, \"not by figures on a dial.\"\r\n\r\nShe tossed it off easily, as if poetry were the language of every day\r\nlife to her.\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan shut one eye for the briefest space of time, and across the\r\nroom his two friends knew Miss Watson's chances were growing brighter\r\nevery minute. \"My wife happened to be down at Chicken Hill the day you\r\nspoke, and she said you sure did speak well, for a girl, and she\r\nwas hopin' you'd speak at our school some night--and we could get a\r\nphonograph to liven things up a bit--I guess we're broad-minded enough\r\nto listen to a woman.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan's confidence in his companions was amply justified. They\r\nnodded their heads approvingly, like men who are willing to try\r\nanything once.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see,\" Mr. Cowan went on, \"we have a nice district, Miss\r\nWatson. We're farmer people, of course, with the exception of the few\r\nwho live at the station; we're farmers but we're decent people--and\r\nwe're pretty well-to-do farmers--we have only one woman in the\r\ndistrict--that we sort of wish wasn't there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" asked Pearl quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Well you see, she got in first, so to speak. She bought the farm\r\nbeside the river, and it was her that called the place 'Purple\r\nSprings.' It's an outlandish name, but it seems to kind a' stick.\r\nThere's no springs at all, and they are certainly not purple. But she\r\nmade the words out of peeled poplar poles, with her axe, and put them\r\nup at the front of her house, facin' the track, and the blamed words\r\nstick. Mind you, she must have spent months twistin' and turnin' them\r\npoles to suit her and get the letters right, and she made a rustic\r\nfence to put them on. They're so foolish you can't forget them. She's\r\nqueer, that's all--and she won't tell who she is, nor where she came\r\nfrom--and she seems to have money.\"\r\n\r\nPearl looked at him inquiringly. There must be more than that to the\r\nstory, she thought.\r\n\r\n\"The women will tell you more about her--that's sure. They gabble a\r\nlot among themselves about her--I don't know--we think it best to\r\nleave her alone. No woman has any right to live alone the way she\r\ndoes--it don't look well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyway,\" Mr. Cowan spoke hurriedly, as one who has been\r\nbetrayed into trifling feminine matters, and is anxious to get back to\r\nman's domain, \"we'll take you--at seventy-five dollars a month, and\r\nI guess you can get board at Mrs. Zinc's here at about fifteen. That\r\nain't bad wages for a girl your age. You can stay at Mrs. Zinc's\r\nanyway till you look around--Mrs. Zinc don't want a boarder. Girls can\r\nfit in any place--that's one reason in our neighborhood we like a girl\r\nbetter--there's no trouble about boardin' them. They can always manage\r\nsomehow. Even if things ain't very good--it don't seem to phaze\r\nthem--same as a man. We had a man once, and we had to pay him\r\ntwenty-five dollars a month extra, and gosh--the airs of him--wanted\r\na bed to himself and a hot dinner sent to the school. By Gum! and got\r\nit! We'll be lookin' for you at the middle of the month, and you can\r\nstay at Mrs. Zinc's and look around.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the delegation had departed, Pearl acquainted her mother with the\r\nresult of their visit. Mrs. Watson had retired to the kitchen, all of\r\na flutter, as soon as the visitors came.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to Purple Springs, Ma,\" she said, \"to take the school, and\r\nthey'll give me seventy-five dollars a month.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Watson sat down, dramatically, and applied her print apron to her\r\neyes--an occasion had come, and Mrs. Watson, true to tradition, would\r\nmake the most of it. Her mother had cried when she left home--it was a\r\ngirl's birthright to be well cried over--Pearlie Watson would not go\r\nforth unwept!\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up, Ma,\" said Pearl kindly, \"I'm not going to jail, and I'm not\r\ntaking the veil or going across the sea. I can call you up for fifteen\r\ncents, and I'll be bringing you home my washing every two weeks--so I\r\nwill not be lost entirely.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Watson rocked herself disconsolately back and forth in her chair,\r\nand the sound of her sobs filled the kitchen. Mrs. Watson was having a\r\ngood time, although appearances would not bear out the statement.\r\n\r\n\"It's the first break, Pearlie, that's what I'm thinkin'--and every\r\nnight when I lock the door, I'll be lockin' you out--not knowin' where\r\nye are. When a family once breaks you never can tell if they'll ever\r\nall be together again--that's what frightens me. It was bad enough\r\nwhen you went to the city--and I never slept a wink for two nights\r\nafter you'd gone. But this is worse, for now you're doin' for yourself\r\nand away from us that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gosh, Ma,\" spoke up Mary, \"you sure cry easy; and for queer things. I\r\nthink it's grand that Pearl can get out and earn money, and then when\r\nI get my entrance, I'll go to the city and be a teacher too. You're\r\ngoing to get back what you've spent on us, ma, and you ought to be in\r\ngreat humor. I'm just as proud of Pearl as I can hold, and I'll be\r\ntellin' the kids at school about my sister who is Principal of the\r\nPurple Springs School.\"\r\n\r\n\"Principal, Assistant and Janitor,\" laughed Pearl, \"that gives a\r\nperson some scope--to be sure.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Watson hurriedly put up the ironing-board, and set to work. She\r\nwould get Pearl ready, though she did it with a heavy heart.\r\n\r\nPearl finished her sewing and then went upstairs to make her small\r\nwardrobe ready for her departure, and although she stepped quickly and\r\nin a determined fashion, there was a pain, a lonely ache in her heart\r\nwhich would not cease, a crying out for the love which she had hoped\r\nwould be hers.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if I will ever get to be like ma,\" she thought, as she lined\r\nthe bottom of her little trunk with brown paper, and stuffed tissue\r\npaper into the sleeves of her \"good dress,\" \"I wonder! Well, I hope I\r\nwill be like her in some ways, but not in this mournful stuff--I won't\r\neither. I'll sing when I feel it coming on me--I will not go mourning\r\nall my days--not for any one!\"\r\n\r\nShe began to sing:--\r\n\r\n  \"Forgotten you? Yes, if forgetting\r\n  Is thinking all the day\r\n  How the long days pass without you.\r\n  Days seem years with you away!\"\r\n\r\nPearl's voice had a reedy mellowness, and an appeal which sent the\r\nwords straight into Mary's practical heart. Mary, washing\r\ndishes below, stopped, with a saucer in her hand, and listened\r\nopen-mouthed:--\r\n\r\n  \"If the warm wish to see you and hear you,\r\n  And hold you in my arms again,\r\n  If that be forgetting--you're right, dear,\r\n  And I have forgotten you then!\"\r\n\r\nHer voice trailed away on the last line into a sob, and Mary,\r\nlistening below, dropped a tear into the dish-water. Then racing up\r\nthe stairs, she burst into Pearl's room and said admiringly:\r\n\r\n\"Pearl, you're a wonder. It's an actress you ought to be. You got me\r\nblubbering, mind you. It's so sad about you and your beau that's had a\r\nrow, and both of you actin' so pale and proud, you made me see it\r\nall. Sing it again! Well, for the love of Pete--if you ain't ready to\r\nblubber too. That's good actin', Pearl--let me tell you--how can you\r\ndo it?\"\r\n\r\nPearl brushed away the tears, and laughed: \"I just hit on the wrong\r\nsong--that one always makes me cry, I can see them, too, going their\r\nown ways and feeling so bad, and moping around instead of cutting out\r\nthe whole thing the way they should. People are foolish to mope!\"\r\nPearl spoke sternly.\r\n\r\n\"I think you sing just lovely,\" said Mary, \"now go on, and I'll get\r\nback to the dishes. Sing 'Casey Jones'--that's the best one to wash\r\ndishes to. It's sad, too, but it's funny.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Watson held the iron to her cheek to test its heat, and\r\nlistened--too--as Pearl sang:--\r\n\r\n  \"Casey Jones--mounted to the cabin,\r\n  Casey Jones--with the orders in his hand,\r\n  Casey Jones--mounted to the cabin\r\n  And took his farewell tri-ip--to the promised land!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's well for them that can be so light-hearted,\" she said, \"and\r\nleave all belonging to them--as easy as Pearl. Children do not know,\r\nand never will know what it means, until one of their own ups and\r\nleaves them! It's the way of the world, one day they're babies, and\r\nthe next thing you know they're gone! It's the way of the world, but\r\nit's hard on the mother.\"\r\n\r\nPearl came down the stairs, stepping in time with Casey Jones's\r\nspectacular home-leaving:--\r\n\r\n  \"The caller called Casey, at--a half-past-four,\r\n  He kissed his wife at the station door.\"\r\n\r\n\"How goes the ironing, honest woman,\" she said, as she lovingly patted\r\nher mother's shoulder. \"It's a proud old bird you ought to be getting\r\none of your young robins pushed out of the nest--instead of standing\r\nhere with a sadness on your face.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother tried to smile through her tears.\r\n\r\n\"Pearlie, my dear, you're a queer girl--you never seem to think of\r\nwhat might happen. It may be six weeks before you can get home--with\r\nthe roads breaking up--and a lot can happen in that time. Sure--I\r\nmight not be here myself,\" she said, with a fresh burst of tears.\r\n\r\n\"Ma, you're funny,\" laughed Pearl, \"I wish you could see how funny\r\nyou are. Every Christmas ever since I can remember, that's what you\r\nsaid--you might never live to see another, and it used to nearly break\r\nmy heart when I was little, and until I made up my mind that you were\r\na poor guesser. You said it last Christmas just the same, and here\r\nyou are with your ears back and your neck bowed, heading up well for\r\nanother year. You're quite right in saying you may not be here, but if\r\nyou are not you'll be in a better place. Sure, things may happen, but\r\nit's better to have things happen than to be scared all the time that\r\nthey may happen. The young lads may take the measles and then the\r\nmumps, and the whooping-cough to finish up on--and the rosey-posey is\r\ngoing around too. But even if they do--it's most likely they will get\r\nover it--they always have. Up to the present, the past has taken care\r\nof the future. Maybe it always will.\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, I know there's always a chance things will go wrong--I know\r\nit, Ma--\" Pearl's eyes dimmed a little, and she held her lips tighter;\r\n\"there's always a chance. The cows may all choke to death seeing\r\nwhich of them can swallow the biggest turnip--the cats may all have\r\nfits--the chickens may break into the hen-house and steal a bag of\r\nsalt, eat it and die. But I don't believe they will. You just have to\r\ntrust them--and you'll have to trust me the same way. Just look, Ma--\"\r\n\r\nShe took a five-dollar bill from her purse and spread it on the\r\nironing-board before her mother. \"Fifteen o' them every month! See\r\nthe pictures that's on it, of the two grand old men. See the fine\r\nchin-whiskers on His Nibs here! Ain't it a pity he can't write his\r\nname, Ma, and him President of the Bank, and just has to make a bluff\r\nat it like this. Sure, and isn't that enough to drive any girl out to\r\nteach school, to see to it that bank presidents get a chance to learn\r\nto write. Bank presidents always come from the country; I'll be having\r\na row of them at Purple Springs--I'm sure. They will be able to tell\r\nin after years at Rotary Club luncheons how they ran barefooted in\r\nNovember, and made wheat gum--and chewed strings together. They just\r\nlike to tell about their chilblains and their stone-bruises.\"\r\n\r\nHer mother looked at her wonderingly: \"You think of queer things,\r\nPearl--I don't know where you get it--I can't make you out--and\r\nthere's another thing troubling me, Pearl. You are goin' away--I don't\r\nsuppose you will be livin' much at home now. You'll be makin' your own\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, and Pearl knew her mother was laboring under heavy\r\nemotion. She knew she was struggling to say what was difficult for her\r\nto get into words.\r\n\r\n\"When you've been away for a while and then come back to us, maybe\r\nyou'll find our ways strange to you, for you're quick in the pick-up,\r\nPearl, and we're only plain workin' people, and never had a chance at\r\nlearnin'. There may come a time when you're far above us, Pearl, and\r\nour ways will seem strange to you. I get worried about it, Pearl, for\r\nI know if that time ever comes, it will worry you too, for you're not\r\nthe kind that can hurt your own and not feel it.\"\r\n\r\nPearl looked at her mother almost with alarm in her face, and the\r\nfears that had been assailing her that her family were beyond the\r\nsocial pale came back for a moment. But with the fear came a\r\nfierce tenderness for all of them. She saw in a flash of her quick\r\nimagination the tragedy of it from her mother's side, and in her heart\r\nthere was just one big, burning, resolute desire, that pain from this\r\nsource might never smite her mother's loving heart. The hard hands,\r\nthe sunburnt face, the thin hair that she had not taken time to care\r\nfor; the hard-working shoulders, slightly stooped; the scrawny neck,\r\nwith its tell-tale lines of age; were eloquent in their appeal. Pearl\r\nsaw the contrast of her mother's life and what her own promised to\r\nbe, and her tender heart responded, and when she spoke, it was in\r\nan altered tone. All the fun had gone from it now, and it was not a\r\nchild's voice, nor a girl's voice, but a woman's, with all a woman's\r\ngentleness and understanding that spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"I know what is in your heart, and I will tell you\r\nhow I feel about it. You're afraid your ways may seem strange to me.\r\nSome of them are strange to me now. I often wonder how any one can be\r\nas unselfish as you are and keep it up day in and day out, working for\r\nother people. Most of us can make a good stab at it, and keep it up\r\nfor a day or so, but to hit the steady pace, never looking back and\r\nnever being cross or ugly about it--that's great!\"\r\n\r\n\"And about the other ... If ever there comes a time when an honest\r\nheart and a brave spirit in a woman seems strange to me, and I get\r\nfeeling myself above them--if I ever get thinking light of honesty and\r\nkindness and patience and hard work, and get thinking myself above\r\nthem--then your ways will be strange to me, but not until then!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Watson's face cleared, and a look of pride shone in her eyes.\r\nHer face seemed to lose some of its lines, and to reflect some of the\r\nlavish beauty of her daughter.\r\n\r\n\"You've comforted me, Pearl,\" she said simply, \"and it's not the first\r\ntime. Whatever comes or goes, Pearl, you'll know we are proud of you,\r\nand will stand back of you. Your outspoken ways may get you into\r\ntrouble, but we'll always believe you were right. We haven't much to\r\ngive you--only this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure and what more would any one want, leavin' home,\" Pearl was back\r\nto the speech of her childhood now. \"That's better than a fur coat to\r\nkeep out the cold, and the thought of my own folks makes me strong to\r\nface the world, knowin' I can always come home even if everything else\r\nis closed. That's good enough!\"\r\n\r\nPearl kissed her mother affectionately, and went back to her work\r\nupstairs, and soon Mary and her mother heard her singing. Mary stopped\r\nscrubbing the kitchen floor, and Mrs. Watson left the iron so long on\r\nTeddy's shirt that it left a mark:\r\n\r\n  \"Say Au Revoir,\" sang Pearl, \"but not goodbye,\r\n  The past is dead--love cannot die,\r\n  T'were better far--had we not met,\r\n  I loved you then--I love you yet.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in her voice that made her mother say, \"Poor\r\nchild, I wonder what's ahead of her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE MACHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nSeated in one of the billowy tapestry chairs of the Maple Leaf Club,\r\nwith a mahogany ash-stand at his elbow and the morning paper in his\r\nhand, the Cabinet Minister gave an exclamation which began far down in\r\nthe throat, tore upward past his immaculate collar, and came forth as\r\na full-sized round word of great emphasis and carrying power.\r\n\r\nIt brought to him at once Peter Neelands, one of the ambitious young\r\nlawyers of the city, who was just coming into prominence in political\r\ncircles.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say, sir?\" Peter asked politely.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet Minister controlled his indignation admirably, and with\r\nhis pudgy knuckles rapped the offending newspaper, with the motion\r\nused by a carpenter when trying to locate the joist in a plastered\r\nwall, as he said:--\r\n\r\n\"Here is absolutely the most damnably mischievous thing I have seen\r\nfor years, and this abominable sheet is featuring it on the Women's\r\nPage. They will all read it--and be infected. Women are such utterly\r\nunreasonable creatures. This is criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, sir?\" Peter asked deferentially.\r\n\r\nThe older man handed him the paper, and sat back in his chair, with\r\nhis fat hands clasped over his rotund person, and an expression of\r\ndeep disgust in his heavy gray eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Anything!--anything!--\" he cried, \"to gain a political advantage.\r\nThey will even play up this poor little uneducated, and no doubt,\r\nmentally unfit country girl, and put in her picture and quotations\r\nfrom her hysterical speeches. They never think--or care--for the\r\neffect this will have on her, filling her head with all sorts of\r\nnotions. This paper is absolutely without a soul, and seems determined\r\nto corrupt the country. And on the Women's Page, too, where they will\r\nall read it!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! that was good\"--exclaimed the young man, as he read.\r\n\r\n\"What was good--are you reading what I gave you to read?\" came from\r\nthe older man.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, about this girl at Millford, it says: 'In the discussion that\r\nfollowed, the local member heatedly opposed the speaker's arguments\r\nfavoring the sending of women to Parliament, and said when women sat\r\nin Parliament, he would retire--to which the speaker replied that this\r\nwas just another proof of the purifying effect women would have on\r\npolitics. This retort naturally brought down the house, and the local\r\nmember was not heard from again'--terribly cheeky, of course, but\r\nrather neat, sir, don't you think?\"\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet Minister took a thick cigar from his vest pocket, without\r\nreplying.\r\n\r\n\"Who is the member from Millford,\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"George Steadman, sir, a big, heavy-set chap--very faithful in his\r\nattendance, sir, absolutely reliable--never talks, but votes right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't recall him,\" said the great man, after a pause, \"but your\r\ndescription shows he's the sort we must retain.\"\r\n\r\nHe lit his cigar, and when it was drawing nicely, removed it from his\r\nmouth, and looked carefully at it, as if he expected to find authentic\r\ninformation in it regarding private members. Failing this, he put it\r\nback in his mouth, and between puffs went on:--\r\n\r\n\"Let me see--they are wanting a bridge near there, aren't they? on the\r\nSouris?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes sir, at Purple Springs.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right--we ought to be able to hold the fort there with the\r\nbridge--but the trouble is, this thing will spread, and when the\r\ncampaign warms up, this girl will be in demand.\"\r\n\r\nHe lapsed into silence again.\r\n\r\nPeter, still holding the paper, volunteered:--\r\n\r\n\"She seems to be one of those infant prodigies who could sing 'The\r\nDying Nun,' and recite 'Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight,' before she\r\ncould talk plainly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet Minister gave no sign that he was listening--mental\r\nagitation was written on his face.\r\n\r\n\"But we must head her off some way, I'll admit--I don't mind saying\r\nit--though of course it must not be repeated--these damnable women are\r\nmaking me nervous. I know how to fight men--I've been fighting them\r\nall my life--with some success.\"\r\n\r\n\"With wonderful success, sir!\" burst in Peter.\r\n\r\nThe older man threw out his hands in a way that registered modesty.\r\nIt had in it the whole scriptural injunction of \"Let another praise\r\nthee--and not thine own mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"With some success,\" he repeated sternly, \"but I cannot fight women.\r\nYou cannot tell what they will do; they are absolutely unreliable;\r\nthey are ungrateful, too. Many of these women who form the cursed\r\nWomen's Club, are women I have been on friendly terms with; so has\r\nthe Chief. We have granted them interviews; we have listened to their\r\nsuggestions; always with courtesy, always with patience. We have\r\nasked them to come back. In certain matters we have acceded to their\r\nrequests--in some unimportant matters--\" he added quickly. \"But what\r\nis the result? Is there any gratitude? Absolutely none. Give them\r\nan inch--they will take a mile. Women are good servants, but bad\r\nmasters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think, sir,\" said Peter, much flattered by being talked to\r\nin this friendly way by the great man, \"don't you think it is these\r\nmilitant suffragettes in England who are causing the trouble? Before\r\nthey began their depredations, women did not think of the vote. It is\r\nthe power of suggestion, don't you think, and all that sort of thing?\"\r\n\r\nThey were interrupted just then by the arrival of Mr. Banks, one of\r\nthe Government organizers, who, ignoring Peter's presence, addressed\r\nhimself to the Cabinet Minister. His manner was full of importance.\r\nMr. Banks had a position in the Public Works Department, and\r\noccasionally might be found there. Sometimes he went in for his mail,\r\nand stayed perhaps half an hour.\r\n\r\nHe addressed the Cabinet Minister boldly:--\r\n\r\n\"Did you see this? Looks like trouble, don't it? What do you suggest?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Banks did not remove either his hat or his cigar. Cabinet\r\nMinisters had no terror for him--he had made cabinet ministers. If Mr.\r\nBanks had lived in the time of Warwick that gentleman might not have\r\nhad the title of \"King-Maker.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think yourself,\" asked the Cabinet Minister\r\ndeferentially, \"you know the temper of the country perhaps better than\r\nany of us; shall we notice this girl or just let her go?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Banks laughed harshly.\r\n\r\n\"We can't stop her, as a matter of fact--she isn't the kind that can\r\nbe shut up. There's nothing to her--I've made inquiries. The people\r\nhave known her since she was born, and ran the country barefooted--so\r\nwe can't send her a 'Fly--all is discovered' postcard. It won't work.\r\nPeople all honest--can't get any of them into trouble--and then let\r\nthem off--and win her gratitude. This is a difficult case, and the\r\nother side will play it up, you bet. The girl has both looks and\r\nbrains, and a certain style. She went to the Normal with my girl. My\r\nkid's crazy about her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do her people need money?\" asked Peter; he was learning the inner\r\nside of politics.\r\n\r\nHis suggestion was ignored until the pause became painful--then the\r\norganizer said severely:--\r\n\r\n\"Nobody needs money, but every one can use it. But money is of no\r\nuse in this case. This has to be arranged by tact. Tact is what few\r\nmembers of the party have; their methods are raw.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there is no harm done yet,\" said Peter hopefully, \"a few country\r\npeople in a bally little school-house, and the girl gets up and\r\nharangues. She's been to the city, and knows a few catch phrases.\r\nThere's nothing to it. We wouldn't have known of it--only for the\r\nenthusiastic friend who pours his drivel into this paper.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Banks looked at Peter in deep contempt.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever wrote this does not write drivel, Peter,\" he said, with a\r\nnote of fatigue in his voice. \"He has made out a good case for this\r\ngirl. Every one who reads this wants to see her. I want to see her,\r\nyou want to see her--that's the deuce of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why don't you go,\" said Peter, \"or send me? I'd like to go.\r\nPerhaps it would be better to send a young man. I often think--\"\r\n\r\nMr. Banks looked at him with so much surprise in his usually heavy\r\ncountenance that Peter paused in confusion.\r\n\r\n\"I often think,\" he braved the disgust he had evoked, and spoke\r\nhurriedly to get it said before the other man had withered him with\r\nhis eyes; \"I often think a young man can get along sometimes--girls\r\nwill tell him more, feeling more companionable as it were--\" He\r\npaused, feeling for a convincing climax.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of Mr. Banks' scorn of Peter Neelands' efforts at solving\r\ntheir new difficulty, he soon began to think of it more favorably,\r\ncoming to this by a process known as elimination. No one else wanted\r\nto go; he could not think of anything else. Peter would not do any\r\nharm--he was as guileless as a blue-eyed Angora kitten, and above all,\r\nhe was willing and anxious to get into the game. This would give him\r\nan opportunity. So Mr. Banks suddenly made up his mind that he would\r\nauthorize a cheque to be drawn on the \"Funds.\" It could easily be\r\nentered under \"Inspection of Public Bridges,\" or any old thing--that\r\nwas a mere detail.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet Minister, who was later acquainted with the plan, and had\r\nby that time recovered his mental composure, almost spoiled everything\r\nby declaring it was a most unwise move, and absolutely unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"Leave her alone,\" he declared, as he sipped his whiskey and\r\nsoda--\"people like that hang themselves if they get enough rope. What\r\nis she anyway--but an unlearned, ignorant country girl, who has been\r\nin the city and gathered a few silly notions, and when she goes home\r\nshe shows off before her rustic friends. My dear boy,\" he addressed\r\nPeter now, from an immeasurable distance, \"the secret of England's\r\ngreatness consists of letting every damn fool say what he likes,\r\nthey feel better, and it does no harm. We must expect criticism and\r\ncensure--we are well able to bear it, and with our men in every\r\ndistrict, there is little to fear. We'll offset any effect there may\r\nbe from this girl's ravings by sending the Chief out for one speech.\"\r\n\r\nThe Minister of Public Works lapsed into meditation and drummed\r\npleasantly with his plump, shining hand on the table beside him. The\r\nsweet mellowness which had been Mr. Walker's aim for years, lay on his\r\nsoul. The world grew more misty and golden every moment, and in this\r\nsunkissed, nebulous haze, his fancy roamed free, released from sordid\r\ncares--by Mr. Walker's potent spell. It was a good world--a good world\r\nof true friends, no enemies, no contradiction of sinners or other\r\ndisagreeable people, nothing but ease, praise, power, success,\r\nglorious old world, without any hereafter, or any day of accounting.\r\nTears of enthusiasm made dewy his eyes--he loved everybody.\r\n\r\n\"The old Chief has a hold on the people that cannot be equalled. I\r\nthought it was wonderful last night at the banquet, the tribute be\r\npaid to his mother. It reveals such a tender side of him, even though\r\nhe has received the highest honor the people can give him, yet the\r\nremembers so tenderly the old home and its associations. That's his\r\ngreat secret of success--he's so human--with faults like other men,\r\nbut they only make him all the more beloved. He is so tolerant of all.\r\nWhen that poor simpleton stuffed the ballot-box--out somewhere in the\r\nBlue Mountains, a really clever piece of work too, wonderfully well\r\ndone--with the false bottom--I don't see how they ever discovered\r\nit--but it is hard to deceive the enemy--there's no piece of crooked\r\nwork they are not familiar with. He was nearly crazy when they caught\r\nhim at it--thought he could be put in jail--he forgot, the poor boob\r\n... who he was working for.... I'll never forget how fine the old\r\nChief allayed his fears--'All for a good cause, my boy,' he said, in\r\nthat jovial way of his, 'I have no fear--the Lord will look after His\r\nown.' No wonder he can get people to work for him. It is that hearty\r\ngood nature of his, and he never preaches to any one, or scolds. He\r\nwas just as kindly to the poor fellow as if he had succeeded. It was\r\nwonderful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Great old boy, all right,\" Peter agreed heartily.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Mr. Banks arranged with one of the partners of the law\r\nfirm to which Peter was attached to release him for an indefinite\r\nperiod, and his salary could be charged to the Government under\r\n\"Professional Services, Mr. P.J. Neelands,\" and being a fair-minded\r\nman, and persuaded that a laborer was worthy of his hire, he suggested\r\na substantial increase in salary for Mr. Neelands, considering the\r\ndelicate nature of the task he was undertaking, and who was paying for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe spring, notwithstanding its early March smiles, delayed its coming\r\nthat year, and the grim facts of the scarcity of feed faced the\r\nthriftiest farmers. The hungry cattle grew hungrier than ever, and\r\nwith threatening bellows and eyes of flame pushed and crowded around\r\nthe diminishing stacks. The cattle market went so low that it did not\r\npay to ship them to the city, though humane instincts prompted many\r\na farmer to do this to save their stock from a lingering death, and\r\ntheir own eyes from the agony of seeing them suffer.\r\n\r\nOn April the first came the big storm, which settled forever the feed\r\nproblem for so many hungry animals. It was a deliberate storm, a\r\ncarefully planned storm, beginning the day before with a warm, soft\r\nair, languorous, spring-like, with a pale yellow sun, with a cap of\r\nsilver haze around its head, which seemed to smile upon the earth with\r\nfairest promises of an early spring. The cattle wandered far from\r\nhome, lured by the gentle air and the mellow sunshine.\r\n\r\nIt was on this fair day that Mr. P.J. Neelands took his journey to\r\nthe country to do it a service, and it is but fair to say that Mr.\r\nNeelands had undertaken his new work with something related to\r\nenthusiasm. It savored of mystery, diplomacy, intrigue, and there was\r\na thrill in his heart as he sat in the green plush-covered seat,\r\nand leaning back, with his daintily shod feet on the opposite seat,\r\nsurveyed himself in the long mirror which filled the door of the\r\nstateroom at the end. It was a very smartly dressed young man he saw,\r\nsmiling back engagingly, and the picture pleased him. Expenses and\r\nsalary paid, with a very delightful piece of work before him, which,\r\nif handled tactfully and successfully, would bring him what he\r\ncraved--political promotion in the Young Men's Club. The fact in the\r\nglass smiled again. \"Diplomacy is the thing,\" said Peter to himself.\r\n\"It carries a man farther than anything--and I'm glad my first case\r\nhas a woman in it.\"\r\n\r\nHe buffed his nails on the palm of his other hand, and, looking at\r\nthem critically, decided to go over them again.\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing like personal neatness to impress a girl; and this\r\none, from her picture, will see everything at a glance.\"\r\n\r\nCrossing the river at Poplar Ridge, he looked out of the window at the\r\npleasant farmyard of one of the old settlers on the Assiniboine; a\r\nfine brick house, with wide verandahs, an automobile before the door,\r\na barnyard full of cackling hens, with a company of fine fat steers\r\nin an enclosure--a pleasing picture of farm life, which filled his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\"What a country of opportunity,\" thought Peter, \"a chance for every\r\none, and for women especially. Everything in life is done for them.\r\nThis house was built for some woman, no doubt. I hope she appreciates\r\nit, and is contented and happy in it. Women were made to charm\r\nus--inspire us--cheer us, but certainly not to rival us!\"\r\n\r\nPeter, with his hands on the knees of his well-creased trousers,\r\nhitched them slightly, just enough to reveal a glimpse of his lavender\r\nsocks.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps this girl needs only an interest--a love interest--\" Peter\r\nblushed as he thought it--\"to quiet her. If her affection were\r\ncaptured, localized, centralized, she would not be clamoring to take a\r\nman's place. She might be quite willing to enter politics, indirectly,\r\nand be the power behind a man of power.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked again at the newspaper picture of Pearl Watson, and again at\r\nhis own reflection in the long glass.\r\n\r\n\"And a girl like this,\" Peter meditated, \"would be a help, too. She is\r\nevidently magnetic and convincing.\" His mind drifted pleasantly into\r\nthe purple hills and valleys of the future, and in a delightfully\r\nvague way plans began to form for future campaigns, where a brilliant\r\nyoung lawyer became at once the delight of his friends and the despair\r\nof his enemies, by his scathing sarcasm, his quick repartee, and still\r\nmore by his piercing and inescapable logic. Never had the Conservative\r\nbanner been more proudly borne to victory. Older men wept tears of joy\r\nas they listened and murmured, \"The country is safe--thank God!\"\r\n\r\nAbly assisting him, though she deferred charmingly to him, in all\r\nthings, was his charming young wife, herself an able speaker and\r\ndebater who had once considered herself a suffragette, but who was now\r\nentirely absorbed in her beautiful home and her brilliant husband.\r\n\r\nPeter flicked the dust from his tan shoes with a polka-dotted\r\nhandkerchief, while rosy dreams, full of ambition and success filled\r\nhis impressionable mind.\r\n\r\nThrough the snowy hills the train made its way cautiously, making long\r\nand apparently purposeless stops between stations, as if haunted by\r\nthe fear of arriving too early. At such times Peter had leisure to\r\ncarefully study the monotonous landscape, and he could not help but\r\nnotice that the disparity in the size of the barn and that of the\r\nhouse in many cases was very great. A huge red barn, with white\r\ntrimmings, surmounted by windmills, often stood towering over a tiny\r\nlittle weather-beaten, miserable house, which across a mile or two of\r\nsnow, looked about the size of a child's block.\r\n\r\nBut small houses can be made very cosy, thought Peter complacently,\r\nfor the glamor of adventure was on him, and no shade of sadness could\r\nassail his high spirits.\r\n\r\nSome of the women who came to the train were disappointing in\r\nappearance. They were both shabby and sad, he thought, and he wondered\r\nwhy but looking closely at them he thought, with the fallacy of youth,\r\nthat they must be very old.\r\n\r\nPeter tried to outline his course of action. He would take a room\r\nat the hotel, making that his headquarters, and go out into the\r\ncountry--and stop at the Watson home, to ask directions or on some\r\ntrivial errand, and meet her that way. But the thought would come back\r\nwith tiresome regularity--suppose the first person who came to the\r\ndoor, gave him the directions he wanted--and shut the door. Well, of\r\ncourse he could ask for a drink,... but even that might fail. Perhaps\r\nhe should have brought an egg-beater--or a self-wringing mop to\r\ndemonstrate, or some of the other things his friends had suggested.\r\nHowever, that did not need to be decided at once. Peter prided himself\r\non his ability to leave tomorrow alone! So he made his way to the\r\nhotel on the corner, facing the station, untroubled by what the morrow\r\nmight bring forth, and registered his name in the large book which the\r\nclerk swung around in front of him, and quietly asked for a room with\r\na bath.\r\n\r\nThe clerk bit through the toothpick he had in his mouth, so great was\r\nhis surprise, but he answered steadily:\r\n\r\n\"All rooms with bath are taken--only rooms with bed left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Room with bed, then,\" said Peter, and he was given the key of No. 17,\r\nand pointed to the black and red carpeted stairway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE STORM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a morning of ominous calm, with an hour of bright sun,\r\ngradually softening into a white shadow, as a fleecy cloud of fairy\r\nwhiteness rolled over the sun's face, giving a light on the earth like\r\nthe garish light in a tent at high noon, a light of blinding whiteness\r\nthat hurts the eyes, although the sun is hidden. It was as innocent\r\na looking morning as any one would wish to see, still, warm, bright,\r\nwith a heavy brooding air which deadens sound and makes sleighs draw\r\nhard and horses come out in foam.\r\n\r\nJames Crocks, of the Horse Repository, sniffed the air apprehensively,\r\nbit a semi-circle out of a plug of tobacco, and gave orders that no\r\nhorse was to leave the barn that day, for \"he might be mistaken, and\r\nhe might not,\" but he thought \"we were in for it.\"\r\n\r\nOther people seemed to think the same, for no teams could be seen on\r\nany of the roads leading to the village. It was the kind of morning\r\non which the old timers say, \"Stay where you are, wherever it is--if\r\nthere's a roof over you!\"\r\n\r\nWakening from a troubled dream of fighting gophers that turned to\r\nwild-cats, Mr. Neelands, in No. 17, made a hurried toilet, on account\r\nof the temperature of the room, for although the morning was warm,\r\nNo. 17 still retained some of last week's temperature, and to Mr.\r\nNeelands, accustomed to the steam heat of Mrs. Marlowe's \"Select\r\nBoarding House--young men a specialty\"--it felt very chilly, indeed.\r\nBut Mr. Neelands had his mind made up to be unmoved by trifles.\r\n\r\nAfter a good breakfast in the dining room, Mr. Neelands walked out to\r\nsee the little town--and to see what information he could gather. The\r\nwell-dressed young man, with the pale gray spats, who carried a cane\r\non his arm and wore a belted coat, attracted many eyes as he swung out\r\ngaily across the street toward the livery stable.\r\n\r\nHis plans were still indefinite. Bertie, who was in charge of the\r\nstable, gazed spell-bound on the vision of fashion which stood at the\r\ndoor, asking about a team. Bertie, for once, was speechless--he seemed\r\nto be gazing on his own better self--the vision he would like to see\r\nwhen he sought his mirror.\r\n\r\n\"I would like to get a team for a short run,\" said Mr. Neelands\r\npolitely.\r\n\r\n\"Where you goin',\" asked Bertie.\r\n\r\nMr. Neelands hesitated, and became tactful.\r\n\r\n\"I am calling on teachers,\" he said, on a matter of business,\r\n\"introducing a new set of books for school libraries.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first thing Mr. Neelands could think of, and he was quite\r\npleased with it when he said it. It had a professional, business-like\r\nring, which pleased him.\r\n\r\n\"A very excellent set of books, which the Department of Education\r\ndesire to see in every school,\" Mr. Neelands elaborated.\r\n\r\nThen Bertie, always anxious to be helpful and to do a good deed, leapt\r\nto the door, almost upsetting Mr. Neelands in his haste. Bertie had\r\nan idea! Mr. Neelands did not connect his sudden departure with his\r\nrecent scheme of enriching the life of the country districts with the\r\nset of books just mentioned, and therefore waited rather impatiently\r\nfor the stableboy's return.\r\n\r\nBertie burst in, with the same enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"See, Mister, here's the teacher you want; I got her for you--she was\r\njust going to school.\"\r\n\r\nBertie's face bore the same glad rapture that veils the countenance of\r\na cat when she throws a mouse at your feet with a casual \"How's that.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neelands found himself facing a brown-eyed, well-dressed young\r\nlady, with big question marks in both eyes, question marks which in a\r\nvery dignified way demanded to know what it was all about.\r\n\r\nIn his confusion, Mr. Neelands, new in the art of diplomacy,\r\nblundered:\r\n\r\n\"Is this Miss Watson?\" he stammered.\r\n\r\nThe reply was definite.\r\n\r\n\"It is not, and why did you call me.\"\r\n\r\nIcicles began to hang from the roof. Mr. Neelands would have been\r\nwell pleased if they had fallen on him, or a horse had kicked him--or\r\nanything.\r\n\r\nHe blushed a ripe tomato red. Bertie, deeply grieved, reviewed the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\"He said he wanted to see the teachers, and I just went and got\r\nyou--that's all--you were the nearest teacher.\"\r\n\r\n\"Awfully sorry,\" began Mr. Neelands, \"I did not know anything about\r\nit. I'm am just a stranger, you see.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in Miss Morrison's eye which simply froze the\r\nlibrary proposition. He could not frame the words.\r\n\r\n\"If you have any business with me you may make an appointment at the\r\nschool. People who have business with the teachers generally do come\r\nto the school--not to the livery stable,\" she added, in exactly the\r\ntone in which she would have said \"All who have failed to get fifty\r\nper cent. in arithmetic will remain after four,\" a tone which would be\r\ndescribed as stern, but just.\r\n\r\nMr. Neelands leaned against a box-stall as Miss Morrison passed out.\r\nHe wiped his face with the polka-dot handkerchief, and the word which\r\nthe Cabinet Minister had used came easily to his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you speak to her when you got a chance?\" asked Bertie,\r\nanxious to divert the blame and meet railing with railing. He was\r\nalways getting in wrong just trying to help people. Darn it all! Mr.\r\nNeelands could still think of no word but the one.\r\n\r\n\"I wish it had been Pearl,\" said Bertie, \"Gee! she wouldn't ha' been\r\nso sore; she'd just laughed and jollied about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you know Pearl, do you?\" Mr. Neelands could feel a revival of\r\ninterest in life; also the stiffness began to leave his lips, and his\r\ntongue felt less like tissue paper.\r\n\r\n\"I guess everyone knows Pearl,\" said Bertie, with a consciousness of\r\nsuperiority on at least one point. Whereupon he again fulfilled the\r\npromises of youth, the leadings of his birth star and the promptings\r\nof his spirit guides, and told all he knew about the whole Watson\r\nfamily, not forgetting the roses he had taken to her, and Mrs. Crock's\r\ndiagnosis of it all.\r\n\r\nHe had an interested listener to it all, and under the inspiration\r\nwhich a sympathetic hearing gives he grew eloquent, and touched with\r\nhis fine fancy the romantic part of it.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Crocks says she believes Pearl is pretty sweet on the Doctor.\r\nPearl is one swell girl, and all that, but Mrs. Crocks says the Doctor\r\nwill likely marry the Senator's daughter. Gee! I wouldn't if I was\r\nhim. She hasn't got the style that Pearl has--she rides a lot and has\r\nnerve--and all that, but she's bow-legged!\" His tone was indescribably\r\nscornful.\r\n\r\nMr. Neelands gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Yep,\" went on Bertie complacently, \"we see a lot here at the stable\r\nand get to know a lot--one way'n another--we can't help it. They come\r\nand go, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor won't run for Parliament--he turned it down. Mrs. Crocks\r\nthinks the Senator maybe persuaded him not to--the Senator is for the\r\nGovernment, of course, and it is the other side wanted the doctor;\r\nanyway, that suits old Steadman; he'll likely go in again on account\r\nof the bridge at Purple Springs. Every one wants to get work on it\r\nwith the Spring hangin' back the way it is.\" \"How about a horse? I\r\nwant to take a drive into the country,\" said Mr. Neelands.\r\n\r\n\"No horse can go out of here today,\" answered Bertie. \"Mr. Crocks says\r\nthere'll be storm, and he won't take no chances on his horses. He says\r\npeople can judge for themselves and run risks if they want to, he'll\r\ndecide for the horses--and they can't go.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, all right,\" said Mr. Neelands. \"How far is it to the Watson farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going out?\" asked Bertie. \"Better phone and see if she's at\r\nhome. Here's the phone--I'll get her.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Neelands laid a restraining hand on Bertie's arm. \"Easy there,\r\nmy friend,\" he said, his tone resembling Miss Morrison's in its\r\ncommanding chilliness, \"How far is it to the Watson farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five miles in summer, four in winter,\" Bertie answered a little\r\nsulkily.\r\n\r\n\"You would call this winter, I suppose,\" said the traveller, looking\r\nout at the darkening street.\r\n\r\n\"I'd call it--oh, well, never mind what I'd call it--I'm always\r\ntalking too much--call it anything you like.\" Bertie grew dignified\r\nand reserved. \"Call it the first of July if you like! I don't care.\"\r\n\r\nThat is how it came that Mr. Neelands took the out-trail when all the\r\nsigns were against travelling, but to his unaccustomed eye there\r\nwas nothing to fear in the woolly grayness of the sky, nor in the\r\noccasional snowflake that came riding on the wind. The roads were\r\nhard-packed and swept clean by the wind, and the sensation of space\r\nand freedom most enjoyable.\r\n\r\nMr. Neelands as he walked filed away tidily in his mind the\r\ninformation received. There were valuable clues contained in the\r\nstable-boy's chatter, Which he would tabulate, regarding the lady\r\nof his quest. She was popular, approachable, gifted with a sense of\r\nhumor, and perhaps disappointed in love. No clue was too small to be\r\noverlooked--and so, feeling himself one of the most deadly of sleuths,\r\nMr. Neelands walked joyously on, while behind him there gathered one\r\nof the worst blizzards that the Souris Valley has known.\r\n\r\nThe storm began with great blobbery flakes of snow, which came\r\nelbowing each other down the wind, crossing and re-crossing, circling,\r\ndrifting, whirling, fluttering, so dense and thick that the whole air\r\ndarkened ominously, and the sun seemed to withdraw from the world,\r\nleaving the wind and the storm to their own evil ways.\r\n\r\nThe wind at once began its circling motions, whipping the snow\r\ninto the traveller's face, blinding and choking him, lashing him\r\nmercilessly and with a sudden impish delight, as if all the evil\r\nspirits of the air had declared war upon him.\r\n\r\nHe turned to look back, but the storm had closed behind him, having\r\ncome down from the northwest and overtaken him as he walked. His only\r\nhope was to go with it, for to face it was impossible, and yet it\r\nseemed to have no direction, for it blew up in his face; it fell on\r\nhim; it slapped him, jostled him, pushed him, roared in his ears,\r\nsmothering him, drowning his cries with malicious joy. No cat ever\r\nworried or harrassed a mouse with greater glee than the storm fiends\r\nthat frolicked through the valley that day, took their revenge on the\r\ncity man, with his pointed boots, his silk-lined gloves, his belted\r\ncoat and gray fedora, as he struggled on, slipping, choking, falling\r\nand rising. It seemed to him like a terrible nightmare, in its sudden,\r\ngripping fury.\r\n\r\nIt pounded on his eyeballs until he was not sure but his eyes were\r\ngone; it filled his mouth and ears, and cold water trickled down his\r\nback. His gloves were wet through, and freezing, for the air grew\r\ncolder every minute, and the terror of the drowning man came to him.\r\nHe struggled on madly, like a steer that feels the muskeg closing\r\naround him. He did not think; he fought, with the same instinct that\r\ndrives the cattle blindly, madly on towards shelter and food, when the\r\nstorm lashes them and the hunger rage drives them on.\r\n\r\nSylvester Paine, shaking the snow from his clothes like a water\r\nspaniel, and stamping all over the kitchen, was followed by his wife,\r\nwho vainly tried to sweep it up as fast as it fell. She made no\r\nremonstrance, but merely swept, having long since earned that her\r\nliege lord was never turned aside from his purpose by any word of\r\nhers.\r\n\r\nWhen he was quite done, and the snow was melting in pools on the\r\nfloor, he delivered his opinion of the country and the weather: \"This\r\nis sure a hell of a country,\" he said, \"that can throw a storm like\r\nthis at the end of March.\"\r\n\r\nShe made no reply--she had not made either the country or the weather,\r\nand would not take responsibility for them. She went on wiping up the\r\nwater from the floor, with rebellion, slumbering, hidden rebellion\r\nin every movement, and the look in her eyes when she turned to the\r\nwindow, was a strange blending of rage and fear.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you answer me,\" he said, turning around quickly, \"Darn you,\r\nwhy can't you speak when your spoken to?\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not speak to me,\" she said. \"There was nothing for me to\r\nsay.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment--her silence exasperated him. She seemed\r\nto be keeping something back--something sinister and unknown.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can tell you one thing,\" he went on, in a voice that seemed\r\nto be made of iron filings, \"you may not answer when I speak to\r\nyou--you'll do what you're told. I'm not going to slave my life out\r\non this farm when there's easier money to be made. Why should you set\r\nyourself above me, and say you won't go into a hotel? I have the right\r\nto decide, anyway. Better people than you have kept hotels, for all\r\nyour airs. Are you any better than I am?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" she said, without raising her eyes from the floor. She\r\nrose quietly and washed out her floorcloth, and stood drying her hands\r\non the roller towel which hung on the kitchen door. There was an air\r\nof composure about her that enraged him. He could not make it out. The\r\nquality which made the women call her proud kindled his anger now.\r\n\r\nThe storm tore past the house, shaking it in its grip like a terrier\r\nshaking a rat. It seemed to mock at their trivial disputes, and seek\r\nto settle them by drowning the sound of them.\r\n\r\nHis voice rang above the storm:--\r\n\r\n\"I'll sell the farm,\" he shouted. \"I'll sell every cow and horse on\r\nit. I'll sell the bed from under you--I'll break you and your stuck-up\r\nways, and you'll not get a cent of money from me--not if your tongue\r\nwas hanging out.\"\r\n\r\nThe children shrank into corners and pitifully tried to efface\r\nthemselves. The dog, with drooping tail, sought shelter under the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nSylvester Paine thought he saw a shrinking in her face, and followed\r\nup his advantage with a fresh outpouring of abuse.\r\n\r\n\"There's no one to help you--or be sorry for you--you haven't a friend\r\nin this neighborhood, with your stuck-up way. The women are sore on\r\nyou--none of them ever come to see you or even phone you. Don't you\r\nthink I see it! You've no one to turn to, so you might as well know\r\nit--I've got you!\"\r\n\r\nHis last words were almost screamed at her, as he strove to make his\r\nvoice sound above the storm, and in a sudden lull of the storm, they\r\nrang through the house.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment there was a sound of something falling against\r\nthe door and the dog, with bristling hair, ran out from his place of\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine turned quickly to the door and opened it, letting in a\r\ngust of blinding snow, which eddied in the room and melted on the hot\r\nstove.\r\n\r\nA man, covered with snow, lay where he had fallen, exhausted on the\r\ndoorstep.\r\n\r\n\"What's this,\" cried Paine, in a loud voice, as he ran forward; \"where\r\ndid this fellow come from?\"\r\n\r\nIn his excitement he asked it over and over again, as if Mrs. Paine\r\nshould know. She ventured no opinion, but busied herself in getting\r\nthe snow from the clothes of her visitor and placing him in the\r\nrocking chair beside the fire. He soon recovered the power of speech,\r\nand thanked her gaspingly, but with deep sincerity.\r\n\r\n\"This is a deuce of a day for any one to be out,\" began the man of the\r\nhouse. \"Any fool could have told it was going to storm; what drove you\r\nout? Where did you come from, anyway?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine looked appealingly at him:--\r\n\r\n\"Let him get his breath, can't you, see, he is all in,\" she said\r\nquietly, \"he'll tell you, when he can speak.\"\r\n\r\nIn a couple of hours, Peter Neelands, draped in a gray blanket, sat\r\nbeside the fire, while his clothes were being dried, and rejoiced\r\nover the fact that he was alive. The near tragedy of the bright young\r\nlawyer found dead in the snow still thrilled him. It had been a close\r\nsqueak, he told himself, and a drowsy sense of physical well-being\r\nmade him almost unconscious of his surroundings. It was enough for him\r\nto be alive and warm.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine moved about the house quietly, and did all she could with\r\nher crude means to make her guest comfortable, and to assure him of\r\nher hospitality. She pressed his clothes into shape again, and gave\r\nhim a well-cooked dinner, as well served as her scanty supplies would\r\nallow, asking no questions, but with a quiet dignity making him feel\r\nthat she was glad to serve him. There was something in her manner\r\nwhich made a strong appeal to the chivalrous heart of the young man.\r\nHe wanted to help her--do something for her--make things easier for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon wore on, with no loosening of the grip of the storm,\r\nand Peter began to realize that he was a prisoner. He could have been\r\nquite happy with Mrs. Paine and the children, even though the floor\r\nof the kitchen was draughty and cold, the walls smoked, the place\r\ndesolate and poor; but the presence of his host, with his insulting\r\nmanners, soon grew unbearable. Mr. Paine sat in front of the\r\nstove, smoking and spitting, abusing the country, the weather, the\r\nGovernment, the church. Nothing escaped him, and everything was wrong.\r\n\r\nA certain form of conceit shone through his words too, which increased\r\nhis listener's contempt. He had made many sharp deals in his time, of\r\nwhich he was inordinately proud. Now he gloated over them. Fifteen\r\nthousand dollars of horse notes were safely discounted in the bank,\r\nso he did not care, he said, whether spring came or not. He had his\r\nmoney. The bank could collect the notes.\r\n\r\nPeter looked at him to see if he were joking. Surely no man with so\r\nmuch money would live so poorly and have his wife and children so\r\nshabbily dressed. Something of this must have shown in his face.\r\n\r\n\"I've made money,\" cried Sylvester Paine, spitting at the leg of the\r\nstove; \"and I've kept it--or spent it, just as I saw fit, and I did\r\nnot waste is on a fancy house. What's a house, anyway, but a place to\r\neat and sleep. I ain't goin' to put notions into my woman's head, with\r\nany big house--she knows better than to ask it now. If she don't like\r\nthe house--the door is open--let her get out--I say. She can't take\r\nthe kids--and she won't go far without them.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed unpleasantly: \"That's the way to have them, and by gosh!\r\nthere's one place I admired the old Premier--in the way he roasted\r\nthose freaks of women who came askin' for the vote. I don't think much\r\nof the Government, but I'm with them on that--in keepin' the women\r\nwhere they belong.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why,\" interrupted Peter, with a very uneasy mind, \"why shouldn't\r\nwomen have something to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you married?\" demanded his host.\r\n\r\n\"No, not yet,\" said Peter blushing.\r\n\r\n\"Well, when you're married--will you let your wife decide where you\r\nwill live? How you earn your living--and all that? No sir, I'll bet\r\nyou won't--you'll be boss, won't you? I guess so. Well, every man has\r\nthat right, absolutely. Here am I--I'm goin' to sell out here and buy\r\na hotel--there's good money in it, easy livin'. She--\" there was an\r\nunutterable scorn in his voice, \"says she won't go--says it ain't\r\nright to sell liquor. I say she'll come with me or get out. She might\r\nbe able to earn her own livin', but she can't take the kids. Accordin'\r\nto law, children belong to the father--ain't that right? There's a man\r\ncomin' to buy the farm--I guess he would have been out today, only for\r\nthe storm. We have the bargain made--all but the signin' up.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine stood still in the middle of the floor, and listened in\r\nterror. \"A man coming to buy the farm!\" Every trace of color left her\r\nface! Maybe it was not true.\r\n\r\nHe saw the terror in her face, and followed up his advantage.\r\n\r\n\"People have to learn to do as they're told when I'm round. No one can\r\ndefy me--I'll tell you that. Every one knows me--I can be led, but I\r\ncant be driven.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Neelands had the most uncomfortable feeling he had ever known.\r\nHe was not sure whether it was his utter aversion to the man who sat\r\nin front of the stove, boasting of his sharp dealing, or a physical\r\nillness which affected him, but a horrible nausea came over him. His\r\nhead swam--his eardrums seemed like to burst--every bone began to\r\nache.\r\n\r\nThe three days that followed were like a nightmare, which even time\r\ncould never efface or rob of its horror. The fight with the storm\r\nhad proven such a shock to him that for three days a burning fever,\r\nalternating with chills, held him in its clutches, and even when the\r\nstorm subsided kept him a prisoner sorely against his will.\r\n\r\nIn these three days, at close range, he saw something of a phase of\r\nlife he had never even guessed at. He did not know that human beings\r\ncould live in such crude conditions, without comforts, without\r\neven necessities. It was like a bad dream--confused, humiliating,\r\nhorrible--and when on the third day he was able to get into his\r\nclothes his one desire was to get away--and yet, to leave his kind\r\nhostess who had so gently nursed him and cared for him, seemed like an\r\nact of desertion.\r\n\r\nHowever, when he was on his feet, though feeling much shaken, and\r\nstill a bit weak, his courage came back. Something surely could be\r\ndone to relieve conditions like this.\r\n\r\nThe snow was piled fantastically in huge mounds over the fields, and\r\nthe railway cuts would be drifted full, so no train would run for\r\ndays. But Peter felt that he could walk the distance back to town.\r\n\r\nHis host made no objection, and no offer to drive him.\r\n\r\nIn the tiny bedroom off the kitchen, which Mrs. Paine had given him,\r\nas he shiveringly made his preparations for leaving, he heard a\r\nstrange voice in the other room, a girl's voice, cheery, pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"I just came in to see how you are, Mrs. Paine. No thank you, I won't\r\nput the team in the stable--I ran them into the shed. I am on my way\r\nhome from driving the children to school. Some storm, wasn't it? The\r\nsnow is ribbed like a washboard, but it is hard enough to carry the\r\nhorses.\"\r\n\r\nPeter came out, with his coat and his hat in his hand, and was\r\nintroduced. His first thought was one of extreme mortification--three\r\ndays' beard was on his face. His toilet activities had been limited\r\nin number. He knew he felt wretched, seedy, groggy--and looked it.\r\nSomething in Pearl's manner re-assured him.\r\n\r\n\"Going to town?\" said she kindly, \"rather too far for you to walk when\r\nyou are feeling tough. Come home with me if you are not in a hurry,\r\nand I will drive you in this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nPeter accepted gladly.\r\n\r\nHe hardly looked at her, holding to some faint hope that if he did\r\nnot look at her she would not be able to see him either, and at this\r\nmoment Peter's one desire was not to be seen, at least by this girl.\r\n\r\nIn a man's coonskin coat she stood at the door, with her face rosy\r\nwith the cold. She brought an element of hope and youth, a new\r\nspirit of adventure into the drab room, with its sodden, commonplace\r\ndreariness. Peter's spirits began to rise.\r\n\r\nOutside the dogs began to bark, and a cutter went quickly past the\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine, looking out, gave a cry of alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Wait, Pearl! Oh, don't go!\" she cried, \"stay with me. It's the man\r\nwho is going to buy the farm. He said he was coming, but I didn't\r\nbelieve him;\" her hands were locking and unlocking.\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Pearl slipped off her coat and waited. She seemed\r\nto know the whole situation, and instinctively Peter began to feel\r\neasier. There was something about this handsome girl, with the\r\nfirmly-set and dimpled chin, which gave him confidence.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments Sylvester Paine and his caller came in from the\r\nbarn. Pearl stood beside Mrs. Paine, protectingly. Her face had grown\r\nserious; she knew the fight was on.\r\n\r\nSylvester Paine nodded to her curtly, and introduced his guest to\r\nevery one at once.\r\n\r\n\"This is Mr. Gilchrist,\" he said, \"and now we'll get to business. Get\r\nthe deeds.\" he said, to his wife shortly.\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine went upstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Who did you say the young lady is,\" asked Mr. Gilchrist, who thought\r\nhe recognized Pearl, but not expecting to see her here, wished to be\r\nsure. Mr. Gilchrist, as President of the Political Association, had\r\nheard about Pearl, and hoped she might be an able ally in the coming\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n\"This is Pearl Watson,\" said Mr. Paine, rather grudgingly. \"This is\r\nthe girl that's working up the women to thinking that they ought to\r\nvote. Her father and mother are good neighbors of mine, and Pearl was\r\na nice kid, too, until she went to the city and got a lot of fool\r\nnotions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a nice kid yet,\" said Pearl, smiling at him, and compelling him\r\nto meet her eye, \"and I am a good neighbor of yours too, Mr. Paine,\r\nfor I am going to do something for you today that no one has ever\r\ndone. I'm going to tell you something.\"\r\n\r\nShe walked over to the table and motioned to the two men to sit\r\ndown, though she remained standing. Sylvester Paine stared at her\r\nuncomprehendingly. The girl's composure was disconcerting. Her voice\r\nhad a vibrant passion in it that made Peter's heart begin to beat. It\r\nwas like watching a play that approaches its climax.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gilchrist probably does not understand that there is a small\r\ntragedy going on here today. Maybe he does not know the part he is\r\nplaying in it. It is often so in life, that people do not know the\r\npart they played until it is too late to change. You've come here\r\ntoday to buy the farm.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gilchrist nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Ten years ago this farm was idle land. Mr. and Mrs. Paine homesteaded\r\nit, and have made it one of the best in the country. It has been hard\r\nwork, but they have succeeded. For the last five years Mr. Paine has\r\nnot been much at home--he has bought cattle and horses and shipped\r\nthem to the city, and has done very well, and now has nearly fifteen\r\nthousand dollars in the bank. There is no cleverer man in the country\r\nthan Mr. Paine in making a bargain, and he is considered one of the\r\nbest horsemen in the Province. He pays his debts, keeps his word, and\r\nthere is no better neighbor in this district.\"\r\n\r\nSylvester Paine watched her open-mouthed--amazed. How did she know\r\nall this? It made strange music in his ears, for, in spite of all his\r\nbluster, he hungered for praise; for applause. Pearl's words fell like\r\na shower on a thirsty field.\r\n\r\n\"Meanwhile,\" Pearl went on, \"Mrs. Paine runs the farm, and makes it\r\npay, too. Although Mrs. Paine works the hardest of the two, Mr. Paine\r\nhandles all the money, and everything is in his name. He has not\r\nnoticed just how old and worn her clothes are. Being away so much, the\r\nmanner of living does not mean so much to him as to her, for she is\r\nalways here. Mrs. Paine is not the sort of woman who talks. She never\r\ncomplains to the other women, and they call her proud. I think Mrs.\r\nPaine has been to blame in not telling Mr. Paine just how badly she\r\nneeds new clothes. He always looks very well himself, and I am sure he\r\nwould like to see her well dressed, and the children too. But she will\r\nnot ask him for money, and just grubs along on what she can get with\r\nthe butter money. She is too proud to go out poorly dressed, and so\r\ndoes not leave home for months at a time, and of course, that's bad\r\nfor her spirits, and Mr. Paine gets many a cross look from her when he\r\ncomes home. It makes him very angry when she will not speak--he does\r\nnot understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Paine's intention now is to sell the farm and buy the hotel in\r\nMillford. He will still go on buying cattle, and his wife will run the\r\nhotel. She does not want to do this. She says she will not do it--it\r\nis not a proper place in which to raise her children. She hates the\r\nliquor business. This is her home, for which she has worked.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not much of a home; it's cold in winter and hot in summer. You\r\nwould never think a man with fifteen thousand dollars in the bank\r\nwould let his wife and children live like this, without even the\r\ncommon decencies of life. That's why Mrs. Paine has never had any of\r\nher own people come to visit her, she is ashamed for them to see how\r\nbadly off she is. No, it is not much of a home, but she clings to it.\r\nIt is strange how women and animals cling to their homes. You remember\r\nthe old home on the road to Hampton your people had, Mr. Gilchrist,\r\nthe fine old house with the white veranda and the big red barn? It was\r\nthe best house on the road. It burned afterwards--about three years\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gilchrist nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we bought, when we came to our farm here, one of your father's\r\nhorses, the old Polly mare--do you remember Polly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I broke her in,\" he said, \"when she was three.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Polly had been away a long time from her old home, but last\r\nsummer when we drove to Hampton Polly turned in to the old place and\r\nwent straight to the place where the stable had stood. There was\r\nnothing there--even the ruins are overgrown with lamb's quarters--but\r\nPolly went straight to the spot. It had been home to her.\"\r\n\r\nA silence fell on the room.\r\n\r\n\"There is no law to protect Mrs. Paine,\" Pearl went on, after a long\r\npause. \"The law is on your side, Mr. Gilchrist. If you want the place\r\nthere is no law to save Mrs. Paine. Mr. Paine is quite right in saying\r\nhe can take the children, so she will have to follow. Mrs. Paine is\r\nnot the sort of woman to desert her children. She would live even in\r\na hotel rather than desert her children. The law is on your side,\r\ngentlemen--you have the legal right to go on with the transaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"What law is this?\" said Mr. Gilchrist.\r\n\r\n\"The law of this Province,\" said Pearl.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say,\" said Mr. Gilchrist hotly, \"that Mrs. Paine\r\ncannot claim any part of the price of this farm as her own--or does\r\nnot need to sign the agreement of sale. Has she no claim at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"She has none,\" said Pearl, \"she has no more claim on this farm than\r\nthe dog has!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Gosh! I never knew that,\" he cried. \"We'll see a lawyer in town\r\nbefore we do anything. That's news to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of it, Pearl?\" Mrs. Paine whispered. \"Maybe there's\r\nsomething I can do. This young man is a lawyer--maybe he could tell\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nSylvester Paine was trying to recover his point of view.\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell us,\" Pearl asked Peter, who sat in a corner, intensely\r\nlistening, \"what the law says.\"\r\n\r\n\"The law,\" said Peter miserably--as one who hates the word he is about\r\nto utter--\"gives a married woman no rights. She has no claim on her\r\nhome, nor on her children. A man can sell or will away his property\r\nfrom his wife. A man can will away his unborn child--and it's a hell\r\nof a law,\" he added fiercely.\r\n\r\nPearl turned to Robert Gilchrist, saying, \"Mr. Gilchrist, the law is\r\nwith you. The woman and the three children have no protection. Mr.\r\nPaine is willing that they should be turned out. It is up to you.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine, who had come down the stairs with the deed in her hand,\r\nlaid it on the table and waited. For some time no one spoke.\r\n\r\nSylvester Paine looked at the floor. He was a heavy-set man, with a\r\nhuge head, bare-faced and rather a high forehead. He did not seem to\r\nbe able to lift his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" continued Pearl, \"the people who made the laws did not\r\nthink it would ever come to a show-down like this. They thought that\r\nwhen a man promised to love and cherish a woman--he would look after\r\nher and make her happy, and see to it that she had clothes to wear and\r\na decent way of living--if he could. Of course, there are plenty of\r\nmen who would gladly give their wives everything in life, but they\r\ncan't, poor fellows--for they are poor; but Mr. Paine is one of the\r\nbest off men in the district. He could have a beautiful home if he\r\nliked, and his wife could be the handsomest woman in the neighborhood.\r\nShe is the sort of woman who would show off good clothes too. I\r\nsuppose her love of pretty things has made her all the sorer, because\r\nshe has not had them. I just wanted to tell you, Mr. Gilchrist, before\r\nyou closed the deal. Mrs. Paine would never tell you, and naturally\r\nenough Mr. Paine wouldn't. In fact he does not know just how things\r\nstand. But I feel that you should know just what you are doing if you\r\ntake this farm. Of course, it is hardly fair to expect you to protect\r\nthis woman's home and her children, and save her from being turned\r\nout, if her husband won't--you are under no obligation to protect her.\r\nShe made her choice years ago--with her eyes open--when she married\r\nSylvester Paine. It seems ... she guessed wrong ... and now ... she\r\nmust pay!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Paine sank into a chair with a sob that seemed to tear her heart\r\nout. The auburn hair fell across her face, her lovely curly hair, from\r\nwhich in her excitement she had pulled the pins. It lay on the table\r\nin ringlets of gold, which seemed to writhe, as if they too were\r\nsuffering. Her breath came sobbing, like a dog's dream.\r\n\r\nSylvester Paine was the first to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl, you're wrong in one place,\" he said, \"just one--you had\r\neverything else straight. But you were wrong in one place.\"\r\n\r\nHe went around the table and laid his hand on his wife's head.\r\n\r\n\"Millie,\" he said, gently.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him tearfully.\r\n\r\n\"Millie!\"\r\n\r\nHe stood awkwardly beside her, struggling to control himself. All the\r\nswagger had gone from him, all the bluster. When he spoke his voice\r\nwas husky.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl has got it all straight, except in one place.\" he said. \"She's\r\nwrong in one place. She says you guessed wrong when you married me,\r\nMillie.\"\r\n\r\nHis voice was thick, and the words came with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl has done fine, and sized the case up well ... but she's wrong\r\nthere. It looks bad just now, Millie--but you didn't make such a\r\nrotten guess, after all. I'm not just sayin' what I'll do, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"The deal is off, Bob,\" he said to Mr. Gilchrist, \"until Mrs. Paine\r\nand I talk things over.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then Pearl quietly slipped into her coat and, motioning to Peter,\r\nwho gladly followed her, went out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTH WAVE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe big storm had demoralized the long-distance telephone service, so,\r\nthat it was by night lettergram that George Steadman was commissioned\r\nby the official organizer of the Government to find P.J. Neelands, who\r\nhad not been heard of since the morning of the storm. Mr. Steadman was\r\nsomewhat at a loss to know how to proceed.\r\n\r\nHe was very sorry about Mr. Neelands and his reported disappearance.\r\nMr. Neelands was one of the friendliest and most approachable of\r\nthe young political set, and Mr. Steadman had often listened to his\r\nspeeches, and always with appreciation. He wondered why Mr. Neelands\r\nhad come to Millford now without telling him.\r\n\r\nAt the hotel, nothing was known of the young man, only that he had\r\ntaken a room, registered, slept one night, and gone, leaving all his\r\nthings. Mr. Steadman was conducted to Number 17, and shown the meagre\r\ndetails of the young man's brief stay. His toilet articles, of\r\nsterling silver with his monogram, lay on the turkish towel, which at\r\nonce concealed and protected the elm top of the bureau; his two bags,\r\nopen and partly unpacked, took up most of the floor space in the room.\r\nHis dressing-gown was hung on one of the two hooks on the back of the\r\ndoor, suspended by one shoulder, which gave it a weary, drunken look.\r\nThere was something melancholy and tragic about it all.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of life we are in death,\" said George Steadman to\r\nhimself piously, and shuddered. \"It looks bad. Poor young fellow--cut\r\noff in his prime--he did not even have a fur coat! and went out never\r\nthinking.\"\r\n\r\nHe examined the telegram again--\"On business for the Government,\" it\r\nsaid, \"of a private nature. See 'Evening Echo' March 21st, Page 23.\"\r\nWhat could that mean?\r\n\r\nGeorge Steadman did not take the \"Evening Echo.\" He hated the very\r\nsight of it. The \"Morning Sun\" was good enough for him. He remembered\r\nthe thrill of pride he had felt when his Chief had said one day in\r\ndebate, that he wanted nothing better than the \"Sun\" and the Bible.\r\nIt was an able utterance, he thought, reminding one of the good old\r\nQueen's reply to the Ethiopian Prince, and should have made its appeal\r\neven to the Opposition; but the leader had said, in commenting on it,\r\nthat he was glad to know his honorable friend was broad-minded enough\r\nto read both sides!\r\n\r\nAnd now he was told to look up the Opposition paper, and the very page\r\nwas given. His first thought was that it was a personal attack upon\r\nhimself. But how could that be? He never opened his mouth in the\r\nhouse--he never even expressed an opinion, and as the campaign had not\r\nyet begun--he had not done anything.\r\n\r\nHe read the telegram again. In desperation he went back to the long\r\ndistance booth, but found the line still out of order, and a wire had\r\ncome giving the details of the damage done by the storm. It would be\r\nseveral days before communication could be established. There was no\r\nhelp coming from headquarters, and from the wording of the telegram\r\nthere seemed to be a reason for their not giving clear details. He\r\nmust get a copy of the paper.\r\n\r\nReluctantly he went to the printing office and made known his errand.\r\nMr. Driggs was delighted to give him the paper--he had it some place,\r\nthough he very seldom opened any of his exchanges. He evidently bore\r\nMr. Steadman no ill-will for his plain talk two weeks ago. With some\r\ndifficulty he found it, with its wrapper still intact. It was a loose\r\nwrapper, which slipped off and on easily. Mr. Steadman remarked\r\ncarelessly that there was an editorial in it to which his attention\r\nhad been drawn, on hearing which Mr. Driggs turned his head and winked\r\nat an imaginary accomplice.\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman went over to the livery stable to find a quiet,\r\nclover-scented corner in which he might peruse his paper. An intuitive\r\nfeeling cautioned him to be alone when he read it.\r\n\r\nIn the office, Mr. Steadman found a chair, and opened his paper.\r\nBertie, ever on the alert for human interest stories, watched from a\r\npoint of vantage. He told Mrs. Crocks afterwards about it.\r\n\r\n\"The paper seemed to tangle up at first and stick to his fingers. He\r\nwrastled it round and round and blew on it, and turned over pages and\r\nfolded it back--Gee, there was a lot of it. It filled the whole table,\r\nand pieces dropped on the floor. He put his foot on them, like as if\r\nhe was afraid they'd get away. At last he found something, and he just\r\nsnorted--I got as close as I could, but I couldn't see what it was.\r\nThere was a picture of a girl--and he read on and on, and snorted out\r\nthree times, and the sweat stood out on his face. Twice he cleared up\r\nhis throat like your clock does when it gets ready to strike, and\r\nthen he tore out a page of the paper and put it in his pocket, and he\r\ngathered up the rest of it and burned it, all but one sheet that was\r\nunder the table, and I got it here.\"\r\n\r\nBertie brought home the news at six o'clock. Mrs. Crocks had a copy of\r\nthe paper in her hands at six-fifteen.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, George Steadman, was feeling the need of counsel. His head\r\nswam, and a cruel sense of injustice ate into his heart. He was a\r\nquiet man--he did not deserve this. All his life he had sidestepped\r\ntrouble--and here it was staring him in the face. In desperation he\r\nwent to Driggs, the editor. He was a shrewd fellow--he would know what\r\nwas best to be done.\r\n\r\nHe found Mr. Driggs still in a sympathetic mood. He threw back his\r\nlong black hair and read the article, with many exclamations of\r\nsurprise. In places he smiled--once he laughed.\r\n\r\n\"How can any one answer this, Driggs?\" asked Mr. Steadman in alarm.\r\n\"What can be done about it? I wish you would write something about it.\r\nI can't think who would do this. There were no strangers that day at\r\nthe school--not that I noticed. None of our people would do it. What\r\ndo you think about it, Driggs? Would the girl write it herself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the editor honestly, \"I am quite sure Pearl did not do\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr. Steadman thought of the telegram and the missing man. He\r\nresolved to take Driggs into his confidence.\r\n\r\nDriggs was as quick to see the import of it as King James was to smell\r\ngunpowder on that fateful November day when the warning letter was\r\nread in Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"The Government have sent him out to investigate this in your behalf,\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n\"But where is he?\" asked Mr. Steadman.\r\n\r\nMr. Driggs' bushy brows drew down over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"There's one person can help us,\" he said. He threw on his\r\njute-colored waterproof and his faded felt hat. Mr. Steadman followed\r\nhim as he went quickly to the Horse Repository.\r\n\r\nBertie was hastily consulted, and Bertie as usual ran true.\r\n\r\n\"Sure I saw him,\" said Bertie. \"Ain't he back yet? Gee! I'll bet he's\r\nfroze! He'll be dead by now for sure. He had on awful nice clothes,\r\nbut thin toes on his boots, sharp as needles, and gray socks with dots\r\non them, and a waist on his coat like as if he wore corsets, and gray\r\ngloves--and a cane, Swell! He was some fine looker, you bet, but he\r\nwouldn't last long in that storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did he go, Bertie,\" asked Mr. Steadman, trying to hold his\r\nvoice to a tone of unconcern.\r\n\r\n\"He asked about teachers, and about how far it was to Watsons.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Driggs and Mr. Steadman's eyes met.\r\n\r\n\"If he's any place,\" said Bertie cheerfully, \"he'll be there.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Watson's Mr. Steadman and Mr. Driggs determined to go,\r\nalthough, by this time the evening was well advanced.\r\n\r\nThe storm had piled the snow into huge drifts which completely filled\r\nthe railway cuts, but fortunately for those who travelled the sleigh\r\nroads, the snow was packed so hard that horses could walk safely over\r\nit. Bridges over ravines were completely covered, people made tunnels\r\nto the doors of their stables, and in some cases had to dig the snow\r\naway from their windows to let the light in. But the sun had come\r\nout warm, and the weather prophets said it was the last storm of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Steadman and Mr. Driggs approached the Watson home, they\r\nfound every window lighted and several sleighs in the yard. From the\r\nhouse came sounds of laughter and many voices.\r\n\r\n\"There is no funeral here,\" said Mr. Driggs lightly.\r\n\r\nGeorge Steadman shuddered, \"he may never have reached here,\" he said\r\nin a voice of awe.\r\n\r\nThey knocked at the woodshed door, but no one heard them. Then they\r\nwent quietly in, and finding the kitchen door open, went in.\r\n\r\nMr. Watson, who stood at the door of the \"room,\" shook hands with them\r\nquietly, and said in a whisper:--\r\n\r\n\"They're acting tableaux now, just step up to the door and see them.\r\nThe children are having a party. Pearl will explain it in a minute.\r\nJust step in and watch; you're just in time--they're just goin' to do\r\nKing Canute.\"\r\n\r\nThe two men looked in. About a dozen young people were in the room,\r\nwhich was well lighted by a gasoline hanging-lamp. The furniture\r\nwas pushed into a corner to leave a good floor space. A curtain was\r\nsuspended from one of the beams, and behind it there seemed to be\r\ngreat activity and whispered directions. Every one was so intently\r\nwaiting, they did not notice that the audience had been augmented by\r\nthe two men at the door.\r\n\r\nIn front of the curtain came Pearl to announce the next tableaux:--\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" she said solemnly, although her audience\r\nbegan to laugh expectantly, \"we will now present to you a historical\r\ntableaux, a living picture of a foolish old king, who thought he could\r\ncommand the waves to stand still. Seated in his arm-chair on the shore\r\nyou will see King Canute. Behind him are the rugged hills of the Saxon\r\ncoast. Before him the sea tosses angrily. The tide is rolling in. Each\r\nwave is a little bigger than the last, the seventh wave being the\r\nlargest of all. This tableaux, ladies and gentlemen, in the production\r\nof which we have spared no trouble and expense, teaches the vanity of\r\nhuman greatness. Careful attention has been given to detail, as you\r\nwill observe.\"\r\n\r\nShe disappeared behind the curtain for a moment, and when it was\r\npulled back by invisible hands--(broom wire handled by Mary) she was\r\ndiscovered sitting robed in purple (one of the girls had brought her\r\nmother's Japanese dressing-gown) with a homemade but very effective\r\ncrown on her head. Her throne was an arm-chair, raised on blocks of\r\nwood. As King Canute, Pearl's eyes were eagle-like and keen, her whole\r\nbearing full of arrogance and pride. Dramatically she waved her right\r\narm towards the sea, and in bitter words chided it for its restless\r\ntossing, and commanded it to hear the words of the ALL HIGH, Great and\r\nPowerful King, and stay--just--where--it--was!\r\n\r\nBut even as she spoke, a small wave came rolling in, gently lapping\r\nthe shore. It was Danny Watson, with a small white apron tied around\r\nhis person, which at each revolution, made a white crest of breaking\r\nfoam.\r\n\r\nThe King re-doubled his imprecations, and commands, tearing his\r\nhair and threatening to rend his garments, but wave after wave came\r\nrhythmically to shore, growing in size and speed, until the seventh\r\nwave, crested with foam--a pillow-case torn across and fastened with\r\nsafety-pins--came crashing to her feet, amid thunderous applause.\r\n\r\nWhen the company, with the king at one end and the first and smallest\r\nwave at the other, stood up to take their applause, and respond to\r\ncurtain calls, next to Pearl stood the seventh wave--crested with\r\nfoam, dishevelled of hair--a four days' growth of whiskers on his\r\nface--but a happy-looking wave--nevertheless.\r\n\r\nMr. Steadman grabbed hold of his friend hysterically. He could not\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\"Well, thank God, he's not dead anyway,\" he gasped at last.\r\n\r\n\"But I fancy,\" murmured Mr. Driggs, \"that he is dead--to the cause!\"\r\n\r\n\"Make a speech, Pearl,\" cried one of the company. \"Mr. Neelands would\r\nlike to hear you do that one of the Premier's, when he laid the\r\ncornerstone, about 'the generations yet unborn.' Go on, Pearl, that's\r\na good one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't forget 'the waves of emigration breaking at our feet'!\" said\r\nMary, handing Pearl one of Teddy's coats.\r\n\r\nPearl slipped on the coat, carefully adjusting the collar. Then\r\nfingering an imaginary watch-chain, she began. Her face grew\r\ngrave--her neck seemed to thicken. Her voice was a throaty contralto.\r\n\r\n\"We are gathered here today.\" she declaimed, \"to take part in a\r\nceremonial, whose import we cannot even remotely guess! Whose full\r\nsignificance will be revealed, not in your time or mine, but to the\r\ngenerations yet unborn!\"\r\n\r\nPeter Neelands gave a shout of recognition! Mr. Driggs felt a strong\r\nhand on his arm. George Steadman whispered hoarsely. \"Come away,\r\nDriggs. That girl frightens me. This is no place for us!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spring was late, cruelly late, so late indeed that if it had been\r\nanything else but a season, it would have found itself in serious\r\ntrouble--with the door locked and a note pinned on the outside telling\r\nit if it could not come in time it need not come at all. But the\r\nSpring has to be taken in, whenever it comes--and be forgiven too, and\r\neven if there were no note on the door, there were other intimations\r\nof like effect, which no intelligent young Spring could fail to\r\nunderstand. Dead cattle lay on the river bank, looking sightlessly up\r\nto the sky. They had waited, and waited, and hung on to life just as\r\nlong as they could, but they had to give in at last.\r\n\r\nSpring came at last, brimful of excitement and apologies. It was a\r\nfull-hearted, impulsive and repentant young Spring, and lavished all\r\nits gifts with a prodigal hand; its breezes were as coaxing as June;\r\nits head burned like the first of July; its sunshine was as rich and\r\nmellow as the sunshine of August. Spring had acknowledged its debt\r\nand the overdue interest, and hoped to prevent any unpleasantness by\r\npaying all arrears and a lump sum in advance; and doing it all with\r\nsuch a flourish of good fellowship that the memory of its past\r\ndelinquency would be entirely swept away!\r\n\r\nThe old Earth, frozen-hearted and bleached by wind and cold, and\r\nsaddened by many a blighted hope, lay still and unresponsive under the\r\ncoaxing breezes and the sunshine's many promises. The Earth knew what\r\nit knew, and if it were likely to forget, the red and white cattle\r\non the hillside would remind it. The Earth knew that these same warm\r\nbreezes had coaxed it into life many times before, and it had burst\r\ninto bud and flowers and fruit, forgetting and forgiving the past with\r\nits cold and darkness, and the earth remembered that the flowers had\r\nwithered and the fruit had fallen, and dark days had come when it had\r\nno pleasure in them, and so although the sun was shining and the warm\r\nwinds blowing--the earth lay as unresponsive as the pulseless cattle\r\non its cold flat breast.\r\n\r\nBut the sun poured down its heat, and the warm breezes frolicked into\r\nthe out-of-the-way places, where old snowdrifts were hiding their\r\nblack faces, and gradually their hard hearts broke and ran away in\r\ncreeping streams, and the earth returned to the earth that gave it; a\r\nmist too, arose from the earth, and softened its bare outlines, and\r\nsoon the first anemone pushed its furry nose through the mat of gray\r\ngrass, and scored another victory on the robin; the white poplar\r\nblushed green at its roots; the willows at the edge of the river\r\nreddened higher and higher, as the sap mounted; headings of mouse-ears\r\nsoon began to show on their branches--a green, glow came over the\r\nprairie, and in the ponds, It millions of frogs, at the signal from an\r\nunknown conductor, burst into song.\r\n\r\nThen it was that the tired old Earth stopped thinking and began to\r\nfeel--a thrill--a throb--a pulsing of new life--the stirring of new\r\nhopes which mocked its fears of cold or frost or sorrow or death.\r\n\r\nThe Souris Valley opened forgiving arms to the repentant young Spring,\r\nand put forth leaves in gayest fashion. The white bones, fantastically\r\nsticking through faded red hides, were charitably hidden by the grass,\r\nso that the awakened conscience of the tender young Spring might not\r\nbe unduly reminded of its cruelty and neglect.\r\n\r\nThe woman who lived alone at Purple Springs always expected great\r\nthings of the Spring. She could not grow accustomed to the coldness of\r\nher neighbors, or believe that they had really cut her off from any\r\ncommunication, and all through the winter which had just gone she had\r\nkept on telling herself that everything would be different in the\r\nSpring. Looking day after day into the white valley, piled high with\r\nsnow, she had said to herself over and over again: \"There shall be no\r\nmore snow--there shall be no more snow\"--until the words began to mock\r\nher and taunt her, and at last lost their meaning altogether like an\r\nelastic band that has stretched too far. If she had been as close a\r\nstudent of the Bible as her mother, back in Argylshire, she would have\r\nknown that her impatience with the snow, which all winter long had\r\nthreatened and menaced her, and peered at her with its thousand eyes,\r\nwas just the same feeling that prompted John on the Isle of Patmos,\r\nwearied by the eternal breaking of the waves on his island prison, to\r\nset down as the first condition in the heavenly city: \"There shall be\r\nno sea.\"\r\n\r\nThree years before, Mrs. Gray had come to the Souris Valley, and\r\nsettled on the hill farm. It had been owned by a prospector, who once\r\nin a while lived on it, but went away for long periods, when it was\r\nbelieved he had gone north into that great unknown land of fabled\r\nriches. He had not been heard from for several years, and the people\r\nof the neighborhood had often wondered what would be done with the\r\nquarter-section, which was one of the best in the district, in case he\r\nnever came back. The Cowan's, who lives nearest, had planted one of\r\nthe fields, and used the land for the last two seasons. The Zinc's had\r\nrun their cattle in the pasture, and two of the other neighbors were\r\npreparing to use the remaining portions of the farm, when there\r\narrived Mrs. Gray and her seven-year-old son to take possession.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Cowan who demanded to know by what right she came, and when\r\nshe had convinced him by showing him the deed of the farm, she came\r\nback at him by demanding that he pay her the rent for the acres he had\r\nused, which he did with a bad grace.\r\n\r\nShe had not been long in the neighborhood when there came to\r\ndemonstrate a new sewing machine a drooping-eyed, be-whiskered man,\r\nin a slim buggy, drawn by a team of sorrel ponies. He claimed to have\r\nknown Mrs. Gray in that delightfully vague spot known as \"down East,\"\r\nand when he found how eagerly any information regarding her was\r\nreceived, he grew eloquent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cowan departed from her hard and fast rule, and the rule of her\r\nmother before her, and asked him to stay for dinner, and being an\r\nhonest man, in small matters at least, the agent did his best to pay\r\nfor his victuals. He told her all he knew--and then some, prefacing\r\nand footnoting his story with the saving clause \"Now this may be only\r\ntalk--but, anyway, it is what they said about her.\" He was not a\r\nmalicious man--he bore the woman, who was a stranger to him, no\r\ngrudge; but that day as he sat at dinner in the Cowan's big, bare\r\nkitchen, he sent out the words which made life hard for the woman at\r\nPurple Springs.\r\n\r\nSo much for the chivalry of the world and the kindly protection it\r\nextends to women.\r\n\r\nVague rumors were circulated about her, veiled, indefinite\r\ninsinuations. The Ladies' Aid decided they would not ask her to join,\r\nat least not until they saw how things were going. She might be all\r\nright, but they said a church society must be careful.\r\n\r\nThe women watched each other to see who would go to see her first. She\r\ncame to church with her boy, to the little church on the river flat,\r\nand the minister shook hands with her and told her he was glad to\r\nsee her. But the next week his wife, spending the afternoon at Mrs.\r\nCowan's, \"heard something,\" and the next Sunday, although he shook\r\nhands with her and began to say he was glad to see her, catching Mrs.\r\nCowan's eye on him, he changed his sentence and said he was glad to\r\nsee so many out.\r\n\r\nAll summer long the women at Purple Springs held to the hope that\r\nsomeone would come to see her. At first she could not believe they\r\nwere wilfully slighting her. It was just their way, she thought. They\r\nwere busy women; she often saw them out in their gardens, and at such\r\ntimes it was hard for her to keep from waving to them.\r\n\r\nThe woman who lived the nearest to her, geographically, was Mrs.\r\nCowan, and one day--the first summer--she saw Mrs. Cowan beating rugs\r\non the line, and as the day was breezy, it seemed as if she waved her\r\napron. Mrs. Gray waved back, in an ecstacy of joy and expectation--but\r\nthere came no response from her neighbor--no answering signal, and as\r\nthe lonely woman watched, hoping, looking, praying--there rolled\r\nover her with crushing sadness the conviction that all her hopes of\r\nfriendliness were in vain. The neighborhood would not receive her--she\r\nwas an outcast. They were condemning her without a hearing--they were\r\nhurling against her the thunders of silence! The injustice of it ate\r\ndeeply into her soul.\r\n\r\nThen it was that she began to make the name \"Purple Springs\" out of\r\nthe willow withes which grew below the house. She made the letters\r\nlarge, and with a flourish, and dyed them the most brilliant purple\r\nthey would take, and set them on a wire foundation above her gate. The\r\nwork of doing it gave solace to her heart, and when the words were set\r\nin place--it seemed to her that she had declared her independence,\r\nand besides, they reminded her of something very sweet and\r\nreassuring--something which helped her to hold her head up against the\r\ncurrent of ill thoughts her neighbors were directing toward her.\r\n\r\nThat was the year the school was built, and no other name for it but\r\n\"Purple Springs\" was even mentioned, and when the track was extended\r\nfrom Millford west, and a mahogany-red station built, with a tiny\r\nfreight shed of the same color, the name of Purple Springs in white\r\nletters was put on each end of the station. So, although the neighbors\r\nwould not receive the woman, they took the name she brought.\r\n\r\nHer son Jim, a handsome lad of seven, went to school the first day it\r\nwas opened. Her mother heart was fearful for the reception he might\r\nget, and yet she tried to tell herself that children were more just\r\nthan their elders. They would surely be fair to Jim, and when she\r\nhad him ready, with his leather book-bag, his neat blue serge\r\nknickerbocker suit, his white collar and well-polished boots, she\r\nthought, with a swelling of pride, that there would not be a handsomer\r\nchild in the school, nor one that was better cared for.\r\n\r\nDown the hill went Jim Gray, without a shadow on his young heart. So\r\nlong as he had his mother, and his mother smiled at him, life was all\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nHe gave his name to the teacher, and answered all her questions\r\nreadily, and was duly enrolled as a pupil in Grade I, along with\r\nBennie Cowan, Edgar Zinc and Bessie Brownlees, and set at work to make\r\nfigures. He wondered what the teacher wanted with so many figures, but\r\ndecided he would humor her, and made page after page of them for her.\r\nBy noon the teacher decided, on further investigation, to put Master\r\nJames Gray in Grade II, and by four o'clock he was a member in good\r\nstanding of Grade III.\r\n\r\nThat night there was much talk of James Gray, his good clothes, and\r\nhis general proficiency, around the firesides of the Purple Springs\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe next day Bennie Cowan, who was left behind in Grade I, although a\r\nyear older than Jim Gray, made the startling announcement:\r\n\r\n\"Jim Gray has no father.\"\r\n\r\nHe sang the words, gently intoning, as if he took no responsibility of\r\nthem any more than if they were the words of a song, for Bennie was a\r\ncautious child, and while he did not see that the absence of a father\r\nwas anything to worry over, still, from the general context of the\r\nconversation he had heard, he believed it was something of a handicap.\r\n\r\nThe person concerned in his announcement, being busy with a game of\r\nmarbles, did not notice. So quite emboldened, Bennie sang again, \"Jim\r\nGray has no father--and never had one.\"\r\n\r\nThe marble game came to an end.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean me?\" asked Jim, with a puzzled look.\r\n\r\nThe others stopped playing, too. It was a fearsome moment. Jim Gray\r\nwas the most unconcerned of the group.\r\n\r\n\"That's all you know about it,\" he said carelessly, as he shut one eye\r\nand took steady aim at the \"dib\" in the ring, \"I've had two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody can have two fathers--on earth,\" said Bessie Brownlees\r\npiously--\"we have one father on earth and one in heaven.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine ain't on earth,\" said Jimmy, \"mine are both in heaven.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a poser.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet they're not,\" said Bennie, feeling emboldened by Jim's\r\nadmission of a slight irregularity in his paternal arrangements.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" asked Jim, still puzzled. It did not occur to him\r\nthat there was anything unfriendly in the conversation--\"You never saw\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Bennie, crowded now to play his highest card, \"anyway,\r\nyour mother is a bad woman.\"\r\n\r\nJim looked at him in blank astonishment. His mother a bad woman, his\r\ndear mother! The whole world turned suddenly red to Jim Gray--he did\r\nnot need any one to tell him that the time had come to fight.\r\n\r\nThe cries of Bennie Cowan brought the teacher flying. Bennie, with\r\nbleeding lip and blackened eyes, was rescued, and a tribunal sat\r\nforthwith on the case.\r\n\r\nJames Gray refused to tell what Bennie Cowan had said. His tongue\r\ncould not form the words of blasphemy. The other children, all of whom\r\nhad heard his history unfavorably discussed at home, did not help him,\r\nand the case went against the boy who had no friends. Exaggerated\r\ntales were told of his violence. By the end of the week he had struck\r\nBennie Cowan with a knife. A few days later it was told that he had\r\nkicked the teacher. Nervous mothers were afraid to have their children\r\nexposed to the danger of playing with such a vicious child.\r\n\r\nOne day a note was given to him to take home. It was from the\r\ntrustees, asking Mrs. Gray if she would kindly keep her son James at\r\nhome, for his ungovernable temper made it unsafe for other children to\r\nplay with him.\r\n\r\nThat was three years ago. Annie Gray and her son were as much a\r\nmystery as ever. She looked well, dressed well, rode astride, wore\r\nbloomers, and used a rifle, and seemed able to live without either the\r\nconsent or good-will of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn harvest time she still further outraged public opinion by keeping\r\na hired man, who, being a virtuous man, who had respect for public\r\nopinion, even if she hadn't, claimed fifteen dollars a month extra for\r\na sort of moral insurance against loss of reputation. She paid the\r\nmoney so cheerfully that the virtuous man was sorry he had not made it\r\ntwenty!\r\n\r\nIt was to this district, with its under-current of human passions,\r\nmystery and misunderstanding, that Pearl Watson came. The miracle of\r\nSpring was going on--bare trees budding, dead flowers springing; the\r\nriver which had been a prisoner all winter, running brimming full,\r\nits ice all gone, and only little white cakes of foam riding on its\r\ncurrent. Over all was the pervading Spring smell of fresh earth, and\r\nthe distant smoulder of prairie fires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF THE HOUSE OF CLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the train came in from the west, Dr. Clay stepped off and walked\r\nquickly to his office. He called at the drug store before going to his\r\nprivate office, and inquired of the clerk:\r\n\r\n\"Any one wanting me, Tommy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure--two or three--but nothing serious. Bill Snedden wanted you to\r\ncome out and see his horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"See his horse!\" exclaimed the doctor in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Democracy hasn't been feeling well. Just sort of mopin' around\r\nthe stall. Not sick--just out of sorts, you know, down-hearted like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, why doesn't he get Dr. Moody? Horses are not my line.\"\r\n\r\n\"O but he says this is different. Democracy is more like a human being\r\nthan a horse, and Dr. Moody don't know much about a horse's higher\r\nnature. He says he's scared to have Dr. Moody come out anyway--every\r\ntime he comes, a horse dies, and he's gettin' superstitious about it.\r\nT'aint that he has anything against Dr. Moody. He spoke well of him\r\nand said he was nice to have around in time of trouble, he's so\r\nsympathetic and all that, but he don't want to take any chances with\r\nDemocracy. He would have liked awful well to see you, doctor. I told\r\nhim you'd be home tonight, and he'll give you a ring. No, there was\r\nnothing serious. There was a young fellow here from the city came out\r\nto see Pearl Watson, they said, about some set of books or something.\r\nHe got lost in the storm, and frozen pretty badly. He's out at Watsons\r\nyet, I think. But they didn't phone, or anything--at least, I didn't\r\nget it. I just heard about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Tommy,\" said the doctor, and went on.\r\n\r\nIn his own apartment he found everything in order. Telephone messages\r\nwere laid beside his mail. His slippers and house-coat were laid out.\r\nThe coal fire gleamed its welcome.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's heart was lighter than it had been. His interview with\r\nthe old doctor had been very encouraging.\r\n\r\n\"You are looking better, Clay,\" the old man had said. \"Have you gained\r\nin weight? I thought so. You are going a little easier, and sleeping\r\nout--that's right. And you see you can save yourself in lots of\r\nways--don't you? Good! I'm pleased with you. I hear they are after you\r\nto run against the Government. You won't touch it, of course. No good\r\nfor a man in your condition. Anyway, a doctor has his own work--and if\r\nyou keep your head down, and get away every winter, you'll live to be\r\nan old man yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor sat down to read his mail. There were the usual letters\r\nfrom old patients, prospective patients, people who had wonderful\r\nremedies and had been cruelly snubbed by the medical profession. He\r\nglanced through them casually, but with an absentmindedness which did\r\nnot escape his housekeeper when she came in.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burns was determined to tell him something, so determined, that\r\nas soon as she entered, he felt it coming. He knew that was why she\r\ncame. The bluff of asking him if he got his telephone messages was too\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nMrs. Burns was a sad looking woman, with a tired voice. It was not\r\nthat Mrs. Burns was tired or sad, but in that part of the East from\r\nwhich she had come, all the better people spoke in weary voices of\r\nladylike weakness.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mrs. Burns,\" the doctor said, \"what has happened today?\" He\r\nknew he was going to get it anyway--so he might as well ask for it.\r\n\r\n\"George Steadman was in an awful state about the young fellow who came\r\nout from the city to see Pearl Watson. He got lost in the storm, and\r\nstayed three days at Paines, and then Pearl came over and took him\r\nhome with her. Some say the Government sent him about the piece in the\r\npaper, and some say he's her beau. I don't know. Mrs. Crocks saw Pearl\r\nwhen she brought him in, and she could get nothing out of her. He's at\r\nthe hotel still, though nobody seems to know what his business is.\"\r\n\r\n\"O well,\" laughed the doctor, \"we'll just have to watch him. Don't\r\nleave washings on the line, and lock our doors--he can't scare us.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Burns afterwards told Mrs. Crocks that \"Doctor Clay can be\r\nvery light at times, and it seems hardly the thing, considering his\r\nprofession.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Burns could never quite forgive herself for leaving so early that\r\nnight, and almost lost her religion, because no still small voice\r\nprompted her to stay. Just as she left the office, the young man, the\r\nmysterious stranger, came to the door, and Mrs. Burns knew there was\r\nno use going back through the drug store and listening at the door.\r\nThe doctor had heavy curtains at each door in his office, and had a\r\nway of leaving the key in the door, that cut off the last hope. So she\r\nwent home in great heaviness of spirit.\r\n\r\nP.J. Neelands presented his card, and was given a leather chair\r\nbeside the fire. He asked the doctor if he might smoke, and was given\r\npermission.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to talk to you in confidence, Doctor Clay,\" he said,\r\nnervously. \"I guess you're used to that.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded encouragingly: \"That's what doctors are for. Go\r\nright on, Mr. Neelands.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact of the matter is--I'm in love,\" said Peter, taking the head\r\nplunge first.\r\n\r\n\"O that's nothing,\" said the doctor. \"I mean--that's nothing to worry\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she does not care a hang for me. In fact, she laughs at me.\"\r\n\r\nPeter's face was clouded in perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"But I'll begin at the beginning: I belong to the Young Men's\r\nPolitical Club in the city, and I was sent out here--at least, I\r\nmean I asked to come on a delicate mission. I'm speaking to you\r\nconfidentially, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the doctor, \"have no fears.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps you saw this.\" He produced the article that had caused\r\nthe fluttering in the Governmental nest.\r\n\r\nThe doctor suddenly came to attention.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know who wrote it? No! Well anyway, I came out to see about\r\nit--to investigate--look over the ground. But, doctor, I got the\r\nsurprise of my life. This girl is a wonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" the doctor's sympathetic manner had gone. He was sitting\r\nup very straight in his chair now, and his eyes were snapping with\r\nsuppressed excitement. \"What did you think you could do about it? Did\r\nyou think you could stop her--hush her up--or scare her--or bribe\r\nher--or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know,\" said Peter honestly. \"But I want to tell you what\r\nhappened. I was three days at Paine's--caught by the storm--do you\r\nknow them? Well, it's a good place to go to see what women are up\r\nagainst. I was mad enough to throw old Paine out of his own house, and\r\nI found out he was going to sell the farm over her head, and By Jove!\r\nI see why the women want to vote, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always seen why,\" replied the doctor. \"I thought every one with\r\nany intelligence could see the justice of it.\" The doctor's manner was\r\nlosing its friendliness, but Peter, intent on his own problems, did\r\nnot resent it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, just when this man Gilchrist came to sign the papers, the\r\nmorning I left, she came in--Pearl Watson, I mean--and Doctor, I\r\nnever heard anything like it. Talk about pleading a case! She did not\r\nplead--she just reviewed the case--she put it up to Gilchrist--it was\r\nmarvellous! If she had asked me to shoot the two of them, I would\r\nhave done it. She had me--she has me yet--she's the most charming,\r\nsweet-souled and wonderful girl I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor endeavored to speak calmly:\r\n\r\n\"Well, what about it?\" he said. \"I agree with you--she is all of\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going back to resign from the party. I am going to throw my\r\nweight on the other side,\" Peter spoke with all the seriousness\r\nof youth. \"The girl has shown me what a beastly, selfish lot the\r\npoliticians are, and I am going back to denounce them, if they won't\r\nchange. But I want to ask you something, Doctor--you won't think I am\r\ncheeky, will you? She gave me absolutely no hope--but girl's sometimes\r\nchange their minds. I would wait for years for her. I simply can't\r\nlive without her. I thought from the way she spoke there was some\r\none else--if there is--I will just crawl away and die--I can't live\r\nwithout her!\"\r\n\r\n\"O shut up,\" said the doctor impatiently. \"Better men than you have to\r\nlive without--the women they love--that's foolish talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell me, doctor,\" cried Peter desperately, \"I just have to\r\nknow. Is there any reason why I can't hope to win her? Do you know of\r\nany reason--you know Pearl well. Is there any reason that you know of?\r\nHas any one any right--to stop me from trying?\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor considered. Here was just the situation he had told Pearl\r\nhe hoped would arise. This young fellow was clean, honest, and there\r\nwas no doubt of his deep sincerity. He had told Pearl she must forget\r\nhim. He had tried to mean it, and here it was--here was the very\r\nsituation he said he hoped for. He would play up--he could make\r\nhimself do what was right, no matter how he felt.\r\n\r\nHe heard himself say mechanically:\r\n\r\n\"There is no reason, Mr. Neelands; Pearl is free to decide. No one has\r\nthe smallest claim on her.\"\r\n\r\nPeter sprang up and caught his hand, wondering why it should be so\r\ncold. He also wondered at the flush which burned on the doctor's\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, old man,\" he cried impulsively, \"I cannot tell you how I\r\nthank you. You have rolled a house off me--and now, tell me you wish\r\nme well--I want your good word.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor took his outstretched hand, with an effort.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you well,\" he said slowly, in a voice that was like a shadow\r\nof his own.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter had gone, the doctor rose and paced the floor.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a liar and a hypocrite,\" he said bitterly. \"I don't wish him\r\nwell. I said what was not so when I said I hoped to see her married\r\nto some one else--I don't--I want her myself. I can't give her up! I\r\nwon't give her up!\"\r\n\r\nThe next morning, before the doctor started to make his calls, Robert\r\nGilchrist, President of the Political Club, came to see him, again.\r\n\r\n\"I am not satisfied with that interview we had with you, doctor,\" he\r\nsaid, \"the day the organizer was here. That fellow made a mess of\r\neverything, and I don't blame you for turning it down. But I tell you,\r\nthere's more in it than this fellow thinks. There is a real moral\r\nissue to be decided, and I am here to admit I've had a new look at\r\nthings in the last few days. I am going into the city to see our\r\nleader, and I want to see how he feels. But, doctor, some of our laws\r\nare simply disgraceful; they've got to be changed.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on to tell the doctor of the day he went to buy Sylvester\r\nPaine's farm.\r\n\r\n\"I never felt any meaner than when Pearl told me what it meant, and\r\nwhat I was doing. Doctor, if you had seen the look in Mrs. Paine's\r\nface when Pearl was putting it up to me; Lord, it was tragic. It was\r\nas if her hope of Heaven was in dispute, and didn't Pearl put it to\r\nme? Say, doctor, that girl can swing an election. No one can resist\r\nher arguments--she's so fair about everything--no one can get away\r\nfrom her arguments. The reason these laws have been left the way they\r\nare, is that no one knows about them. Did you know that a man can sell\r\neverything, and do what he likes with the money, no matter what his\r\nwife says--and did you know a man can take his children away from the\r\nmother--Did you know about these?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said the doctor, \"in a vague way. Fortunately they do not\r\noften come up--men are better than the laws--and they would need to\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, doctor, I'll tell you what I want to say. I believe it is your\r\nduty to run. The women need a few members there to stick up for them.\r\nPearl thinks our party is all right too--she says they'll grant the\r\nvote--if they get in--and she was at the big meeting where the women\r\nasked them to make it a plank in their platform. She says some of\r\nthe old hide-bound politicians gagged a little, but they swallowed\r\nit--they had to.\" \"I wish you could hear Pearl talk, doctor. She\r\nseemed disappointed when I told her you weren't going to run.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't thought of any one else, Bob?\" the doctor asked, after a\r\npause. \"You wouldn't consider it yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any one else but you will surely lose his deposit. The bridge at\r\nPurple Springs will hold them over there, and they have taken off a\r\nslice on the east of the riding and put it in Victoria--where it is\r\nsure to go against the Government anyway. No, this will go to Steadman\r\nby acclamation, unless you let us nominate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll reconsider,\" said the doctor, \"and phone you inside of\r\ntwenty-four hours.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gilchrist had gone, the doctor sat with his hands behind his\r\nhead. His eyes were very bright, and a flush mantled his cheek. His\r\nheart thumped so hard, he could hear it.\r\n\r\n\"Keep away from excitement, Clay,\" he could hear the old doctor\r\nsaying, \"excitement eats up your energy and does not give the builders\r\na chance. With care, and patience, you may win--but if you will not\r\nsave yourself, and nurse yourself, and go slow--you are a dead man!\"\r\n\r\nHe pressed his hands tightly to his head.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl had been disappointed,\" Bob had said. It would be a disgrace to\r\nlet this riding go by default. There was the liquor question which had\r\nhung fire for fourteen years, while the Government had simply played\r\nwith it, and laughed at the temperance people. If women had the vote,\r\nwhat a power Pearl would be!\r\n\r\nStill, one vote in Parliament was nothing--one man could do but\r\nlittle--and besides, the old doctor had found him improved--he might\r\nbe able to beat out the disease yet--by being careful. A campaign\r\nwould mean late hours, long drives, meeting people--making\r\nspeeches--which he hated--the worst kind of excitement--to move a vote\r\nof thanks tired him more than a week's work.\r\n\r\nStill, Pearl would be pleased--he hadn't done much for Pearl. He had\r\nwon her love--and then had to turn it away--and had seen those eyes of\r\nher's cloud in disappointment. It had been a raw deal.\r\n\r\nLooking through the window, he saw Bertie, with his team, waiting\r\noutside the door. He was letting Bertie take full care of his horses\r\nnow, and saving himself in that way.\r\n\r\nThe sorrel horse on the side next him tossed his head, and chewed the\r\nbit, with a defiant air that set waves of memory in motion. He had\r\nbought this fine four-year-old, because he had reminded him of old\r\nPrince--the same color--the same markings, and the same hard mouth and\r\ndefiant red eye.\r\n\r\nUsually, he did not keep Bertie waiting--but this morning it did not\r\nmatter--there were other things to be decided. The sorrel horse seemed\r\nto be looking at him through the office window.\r\n\r\n\"There was another sorrel horse to take your place, Prince,\" said the\r\ndoctor, looking at the big sorrel, but thinking of his predecessor;\r\n\"although that did not influence you in any way--you left that to me\r\nto find out--you considered that my business. I believe I will be safe\r\nin leaving it to some one higher up to get another doctor to take my\r\nplace--doctors--and sorrel horses--there are plenty of them. You had\r\nthe right philosophy, Prince. No one else could have saved the woman's\r\nlife--so you did that--and let me rustle for another horse. I'll do\r\nthe same--after all--it is not individuals who count--it is the race.\r\nWe do our bit--and pass on. Straight ahead of me seems to be a piece\r\nof work I can do--and if I have to pay for the privilege of doing\r\nit--I'll pay--without regrets.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached for the telephone, and called Mr. Gilchrist.\r\n\r\n\"Hello Bob,\" he said steadily, \"I've reached a decision. No, it didn't\r\ntake me long. Yes, I will. I'll accept the nomination. All right\r\nBob--I hope so. Thank you for your good opinion--All right.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nPETER'S REPORT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Peter J. Neelands returned to the city, he sought an interview\r\nwith his Chief. It was a bold stroke, Mr. Neelands knew, but the\r\ncircumstances warranted it. He must lay the matter before his superior\r\nofficer; as a loyal member of the party, he must bring in a warning.\r\nHe must make the Government understand.\r\n\r\nThe old leader was one of the most approachable of men, genial,\r\nkindly, friendly. The interview was arranged without difficulty, and\r\nPeter, with his heart beating uncomfortably, was shown by the old\r\nretainer who kept guard in the outside office through the blue velvet\r\nhangings into the Chief's private office.\r\n\r\nAt a long oaken table, on which were scattered a few trade journals\r\nand newspapers, he found the great man. An unlighted cigar was in his\r\nmouth, and he sat leaning back in a revolving chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Peter, my son--how are you?\" he said gaily, extending his hand.\r\n\"And so you feel you must see the old man on business of importance,\r\nvital importance to our country's welfare. That's good; glad to see\r\nyou, take a chair beside me and tell uncle who hit you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief was a man of perhaps sixty years of age, of florid\r\ncountenance, red mustache, turning gray, splendidly developed\r\nforehead, dark gray eyes with wire-like wrinkles radiating from them,\r\nwhich seemed to have been caused more by laughter than worry; a big,\r\nfriendly voice of great carrying power, and a certain bluff, good\r\nfellowship about him which marked him as a man who was born to rule\r\nhis fellowmen, but to do it very pleasantly.\r\n\r\nPeter was complimented to be received so cordially. He was sure he\r\ncould make this genial, courteous, kindly old gentleman see certain\r\nquestions from a new view-point. He must see it.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you have heard of a girl at Millford who is making somewhat\r\nof a stir along the lines of the Woman Suffrage question,\" Peter\r\nbegan.\r\n\r\nThe great man nodded, and having begun to nod, absent-mindedly\r\ncontinued, much to Peter's discomfiture. Peter hastily reviewed the\r\ncase, though he could see his listener was bored exceedingly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what I want you to do, sir,\" he said earnestly, \"is this. Let\r\nthis girl come and address the members of the Government and the\r\nLegislature--I mean our members--privately, of course. Let her show\r\nyou the woman's side of the question. I know, sir, you turned them\r\ndown when the delegation came, but a man can always change his mind.\r\nThe thing is inevitable; the vote is coming. If this Government does\r\nnot give it--the Government will go down to defeat.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chief stopped nodding, and the amiability of his face began to\r\ncloud over. He sat up very suddenly and spread his plump hands on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"The Opposition have endorsed Woman Suffrage, sir,\" said Peter\r\nearnestly. \"They are making it a plank in their platform.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure they have,\" cried the Premier, with a laugh, \"sure they have.\r\nThey are big enough fools to endorse anything! What do we care what\r\nthey endorse?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want to get this over to you, Mr. Graham, that we are losing\r\nour opportunity to do a big thing, something that will live in\r\nhistory, if we fail to give women the vote. Women are human, they have\r\na right to a voice in their own government, and if you would just let\r\nthis girl come out and talk to you--and the members.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Peter,\" said the great man tolerantly, \"I like\r\nenthusiasm--the world is built on it. But I'm an old man now, and have\r\nbeen a long time dealing with the public and with politics. Politics\r\nis a dirty mess--it's no place for women, and I certainly do not\r\nneed to be instructed by any eighteen-year-old girl, pleasant as the\r\nprocess might be. I believe all you say about her--and her charm. You\r\nhad better go and marry her--if you want to.\"\r\n\r\nPeter's face colored. \"I would be very happy to do so, but she turned\r\nme down, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be discouraged, lad; a woman's 'no' generally means 'yes',\"\r\nsaid his Chief. \"Now, even if she could talk like the Angel Gabriel, I\r\nwon't let her at the members of this Government--I'll tell you why.\r\nI have these fellows trotting easy. They're good boys--they do as\r\nthey're told. Now what's the use of getting them excited and confused.\r\nPeter, you know how it is with the Indians--in their wild state,\r\neating rabbits and digging roots--they're happy, aren't they? Sure\r\nthey are. If you bring them into town, show them street-cars and shop\r\nwindows and take them to theatres, you excite them and upset them,\r\nthat's all. O no, Peter, I'll take no chances on spoiling my\r\nsimple-hearted country members by turning loose this orb-eyed young\r\ncharmer who has thrown you clean off your trolley.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, sir, consider the case yourself; won't you admit, sir, that the\r\nlaws are fearfully unjust to women?\" Peter began to explain, but the\r\nPremier interrupted:\r\n\r\n\"Peter, the world is very old; certain things are established by\r\nusage, and the very fact that this is so argues that it should be so.\r\nWomen are weaker than men--I did not make them so--God made them so.\r\nHe intended them to be subject to men. Don't get excited over it. It\r\nsounds well to talk about equality--but there's no such thing. It did\r\nnot exist in God's mind, so why should we try to bring it about? No,\r\nno, Peter, women are subject to men, and always will be. It would\r\nnot do to make them independent in the eyes of the law, independent\r\neconomically. If they were they would not marry. Look at the women\r\nin the States--where in some places they vote--look at the type that\r\ndevelops. What does it bring?--race-suicide, divorce--free love. I'm\r\nan old-fashioned man, Peter, I believe in the home.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" said Peter, \"with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\nThe great man began to show signs of impatience.\r\n\r\n\"Before I go,\" said Peter earnestly, \"let me make one more appeal to\r\nyou. This is a live issue. It cannot be dismissed by a wave of the\r\nhand. Will you listen to a debate on it--will you let it be discussed\r\nin your hearing?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man considered a moment--then he said:\r\n\r\n\"This will wear off you, Peter. I, too, have been young. I understand.\r\nForget it, boy, and get back to normal. No, I will not hear it\r\ndiscussed. I know all about it--all I want to know. I don't know why\r\nI am wasting so much time on you and your particular type of\r\nfoolishness, Peter. I have people like you seeing me every day.\r\nUsually they are dealt with by Mr. Price, in the outer office. He has\r\norders to put the can on them and open the door. O no, Peter, there\r\nwill be no radical measures while I sit at the helm--I am too old to\r\nchange my mind.\"\r\n\r\nPeter began to put on his gloves. The older man held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Well, good-bye, Peter,\" he said kindly, \"come again--come any\r\ntime--always glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not be back,\" said Peter quietly, \"this is good-bye. If I\r\ncannot show you that you are wrong, I will go out and help the women\r\nto show the people that you are wrong. Pearl says if the Premier is\r\ntoo old to change his mind we will do the next best thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Change the Premier,\" Peter replied, steadily.\r\n\r\nThe old man laughed, with uproarious mirth.\r\n\r\n\"Peter, you're funny, all right; you're rich; I always did enjoy the\r\nprattle of children, but I can't fool away any more time on you--so\r\nrun along and sell your papers.\"\r\n\r\nPeter went through the blue velvet hangings, past the worthy henchman,\r\nwho sat dozing in his chair, and made his way to the front door. The\r\nmural decorations in the corridor caught his eye--the covered wagon,\r\ndrawn by oxen plodding patiently into the sunset--the incoming\r\nsettlers of the pioneer days.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if the women did not do their full share of that,\" he\r\nthought. \"They worked, suffered, hoped, endured--and made the country\r\nwhat it is. I wonder how any man has the nerve to deny them a voice in\r\ntheir own affairs.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Peter was taking his departure, and before he had reached the\r\nfront gate, one of the many bells which flanked the Premier's table\r\nwas wildly rung.\r\n\r\n\"Send Banks to me,\" he said crisply, to the lackey who appeared.\r\n\r\nThe genial mood had gone; his brows were clamped low over his eyes. He\r\nhad chewed the end off his cigar.\r\n\r\n\"Every time the women raise ructions it sets me thinking of her. I\r\nwonder what became of her,\" he murmured. \"The ground seems to have\r\nswallowed her. She might have known I did not mean it; but women don't\r\nreason--they just feel.\"\r\n\r\nThe news of P.J. Neelands' resignation from the Young Men's Political\r\nClub made a ripple of excitement in Government circles, and brought\r\nforth diverse comments.\r\n\r\n\"There's a girl in it, I hear,\" said one of the loungers at the Maple\r\nLeaf Club; \"some pretty little suffragette has won over our Peter.\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not deny it,\" said another, \"he'll tell you the whole\r\nstory--and believe me, Peter is an enthusiastic supporter of the\r\nwomen's cause now. I see in this morning's paper he made a speech for\r\nthem last night called 'The Chivalry of the Law.' Peter has the blood\r\nof the martyrs in him for sure--for he was in a straight line for the\r\nnomination here in 'Centre.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter Neelands makes me tired,\" said a third gloomily. \"Why does he\r\nneed to get all fussed up over the laws relating to women--they have\r\ntoo much liberty now--they can swear away a man's character--that's\r\none thing I'd like to see changed. It's dangerous, I tell you.\"\r\n\r\nThe first man finished the discussion:\r\n\r\n\"I always liked Peter, and am sorry he's quit us. He'll have a\r\nfollowing, too, just because he does believe in himself.\"\r\n\r\nThough the loungers at the Maple Leaf Club took the news of Peter\r\nNeeland's secession with composure, mingled with amusement, the chief\r\norganizer, Mr. Banks, viewed it with alarm, and voiced his fears to\r\nthe head of his department, who sat in his accustomed chair, with a\r\nbottle of the best beside him. The Honorable member listened, but\r\nrefused to be alarmed. It was past the third hour of the afternoon,\r\nand the rainbow haze was over everything.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you,\" said Mr. Banks, \"something is going to break if we\r\ncan't get this thing stopped. The women are gaining every day. Their\r\nmeetings are getting bigger, and now look at Peter Neelands. This\r\nWatson girl has got to be canned--got rid of--if we have to send her\r\nto do immigration work in London, England.\"\r\n\r\nThe honorable member did his best to hold his head steady.\r\n\r\n\"Do what you like, Banks,\" he said thickly, \"only save the country.\r\nMy country if she's right; my country if she's wrong; but always my\r\ncountry! 'Lives there a man with soul so dead,' eh, Banks? That's the\r\ndope--what? Damn the women--but save the home--we gotta' save the\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nOliver Banks looked at him in deep contempt, and shook his head.\r\n\"These birds make things hard for us,\" he murmured. \"He looks like a\r\nMinister of the Crown now, doesn't he? Lord! wouldn't he make a sight\r\nfor the women! I'd like to hear their description of him just as he\r\nsits now.\"\r\n\r\nThe minister sat with his pudgy hands spread out on the arms of his\r\nchair. His head rolled uncertainly, like a wilting sunflower on a\r\nbroken stalk. His under lip was too full to fit his face. If he had\r\nbeen a teething infant one would have been justified in saying he was\r\ndrooling.\r\n\r\nThe organizer called a waiter and instructed him to phone to the\r\ngentleman's house and speak to his chauffeur.\r\n\r\n\"Tell him to take the old man home,\" he said briefly, \"he seems to\r\nbe--overtaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir,\" said the waiter, without a flicker of an eyelash.\r\n\r\nThen the organizer went to a telephone booth and called George\r\nSteadman, of Millford, requesting him to come at once to the city on\r\nimportant business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN OF PURPLE SPRINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of us has lived long without discovering that everything he\r\nhas he pays for; that every gain has a corresponding loss; that a\r\ndevelopment even of one of our own faculties, is at the expense of\r\nthe others. The wild wheat is small and dwarfed in size in its native\r\nstate, but very hardy. Under persistent cultivation it grows bigger\r\nand more productive, but, unfortunately, susceptible to the frost. The\r\nwild rabbit when domesticated grows bigger and more beautiful, but\r\nloses his speed and cleverness. So it is all through life--it all\r\ncomes in the bill--we cannot escape the day of reckoning.\r\n\r\nIf Pearl Watson had not had a taste for political speeches and\r\ndebates; if she had read the crochet patterns in the paper instead of\r\nthe editorials, and had spent her leisure moments making butterfly\r\nmedallions for her camisoles, or in some other ladylike pursuit,\r\ninstead of leaning over the well-worn railing around the gallery of\r\nthe Legislative Assembly, in between classes at the Normal, she would\r\nhave missed much; but she would have gained something too.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, she would have had an easier time getting a\r\nboarding-house in the Purple Springs District, and would not be\r\nstanding looking disconsolately out at the Spring sunshine, one day at\r\nthe end of April, wondering, with a very sore heart, why nobody wanted\r\nto give her board and shelter. It was a new and painful sensation for\r\nPearl, and it cut deeply.\r\n\r\nMrs. Zinc could not keep her beyond May the first, for relatives were\r\ncoming from the East. Mrs. Cowan could not take her, for she had too\r\nmuch to do as it was--and could not get help that wasn't more trouble\r\nthan it was worth. They would waste more than their wages, and what\r\nthey did not waste they would steal. Mrs. Cowan's tongue was unloosed\r\nby the memory of her wrongs, and it was half an hour before Pearl\r\ncould get away. Mrs. Cowan had surely suffered many things at the\r\nhands of help of all nationalities. She had got them from employment\r\nbureaus, government and private; from the Salvation Army and from\r\nprivate friends in the old country. Her help had come from everywhere\r\nexcept from the Lord! No indeed, she couldn't take any one to board.\r\n\r\nA careful canvass of the neighborhood had resulted in disappointment;\r\nnot one home was available. Embarrassment had sat on the faces of many\r\nof the women when they talked with her about it, and Pearl was quick\r\nto see that there was something back of it all, and the antagonism of\r\nthe unknown lay heavily on her heart.\r\n\r\nThe yellow Spring sun, like liquid honey, fell in benediction on the\r\nleafless trees, big with buds, and on the tawny mat of grass through\r\nwhich the blue noses of anemones were sticking. Cattle eagerly cropped\r\nthe dead grass and found it good, and men were at work in the fields.\r\nThey all had homes and beds, Pearl thought, with a fresh burst of\r\nhomelessness.\r\n\r\nShe had prepared her blackboards for the next day, and made her desk\r\ntidy, and was just about to leave for the day and walk the mile to\r\nMrs. Howser's to see if she could make it her abiding place, when\r\nBessie Cowan came running with a letter.\r\n\r\n\"Please, teacher,\" said Bessie, out of breath from running, \"Ma\r\nthought this might be an important letter, and you should have it\r\nright away. It came in our mail.\"\r\n\r\nPearl took it, wonderingly. It bore the official seal of the\r\nDepartment of Education. Only once had she received such a letter, and\r\nthat was when she received permission to attend the Normal. When she\r\nopened it, she read:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Madam:--You have been recommended to us by the Principal of the\r\nNormal School for special work required by this Department, and we\r\nwill be pleased to have you come to our office inside of the next week\r\nfor instructions. We will pay you a salary of one hundred dollars a\r\nmonth, and travelling expenses, and we believe you will find the work\r\ncongenial. Kindly reply as soon as possible.\"\r\n\r\nPearl's heart was throbbing with excitement. Here was a way of escape\r\nfrom surroundings which, for some unknown reason, were uncomfortable\r\nand unfriendly.\r\n\r\nBessie Cowan watched her closely, but said not a word. Bessie was a\r\nfair-skinned little girl, with eyes far apart, and a development of\r\nforehead which made her profile resemble a rabbit's.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Bessie\" said Pearl, \"I am glad to have this.\" She sat\r\nat her desk and began to write. Bessie ran home eagerly to tell her\r\nmother how the letter had been received.\r\n\r\nPearl decided to write an acceptance, and to 'phone home to her mother\r\nbefore sending it.\r\n\r\nWhen the letter was written she sat in a pleasant dream, thinking of\r\nthe new world that had opened before her. \"Travelling expenses,\" had a\r\nsweet sound in her young ears--she would go from place to place,\r\nmeet new people, and all the time be learning something--learning\r\nsomething--and forgetting.\r\n\r\nPearl winced a little when she recalled Mrs. Crock's words when she\r\ncame through Millford on her way to Purple Springs:\r\n\r\n\"The doctor should be the candidate, but I guess Miss Keith won't let\r\nhim. They say he's holdin' off to run for the Dominion House next\r\nFall. You maybe could coax him to run, Pearl. Have you seen him\r\nlately? Miss Keith was down twice last week, and he went up for\r\nSunday. It looks as if they were keepin' close company--oh well, he's\r\nold enough to know his own mind, and it will be nice to have the\r\nSenator's daughter livin' here. It would give a little style to the\r\nplace, and that's what we're short of. But it's nothing to me--I don't\r\ncare who he marries!\"\r\n\r\nPearl had hurried away without answering. Mrs. Crocks' words seemed\r\nto darken the sun, and put the bite of sharp ice in the gentle spring\r\nbreeze. Instead of forgetting him, every day of silence seemed to lie\r\nheavier on her heart; but one thing Pearl had promised herself--she\r\nwould not mope--she would never cry over it!\r\n\r\nShe read the letter over and tried to picture what it would mean. A\r\nglow of gratitude warmed her heart when she thought of the Normal\r\nSchool Principal and his kindness in recommending her. She would\r\nfulfil his hopes of her, too. She would do her work well. She would\r\nlose herself in her work, and forget all that had made her lonely and\r\nmiserable. It was a way of escape--the Lord was going to let her down\r\nover the wall in a basket.\r\n\r\nThere was a very small noise behind her, a faint movement as if a\r\nmouse had crossed the threshold.\r\n\r\nShe turned quickly, and gave a cry of surprise and delight.\r\n\r\nAt the door, shyly looking in at her, was a little boy of perhaps ten\r\nyears of age, with starry eyes of such brilliance and beauty she could\r\nsee no other feature. He looked like a little furry squirrel, who\r\nwould be frightened by the slightest sound.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they looked at each other; then from the boy, in a\r\ntrembling voice, clear and high pitched, came the words:\r\n\r\n\"Please, teacher!\"\r\n\r\nThe tremble in his voice went straight to Pearl's heart.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear,\" she said, \"come right in--I want you--I'm lonesome--and I\r\nlike little boys like you.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes seemed to grow more luminous and wistful.\r\n\r\n\"I can't come in,\" he said. \"I can't come into the school at all--not\r\nthe least little bit--I have an ungovernable temper.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid,\" said Pearl gravely, \"I am very brave that way, and\r\ndon't mind at all. Who says you have?\"\r\n\r\n\"The trustees,\" he said and his voice began to quiver. \"They sent\r\nmother a letter about me.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I know you now, James,\" said Pearl, \"come in--I want to talk to\r\nyou. I was going to see you just as soon as I got settled.\"\r\n\r\nCautiously he entered; the out-door wildness was in his graceful\r\nmovements. He stooped a few feet away from her and said again:\r\n\r\n\"Please, teacher.\"\r\n\r\nPearl smiled back, reassuringly, and his eyes responded.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get a place yet?\" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn't,\" she answered. She was going to tell him that she would\r\nnot need a place, for she was going away, but something stopped her.\r\nSomehow she could not dim the radiance of those eager eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Teacher!\" he cried coming nearer, \"would you come and live with us?\r\nMy mother is just sweet, and she would like to have you. She is away\r\ntoday, to Millford, and won't be home till eight o'clock. I stayed at\r\nhome because I wanted to see you. My mother watched you going to the\r\nhouses--we can see all of them from our house--and every time you\r\ncame away from them--she was glad. We have a spy-glass, and we could\r\nsee--that's how we knew how nice you were, teacher\"--he was almost\r\nnear enough to touch her now. \"You can have my bed if you will come.\"\r\n\r\nPearl wanted to draw him to her and kiss the fear forever from his\r\nface, but she was still afraid he might vanish if she touched him.\r\n\r\n\"My mother thinks you are nice,\" he said softly. \"We saw you patting\r\nCowan's dog and walking home with the children. One day we saw you\r\nwalking home with Edgar Zinc. He held your hand--and my mother got to\r\nthinking that it might have been me that you had by the hand, and\r\nshe cried that day, and couldn't tell why. It wasn't because she was\r\nlonely--because she never is lonely. How could she be when she has me?\r\nShe tells me every day she is not lonely. But we'd like fine to have\r\nyou live with us, teacher, because you're nice.\"\r\n\r\nPearl's arm was around him now, and he let her draw him over to her.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me all about yourself,\" she said, with a curious tugging at her\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"We're orphans,\" he said simply, \"mother and I--that means our people\r\nare dead. We had no people, only just our daddy. We didn't need any\r\npeople only him, and he's dead. And then we had Mr. Bowen--and he's\r\ndead. Don't it beat all how people die? Are you an orphan?\"\r\n\r\nPearl shook her head.\r\n\r\nJames continued: \"We're waiting here until I get bigger and mother\r\ngets enough money--and then we're going back. It's lovely to be going\r\nback. This isn't the real Purple Springs--we just called it that for\r\nfun, and because we love the name. It makes us happier when we say it.\r\nIt reminds us. Mother will tell you if you live with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"At night we light the fire and watch it crackling, and I sit on\r\nmother's knee. Ain't I a big boy to sit on a lady's knee?--and she\r\ntells me. At Purple Springs there's pansies as big as plates--mother\r\nwill draw them for you--and the rocks are always warm, and the streams\r\nare boiling hot, and nobody is ever sick there or tired. Daddy\r\nwouldn't have died if we'd stayed there. But there's things in life no\r\none understands. We'll never leave when we go back.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy rambled on, his eyes shining with a great excitement. Pearl\r\nthought she was listening to the fanciful tales with which a lonely\r\nwoman beguiled the weary hours for her little son It was a weirdly\r\nextravagant fairy story, and yet it fascinated Pearl in spite of it's\r\nunlikeness to truth. It had all the phantasy of a midsummer night's\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nThe boy seemed to answer her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't it great to have something lovely to dream over, teacher? I bet\r\nyou've got sweet dreams, too. Mother says that what kills people's\r\nsouls is when they have no purple springs in their lives. She says\r\nshe's sorry for lots of people They live and walk around, but their\r\nsouls are dead, because their springs have dried up.\"\r\n\r\nPearl drew him closer to her. He was so young--and yet so old--so\r\nhappy, and yet so lonely. She wanted to give him back a careless,\r\nhappy, irresponsible childhood, full of frolicking fun and mischief,\r\nwithout care or serious thought. She longed to see him grubby-fisted\r\nbare-footed, tousle-haired, shouting and wrestling with her young\r\ntykes of brothers. It was not natural or happy to see a child so\r\nelfin, so remote, so conscious of the world's sorrows.\r\n\r\n\"Will you come with me now, teacher?\" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\nPearl could not resist the appeal. The sun hung low in an amber haze\r\nas they left the school and took the unfrequented road to the brown\r\nhouse on the hill--the house of mystery.\r\n\r\nThe air was full of the drowsy sounds of evening; cattle returning\r\nafter their day's freedom in the fields, cow-bells tinkling\r\ncontentedly. Somewhere in the distance a dog barked; and on the gentle\r\nbreeze came the song of a hermit thrush, with an undertone of cooing\r\npigeons. The acrid smell of burning leaves was in the air.\r\n\r\nThe river valley ran into the sunset with its bold scrub-covered\r\nbanks, on the high shoulder of which the railway cut made a deep welt,\r\npurple now with evening. Every day the westbound train, with its gray\r\nsmoke spume laid back on its neck like a mane, slid swiftly around the\r\nbase of the hill until the turn in the river made it appear to go into\r\na tunnel, for the opposite bank obscured it from view. It re-appeared\r\nagain, a mile farther west, and its smoke could be followed by the eye\r\nfor many miles as it made its way to the city. This year it was the\r\nGovernment's promise that the river would be bridged at Purple Springs\r\nand the road made more direct.\r\n\r\n\"Mother says no one could be lonely when they can see the trains,\"\r\nsaid James Gray. \"Mother just loves the trains--they whistle to us\r\nevery day. They would stop and talk to us only they're in such a\r\nhurry.\"\r\n\r\nWhen her young escort led Pearl Watson into the living-room she gave\r\nan exclamation of delight. A low ceiling, with weathered beams; a\r\nfloor covered with bright-colored, hand-made rugs, bookcases\r\nfilled with books, a few pictures on the wall, and many pieces of\r\nartistically constructed furniture.\r\n\r\n\"Mother makes these in the winter, she and I. We work all evening,\r\nand then we make toast at the fireplace and play the phonograph and\r\npretend we have visitors. Ever since we knew you were coming you've\r\nbeen our visitor, and now tonight I'll hide you, and mother will think\r\nI'm just pretending, and then you'll come out, and mother will think\r\nshe's dreaming again.\"\r\n\r\nPearl helped her young friend to milk the two fine cows that came up\r\nto the bars expectantly, after which the evening meal was prepared,\r\nand Pearl was amazed at the deft manner in which the boy set about his\r\nwork. He told her more about calories and food values and balanced\r\nmeals than the Domestic Science Department at the Normal School had\r\ntaught her.\r\n\r\n\"How do you know all this?\" she asked him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Mother reads it in books and tells me. Mother learns everything\r\nfirst, and tells me--she is determined,\" said the boy gravely, \"that\r\nI will have just as good a chance as other children. She says if\r\nshe ever did anything that wasn't right, and which made it hard for\r\nme--she'll make it up. Mother says God is often up against it with\r\npeople, too. He has to let things happen to them--bad things--but He\r\ncan always make it up to them--and He will! Do you think that too,\r\nteacher?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it,\" said Pearl, with a catch in her throat and a sudden\r\nchill of doubt. Were there some things which even God could not make\r\nup to us?\r\n\r\nThe fireplace was laid with red willow wood, and when everything was\r\nready, and the hour had come when Mrs. Gray was expected home, Pearl\r\nand James waited in the big chair before the fire, which darted\r\ntongues of purple flame and gave a grateful heat, for the evening was\r\nchilly. They did not light the lamp at all, for the light from the\r\nfire threw a warm glow over the room.\r\n\r\nA great peace seemed to have come to Pearl's heart. The neighbors of\r\nPurple Springs, with their inhospitable hearts, seemed far away and\r\nunreal. That thought in some occult way came to her with comforting\r\npower from the spirit which dwelt in this home.\r\n\r\nFor three years no friendly foot had come to this threshold, no one\r\nhad directed a friendly thought to the woman who lived here, nor to\r\nthe child; yet woman and child had lived on happily in spite of this,\r\nand now to Pearl, on whom the taboo of the neighborhood had also\r\nfallen, there came the peace of mind which could set quietly at\r\ndefiance the opinion of the little world which surrounded her.\r\n\r\nSo intent were Pearl and James on the story that Pearl was telling\r\nthey did not hear the buggy, which drove up to the house. Mrs. Gray\r\ngot out and took out her parcels at the front door. The leaping flames\r\nfrom the fire-place in the pretty room, made a picture she loved well.\r\nIt was so significant of home--and it is those who have not always had\r\na home who love it best. She stopped to watch the light as it danced\r\non the shelves of books and the brightly colored hangings and rugs.\r\n\r\nSeeing Pearl in the big chair, with her arm around the boy, Annie\r\nGray's heart gave a leap of rapture. Her boy had a companion--a human\r\ncomrade other than herself. It had come at last! The dream had come\r\ntrue! She watched Pearl, fascinated, fearful. Was it a dream, or was\r\nthere really a human being, and such a lovely one, a guest at her\r\nfireside?\r\n\r\nWith a quick movement she flung open the door James ran to his mother\r\nwith a welcoming shout. Then Pearl stood up, and the two women shook\r\nhands without a word. They looked long into each other's eyes; then\r\nwith a quick impulse, and a sudden illumination, Pearl put her arms\r\naround the older woman and kissed her.\r\n\r\nAnnie Gray held her away from her, so she could look at her again.\r\nThen with a laugh that was half a sob, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Prayers--are--sometimes--answered,\" and without any warning,\r\nsurprising herself even more than she did the others--she began to\r\ncry. Three years is a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE END OF A LONELY ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl opened her eyes the next morning it was with a delicious\r\nsense of well-being, which increased as she looked about her. It may\r\nhave been the satiny smoothness of the sheets, the silk eiderdown\r\nquilt, with its plumy yellow chrysanthemums, the pale yellow scrim\r\ncurtains, across whose lower borders young brown ducks followed each\r\nother in stately procession; the home-made table with its gray linen\r\nrunner, across which a few larger ducks paraded, and which held a\r\nlarge lamp, with a well-flounced shade; the soft buff walls, with\r\ntheir border of yellow autumn woods, sun-sweet and cool, with\r\nleaf-strewn paths that would be springy to walk on. It may have been\r\nthese, for Pearl's heart could easily be set tingling by a flash of\r\ncolor that pleased her. But there is no doubt the room had a presence,\r\na strong, buoyant, cheerful presence. It had been furnished to defy\r\nloneliness. Who could be lonely looking down at a thick plushy rug of\r\nwoolly white sheep, shading into yellow, lying on the very greenest of\r\ngrass, beside a whimsical little twisting stream that you were just\r\nsure had speckled trout in it, darting over its gravelly bottom, if\r\nyour eyes were only quick enough to catch the flash of them; and who\r\nwouldn't be glad to wash in a basin that was just lined with yellow\r\nroses, with a few of them falling out over the sides; and who wouldn't\r\naccept the gift of a towel from a hospitable oak hand, which held out\r\na whole bouquet of them--one on each finger; towels with all sorts of\r\nedgings and insertions and baskets of flowers and monograms on them\r\njust begging you to take your choice. And if anything else were needed\r\nto keep the heart from dull gray loneliness, or ugly black fear, on\r\nthe wall over the bed was a big gilt-framed picture of an amber-eyed,\r\nwhite-collared, blessed collie dog, with the faintest showing of his\r\nred tongue, big and strong and faithful, just to remind you that\r\nthough changes befall and friends betray and hopes grow cold,\r\nfaithfulness and affection have not entirely vanished from the earth.\r\n\r\nPearl's sense of freedom, of power, of comfort, seemed to increase as\r\nshe lay watching the spot of sunshine which fell on the rug with its\r\nflock of sheep and seemed to bring them alive. The whole room seemed\r\nto fit around her, the ceiling bent over her like a kind face,\r\nthe walls, pictures, and furniture were like a group of friends\r\nencouraging her, inspiring her, soothing her.\r\n\r\nPearl searched her mind for a word to describe it. \"It feels\r\nlike--Saturday--\" she said at last, \"--freedom, rest, plans,\r\nambitions--it has them all, and it has something deeper still in\r\nit--it is like a section of a tree, in which history can be read,\r\nstorms and winds and sunshine,\" for Pearl knew instinctively that it\r\nwas a tower-room that Annie Gray had made for an armor for her soul,\r\nso it would not be pierced by the injustice and unkindness of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"They do not understand,\" Pearl said again, \"that's all--they do not\r\nmean to be so horrid to her--it's queer how badly people can treat\r\neach other and their conscience let them get away with it. Even if\r\nMrs. Gray had been all they said, she had not done any wrong to\r\nthem--why should they feel called upon to punish her? Well, I can tell\r\nthem a few things now.\"\r\n\r\nA fire burned in the fireplace, and the breakfast-table was set in\r\nfront of it. Mrs. Gray, in an attractive mauve house-gown, came in\r\nfrom the kitchen. She was a tall woman, with steel gray eyes, with\r\npebblings of green--the eyes of courage and high resolve. Her features\r\nwere classical in their regularity, and reminded Pearl of the faces in\r\nher history reproduced from the Greek coins, lacking only the laurel\r\nwreath. Her hair was beginning to turn gray, and showed a streak at\r\neach side, over her temples. A big black braid was rolled around her\r\nperfectly round head; a large green jade brooch, with a braided silver\r\nedge, fastened her dress. Her hands were brown and hard, but long,\r\nshapely and capable looking.\r\n\r\nThe boy was sleeping late, so Pearl and her hostess ate their\r\nbreakfast alone.\r\n\r\n\"Will you let me stay with you, Mrs. Gray,\" Pearl asked, when\r\nbreakfast was over. \"I will make my own bed, keep my things tidy, try\r\nnot to spill my tea. I will wipe my feet, close the screen door, and\r\nget up for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gray looked across the table, with her dear eyes fastened on her\r\nguest. Suddenly they began to grow dim with tears.\r\n\r\n\"Pearl,\" she said, laughing, \"I don't know what there is about you\r\nthat makes me want to cry. I've gone through some rough places in life\r\nwithout a tear, but you seem to have a way all your own to start me\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't hurt you, do I?\" Pearl asked, in distress. \"Surely I\r\ndon't--I wouldn't do that for the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of it,\" laughed her hostess, as she wiped her eyes, and\r\nthen, blinking hard to clear away the last traces of grief, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Pearl, before you come to board with me you should know something\r\nabout me; you have no doubt heard some strange things.\"\r\n\r\nPearl did not deny it.\r\n\r\n\"And you should know the whole story, and then judge for yourself\r\nwhether you consider I am a fit person to live with.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do already,\" said Pearl. \"I consider you a very proper and\r\ndelightful person to live with. I don't want to know a thing about\r\nyou unless you care to tell me. You don't know anything about me\r\neither--we both have to take a chance--and I am willing if you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there will be an insurrection in the neighborhood. They won't let\r\nyou, Pearl. They can't forgive me for coming here without reference or\r\ncharacter, and with a child, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he's a pretty fine child,\" said Pearl, \"and, I should say, a\r\nsort of certificate for his mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no matter how fine a child he is--no matter what care a mother\r\nhas taken in his training--nothing can atone, in the eyes of society\r\nfor the failure of conforming to some of their laws. Society's laws,\r\nnot God's laws. Society is no friend to women, Pearl.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is just because people do not think,\" said Pearl, \"They have\r\nmade certain laws--and women have not made any protest, so the men\r\nthink they are all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you know why, Pearl?\" she asked. \"Women who are caught in the\r\ntangle of these laws, as I was, cannot say a word--their lips\r\nare dumb. The others won't say a word for fear of spoiling their\r\nmatrimonial market. The worst thing that can be said of a woman is\r\nthat she's queer and strong-minded--and defies custom. If you want to\r\nbe happy, Pearl, be self-centered, virtuous, obey the law, and care\r\nnothing for others.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean that,\" said Pearl. \"You've been hard hit some way I\r\ndo not want to know until you want to tell me. But I am going to stay\r\nwith you if you will keep me. I am determined to stay.\"\r\n\r\nAnnie Gray's steely eyes clouded over again, like a sun-kissed lake\r\nwhen a cloud passes over it. They grew deeper, grayer, and of misty\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\n\"You are doing something for me, Pearl, that I thought could never be\r\ndone; you are restoring my faith. Remember, I have not been as unhappy\r\nas you may think. I had my happiness--that's more than some women can\r\nsay. I have had the rapture, the blessedness of love--I've had\r\nit all--the rapture of holding and the agony of loss--I'm only\r\nthirty-one, but I've lived a thousand years. But, Pearl, you've done\r\nsomething for me already; you have set my feet again on something\r\nsolid, and I am a different woman from yesterday. Some day I'll tell\r\nyou a strange story until then, you'll trust me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Until then--and far beyond it--forever,\" said Pearl. \"I'll trust\r\nyou--I have an idea you and I are going to stick together for a long\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nPearl went back to the school and found her letter of acceptance in\r\nthe desk. She tore it up and wrote another, thanking the department\r\nfor their kindness in offering her such a splendid position, but\r\nexplaining that she had decided to stay at the school at Purple\r\nSprings. She made her decision without any difficulty. There was a\r\ndeep conviction that the threads of destiny were weaving together her\r\nlife and Annie Gray's, and she knew, from some hidden source in\r\nher soul, that she must stand by. What she could do, was vague and\r\nunformed in her mind, but she knew it would be revealed to her.\r\n\r\nPearl, child of the prairie, never could think as clearly when her\r\nvision was bounded by walls. She had to have blue distance--the great,\r\nlong look that swept away the little petty, trifling, hampering\r\nthings, which so slavishly dominate our lives, if we will let them. So\r\nshe took her way to a little lake behind the school, where with the\r\nschool axe she had already made a seat for herself under two big\r\npoplar trees, and cut the lower branches of some of the smaller ones,\r\ngiving them a neat and tidy appearance, like well-gartered children\r\ndressed for a picnic.\r\n\r\nThere were a few white birches mixed with the poplars, so delicately\r\nformed and dainty in their slender branches and lacy leaves, they\r\nlooked like nice little girls with flowing hair, coming down to bathe\r\nin the blue lake, timidly trying out the water with their white feet.\r\nThe trees formed a semi-circle around the east side of the lake,\r\nleaving one side open to view, and she could see the prairie falling\r\naway to the river, which made a wide detour at this point.\r\n\r\nPearl settled herself in her rustic seat, putting the newspaper, which\r\nshe had left for the purpose, behind her back as she leaned against\r\nthe tree, to keep the powdery bark from marking her blue coat, and\r\nleaning back contentedly, she drank in the spring sounds.\r\n\r\nThe sun, which stood almost at noon, seemed to draw the leaves out\r\nlike a magnet; she could almost believe she saw them unfolding; above\r\nher head there was a perfect riot of bird's song, and a blue-bird,\r\nlike a burst of music, went flashing across the water. A gray squirrel\r\nchattered as he ran up a tree behind her, and a rabbit, padding over\r\nthe dead leaves on his way to the lake, made a sound like a bear.\r\n\r\nUp through the tree tops there had climbed a few blue rags of smoke,\r\nfor behind her a sleepy prairie fire was eating backward toward a\r\nploughed fire-guard, and the delightful acrid smell brought back the\r\nmemory of past prairie fires, pleasant enough to think of, as life's\r\nbattles are, if they end victoriously. Not a breath stirred in the\r\ntrees, and the prairie fire that smouldered so indolently was surely\r\nthe gentlest of its race.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there came a gust of wind through the trees, which set them\r\ncreaking and crackling with vague apprehension, for the wind is\r\nalways the mischief maker--the tattler--the brawler who starts the\r\ntrouble--and the peaceful, slumbering absent-minded prairie fire,\r\nnibbling away at a few dead roots and grass, had been too much for it.\r\nHere was a perfectly good chance to make trouble which no wind could\r\nresist.\r\n\r\nA big black cloud went over the sun, and all in a minute the placid\r\nwaters of the lake were rasped into a pattern like the soles of new\r\nrubbers--the trees were bending--crows cawing excitedly, and the fire,\r\nspurred by the wind, went racing through the lake bottom and on its\r\nway up the bank toward the open country. The cattle, which had\r\nbeen feeding at the east side of the lake, sniffing danger, turned\r\ngalloping home to furnish an alibi in case of trouble.\r\n\r\nBut the excitement was short-lived owing to a circumstance which the\r\nwind had overlooked. The wind had made a mistake in its direction, and\r\nso the fire had one wild, glorious race up the bank only to find its\r\nnose run right into a freshly ploughed fire-guard, steaming damp and\r\nrichly brown. The fire sputtered, choked and died down, black and\r\ndisappointed, leaving only a few smoking clumps of willows.\r\n\r\nThen the wind, seeing no further chance of trouble, went crackling\r\naway over the tree tops, and the sun came back, brilliant and warm\r\nas ever, and there was nothing to show that there had been any\r\nexcitement, save only the waves on the lake. The wind was gone,\r\nlaughing and unrepentant, over the tree-tops; the sun had come back as\r\ngenially as if it had never been away--but the lake could not forget,\r\nand it fretted and complained, in a perfectly human way, pounding the\r\nbank in a futile attempt to get back at some one. The bank had not\r\nbeen to blame, but it had to take the lake's repinings, while the real\r\nculprit went free and unreproached.\r\n\r\nPearl could tell what the lake was saying, as it lashed itself foaming\r\nand pounding just below her feet. It called to the world to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Look how I'm used,\" it sobbed, \"and abused--and confused.\"\r\n\r\nPearl put her hands in the silk-lined pockets of her coat, and thought\r\nabout what she had just seen.\r\n\r\n\"Life is like this,\" she said at last, \"human nature is full of\r\nmischief. It loves to start trouble and fan a fire into a destructive\r\nmood; and there's only one way to stop it--plough a fire-guard. I wish\r\nthere had been some one here to plough a fire-guard when the fires of\r\ngossip began to run here three years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go now and dress up, and break the news to the neighborhood that\r\nI am going to the house at Purple Springs to board. There will be\r\na row--there will be a large row--unless I can make the people\r\nunderstand, and in a row there is nothing so sustaining as good\r\nclothes--next to the consciousness of being right, of course,\" she\r\nadded after a pause. An hour later, Pearl Watson, in her best dress\r\nof brown silk, with her high brown boots well polished, and her small\r\nbrown hat, made by herself, with a band of crushed burnt orange\r\npoppies around the crown, safely anchored and softened by a messaline\r\ndrape; with her hair drawn over the tops of her ears, and a smart\r\nfawn summer coat, with buttons which showed a spot of red like a\r\npigeon-blood ruby. Pearl looked at herself critically in the glass:\r\n\r\n\"These things should not count,\" she said, as she fastened a thin veil\r\nover her face and made it very neat at the back with a hairpin, \"but\r\nthey do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nANNIE GRAY'S STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Purple Springs district was going through a period of intense\r\nexcitement. Housework languished, dough ran over, dish-water cooled.\r\nThe news which paralyzed household operations came shortly after one\r\no'clock, when Mrs. Cowan phoned to Mrs. Brownless that the teacher had\r\njust been in, and said she was going to board with the woman who lived\r\nalone. The teacher had said it, according to Mrs. Cowan, in the \"most\r\noff-hand manner, just as if she said she had found her jackknife or\r\nher other rubber--just as easy as that, she said she had found a\r\nboarding house. Mrs. Howser could not take her, but Mrs. Gray could,\r\nand she was moving over right away.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cowan, according to her own testimony, nearly dropped. She did\r\nnot really drop, but any one could easily have knocked her down;\r\nshe could have been knocked down with a pin feather. She could not\r\nspeak--she just stared. She went all \"through other,\" and felt queer.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know that woman has a child?\" she managed to say at last, and\r\nthe teacher said, \"Sure--one of the nicest I've ever seen--a perfect\r\nbeauty.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cowan admitted to Mrs. Brownlees, who sympathized with her, that\r\nshe did not know what to say then.\r\n\r\nAt last she said, \"But she has no right to have a child,\" and the\r\nteacher said:\r\n\r\n\"Why not if she wants to. She's good to him, dresses him well and\r\ntrains him well. My mother had nine--and got away with it--and likes\r\nthem all. Having a child is nothing against her.\" Now, wasn't that an\r\nawful way for her to talk?\r\n\r\nMrs. Brownlees said it certainly was fierce! and the other listeners\r\non the phone, for the audience had been augmented as the conversation\r\nproceeded, politely said nothing, but hung up their receivers with\r\nhaste, and acquainted the members of their household with the\r\ndisquieting news.\r\n\r\nMrs. Switzer threw her apron over her head and ran out to the pump,\r\nwhere Bill was watering his three-horse team. Bill received the news\r\nin that exasperating silence which is so hard to bear. When urged for\r\nan opinion, he said crustily: \"Well, what's the girl goin' to do? None\r\nof you women would take her--she can't starve--and she can't sleep in\r\nthe school woodpile. Mrs. Gray won't bite--she's a fine lookin' woman,\r\ndrives a binder like a man, pays her debts, minds her own business. I\r\ndon't see why it wouldn't be a good boardin' place.\"\r\n\r\nIn telling about it afterwards to Mrs. Howser, Mrs. Switzer said, \"You\r\nknow what men are like; in some ways they are hardly human--they take\r\nthings so easy.\"\r\n\r\nPearl was surprised at the storm that burst, but soon realized the\r\nfutility of further speech. They would not listen--they were so intent\r\non proving the woman's guilt, they would hear no defence. From what\r\nthey said, Pearl gathered that they knew nothing about Mrs. Gray\r\nexcept what the sewing-machine agent had told them, and even he had\r\nnot claimed that he had any definite knowledge. The worst count\r\nagainst her was that she would not tell anything about herself.\r\nThat she would not tell anything about herself, could only have one\r\nexplanation! There must be nothing good to tell!\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, at the little stone church in the valley of the river Pearl\r\ntook her place among the worshippers. The attendance was unusually\r\nlarge. A new bond of interest was binding the neighborhood together,\r\nand they spoke of it as they congregated in the church-yard before the\r\nservice. Pearl sat inside and watched them as they talked together\r\nexcitedly. Snatches of their conversation came to her. \"Well-behaved\r\npeople should stay with well-behaved people, I say\"--this was from\r\nMrs. Switzer.\r\n\r\nThe men did not join in the conversation, but stood around, ill at\r\nease in their stiff collars, and made an attempt to talk about summer\r\nfallowing and other harmless topics. Their attitude to the whole\r\naffair was one of aloofness. Let the women settle it among themselves.\r\n\r\nFrom the window where she sat Pearl could see far down the valley. The\r\nriver pursued its way, happily, unperturbed by the wrongs or sorrows\r\nof the people who lived beside it. Sometimes it had reached out and\r\ndrowned a couple of them as it had done last year--but no one held it\r\nagainst the river at all.\r\n\r\nThe rejuvenation of nature was to be seen everywhere, in springing\r\ngrass and leafing tree. Everything could begin life over again. Why\r\nwere the people so hard on Annie Gray, even if all they believed about\r\nher were true? Pearl wondered about the religion of people like the\r\ngroup who were so busily talking just outside the window. Did it not\r\nteach them to be charitable? The Good Shepherd, in the picture above\r\nthe altar, had gone out to find the wandering sheep, even leaving\r\nall the others, to bring back the lost one, sorry that it had been\r\nwayward, not angry--but only sorry--Pearl hoped that they would look\r\nat it when they came in. She hoped too, that they would look at the\r\nfew scattered tombstones in the churchyard, over which the birds were\r\ndarting and skimming, and be reminded of the shortness of life, and\r\ntheir own need of mercy--and she hoped that some of the dead, who lay\r\nthere so peacefully now, might have been sinners who redeemed the past\r\nand died respected, and that they might plead now with these just\r\npersons who needed no repentance.\r\n\r\nBut when the service was over, and a brief sermon on Amos and his good\r\ndeeds, the congregation separated, and Pearl went back to the brown\r\nhouse with a heavy heart, and the cry of her soul was that God would\r\nshow her a way of making the people understand. \"Plough a fire-guard,\r\nO Lord,\" she prayed, as she walked, \"and let these deadly fires of\r\ngossip run their noses square into it and be smothered. Use me if you\r\ncan--I am here--ready to help--but the big thing is to get it done.\"\r\n\r\nAround the open grate-fire that night, after James had gone to bed,\r\nPearl and Mrs. Gray sat long before the pleasant wood fire For the\r\nfirst time Annie Gray felt she had found some one to whom she could\r\ntalk and tell what was in her heart, and the story of the last eleven\r\nyears was revealed, from the time that pretty Annie Simmons, fresh\r\nfrom Scotland, arrived at the Hudson's Bay post at Fort Resolution,\r\ncoming by dog-train the last two hundred miles to her cousin, the\r\nfactor's wife--the thin-lipped daughter of the Covenanters--who kept\r\nthe pretty young cousin closely at work in the kitchen with her pots\r\nand pans when the traders came in, for Mrs. McPherson had no intention\r\nof losing Annie and her capable help after bringing her all the way\r\nfrom the Isle of Skye.\r\n\r\nAfter a year of hard work, and some lonesome times, too, in the long,\r\ndark winter, there came to the Post a young trapper and prospector,\r\nJim Gray.\r\n\r\n\"When I saw him,\" said the woman, with the silver bands of gray\r\nencircling her shapely head, \"I knew him for my own man. He was tall\r\nand dark, with a boyish laugh that I loved, and a way of suddenly\r\nbecoming very serious in the middle of his fun--a sort of clouding\r\nover of his face as if the sun had gone under for a minute.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke haltingly, but Pearl knew what was in her heart, and her\r\nquick imagination painted in the details of each picture. She could\r\nsee the homesick Scotch girl, in the far Northern post, hungry for\r\nadmiration and love, and trying to make herself as comely as she\r\ncould. She could sense all the dreams and longings, the hopes and\r\nthrills.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me more about him,\" Pearl urged.\r\n\r\n\"He had the out-of-doors look,\" said Mrs. Gray, \"big, gentle,\r\nfearless. I knew as soon as I looked in his eyes that I would go with\r\nhim if he asked me--anywhere. I would dare anything, suffer anything\r\nfor him. Nothing mattered; you will know it some time, Pearl, I hope.\r\nIt brings sorrow, maybe, but it is the greatest thing in life. Even\r\nnow, looking back down these black years, I would do the same--I would\r\ngo with my man.\r\n\r\n\"My cousin and her husband, the factor, forbade him the house when they\r\nsaw what was happening. They had nothing against him. Every trapper\r\nsaid Jim Gray was straight as a gun-barrel. It was just that they\r\nwould not let me go--they wanted my work, but I had already worked out\r\nmy passage money, and considered myself free. They locked me in my\r\nroom at night, and treated me like a prisoner. They said abominable\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\"One night a tapping came at the little square window It was a heavy,\r\ndark night in July, with thunder rolling in great shaking billows. It\r\nwas Jim, and he asked me if I would come with him. He had spoken to\r\nthe missionary at the post, who would marry us. Would I come? I did\r\nnot know whether he had a house, or even a blanket. I only knew I\r\nloved him.\r\n\r\n\"Under cover of the storm Jim took out the window-frame, lifted me\r\nout, and we were off through the rain and the storm. But when we got\r\nto the missionary's he would not marry us--the factor had forbidden\r\nhim. Jim would have taken me back but I was afraid. The factor had\r\nsaid he would shoot him if he ever came for me. He was a high-tempered\r\nman and ruled the post and every one in it with his terrible rages.\r\nWhat would you have done, Pearl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there no one else?\" said Pearl, \"no magistrate--no other\r\nmissionary or priest?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was a missionary at the next post, sixty miles away. We could\r\nreach him in two days. What would you have done, Pearl?\"\r\n\r\nPearl was living with her every detail, every sensation, every thrill.\r\n\r\n\"What would I have done?\" she said, trembling with the excitement of a\r\ngreat decision. \"I would have gone!\"\r\n\r\nAnnie Gray's hand tightened on hers.\r\n\r\n\"I went,\" she said, \"and I was never sorry. Jim was a man of the big\r\nwoods; he loved me. The rain, which fell in torrents, did not seem to\r\nwet us--we were so happy.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the missionary's house at Hay River we were married, and the wife\r\nof the missionary gave me her clothes until mine dried. We stayed\r\nthere three days and then we went on. Jim had a cabin in a wonderful\r\nhot springs valley, and it was there we were going. It would take us\r\na month, but the weather was at its best, hazy blue days, continuous\r\ndaylight, only a little dimming of the sun's light when it disappeared\r\nbehind the mountains. We had pack-dogs from the post--Jim had left\r\nthem there--and lots of provisions. I dream of those campfires and the\r\nfrying bacon, and the blue smoke lifting itself up to the tree-tops.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat a long time silent, in a happy maze of memory.\r\n\r\n\"I had as much happiness as most women, but mine came all at once--and\r\nleft me all at once. We reached the valley in September. I was wild\r\nwith the beauty of it! Set in the mountains, which arched around it,\r\nwas this wonderful square of fertile land, about six miles one way and\r\nseven the other. The foliage is like the tropics, for the hot springs\r\nkeep off frost. The creeks which run through it come out of the rocks\r\nboiling hot--but cool enough to bathe in as they run on through the\r\nmeadows. Their waters have a peculiar purplish tinge, which passes\r\naway after it stands a while, and a delicate aroma like a fragrant\r\ntoilet water. I called it the Valley of purple springs'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our house was of logs, and built on a rock floor, which was always\r\nwarm. There were skins on the floor worth fortunes, for the animals\r\ncame to the valley in winter by the hundreds, black foxes and silver,\r\nmartins and bear. They came in, stayed a few days and passed out\r\nagain. The ferns in the valley stood seven feet high, and the stalks\r\nwere delicious when boiled and salted.\r\n\r\n\"Jim had planted a garden before he left, and we had everything,\r\ncabbages, cauliflower, beets, mushrooms. Jim got the skins he\r\nwanted--he didn't kill many--and we tanned them in the Indian way.\r\n\r\n\"At first the Indians had been afraid to come. They called it 'The\r\nDevil's Valley,' and though the young bucks might come in and spend a\r\nnight, just as a bit of bravado, they were frightened of it; but after\r\nI came they took courage and came in.\r\n\r\n\"We found out that the water in the streams had healing power, and\r\nmade one's skin feel soft as velvet, especially one stream which had\r\nthe deepest color. One old squaw, whose eyes had been sore for years,\r\nwas healed in three weeks and went back to her people with her\r\nwonderful tales of the valley. After that we had Indians with us all\r\nthe time. They brought their sick children and their old people, and\r\nthe results were marvelous. I never knew the stream to fail. Even the\r\ntubercular people soon began to grow rosy and well. The food seemed to\r\nhave healing power, too, and some who came hollow-cheeked, feverish,\r\nchoking with their cruel paroxysms of coughing, soon began to grow fat\r\nand healthy. At first the sick people just slept and slept on the warm\r\nrocks, and then came the desire to bathe in the stream, and after that\r\nthey went searching for the herbs they needed.\r\n\r\n\"We lived there three years. At the end of the first year little Jim\r\nwas born--my precious Jim, with his wonderful eyes, reflecting the\r\nbeauty of the valley. The Indian women tanned the softest buckskin for\r\nhis little things, and he had the most elaborately beaded garments.\r\nNo little prince was ever more richly dressed. He grew lovlier every\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nPearl could refrain no longer: \"Why did you ever leave?\" she asked\r\nbreathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"Conscience,\" said Annie Gray, after a pause. \"We couldn't keep it all\r\nto ourselves and be happy over it. We couldn't forget all the sick\r\npeople to whom our purple springs would bring healing. Mind you, we\r\ntried to deaden our consciences; tried to make ourselves believe it\r\nwas not our duty to give it to the world. We fought off these spells\r\nof conscience--we tried to forget that there was a world outside. But\r\nwe couldn't--we owed a duty, which we had to pay.\r\n\r\n\"One day, with our winter catch of furs packed on the dogs, we came\r\nout. The Indians could not understand why we were leaving, and stood\r\nsorrowfully watching us as far as we could see them--there was a\r\nheaviness on our spirits that day, as if we knew what was coming.\r\n\r\n\"On the Judah Hill, at Peace River, came the accident. The train went\r\nover the bank. When I came to I was in the Irene Hospital there, with\r\nlittle Jim beside me quite unhurt. But I knew--I knew. I saw in the\r\nnurses' face--my Jim had been killed.\"\r\n\r\nAll the color had gone from her voice, and she spoke as mechanically\r\nas a deaf person.\r\n\r\n\"He was instantly killed--they did not let me see him.\r\n\r\n\"I went on. I knew what I should do. I would carry out as far as\r\npossible what Jim and I had started out to do. We had filed on the\r\nland, and I had the papers--I have them still. In Peace River we had\r\nsold the furs, and I had quite a lot of money, for furs were high that\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n\"Jim had told me a lot about his father, a domineering but kindly old\r\nfellow, the local member of Parliament in a little Eastern town--a man\r\nwho had had his own way all his life. Jim had not got along well with\r\nhim, and had left home at eighteen.\r\n\r\n\"I remembered Jim had said that he wouldn't tell his father about the\r\nvalley until he had talked it over with a lawyer and got everything\r\nsettled, for the old man would run the whole thing. So when I went to\r\nhis home I said little about our valley, except to tell them of the\r\nbeauty of it.\r\n\r\n\"I was very unhappy. He raged about Jim and his wild ways. I could\r\nnot bear it. He knew nothing of the real Jim that I knew, the tender,\r\nloving, sweet-souled Jim. I could see how he had raised the devil in\r\nthe boy with his high-handed ways.\r\n\r\n\"He was passionately fond of the little Jim, and foolishly indulgent.\r\nHe would give the child a dollar for a kiss, but if he did not come\r\nrunning to him the very moment he called he would be angry. Yet I\r\ncould see that he adored the little fellow, and was very proud of his\r\nclever ways.\r\n\r\n\"One day he told me he was going to send Jim to a boy's school in\r\nEngland as soon as he was nine. I told him it could not be. Jim had\r\nsaid to me that we would bring up our boy in the wild, new country,\r\nwhere men are honorable and life is simple. I would follow Jim's\r\nwishes--our boy would not go to England. I defied him. I saw his\r\ntemper then. He told me I had nothing to say about it, he was his\r\ngrandson's guardian. Jim had made a will before he left home, making\r\nhis father executor of his estate. He told me the father was the only\r\nparent the child had in the eyes of the law, and I had no claim on my\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\"I had no one to turn to. Jim's mother was one of those sweet,\r\nyielding women, who said 'Yes, dear,' to everything he said. She\r\nfollowed him around, picking up the things he scattered and the chairs\r\nhe kicked over in his fits of temper. Sometimes when he swore she\r\ndabbed her eyes with a daintily trimmed handkerchief. That was her\r\nonly protest. She advised me to say nothing, but just do whatever\r\n'father' told me, and I said I would see him in hell first, and at\r\nthat she ran out with her fingers in her ears.\r\n\r\n\"Then a strange thing happened. McPherson, my cousin's husband, the\r\nfactor from Fort Resolution, met Jim's father at a lodge meeting, and\r\ntold him Jim and I had gone away without being married--the missionary\r\nhad refused to marry us--and we had gone away. I think he knew better,\r\nfor in the north country every one knows everyone else, and it was\r\nwell known that Jim and I were married at Hay River. He came home\r\nraging and called me names. I'll never forget how they went crashing\r\nthrough my brain. He was a proud man, and this 'disgrace' of Jim's,\r\nas he said, was the finishing touch. But when he began to abuse Jim\r\nI raged too. I said things to him which perhaps had better been left\r\nunsaid. I was sorry afterwards, for Jim was fond of his father for all\r\nhis blustering ways. I did not tell him that Jim and I were legally\r\nmarried, for the fear was on me that he could take little Jim from\r\nme, and it did not matter to me what they thought of me. I had one\r\nthought--and that was to keep my boy and bring him up myself--bring\r\nhim up to be a man like his father.\r\n\r\n\"That night I left. I was proud, too, and I left money to pay for\r\nthe time I had been with them. I had a few hundred dollars left, not\r\nenough to take me back to Purple Springs. My first plan was to get a\r\nhousekeeper's position, but I soon found I could not do that--the\r\nwork was hard, and Jim was not wanted. I worked as waitress in a\r\nrestaurant, and as saleslady in a country store, but Jim was not\r\ngetting the care he should have.\r\n\r\n\"One day I saw an advertisement in a paper. A prospector, crippled\r\nwith rheumatism, wanted a housekeeper. It said 'a woman with sense and\r\nunderstanding,' and I liked the tone of it. It was blunt and honest.\r\n\r\n\"When I went to see him I found a grizzled old fellow of about sixty,\r\nwho had been most of his life in the north, and when I found he had\r\nknown Jim, and had trapped with him on the Liard River, and knew what\r\na splendid fellow he was, I just begged him to let us stay. He was as\r\nglad to get me, as I was to find a home.\r\n\r\n\"I cared for him until he died. He was a good man, a man of the big\r\nwoods, whose life was simple, honest and kindly.\r\n\r\n\"In the little town where we lived the people gossiped when I came to\r\nhim. They wanted to know where I had come from, and all about me. I\r\ntold them nothing. I was afraid. I had changed my name, but still I\r\nwas afraid Jim's father might find me. Mr. Bowen thought it would be\r\nbetter if we were married, just to stop their tongues, but I couldn't\r\nmarry him. Jim has always been just as real to me as when he was with\r\nme. Mr. Bowen was kind and gentlemanly always, and many a happy hour\r\nwe spent talking of the big country with its untold riches. If I could\r\nhave taken him to Purple Springs he could have been cured, but we knew\r\nhe could not stand the journey, for his heart was weak.\r\n\r\n\"I went to night school while I was with him, and learned all I could\r\nfor Jim's sake. But he died at last, and left me very lonely, for I\r\nhad grown fond of him.\r\n\r\n\"By his will he left me all he had, and the deed of this farm was part\r\nof his estate. So, after his death, Jim and I came here. Mr. Bowen had\r\nadvised me to stay on this farm--he had taken it because there were\r\nindications of oil, and he believed there would be a big strike here\r\nsome day. He also left me four thousand dollars, and I have added to\r\nit every year. Sometimes I've been tempted to sell out and get back\r\nnorth, but Jim is too young yet, I think, I should go somewhere and\r\nlet him go to school. I thought when I came he could go here. I have\r\nonly one thought, one care, one ambition--I've lived my life--I've had\r\nmy one good, glorious day, and now I want to see that Jim gets his.\r\n\r\n\"It's a queer story, isn't it, Pearl? I ran away and got married,\r\nand then I ran away from marriage to keep my boy. I could prove in a\r\nmoment that my marriage was legal, of course, the certificate is here,\r\nand the marriage was registered by the missionary, who has come back\r\nnow and lives in the city. But I dare not tell who I am--Jim does not\r\nknow who his grandfather is.\"\r\n\r\n\"He surely couldn't take your boy,\" cried Pearl. \"There is no justice\r\nin that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only the unmarried mother has the absolute right to her child,\" said\r\nAnnie Gray, as one who quotes from a legal document. \"I talked to a\r\nlawyer whom Mr. Bowen sent for. He showed it to me in the law.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peter Neelands was right,\" said Pearl after a while, \"it is exactly\r\nthe sort of a law he said the other one was.\"\r\n\r\nThe two women sat by the fire, which by this time was reduced to one\r\ntiny red coal. There was not a sound in the house except the regular\r\nbreathing of little Jim from the adjoining room. A night wind stirred\r\nthe big tree in front of the house, and its branches touched the\r\nshingles softly, like a kind hand.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you the rest of it, Pearl, and why I am so frightened.\r\nPerhaps I grow fearful, living here alone, and my mind conjures up\r\ndreadful things. Jim's grandfather has moved to this Province from the\r\nEast. I read about him in the papers. He is a powerful man--who\r\ngets his own way. He might be able to get doctors to pronounce me\r\ninsane--we read such things. He has such influence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he?\" asked Pearl wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"He is the Premier of this Province,\" said Annie Gray. \"Now do you\r\nwonder at my fear?\"\r\n\r\nPearl sat a long time silent. \"A way will be found,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE OPENING OF THE WAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I wonder where they are,\" Pearl said to herself, as she looked\r\nanxiously out of the window of the school on Monday morning. The roads\r\nleading from the Purple Springs school lay like twisted brown ribbons\r\non the tender green fields, but not a child, not a straw hat, red\r\nsweater, sun-bonnet; not a glint of a dinner-pail broke the monotony\r\nof the bright spring morning.\r\n\r\nThe farm-houses seemed to be enjoying their usual activity. The\r\nspielers among the hens were announcing that the day's business was\r\noff to a good start, with prospects never brighter, dogs barked,\r\ncalves bawled, cow-bells jangled--there was even a murmur of talking.\r\n\r\n\"They are not dead,\" said Pearl, as she listened, bareheaded, at the\r\ngate, \"not dead, except to me--but they are not going to let the\r\nchildren come!\r\n\r\n\"They have turned me down!\"\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock, a flash of hope lighted up the gloom that had settled\r\non her heart. The Snider twins, two tiny black dots, side by side like\r\nquotation marks, appeared distinctly against the vivid green of their\r\nfather's wheat field and continued to advance upon the school-house,\r\nuntil they were but half a mile away. Then, noticing that no one else\r\nwas abroad, they turned about and retraced their steps in haste,\r\nbelieving it must be Sunday, or a holiday--or something.\r\n\r\nThey were quite right on the last guess. It was something. But not\r\neven the teacher knew just what. The school room was clammily,\r\nreproachfully silent, every tick of the elm clock which told off\r\nthe time without prejudice, seemed to pile up evidence of a hostile\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nPearl's brows were knitted in deep thought, as she looked in vain down\r\nthe sparkling roads. What was back of it all? What had she done, or\r\nfailed to do? Why did no one want to give her board and shelter? This\r\nlatest development--the boycott of the school--was of course a protest\r\nagainst her association with the woman of Purple Springs.\r\n\r\nPearl squared her shoulders and threw back her head. She remembered\r\nthe advice she had given her young brothers, \"Don't pick a fight.\r\nDon't hit harder than you need to--but when trouble comes, be facing\r\nthe right way.\" She would try to keep her face in the right direction.\r\nHere was prejudice, narrowness, suspicion, downright injustice and\r\ncruelty--of this she was sure--there were other elements, other\r\ncomplications of which she had no knowledge. Peter Neelands had\r\ntold her the Government was watching her, but she had not taken it\r\nseriously.\r\n\r\nShe began to wonder if the invitation to work in the Educational\r\nDepartment might not be a plan to get her safely out of the way until\r\nafter the election. It seemed too absurd.\r\n\r\nLife was not so simple and easy as she had thought, or was it true\r\nthat the element of trouble was in her own mind. Did she attract\r\ntrouble by some quality of heart or brain. But what else could she\r\nhave done? Hadn't she told the truth and done what seemed right all\r\nthe way? But to be turned down in her school--left alone--boycotted.\r\n\r\nPearl's depression, poignant and deep though it was, did not last\r\nlong. There would be a way out--there was always a way out! She would\r\nbe shown the way!\r\n\r\n\"They that are with us,\" said Pearl solemnly, struggling with a wave\r\nof self pity, \"are greater than they that are against us. I wish I\r\ncould get them all lined up and talk to them. There is no use in\r\ntalking to them one by one--they won't listen--they're too busy trying\r\nto think of something to say back. But if I had them all together,\r\nI could make them see things--they would have to see it. They are\r\npositively cruel to Mrs. Gray, and the dear little Jim--and without\r\ncause--and they should be told. Nobody would be so mean--if they\r\nknew--even the old grandfather would feel sorry.\"\r\n\r\nWhen ten o'clock came, and not one pupil had arrived, Pearl decided\r\nshe would go over to the post-office for her mail. There would be a\r\nletter from home, and never before had she so much needed the loving\r\nassurance that she had a home where a welcome awaited her, even if the\r\nworld had gone wrong. The Watson family would stand by her, no matter\r\nwhat the verdict of Purple Springs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the home letter, with its reassuring news that four\r\nhens were set and the red cow had come in, and the boys had earned\r\nthree dollars and fifteen cents on their gopher tails, and the\r\ntwenty-fourth being a holiday. Jimmy would come over for her--in\r\naddition to this, there was a large square envelope from the city. The\r\nletter was from the Woman's Club, telling her that they were preparing\r\na political play and wanted her to come at once to the city to take an\r\nimportant part. They had heard of her ability from Mr. Neelands. Would\r\nshe please let them know at once?\r\n\r\nA smile scattered the gloom on Pearl's face. Here was a way out. Would\r\nshe go? To play an important part in a play? Would she go?\r\n\r\nPearl went down the road on light feet, to where Mr. Cowan, the\r\nSecretary, was ploughing stubble. Mr. Cowan was expecting a call, and\r\ndreading it, for in spite of careful rehearsing, he had been unable\r\nto make out a good case. He was an awkward conspirator, without\r\nenthusiasm, and his plain country conscience reminded him that it was\r\na mean way to treat a teacher whom he--himself--had selected. But why\r\nhadn't she accepted the offer to go to the city, and get away from a\r\nneighborhood where she could not be comfortable. Naturally, he could\r\nnot urge it--that would give away the whole game. But he could hardly\r\nkeep from asking her.\r\n\r\nHe resolved to say as little as possible, when he saw her coming.\r\nThere was no trace of either gloom or resentment in her face when she\r\ngreeted him. Mr. Cowan was equally friendly.\r\n\r\n\"I want to ask you something, Mr. Cowan,\" said Pearl. \"What is wrong\r\nwith me? Why don't the people like me? What have I done?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan had stopped his team, and lifting the lines from behind his\r\nback, he wound them deliberately around the handles of the plow before\r\nspeaking. His manner indicated that it was a long story.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know what women are like. No one can reason with women,\r\nand they won't stand for you boarding with Mrs. Gray. They're sore on\r\nher--and don't think she's just what she should be--and--\"\r\n\r\nPearl interrupted him:\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Cowan, even before I went there, there was something wrong.\r\nWhy wouldn't they give me a boarding place? You thought that I could\r\nget a boarding place when you hired me. Come on, Mr. Cowan, you may\r\njust as well tell me--it's the easiest way in the end--just to speak\r\nout--it saves time. If you ask me not to tell--I won't.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Cowan did not expect to be cornered up so closely, and in\r\ndesperation he said what was uppermost in his mind:\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you take the offer to go to the city, that's a great\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\nHe had forgotten to be discreet.\r\n\r\n\"I am going to,\" said Pearl quickly, \"that's what I came over to tell\r\nyou--I want to go. I wanted to ask you if it would be all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you're talking,\" cried her trustee gladly--a great burden had\r\nbeen lifted from his heart. \"Sure you can go--it would be a, shame for\r\nyou to miss a chance like this.\"\r\n\r\nIn his excitement he hardly knew what he was saying. This was just\r\nwhat he had been hoping would happen. Wouldn't George Steadman be\r\npleased! He had given out a delicate piece of work to be done, and it\r\nhad been successfully managed.\r\n\r\n\"You were just fooling us by pretending you were going to board at\r\nMrs. Gray's--weren't you? You knew all the time you were going to the\r\ncity; You were just playing a joke on us--I know. Well the joke's on\r\nus all right, as the cowboys said when they hanged the wrong man.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge Cowan rubbed his hands; the whole world had grown brighter. The\r\npolitical machine was the thing--real team-play--that's what it was.\r\nIt's hard to beat the machine--and the best of it all was, there was\r\nno harm done, and nobody hurt. She would be as safe as a church when\r\nshe was in the employ of the Government--and in a good job too--away\r\nahead of teaching. No government employee could mention politics.\r\nSome people thought women were hard to manage! but it just required a\r\nlittle brains--that was all. Diplomacy was the thing.\r\n\r\n\"You are sure you don't mind my going,\" said Pearl, \"without notice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit--and we'll be glad to have you back, say for the Fall term.\r\nI'll fix the salary too and make out your cheque for the full month.\r\nIt wouldn't be right for us to stand in your way--of course you may\r\nnot want to come back--but if you do just drop me a line. I suppose\r\nyou will want to go home before you go into the city. I can take you\r\nover this afternoon in the car.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Mr. Cowan,\" Pearl said, \"you are very kind. I'll be ready\r\nat one o'clock. But tell me--how did you know I had an invitation to\r\nthe city? That was pretty clever of you.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Cowan was untwisting the lines from the plow handles preparatory\r\nto making another round. He suddenly remembered to be discreet, and\r\nwinked one eye with indescribable slyness.\r\n\r\n\"A little bird whispered to me,\" he laughed.\r\n\r\nAt noon, when he told Mrs. Cowan about it, he said it was queer how\r\nthat answer of his seemed to hit the teacher. She went away laughing,\r\nand he could hear her for fully a quarter of a mile kind of chuckling\r\nto herself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, sir,\" said the man in the box-office of the Grand, \"but the\r\nhouse has been sold out for two days now. The standing room has gone\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell me what this is all about, that every one is so crazy to\r\nsee it?\" the man at the wicket asked, with studied carelessness. He\r\nwas a thick-set man, with dark glasses, and wore a battered hat, and a\r\nmuch bedraggled waterproof.\r\n\r\n\"The women here have got up a Parliament, and are showing tonight,\"\r\nsaid the ticket-seller. \"They pretend that only women vote, and women\r\nonly sit in Parliament. The men will come, asking for the vote, and\r\nthey'll get turned down good and plenty, just like the old man turned\r\nthem down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the Premier turn them down?\" asked the stranger. \"I didn't hear\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he? I guess, yes--he ripped into them in his own sweet way. Did\r\nyou ever hear the old man rage? Boy! Well, the women have a girl\r\nhere who is going to do his speech. She's the woman Premier, you\r\nunderstand, and she can talk just like him. She does everything except\r\nchew the dead cigar. The fellows in behind say it's the richest thing\r\nthey ever heard. The old boy will have her shot at sunrise, for sure.\r\n\r\n\"He won't hear her,\" said the man in the waterproof, with sudden\r\nenergy. \"He won't know anything about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure he will. The old man is an old blunderbuss, but he's too good\r\na sport to stay away. They're decorating a box for him, and have his\r\nname on it. He can't stay away.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can if he wants to,\" snapped the other man. \"What does he care\r\nabout this tommyrot--he'll take no notice of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the man behind the wicket, \"I believe he'll come. But\r\nsay, he sure started something when he got these women after him.\r\nThey're the sharpest-tongued things you ever listened to, and they\r\nhave their speeches all ready. The big show opens tonight, and every\r\nseat is sold. You may get a ticket though at the last minute, from\r\nsome one who cannot come. There are always some who fail to show up at\r\nthe last. I can save you a ticket if this happens. What name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jones,\" said the gentleman in the waterproof. No doubt the irritation\r\nin his voice was caused by having to confess to such a common name.\r\n\"Robertson Jones. Be sure you have it right,\" and he passed along the\r\nrail to make room for two women who also asked for tickets.\r\n\r\nThe directors of the Woman's Parliament knew the advertising value of\r\na mystery, being students of humanity, and its odd little ways. They\r\nknew that people are attracted by the unknown; so in their advance\r\nnotices they gave the names of all the women taking part in the play,\r\nbut one. The part of the Premier--the star part--would be taken by a\r\nwoman whose identity they were \"not at liberty to reveal.\" Well-known\r\npress women were taking the other parts, and their pictures appeared\r\non the posters, but no clue was given out as to the identity of the\r\nwoman Premier.\r\n\r\nLong before sundown, the people gathered at the theatre door, for\r\nthe top gallery would open for rush seats at seven. Even the ticket\r\nholders had been warned that no seat would be held after eight\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nThrough the crowd came the burly and aggressive form of Robertson\r\nJones, still wearing his dark glasses, and with a disfiguring strip of\r\ncourt plaster across his cheek. At the wicket he made inquiry for his\r\nticket, and was told to stand back and wait. Tickets were held until\r\neight o'clock.\r\n\r\nIn the lobby, flattening himself against the marble wall, he waited,\r\nwith his hat well down over his face. Crowds of people, mostly women,\r\nsurged past him, laughing, chattering, feeling in their ridiculous\r\nbags for their tickets, or the price of a box of chocolates at the\r\ncounter, where two red-gold blondes presided.\r\n\r\nInside, as the doors swung open, he saw a young fellow in evening\r\ndress, giving out handbills, and an exclamation almost escaped him. He\r\nhad forgotten all about Peter Neelands!\r\n\r\nRobertson Jones, caught in the eddies of women, buffeted by them, his\r\ntoes stepped upon, elbowed, crowded, grew more and more scornful of\r\ntheir intelligence, and would probably have worked his way out--if he\r\ncould, but the impact of the crowd worked him forward.\r\n\r\n\"A silly, cackling hen-party,\" he muttered to himself. \"I'll get out\r\nof this--it's no place for a man--Lord deliver me from a mob like\r\nthis, with their crazy tittering. There ought to be a way to stop\r\nthese things. It's demoralizing--it's unseemly.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to turn back, however, and he found himself swept\r\ninside. He thought of the side door as a way of escape, but to his\r\nsurprise, he saw the whole Cabinet arriving there and filing into the\r\nboxes over which the colors of the Province were draped; every last\r\none of them, in evening dress.\r\n\r\nThat was the first blow of the evening! Every one of them had said\r\nthey would not go--quite scornfully--and spoke of it as \"The Old\r\nMaid's Convention\"--Yet they came!\r\n\r\nHe wedged his way back to the box office, only to find that there was\r\nno ticket for him. Every one had been lifted. But he determined to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\nGetting in again, he approached a man in a shabby suit, sitting in the\r\nlast row.\r\n\r\n\"I'll give you five dollars for your seat,\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Holy smoke!\" broke from the astonished seat-holder, and then,\r\nrecovering from his surprise, he said, \"Make it ten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up then, and get out--here's your money,\" said Mr. Jones\r\nharshly, and in the hurriedly vacated seat, he sat down heavily.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes, the leader of the Woman's Party gave Pearl her\r\nparting words:\r\n\r\n\"Don't spare him, Pearl,\" she said, with her hand around the girl's\r\nshoulder, \"it is the only way. We have coaxed, argued, reasoned, we\r\nhave shown him actual cases where the laws have worked great injustice\r\nto women. He is blind in his own conceit, and cannot be moved. This\r\nis the only way--we can break his power by ridicule--you can do it,\r\nPearl. You can break down a wall of prejudice tonight that would take\r\nlong years to wear away. Think of cases you know, Pearl, and strike\r\nhard. Better to hurt one, and save many! This is a play--but a deadly\r\nserious one! I must go now and make the curtain speech.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is not the sort of Parliament we think should exist,\" she said,\r\nbefore the curtain, \"this is the sort of Parliament we have at the\r\npresent time--one sex making all the laws. We have a Parliament of\r\nwomen tonight, instead of men, just to show you how it looks from the\r\nother side. People seem to see a joke better sometimes when it is\r\nturned around.\"\r\n\r\nRobertson Jones shrugged his shoulders in disgust. What did they hope\r\nto gain, these freaks of women, with their little plays and set little\r\nspeeches. Who listened or noticed? No one, positively no one.\r\n\r\nThen the lights went out in the house, and the asbestos curtain came\r\nslowly down and slowly crept into the ceiling again, to reassure the\r\ntimorous, and the beautiful French garden, with its white statuary,\r\nand fountain, against the green trees, followed its plain asbestos\r\nsister, and the Woman's Parliament was revealed in session.\r\n\r\nThe Speaker, in purple velvet, with a sweeping plume in her\r\nthree-cornered hat, sat on the throne; pages in uniform answered the\r\nmany calls of the members, who, on the Government side were showing\r\nevery sign of being bored, for the Opposition had the floor, and the\r\nhonorable member from Mountain was again introducing her bill to give\r\nthe father equal guardianship rights with the mother. She pleaded\r\neloquently that two parents were not any too many for children to\r\nhave. She readily granted that if there were to be but one patent, it\r\nwould of course be the mother, but why skimp the child on parents?\r\nLet him have both. It was nature's way. She cited instances of grave\r\ninjustice done to fathers from having no claim on their offspring.\r\n\r\nThe Government members gave her little attention. They read their\r\npapers, one of the Cabinet Ministers tatted, some of the younger\r\nmembers powdered their noses, many ate chocolates. Those who listened,\r\ndid so to sneer at the honorable member from Mountain, insinuating she\r\ntook this stand so she might stand well with the men. This brought a\r\nhearty laugh, and a great pounding of the desks.\r\n\r\nWhen the vote was taken, the House divided along party lines.\r\nYawningly the Government members cried \"No!\"\r\n\r\nRobertson Jones sniffed contemptuously; evidently this was a sort\r\nof Friday afternoon dialogue, popular at Snookum's Corners, but not\r\nlikely to cause much of a flutter in the city.\r\n\r\nThere was a bill read to give dower rights to men, and the leader of\r\nthe Opposition made a heated defence of the working man who devotes\r\nhis life to his wife and family, and yet has no voice in the\r\ndisposition of his property. His wife can sell it over his head, or\r\nwill it away, as had sometimes been done.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General, in a deeply sarcastic vein, asked the honorable\r\nlady if she thought the wife and mother would not deal fairly--even\r\ngenerously with her husband. Would she have the iron hand of the law\r\nintrude itself into the sacred precincts of the home, where little\r\ncherub faces gather round the hearth, under the glow of the\r\nglass-fringed hanging lamp. Would she dare to insinuate that love had\r\nto be buttressed by the law? Did not a man at the altar, in the\r\nsight of God and witnesses, endow his wife with all his goods? Well\r\nthen--were those sacred words to be blasphemed by an unholy law which\r\ncompelled her to give back what he had so lovingly given? When a man\r\nmarries, cried the honorable Attorney General, he gives his wife his\r\nname--and his heart--and he gives them unconditionally. Are not these\r\ninfinitely more than his property? The greater includes the less--the\r\ntail goes with the hide! The honorable leader of the Opposition was\r\nguilty of a gross offense against good taste, in opening this question\r\nagain. Last session, the session before, and now this session, she has\r\nharped on this disagreeable theme. It has become positively indecent.\r\n\r\nThe honorable leader of the Opposition begged leave to withdraw her\r\nmotion, which was reluctantly granted, and the business of the House\r\nwent on.\r\n\r\nA page brought in the word that a delegation of men were waiting to be\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nEven the Opposition laughed. A delegation of men, seemed to be an old\r\nand never-failing joke.\r\n\r\nSome one moved that the delegation be heard, and the House was\r\nresolved into a committee of the whole, with the First Minister in the\r\nchair.\r\n\r\nThe first minister rose to take the chair, and was greeted with a\r\nround of applause. Opera glasses came suddenly to many eyes, but the\r\nface they saw was not familiar. It was a young face, under iron gray\r\nhair, large dark eyes, and a genial and pleasant countenance.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the evening, Mr. Robertson Jones experienced a\r\nthrill of pleasure. At least the woman Premier was reasonably good\r\nlooking. He looked harder at her. He decided she was certainly\r\nhandsome, and evidently the youngest of the company.\r\n\r\nThe delegation of men was introduced and received--the House settled\r\ndown to be courteous, and listen. Listening to delegations was part of\r\nthe day's work, and had to be patiently borne.\r\n\r\nThe delegation presented its case through the leader, who urged that\r\nmen be given the right to vote and sit in Parliament. The members of\r\nthe Government smiled tolerantly. The First Minister shook her head\r\nslowly and absent-mindedly forgot to stop. But the leader of the\r\ndelegation went on.\r\n\r\nThe man who sat in the third seat from the back found the phrasing\r\nstrangely familiar. He seemed to know what was coming. Sure enough, it\r\nwas almost word for word the arguments the women had used when they\r\ncame before the House. The audience was in a pleasant mood, and\r\nlaughed at every point. It really did not seem to take much to amuse\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen the delegation leader had finished, and the applause was over,\r\nthere was a moment of intense silence. Every one leaned forward,\r\nedging over in their seats to get the best possible look.\r\n\r\nThe Woman Premier had risen. So intent was the audience in their study\r\nof her face, they forgot to applaud. What they saw was a tall, slight\r\ngirl whose naturally brilliant coloring needed no make-up; brilliant\r\ndark eyes, set in a face whose coloring was vivid as a rose, a\r\nstraight mouth with a whimsical smile. She gave the audience one\r\nfriendly smile, and then turned to address the delegation.\r\n\r\nShe put her hands in front of her, locking her fingers with the thumbs\r\nstraight up, gently moving them up and down, before she spoke.\r\n\r\nThe gesture was familiar. It was the Premier's own, and a howl\r\nof recognition came from the audience, beginning in the Cabinet\r\nMinister's box.\r\n\r\nShe tenderly teetered on her heels, waiting for them to quiet down,\r\nbut that was the occasion for another outburst.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen of the Delegation,\" she said, when she could be heard, \"I\r\nam glad to see you!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice, a throaty contralto, had in it a cordial paternalism that\r\nwas as familiar as the Premier's face.\r\n\r\n\"Glad to see you--come any time, and ask for anything you like. You\r\nare just as welcome this time as you were the last time! We like\r\ndelegations--and I congratulate this delegation on their splendid,\r\ngentlemanly manners. If the men in England had come before their\r\nParliament with the frank courtesy you have shown, they might still\r\nhave been enjoying the privilege of meeting their representatives in\r\nthis friendly way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, gentlemen, you are your own answer to the question; you are the\r\nproduct of an age which has not seen fit to bestow the gift you ask,\r\nand who can say that you are not splendid specimens of mankind? No!\r\nNo! any system which can produce the virile, splendid type of men we\r\nhave before us today, is good enough for me, and,\" she added, drawing\r\nup her shoulders in perfect imitation of the Premier when he was about\r\nto be facetious, \"if it is good enough for me--it is good enough for\r\nanybody.\"\r\n\r\nThe people gasped with the audacity of it! The impersonation was\r\nso good--it was weird--it was uncanny. Yet there was no word of\r\ndisrespect. The Premier's nearest friends could not resent it.\r\n\r\nWord for word, she proceeded with his speech, while the theatre rocked\r\nwith laughter. She was in the Premier's most playful, God-bless-you\r\nmood, and simply radiated favors and goodwill. The delegation was\r\nflattered, complimented, patted on the head, as she dilated on their\r\nmanly beauty and charm.\r\n\r\nIn the third seat from the back, Mr. Robertson Jones had removed his\r\ndark glasses, and was breathing like a man with double pneumonia. A\r\ndull, red rage burned in his heart, not so much at anything the girl\r\nwas saying, as the perfectly idiotic way the people laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't laugh,\" a woman ahead of him said, as she wiped her\r\neyes, \"for my husband has a Government job and he may lose it if the\r\nGovernment members see me but if I don't laugh, I'll choke. Better\r\nlose a job than choke.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my dear young friends,\" the Premier was saying, \"I am convinced\r\nyou do not know what you are asking me to do;\" her tone was didactic\r\nnow; she was a patient Sunday School teacher, laboring with a class of\r\nerring boys, charitable to their many failings and frailties, hopeful\r\nof their ultimate destiny, \"you do not know what you ask. You have not\r\nthought of it, of course, with the natural thoughtlessness of your\r\nsex. You ask for something which may disrupt the whole course of\r\ncivilization. Man's place is to provide for his family, a hard enough\r\ntask in these strenuous days. We hear of women leaving home, and we\r\nhear it with deepest sorrow. Do you know why women leave home? There\r\nis a reason. Home is not made sufficiently attractive. Would letting\r\npolitics enter the home help matters. Ah no! Politics would unsettle\r\nour men. Unsettled men mean unsettled bills--unsettled bills mean\r\nbroken homes--broken vows--and then divorce.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice was heavy with sorrow, and full of apology for having\r\nmentioned anything so unpleasant.\r\n\r\nMany of the audience had heard the Premier's speech, and almost all\r\nhad read it, so not a point was lost.\r\n\r\nAn exalted mood was on her now--a mood that they all knew well. It\r\nhad carried elections. It was the Premier's highest card. His friends\r\ncalled it his magnetic appeal.\r\n\r\n\"Man has a higher destiny than politics,\" she cried, with the ring in\r\nher voice that they had heard so often, \"what is home without a bank\r\naccount? The man who pays the grocer rules the world. Shall I call men\r\naway from the useful plow and harrow, to talk loud on street corners\r\nabout things which do not concern them. Ah, no, I love the farm and\r\nthe hallowed associations--the dear old farm, with the drowsy tinkle\r\nof cow-bells at even tide. There I see my father's kindly smile so\r\nfull of blessing, hardworking, rough-handed man he was, maybe, but\r\nable to look the whole world in the face.... You ask me to change all\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice shook with emotion, and drawing a huge white linen\r\nhandkerchiefs from the folds of her gown, she cracked it by the corner\r\nlike a whip, and blew her nose like a trumpet.\r\n\r\nThe last and most dignified member of the Cabinet, caved in at this,\r\nand the house shook with screams of laughter. They were in the mood\r\nnow to laugh at anything she said.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder will she give us one of his rages,\" whispered the Provincial\r\nSecretary to the Treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad he's not here,\" said the Minister of Municipalities, \"I'm\r\nafraid he would burst a blood vessel; I'm not sure but I will myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am the chosen representative of the people, elected to the highest\r\noffice this fair land has to offer. I must guard well its interests.\r\nNo upsetting influence must mar our peaceful firesides. Do you never\r\nread, gentlemen?\" she asked the delegation, with biting sarcasm, \"do\r\nyou not know of the disgraceful happenings in countries cursed by\r\nmanhood suffrage? Do you not know the fearful odium into which the\r\npolls have fallen--is it possible you do not know the origin of that\r\noffensive word 'Poll-cat'; do you not know that men are creatures of\r\nhabit--give them an inch--and they will steal the whole sub-division,\r\nand although it is quite true, as you say, the polls are only open\r\nonce in four years--when men once get the habit--who knows where it\r\nwill end--it is hard enough to keep them at home now! No, history is\r\nfull of unhappy examples of men in public life; Nero, Herod, King\r\nJohn--you ask me to set these names before your young people. Politics\r\nhas a blighting, demoralizing influence on men. It dominates them,\r\nhypnotizes them, pursues them even after their earthly career is over.\r\nTime and again it has been proven that men came back and voted--even\r\nafter they were dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe audience gasped at that--for in the Premier's own riding, there\r\nwere names on the voters' lists, taken, it was alleged, from the\r\ntombstones.\r\n\r\n\"Do you ask me to disturb the sacred calm of our cemetries?\" she\r\nasked, in an awe-striken tone--her big eyes filled with the horror of\r\nit. \"We are doing wery well just as we are, very well indeed. Women\r\nare the best students of economy. Every woman is a student of\r\npolitical economy. We look very closely at every dollar of public\r\nmoney, to see if we couldn't make a better use of it ourselves, before\r\nwe spend it. We run our elections as cheaply as they are run anywhere.\r\nWe always endeavor to get the greatest number of votes for the least\r\npossible amount of money. That is political economy.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an interruption then from the Opposition benches, a feeble\r\nprotest from one of the private members.\r\n\r\nThe Premier's face darkened; her eyebrows came down suddenly; the\r\nveins in her neck swelled, and a perfect fury of words broke from her\r\nlips. She advanced threateningly on the unhappy member.\r\n\r\n\"You think you can instruct a person older than yourself, do\r\nyou--you-with the brains of a butterfly, the acumen of a bat; the\r\nbackbone of a jelly-fish. You can tell me something, can you? I\r\nwas managing governments when you were sitting in your high chair,\r\ndrumming on a tin plate with a spoon.\" Her voice boomed like a gun.\r\n\"You dare to tell me how a government should be conducted.\"\r\n\r\nThe man in the third seat from the back held to the arm of the seat,\r\nwith hands that were clammy with sweat. He wanted to get up and\r\nscream. The words, the voice, the gestures were as familiar as his own\r\nface in the glass.\r\n\r\nWalking up and down, with her hands at right angles to her body, she\r\nstormed and blustered, turning eyes of rage on the audience, who\r\nrolled in their seats with delight.\r\n\r\n\"Who is she, Oh Lord. Who is she?\" the Cabinet ministers asked each\r\nother for the hundredth time.\r\n\r\n\"But I must not lose my temper,\" she said, calming herself and letting\r\nher voice drop, \"and I never do--never--except when I feel like\r\nit--and am pretty sure I can get away with it. I have studied\r\nself-control, as you all know--I have had to, in order that I may be a\r\nleader. If it were not for this fatal modesty, which on more than\r\none occasion has almost blighted my political career, I would say\r\nI believe I have been a leader, a factor in building up this fair\r\nprovince; I would say that I believe I have written my name large\r\nacross the face of this Province.\"\r\n\r\nThe government supporters applauded loudly.\r\n\r\n\"But gentlemen,\" turning again to the delegation, \"I am still of the\r\nopinion even after listening to your cleverly worded speeches, that\r\nI will go on just as I have been doing, without the help you so\r\ngenerously offer. My wish for this fair, flower-decked land is that I\r\nmay long be spared to guide its destiny in world affairs. I know there\r\nis no one but me--I tremble when I think of what might happen these\r\nleaderless lambs--but I will go forward confidently, hoping that the\r\ngood ship may come safely into port, with the same old skipper on the\r\nbridge. We are not worrying about the coming election, as you may\r\nthink. We rest in confidence of the result, and will proudly unfurl,\r\nas we have these many years, the same old banner of the grand old\r\nparty that had gone down many times to disgrace, but thank God, never\r\nto defeat.\"\r\n\r\nThe curtain fell, as the last word was spoken, but rose again to show\r\nthe \"House\" standing, in their evening gowns. A bouquet of American\r\nbeauty roses was handed up over the foot-lights to the Premier, who\r\nburied her face in them, with a sudden flood of loneliness. But the\r\ncrowd was applauding, and gain and again she was called forward.\r\n\r\nThe people came flocking in through the wings, pleading to be\r\nintroduced to the \"Premier,\" but she was gone.\r\n\r\nIn the crowd that ebbed slowly from the exits, no one noticed the\r\nstout gentleman with the dark glasses, who put his hat on before he\r\nreached the street, and seemed to be in great haste.\r\n\r\nThe comments of the people around him, jabbed him like poisoned\r\narrows, and seared his heart like flame.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder was the Premier there,\" one man asked, wiping the traces\r\nof merriment from his glasses, \"I've laughed till I'm sore--but I'm\r\nafraid he wouldn't see the same fun in it as I do\":\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he's sport enough to laugh at this, I'll say he's some man,\"\r\nsaid another.\r\n\r\n\"That girl sure has her nerve--there isn't a man in this city would\r\ndare do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"She'll get his goat--if he ever hears her--I'd advise the old man to\r\nstay away.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's holding a mirror up to public life all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who is she?\"\r\n\r\n\"The government will be well advised to pension that girl and get her\r\nout of the country--a few more sessions of the Women's Parliament, and\r\nthe government can quit.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried out into the brilliantly lighted street, stung by the\r\nlaughter and idle words. His heart was bursting with rage, blind,\r\nbitter choking. He had been laughed at, ridiculed, insulted--and the\r\nmen, whom he had made--had sat by applauding.\r\n\r\nJohn Graham had, all his life, dominated his family circle, his\r\nfriends, his party, and for the last five years had ruled the\r\nProvince. Success, applause, wealth, had come easily to him, and he\r\nhad taken them as naturally as he accepted the breath of his nostrils.\r\nThey were his. But on this bright night in May, as he went angrily\r\ndown the back street, unconsciously striking the pavement with his\r\ncane, with angry blows, the echo of the people's laughter in his ears\r\nwas bitter as the pains of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCOMPENSATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day the Premier kept to his room, and refused to look at the\r\npapers. The cabinet ministers telephoned in vain; he was out, the\r\nmaid said. He hated them, every one--for their insane laughter their\r\nidiotic applause--this disloyal attendance at such a place! He could\r\nnot speak to them or see them.\r\n\r\nWhen his wife spoke to him, he snapped back at her like an angry\r\nrattlesnake, and asked her why she had never tried to develop a mind\r\nof her own. Her patience, submissiveness, the abject way she deferred\r\nto him and tried to please him--the very qualities he had demanded of\r\nher, now infuriated him beyond words. He began to despise her for her\r\nspiritless submission.\r\n\r\nFortunately for her, the days that followed took him away from home,\r\nand the household breathed easier each time he departed.\r\n\r\n\"This settles it,\" said Rosie, the housemaid, when he went out angrily\r\nslamming the front door. \"I will never marry a member of Parliament,\r\nno, not though he goes on his bended knee to ask me. I may not have\r\nwealth or fame--but I'll have peace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be too sure,\" said the cook, who was Scotch, and a\r\nPresbyterian. \"You can't be sure of any of them--they are all queer.\r\nYou never know what a man will do till he's dead.\"\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Parliament held sessions for three nights in the city\r\nbefore it began its tour of the country with every night an audience\r\nthat packed the theatre to the roof. Each night the woman \"Premier\"\r\ntook her curtain calls and received the bouquets which came showering\r\nin, but not a word could the public find out about her. The papers\r\nsaid her identity would remain a mystery until all the engagements\r\nwere filled.\r\n\r\nOn the last night, when Pearl went to her room--she was staying with\r\nthe President of the Woman's Club--a box of flowers was on her table.\r\nWhen she opened it, she found an armful of American Beauty roses, and\r\na letter. Pearl's face went suddenly aflame like the roses, and a\r\njagged flash of lightning tore her heart. He had not forgotten her!\r\n\r\nHastily locking her door, for no one must interrupt her, Pearl read\r\nher letter. She had faced three thousand people two hours before, but\r\nher hand trembled now as she read:\r\n\r\n\"I have been in your audience, Pearl, drinking in every word you say,\r\nrejoicing over you, loving you--but glad every minute that I played\r\nthe game fair. You have won the election--of that I am sure--for you\r\nhave set the whole Province laughing at the old-style politician. It\r\nis easy going for the rest of us now. Our old friend George Steadman\r\nhas had the ground torn from under his feet. They all think you left\r\nPurple Springs to take some gentle and safe job in the Department of\r\nEducation, and are breathing curses on this mysterious stranger who\r\nhas upset the foundations of the Government. Driggs suspected as soon\r\nas he heard about the play, and he and I came into the city to see for\r\nourselves--we held hands to keep from disgracing ourselves last night\r\nwhen you got up to speak.\r\n\r\n\"The leader of the Opposition, who seems to be a solid sort of chap,\r\nwould like to meet you when it is all over--he is well pleased with\r\nthe women's activities, and especially your part, and wants to meet\r\nyou personally.\r\n\r\n\"I do not need to tell you, dear, what I think. I believe you know.\r\nI am in a mellow and pleasant state of being able to say 'I told you\r\nso.'\r\n\r\n\"I am not sending you roses because I think you are short of bouquets,\r\nbut just because there are certain things a red rose can say, that I\r\ncan not. H.C.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why can't you say it?\" Pearl whispered, \"and why don't you say\r\nit, and me hungry for it. Who is stopping you from saying it--I'm sure\r\nit's not me.\"\r\n\r\nShe threw aside her pride, and going to the phone, called the hotel\r\nwhere she knew he stayed.\r\n\r\n\"Is Dr. Clay of Millford there?\" she asked, trembling with eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute,\" said the clerk.\r\n\r\nPearl's heart was pounding in her throat, her ears sang, her mouth was\r\ndry with excitement. She wanted to hear his voice--she wanted to see\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a long, long time--then the clerk's voice, mechanical and\r\ndull as the click of an adding machine:\r\n\r\n\"No, Dr. Clay checked out tonight.\"\r\n\r\nPearl hung up the receiver listlessly. The ripple of laughter and\r\nwaves of voices came from the drawing-room below. A company of people\r\nhad come over from the theatre, some one was calling to her outside\r\nher door, asking her if she would come down.\r\n\r\nSuddenly it had all become distasteful to her,\r\nhollow--useless--vain--what was there in it?--a heavy sense of\r\ndisappointment was on her. After all, was life going to disappoint\r\nher, cheat her--giving her so much, and yet withholding the greatest\r\njoy of all?\r\n\r\nShe caught the roses in her arms, and kissed them fiercely. \"I love\r\nyou--red roses,\" she said, \"but you are not enough. You do not say\r\nmuch either, but I wish you would tell me why he is so stingy with\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a week, the election was over, and the Government defeated. The\r\nnewspapers, in red headlines, gave the women the credit, and declared\r\nit to be the most sensational campaign the country had ever seen. \"The\r\nbarbed arrows of ridicule had pierced the strong man's armor,\" one\r\neditorial said, \"and accomplished something that the heaviest blows of\r\nthe Opposition had been powerless to achieve.\" Dr. Clay had defeated\r\nGeorge Steadman by a large majority, and the Millford \"Mercury\" was\r\nfree to express itself editorially, and did so with great vigor.\r\n\r\nThe Premier had fought valiantly to the last, but his power was\r\ngone--the spell broken--he could no longer rouse an audience with his\r\nold-time eloquence. His impassioned passages had lost their punch, for\r\nthe bitterness, the rage which filled his heart, showed in his words\r\nand weakened them; and the audiences who before had been kindled with\r\nhis phrases, showed a disposition now to laugh in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nThe week of the campaign had been to him a week of agony, for he knew\r\nhe was failing as a leader, and only his stern pride kept him going.\r\nHe would let no one say he was a \"welsher.\" The machine worked night\r\nand day, and money was freely spent, and until the last, he hoped,\r\nhis party would be returned, and then he could resign and retire\r\nhonorably. He did not believe the machine could be defeated. They had\r\ntoo many ways of controlling the vote.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the Government's defeat began to come in from the\r\ncountry places--the city seats having all gone to the Opposition--the\r\nold man went quietly home, with a set face of ashy pallor. He walked\r\nslowly, with sagging shoulders, and the cane which he used, did not\r\nbeat the pavement in rage, but gropingly felt its way, uncertainly, as\r\nif the hand which guided it was hesitant and weak.\r\n\r\nIn his house on Water Street, a big, square brick house, with\r\nplain verandahs, the ex-Premier sat alone that night. A few of his\r\nfollowers--the close-in favorites--had called to see him, but had been\r\ndenied. His wife, flutteringly made excuses. He sat in his big black\r\nleather chair, looking into the fireplace, where no fire was kindled,\r\nand when one of the maids had come in to build the fire, he had gently\r\ntold her he liked it better as it was, dull, bleak and dead, it suited\r\nthe occasion--and she had gone out hurriedly, and in the kitchen burst\r\ninto tears.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't natural for him to be mild like that,\" she sobbed to the\r\ncook. \"I'd rather have him damn me up and down. The old man's heart is\r\nbroken, that's what it is. He's sittin' there so calm and quiet--it\r\nwould make any one cry that has known him in his good days. I don't\r\nbelieve we'll ever hear him rip and tear again--the blessed old dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well indeed, I'll be glad if we don't,\" said the cook grimly. \"He's\r\nraised enough hell in his time for one man, if he never does another\r\nturn at it. I've put up with him for over fifteen years. I saw him\r\ndrive out Master Jim, and Jim's poor wife, with the dearest little pet\r\nof a grandson any man ever had. He was sorry enough after, but that\r\ndidn't bring them back. I hope he will sit still for a while and think\r\nit all over, and give the poor missis a rest. She's been bawled at,\r\nand sworn at enough too, and her that gentle and pleasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"She's cryin' in her room now,\" said the housemaid, dabbin' her\r\neyes with her handkerchief and wishin' he'd come up and rage over\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, is she?\" said the cook. \"I'll bet she's not. The house is so quiet\r\nit makes her nervous--that's all! But she'll get used to it. O no,\r\nRosie dear, he's got his, and it's about time. I ain't worryin' over\r\nhim, for all I like the old man--but I believe the day of judgment\r\nbegins here. He's reaping what he sowed--and all I wonder at is that\r\nthe harvest has been so late.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right for you--you're a Presbyterian,\" said Rosie\r\ntearfully, \"but I belong to the Army. You know God's side of it\r\nbettern' I do, but we're all for the sinner, and I can't bear to see\r\nhim so quiet and mild. It's just like havin' a corpse in the house\r\nto see him there in front of the dead fire; I wouldn't wonder if the\r\nmorning light will find him cold and stiff in death.\" Rosie's tears\r\ngushed forth anew at this sad picture.\r\n\r\n\"No chance,\" said the cook, \"I haven't cooked breakfast for him for\r\nfifteen years without knowin' him better than that. He'll come back.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Presbyterian cook, so sure of her theology and her knowledge\r\nof human nature, had no breakfast to cook for him the next day, for\r\nthe ex-Premier kept his bed, and declined to see any one except\r\nhis wife, whom he did not let out of his sight. His gentleness was\r\nterrible--he was even pleasant. When Rosie brought the mail to the\r\ndoor, he actually thanked her, which brought on another paroxysm of\r\ntears, and made even the cook shake her head doubtfully.\r\n\r\nHe spoke little, and made no complaint. He was only tired, he\r\nsaid--just a little weary. No, he would not see a doctor--it was not a\r\ndoctor he needed.\r\n\r\nBeside him sat his wife, the quiet, self-effacing little woman who had\r\nhad no thought or ambition apart from him. Under half closed eyes, he\r\nwatched her, wonderingly. What were the thoughts of her heart--this\r\ngentle-faced woman who had so tenderly cared for him, and put up with\r\nhim all these years. Many a time he had made her cry--he had driven\r\naway her son--and her grandson--and yet she had offered no word of\r\nremonstrance. How old and sad she looked when her face was in repose.\r\nIt was a face of deep lines and great sadness--a wistful, troubled,\r\nhungry face, but dominated by a self-control of iron power. She sat\r\nbeside the bed, without moving; waiting, watchful.\r\n\r\n\"You've been good to me, Jessie,\" he said at last, as he stroked her\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nShe started nervously.\r\n\r\n\"Better than I have been to you--but I am going to be better--it is\r\nnot too late yet.\"\r\n\r\nWith eyes of alarm, growing wider every moment--she watched him as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I needed a set-back,\" he said, \"and I got it--and I've\r\nlearned a lot in a short time. One thing was that you are more to me\r\nthan I thought. My friends--in politics--were everything to me--but\r\nthey valued me only for what I could do for them. I could harangue the\r\ncrowd--gather in the votes--keep things going. I remembered every one,\r\nslapped every one on the back, called them by their first name--and it\r\nwent. But they laughed at me behind my back. Their only interest in me\r\nwas that I could carry elections. With you, it has been different. I\r\ndon't know why you stuck to me. Why did you, Jessie?\"\r\n\r\nWithout replying, she hastily left the room--and phoned for the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nThe papers that night reported the ex-Premier's condition as \"causing\r\ngrave apprehension to his friends.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl read it in the evening papers, she made a quick resolve. A\r\nletter must be sent to Purple Springs.\r\n\r\nWhen Annie Gray and Jim went to the post-office for the mail, two days\r\nafter the election, they were not disappointed, for Pearl had written.\r\n\r\n\"It is all over,\" wrote Pearl, \"and the Government has gone down to\r\ndefeat. The new Government will make good its promises too. But I am\r\nsure from what I have heard and seen of your father-in-law, you have\r\nnothing to fear from him. He would not take little Jim away from you\r\neven if he could. You can tell the people of Purple Springs all about\r\nyourself now, and wouldn't I like to see Mrs. Cowan's face when she\r\nhears who your father-in-law is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tonight's paper says he is not well, and I am wondering if you hadn't\r\nbetter come in to the city, you and Jim. You will know best about\r\nthis. I feel sorry for Mr. Graham. He is a domineering old man, full\r\nof prejudice and narrow ways. There could be no progress so long as he\r\nwas at the head of affairs--so he had to be removed. He held the\r\ndoor shut just as long as he could, and when the crash came, quite\r\nnaturally he was trampled on, and that is never a pleasant experience.\r\nBut the whole thing has a pathetic side. I wish it could have been\r\nsettled without this.\r\n\r\n\"The night of the election, women paraded the streets, singing and\r\ncheering, mad with joy, it made my eyes blur to see them. I am sorry\r\nit had to come to a show-down, for it seems to set men and women\r\nagainst each other--at least, I know some men feel that way. Of course\r\nwe had lots of men helping us--we could not have got far without them.\r\nPeter Neelands has been one of the best. He was elected in one of the\r\ncity seats, and we are all so glad.\r\n\r\n\"Here are some stamps and two balloons for Jim. I do hope you will\r\ncome--. Lovingly, Pearl.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe winds of June, which whipped the dust of Water Street into\r\nminiature whirlwinds under the noses of the horses, were heavy with\r\nthe unmistakable perfume of wild roses. The delivery man, sniffing\r\nthe air, decided he would go that night to the Beach, just to see the\r\nfields of roses; the streetcar-conductor went suddenly homesick for a\r\nsight of the poplar trees, with the roses on the headlands, and the\r\nplushy touch of green grass under his feet, and the wizened little\r\nScotch milliner across the road took what she called a \"scunner\" at\r\nthe silk and muslin flowers, with their odious starchy, stuffy smell,\r\nand wondered where the farmer was, who two years ago had asked her\r\nto marry him. The wind--heavy with the perfume that stirred so many\r\nhearts with longing, eddied carelessly into the garden of the big\r\nbrick house with the plain verandas, doubling round to the garden\r\nat the back, where, in an old-fashioned rocking chair with chintz\r\ncushions, sat the ex-Premier.\r\n\r\nThe wind, still charged with wild roses, stirred the lilac trees and\r\nmountain ash, and circled noiselessly around the chair where he sat,\r\nand played queer tricks with his memory, for all of us are young in\r\nJune, when the pageant of summer is passing by.\r\n\r\n\"I like to see you knitting, Jessie,\" he said gently \"it is a peaceful\r\nart, untouched by worldly cares. I wish I could hear hens cackling,\r\nand the drowsy sounds of a farmyard, all set in nature's honest key.\r\nI'm tired of people and machinery and telephones and committees, and\r\nall these other inventions of the devil.\"\r\n\r\nRosie, scrubbing the veranda, hearing the last part of the sentence,\r\npiously thanked God for the master's returning health of body and\r\nmind, and flattened her head against the veranda post, to catch more.\r\n\r\n\"The things I have given my life to,\" he said sadly, \"have fallen away\r\nfrom me--I built on a foundation of sand, and when the rains descended\r\nand the floods came, my house fell and left me by the ruins, groping\r\nin the ashes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't so bad as that, James,\" his wife said timidly. \"You are a\r\nrespected man still, you know you are--you have plenty of friends, if\r\nyou would only let them come. It's no disgrace for a public man to be\r\ndefeated.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not that, Jessie,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter to me now what\r\nthe world thinks, it can't think any worse of me than I think of it.\r\nNo, the bitterest part of all this to me is that I have none of my\r\nown. I want some one of my own. I was too harsh--too hasty.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Jim had lived,\" she began, wistfully--\r\n\r\nThe front veranda bell pealed loudly, and Rosie hastily wiped her\r\nhands on her petticoat, and went to answer it, sorry to miss any part\r\nof the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"I won't see any one,\" said the ex-Premier, again. \"She knows--I\r\nwon't. Go and tell her I won't.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Rosie opened the door, a card was put in her hand, and the\r\nvisitor, a young lady, asked her if she would be good enough to give\r\nit to the ex-Premier.\r\n\r\n\"He won't see you,\" said Rosie quickly. \"He won't see any one. I am\r\nturning them away by the dozens.\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor took the card from Rosie's hand, and hastily wrote a few\r\nwords on it. Rosie told the cook about it afterwards.\r\n\r\n\"She had eyes like a fairy princess, lips like cherries, and the\r\nnicest clothes, but you could tell she wasn't thinkin' about them. I\r\njust wanted her to stay and talk to me. 'Will you give this to him,'\r\nshe said to me, 'I'll wait here, and if he doesn't want to see me--it\r\nis all right--I will go away--but I think he will want to see me,'\r\nsays she, with a smile at me that made me want him to see her too, and\r\nshe sat down on one of the veranda chairs.\r\n\r\n\"When I gave him the card, he read it out loud--ain't he the nicest\r\never? Lots of people wouldn't have read it out. 'Miss Pearl Watson,'\r\nsays he, and what's this, 'teacher at Purple Springs,' and he nearly\r\njumped out of his chair.\r\n\r\n\"'My God!' he says, and he reached for his cane, like as if he was\r\ngoing somewhere. 'Bring her here,' he said, and his voice was more\r\nnatural than it has been since--it made me all prickle,\" said Rosie.\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl was taken around to the back garden, Rosie retired to a\r\npoint of vantage on the sleeping-porch above, and got most of the\r\nconversation, by abandoning all scrubbing operations, and sitting very\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Premier's wife arose as if to leave, but he motioned her to\r\nstay.\r\n\r\n\"This concerns you too, Jessie,\" he said.\r\n\r\nFor a moment a silence fell on them, as the wind gently stirred the\r\nlilacs in front of them and a humming bird on silken wings went\r\nflashing past, like a flower that had come alive.\r\n\r\n\"You are a teacher, your card says, at Purple Springs. Is that in the\r\nfar North?\" The ex-Premier endeavored to speak calmly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Pearl, \"it is only a hundred miles from here.\"\r\n\r\nHis face clouded with disappointment.\r\n\r\n\"But it was named for the valley in the far North, by a woman who came\r\nfrom there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the woman now,\" he asked, with a fine attempt to make his\r\nquestion casual.\r\n\r\n\"I came to tell you about her,\" said Pearl, with evasion. \"That is, of\r\ncourse, if you would like to hear. It is an interesting story.\"\r\n\r\nHe motioned to her to begin, trembling with excitement.\r\n\r\nPearl told the story that had been told to her the night she and Annie\r\nGray had sat by the dying fire, told it, with many a touch of pathos\r\nand realism, which made it live before him. His eyes never left her\r\nface, though he could not discover how much she knew, and yet the very\r\nfact of her coming to him seemed to prove that she knew everything.\r\n\r\nThe old man's face twitched painfully when she spoke of the young\r\nwidow's quarrel with her husband's father.\r\n\r\n\"He was not accustomed to having his wishes thwarted,\" said Pearl\r\nsimply. \"He was a man whose word was law in his own household and\r\namong his friends. But she had the freedom of the wilderness in her\r\nblood, and they quarrelled violently. He was determined to send the\r\nboy to England for his education.\"\r\n\r\n\"He only said that--he wouldn't have done it--he loved the boy too\r\nwell,\" he burst in, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, the young mother did not know that--not being a\r\nmind-reader, she had no way of telling--and besides, he threatened to\r\ntake the child from her altogether. He was his son's heir, and he was\r\ntherefore the guardian of the child. The law was with him, I believe,\r\nin that. That is one of the laws that have roused the women to take a\r\nhand in public matters.\r\n\r\n\"So, to save her boy, to keep him for her very own--she allowed her\r\nfather-in-law to think she had not been legally married. She gave up\r\nher good name, to keep her boy. She went away--with only her two hands\r\nto make a living for them both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\" cried the old man, with something of his old\r\nimperiousness.\r\n\r\nPearl did not at once reply. He should hear all of the story. She did\r\nnot minimize the hard struggle that Annie Gray had had in her attempts\r\nat self support, even when she saw the old man wince. He got it all.\r\n\r\n\"When she came to the farm on the Souris, she could not tell her\r\nstory--the fear was on her night and day that she might be discovered,\r\nand the child taken from her.\"\r\n\r\n\"No judge in the country would do that,\" he cried stormily. \"She had\r\nnothing to fear even if--if--\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately,\" said Pearl quietly, \"she did not know that. She\r\nbelieved her father-in-law. She thought it was true, because he had\r\nsaid so, and she knew that the illegitimate child belongs to the\r\nmother, and to her alone, so she chose to let it stand at that.\r\n\r\n\"The people at Purple Springs adopted the name she had put upon her\r\ngate--but ostracized her. The fact that she did not tell them anything\r\nof her part, was proof to them she was not a good woman, and a man\r\nfrom Ontario, who knew something about the case, fed the curiosity of\r\nher neighbors with gossip which confirmed their suspicions.\"\r\n\r\n\"For three years she has lived alone, not a neighbor has come to her\r\ndoor--and she has kept herself and little Jim; has worked the\r\nfarm, educated her boy, for the trustees would not let him come to\r\nschool--kept sweet and sane in spite of it all.\r\n\r\n\"When I went to see her, she cried with joy to see a human being of\r\nkindly intention in her house. But the neighbors cut me dead, and kept\r\nthe children home from school because I went to live with her.\"\r\n\r\nA groan broke from him. \"Poor girl!\" he said brokenly, \"Poor girl, she\r\ndidn't deserve that.\"\r\n\r\nPearl's heart was softening, so she hurried on.\r\n\r\n\"The little fellow got into a fight at school, because a boy said\r\nthings about his mother. He is the sweetest tempered child I ever\r\nknew, but he knew when to fight, and thrashed a boy a head taller than\r\nhimself; and the trustees turned him out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What kind of people are they?\" he stormed. \"It was a brave thing for\r\nthe boy to defend his mother--a brave thing I tell you. The other boy\r\nshould have been expelled--you are the teacher--why did you let them?\"\r\n\r\nPearl let him rage, then very quietly she said, \"It happened three\r\nyears before I knew them--but you should not blame the boy, Mr.\r\nGraham, or even the trustees. They were under no obligation to protect\r\nthe woman or her boy. The boy's own grandfather had said much worse\r\nthings about her than the boy at the school. He not only insulted\r\nher, but his own son as well--when the rage was on him. So why should\r\nstrangers spare her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" he said hoarsely, \"let me hear it all.\"\r\n\r\nShe was standing in front of him now, and her eyes were driving the\r\ntruth deep into his soul. Something about her eyes, or her voice with\r\nits rich mellowness, caused him to start and exclaim.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you, girl--tell me, who you are--I have heard your voice\r\nsomewhere! My God! was it you? was it you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Pearl, \"it was me; and when the women of the city here,\r\nwho had come to you and tried to break down your stubborn prejudices,\r\ntried to reason with you, but found it all in vain; when they told me\r\nthat first night to think of some sad case that I had known of women\r\nwho had suffered from the injustice of the law and men's prejudice,\r\nand strike without mercy, I thought of your daughter-in-law and all\r\nthat she had suffered. I saw again the hungry look in her sweet face,\r\nwhen I went to see her. I saw the gray hairs and the lines of sorrow;\r\nI saw again the heroic efforts she makes to give her boy everything\r\nthat the world is bent on denying him--I thought of these things--and\r\nthe rest was easy. There was no other way, sir; you would not listen;\r\nyou would not move an inch--you had to be broken!\"\r\n\r\nSpeechless, almost breathless, he looked at her--all the fight had\r\ngone out of him.\r\n\r\n\"I am going now, sir,\" she said. \"I have delivered her message. She\r\nonly wanted to clear your son's memory. She will tell the people now\r\nwho she is, and prove her marriage, for little Jim's sake.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, girl,\" he cried, \"sit down--tell me more. Tell me what the\r\nboy is like--how big is he?\" \"The boy is like you,\" said Pearl, \"a\r\ntall lad for ten; clever far beyond his years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he know about me--does he hate me--has she told him?\" His voice\r\nwas pitiful in its eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word--the boy has a heart of love, and as sunny a disposition\r\nas any child could have. She has made his life a dream of happiness,\r\nin spite of all.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man's face began to quiver, and a sob tore its way upward from\r\nhis heart. His face was hidden in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Would she ever forgive me?\" he said, at last, lifting his head.\r\n\"Would she believe me if I said I was sorry--would she have pity on a\r\nbroken old man, who sees the evil he has done--would the boy let\r\nme love him--and try to make it up to him and his mother? You know\r\nher--why don't you answer me girl? Is there no hope that she might\r\nforgive me?\"\r\n\r\nPearl stepped back without a word, as Annie Gray came quickly across\r\nthe lawn. She had been standing in the shade of a maple tree, waiting\r\nfor Pearl's signal.\r\n\r\nA cry broke from Mrs. Graham, Jim's mother, a welcoming cry of joy.\r\n\r\nThe old man rose to his feet, uncertainly holding out both his hands.\r\n\r\n\"My girl,\" he cried \"I don't deserve it--but can you forgive me?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Annie Gray, who had suffered so bravely, so tearlessly, found her\r\nheart swept clean of resentment or bitter memory as she looked at him,\r\nfor it was Jim's father, old, sad and broken, who called to her, and\r\nto Jim's father's arms she went with a glad cry.\r\n\r\n\"Dad!\" she said, \"Oh Dad! Little Jim and I are very tired of being\r\norphans!\"\r\n\r\nAnd on the back veranda behind them, where she had been crouching with\r\nher ear to the paling, Rosie came out of hiding and burst out like a\r\nwhole hallelujah chorus, and with the empty scrub pail in one hand,\r\nand the brush in the other, beat the cymbals as she sang:\r\n\r\n  \"O that will be glory for me,\r\n  Glory for you and glory for me,\r\n  When by His grace I shall look on His face,\r\n  That will be glory for me!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nHOME AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nQuit your whistlin' Jimmy, and hold your whist--all of you--don't you\r\nknow your poor sister is dead for sleep. Hasn't she been up hill and\r\ndown dale this last six weeks. I never saw the like of it, and it's a\r\nGod's mercy she ever lived through it--and then last night when she\r\ndrove over from her school nothing would do your pa but she must talk\r\nhalf the night, when she should have been in bed. So now clear out you\r\nlads, and let's keep the house quiet, for Pearl is a light sleeper and\r\nalways was.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a light stepper too, ma, for here I am--up and dressed, and\r\nhungry as a bear.\" It was Pearl herself who opened the stairs' door.\r\n\r\nA shout of joy arose from the assembly in the kitchen, dearer to Pearl\r\nthan any burst of hand-clapping she had ever heard in a theatre, and\r\nthere was a rush for the first kiss, which Danny landed neatly, though\r\nwe must admit it was done by racing over his brother Patsey, who sat\r\non the floor tying his boot, and Patsey's ruffled feelings did not\r\nsubside until Pearl opened her valise, which stood inside the \"room\"\r\ndoor, and brought out jack-knives for the youngest four boys. Patsey\r\ndeclared, still smarting over the indignity of being run over, and\r\nstood upon, that Danny should not get a knife at all, but Mrs. Watson\r\ninterposed for her latest born by saying:\r\n\r\n\"O Patsey, dear, don't be hard on him. He was just that overjoyed at\r\nseein' Pearl, he never noticed what he was standin' on; anything would\r\nha' done him just as well as you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll overjoy him, you bet,\" grumbled Patsey--tenderly feeling the\r\nback of his neck, \"when I get him outside. I'll show him what it feels\r\nlike to have some one stand on your neck, with heavy boots.\"\r\n\r\nDanny made no defence, but gazed rapturously on his sister, and\r\nexpectantly at the valise, whose bulging sides gave forth promise of\r\ngreater treasures yet to come.\r\n\r\n\"I have some things here for broken hearts and rainy days,\" said\r\nPearl, \"that Ma and Mary will be placed in charge of. I believe a\r\nskinned neck should qualify, so if Patsey Watson will dry his tears\r\nand iron out his face and step back against the wall, close his\r\neyes--and smile--he will get a pleasant surprise.\"\r\n\r\nPatsey complied with all the conditions. Indeed, he not only smiled,\r\nhe grinned, showing a gaping expanse in the front of his mouth from\r\nwhich the middle tooth had gone, like a missing gate in a neat white\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nWhen Pearl placed a box in his hands, which contained the makings and\r\nfull directions for setting up a red and black box-kite, a picture of\r\nwhich in full flight adorned the cover, a war-whoop of joy rent the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n\"Ain't you the luckiest kid!\" cried Tommy enviously, as he crowded to\r\nget another look. \"If there's anything goin', you get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now clear out, all you boys, and let Pearl get her breakfast,\" said\r\nMary. \"I haven't had a chance to speak to her yet, and I want to know\r\nhow the girls are wearing their hair and how long a girl of sixteen\r\nshould wear her skirts, and lots of things.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys departed to make whistles with the new knives, Pearl offering\r\na prize for the shrillest and fartherest reaching; to be tried at\r\ntwelve o'clock noon, and silence settled once more on the kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"It's sort of too bad you came home on Saturday, Pearl,\" said her\r\nmother anxiously, as she toasted a slice of bread over the\r\nglowing wood coals. \"The boys will pester you to death today and\r\ntomorrow--though of course I know you have no other time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I like to be pestered, ma,\" said Pearl, as she began on a generous\r\nhelping of bacon and eggs. \"Home is the best place, ma, and I never\r\nknew just how good it was to have home and folks of my own, as the day\r\nI went to school and found no children there. Isn't it queer, ma,\r\nhow hard people can be on each other. It makes me afraid God must be\r\ndisappointed lots of times, and feel like pulling down another flood\r\nand getting away to a fresh start again.\r\n\r\n\"But I am not going to talk about anything--until I get back to\r\nfeeling the way I did when I went away. I want to see the hens and\r\nthe cows and the new pigs. I want to get out in the honest, freckly\r\nsunshine. Do the potatoes need hoeing, ma? All right, pa and I will\r\ngo at them. I like people, and all that, but I have to mix in lots of\r\nblue sky and plants, and a few good, honest horses, cows, dogs and\r\ncats--who have no underlying motives and are never suspicious or\r\njealous, and have no regrets over anything they've done.\"\r\n\r\n\"But don't you like the city, Pearl?\" Mary asked. \"Don't you wish we\r\nall lived there? I do, you bet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad my people live right here, Mary, out in the open, where\r\nthere's room to breathe and time to think. O, I like the city, with\r\nits street cars weaving the streets together like shuttles; I love\r\ntheir flashing blue and red and green lights, as they slide past the\r\nstreets, clanging their bells, and with faces looking out of the\r\nwindows, and every one of the people knowing where they are going. I\r\nlike the crowds that surge along the streets at night, and the good\r\ntimes they are having. I like it--for a visit. It's a great place to\r\ngo to--if you have your own folks with you--I think I'd like it--on a\r\nwedding trip--or the like of that.\r\n\r\n\"But I want to see everything 'round home,\" said Pearl quickly. \"Is\r\nthe garden all up, and what did you sow, and where are the hens set,\r\nand did the cabbage plants catch?\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet they did,\" said Mary proudly. \"I transplanted them, and I put\r\nthem in close. Pa said I would need to take out every second one, but\r\nI said we'd try them this way for once. You know the way cabbages\r\nsprawl and straggle all over the place--all gone to leaves. Well, mine\r\nwon't, you bet, they'll heart up, because there's nothing else for\r\nthem to do. Pa admits now its the best way. They've got no room to\r\ngrow spraddly and they're just a fine sight already. Cabbages are just\r\nlike any one else; it doesn't do to give them too much of their own\r\nway, and let them think they own the earth.\"\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over, Pearl, Mary and Mrs. Watson went out into\r\nthe hazy blue sunshine. The ravine below the house was musical with\r\nthrushes and meadow-larks. The blossoms had gone, and already the wild\r\ncherries and plums were forming their fruit. Cattle fed peacefully on\r\nthe river banks, and some were cropping the volunteer growth of oats\r\nthat had come on the summer fallow. The grain was just high enough to\r\nrun ripples of light, as the gentlest of breezes lazily passed.\r\n\r\nPearl remembered the hopes and visions that had come to her the first\r\nday she and her father had come to the farm, and through all its\r\ndilapidation and neglect, she had seen that it could be made into a\r\nhome of comfort and prosperity, and now the dream had come true. The\r\nWatson family were thriving; their farm had not failed them; comforts,\r\nand even a few luxuries were theirs, and Pearl's heart grew very soft\r\nand tender with a sense of gratitude.\r\n\r\nIt was not too good to be true, she thought, as she looked at the\r\ncomfortable home, the new barn and the populous farmyard spread out\r\nunder the quivering sunshine.\r\n\r\n\"It was not too good to be true,\" thought Pearl. \"I can't complain,\r\neven if some of my dreams have failed me--and maybe--who knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's got to come right,\" she thought it so hard, she looked up to see\r\nif Mary or her mother noticed. But they were busy with a hidden-away\r\nnest, just found in the willow windbreak.\r\n\r\nThe news of the neighborhood was given to her by Mary.\r\n\r\n\"The Paines are putting up a new house, Pearl, and Mrs. Paine has some\r\nreal nice clothes, and they seem to be getting on far better.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's good,\" said Pearl, and then added, with such deep conviction,\r\nas if she were trying to convince some one, she said:\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing too good to be true.\"\r\n\r\nAt noon, when all the family had been fed, and the horses were resting\r\nin the well-bedded stalls--John Watson gave himself and his horses a\r\ntwo hours' rest in the heat of the day--when every one was present,\r\nPearl told them something of her adventures on the six weeks of her\r\nabsence. Especially did she tell the young brothers of the lonesome\r\nlittle boy who had no playmates, but who loved his mother so much he\r\nwould not let her know that he was lonely.\r\n\r\nPatsey had a solution of the difficulty:\r\n\r\n\"Take me back, when you go, Pearl, and I'll play with him, and let him\r\nfly my kite n' everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, he isn't lonely now,\" Pearl said, \"thank you all the same--but I'm\r\ngoing to bring him over in the holidays, for he needs to play with\r\nboys of his own age.\"\r\n\r\n\"Danny better not run over him, and stand on his neck, though--he\r\nain't used to it--the way we are,\" Patsy said, but was promptly\r\nadvised to forget it, and let Pearl go on with the story, by Danny\r\nhimself, to whom the subject was growing painful.\r\n\r\n\"His grandfather and grandmother came out when we did,\" Pearl said,\r\n\"and they're staying at Purple Springs, and Jim and his grandfather\r\nare together all the time. Mrs. Gray--her real name is Mrs. Graham\r\nnow--doesn't want her boy brought up in the city, and his grandfather\r\nis tired of the city too, so they're all living in the brown house,\r\nand every day's a picnic day.\"\r\n\r\n\"But oh! say we did have one of the grandest picnics a week after we\r\ngot home from the city. On Mrs. Graham's farm there's a little stream\r\nwhich runs down to the river, and we got it cleaned out, and a big,\r\nlong table made, and seats and all. Jim and his grandfather did the\r\nwork--he was brought up on a farm, and can do anything. And the two\r\nwomen cooked for days, and I went round and asked every one to come to\r\nthe picnic--and I told them who Mrs. Gray was, and all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Told each one in a secret, I suppose, and told them not to tell,\"\r\nsaid her father, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you rubbed it in, good and plenty,\" said Mary, \"about them\r\nbein' so mean and full of bad thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did my best,\" said Pearl, \"especially with some of them who had had\r\nso much to say, and they were keen to come, I tell you, to meet the\r\nPremier. That's what he'll always be called, too, and he sure looked\r\nthat day when he sat at the head of the table, with the sunshine\r\ndappling the long table, with its salads and jellies and plates of\r\nsliced ham, and all the people sitting around kind of humble and\r\nsheepish. He wore his Prince Albert coat and his silk hat. He didn't\r\nwant to--he thought it wasn't the thing for a picnic, but I held him\r\nup to it, for I didn't want the people to see him in his corduroy\r\nhunting suit. I know how impressed they would be with the fine\r\nclothes, and I was determined they should have every thrill.\r\n\r\n\"So he put on all his good clothes, even to his gray spats. I had to\r\nargue a long time to get them on him. He said they looked foppish, but\r\nI just got the button-hook and put them on him while he was arguing,\r\nand asked him who thought of this picnic anyway! and he just laughed\r\nand said he guessed he had to pass under the rod.\r\n\r\n\"And after all the people had been introduced, and the men were\r\nstanding back, pretty hot and uncomfortable in their white shirts, he\r\ngot up and asked every one to have a seat at the table, for he wanted\r\nto say a few words before we began to eat.\r\n\r\n\"You could have heard a leaf fall, it was so still, and then he told\r\nthem all about his son, and how he didn't understand him, and never\r\nmade a chum of him, and how he was so taken up with politics he forgot\r\nto be a father to his own boy. And he told about his son's marriage,\r\nand the whole story, right up to the time I went to see him in the\r\ncity.\"\r\n\r\n\"'It's not easy telling this,' he said, 'but I put my daughter-in-law\r\nin wrong in this neighborhood, and I am going to make it right if I\r\ncan. She is a noble, brave woman,' he said, 'and I am proud of her. I\r\nlost the election,' he continued, 'but I am glad of it, for in losing\r\nit, I found a daughter and a grandson,' and then he put his hand on my\r\nshoulder and said, 'and here's the deepest conspirator in the country,\r\nwho managed the whole thing. This is the girl who made fun of me, and\r\nlambasted me, but who brought my daughter-in-law and me together,\r\nand when she runs for the Legislature, I promise I will get out and\r\ncampaign for her.'\r\n\r\n\"Every one laughed then, and the people crowded up around him, and\r\nAnnie, and you never saw so many people laughing and crying at the one\r\ntime in your life.\r\n\r\n\"We had a big boiler of coffee on the little tin stove in the trees,\r\nand I grabbed off the white pitchers, and the biggest girls from the\r\nschool helped serve, and we got the people all started in to eat, for\r\nit doesn't do to let people's feelings go too far.\r\n\r\n\"When they had quieted down a little, and were nearly through eating,\r\nthe minister, who was at the other end of the table, got up and said\r\nhe had an idea he wanted to pass on.\r\n\r\n\"'I'm ashamed,' he said--and I know he was--'of the way this community\r\nhas treated Mrs. Gray and Jimmy,'--he didn't seem able to call her\r\nanything else either. 'On behalf of the district of Purple Springs, I\r\napologize. We'll show our apology in something better than words, too,\r\nI hope,' he said, kind of swallowing his Adam's apple. 'We denied her\r\nchild the right to play with our children, through our stupid and\r\ncruel thoughtlessness, now let us apologize by doing something for all\r\nthe children of this neighborhood. This is a beautiful spot, a natural\r\npark; let us make it the Jim Gray Playgrounds, with swings, and\r\nsand-pile and acting bars and swimming pool, with a baseball ground up\r\non the hill; where all our children, young people and old people too,\r\ncan gather and be young and human and sociable together.'\r\n\r\n\"The people broke out into cheers and cries of 'We'll do it!' It\r\nseemed to relieve them.\r\n\r\n\"'And let us hold our church service here on Sundays, too, when the\r\nweather is fine. Our religion has been too stuffy, too mouldy, too\r\ndamp, too narrow. It needs the sunshine and the clear air of heaven to\r\nsweeten it and revive it. I feel it today, that God is in the sunshine\r\nmore than in the narrow limits we have tried to set upon Him.'\r\n\r\n\"'We sometimes deplore the tendency of our young people to go to the\r\ncity,' he continued, 'but I don't know as I blame them. We've been\r\nliving dull, drab lives for sure. Let us liven things up a bit, and\r\ngive our people something to look forward to during the week, and\r\nsomething pleasant to remember. It's the utter dreariness of life that\r\nkills people--not hard work.'\r\n\r\n\"And then,\" said Pearl, \"I could see the people wanted to sing or cry,\r\nor dance, or something, to work off their emotions; so I signalled to\r\nBessie Cowan, who is one of our best singers, to start a hymn that the\r\nchildren sing every morning. They knew it well, and the people had\r\nlearned it from them. I never heard anything like it. It flashed up\r\nthrough the highest branches of the trees, into the blue air. I am\r\nsure God heard it, and was pleased:\r\n\r\n  \"God is in His temple\r\n  Let the earth keep silent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Little Jim knew it too, and his voice was sweeter than all the rest.\r\nIt seemed easy for every one to talk or sing or laugh--or do whatever\r\nthey wanted to do. It was wonderful to see people come out of their\r\nhard brown husks and be natural and neighborly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, and it was more like a revival meetin' than a picnic, Pearlie,\"\r\nsaid her father, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"It was that, pa,\" she answered, \"and like a term in a reform school\r\nfor some of them. There had been a big quarrel among them about a\r\nroad-scraper, and the next day every one was offering to wait, instead\r\nof grabbing at it the way they had been; and the women who had fallen\r\nout over a sleeve pattern and fought rings round, and called each\r\nother everything they could name, made it up right there.\r\n\r\n\"Before they parted, they agreed to have the services there on\r\nSunday--that's tomorrow, and the ex-Premier is going to speak after\r\nthe service on 'How to Build a Community.' All the women are baking,\r\nand everybody will bring their visitors, instead of staying home from\r\nchurch the way they've been doing, and the children can play in the\r\nsand-pile, and sail their boats on the little creek, and it looks as\r\nif Purple Springs has experienced a change of heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think there's a danger of leadin' them to thinkin' too\r\nlight of the Lord's day, Pearlie, picknicking that way,\" asked her\r\nmother anxiously, \"and maybe makin' them lose their religion?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I'm not worried about that neighborhood losing its religion, ma,\"\r\nsaid Pearl. \"Any neighborhood that could treat a stranger the way\r\nthey did! But I do believe the sunshine and blue sky, the flowers and\r\nbirds, and the getting together, along with the words of the sermon\r\nand the hymns they'll sing, will make them a lot more human. I never\r\ncan think it would hurt God's feelings a bit to see children playing,\r\nand neighbors happy together on His day.\r\n\r\n\"They want us all to come; if you don't think it's too far to drive\r\nwith the whole family, and I've been training the children all week to\r\nsing--it looks like a good time.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll go!\" cried Danny and Patsey, with one voice, and with brotherly\r\nunity prevailing--for once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\"THERE IS NOTHING TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O don't touch it--it hurts,\" Danny wailed, when Pearl examined his\r\ngrimy little foot, from which a trickle of blood was showing through\r\nthe murk of prairie soil.\r\n\r\n\"Just let me wash it, dear,\" said Pearl soothingly. \"We cannot tell\r\nhow badly you are hurt until we get the dirt off. It may not be so bad\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the afternoon of the same day.\r\n\r\nDanny's tears came in torrents. \"It is bad,\" he sobbed. \"It's the\r\nworst sliver there's ever been in this family--or maybe in these\r\nparts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well now, maybe it is. I wouldn't wonder if we'll have to send for\r\nthe doctor,\" said Pearl, \"and that will be one on Patsey--he never\r\nhad a doctor in his life--and maybe never will. Just let me see how\r\nserious it is--and I'll promise you if I can't pull it out with my\r\nfingers--the doctor will be phoned for at once, and told to hurry.\"\r\n\r\nWith this promise to sustain him, Danny bravely submitted to a\r\nthoroughly good washing of the afflicted member, and even the\r\ncleansing of the other, for Pearl explained to him that feet came in\r\npairs, and had to be treated alike in matters of washing.\r\n\r\nBut the sliver refused to move, though Pearl appeared to try to pull\r\nit out.\r\n\r\n\"Send for the doctor, Pearl,\" Danny gasped. \"I'm getting weaker\r\nevery minute, and everything is goin' from me--and now its gettin'\r\ndark--can't some of yez light a lamp?\"\r\n\r\nDanny had heard his mother tell so many times the story of his\r\ngrandfather's last moments--it came easily to him now, and he revelled\r\nin the sensation he was making.\r\n\r\n\"Rouse yourself, Danny dear,\" his mother cried tearfully, \"speak to\r\nus, darlin' and don't let yourself go to sleep--I'm feart it's gone to\r\nhis heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"It couldn't, ma,\" said Pearl, \"it's only a sliver--it's not a\r\ntelephone pole--a dash of cold water in the face will bring him back.\"\r\n\r\nDanny suddenly returned to the earth, that his young soul seemed about\r\nto spurn, and the look he gave his sister was at once an appeal and a\r\nreproach.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you anything in your rainy-day box that's good for slivers?\"\r\nhe asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure there is,\" said Pearl, \"I think in a case of this kind, an\r\naccident that calls for medical treatment entitles its owner to a very\r\nsubstantial donation from the emergency chest. Mary, will you please\r\nmake a selection, while I go and phone, and remember, your youngest\r\nbrother is grievously wounded; do your best for him.\"\r\n\r\nPearl went to the phone, with a curiously lightened heart. At least\r\nshe would hear him speak--she would see him. Not once had she seen him\r\nsince the day she had been in his office. Not once--and that was three\r\nmonths ago. Three months, which seemed like three years!\r\n\r\n\"Give me twenty-one, please Central,\" she said steadily.\r\n\r\nShe knew the way he took off the receiver.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Clay, this is Pearl speaking,\" she hurried on, without giving him\r\ntime for reply. \"Danny has a sliver in his foot, and we want you to\r\ncome out. Can you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right away,\" he answered. \"I'll be there in twenty minutes. Is it\r\nvery bad, Pearl?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not very--I nearly got it out myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm glad you didn't,\"--his voice was eager.\r\n\r\n\"But he wanted you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for Danny--he was always a wise child.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the patient was made comfortable in a rocking-chair, with a\r\npackage of Japanese water \"Flowers\" and a cup of water in which to\r\nexpand them, as a means of keeping his mind from despair, Pearl made\r\na hurried survey of herself in the mirror, and pulled her brown hair\r\ninto curls over her ears.\r\n\r\n\"Ears are not good this year, Mary,\" she laughed. \"They must not be\r\nseen.\"\r\n\r\nA roar of pain from Danny brought her flying back to him.\r\n\r\n\"Stay with me Pearl,\" he shouted, \"I'm a sick man, and tell the kids\r\nto keep quiet--it jars me--I can't stand it--it makes me all go cold!\"\r\n\r\nPearl sat down beside him, making a rather unsuccessful effort to be\r\nbecomingly solemn. Mary hushed the shouts of the others, who\r\nwere quite ready to be thrilled by their brother's precarious\r\ncondition--and when the doctor came in, the Watson brothers assembled\r\nto hear the verdict.\r\n\r\n\"He will recover,\" said the doctor. \"Not only recover, but regain the\r\nfull use of the injured member. But it's a bad, bad sliver just the\r\nsame, and some boys would cry if they had it.\"\r\n\r\nDanny set his lips tightly together, as one who was determined to\r\nendure to the end.\r\n\r\nVery tenderly the doctor took him on his knee, and examined the little\r\nfoot. \"I'll have a basin of water, Pearl, please,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It has been washed,\" Danny cried, with indignation. \"Pearl washed\r\nboth of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough,\" the doctor said, \"but you just watch and see what I am\r\ngoing to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor opened his black bag to get out a lance, the sight of which\r\nwas too much for Danny's reserve of courage, and in spite of his brave\r\nefforts, the tears burst forth.\r\n\r\nThe doctor laid the lance back in the bag, and said, \"Now Danny, I am\r\ngoing to tell you a real true story, and we won't touch your foot at\r\nall, unless you ask me to.\r\n\r\n\"There's a bad, bold sliver about this long, that ran into Danny\r\nWatson's foot. No one asked the sliver to go in--no one wanted it--but\r\nit went. Danny's foot does not like it--and every nerve is crying\r\n'Pull it out--pull it out,' and the blood has gathered round to see\r\nwhat's wrong, just like a crowd of people on the street, growing\r\nbigger every minute, so Danny's foot is beginning to swell and get red\r\nand hot.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if we leave the sliver alone, the foot will get it out its own\r\nway, but it will take a long time. The foot will get redder, hotter,\r\nsorer. It will be very stiff, and Danny will not be able to walk on\r\nit. And even after the sliver works out, it will take quite a while\r\nto heal, and there may be an ugly mark here for a long time. Still,\r\nthat's one way to get rid of slivers.\r\n\r\n\"There's another way. It is to let me cut the skin with this sharp\r\nknife--sharp like a razor-blade--and then take these little tweezers,\r\ncatch the end of the sliver, and give one quick jerk. Then we'll\r\nput your foot in the warm water and let all the blood that has been\r\ngathering to see what was wrong, run away, and then we'll put on\r\nsomething nice and soft, and some absorbent cotton, and make a fine\r\nbandage, and about tomorrow it will be as good as the other one.\r\n\r\n\"Which way will we do it, Danny?\"\r\n\r\nDanny had followed every word of the story, his eyes meeting the\r\ndoctor's calmly.\r\n\r\n\"Which way, Danny?\" the doctor repeated.\r\n\r\nDanny buried his head in the doctor's shoulder, and said one word:\r\n\r\n\"Jerk!\"\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes it was all over, and Danny, looking a little pale,\r\nwith his foot resting on a pillow, was taken for a ride in the new\r\nwheelbarrow, well padded with fresh hay by his thoroughly concerned\r\nand solicitous young brothers. Danny, knowing the transitory nature of\r\nhis popularity, was not too overcome by his recent operation to accept\r\npromptly the presents his brothers offered, and did so with a sweetly\r\nwan and patient smile which kindled a noble rivalry in the matter of\r\ngifts. Patsey, now very repentant, brought his catapult, Bugsey his\r\nalleys, his loveliest \"pure,\" and the recumbent lamb set in a ball of\r\nclear glass; Tommy surrendered his pair of knobbies. Their mother,\r\nwatching the procession leaving the gate, was moved almost to tears by\r\nthese expressions of brotherly love.\r\n\r\n\"They fight and squabble and jander at each other, but when trouble\r\ncomes, they cling together. That's what the psalmist means when he\r\nsays 'A brother is born for adversity.' It's the day of trouble that\r\nproves what your own mean to you.\"\r\n\r\nMary and her mother were at the kitchen door, having come out to get\r\nthe patient properly started for his ride.\r\n\r\n\"I never knew it meant that, ma,\" said Mary, \"but that's a nice\r\nmeaning anyway.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked into the living-room, where Pearl and the doctor sat\r\nwithout speaking, and just as her mother was about to go to join them,\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n\"I believe there's cream for a churnin', ma, it will be too sour\r\nbefore Monday. If you come out and stay with me, I'll do it, but I\r\nhate to work alone.\"\r\n\r\nAs she flung the cream from end to end of the barrel-churn, while her\r\nmother sat beside her mending the boys' shirts for the Sabbath, Mary\r\nsaid to herself:\r\n\r\n\"A sister is born for adversity, too--you bet.\" Meanwhile, the doctor\r\nand Pearl, left alone, had broken the silence which fell upon them at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n\"Come out for a ride, Pearl,\" he said at last. \"Saturday is the\r\nteacher's happy day, and I haven't seen you for months--not to speak\r\nto you--and I want to hear all about what you've been doing. You\r\nhaven't told me yet that you are glad I was elected.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I wrote you a note, didn't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes indeed, you did,\" he agreed, \"but you know even the best notes\r\nin the world lack color--or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Even roses,\" said Pearl, \"lack something too, though it isn't color.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will come, won't you, Pearl?\" he urged.\r\n\r\nPearl sat on the flowered lounge, looking at him intently.\r\n\r\n\"Just wait a minute, doctor,\" she said, \"your explanation of slivers\r\nand their treatment interests me very much. I think I had better\r\nconsult you now as my physician. I have never had a physician, but it\r\nwould no doubt be you if I should need one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Miss Watson,\" he said, quite gravely, \"I appreciate the\r\ncompliment,\" and waited for her to speak.\r\n\r\n\"I have a sliver, too,\" she said at last. \"No, not in my foot. It is\r\nin my heart, and I am afraid I have been trying the foolish way of\r\nletting it work out. You are quite right in saying it is slow, and\r\npainful--and attracts attention to itself. It does. Now that day, the\r\nsecond day of March, you and I had some serious conversation. I didn't\r\nunderstand why you said what you did. I don't yet. I am sure you\r\nsaid what you thought you should say. You may have been telling the\r\ntruth--or if not, something you considered better than the truth,\r\neasier, more comfortable, less painful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes a very bitter thought comes to me--a sore thought--it is\r\nthe sliver. I am not trying to be tactful now, just truthful. Tact and\r\ntruth do not always combine naturally. This is one of the times. I am\r\ngoing to ask you something--but, don't speak until I am all done.\"\r\n\r\nHere Pearl straightened her fine young shoulders, and her eyes grew\r\nvery dark and luminous.\r\n\r\n\"Was it really because you think I am too young to know my own mind,\r\nthat you spoke as you did, or is there another reason?\"\r\n\r\nShe was looking into his eyes with such intensity, with such\r\ndirectness, that he knew he was going to tell her everything. It\r\nseemed as if she must read whatever was in his heart.\r\n\r\n\"My people are common, working people,\" she went on--and her head was\r\nheld very high now, and her voice, all silver as it was, had an inner\r\nfoundation of steel, like the famous silverware. \"My people have\r\nalways worked for a living. They are honest, kindly, honorable people,\r\nbut they are what the vulgar would call--and do call--people who have\r\nno 'class.' My father eats with his knife; my mother does not know\r\nanything about having her subject and predicate agree in certain fine\r\npoints in which subjects and predicates are supposed to agree. She\r\nknows how to work in harmony with her family and her neighbors, but\r\nher adjectives, verbs and nouns do sometimes tangle. I don't mind.\r\nThese are small matters to me. I love my own people--admire and honor\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nPearl's cheeks were flaming now.\r\n\r\n\"If you care greatly for these things--I know many do--and feel they\r\nare too serious, I want you to do something for me as my physician.\r\nYou can do it with one word. It will hurt, but not for long. It will\r\nheal quickly. I will wash out the place with pride, and put on a\r\nbandage of the love I bear my own people. It will just be the first\r\nshock--there will be no after effects. Tell me the one word. Was it\r\nbecause--my father eats with his knife? Danny buried his face in your\r\nshoulder so he could not see. I will use a pillow--it is--more seemly.\r\nAll right! Ready! Jerk!\"\r\n\r\nThe pillow was thrown across the room, and Pearl found herself looking\r\ninto his eyes, as he held her close.\r\n\r\n\"No, Pearl,\" he cried, \"it is not that. I love you--more than all the\r\nworld. I would marry you--if every relative you ever had had been\r\nhanged on the highest hill. There are no two people I know, to whom I\r\nwould rather be related, than your father and mother. But there is a\r\ngap between us. I did not tell you the truth that day, because I felt\r\nit was more honorable to hide it. But I will tell you everything now.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he was done, Pearl's eyes were soft and tender, and her arms\r\ntightened around him.\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" she said happily. \"Is that all?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand, dear, how serious it is,\" he said, \"I couldn't\r\nask you to marry a sick man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you love me?\" she said, \"You want me--you have been miserable\r\ntrying to give me up.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been a bitter fight,\" he said, \"a miserable, lonesome fight.\"\r\n\r\nPearl stood up suddenly, and he thought he had never seen her so\r\nbeautiful, so queenly or so compelling. He knew he was going to do\r\nwhatever she said. The weight of responsibility seemed to be lifted.\r\n\r\n\"Come out,\" she said quickly, \"we are too happy to stay inside. I must\r\nbreathe the sunshine and look up at the sky. My heart is too full for\r\na house.\"\r\n\r\nThey drove to the river bank, a mile away, and sat on a fallen log at\r\nthe head of a ravine, which fell sharply to the river below. Through\r\nthe opening in the trees, they would see the slow running Souris, on\r\nwhich the sunshine glinted, making its easy way to join its elder\r\nbrother, the Assiniboine, on the long, long march to the sea. Across\r\nthe river plumy willows, pale green and tremulous, grew paler still as\r\na wind passed over them.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon sun was sinking in a sea of wine-red mist, throwing\r\nstreamers of light into the upper sky, like a giant's fan.\r\n\r\n\"I know now,\" said Pearl, \"why I was led to Purple Springs, and why I\r\nfelt when I met Annie Gray that my life would be knit with hers;\"\r\nand then as they sat, hand-in-hand, with the glory of the sunset\r\ntransfiguring the every-day world, she told him of the wonder valley\r\nof hot springs in the far North, whose streams have magical powers of\r\nhealing. The valley of Purple Springs--away beyond the sunset.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go over tomorrow,\" said Pearl, \"and Annie will tell you all\r\nabout it, with its arch of mountains, its tropical flowers, the size\r\nof the vegetables and grains which grow there, and the delight of the\r\nIndians when they find their sick people growing well again. Annie has\r\nbeen longing to go, and I told her yesterday I would go with her, and\r\nwe can still get there before the cold weather.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor made one last effort to hold to his original intention:\r\n\r\n\"Pearl, I cannot let you bind yourself to me until I am well again.\r\nI am holding my own, Dr. Brander says. He thought the election would\r\npull me down, but it didn't. My case is a hopeful one. It's too much\r\nlike taking advantage of your romantic way of looking at this. To\r\nmarry a sick man is a serious affair, and I cannot ask a girl like\r\nyou, so full of promise, so splendid in every way, to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You won't need to,\" she laughed, slipping her arm through his. \"It's\r\nall settled--I'll just marry you without being asked. The covenant\r\nbetween you and me was made before the foundations of the world.\r\nYou're my man. I knew you the moment I saw you. So when I say, 'I,\r\nPearl, take you, Horace,' it's not a new contract--it's just a\r\nratification of the old. It's just the way we have of letting the\r\nworld know. You see dear, you just can't help it--it's settled.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure, Pearl; you are so young in years; I mean--are you\r\nsure you will not be sorry? I love you Pearl--I want you, but I desire\r\nstill more to see you get the most out of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure,\" she said steadily. \"If I can't have you, life has fooled\r\nme--cheated me--and I do not believe God ever intended that. Peter\r\nNeelands said I was in love with life, with romance; that because you\r\nwere the nearest hero I had selected you and hung a halo around you,\r\nand that maybe I was mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does he know about it?\" asked the doctor sharply.\r\n\r\n\"I told him,\" said Pearl. \"He was the only person I could talk to, and\r\nwhen there came not a word from you--and Mrs. Crocks told me you went\r\nquite often to the city to see Miss Keith, I began to wonder if I\r\ncould be mistaken--so I tried to forget you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I worked two weeks on it, when I was in the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you go about it?\" he asked, after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"Peter said most girls were so romantic and ready to fall in love,\r\nthey often loved a man who cared nothing for them, but who married\r\nthem rather than break their hearts, and that's what causes so many\r\nunhappy homes. Of course, it works the other way too, and he said\r\nthe way to tell if it were a real true, undying love, was to try the\r\n'expulsive power of a new love.' That's a fine phrase, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Peter was willing to be experimented on. He said if he had come\r\nto Millford about the same time you did, I might have selected him\r\ninstead of you, and made a hero of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has his nerve,\" exclaimed the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"O, I don't know,\" she said. \"I mean I didn't know. I was willing to\r\nsee. So Peter stuck around all the time, and he drove me everywhere,\r\nand always saw me home. I like him--all right--but you see I couldn't\r\nmake my heart beat when he came into the room, and there was no\r\nrainbow in the sky, or music in the air, when he came to see me, and\r\nevery day I got more lonesome for you, until it just seemed as if I\r\ncouldn't go on. The three years when I thought you loved me, I saved\r\nup a lot of happiness--sort of money in the bank--and I used it every\r\nday and told myself you would tell me everything some day--and it\r\nwould all come right. I got that mixed in with my prayers every night.\r\nBut when you didn't come--and didn't come--my balance in the bank grew\r\nless and less--and I got panicky, and afraid I had been mistaken. So\r\njust to be sure, I did try to like Peter--not because I wanted to,\r\nbut just to see if it could be done--in the interest of scientific\r\nresearch, Peter said it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I couldn't get accustomed to having him with me--he tired me\r\nsometimes--he talked too much, and I never could let him pay for my\r\nlunch, when we had lunch together. I could not let him spend a cent on\r\nme--not even the price of a movie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you didn't, Pearl,\" the doctor said quickly. \"You were quite\r\nright about that, but you won't feel that way about me, will you dear?\r\nThese new women can get to be so independent--they are uncomfortable\r\nto live with.\"\r\n\r\nPearl rubbed her cheek against his shoulder, like a well-pleased\r\nkitten.\r\n\r\n\"No chance!\" she said. \"I'll let you pay every time--I'll just love\r\nspending your money--I won't ever know it from mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"O won't you?\" laughed the doctor. \"Well now, I am glad to be warned,\r\nand I am glad there are some laws to protect poor simple-minded men\r\nlike me. I'll speak to Driggs about it as soon as I go back, and you\r\nmay expect to see on the front page of the 'Mercury' something like\r\nthis: 'I, Horace Clay, physician of the village of Millford, hereby\r\nwarn the public I will not be responsible for my wife's debts.'\"\r\n\r\nAt that, they laughed so much that the woodpecker in the tree above\r\nthem stopped drumming, to listen, and when he found out how matters\r\nstood, he turned the whole story into telegraphic code and sent it up\r\nand down the valley; and a brown squirrel looked at them through\r\na tangle of cranberry leaves, and when he got the drift of\r\ntheir conversation, he raced to the top of the highest tree and\r\nchee--chee--chee-d the news to all the other squirrels in the woods;\r\nand old silver-spot, the crow, scenting a piece of gossip, came\r\ncircling over the trees and made a landing on a stump quite near them,\r\nand with his head on one side, listened for a few minutes, and then,\r\nwith an insufferable smirk, rose cautiously and, circling high over\r\nthe trees, made a rapid flight up the river, without uttering a sound.\r\n\r\nThe doctor watched him as he disappeared around the bend. \"Do you know\r\nwhere he's off to, Pearl?\" he said. \"He's going to tell Mrs. Crocks.\r\nShe understands Crow, of course--it's left over from her last\r\nre-incarnation. This will save an announcement!\"\r\n\r\nAll afternoon, a black cloud, thick and thunderous, had huddled over\r\nthe hills to the north, but before the sun went down, there came\r\nacross its shoulder, a shining ribbon of rainbow.",
