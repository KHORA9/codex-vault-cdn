His vision was set out in \"The Anglo-German\r\nProblem,\" written in 1912, now published in an authorized American\r\nedition, perhaps the most accurate forecast which has been penned of\r\nto-day's conflict, and certainly one of the most exact analyses of the\r\nGerman nation made before the world learned, since last August, to\r\nknow it as it is--as Sarolea, master delineator of a nation's\r\ncharacter, drew it. Clear, sane, calm, logical, strong--such is Dr.\r\nSarolea's book, with its \"rare perspicacity\" and \"remarkable sense of\r\npolitical realities,\" in the words of King Albert's appreciation of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nDr. Sarolea, looking at Germany from the British Isles, where he was\r\nwriting, perceived that \"war is actually unavoidable\" unless a\r\nspiritual miracle was wrought; that Europe was \"drifting slowly but\r\nsteadily toward an awful catastrophe.\" Why? Because Germany was\r\nstrong, envious, ambitious, conceited, arrogant, unscrupulous, and\r\ndissatisfied. It was in Germany that \"the pagan gods of the Nibelungen\r\nare forging their deadly weapons,\" for Germans believe national\r\nsuperiority is due to military superiority. Dr. Sarolea named as a war\r\nyear this very year[2] in which we now are when he said:\r\n\r\n    [2] 1915.\r\n\r\n\"Believing, as they do, that to-day they are rich and prosperous\r\nmainly because in 1870 they beat the French people, why should they\r\nnot believe and trust that in 1915 they would become even stronger and\r\nricher if they succeeded in beating the English?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the conflict, when it comes, will be \"a political and religious\r\ncrusade,\" rather than a mere economic war, for the conflict between\r\nEngland and Germany \"is the old conflict between liberalism and\r\ndespotism, between industrialism and militarism, between progress and\r\nreaction, between the masses and the classes.\"\r\n\r\nSo many other important points are made in Dr. Sarolea's closely\r\nwritten book, in which practically every sentence contains a fact, an\r\nidea, or a prophecy, that it is not possible in this review to do more\r\nthan present a few of them in the summary which follows. Though the\r\npresent tense is used by Dr. Sarolea and the reviewer, it should be\r\nconstantly remembered that Dr. Sarolea was thinking in 1912, not since\r\nAugust, 1914.\r\n\r\nGermany is in \"tragic moral isolation.\" The moral and intellectual\r\ninfluence of German culture is steadily diminishing. Other nations\r\nfeel a universal distrust and dislike toward Germany. So great is\r\nthis antipathy that the Germans imagine there is a malignant\r\nconspiracy against them. An upstart nation, suddenly wealthy and\r\npowerful, Germany has developed an inordinate self-conceit and\r\nself-assertion. The German glories in being a realist. He thinks only\r\nof political power and colonial expansion. Might is the supreme test\r\nof right. He constantly emphasizes the indelible character of the\r\nGerman race. Germans are suffering from \"acute megalomania.\" They\r\nthink the English decadent, the French doomed to premature extinction,\r\nthe Russians \"rotten.\" Germany is the \"reactionary force in\r\ninternational politics.\"\r\n\r\nEngland believes the building of the German Navy is mainly directed\r\nagainst her, though Germany says she is building to protect her\r\ncolonies and commerce. Yet it is not reasonably possible so to account\r\nfor the German fleet.\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger to England is not invasion of the British Isles,\r\nbut invasion of Belgium and France. These countries are the \"Achilles\r\nheel of the British Empire.\" The German strategic railways on the\r\nBelgian frontiers show that Germany is far more likely to invade\r\nBelgium than England, Belgium again becoming the cockpit of Europe.\r\n\r\nGermany feels that she has grievances against England; thus her\r\nhatred. She thinks England has checked her commercial expansion. But\r\nthis is not true, for English Free Trade has been one of the most\r\nimportant contributory causes of German prosperity.\r\n\r\nGermany thinks England has arrested her colonial expansion; Germany\r\nsays every other great nation but herself has been permitted to build\r\nup a colonial empire; thus she is prevented from attaining her natural\r\ngrowth. But this is not true. England could not have checked her\r\ncolonial aspirations, because Germany had no colonial aspirations\r\nuntil recently. When Germany did start to seek colonies, she met\r\neverywhere conflicting claims of England, but this was because England\r\nwas already in possession, having begun her colonial policy years\r\nbefore Germany entered the race. Bismarck was largely responsible for\r\nGermany's now having so small a colonial territory.\r\n\r\nGermany thinks she has another grievance--that England has hemmed her\r\nin with a ring of enemies. But Germany is friendless because of her\r\nmistakes. Bismarck alienated the Russians for ever in 1878 at the\r\nTreaty of Berlin, making a Franco-Russian understanding unavoidable.\r\nThe Kruger telegram of 1896, the outburst of anti-British feeling\r\nduring the Boer War, the German naval programme, opened England's eyes\r\nto her danger; thus was England forced to seek France and Russia.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser is intensely religious, claiming to be \"the anointed of the\r\nLord.\" Yet he is a materialist, an opportunist, and mainly trusts to\r\nbrute force. The navy is his creation. He brandishes the sword, saying\r\nhe loves peace. Napoleon III. used to express his love for peace, yet\r\nbrought on the most disastrous war of French history; Nicholas II.\r\nstarted as the peacemaker of Europe, yet brought about the bloodiest\r\nwar in Russian history. \"Are the Kaiser's pacific protests as futile,\r\nare his sympathies as shallow, as those of a Napoleon or a Nicholas?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Sarolea closes his book thus:\r\n\r\n\"We can only hope that England, which to-day more than any other\r\ncountry--more, even, than republican France--represents the ideals of\r\na pacific and industrial democracy, may never be called upon to assert\r\nher supremacy in armed conflict, and to safeguard those ideals against\r\na wanton attack on the part of the most formidable and most systematic\r\nmilitary power the world has ever seen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nAN AMERICAN PREFACE[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] Preface written for the American Edition of the\r\n    \"Anglo-German Problem,\" published by Putnam.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe book of which a new and popular edition is now presented to the\r\nAmerican public has very little in common with the thousand and one\r\nwar publications which are distracting the attention of a bewildered\r\nand satiated reader. It was not compiled in feverish haste since the\r\nwar began. It was written years before the war, and represents the\r\noutcome of two decades of study and travel in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe volume was first published in 1912 to dispel the false sense of\r\nsecurity which was blinding European opinion to the imminent perils\r\nahead, to warn Britain of the appalling catastrophe towards which all\r\nnations were drifting, and to give an accurate estimate of the forces\r\nwhich were making for war. I attempted to prove that Germany and not\r\nBritain or France or Russia was the storm-centre of international\r\npolitics. I attempted to prove that the differences between Germany\r\nand Britain were not due to substantial grievances, but that those\r\ngrievances were purely imaginary; that such catch-phrases as taking\r\nGermany's place in the sun were entirely misleading, and that both\r\nthe grievances and the catch-phrases were merely diverting the public\r\nmind from the one real issue at stake, the clash and conflict between\r\ntwo irreconcilable political creeds--the Imperialism of Great Britain,\r\ngranting equal rights to all, based on Free Trade, and aiming at a\r\nfederation of self-governing communities; and the Imperialism of\r\nGermany, based on despotism and antagonism and aiming at the military\r\nascendancy of one Power over subject races.\r\n\r\nI further attempted to show how the German people were in the grip of\r\nthe Prussian military machine, of a reactionary bureaucracy, and of a\r\nPrussian feudal Junkerthum; how behind that military machine and that\r\nfeudal Junkerthum there were even more formidable moral and spiritual\r\nforces at work; how the whole German nation were under the spell of a\r\nfalse political creed; how the Universities, the Churches, the Press,\r\nwere all possessed with the same exclusive nationalism; and how, being\r\nmisled by its spiritual leaders, the whole nation was honestly and\r\nintensely convinced that in the near future the German Empire must\r\nchallenge the world in order to establish its supremacy over the\r\nContinent of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Habent sua fata libelli!_ Motley's \"Rise of the Dutch Republic\" was\r\nrefused by the illustrious house of Murray. The now historical\r\n\"Foundations\" of Chamberlain were rejected for twenty years by English\r\npublishers, until the translation brought a little fortune to Mr. John\r\nLane. Without in the least suggesting a comparison with those famous\r\nworks, I only want to point out that the \"Anglo-German Problem\" has\r\npassed through as strange literary vicissitudes. A book written by a\r\nsympathetic and devoted student of German literature, and who for\r\ntwenty years had been working for the diffusion of German culture, was\r\ndenounced as anti-German. A book inspired from the first page to the\r\nlast with pacific and democratic ideals was denounced as a militarist\r\nand mischievous production. A temperate judicial analysis was dubbed\r\nas alarmist and sensational and bracketed with the scaremongerings of\r\nthe Yellow Press. The radical _Daily News_ of London dismissed my\r\nvolume with a contemptuous notice. The Edinburgh reviewer of the\r\n_Scotsman_ pompously declared that such a book could do no good.\r\n\r\nTo-day both the Press and the public have made ample if belated amends\r\nfor the unjust treatment meted out to the \"Anglo-German Problem\" on\r\nits first appearance. His Majesty King Albert has emphasized the\r\nprophetic character of the book, and has paid it the high compliment\r\nof recommending it to members of his Government. University statesmen\r\nlike President Butler, eminent lawyers like Mr. James Beck,\r\nillustrious philosophers like Professor Bergson, have testified to its\r\nfairness, its moderation, and its political insight. Almost unnoticed\r\non its publication in 1912, the \"Anglo-German Problem\" is to-day one\r\nof the three books on the war most widely read throughout the British\r\nEmpire, and is being translated into the French, Dutch, and Spanish\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nNot only have the principles and general conclusions propounded in the\r\n\"Anglo-German Problem\" received signal confirmation from recent\r\nevents, but the forecasts and anticipations have been verified in\r\nevery detail. It is the common fate of war books to become very\r\nquickly out of date. After four years, there is not one paragraph\r\nwhich has been contradicted by actual fact. Even the chapter on the\r\nBaghdad Railway, written in 1906 and published as a separate pamphlet\r\nnine years ago, remains substantially correct. One of the leading\r\nmagnates of Wall Street wrote to me: \"Events have not only unfolded\r\nthemselves in the way you anticipated, but they have happened for the\r\nidentical reasons which you indicated.\" I pointed out the fatal peril\r\nof the Austrian-Serbian differences and of the _Drang nach Osten_\r\npolicy, and it is those Serbian-Austrian differences which have\r\nprecipitated the war. I prophesied that the invasion of Belgium and\r\nnot the invasion of England was the contingency to be dreaded, and\r\nBelgium has become the main theatre of military operations. I\r\nemphasized that the conflict was one of fundamental moral and\r\npolitical ideals rather than of economic interests, and the war has\r\ndeveloped into a religious crusade. I prophesied that the war would be\r\nlong and cruel, and it has proved the most ruthless war of modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAll the forces which I prophesied would make for war have made for\r\nwar: the reactionary policy of the Junkerthum, the internal troubles,\r\nthe personality of the Kaiser, the propaganda of the Press and of the\r\nUniversities. Similarly, the forces which were expected to make for\r\npeace, and which I prophesied would _not_ make for peace, have failed\r\nto work for peace. Few publicists anticipated that the millions of\r\nGerman Social Democrats would behave as timid henchmen of the Prussian\r\nJunker, and my friend Vandervelde, leader of the International Social\r\nDemocracy and now Belgian Minister of State, indignantly repudiated my\r\nreflections on his German comrades. Alas! the Gospel according to St.\r\nMarx has been as ineffectual as the Gospel according to St. Marc. The\r\nSocial Democracy which called itself the International (with a capital\r\nI) has proved selfishly nationalist, and the masses which had not the\r\ncourage to fight for their rights under Kaiser Bebel are now\r\nslaughtering their French and English brethren, and are meekly\r\nenlisted in the legions of Kaiser William.\r\n\r\nThe \"Anglo-German Problem,\" written by a writer of Belgian origin who\r\nforesaw the catastrophe threatening his native country, will be\r\nfollowed up shortly by another book on the \"Reconstruction of\r\nBelgium.\" Belgium has been not only the champion of European freedom;\r\nshe has also been the innocent victim of the old order. It is only in\r\nthe fitness of things that after the war Belgium shall become the\r\nkeystone of the new International Order. The whole of Europe is\r\nultimately responsible for the Belgian tragedy. The whole of Europe\r\nmust therefore be interested in and pledged to the restoration of\r\nBelgium and to the liberation of the Belgian people, now crushed and\r\nbleeding under the heel of the Teutonic invader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMY FORECASTS OF 1906 AND 1912[4]\r\n\r\n    [4] This chapter is entirely made up of extracts taken from\r\n    my pamphlet, \"The Baghdad Railway,\" _published in_ 1906, and\r\n    from my book, \"The Anglo-German Problem,\" published in 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--WE ARE DRIFTING INTO WAR.\r\n\r\n\"Europe is drifting slowly but steadily towards an awful catastrophe,\r\nwhich, if it does happen, will throw back civilization for the coming\r\ngeneration, as the war of 1870 threw back civilization for the\r\ngeneration which followed and which inherited its dire legacy of evil.\r\nFor the last ten years two great Western Powers and two kindred races\r\nhave become increasingly estranged, and have been engaging in military\r\npreparations which are taxing to the utmost the resources of the\r\npeople, and are paralyzing social and political reform in both\r\ncountries. A combination of many causes, moral and political, has bred\r\nsuspicion and distrust, and the fallacious assumption of conflicting\r\ninterests has turned suspicion into hatred. Only a year ago England\r\nand Germany stood on the brink of war. If, after the _coup_ of Agadir,\r\nGermany had persisted in her policy, the conflagration would have\r\nensued, the storm would have burst out. The war-cloud has temporarily\r\nlifted, but it has not passed away. The danger is as acute as it\r\nwas, because the causes which produced the recent outburst are still\r\nwith us, and the malignant passions are gathering strength with each\r\npassing day.\r\n\r\nThis formidable evil is threatening England, but it does not originate\r\nin England, and England cannot be held responsible for it. The period\r\nof aggressive Imperialism has passed away. Mr. Joseph Chamberlain and\r\nMr. Rudyard Kipling, in so far as they once represented the old\r\nbellicose Imperialism, to-day are exploded forces. The English people\r\nwere never more peacefully inclined, and Liberals and Tories are\r\nunited in their desire for a pacific solution of the present\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nIt is Germany and not England which is the storm-centre, the volcanic\r\nzone, in international politics. From there have come, ever since\r\n1860, the tension and friction, the suspicion and distrust. It is\r\nthere that the pagan gods of the Nibelungen are forging their deadly\r\nweapons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THE STRENGTH OF ANTI-BRITISH FEELING IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\"German and English publicists, whilst admitting the existence of a\r\nfeeling of hostility, point out the many unmistakable signs of\r\ngoodwill heralding a better understanding in the future. They point to\r\nthe frequent exchange of international courtesies, to the periodical\r\nvisits of Members of Parliament and of representative men of the\r\nChurches; they point to the visit of Viscount Haldane; and last, but\r\nnot least, they point to the many pacific assurances of the German\r\nKaiser. With regard to the utterances of the Kaiser, I can only say\r\nthat if the Kaiser has made many pacific speeches, his aggressive\r\nspeeches have been even more numerous. I have no doubt that the Kaiser\r\nis perfectly sincere, and I believe him to be animated with the most\r\ncordial feelings for this country. If I am asked to explain the\r\ncontradiction, I can only see one explanation, and it is not one which\r\nI am very willing to admit. And the explanation is this: when he is\r\nexpressing words of peace and goodwill he is speaking in his own\r\nprivate capacity and as the grandson of an English queen. On the\r\ncontrary, whenever he utters words of ill-will and menace, whenever he\r\nwaves the flag, when he shows the mailed fist, he is acting as the\r\nrepresentative and speaking as the spokesman of a considerable\r\nfraction amongst his subjects.\r\n\r\nThat there has existed in Germany a very widespread feeling of\r\nhostility against the English people we have uncontrovertible proof.\r\nAnd the evidence we have on no less an authority than the Kaiser\r\nhimself. In the famous interview published by the _Daily Telegraph_,\r\nWilliam II. emphatically testified to the existence and to the\r\npersistence of the feeling which he had systematically attempted to\r\ncounteract. The admission raised legitimate indignation in Germany. It\r\nwas ill-advised. It was calculated to intensify the very animosity\r\nwhich it deprecated. But the fact itself, the existence of the\r\nanimosity, could not be disputed. After all, the Kaiser ought to know\r\nthe feelings, if not of the majority of his subjects, at least of\r\nthose ruling classes with whom he comes in contact.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--WAR THE GERMAN IDEAL AND THE GERMAN IDOL.\r\n\r\n\"Contemporary German philosophy is a 'war philosophy.' In France we\r\nmay find isolated thinkers, like Joseph de Maistre, who are the\r\napostles of war, who maintain that war is a Divine and providential\r\ninstitution, one of the eternal verities. In Germany the paradoxes of\r\nde Maistre are the commonplaces of historians and moralists. To an\r\nEnglishman war is a dwindling force, an anachronism. It may still\r\nsometimes be a necessity, a _dura lex_, an _ultima ratio_, but it is\r\nalways a monstrous calamity. In other words, to an Englishman war is\r\nevil, war is _immoral_. On the contrary, to the German war is\r\nessentially moral. Indeed, it is the source of the highest morality,\r\nof the most valuable virtues, and without war the human race would\r\nspeedily degenerate. It is the mainspring of national progress. There\r\nare three causes which have ensured the present greatness of the\r\nGerman Empire: moral virtue in the individual, political unity, and\r\neconomic prosperity. If we were to believe modern theorists, Germany\r\nowes all three to the beneficent action of war. Germany is not\r\nindebted for its culture to the genius of its writers or artists, but\r\nto the iron and blood of its statesmen and warriors. It is the\r\nglorious triumvirate of Bismarck, Moltke, and von Roon who have been\r\nthe master-builders of the Vaterland.\r\n\r\nOur main contention is, that as the pacific philosophy of Herder and\r\nKant, of Goethe and Lessing, provides the key to the old Germany\r\ndescribed in Madame de Staël's masterpiece, even so the military\r\nphilosophy of Mommsen and Treitschke, of Bismarck and Nietzsche, gives\r\nus the key of modern Prussianized Germany. The whole German people\r\nhave become Bismarckian, and believe that it is might which creates\r\nright. The whole of the younger generation have become Nietzschean in\r\npolitics, and believe in the will to power--_der Wille zur Macht_.\r\nThat political philosophy is to-day the living and inspiring ideal\r\nwhich informs German policy. And it is that philosophy which we have\r\nto keep constantly in mind if we wish to understand the currents and\r\nunder-currents of contemporary politics and make a correct forecast of\r\nthe future; if we wish to distinguish between what is real and unreal\r\nin international relations, between the professions of politicians and\r\nthe aims and aspirations of the people. German statesmen may protest\r\nabout their love of peace, but the service they render to peace is\r\nonly lip service. Peace is only a means, war is the goal. We are\r\nreminded of Professor Delbrück's assertion that, considering the\r\ninfinitely complex conditions of modern warfare, many years of peace\r\nare necessary to and must be utilized for the preparation of the wars\r\nwhich are to come.\r\n\r\nHow, then, can we be reassured by any German pacifist protests and\r\ndemonstrations? How can we believe that German peace is anything more\r\nthan a precarious truce as long as German statesmen, German thinkers,\r\nGerman teachers and preachers, unanimously tell us that the philosophy\r\nof war is the only gospel of salvation? How can a patriotic German, if\r\nhe is consistent, abstain eventually from waging war when he is\r\nfirmly convinced that his country owes her political unity, her moral\r\ntemper, and her Imperial prosperity, whatever she is and whatever she\r\nhas, mainly to the agency of war? When war has done so much for\r\nGermany in the past, will it not do greater things for Germany in the\r\nfuture?\r\n\r\nWar may be a curse or it may be a blessing. If war is a curse, then\r\nthe wells of public opinion have been poisoned in Germany, perhaps for\r\ngenerations to come. If war is a blessing, if the philosophy of war is\r\nindeed the gospel of the super-man, sooner or later the German people\r\nare bound to put that gospel into practice. They must look forward\r\nwith anxious and eager desire to the glorious day when once more they\r\nare able to fight the heroic battles of Teutonism, when they are able\r\nto fulfil the providential destinies of the German super-race, the\r\nchosen champions of civilization.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--WHY GERMANY HAS KEPT THE PEACE.\r\n\r\n\"Uninfluenced by those ominous signs of the times, English and German\r\noptimists still refuse to surrender, still persist in their optimism.\r\nThey argue that the situation is no doubt serious, but that those\r\noutbursts of popular feeling in Germany, violent as they are, have\r\nlargely been caused by English suspicion and distrust, and that there\r\nhas been nothing in the German policy to justify that English\r\nsuspicion and distrust. After all, deeds are more important than\r\nwords, and by her deeds Germany has proved for forty-two years that\r\nshe is persistently pacific. Since 1870 Russia has made war against\r\nTurkey and against Japan. England has made war against the Transvaal.\r\nItaly has waged war against Turkey. France after Fashoda would have\r\ndeclared war against England, and after Tangier would have declared\r\nwar against Germany, if France had been prepared. Of all the Great\r\nPowers, Germany alone for nearly half a century has been determined to\r\nkeep the peace of the world.\r\n\r\nThe reply to this objection is very simple. I am not examining here\r\nwhether a state of affairs which has transformed Europe into an armed\r\ncamp of six million soldiers, and which absorbs for military\r\nexpenditure two-thirds of the revenue of European States, can be\r\nappropriately called a state of peace. It is certainly not a _pax\r\nromana_. It is most certainly not a _pax britannica_. It may be a _pax\r\nteutonica_ or, rather, a _pax borussica_, but such as it is, ruinous\r\nand demoralizing, it is also lamentably precarious and perilously\r\nunstable. And if Germany has kept this _pax borussica_ for forty-two\r\nyears, it has not been the fault of the German Government. Rather has\r\nit been kept because she has been prevented from declaring war by\r\noutside interference; or because she has been able to carry out her\r\npolicy and to achieve her ambitions without going the length of\r\ndeclaring war; or because a war would have been not only a heinous\r\ncrime, but a political blunder.\r\n\r\nBut the real reason why Germany for forty years has kept the peace is\r\nbecause a war would have been both fatal and futile, injurious and\r\nsuperfluous. It would have been injurious, for it would have arrested\r\nthe growing trade and the expanding industries of the empire. And,\r\nabove all, it would have been superfluous, for in time of peace\r\nGermany reaped all the advantages which a successful war would have\r\ngiven her. For twenty-five years the German Empire wielded an\r\nunchallenged supremacy on the Continent of Europe. For twenty years\r\nshe directed the course of international events.\r\n\r\nBut since the opening of the twentieth century Germany has ceased to\r\nbe paramount; she has ceased to control European policy at her own\r\nsweet will, and weaker States have ceased to be given over to her\r\ntender mercies. To the Triple Alliance has been opposed the Triple\r\nEntente. The balance of power has been re-established. The three\r\n'hereditary enemies'--England, France, and Russia--have joined hands,\r\nand have delivered Europe from the incubus of German suzerainty.\r\nGerman diplomacy has strained every effort to break the Triple\r\nEntente, in turn wooing and threatening France and Russia, keeping\r\nopen the Moroccan sore as the Neapolitan _lazzarone_ keeps open the\r\nwound which ensures his living, and finally challenging the naval\r\nsupremacy of England, and preparing to become as powerful at sea as\r\nshe is on the Continent.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--THE POLITICAL PREPARATION OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely because the final issue will largely depend on the\r\npersonality of the soldier, the moral and civic preparation must be at\r\nleast as important as the technical, and here the Government has an\r\nimportant part to play through the school and through the Press. _Both\r\nthe school and the Press must both persistently emphasize the meaning\r\nand the necessity of war as an indispensable means of policy and of\r\nculture_, and must inculcate the duty of personal sacrifice. To\r\nachieve that end the Government must have its own popular papers,\r\nwhose aim it will be to stimulate patriotism, to preach loyalty to the\r\nKaiser, to resist the disintegrating influence of Social Democracy.\r\n\r\nBut not least important is the political preparation for the war.\r\nStatesmanship and diplomacy confine themselves too much to\r\nconsolidating alliances and entering into new understandings. Nothing\r\ncould be more dangerous than to rely too much on treaties and\r\nalliances. Alliances are not final. _Agreements are only conditional._\r\nThey are only binding, _rebus sic stantibus_, as long as conditions\r\nremain the same--_as long as it is in the interest of the allies to\r\nkeep them_; for nothing can compel a State to act against its own\r\ninterest, and there is no alliance or bond in the world which can\r\nsubsist if it is not based on the mutual advantage of both parties. It\r\nis therefore essential that the war shall be fought under such\r\nconditions that it shall be in the interest of every ally to be loyal\r\nto his engagements; and therefore it is essential for the State so to\r\ndirect and combine political events as to produce a conjuncture of\r\ninterests and to provoke the war at the most favourable moment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--THE IMAGINARY GERMAN GRIEVANCES.\r\n\r\n\"England cannot honestly admit the truth and reality of German\r\ngrievances. England cannot admit that in the past she has ever adopted\r\nan attitude of contemptuous superiority towards the German people.\r\nStill less can England admit that she has systematically stood in the\r\nway of German colonial ambitions. _She cannot admit it, for the simple\r\nreason that only a few years ago those German colonial ambitions did\r\nnot exist._ Almost to the end of his long rule, Bismarck would not\r\nhave colonies, and he deliberately encouraged France in that policy of\r\nAfrican expansion which Germany now objects to. Germany would probably\r\nhave had a much larger colonial empire if she had chosen to have it.\r\nHistory teaches us that in the development of European colonization\r\nthere are some nations, like the Spaniards and Portuguese, that have\r\ncome too early in the field. There are other nations, like England and\r\nRussia, that have come in the nick of time. And, finally, there are\r\nnations that have come too late. The German people have arrived too\r\nlate in the race for colonial empire. They may regret it, but surely\r\nit would be monstrous to use the fact as a grievance against the\r\npeople of this country. I may bitterly regret that twenty years ago I\r\nhad not the money or the energy or the foresight to invest in the\r\ndevelopment of Argentine, or that I did not buy an estate in Canada,\r\nwhich in those early days I might have got for a hundred pounds, and\r\nwhich to-day would be worth hundreds of thousands. But that is no\r\nreason why I should hate the present possessors of landed property in\r\nthe Far West or in the Far South. That is no reason why I should wish\r\nto dispossess them of land which they have legitimately acquired,\r\nwhether they owe it to their luck or to their pluck, to favourable\r\ncircumstances or to their initiative and perseverance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--THE PACIFIC MEANING OF THE ENTENTE.\r\n\r\n\"The new grouping of Powers, which has reduced Germany from a position\r\nof sole supremacy to a position of equality, is not the result of any\r\nartificial combinations of diplomacy. Still less is it the result of a\r\nconspiracy, inspired by English envy and English hatred. It was not\r\ninitiated by Edward VII. It has survived his death. To assume that\r\nEngland would have been capable of isolating Germany by her own single\r\nefforts, and in order to serve her own selfish purposes, is to\r\nattribute to England a power which she does not wield. If there has\r\nbeen a conspiracy, France, Italy, Russia, and the United States,\r\ninhabited by twenty million citizens who are German by birth or by\r\ndescent, have all been willing accomplices. The Triple Entente has\r\nbeen a spontaneous revolt of Europe against German aggressiveness and\r\nGerman militarism.\r\n\r\nEngland has not attempted to isolate Germany. She has only herself\r\nemerged from her isolation. If she can be accused of having made a\r\ngrievous mistake in her foreign policy, it is that of having been\r\nblind for so long to the perils which threatened European liberty.\r\nSince 1870 she has submitted for twenty-five years to German\r\npredominance, because she had to oppose the colonial ambitions of\r\nFrance in Africa and the ambitions of Russia in Asia. To-day England\r\nhas returned to her ancient traditions. She has never suffered for any\r\nlength of time, and will never suffer as long as she remains a\r\nfirst-class Power, from the exclusive predominance of any one\r\nContinental nation. She has ever fought for the maintenance of the\r\nbalance of power. She defended that balance against Charles V. and\r\nPhilip II. in the sixteenth century, against Louis XIV. in the\r\nseventeenth, against Napoleon, against Nicholas I., and Alexander II.\r\nin the nineteenth century. She defends it to-day against William II.\r\nBut she is no more the enemy of Germany to-day than she was the enemy\r\nof France or Russia ten years ago. _And if the equilibrium of Europe\r\nwere threatened to-morrow by Russia, as it is threatened to-day by\r\nGermany, England would become to-morrow the ally of Germany._\r\n\r\nIt may be contended, no doubt, that in opposing the supremacy of\r\nanother empire on land, she is only defending her own supremacy on the\r\nsea. But the history of four hundred years convincingly shows that\r\nEngland in defending her own interests has always been fighting the\r\nbattles of European liberty. And to-day more than ever, when Europe is\r\ntransformed into an armed camp, when might has become the criterion of\r\nright, when all nations are living in perpetual dread of a European\r\nconflagration, the strict adherence of England to her old principle of\r\nthe balance of power remains the best sanction of international law\r\nand the surest guarantee of the peace of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--GERMAN MEGALOMANIA.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever may be the cause of the state of mind of the Germans, they\r\nare certainly suffering just now from acute 'megalomania.' The\r\nabnormal self-conceit, the inflated national consciousness, express\r\nthemselves in a thousand ways, some of which are naïve and harmless,\r\nwhilst others are grossly offensive. They show themselves in a craving\r\nfor titles and in gaudy and tasteless public buildings;[5] in the\r\nthousand and one statues of Bismarck and William I.; they reveal\r\nthemselves in the articles of journalists and in the writings of\r\nhistorians; but above all, the German megalomania finds expression in\r\nthe seven thousand speeches and in the three hundred uniforms of the\r\nKaiser. In examining the influence of William II. we shall come to the\r\nconclusion that it is his defects far more than his virtues that have\r\nmade him the representative hero of the German people. His winged\r\nwords voice the aspirations of his subjects. Like the Kaiser, every\r\nGerman believes that he is 'the salt of the earth'--_Wir sind das Salz\r\nder Erde_. Like Nietzsche, the modern German believes that the world\r\nmust be ruled by a super-man, and that he is the super-man. Like\r\nHouston Stewart Chamberlain, the German is convinced that he belongs\r\nto a super-race, and that the Teuton has been the master-builder of\r\nEuropean civilization.\"\r\n\r\n    [5] See an amusing article, \"Ornamente,\" in the _Zukunft_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--GERMAN SELF-ASSERTION.\r\n\r\n\"The self-assertion of the Germans and the contempt for the foreigner\r\nreveal themselves in their political dealings with other nations.\r\nGerman statesmen continue the methods of Bismarck without having his\r\ngenius. German politicians delight in shaking the mailed fist, in\r\nwaving the national banner with the Imperial black eagle, the ominous\r\nand symbolical bird of prey. Wherever they meet with opposition they\r\nat once resort to comminatory messages. Compare the methods of the\r\nEmperor William with those of Edward VII. Nothing illustrates better\r\nthe differences between the characteristics of English and German\r\ndiplomacy than the dramatic contrast between the bragging, indiscreet,\r\nimpulsive, explosive manner of the Kaiser and the quiet, courteous\r\nmanner of the English monarch. Nothing explains better the striking\r\nsuccess which has attended English policy and the no less striking\r\nfailure which has attended German policy. For in international as well\r\nas in private relations, intellectual superiority is often as\r\nefficient a weapon as an appeal to brute force. And all the might of\r\nthe German Empire has not saved the German foreign policy from\r\npersistent bankruptcy. That bankruptcy is unanimously admitted even in\r\nGermany, and partly accounts for the present temper of the nation. The\r\ntimes have changed, and even the weak cannot now be bullied into\r\nsubmission. At the Algeciras Conference even those small nations whose\r\nmost obvious interest it was to side with Germany gave their moral\r\nsupport to France.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--GERMANY STANDS FOR REACTION.\r\n\r\n\"There still remains for us to examine one deeper reason why Germany\r\nis distrusted and disliked in Europe. _She is mainly distrusted\r\nbecause she continues to be the reactionary force in international\r\npolitics._ Outside the sphere of German influence the democratic ideal\r\nhas triumphed all over the civilized world, after centuries of heroic\r\nstruggle and tragic catastrophes. But in Germany the old dogma is\r\nstill supreme. Wherever German power has made itself felt for the last\r\nforty years--in Italy and Austria, in Russia and Turkey--it has\r\ncountenanced reaction and tyranny. In politics Germany is to-day what\r\nAustria and Russia were in the days of the Holy Alliance, the power of\r\ndarkness. Whilst in the provinces of science and art the German people\r\nare generally progressive, in politics the German Government is\r\nconsistently retrogressive. It cannot be sufficiently emphasized and\r\nrepeated that, more than any other State--more even than\r\nRussia--Prussia stands in the way of political advance. It was Prussia\r\nthat helped to crush the Polish struggle for freedom in 1863; when, a\r\nfew years ago, English public opinion was protesting against the\r\nArmenian massacres, the Kaiser stood loyally by Abdul Hamid and\r\npropped his tottering throne; when the Russian Liberals were engaged\r\nin a life-and-death struggle with Czardom, the Kaiser gave his moral\r\nsupport to Russian despotism. It is not too much to say that it is the\r\nevil influence of Prusso-Germany alone which keeps despotism alive in\r\nthe modern world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--PRUSSIA CONTROLS GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult to exaggerate the political domination of Germany by\r\nPrussia. The practice belies the theory: it is not as German Emperor\r\nbut as Prussian King that William II. rules the confederation. The\r\nlarger is merged in the smaller. The poor barren plains of Brandenburg\r\nand Pomerania rule over the smiling vineyards and romantic mountains\r\nof the south and west. The German people are governed more completely\r\nfrom Berlin and Potsdam than the French were ever governed from Paris\r\nand Versailles. And they are governed with an iron hand. In theory,\r\nevery part of the empire may have a proportional share in the\r\nadministration of the country; in reality, Prussia has the ultimate\r\npolitical and financial control. Germany pays the taxes; Prussia\r\nspends them. Germany provides the soldiers; Prussia commands them. And\r\nthe Prussian War Lord and his Junkers in the last resort decide the\r\nissues of peace and war.\r\n\r\nTo realize how complete is the Prussian control we need only consider\r\nthe fact that in the supreme Federal Parliament--the Bundesrat--for\r\nforty-two years the Prussian representatives have always had it their\r\nown way. Yet Prussia, according to the Constitution, has only got\r\nseventeen delegates out of fifty-two. When the Imperial Constitution\r\nwas framed it was thought that the Prussian representation was far too\r\nsmall, and the fear was repeatedly expressed that the Prussian vote in\r\nthe Bundesrat would be overruled. But not once has it happened that\r\nthe German majority in the Bundesrat has dared to oppose any important\r\nmeasure initiated by the Prussian Government. For all practical\r\npurposes, therefore, Prussia is the suzerain power. The German\r\nprincipalities and kingdoms are reduced to political tutelage and\r\nsubjection.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--WHY PRUSSIA HAS ENSLAVED GERMANY.\r\n\r\n\"How shall we explain this startling paradox? How is it, and why is\r\nit, that the artistic and exuberant, genial and sentimental German\r\nsubmits to the hard rule of the commonplace, uninteresting, and dour\r\nPrussian?\r\n\r\nIf you ask ninety-nine out of a hundred Germans they will not give you\r\na reply. They know too little of and care too little about politics to\r\nbe even aware of the fact. They are satisfied with appearances. They\r\ndo not see the King of Prussia behind the German Kaiser. They are\r\nhypnotized by the glittering helmet of the War Lord.\r\n\r\nBut if you succeed in discovering one in a hundred who understands the\r\nrelation between Germany and Prussia, and who has thought out the\r\npolitical problem, he will probably give you something like the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n'I know that there is no love lost between the Germans and the\r\nPrussians. I know that in culture and native ability we are as\r\nsuperior to the Prussians as our vine-clad hills are superior in\r\nbeauty to the sandy wastes of Pomerania. And I know that in politics\r\nwe play a subordinate part, although we are superior. But I also\r\nrealize that it is necessary for us to submit. And it is necessary for\r\nus to submit, precisely because of our virtues. For those virtues of\r\nours are unpractical. And it is necessary for the Prussians to rule,\r\nprecisely because of their shortcomings. For those shortcomings are\r\npractical. The pure gold of the German temper could never be made\r\ninto hard coin nor used to advantage. It could be made to produce\r\nsplendid works of art, gems and diadems and ornaments, but for\r\npractical purposes, in order to forge the weapons of the Nibelungen,\r\nthe alloy of the baser metal was indispensable. It required the\r\nmixture of Prussian sand and Prussian iron to weld us into a nation,\r\nto raise us to an empire. It is because we Germans are artists and\r\ndreamers and individualists that we could never manage our own\r\naffairs, that we have always been \"non-political animals.\"[6] On the\r\ncontrary, it is because the Prussian has no brilliance, no romance, no\r\npersonality, that he makes a splendid soldier and a model bureaucrat.\r\nTwo things above all were required to make Germany into a powerful\r\nState--a strong army and a well-ordered administration. Prussia has\r\ngiven us both.\r\n\r\n    [6] This is again and again admitted even by the most\r\n    patriotic German writers. (See General von Bernhardi's last\r\n    book, \"The Coming War\": \"Wir sind ein unpolitisches\r\n    Volk\"--\"We are a non-political people.\")\r\n\r\n'And let us not forget that Germany more than any other Power required\r\nsuch a strong army and such a strong administration, not only owing to\r\nthe shortcomings of her national character, but owing to the weakness\r\nand danger of her geographical position. Germany is open on every\r\nfrontier. She has ever been harassed by dangerous enemies. Only a\r\ngeneration ago she was threatened on every side. On the north she had\r\nto face the rulers of the sea, who hampered her commercial expansion;\r\non the west she had to face the restless Gaul; on the south she was\r\nconfronted with the clerical and Jesuitical empire of the Habsburg; on\r\nthe east with the empire of the Romanovs. From all those enemies\r\nPrussia has ultimately saved us. The Hohenzollern dynasty has proved a\r\nmatch for them all.\r\n\r\n'The whole annals of Germany and Prussia are a striking proof of the\r\npolitical weakness of the German and of the strength of the Prussian\r\ncharacter. Again and again Germany has witnessed magnificent outbursts\r\nof national prosperity. She has seen the might of the Hohenstaufen;\r\nshe has seen the wealth of the Hansa towns. Again and again she has\r\nwitnessed the spontaneous generation and blossoming of civic\r\nprosperity; she has seen the glory and pride of Nuremberg and\r\nHeidelberg, of Cologne and Frankfurt, the art of Dürer and Holbein.\r\nBut again and again German culture has been nipped in the bud. It has\r\nbeen destroyed by civil war and religious war, by internal anarchy and\r\nforeign invasion. The Thirty Years' War devastated every province of\r\nthe German Empire, and such was the misery and anarchy that in many\r\nparts the people had reverted to savagery and cannibalism.[7] And\r\nhardly had the country recovered from the horrors of the wars of\r\nreligion, when repeated French invasions laid waste the rich provinces\r\nof the Rhine and Palatinate. So completely did German rulers of the\r\neighteenth century betray their duty to the people that some Princes\r\ndegraded themselves to the point of selling their soldiers to the\r\nHanoverian Kings in order to fight the battles of England in America.\r\n\r\n    [7] See Arvède Barine's \"Madame: Mère du Régent.\"\r\n\r\n'Whilst the German Princes were thus squandering the treasure and\r\nlife-blood of their subjects, there was growing up in the North a\r\nlittle State which was destined from the most unpromising beginnings\r\nfor the most glorious future. It is true that the little Prussian\r\nState was wretchedly poor; for that very reason the Prussian rulers\r\nhad to practise strict economy and unrelenting industry. It is true\r\nthe country was always insecure and constantly threatened by powerful\r\nneighbours; for that very reason the people had to submit to a rigid\r\ndiscipline and a strong military organization. It is true the country\r\nwas depopulated; for that very reason the rulers had to attract\r\nforeign settlers by a just, wise, and tolerant government.'\r\n\r\nA patriotic German might illustrate in the following simple parable\r\nthe complex and strange relations between Germany and Prussia:\r\n\r\n'The German people a century ago might be compared to the heirs and\r\nowners of an ancient estate. The estate was rich and of romantic\r\nbeauty. The heirs were clever, adventurous, and universally popular.\r\nBut although devoted to each other, they could not get on together.\r\nTheir personality was too strong, and they were always quarrelling.\r\nNor could they turn to advantage their vast resources, and the natural\r\nwealth of the estate only served to attract outside marauders. They\r\nwere so extravagant and so unpractical that they would lay out\r\nbeautiful parks and build magnificent mansions whilst neglecting to\r\ndrain the land and to repair the fences. They would spend lavishly on\r\nluxuries, but they would grudge food to the cattle and manure to the\r\nfields. Thus, with all their splendid possessions, the German heirs\r\nwere always on the verge of bankruptcy.\r\n\r\n'To extricate themselves, they decided to accept the services of a\r\nfactor and manager. The factor was the Prussian Junker. He was an\r\nalien. For he could hardly be called a German. In blood he was more\r\nSlav than Teutonic. He was unrefined, unsympathetic, and overbearing.\r\nBut as a manager he was splendid. He bought up outlying parts to round\r\noff the estate. He paid more attention to the necessaries than to the\r\nluxuries and the amenities of life. He was more careful to surround\r\nhimself with a strong police force than with poets and minstrels. But\r\nhe was able to keep out the marauders and the poachers. He was able to\r\nprotect the property against stronger neighbours and to bully the\r\nweaker neighbours into surrendering desirable additions to the estate.\r\nIn a short time the heirs, formerly universally popular, were\r\ncordially hated in the land. But their rents had increased by leaps\r\nand bounds, and the German estate had been rounded off and made into\r\none solid and compact whole.'\r\n\r\nSuch, German writers would tell us, is the parable of Germany and\r\nPrussia. The Germans are the gifted, generous, and spendthrift heirs\r\nto an illustrious domain. Prussia is the alien, upstart, unpopular,\r\nunsympathetic, bullying factor and manager. But to this bullying\r\nfactor Germany owes the consolidation and prosperity of the national\r\nestate.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--THE GERMAN REICHSTAG AS A DEBATING CLUB.\r\n\r\n\"We are apt to forget that, strictly speaking, a Parliamentary\r\ngovernment does not exist in Germany, although we constantly speak of\r\na 'German Parliament.' According to the Constitution, the Chancellor\r\nis not responsible to Parliament, he is only responsible to the\r\nEmperor. There is no Cabinet or delegation of the majority of the\r\nReichstag. There is no party system. There are only party squabbles. I\r\ndo not know whether Mr. Belloc would approve of the German\r\nConstitution, but it certainly enables the Government to soar high\r\nabove all the parties in the Reichstag. German Liberals may be morally\r\njustified in their struggle against political reaction, but\r\ntechnically the Government are acting within their constitutional\r\nright. And when, therefore, the Reichstag attempts to control the\r\nexecutive, it is rather the Reichstag which is unconstitutional. On\r\nthe other hand, when the Emperor asserts his Divine right, it is he\r\nwho is true to the spirit of the Constitution; he is only giving a\r\nreligious interpretation and colour to a political prerogative which\r\nhe undoubtedly possesses. And not only is there no Parliamentary\r\ngovernment, but there is not even a desire, except with a small\r\nfraction of Radicals, to possess such a government. Prussian\r\npublicists again and again tell us that Germany does not want to copy\r\nEnglish institutions. The old German monarchic institutions are good\r\nenough for Germany. Read the treatise of Treitschke, the great\r\nhistorian and political philosopher of modern Prussia. He\r\nsystematically attempts to belittle every achievement of the\r\nParliamentary system; and every prominent writer follows in his\r\nfootsteps. Prussia has not produced a Guizot, a Tocqueville, a Stuart\r\nMill, or a Bryce. Her thinkers are all imbued with the traditions of\r\nenlightened despotism. Even the great Mommsen cannot be adduced as an\r\nexception. He makes us forget his Liberalism, and only remember his\r\nCæsarism.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the Reichstag are very limited. It is mainly a machine\r\nfor voting supplies, but even that financial control is more nominal\r\nthan real. For under the Constitution the Assembly must needs make\r\nprovision for the army and navy, which are outside and above party\r\npolitics. And having previously fixed the contingent of the Imperial\r\nforces, the army and navy estimates must needs follow. In the present\r\ntension of international politics, a reduction is out of the question.\r\nTheoretically, the Reichstag can indeed oppose an increase, but\r\npractically the increase is almost automatic. The Reichstag could only\r\npostpone it, and in so doing would have to face unpopularity. Every\r\nparty vies with its rivals in sacrificing their principles on the\r\naltar of patriotism. Whereas the Catholic party in Belgium has for\r\ntwenty-eight years refused the means of national defence, and has made\r\nthe Belgian Army into a byword on the plea that barrack life is\r\ndangerous to the religious faith of the peasant, the German Catholics\r\nhave voted with exemplary docility every increase of the army and\r\nnavy. Only once did they dare to propose a small reduction in the\r\nestimates for the expenditure on the war against the Herreros. But the\r\nindignation they raised by their independent attitude, and the\r\ndoubtful elections of 1907, taught them a practical lesson in\r\npatriotic submission which they are not likely soon to forget.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag, therefore, is largely a debating club, and its debates\r\nare as irresponsible as those of students in a University union,\r\nbecause no speech, however eloquent, carries with it any of the\r\nresponsibilities of government. The Opposition in England is careful\r\nof the language it uses, and more careful of the promises it makes,\r\nbecause it knows that it may be called upon to fulfil its promises and\r\nto carry out the policy it advocates. In Germany there is no such\r\npossibility. The Opposition is only platonic. It is doomed to\r\nimpotence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--THE SERVILITY OF THE GERMAN UNIVERSITIES AND OF THE CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n\"It has often happened in other countries when the expression of free\r\nopinions has become dangerous or difficult that independent political\r\nthought has taken refuge in the Universities. Even in Russia the\r\nUniversities have been a stronghold of Liberalism. In the Germany of\r\nthe first half of the nineteenth century many a University professor\r\nsuffered in the cause of political liberty. In the Germany of to-day\r\nthe Universities are becoming the main support of reaction.\r\nProfessors, although they are nominated by the faculties, are\r\nappointed by the Government; and here again the Government only\r\nappoints 'safe' men. A scholar who has incurred the displeasure of the\r\npolitical authorities must be content to remain a _Privatdozent_ all\r\nhis life. _The much-vaunted independence of the German professors is a\r\nthing of the past._ They may be independent scientifically; they are\r\nnot independent politically. It is not that scholars have not the\r\nabstract right to speak out, or that they would be dismissed once they\r\nhave been appointed; rather is it that they would not be appointed or\r\npromoted. A young scholar with Radical leanings knows that he will not\r\nbe called to Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe German Universities still lead political thought; they still wield\r\npolitical influence, and their influence may be even greater to-day\r\nthan it ever was, but that influence is enlisted almost exclusively on\r\nthe side of reaction.\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of the Universities is true of the Churches. Of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church it is hardly necessary to speak. _Non ragionar\r\ndi lor, ma guarda e passa._ The history of German Catholicism proves\r\nonce more that the Church is never more admirable than when she is\r\npersecuted. During the Kulturkampf the Catholics stood for political\r\nliberty, whereas the so-called National Liberals stood for State\r\ncentralization and political despotism. To-day, from being persecuted,\r\nthe Catholic Church has become a persecuting Church. She has entered\r\ninto an unholy compact with the Prussian Government. She has ceased to\r\nbe religious, and has become clerical. She has ceased to be universal.\r\nShe has become narrowly Nationalist. She might have played a glorious\r\npart in the new empire. Instead she has resisted every attempt at\r\nfinancial reform. She might have resisted the oppressive policy\r\nagainst the Poles. Instead she has connived at oppression. She might\r\nhave opposed the orgies of militarism. Instead she has voted every\r\nincrease in the army and navy. She has bartered her dignity and\r\nspiritual independence to secure confessional privileges, and to get\r\nher share in the spoils of office.\r\n\r\nThe Protestant Churches have not had the same power for evil, yet\r\nthey have fallen even lower than the Catholic Church. They have lost\r\neven more completely every vestige of independence. German University\r\ntheologians may be advanced in higher criticism, but they are\r\nopportunists in practical politics. They are very daring when they\r\nexamine the Divine right of Christ, but they are very timid when they\r\nexamine the Divine right of the King and Emperor. Protestantism\r\nproduced one or two prominent progressive leaders; but they have had\r\nto leave their Churches. Dr. Naumann has become a layman; Stöcker,\r\nwhen he espoused the cause of the people, was excommunicated, and the\r\nKaiser hurled one of his most violent speeches against his once\r\nfavourite Court chaplain.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.--THE PAN-GERMAN PLOT.[8]\r\n\r\n    [8] This was written and published in 1906.\r\n\r\n\"For forty years Germany had been seeking an outlet for her teeming\r\npopulation and her expanding industries. Hitherto emigration had\r\nseemed to be a sufficient outlet and a sufficient source of strength.\r\nBut as Germany was becoming more and more the controlling power of the\r\nContinent, she refused to be contented with sending out millions of\r\nher sons, who, as mere emigrants to foreign countries, were lost to\r\nthe Vaterland.[9] How different would the power of Germany have been,\r\nGerman Imperialists were ever repeating, if the 20,000,000 Teutons who\r\nhave colonized the United States, or Brazil, or Argentina, and have\r\nbeen absorbed and Americanized and Saxonized, had settled in\r\nterritories under the Imperial flag!\r\n\r\n    [9] To-day the immigration into Germany exceeds the\r\n    emigration.\r\n\r\nAnd thus Pan-Germanists have been looking towards every part of the\r\nhorizon. They have first looked to the north and the north-west, and\r\nthey have reflected that the Rhine ought to belong to the Vaterland;\r\nthat Amsterdam, Rotterdam, and Antwerp are the natural German\r\nharbours; that Denmark, Holland, and Flemish Belgium are the outposts\r\nof Germany for the transit commerce of Europe; and that all these\r\noutposts ought to be included either in an economic Zollverein or in a\r\npolitical confederation.[10]\r\n\r\n    [10] In Justus Perthes's widely scattered \"Alldeutscher\r\n    Atlas,\" edited by Paul Langhans, and published by the\r\n    Alldeutscher Verband, both Holland and Flemish Belgium are\r\n    considered and \"coloured\" as an integral part of the future\r\n    German Empire.\r\n\r\nBut Germany wisely realized that those northern ambitions would meet\r\nwith absolute resistance on the part of other Powers, that she was not\r\nyet strong enough to defy that resistance, and that this fulfilment of\r\nher aspirations must be postponed until she was prepared to fight for\r\nthe mastery of the sea. In the meantime, she contented herself with\r\n_peacefully_ annexing the commerce of the Flemish and Dutch ports,\r\nwith building up a mercantile and a war navy, with advocating the\r\nhistorical maritime philosophy of Captain Mahan, and with repeating on\r\nevery occasion the famous note of warning: '_Unsere Zukunft ist auf\r\ndem Wasser._' Biding her time, and following the line of least\r\nresistance, Germany for the last twenty years therefore extended\r\nsteadily towards the south and towards the east. Towards the south\r\nshe saw two decaying empires, Austria-Hungary and Turkey, which seemed\r\nto be a natural prey for her political and commercial ambitions: two\r\nconglomerates of hostile races which are waiting for a master. Towards\r\nthe east she saw one of the most ancient seats of human civilization,\r\na huge and rich territory, which is the one great country, in close\r\nproximity to Europe, which is still left unoccupied and undeveloped.\r\nOn those three empires Germany set her heart, and with the method and\r\ndetermination which always characterize her she set to work. And with\r\nan equally characteristic spirit this gigantic scheme of commercial\r\nand political absorption of three empires, from the Upper Danube to\r\nthe Persian Gulf, was being explained away and justified by an all\r\ncomprehensive watchword: the _Drang nach Osten_. It was only in\r\nresponse to this irresistible call and impulse, this _Drang_ and\r\npressure, it was only to obey an historical mission, that the Teuton\r\nwas going to regenerate the crumbling empires of Austria, of Turkey,\r\nand of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, let us consider for one moment the\r\nAustrian-Hungarian Empire. It is now fifty years since, through the\r\nBattle of Sadowa, Austria-Hungary was ousted from the German\r\nConfederation. The same reasons which impelled Protestant Prussia to\r\ndrive Catholic Austria from the Germanic Confederation are still in\r\nlarge measure subsisting to-day, and I do not think that the\r\nHohenzollern has any intention of forcing the Habsburg into the\r\nConfederation again, merely to obey the behests of the Pan-Germanists.\r\nPrussia has no interest whatever in reopening the ancient dualism of\r\nNorth and South, in re-establishing the two poles and antipodes,\r\nBerlin and Vienna. _As a matter of fact, ever since 1870\r\nAustria-Hungary has been far more useful to German aims in her present\r\ndependent condition than if she were an integral part of the\r\nConfederation._ In Continental politics as well as in colonial\r\npolitics, a disguised protectorate may be infinitely preferable to\r\nvirtual annexation. The protectorate of Tunis has given far less\r\ntrouble to France than the colony of Algeria. And for all practical\r\ninterests and purposes, Austria-Hungary has become a German\r\ndependency. She has been drawn into the orbit of the Triple Alliance.\r\nShe follows the political fortunes of the predominant partner. She\r\nalmost forms part of the German Zollverein, in that her tariffs are\r\nsystematically favourable to her northern neighbour. _But above all,\r\nAustria-Hungary renders to Germany the inestimable service both of\r\n'civilizing'--that is, of 'Germanizing'--the inferior races, the\r\nSlavs, and of keeping them in check. It is a very disagreeable and\r\ndifficult task, which Germany infinitely prefers to leave to Austria\r\nrather than to assume herself._ And it is a task for which, as\r\nProfessor Lamprecht, the national historian, is compelled to admit,\r\nthe Austrian German seems far more qualified than the Prussian German.\r\nAnd Germany can thus entirely devote herself to her world ambitions,\r\nwhilst Austria is entirely absorbed by her racial conflict--for the\r\nKing of Prussia!\r\n\r\nFor the last twenty-five years the process of Germanizing has been\r\ngoing on without interruption. A bitter war of races and languages is\r\nbeing waged between the Austrian German and the Magyar, between the\r\nTeuton and the Slav. Of the Slav the Austrian Teuton wants to make\r\nhis political slave. To him 'Slav' and 'slave' are synonymous words;\r\nand when we consider that the Slavs are disunited in language and\r\nreligion, and that they hate each other almost as cordially as they\r\nhate the _Niemets_; and when we further consider that behind the ten\r\nmillions of Austrian Germans there will be sixty-five millions of\r\nother Germans to support them, whilst the Catholic Tcheches and Poles\r\ncan only fall back on the support of abhorred and heretical Russia,\r\nthere is every reason to fear that the Slav must eventually come under\r\nthe economic and political control of the Austrian Germans--that is to\r\nsay, ultimately under the influence of the German Empire.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only the Slavs of the Austrian Empire that are\r\nthreatened by German absorption; that absorption has rapidly extended\r\nto the Slav States of the Balkan Peninsula. On the south as well as on\r\nthe north of the Danube, Austria has been used as the 'cat's-paw,' or,\r\nto use the more dignified expression of Emperor William, as the 'loyal\r\n_Sekundant_' of the Hohenzollern. The occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina,\r\nin defiance of the Treaty of Berlin, was the beginning of that\r\nAustrian _Drang nach Osten_ policy, the next object of which is the\r\npossession of the Gulf of Salonica, and the ultimate object of which\r\nis the control of Constantinople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.--GERMANY CONTROLLING TURKEY.[11]\r\n\r\n    [11] This was published in 1906.\r\n\r\n\"The absorption of Turkey is not a distant dream: it is very nearly an\r\naccomplished fact. Twenty-five years ago Germany declared she had no\r\npolitical stake in the affairs of Turkey. As recently as the\r\n'seventies, Bismarck proclaimed in the Reichstag that the Eastern\r\nQuestion was not worth the loss of one Pomeranian soldier.\r\n\r\nTo-day Germany is wellnigh supreme on the Bosphorus. She started by\r\nsending military instructors, amongst whom was the famous General Von\r\nder Goltz Pasha, and by reorganizing the Turkish Army on the German\r\nmodel. She then sent her travellers, absorbing the commerce of the\r\ncountry. She then sent her engineers, obtaining concessions, building\r\nrailways, and practically obtaining the control of the so-called\r\n'Oriental' line. Finally, she became the self-appointed doctor of the\r\n'sick man.' Whenever the illness of recent years came to a\r\ncrisis--after the Armenian and the Macedonian atrocities, after the\r\nCretan insurrection--Germany stepped in and paralyzed the action of\r\nEurope. It was Germany that not only enabled Turkey to crush Greece\r\nand to restore her military prestige: it was Germany that enabled her\r\nto reap the fruits of victory.\r\n\r\nFor ten years Lohengrin appeared as the temporal providence, the\r\nprotector of Abdul Hamid. The Holy Roman Emperor appeared as the\r\nsaviour of the Commander of the Faithful. A Power which did not have\r\none Mohammedan subject claimed to protect two hundred million\r\nMohammedans. And when, in 1897, Emperor William went on his memorable\r\npilgrimage to Jerusalem, this latter-day pilgrim entered into a solemn\r\ncompact with a Sovereign still reeking from the blood of 200,000\r\nChristians. The Cross made an unholy alliance with the Crescent.\r\n\r\nThis alliance, coinciding with the journey to Jerusalem, marked a\r\nfurther step in the forward movement, in the _Drang nach Osten_\r\npolicy. It was the third and the last stage, and by far the most\r\nimportant one. It was obvious that, on the European side of the\r\nBosphorus, Germany could not make much further progress for some years\r\nto come. The times were not ripe. International jealousies might be\r\nprematurely roused, all the more so because neither the German Kaiser\r\nnor his subjects have the discretion and modesty of success. But on\r\nthe Asiatic side there extended a vast Asiatic inheritance, to which,\r\nas yet, there was no European claimant; to which already, forty years\r\nago, German patriots like Moltke, German economists like Roscher and\r\nList, had drawn the attention of the Vaterland--a country with a\r\nhealthy climate and with infinite resources as yet undeveloped. This\r\nwas to be in the immediate future the field of German colonization. On\r\nhis way to Jerusalem the German Emperor pressed once more his devoted\r\nfriend the Sultan for an extension of German enterprise in Asia Minor.\r\nThe concession of the railway to Baghdad was granted, and a new and\r\nmarvellous horizon opened before the Hohenzollern.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.--GERMAN SOCIALISM MAKING FOR REACTION AND WAR.\r\n\r\n\"And not only is German Socialism not as strong, neither is it as\r\npacifist as is generally supposed. Outsiders take it for granted that\r\nin the event of a conflict between France and Germany there would be\r\nsolidarity between the French and the German artisans. They assume\r\nthat Socialism is essentially international. And in theory such an\r\nassumption is quite legitimate. But many things in Germany are\r\nnational which elsewhere are universal. And in Germany Socialism is\r\nbecoming national, as German political economy is national, as German\r\nscience is national, as German religion is national. Therefore the\r\npolitical axiom that German Socialists would necessarily come to an\r\nunderstanding with their French and English brethren has been\r\nfalsified by the event. German Socialists have, no doubt, shown their\r\npacific intentions; they have issued pacific manifestoes and organized\r\npacific processions; they have filed off in their hundreds of\r\nthousands in the streets of Berlin to protest against the war party;\r\nbut when the question of peace or war has been brought to a point in\r\nSocialist congresses--when their foreign brethren have moved that in\r\nthe case of an unjust aggression the German Social Democrats should\r\ndeclare a military strike--German Socialists have refused to assent.\r\nThe dramatic oratorical duel which took place between the French and\r\nthe German delegates at the Congress of Stuttgart illustrates the\r\ndifferences between the national temperament of the Frenchman and the\r\nGerman. When called upon to proclaim the military strike, the German\r\nSocialists gave as an excuse that such a decision would frighten away\r\nfrom the Social Democrat party hundreds of thousands of middle-class\r\nsupporters. This excuse is an additional proof of the moral and\r\npolitical weakness of Social Democracy. It illustrates its moral\r\nweakness; for the Socialist leaders sacrifice a great principle for\r\nthe sake of an electoral gain. The leaders know that nationalist\r\nfeeling runs high in the middle classes; they know that any\r\nanti-militarist policy would be unpopular. And they have not the\r\ncourage as a party to face unpopularity. And the arguments used at\r\nStuttgart also illustrate the political weakness of German Socialism;\r\nfor they show that the Socialist vote does not possess the cohesion\r\nand homogeneity with which it is credited: they show that hundreds of\r\nthousands of citizens who record a Socialist vote are not Socialists\r\nat all. To vote for Socialism is merely an indirect way of voting\r\nagainst the Government. There is no organized Opposition in Germany.\r\nThe Socialists are the only party who are \"agin the Government.\" And\r\nall those German citizens who are dissatisfied with conditions as they\r\nare choose this indirect and clumsy method of voting for the\r\nSocialists in order to express their dissatisfaction with the present\r\nPrussian despotism.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore not true to say that Socialism in Germany is a\r\ndecisive force working for peace. It would be more true to say that it\r\nis a force working for war, simply because it is a force working for\r\nreaction. Prussian reaction would not be so strong if it were not for\r\nthe bugbear of Social Democracy. If Social Democracy attracts a\r\nconsiderable section of the lower middle class, it repels and\r\nfrightens the bulk of the middle classes as well as of the upper\r\nclasses. Many Liberals who would otherwise oppose the Government\r\nsupport it from horror of the red flag, and they strengthen\r\nunwillingly the power of reaction. And therefore it would scarcely be\r\na paradox to say that the nearer the approach of the Socialistic\r\nreign, the greater would be the danger to international peace. German\r\ncontemporary history illustrates once more a general law of history,\r\nthat the dread of a civil war is often a direct cause of a foreign\r\nwar, and that the ruling classes are driven to seek outside a\r\ndiversion from internal difficulties. Thus political unrest ushered in\r\nthe wars of the Revolution and the Empire; thus the internal\r\ndifficulties of Napoleon III. brought about the Franco-German War;\r\nthus the internal upheaval of Russia in our days produced the\r\nRusso-Japanese War.\r\n\r\nIt may be true that power is slipping away from the hands of the\r\nPrussian Junkerthum and the bureaucracy, although Prussian reaction is\r\nfar stronger than most foreign critics realize. But whether it be\r\nstrong or weak, one thing is certain: a power which has been supreme\r\nfor two centuries will not surrender without a struggle. The Prussian\r\nJunkers may be politically stupid, but they have not lost the fighting\r\nspirit, and they will not give way to the 'mob.' Before Prussian\r\nreaction capitulates, it will play its last card and seek salvation in\r\na European conflagration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.--IS THE KAISER MAKING FOR PEACE OR FOR WAR?\r\n\r\n\"Is the tremendous power and popularity of the Kaiser exercised in the\r\ndirection of peace or in the direction of war?\r\n\r\nTo an Englishman the Kaiser's devotion to military pursuits, his\r\nfrequent brandishing of the sword, his aggressive policy of naval\r\nexpansion, seem to be in flagrant contradiction with his no less\r\npersistent protests both of his sympathy for England and of his love\r\nfor peace. We are reminded that Napoleon III. also delighted to\r\nexpress his love for peace--\"_L'Empire c'est la paix_\"--yet he brought\r\nabout the most disastrous war in French history. We are reminded that\r\nNicholas II. of Russia also started his reign as the peacemaker of\r\nEurope, the initiator of the Conference of The Hague, yet he brought\r\nabout the most bloody war in Russian history. Are the Kaiser's pacific\r\nprotests as futile, are his sympathies as hollow, as those of a\r\nNapoleon or a Nicholas?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, if the Kaiser's protests of peace are supported by many\r\nof his utterances and sanctioned by the interests of his dynasty, they\r\nare contradicted not only by many other utterances, but, what is more\r\nserious, they are contradicted by his personal methods, and, above\r\nall, by the whole trend of his general policy.\r\n\r\nVery few observers have pointed out one special reason why the\r\npersonal methods of the Kaiser will prove in the end dangerous to\r\npeace--namely, that they have tended to paralyze or destroy the\r\nmethods of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nLittle as we may like the personnel of legations and embassies,\r\nstrongly as we disapprove of the methods by which they are recruited,\r\nurgent as is the reform of the Foreign Office, it remains no less true\r\nthat the function of diplomacy is more vital to-day than it ever was\r\nin the past. For it is of the very purpose and _raison d'être_ of\r\ndiplomacy to be conciliatory and pacific. Its object is to achieve by\r\npersuasion and negotiation what otherwise must be left to the\r\narbitrament of war. It is a commonplace on the part of Radicals to\r\nprotest against the practices of occult diplomacy. In so far as that\r\nprotest is directed against the spirit which animates the members of\r\nthe diplomatic service, it is fully justified. But in so far as it is\r\ndirected against the principle of secret negotiation, the protest is\r\nabsurd. For it is of the very essence of diplomacy that it shall be\r\nsecret, that it shall be left to experts, that it shall be removed\r\nfrom the heated atmosphere of popular assemblies, and that it shall\r\nsubstitute an appeal to intellect and reason for the appeal to popular\r\nemotion and popular prejudice.\r\n\r\nFor that reason it is deeply to be regretted that the personal\r\ninterferences of the Kaiser have taken German diplomacy out of the\r\nhands of negotiators professionally interested in a peaceful solution\r\nof international difficulties, and have indirectly brought diplomacy\r\nunder the influence of the German 'patriot' and the jingo. An\r\nAmbassador need not depend on outside approval; his work is done in\r\nquiet and solitude. The Kaiser, on the contrary, conducts his foreign\r\npolicy in the glaring limelight of publicity; and whenever he has been\r\ncriticized by experts, his vanity has only too often been tempted to\r\nappeal to popular passion and to gain popular applause. For that\r\nreason, and entirely apart from his indiscretions, the bare fact that\r\nthe Kaiser has become his own Foreign Secretary has lessened the\r\nchances of peace.\r\n\r\nNor has the whole trend of his domestic policy been less injurious to\r\nthe cause of peace. In vain does the Kaiser assure us of his pacific\r\nintentions: a ruler cannot with impunity glorify for ever the wars of\r\nthe past, spend most of the resources of his people on the\r\npreparations for the wars of the future, encourage the warlike spirit,\r\nmake the duel compulsory on officers and the _Mensur_ honourable to\r\nstudents, place his chief trust in his Junkers, who live and move and\r\nhave their being in the game of war, foster the aggressive spirit in\r\nthe nation, and hold out ambitions which can only be fulfilled by an\r\nappeal to arms: a ruler cannot for ever continue to saw the dragon's\r\nteeth and only reap harvests of yellow grain and golden grapes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.--BELGIUM THE ACHILLES HEEL OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\"Personally I am inclined to think that the fear of a German invasion\r\nhas haunted far too exclusively the imagination of the English people,\r\nand has diverted their attention from another danger far more real and\r\nfar more immediate. With characteristic _naïveté_ and insular\r\nselfishness, some jingoes imagine that if only the naval armaments of\r\nGermany could be stopped, all danger to England would be averted. But\r\nsurely the greatest danger to England is not the invasion of England:\r\nit is the invasion of France and Belgium. For in the case of an\r\ninvasion of England, even the Germans admit that the probabilities of\r\nsuccess would all be against Germany; whilst in the case of an\r\ninvasion of France, the Germans claim that the probabilities are all\r\nin their favour. It is therefore in France and Belgium that the\r\nvulnerable point lies, the Achilles heel of the British Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--THE NEUTRALITY OF BELGIUM WILL BE VIOLATED.\r\n\r\n\"It is true that in theory the neutrality of Belgium is guaranteed by\r\ninternational treaties; but when I observe the signs of the times, the\r\nambitions of the German rulers, and when I consider such indications\r\nas the recent extension of strategic railways on the Belgian-German\r\nfrontiers, I do not look forward with any feeling of security to\r\nfuture contingencies in the event of a European war. I am not at all\r\nconvinced that the scare of a German invasion of England is justified.\r\nIndeed, I am inclined to believe the Germans when they assert that in\r\ncase of war Germany would not be likely to invade Britain. She would\r\nbe far more likely to invade Belgium, because Belgium has always been\r\nthe pawn in the great game of European politics, and has often been,\r\nand may again become, the battlefield and cockpit of Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.--THE COMING WAR WILL BE A POLITICAL AND RELIGIOUS CRUSADE.\r\n\r\n\"If a war between the two countries did break out, it would not be\r\nmerely an economic war, like the colonial wars between France and\r\nEngland in the eighteenth century; rather would it partake of the\r\nnature of a political and religious crusade, like the French wars of\r\nthe Revolution and the Empire. _The present conflict between England\r\nand Germany is the old conflict between Liberalism and despotism,\r\nbetween industrialism and militarism, between progress and reaction,\r\nbetween the masses and the classes._ The conflict between England and\r\nGermany is a conflict, on the one hand, between a nation which\r\nbelieves in political liberty and national autonomy, where the Press\r\nis free and where the rulers are responsible to public opinion, and,\r\non the other hand, a nation where public opinion is still muzzled or\r\npowerless and where the masses are still under the heel of an absolute\r\ngovernment, a reactionary party, a military Junkerthum, and a despotic\r\nbureaucracy.\r\n\r\nThe root of the evil lies in the fact that in Germany the war spirit\r\nand the war caste still prevail, and that a military Power like\r\nPrussia is the predominant partner in the German Confederation. The\r\nmischievous masterpiece of Carlyle on Frederick the Great, and his\r\nmore mischievous letter to _The Times_, have misled English opinion as\r\nto the true character and traditions and aims of the Prussian\r\nmonarchy. Prussia has been pre-eminently for two hundred years the\r\nmilitary and reactionary State of Central Europe, much more so even\r\nthan Russia. Prussia owes whatever she is, and whatever territory she\r\nhas, to a systematic policy of cunning and deceit, of violence and\r\nconquest. No doubt she has achieved an admirable work of organization\r\nat home, and has fulfilled what was perhaps a necessary historic\r\nmission, but in her international relations she has been mainly a\r\npredatory Power. She has stolen her Eastern provinces from Poland. She\r\nis largely responsible for the murder of a great civilized nation.\r\nShe has wrested Silesia from Austria. She has taken Hanover from its\r\nlegitimate rulers. She has taken Schleswig-Holstein from Denmark,\r\nAlsace-Lorraine from France. And to-day the military caste in Prussia\r\ntrust and hope that a final conflict with England will consummate what\r\nprevious wars have so successfully accomplished in the past. They are\r\nall the more anxious to enter the lists and to run the hazards of war\r\nbecause it becomes more and more difficult to govern a divided\r\nReichstag and a dissatisfied people without uniting them against a\r\nforeign enemy, and because they realize that unless they restore their\r\nprestige and consolidate their power by a signal victory the days of\r\ntheir predominance are numbered.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.--THE NATURE OF THE COMING WAR.\r\n\r\n\"The war of to-morrow, therefore, will not be like the war of 1870, a\r\nwar confined to two belligerent forces: it will be a universal\r\nEuropean war. Nor will it be a humane war, subject to the rules of\r\ninternational law and to the decrees of the Hague Tribunal: it will be\r\nan inexorable war; or, to use the expression of von Bernhardi, it will\r\nbe 'a war to the knife.' Nor will it be decided in a few weeks, like\r\nthe war of 1870: it will involve a long and difficult campaign, or\r\nrather a succession of campaigns; it will mean to either side\r\npolitical annihilation or supremacy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CURSE OF THE HOHENZOLLERN\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--ROYALTIES MADE IN GERMANY.\r\n\r\nIt has become a trite and hackneyed claim of the Prussian\r\nmegalomaniacs that they are an Imperial people, a super-race\r\npredestined by Nature and Providence to the domination of the world.\r\nIt certainly seems a grotesque claim to assert on the part of a people\r\nwho in their political and social life have shown themselves a\r\npre-eminently _servile_ people; who have ever been cringing to their\r\nsuperiors; who never produced one single leader of free men, one\r\nCromwell, one Mirabeau, one Gambetta; who always believed in the\r\nvirtue of passive obedience; who always submitted to the policeman\r\nrather than to a policy; who always obeyed a Prince rather than a\r\nprinciple; who, as recently as the end of the eighteenth century,\r\nallowed themselves to be sold like cattle by Hessian princelings; who\r\nnever rose to defend their sacred rights; who never fought a spirited\r\nbattle in a righteous civil war; and who have always been ready to\r\nfight like slaves at the bidding of a sword-rattling despot.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in one very important respect the Germans may rightly claim\r\nthat they are actually ruling the European world. German Princes are\r\nactually seated on almost every throne of Europe. The French language\r\nmay still be the language of diplomacy, but the German language, which\r\nwas still a despised lingo to Frederick the Great, has become the\r\nlanguage of European royalties. Germany for two hundred years has done\r\na most thriving and most lucrative export trade in princelings. One\r\nHohenzollern Prince ruling in Roumania for thirty years asserted\r\nGerman influence in that Latin country. Another Hohenzollern Prince\r\nruling in Athens, nicknamed \"Tino\" by his affectionate relative the\r\nKaiser, for three years stultified the will of his people, who were\r\ndetermined to join the cause of the Allies. Still another German\r\nPrince ruling in Sofia, who five years ago was mainly responsible for\r\nthe horrors of the second Balkan War, compelled the Bulgarian nation\r\nto betray the cause of Russia, to whom the Bulgarian people owe their\r\npolitical existence and liberation from the yoke of the Turk.\r\n\r\nEven yet public opinion does not realize to what an extent European\r\nPrinces in the past have been made in Germany. We speak of the Royal\r\nHouse of Denmark as a Danish House. The Danish House is in real fact\r\nthe German dynasty of Oldenburg. We speak of the House of Romanov as a\r\nRussian dynasty. And it is true that the founder of the dynasty,\r\nMichael Romanov, the son of Philarete, Archbishop of Moscow and\r\nPatriarch of all the Russias, was a typical Muscovite, and was called\r\nto the throne in 1611, in troubled times, by the unanimous voice of\r\nthe people. But, as all the Czars of Russia for two hundred years only\r\nmarried German Princesses, _without one single exception_, the\r\nRussian dynasty had become in fact a German dynasty. So far as mere\r\nheredity is concerned, Nicholas II., through the German marriages of\r\nall his ancestors, is of German stock to the extent of sixty-three\r\nsixty-fourths, and of Russian stock only in the proportion of one\r\nsixty-fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE HOHENZOLLERN DYNASTY.\r\n\r\nOf all the German dynasties seated on the thrones of Europe, the\r\nHohenzollern stand out, not merely as the most powerful, but also by\r\nfar the most striking and the most interesting. The Hohenzollern are\r\nas unique in the history of royalty as the Rothschilds are unique in\r\nthe history of finance. The history of other dynasties has been\r\nlargely a history of Court scandal and intrigue, providing\r\ninexhaustible material to the petty gossip of Court chroniclers. We\r\nare all familiar with the amorous episodes of Louis XIV. and Louis\r\nXV., with the mysteries of the Grand and Petit Trianon and of the Parc\r\naux Cerfs, with Madame de Maintenon and Madame de Montespan, with\r\nMadame de Pompadour and Madame du Barry, that beautiful courtesan who\r\non the scaffold so pathetically asked the executioner: \"Mr. Hangman, I\r\nbeseech you, do spare me.\" We are all familiar through Thackeray's\r\n\"History of the Georges\" with the _chronique scandaleuse_ of the\r\nHanoverian dynasty. No doubt the Hohenzollern also have had their\r\n_chronique scandaleuse_ and have also attracted the prurient curiosity\r\nof memoir writers. The Court of Berlin in the days of the polygamist\r\nKing, Frederick William II., the successor of Old Fritz, was the most\r\ndissolute Court of Europe, as Berlin is to-day the most depraved city\r\non the Continent. But somehow the scandals of the Hohenzollern seem to\r\nbe irrelevant episodes. Somehow we do not think of the annals of the\r\naugust House as a history of scandal. We only think of the\r\nHohenzollern as the political necromancers of modern Europe, as the\r\nsupreme masters of statecraft. The very name of the Hohenzollern\r\nrecalls to our minds a race of State-builders. Machiavelli selected\r\nthe House of Borgia to illustrate the principles of the statecraft of\r\nthe Renaissance. A modern Machiavelli would have to go to Potsdam to\r\nstudy the philosophy of high politics.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning the Hohenzollern have been identified with the\r\nPrussian State. Louis XIV. said of himself, \"_L'état c'est moi_,\" but\r\nLouis XIV. was an exception in modern French history. On the contrary,\r\nevery Hohenzollern could have applied to himself the words of the\r\nBourbon King.\r\n\r\nIf we take each individual Hohenzollern, we find the most obvious\r\ndifferences between them. No dynasty more strikingly illustrates that\r\npsychological and political peculiarity of royal houses, which may be\r\ncalled the law of opposites, and which has almost the regularity of a\r\nuniversal law according to which each ruler is the living contrast of\r\nhis predecessor. The successor of the Great Elector, Frederick I.\r\n(1688-1713), the first King of Prussia, was an extravagant fop who\r\nspent a year's income on the ceremony of coronation. On the contrary,\r\nhis successor, \"Fat William\" (1713-1740), the Sergeant-King, was a\r\nmiser, who on his coronation only spent 2,227 thalers and ninepence,\r\nwhere his father had squandered over six millions, a maniac who\r\ncollected tall grenadiers as other Kings have collected pictures, who\r\ntortured his children, and who wanted to punish with a death sentence\r\na juvenile escapade of the heir to the throne. Frederick the Great\r\n(1740-1786), again, was the antithesis of Frederick William I., and\r\nloved literature and art as intensely as his father detested them.\r\nFrederick William II. (1786-1797), the successor of the great realist\r\nand woman-hater, was a polygamist and a mystic. Frederick William III.\r\n(1797-1840) was an exemplary husband and a well-meaning, business-like\r\nbourgeois. He was succeeded by Frederick William IV. (1840-1861), a\r\nromanticist and a dreamer who ended in madness. William I. (1861-1888)\r\nwas an honest, straightforward, methodical, reasonable,\r\nself-controlled soldier. Frederick III. was an idealist, and, like\r\nFrederick the Great, a lover of literature and art. William II. has\r\nbewildered the world as a versatile and omniscient dilettante,\r\nwar-lord and peacemaker, Mohammedan and Christian--always a comedian,\r\nyet always in earnest. And we all know how the heir to the throne is\r\nthe reverse of the Kaiser, and how this Crown Prince, with the fancies\r\nof a degenerate, has deserved to be called the \"Clown Prince.\"\r\n\r\nIt is therefore apparent that if we analyze the characteristics of\r\nevery one of the nine dynasts who have reigned in Prussia since the\r\nGreat Elector for the last two hundred and fifty years, we do not find\r\none single ruler who resembles his predecessor or his successor. Yet\r\nall these Hohenzollerns, whether capable or incapable, whether mad,\r\nhalf-mad, or sane, whether profligate or domesticated, whether\r\nextravagant or miserly, have certain common traits. They have all been\r\ninspired with the same dynastic policy. When we consider the\r\nindividual variations from the family type, there can be here no\r\nquestion of physical heredity, like the lip of the Habsburg or the\r\ntainted blood of the Spanish Bourbons. It is a question of political\r\nenvironment, a question of dynastic tradition. Indeed, we must\r\ncarefully study that Hohenzollern family tradition of politics if we\r\nwant to grasp the full significance of the word, if we wish to\r\nunderstand how such a dynastic tradition may become a formidable power\r\nto European history. Maeterlinck in his \"Life of the Bee\" has an\r\neloquent and profound chapter on the \"Spirit of the Hive.\" In the\r\ndomestic and international policy of the Prussian State, in the\r\nHohenzollern dynastic tradition, we discover such a collective spirit,\r\nthe \"Spirit of the Prussian Hive,\" the evil spirit of war mania and\r\nmegalomania, the treachery, the brutality, the greed, and, above all,\r\nthe predatory instinct dignified into the name of _Real Politik_. And\r\nEurope will only enjoy permanent peace and security if she succeeds in\r\ndestroying that Hohenzollern tradition, that sinister spirit which\r\nlives in the wasps' and hornets' nest of Berlin, that spirit which has\r\n\"Potsdamized\" Europe, and which has debased the moral currency of\r\nEuropean politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--LANDMARKS IN HOHENZOLLERN HISTORY.\r\n\r\nNo one would call the political history of Germany an interesting\r\nhistory. It is only the history of free nations or the free play of\r\nspiritual forces that is of abiding human interest, and the history of\r\nGermany is neither the history of a free people nor the conflict of\r\nspiritual forces. That history is so intolerably tedious that even the\r\nmagic of Treitschke's genius has not been able to relieve its dulness,\r\nand that before the war no British or French publisher dared venture\r\non a translation of Treitschke's masterpiece. But if the political\r\nhistory of Germany has all the tedium and monotony of parochialism, on\r\nthe contrary, the personal history of the Hohenzollern is intensely\r\ninstructive. One would hesitate to call it romantic. Yet there is an\r\nelement of romance, the romance of business, the interest which\r\nattaches to the rise of a family from the humble obscurity of a petty\r\nprinceling to the power and prestige of world rulers, the same kind of\r\ninterest which belongs to the life-story of Mr. Vanderbilt or Mr.\r\nCarnegie. What a progress those Hohenzollerns have made from the\r\ndistant days when they left their little Swabian southern home of\r\nZollern between the Neckar and the Upper Danube, the cradle of their\r\ndynasty! _Nomen, omen!_ Does not the very sound of the word\r\n_Hohenzollern_ suggest and inspire high ambitions? And does not the\r\nvery name of that little village of Zollern, which is apparently\r\nderived from _Zoll_, suggest that all the world was henceforth to pay\r\na Zoll, or toll, to the dynasts of Hohenzollern?\r\n\r\nAnd what a strange succession of incidents! In themselves those\r\nincidents may seem insignificant. They left little trace in the\r\nchronicles of olden times. Yet those petty incidents have proved\r\ndecisive events in the annals of modern humanity. We see those events\r\nhappening from generation to generation without any apparent\r\nconnection. Yet somehow they all made for the aggrandizement of the\r\nfamily. We see successive Princes acquiring through marriage and\r\ninheritance possessions in scattered and remote outposts of the Holy\r\nRoman Empire. Yet somehow all those outposts became eventually\r\nmilestones on the highway to greatness. One ancestor becomes Burgrave\r\nof Nuremberg--a considerable promotion! A subsequent Burgrave of\r\nNuremberg lends money to a needy Austrian Emperor, and becomes in 1417\r\nElector of Brandenburg--a much more considerable promotion! Again,\r\nanother ancestor inherits at the other extremity of Germany the petty\r\ndukedom of Cleves, and that dukedom became the nucleus of Prussian\r\npower in the Far West of Germany. Still another ancestor of a\r\ncollateral branch becomes Grand Master of the religious Order of the\r\nTeutonic Knights, and this fact induces Master Martin Luther, who was\r\nmuch more of a realist and a time-server and a trimmer than\r\ntheologians give him credit for, to advise the Hohenzollern Grand\r\nMaster to secularize his knights, to confiscate the whole Church\r\nproperty of the Order, and to make himself the overlord of Eastern\r\nPrussia.\r\n\r\nThus everything has worked for the aggrandizement of the future Kings\r\nof Prussia, everything has brought grist to the mill of Sans-Souci.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--A DYNASTY OF UPSTARTS.\r\n\r\nNo dynasts in modern times, not even the Bourbons nor the Habsburgs,\r\nhave been more obsessed with the pride of race. A double avenue of\r\ngaudy statues in Berlin has been erected in the Siegesallee, or Alley\r\nof Victory, to illustrate the glories of the House. And Carlyle, in\r\nhis \"History of Frederick the Great,\" devotes a whole volume--and a\r\nvery tedious volume--to the medieval ancestors of the dynasty. The\r\npresent Kaiser believes himself to be the lineal successor, not only\r\nof the Hohenstaufen, but of the Cæsars of Ancient Rome. It was in that\r\nspirit that he was graciously pleased recently to dedicate a monument\r\nto his predecessor, Emperor Trajan! _Trajano Romanorum Imperatori,\r\nWilhelmus Imperator Germanorum!_ (To Trajan, Emperor of the Romans,\r\nWilliam, Emperor of the Germans!)\r\n\r\nBut all that Hohenstaufen-Hohenzollern genealogy is mythical history.\r\nThe real history of the Hohenzollern is of recent date, and begins in\r\n1640 with the advent of the Great Elector (1640-1688). Compared with\r\nthe ancient House of Habsburg or of Bourbon, the Hohenzollern may well\r\nbe called the \"parvenus\" of royalty. Until the seventeenth century the\r\nElectors of Brandenburg were twice vassals--lieges of the Holy Roman\r\nEmpire and vassals of the Kings of Poland; and when in 1701 the first\r\nHohenzollern King promoted himself to royal rank and ascended the\r\nthrone, he made ceaseless and humiliating attempts to secure\r\nrecognition. The old Houses refused to accept his title, and would\r\nnot acknowledge the upstart royal \"brother.\"\r\n\r\nBut the very fact that the Hohenzollern are the \"parvenus\" of European\r\nroyalty has spurred them on to more strenuous endeavours and to still\r\nhigher ambitions. Their sole endeavour was to raise their position:\r\n_sich considerable machen_, as the Great Elector said in his quaint\r\npidgin German. They were not born to the royal dignity. They had to\r\nmake it. They were not accepted as Kings. They had to assert\r\nthemselves and to impose their claims. The good sword of Frederick the\r\nGreat asserted his claims with such results that, except Napoleon, no\r\nruler ever since has disputed the right of the Hohenzollern to rank\r\namongst the dynasts of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--PRUSSIA AS AN UPSTART STATE.\r\n\r\nEven as the Hohenzollern are an upstart dynasty, so the Prussian State\r\nmay be called an upstart State. It has not, like France, Great\r\nBritain, or Spain, two thousand years of history behind it. Until the\r\nend of the Middle Ages Christian civilization was bounded by the Elbe.\r\nThe Prussian populations were the last in Europe to be converted to\r\nChristianity, and recent history has proved only too conclusively that\r\nthe conversion never struck deep roots. Until the end of the Middle\r\nAges the religious and military Order of the Teutonic Knights had to\r\nwage war against the Prussian heathen, and the magnificent ruin of\r\nMarienburg, the stately seat of the Teutonic Knights, still testifies\r\nto the achievements of the Order. Marienburg is the only historic city\r\nof Prussia; Berlin is but a mushroom growth of modern days. Whilst\r\nLondon and Paris go back to the beginning of European history, Berlin\r\nonly three hundred years ago was a mean village inhabited by Wendish\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be sufficiently emphasized that Prussia is not a nation, but\r\na State, and that State is an entirely artificial creation. France and\r\nGreat Britain are the slow and natural growths of many centuries. They\r\nhave definite geographical boundaries, their people have common\r\ntraditions, common ideals, common affinities. The Prussian State is\r\nmade up of a heterogeneous mosaic of provinces, the spoils of\r\nsuccessive invasions. What hold together the artificial fabric of the\r\nPrussian State are only the dynasty, the bureaucracy, and the Army.\r\nThe bureaucracy and the Army are to Prussia what the Civil Service and\r\nthe British Army are to the Indian Empire. Suppress the British Army\r\nand the Civil Service, and British rule ceases to exist. Suppress the\r\nHohenzollern dynasty, the Prussian bureaucracy, and the Junker Army,\r\nand the Prussian structure crumbles to pieces.\r\n\r\nNature has been niggardly to Prussia. Everything has had to be made\r\nwith the hands of man. Brandenburg, Pomerania, Western and Eastern\r\nPrussia are dreary wastes; Berlin is an oasis of brick and stone\r\namidst a Sahara of sand. The provinces of old Prussia have few\r\nindustrial resources. The very soil had to be made by intensive\r\nagricultural methods. The very population had to be imported. Modern\r\nPrussia is neither the gift of Nature nor the outcome of history. It\r\nis the triumph of human statecraft. It is the achievement of the\r\n\"will to power.\" When that \"will to power\" relaxes the Prussian State\r\ncollapses.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--THE PRUSSIAN STATE IS NOT A GERMAN STATE.\r\n\r\nThe modern Holy German Empire is born of the unholy nuptials of the\r\nGerman people with the Prussian State. But the paradox is that the\r\nPrussian State, which claims the right to rule the German States, who\r\nthemselves assert their right to rule over Europe, cannot even pretend\r\nto be German. The contrast between the German and the Prussian has\r\noften been pointed out.\r\n\r\nThe Southern and Western German is still to-day, as he was in the days\r\nof Madame de Staël, artistic and poetic, brilliant and imaginative--a\r\nlover of song and music. The Prussian remains as he has always been,\r\ninartistic, dull, and unromantic. Prussia has not produced one of the\r\ngreat composers who are the pride of the German race; and Berlin, with\r\nall its wealth and its two million inhabitants, strikes the foreigner\r\nas one of the most commonplace capitals of the civilized world. The\r\nSouthern and Western German is gay and genial, courteous and\r\nexpansive; the Prussian is sullen, reserved, and aggressive. The\r\nSouthern and Western German is sentimental and generous; the Prussian\r\nis sour and dour, and only believes in hard fact. The Southern and\r\nWestern German is an idealist; the Prussian is a realist and a\r\nmaterialist, a stern rationalist, who always keeps his eye on the main\r\nchance. The Southern and Western German is independent almost to the\r\nverge of anarchism; he has a strong individuality; his patriotism is\r\nmunicipal and parochial; he is attached to his little city, to its\r\npeculiarities and local customs; the Prussian is imitative, docile,\r\nand disciplined; his patriotism is not the sentimental love of the\r\nnative city, but the abstract loyalty to the State. The Southern and\r\nWestern German is proud of his romantic history, of his ancient\r\nculture; the Prussian has no culture to be proud of.\r\n\r\nThat contrast of temperament between Prussians and Germans corresponds\r\nto a difference of race. The Prussians are not really Teutons. They\r\nare alien intruders. The Prussians, the Pruzi or Pruteni, are\r\nLithuanians. The population of Brandenburg is Slav. Berlin,\r\nBrandenburg, or Brannybor, are Slav-Wendish names. The ruler of the\r\nGrand Duchy of Mecklenburg, a State which is even more Prussian than\r\nPrussia, and which is a strange survival of feudalism, bears until\r\nthis day the name of \"Prince of the Wendes.\"\r\n\r\nCentury after century the Burgraves of Brandenburg and Kings of\r\nPrussia had to attract colonists to their dreary dominions. The\r\nrecruiting sergeant went out all over Europe to fill the ranks of the\r\nPrussian Army. One-third of Frederick the Great's Army was made up of\r\nforeigners. Frederick the Great on his accession found himself at war\r\nwith the Prince-Bishop of Liége, because that worthy prelate would not\r\nallow his subjects to be impressed by the Prussian press-gang.\r\nPrussian colonizing agents scoured the neighbouring countries for\r\nagricultural labourers, foresters, and artisans. Twenty thousand\r\nBohemians were imported by the Sergeant-King. In the eighteenth\r\ncentury by far the most important element introduced into Prussia was\r\nof French origin. The majority of the French Huguenots of the lower\r\nclasses were attracted to Prussia. The population of Berlin, which was\r\nonly 6,000, was doubled by the French exodus. The very language spoken\r\nat Berlin was a savoury mixture of French and German. _Ein plus\r\nmachen_ meant in the language of the Grand Elector to have a surplus\r\nrevenue. To express his ideal of kingship, the _Elector_ said: _Ich\r\nstabilire die souveraineté auf einen rocher von Bronce._ _Dem Regiment\r\nobligat_ expressed the obligation of military service. At the\r\naccession of Frederick the Great, out of a population of 2,400,000,\r\n600,000 were refugees. It is one of the most impressive instances of\r\nhistorical retribution that modern Prussia should thus have been built\r\nup with the assistance of French exiles, and that modern France should\r\nhave been crushed by the descendants of the French Protestants who\r\nwere expelled by the bigotry of Louis XIV.\r\n\r\nThe colonization of Prussia has proceeded until this day. Before the\r\nwar immigration into Germany was exceeding the emigration. Polish\r\nlabour continues to migrate to the Eastern provinces. Hence the odious\r\nexpropriations of Polish land in the district of Posen. The ablest\r\nliterary and industrial and political talent from all parts of Germany\r\nhas been attracted for generations to the Prussian capital. Prussian\r\njingoes claim for Prussia the credit of every administrative\r\nimprovement, of every political achievement of modern Germany. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the Prussian State has achieved little by itself. Its\r\noriginality is never to initiate, but skilfully to exploit the\r\ncreations of others. It is a safe rule to assume that every statesman\r\nor leader who has made an original contribution to Prussian history is\r\nnot of Prussian origin. The greatest philosopher of Prussia, Kant, was\r\na Scotsman. Her greatest statesman, Stein, was a Westphalian. Of the\r\ntwo greatest Prussian Generals, one, Blücher, was a Mecklenburger; the\r\nother, Moltke, was a Dane. The national historian of Prussia,\r\nTreitschke, is a Saxon of Bohemian descent.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--PRUSSIA AS A MILITARY STATE.\r\n\r\nThat colony of many heterogeneous populations is above all a military\r\nState, a _Kriegstaat_. It was created through war and has been\r\norganized for war. In the eighteenth century the whole of Prussia was\r\none vast camp and barracks. The King of Prussia is primarily the\r\n_Kriegsherr_, or war-lord. The ruling caste of Junkers is a caste of\r\nwarriors. The very _schoolmasters in the eighteenth century were\r\nnearly all recruited from the invalided non-commissioned officers_.\r\nHistorians single out Fat William, the Sergeant-King, as the supreme\r\ntype of the martinet King. But it is not only Fat William, but all the\r\nKings of Prussia who have been martinet Kings and recruiting\r\nsergeants. Prussia has made war into an exact science. Prussia has\r\ncreated the \"nation in arms.\"\r\n\r\nGeographical conditions and the ambitions of the Hohenzollern have\r\ncombined to make war a permanent necessity. Prussia was a \"mark\" or\r\nfrontier land, and the margraves or mark-grafs were the earls and\r\nprotectors of the Mark. The frontiers of Prussia were open on every\r\nside. She was surrounded by enemies. George William, the father of the\r\nGreat Elector, during the Thirty Years' War tried to maintain\r\nneutrality. He soon found out that neutrality did not pay, and his\r\nterritory was overrun by hostile bands. Pomerania was occupied and\r\nretained by the Swedes. Poles, Russians, and Austrians in turn invaded\r\nthe country. After the Battle of Kunersdorff, in 1761, Prussia was at\r\nher last gasp, and Frederick the Great found himself in so desperate a\r\nposition that he had resolved on committing suicide. Again, after\r\nJena, Berlin was occupied by the French, and for five years remained\r\nunder the yoke. Insecurity has been for generations the law of\r\nPrussian existence. The Prussian State has known many ups and downs\r\nand has passed through many tragic vicissitudes. They managed to turn\r\ngeographical and military necessities to the advantage of their\r\ndynastic ambitions. What was at first commanded by the instinct of\r\nself-preservation became afterwards a habit, a tradition, and a\r\nsystematic policy. They discovered that the best way to maintain an\r\nefficient defensive was to transform it into a vigorous offensive.\r\nThey discovered that the best means of living safely was to live\r\ndangerously. They discovered, in the words of Treitschke, that \"the\r\none mortal sin for a State was to be weak.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--PRUSSIA AS A PREDATORY STATE.\r\n\r\nNot only is Prussia a military State, it is also a predatory State.\r\nAll the great Powers of Europe have been in a sense military States.\r\nBut to them all war has only been a means to an end, and often a means\r\nto higher and unselfish ends. The Spaniards were a military nation,\r\nbut their wars were crusades against the Moor. The Russians have been\r\na military nation, but their wars were crusades against the Turk or\r\nwars for the liberation of the Serbians, the Bulgarians, and the\r\nGreeks. The French have been a military nation, but they fought for a\r\nchivalrous ideal, for adventure, for humanity. Even Napoleon's wars of\r\nconquest were really wars for the establishment of democracy. The\r\nCorsican was the champion and the testamentary executor of the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of the Prussian State is that it has been from the\r\nbeginning a predatory State. The Hohenzollerns have ever waged war\r\nmainly for spoliation and booty. Not once have they waged war for an\r\nideal or for a principle.\r\n\r\nThe German Kaiser delights to appear in the garb of the medieval\r\nknight. He wears three hundred appropriate uniforms. A German wit has\r\nsaid that he wears the uniform of an English Admiral when he visits an\r\naquarium, and that he dons the uniform of an English Field-Marshal\r\nwhen he eats an English plum-pudding. Amongst those three hundred\r\ndisguises there is none which is more popular in Germany than that of\r\nthe Modern Lohengrin bestriding the world in glittering armour. The\r\nKaiser lacks the democratic gift of humour, and does not seem to be\r\naware of the incongruity of the Lohengrin masquerade. A Prussian King\r\ncannot honestly play the part of a knight in quest of the Holy Grail.\r\nChivalry and Prussianism, the crusading spirit and the predatory\r\nspirit, are contradictory terms.\r\n\r\nThe most exalted Order of the Prussian dynast is the Order of the\r\nBlack Eagle. The Hohenzollerns could not have chosen a more fitting\r\nemblem than that of the sinister bird of prey. For they have been\r\npre-eminently the men of prey amongst modern dynasts. Every province\r\nof their dominions has been stolen from their neighbours. They\r\nsecularized and stole the Church property of the Teutonic Order. They\r\nstole Silesia from Austria. They acquired Posen by murdering a noble\r\nnation. They stole Hanover from its lawful rulers. They stole\r\nSchleswig-Holstein from the Danes. They wrested Alsace-Lorraine from\r\nthe French.\r\n\r\nCircumstances in modern times seem to have singularly favoured their\r\ndesigns of conquest. To outward appearance they were threatened by\r\npowerful enemies, but those enemies looked far more formidable than\r\nthey appeared. On the Far Western boundary, the feeble ecclesiastical\r\nPrinces of Cologne, Treves, and Mayence ruled over the smiling fields\r\nand vineyards of the Rhine provinces. On every side Germany was broken\r\nup into petty principalities. The Holy Roman Empire of Germany, which\r\nwas neither Holy nor Roman nor German, and which had ceased to be an\r\nempire, was only the shadow of a great name. Austria was perpetually\r\ndistracted by internal and external dangers. Poland was an unruly\r\nrepublic. The very weakness of their neighbours was a temptation to\r\nthe Hohenzollern.\r\n\r\nThe one redoubtable enemy to the Hohenzollern dynasty was Russia. But\r\nafter the disastrous defeat of the Seven Years' War inflicted by\r\nRussian arms, Prussia learned to control by deceit and policy a Power\r\nwhich she dared not challenge, and could not hope to overcome, on the\r\nbattlefield. From the middle of the eighteenth century Prussia\r\nconcluded a dynastic alliance with the Russian dynasty. The\r\nHohenzollerns liberally provided their Russian brethren with German\r\nPrinces and Princesses. The Prince of Holstein, who became Tsar Peter\r\nIII., was the first German Prince of the Romanov dynasty. The little\r\nCinderella Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, the future Catherine the Great,\r\nwas the first of an uninterrupted line of German Princesses. The\r\nTeutonic barons of the Baltic provinces for one hundred and fifty\r\nyears were able to control the Russian foreign policy. Nesselrode for\r\nforty years was the Foreign Minister of the Tsar, although he only\r\nspoke German and did not know a word of Russian. Nicholas I. and\r\nAlexander II., with unswerving loyalty, supported the interests of\r\ntheir Prussian brother-in-law and nephew.\r\n\r\nOn two occasions the Russian Tsars actually saved the Hohenzollern\r\nfrom complete destruction. In 1761, when Russian armies occupied\r\nBerlin, an apologetic Tsar begged to be forgiven for daring to\r\nvanquish his illustrious cousin. In 1807, at Tilsit, Prussia was only\r\nsaved from dismemberment through the quixotic intervention of Tsar\r\nAlexander I. And the Russian Tsar proved so powerless against\r\nPrussian intrigues that, although Alexander I. had concluded a close\r\nalliance with Napoleon, the German-Russian Court at St. Petersburg\r\nboycotted Napoleon's Ambassador, Savary, and eventually succeeded in\r\nbreaking the Franco-Russian coalition.\r\n\r\nBut the Hohenzollerns did not only wage a predatory war for conquest\r\nand spoliation. Their methods have been as predatory as their aims.\r\nWar to them was not merely a policy. It was a business, and often a\r\nlucrative business. In the Middle Ages war had been largely a trade. A\r\nhuge commerce in prisoners was transacted, and an enterprising Italian\r\nCondottiere would often recoup himself through the ransom of one\r\nsingle rich prisoner. The Prussians have continued those medieval\r\nmethods until this day. _Treitschke lays it down in his \"Politik\" that\r\nwar must be made to pay, and need not exhaust a Prussian Treasury._\r\n\r\nThe poor Belgians to-day are learning to their cost the full meaning\r\nof those Prussian predatory methods. The Prussian invaders are\r\nextorting millions of money, as well as enormous food-supplies, from a\r\nstarving people. They are dislocating whatever remains of the internal\r\ntrade. They are breaking up thousands of miles of Belgian railways,\r\nand they are sending them to the Polish theatre of war. But, brutally\r\nas the poor Belgians have been treated, one shudders to think of the\r\ncruelty and the greed of the Prussian in the new conquered Russian\r\nterritories, and of the pitiful plight of the Poles and the\r\nLithuanians.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--PRUSSIA AS A FEUDAL STATE.\r\n\r\nPrussia in her fiscal and commercial policy may be called a typical\r\nmodern State. The Hohenzollerns have been compelled to utilize all the\r\nresources of commerce and industry, not because they are liberal or\r\nprogressive, but merely in order to increase the national revenue, in\r\norder to provide for an ever-swelling military expenditure. On the\r\ncontrary, in her political constitution Prussia has remained a\r\nmedieval and feudal State. She is the Paradise of the Junker. But\r\nPrussian Junkerthum is not merely a squirearchy of independent\r\nlandowners. Mr. Bernard Shaw, in his \"Common Sense about the War,\" in\r\nwhich one ounce of common sense is mixed with three ounces of\r\nnonsense, would make us believe that there is little difference\r\nbetween German Junkerthum and British Junkerthum, and that there is\r\nlittle to choose between the English Junker, Sir Edward Grey, and a\r\nPomeranian squire. Mr. Shaw must have studied Prussian conditions to\r\nvery little purpose when he makes so ludicrous a comparison. To call\r\nsuch a quiet, silent country gentleman, such a law-abiding\r\nParliamentarian as Sir Edward Grey, to call even him a typical\r\nPrussian Junker is a travesty of the facts. A more striking contrast\r\nto the complete Junker of Pomerania than the \"Complete Angler\" of the\r\nForeign Office could not well be imagined. The glorified Prussian\r\nJunker is Bismarck. The typical Junker is Prince Blücher. A perfect\r\nmodern type is that fiery Freiherr von Oldenburg, who advised the\r\nKaiser to send a troop of Uhlans, as in the old Cromwellian days, to\r\nclear out the politicians of a disloyal Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian Junkers are the lieges of the war-lord. They are all the\r\nmore loyal to the throne as they are poor, and therefore dependent on\r\nthe King for their very subsistence. There are few large estates in\r\nPrussia, and they yield but a meagre revenue. The relations of the\r\nJunkers to the Hohenzollerns are the relations of William the\r\nConqueror to his companions-in-arms. The Junkers originally held their\r\nbroad acres, their _Rittergut_, by military tenure. Some of their\r\nfeudal privileges have gone, but they continue to be the leading\r\npolitical power in the State under the Kaiser's Majesty. They are the\r\npillars of the throne. They owe military service. To recall the words\r\nof the Sergeant-King, they are \"_dem Regiment obligat_.\" And they are\r\nrewarded for their military services by privileges innumerable. They\r\nare the controlling influence in the Landtag, which is a\r\nrepresentative assembly only in name. They occupy the higher posts in\r\nthe Civil Service and in the Diplomatic Service. In each district the\r\nLandrat is the supreme authority, the electioneering agent of the\r\nGovernment and the representative of the Prussian King.\r\n\r\nAnd the Junker caste have been as selfish, as rapacious, as their\r\nHohenzollern overlords. Nothing could be more sordid than their\r\nattitude in the recent campaign for financial reform. They have\r\nshifted the burden of taxation upon the weaker shoulders of the\r\npeasant and artisan. They have compelled von Bülow to reverse the\r\nLiberal Free Trade policy of Caprivi, and to impose heavy corn duties,\r\nmerely to increase their own rents.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--PRUSSIA AS A DESPOTIC STATE.\r\n\r\nIn a military State like Prussia, which is mainly organized for war,\r\nwhere war is the vital function, not only does the King hold his power\r\nby the Divine right of the sword, but even in times of peace all\r\npolitical power is concentrated into his hands: \"_L'état c'est moi!_\"\r\n\r\nIn such a State a Parliamentary Government is an absurdity, and, as a\r\nmatter of fact, there is no Parliamentary Government, neither in\r\nPrussia nor in the Empire. There is no responsible Cabinet. The\r\nChancellor is accountable, not to the majority of the Reichstag, but\r\nto the Kaiser. The Germans imagine that because they have the fiction\r\nof universal suffrage they possess the most democratic Government in\r\nEurope. And an enthusiastic German triumphantly reminded me of the\r\nfact at a mass meeting which I recently held in San Francisco on\r\nbehalf of the Allies. I reminded him that Bismarck himself has given\r\nus in his \"Memoirs\" the Machiavellic reasons which induced him to\r\ninvent the fiction of universal suffrage. The man of blood and iron\r\ntells us that he only adopted universal suffrage as a temporary device\r\nto convert the German States to the Prussian policy, and as a means of\r\ninfluencing the people against the federal dynasties.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag is essentially different from a British House of\r\nCommons. As a political body it is the most contemptible assembly in\r\nEurope. It is a mere debating club, a convenient machine to vote the\r\nGovernment taxes. And even the power of voting has been largely taken\r\nfrom it. It has become part of the German constitutional practice that\r\nthe military estimates must be passed without discussion. It is only\r\nconsiderable increases of the army and navy which have to be submitted\r\nto the Reichstag, and those increases are generally voted for a number\r\nof years. In 1887 a characteristic episode happened. Bismarck had\r\ndecided on formidable additions to the army, and he wanted those\r\nadditions voted and guaranteed for seven years. The military\r\n\"Septennate Law\" frightened even a docile Reichstag, and the Catholic\r\nparty refused to vote it. Bismarck, who for ten years had fought the\r\nPope, and who had thundered against the interference of a foreign\r\necclesiastical potentate in temporal matters, now asked the Pope to\r\ninterfere in favour of the Army Bill. To the discredit of the Papacy,\r\nLeo XIII. fell into the trap. Leo XIII. exerted pressure on the\r\nCatholic party. But they still were recalcitrant. Bismarck and the\r\nPope proved equally persistent. Finally, at the behest of the Iron\r\nChancellor and with the assistance of the Vicar of Christ, the\r\nReichstag passed that fatal military law, which was the beginning of\r\nthe colossal European armaments, which were to increase the political\r\ntension of Europe until breaking-point, and which was to result in the\r\npresent catastrophe. Thus is Parliamentary Government carried on in\r\nthe Empire of the Hohenzollern!\r\n\r\nPassive obedience and discipline are the cardinal virtues inculcated\r\nby the Hohenzollern. \"_Verboten_,\" \"_Nicht raisonniren_,\" are their\r\nwatchwords. A Hohenzollern brooks no opposition. \"_Wir bleiben doch\r\nder Herr und Koenig und thun was wir wollen_,\" said the\r\nSergeant-King. And two hundred years after, the Kaiser expresses the\r\nsame imperial sentiments: \"_Wer mir nicht gehorcht, den zerschmettere\r\nich_\" (Whoever refuses to obey, I shall smash). Bismarck, who created\r\nthe German Empire, was dismissed like a lackey. Baron von Stein, who\r\nreformed the Prussian State, and who stands out as the greatest\r\nstatesman of his age, was ignominiously dismissed. Ingratitude has\r\nalways formed part of the Hohenzollern code of royal ethics.\r\n\r\nWe are told by the apologists of the Hohenzollern that the same\r\ndiscipline, the same obedience to duty, are practised by the rulers\r\nthemselves. \"_Ich Dien_\" is the Hohenzollern motto. Of all the\r\nservants of the Prussian State, there is none who serves it more\r\nloyally, more strenuously, than the King of Prussia. \"I am the\r\nCommander-in-Chief and the Minister of Finance of the King of\r\nPrussia,\" said the Sergeant-King of himself. How often have the\r\nPrussian Kings been held up as shining examples of devotion to duty!\r\nBehold how hard a Hohenzollern King has to work for the State! In the\r\nsame way the business man who rules his staff with a rod of iron might\r\nsay to his discontented workmen: \"See how strenuously I labour for the\r\nsuccess of the business!\" The workmen would probably answer that the\r\nceaseless toil of the business man is not wholly disinterested, that\r\nthe millionaire manufacturer is not a philanthropist; and the\r\napologists of the Hohenzollern might be reminded that a King of\r\nPrussia in every generation has been wont to work mainly for himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--THE HOHENZOLLERN AS THE CHAMPIONS OF PROTESTANTISM.\r\n\r\nTreitschke urges as one of the chief claims of the Hohenzollerns that\r\nthey have been in modern Europe the champions of the Protestant\r\nreligion and at the same time the apostles of toleration. Is not the\r\nKaiser the supreme head of his Church and the Anointed of the Lord?\r\nDoes not he still preach edifying sermons to his soldiers and sailors?\r\nAnd does he not at the same time extend his Imperial protection over\r\nbelievers of every creed?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that the Hohenzollerns have never been the champions of\r\nProtestantism, but have astutely and consistently exploited it for\r\ntheir own purposes. They did espouse the Lutheran and Calvinistic\r\nfaith, but their conversion enabled them to appropriate the vast\r\ndominions of the Church, a spoliation which might have presented some\r\ndifficulties if they had remained Catholic. We saw that, during the\r\nThirty Years' War, during the supreme crisis of Protestantism, William\r\nGeorge, Elector of Brandenburg, remained neutral and allowed the\r\nNorthern hero, Gustavus Adolphus, and Cardinal Richelieu to champion\r\nthe cause of the Protestant religion.\r\n\r\nNot only did the Hohenzollerns not defend the Protestant religion;\r\nthey perverted it and debased it by subjecting it to the Prussian\r\nState. Such subjection is the negation of Protestantism, as it is the\r\nnegation of Christianity. Christianity in a political sense has always\r\nmeant the separation of the spiritual and the temporal powers. It is\r\nthe essence of Anglo-Saxon Protestantism that it actually does\r\nprotest. It is of the essence of Nonconformity that it refuses to\r\nconform. Prussian Protestantism has ceased to protest, and conforms to\r\nwhatever is demanded by the State. The Lutheran parson is the obedient\r\nservant of the Hohenzollern. \"_Cujus regio illius religio_\": spiritual\r\nallegiance must follow temporal allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate outcome of the confusion of spiritual and temporal powers\r\nin Prussia has been that Prussia has become the Atheist State, and it\r\nis because the Prussian State is an Atheist State and absolutely\r\nindifferent to the interests of religion that it has come to practise\r\nin its own peculiar way the political virtue of toleration. As the\r\nPrussian wars of conquest had brought together many heterogeneous\r\npopulations professing different religions, toleration became a vital\r\nnecessity for the State. It is not a virtue of the dynasty, and the\r\nHohenzollerns certainly deserve no credit for it. The Prussian\r\ndoctrine of toleration has always been of a negative and conditional\r\nkind. Prussian Kings have adopted the religious theory of Gibbon. All\r\nreligions are equally true to the believer. They are equally true to\r\nthe unbeliever. _They are equally useful to the State._\r\n\r\nAll religions have proved equally useful and have been exploited with\r\nequal indifference by the Prussian dynasty. The attitude of Frederick\r\nthe Great to religion is characteristic of the Hohenzollern attitude.\r\nFrederick the Great was surrounded by a band of French, Swiss, and\r\nScottish Atheists. His main relaxation from the cares of State was to\r\nbandy cynical and obscene jests on Christianity with the Table Round\r\nat the private supper-parties of Potsdam. But his royal hatred and\r\ncontempt for all positive religion did not prevent him from cordially\r\ninviting the Jesuits to his dominions because he found them useful\r\npedagogues to teach and conciliate his newly conquered Polish\r\nsubjects. It is one of the paradoxes of history that the same\r\nreligious order which had been suppressed by the Pope and expelled by\r\nthe Catholic Kings of France and Spain was protected by the Atheist\r\nKing of Prussia and the Atheist Empress of Russia. According to the\r\nsame opportunist Hohenzollern tradition, Bismarck in turn fought the\r\nPope, imprisoned Bishops and Cardinals, and then used the influence of\r\nthe Pope and the hierarchy to further his Machiavellian policy. Even\r\nso in more recent times the Kaiser appeared at one and the same time\r\nas a devout pilgrim to the Holy Land, as the special friend of Abdul\r\nHamid--Abdul the Damned--and as the self-appointed protector of three\r\nhundred million Mohammedans.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--HOW THE GERMAN PEOPLE WERE SUBJECTED TO PRUSSIA.\r\n\r\nWe have analyzed the principles which ever directed the Prussian\r\nState. We have described the characteristics of the Hohenzollern\r\ndynasty who created that Prussian State. How is it that the German\r\nnation should have surrendered their destinies to a power which is so\r\nconstitutionally selfish, so inherently evil, which has trampled down\r\nall the principles that a modern world holds dear and sacred?\r\n\r\nThe subjection of Germany to Prussia has been a triumph of\r\nHohenzollern diplomacy and deceit, and has been the outcome of a\r\ntragic misunderstanding on the part of a politically uneducated and\r\ninexperienced people. The German people were tired of their political\r\nimpotence, of their miserable dynastic quarrels, of their abject\r\nsubservience to their parasitic princelings. The German people, broken\r\nup in a hundred petty States, had the legitimate and praiseworthy\r\nambition of becoming a united people. German unity had been for\r\ngenerations a cherished dream of German patriots. History had\r\nabundantly proved that the Austrian Empire could not assist in the\r\nrealization of that dream. Then came the opportunity of the Prussian\r\ntempter. Prussia offered her mighty sword. Prussia alone had the\r\nmilitary power and a strong political organization. The German States\r\nyielded to the temptation. They trusted that, in concluding an\r\nalliance with Prussia, they would retain their liberties. Indeed, they\r\nhoped that once German unity was realized, Germany would assimilate\r\nand absorb the Prussian State. Alas! it was the Hohenzollern State\r\nwhich was to annex and subject the German Empire. Little did the\r\nGermans know Prussian tenacity. Little did they know the rapacity of\r\nthe Black Eagle. Still less did they know the black magic of the\r\nnecromancer Bismarck.\r\n\r\nTreitschke reminds us in his \"Politik\" of an incident which is\r\ncharacteristic of the relation of the German Empire to Prussia. On one\r\noccasion even Bismarck, the Prussian Junker, expressed a misgiving\r\nthat a particular law would not be acceptable to the Federal States of\r\nthe Empire. Emperor William contemptibly dismissed the objection. \"Why\r\nshould the Federal States object when they are only the prolongation\r\nof Prussia?\" Treitschke, the Saxon, accepts the Prussian theory of\r\nEmperor William. He tells us proudly that the Federal States have\r\nceased to be independent States--indeed, that they have lost the\r\nessential characteristics of a State, that they are only called States\r\nby courtesy, that there is only one State in the German Empire, and\r\nthat all the other Federal communities only continue their precarious\r\nexistence by virtue and with the consent of the Hohenzollern dynasty.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most appalling misunderstandings of history. Like\r\nFaust, the German people have sold their soul to Mephistopheles:\r\nBismarck. And they have sold it for power. They are now paying the\r\nprice. As in the wonderful old ballad of Burger, the Prussian horseman\r\nhas taken the maiden \"Germania\" on his saddle. The death's-head hussar\r\nhas carried her away on his wild career through space until he has\r\nbrought her to the gates of Hell.\r\n\r\nIt has thus been the fate of the German nation, as of other European\r\nnations, to work and fight for the aggrandizement of the King of\r\nPrussia. A section of the people, the Social Democrats and the\r\nLiberals, have made fitful and impotent efforts to free themselves\r\nfrom the tyranny of the Hohenzollern. What they have not succeeded in\r\ndoing, Europe is now doing for them. In the fulness of time, Europe\r\nhas arisen to crush the Hohenzollern, to kill the \"Spirit of the\r\nPrussian Hive.\" The war will result in the enfranchisement of Germany\r\nas it will result in the enfranchisement of Poland and Serbia. Did the\r\nhistory of the world ever present so tragic a paradox? Twelve million\r\nheroes are fighting the German Government. Millions of the manhood of\r\nthe civilized world are laying down their lives on all the\r\nbattlefields of Europe and all the high seas of the world, mainly in\r\norder to make the German people free.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--JUDGMENT ON THE HOHENZOLLERN STATE.\r\n\r\nIn 1807, after the crushing defeat inflicted by Napoleon on the\r\nPrussian armies at Jena, when the Military Monarchy crumbled to pieces\r\nin one day like a house of cards, Joseph de Maistre, the most profound\r\nand the most prophetic political thinker of his age, wrote the\r\nfollowing significant lines from St. Petersburg. To realize the full\r\nsignificance of the judgment, one must remember that Count de Maistre\r\nwas a fanatic supporter of the old monarchic order. He hated Napoleon\r\nwith a bitter hatred, but he hated Prussia more:\r\n\r\n\"Ever since I have started to reason, I have felt a special aversion\r\nfor Frederick II., whom a frenzied generation has been in a hurry to\r\nproclaim a great man, but who was really no more than a _great\r\nPrussian_. Posterity will consider this Prince as one of the greatest\r\nenemies of the human species that has ever lived. His monarchy, which\r\nhad inherited his spirit, had become an argument against Providence.\r\nTo-day that argument has been converted into a tangible proof of\r\neternal justice. This famous structure built with blood and mud, with\r\ndebased coin and base libels, has crumbled in the twinkle of an\r\neye.\"[12]\r\n\r\n    [12] De Maistre, \"Lettres et Opuscules.\"\r\n\r\nThose words were written exactly one hundred and ten years ago, and\r\nthe world is once more anxiously looking forward to another Jena which\r\nwill deal a final blow to the Hohenzollern monarchy. When that\r\ncatastrophe comes, Europe, enlightened by the awful experiences of the\r\nlast hundred years, and delivered from the black magic of the\r\npolitical necromancers of Potsdam, will unanimously echo the prophetic\r\njudgment pronounced by Joseph de Maistre. For to-day, even more than\r\nin 1807, Prussia has become an \"argument against Providence.\" Even\r\nmore than in 1807 the Prussia of 1917 \"is built with blood and mud.\"\r\nEven more than in 1807 the chastisement of Prussia is demanded by\r\n\"eternal justice.\" The whole civilized world will breathe more freely\r\nwhen the sinister and diabolical power will be broken for ever and\r\nwill oppress and degrade humanity no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN WAR-TRIUMVIRATE\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--NIETZSCHE.\r\n\r\nThe English reader is now in possession of a complete translation of\r\nNietzsche, in the admirable edition published by T. N. Foulis, and\r\nedited by Oscar Levy, of which the eighteenth and concluding volume\r\nhas just appeared. To the uninitiated I would recommend as an\r\nintroductory study: (1) Professor Lichtenberger's volume; (2)\r\nLudovici, \"Nietzsche\" (1s., Constable), with a suggestive preface by\r\nDr. Levy; (3) the very useful summary of Mr. Mügge--an excellent\r\nnumber in an excellent series (Messrs. Jack's \"People's Books\"); (4)\r\nDr. Barry's chapter in the \"Heralds of Revolt,\" giving the Catholic\r\npoint of view; (5) Mrs. Förster-Nietzsche, \"The Young Nietzsche\"; and\r\n(6) an essay by the present writer, published as far back as 1897, and\r\nwhich, therefore, may at least claim the distinction of having been\r\none of the first to draw attention in Great Britain to the great\r\nGerman writer. But a searching estimate of Nietzsche in English still\r\nremains to be written. And there is only one man that could write it,\r\nand that man is Mr. Gilbert K. Chesterton. I confidently prophesy that\r\na study of Nietzsche, if he has the courage to undertake it, will be\r\nMr. Chesterton's greatest book. He will find in the German heretic a\r\nfoe worthy of his steel.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nLike the history of most great thinkers, like the history of Kant and\r\nSchopenhauer, the biography of Nietzsche is totally barren of\r\nincident, and can be disposed of in a few lines. Born in 1844,\r\napparently of noble Polish extraction (\"Nizky\" in Polish means\r\nhumble), the son of a clergyman, and the descendant on both sides of a\r\nlong line of clergymen, the future \"Anti-Christ\" spent an exemplary,\r\nstudious, and strenuous youth. After serving his time in the army--he\r\nwas considered one of the best riders of his regiment--and after a\r\nbrilliant University career at Bonn and Leipzig, he was appointed, at\r\ntwenty-four years of age, Professor of Greek in the University of\r\nBale. His academic activity extended over eleven years, and was only\r\ninterrupted in 1870 by a few months' service in the Ambulance Corps,\r\nduring the Franco-German War.\r\n\r\nHis first book, \"The Birth of Tragedy,\" appeared in 1871. Like most of\r\nhis books, it was published at his own expense, and, like most of his\r\nbooks, it did not find a public. The three first parts of his\r\nmasterpiece, \"Thus Spake Zarathustra,\" were such a desperate failure\r\nthat Nietzsche only ventured to print fifty copies of the fourth and\r\nconcluding part, and he printed them merely for private circulation\r\namongst his friends, but he only disposed of seven copies!\r\n\r\nIn 1879 he resigned, owing to ill-health, with a pension of £120.\r\nAfter his retirement he spent a nomadic life wandering from Nice to\r\nVenice, and from the Engadine to Sicily, ever in quest of health and\r\nsunshine, racked by neuralgia and insomnia, still preaching in the\r\ndesert, still plunging deeper and deeper into solitude. And as the\r\nworld refused to listen to him, Nietzsche became more and more\r\nconvinced of the value of his message. His last book, \"Ecce Homo,\" an\r\nautobiography, contains all the premonitory symptoms of the\r\nthreatening tragedy. It is mainly composed of such headings as the\r\nfollowing: \"Why I am so Wise,\" \"Why I am so Clever,\" \"Why I write such\r\nExcellent Books,\" and \"Why I am a Fatalist.\"\r\n\r\nAlas! fatality was soon to shatter the wise and clever man who wrote\r\nthose excellent books. In 1889 Nietzsche went mad. For eleven years he\r\nlingered on in private institutions and in the house of his old mother\r\nat Naumburg. He died in 1900, when his name and fame had radiated over\r\nthe civilized world, and when the young generation in Germany was\r\nhailing him as the herald of a new age. England, as usually happens in\r\nthe case of Continental thinkers, was the last European country to\r\nfeel his influence; but in recent years that influence has been\r\nrapidly gaining ground, even in England, a fact abundantly proved by\r\nthe great and startling success of the complete edition of his works.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nMost writers on Nietzsche--and they are legion--begin with extolling\r\nhim as a prophet or abusing him as a lunatic. I submit that before we\r\nextol or abuse, our first duty is to understand. And we can no longer\r\nevade that duty. We cannot afford any longer to ignore or dismiss the\r\nmost powerful force in Continental literature, on the vain pretence\r\nthat the author was mad, as if the greatest French thinker of the\r\neighteenth century, Rousseau, and the greatest thinker of the\r\nnineteenth century, Auguste Comte, had not fallen victims to the same\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nAnd, on the whole, Nietzsche is not difficult to understand, although\r\nthere has arisen a host of commentators to obscure his meaning,\r\nalthough Nietzsche himself delights in expressing himself in the form\r\nof cryptic and mystic aphorism, although he continuously contradicts\r\nhimself. But apart from those difficulties, his message is strikingly\r\nsimple and his personality is singularly transparent. And his message\r\nand his personality are one. He is a convincing illustration of\r\nFichte's dictum, that any great system of philosophy is the outcome,\r\nnot of the intellect, but of a man's character. Nietzsche is not a\r\nmetaphysician like Hegel, whom he abhorred. He is not a\r\n\"logic-grinder,\" like Mill, whom he despised. He is a moralist, like\r\nthe French, whom he loved. His culture and learning were French even\r\nmore than German. He was steeped in Montaigne, to whom he has paid a\r\nglowing tribute in \"Schopenhauer as Educationalist.\" He was a careful\r\nstudent of the great French classics of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries. He read and annotated Guyau, with whom he had\r\nmany points in common. By a curious coincidence, a few years before\r\nthe advent of Nietzsche, a great French thinker had anticipated every\r\none of Nietzsche's doctrines, and had expressed them in one of the\r\nmost striking books of the French language. And by an even more\r\ncurious paradox, whilst every European critic devotes himself to-day\r\nto the interpretation of Nietzsche's philosophy, they systematically\r\nignore--as Nietzsche himself ignored--the masterpiece of the\r\nFrenchman.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, first keep in mind that Nietzsche is not a metaphysician\r\nor a logician, but he is pre-eminently a moralist. His one aim is to\r\nrevise our moral values and to establish new values in their place.\r\nFor Nietzsche does both. There are two poles to his thought. He is an\r\niconoclast, but he is also a hero-worshipper. He is a herald of\r\nrevolt, but he is also a constructive thinker. Even in his earliest\r\nwork, \"Thoughts out of Season,\" whilst he destroys the two popular\r\nidols of the day, the theologian and the historian, he sets up two new\r\nheroes, Schopenhauer and Wagner.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Nietzsche's philosophy is strikingly simple. Its\r\nwhole kernel can be expressed in two words. He is a systematic pagan,\r\nand he is an uncompromising aristocrat. As a pagan, he is a\r\nconsistent enemy of Christianity. As an aristocrat, he is a bitter\r\nopponent of democracy. He proclaims that Anti-Christ has appeared in\r\nhis own person. He hails the advent of the Superman.\r\n\r\nFirst, he is a pagan, a pagan of Greece, or, rather, a pagan of the\r\nRenascence, and, as a pagan, he considers Christianity the real enemy.\r\nChristianity denies life; Nietzsche asserts it. Christianity mainly\r\nthinks of the future world; Nietzsche has his feet firmly planted on\r\nMother Earth. Christianity glorifies meekness and humility; Nietzsche\r\nglorifies pride and self-assertion. Christianity defends the poor and\r\nthe weak; Nietzsche contends that the strong alone have a right to\r\nlive. Christianity blesses the peacemakers; Nietzsche extols the\r\nwarriors. Christianity is the religion of human suffering; Nietzsche\r\nis a worshipper of life, and proclaims the joyful science, _die\r\nfröhliche Wissenschaft_, the _gaya scienza_.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within the limits of a short article to discuss\r\nNietzsche's view of Christianity. We are concerned here not with\r\ndiscussion, but with exposition. At an early opportunity we hope to\r\ndeal at some length in the columns of _Everyman_ with Nietzsche's\r\ncriticism of Christianity. For the present, let it be sufficient to\r\nsay that no theologian would be prepared to accept his interpretation\r\nof the Christian religion. The everlasting conflict of spirit against\r\nsense and brutal force, which is the essence of Christianity, is\r\nhardly conducive to passivity. It is, on the contrary, a consistent\r\ndiscipline in modern heroism. There is not much meekness about the\r\nJesuits or the warrior Popes. Nor is there much melancholy about St.\r\nFrancis of Assisi or St. Theresa. The only smiling countenance in a\r\nhospital is the Sister of Mercy. The only active resisters under the\r\ndespotism of Henry VIII. were Sir Thomas More and a broken\r\noctogenarian priest, Cardinal Fisher.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe same fundamental instinct or principle, the same defiant optimism,\r\nthe same exultation in the pride of life, which makes Nietzsche into\r\nan opponent of Christianity, also makes him into an opponent of\r\ndemocracy. The same belief in force, in the will to power, which makes\r\nNietzsche into a pagan, also makes him into an aristocrat. For the\r\npolitical expression of Christianity must needs be democracy. We are\r\ndemocrats because we are Christians, because we believe in the\r\nessential dignity of man. On the contrary, the political outcome of\r\npaganism must needs be despotism and aristocracy. We believe in\r\ndespotism and aristocracy because we believe in the natural inequality\r\nof man, because we believe in force and pride and self-assertion, in\r\nthe power of the strong to oppress the weak. Nietzsche is against the\r\noppressed and for the oppressor; for the Superman against humanity.\r\nFor in Nietzsche's view an aristocracy is the ultimate purpose of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nBut Nietzsche is not an aristocrat, like the ordinary Darwinian. He\r\ndoes not believe in the survival of the fittest, like the typical\r\nevolutionist. He does not believe that a survival of the fittest will\r\ncome about mechanically by the mere play of blind forces. Regression\r\nis as natural as progression. No one has pointed this out more\r\nconvincingly than Huxley in his \"Evolution and Ethics.\" The progress\r\nof the race is not natural, but artificial and accidental and\r\nprecarious. Therefore Nietzsche believes in artificial selection. The\r\nSuperman is not born, he must be bred. Nietzsche is the spiritual\r\nfather and forerunner of the Eugenists.\r\n\r\nAnd he is also the spiritual father of the Imperialists and latter-day\r\nMilitarists. The gospel of the inequality of the individual implies\r\nthe gospel of the inequality of race. The gospel of Nietzsche has not\r\nonly been anticipated by Mr. Joseph Chamberlain, but by his much more\r\ninfluential German namesake, Mr. Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the\r\nauthor whose books the Kaiser liberally distributed amongst his\r\nGenerals and advisers. The doctrine of force, the belief in the German\r\npeople as the salt of the earth, the self-gratification of the modern\r\nTeuton, can be traced directly to the influence of Zarathustra, and it\r\nis significant that the latest German exponent of Imperialism, General\r\nvon Bernhardi, should have selected an aphorism of Nietzsche as the\r\nquintessence of his political philosophy:\r\n\r\n\"War and courage have achieved more great things than the love of our\r\nneighbour. It is not your sympathy, but your bravery, which has\r\nhitherto saved the shipwrecked of existence.\r\n\r\n\"'What is good?' you ask. 'To be braced is good.'\"[13]\r\n\r\n    [13] Nietzsche's \"Thus Spake Zarathustra,\" First Part, 10th\r\n    Speech.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nQuite apart from any elements of truth contained in Nietzsche's\r\nethics, the first reason for his popularity is, no doubt, the\r\nperfection of his form and style. Nietzsche is one of the supreme\r\nmasters of language, in a literature which counts very few masters of\r\nlanguage, and the beauty of his style is transparent even in the\r\ndisguise of a foreign translation.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is that Nietzsche, who imagined that he was fighting\r\nagainst the times, was in reality thinking with the times, and he has\r\nmet with a ready response, in the dominant instincts of the present\r\nage, in the aggressive materialism, in the race for wealth and power.\r\nThe Supermen and the Super-races of to-day only too cordially accept a\r\nphilosophy which seems to justify extortion, aggression, and\r\noppression in the name of a supreme moral principle.\r\n\r\nThe third and most important reason, and the real secret of\r\nNietzsche's influence, is the fine quality of his moral personality.\r\nHowever much we may be repelled by the thinker, we are attracted by\r\nthe magnetism of the man, by his noble courage, by his splendid\r\nintegrity, by his love of truth, his hatred of cant. Even though he\r\nhas himself misunderstood Christianity, he has done a great deal to\r\nbring us back to the fundamental ideals of the Christian religion. He\r\nhas done a great deal to undermine that superficial and \"rose-water\"\r\nview of Christianity current in official and academic Protestant\r\ncircles. He has done a great deal to convince us that whatever may be\r\nthe essence of Christianity, it has nothing in common with that silly\r\nand pedantic game which, for half a century, has made Eternal Religion\r\ndepend on the conclusions of \"Higher Criticism,\" and which has made\r\ntheology and philosophy the handmaidens of archæology and philology.\r\n\r\nNietzsche is a formidable foe of Christianity, but he is a magnanimous\r\nfoe, who certainly brings us nearer to a comprehension of the inmost\r\nmeaning of the very doctrines he attacks. And it is quite possible\r\nthat the Christian champion of the future may incorporate Nietzsche in\r\nhis apologetics, even as St. Thomas Aquinas incorporated Aristotle,\r\neven as Pascal incorporated Montaigne. It was in the fitness of things\r\nthat Nietzsche should be the descendant of a long line of Protestant\r\nministers. For, indeed, he is the last of the true German Protestants,\r\never ready to protest and to defy and to challenge. He is the noblest\r\nof modern German heretics.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--MONTAIGNE AND NIETZSCHE.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThere is a continuity and heredity in the transmission of ideas as\r\nthere is in the transmission of life. Each great thinker has a\r\nspiritual posterity, which for centuries perpetuates his doctrine and\r\nhis moral personality. And there is no keener intellectual enjoyment\r\nthan to trace back to their original progenitors one of those mighty\r\nand original systems which are the milestones in the history of human\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIt is with such a spiritual transmission that I am concerned in the\r\npresent paper. I would like to establish the intimate connection which\r\nexists between Montaigne and Nietzsche, between the greatest of French\r\nmoralists and the greatest of Germans. A vast literature has grown up\r\nin recent years round the personality and works of Nietzsche, which\r\nwould already fill a moderately sized library. It is therefore strange\r\nthat no critic should have emphasized and explained the close\r\nfiliation between him and Montaigne. It is all the more strange\r\nbecause Nietzsche himself has acknowledged his debt to the \"Essays\"\r\nwith a frankness which leaves no room to doubt.\r\n\r\nTo anyone who knows how careful Nietzsche was to safeguard his\r\noriginality, such an acknowledgment is in itself sufficient proof of\r\nthe immense power which Montaigne wielded over Nietzsche at a decisive\r\nand critical period of his intellectual development. But only a\r\nsystematic comparison could show that we have to do here with\r\nsomething more than a mental stimulus and a quickening of ideas, that\r\nMontaigne's \"Essays\" have provided the foundations of Nietzsche's\r\nphilosophy, and that the Frenchman may rightly be called, and in a\r\nvery definite sense, the \"spiritual father\" of the German.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nAt first sight this statement must appear paradoxical, and a first\r\nreading of the two writers reveals their differences rather than their\r\nresemblances. The one strikes us as essentially the sane; the other,\r\neven in his first books, reveals that lack of mental balance which\r\nwas to terminate in insanity. The one is a genial sceptic; the other\r\nis a fanatic dogmatist. To Montaigne life is a comedy; to his disciple\r\nlife is a tragedy. The one philosophizes with a smile; the other, to\r\nuse his own expression, philosophizes with a hammer. The one is a\r\nConservative; the other is a herald of revolt. The one is\r\nconstitutionally moderate and temperate; the other is nearly always\r\nextreme and violent in his judgment. The one is a practical man of the\r\nworld; the other is a poet and a dreamer and a mystic. The one is\r\nquaintly pedantic, and his page is often a mosaic of quotations; the\r\nother is supremely original. The one is profuse in his professions of\r\nloyalty to the Roman Catholic Church; the other calls himself\r\nAnti-Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that if the characteristics which we have just\r\nreferred to belonged essentially to Montaigne, there would be little\r\naffinity between the thought of Nietzsche and that of Montaigne. And\r\nit would be impossible to account for the magnetic attraction which\r\ndrew Nietzsche to the study of the \"Essays,\" and for the enthusiasm\r\nwith which they inspired him. But I am convinced that those\r\ncharacteristics are not the essential characteristics. I am convinced\r\nthat there is another Montaigne who has nothing in common with the\r\nMontaigne of convention and tradition. I am convinced that the\r\nscepticism, the Conservatism, the irony, the moderation, the\r\naffectation of humility, frivolity, pedantry, and innocent candour,\r\nare only a mask and disguise which Montaigne has put on to conceal his\r\nidentity, that they are only so many tricks and dodges to lead the\r\ntemporal and spiritual powers off the track, and to reassure them as\r\nto his orthodoxy. I am convinced that beneath and beyond the Montaigne\r\nof convention and tradition there is another much bigger and much\r\ndeeper Montaigne, whose identity would have staggered his\r\ncontemporaries, and would have landed him in prison. And it is this\r\nunconventional and real Montaigne who is the spiritual father of\r\nNietzsche.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously impossible, within the limits of a brief paper, to\r\nprove this far-reaching statement and to establish the existence of an\r\nesoteric and profound meaning in the \"Essays.\" I shall only refer to a\r\npassage which is ignored by most commentators, which has been added in\r\nthe posthumous edition, in which Montaigne himself admits such a\r\ndouble and esoteric meaning, and which seems to me to give the key to\r\nthe interpretation of the \"Essays\":\r\n\r\n\"I know very well that when I hear anyone dwell upon the language of\r\nmy essays, I had rather a great deal he would say nothing: 'tis not so\r\nmuch to elevate the style as to depress the sense, and so much the\r\nmore offensively as they do it obliquely; and yet I am much deceived\r\nif many other writers deliver more worth noting as to the matter, and,\r\nhow well or ill soever, if any other writer has sown things much more\r\nmaterial, or at all events more downright, upon his paper than myself.\r\nTo bring the more in, I only muster up the heads; should I annex the\r\nsequel I should trebly multiply the volume. And how many stories have\r\nI scattered up and down in this book, that I only touch upon, which,\r\nshould anyone more curiously search into, they would find matter\r\nenough to produce infinite essays. Neither those stories nor my\r\nquotations always serve simply for example, authority, or ornament; I\r\ndo not only regard them for the use I make of them; they carry\r\nsometimes, besides what I apply them to, the seed of a more rich and a\r\nbolder matter, and sometimes, collaterally, a more delicate sound,\r\nboth to myself, who will say no more about it in this place, and to\r\nothers who shall be of my humour.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe real and esoteric Montaigne is, like Nietzsche, a herald of\r\nrevolt, one of the most revolutionary thinkers of all times. And the\r\nGascon philosopher who philosophizes with a smile is far more\r\ndangerous than the Teuton who philosophizes with a hammer. The\r\ncorrosive acid of his irony is more destructive than the violence of\r\nthe other. Like Nietzsche, Montaigne transvalues all our moral values.\r\nNothing is absolute; everything is relative. There is no law in\r\nmorals.\r\n\r\n\"The laws of conscience, which we pretend to be derived from nature,\r\nproceed from custom; everyone having an inward veneration for the\r\nopinions and manners approved and received amongst his own people,\r\ncannot, without very great reluctance, depart from them, nor apply\r\nhimself to them without applause.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no absolute law in politics. And one form of government is as\r\ngood as another.\r\n\r\n\"Such people as have been bred up to liberty, and subject to no other\r\ndominion but the authority of their own will, look upon all other\r\nforms of government as monstrous and contrary to nature. Those who are\r\ninured to monarchy do the same; and what opportunity soever fortune\r\npresents them with to change, even then, when with the greatest\r\ndifficulties they have disengaged themselves from one master, that was\r\ntroublesome and grievous to them, they presently run, with the same\r\ndifficulties, to create another; being unable to take into hatred\r\nsubjection itself.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no law in religion. There is no justification in patriotism.\r\nThe choice of religion is not a matter of conscience or of reason, but\r\nof custom and climate. We are Christians by the same title as we are\r\nPerigordins or Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nIf to destroy all human principles and illusions is to be a sceptic,\r\nMontaigne is the greatest sceptic that ever existed. But Montaigne's\r\nscepticism is only a means to an end. On the ruin of all philosophies\r\nand religions Montaigne, like Nietzsche, has built up a dogmatism of\r\nhis own. The foundation of that dogmatism in both is an unbounded\r\nfaith in life and in nature. Like Nietzsche, Montaigne is an optimist.\r\nAt the very outset of the \"Essays\" he proclaims the joy of life. He\r\npreaches the _gaya scienza_, the _fröhliche Wissenschaft_. All our\r\nsufferings are due to our departing from the teachings of Nature. The\r\nchapter on cannibalism, from which Shakespeare has borrowed a famous\r\npassage in \"The Tempest,\" and which has probably suggested the\r\ncharacter of Caliban, must be taken in literal sense. The savage who\r\nlives in primitive simplicity comes nearer to Montaigne's ideal of\r\nperfection than the philosopher and the saint.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings us to the fundamental analogy between Nietzsche and\r\nMontaigne. Like the German, the Frenchman is a pure pagan. Here,\r\nagain, we must not be misled by the innumerable professions of faith,\r\ngenerally added in later editions and not included in the edition of\r\n1580. Montaigne is uncompromisingly hostile to Christianity. His\r\nCatholicism must be understood as the Catholicism of Auguste Comte,\r\ndefined by Huxley--namely, Catholicism minus Christianity. He\r\nglorifies suicide. He abhors the self-suppression of asceticism; he\r\nderides chastity, humility, mortification--every virtue which we are\r\naccustomed to associate with the Christian faith. He glorifies\r\nself-assertion and the pride of life. Not once does he express even\r\nthe most remote sympathy for the heroes of the Christian Church, for\r\nthe saints and martyrs. On the other hand, again and again he indulges\r\nin lyrical raptures for the achievements of the great men of Greece\r\nand Rome. He is an intellectual aristocrat. His ideal policy is the\r\npolicy of the Spartans--\"almost miraculous in its perfection.\" His\r\nideal man is the pagan hero--the superman of antiquity--Alcibiades,\r\nEpaminondas, Alexander, Julius Cæsar.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--TREITSCHKE[14] AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF PRUSSIANISM.\r\n\r\n    [14] Treitschke, \"History of Germany,\" Vols. I. and II.\r\n    (Jarrold.) Treitschke, \"Politics,\" with Introduction by A. J.\r\n    Balfour: 2 vols, (Constable, London.)\r\n\r\nThere is a most baneful delusion which has misled the Allies from the\r\nbeginning of the war, and which is still being acted on after three\r\nyears of a desperate struggle--namely, that we are mainly fighting a\r\nsinister political dynasty and a formidable political machine\r\nconstructed with all the diabolical ingenuity and armed with all the\r\nresources of the destructive genius of man. If, indeed, we had only\r\nbeen confronted by the Kaiser and his paladins, or only threatened by\r\nhis military machine, the war would long ago have been ended--if not\r\nby the Allies, then by the German people themselves. Millions of\r\npeople, however loyal, do not allow themselves to be slaughtered for a\r\ndynast, even though that dynast claims to be a Superman, even though he\r\nbe called Prince of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen or Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt,\r\neven though he be called Prince Henry XXI. of Reuss of the younger\r\nbranch or Prince Henry LXXXVIII. of Reuss of the older branch. Whole\r\nnations do not indefinitely submit to being the slaves of a machine,\r\nhowever diabolical and however perfect. The truth is that behind the\r\nGerman princes and princelings and Junkers there is the resolve of a\r\nunited people. Behind the Prussian machine there is the driving power\r\nof tremendous spiritual and moral forces, of an inflexible purpose, of\r\na compelling idealism, of a mystical creed accepted with more than\r\nMohammedan fanaticism. It is that national purpose, it is those\r\nspiritual forces, which explain the unconquerable pride of the German\r\npeople, as evil and as lofty as the pride of Satan in \"Paradise Lost.\"\r\nIt is these which explain their devotion and self-sacrifice, it is\r\nthese which explain the Teutonic legions marching to their doom\r\nsinging their hymns of love as well as their hymns of hatred. It is\r\nthese which explain the two million volunteers which in August, 1914,\r\nwent to swell the huge German conscript armies. It is the obsession of\r\nthat mystical German creed which explains the epic achievements of the\r\nGerman offensive and the even more astounding achievements of the\r\nGerman defensive. We may continue to denounce the crimes of Germany\r\nand the atrocities of the German soldiery--and I have personally\r\ndenounced them until my readers must have got sick of my\r\ndenunciations. But there is nothing particularly mysterious in crimes\r\nand atrocities, and crimes and atrocities alone do not help to explain\r\nthe German soul. Crimes and atrocities do not make us understand how\r\neven to-day the German hosts are still able to challenge a whole world\r\nin arms.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, take in the vital fact that after three years those\r\nGerman spiritual forces, those perverted German ideals, remain the\r\nmost formidable obstacle in our path. We may continue to destroy the\r\nGerman armies by the slow process of attrition, and we may continue to\r\nsacrifice the flower of our youth until the process is completed. We\r\nmay trust to our superiority in money-power and in man-power, but\r\nunless we also break the moral power of German ideals, unless we\r\nexorcise the spell which possesses the German mind, unless we triumph\r\nin the spiritual contest as well as in the battle of tanks and\r\nhowitzers, unless we overthrow the idols which successive generations\r\nof great teachers and preachers have imposed on a susceptible,\r\nreceptive, and docile people, there will be no early settlement, nor,\r\nhowever long belated, can there ever be a lasting peace.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing remarks may justify the following attempt to interpret\r\nand to make intelligible, even to the most inattentive reader, the\r\ncreed of one of the most powerful of those teachers and preachers who\r\nhave taken such mysterious and uncanny possession of the soul of the\r\nGerman nation. Before 1914 none except a few initiated had ever heard\r\nof Treitschke. Since 1914 he has become a household name and a name of\r\nevil import. But to the immense majority of readers that name, however\r\nfamiliar and ominous, remains an empty name. _Nomen flatus vocis._ And\r\neven those to whom the name conveys something more definite do not\r\ntrouble about its meaning. With that strange disbelief in the power of\r\nideas which is one of our lamentable weaknesses, and which even the\r\nwar has not been able to cure, even yet we have not brought ourselves\r\nto take seriously those terrible theories which have burnt themselves\r\ninto the Teutonic imagination. And so indifferent have we remained to\r\ndoctrines so far-reaching and so deadly that the recent publication of\r\nan excellent English translation of Treitschke's \"German History,\" one\r\nof the masterpieces of historical literature, has had to be suspended\r\nfor the incredible reason that there was no British public to read\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOn approaching the study of Treitschke's works, we are at once\r\nimpressed by the inexorable logic of his political and moral creed.\r\nThere is, perhaps, no other instance of a system so splendidly\r\nconsistent in its principles. We are told that the great French\r\nnaturalist, Cuvier, was able to reconstruct the whole anatomy of an\r\nanimal merely through examining the structure of a tooth or the\r\nfragment of a bone. Applying to the German historian the method which\r\nCuvier applied to the antediluvian mastodon, we can reduce the whole\r\ncomplex political philosophy of Treitschke from a few fundamental\r\nprinciples which he follows with a single mind, and which the Prussian\r\nState has applied with an equally relentless consistency both in its\r\ninternal and in its foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIt is this magnificent consistency, this confident dogmatism, which\r\ngives us the secret of the enormous influence of Treitschke on his\r\ncountrymen, as it explains the hypnotism of Jean-Jacques Rousseau on a\r\nprevious generation. I do not think it would be easy to overestimate\r\nthe extent of that influence. It is true that in one sense\r\nTreitschke's political philosophy only expresses the Prussian policy,\r\nand that he did not create it. But when a political ideal is expounded\r\nwith such clarity and such force, when it is propagated with such\r\nenthusiasm, when it takes such exclusive hold of the mind, it becomes\r\na hundred times more efficient and more dangerous; it acquires the\r\ncompelling force and inspires the fanaticism of religion. Those\r\nreaders who will follow Treitschke's close reasoning to the end will\r\nprobably agree with me that the political creed of which he has been\r\nthe apostle and prophet is substantially the same creed which has\r\nplunged Europe into the present world war, and that, more than any one\r\nthinker, much more certainly than Nietzsche, Treitschke must be held\r\nresponsible for the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nI have confined myself to expounding the doctrines of Treitschke. I\r\nhave not attempted to refute them. It is not my object to denounce:\r\nthere is always a sufficient number of publicists ever ready to\r\nundertake the task of denunciation. I am only trying to understand.\r\nNor have I dwelt on any side-issues. I have restricted myself to those\r\nsimple and fundamental axioms which have directed the policy of\r\nPrussia. Almost invariably in human history it is only the simple,\r\nsweeping dogmas which obtain universal acceptance.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--TREITSCHKE AS THE REPRESENTATIVE PRUSSIAN.\r\n\r\nThere exist in the realm of fiction certain literary types which are\r\nan equal joy to the creative artist and to the student of human\r\nnature. There are certain malignant diseases which are an inspiration\r\nto the pathologist. And there are criminal cases which are a\r\nrevelation to the lawyer: test cases which lead up to new discoveries\r\nand illustrate fundamental principles. What those classical types of\r\nBalzac or Dostoievski are to the critic, what those diseases and\r\ncriminal cases are to the surgeon and the lawyer, the writings of\r\nTreitschke are to the student of history and politics; they throw a\r\nnew and vivid light on the dark and hidden depths of the Prussian\r\nmind. They reveal like no other German writings the meaning of German\r\npolicy, the spirit which inspires it. They explain what without them\r\nwould have remained unexplained. He is much more than the historian of\r\nthe Prussian State, he is the champion of its ideals. Much better than\r\nBismarck, or the Kaiser, or than the \"Clown Prince,\" he makes clear to\r\nus the aims and the aspirations of the Hohenzollern monarchy and of\r\nthe German nation.\r\n\r\nIn the history of literature and thought it is given to but very few\r\nwriters thus to become the spokesmen of a whole people. To achieve\r\nsuch importance a writer must possess many qualifications. He must\r\npossess a strong and dominating character. He must be a great literary\r\nartist. He must be a clear, a bold, and an independent thinker. The\r\nfollowing pages will show in how eminent a degree Treitschke possessed\r\nall those qualities and how unreservedly they were placed at the\r\nservice of the Prussian cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--TREITSCHKE'S PERSONALITY.\r\n\r\nThe first quality which challenges attention is the commanding\r\nstrength of his personality. He combines the most contradictory gifts:\r\nthe temperament of the artist, the imagination of the poet, the\r\ninspiring faith of the idealist, the practical sense of the realist,\r\nand the enthusiasm of the apostle. He always impresses you with that\r\nmagnetic sense of power into which Carlyle impresses his readers. Like\r\nCarlyle, he is a firm believer in the heroic, and he has himself the\r\ntemper of a hero. Three of his volumes of essays bear the significant\r\ntitle, \"Deutsche Kämpfe\" (\"German Battles\"). All through his career\r\nTreitschke has been fighting his patriotic battles. Obsessed by his\r\nideals, he always has the courage of his convictions, and is always\r\nready to suffer for them. In his early youth he had a painful quarrel\r\nwith his father, a Saxon General and a loyal servant of the Saxon\r\ndynasty, because the son would not refrain from his attacks on Saxon\r\n\"particularism\" and would not abstain from championing the Prussian\r\ncause. Treitschke never evades a difficulty. He is never swayed by\r\noutside influences. He never dreads contradiction. When facts do not\r\ntally with his favourite theories, he brushes them away. And he never\r\naccepts any compromise. He is all made of one piece. He has the\r\nhardness of granite. He has never been afraid of unpopularity. He has\r\nalways been a loyal friend and an equally staunch hater.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--TREITSCHKE AS A WRITER.\r\n\r\n\"Le style est l'homme.\" Never was Buffon's dictum more strikingly\r\nverified, and never did any literary style reveal so completely the\r\npersonality of the man. Treitschke's style is imperious and\r\naggressive. It has the ring of the General who gives the word of\r\ncommand. His sentences are not involved, as German sentences generally\r\nare. They are pregnant and concise. Treitschke often reminds one of a\r\nwriter whom of all others he most cordially detests. Like Heine,\r\nTreitschke is incisive, epigrammatic. His phrase has always muscle and\r\nnerve: it has warmth and fervour. Treitschke has not the gift of\r\nhumour. A German seldom possesses that redeeming gift. But he wields\r\nthe weapon of trenchant irony with terrible force, and he adds the\r\npoet's power of vision and the true historian's sense of reality and\r\nsense of individuality. He has Macaulay's gift of orderly narrative.\r\nHe is equally masterly in describing a battle scene, a meeting of\r\ndiplomatists, a revolutionary movement. His picture of the Congress of\r\nVienna is unsurpassed in historical literature. Like Saint-Simon, he\r\ncan sum up a character in a few lines. German historians are seldom\r\nskilful portrait-painters. Treitschke forms an exception. His\r\nportraits of Talleyrand, of Metternich, of Tsar Alexander I., of\r\nLeopold I., King of the Belgians, are masterpieces of the literary\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--TREITSCHKE AS A CLEAR AND ORIGINAL THINKER.\r\n\r\nBut all those artistic gifts would not have given him his commanding\r\ninfluence in the world of practical politics if he had not added the\r\ngifts of clear thinking and luminous exposition, which are so very\r\nrare in Germany. Treitschke is essentially an honest and systematic\r\nthinker. As Professor of History in the University of Berlin, he was\r\naccustomed to make intricate and abstract subjects interesting and\r\nintelligible to vast audiences of students. We are never left in any\r\ndoubt as to his inner meaning. He always goes straight to the point.\r\nThere are no equivocations or mental reservations. He has the brevity\r\nbut none of the ambiguity of the lawgiver. There are no gaps in his\r\nreasoning. He moves from one point to another in orderly sequence. Our\r\nintellectual and artistic joy in following the severe and simple\r\noutline of his political system is only marred by the thought of the\r\nappalling practical consequences of those doctrines.\r\n\r\nAnd not only is he a clear thinker. He is also an original and\r\nindependent thinker. He has not the professional taint of the German\r\npedant. He has the German professor's minute knowledge of concrete\r\nfacts, and his doctrinaire love of abstract principles, but he is not\r\na mere scholar and teacher. He always remains the man of the world,\r\nand he brings to the consideration of historical problems the\r\npractical experience which he gained as a journalist and as a member\r\nof the Reichstag. He does not apply any conventional standards to his\r\njudgments of men and events. He looks at everything from his own\r\nangle. There is a delightful freshness about everything he writes. He\r\nbelieves that the first duty of an historian is to be partial. He\r\nalways follows a bias, but it is his own bias. In his German history\r\nhe has not been content with digging up thousands of new facts from\r\nthe recesses of German records; he gives his own interpretation to the\r\nfacts. He has no respect for established fame, for existing theories.\r\nHe delights in shocking his readers. In his \"Götzendämmerung,\" or\r\n\"Twilight of the Gods,\" Nietzsche has shown us how to \"philosophize\r\nwith a hammer.\" Treitschke has written history with a hammer, and all\r\nhis writings are strewn with the fragments of broken idols and\r\nshattered reputations.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--THE PRUSSIAN STATE THE CENTRE OF TREITSCHKE'S LITERARY ACTIVITIES.\r\n\r\nAll Treitschke's activities have centred round one subject: the\r\nhistory and policy of the Prussian State. All his loyalties are given\r\nto one cause, the supremacy of the German Empire led by the Prussian\r\nState. He has been a voluminous writer, and he has written on the most\r\nvaried subjects. But all those subjects have only been taken up with\r\nthe one object of elucidating Prussian problems and directing Prussian\r\npolicy. His studies on Federalism, on the United Netherlands--by far\r\nthe most suggestive survey of Dutch history which has so far been\r\nattempted--are intended to solve the problem of the relation of\r\nPrussia to the Federal States of the German Empire. His study on\r\nCavour and Italian unity was undertaken as an introduction to the\r\nstudy of German unity. His admirable monograph on that strange and\r\nunique military theocracy of the Teutonic order was an essay on the\r\nearly history of Prussia. His volume on Bonapartism was a study of the\r\nchief political opponent of Prussian supremacy. Briefly, all his\r\nvolumes of essays have been preparatory to his life-work, the history\r\nof Germany, and the history of Germany itself is always kept\r\nsubordinate to the history of the Prussian State.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--TREITSCHKE'S TREATISE ON POLITICS.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted that the British public should have been\r\nfirst introduced to Treitschke's \"History of Germany.\" The \"History of\r\nGermany\" is, no doubt, the most important and the most monumental,\r\nbut it is by no means the most interesting nor the most significant of\r\nTreitschke's writings. German history could never be as arresting to a\r\nContinental student as British or French history. It is not mixed up\r\nwith universal events. It is too parochial. It does not evoke human\r\nsympathy. With all the magic of Treitschke's art, we feel that we are\r\nfollowing, not the great highway, but one of the by-ways of history.\r\nWe cannot get absorbed in the petty quarrels of the princelings of the\r\nGerman Federation. Of the five volumes of Treitschke's \"German\r\nHistory,\" the only part which is of general interest is the first\r\nvolume, dealing with the rise of Prussia, the reign of Frederick the\r\nGreat and his successors, the Napoleonic wars, and the Congress of\r\nVienna.\r\n\r\nAs often happens, it is mainly through his minor writings that\r\nTreitschke will live--through his \"Cavour,\" his \"United Netherlands,\"\r\nhis \"Bonapartism,\" and his Biographical Essays. But to the\r\nphilosophical student by far the most important of Treitschke's\r\nwritings are his two volumes on the Science of Politics, which are,\r\nwithout exception, the most fascinating and the most suggestive\r\npolitical treatise published in this generation. Political treatises\r\nare proverbially dull and out of touch with reality. Treitschke's\r\ntreatise is a solitary exception. To him politics are not, like\r\nmathematics, an abstract or a deductive science. We cannot build an\r\nideal political structure in the air. The political thinker must be\r\nmore modest in his ambitions. He cannot adduce first principles. All\r\npolitics must be _Realpolitik_. All politics must be based on\r\nconcrete historical facts--_i.e._, circumscribed in time and space.\r\nIndeed, strictly considered, political philosophy is only applied\r\nhistory. That is why political treatises are so disappointing. The\r\nphilosopher is content to generalize, and does not know the facts. On\r\nthe other hand, the historian who knows the facts has not the capacity\r\nof generalization. Politics must be mainly empirical. The political\r\nthinker does not reason forward from the past to the present, but\r\nbackwards from the present to the past. He studies the present results\r\nof the mature experience of many ages, and then explains the distant\r\npast in the light of the present.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--PRUSSIA THE SOLE STANDARD OF POLITICAL VALUES.\r\n\r\nNot only has Prussian history been the centre of all Treitschke's\r\nactivities; it also supplies him with the sole standard of all\r\npolitical values, the sole test of the truth of all political\r\ntheories. With superb logic he deduces all his political system from\r\nthe vicissitudes of the Brandenburg State. His sympathies and\r\nantipathies, his affinities and repulsions, are Prussian. Prussia and\r\nthe German Empire have monopolized all human virtues. His only enemies\r\nare the enemies of the Prussian State (see paragraphs VIII. and IX. of\r\nthis Essay).\r\n\r\nPrussia is a national State, exclusive, self-sufficient,\r\nself-contained. Therefore, the national State is the supreme and final\r\npolitical reality (see paragraph XI.).\r\n\r\nAll the theories which challenge or threaten this conception of the\r\nnational State are dismissed by Treitschke as damnable heresies: the\r\nheresy of individualism (see paragraph XII.), the heresy of\r\ninternationalism (see paragraph XIII.), and the heresy of imperialism\r\n(paragraph XIV.).\r\n\r\nThe one aim of the Prussian State has been the extension of Prussian\r\npower. Therefore the will to power must be the fundamental dogma of\r\nthe State (paragraph XV.).\r\n\r\nPrussia has always subordinated political ethics to national\r\naggrandizement; therefore Treitschke holds with Machiavelli that in\r\npolitics the end justifies the means (paragraph XVI.).\r\n\r\nPrussia has only expanded through war. War has been the national\r\nindustry of the Prussian people. Therefore war is considered by\r\nTreitschke as the vital principle of national life (paragraph XVII.).\r\n\r\nPrussia has been the family estate of the Hohenzollern dynasty;\r\ntherefore the monarchy must be considered as the ideal form of\r\ngovernment (paragraph XVIII.).\r\n\r\nThe Prussian military aristocracy of Junkers have been the mainstay of\r\nthe Prussian State; therefore an aristocratic government is a\r\ncorollary of the monarchic form of government, and the French\r\ndemocratic theory of government is the arch-heresy (paragraphs XIX.\r\nand XX.).\r\n\r\nPrussia has been the leading Protestant State; therefore Roman\r\nCatholicism must be held to be inconsistent with the prosperity of any\r\nmodern polity (paragraph XXI.).\r\n\r\nPrussia, from a small straggling territory, has grown to be one of the\r\nleading Powers of Europe by the gradual absorption of all the\r\nsurrounding small States; therefore only great Powers have a right to\r\nexist (paragraph XXII.); therefore small States are a monstrosity\r\n(paragraph XXIII.).\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--TREITSCHKE'S POLITICAL PAGANISM.\r\n\r\nThere is no counterpart in modern history to the development of the\r\nPrussian State, no political structure so entirely self-contained and\r\nself-sufficient, which has so continuously pursued its own selfish\r\nends. For an exact analogy it is necessary to revert to ancient\r\nhistory; therefore Treitschke's sympathies go to the ancient State\r\nmuch more than to the modern State. In his religion he is a devout\r\nLutheran. But in his political conceptions he is entirely pagan. To\r\nhim the politics of Aristotle remain the fountain of all political\r\nwisdom. The modern man in order to understand the majesty of the State\r\nmust free himself of a whole mass of acquired notions. In quiet and\r\npeaceful times the average man may pursue his private avocations and\r\nhardly give a thought to the State. It was different in antiquity. The\r\nancient city State was everything, and was felt to be everything, so\r\nthat the citizen could not conceive himself as apart from the State.\r\nThat is why they had a much stronger and healthier political sense, an\r\ninstinctive comprehension for, and a passionate devotion to, the\r\nState. The moderns have ceased to live and move in the State. They are\r\ndivided and distracted by their social and economic interests. Only\r\nthe modern Prussian feels for Prussia as the Roman and the Spartan\r\nfelt for their native countries. To the Prussian alone, as to the\r\nRoman and the Spartan, the devotion to the State is glorified into a\r\nreligion, the religion of patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--TREITSCHKE'S ANTIPATHIES AND HATREDS.\r\n\r\nEven as his sympathies, so are Treitschke's antipathies determined by\r\nhis Prussian preconceptions. Whatever is alien to Prussian ideals is\r\nodious to Treitschke. Whoever has opposed the growth of the Prussian\r\nState or threatened its future becomes a personal enemy. And, as every\r\nState has had to oppose the predatory policy of Prussia, and is\r\nthreatened by its ambitions, as, to use Treitschke's own words,\r\n\"Prussia was the best hated of all the German States from the first\r\ndays of her independent history,\" the antipathies of the Prussian\r\nhistorian are almost universal. And what a fierce hater he is; what\r\nunlimited power of vituperation; what intensity of bitter feeling! He\r\nhates Talleyrand, Lord Palmerston, King Leopold of Belgium, with a\r\npersonal animosity. He hates Britain and France. He hates Austria and\r\nthe small German Principalities. He hates Belgium and Holland; and,\r\nabove all, he loathes and despises the Jews.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--TREITSCHKE'S HATRED OF THE JEWS.\r\n\r\nNo nation inspires Treitschke with a more instinctive repulsion than\r\nthe Jews. He may be called the father of scientific and pedantic\r\nanti-Semitism. In other nations anti-Semitism was only an instinctive\r\nand irrational popular feeling. In Treitschke anti-Semitism becomes a\r\nsystematic doctrine. It becomes part of a political creed. Treitschke\r\nhates the Jews because they are unwarlike, because they are absorbed\r\nin material interests, because they are Atheists. He abhors the Gospel\r\naccording to Saint Marx. He denounces the cynicism of Heine. He dreads\r\nthe influence of the Jewish Press. But, above all, he hates the Jews\r\nbecause they are denationalized, because they have no stake in the\r\nprosperity and greatness of the national State. The Jews are wanderers\r\nwithout a settled existence, without allegiance and loyalty except to\r\ntheir own race. The dual political life which the Jews are leading as\r\nmembers of the Jewish nation and as parasites of other national States\r\nto which they have temporarily migrated is a permanent menace to a\r\nhealthy national German life. Everywhere the Jews are revolutionists,\r\nanarchists, Atheists. All the leaders of the German Social\r\nDemocracy--Lassalle, Marx, Engels, Kautsky, Bernstein--are Hebrews. It\r\nis the imperative duty of all Prussian patriots to guard the people\r\nagainst the Jewish danger, against Jewish journalism, Jewish finance,\r\nJewish materialism, Jewish socialism, and Jewish internationalism.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--THE THEORY OF THE NATIONAL STATE.\r\n\r\nLet us revert to the starting-point of Treitschke's politics, which is\r\nthe theory of the national State. Only in the national State can the\r\nindividual realize the higher moral and political life. The State is\r\nnot part of a larger whole. It is in itself a self-contained whole. It\r\nis not a means to an end; it is an end in itself. It is not a\r\nrelative conception; it is an absolute. The French people may fight\r\nfor humanity. A St. Louis may be inspired with the crusading spirit.\r\nTreitschke has no sympathy for such quixotism. The national State must\r\nbe selfish. To be unselfish is the mortal sin of politics. Humanity,\r\nsentimentalism, have no place in politics. Frederick William IV., the\r\none sentimental King in the whole history of the Hohenzollern Dynasty,\r\nonce rendered an unselfish service to his neighbours. A Prussian army\r\nsaved the Saxon monarchy from revolution and then withdrew. Treitschke\r\nhas no words strong enough to condemn this solitary instance of a\r\ndisinterested Prussian policy.\r\n\r\nThe national State is alone invested with the attributes of\r\nsovereignty. There is nothing above it. National rights must be final.\r\nThe national State may for the time being limit its absolute\r\nsovereignty by international agreements, but any such agreements are\r\nonly conditional and temporary--_rebus sic stantibus_. No national\r\nState can make international agreements which are binding for the\r\nfuture. The time must always come when the scrap of paper has to be\r\ntorn asunder. It is true that the national State is indirectly playing\r\nits part in the moral education of humanity, but it will best serve\r\nhumanity by only thinking of itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.--THE HERESY OF INDIVIDUALISM.\r\n\r\nThere are many heresies which threaten the orthodox religion of the\r\nnational State. The first and the most dangerous is the heresy of\r\nindividualism. A school of modern theorists, William von Humboldt and\r\nJohn Stuart Mill, have asserted the rights of the individual apart\r\nfrom and above the rights of the State. They reserve for the\r\nindividual a sphere where the State may not encroach. According to\r\nMill, the political life is only a part and the minor part of his\r\nsocial activities. His higher activities are spent in the service of\r\nthe Church, in the service of Art and Science.\r\n\r\nTreitschke has fought this heresy of individualism in all his\r\nwritings. The interest of the individual cannot be opposed to the\r\ninterest of the State. The individual can only realize himself, he can\r\nonly realize the higher life, in and through the State. It is the\r\nState which sets free the spiritual forces of the individual by\r\nsecuring for him security, prosperity, and economic independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.--THE HERESY OF INTERNATIONALISM.\r\n\r\nThe second deadly heresy which threatens the dogma of the national\r\nState is the heresy of internationalism. It takes the form either of\r\nthe black internationalism of the Catholic Church or the red\r\ninternationalism of Social Democracy. Treitschke has fought Roman\r\nCatholicism and its champions, the Jesuits, with relentless hate.\r\nThrough all his writings there sounds the watchword of Voltaire, the\r\nspiritual adviser of Frederick the Great, \"Écrasez l'infâme,\" and the\r\nbattle-cry of Gambetta, \"Le clericalisme, voilà l'ennemi.\" Nor is he\r\nless bitter against the Socialists. Bismarck and the Kaiser opposed\r\nthe encroachments of the Social Democracy in a succession of\r\nanti-Socialist repressive measures. Treitschke may have disapproved of\r\nsome of the _Sozialisten Gesetze_ because they defeated their purpose.\r\nBut he shares the Kaiser's hatred against those irreconcilable enemies\r\nof Prussian greatness. The Social Democratic theories of the\r\nJews--Lassalle, Marx, and Bernstein--are one of the most deadly\r\npoisons that imperil the constitution of the German body politic.\r\n\r\nEvents have shown how little even Treitschke realized the strength of\r\nthe Prussian State and the fanaticism of German nationalism. We know\r\nhow little his dread of the black International of Catholicism and the\r\nred International of Socialism has been justified by the servile\r\nattitude of all the Opposition parties, and how, when the crisis came,\r\nboth Catholics and Socialists proved as Prussian as the Junkers of\r\nPomerania.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.--THE HERESY OF IMPERIALISM.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the citizen can only realize himself through the\r\nnational State, if the whole course of human history is essentially a\r\nconflict of national States, and if the rich variety of civilization\r\nis made up of the rivalry of those national States, it logically\r\nfollows that the expansion of any national State into a world empire\r\nmust necessarily be baneful. The State must, no doubt, expand, but\r\nthere is a limit to that expansion. The State must not incorporate any\r\nalien races which it cannot assimilate. When the State is unable to\r\nabsorb heterogeneous elements and grows into a world empire, it\r\nbecomes a danger both to itself and to humanity.\r\n\r\nCivilization has been threatened in the past by such monstrous\r\nconglomerates of heterogeneous nations. It has been threatened by the\r\nSpanish tyranny of Charles V. and the French tyranny of Louis XIV. and\r\nNapoleon. It is still threatened to-day by a similar danger. Two\r\nnational States, Great Britain and Russia, have again grown into world\r\nempires. If their ambitions were to succeed, if the greater part of\r\nthe civilized world were to become either Anglo-Saxon or Russian,\r\nthere would be an end to the diversity and the liberty of modern\r\ncivilization. Only the good sword of Prussia and Germany can save\r\nhumanity from that Anglo-Saxon and Slav peril.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.--THE DOGMA OF THE \"WILL TO POWER.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fact that there is danger in the unlimited expansion of the\r\nnational State ought not to prevent us from recognizing that\r\nirresistible tendency to expansion. The \"will to power\" is the essence\r\nof the State. \"The State is power\" (_Der Staat ist Macht_) must ever\r\nbe the first axiom of political science. Muddled political thinkers,\r\nwho confuse the spiritual with the temporal activities of man, may\r\nhold that the end of the State is social justice, or the diffusion of\r\nlight, or the propagation of religion, or the advancement of humanity.\r\nBut the cause of justice, the spread of education, will best be\r\nfurthered if the State is strong. Only the strong can be just,\r\npartial, and enlightened. The sole criterion of political values is\r\nstrength. It is the supreme merit of Machiavelli that he has been the\r\nfirst to emphasize this cardinal truth. The mortal sin of a State is\r\nto be weak. Only the strong man, only a Bismarck, a Richelieu, a\r\nCavour, is a true statesman.\r\n\r\nAnd that strength of the State which is its chief attribute must not\r\nbe dispersed; that political power must neither be divided nor\r\nalienated. Many writers on politics still echo the absurd theory of\r\nMontesquieu on the division of the executive, legislative, and the\r\njudiciary. Treitschke, following Rousseau, lays down the axiom that\r\nthe power of the State is indivisible and inalienable.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.--THE END JUSTIFIES THE MEANS.\r\n\r\nIf the one virtue of the State is to be strong and to assert its\r\nstrength, it follows that the ethics of the State cannot be the ethics\r\nof the individual. The ruler of the State is not the head of a\r\nmonastery or the president of an academy of fine arts. The end must\r\njustify the means, and any means may be employed which will add to the\r\nstrength of the State. It is the glory of Frederick the Great that he\r\nhas always had the moral courage of brushing away conventions and\r\nscruples to achieve his object, and that he has always had the\r\npolitical insight and wisdom of adjusting the means to the end.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.--WAR AS THE VITAL PRINCIPLE OF POLITICAL LIFE.\r\n\r\nPrussia is not, like France, the result of a thousand years of natural\r\ngrowth. It has no definite natural boundaries. The Prussian State is\r\nan artificial creation. It has grown and expanded through conquest.\r\nIt is the Order of the Teutonic Knights, it is the warrior dynasty of\r\nthe Hohenzollern, who have built up Prussian power. That purely\r\nmilitary growth of the Prussian State is made by Treitschke into a\r\nuniversal rule of all political growth. According to him war always\r\nwas and will remain the master-builder of national life. Other\r\nthinkers, like Joseph de Maistre, have glorified war in the name of\r\ntheology. Treitschke extols it in the name of politics. War not only\r\nmakes a State: it makes the citizen. The heroic virtues are warlike\r\nvirtues; they are the outcome of military institutions. It is not war\r\nbut peace which is the evil. Woe to the nation which allows itself to\r\nbe deceived by the sentiment and cowardice of pacifists.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.--THE MONARCHY AS THE IDEAL FORM OF GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\nWar is the essential activity of the State. But in order to be strong\r\nin war, unity and concentration are essential; they are the conditions\r\nof victory. That unity may, no doubt, be achieved under any form of\r\ngovernment. It may be achieved under a republic, as it was during the\r\nwars of the French Revolution. It may be achieved under an\r\naristocracy, as in the case of Great Britain, which is a monarchy only\r\nin name, which, in reality, is a Parliamentary oligarchy, and which is\r\nalways waging some guerilla in some outlying post of empire. But the\r\nfact remains that unity can be best achieved under a monarchic form of\r\ngovernment, which concentrates all powers into the hands of the\r\nresponsible monarch. That is why monarchy is the best form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.--THE ARISTOCRACY AS THE MAINSTAY OF THE MONARCHIC STATE.\r\n\r\nA loyal military aristocracy like the Junkers is the mainstay of a\r\nnational monarchy. An aristocratic constitution of the State is in\r\nconformity with the nature of things. Not only all military activities\r\nbut all social and economic life depends on the distinction of\r\nclasses, on the existence of different grades corresponding to a\r\ndifference in natural endowment, in social service. The equality of\r\nman not only is an unattainable ideal, it is also an undesirable and a\r\nmischievous ideal. Suppress inequality and distinctions and honours\r\nand you suppress the main stimulus of human endeavour; you suppress\r\nthat rich differentiation of social life, that generous rivalry, that\r\nnoble ambition, which are the conditions of all intensive human\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.--THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY DOGMA OF EQUALITY.\r\n\r\nThe greatest danger, therefore, to the monarchic and aristocratic\r\nconstitution of the State arises from the insidious advance of the\r\nFrench revolutionary dogma of equality. The spirit of envy is\r\nundermining the social hierarchy in every country. That mean spirit of\r\ndemocratic envy is as old as the democratic institution itself.\r\nOstracism in the nobler elements of the community is as characteristic\r\nof the Greek democracy as of the French. All democracies have resented\r\nthat Aristides should be called the \"Just.\" So far it is only the\r\nPrussian State which has escaped from the poisonous doctrine of\r\nRousseau. But even in Prussia the progress of the Gospel according to\r\nSaint Marx is a disquieting symptom. To defend the prerogatives of the\r\nJunkers against the assaults of the Social Democracy must therefore be\r\none of the main political concerns of a patriotic Prussian.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.--THE PLEA FOR PROTESTANTISM.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that Protestantism is so closely identified with modern\r\nGerman history that it may almost be considered as the Germanic form\r\nof Christianity. Certainly Prussia is an essentially Protestant State.\r\nFrom the beginning it has grown from the secularization of Church\r\nproperty, when a Hohenzollern Grand Master, following the advice of\r\nLuther, took the bold step of confiscating the demesnes of the\r\nTeutonic Order. But it is not only Prussia that has grown and\r\nprospered through Protestantism. The Protestant form of Christianity\r\nin whatever form is essential to the very existence of the modern\r\nState. For no State can exist unless the spiritual power be\r\nsubordinated to the temporal power. The Protestant Church must needs\r\naccept that subordination because Protestantism must necessarily\r\nresult in a diversity of rival and powerless sects, and therefore, if\r\nit be true that Protestantism is necessary for the State, the State is\r\neven more necessary to Protestantism. The old dictum, _Cujus regio,\r\nillius religio_, holds good of Prussia. The spiritual allegiance\r\nfollows the temporal allegiance. The State alone can secure for those\r\ndifferent Churches that peace and toleration without which religious\r\nwar becomes a chronic evil. Toleration and the peaceful coexistence\r\nof many Churches under the protection of the State have been for\r\ncenturies the boast and glory of the Prussian State.\r\n\r\nCatholicism does not accept that necessary subordination. The German\r\nState of the Middle Ages, the Holy Roman Empire of the Hohenstaufen,\r\nperished because of the conflict with the Papacy. The modern Teutonic\r\nState, the Holy German Empire of the Habsburg, has equally perished\r\nthrough clericalism. Catholicism is an international power, and the\r\nState must be national. Catholicism is encroaching and threatening the\r\nnational State, and the State must remain independent and supreme;\r\ntherefore Catholicism, ultramontanism, clericalism, are absolutely\r\nincompatible with the modern State.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.--THE NECESSITY OF GREAT POWERS.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as power is the main attribute of the State, it follows that\r\nonly those States which are sufficiently strong in population, in\r\nterritory, and in financial resources, have a right to exist. There is\r\na definite limit below which a State cannot fulfil its mission nor\r\ndefend its existence. We must not be deceived by the example of such\r\nStates as Athens, Venice, Holland, and Florence, which, although\r\napparently small in territory, yet played an important part in\r\npolitical history. Those States were only small in outward appearance;\r\nin reality they were either the centres of a vast political system,\r\nlike Athens and Florence, or the centres of a vast colonial empire,\r\nlike Venice and Holland. Moreover, in modern times, the whole\r\nrelations and proportions of States have undergone a fundamental\r\nchange. Everything is on a larger scale, and there is an almost\r\ngeneral tendency in modern times for all national States to expand and\r\nto absorb into themselves the smaller neighbouring States. It may\r\nalmost be said that modern history is made up mainly of the conflicts\r\nbetween five or six leading States. Contemporary Europe had resulted\r\nin the unstable equilibrium of the five dominant Powers of Britain,\r\nRussia, Austria, France, and Germany. Europe has almost consolidated\r\ninto a pentarchy.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.--THE ANOMALY OF THE SMALL STATE.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that the national State almost inevitably must develop\r\ninto a great Power, conversely it is no less true that small States\r\nare an anomaly. Treitschke never ceased to rail at the monstrosity of\r\npetty States, at what he calls, with supreme contempt, the\r\n\"_Kleinstaaterei_.\" Holland, Denmark, Switzerland, are not really\r\nStates. They are only artificial and temporary structures. Holland\r\nwill one day be merged into the German Empire and recover its pristine\r\nglory.\r\n\r\nThe smallness of the State produces a corresponding meanness of\r\nspirit, a narrowness of outlook. Small States are entirely absorbed by\r\ntheir petty economic interests and party dissensions. They only exist\r\nas the parasites of the larger States, who ensure their prosperity and\r\nsecurity and bear all the brunt of maintaining law and order in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nBut worse even than the small States is the neutral State. A neutral\r\nState in political life is as much a monstrosity as a neutral sexless\r\nanimal in the natural world. A State like Belgium is only the parasite\r\nof the larger neighbouring States. Treitschke never mentions Belgium\r\nwithout an outburst of contempt. The country of Memlinck and van Eyck,\r\nof Rubens and van Dyck, the country whose people in the present war\r\nhave borne the first onslaught of all the Teutonic hosts, are never\r\nmentioned by Treitschke except with a sneer.\r\n\r\nIn no other part of his political system does Treitschke show more\r\nsublime disregard of all those political facts which do not fit in\r\nwith his theories. No other part more conclusively proves how the\r\ntyrannical dogma of Prussian nationalism can blind even a profound and\r\nclear-sighted thinker to the most vital historical realities. It must\r\nbe apparent _a priori_ to any student of politics that the life of\r\nsmall communities must gain in concentration and intensity what it\r\nloses in scope and extent. And it must be obvious that small States\r\nhave played a much more conspicuous part than the most powerful\r\nempires. The city of Dante, Machiavelli, Michael Angelo, has done more\r\nfor culture than all the might and majesty of the Hohenzollern.\r\nHumanity is indebted to one small State--Palestine--for its religion.\r\nTo another small State--Greece--humanity owes the beginning of all art\r\nand the foundations of politics. To other small States--Holland and\r\nScotland--modern Europe is indebted for its political freedom. And are\r\nnot the German people themselves indebted for the glories of their\r\nliterature to the contemptible cities of Jena and Weimar?\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\nWe have explained the main tenets of the Treitschkean creed. Even\r\nafter this exhaustive analysis it will be difficult for an English\r\nreader to understand how such a system, if we divest it of its\r\nrhetoric, of its fervid and impassioned style, and of a wealth of\r\nhistorical illustration, which has been able to ransack every country\r\nand every age, could ever have inspired a policy and could have\r\nhypnotized so completely a highly intelligent and gifted race.\r\n\r\nOur incomprehension is partly due to that strange disbelief in the\r\npower of ideas to which we already referred, which remains such a\r\nmarked trait of the British people, even as it was a marked trait of\r\nthe Roman people, and which is perhaps characteristic of all nations\r\nwho are pre-eminent in action, in colonization and empire-building.\r\nThis disbelief partly explains why we have revealed such strange\r\nimpotence in fighting our spiritual battles. Our Churches have\r\nremained silent and inarticulate. Our statesmen have seldom risen\r\nabove sentimental platitudes. No trumpet voice has vindicated our\r\nideas to the world. Our writers, with a few notable exceptions, such\r\nas Mr. Gilbert Chesterton and Mr. Wells, have seldom risen above trite\r\ntruisms. This war has not even produced a masterpiece such as Burke's\r\n\"Thoughts on the French Revolution.\"\r\n\r\nBut our incomprehension is due even more to our ignorance of the\r\nstrange and devious workings of the German mind. Even to-day few\r\nauthors understand the reasons which render the German people so\r\nresponsive and so docile to the most extravagant doctrines and\r\nsystems. The British are a political people; and a political people\r\nonly accepts theories in so far as they can be verified, interpreted,\r\nand corrected by experience, only in so far as they can be tested by\r\nthe fire of discussion. The German people, as even Prince von Bülow is\r\ncompelled to admit, have remained an essentially unpolitical people. They\r\nstill are under the yoke of countless princelings. There still exist\r\nsovereign potentates of Lippe and Waldeck, of Schwarzburg-Sondershausen\r\nand Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. The Germans have acquired none of the\r\nhabits and traditions of free government. But, most important of all,\r\ntheir religion has acted in the same direction as their politics. They\r\nare described by Treitschke as the typical Protestant nation; but the\r\nmisfortune of German Protestantism has been that it has never\r\n\"protested.\" Through the fusion and confusion of Church and State the\r\nGermans have sold their spiritual birthright for a mess of pottage.\r\nTheir spiritual life has been almost entirely divorced from action. It\r\nhas been centred in the intellect and in the emotions. It has moved in\r\na world of abstraction and dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd thus both their politics and their religion have made them a prey\r\nto visionaries and sentimentalists, to unscrupulous journalists like\r\nHarden and Reventlow, to unbalanced poets like Nietzsche, to political\r\nprofessors, and to fanatic doctrinaires. Of those academic politicians\r\nand fanatic doctrinaires, Treitschke has probably been the most\r\ndangerous and the most illustrious representative. He will ever\r\nremain a memorable example of the power for evil which may be wielded\r\nby a noble and passionate temperament untrained in and unrestrained by\r\nthe realities of political life, who sees the State from the altitude\r\nof the professional tripod. The war will have helped to break the\r\nspell of the political professor, but the spell will continue to act\r\nuntil all the spiritual forces of Germany, until the Press and the\r\nUniversities and the Churches, are emancipated from the intrusion of\r\nthe State, until the German democracy reveals both the spirit and\r\nconquers the power to achieve its own salvation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--GENERAL VON BERNHARDI.[15]\r\n\r\n    [15] These pages were published in 1912.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the deliberate military policy of a nation remains the\r\nsecret of diplomacy and the afterthought of statecraft. As for the\r\nmilitary feeling and the military spirit, so far as they exist amongst\r\nthe people, they generally remain subconscious, unreasoned, and\r\ninstinctive. It is therefore a piece of rare good fortune to the\r\nstudent of contemporary history when the designs of statesmen are\r\ncarefully thought out and revealed by one who has authority to speak,\r\nand when the instinct of the masses is explained and made explicit by\r\none who has the gift of lucid statement, of philosophical\r\ninterpretation, and psychological insight. It is precisely those\r\nqualities and characteristics that give importance and significance to\r\nthe recent book of General von Bernhardi on \"Germany and the Coming\r\nWar.\" The author is a distinguished representative of that Prussian\r\nJunkerthum which forms the mainstay of the military party and which\r\nrules the German Empire. He therefore speaks from the inside. And his\r\nprevious works have earned him a high reputation as an exponent of the\r\nscience of war, and have worthily maintained the traditions of\r\nClausewitz and von der Goltz. Nor are these the only qualifications of\r\nthe author. General von Bernhardi's new book possesses other qualities\r\nwhich entitle him to a respectful hearing. He writes with absolute\r\ncandour and sincerity; his tone is unexceptionable; he is earnest and\r\ndignified; he is moderate and temperate; he is judicial rather than\r\ncontroversial. Although the author believes, of course, that Germany\r\nstands in the forefront of civilization and has a monopoly of the\r\nhighest culture, yet his book is singularly free from the one great\r\nblemish which defaces most German books on international\r\npolitics--namely, systematic depreciation of the foreigner. Von\r\nBernhardi does not assume that France is played out or that England is\r\neffete. He is too well read in military history not to realize that to\r\nbelittle the strength or malign the character of an enemy is one of\r\nthe most fruitful causes of disaster.\r\n\r\nAltogether we could not have a better guide to the study of the\r\npresent international situation from the purely German point of view,\r\nnor could we find another book which gives us more undisguisedly the\r\n\"mentality,\" the prejudices and prejudgments and opinions of the\r\nruling classes. And it is a characteristically German trait that no\r\nless than one-third of the work should be given to the philosophy and\r\nethics of the subject. General von Bernhardi surveys the field from\r\nthe vantage-ground of first principles, and his book is a convincing\r\nproof of a truth which we have expressed elsewhere that in Prussia war\r\nis not looked upon as an accident, but as a law of nature; and not\r\nonly as a law of nature, but as the law of man, or if not as the law\r\nof man, certainly as the law of the \"German superman.\" It is not\r\nenough to say that war has been the national industry of Prussia. It\r\nforms an essential part of the philosophy of life, the _Weltanschauung_\r\nof every patriotic Prussian. Bernhardi believes in the morality, one\r\nmight almost say in the sanctity, of war. To him war is not a\r\nnecessary evil, but, on the contrary, the source of every moral good.\r\nTo him it is pacificism which is an immoral doctrine, because it is\r\nthe doctrine of the materialist, who believes that enjoyment is the\r\nchief end of life. It is the militarist who is the true idealist\r\nbecause he assumes that humanity can only achieve its mission through\r\nstruggle and strife, through sacrifice and heroism. It is true that\r\nBernhardi ignores the greatest of Prussian philosophers, whose\r\nimmortal plea in favour of perpetual peace is dismissed as the work of\r\nhis dotage. But if he dismisses Kant, he adduces instead a formidable\r\narray of thinkers and poets in support of his militarist thesis;\r\nSchiller and Goethe, Hegel and Heraclitus, in turn are summoned as\r\nauthorities. Even the Gospels are distorted to convey a militarist\r\nmeaning, for the author quotes them to remind us that it is the\r\nwarlike and not the meek that shall inherit the earth. But Bernhardi's\r\nchief authorities are the historian of the super-race, the Anglophobe\r\nTreitschke, and the philosopher of the superman, Nietzsche. Nine out\r\nof ten quotations are taken from the political treatises of the\r\nfamous Berlin professor, and the whole spirit of Bernhardi's book is\r\nsummed up in the motto borrowed from Zarathustra and inscribed on the\r\nfront page of the volume:\r\n\r\n\"War and courage have achieved more great things than the love of our\r\nneighbour. It is not your sympathy, but your bravery, which has\r\nhitherto saved the shipwrecked of existence.\r\n\r\n\"'What is good?' you ask. To be brave is good.\"[16]\r\n\r\n    [16] Nietzsche's \"Thus Spake Zarathustra,\" First Part, 10th\r\n    Speech.\r\n\r\nIt is no less characteristic of contemporary German political\r\nphilosophy that from beginning to end Bernhardi maintains consciously,\r\ndeliberately, a purely national attitude, and that he does not even\r\nattempt to rise to a higher and wider point of view. Indeed, the main\r\nissue and cardinal problem, the relation of nationality to humanity,\r\nthe conflict between the duties we owe to the one and the duties we\r\nowe to the other, is contemptuously relegated to a footnote (p. 19).\r\nTo Bernhardi a nation is not a means to an end, a necessary organ of\r\nuniversal humanity, and therefore subordinate to humanity. A nation is\r\nan end in itself. It is the ultimate reality. And the preservation and\r\nthe increase of the power of the State is the ultimate criterion of\r\nall right. \"My country, right or wrong,\" is the General's whole system\r\nof moral philosophy. Yet, curiously enough, Bernhardi speaks of\r\nGermany as the apostle, not only of a national culture, but of\r\nuniversal culture, as the champion of civilization, and he indulges in\r\nthe usual platitudes on this fertile subject. And he does not even\r\nrealize that in so doing he is guilty of a glaring contradiction; he\r\ndoes not realize that once he adopts this standpoint of universal\r\nculture, he introduces an argument and assumes a position which are\r\nabove and outside nationalism. For either the German nation is\r\nself-sufficient, and all culture is centred in and absorbed in\r\nGermany, in which case Prussian nationalism would be historically and\r\nphilosophically justified; or culture is something higher and more\r\ncomprehensive and less exclusive, in which case national aims must be\r\nestimated and appraised with reference to a higher aim, and a national\r\npolicy must be judged according as it furthers or runs counter to the\r\nuniversal ideals of humanity.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Bernhardi starts his survey of the international situation\r\nwith the axiom that Germany imperatively wants new markets for her\r\nindustry and new territory for her sixty-five millions of people. In\r\nso doing, he only reiterates the usual assumption of German political\r\nwriters. And he also resembles the majority of his fellow-publicists\r\nin this respect, that he does not tell us what exactly are the\r\nterritories that Germany covets, or how they are to be obtained, or\r\nhow the possession of tropical or subtropical colonies can solve the\r\nproblem of her population. But he differs from his predecessors in\r\nthat he clearly realizes and expresses, without ambiguity or\r\nequivocation, that the assertion of her claims must involve the\r\nestablishment of German supremacy, and he admits that those claims are\r\nincompatible with the antiquated doctrine of the balance of power.\r\nAnd von Bernhardi also clearly realizes that, as other nations will\r\nrefuse to accept German supremacy and to surrender those fertile\r\nterritories which Germany needs, German expansion can only be achieved\r\nas the result of a conflict--briefly, that war is unavoidable and\r\ninevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFREDERICK THE GREAT: THE FATHER OF PRUSSIAN MILITARISM\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many discoveries brought about by the war of the nations,\r\nan educated British public has suddenly discovered the unsuspected\r\nexistence of Heinrich von Treitschke. And not only have we discovered\r\nthe national Prussian historian--we have also unwittingly discovered\r\nPrussian history. We have certainly had revealed to us for the first\r\ntime its secret and hidden meaning. We are only just beginning to\r\nrealize that for nearly two hundred years it is Prussia, and not\r\nRussia, which has been the evil influence in European politics.\r\nPrussia has not been a natural political growth. She has been an\r\nartificial creation of statesmen. She has been pre-eminently the\r\npredatory State. She has never taken the sword to defend a\r\ndisinterested idea. The ravisher of Silesia, of Schleswig-Holstein, of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, the murderer of Poland, she has never expanded except\r\nat the expense of her neighbours. She has corrupted the German soul;\r\nshe has been the mainstay of reaction and militarism in Central\r\nEurope. She has been the bond of that freemasonry of despotism, of\r\nthat Triple Alliance of the three empires which subsisted until the\r\nfall of Bismarck, which has been for generations the nightmare of\r\nEuropean Liberals.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIn attempting to reread modern history in the light of that new\r\ninterpretation of Prussian history, we are naturally driven to ask\r\nourselves who is primarily responsible for that sinister influence\r\nwhich Prussia has exercised for the last two centuries. To the\r\nunprejudiced student there can be no doubt that the one man primarily\r\nresponsible is Frederick the Great, the master-builder of Prussian\r\nmilitarism and Prussian statecraft. He it is who has been poisoning\r\nthe wells; he it is who first conceived of the State as a barracks; he\r\nit is who has \"Potsdamized\" the Continent and transformed Europe into\r\na military camp. Strangely enough, all civilized nations to-day have\r\nproclaimed Prussia accursed. Yet we continue to hero-worship the man\r\nwho made Prussia what she is. A halo still surrounds the\r\nMephistophelian figure which incarnates the Hohenzollern spirit. A\r\nlegend has gathered round the philosopher of Sans Souci. A combination\r\nof circumstances has caused writers almost unanimously to extol his\r\nmerits and to ignore his crimes. British historians naturally favour\r\nthe ally of the Seven Years' War. Russian and Austrian writers are\r\nindulgent to the accomplice of the partition of Poland. Anti-clerical\r\nwriters glorify the Atheist. Military writers extol the soldier.\r\nPolitical writers extol the statesman. But the most adequate\r\nexplanation of the Frederician legend is the circumstance that public\r\nopinion has been systematically mobilized in favour of Frederick the\r\nGreat by the great French leaders of the eighteenth century, the\r\ndispensers of European fame.\r\n\r\nIt was not for nothing that Frederick the Great for forty years\r\ncourted the good graces of Voltaire d'Alembert. He knew full well that\r\nVoltaire would prove to him a most admirable publicity agent. And\r\nnever was publicity agent secured at a lower cost. Those literary\r\ninfluences have continued to our own day to perpetuate the legend of\r\nFrederick. Nearly a hundred years after Rossbach Frederick had the\r\nstrange good fortune to captivate the wayward genius of Carlyle. It is\r\ndifficult to understand how Carlyle, who all through life hesitated\r\nbetween the Christian Puritanism of John Knox and the Olympian\r\npaganism of Goethe, could have been fascinated by the Potsdam cynic.\r\nWe can only seek for an explanation in the deeply rooted anti-French\r\nand pro-German prejudices of Carlyle. Frederick was the arch-enemy of\r\nFrance, and that fact was sufficient to attract the sympathies of\r\nTeufelsdröckh. It is Carlyle's Gallophobia which has inspired one of\r\nthe most mischievous masterpieces of English literature.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy of European historians has thus attached greatness to\r\nthe very name of the third Hohenzollern King. Great the Hohenzollern\r\nKing certainly was, but his greatness is that of a Condottiere of the\r\nItalian Renascence, of a Catharine de' Medici. It is the greatness of\r\na personality who is endowed, no doubt, with magnificent gifts, but\r\nwho has prostituted all those gifts to the baser usages.\r\n\r\nIt is passing strange how every writer remains silent about the ugly\r\nand repellent side of Frederick. The son of a mad father, he was\r\nsubjected to a terrorism which would have predestined a less strong\r\nnature to the lunatic asylum. The terrorism only hardened Frederick\r\ninto an incurable cynic. It only killed in him every finer feeling.\r\nHis upbringing must almost inevitably have brought out all the darker\r\nsides of human nature.\r\n\r\nThe first twenty years of his life were one uninterrupted schooling in\r\nhypocrisy, brutality, and depravity. A debauchee in his youth, a\r\nsodomite in later life, a hater of women and a despiser of men, a\r\nbully to his subordinates, a monster of ingratitude, revelling in\r\nfilth so continuously in his written and spoken words that even a\r\nloyal Academy of Berlin has found it impossible to publish his\r\nunexpurgated correspondence, he appears an anachronism in a modern\r\nEurope leavened by two thousand years of Christianity. Ever scheming,\r\never plotting, ever seeking whom he might devour, deceiving even his\r\nintimate advisers, he has debased the currency of international\r\nmorality. As a man Frederick has been compared with Napoleon. The\r\ncomparison is an insult to the Corsican. Napoleon was human, he was\r\ncapable of strong affections, of profound attachment and gratitude.\r\nBut neither friendship nor love had any place in Frederick's scheme of\r\nthe universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are holding the poor Prussian professor mainly accountable\r\nfor the greatest and latest crime of Prussian militarism. But those\r\ndogmatic professors are only the abject disciples of the Hohenzollern\r\nKing. There is not one aphorism which is not to be found in the thirty\r\nvolumes of Frederick's writings. He has perfected the theory of the\r\nmilitary State, and he has acted consistently on the theory. It is\r\nhighly significant that his very first public act, almost never\r\nmentioned by his biographers, was his spoliation of the Prince-Bishop\r\nof Liége (an historical precedent tragically suggestive at the present\r\nday). The Prince-Bishop of Liége had committed the heinous crime of\r\nresisting the impressment of his subjects kidnapped by the recruiting\r\nsergeants of the Prussian King. On the strength of that theory,\r\nFrederick attacked the defenceless daughter of the Austrian Emperor\r\nwho had saved his life at Custrin. On the strength of that theory he\r\nbetrayed every one of his allies. On the strength of that theory he\r\ncommitted his most odious crime--he murdered the Polish nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nWe are told that Frederick the Great was an incomparable political\r\nvirtuoso. We are told that he showed heroic fortitude in disaster,\r\nafter Kollin and Kunersdorff. But so did Cæsar Borgia after the sudden\r\ndeath of Alexander VI. We are told that he was tolerant of all creeds.\r\nBut that was only because he disbelieved all creeds, and he believed,\r\nwith Gibbon, that \"all creeds are equally useful to the statesman.\" We\r\nare reminded that he was an amazing economist, husbanding and\r\ndeveloping the national finances. But his finances were only the\r\nsinews of war. We are told that he protected literature and art, but,\r\nlike religion, he found literature an instrument useful for his\r\npolitical designs. We are reminded that he was himself the servant of\r\nthe State. But in serving the State he only served his own interests,\r\nbecause the State was incarnated in himself, and in husbanding his\r\nresources he was only acting like a miser who is adding to his hoard.\r\nWe are finally told that as the result of his life-work Frederick\r\nsucceeded in creating the most marvellous military machine of modern\r\ntimes. We forget that, as is the way with most military machines, the\r\nPrussian machine ten years after Frederick's death had become a\r\npitiful wreck in the hands of his immediate successor, and that it\r\nrequired the genius of Bismarck to manufacture another Prussian\r\nmilitary machine to be used once more for the enslavement of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE APOTHEOSIS OF GOETHE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo less than three books on Goethe have been issued in the course of\r\nthe last few months, and the fact is sufficient evidence that the cult\r\nof the Olympian Jupiter of Weimar, which was first inaugurated eighty\r\nyears ago by Carlyle, is in no danger of dying out in England.\r\nProfessor Hume Brown has given us a penetrating and judicious study of\r\nGoethe's youth, such as one had a right to expect from the eminent\r\nScottish historian.[17] Mr. Joseph McCabe has given us a comprehensive\r\nsurvey of Goethe's life, and an objective and critical appreciation of\r\nhis personality.[18] Both are in profound sympathy with their subject,\r\nbut neither is a blind hero-worshipper. In Mr. McCabe's life we are\r\nnot only introduced to the scientist who is ever in quest of new\r\nworlds to conquer, we are also made acquainted with the pagan epicure\r\never engaged in amorous experiments! We are not only introduced to the\r\nsublime poet and prophet, we are also introduced to the incurable\r\negotist, who could only find time to visit his old mother once every\r\nten years, whilst, as boon companion of a petty German Prince, he\r\nalways found time for his pleasures. We are not only admitted to\r\ncontemplate the pomp and majesty of his world-wide fame, we are also\r\nadmitted to the sordid circumstances of Goethe's \"home.\" And our awe\r\nand reverence are turned into pity. We pity the miserable husband of a\r\ndrunken and epileptic wife rescued from the gutter; we pity even more\r\nthe unhappy father of a degraded son, who inherited all the vices of\r\none parent without inheriting the genius of the other.\r\n\r\n    [17] \"The Youth of Goethe.\" By P. Hume Brown. 8s. net\r\n    (Murray.)\r\n\r\n    [18] \"Goethe, the Man and his Character.\" By Joseph McCabe.\r\n    15s. net. (Eveleigh Nash.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe first quality which strikes us in Goethe, and which dazzled his\r\ncontemporaries, and continues to dazzle posterity, is his\r\nuniversality. He appears to us as one of the most receptive, one of\r\nthe most encyclopædic intellects of modern times. A scientist and a\r\nbiologist, a pioneer of the theory of evolution, a physicist and\r\noriginator of a new theory of colour, a man of affairs, a man of the\r\nworld and a courtier, a philosopher, a lyrical poet, a tragic, comic,\r\nsatiric, epic, and didactic poet, a novelist and an historian, he has\r\nattempted every form of literature, he has touched upon every chord of\r\nthe human soul.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, in considering this universality of Goethe, it\r\nbehoves us to make some qualifications. His human sympathies are by no\r\nmeans as universal as his intellectual sympathies. He has no love for\r\nthe common people. He has the aloofness of the aristocrat. He has a\r\nNietzschean contempt for the herd. He takes little interest in the\r\nreligious aspirations of mankind or in the struggles of human\r\nfreedom. The French Revolution remains to him a sealed book, and his\r\nhistory of the campaign in France is almost ludicrously disappointing.\r\n\r\nWith regard to what has been called his \"intellectual universality,\"\r\nthe elements which compose it cannot be reduced to unity and harmony.\r\nIt would be difficult to co-ordinate them into a higher synthesis, for\r\nthat _uni_versality is at the same time _di_versity and mutability.\r\nGoethe is essentially changeable and elusive. In his works we find\r\ncombined the antipodes of human thought. There is little in common\r\nbetween the poet of Goetz von Berlichingen and Werther on the one hand\r\nand the poet of Tasso and Iphigenia on the other hand. The intellect\r\nof Goethe is like a crystal with a thousand facets reflecting all the\r\ncolours of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nAnd it may well be asked, therefore, whether this encyclopædic\r\ndiversity can aptly be called universality. Universality must\r\nultimately result in unity and harmony, and it is impossible to assert\r\nthat Goethe's mind ever achieved unity and harmony, that it was ever\r\ncontrolled by one dominant thought.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, whether a defect or a quality, there can be no doubt that\r\nthis encyclopædic diversity has turned to the great advantage of his\r\nglory. It is precisely because Goethe is an elusive Proteus that all\r\ndoctrines may equally claim him. Romanticists turn with predilection\r\nto the creator of Werther or the first \"Faust.\" Classicists admire the\r\nplastic beauty of Tasso and Iphigenia. The cosmopolitan sees in Goethe\r\nthe _Weltbürger_, the citizen of the world, the incarnation of _die\r\nWeltweisheit_. The patriot acclaims in him the poet who has sung the\r\nmyths and legends dear to the German race. The sensuous and voluptuous\r\nlibertine is enchanted by the eroticism of the \"Roman Elegies.\" The\r\ndomesticated reader is drawn by that chaste idyll, Herman and\r\nDorothea. The Spinozist and Pantheist are attracted by the general\r\ntendencies of his philosophy. The Christian is at liberty to interpret\r\n\"Faust\" in a sense which is favourable to his religion. The Liberal\r\npolitician can point to the author of Goetz and Egmont. The\r\nConservative and Reactionary can claim all the works of Goethe's\r\nmaturity, when the poet had become the perfect courtier.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThere is a second quality which Goethe possesses in a supreme degree,\r\nand by which he is distinguished from his contemporaries--namely,\r\nmental sanity and serenity. Most of his fellow-poets reveal some\r\nmorbid characteristics, are afflicted with some _Weltschmerz_, with\r\nsome internal spiritual malady. They live in an atmosphere of strife\r\nand discord. The marvellous vitality of Goethe has escaped from the\r\ncontagion. Like his fellow-poets, he passed through the crisis of the\r\n_Sturm und Drang_. But it seems as if he had only known it in order to\r\ngive to his experiences a final artistic expression. He communicated\r\nthe \"Wertherian malady\" to a whole generation, but he himself emerged\r\ntriumphant and unscathed. The hurricane which wrecked so many powerful\r\nintellects spared his own. After the Italian journey he never ceased\r\nby example and precept to recommend harmony and balance, and he became\r\nso completely the perfect type of intellectual and artistic sanity\r\nthat the world has forgotten the Bohemian days of Frankfurt and\r\nLeipzig, the merry days of Weimar, the repulsive vulgarity of his\r\ndrunken mistress and wife, the degradation of his son, and has agreed\r\nonly to contemplate the Olympian majesty of Weimar. Whether the repose\r\nand sanity of Goethe were unmixed virtues, or whether they were partly\r\nthe result of indifference, of impassivity or selfishness, is another\r\nquestion. Certain it is that there is no other trait in Goethe's\r\npersonality which has done more to raise him in the esteem of\r\nposterity. He has proved to the world that internal discord and\r\ndistraction and morbid exaltation are not the necessary appanage of\r\ngenius, and that, on the contrary, the most powerful genius is also\r\nthe most sane, the most balanced, the most self-possessed, the most\r\nharmonious.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWithout going here into the purely formal and artistic qualities of\r\nGoethe's works, there is one fact which, perhaps more than any other,\r\nimpressed itself on the imagination of the world, and that is the\r\nrealization of his own personality, the achievement of his own\r\ndestiny. Of all his poems, the rarest and most perfect is the poem of\r\nhis life. Hitherto no such life had ever been allotted to a favourite\r\nof the Muses. He seemed to have received a bountiful abundance of all\r\nthe gifts of the fairies--superb health, comfort, and wealth, the love\r\nof an adoring mother and sister, the loyalty of illustrious friends,\r\nthe favour of Princes, the homage of women, and the admiration of\r\nmen. To him was opened every province of human activity. He exhausted\r\nevery form of enjoyment. His life until the end was like the unfolding\r\nof a glorious version of a happy dream. At eighty years of age he\r\nremained the one surviving giant of the golden age of German\r\nliterature. In his lifetime he was considered by Europe, as well as by\r\nGermany, as the most glorious exemplar of his race, and the city of\r\nhis adoption had become a pilgrimage attracting worshippers from all\r\nparts of Europe. Death was merciful to him. The last act of his life\r\nwas as beautiful as the others. It was not preceded by the gradual\r\ndissolution of his physical and intellectual strength; rather was it\r\nlike the burning out of a flame. He passed away in an apotheosis, and\r\nthe last words uttered by the dying poet, \"_Mehr Licht, mehr Licht_\"\r\n(More light, more light), have become for all future generations the\r\nfinal expression of his philosophy and the symbol of his personality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SERVICE OF THE CITY IN GERMANY[19]\r\n\r\n    [19] Written in 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAll English students interested in Germany owe a deep debt of\r\ngratitude to the unremitting labours of Mr. William Harbutt Dawson in\r\nthe fields of Teutonic scholarship. He is one of a gallant band of\r\nsome half-dozen publicists who, amidst universal neglect, have done\r\ntheir utmost to popularize amongst us a knowledge of German life and\r\nGerman people. Mr. Dawson's last book is certain to take rank as a\r\npolitical classic. It is a lucid exposition of \"Municipal Life and\r\nGovernment in Germany\" (Longmans and Co., 12s. 6d. net). City\r\nadministration and city regulations are a subject which no literary\r\nart can make very exciting, but, difficult and forbidding though it\r\nbe, it is a subject which yields in importance and interest to no\r\nother. There is certainly no other subject which will reveal to us\r\nmore of the secrets of German greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nFor the greatness of Germany is not to be explained by her unwieldy\r\narmy, her red-tape bureaucracy, her impotent Reichstag, her effete\r\nChurches. Her army, Parliament, and Churches are symptoms of weakness\r\nand not of strength. The true greatness of Germany is largely due to a\r\nfactor ignored by most writers, ignored even by Mr. Dawson in all his\r\nprevious works--namely, the excellence of German municipal\r\ninstitutions, the intensity of her civic life. We have been too much\r\naccustomed to think of Germany only as a despotic empire. She might be\r\nfar more fittingly described as a country of free institutions, a\r\nfederation of autonomous cities. We fondly imagine that ours is the\r\nonly country where self-government prevails. Readers who might still\r\nentertain this prejudice will carry away from Mr. Dawson's book the\r\nnovel political lesson that Germany, much more than Great Britain,\r\ndeserves to be called a self-governing nation, and that, at least in\r\nher civic government, which, after all, affects 70 per cent. of her\r\npopulation, Germany enjoys a measure of political liberty which is\r\nabsolutely unknown in our own country.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe tradition of municipal freedom in Germany is as old as German\r\nculture. It still lingers in the haunting charm of the German cities\r\nto-day. The Holy Roman Empire possessed only the trappings and the\r\nshadow of power; the reality belonged to the burghers of the towns.\r\nThe _Städtewesen_ gives its original character to the German Middle\r\nAges. The Hansa towns and the Hanseatic League recall some of the most\r\nstirring memories of German history. The League still survives in the\r\nthree independent republics of Hamburg, Bremen, and Lübeck. The\r\ndominant fact that German medieval civilization was a civilization of\r\nfree cities is driven home to the most superficial tourist. In every\r\ncorner of the German Empire, in north and south, on the banks of the\r\nRhine and the Elbe, in Rothenburg and Marienburg, in Frankfurt and\r\nFreiburg, the thousand monuments of the past prove to us the\r\nall-important truth that in Germany, as in Italy and in Flanders, it\r\nis the service of the city which has made for national greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nWar and anarchy put an end to municipal prosperity. Protestantism\r\nbrought with it the confusion of spiritual and temporal power, which\r\nbrought with it the despotism of the Princes, which meant the\r\nsuppression of civic liberty. The Thirty Years' War completed the ruin\r\nof the cities. The end of the seventeenth century put in the place of\r\ncity governance the tyranny of a hundred petty Princes. Everywhere we\r\nsee the ancient town halls crumbling into ruin, and we see arising\r\npretentious palaces built on the model of the Palace of Versailles.\r\nGermany had to go through the bitter humiliation of Jena before she\r\nrealized the necessity of reverting to her glorious civic traditions.\r\nThe statesmanship of Stein (see Seeley's \"Life and Times of Stein\")\r\nunderstood that such return was the prime condition of a German\r\npolitical renaissance. By his memorable Municipal Law of 1808 Stein\r\nrestored civic liberty. He made local self-government the corner-stone\r\nof German internal policy. The ordinance of Stein remains to this day\r\nthe organic law and Great Charter of the German city. It has stood the\r\ntest of one hundred years of change, and even the iron despotism of\r\nthe Hohenzollern has not been able to challenge it. In every other\r\npolitical institution Germany is lamentably behind. Only in her\r\nmunicipal life is she in advance of most European countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nAs we hinted at the outset, the municipality has far greater powers in\r\nGermany than in Great Britain. It is true that the police authority is\r\nunder the control of the central power, that education inspection is\r\nunder the control of the Church, which is another kind of spiritual\r\npolice. It is true that the City Fathers are debarred from mixing with\r\nparty politics. But within those limitations, and in the province of\r\neconomics and social welfare, municipal powers are almost\r\nunrestricted. It is thus that German towns have been the pioneers in\r\nschool hygiene. Every German child is under the supervision of the\r\nschool dentist and the school oculist. It is thus that German cities\r\nhave established their public pawnshops, and have saved the poor man\r\nfrom the clutches of the moneylender. It is thus that they have\r\ninitiated gratuitous legal advice for the indigent. They have even\r\nestablished municipal beerhouses and _Rathhauskeller_. In one word,\r\nthey have launched out in a hundred forms of civic enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking fields of municipal enterprise is the policy\r\nof Land Purchase. The people were encouraged to enter on this policy\r\nby the evils of private land speculation, and by the shocking housing\r\nconditions in some of the big cities, and especially in Berlin, where\r\nthe curse of the barrack system still prevails.\r\n\r\nNearly every German city is an important landowner, owning on an\r\naverage 50 per cent. of the municipal area.\r\n\r\n\"While the powers of English urban districts in relation to land\r\nownership are severely restricted by law, German towns are free to buy\r\nreal estate on any scale whatever, without permission of any kind,\r\nunless, indeed, the contracting of a special loan should be necessary,\r\nin which event the assent of the City Commissary is necessary. This\r\nassent, however, entails no local inquiry corresponding to the\r\ninquiries of the Local Government Board, simply because the German\r\nStates have no Local Government Board, and no use for them; the\r\nproceeding is almost a formality, intended to remind the communes that\r\nthe State, though devolved upon them their wide powers of\r\nself-government, likes still to be consulted now and then, and it is\r\narranged expeditiously through the post. For, strange as it may sound\r\nto English ears, the Governments of Germany, without exception, far\r\nfrom wishing to hamper the towns in their land investments, have often\r\nurged the towns to buy as much land as possible and not to sell\"\r\n(Dawson, p. 123).\r\n\r\n\"Within the present year the little town of Kalbe, on the Saale,\r\nexpended just £14 a head on its 12,000 inhabitants in buying for\r\n£468,000 a large estate for the purpose of creating a number of\r\nsmallholdings and labourers' allotments. During the period 1880 to\r\n1908 Breslau expended over one million and a half pounds in the\r\npurchase of land within the communal area. Berlin has an estate more\r\nthan three times greater than its administrative area. In 1910 alone\r\nseventy-three of the large towns of Germany bought land to the\r\naggregate extent of 9,584 acres and to the aggregate value of over\r\nfour million pounds sterling. Charlottenburg now owns 2,500 acres of\r\nland as yet not built upon, with a value of over a million and a\r\nquarter pounds, and the value of all its real estate is about four and\r\na half million pounds sterling. In 1886 Freiburg, in Baden, owned\r\nnearly 11,000 acres of land with a value of £925,000. In 1909 its\r\nestate was only 2,000 acres larger, but its value was then\r\n£2,300,000.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since 1891 Ulm, under the rule of a mayor convinced of the wisdom of\r\na progressive land policy and strong enough to carry it out, has\r\nbought some 1,280 acres of land at different times for £316,000, while\r\nit has sold 420 acres for £406,000, showing a cash profit of £900,000,\r\napart from the addition of 860 acres to the town estate. As a result\r\nof Ulm's land policy, its assets increased between 1891 and 1909 from\r\n£583,500 to £1,990,000, an increase of £1,407,000, equal to £25 a head\r\nof the population. Another result is that of the larger towns of\r\nWürtemberg only one has a lower taxation than Ulm. It is solely owing\r\nto its successful land policy that this enterprising town, without\r\nimposing heavy burdens on the general body of ratepayers, has been\r\nable to undertake a programme of social reforms which has created for\r\nit an honourable reputation throughout Germany.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nIn quite a different direction, in the encouragement of Art and\r\nLiterature, the German municipality plays a leading part.\r\n\r\n\"The budgets of most large and many small German towns contain an\r\nitem, greater or less according to local circumstances, which is\r\nintended to cover 'provision for the intellectual life of the town.'\r\nThis item is independent of expenditure on schools, and, if analyzed,\r\nwill be found often to include the maintenance of or subsidies to\r\nmunicipal theatres, bands, and orchestras, as well as grants to\r\ndramatic and musical societies of a miscellaneous order. In this\r\nprovision the theatre takes an altogether dominant position, and the\r\nfact is significant as reflecting the great importance which in\r\nGermany is attributed to the drama as an educational and elevating\r\ninfluence in the life of the community. It may be that the practice of\r\nsubsidizing the theatre is not altogether independent of the fact that\r\nthe repertory theatre is universal in Germany, except in the smallest\r\nof provincial towns, with the result that a far more intimate tie\r\nexists between the drama and the community than is possible in the\r\ncase of travelling companies.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the question be asked, Is the higher drama encouraged by the\r\nmunicipal theatre? the answer must be an emphatic affirmative of the\r\nhigh standard of education in Germany. Speaking generally, no theatres\r\nin Germany maintain the drama at a higher level than the municipal\r\ntheatres in the large towns. The lower forms of the drama will find no\r\nhome here, for public taste looks for the best that the stage can\r\noffer, and as the demand is, so is the supply. Many a provincial\r\ntheatre of this kind presents more Shakespearean plays in a week than\r\nthe average English theatre outside London presents in a couple of\r\nyears. A glance at the repertory of any of the municipal theatres\r\nwhich have been named is enough to convince one that an elevated aim\r\nis steadily kept in view. For example, in a recent year the two\r\nMannheim municipal theatres presented 161 separate works, including 93\r\ndramas, 62 operas and operettas, and 6 ballets, and of these works 442\r\nrepetitions were given in the aggregate, making for the year 604\r\nperformances, a number of which were at popular prices. The dramas\r\ngiven included fifteen by Schiller, ten by Shakespeare, three by\r\nGoethe, three by Lessing, five by Molière, four by Hans Sachs, four by\r\nSheridan, eleven by Grillparzer, two each by Kleist and Hebbel, and\r\nseveral by Ibsen, while the operas included three by Beethoven, three\r\nby Cherubini, six by Mozart, three by Weber, and several by Wagner.\r\nCould an English provincial theatre--could all English provincial\r\ntheatres together--show a record equal to this? That plays of this\r\nkind are given is proof that the German public looks to the municipal\r\ntheatre for the cultivation of the highest possible standard of\r\ndramatic taste and achievement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThe German city has managed to combine efficiency with freedom. She\r\nhas managed to establish a strong executive and yet to safeguard the\r\nwill of the people. In France the Mayor is appointed by the State, and\r\nhe is the tool of the Ministry. In Great Britain the City Fathers are\r\nhonorary and unpaid. In Germany they are salaried servants, and yet\r\nelected by the people. In Great Britain magistrates are temporary,\r\nephemeral figure-heads. They are not even allowed time to serve their\r\napprenticeship. They remain in office one, two, or at most three\r\nyears, receive a knighthood in the larger provincial towns, and retire\r\ninto private life. In Germany the Burgomaster and Aldermen are\r\npermanent servants, at first elected for twelve years, and on\r\nre-election appointed for life. Their whole life is identified with\r\nthe interests of the city.\r\n\r\nThere lies the originality of German civic government, and there lies\r\nthe secret of municipal efficiency. The German Mayor and council are\r\nexperts. City government is becoming so technical a science that there\r\nare now schools of civic administration established in several parts\r\nof the German Empire. The city administrator is not a grocer or a\r\ndraper temporarily raised to office, nor are they only town clerks and\r\nofficials. They have both the confidence of the people and the\r\nresponsibility of power, and they are given time to achieve results,\r\nto follow up a systematic policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThe whole secret of German municipal government is told by Mr. Dawson\r\nin a footnote of his book:\r\n\r\n\"The chief Mayor of Duisburg is about to seek well-earned rest after\r\nthirty-four years of work. When in 1880 he took over the direction of\r\nthe town's affairs, Duisburg had 34,000 inhabitants. To-day Duisburg,\r\nwith the amalgamated Ruhrort and Meiderich, has a population of\r\n244,000. This remarkable development is specially due to the\r\nfar-sighted municipal policy pursued by the chief Mayor, who made it\r\nhis endeavour to attract new industries to the State for the creation\r\nof the docks--as the result of which Duisburg is the largest inland\r\nport in the world--and the incorporation of Ruhrort and Meiderich in\r\n1905.\"\r\n\r\nThis footnote illustrating the history of Duisburg might serve equally\r\nwell as an illustration for the history of other German towns. On\r\nreading that footnote I could not help thinking of a famous English\r\nstatesman whose recent death has closed a stirring chapter of British\r\nhistory. German and Austrian municipalities give the widest scope for\r\npolitical genius and attract the ablest men. If the same conditions\r\nhad prevailed in this country, Mr. Chamberlain would have been content\r\nto identify himself with the prosperity of his adopted city, as the\r\nMayor of Duisburg identified himself with the greatness of Duisburg;\r\nas Lueger identified himself with the greatness of Vienna. And if\r\nBirmingham had given full scope to the genius of Mr. Chamberlain, how\r\ndifferent would have been the life-story of the late statesman, and\r\nhow different would be the England in which we are living to-day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEGLECT OF GERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many urgent reforms needed in our national education; those\r\nwho are best qualified to speak could make many a startling revelation\r\nif they only dared to speak out. And there is ample evidence that\r\nalmost every part of our educational machinery requires the most\r\nthorough overhauling. In the words of Bacon, \"Instauratio facienda ab\r\nimis fundamentis.\" But I doubt whether there does exist any more\r\nglaring proof of the present inefficiency of our Secondary Schools and\r\nUniversities than their scandalous attitude towards the study of the\r\nGerman language and literature.\r\n\r\nThe plain and unvarnished truth is that at the beginning of this, the\r\ntwentieth century, when Germany is the supreme political and\r\ncommercial Power on the Continent of Europe, the study of German is\r\nsteadily going back in the United Kingdom. In some parts it is\r\nactually dying out. In many important Secondary Schools it is being\r\ndiscontinued. Even in the Scottish Universities, which pride\r\nthemselves on being more modern and more progressive than the English\r\nUniversities, there does not exist one single Chair of German. In\r\nOxford a Chair of German was only established through the munificence\r\nof a patriotic German merchant.\r\n\r\nAnd even when there are teachers there are very few students. In one\r\nof the greatest British Universities, with a constituency of 3,500\r\nstudents, there has been, for the last ten years, an average of five\r\nto six men students. And the reluctance of young men to study German\r\nis perfectly intelligible. The study of German does not pay. It brings\r\nneither material rewards nor official recognition. All the prizes, all\r\nthe scholarships and fellowships, go to other subjects, and mainly to\r\nthe classics. Let any reader of _Everyman_ stand up and say that I am\r\nexaggerating; I would only be too delighted to discover that I am\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nSuch being the attitude of those who are primarily responsible for our\r\nnational education, can we wonder at the attitude of the general\r\npublic? Can we expect it to take any more interest in German culture\r\nthan the educational authorities? Let those who have any doubt or\r\nillusion on the subject make inquiries at booksellers', at circulating\r\nlibraries and public libraries, at London clubs. I have tried to make\r\nsuch an investigation, and all those institutions have the same sorry\r\ntale to tell. It is impossible to get an outstanding book which\r\nappears in Germany, for it does not pay the publisher to stock such a\r\nbook. At Mudie's, for every hundred French books there may be two\r\nGerman books. At the Royal Societies Club, with a membership of\r\nseveral thousands, every one of whom belongs to some learned society,\r\nyou may get the _Revue de Deux Mondes_, or the _Temps_, or the\r\n_Figaro_, but you cannot get a German paper. For the last twenty years\r\nI have not once seen a copy of the _Zukunft_, or the _Frankfurter\r\nZeitung_, or the _Kölnische Zeitung_, at an English private house, at\r\nan English club, at an English bookseller's, at an English library.\r\n\r\nA few months ago the most popular and most enterprising daily paper of\r\nthe kingdom published some articles on the German elections, which\r\nwere justly rousing a great deal of attention in this country. I was\r\nvery much impressed by the cleverness of those articles, but my\r\nadmiration knew no bounds when the author confessed that he was\r\nwriting without knowing a word of German, and that when attending\r\npolitical meetings he had to make out the meaning of the language by\r\nthe gestures and facial expression of the orators. Have we not here,\r\nmy classical friends, an exhilarating instance of the results of your\r\nmonopoly? _Ab uno disce omnes._\r\n\r\nWe are constantly being told that \"knowledge is power,\" and that the\r\nknowledge of a foreign language means not only intellectual power, but\r\ncommercial and political power. Yet those in authority do not budge an\r\ninch to get possession of such power. We are constantly warned by\r\npolitical pessimists that Germany is making gigantic strides, and that\r\nwe ought to keep a vigilant outlook. Yet we do nothing to obtain\r\nfirst-hand information of the resources of a nation of sixty-five\r\nmillions, who is certainly a formidable commercial rival, and who\r\nto-morrow may meet us in deadly encounter.[20] On the other hand, we\r\nare told with equal persistence by political optimists that we ought\r\nto be on the most friendly terms with a great kindred people from whom\r\nnothing separates us except regrettable ignorance and superficial\r\nmisunderstandings. Yet, in order to dispel that ignorance and to\r\nremove those misunderstandings, we do not make the first necessary\r\nstep--namely, to learn the language of the people whom we are said to\r\nmisunderstand.\r\n\r\n    [20] Written in 1912.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Members of Parliament and journalists are ready enough\r\nto proceed to Germany on a mission of goodwill, and to be entertained\r\nat banquets and international festivities. But how futile must be\r\nthose friendly demonstrations when we consider that the enormous\r\nmajority of those Parliamentarians and journalists are unable to read\r\na German newspaper! And how must it strike a citizen of Hamburg or\r\nFrankfurt when their English guests have to reply in English to the\r\ntoasts of their German hosts! And how must a patriotic German feel\r\nwhen he discovers that not five out of a hundred have taken the\r\ntrouble to master the noble language of the country whose friendship\r\nthey are seeking!\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago I had the pleasure of attending, at the house of a\r\nprominent political leader, a representative gathering of politicians,\r\ndiplomats, and journalists, who were met to consider the best means of\r\npromoting Anglo-German friendship. In answer to a speech of mine, an\r\neminent German publicist and editor of an influential monthly review\r\ndelivered an eloquent address in broken French. To hear a German\r\naddress in French an audience of Germanophile Englishmen was certainly\r\na ludicrous situation! But the speaker realized that it would be\r\nhopeless to use the German language, even to an assembly specially\r\ninterested in supporting Anglo-German friendship.\r\n\r\nHow long, my classical friends, are we going to submit to these\r\ndisastrous results of your monopoly? _Quousque tandem!_ How long are\r\nwe going to stand this scandal of international illiteracy and\r\nignorance, fraught with such ominous peril for the future? How long is\r\nthis nation going to be hoodwinked by an infinitesimal minority of\r\nreactionary dons and obscurantist parsons, determined to force a\r\nsmattering of Greek down the throats of a reluctant youth? How long is\r\nmodern culture to be kept back under the vain pretence of maintaining\r\nthe culture of antiquity, but in reality in response to an ignoble\r\ndread of enlightenment and progress, and in order to protect vested\r\ninterests and to maintain political, intellectual, and religious\r\nreaction?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMECKLENBURG, THE PARADISE OF PRUSSIAN JUNKERTHUM\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe tourist who takes the express train between Berlin and Copenhagen,\r\none hour after he has left the Prussian capital reaches a vast plain\r\nmore than half the size of Belgium, where barren moorlands alternate\r\nwith smiling fields, where dormant lakes are succeeded by dark\r\npine-forests. Few travellers ever think of breaking their journey on\r\nthis melancholy plain, the territory of the Grand Dukes of\r\nMecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. They have not the\r\nremotest suspicion that these Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg, which they\r\ncross in such listless haste, are, from a political point of view, one\r\nof the most fascinating countries of Europe. Mecklenburg has for the\r\nstudents of comparative politics the same sort of interest which an\r\nIndian reserve territory, or the Mormon State of Utah, has for the\r\ntraveller in the United States, or which a cannibal tract in the\r\nequatorial Congo forest has for the explorer of Central Africa. For\r\nthis pleasant land of Mecklenburg-Schwerin is the last survival of a\r\npatriarchal and feudal civilization. It is the most perfect type of\r\nthe paternal Prussian type of government, entirely unspoiled by the\r\nParliamentary institutions of a feeble democratic age.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nHere alone of all the North German States the conditions of a past\r\ngeneration continue in their pristine vigour. Although the Grand Duke\r\nis the only descendant of Slavonic Princes in the German Empire, and\r\nstill calls himself \"Prince of the Wendes,\" he is the most Teutonic of\r\ndynasts. Although Mecklenburg-Schwerin is independent of Prussia, it\r\nis the most Prussian and the most Junkerized of all Federal States.\r\n\r\nIn degenerate Prussia the Kaiser has actually to submit to the\r\nfinancial control of an unruly Reichstag, and is not even allowed to\r\nspend the Imperial revenues as any Emperor by right Divine ought to be\r\nlogically allowed to do. The Duke of Mecklenburg is far more fortunate\r\nthan William II. He has no accounts to settle, _he has not even a\r\nbudget to publish_. He collects in paternal fashion the revenues of\r\nhis Grand Ducal demesnes, and no power has any right to ask any\r\nquestions. Even the \"Almanack of Gotha,\" which is generally omniscient\r\nin these matters, is silent on the revenues of His Highness. There is\r\na public debt of about one hundred and fifty million marks! The public\r\nrevenues are the private income of the Grand Duke. The public debt is\r\na private charge on the people.\r\n\r\nIn degenerate Prussia even the Imperator-Rex has to divide some of his\r\nauthority with a meddlesome assembly, and has to delegate it to an\r\nobedient but ridiculous bureaucracy. In the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg\r\nthe ruler governs his subjects in the good old patriarchal way. It is\r\ntrue, in the troubled days of 1848 an unwise predecessor granted\r\nsomething like a paper constitution, but that scrap of parchment\r\nhappily became a dead-letter twelve months after it had been granted.\r\nIt is also true that there still subsists some faint image of\r\nrepresentative government in the two estates of the Grand Duchy,\r\ndating as far back as 1755, but those venerable estates of the Grand\r\nDuchy are only composed of and only represent the _Ritterschaft_--_i.e._,\r\nsix hundred and ninety noblemen; and the _Landschaft_--_i.e._, fifty\r\nmunicipalities. Neither the peasants in the country nor the artisans\r\nin the towns are ever troubled to give their advice on matters\r\nconcerning the common weal. And as, in order that a Bill may become\r\nthe law of the Grand Duchy, the consent of the two estates is\r\nrequired, nothing unpleasant is ever likely to happen, and the old\r\norder, represented by the six hundred and ninety overlords, continues\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nIn degenerate Prussia even the Junkers have to submit to the presence\r\nof petty landowners of lowly birth, or even to peasants of servile\r\norigin. Do not historians remind us that even Frederick the Great had\r\nto surrender to the claims of the Miller of Sans Souci. In\r\nMecklenburg-Schwerin there is no Miller of Sans Souci to worry the\r\nGrand Duke. _For no peasant owns one single acre of land._ One-half of\r\nthe territory of the Grand Duchy is owned by a few hundred lords of\r\nthe manor, and the other half realizes the Socialist ideal of the\r\nsuppression of private property and of the transfer of all private\r\nownership to the State. Six thousand square miles are the absolute\r\nproperty of the State--that is to say, of the Grand Duke. For never\r\nwas absolute ruler more truly entitled than the Grand Duke to\r\nappropriate the words of Louis XIV.: \"L'état c'est moi.\"\r\n\r\nIn this paradise of Prussian Junkerthum one might reasonably have\r\nexpected the monarch and the lords of the manor to enjoy as complete\r\nhappiness as is ever allotted to mortal man. And the peasants and\r\nartisans could equally be expected to share in the universal\r\ncontentment. Are not the Grand Duke and his knights as closely\r\ninterested in the welfare of their tenants as a shepherd in the\r\nwelfare of his flock? But even in a patriarchal Grand Dukedom the\r\nspirit of modern unrest seems to have penetrated. If German\r\nstatisticians may be trusted, the inhabitants of the Grand Duchy do\r\neven seem to have preferred the risks and uncertainties of living in a\r\ndistant and unpaternal American Government to the peace and quiet and\r\nsecurity of the Mecklenburg plains. The ungrateful subjects of the\r\nGrand Duke have done what the Kaiser once advised his own disloyal\r\nsubjects to do; they have shaken the dust of the Fatherland off their\r\nfeet; they have emigrated in such large numbers to the United States\r\nof America that this paradise of Prussian Junkerthum, with its 700,000\r\ninhabitants, is to-day the most thinly populated part of the German\r\nEmpire, and contains fewer industries than any other part.\r\n\r\nAfter all, to a military empire soldiers are more necessary than\r\npeasants and artisans. Already in 1815 Mecklenburg could claim the\r\nglory of having produced the greatest Junker soldier of the age, bluff\r\nand rough Prince Blücher, the victor of Waterloo. The achievements of\r\nthe Grand Ducal regiments have fully proved that Mecklenburg-Schwerin\r\nand Mecklenburg-Strelitz have in the present war remained true to the\r\nglories of their military past and have remained worthy of their\r\nfeudal present, and the august head of the Grand Ducal dynasty is just\r\nnow doing most efficient work in the Balkan States as the\r\nsuper-Ambassador of his Imperial cousin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN RACE HERESY AND THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of the following article to single out one aspect of\r\nthe war which has been strangely neglected. It is our purpose to\r\nemphasize the influence which the obsession of one particular idea,\r\nthe German race theory, has exercised over the German mind and the\r\npart which it has played in bringing about the war of the nations.\r\nFalse ideas have been the dragon's teeth from which have risen the\r\nlegions of five continents. Amongst those false ideas the most deadly,\r\nthe most fatal, has been the German heresy of race, the theory of race\r\ninequality and race antagonism. It is in the name of that race heresy,\r\nin the name of Germanism and Pan-Germanism, of Slavism and\r\nPan-Slavism, of Saxonism and Pan-Saxonism, the war is being waged.\r\n\r\nWe read the following passage in a recent book by Sven Hedin, the\r\nofficial chronicler of the German armies:\r\n\r\n\"Here is a (German) reservist. What a tremendous figure! What can\r\nLatins, Slavs, Celts, Japs, Negroes, Hindus, Ghurkas, Turcos, and\r\nwhatever they are called, do against such strapping giants of the\r\ntrue Germanic type? His features are superbly noble, and he seems\r\npleased with his day's work. He does not regret that he has offered\r\nhis life for Germany's just cause.\"\r\n\r\nIn this odious passage we have in a few lines the whole history and\r\nthe whole philosophy of the tragedy. We have the spirit with which the\r\nGermans have waged the war, we have the motive for which they have\r\nwaged it, and we have the ultimate purpose which they hope to\r\nachieve--namely, to force upon a subjected Europe the rule of the\r\nsuper-race of Treitschke and the _bionda bestia_ of Nietzsche.\r\n\r\nIn former times, in the so-called \"Dark Age,\" nations would fight for\r\nthe human, rational, but impracticable principle of orthodoxy. To-day\r\nwe are fighting for the inhuman, for the equally impracticable and\r\nimmoral principle of race antagonism. Germans fight because through\r\ntheir veins courses the red blood of the Teutons of Tacitus. They are\r\nfighting because they are convinced that they have the Might and the\r\nRight and the Duty of crushing the French and the Russians, because\r\nthrough French veins courses the tainted blood of the Gauls of Cæsar,\r\nand because through the veins of the Slavs courses the white fluid of\r\nthe slave and the yellow fluid of the Tatar.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the commonplaces of the economic school that the economic\r\nmotive is the main factor which makes for peace or war, that material\r\ninterests only count, and that ideas do not matter. It is one of the\r\nshallow illusions of the pseudo-rationalist school that the age of\r\nreligious wars is passed for ever. As a matter of fact, this war is as\r\nmuch a religious war as any crusade that was ever waged. The only\r\ndifference between the religious war of to-day and the religious wars\r\nof yesterday is that in the past dogmas were promulgated by priests\r\nand saints in the name of Theology. The dogmas of to-day are\r\npromulgated in the name of Science by the high-priests of Universities\r\nand Academies. A few mystical Greek words, such as _homousios_ and\r\n_homoiousios_, were the watchwords of the crusades of old. A few\r\nequally mystical Greek words, _brachycephalic_ and _dolichocephalic_,\r\nare the watchwords of the crusades of to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIt may seem the idle conceit of a dreamer out of touch with reality to\r\nassert that it is principles which mainly matter and that it is the\r\nideal which is the ultimate reality. It may seem a ludicrous\r\nexaggeration to assert that a mere abstract scientific theory,\r\napparently so innocuous as is the German race theory, could be held\r\nresponsible for so titanic a catastrophe. Surely there seems to be\r\nhere no relation and no proportion between cause and effect. Yet it\r\ndoes not take a prolonged effort of profound thinking to understand\r\nthe portentous political significance of the German race heresy. It is\r\nnot difficult to understand that according as we believe that history\r\nis mainly a conflict of ideals or according as we believe that history\r\nis mainly a conflict of material interests, or a conflict of races, we\r\nshall consistently either believe in peace or in war as the normal\r\ncondition of humanity. Conflicts of ideas ought rationally to make for\r\npeace. Conflicts of material interests will frequently, although not\r\nnecessarily, make for war. Conflicts of races must inevitably and\r\nalways make for war.\r\n\r\nIf you believe in the materialistic theory that human history is\r\nmainly made up of the inevitable antagonism between Aryan and Semite,\r\nbetween Slav and Teuton, between Celt and Anglo-Saxon, then you must\r\nalso believe that war is the permanent and beneficial factor in human\r\nhistory. For the conflicts of races for supremacy can only be solved\r\nthrough war.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you believe in the idealistic theory that human\r\nhistory is mainly a conflict of spiritual and moral and political\r\nideals, then peace is the ultimate factor. For human experience and\r\nhuman reason equally teach us that a conflict of spiritual ideals\r\ncannot be solved by violence. They can only be solved by discussion\r\nand argument, by persuasion and conversion, by the spread of\r\neducation, by clear thinking and strenuous working, by the diffusion\r\nof sweetness and light. Both reason and wisdom teach us that truth and\r\nfaith are like love--they cannot be imposed by force.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nUnderlying the theory of race there is a first assumption that there\r\nis such a thing as a distinct racial type; that there are definite\r\nbreeds of men, Aryans and Semites, Celts and Teutons, just as there\r\nare definite breeds of dogs and pigeons; that human breeds are\r\nevolved by similar selective processes; that those distinct racial\r\ntypes are the main factor in the history of nations; that those types\r\nare endowed with specific anatomical and physiological characteristics,\r\nand that those physiological characteristics carry with them equally\r\ndefinite moral, intellectual, and political qualities.\r\n\r\nAnd there is a second assumption which is the corollary of the first.\r\nNot only is there a separation of races, there is also an inequality\r\nof races. \"L'Inégalité des Races humaines\" is the title of the\r\nepoch-making book of Count de Gobineau. The \"Separation of Race\" is a\r\nbiological and objective fact. But to that biological fact we must add\r\na moral and subjective distinction. Some races are noble, others are\r\nignoble. Some races are born to rule, other races are born to obey, to\r\nbe \"hewers of wood and drawers of water.\" The Slav is born a slave to\r\nbe controlled by the Germans. The Serbian is born a serf to be\r\ncontrolled by the Austrians. The Bohemian is an outcast. The Pole is a\r\ndrunkard. The Celt is a weakling. The Anglo-Saxon is a mercenary. The\r\nRussian is a Tatar and a brute.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe German race theory is propped up by a formidable array of\r\nso-called scientific proofs. All the auxiliary disciplines of biology,\r\nbotany and zoology, physiology and anatomy, are enlisted in the\r\nservice of anthropology and ethnology. The question as to whether a\r\nparticular nation is a _Kultur Volk_ or whether it is only a rabble of\r\nslaves depends entirely on whether the facies is square or oval,\r\nbrachycephalic or oligocephalic. It depends entirely--to use the\r\npedantic jargon of the anthropologist--on the \"cephalic index\" of the\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nThe historical sciences are called in to support the conclusions of\r\nethnology. It is especially philology which is the most efficient\r\ninstrument demonstrating the existence and the superiority of a\r\ndistinct race. Just as anatomy reveals to us the structure of the\r\ncranium, so philology reveals to us the structure of the mind. The\r\nphilologist reveals the genealogies of words even as the\r\nanthropologist studies the genealogies of races.\r\n\r\nIn the burning controversies which for the last generation have\r\ndivided the Tchech and Magyar and Croatian and Roumanian races of the\r\nAustrian Empire, it is the philologists who have acted as umpires. In\r\nVienna philologists like von Jagic have all the authority and prestige\r\nof statesmen. Similarly, in the Balkan States, Serbians and\r\nBulgarians, Roumanians and Greeks, find conclusive evidence of their\r\nrespective rights in the dialects of the Macedonian populations. Such\r\nand such a province must be allotted to the Serbians, and not to the\r\nBulgarians, because such and such a dialect has more affinity to the\r\nSerbian than to the Bulgarian language. Similarly, in the Latin\r\nelements of their dictionary, Roumanian patriots find convincing\r\nevidence of their Latin ancestry, and finally prove that they are the\r\nlineal descendants of the Dacian legions of Emperor Trajan.[21]\r\n\r\n    [21] The Roumanian language is a composite language like\r\n    English. Even as the English vocabulary is mainly a blend of\r\n    Anglo-Saxon and Franco-Norman, so the Roumanian language is a\r\n    blend of Latin and Slavonic words. Many years ago the British\r\n    and Foreign Bible Society published a Roumanian Bible from\r\n    which the majority of the Slavonic words had been eliminated.\r\n    I pointed out in _Everyman_ that this Roumanian translation\r\n    was not Roumanian at all. The authorities of the Bible\r\n    Society indignantly protested and asked me to withdraw. I\r\n    refused to withdraw. The British and Foreign Bible Society\r\n    investigated the question, deferring to my criticisms, and\r\n    prepared and published a new revised version of their\r\n    Roumanian Bible in which the Slavonic words largely composing\r\n    the religious vocabulary of Roumania have been restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThose scientific arguments, biological and philological, may satisfy\r\nthe biologists and the philologists; they certainly satisfy nobody\r\nelse. All those pseudo-scientific facts belong to the realm of\r\nfiction. Serious thinkers have ceased to prattle about the application\r\nof biology to ethics since Huxley delivered his Romanes lecture on\r\n\"Evolution and Ethics.\" The encroachments of scientific materialism\r\nhave failed as signally in the political sciences as they have failed\r\nin ethics.\r\n\r\nIt is futile to compare the processes which evolve races of man with\r\nthe processes which evolve breeds of animals. It is true that in the\r\nlower stages of humanity the word \"race\" has a definite meaning. It\r\nmay be contended that there is a wide gulf between the races at the\r\nextreme end of the human scale, a gulf which even the enthusiastic\r\ndevotion of missionary effort does not seem able to bridge. There is\r\nsuch a thing as the \"blackness\" of the nigger and the \"yellowness\" of\r\nthe Chinese and the Japanese, although the Japanese have proved\r\nthemselves capable of assimilating Western civilization, and although\r\nthe black race has produced the greatest poet of Russia, Pouchkine,\r\nand one of the greatest novelists of France, Alexandre Dumas. But it\r\nis an all-important fact that as civilization advances the word \"race\"\r\nentirely changes its meaning. Evolution entirely modifies its\r\nprocesses. Biological factors steadily decrease in importance. Moral\r\nand political and intellectual factors as steadily increase in\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nIsolation and selection are the main conditions required to produce a\r\ndefinite breed of cattle. On the other hand, if we want to produce a\r\nhighly civilized type, it is not isolation which is the main\r\ncondition, but crossing and blending, mixture and intercourse. As we\r\nrise in the scale of humanity there are no fixed types. All types are\r\nequally plastic. There are no pure types. All types are equally mixed.\r\n\r\nEven if we take the Jewish race, which seems to show extraordinary\r\nfixity and stability of type, there is not one dominant Jewish type;\r\nthere are fully fifty different Jewish types. There is hardly any\r\nresemblance between the Jew of Tiflis and the Jew of Tangier, between\r\ndemocratic Ashkenazim and the aristocratic Sephardim. Race is not a\r\ncause, but an effect. It is not biology which explains politics, it is\r\npolitics which dominate biology. It is not the physical which explains\r\nthe moral, it is the moral which produces the physical. It is not the\r\nracial type which produces a racial belief and a racial community, it\r\nis the religion which produces the race. It is not the Hindu caste\r\nwhich produces the religion, it is religion which produces the caste.\r\nSimilarly, it is the religious and political conditions which have\r\nkept the Jew apart, and which have preserved the characteristics of\r\nthe race. Even so, religion and persecution have kept the\r\ncharacteristics of the Armenians or the Parsees and the Greek colonies\r\nin the Levant.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nA highly gifted race is invariably the outcome of complex elements, of\r\nmany cross-currents. Invariably it is the outcome of moral, spiritual,\r\nand political factors. It is the outcome of unity of language, of\r\nunity of religion, of community of traditions and institutions. It is\r\nmainly religion which keeps apart the French and the Anglo-Saxon races\r\nin Canada, and which divides the Celt from the Ulsterman in Ireland.\r\nLet the religious boundary break down, and the Irish Celt will blend\r\nwith the Ulster Scot, the French Canadian will mix with the\r\nAnglo-Saxon. The race heresy in its modern form is the sinister shadow\r\nprojected by the biological materialism of the early Darwinians. It is\r\nthe same materialistic conception which has triumphed in German\r\nMarxism and in the economic interpretation of history. It is the same\r\nconception which has triumphed in the _Realpolitik_ and _Weltpolitik_,\r\nand the elimination of the moral factor from the activities of high\r\npolicy. The tyranny of the race dogma permeates the majority of the\r\nGerman historians and publicists from the early nineteenth century. We\r\nfind it in Mommsen's \"History of Rome.\" It has found a striking\r\nexpression in his famous chapter on the Celts, which is only a veiled\r\nattack against the French, who are assumed to be the lineal\r\ndescendants of the Gauls. The same dogma is the dominant idea of\r\nTreitschke's \"History.\" We find it in the _bionda bestia_ of\r\nNietzsche. We find it in the \"Foundations of the Nineteenth Century\"\r\nof Houston Stewart Chamberlain. We find it in the works of Count de\r\nGobineau, who, after working unnoticed in his own country, has been\r\nheralded as the apostle of Pan-Germanism in the Vaterland. The race\r\nheresy has been the _leitmotiv_ of all political controversies in the\r\nEmpire. We find it equally in the anti-Semitic, in the anti-Russian,\r\nin the anti-French propaganda. It has culminated in the triple dogma\r\nof the superman, of the super-race, and of the super-State, and this\r\ntriple dogma of the German _Realpolitik_ has worked for the\r\nenslavement of Europe as inevitably as the triple dogma of the French\r\nRevolution--_Liberté_, _Egalité_, _Fraternité_--was bound to lead to\r\nthe liberation of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nFor the philosophy of race, with all the liberal demonstrations of its\r\nvotaries, is essentially and inevitably the philosophy of reaction and\r\nthe philosophy of militarism, if it is carried to its logical\r\nconclusion. And, unfortunately, in Germany it has been carried to its\r\nlogical conclusion. In Britain and France thinkers have advocated the\r\nsame deadly theories. The same deadly poison of pseudo-science has\r\ninfected the body politic. But Darwin and Huxley always saved\r\nthemselves by inconsistency from the ruthless application of their\r\ndoctrines. The common sense of the community has shrunk from extreme\r\nlogic. In a country of free discussion and of free institutions\r\ndoctrines are counteracted by other influences. Theories are tested by\r\nlife. In an autocratic country theories are supreme. The undiluted\r\ntheories of Rousseau and Robespierre were supreme under the Reign of\r\nTerror; the theories of Katkov and the extreme Pan-Slavists were\r\nsupreme in Russia under the reign of Alexander III. Under a government\r\nlike Prussia, where all the spiritual forces are mobilized, where\r\nUniversities, Churches, and newspapers are subject to the State, there\r\nis nothing to counteract the doctrinaire spirit. It is, therefore, not\r\nto be wondered at that the heresy of race should have become a fixed\r\nidea, a monomania, in the German Empire. In Great Britain the theories\r\nof the apostate Englishman Chamberlain could not have struck deep\r\nroot, notwithstanding all the enthusiastic praise which Mr. Bernard\r\nShaw has given to the \"Foundations.\" In France the theories of Count\r\nde Gobineau passed unnoticed. In Germany \"Gobineau Societies\" have\r\nbeen established in order to propagate the gospel of the French\r\ndiplomat. In Germany one hundred thousand copies of the \"Foundations\"\r\nof Chamberlain, with their ponderous twelve hundred pages compact with\r\nfacts and arguments, have been sold, have poisoned countless brains,\r\nand have wielded enormous political influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThe first inevitable outcome of the German race heresy has been to\r\nstimulate the belief in the supremacy of the Teuton and to transform\r\nthe natural conceit of patriotism into an odious megalomania. Once the\r\nGermans assumed in accordance with the race dogma that some European\r\nraces are born to rule and others to obey, it was inevitable that they\r\nshould draw the further inference that they of all races were the\r\ndominant race. It is true that the belief of the Calvinist in\r\nreligious predestination may lead to a pessimistic as well as to an\r\noptimistic conclusion. The believer in predestination may assume that\r\nhe is predestined to eternal damnation as easily as he assumes that he\r\nis predestined to eternal salvation. But the pseudo-scientific mind\r\nand the materialistic mind is not so easily addicted to humility and\r\npessimism. The slave morality of the Christian may lead to meekness\r\nand charity and to all the negative virtues of a degenerate\r\nChristianity. The master morality of the Anti-Christ Nietzsche must\r\nlead to the ruthless assertion of power. The belief in race\r\npredestination can therefore only result in megalomania, and in\r\nGermany it has certainly resulted in the most acute, the most insane,\r\ninflation of nationalism and imperialism recorded in modern history.\r\nOf that megalomania the Kaiser has been, in innumerable speeches, the\r\neloquent and insolent spokesman.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nEven as race heresy must result in racial megalomania, it must result\r\nin political reaction and in the government of caste. The principle\r\nwhich is true of the nation as a whole is as true of every section of\r\nthat nation. And the pride of race in a nation is substantially the\r\nsame thing as the pride of birth in a class. If amongst the races of\r\nman there is one particular breed, the Teuton, which constitutes the\r\nborn aristocracy of humanity, so amongst those Teutons there is one\r\nspecial caste which is the born aristocracy of Teutonism. It is the\r\nrooted belief in the race theory which has maintained the rule of\r\nJunkerthum. On the race theory an exclusive aristocratic government\r\nrecruited and maintained by artificial selection is the only logical\r\nand sensible government, and democracy is bound to be considered as a\r\nprinciple of decay. The Kings of Prussia select their rulers on the\r\nsame principle on which King Frederick William selected his regiment\r\nof six-foot grenadiers from the military caste.\r\n\r\nThat is why we find in Prussia the most exclusive aristocratic\r\ngovernment in the world. As a sop to Southern German opinion, Bismarck\r\nwas compelled to grant universal suffrage for the Reichstag, but in\r\nthe Prussian Parliament, or \"Landtag,\" Bismarck, the Junker of blood\r\nand iron, retained the good old principle of aristocratic government.\r\nUnder the three-class voting system of the Landtag, one voter\r\nconstituting by himself the first class may have as much political\r\npower as the twenty thousand electors constituting the third class.\r\nThat is also why the Prussian Junker retains by right of birth a\r\nmonopoly in the higher ranks of the Army, of the Diplomatic and Civil\r\nService. The Junker is born to greatness even as the princely families\r\nof Germany have been born to a monopoly of all the thrones of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nAs the race theory must inevitably lead to megalomania and reaction,\r\nso it must inevitably lead to militarism. As it is incompatible with\r\ndemocracy, so it is incompatible with peace. As we pointed out at the\r\nbeginning of this analysis, if it be indeed true that there are some\r\nraces which are born to rule, it is their duty to assert their will to\r\npower over inferior races. If \"the true Teutonic type\"--to use the\r\nwords of Sven Hedin--be indeed superior to the Celt, to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon, to the Slav, and to the Latin, he is morally bound to\r\nassert that superiority. The Teuton will not only achieve the victory,\r\nhe will deserve it. _Die Weltgeschichte ist das Weltgericht_ (World\r\nhistory is world judgment). History is not a conflict between\r\nabstractions, between truth and error, between higher and lower\r\nprinciples, between conflicting ideals; it is, above all, the tragic\r\nconflict between higher and lower races. War is necessary and war is\r\nbeneficial. War is not only the instrument, it is also the criterion,\r\nof progress. \"Might is Right\" ceases to be an immoral principle.\r\n\"Might is Right\" is the ultimate formula of the most sublime morality,\r\nfor Might is but the Right of the strong to establish the rule of the\r\nnoble over the ignoble elements of humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA SLUMP IN GERMAN THEOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn the universal readjustment--or, to use the favourite expression of\r\nNietzsche, in the \"transvaluation\"--of political and spiritual values\r\nwhich must follow the war, we may confidently expect a general slump\r\nin all German values. There will be a slump in German education and in\r\nGerman erudition, in German music and in German watering-places. There\r\nwill be a slump in that \"exclusive morality\" for which Lord Haldane\r\ncould not find an equivalent in the English language, and for which,\r\nin his famous Montreal address, he could only find an equivalent in\r\nthe German word _Sittlichkeit_. But, most important of all, there will\r\nbe a lamentable slump in the most highly prized of all German\r\nvalues--German theology.\r\n\r\nGermany may still retain a monopoly of toys; Germany may still\r\ncontinue to supply Princes to the vacant thrones of Europe; but it is\r\neminently probable that God Almighty will cease to be made in the\r\nVaterland.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not been brought up in a Scottish Presbyterian\r\nUniversity atmosphere realizes the mystical prestige hitherto enjoyed\r\nby German theology. The education of a Scottish divine was thought\r\nincomplete, a graduate in divinity, however brilliant and devout,\r\ncould not get an important charge, if he had not received the hallmark\r\nand consecration of a German theological faculty. And what was true of\r\nGerman Universities was equally true of German theological books.\r\nPublishers like Messrs. Clark, of Edinburgh, and Messrs. Williams and\r\nNorgate, of London, made considerable fortunes merely from their\r\ntranslations of German works of divinity.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice in favour of German Universities and against French\r\nUniversities goes back to the early days of the Reformation. Already\r\nin \"Hamlet\" we find the serious young man going to Wittenberg and the\r\nfrivolous young man going to Paris in quest of worldly amusement. That\r\npro-German and anti-French prejudice has continued until our own day.\r\nIn vain have I for twenty years attempted in the Universities of\r\nScotland to send our graduates to French Universities. In vain did I\r\ncontend that one single year spent in the Sorbonne provided greater\r\nintellectual stimulus than a whole decade spent in a German\r\nUniversity. The old Puritan feeling against France proved too strong.\r\nUntil the year 1914 the stream of our students continued to be\r\ndirected to Göttingen and Heidelberg, to Bonn and Berlin. Even in our\r\ndistant colonies, even in Toronto, I found that the majority of\r\nteachers were \"made in Germany,\" whilst of American Universities it is\r\nhardly too much to say that many of them had actually become German\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice which sent Scottish and English ministers of the Gospel\r\nto complete their preparation in Germany was all the more\r\nextraordinary because Positive Christianity had almost vanished from\r\nthe theological faculties of Protestant Germany. Even as Holy Russia\r\nhas remained on the whole the most Christian nation in Europe,\r\nProtestant Prussia was certainly the least Christian. It was aptly\r\nsaid by Huxley of the philosophy of Comte, that Comtism was\r\nCatholicism minus Christianity. We might say in the same way of German\r\ntheology, that it was philosophy and metaphysics and philology minus\r\nChristianity. Seventy-five years ago David Frederick Strauss, who\r\nwould be forgotten but for the pamphlet of Nietzsche, wrote a\r\nponderous treatise of a thousand pages, translated by George Eliot, to\r\nprove that Christ was a myth. At the end of his life he strenuously\r\nattempted in his \"Old and New Faith\" to find a substitute for\r\nChristian theology. German Protestantism travelled the road he\r\nindicated. The German people have ceased to believe in Christianity;\r\nbut they have come to believe in the self-styled Anti-Christ\r\nNietzsche. They have ceased to believe in God; but they still believe\r\nin His self-appointed vicegerent, the Kaiser. They have ceased to\r\nbelieve in Providence; but they still believe in a Providential German\r\nnation. They have ceased to believe in the Holy Trinity; but they\r\nbelieve all the more fanatically in the New Trinity of the Superman,\r\nthe Super-race and the Super-State. And it is this new fanatical\r\nbelief which has brought about the war of the nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice of our Protestant Churches in favour of German\r\nTheological Faculties proceeded on the assumption that German\r\nProtestantism was identical with Anglo-Saxon Protestantism. Surely\r\nthat strange assumption does little credit to the spiritual insight of\r\nour divines. German Protestantism has absolutely nothing in common\r\nwith Anglo-Saxon Protestantism. For whatever may have been adduced\r\nagainst British and American Nonconformity, it must be admitted that\r\nat least Anglo-Saxon Nonconformity was generally what it professed to\r\nbe. Anglo-Saxon Nonconformity actually did refuse to conform,\r\nAnglo-Saxon Protestantism did actually protest. The separation between\r\nChurch and State was a fundamental principle of Anglo-Saxon policy,\r\nand that separation was no ideal platonic theory. Nonconformists gave\r\nup their emoluments, they again and again risked their lives in\r\ndefence of their principles. In defence of their principles tens of\r\nthousands migrated to distant climes.\r\n\r\nFor that very reason Anglo-Saxon Nonconformity has rendered\r\ninestimable service to political liberty. German Protestantism has\r\nnever rendered a single service to political liberty, for the simple\r\nreason that its political practice has been consistently the reverse.\r\nSo far from Lutheran Protestantism being based on the separation of\r\nChurch and State, it was based on the confusion of spiritual and\r\ntemporal power. That confusion began with the very earliest days of\r\nLutheranism. Lutherans are inclined to depreciate the personality and\r\nactivity of John Huss, the great Slav reformer, because, judged from\r\nworldly standards, John Huss seems to have been a failure. As a matter\r\nof fact, the Slav reformer was the ideal spiritual hero. The Teutonic\r\nreformer was in many ways a time-server. To Luther must be traced the\r\nprinciple that spiritual allegiance must follow temporal allegiance,\r\nthat the subjects must follow the creed of their Prince. That belief\r\nwas expressed in the Protestant motto, _Cujus regio illius religio_,\r\nand that motto even to this day accounts for the bewildering religious\r\ngeography of the German Empire.\r\n\r\nThat servile attitude of the Protestant Church to the German State has\r\nsurvived to this generation; whereas the Roman Catholic Church made a\r\nbrave stand against Bismarck in the _Kulturkampf_, the Lutheran Church\r\nhas remained a docile State Church. This Erastianism is illustrated by\r\nno one more signally than by the Pontifex Maximus of Prussian\r\nProtestantism, His Excellency Wirklicher Geheimrath Adolf von Harnack.\r\nHarnack has earned world-wide fame as a bold interpreter of the\r\nScriptures, but he has refused to countenance those ministers who were\r\ndischarged merely because they acted on his teachings. In his\r\nexegesis, Harnack has been the most uncompromising of critics. In his\r\nreligious politics, he has been the most tame of courtiers, the most\r\npliable of diplomats. He has taken infinite liberties with the Sacred\r\nTexts. He has never taken any liberties with the sacred majesty of the\r\nKaiser.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe confusion of temporal and spiritual power in German Protestantism\r\nbrought about two great evils--servility in politics and indifference\r\nin religion. But it also seemed to bring one great compensating\r\nadvantage--namely, complete toleration of other creeds. People do not\r\nfight for a creed to which they have become indifferent. Frederick the\r\nGreat gave equal hospitality to the free-thinking Voltaire and to the\r\nJesuits who had been expelled from most Catholic countries.\r\n\r\nThat compensating advantage of religious toleration seemed to further\r\nthe higher intellectual life of the Universities, and in one sense it\r\ndid. But it must not be forgotten that neither religious toleration\r\nnor the higher intellectual life ever extended to the province of\r\npolitics. The freedom of the Prussian Universities was always limited\r\nby the necessities of the State and the accidents of politics. With\r\nregard to religion and political thought, the Prussian State always\r\nacted on the principle implied in the cynical epigram of Gibbon: \"All\r\nreligions are equally true to the believer. They are equally false to\r\nthe unbeliever, and _they are equally useful to the statesman_.\" For\r\nthree hundred years the Prussian statesmen have attempted to utilize\r\nthe Christian religion, and Prussian Christian divines have in fact\r\nproved the most serviceable of tools. Unfortunately, in the process\r\nreligion has disappeared from Prussian soil, and with the liberating\r\ninfluence of the Christian religion has vanished political liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE GERMAN ENIGMA[22]\r\n\r\n    [22] Georges Bourdon, \"L'Enigme Allemande,\" Librairie Plon,\r\n    Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe present investigation into Franco-German relations conducted on\r\nbehalf of the _Figaro_ is the work of one of the ablest publicists of\r\nmodern France. It is the work of a good European who wishes to put an\r\nend to the senseless competition in armaments, and to the\r\ninternational distrust and nervousness which are the main causes of\r\nsuch armaments. The book is also the work of a good Frenchman who\r\nrealizes that no settlement can be durable which does not safeguard\r\nthe sacred rights of the conquered peoples of Alsace-Lorraine, who are\r\nthe first victims of outraged justice. There lies the originality of\r\nthe book. It reveals the new direction which public opinion and\r\npolitical thought are taking in contemporary France. The whole\r\nquestion of the relations between France and Germany is lifted to a\r\nhigher plane. We hear no more of the humiliation of France, of her\r\npride and dignity, of rancour and revenge. We hear less of the balance\r\nof military force. The main question which is raised is a question of\r\nmoral principle and of international right.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe work of Monsieur Bourdon is not only a good book; it is also a\r\nbrave deed. Too long has it been the fashion for French publicists to\r\nentrench themselves behind Gambetta's phrase: \"N'en parler jamais, y\r\npenser toujours!\" Silence may have been the best policy on the morrow\r\nof the catastrophe of 1870, when one single indiscretion might have\r\nset Europe aflame. But after forty-four years, and under entirely\r\naltered conditions, an ostrich policy of reticence, a cowardly policy\r\nof mental reservation, cannot be the best means of bringing about a\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Bourdon has therefore chosen the bolder course, which happens\r\nalso to be the wiser course. He has broken down the barrier of fear\r\nand distrust. He has taken the first step. He has gone to Germany in a\r\nspirit of frankness and conciliation. He has tried to get at her\r\nthoughts and afterthoughts. He has cross-examined the German people,\r\nand he has cross-examined them with consummate tact and skill. An\r\nunofficial ambassador of peace, he has revealed all the qualities of a\r\ndiplomat, and he has added qualities which the diplomat does not often\r\npossess--outspokenness and uprightness, a loyal regard for truth, and\r\nthat moral preoccupation and that delicate sense of international\r\nhonour which are generally alien to the official diplomatic mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAnd the result of this searching inquiry is most satisfactory. Quite\r\napart from the value of the opinions expressed, and of the author's\r\nown opinion, the inquiry in itself is an historical document of prime\r\nimportance. Here we have before us at first hand the public opinion of\r\nGermany. Nor is it the irresponsible opinion of anonymous scribblers,\r\nor the opinion of party politicians; it is the deliberate, reasoned\r\nopinion of some of the most distinguished German readers in thought\r\nand action. Statesmen and diplomats, captains of industry and army\r\ncaptains, editors and financiers, all the professions except the\r\nChurch (a significant omission!), are represented in this survey of\r\nGerman opinion. After reading M. Bourdon's book, no politician will\r\nhenceforth be allowed to plead as an excuse that he does not know what\r\nofficial and unofficial Germany thinks, and what she feels on the\r\nvital questions of foreign policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nAnd perhaps the readers may carry away the impression that Germany\r\nfeels more than she thinks; that she is carried away by prejudice, by\r\ncurrents and cross-currents of emotion, rather than led by general\r\nprinciples and clear and sober thinking. I had asked one of the most\r\neminent British publicists living to write an introduction to the\r\nEnglish translation of M. Bourdon's book which is to be published next\r\nmonth by Messrs. Dent. But my friend answered that he would willingly\r\nhave written such an introduction if he could have agreed with the\r\nideas of the French writer. Unfortunately, he did not see his way to\r\nagree with Monsieur Bourdon. No purpose, he argued, could be served by\r\ncross-examining German opinion, for there was no German opinion. In\r\nvain did Monsieur Bourdon claim to tell us what Germany thinks; the\r\nGermans were not educated to think politically. And there was the rub.\r\nThere was no organized public opinion, and even if there were, it\r\ncould only express itself, it could not press its demands upon a\r\ndespotic Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nI do not here examine how much truth there may be in my friend's\r\ncontention. But one fact must certainly strike the readers of M.\r\nBourdon's book. The present position is as ominous as it is\r\nbewildering and unintelligible.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Bourdon has proved once more the tremendous power of German\r\nmilitarism. German militarism seems to be bred in the bone of the\r\nPrussians, and has been inoculated into the German people. The army is\r\nthe most popular service in the country. It provides an honourable\r\ncareer to tens of thousands of young men of the middle classes and of\r\nthe aristocracy. At the same time, Monsieur Bourdon points out that\r\nfrom the German point of view it is one thing to be militarist, and\r\nanother to be warlike and bellicose. The Germans hold that the most\r\nconfirmed militarist may be a convinced pacifist. The father of\r\nFrederick the Great, the greatest militarist of the Hohenzollern\r\nDynasty, the Sergeant-King, was so attached to his army that he never\r\nemployed it in active warfare, he never allowed it to fight a single\r\nbattle, for fear of losing or spoiling so perfect an instrument.\r\n\r\nBut even granting this paradoxical thesis of the pacifism of German\r\nmilitarists, the situation remains sufficiently contradictory and\r\ndistracting to the ordinary mind. Every representative German\r\nconsulted by Monsieur Bourdon proclaims that Germany is pacific, that\r\nshe wishes for peace, and that she needs peace for her industrial and\r\ncommercial expansion. Yet we see her making gigantic preparations for\r\na possible war. With a restless endeavour, and at tremendous cost, we\r\nsee her developing her warlike resources. Every representative German\r\ninsists on making platonic professions. Yet we do not hear of a single\r\nstatesman daring to take the necessary step or to make the necessary\r\nsacrifices. No one seems to understand that peace demands sacrifices\r\nquite as heroic as war. No Bismarck of peace seems to be strong enough\r\nto-day to put an end to the senseless waste of national resources and\r\nmisdirected energies.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThe \"German Enigma\" of Monsieur Bourdon is mainly an objective,\r\nimpartial, and impersonal study, and the author has been careful not\r\nto obtrude his own private views. It is only in the last chapter that\r\nhe attempts to draw the lesson and point out the conclusion of his own\r\ninquiry. And his conclusion is an eloquent though restrained plea for\r\na Franco-German _rapprochement_, and in favour of the only policy\r\nwhich will bring about that reconciliation. France, he argues, does\r\nnot want a revision of the Treaty of Frankfurt. She does not want\r\ncompensation or revenge. French history contains a sufficiently\r\nbrilliant roll of glorious military achievements that the French\r\npeople may afford to forget the reverses and humiliations of 1870. A\r\nFrench statesman, on the eve of the Treaty of Frankfurt, made the\r\nrhetorical statement that France would never surrender one stone of\r\nher fortresses nor one inch of her territory. Animated by a very\r\ndifferent spirit, modern French statesmen do not claim back to-day one\r\ninch of lost territory. All that the French people demand is that the\r\nclaims of justice shall be heard, that Alsace-Lorraine shall cease to\r\ngroan under the heel of an arbitrary despot, that Alsace-Lorraine\r\nshall be governed according to her own laws, that the Alsatians shall\r\nbe treated as a free people, and not as conquered subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nAnd that one sole possibly solution is also the only simple solution.\r\nThat solution would involve no sacrifice of pride or dignity to either\r\nnation. France would not make any surrender to Germany, and Germany\r\nwould not make any concession to France. Both would surrender to the\r\ndemands of international justice.\r\n\r\nAnd the solution of the autonomy of Alsace-Lorraine would be in the\r\ninterests of all parties concerned, as well as of European\r\ncivilization. France and Germany would be delivered from a nightmare\r\nwhich for forty-four years has paralyzed their activities. One hundred\r\nand ten millions of the two most progressive nations of the Continent\r\nwould cease to oppose each other in every quarter of the globe.\r\n\r\nAlsace-Lorraine would cease to be the festering wound on the open\r\nfrontier of the two countries, but would once more discharge her\r\nhistorical function of being the connecting link between Latin and\r\nTeutonic peoples.\r\n\r\nAnd the whole of Europe would be delivered from the crushing burden of\r\nmilitary expenditure. Hundreds of millions at present wasted on\r\narmaments would be devoted to productive purposes. Commerce and\r\nindustry would receive an impetus which in one generation would renew\r\nthe face of Europe. Reaction would collapse with the disappearance of\r\nmilitary predominance, and European Governments could devote\r\nthemselves whole-heartedly to the anxious problems clamouring for a\r\nsolution, and to the momentous tasks of popular education and social\r\nreform which are waiting to be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRAGIC ISOLATION OF GERMANY: AN INTERVIEW WITH A CONTINENTAL\r\nSTATESMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nA few months ago[23] it was my good fortune to discuss the\r\ninternational situation with Monsieur Emile Ollivier, the veteran\r\nstatesman, the Napoleonic Prime Minister with the light heart whose\r\nname will ever be identified, and identified unjustly, with a\r\ndisastrous war. A few days ago it was again my privilege to discuss\r\nthe European situation with another Continental statesman whose name\r\nwill for ever be identified with the cause of peace. I am not at\r\nliberty to disclose the identity of the illustrious speaker. Suffice\r\nit to say that he is a statesman whose every word compels attention\r\nall over the world and imposes respect, a man of infinite wit, of\r\npenetrating intellect, and whose commanding personality has on more\r\nthan one occasion directed the course of world politics, and has\r\nhelped to save Europe from an impending catastrophe. For more than an\r\nhour the speaker discussed with me, if an almost uninterrupted\r\nmonologue may be called a discussion, the anxious problems of modern\r\nGermany. Without reticence or afterthought, he gave me the benefit of\r\nhis mature wisdom and of a lifelong experience.\r\n\r\n    [23] Written in the spring of 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nYou ask me to give you the key of the international situation. That\r\nkey is in Germany, or rather in Berlin. For Prussia controls Germany,\r\nand will more and more control it in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Germans are nervous and uneasy, and that is why they ceaselessly\r\nincrease their armaments. They are nervous because the whole European\r\nsituation has been radically changed, to their detriment. The whole\r\nbalance of power has been upset by the results of the Balkan War. They\r\nare nervous because they are tragically isolated. Germany has no\r\nfriends, no allies, and has therefore to defend herself on two, or\r\nrather on three, fronts. She has to defend herself at once against\r\nFrance, against Russia, and against England.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the Triple Alliance still subsists. But it subsists\r\nonly in name. For Germany can count neither on Italy nor on Austria.\r\nShe cannot count on Italy. For Italy is a hopeless coquette, and she\r\ntransfers her erratic affections wherever her interest leads her. Nor\r\ncan Germany count on Austria. No longer can Austria be called the\r\n\"loyal secundant.\" For Austria has ceased to be controlled by her\r\nTeutonic population. She is at the mercy of the Slavs, both inside and\r\noutside of her empire. She is abandoned by Roumania, who is seeking\r\nthe support of Russia. She is detested by the Serbians, who have the\r\nbest organized army in the Balkans. It would have been the vital\r\ninterest of Austria to win over Serbia, and it would have been so easy\r\nto win her over. An equitable treaty of commerce, the concession of a\r\nport on the Adriatic, and Serbia would have become the ally of\r\nAustria. Serbia was prepared to forget the shameful policy hitherto\r\npursued by Austria. All that was required was some give-and-take, some\r\nfairness.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBut that sense of fairness, of international equity, is exactly what\r\nboth Prussia and Austria are so lamentably deficient in. The\r\nAustrians, like the Prussians, may be individually most pleasant.\r\nPolitically and collectively they are consistently disagreeable. They\r\nnever seem to understand the first principle of diplomacy--namely,\r\nthat no treaty can be of any permanent value which is only\r\nadvantageous to one side.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the utter tactlessness of the Germans. It is partly\r\nexplainable by their belief in force. When you believe in force you do\r\nnot trouble to persuade or conciliate. It is also partly explainable\r\nby the absence in Prussia of an old tradition of refinement and\r\nculture. As Bismarck once said cynically and frankly to Thiers: \"Mon\r\ncher ami! Nous autres Prussiens, nous sommes encore des barbares\" (We\r\nPrussians, we are still barbarians).\r\n\r\nThe Prussian, therefore, in diplomacy is a blunderer and a bully. He\r\nhas the art of making himself unpleasant. And he seems to enjoy doing\r\nso. It is significant that the Germans are the only people who have\r\ncoined a special word to express the pleasure felt by inflicting\r\npain. The curious and expressive German word _Schadenfreude_ cannot be\r\ntranslated into any other language.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why in politics the Germans fail to make friends. They are\r\nfeared by all nations. They are respected by some. They are loved by\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nAnd they fail to make friends at home quite as lamentably as abroad.\r\nThey fail to win over the nations living under their own German laws.\r\nThey are making such inconceivable blunders as the expropriation of\r\nthe Poles and the colonization scheme of Posen. It is a striking fact\r\nthat with the single possible exception of the Galicians--who fear\r\nRussia even more than they detest Austria--there is not a single\r\nnon-German-speaking people either in the German Empire or in the\r\nAustrian Empire who has accepted the rule of the Teuton. Alsatian and\r\nDane, Pole and Tchech, Croatian and Roumanian--all the subject races\r\nare equally disaffected. They may disagree in everything, but they\r\nagree in their opposition to Teutonic rule.\r\n\r\nWhat a tragedy this German world empire of the twentieth century! Once\r\nGermany was made up of little cities and great Universities. To-day\r\nshe is made up of big cities and impotent Universities. Where are the\r\nspiritual and artistic glories of the past? The moral and intellectual\r\ninfluence of Germany has reached its lowest ebb.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nIt is this striking isolation of Germany which compels her to arm. On\r\nthe other hand, there can be no doubt that this very isolation is\r\nmaking for peace. Nobody either in Europe or Germany wants war.\r\nNeither the Emperor nor his Ministers want war. War is too great a\r\nrisk. It is too much of a gamble. In warfare it is always the\r\nunexpected that happens. War may be the national industry of Prussia.\r\nBut it is the most _speculative_ of all industries.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, whilst we are all wishing for peace, we must ever be\r\non our guard. With the militarist tendencies of a bureaucratic and\r\ndespotic State, with the economic pressure of an increasing\r\npopulation, one is always at the mercy of an incident. Twenty-five\r\nyears ago the Schnaebele incident brought Europe to the verge of war.\r\nSimilar frontier incidents in this age of aeroplanes can happen any\r\nday. They did happen yesterday. They did not lead to serious\r\nconsequences. They might lead to fatal consequences to-morrow. They\r\nmight be magnified by a sensational Press and by bellicose partisans\r\nsuch as the Pan-Germanists. The Pan-Germanists may be only a small\r\nminority to-day, but they are noisy, and they are just the kind of\r\npeople ever looking out for just such \"unpleasant incidents.\"\r\n\r\nYes, let us be on our guard! Let us not trust to a false sense of\r\nsecurity, and let us not put our trust in politics and politicians.\r\nPolitics are so petty, and politicians so impotent. How many so-called\r\nstatesmen are there to-day who have the courage of their convictions,\r\nand who would not be carried away by the impulses and emotions of the\r\nmoment?\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nSuch were the weighty words of the European statesman. They were\r\nuttered without animus and without passion. They were uttered with the\r\nserene detachment of the philosopher and of the experienced man of the\r\nworld. And they express the deliberate opinions of a confirmed\r\npacifist. And they express the substantial truth.\r\n\r\nIt would be well if our German friends would ponder and meditate those\r\nsober and sobering utterances. It would be well if they would try and\r\ngive their own explanation of their tragic isolation and of their\r\nuniversal political unpopularity. It would be well if they in turn\r\nwould ask themselves why political Germany is left without a friend in\r\nthe wide world? As Maximilian Harden once said: \"Uns lebt kein Freund\r\nauf der weiten Welt.\" Might not the result of such sobering\r\nreflections be to induce the Germans to turn over a new leaf? Might it\r\nnot help to precipitate the downfall of a medieval military\r\nbureaucracy? And might it not help to falsify the ominous prophecy of\r\nour European statesman that Prussia will more and more control the\r\npolitics of the German Empire?\r\n\r\nWe loved the glorious Germany of the past. Let the Germany of\r\nto-morrow make herself again as cordially liked as she is feared\r\nto-day. But let her understand that no nation will allow herself to\r\nbe bullied into sympathy. Sympathy must be spontaneous. In the words\r\nof one of her greatest thinkers: \"Die Liebe ist wie der Glaube, man\r\nkann sie nicht erzwingen\" (Love is like Faith. You cannot secure it by\r\nforce).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nRUSSIA AND GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe complicated and contradictory relations between Russia and Germany\r\ncan be summed up very briefly. On the one hand, there existed before\r\nthe war the closest intercourse between the Russian and the German\r\nCourts, and that close intercourse extended to the army, to the\r\nbureaucracy, to the Universities, to the industrial and commercial\r\nclasses. On the other hand, the Russian and the German people are\r\nmutually repelled. There is a temperamental antagonism between the two\r\nnations, between the dour disciplined Prussian and the easygoing\r\ndisciplined Russian. In the province of ideas, of art and literature,\r\nFrench influence is dominant amongst the intellectual and in the upper\r\nclasses, but as literature counts for very little, and as trade and\r\nindustry, as the bureaucracy and the Court, count for a very great\r\ndeal, and as all these social and political forces hitherto were\r\nalmost entirely controlled by the Germans, it may be said that before\r\nthe war German influence was supreme in the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nUntil Peter the Great, the Romanov Family was a national dynasty. It\r\nhad remained national from sheer necessity, as no European Court would\r\nhave cared to intermarry with Tatar and Barbarian Princes. Even at the\r\nend of Peter the Great's reign the prestige of Russia had scarcely\r\nasserted itself in the politics of the West. Peter the Great expressed\r\na keen desire to pay a visit to the Court of Louis XIV. He was\r\npolitely given to understand that his visit would not be acceptable,\r\neven as a poor relation will be told that his visit is not welcome to\r\na kinsman in exalted position. After the death of Louis, the Tsar\r\nagain asked to be received at Versailles. This time his overtures were\r\naccepted, but even at the Court of the Regent his visit caused the\r\ngreatest embarrassment to the masters of ceremonies. The situation was\r\na tragi-comic one. French etiquette could not decide whether the Tatar\r\nPrince was to receive the honours which belong of right only to the\r\nruler of a civilized people.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in modern Russian history, Peter the Great's\r\ndaughter, Anne, married a German Prince in 1725. With that year begins\r\nthat close dynastic alliance with the German Courts which has lasted\r\nuntil our own day. Germany has been carrying on a most thriving export\r\ntrade of Princes and Princesses with almost every European\r\nmonarchy--an export trade of which she is reaping the enormous\r\npolitical advantages in the present crisis. But in Russia alone she\r\nhas obtained a monopoly of this royal export trade. _All the Russian\r\nTsars have married German Princesses._ For one hundred and fifty years\r\nthe rule suffered no exception until Alexander II. married a daughter\r\nof the Danish Dynasty, which itself is in reality the German Dynasty\r\nof Oldenburg.\r\n\r\nI need not emphasize the supreme importance of those close family\r\nrelations between the Courts of Russia and Germany, _and especially\r\nbetween the Courts of Russia and Prussia_. It is the peculiarity of an\r\nautocratic government that the smallest causes are productive of the\r\ngreatest consequences, and amongst those smaller causes none are\r\nlikely to produce more far-reaching results than the personal likes\r\nand dislikes of the ruler and his family. In the Empire of the Tsars\r\nthe sympathies of the ruler and of the Imperial family for a hundred\r\nand fifty years have generally been German. Women have no less\r\ninfluence in Russia than in other countries, and as every Russian\r\nPrincess has, for a hundred and fifty years, been German in origin,\r\nGerman by training, German by pride of birth, German by prejudice, the\r\nTeutonic influences have necessarily been supreme in the Russian\r\nCourt. Nor must we forget that every German Princess coming to\r\nPetrograd would bring with her a numerous suite of ladies-in-waiting\r\nand Court officials, so that the German Court colony was automatically\r\nincreasing. Indeed, it is no mere chance that the capital, the\r\nmilitary harbour, and the chief Imperial residences should all have\r\nGerman names--Kronstadt, Oranienbaum, Schluessenburg, Petersburg, and\r\nPeterhof. Peterhof has been the Russian Potsdam. Petersburg has been\r\nthe outpost of Germany in the Russian Empire, the _feste Burg_ of\r\nPrussia until the eve of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it is obvious that the national Romanov\r\nDynasty, founded in 1613 by Michael Romanov, Patriarch of all the\r\nRussias, ceased to be a Romanov Dynasty at the death of Empress\r\nElizabeth in 1761. With Peter III. it is a German Dynasty which\r\nascends the throne. Peter III., son of a Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, is\r\na Romanov in the proportion of one-half; Paul, son of a Princess of\r\nAnhalt-Zerbst, in the proportion of one-fourth; Alexander I. and\r\nNicholas I., sons of a Princess of Würtemberg, in the proportion of\r\none-eighth; Alexander II., son of a Princess of Hohenzollern, to the\r\nextent of one-sixteenth; Alexander III., son of a Grand Duchess of\r\nHesse-Darmstadt, to the extent of one thirty-second; and the late\r\nruler, Nicholas II., who married a Princess of the House of Oldenburg,\r\nto the extent of one sixty-fourth. One sixty-fourth of the blood of\r\nthe late Tsar is Russian Romanov blood. In the proportion of\r\nsixty-three sixty-fourths it is the blood of Holstein, of Anhalt, of\r\nOldenburg, of Hesse, of Würtemberg, of Hohenzollern, which flows\r\nthrough the veins of the late Emperor of all the Russias.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nThe history of Russia proves only too conclusively that again and\r\nagain the national interests of Russia have been sacrificed to the\r\nGerman dynastic influences. At the end of the Seven Years' War,\r\nFrederick the Great was at his last gasp. Prussia was on the verge of\r\nruin. _The Russian Army had entered Berlin_; the power of the new\r\nmilitary monarchy had been totally broken at Kunersdorf. The death of\r\nElizabeth and the accession of her mad nephew, Peter III., retrieved a\r\ndesperate situation. For the mad nephew was a German Prince, a Duke of\r\nHolstein, and a passionate admirer of Frederick the Great. Peter III.\r\nwas murdered in 1762. He only reigned a few months, but he reigned\r\nsufficiently long to save Prussia from destruction and to surrender\r\nall the advantages secured by Russian triumphs and dearly paid for by\r\nRussian blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThere is no more fantastic fairy-tale and there is no more fascinating\r\ndrama than the life-story of Catherine the Great, which recently has\r\nbeen so brilliantly told by Mr. Francis Gribble. A Cinderella amongst\r\nGerman royalties, a pauper Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, Catherine became\r\nthe mightiest potentate of her age. Although the nominee of Frederick\r\nthe Great, she pursued consistently a national Russian policy. And she\r\nhad good reasons for doing so. For no throne was less secure than the\r\nthrone of the Romanovs. She had had to remove her husband by murder\r\nfor fear of being removed herself. She continued to be surrounded by a\r\nrabble of unscrupulous adventurers and intriguers. Her only safety lay\r\nin becoming a patriotic Russian, and in seeking the support of Russian\r\nsentiment and Russian opinion. Whilst Frederick the Great surrounded\r\nhimself with French advisers, and contemptuously refused even to speak\r\nthe German language; whilst he declared to the German scholar who\r\npresented him with a copy of the \"Nibelungen Lied\" that this national\r\nGerman epic was not worth a pipe of tobacco, Catherine the Great\r\nsystematically encouraged Russian literature. Whilst Frederick the\r\nGreat remained the consistent Atheist on the throne, Catherine the\r\nGreat professed the utmost zeal for Russian Orthodoxy. All through her\r\nreign she avoided as far as possible a conflict with Frederick and his\r\nsuccessor. She divided with them the spoils of Poland, or, as\r\nFrederick the Great put it in his edifying theological language, she\r\npartook of the Eucharistic body of the Polish kingdom in unholy\r\ncommunion with Prussia and Austria. But Catherine saw to it that\r\nRussia secured the greater part of the spoils.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious and uncanny similarity between the character and\r\nthe reign of Peter III. and the character and reign of his son, Paul\r\nI. Both reigns were brief, yet both reigns had an incalculable\r\ninfluence on European affairs. Both rulers sacrificed national\r\ninterests to dynastic interests. Both rulers were insane, and both\r\nrulers engaged in insane enterprises. Both father and son were\r\nmurdered with the complicity or connivance of their own family. The\r\nRussian armies, on the advent of Peter III., had secured and achieved\r\na dramatic victory over Prussia, but the admiration of Peter III. for\r\nFrederick the Great prevented the Russians from reaping the fruits of\r\nvictory. Suvoroff crossed the Alps and achieved an equally sensational\r\nvictory over France, but Paul I. was prevented from taking advantage\r\nof his victories by his admiration for Napoleon.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Alexander I. once more strikingly illustrates the\r\nenormous part which subterranean German influences have played in the\r\nforeign policy of Russia. After the costly victories of Eylau and\r\nFriedland, Napoleon I. had concluded with Alexander I. the Peace of\r\nTilsit. The treaty was fatal to Europe, for it divided the Continent\r\npractically between the Russian and French Empires. But it was highly\r\nadvantageous to Russia, and enormously added to Russian power and\r\nRussian prestige.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly in Russia's interest to maintain the Alliance. It was\r\nbroken largely through one of those small dynastic incidents which are\r\nof such vast importance under an absolute despotism. One of Napoleon's\r\nmain objects was to establish a Napoleonic Dynasty and to be adopted\r\nby marriage into one of the ruling families of Europe. The Corsican\r\nparvenu passionately desired a matrimonial alliance with the House of\r\nRomanov, and repeatedly applied for the hand of one of Alexander's\r\nsisters; the dowager Tsarina, Alexander's mother, a daughter of the\r\nKing of Würtemberg, as persistently refused. She had all the pride of\r\nbirth of a German Princess, and all the hatred of a reactionary\r\nagainst the armed soldier of the Revolution. Foiled at the Court of\r\nPetersburg, Napoleon was more successful at the Court of Vienna. A few\r\nmonths after Napoleon's last overtures had been rejected by Russia,\r\nthe Habsburgs, who, after the Bourbons, were the most august, the most\r\nancient dynasty of Europe, eagerly accepted what the Romanovs had\r\nrefused. The war of 1812 with Russia was the result of that pro-German\r\npolicy of the Russian Court.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nDuring the reigns of Nicholas I. and Alexander II. the German-Austrian\r\ninfluence reached its zenith at the Court of Petersburg. Nicholas I.\r\nwas the brother-in-law of the Prussian Hohenzollern. An able and an\r\nhonest man in his private relations, he was in his political capacity\r\na Prussian martinet, as even Treitschke is compelled to admit, and he\r\norganized his Empire on the strictest Frederician principles. The\r\nCourt, the Army, and the bureaucracy were Prussianized as they had\r\nnever been before. A German bureaucrat, Nesselrode, who could not even\r\nspeak the Russian language, for forty years controlled as Foreign\r\nMinister the policy of the Russian Empire. Even as his grandfather,\r\nPeter III., even as his brother, Alexander I., had saved Prussia from\r\ndestruction, so Nicholas I. saved Austria from a similar fate. Francis\r\nJoseph had ascended a throne shaken to its foundations. Hungary was in\r\nopen rebellion. The young Austrian Emperor appealed to Russia for\r\nhelp. Nicholas I. sent an army to quell the revolution, and\r\nestablished his cousin on the Hungarian throne. It is unnecessary to\r\nadd that Francis Joseph was as loyal and as grateful to Russia as\r\nFrederick the Great had been!\r\n\r\nAlexander I. had refused to accept Napoleon I. as a brother-in-law.\r\nEven so did Nicholas I. refuse to recognize Napoleon III. as Emperor\r\nof the French. It was a gratuitous insult inspired by Prussia; it was\r\nopposed to Russian interests, and it was one of the main causes of the\r\nCrimean War.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nUnder Alexander II. the alliance of the three reactionary empires of\r\nCentral Europe was welded even more firmly than under his predecessor.\r\nBismarck, during his tenure of the Prussian Embassy at Petersburg, was\r\nthe chosen favourite of the Russian Court, and if he had chosen could\r\nhave become a Minister of the Tsar. An understanding with Russia\r\nbecame the chief dogma of his political creed, and it remained so\r\nuntil the end. It was Bismarck's adherence to the Russian-Prussian\r\nAlliance which was one of the causes of his dismissal.\r\n\r\nAlexander II. did nothing to guard against the German peril. He might\r\nhave been the umpire of Central Europe, as Alexander I. had been fifty\r\nyears before. He demanded no compensation for the enormous accession\r\nof power and territory which Germany had received through the\r\nvictorious wars of 1863, 1866, and 1870. He insisted on no guarantees.\r\nWhen, after Sedan, Thiers came to St. Petersburg to obtain the\r\nintervention of the Russian Empire, he was dismissed with empty words.\r\nOne year after Thiers's fruitless journey, Emperor William paid an\r\nofficial visit to his nephew Alexander II., and the Tsar once more\r\nproclaimed the indissoluble solidarity of Russia with Germany. Until\r\nthe end of his reign the German-Austrian-Russian Alliance, the famous\r\ndynastic Alliance of the Three Emperors, remained the keystone of\r\nEuropean policy and the mainstay of Russian reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nThe influence of Germany at the Russian Court was strengthened by the\r\ninfluence of Germany on the Russian bureaucracy. An agricultural\r\ncommunity without a middle class, Russia has had to recruit her Civil\r\nServices almost entirely from the outside and mainly from Germany, and\r\nmore especially from the German Baltic provinces of Esthonia, Livonia,\r\nand Courland. Teutonic barons from those Baltic provinces have filled\r\nthe higher ranks of the Diplomatic Service and of the Civil Service\r\nfor a hundred and fifty years. The Russian Tsars found the German\r\nbarons far more serviceable tools than the Russian boiars. In a\r\nprevious age one Emperor after another had been removed by a\r\nrebellious aristocracy. The highest nobles in the land had been\r\nimplicated in the Decabrist conspiracy at the end of Alexander I.'s\r\nreign. Even under Alexander II. there were always a few members of the\r\nnobility to be found as accomplices in the revolutionary plots. But\r\nthere never was one single German from the Baltic provinces implicated\r\nin a conspiracy against reaction. It is easy to understand, therefore,\r\nwhy a Russian autocrat should have preferred the services of the\r\nGerman Baltic barons. The Russian nobleman is casual, lavish, a bad\r\neconomist, easygoing, generous, and he is corrupt because easygoing\r\nand generous. He is also much more independent. The Junker is\r\npunctual, precise, disciplined, generally poor, always ambitious. He\r\nis also tolerably honest. He is the ideal bureaucrat.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nGerman influence has been no less dominant in the Russian academies\r\nand in scientific institutions. The Academy of Sciences of St.\r\nPetersburg was organized on the pattern of the Academy of Berlin. It\r\nwas an official institution with high privileges, and it remained\r\nconsistently German. Until recently its proceedings were published in\r\nthe German language, and German scientists were invariably preferred\r\nrather than Russian scientists. Mendelieff, one of the most creative\r\nscientific minds of his generation, was a member of every European\r\nacademy except the Academy of Petersburg.\r\n\r\nThe Germans have been an even greater power in the Russian\r\nUniversities. They took full advantage of the prestige which German\r\nscience had acquired in Europe, and they largely filled the ranks of\r\nthe liberal professions. German doctors, German veterinary surgeons,\r\nGerman _Feldschers_, German foresters, German engineers, were to be\r\nfound in every part of the Empire. A casual reading of the Post Office\r\ndirectories of Moscow, or Petersburg, or Kiev, provides a most\r\ninstructive commentary on the extent of the German domination.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nSecurely entrenched in the Russian Court, in the Army, in the\r\nbureaucracy, in the Universities, in the Diplomatic Service, the\r\nGermans secured a no less commanding influence in trade and industry.\r\nAs we have already pointed out, Russia, until recent years, had\r\nremained an agricultural country without a middle class. The trade\r\nremained almost entirely in foreign hands. Already in the Middle Ages\r\nRussian cities, like Novgorod, were affiliated to the German Hanseatic\r\nLeague. In the sixteenth century adventurous English explorers and\r\ntraders, whose exploits are amongst the most thrilling of Hakluyt's\r\nvoyages, tried to oust their German competitors, but they utterly\r\nfailed. The Russians themselves are excellent traders, and the\r\nmerchant guilds of Moscow have been for centuries a powerful\r\ncommercial organization. Even to-day you will meet in Moscow\r\nunassuming Russian merchants leading the simplest of lives and\r\npossessed of enormous wealth. But the Russian merchant is generally\r\nconservative, un-enterprising, a bad linguist, and servilely attached\r\nto ancient usages. He is scarcely a match for the foreigner. In recent\r\nyears British and Belgian traders as well as Jews and Armenians have\r\nshared in the enormous trade of the Russian Empire, _but the Germans\r\nhave secured the lion's share_.\r\n\r\nAnd what is true of Russian trade is equally true of Russian industry.\r\nThe liberal economic policy of Witte has created in one generation\r\npowerful industrial centres in Central Russia, and especially in\r\nPoland. Here, again, the Germans have benefited more than all their\r\ncompetitors together. Lodz, the \"Manchester of Russian Poland,\" has\r\nceased to be either Polish or Russian, and has become a German\r\nmanufacturing town. Caprivi, Bismarck's successor, negotiated with the\r\nRussian Government a treaty of commerce which gave enormous advantages\r\nto German industry, and if the German Government had continued to show\r\nthe wisdom of Bismarck and Caprivi, Germany would certainly have\r\nprofited more than any other country by the commercial expansion of\r\nthe Russian Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nIt might have been expected that a German influence so absolutely\r\nsupreme in every sphere of society, in every walk of life, should have\r\nextended to the lower classes. But the common people were never\r\naffected by German methods and remained untainted by the German\r\nspirit. To the Russian moujik, the German remained the _Niemets_, the\r\nmute, the alien enemy. The Russian peasant, with his simple ways and\r\nhis child-like faith, a mystic and an idealist, has an instinctive\r\nantipathy to the modern Prussian, who is an implacable realist,\r\nselfish, calculating, and aggressive. The persistence with which the\r\nRussian people have resisted and escaped Prussian influence is not the\r\nleast convincing proof of the soundness of the Slav character.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nWe have seen German influence supreme in the province of the\r\npractical, the tangible, the useful. It is all the more remarkable\r\nthat it should be insignificant in the sphere of the ideal and of the\r\nbeautiful. In Art and Literature the influence of Germany has been\r\npurely superficial, although the beautiful Russian language has often\r\nbeen spoiled by the influence of a cumbrous German syntax. With the\r\nexception of Nietzsche, no German writer has left his mark on Russian\r\nliterature. The literary influence of Great Britain has been much more\r\nextensive, and has grown enormously during the last generation. But it\r\nis the literature of France which has been the dominant factor in the\r\nliterary life of modern Russia. The fascination of French culture has\r\nbeen as old as Russian culture. Catherine II. was the friend of\r\nDiderot and Voltaire, and herself translated French masterpieces into\r\nRussian. The French language has been the language of diplomacy and\r\nsociety. Readers of \"War and Peace\" will remember how the noblemen of\r\nthe Petersburg salons denounced the French usurper in the language of\r\nVoltaire.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\nWe have sufficiently proved that Germany has been a formidable factor\r\nin the whole past history of the Russian Empire. We may hope that\r\nafter the war German influence will be a thing of the past. After the\r\nwar it is not German political ideas and German institutions, but\r\nFrench and British ideas and institutions which will mould the\r\ndestinies of the Russian Empire. The elective affinities between the\r\nRussian democracy and the French and British democracies will assert\r\nthemselves and will eliminate the mischievous and reactionary\r\ninfluence of Germany.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how entirely German power has been artificial and imposed\r\nfrom above, how it has been the outcome of the dynastic connection.\r\n_But in the meantime the German influence supreme before the war still\r\nsubsists and still constitutes a danger which it would be extremely\r\nunwise and unstatesmanlike to ignore or to under-rate._ We must\r\ntherefore guard ourselves, so that when the day of settlement comes\r\nthe subtle and subterranean German forces shall not make themselves\r\nfelt, and that the Teutonic Monarchies shall be frustrated in their\r\nsupreme effort to retain a power which has been so fatal to the\r\nliberties of Europe and to the free development of the Russian\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE PEACEMAKER OF GERMANY: PRINCE BERNHARD VON BÜLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nIn the year of grace 1878, after the great Turkish-Russian war, a\r\nyoung and unknown Prussian diplomat of twenty-nine years of age called\r\nBernhard von Bülow found himself, as assistant to his father, the\r\nForeign Secretary of the German Empire, suddenly summoned to\r\nco-operate in the making of a new Europe. In the same year, on the\r\nsame arena, an equally unknown young Scotch politician called Arthur\r\nJames Balfour, born in the same year, 1849, also found himself, as\r\nassistant to his uncle, Lord Salisbury, Foreign Secretary of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, unexpectedly chosen to play the identical part of an\r\ninternational peacemaker. And now, after a lapse of thirty-eight\r\nyears, the two erstwhile Secretaries of the Congress of Berlin, to-day\r\nthe only surviving statesmen of that momentous crisis, Prince von\r\nBülow and Mr. Arthur James Balfour, are about to meet in another\r\nEuropean Congress, and be called upon once more to recast the map of\r\nthe world. But this time the Scotsman and the German will meet no more\r\nas Allies working out a common policy. They will meet as the leading\r\nchampions of hostile and irreconcilable world policies, united only in\r\na joint endeavour to undo the evil work of Bismarck and Beaconsfield\r\nwhich claimed to bring to Europe \"peace with honour,\" and which\r\nultimately brought Europe nothing but war with dishonour.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nPrince von Bülow's whole career has been one steady and rapid ascent\r\nto high office and exalted honour. Before his fall he had earned the\r\nwell-deserved nickname of \"Bernhard the Lucky.\" He seemed to have\r\nfound in his cradle all the gifts of the fairies. His most striking\r\ncharacteristic is an amazing and totally un-German versatility and\r\nresourcefulness. As a soldier he volunteered in the Franco-German War,\r\nand retired from service as a Prussian Lieutenant. As a diplomat he\r\nhas occupied responsible positions in every capital of Europe except\r\nLondon, and the exception, by the way, is probably the reason why he\r\nhas always been less familiar with the English mind than with the\r\nContinental mind. An unrivalled Parliamentary tactician as well as a\r\npersuasive Parliamentary orator, he managed with even more than the\r\nskill of Mr. Asquith or Mr. Balfour the most unmanageable\r\nrepresentative assembly of the Continent, and for twelve years he\r\nplayed off one against the other the ten or more parties of the\r\nReichstag. As Fourth Chancellor of the New German Empire he has been\r\nassociated with all the leading measures of the \"new course,\" and he\r\nsucceeded for ten years in retaining the confidence and affectionate\r\nregard of the most fickle and most despotic of masters. A man of the\r\nworld and a patron of learning and art, he has enlisted all the graces\r\nand amenities of social life in the service of his ambition.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nLike most of the men who have built up the Prussian power; like Stein,\r\nwho came from Nassau; like Moltke, who came from Denmark; like\r\nTreitschke, who came from Saxony, Prince von Bülow is not a Prussian.\r\nLike Blücher, his family originates from the Grand Duchy of\r\nMecklenburg, that strange paradise of a medieval and feudal\r\nJunkerthum. But, like most of the naturalized servants of the\r\nHohenzollern, von Bülow proved even more Prussian than any native of\r\nPomerania or Brandenburg. The son of one of Bismarck's trusted\r\nlieutenants, he always remained a loyal pupil of the Iron Chancellor.\r\nIt is significant that the first visit which Bülow paid on his\r\naccession to power was a visit to the fallen statesman. He was brought\r\nup on Bismarckian traditions and ideals. He is not a creative genius\r\nlike the hermit of Friedrichsruhe. He has been accused of being a\r\ntrimmer, but he was a trimmer like the great Lord Burleigh, always\r\nkeeping in mind the final goal to be reached. He had to work with\r\ndifferent materials and under conditions entirely different from those\r\nwhich prevailed under Bismarck. He had to embark on a _Weltpolitik_,\r\nwhereas Bismarck was content with a Continental policy. He had to\r\ninitiate the colonial and naval policy of William, while Bismarck\r\nsystematically kept clear of colonial ventures. But as far as\r\ncircumstances permitted, the \"new course\" of Bülow was but the\r\ncontinuation of the old course of Bismarck. Like Bismarck, he fought\r\nthe Socialists. Like Bismarck, he in turn fought and conciliated the\r\nClericals. Like Bismarck, he enforced in Poland the inexorable policy\r\nof expropriation and appropriation. Like Bismarck, he remained true to\r\nthe Austrian alliance. Like Bismarck, he tried to work in close\r\nco-operation with Russia, and tried to build up again the reactionary\r\nalliance of the three Central Empires. And in these many difficult\r\ntasks, which had become much more difficult even than in the\r\n'seventies or 'eighties, Bülow was as little hampered as his\r\npredecessor by any moral principles or scruples. He proved even more\r\nMachiavellian than his predecessor, adhering as steadfastly to the\r\nsame implacable realism.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBut, if Prince von Bülow has revealed the same aims and is imbued with\r\nthe same political philosophy as Bismarck, he has tried to attain his\r\nend by very different means. He has none of the cynical sincerity of\r\nhis master. Bismarck carried into diplomacy the directness and\r\nbrutality of the soldier. Bülow introduced into politics the tortuous\r\npractices of Italy. He reminds one of Cavour much more than of the\r\nmaster-builder of German unity. Whilst Bismarck won his spurs in the\r\nembassies of Germany and Russia, Bülow received his main training as\r\nAmbassador in Latin countries. He served for five years in Paris. In\r\nBucharest he imbibed the Byzantine influences of the East. He spent\r\nsix years in the Eternal City, which for three thousand years has been\r\nthe centre of statecraft, and which even to-day remains the best\r\ntraining-school of diplomacy. His marriage with an Italian Princess is\r\nanother indication of the natural affinities of his temperament, and\r\nan additional proof that he constitutionally preferred the subtle\r\nmethods of Rome to the more brutal methods of Brandenburg. Bismarck\r\nwas always using threats which he had no intention of carrying out.\r\nBülow is equally fond of using promises which he is as little disposed\r\nto fulfil. Bismarck was always showing the mailed fist. Bülow prefers\r\nto show the velvet glove. Bismarck wielded the sword of the berserker.\r\nBülow prefers the rapier of the fencer. Bismarck was stern, irascible,\r\nuncontrolled, titanic, and his whole career was one long and hard\r\nstruggle against bitter enemies. Bülow was ever amiable, courteous,\r\nsmiling, suave, patient, elusive. He managed equally to conciliate the\r\nKaiser and Bismarck, Herr Harden and the _Kölnische Volkszeitung_, the\r\nCatholics and the Jews, the industrials and the agrarians. When the\r\nhour of disfavour came, Bismarck retired with his mastiffs among the\r\npine-woods of Lauenburg, nursing his rancour and revenge. Bülow\r\nretired with quiet and graceful dignity among the statues and the\r\nflowers of the Villa Malta.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nIn no other aspect of his versatile career did Prince von Bülow show\r\nmore resourcefulness than in his skilful handling of the Press. He was\r\nthe first German statesman who knew how to discipline and to exploit\r\npublic opinion in the interests of Imperial policy. It is true that\r\nalready Bismarck had made frequent use of the Press as an instrument\r\nof government, as is abundantly shown by his close association with\r\nLothar Bucher, with his famulus Moritz Busch, and with Maximilian\r\nHarden. But Bismarck, whilst using the journalists, profoundly\r\ndespised them, with the result that \"Bismarck's Reptile Press\" became\r\na byword in Europe. Under Bülow's régime the humble pressman rose to\r\ninfluence and affluence and basked in Ministerial favour. With the\r\nassistance of Mr. Hammann, Prince von Bülow made the Berlin Press\r\nBureau a sinister power in Europe as well as in Germany; for the\r\nChancellor was as anxious to conciliate the foreign journalist as the\r\nGerman. M. Huret sang his praises in the _Figaro_. Even the\r\narch-Germanophobe Monsieur André Tardieu was coaxed into writing a\r\nwhole volume of panegyric on the irresistible Chancellor. Before the\r\ncaprice of his Imperial master sent him into premature retirement,\r\nBülow had succeeded in marshalling all the intellectual forces of the\r\nGerman Empire. Whilst Bismarck had frittered away his energies\r\nquarrelling with von Virchow, with Windhorst, and with the professors\r\nof the National Liberal party, Bülow had managed to make the shining\r\nluminaries of the Universities, the Harnacks, the Schmollers, and the\r\nDernburgs, into the most enthusiastic advocates of his policy.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nThere are few more bewildering subjects to the student of politics\r\nthan the many concatenations of events which brought about the present\r\nworld catastrophe. If that fateful interview had not been published in\r\nthe _Daily Telegraph_, there would have been no political hurricane in\r\nGermany. If there had been no hurricane, Prince von Bülow would not\r\nhave fallen from power. If Prince von Bülow had not fallen from power,\r\nthere would probably have been no world war. It is certain that\r\nBülow's retirement from office in 1909 was a disaster to the German\r\nEmpire. It is equally certain that his return to office in 1914 and\r\nhis peace mission to Italy was an ominous danger to Europe. And it is\r\nalso certain that he will be even more dangerous to Europe in the\r\neventful days to come when he will be called back to office, and be\r\nonce more the leader and spokesman of German policy. In the future\r\nCongress which will liquidate the world war Bülow will be the greatest\r\nasset of the enemy. In the Congress of Berlin Bismarck, towering like\r\na giant, dictated his policy to subservient Europe. The day of German\r\nhegemony is past, and no German plenipotentiary will be able again to\r\nimpose his will by the same methods. But the resources of diplomacy\r\nwill be all the more necessary to the German Empire in the future\r\nsettlement, and of the art of diplomacy Bülow is perhaps the greatest\r\nmaster that the world has seen since the days of Talleyrand. It is\r\nhighly doubtful whether there is any statesman amongst the Allies who\r\npossesses to the same extent those special characteristics which will\r\nwin victory in the international arena. If high moral ideals and\r\nperfect political integrity were the qualities most valuable to the\r\ndiplomatist, Viscount Grey and Mr. Balfour would be more than a match\r\nfor Prince von Bülow; but if an intimate knowledge of the European\r\nchess-board and of the psychology of European politics, if infinite\r\nwit, if nimbleness and ingenuity, are the qualities which are likely\r\nto decide the issue, Prince von Bülow will prove indeed a formidable\r\nopponent. It is almost inevitable that the European Powers shall enter\r\nthe future Congress with different aims and with divergent policies.\r\nAnd one needs be no prophet to predict that it will be Bülow's object\r\nto play off one Power against another; even as for twenty years he\r\nplayed off one party against another in the Reichstag, so he will play\r\noff Serbia against Italy, and Italy against France, and Russia against\r\nEngland. In those unavoidable conflicting interests of the belligerent\r\nPowers Bülow will seek his opportunity. It will be for the Allies to\r\nforesee and to forestall the danger. Let the Allies enter the Congress\r\nwith a clearly defined and settled policy. Let them compose their\r\ndifferences before they meet their opponents. Then, but only then,\r\nwill there be no scope for the uncanny virtuosity of Prince von Bülow.\r\nOnly on those terms will Viscount Grey and Jules Cambon and Sasonov\r\ndefeat the manoeuvres of the Italianized Prussian Machiavelli and\r\nfrustrate the hopes of \"Bernhard the Lucky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE SILENCE OF HERR VON BETHMANN-HOLLWEG\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHerr von Bethmann-Hollweg is to-day the most tragic figure amongst the\r\nstatesmen of Europe. For three years he has borne a crushing burden, a\r\nburden which even Bismarck, the man of blood, was unable to bear in\r\nthe piping days of peace; a burden from which the Iron Chancellor had\r\nto seek periodical liberation amidst the heather and the pine-forests\r\nof his native Brandenburg. As Prime Minister of Prussia, as Chancellor\r\nof the German Empire, as Foreign Secretary of the Teutonic Alliance,\r\nhe has to keep a firm grip of all the threads, both of internal and of\r\nexternal policy. Distracted between Catholics and Protestants, between\r\nagrarians and industrials, between Germany and Austria, he has been\r\nmade responsible for all the blunders of his subordinates. A rich man,\r\nand the scion of an historic house, he has led the life of a\r\ngalley-slave; an honest man, he has been doomed to perpetual\r\nprevarication; a humane man, he has had to condone every atrocity; an\r\nindependent man, he must cringe before his master; a peaceful man, he\r\nmust submit to the continuation of insensate slaughter; a highly\r\ngifted intellectual, he has had to pursue a policy of insane\r\nstupidity. Twenty-five years ago a professor of the University of\r\nMunich, Dr. Quidde, compared the Kaiser to Caligula. The analogy\r\nbetween William and Caligula or Nero points to another analogy, that\r\nbetween Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg and Seneca, the ill-fated counsellor\r\nof the Cæsars. Read in the _Annals_ of Tacitus the speech of Seneca to\r\nNero, and you will perhaps understand the position of Herr von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg in the Imperial Palace of Potsdam.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe internal political crisis in Germany, which started at the\r\nbeginning of last autumn, has come to a head because the Chancellor\r\nwill not speak out. There was a time when political crises in Germany\r\nwere due, not to the silence of the German rulers, but to their\r\nutterances and indiscretions. In recent months the Kaiser, the man of\r\nthe three hundred uniforms and of the three thousand speeches, has\r\ncommitted no such indiscretions as marked his reign from his ascent to\r\nthe throne; he has been almost as reticent as his unhappy father, who\r\ndid not speak because he had cancer in the throat. And now the\r\nsilver-tongued von Bethmann-Hollweg has also discovered the political\r\nvirtue of silence. The people have been loudly clamouring for a few\r\nwords of comfort, but above the thunder of the distant guns we only\r\nhear the scribblers of a servile Press, who are beating the air with\r\ntheir croakings.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nWhy this ominous, obstinate, sphinx-like silence of the Chancellor,\r\nmore pregnant with meaning than the most eloquent speeches? It would\r\nbe so easy for so resourceful a man to utter a few oracular sentences,\r\na few ambiguous phrases, a few patriotic trumpet-calls. Was not the\r\nlast great speech which he delivered in the Reichstag covered with\r\nfrantic applause? But the days are past for ambiguous utterances,\r\nhowever patriotic, however oracular. The Chancellor knows that any\r\nclear, outspoken utterance on the peace aims of the German Government\r\nwould seal the doom of the Government; he knows that any statement of\r\nterms would reveal the glaring discrepancy between those terms and the\r\nsolemn promises so often made to the German people. The people still\r\npassionately believe in the promises and assurance of an early and\r\nfinal victory. Only such a belief is still sustaining the drooping\r\nspirits of the nation, only such an assurance enables them to submit\r\nto the starvation of their women and children, to their tragic\r\nisolation in a hostile world, to the appalling sacrifices on the\r\nbattlefield.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nAnd now the conspiracy of lies and the conspiracy of silence is about\r\nto be exposed. The inexorable truth must be proclaimed. The German\r\npresent is dark, but the future is desperate. The U-boat campaign has\r\nfailed, the hope of a separate peace with Russia has vanished, the\r\nmenace of America is drawing near. Greater exertions and more\r\nappalling sacrifices are needed, and yet all the motives for further\r\nsacrifices have vanished. The rulers were fighting for conquest and\r\nplunder. But it is now obvious that there can be no conquest nor\r\nplunder. The German people were misled into the belief that they were\r\nstruggling in self-defence against the \"Slav peril,\" but since the\r\nIdes of March in Petrograd the Russian bugbear has disappeared. They\r\nwere misled into the belief that they were struggling for liberty. But\r\nthe Germans are now the only people still deprived of political\r\nliberty. Even the much-despised Slav has ceased to be a slave. The\r\nonly slaves in Europe to-day are the subjects of the Hohenzollern.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThis German war has been described as a tragedy of Prussian craft and\r\ngraft, and the Teuton rulers have been denounced rightly for their\r\ncruelty and brutality. But posterity would be more inclined to see in\r\nthis war a tragedy of German virtue. For the virtues of the German\r\nhave been more terrible than his vices. For this catastrophe has been\r\npossible, not because the German people are so wicked, but because\r\nthey have been so good, because they have practised too well the\r\n\"three\" theological virtues of blind faith, passive obedience, and\r\ninexhaustible patience; because they have been so pathetically loyal\r\nto their misrulers; because they have shown the sentimentality of a\r\nwoman and the credulity of a child. The German Michel has been the\r\npolitical Peter Pan of Europe, the boy that won't grow up. He has\r\nbeen the boy that has been let loose and has lit the match to the\r\npowder magazine. He has been the incurable romanticist who has\r\ncontinued to believe in fairy-tales in a world of stern realities. And\r\nnow this child-like faith in fairy-tales has been dispelled by\r\ndisaster. The vision of a holy German Empire, of the pomp and\r\ncircumstance of war, its glory and glamour, is shattered. The spell is\r\nbroken. The German Michel is awakening from his dreams. Walhalla is\r\nshaken to its foundation. Tor is ready with his hammer. Revolution is\r\nknocking at the door!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE COMING REVOLUTION IN GERMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nBoth French and British publicists have remained strangely silent and\r\nreticent on the problem and prospects of a revolution in Germany. It\r\nmay be that they are afraid to conjure up the ghost of political\r\nrebellion, lest that ghost might cause havoc in other countries than\r\nGermany. It may also be that they are unwilling to tackle a very\r\ncomplex and delicate question. Yet the more we consider the problem,\r\nthe more central, the more vital it will appear. German policy, German\r\ndiplomacy, German strategy, are now entirely dominated by the dread of\r\na social upheaval. Measures which might seem to be dictated solely by\r\nmilitary considerations are in reality imposed by the necessity of\r\ndeceiving and distracting public opinion and of striking the popular\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nAnd this obsession of an impending revolution is fully justified. To\r\nthe outside view the war may seem above all a conflict of nations,\r\ninvolving a reconstruction of the map of Europe, raising international\r\nissues and resulting in a new international order. But in reality the\r\nconflict is concerned with national and internal issues, and it must\r\nresult in a new national order. If this war has not been fought in\r\nvain, if we are to achieve the objects for which we entered it, if we\r\nare ultimately to crush German militarism, which is only a vague and\r\nconfusing synonym for German reaction, then it inexorably follows that\r\nthe war must end in a German revolution. The road to peace must indeed\r\npass through Berlin, but that Berlin will have ceased to be the Berlin\r\nof the Junkers--it must be the insurrectionary Berlin of 1848. Just as\r\nthere can be no real war of attrition in the struggle between Germany\r\nand Europe, so there can be no war of attrition in the struggle\r\nbetween the German people and despotism. As there could be no\r\ncompromise or surrender of principles before, there can be no\r\ncompromise and no surrender after. On the conclusion of peace, it must\r\ncome to a final trial of strength between the rulers and their\r\nsubjects, between the masses and the classes. The issues must be\r\nfought out in a decisive battle. Even though we achieve a crushing\r\nmilitary victory, militarism would not be crushed if the Hohenzollern\r\nwere still able to command the allegiance of a still patient and\r\npassive German people: just as Napoleonic militarism was not crushed\r\nat Waterloo and revived in 1849, because Napoleon still retained the\r\nallegiance of the French people. It is inconceivable that the German\r\nreactionaries will abdicate of their own free will. It is equally\r\ninconceivable that the reaction will develop slowly and gradually into\r\na free democratic government, as von Bethmann-Hollweg would make us\r\nbelieve in the historic speech of February 27. No doubt this war has\r\nhastened on the day of retribution. And the pathos of the war lies in\r\nthis, that it has been a vicarious sacrifice, and that millions of\r\nFrenchmen and Britons have died to prepare the liberation of a nation\r\nof slaves. _But ultimately it is the German people themselves who must\r\nwork out their own salvation._ They will have to turn against their\r\noppressors some of that combativeness, of that fanaticism, of that\r\nidealism, which hitherto they have only directed against their\r\nEuropean brethren.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nI stated at the outset that publicists have maintained a conspiracy of\r\nsilence on the coming German revolution, because they were afraid to\r\nconjure up a sinister spectre, and because they are repelled by a\r\ndifficult and delicate subject. But there may be another and a more\r\nplausible reason for their silence--namely, that most people simply\r\ncannot believe in the very possibility of a German revolution. And if\r\nyou press them to state their definite reasons for such a belief, you\r\nwill probably find that all the arguments given can ultimately be\r\nbrought under the four following headings:\r\n\r\n1. Militarism and reaction are too deeply rooted in Germany. The\r\nreactionary forces are far too strong to leave any chance to a\r\nsuccessful revolution.\r\n\r\n2. A revolution is impossible under modern conditions of warfare. A\r\nfew machine-guns, a few crack regiments of the Kaiser's bodyguard,\r\nwould at once drench the rebellion in rivers of blood.\r\n\r\n3. The Social Democrats, the so-called \"revolutionary party,\" have\r\nthemselves repudiated revolutionary methods.\r\n\r\n4. The German temperament has not the initiative, the resilience,\r\nwhich are the prime conditions of a successful revolution. The whole\r\nGerman historical tradition is against any revolutionary solution, and\r\nany radical reform must be imposed from outside.\r\n\r\nLet us carefully and dispassionately examine each of those arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIn the first place we are told that Prussian reaction is too strong,\r\nand that for the German people to attack the Hohenzollern stronghold\r\nwould be as hopeless as for a madman or a prisoner to break down the\r\nwalls of his prison or cell. The prisoner would only break his head,\r\nand the madman would only get himself put into a \"strait-waistcoat.\"\r\nThe German rebel is confronted by the impregnable structure of a solid\r\nand efficient Government, a Government based on the prestige of the\r\npast, and surrounded by the glamour of triumphant victories achieved\r\nin great national wars.\r\n\r\nThe argument might have been valid after 1863 and 1870, when the\r\nCatholics fought the battle of Liberalism and when the Social\r\nDemocrats fought the battle of democracy against Bismarck. But the\r\nargument ceases to be valid to-day. For this is not a national war for\r\nthe Germans. When the conspiracy of lies and the conspiracy of silence\r\ncome to an end, when the diplomatic intrigues, when the pan-Germanic\r\nplot, are revealed in their naked and hideous horror, it will be\r\nclear, even to the blindest and dullest German mind, that this war was\r\nwaged neither in defence of national existence nor in defence of\r\nnational interests. It began primarily as a war against Russia, who\r\nfor a hundred and fifty years was the close ally of Prussia. It began\r\nas a war against the Russian people, who were by far the best\r\ncustomers for German industries. It developed into a war against\r\nEngland, who, like Russia, was for one hundred and fifty years the\r\nally of Germany, who fought on many a battlefield with the Germans,\r\nwho never on any single battlefield fought against Germany.\r\n\r\nNeither can this war be described as a national war for the German\r\npeople, nor has it resulted in a German victory. Here, also, when the\r\nconspiracy of silence is broken, the net result of the war will prove\r\nto be universal ruin, bankruptcy, millions of cripples walking the\r\nstreets of every German city, the loss of the goodwill of the world.\r\n\"Tout est perdu sauf l'honneur,\" said the French King after the\r\ndisaster of Pavia. \"Everything is lost, even honour,\" will be the\r\nverdict of the German people after the war.\r\n\r\nIn so far, therefore, as Prussian reaction was hitherto based on the\r\nglamour of victory, that glamour is dispelled. The Hohenzollerns were\r\nsupposed to be the unsurpassed practitioners of _Realpolitik_. They\r\nhave only proved reckless and romantic visionaries. The Prussian\r\nGovernment was supposed to be a marvellously efficient instrument. Its\r\nefficiency has mainly shown itself in wanton destruction. The Prussian\r\nGovernment was supposed to be the perfect type of a stable\r\ngovernment. Its work of five hundred years has been destroyed in three\r\nyears. The Germans had sold their birthright to the Hohenzollern for a\r\nmess of pottage. They have lost their birthright, but they have not\r\nsecured the pottage. The German people had entered into tacit\r\ncontract. The rulers have broken the contract. The German people were\r\nready to surrender their personal liberty for the advantages which the\r\ncontract gave them. They preferred the security of despotism to the\r\nrisks of liberty. But the German people have discovered that the\r\nsecurity was illusory, that the advantages were negative, and that the\r\nrisks of despotism are infinitely greater than the perils of liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nBut, even granting that the prestige and glamour of the Hohenzollern\r\nMonarchy are dispelled, we shall be told that it does not necessarily\r\nfollow that a revolution would have any chances of success. For it may\r\nstill be objected that a revolution is impossible under modern\r\nconditions of warfare, that under those conditions all the advantages\r\nare with the Government and are not with the people, that it has\r\nbecome very much easier to-day than in a previous generation to stamp\r\nout a rebellion, and that the risks are very much greater.\r\n\r\nI believe that argument to be entirely fallacious. I do not believe\r\nthat the chances are with the Government. I believe that they are all\r\nthe other way. Modern conditions are more favourable to the prospects\r\nof a popular rising than they were, say, in 1789, in 1848, or in\r\n1871. In olden days armies did not side with the people. They were\r\nnon-national. They were professional. They were made up of\r\nmercenaries. The Swiss mercenaries allowed themselves to be massacred\r\nin defence of the monarchy. The Hessian mercenaries allowed themselves\r\nto be massacred in the service of the Hanoverian Kings. Nor had the\r\npeople any military training. To-day the armies are national armies.\r\nThey are the people themselves. They have received a military\r\ntraining. They have imbibed the military spirit. If only the people\r\ncan be gained over to the revolution, three-fourths of the battle is\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is essential that we should clearly understand\r\nthe fundamental differences between a foreign war and a civil war. A\r\nforeign war is a trial of strength between one nation in arms and\r\nanother nation in arms. A rebellion is a trial of strength between a\r\nnation and a Government. In a foreign war the armies will always be on\r\nthe side of the Government. In a revolution the armies may or may not\r\nside with the people. They will side with the people if the people are\r\ndetermined to fight.\r\n\r\nThe problem of revolution, therefore, is not primarily one of military\r\nforce, but of moral and political force. The people will dispose of\r\nthe necessary military strength if they dispose of the necessary moral\r\nand political strength. In normal times the people are generally\r\nunconscious of their moral and political strength, even as they are\r\nunconscious of their military strength. But in times of revolution,\r\nwith their political consciousness awakened by their grievances and\r\ntheir sufferings, with a quickened sense of political realities, the\r\nattitude of the people to their rulers undergoes a radical change.\r\nThey suddenly discover that they are the source of all power. Once\r\nthat revelation has come to them, and once the subjects refuse to\r\nsupport their rulers and are determined to resist them, the whole\r\nfabric of government collapses like a house of cards. There lies the\r\nreason for the fundamental differences between the slow development of\r\nforeign warfare and the sudden and catastrophic termination of civil\r\nwar. The Bastille fell as if by magic and as by a flourish of\r\ntrumpets, like the walls of Jericho. The Revolution of 1848 overthrew\r\nin twenty-four hours the strongest French Government of modern times.\r\nAnd there, also, lies the reason why, in a civil war, the greatest\r\npossible results are achieved with the minimum of sacrifice. To attain\r\nthe aims of a foreign war may require the sacrifice of millions of\r\nlives. The aims of a civil war have often been obtained by the\r\nsacrifice of a few hundred.\r\n\r\nAll revolutions have the same beginnings. The German Revolution of\r\n1848 started in the same way as the French Revolution of 1848. The\r\ninsurrection of the people of Berlin very nearly succeeded in 1848 in\r\nestablishing a German democracy. The proudest of the Prussian Kings,\r\nthe most intoxicated with the dreams or delusions of absolute power,\r\nwas humbled to the dust. In an agony of terror, bareheaded, Frederick\r\nWilliam IV. of Hohenzollern had to salute the funeral procession of\r\nthe heroes of liberty, and the King's army had to withdraw from\r\nBerlin, and Prince William, the future Emperor, had to escape to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nAnd the rising of the German people to-day will have a much better\r\nchance than in 1848. If it be indeed true that a few machine-guns may\r\ndecide the issue, it will be by no means difficult for the insurgent\r\npeople to secure possession of those machine-guns. If it be true that\r\na military training is essential to success, millions of Germans have\r\nreceived that training. Let only the merest fraction of the people\r\nraise the standard of rebellion, and let the spirit of rebellion be\r\nrife, and that spirit will spread like wild-fire, and the Hohenzollern\r\nMonarchy after this war will be brought to the ground like a decaying\r\ntree in a November gale.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nWe shall be told that if a revolution were such an easy task, it is\r\ninconceivable that the German people should not have risen before; and\r\nit is perfectly true that, since the bloody days of 1848, there has\r\nbeen no serious riot, not to mention any rebellion, in the German\r\nMonarchy. But the reason for this passive acquiescence in and for this\r\nservile surrender to despotism is due to the German revolutionaries\r\nthemselves. One of the secrets of recent German history is that the\r\nrevolutionists themselves have repudiated revolutionary methods. It is\r\nthe Social Democrats who deserted the cause of democracy. In France\r\nSocialists were pacifists abroad and aggressive at home. In Germany\r\nthe Socialists were pacifists at home and aggressive abroad.\r\n\r\nThat is why, as I anticipated in my \"Anglo-German Problem\" (1912), the\r\nGerman Socialists are ultimately responsible for the war, even more\r\nthan the Junkers. The Junkers and the Government knew that they had no\r\nreason to dread a renewal of 1848. They felt that they had a perfectly\r\nfree hand. They knew the temper of the Social Democrats and the\r\nmeaning of the Marxian creed. For it was an essential part of the\r\nGospel according to St. Marx that the revolution, if it ever came,\r\nwould come peacefully, inevitably, with the people raising their\r\nlittle finger, through the mere automatic pressure of economic\r\nconcentration. Capitalism itself, so the Socialists said, was working\r\nfor the triumph of Socialism. Once the process of concentration of\r\nproduction was complete, once all the capital was gathered in a few\r\nhands, the German revolution would come of itself, and Kaiser Bebel\r\nand Kaiser Liebknecht would simply substitute themselves for Kaiser\r\nWilliam as the rulers of an absolute collectivist State.\r\n\r\nThat attitude of passive acquiescence, that sordid materialistic\r\ncreed, explains the ignominious collapse of the Social Democrats at\r\nthe outbreak of the war. It explains the paradoxical fact that to-day\r\nvon Bethmann-Hollweg in his tragic isolation is only supported by\r\nScheidemann and the Socialist majority. The failure is not due to any\r\nlack of numbers. For the Social Democrats had millions of devoted\r\nfollowers. The failure is not due to lack of organization, for the\r\nSocial Democrats were the most admirably organized party known to\r\nmodern history. It was not due to lack of discipline, for the Social\r\nDemocrats were subjected to an iron discipline. The failure is\r\nentirely due to a lack of spirit, and the lack of spirit itself is\r\nentirely due to the sinister and dreary Marxian creed. Between Marxian\r\nSocialism and Prussianism there is no opposition of principles.\r\nIndeed, one might almost say that the present war socialism, with its\r\nbread rations, its organization of industry, its suppression of every\r\nindividual liberty, its hundred thousand regulations, is the nearest\r\napproach to the ideal of the Marxist.\r\n\r\nBut as the result of the war, that Gospel according to St. Marx is\r\ntotally and finally discredited. It is now admitted that the\r\nSocialists have been mere voting machines and doctrinaire\r\nopportunists. It is admitted that no democracy can be built with such\r\nignoble material. It is admitted that, relinquishing the servile and\r\nmaterialistic Socialism of Marx, we must revert to the heroic\r\nconception of the British, French, and Italian Revolutions. It is\r\nadmitted that the salvation of a people cannot be attained by the mere\r\nmumbling of catchwords and the waving of red flags; that it cannot be\r\nattained by the mere proclamation of an iron law of wages; that it can\r\nonly be achieved by the display of an iron courage and by miracles of\r\nheroism and self-sacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nBut again granting that the German Socialist creed is partly\r\nresponsible for the failure of German Democracy, it will be objected\r\nthat this creed is a typically German creed. Granting that the spirit\r\nof heroism and sacrifice is an essential condition of any successful\r\nrevolution, it will be objected that it is precisely this heroism\r\nwhich is lacking in the German temperament and in the German race. In\r\na famous passage of his \"Governance of England,\" Chancellor Fortescue,\r\nwho wrote about the time of the Wars of the Roses, comparing the large\r\nnumber of crimes of violence and burglary in England with the small\r\nnumber of such crimes in France and Scotland, concluded that neither\r\nthe French nor the Scotch had the courage and spirit to be burglars.\r\n\r\n\"It is not pouerte that kepith Ffrenchmen ffro rysinge, but it is\r\ncowardisse and lakke off hartes and corage, wich no Ffrenchman hath\r\nlike vnto a Englysh man. It hath been offten tymes sene in Englande,\r\nthat iij or iiij, theves ffor pouerte haue sett apon vj or vij trewe\r\nmen, and robbed hem all. But it hath not bene sene in Ffraunce, that\r\nvj. or vij. theves haue be hardy to robbe iij. or iiij. trewe men.\r\nWherfore it is right selde that Ffrenchmen be hanged ffor robbery and\r\nmanslaughter, then there be hanged in Ffraunce ffor such maner of\r\ncrime in vij yeres. There is no man hanged in Scotlande in vij yere to\r\ngedur ffor robbery. And yet thai ben often tymes hanged ffor larceny,\r\nand stelynge off good in the absence off the owner thereoff. But ther\r\nhartes serue hem not to take a manys gode, while he is present, and\r\nwoll defende it; wich maner off takynge is callid robbery. But the\r\nEnglysh man is off another corage. Ffor yff he be pouere, and see\r\nanother man havynge rychesse, wich may be taken ffrom hym be myght, he\r\nwill not spare to do so, but yff that pouere man be right trewe.\r\nWherfore it is not pouerte, but it is lakke off harte and cowardisse,\r\nthat kepith the Ffrenchmen ffro rysynge.\"\r\n\r\nThat \"lack of spirit\" which Lord Chancellor Fortescue so quaintly and\r\nso unjustly denounces in the French and Scottish temperaments, may it\r\nnot be more justly attributed to the German temperament? Are not the\r\nGermans constitutionally incapable of accomplishing a revolution? They\r\nlack the red corpuscles in their veins. They have no phosphorus or\r\nmercury in their composition. They have no élan, no resilience or\r\nvitality. They are strong, but only when they act gregariously, not\r\nwhen they act as free and irresponsible individuals. They can fight,\r\nbut only when they are driven, and only in a quarrel which is not\r\ntheir own. They fight to-day against the English as the slaves of the\r\nKaiser even as they fought for the English as the mercenaries of the\r\nLandgrave of Hesse.\r\n\r\nI submit that all those generalizations are essentially shallow. It is\r\nnot true that the creed of Social Democracy is an essentially German\r\ncreed. As a matter of fact, the founders of German Socialism, and some\r\nof their chief leaders, are Jews. Lasalle and Marx were Jews.\r\nBernstein and Adler are Jews. It is not true that the Germans are\r\nconstitutionally incapable of heroism. As a matter of fact, no people\r\nhas ever fought more heroically than the millions of blinded and\r\nmisguided wretches who challenged a world in arms, and went to their\r\ndoom singing religious hymns and patriotic songs. And it is not true\r\nthat there is some mysterious fatality in temperament or race. The\r\nrace theory is a Prussian theory, and it is a sinister theory, the\r\nprolific mother of many political and moral heresies. National\r\ntemperament changes with circumstances, and the German temperament has\r\noften changed in the course of history. If the Germans may be\r\ndescribed to-day as a nation of practical materialists, at one time\r\nthey were described as a nation of dreamers. If the German Government\r\nmay be described to-day as a despotic State, at one time it was\r\ndescribed as a Government of free cities.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that national character has little to do with race. It is\r\nthe result of political institutions and religious beliefs. And it is\r\nthe political institutions and religious beliefs of modern Germany\r\nwhich largely explain the failure of Democracy.\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out the baneful influence of the Socialist\r\ncreed. But there is another creed which has exercised an even more\r\nbaneful influence. If we attempt to trace, farther back in history,\r\nthe main source of German character, we are driven to the conclusion\r\nthat it is Lutheranism which is responsible for the perversion of the\r\nGerman soul, that it is Lutheranism that is the _fons et origo\r\nmalorum_. Before the war all our ideas about religion and philosophy\r\nin Germany were made up of unmeaning formulas. And I make the\r\nconfident forecast that all those ideas will have to be transvalued in\r\nthe light of the present catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIf I were asked to sum up the achievements of Lutheranism, I would say\r\nthat it has accomplished two things equally fatal to Germany and\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand it has broken up the spiritual unity of Medieval\r\nChristendom and the political unity of the Holy German Empire into two\r\nthousand four hundred petty principalities. It has set up a tribal\r\nreligion and the pagan idolatry of the State; and, on the other hand,\r\nit has broken up the human soul into two water-tight compartments.\r\n\r\nOr to express the Lutheran achievement in terms of freedom and\r\ndespotism, it has, in the first place, killed political liberty by\r\nsurrendering all ecclesiastical power to the Prince, or to the State\r\nincarnated in the Prince. It has brought about the fusion and\r\nconfusion of spiritual and temporal powers. It has decreed that the\r\nreligion of the ruler shall determine the religion of the subject.\r\n_Cujus regio illius religio._ From the beginning his own\r\necclesiastical policy compelled Luther to sanction the bigamy of the\r\nLandgrave Philip of Hesse. In the most violent of his tracts he\r\ndenounced a miserable German peasantry, and he called upon the\r\nnobility to massacre those peasants who had only too faithfully obeyed\r\nthe provocations of the reformer.\r\n\r\nAnd, in the second place, Lutheranism has killed spiritual liberty by\r\ncreating an inner world of emotions and of dreams and an outer world\r\nof social and political activities without any relation to the inner\r\nworld. It has divorced speculation and action, theory and practice.\r\nThe German is like the symbolical eagle of the Habsburg. He has two\r\nheads, and both look in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nI would say that the poison of Lutheranism has been acting like that\r\nmysterious Indian poison called \"curare,\" which I used to inject in my\r\ndistant student days when I had to dissect frogs in the Zoological\r\nLaboratory at Liége. The \"curare\" does not kill the nerves, for the\r\nfrog still suffers under the dissecting knife. Nor does it kill the\r\nmuscles, for the muscles still react if you stimulate them. But the\r\npoison cuts the connection between the nerves and the muscles. The\r\nnerves can no more transmit their orders to the muscles. Even so\r\nLutheranism has not killed the thinking power of the German people. On\r\nthe contrary, it has given it a morbid stimulus, as speculation is no\r\nmore hampered by reality. Nor has it paralyzed their external\r\nactivities, but it has prevented any connection between the two. It\r\nhas prevented the thinking from influencing the acting. It justifies\r\nthe recent damning statement of Prince von Bülow, who ought to be a\r\ncompetent judge, that the Germans have remained an essentially\r\nunpolitical people.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Reformation there took place in Wittenberg, the\r\nMecca of Lutheranism, a memorable and ominous meeting to which few\r\ntextbooks take the trouble to allude, and which has had more\r\nfar-reaching consequences than any meeting known to history. It was\r\nthe meeting between Dr. Martinus Luther and the Grand Master of the\r\nTeutonic Order, Albrecht of Hohenzollern. Luther advised the Grand\r\nMaster to secularize his Order, to confiscate its immense territories,\r\nand to proclaim himself Duke of Prussia. Under such auspices arose the\r\nPrussian State. Under such auspices, at the instigation of the\r\n\"Champion of Liberty,\" was established the most tyrannical despotism\r\nof modern times. Under such auspices was consummated the unholy\r\nalliance between a \"reformed\" Germany and a twice \"reformed\"\r\nHohenzollern Monarchy.\r\n\r\nThis unholy alliance has been shattered by the war. And with the\r\nalliance will vanish the Lutheran creed, with all the evil works that\r\nproceeded therefrom.\r\n\r\nFor four hundred years the German people have followed their\r\npreachers, and have been led by them to the abyss, even as in the\r\nfamous ballad of Burger the German maiden Lenore has fallen under the\r\nspell of a corpse and has been driven to the gates of hell.\r\n\r\nFor four hundred years the German people have been in the grip of\r\ntheir despots. They will be under the spell no more.\r\n\r\nFor four hundred years the German masses have practised the three\r\ntheological virtues of Faith, Patience, and Obedience. The\r\nlong-suffering, docile, and servile Teutons are now ready to surrender\r\nto the original sin of rebellion. They are now ready to revert to the\r\nmethods followed by the peasants massacred by the orders of Luther.\r\n\r\nFor four hundred years their temporal and spiritual rulers have\r\nmanufactured a nation of slaves. The war has manufactured a nation of\r\nrevolutionists. What seemed an inexhaustible inheritance of loyalty\r\nand devotion has been wantonly squandered. The Hohenzollern Monarchy\r\nhas been born in spoliation, baptized in blood, and welded together by\r\niron. Blood and iron are now destroying it. The German armies have\r\nbeen the terror of the world. The day is drawing near when those same\r\nGerman armies will become a terror to their tyrants, and will call\r\nthem to account for the slaughter of twenty nations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nVIA PACIS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever excellent reasons we may have for doubting the sincerity of\r\nthe German peace overtures, and whatever grounds we may have for\r\ncriticizing the unfortunate wording of the American Notes, it must be\r\nconceded that President Wilson has rendered a conspicuous service to\r\nthe Allies by compelling them to face the formidable difficulties of\r\nthe problem of peace. Henceforth it will be impossible for our rulers\r\nto shirk those difficulties. They will have to give us something more\r\ntangible than mere vague and solemn abstractions, than mere rhetorical\r\nphrases and catchwords: they will have to depend on the support of\r\npublic opinion. The peace settlement will have to be made by the\r\nnations themselves, and not by a few diplomats. It will have to be\r\nmade in the full light of day and not in the secret and murky and\r\nmusty atmosphere of chancellories.\r\n\r\nAs a basis for any discussion on the peace settlement we would lay\r\ndown the following propositions:\r\n\r\n1. We must take good care to retain a firm hold of fundamental\r\nprinciples, and we must remain loyal to the conditions which have been\r\nproclaimed from the beginning by the statesmen of the Allies, and\r\nwhich are summed up in the primary aims, the \"crushing of Prussian\r\nmilitarism and the liberation of small nationalities.\"\r\n\r\n2. We must see to it that none of the secret agreements which may have\r\nbeen entered into by the diplomats of the Allies shall be allowed to\r\nconflict with those fundamental principles.\r\n\r\n3. We must realize that those principles are not particular principles\r\napplicable only to Germany and Austria. They are universal principles,\r\napplicable to all the Powers. \"Prussian militarism\" must be crushed\r\neverywhere, in Great Britain as well as in Germany, in Finland as well\r\nas in Alsace-Lorraine, in Italy as well as in Austria. Nationalities\r\nmust be liberated everywhere, the Ruthenians as well as the Poles, the\r\nJews as well as the Croatians.\r\n\r\n4. We must realize the concrete and deeper meaning of the vague and\r\nsomewhat confusing phraseology contained in the words \"to crush\r\nPrussian militarism.\" To \"crush Prussian militarism\" does not mean\r\nonly to crush the German armies. It cannot mean to crush 100,000,000\r\nGerman and Austrian people. It does not mean the repression of the\r\nlegitimate expansion of the Teutonic nations. To \"crush Prussian\r\nmilitarism\" means to do away with a sinister political system. It\r\nmeans exorcising an evil spirit. And we must clearly understand that,\r\nin order to exorcise that evil spirit, we must have the co-operation\r\nof the German people themselves. We must help them to achieve their\r\nown salvation. We must take in the paradoxical and tragic fact that\r\nthe awful sacrifice of twenty nations has been mainly a vicarious\r\nsacrifice, and that millions of our soldiers have died for the good of\r\nthe enemy as well as for the good of Europe--that they have died to\r\nmake Germany and Austria free.\r\n\r\n5. We must realize that this war is a holy war and not a punitive\r\nexpedition, much less a predatory war. Vengeance must be left to\r\nAlmighty God. The punishment of the criminals must be left to the\r\npeople themselves.\r\n\r\n6. Peace, if it is to be real, and if it is to be permanent, cannot be\r\nachieved by any vindictive policy. From the moment they enter the\r\npeace congress the belligerents cease to be belligerents, and become\r\nallies in a sacred cause--the reconstruction of the world. From the\r\nmoment the Central Powers are admitted to cross the threshold of the\r\nTemple of Peace they are readmitted to the community of nations, and\r\nthey are admitted on equal terms.\r\n\r\n7. A permanent peace excludes the very idea of any future economic\r\nwar. We must prevent the Central Powers from entering into any\r\noffensive or defensive economic alliance. We must repudiate the\r\nsinister delusion of a \"Mittel Europa\" which is haunting the diseased\r\nbrains of the Pan-Germanists. On the other hand, we must repudiate any\r\noffensive or defensive economic alliance between the Allied Powers.\r\nThe terms of peace must be engraved on clean white marble.\r\n\r\n8. If a permanent peace is to be attained we must remove the deeper\r\ncauses which brought about the catastrophe. The Central Powers are\r\nimmediately and directly responsible for the greatest crime of\r\nhistory, and they will bear the penalty for generations to come. They\r\nplanned the war and forced it on Europe. But the megalomania of the\r\nTeutons has only been one of the contributory causes. The war could\r\nnever have taken place but for the universally prevailing and\r\nuniversally accepted immorality of European foreign policy, which is\r\nwrit large in Morocco and Persia, in China and Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n9. The principle of nationality, however legitimate in the case of\r\noppressed nationalities, is not a sufficient foundation for the new\r\nEuropean order. The principle of nationality, which in the case of\r\nsmall nations leads to the vindication of freedom, on the contrary, in\r\nthe case of great Powers, leads to an aggressive imperialism. The\r\ninternational principle must therefore take the place of the national\r\nprinciple. Federalism and solidarity must take the place of tribal\r\nrivalry and national isolation.\r\n\r\n10. Any permanent peace settlement must involve the unreserved\r\nacceptance of a new political philosophy and the practice of a new\r\npolitical system. No peace is possible through the old methods of a\r\nbalance of power, of alliances and counter-alliances, of assurance and\r\nreassurance treaties. Any balance of power is unstable and precarious\r\nand can only be maintained by a competition of armaments. The\r\ndistinction between offensive and defensive alliances is essentially\r\nunreal. Under the old dispensation a defensive alliance became\r\noffensive as soon as it felt strong enough to assume the offensive. It\r\nis the system of alliances which led to armaments, and not the\r\narmaments which were responsible for the alliances. It is therefore\r\nfutile to speak of disarmament as long as we do not repudiate the\r\ntraditional European principle of the \"balance of power.\"\r\n\r\n11. It also follows as a corollary that no peace is possible merely\r\nthrough a readjustment of boundaries, through compensations and\r\nannexations of territories. We might recast the whole map of Europe,\r\nwe might dismember the German Empire, we might dismember the Austrian\r\nEmpire, we might dismember the Turkish Empire, and yet entirely fail\r\nto achieve the objects for which we entered the war. On the other\r\nhand, we might achieve those objects without shifting one single\r\nmilestone of the political boundaries of Europe.\r\n\r\n12. We must clearly realize that the issue of peace and war is not a\r\nmilitary issue, but a political issue, and that the political issue\r\nitself is a moral issue. It is not a _Machtfrage_, but a _Rechtfrage_.\r\nIt is not a question to be settled by diplomats of the old school; it\r\ncan only be solved by constructive and democratic statesmanship.\r\n\r\n13. To say that \"we must crush Prussian militarism\" is only a vague\r\nand unsatisfactory way of stating that we must establish democratic\r\ngovernment. Militarism is not a matter of foreign policy, but of\r\ndomestic policy. Militarism is but the _ultima ratio_ of reaction, and\r\nall nations are allies against the one common enemy, reactionary\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n14. It is therefore futile to say that the future congress must not\r\ninterfere in the internal government of any belligerent Power. If any\r\nEuropean Power after this war were still to be ruled by a reactionary\r\ngovernment based on brute force and oppression, that government would\r\nstill have to maintain a large army in order to keep down the\r\nliberties of its people, and such an army would sooner or later be\r\nused against the foreign enemy in the name of imperial national\r\naspirations, in the name of a higher civilizing mission.\r\n\r\n15. Therefore, the one problem before the European Congress is to\r\nestablish government in Europe on a constitutional and democratic\r\nbasis, and to grant a _Magna Carta_ to all nations, great and small.\r\nThe establishment of such a government, and not any annexations or\r\ncompensations, would alone guarantee a permanent peace.\r\n\r\n16. All civilized nations must be equally interested in the\r\nmaintenance of peace and in the establishment of the new international\r\norder. Therefore, all neutral nations, including the United States of\r\nAmerica, must join the congress as signatories and guarantors of the\r\npeace settlement.\r\n\r\n17. The new democratic charter shall be placed under the guardianship\r\nof a Supreme Constitutional Court. Such a Court would not be a secret\r\ndiplomatic Sanhedrin, but a democratic Tribunal. Such a Court would be\r\nessentially different from the Hague Tribunals of the past, and the\r\ndemocracies of the world would be directly interested in enforcing its\r\ndecrees.\r\n\r\n18. There is one immediate sanction to the constitutional settlement\r\njust outlined--namely, the Sovereign Will of the people of Europe.\r\nRevolution is knocking at the door. Unless a constitutional charter be\r\ngranted, unless democratic government be firmly established in Europe,\r\nit will be wrested from their rulers by the nations themselves. All\r\nthe signs of the times confirm us in the conviction that the only\r\nalternative to the establishment of democratic government for all the\r\nnations participating in the congress is universal civil war. The\r\npeacemakers of to-morrow have it in their power not only to crush\r\n\"Prussian militarism,\" but to prevent an appalling upheaval which\r\nwould shake human society to its foundations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nTHE PRIVATE MORALITY OF THE PRUSSIAN KINGS\r\n\r\nFREDERICK WILLIAM II.: THE HOHENZOLLERN POLYGAMIST\r\n\r\nBY ALBERT SOREL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally assumed, even by those writers who are most strongly\r\nopposed to the sinister policy of the Hohenzollerns, that at least\r\ntheir domestic relations present an edifying contrast with the private\r\nimmorality of the other Royal Houses of Europe. The world has been\r\nmade familiar with the Court scandals of the Habsburgs, the Bourbons,\r\nand the Georges, and has heard little of the Hohenzollern Dynasty. But\r\nthat is merely because the \"amours\" and the family squabbles of the\r\nHohenzollerns are so much less picturesque and so much less\r\ninteresting than those of a Henry IV. or of a Louis XIV., and because\r\nthey have been hidden under a thick cloud of hypocrisy. The most\r\nbrilliant of French historians, Monsieur Albert Sorel, has torn the\r\nveil from this hypocrisy and has laid bare the sordid story of\r\nFrederick William II.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the manner in which the official historians of\r\nPrussia have narrated the history of the dynasty, it is instructive\r\nto compare the following character-sketch of the successor of\r\nFrederick the Great with the idealist portrait of Treitschke (\"Germany\r\nHistory,\" vol. i.), who would make us believe that Frederick William\r\nII. was a paragon of all the private virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nFrederick the Great's base tolerance produced dissolvent effects. Not\r\nproceeding from respect of religious beliefs, it engendered contempt\r\nfor them. As, apart from the curb of religion, the new society of\r\nPrussia had no tradition of social morals to rely upon, corruption\r\nentered in and consumed it. The King's scepticism took possession of\r\nhis subjects, who translated it into deeds. It was good \"form\";\r\neveryone in Berlin took it up and conducted himself accordingly. The\r\nleaven of licence and sensuality which mars all the literature of the\r\ncentury fermented without let or hindrance in those coarse souls. An\r\nimmature civilization had overstimulated imaginations and senses\r\nwithout abating the brutality of the primitive passions. In Prussia\r\npeople lacked the delicate taste, the genteel habits, the light wit,\r\nwhich in France qualified the depravity of the age. A heavy\r\ndissoluteness was paraded in Prussia. Officials, the gentry, women,\r\nall fed their minds on d'Holbach and La Mettrie, taking their\r\ndoctrines seriously and applying them to the very letter.\r\n\r\nAdd to this that in the newly built Prussian capital society, utterly\r\nartificial as it was, an improvised amalgam of incongruous elements,\r\nwas predisposed, so to speak, to dissoluteness. Berlin swarmed with\r\narmy men who had no family life and whose whole day was not occupied\r\nwith military duties. Men of letters, adventurers of the pen and of\r\nthe sword, attracted by Frederick's reputation and reduced to intrigue\r\nand all sorts of expedients for a living; a nobility, very poor, very\r\nproud, very exclusive, weighed down by royal discipline and thoroughly\r\nbored; a bourgeoisie enlightened, enriched, but relegated to a place\r\nof its own; between these groups, separated one from the other by\r\netiquette or prejudice, a sort of demi-monde where they met, chatted\r\nand enjoyed themselves at their ease, the foyer of \"French ideas,\" the\r\nhub of affairs and intrigues--Jewish society, the richest and most\r\nelegant in Berlin. With the marvellous pliancy of their race the Jews\r\nhad assimilated the new civilization and took their revenge from the\r\npolitical exclusion of which they were the victims by bringing\r\ntogether in their salons all the intellectual men in Berlin, all the\r\nattractive women, all desirous of liberty and freed from prejudice.\r\nSuch was Berlin in the days of Frederick.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nOne of the finest cities in Europe, wrote Forster in 1779; but the\r\nBerliners! Sociability and refined taste, he found, degenerated in\r\nthem into sensuality, into libertinage (he might almost say voracity),\r\nfreedom of wit and love of shining in shameless licence and\r\nunrestrained debauch of thought. The women in general were abandoned.\r\nAn English diplomat, Sir John Harris, afterwards Lord Malmesbury, had\r\nthe same impression: Berlin was a town where, if _fortis_ might be\r\ntranslated by \"honourable,\" you could say that there was not a _vir\r\nfortis nec femina casta_.\r\n\r\nIf you consider that outside Jewish homes money was scarce, and that\r\ntemptations are all the stronger the less means you have of satisfying\r\nthem, you can see why in many minds disorder of ideas and corruption\r\nof morals opened a new wound, the most dangerous, in sooth, and the\r\nmost repugnant in nations--venality. Mirabeau, in his \"Secret\r\nHistory,\" indelibly recorded all the vices of _ce noble tripot_,\r\nBerlin. On this head his famous pamphlet is a picture in violent\r\ncolours, but true nevertheless. Cynicism there seems merely local\r\ncolour. \"'Rottenness before Ripeness'--I am very much afraid that must\r\nbe the motto of Prussian power.... What cannot money do in a house so\r\npoor?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIt required Frederick's hand of iron to set in motion these\r\ncomplicated springs, to regulate the unwieldy machine, keep together\r\nthese elements collected with no little ingenuity and ready to go to\r\npieces. But that hand was weighty and hard. There were signs, in the\r\nupper classes at all events--the only classes then taken into\r\naccount--of a sort of muffled revolt against this implacable disciple.\r\nBesides, the Prussians entertained queer illusions as to the future.\r\nFrederick had deceived his subjects just as he had deceived himself\r\nregarding the durability of his work. They did not understand to what\r\nan extent their power was the personal power of their King. Proud to\r\nthe point of infatuation of the rôle he had made them play, they\r\nimagined it was their own doing, and that Frederick's soul would\r\nsurvive in them. They expected from a new reign the same glory abroad,\r\nthe same security at home, the same relative prosperity, with a yoke\r\nless rough and a discipline less severe, not understanding that the\r\nvery roughness of the yoke and the severity of the discipline were\r\nconditions necessary to the duration of the work. The mercantile\r\nprotective system, which had built up industry; the administration of\r\ntaxes, which poured money into the State coffers; the economy, which\r\nimmobilized this money in the treasury, hampered and irritated all who\r\nwished to work and trade, all who reflected on the natural conditions\r\nof commerce and industry; but it was these things alone that enabled\r\nthe poorest Government in Europe to be better armed than the richest,\r\nand to keep in the van. In a word, people wanted the spring to relax,\r\nand failed to see that to slacken the spring meant annihilating the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTo reform Frederick's monarchy would have required no less genius than\r\nit took to create it. Reform, however, was indispensable, since\r\nFrederick alone was capable of holding up the composite edifice he had\r\nbuilt. Hence a threatening and wellnigh inevitable catastrophe. \"All\r\nwill go on almost of its own accord, so long as foreign affairs are\r\nquiet and unbroken,\" wrote Mirabeau after Frederick's death. \"But at\r\nthe first gunshot or at the first stormy situation the whole of this\r\nlittle scaffolding of mediocrity will topple to the ground. How all\r\nthese underling Ministers would crumple up! How everyone, from the\r\ndistracted chief to the convict-gang, would shout for a pilot! Who\r\nwould that pilot be?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nFrederick's nephew, who was called upon to succeed him, was not made\r\nfor so great a rôle. In every respect he offered a complete contrast\r\nto the Prince whose weighty heritage he took up. Frederick in person\r\nwas infirm and sober; all his prestige lay in the gaze of his great\r\neyes, which, as Mirabeau put it, \"at the will of his heroic soul,\r\ncarried fascination or terror.\" Frederick William II. was a _bel\r\nhomme_, highly sanguine, very robust, fond of violent exercise and\r\ncoarse pleasures. \"The build and strength of a Royal Guardsman,\" wrote\r\nthe French Minister d'Esterno, who had no liking for him. \"An enormous\r\nmachine of flesh,\" said an Austrian diplomat who saw him at Pillnitz\r\nin 1791. \"The true type of a King,\" according to Metternich, who was\r\npresented to him in 1792 at Coblenz, at the time of the German crusade\r\nagainst France and the Revolution. \"His stature,\" he added, \"was\r\ngigantic, and his corpulence in keeping. In every company he stood a\r\nhead higher than the surrounding crowd. His manners were noble and\r\nengaging.\" He expressed himself with a certain effort, in little\r\nabrupt phrases. There was nothing in him to recall the implacable and\r\nsovereign irony of Frederick.\r\n\r\n\"His look,\" said one apologist, \"does not betoken a man of genius, but\r\nGerman candour shines on his brow.\" Strange candour, scarcely\r\nrecognizable if you take the word in its common and proper sense. It\r\nmust be taken, as was then the practice in Germany, through\r\ntranslations of Rousseau, in the equivocal and refined acceptation\r\nwhich reconciled innocence with indecency, virtue with every disorder\r\nof the imagination and the heart. Ecstatic and sensual, devout and\r\nlicentious, a prey to violent appetites, tormented by scruples,\r\nsuperstitious and debauched, believing in ghosts, with a tendency\r\ntowards cabal, Frederick William had a taste for ethics and a feeling\r\nfor religion. He spoke of them with respect, with awe, with emotion.\r\nIn his case it was a natural penchant and at the same time a pose, the\r\nattitude of every heir-presumptive towards the crowned head, a way of\r\nwinning admiration and captivating by force of contrast.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nHe and those around him might be gulled by this \"German candour.\" Not\r\nso Frederick. In his Memoirs he draws his nephew as he was in 1765, at\r\nthe age of twenty-one, at the time of his first marriage with\r\nElizabeth of Brunswick: \"The young husband, without any morals, given\r\nover to a life of debauchery, was daily guilty of infidelity to his\r\nwife. The Princess, who was in the flower of her beauty, was shocked\r\nat the slight regard shown for her charms. Soon she plunged into\r\nexcesses almost as bad as her husband's.\" In 1769 they were divorced.\r\nFrederick William married a Princess of Darmstadt. The second\r\nmarriage was no happier than the first. The Princess did not\r\nretaliate, though she did not lack incentives to do so. The Prince\r\nlapsed back into his dissolute habits. Apart from many passing\r\nfancies, he had a recognized mistress-in-chief. This person, who\r\nmanaged always to retain the favour, if not the love, of Frederick\r\nWilliam, was the daughter of a humble musician. She married the\r\nPrince's _valet de chambre_, became Madame Rietz, and was afterwards\r\nmade Countess of Lichtenau. Frederick William by the first marriage\r\nhad had a daughter, Princess Frederica, who was brought up by the\r\nQueen, the discarded, not to say repudiated, wife of Frederick the\r\nGreat. The father, when visiting the girl, fell in love with one of\r\nher maids-of-honour. Her name was Mademoiselle de Voss, and she came\r\nof a good house, being cousin to one of the King's Ministers, M. de\r\nFinckenstein, and sister of a President of the Chamber. \"This beauty,\r\nwho to my mind is very ugly,\" wrote Mirabeau, \"is a mixture of prudery\r\nand cynicism, of affectation and ingenuousness; she has a natural wit\r\nof a kind, some schooling, manias rather than desires, a gaucherie\r\nwhich she strives to cover by an appearance of _naïveté_.... All her\r\ncharm lies in her complexion, and even that I find wan rather than\r\nwhite; a very beautiful neck. It was this mixture of unique licence,\r\nthey say, which she combined with the airs of innocent ignorance and\r\nvestal severity, that captivated the Prince.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nFrederick William was one of those complex libertines who find in\r\nclever resistance a whet to their passion and a solace to their\r\nscruples. The siege of Mademoiselle de Voss lasted nearly two years.\r\nThe outs and ins of this strange romance were the common talk of the\r\nCourt. It had not yet reached its dénouement when Frederick the\r\nGreat's death stopped its course for several weeks. King from August\r\n17, 1786, onwards, Frederick William seemed to forget everything but\r\naffairs of State. But Mirabeau affirms, after September 8, \"the\r\nfervour of the novice began to abate.\" Mademoiselle de Voss, he added,\r\nwas on the point of yielding. The King, to make her comfortable, had\r\nset up an establishment for his daughter Frederica; Mademoiselle de\r\nVoss did the honours. The year passed, however, without the vestal's\r\nsurrendering. She loved the King, but the honour of the family still\r\nweighed more with her than love. She set rigorous conditions to her\r\ncapitulation: a left-handed marriage, the written consent of the\r\nQueen, and the removal of the titular mistress, Madame Rietz. On this\r\nlast point the King was inflexible; he gave in on the other two. The\r\nQueen gave her consent, with the stipulation that there should be no\r\nreal divorce or public separation; she kept her title of Queen and her\r\nposition as lawful wife. The rest, it appears, was of no great\r\ninterest to her. It only remained to conclude the marriage, but, under\r\nthe circumstances, that was a delicate and ticklish business.\r\n\r\nBy hook or by crook a precedent had to be found: the Prussian\r\nConsistory proved amenable, and authorized the marriage. The marriage\r\nwas celebrated in July, 1787, in the Chapel Royal of Charlottenburg.\r\nMademoiselle de Voss took the title of Countess of Ingenheim. Her\r\nhappiness was short-lived. She died in the month of March, 1789. \"All\r\nBerlin is in mourning,\" wrote M. d'Esterno. \"The Countess of Ingenheim\r\nis cruelly regretted by the people, the royal family, and even the\r\nQueen, much less for the person of the said Countess as because of the\r\nincrease of credit which her death will bring to Dame Rietz, the old\r\nhabitual mistress, who is said to be very avaricious and a great\r\nintriguer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThe literature of the day shed tears over the royal bereavement,\r\ncelebrated the \"virtues\" of this susceptible monarch, and contrasted\r\nwith the withering scepticism of Voltaire and the criminal frivolity\r\nof the French the tender abandon with which Frederick William gave\r\nhimself up to \"nature's sweetest inclination.\" \"Women-haters,\" wrote\r\nBaron de Trenck, \"have been the scourges of humanity. The King of\r\nPrussia has a great soul, full of sensibility; in love he is capable\r\nof a tender attachment: he knows the value of his mistress. Supposing\r\nhe gives her a million, the money is divided among the members of the\r\nhousehold who are citizens. He will not rob an honest man of the\r\nspouse who constitutes his happiness, he will not sacrifice Rome for\r\nCleopatra. He wants to please all by himself. For twenty months he\r\ncourted Mademoiselle de Voss, he married her, he was faithful to her,\r\nhe wept over her ashes. Every citizen wise enough to know human\r\nweaknesses must wish that if he made a fresh choice it would fall on\r\nan object as worthy of his heart. So let him enjoy a happiness which\r\nbelongs to the simple peasant as it does to kings.\" This hypocritical\r\ntwaddle, this licentious casuistry, was \"very good style\" in Germany\r\nthen, and was highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\nThe distraction which Trenck desired for the afflicted soul of the\r\nKing was not long in presenting itself. In 1790, on the anniversary of\r\nthe Countess of Ingenheim's death, Mademoiselle Doenhof was presented\r\nat Court. Everyone there was busy consoling Frederick William. A\r\nclaimant had even been put forward in the person of a young lady\r\ncalled Viereck, a friend of Mademoiselle de Voss, who had taken the\r\nlatter's place with Princess Frederica. Unhappily for Mademoiselle\r\nViereck's friends, she was dark and in no way recalled the dear\r\ndeparted. Mademoiselle Doenhof, on the other hand, was, according to\r\nthe French Minister, \"so perfectly fair that, while pretty in\r\nartificial light, in daylight she was as yellow as a lemon.\" With the\r\nsame charms as Mademoiselle de Voss, she had the same jumble of\r\npietism and virtue. It was once more a case of marrying. The King saw\r\nno difficulty in the way. \"I am separated from the Queen,\" he wrote to\r\nMademoiselle Doenhof; \"Madame d'Ingenheim has left me a widower; I\r\noffer you my heart and hand.\" He made no concealment of it, openly\r\ndeclaring that he had grounds for repudiating the Queen, but he\r\nrefrained from taking action upon them in order to maintain the\r\ndignity of the throne.\r\n\r\nThe Consistory did not require to deliberate a second time; precedents\r\nhad been established, and they were followed. The marriage took place\r\non April 10, 1790, and it was the Court preacher, Zoellner, who\r\nconsecrated it, as he had consecrated that with Mademoiselle de Voss.\r\nThe Queen gave the bride girandoles of diamonds. The Queen-Dowager\r\nreceived her, and everyone at Court made a fuss of her. All the same,\r\nshe was no more successful than Mademoiselle de Voss in getting rid of\r\nMadame Rietz. This favourite, who had been given 70,000 crowns to take\r\nher departure, remained, took an officer as her lover, and even got\r\nthe King to promote him.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in 1790, the King of Prussia, Mademoiselle de Voss's widower,\r\nhad three wives living: the Princess of Brunswick, who was repudiated;\r\nthe Princess of Darmstadt, who, although divorced, still kept the rank\r\nof Queen; and Mademoiselle Doenhof, morganatic wife. This third wife,\r\nwrote one diplomat, will not be the last, for \"those the King longs\r\nfor will also want to be married.\" The Prince in any case was always\r\nready. Polygamy, in his eyes, was a prerogative of royalty. As the\r\nresult of a Court intrigue in 1792 he had himself separated from\r\nMademoiselle Doenhof, crowning by this divorce the strange series of\r\nhis conjugal evolutions. Then he offered his heart and hand to a lady\r\ncalled Bethmann, a banker's daughter whom he had known at Frankfurt,\r\nand found very much to his liking. This young person, in the words of\r\nLord Malmesbury, was \"all sentiment and all fire\"; but she had\r\nprinciples and discretion. She had misgivings about the character of\r\nthe marriage and the constancy of the bridegroom. She refused, thus\r\nsparing the Berlin casuists the trouble of a deliberation still more\r\nticklish than before. I know not whether these accommodating\r\ntheologians, reared in the school of Voltaire and Frederick, took\r\nthese simultaneous marriages very seriously or not; abroad they\r\nafforded subject for ridicule, and Catherine the Great, who herself\r\ndid not feel bound to observe so many formalities, was highly amused\r\nat them; \"that big lout of a Gu\"--such was her name for Frederick\r\nWilliam in her letters to Grimm--\"that big lout has just married a\r\nthird wife; the libertine never has enough legitimate wives; for a\r\nconscientious libertine, commend me to him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\nFrederick William loved women. Women, however, did not govern him. But\r\nif he escaped the influence of mistresses, he fell under the influence\r\nof favourites, and the people were none the better off. Badly brought\r\nup, kept apart from State affairs by his uncle, distrusting others\r\nbecause he was very distrustful of himself, he knew nothing of the art\r\nof government, and dallied with vague reform projects. The Ministers\r\nwhom Frederick left behind, although very second-rate, made him ill at\r\nease. He was afraid of being considered under their thumb; besides,\r\nthese Ministers represented ideas and a system which he affected to\r\ncondemn. \"The King will be led just because he is afraid of being so,\"\r\nwrote Mirabeau. The fear of being governed by his Ministers delivered\r\nhim into the hands of underlings, who promptly gained a mastery over\r\nhim by humbling themselves before him, reassuring his suspicious\r\npride, flattering his passions--above all, exploiting the shortcomings\r\nof his mind. Frederick William desired the good of the State; he had a\r\nhazy but quite keen idea of the necessity of counteracting the\r\nexcesses of Frederick's Government; but his intentions rambled, and\r\nhis reform fancies, more mystical then political, proceeded not so\r\nmuch from the idea of the interests of the State as from the influence\r\nof a secret doctrine with which he was imbued. The statesman in him\r\nwas but an adept in magic; for Ministers he took mere charlatans.\r\nSkilled conjurers replaced at Potsdam Frederick's \"judicious\r\nMinisters.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\nOf all these mystical adventurers, the one whose influence was perhaps\r\nthe most baneful for the Prussian State was Woellner, a pure intriguer.\r\nSon of a country pastor, he worked his way into the household of\r\nGeneral d'Itzenplitz; after wheedling the mother, he ended by marrying\r\nthe daughter. Frederick, who was anything but indulgent to\r\nmis-alliances, had him clapped into prison in Berlin. The hatred of\r\nWoellner for the Philosopher-King dated from that day. At that time he\r\nwas a rationalist and a disciple of Wolf; he became a Freemason. But\r\nalready in high society in Germany the wind no longer set in the\r\ndirection of pure Deism. Woellner, always a perfect sceptic, changed\r\nhis convictions. Considering himself as fitted as any other for the\r\napparition business and the mystery industry, he decided to turn\r\n\"honest broker\" between the powers of this world and those of the\r\nnext, basing his credit with the former on that which he claimed with\r\nthe latter. He joined the Rosicrucians, and soon became one of the\r\nleading lights of the Order.\r\n\r\nThus he knew the man who was to counterbalance his favour at the Court\r\nof Berlin and one day share with him Frederick's Government, the Saxon\r\nBischoffswerder. The son of a small noble, an officer of fortune, come\r\nlike so many others to seek service in Prussia, he had wormed his way\r\ninto the favour of the Prince-Royal, and had quickly taken him in.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\nMistresses and favourites, Rosicrucians and valets, theosophists and\r\n_femmes galantes_, on the whole got on very well together and agreed\r\nsurprisingly. It was but a step from the laboratory of the\r\nRosicrucians to the boudoir of Madame Rietz, and these mystic\r\npersonages cleared it without a scrap of shame. They formed a close\r\nalliance with the _valet de chambre_ and his wife, the _maîtresse\r\nd'habitude_, who throughout all the matrimonial pranks of the King\r\nmanaged to preserve her credit by artifices analogous to those which\r\nat Versailles had so long maintained that of Madame de Pompadour.\r\n\r\nAround them swarmed a crowd of subordinate intriguers, the \"clique,\"\r\nas they were called in Berlin, ready for all sorts of jobs behind the\r\nscenes at Court, in the Army, in politics, in diplomacy--above all, in\r\nfinance. Needy and greedy, they had a firmly established reputation in\r\nEurope for venality. \"I maintain,\" declared Mirabeau, \"that with a\r\nthousand louis you could, if need be, know perfectly all the secrets\r\nof the Berlin Cabinet.... So the Emperor has a faithful record of\r\nevery step of the King, day by day, and could know everything he\r\nplanned, if he planned anything.\" These were the methods, as Custine\r\naffirmed in 1792, that every diplomatist in the world employed; all\r\nthe Ministers who resided in Berlin used them with more success and\r\nmore generally than elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\nSuch was the strange band of adventurers who pounced on the monarchy\r\nand the treasury of Frederick the Great. Their course of action, very\r\ncomplex and very powerful, was well designed to captivate a fantastic\r\nand voluptuous bigot. However, they would never have gained more than\r\nan antechamber or alcove influence, they would never have risen to\r\npolitical influence, had they not known how to pervert the noblest\r\ninclinations of the King, whilst flattering the lowest. Mediocre and\r\nsecondary as was his place in the line of the Hohenzollerns,\r\nFrederick William was not devoid of all royal qualities. He was brave,\r\nhe was kind-hearted, or rather he was a man of \"sensibility\"; he\r\ndesired the public weal; he had suffered, like the nation, from the\r\npitiless régime of Frederick; like the whole nation, he wanted to\r\nreform the State by lightening the yoke. He believed himself inspired\r\nfrom on high, \"illumined,\" and called by Providence to restore the\r\nmorals and faith of a country which, he was told, and he himself\r\nbelieved, was perishing through the scepticism of men's minds and the\r\nlooseness of men's morals.\r\n\r\nHow could he combine such tendencies with such tastes, such\r\naspirations with such passions, such beliefs with such debauchery? It\r\nwas just therein that he showed himself a weak character and a mystic;\r\nthat was why he joined theurgic sects instead of submitting to the\r\nChurch; why he believed in visions more than in the Gospel, listened\r\nto a ventriloquist mimicking the voice of Frederick instead of\r\nlistening to the voices of the Ministers, the great King's disciples;\r\nthat is why he distrusted wise, thoughtful, experienced people and\r\nsurrendered himself to charlatans and favourites.\r\n\r\n\r\nBILLING AND SONS, LTD., PRINTERS, GUILDFORD, ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE SAME AUTHOR\r\n\r\n  H.
