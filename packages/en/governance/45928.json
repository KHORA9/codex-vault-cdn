INTRODUCTORY. EXPLANATIONS AND PLEDGES.\r\n\r\n|THE \"History of the Great Rebellion,\" as some have called it, or of\r\n\"The American Conflict,\" as others have called it, has been written over\r\nand over--by Greeley, by McClusky, by Abbott, by Kattell, by Pollard,\r\nand by others--and it is not my intention to write it again: but I\r\nPurpose, as Macaulay says in the first two words of that wonderful\r\nHistory of England in which, by the magic of his pen, he has made facts,\r\nwhich, until then, had lain only in the brains of old women, in the\r\ntraditions of old men, in forgotten newspapers, and in neglected\r\npamphlets, come forth in all the habiliments of life; some grinning with\r\nmerriment, and others frowning with despair--some as angels of heaven,\r\nand others as demons of hell--I Purpose, throughout the whole of this\r\nvolume, to write of the sayings and doings of those who, in the great\r\nwar between the United States and the \"Southern Confederacy,\" stood in\r\nthe side wings, or _behind_ the scenes, as proprietors, as stockholders,\r\nas lessees, as stage managers, as prompters, as scene-shifters, as\r\ncurtain-droppers, as wire-pullers, and without whom the acts _before_\r\nthe scenes could not have been, and would not have been, enacted.\r\n\r\nMany, yea, most of those who attended to their various parts behind\r\nthe scenes, while those in front were attending to theirs, have gone to\r\ntheir long homes. Like the hero of a hundred battles--\r\n\r\n               \"They sleep their last sleep and have fought their last battle,\r\n\r\n               No sound can awake them to glory again;\"\r\n\r\nyet a few remain, scattered throughout the North, scattered throughout\r\nthe South, in cities, in towns, in offices, in workshops, in negro huts;\r\nand from these, and such as these, we have gathered and now propose to\r\nput on record, the _inner_ or _secret_ history of the greatest war of\r\nthe nineteenth century--a war in which more men were engaged, more\r\ndeeds of valor done, more lives lost, and during which there was more of\r\nmasterly diplomacy exercised, on both sides, than in any war which has\r\noccurred since the days of the Roman empire.\r\n\r\nEighteen years ago! Only three words, uttered in a single breath and\r\nseeming but as yesterday, when looking backward, and yet where is the\r\ntongue that can tell, or the pen that can write all that has transpired\r\nwithin that time?\r\n\r\nFields made desolate by battles then are now waving with grain, covered\r\nby green swards, or bedecked with flowers; what were then hastily\r\nconstructed earthworks are now grassy mounds; covered over with\r\nshrubbery; what then were rifle-pits are now pleasant pathways for man\r\nand beast; cities then burned, or otherwise made desolate through the\r\nravages of war, have regained more than their former size, beauty, and\r\ncommercial prosperity; plantations then laid waste have been restored to\r\nmore than their former productiveness; wounds, ghastly, bloody wounds,\r\nthen made by shot or shell, or sabre cut, are now so healed that even\r\nthe cicatrices are scarcely observable; and, but for vacant chairs in\r\nmany households, and too well-filled cemeteries at Arlington Heights, at\r\nGettysburg, and all over the land, it would be difficult for us now\r\nto realize that a terrible, desolating war had swept over this country\r\nwithin so short a time as eighteen years.\r\n\r\nTime is indeed the great leveller, bringing king and subject, master\r\nand slave, to a common platform; nor is it less the great assuager and\r\nhealer. Passions which burned in the breasts of men with the fierceness\r\nof a furnace, eighteen years ago, have so smouldered and died out, that\r\nnot even a spark can now be found on the hearthstones of their hearts;\r\nand hence it is that what could not have been told fifteen, ten, or even\r\nfive years ago, without the risk of inflaming passions and leading to\r\ngreater harm than good, may now be told without the slightest objection\r\neither from actors or subjects. In history, as in law, there are\r\n_statutes of limitation_, and when these bounds are once passed, all\r\nthat occurred previous to those dates is wiped from the record of\r\n_personal_ responsibility, and becomes the property of the historian.\r\n\r\nMost, if not all, of the facts which I purpose to incorporate in this\r\nhistory will be new--that is, such as have never been published before.\r\nThey have been known, of course, to the actors and to a few confidential\r\nfriends, and vague hints of their existence have found their way in\r\nnewspapers from time to time; but never before have they reached the\r\npublic eye or ear in book form; nor would they now, but for the fact\r\nthat the limitation of responsibility has so far passed, that no\r\npossible harm can come from their publicity. To make the new facts\r\nintelligible as to time and bearing, old facts will, in some cases,\r\nhave to be repeated, but in all such cases the old facts will be but the\r\nframes, while the new facts will be the pictures.\r\n\r\nThough we are not at liberty in all cases to give the sources of our\r\ninformation, yet no one need question the substantial correctness of\r\nevery statement found in this volume, though it may occasionally happen\r\nthat names have been given incorrectly or misspelled, or that the dates\r\nare not precise. To remember names and dates is not easy for any one,\r\nand that, after a lapse of fifteen years, some of these should have been\r\npartially or entirely forgotten by some of our informants, is not at all\r\nstrange. Of course we can only give the statements as received. Most of\r\nthem we have had direct from the lips of those who were participants in\r\nthe scenes, others from official sources, that is, from those who were\r\nin, or directly connected with, governmental departments; others, from\r\nhints given at the time, but the details of which could not be stated\r\nuntil the prejudices and passions of the war had subsided; and still\r\nothers, from those who had them from the lips of the participants.\r\n\r\nSome of the facts and incidents hereafter to be related are but new\r\nmanifestations of the Fabian policy, and however unfair they would have\r\nseemed to Northern people had they been known at the time, yet now, few,\r\nif any, will regard them other than as acts of masterly diplomacy upon\r\nthe part of Mr. Davis and his cabinet. But for this policy, the Southern\r\nConfederacy would have had to succumb at least two years before it did;\r\nand, on the principle that \"while there is life there is hope,\" the\r\nlonger they could prolong the contest the more to their credit. The\r\nrelative strength of the North and South, at the beginning of the war,\r\nmay be fairly represented by the numbers 20 and 10. Now take one off\r\nfrom each at five successive engagements, and the figures will stand 15\r\nand 5. Before, the smaller equalled the one-half of the larger number,\r\nnow it equals only the one-third. Again take one off from each at four\r\nmore engagements, and the figures will stand 11 and 1--the smaller\r\nrepresenting only the one-eleventh part of the larger, while one more\r\nengagement wipes out the smaller number entirely, and yet leaves the\r\none-half of the larger. From this plain mathematical statement it will\r\nbe seen how important it was for the Southern Confederacy to pursue the\r\nFabian policy of delay, both as to its operations in the field, and in\r\nits diplomacy with English and Northern capitalists.\r\n\r\nThe learning of these \"_Secrets of the Late Rebellion_\" has had the\r\neffect to increase, rather than lessen, our admiration of Jefferson\r\nDavis as a statesman, and such we think will be the effect upon all\r\nwho may read this book. However much we may condemn his political\r\nprinciples, however much we may condemn the rebellion, and however\r\nrejoiced we may be that he and it failed of success, yet, now that we\r\nknow of the secret as well as the open difficulties with which he had\r\nto contend, we cannot but admire the talent, the energy, and the\r\nperseverance with which he overcame them all for months and years; and\r\nat last only yielded to necessities which no foresight, no talent, no\r\nenergy could have overcome.\r\n\r\nNor is he the only one of the \"Lost Cause\" whom these \"Secrets\" make\r\nus to admire the more. Others, many others, as will be seen by the\r\nfollowing chapters, acted their parts nobly and well, and deserve more\r\ncredit than has ever yet been accorded to them by the historian; while\r\nothers whose secret fiendish acts are herein recorded, acted worse, a\r\nthousandfold worse, than the public ever knew or probably would have\r\nknown but for the appearance of this volume.\r\n\r\nIn putting on record the following facts and incidents of the war, my\r\naim shall be to view everything from a historic standpoint only. As a\r\nNorthern man, and as a late officer in the army, my partisanship and\r\nprejudices during the war were doubtless as strong as those of any\r\nother man; but so far as I know my own heart, not a particle of that\r\npartisanship or prejudice now remains, and I believe that I can write of\r\nboth sides with equal impartiality. In relating the incidents, I may\r\nnot have occasion to express any opinion at all for or against; but if\r\nI should, my readers may rest assured that it will be done without a\r\nparticle of prejudice. With these explanations, and these pledges, I am\r\nnow ready to begin the relation of facts and incidents as they occurred\r\n_Behind the Scenes_ during the late War. J. R. F.\r\n\r\nMONTGOMERY, ALA., BEFORE THE WAR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0031]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. RUNNING THE LAND BLOCKADE. KING COTTON BEHIND THE SCENES.\r\n\r\n|ON the 4th of February, 1861, the Confederate Congress met at\r\nMontgomery, Ala. It was composed of nine delegates from Alabama,\r\nthree from Florida, ten from Georgia, six from Louisiana, seven\r\nfrom Mississippi, three from North Carolina, seven from South\r\nCarolina--forty-five in all.\r\n\r\nThey adopted the old Constitution of the United States, with\r\nthe exception of five clauses. The first was a change in the\r\npreamble--making the States named, other than \"We the people,\" the\r\ncontracting parties; the second change related to the \"importation of\r\nAfrican negroes,\" etc.; the third related to the escape and delivery of\r\nslaves; the fourth related to adjusting disputes between the contracting\r\nStates; the fifth empowered Congress to \"lay and collect taxes, duties,\r\nimposts, etc.\" The Constitution, as amended, was adopted February\r\n8th, and on the same day Jefferson Davis, of Mississippi, was elected\r\nPresident, and Alexander H. Stephens, of Georgia, Vice-President, by a\r\nunanimous vote.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of February Mr. Davis was inaugurated, and immediately after\r\nhe nominated, and Congress confirmed, the following cabinet:\r\n\r\n               Secretary of State...............................Robert Toombs.\r\n\r\n               Secretary of the Treasury....................C. G. Memminger.\r\n\r\n               Secretary of War................................L. Pope Walker.\r\n\r\nThis same Congress authorized a loan of fifteen million dollars, secured\r\nby an export duty on cotton, and passed an act \"To modify the navigation\r\nlaws, and to repeal all discriminating duties on ships and vessels\"--by\r\nwhich the entire coasting trade from Charleston to Galveston was thrown\r\nopen to the British flag. Had English capitalists framed the law, they\r\ncould not have made it to please themselves better.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of April, 1861, President Davis issued a proclamation\r\noffering to grant letters of marque and reprisal to aid the Southern\r\nConfederacy in resisting what he called \"the wanton and wicked\r\naggressions\" of the United States government.\r\n\r\nTo this President Lincoln immediately responded by issuing a\r\nproclamation, dated April 19th, declaring the Southern ports in a state\r\nof blockade.\r\n\r\nThe Congress of the Southern Confederacy assembled at Montgomery again\r\non the 29th of April, 1861. President Davis, in his message, advised the\r\nimmediate passage of a law authorizing the acceptance of proposals\r\nfor privateers. He denounced the proclamation of President Lincoln\r\nin relation to Southern ports as a mere paper blockade. \"The loan\r\nauthorized,\" he said, \"had been promptly taken (by whom, or on what\r\nterms, he did not say); and that a much larger amount had now become\r\nnecessary to defray the expenses of the war,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis Congress authorized President Davis to issue letters of marque and\r\nreprisal, and prescribed regulations for the conduct of privateers. It\r\nalso passed an act prohibiting the export of cotton or cotton yam from\r\nany of the Confederate States, except through their own seaports, under\r\na penalty of forfeiture of the cotton, a fine of five thousand dollars,\r\nand six months' imprisonment. It further proposed that the planters\r\nshould be invited to put their crops into the hands of the government,\r\nand accept Confederate bonds for their value. On the 20th of May, 1861,\r\nthis Congress adjourned, to reassemble at Richmond, Va., in two months.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July, 1861, the Confederate Congress reassembled at\r\nRichmond. Meanwhile the cabinet had been enlarged as follows:\r\n\r\n               Secretary of the Navy...........S. R. Mallory, of Florida.\r\n\r\n               Postmaster-General...............J. H. Reagan, of Texas.\r\n\r\n               Attorney-General.................J. P. Benjamin, of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThis Congress included sixty-eight members, of whom fifteen were\r\nfrom Virginia, ten from North Carolina, nine from Alabama, three from\r\nFlorida, ten from Georgia, six from Louisiana, seven from Mississippi,\r\neight from South Carolina.\r\n\r\nPresident Davis stated in his message that \"fifty million dollars had\r\nbeen subscribed in cotton,\" and that \"late crops had been abundant.\"\r\nAmong the first acts of this reassembled Congress was to adopt the\r\nconvention of Paris in 1856, in respect to maritime law, whereby the\r\nwishes of Great Britain were acceded to in all respects. This was, in\r\neffect, that enemies' goods should be respected in neutral ships, and\r\nthat privateering should be abolished in time of war. The United States\r\ngovernment had demurred to these propositions, for reasons ably stated\r\nat the time by Secretary Marcy, and afterwards reaffirmed by Secretary\r\nSeward. Had they become a part of national law, Great Britain could have\r\ntaken every bale of cotton from the ports of the Southern Confederacy\r\nwithout let or hindrance. So far as the Confederacy was concerned, this\r\nact of their Congress gave full consent; but the United States still\r\nobjected, nor had the propositions been concurred in by all other\r\nnations. This same Congress empowered President Davis to appoint two\r\ncommissioners, with full powers, to proceed to Great Britain and other\r\nEuropean countries, to negotiate a recognition of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, and, if practicable, make treaties of commerce.\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly stated the organization, the acts, and the position\r\nof the Southern Confederacy with regard to financial and cotton\r\nquestions--the only questions now under consideration--we will next\r\ntrace the acts of the United States government bearing upon the same\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nWhen the Confederate Congress first met at Montgomery, Mr. Buchanan\r\nstill occupied the Presidential chair at Washington; but he had done\r\nnothing to interfere with the organization of the Southern Confederacy,\r\nnor, in his view of the case, had he any power or authority to\r\ninterfere. One month after, on the 4th of March, 1861, Abraham Lincoln,\r\nof Illinois, was inaugurated President, Hannibal Hamlin, of Maine,\r\nVice-President, and immediately after the cabinet of Mr. Lincoln was\r\nformed as follows:\r\n\r\n               Secretary of State....................Wm.

The blockading squadron on\r\nthe Atlantic coast, on the 4th of July, 1861, consisted of twenty-two\r\nvessels, with 290 guns and 3300 men, under command of flag-officer\r\nStringham. The Gulf squadron, at the same time, consisted of twenty-one\r\nvessels, with 282 guns and 3500 men, under flag-officer Mervin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0037]\r\n\r\nThis Congress authorized a loan of $ 170,000,000; but made no effort at\r\nall to negotiate a loan abroad, as it was well understood that English\r\ncapitalists were passively hostile to the war, and, so far as they could\r\nconsistently, favored the Southern Confederacy. With them cotton was\r\nking, and from the first moment of its life the Southern Confederacy did\r\nwhat it could to increase the love between King Cotton and his British\r\nadmirers. Indeed, it was felt all over the North (and hoped for in the\r\nSouth) that there was some danger of European interference, since\r\nthe desire for cotton, the eagerness for free trade, and the hope of\r\nimmediate gain might prompt to an interference which the aristocratic\r\nelement of Great Britain, and the friends of despotism in France, would\r\nhave rejoiced to see undertaken.\r\n\r\nNot long after the United States government had given notice to other\r\nnations of the blockading of Southern ports, efforts were made to break\r\nor disregard it. Liverpool merchants claimed that, under the treaty\r\nbetween this country and Great Britain, they had the right to enter any\r\nport of the United States, and that the attempt to enforce the blockade\r\nagainst British ships was an infringement of national law. The English\r\ngovernment having already recognized the blockade as a belligerent\r\nright, the British minister in reply told the Liverpool merchants that\r\n\"if any British ship, being a neutral, knowingly attempts to break an\r\neffective blockade, she is liable to capture and condemnation.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this notification, scores of British merchants resolved\r\nto take the risk of running the blockade, because of the immense profits\r\nto be made therefrom. To buy cotton for ten cents, and then sell it\r\nfor thirty cents, per pound, and then to pay the ten cents in arms,\r\naccoutrements, and other English manufactured goods, on which they could\r\nmake a profit of at least one hundred per cent., were opportunities\r\nwhich seldom occurred, and which, in-their estimation, would justify\r\ngreat risks. Nor were British merchants the only ones who took this view\r\nof the case, as the sequel of this history will show. The merchants and\r\nother moneyed men of New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore were just as\r\neager for the \"almighty dollar,\" and were quite as ready to take risks\r\nto obtain it. The risk was lessened from the fact that the coast to be\r\nguarded extended over three thousand miles; that the number of vessels\r\nto guard it (heretofore given) were but few in proportion to the length\r\nof coast; and that the Southern Confederacy was as anxious to have them\r\nbring their goods and take their cotton in exchange, as English and\r\nNorthern merchants 'were to do it. Every Confederate fort and every\r\nConfederate soldier was ready to render all the aid possible to every\r\nblockade runner, no matter whether from London, Liverpool, Nassau, New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, or Baltimore. As an evidence of the extent to which\r\ntrade by blockade running was carried on, it has been estimated that the\r\namount of ships and cargoes sent in by English capitalists to the\r\none port of Wilmington, N. C., from January, 1863, to December, 1864,\r\namounted to $66,000,000. What, meanwhile, was the extent of trade\r\nbetween Wilmington and other Southern ports with New York, Philadelphia,\r\nand Baltimore capitalists is not known, but probably as great, if not\r\ngreater, than with English capitalists.\r\n\r\nAnother fact, which greatly contributed to blockade running and other\r\nclandestine trade, was that all through the North there were warm\r\nsympathizers with the South--some of whom had been born in the South,\r\nothers had relatives and friends there, others had had extensive\r\nbusiness relations with Southern men, and still others sympathized with\r\nthe South from a political standpoint--each and all of whom were ready\r\nto help the South in any way they could; and yet to save themselves from\r\ncensure, if not from arrest, felt obliged to call themselves \"Union\"\r\nmen. These men were everywhere, and often where least suspected.\r\n\r\nKattell, in his \"History of the Great Rebellion,\" in writing of the\r\ndifficulties under which President Lincoln's administration labored\r\nfor the first few months, says: \"The diplomatic corps abroad and the\r\nincumbents of office at the North were most of them inclined to thwart\r\nthe action of the new administration, and in their train was a large\r\nnumber of active men on whom the government could not depend, if it had\r\nno opposition to encounter. The new administration found itself thus\r\ncompletely in the power of the secession party, and all its secrets,\r\nfrom the cabinet debates to the details of orders, were known to the\r\nSouth. The bureaus of the departments, the judiciary, the army and navy,\r\nand the offices were all filled with persons who were eagerly watching\r\nto catch up and transmit every item of information that might aid the\r\nConfederates, or thwart the government.\"\r\n\r\nThe above is true so far as it goes, but it is only a very small part\r\nof the whole truth--not the one hundredth part of what we now know to be\r\ntrue, some parts of which will be told in the following pages.\r\n\r\nMacaulay's description of the condition of England, immediately\r\npreceding the signing of the treaty of Rys-wick, portrays the condition\r\nof the United States government during a portion, if not during the\r\nwhole time of the war, quite as well as if written for the purpose.\r\nHe says: \"Her secret enemies had commanded her fleets and armies, had\r\nministered at her altars, had taught at her universities, had swarmed in\r\nher public offices, had sat in her Parliament, had bowed and fawned in\r\nthe bedchamber of her King.\" The facts and incidents hereafter to be\r\nrelated will show, in part, and would show wholly, if all were told that\r\nis known, that what Macaulay says of the condition of England from 1689\r\nto 1697, was no less true of the United States from 1861 to 1865.\r\nOf course, all this inured greatly to the benefit of the Southern\r\nConfederacy, but was as greatly detrimental to the United States\r\ngovernment, and at times made final success seem very doubtful, if not\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0043]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. ESTABLISHING STATIONS--FIRST TRIP AND FIRST PASSENGERS.\r\nBRAINS AND CAUTION SHIFTING THE SCENES.\r\n\r\n|THE battle of Gettysburg, fought on the 2d and 3d of July, 1863, was\r\none of the most important, if not _the_ most important, battle of the\r\nwhole war. The conflict had now been going on for over two years with\r\nvarying success. Each side had used its utmost efforts for success, and\r\nto the general public the end seemed no nearer than in the beginning;\r\nbut those behind the scenes saw things in a different light, and\r\nespecially was this true of President Davis and his cabinet. While he\r\nand they well understood the advantages of keeping up a fair outside\r\nshow, they knew equally well that the proportion of strength had greatly\r\nchanged between the North and the South. Commencing with proportions of\r\ntwo to one (20 to 10) they had reached the proportions of three to one\r\n(15 to 5), and another such battle as that which had just occurred--in\r\nwhich the losses on both sides were immense, and in which both sides\r\nthought themselves defeated, and were making preparations for retreat on\r\nthe day following--would make the disproportion still greater.\r\n\r\nThey knew, too, that every day made their situation more and more\r\ndesperate; that every day increased the effectiveness of the blockade;\r\nthat food, clothing, and all the necessaries of life were every day\r\nbecoming scarcer; and while they still had almost any quantity of\r\ncotton, they knew the people could not eat that, and unless some new\r\nsource of nutrition for the Confederacy could be opened, it must soon\r\nsuccumb from mere exhaustion. To add still further to the difficulty,\r\ntheir communication with the North seemed about to be cut off entirely.\r\nUp to that time their letters from their Northern sympathizers, from\r\nEngland, and from other parts of the world, had reached them through\r\nblockade-runners, mostly by the way of Nassau; but the recent capture of\r\nsome of these blockade-runners, and the stricter watch now kept by the\r\nUnited States blockading squadron, made this source look more and more\r\ndoubtful, and certainly less and less reliable.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis, when United States Senator and when Secretary of War, had\r\ncredit for brains and great shrewdness; but never did he need them so\r\nmuch as now, and as \"necessity is the mother of invention,\" the fact\r\nof the need called forth from his fertile brain a plan of domestic\r\ndiplomacy which would have done credit to Pitt in his palmiest days.\r\nHowever good a conception or plan may be, still it is of no use unless\r\nit can be put into execution, and just here was President Davis's\r\ngreatest trouble. He had scores of officers about him ready to do his\r\nslightest bidding, but among them all he could think of no one exactly\r\nfitted for the kind of service he then had in view. When in his greatest\r\ndistress of mind, walking the floor for hours at a time, thinking,\r\nthinking, thinking, it happened that Colonel Ralph Abercrombie, who was\r\nin command of a Louisiana regiment in General A. P. Hill's corps,\r\ncame into Richmond, and, as was his custom, called immediately at the\r\nexecutive mansion. The Colonel had been known to Mr. and Mrs. Davis\r\nsince a boy. Mr. Davis, when Secretary of War, had appointed him to a\r\nlieutenancy in the regular army. Both Mr. and Mrs. Davis were on the\r\nmost intimate terms with his widowed mother, and though the Colonel was\r\nnow about thirty years of age, they still called him Ralph.\r\n\r\nWhen, on this visit, he observed the President's anxiety, he naturally\r\ninquired the cause, and soon learned from Mr. Davis the outlines of his\r\nplan. The Colonel at once offered his services to put the President's\r\nplan into execution, only suggesting that, instead of opening the route\r\nto Washington via Chesapeake Bay and Leonardstown, Md., he would prefer\r\na more northern route, for the reason that he was better acquainted with\r\nthe Potomac between the Great Falls and Cumberland than with the route\r\nproposed by President Davis. When a lad, he had attended St. James'\r\nCollege, near Hagerstown, Md., and, by frequent drives through the\r\ncountry, had learned every foot of ground between that point and\r\nWashington city.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis listened attentively, and when the Colonel had finished, he\r\nquickly replied that his offer of services had relieved his mind of a\r\ngreat anxiety; that he would accept them most gladly; and that he\r\nwould agree to any route upon which the Colonel might fix. He told the\r\nColonel, in addition, that he would appoint, to assist him, any one whom\r\nhe might name, and that in opening and establishing the route he could\r\nemploy whoever he pleased, and use any amount of funds that might seem\r\nnecessary, as the project involved millions of money, if not the very\r\nlife of the Confederacy; and that the few thousands it might cost would\r\nonly be as dust in the balance, as compared with the advantages to be\r\ngained.\r\n\r\nColonel Abercrombie immediately turned over the command of his regiment\r\nto Major Charles Hall (the Lieutenant-Colonel, John H. Black, being on\r\nsick leave from a wound received at Gettysburg), and entered upon the\r\nduty of opening this new route to Washington. From Richmond to Orange\r\nCourt-House (General Lee's headquarters) was by rail, and involved no\r\ndifficulty. From thence to the Rapidan River, on the southerly side\r\nof which lay the Confederate army, and on the northerly side the Union\r\narmy, was easy enough; but from thence, to first get through the Union\r\nline of pickets, and then traverse about seventy miles of country, until\r\nthe Potomac was reached at or near the Great Falls, about twelve miles\r\nabove Washington, was the tug of war. To establish this latter part of\r\nthe route involved the employment of about twenty men--some as guides\r\nfrom point to point; some to furnish horses, or other conveyances, to\r\nthe blockade-runners and their passenger guests; some to entertain and\r\nconceal them whenever they came that way; some to be on the constant\r\nlookout, and pass the word from post to post, if any danger threatened\r\nthe blockade-runners or any of their employees; some to row them across\r\nthe Potomac, and meanwhile keep their boats concealed from the eyes of\r\nUnion troops and guards; and others to pass them through safely from\r\nthe Great Falls to Washington and return. The men so employed included\r\nplanters or farmers, doctors, merchants, and day-laborers, all of whom\r\nreceived pay for their services from the Confederacy, through the hands\r\nof Colonel Abercrombie or Colonel Kill-gore. Besides these, the guides\r\nhad under pay three old negro women, at whose huts they stopped and\r\nconcealed themselves and guests, whenever occasion required. At Great\r\nFalls, Messrs. Garrett & Morse, merchants, were the principal agents.\r\nUpon them depended mainly the keeping open of the line from that point\r\nto Washington city; the crossing of the Potomac at or near that point;\r\nand to see that the guides on the Virginia side of the Potomac were\r\nalways ready for service. At Washington city the grand depot, or end\r\nof the line, was at Ben Beveridge's saloon, and the \"Washington House,\"\r\nkept by Ben's mother, at the corner of Third Street and Pennsylvania\r\nAvenue. Ben furnished the disguises for both conductors and passengers\r\non this line, and was always ready to lend a helping hand in any way in\r\nwhich his services could be made available. His first advance pay for\r\nservices was two thousand dollars in gold, to which additions were made\r\nfrom time to time until he received from eight thousand to ten thousand\r\ndollars, all in gold. All these men were in entire sympathy with the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, and nearly all offered their services gratuitously\r\nwhen first spoken to on the subject by Colonel Abercrombie; but his plan\r\nwas to bind every man to greater faithfulness by having him to accept\r\npay from the Confederacy, and hence he would not accept of gratuitous\r\nservice from any one. How many thousands or tens of thousands of dollars\r\nwere distributed by Colonel Abercrombie and Colonel Killgore, for the\r\nConfederacy, in this service, we are unable to say, but certainly a\r\ngood many. It took about six weeks of faithful service for Colonel\r\nAbercrombie to open this new line, and, when completed, he returned to\r\nRichmond and reported to President Davis that the line was now ready for\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nMr. Davis approved of all that had been done, and asked Colonel\r\nAbercrombie whom he would have as an assistant. The Colonel named his\r\npersonal friend, Colonel Newton Killgore, who was then on detached\r\nservice at Charleston, S. C. Killgore was a graduate of West Point, and\r\na Lieutenant in the Topographical Engineer Corps, U. S. A., previous\r\nto the breaking out of the war. He was then about twenty-seven years\r\nof age, active, energetic, wide-awake, and just the man, as Colonel\r\nAbercrombie thought, for such service. Mr. Davis sent for him, and after\r\nexplaining the kind of service to be done, placed him upon the duty, and\r\ndirected him to hold himself in constant readiness for orders, which he\r\ndid from that time forth.\r\n\r\nThe first service, on this new line, required by President Davis of\r\nColonel Abercrombie, was to carry eleven letters to, and open personal\r\nnegotiations with, Major Weightman, of Washington; George Thomas, John\r\nP. Grundy, Alexander Gibson, of Baltimore; Dr. Charles Howell, C. C.\r\nPollard, George J. Platt, of Philadelphia; Mr. McLane, President of\r\nthe New York Pacific Mail Steamship Company, Mr. Waddell, of the same\r\ncompany, and John Lamb and Alexander Goldsmith, brokers, of New York\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nWith Major Weightman Mr. Davis had been on most intimate terms of\r\nfriendship for many years. Both were Mississippians, both had been in\r\nthe Mexican war, where Major Weightman gained considerable notoriety,\r\nwas badly wounded, returned home, married a rich lady at Jackson, Miss,\r\n(a Miss Willowby), resigned his commission in the regular army, removed\r\nto Washington, and from thenceforth lived a quiet, retired life in\r\nthat city. When the war broke out between the North and South, Major\r\nWeightman still continued his residence in Washington city, and soon\r\nbecame on most intimate terms with Secretary Seward and President\r\nLincoln. When rallied about his position, he always replied that he was\r\n\"a Union man,\" and there left it. His word was regarded as law, and no\r\none questioned him further. Meanwhile, however, all his sympathies were\r\nwith the South, and he was in almost constant communication with Mr.\r\nDavis. Through him Mr. Davis first learned of these other gentlemen to\r\nwhom he now wrote, and with some of whom he had, after learning of\r\nthem, kept up a correspondence. Mr. Davis now wanted arms, provisions,\r\nclothing, while these gentlemen, he knew, wanted cotton, and the object\r\nof the present letters and negotiations was to exchange the one for\r\nthe other--to the great advantage of the Confederacy, and with immense\r\nprofit to those who might take part in the speculation. The Confederacy\r\nhad taken in exchange for bonds, had taken for taxes, and had otherwise\r\nbecome in possession of millions upon millions of dollars' worth of\r\ncotton. The gentlemen to whom these letters were addressed possessed, or\r\ncould control, millions upon millions of dollars in money, and with this\r\nmoney could purchase what the South then stood so much in need of--arms,\r\nfood, and clothing. The cotton was greatly needed by American and\r\nEnglish manufacturers, and could be sold at a price five times greater\r\nthan Mr. Davis would sell it to them for. On the goods which they\r\nwould exchange for the cotton, immense profits could be made. The only\r\ndifficulty was in getting the cotton out of the Confederacy, or in\r\nsecuring it from destruction while it had to remain there. To effect\r\nthis they must either run the blockade, or so cajole President Lincoln,\r\nhis cabinet, and his generals in the field as to secure the cotton\r\nwhenever the Union armies reached the places where the cotton was\r\ndeposited. The risk in all this was considerable, but the immense\r\nprofits to be gained far more than overbalanced the risks.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Washington, Colonel Abercrombie went directly to the house\r\nof Major Weightman. The two soon after met at Ben Beveridge's, and then\r\nand there negotiated for a suite of rooms in the \"Washington House,\" to\r\nbe all the time kept for the agents of, and all the while paid for by,\r\nthe Southern Confederacy. An order for two thousand dollars in gold was\r\nhanded Ben Beveridge at once, as an earnest of what he might expect\r\nif he proved faithful and true. Three days after, Major Weightman and\r\nColonel Abercrombie went to Baltimore to call upon Mr. George Thomas.\r\nAfter the delivery of President Davis's letter, and a general talk over\r\nthe matters to which the letter referred, Mr. Thomas concluded to call\r\ntogether a few well known Southern sympathizers at a dinner-party next\r\nday, when and where the whole subject could be thoroughly canvassed.\r\nThe dinner came off next day, as proposed, and around the table were\r\ngathered the following well-known gentlemen: Mr. George Thomas, John\r\nP. Grundy, Dr. Leslie Buckler, Alexander R. Gibson, Major Weightman,\r\nColonel Abercrombie, James Wilson, J. W. Jenkins. The result of this\r\nconference was entirely in favor of President Davis's wishes.\r\n\r\nNext day Major Weightman and Colonel Abercrombie, accompanied by Mr.\r\nJames Wilson, went to Philadelphia, and called at once upon Dr. Charles\r\nHowell, then living on Rittenhouse Square. After delivery of letters and\r\ntalking over matters somewhat, Dr. Howell, like Mr. Thomas, decided\r\nto call together at a dinner-party next day a few well known Southern\r\nsympathizers, when and where the whole subject could be thoroughly\r\ndiscussed. This was done, and the following gentlemen were present: Dr.\r\nCharles Howell, C. C. Pollard, George J. Platt, Philip Swift, Charles H.\r\nMason, Jacob Florence, Major Weightman, Colonel Abercrombie, and Messrs\r\nMcLane, Lamb, and Waddell, of the New York Pacific Mail Steamship\r\nCo., who had been invited by telegraph. Here, too, the result of the\r\nconference was entirely favorable to Mr. Davis's wishes; but, before\r\na final conclusion of the negotiations, it was deemed best that Messrs\r\nLamb and Waddell should accompany Colonel Abercrombie back to Richmond,\r\nsee President Davis personally, take a general trip through the\r\nConfederate States, and, on their return, report to an adjourned\r\nmeeting. Meanwhile, whatever funds Mr. Davis might need should be\r\nfurnished Major Weightman, to be deposited by him with Mr. Riggs, the\r\nbanker at Washington, to the credit of the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were all satisfactory to Colonel Abercrombie except\r\nthe piloting of Messrs. Lamb and Waddell through the Union lines to\r\nRichmond. This, he feared, would be a difficult, if not an impossible,\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nWhile he recognized the fact that both these gentlemen might sit in\r\ntheir Wall Street banking-offices with all the dignity of a Sir\r\nJosiah Child, or grace a lady's parlor with all the urbanity of a\r\nLord Chesterfield, yet he feared that when disguised as farmers or\r\nday-laborers, when required to tug along on foot for several miles at a\r\ntime, and then ride, pell-mell, on horseback for a score of miles at a\r\ntime; when compelled to sleep in garrets or in the loft of a negro-hut;\r\nwhen required to prevaricate, or even to lie, in order to get by a Union\r\nsentinel, they might not be quite equal to the occasion. The Colonel\r\ntried to persuade them to go by the way of Nassau, and from there run\r\nthe blockade into Charleston, as he himself had done when he first\r\nentered the Confederate States; but the more he tried to persuade them\r\nto this course, the more determined they were to go with him. Over the\r\ndifficulties and hardships mentioned by the Colonel, they only laughed,\r\nsaid they could stand it all, that it would be as holiday-sport to\r\nthem, and that, in a day or two, both would meet the Colonel at Ben\r\nBeveridge's, in Washington, and from thence make their way with him to\r\nRichmond.\r\n\r\nThe third day after, Messrs. Lamb and Waddell were in Washington, and\r\nthat night, between eleven and twelve o'clock, left Beveridge's,\r\n_en route_ for Richmond. Ben and Weightman accompanied them to a Mr.\r\nThecker's house, in Georgetown, where the disguises were to be put on.\r\nLamb first placed himself in the hands of the manipulators. He had been\r\nwearing long chin whiskers; these Ben cut off at one fell swoop, leaving\r\nhis face as bare as a child's. Next, his hair was nicked and chopped\r\nover, as if done with a pair of sheep-shears, in the hands of a country\r\nbumpkin, instead of by a Broadway barber. Then he was stripped of his\r\nlatest-fashioned coat, vest, and pants, and in their place was supplied\r\nwith a suit which would have done credit to an ox-team driver. Waddell\r\ncame next. His magnificent beard, covering his entire face, was cut\r\nclean off, and, in place thereof, two false \"mutton-chop\" side whiskers\r\nand a false moustache, both butternut-color, were put on his face.\r\nNext, Ben applied the shears to Waddell's head, and pretty soon his hair\r\npresented the appearance of a country ox driver's. Then he, too, was\r\nstripped of his Broadway suit, and in a few minutes transmogrified into\r\na fat, jolly farmer, or a Conestoga team-driver. The Colonel was already\r\nin disguise, and had been ever since he left his uniform at Mr. Joseph\r\nMix's, about eleven miles within the Confederate lines, and now it only\r\nrequired a little touching up, which the Colonel did for himself while\r\nthe others were laughing over their own outlandish appearance.\r\n\r\nAbout one o'clock in the morning all were ready for a start. Ben\r\nconsented to go along until the first guard was passed--Major Weightman\r\nto wait at Thecker's until Ben returned. It was the latter part of\r\nAugust, 1863, and the nights, just then, were not only very warm, but\r\nvery dark. Ben led the way, Lamb and Waddell followed, and the Colonel\r\nserved as rear-guard. When Ben, who was several hundred yards in\r\nadvance, reached the canal-lock, near which a guard was stationed, he\r\nplayed the drunkard, and cursed the lock-tender loud enough for the\r\nguard to hear. The lock-tender was one of the Colonel's men, and in the\r\npay of the Confederacy. He knew Ben's voice, and knew, too, that the\r\nColonel was not far off Ben told the lock-tender, in a voice loud enough\r\nfor the guard to hear, that he had plenty of whiskey and plenty of\r\ncigars in his pockets, and wondered if the guard would n't like some.\r\nThe lock-tender thought it probable, whereupon Ben staggered off towards\r\nthe guard, flourishing a bottle of whiskey as he went, and crying out to\r\nthe guard, \"Don't shoot! Don't shoot!\" The bait took. The guard gave no\r\nchallenge--allowed Ben to approach him--took a good swig of whiskey\r\nfrom Ben's bottle--lit a cigar which Ben had handed him--entered into a\r\nrip-raving-swearing conversation with Ben; and, while all this was\r\ngoing on, the Colonel and his guests slipped quietly by, and were a good\r\nhalf-mile beyond the guard before Ben bade him good-night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0055]\r\n\r\nA further walk on the tow-path of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, for\r\nover two miles, brought the three travellers to Widow Ennis's farm-\r\nand lock-house. She was in the pay of the Confederacy; and within a\r\nhalf-hour from the time of reaching there, the three travellers were in\r\nthe saddle, and, accompanied by her son, to bring the horses back, on\r\ntheir way to the Great Falls. They rode along at a brisk trot, and part\r\nof the time the New York gentlemen were nearer the ears than the tails\r\nof their horses, nevertheless they managed to hold on, and, after a ride\r\nof nine miles, reached Hendrickson's, about a half-mile from the Falls.\r\nHere they dismounted. Joseph took the horses back to his mother's\r\nstable, while our three travellers walked on, about one mile, until they\r\nreached the garden-fence in the rear of the hotel, which they clambered\r\nover, or through, and finally got into the back-building of the hotel,\r\nthrough a private door. The Colonel knew all the points, and Lamb\r\nand Waddell had only to follow him to secure themselves and him from\r\nobservance by the Union sentinel, whose station was but a little way\r\nfrom the front of the hotel. At Hendrickson's they left the main road,\r\nand followed a by-path until they reached the garden in the rear of the\r\nhotel. In creeping through the garden-fence, Waddell tore his coat badly\r\nabout the shoulder, which distressed him not a little, and for which\r\nhe was heartily laughed at by his companions. Mr. Morse, who kept the\r\nhotel, was soon with his back-door customers, and certainly no guests\r\never received a more hearty welcome.\r\n\r\nGreat Falls, it may here be said, once for all, is neither a town nor a\r\nvillage; but consists of a large three-story stone building, used as a\r\nhotel for summer visitors, and as a private residence in the winter,\r\nand a large store-building, with numerous out-houses, used for\r\ntransportation purposes--all of which belong to the Chesapeake and Ohio\r\nCanal Company; but were at this time rented, and the business carried\r\non by Messrs. Garrett & Morse, the former of whom gave more especial\r\nattention to the store, and the latter to the hotel. Both were\r\nMarylanders; both sympathized heartily with the Southern cause,\r\nthough nominally \"strong Union men;\" both were under the pay of\r\nthe Confederacy; and both, or as a firm, received from the Southern\r\nConfederacy, at different times, through the hands of Colonels\r\nAbercrombie and Killgore, sums in gold amounting to between six and\r\neight thousand dollars. Both were first-class business men, of high\r\ncharacter, and, from their love of the Southern cause, would, doubtless,\r\nhave rendered it all the aid they could had they not received one cent\r\nof pay; but such was not the policy of President Davis or his agents.\r\nThey insisted that all who aided should be paid, and so long as cotton\r\ncould be converted into gold, this was possible, and certainly the true\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nIt was now about three o'clock in the morning, but the Colonel would not\r\nretire until he had sent for, and consulted with, Garrett, as to future\r\nmovements. From him the Colonel learned that the line was open, and in\r\ngood working order, that guide No. 1 would be on hand the next night to\r\nrow them across the Potomac, and conduct them to guide No. 2, and that,\r\nmeanwhile, all three should retire, and keep themselves entirely out of\r\nsight until the following night. The retiring and resting part suited\r\nLamb and Waddell exactly. Both were thoroughly tired from their long\r\nwalk and horseback ride, neither being at all used to that kind of\r\nexercise. Lamb was then about fifty, Waddell about forty years of age;\r\nthe first was lean, the latter fat; both knew how to handle gold and\r\ngreenbacks, but neither knew how to handle reins or sit a saddle,\r\nespecially when on the back of a rough trotting country farm-horse.\r\nTheir feet would slip through the stirrups; in descending hill, they\r\nwould, somehow or other, slip from their saddles towards the ears of\r\ntheir horses; and in going up hill it was with difficulty they kept from\r\nslipping off their saddles towards their horses' tails. They knew how\r\nto walk Broadway and Wall Street with as much grace as a French\r\ndancing-master; but when it came to walking on the tow-path of a canal,\r\nto creeping through garden-fences, and such like performances, neither\r\nof them could do it half as well as a country clod-hopper. Bed! rest! of\r\ncourse they were ready for bed and rest, and the sooner the better; and,\r\nsuiting the action to the word, both were soon in bed, and snoring away\r\nfor dear life.\r\n\r\nFor some cause or other, guide No. I did not put in an appearance next\r\nnight, and our travellers were obliged to keep themselves concealed for\r\nanother day. The following night, however, he came, and between nine and\r\nten o'clock the three slipped out of the back-door of the hotel, made\r\ntheir way to the boat, which was in waiting about a mile up the Potomac,\r\nwere rowed across by the guide, then walked about a mile to a negro-hut,\r\nand then about three miles more to a-farm-house. Here horses were\r\nprocured, and then for about thirty miles, mostly through private lanes\r\nand pig-paths, through woods and over fields, over torn-down fences and\r\nthrough open gates, they trudged along until they reached the farm-house\r\nof Dr. Carrico. It was now nearly daybreak, and our travellers were\r\nthoroughly tired out. The Doctor, who was in the pay of the Confederacy,\r\nthough within the Union lines, and nominally a \"Union man,\" received the\r\ntravellers with open arms, and in a little while had them safely tucked\r\naway in bed-chambers, where the eye of no chance Union soldier or\r\nvisitor could see them.\r\n\r\nHere they remained until the next night. Then with a new guide (guide\r\nNo. 2 having returned with the horses) they left Dr. Carrico's shortly\r\nafter nightfall, and, upon horses furnished by the Doctor, rode about\r\nthirty-two miles to the farm and mill of Mr. Henry Budd. In this long\r\nride, like the other, most of the way had to be made through private\r\nroads and pig-paths, as Union forces were in all that country, and\r\non the public highways there was danger of meeting Union cavalry or\r\ninfantry, as patrols or sentinels, at any moment. It was about three\r\no'clock in the morning when they reached Budd's mills. Just before\r\nreaching there our travellers dismounted, and the horses were slipped\r\ninto Budd's stable, as there was a Union sentinel at this mill who could\r\nnot be passed on horseback, and with whom some diplomacy had to be\r\nused to get by at all. To effect this, the Colonel, Lamb, and Waddell\r\napproached as near the mill as possible, and then secreted themselves,\r\nwhile the guide (No. 3) went forward to interest the sentinel in\r\nconversation, until they could slip by. The guide knew everybody in that\r\nneighborhood, and fortunately, knew the sentinel, so that with lively\r\nconversation, and an occasional drink from a well-filled canteen, he\r\nsoon had the sentinel so engrossed that the three travellers stepped\r\nacross the mill-race, slipped around on the other side of the mill, and\r\nsoon were a good half-mile beyond the sentinel. Here they waited in a\r\nwoods for their guide to come up. He, on the plea that he was going to\r\nsee an \"uncle\", on the other side, got away from the sentinel erelong,\r\nand soon after overtook the three travellers.\r\n\r\nFrom the point where the guide rejoined them, all four walked to the\r\nfarm-house of Mr. Jonathan Brisco, about four miles from Budd's mill.\r\nHere a Union sentinel had been placed as a safeguard, while easterly and\r\nwesterly from the house, sentinels were placed only a little way apart.\r\nThis was the extreme outer line of the Union army, and was guarded, of\r\ncourse, with extra vigilance. If once through this line our travellers\r\nthenceforth would be within the lines of the Confederate army and\r\nentirely safe, but just how to get through was now the problem to be\r\nsolved. The plan resolved upon was that Colonel Abercrombie, Lamb, and\r\nWaddell should remain concealed some distance from the house, while the\r\nguide should go forward and make arrangements with the sentinel to allow\r\nthe three to come up and go into the house to see his \"uncle,\" and then,\r\nwhile he interested the guard with lively conversation and occasional\r\ndrinks of whiskey, the three to slip out of the back-door, down through\r\nthe garden, over a meadow, through a creek, and as far and as fast as\r\npossible in the pines beyond. The plan all worked like a charm, except\r\nthat while the three were making their way from the house the sentinel\r\nchanced to observe them. He at once asked the guide what it meant. The\r\nguide replied that they were going to another neighbor's house, a little\r\nbeyond, to see about some corn, and would soon return to remain the\r\nbalance of the night with his \"uncle.\" The sentinel still seemed\r\ntroubled about having let the three men pass his post, and the guide,\r\nseeing this, and wanting to keep in the good graces of the Union\r\nsentinel, as he might need his services again, slipped fifty dollars\r\nin gold (which the Colonel had handed him for the purpose) into the\r\nsentinel's hand, which at once eased his mind and made everything seem\r\nexactly right.\r\n\r\nFrom this point the three travellers walked about six miles to Mr.\r\nAndrew Mitchell's. Here they procured horses, mounted at once, and rode\r\nthirteen miles, to Mr. Walter Randolph's, near a railroad station called\r\nChina Grove, about ten miles north-easterly from Orange Court House.\r\nProbably no three travellers ever rejoiced more over the completion of\r\na trip than these three on reaching China Grove station. They were\r\nnow among friends, and from this point they could go by railroad to\r\nRichmond. The Colonel soon doffed his disguise, and was again in the\r\nuniform he had left there when on his way to Washington. Messrs. Lamb\r\nand Waddell could not procure new suits until they reached Richmond, and\r\ntherefore had to content themselves with the old until then. About ten\r\no'clock the cars came along, our three travellers jumped aboard, and\r\nwithin an hour were at Orange Court-House, seated around the best\r\nbreakfast that mine host of Freeman's Hotel could get up. At two p.m.\r\nthey took the cars for Richmond, and before nightfall were at the\r\nSpottsylvania Hotel, in the capital of the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nNext morning early, Messrs. Lamb and Waddell were in quest of new suits,\r\nwhich they obtained from a readymade clothing-store, not far from the\r\nhotel. Next, they went to Mowrey's banking-house to exchange some of\r\ntheir gold for Confederate notes, which at that time was exchangeable at\r\nthe rate of eight dollars in Confederate notes for one dollar in gold.\r\nThen they returned to the hotel, and soon after were introduced to\r\nPresident Davis's private secretary, N. Burton Harris, Esq. He took them\r\nto the Executive Mansion and introduced them to Mr. Davis. With him they\r\nhad a long conference on business affairs, after which he introduced\r\nthem to and put them in special care of certain prominent gentlemen\r\nat the capital, whose duty and pleasure it would be to give them such\r\nadditional information as they might need, and accompany them to such\r\nother cities of the Confederacy as they might desire to visit. The\r\nColonel called upon the President the same evening, made a full report\r\nof all that he had seen and heard and done while at the North, and then\r\nleft to visit his regiment, which lay near Gordonsville.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Lamb and Waddell, after spending a few more days in and about\r\nRichmond, seeing what was to be seen and learning what was to be\r\nlearned, left for Newbern, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Mobile, and\r\nother places where Confederate cotton was in store. At all these points\r\nthey found immense quantities of cotton, some of which they were told\r\nhad been seven years gathered, and held meanwhile for better prices. At\r\neach place they found government agents, and others, who assured them\r\nthat the cotton could be got through the blockade, if they only had\r\nships on which to load it.\r\n\r\nThey saw, too, at every place they visited, a determined spirit on\r\nthe part of the people never to give over the struggle, until their\r\nseparation was achieved. Of course they did not see, and great care\r\nwas taken that they should not see, anything like destitution among the\r\npeople. The tables which they saw were all well spread, though it took\r\nthe last loaf of bread from the pantry or the last pickle from the jar.\r\nIt was a part of the masterly diplomacy of President Davis, and of\r\nthose who surrounded and upheld his hands, never to show a want, or cry\r\n_peccavi_, where a Northern ear could see the one or hear the other.\r\n\"Not one cent for tribute, but millions for defence,\" was their cry from\r\nfirst to last,--was their cry, indeed, until, when the egg was finally\r\nbroken, nothing was found but an empty shell.\r\n\r\nHaving finished their journey through the States of the Confederacy,\r\noccupying between two and three weeks, Messrs Lamb and Waddell returned\r\nto Richmond and reported to President Davis that they were entirely\r\nsatisfied with what they had seen and heard, and that, so soon as they\r\ncould report the facts to Messrs McLane, Thomas, Howell, and others,\r\nthere would be no difficulty whatever in his obtaining all the money\r\nand all the supplies he might at any time need in exchange for cotton.\r\nColonel Abercrombie was then telegraphed for, and on the day following\r\nreported at the Executive Mansion. From the President he received full\r\ninstructions as to further operations. He then informed Messrs Lamb and\r\nWaddell that he was now ready to conduct them back to Washington.\r\nNext day they started by rail for China Grove station. Here, at Mr.\r\nRandolph's, they exchanged uniform and fashionable suits for their\r\nformer disguises, and from thence traversed about the same route, rode\r\nand walked about the same distances, met with about the same incidents\r\nas when on the outward trip, until they finally reached Ben Beveridge's\r\nin Washington city. Here they met Major Weightman and informed him of\r\nall they had seen and learned. Then on to Baltimore, where they called\r\nupon, and reported to, Mr. Thomas and his associates. From this point\r\nthe Colonel returned to Washington, while Messrs Lamb and Waddell\r\nwent on to Philadelphia, where they reported to Dr. Howell and his\r\nassociates; and then to New York, where they reported to Mr. McLane and\r\nothers. All to whom they reported expressed entire satisfaction as to\r\nthe result of their trip, and were ready to invest in the enterprise to\r\nthe extent of their means. Not long after, a general meeting of all the\r\n\"cotton ring\" associates was held at Dr. Howell's, in Philadelphia, when\r\nplans were perfected to charter or purchase ships to send to Newbern,\r\nNorth Carolina, to be freighted with needed articles outward and cotton\r\ninward. It so happened that three of their vessels were seized by the\r\nblockading squadron, not many weeks after, and this for a time threw a\r\ncloud over their enterprise; but so soon as the loss was reported to Mr.\r\nDavis he gave them enough additional cotton to make up for the loss of\r\nthe three vessels and their cargoes. From thenceforth they met with but\r\nfew, if any, losses, though they continued operations, at various points\r\nalong the coast, until the fall of Fort Fisher, on the 15th of January,\r\n1865. How much the \"ring\" made in their cotton operations it would be\r\nimpossible to say; but we have it from an intimate friend of Mr. Gilmore\r\nMeredith's, of Baltimore, that his share of the profits amounted to a\r\n\"million of money,\" and if his share reached that amount, others, whose\r\ninvestments were far greater, must have reaped still larger amounts.\r\n\r\nThis cotton ring, made up of the gentlemen whom we have heretofore named\r\nas seated around the dinner-tables of Messrs. Thomas and Howell (besides\r\nMessrs. Gilmore Meredith, of Baltimore, Samuel Harding, Alphonso\r\nLip-pincott, and Alexander Goldsmith, of New York), must not be\r\nconfounded with the one, or more, mentioned by General L. C. Baker,\r\nchief of the national detective police, in his letter of January 30,\r\n1865, to Hon. E. B. Wash-burne, chairman of committee on commerce, in\r\nwhich the names of Thurlow Weed, Ward Lamon, Leonard I. Sweat, Wm. P.\r\nDole, D. Randolph Martin, B. F. Camp, Prescott Smith, A. H. Lazare,\r\nH. A. Risley, T. C. Durant, Samuel Norris, and Simeon Draper, occur as\r\nplaying principal parts.\r\n\r\nThese last named gentlemen were nearly all avowed Republicans, and\r\nseveral of them personal and intimate friends of President Lincoln and\r\nSecretary Seward. The others were mostly avowed Southern sympathizers\r\n(though nominally \"Union men\"), and some of them had long known, and\r\nbeen on most intimate personal terms with, President Davis, besides\r\nhaving friends and relatives scattered all over the South. The one had\r\nno object but to make the almighty dollar. The other had friendship, as\r\nwell as the almighty dollar, as a basis for action. Which of the two is\r\nmost to be commended, or most to be condemned, each reader must decide\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nAnd before closing this chapter we again beg to say--as stated in the\r\nintroductory chapter--that, while vouching for facts, we cannot in every\r\ninstance vouch for the names and dates given throughout this volume. Our\r\ninformants in every case meant to give us exact names and exact dates;\r\nbut the many years elapsing between the events and the relating of them\r\nto us, had caused a partial forgetting of names and dates, although the\r\nincidents remained as fresh in the minds of the relators as though they\r\nhad occurred but the day before. In second and all subsequent editions\r\nof this work, these errors (if such there be) will stand corrected, for\r\nso soon as this work gets before the public, errors, if any there\r\nbe, will doubtless be observed and corrected by such as were, or\r\nare, cognizant of the facts. The author most earnestly invites such\r\ncorrections, or any others that may be found in the work, as his aim\r\nfrom the first has been to \"set down naught in malice,\" nor to say\r\nanything of anybody, or in the relating of any event, but what is\r\nstrictly true.\r\n\r\nRICHMOND, VA., BEFORE THE WAR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0067]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. ANOTHER CONDUCTOR ON THE NEW LINE. CAUTION SLIDING THE\r\nSCENES.\r\n\r\n|IN the preceding chapter, mention is made of the fact that President\r\nDavis placed Colonel Newton Killgore on this same service; and in the\r\nsame paragraph a brief account is given of his accomplishments, and the\r\nposition he held in the United States army previous to the war. In\r\nthis chapter we purpose to give a bird's-eye view of his services as\r\nconductor on this new line, for running the land blockade.\r\n\r\nNot long after the time when Colonel Abercrombie had started on his\r\nfirst trip for Washington, President Davis sent for Colonel Killgore,\r\nand desired him to carry an order for arms and ammunition to Major\r\nWeightman, of Washington. He was directed, however, to await, at China\r\nGrove station, Colonel Abercrombie's return to that point, and then to\r\ngo on or return to Richmond, according as the negotiation of Colonel\r\nAbercrombie had been successful or otherwise. Accordingly, when Messrs.\r\nAbercrombie, Lamb, and Waddell reached Mr. Randolph's, they found\r\nColonel Killgore awaiting them. A consultation resulted in sending him\r\nforward on his mission with all convenient speed.\r\n\r\nHis general route was the same as that over which our three travellers\r\nhad just passed; his stopping places the same; his guides the same;\r\nand in due time he found himself in the rooms of the Confederacy at\r\nBen Beveridge's. Ben sent for Major Weightman. To him Colonel Killgore\r\ndelivered his orders, letters, and verbal messages; received from the\r\nMajor whatever of information and messages he had to send to President\r\nDavis, and within six hours was ready to start on his return trip for\r\nRichmond. He returned as he went, and within five days from the time of\r\nleaving Washington stood in the presence of Mr. Davis, ready to give\r\nan account of his mission. Everything had been done to the entire\r\nsatisfaction of the President, and the Colonel was directed to hold\r\nhimself in constant readiness for like orders.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Colonel Killgore made frequent trips between Richmond and\r\nWashington. Of course he wore a disguise, and acted the part of a green\r\ncountry bumpkin: and so well did he wear the one, and assume the other,\r\nthat never, but on two occasions, did he meet with incidents worthy of\r\nspecial record.\r\n\r\nThe first of these occurred as follows: After delivering messages and\r\ndocuments to Major Weightman, he proceeded to Baltimore, to deliver\r\nothers to Mr. Thomas. While at the Fountain Hotel it chanced that his\r\nfalse moustache became loose, or somewhat disarranged. He stepped before\r\na mirror, in the public reading-room, to readjust it, and, while doing\r\nso, observed a gentleman watching him very closely. Leaving that hotel\r\ninstantly, he went to Barnum's, but was scarcely there before he noticed\r\nthe same gentleman, who had watched him in the other hotel, again eyeing\r\nhim closely. Soon the gentleman stepped up to him, and called him by\r\nhis first name. The Colonel immediately recognized him as an old army\r\nfriend, whom he had not seen for many years, and whom he had little\r\nthought to meet there, and under such circumstances. The gentleman was\r\na Southerner; recognized, and entirely approved of the Colonel's new\r\nposition as Ambassador Extraordinary between high contracting parties;\r\nand in a little while after they were drinking the health of each other,\r\nand confusion to their enemies. The Colonel at first feared that one of\r\nBaker's detectives had discovered his disguise while he was arranging\r\nhis moustache, as before related, and felt not a little relieved when\r\nhis observer turned out to be a friend instead of an enemy. He never\r\nagain adjusted his false moustache in the reading-room of a hotel.\r\n\r\nThe other incident occurred as follows: He had been to Washington, and\r\nwas on his return to Richmond. Crossing the Potomac, at a point above\r\nthe Great Falls, he was accosted by a man on the Virginia side, who\r\nwanted to know where he had come from, and where he was going? Colonel\r\nKillgore replied that he lived in Maryland, not far from the Falls,\r\nand was on his way to visit a friend on the Virginia side. Other\r\nconversation followed, until the Colonel thought his questioner was\r\nsatisfied, though he meanwhile had fully made up his mind that his\r\nquestioner was none other than one of General Baker's secret detectives.\r\nThe Colonel finally bade his questioner good-bye, and started to leave,\r\nwhen his questioner cried out, \"Stop! I believe you are a spy--you are\r\nmy prisoner!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am not!\" answered Colonel Killgore, and instantly sent a bullet\r\nwhizzing into the brain of his questioner. The man fell, and died at\r\nonce. An examination of the papers upon his person proved him to be,\r\nas the Colonel had suspected, one of the captains of General Baker's\r\nNational Detective force. His body was left precisely where it fell,\r\nwhile Colonel Killgore proceeded on his journey, and in due time arrived\r\nin Richmond. When the body of the captain was found, some days after, it\r\nwas discovered that a bullet had pierced his brain; but it was not known\r\nthen, nor, except to a very few, was it ever known afterwards, who sent\r\nit there. This is the first publication of the real facts of the case,\r\nthough the newspapers of the time were full of suppositions, not one of\r\nwhich was true, or anywhere near true.\r\n\r\nColonel Killgore continued one of the conductors on this line until the\r\nline was closed. After the war he returned to Charleston, studied law,\r\nwas admitted to practice, and when last heard from was doing a large\r\nand successful business, and was regarded as among the first men of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0073]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. NOBILITY AFTER THE NUGGETS. DIPLOMACY PROMPTING THE ACTORS.\r\n\r\n|IN September, 1863, cotton was quoted in New York city at 70 cents,\r\ngold at $1.29. The first indicated the great want for cotton by the\r\nmanufacturers of this country, of England, and of other parts of the\r\nworld. The second indicated the want of confidence, then existing, among\r\nthe moneyed men of the world in the stability of this government.\r\n\r\nThe great divorce trial then going on in the court of last resort--the\r\nCourt of Arms--in which the South, as representing the wife, was\r\ncomplainant, and the North, as representing the husband, was defendant,\r\nhad thus far been attended with varied success. In the first contest, at\r\nFort Sumter, the wife spit fire at the husband, and the husband quickly\r\nsuccumbed. In the second contest, at Bull Run, the wife flew at the\r\nhusband's eyes and ears, and he, to save both, ran back to Washington.\r\nIn the next, General Lyon, on behalf of the father, made a dash at\r\nGeneral Price, at Booneville, Mo., when the latter suddenly remembered\r\nthat he was needed elsewhere and left without ceremony. In Western\r\nVirginia, General McClellan sprang for the scalp of General Garnett,\r\nwhen the latter concluded that some point nearer Richmond would be more\r\nhealthy. And thus the trial had been dragging its slow length along,\r\nsometimes favorable to the complainant and sometimes to the defendant,\r\nup to the time mentioned at the opening of this chapter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the children on both sides only seemed the more determined\r\nto win finally, the oftener they were defeated temporarily; and\r\ncriminations and recriminations became harsher and fiercer on both\r\nsides. The children of the North sided with the father, and claimed that\r\nthe letter of the original contract must be kept; that in that contract\r\nthere was no provision for divorce, nor was it admissible now. The\r\nchildren of the South sided with the mother, and claimed that the\r\nfather had ill-treated the mother, had outgrown the mother, because of\r\nadvantages taken of her, and by every law, human and divine, she was\r\nentitled to a divorce. The children of the North claimed that even if\r\na legal divorce was possible, an equitable division of the estate was\r\nimpossible. That a considerable portion of the estate had been purchased\r\nwith blood, or treasure, or both, since marriage, and was so located\r\nthat division was impossible; that Texas, California, and New Mexico\r\nhad cost thousands of lives and one hundred and thirty-five millions\r\nof dollars, and could not now be divided; that Louisiana and the\r\nfree navigation of the Mississippi River had cost fifteen millions of\r\ndollars, and could not now be divided; that Florida had been purchased\r\nof Spain at a cost of six million dollars, and that it had cost\r\ntwenty-five millions more to get the Seminole Indians out of its swamps,\r\nand that it could not now be divided. To all this the children of the\r\nSouth replied, that not only what the mother had brought to the estate,\r\nbut all that had been since obtained, contiguous to that which she had\r\nbefore marriage, belonged of right to her and her alone, and that they\r\nwould maintain her in this right against all comers: The children of the\r\nNorth further complained that over three millions of the children of the\r\ncommon household were held in bondage by Southern masters, and that they\r\nmust be liberated ere we could hope to have permanent peace at home, or\r\nthe respect of nations abroad. The children of the South replied that\r\nthose held in bondage were the descendants of Ham, whom Noah, with God's\r\napproval, assigned to perpetual bondage to the sons of Shem and Japhet.\r\nTo this the children of the North replied that the New Dispensation of\r\nChrist, teaching forgiveness to all, kindness to all, love to all, had\r\ndone away with the Old Dispensation of \"an eye for an eye and a tooth\r\nfor a tooth,\" and that the command, \"Come unto me all ye ends of the\r\nearth,\" included the black man no less than the white. The children of\r\nthe South replied that they had not brought slavery into the family, nor\r\nwould they drive it out, and if others of the household attempted to do\r\nso, they would maintain it; and thus, too, this question stood up to the\r\ntime mentioned in the opening of this chapter.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter of this work we mentioned the fact that among the\r\nfirst acts of the first Confederate Congress was the authorizing of a\r\nloan of $15,000,000. Also, the fact that, at a subsequent meeting of\r\nthe Congress at Richmond, President Davis stated in his message that\r\n\"$50,000,000 had been subscribed in cotton.\" In neither case was it\r\nofficially stated who had subscribed for these loans, but there is\r\nscarcely a doubt that much the larger part was subscribed by British\r\ncapitalists. English manufacturers wanted the cotton; English\r\ncapitalists wanted a profitable investment for their surplus funds; the\r\nsympathies of the English nobility and of the upper classes generally\r\nwere then almost wholly with the Southern Confederacy; they believed,\r\nas Europeans generally believed then, that the South would succeed in\r\nestablishing a separate government; that, whether they succeeded or not,\r\nthe English government would so far interfere as to secure the getting\r\nof any cotton which English manufacturers and English capitalists might\r\npurchase of the Confederacy; and, under all these circumstances, it is\r\nnot at all surprising that a large part of the sixty-five millions\r\nnamed should have been subscribed for by British subjects; nor is it\r\nsurprising that after they had thus subscribed, and in some cases paid\r\ntheir money in advance by cashing Confederate bonds, they should have\r\nused extraordinary means--strange and eventful means--to secure the\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\nHaving thus made the frame and stretched on it the canvas, we are now\r\nready to paint the picture, and, when finished, it will, we think,\r\nfully justify the caption given to this chapter, \"Nobility after the\r\nNuggets\"--\"Diplomacy Prompting the Actors.\"\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of September, 1863, Lord John Brew-erton arrived in\r\nthe city of New York direct from London. So soon as the steamer in which\r\nhe came arrived at the wharf, he directed his valet to have his baggage\r\ntaken to the Astor House, while he, taking the first cab he found at the\r\nlanding, directed the driver to drive him with all possible speed to\r\nthe office of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, 88 Wall Street. On\r\nreaching the office he inquired for the president of the company, Mr.\r\nAllan McLane, found him in, and for the next two hours was closeted\r\nwith him. That same evening Mr. McLane called upon Lord Brewerton at the\r\nAstor House, dined with him, and again spent several hours with him in\r\nclose and confidential conversation--mostly with regard to the Southern\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nThe two following days Lord Brewerton spent in New York attending to\r\nvarious business matters, and on the third day he and Mr. McLane went\r\ntogether to Baltimore. At Philadelphia Mr. C. C. Pollard joined them.\r\nAt Baltimore they met Colonel Ralph Abercrombie, who chanced to be in\r\nWashington at the time, and who had been telegraphed for, through Major\r\nWeightman, to meet them at Baltimore. That night and the following day\r\nwere spent in consultations with Messrs. Thomas, Grundy, Wilson, and\r\nothers. In the evening McLane and Pollard returned to New York, while\r\nLord Brewerton and Colonel Abercrombie went to Washington. They walked\r\nfrom the depot direct to Ben Beveridge's, where a scene occurred which\r\nis difficult to put upon canvas--a scene much easier imagined than\r\ndescribed. When the two came into the saloon Ben was absorbed in\r\nconversation with some gentlemen, and did not see them enter. The\r\nColonel, desiring to attract Ben's attention without calling upon\r\nhimself the attention of others, stepped up to the bar and asked for\r\n\"Bourben whiskey,\" putting special emphasis on the word Bourben, as this\r\nwas the Confederate password which had been agreed upon between him and\r\nBen. The clerk behind the bar sat a bottle of Bourbon whiskey upon the\r\nmarble counter for the Colonel to help himself; but still Ben did\r\nnot come up, and kept on chatting and laughing with his friends. The\r\nColonel, determining to attract his attention, put the glass to his\r\nlips, and then, with an oath loud enough to wake the dead, smashed the\r\nglass into a thousand pieces on the marble counter, and declared that\r\nsuch BOURBEN as that was not fit for a dog to drink. Of course, Ben\r\nrushed to the counter to see who had dared commit such an outrage in his\r\nsaloon; the Lord shrank back aghast, as though an earthquake was about\r\nto open under his feet; some Indians who chanced to be in the saloon at\r\nthe time became very much excited and seemed about to raise a war-whoop,\r\nand, for a moment, confusion worse confounded prevailed; but so soon\r\nas Ben recognized the Colonel he comprehended the whole situation,\r\nacknowledged that his clerk had made a mistake in setting out some other\r\nbottle than \"Bourben,\" made a thousand apologies for the mistake, and\r\nthen, in a tone as mild as that of a sucking-dove, invited the Colonel\r\nand his friend \"John\" into a side room, where they might take a drink\r\nalone by themselves. The outsiders had been completely hoodwinked, while\r\nthe insiders had a hearty laugh all to themselves over the incident and\r\nits happy ending. Major Weightman was then sent for, and when he came he\r\nand Lord Brewerton had a conference of some hours. When this had ended,\r\na cab was called, and Lord Brewerton was driven direct to the residence\r\nof the British Minister, Lord Lyons, while the Colonel was driven to his\r\nsister's (Mrs. Professor Joseph H. Saxton), on Capitol Hill.\r\n\r\nLord Brewerton remained with Lord Lyons some days, and then returned to\r\nNew York, with the expectation of returning at once to England; but,\r\non reaching there, he found a cablegram awaiting him which required his\r\nimmediate return to Washington to see Lord Lyons, and, if possible,\r\nto make his way from thence to Richmond, to see President Davis. He\r\naccordingly returned next day to Washington, saw the British Minister,\r\nsaw Colonel Abercrombie, and finally succeeded in making arrangements\r\nwith the latter for an overland trip to Richmond. The Colonel explained\r\nto him the hardships which he would have to endure in making the trip\r\noverland, and tried hard to persuade him to return to New York and go by\r\nthe way of Nassau; but Lord Brewerton insisted that he could stand the\r\nhardships, and would much prefer it to a trip by sea. He was at this\r\ntime about fifty years of age, a gentleman of high mental culture, of\r\nelegant manners, had spent all his life in the very highest walks of\r\nsociety, and had not probably ever endured one hour of real hardship;\r\nbut his health was good, and he thought he would rather enjoy, than\r\notherwise, the hardships of which the Colonel spoke. At all events, he\r\ninsisted upon trying it, and so the matter was finally agreed upon.\r\n\r\nNext night, about ten o'clock, Major Weightman and Colonel Abercrombie\r\nleft Ben Beveridge's saloon in a close carriage; called at the English\r\nembassy for Lord Brewerton; then on to Thecker's, in Georgetown, where\r\nBen was waiting with the disguises. Here, under Ben's skilful hands,\r\nLord Brewerton underwent a complete transmogrification. His mutton-chop\r\nwhiskers were cut off; his hair chipped and hacked as though done with\r\na broad-axe; his fashionable suit laid aside, and a rough farmer's suit\r\nsubstituted; in place of his fine patent leather boots, a pair of negro\r\nclodhoppers were put upon his feet; in place of his fine beaver, a\r\ncoarse slouch hat; all of which my lord enjoyed and laughed over as\r\nheartily as the others. The Colonel being in disguise already, it only\r\ntook a rub or two here, and a scrape or two there, to make him ready for\r\nthe trip.\r\n\r\nBy midnight all were ready. As before, in the case of Lamb and Waddell,\r\nBen led the way, and, by playing drunk, and treating the sentinel with\r\nwhiskey and cigars, got them safely by the first post. From there\r\nthey walked about two miles to Widow Ennis' farm-house; thence rode to\r\nHendrickson's, nine miles; thence walked to the Falls, one mile. Here\r\nGarrett and Morse received them with open arms, and furnished such\r\nrefreshments as were needed. Mrs. Morse seemed specially impressed at\r\nthe presence of a live lord, and honored the occasion by putting on her\r\nbest silk dress before coming down-stairs to be introduced. The guide\r\nwas in waiting, and within two hours all three left their friends to\r\ncross the Potomac. To reach the place where the boat for crossing had\r\nbeen concealed required a walk of about two miles; and, when across,\r\nit required a walk of another mile to reach the negro hut of old \"Aunt\r\nRachel.\" It was now so near daylight that the Colonel deemed it unsafe\r\nto go further, so that all that day the three remained concealed in Aunt\r\nRachel's humble quarters. They could not venture outside the door even\r\nfor a moment, and at times the lord seemed in great distress at such\r\nclose confinement; but the day wore away at last, and soon after\r\nnightfall the three walked about four miles to Mr. Francis Latimer's.\r\nHere the Colonel had expected to get saddle-horses, as before, but the\r\nhorses were away, and nothing remained in the shape of a conveyance but\r\nan old mule, blind in one eye, and a two-wheel dirt-cart. After some\r\nconsultation and delay, it was decided to take these, and in a little\r\nwhile after the blind mule and two-wheeled cart, with an old darkey,\r\n\"Uncle Jarrett,\" as driver, stood before the door. Some straw had been\r\nthrown in the cart, on which our travellers might lay; but Mr. Latimer\r\nthought this beneath the dignity of a live lord, and therefore had an\r\nold splint-bottom chair set in the cart, on which the lord might sit,\r\nwhile the Colonel could lay upon the straw at his side.\r\n\r\nThe night was very dark, besides which the age and blindness of the mule\r\nmade him to stumble frequently. They had not gone half a mile before\r\nLord Brewerton found that his seat was a very uncertain and a very\r\nuncomfortable one. Down would go one of the wheels into a deep rut. \"Ha!\r\nhi! be careful, my man! be careful! What a bloody road this is, to be\r\nsure!\" the lord would cry out. On a little farther, and down would go\r\nthe other wheel into a deep rut. \"Ho! ha! hi! here we go over, to be\r\nsure! Be careful, my good man; be careful! Why, Colonel, I never saw\r\nsuch bloody roads in all my life. Do they ever work them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sometimes,\" the Colonel replied, as sober as a judge, though\r\nalmost dying from suppressed laughter. Indeed such a scene would have\r\nmade a dog laugh, and surely the blind old mule would have laughed\r\noutright could he have laughed at all. The Colonel, lying upon the straw\r\non the bottom of the cart, felt no fear at all when it sidled over; but\r\nLord Brewerton, on the chair, was indeed in danger of being spilled out\r\nevery time the cart made a sudden lurch. A little farther and one of the\r\nwheels strikes and passes over a good sized stone. \"Ha! hi! he! here we\r\ngo sure this time! Be careful, my dear man, be careful! And did you ever\r\nsee such a bloody road in all your life, Colonel? Are you sure, my dear\r\nman, that you are in the road?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, massa, I'se sure. I knows'em well. I'se trabelled dis road many\r\ntimes, massa,\" replied old Jarrett; and then, turning to his mule, said,\r\n\"Git along, Jack, git along! Lift yer feet high, Jack; lift yer-feet\r\nhigh! Git up, git along, Jack!\" And thus for full two miles they trudged\r\nalong, the lord in danger every five minutes of being thrown over the\r\nwheels, and calling everything \"bloody! bloody! bloody!\" while the\r\nColonel could not help occasional outbursts of laughter, though all the\r\nwhile trying to suppress it, out of respect for the feelings of Lord\r\nJohn.\r\n\r\nAt length Lord Brewerton's patience gave way entirely, when he seized\r\nthe old chair and hurled it from the cart, and then laid down in the\r\nstraw beside the Colonel. The other six miles, to Wilson's mill, were\r\nmade without any incident worthy of record.\r\n\r\nOld Aunt Rachel's negro hut was probably the first in Virginia that ever\r\ngave shelter for a whole day to a live lord; and it is safe to say that\r\nno live lord ever rode behind a blinder mule, in a more rickety cart,\r\nor with a safer driver, than Lord Brewerton did that night. To show his\r\nappreciation of treats so rare, we may add, that before leaving Aunt\r\nRachel he handed her two twenty-dollar gold pieces, and before bidding\r\nUncle Jarrett goodbye, he made him happy for life by handing him five\r\ntwenty-dollar gold pieces.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, massa, God bless you!\" was all the answer either of them\r\ncould make to such unexpected generosity; but this, to one whose nature\r\nwas nobler than his blood, was quite sufficient.\r\n\r\nAt Wilson's they procured horses, and rode about eight miles to a grove.\r\nThere they dismounted, as it was dangerous to travel the public road\r\nfarther, and sending the horses back with the guide, the two trudged\r\nalong on foot, over fields and through by-paths for about five miles,\r\nuntil they reached Mr. Joseph Berry's. Here they stayed all day, and\r\nat night rode on horseback, about seventeen miles, to Mr. Frederick\r\nHutchings. At this farm-house they again changed horses, and then rode\r\nsix miles farther to Nathan Allen's. Again they changed horses, and then\r\nrode about fifteen miles to Budd's mill. It was now near morning, and\r\nfor the balance of the day they remained concealed in Mr. Budd's house.\r\nWhen night came, they managed, as the Colonel had before, to pass the\r\nsentinel at the mill, and then walked four miles to Mr. Brisco's. Here\r\nthey obtained horses and rode eleven miles to Dr. Charles Worthington's.\r\nHere one of the outside Union sentinels was stationed. The guide knew\r\nhim personally, and slipped one hundred dollars in gold into his hands.\r\nThe sentinel became suddenly stone-blind, and our travellers passed by\r\nwithout difficulty. They were now within the Confederate lines, and no\r\nlonger in fear of arrest.. After a short walk they procured horses, and\r\nthen a ride of nineteen miles brought them to Randolph's, at China Grove\r\nstation. This route, it will be seen, varied some little from that\r\ntaken by Messrs. Lamb, and Waddell. A change of Union troops and\r\nsentinel-stations made a change of route sometimes necessary. The\r\nconductors of the line, Colonels Abercrombie and Killgore, had no less\r\nthan five different points at which they crossed the Potomac, and at\r\neach point, look-outs and guides were all the while in waiting and all\r\nthe while in the pay of the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nAt Randolph's, Colonel Abercrombie laid aside his disguise and again\r\nassumed his uniform; Lord Brewerton brushed up as best he could; both\r\ntook seats in the next passing train; and in a few hours thereafter were\r\nat the Ballard House, in Richmond. No sooner was Lord Brewerton in his\r\nbed-chamber than he kneeled (inviting the Colonel to do the same) and\r\noffered up a most earnest prayer of thanks to God for his deliverance\r\nfrom dangers, and for the safety which had attended him thus far in his\r\ntravels.\r\n\r\nOf course, the arrival of Lord Brewerton was at once made known to Mr.\r\nDavis, and on the following day the President not only called upon him,\r\nbut insisted that he should make the Executive Mansion his home while he\r\nremained in Richmond, to which Lord Brewerton finally consented, and at\r\nonce accompanied Mr. Davis to his home. For a day or two they were in\r\nclose consultation. After that, members of the cabinet, army officers,\r\nand other prominent gentlemen commenced to call upon Lord Brewerton. It\r\nwas soon after arranged that a reception ball should be given him at\r\nthe Executive Mansion. The programme included the illumination of the\r\ngrounds with brilliant fire-works, the attendance of military bands,\r\nwith special invitations to all the leading civil and military officers\r\nof the Confederacy. The reception and ball came off, and was even more\r\nbrilliant than had been anticipated. Among those present, were Generals\r\nLee, Breckenridge, and Beauregard. The ladies, it had been arranged,\r\nshould all dress in calico, from the President's wife down. This was\r\nobserved to the letter, and the lord was given to understand that it was\r\ndone as a compliment to the cotton manufacturing interests of England,\r\nthough the fact was that but few Southern ladies had any of their silks\r\nand satins left to wear. Although the South, even in the very highest\r\ncircles of society, was beginning to feel the pinch-ings of poverty\r\nin dress, food, and in almost everything else, yet this was carefully\r\nconcealed from the eyes and ears of Lord Brewerton during the whole time\r\nof his stay in the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks after the grand ball, Lord Brewerton, accompanied by\r\na few friends, started on a tour of inspection through the Confederate\r\nStates, especially to places where cotton was stored in large\r\nquantities. They visited Wilmington and Newbern, N. C., Charleston,\r\nSavannah, Mobile, and many other points. The entire trip occupied about\r\ntwo months. On his return to Richmond, Lord Brewerton expressed to\r\nPresident Davis and others his entire satisfaction with what he had seen\r\nand otherwise learned, adding that he had not the shadow of a doubt as\r\nto the final success of the Confederate arms. He assured Mr. Davis that\r\nwhatever money, arms, and provisions the Confederacy might need would\r\nbe promptly furnished by himself and his associates, in exchange for\r\ncotton; and that the cause of the South would continue to receive, as\r\nit had all along received, the sympathy and moral support of all the\r\n_upper_ classes of England. He also assured him that if the ministry of\r\nEngland could have the least possible excuse for interfering between the\r\nNorth and the South, they would be more than glad to espouse the cause\r\nof the South, as England's material interests all lay in this direction,\r\nand the moral sentiment of the nation could not stand for one moment in\r\nthe way of its moneyed interests.\r\n\r\nLord Brewerton remained in Richmond after his return about one week, in\r\nconsultation with President Davis and his cabinet; Colonel Abercrombie\r\nwas then telegraphed for; all the needed arrangements were made; the two\r\nleft Richmond, and in less than a week were at the English embassy at\r\nWashington. Their return was by the same route as that on which they had\r\ngone; walking and riding about the same, except that they missed this\r\ntime a ride behind old Jarrett's blind mule; nor did they have the\r\nluxury of spending a whole day at Aunt Rachel's negro hut. Lord\r\nBrewerton told Lord Lyons all about the incidents of their trip (as well\r\nas all that he had seen and learned of the Confederacy), and the two had\r\nover them and their wine many a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that on the evening following the return of Lord\r\nBrewerton and Colonel Abercrombie to Washington, there was to be a grand\r\nreception at the White House. The lord invited the Colonel to accompany\r\nhim to this reception, and to be introduced as his friend. The Colonel\r\nhesitated at first, as he feared he might possibly be recognized by\r\nsome of his old Washington acquaintances, or by some of Baker's secret\r\ndetectives. He finally consented, however, and, in the disguise of a\r\n\"French exquisite,\" did attend President Lincoln's grand reception, and\r\nsaw and heard all that was to be seen and heard on such occasions.\r\nOf course, Lord Brewerton was the observed of all observers, and was\r\nrecognized by all (save those who knew to the contrary) as a staunch\r\nfriend to the Union. A few days after, Lord Brewerton and the Colonel\r\nwent to Philadelphia, where they met a party of gentlemen at Dr. Charles\r\nHowell's, and where future business arrangements were talked over and\r\nagreed upon. From here the lord went to New York, while the Colonel\r\nreturned to Washington and from thence to Richmond.\r\n\r\nThus we finish the record of the visit of one English peer to the\r\nSouthern Confederacy; but this, by no means, constitutes the whole\r\nof such visits during the war. In January, 1863, Lord Talbot was at\r\nCharleston, having reached there by the way of Nassau. He had a son who\r\nwas a colonel in the Confederate army, and who continued in the\r\nservice until the close of the war. In November, 1863, Lords Harvey and\r\nKartwright were at Richmond; they, too, having reached the Confederate\r\nStates by the way of Nassau. Major Hodges, one of General Beauregard's\r\nstaff, was the son of an English lord, and did faithful service until\r\nthe war closed. Adjutant-General Cooper said that upon the army rolls\r\nwere the names of scores who were either the sons of, or nearly related\r\nto, English peers. Lord Cavendish, who was in very bad health, remained\r\nat Nassau during most of the time that the war continued, rendering such\r\naid to the Confederacy as lay in his power. Indeed, the immense hotel at\r\nNassau was crowded with English and Northern sympathizers with the South\r\nnearly all the while, from the beginning to the end of the war, watching\r\nchances for running the blockade, and otherwise aiding the Confederacy\r\nin whatever way they could. These gentlemen, however, while friends to\r\nthe Confederacy, were still more friends to their own pockets. With them\r\n\"cotton was king,\" and of this king they were trying to get as much in\r\ntheir pockets as possible, while English ministers and English consuls\r\nwere aiding them to the extent of their ability. This was true not only\r\nat Washington and at Nassau, but generally with British ministers and\r\nBritish consuls throughout the world, which fact, added to what we have\r\nrelated of Lord Brewerton, who, doubtless, represented many other\r\npersons besides himself, and many other interests besides his own, fully\r\njustifies, as we think, the caption given to this chapter, Nobility\r\nafter the Nuggets--Diplomacy Prompting the Actors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0089]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. IN TIGHT PLACES AND OUT. SHREWDNESS PULLING THE WIRES.\r\n\r\n|THE plan of our work admits of only one more chapter on the subject of\r\nrunning the land blockade, though, if space permitted, the entire volume\r\nmight be filled with incidents connected with this one service. This\r\nchapter, therefore, must embrace a variety of incidents.\r\n\r\nOn one of the trips, Colonel Abercrombie conducted Mr. Charles R.\r\nDangerfield from Washington to Richmond, and return. Mr. Dangerfield was\r\na large manufacturer, or the agent of manufacturers, of English arms,\r\naccoutrements, etc., and his object in visiting Richmond was to make\r\ncontracts with the Confederacy in exchange for cotton. Nothing of\r\nspecial note occurred on the way to Richmond, except that, while lying\r\nat the negro hut all day, two men came to the door, and asked \"Aunt\r\nJemima\" if Colonel Abercrombie was not there? This Mr. Dangerfield\r\nheard, and it frightened him almost out of his wits. \"Now Grant's men\r\nhave us!\" said he, and, springing up from where he lay, he was ready to\r\nsurrender at once; but the military experience of the Colonel made\r\nhim cooler and more courageous than the Englishman, and he, instead of\r\nsurrendering, was getting ready to sell his life as dearly as possible,\r\nwhen \"Aunt Jemima\" called out, \"All's right, honey, all's right! dese be\r\nyour guides, Mas'er Colonel; all's right!\" Had a ten-thousand ton weight\r\nbeen lifted from Mr. Dangerfield's breast, he could not have felt more\r\nrelieved. He was ready to dance a hornpipe then and there, and would\r\nhave done it, had he not been too old, fat, and clumsy for such a\r\nyouthful sport. From Richmond, Mr. Dangerfield visited all the larger\r\ncities, and all the cotton-storing places of the Confederacy. On his\r\nreturn to Richmond he made contracts with the government to his entire\r\nsatisfaction, and in due time returned to Washington, New York, and\r\nthence to London.\r\n\r\nAt another time the Colonel conducted another English manufacturer, Mr.\r\nFrancis Willis, across the lines and back. He, like Mr. Dangerfield,\r\nvisited the principal points in the Confederacy, and, on his return\r\nto Richmond, made contracts to furnish arms, accoutrements, saddles,\r\nclothing, etc., in exchange for cotton.\r\n\r\nThere were others who were passengers on this line, at various times;\r\nbut as their object was to see friends or attend to domestic affairs,\r\nand had no direct connection with the war, we think it unnecessary to\r\nparticularize them.\r\n\r\nOn one of the trips Colonel Abercrombie was arrested as a spy--though\r\nhis duties, and those of Colonel Killgore's, were as foreign to those\r\nof a spy as one thing can be foreign to another--and as there were\r\nincidents connected with the arrest and escape never heretofore known,\r\nwe will now relate them.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was on his way from Richmond to Washington. Had reached\r\nGreat Falls in safety, and was about half way between that point and\r\nGeorgetown, when a sentinel suddenly called, \"Halt! stand, or I'll\r\nfire.\" The Colonel, who was in the disguise of a farmer, tried to\r\nexplain to the sentinel that he was a farmer, living near Georgetown;\r\nthat he had been up to Garrett & Morse's store to see a friend, and was\r\nnow on his way back; that he was an uncompromising \"_Union_ man,\" etc.,\r\netc.; but the sentinel's only reply was that his orders were to halt and\r\ndetain any one who attempted to pass his post, and that the Colonel must\r\nstand precisely where halted until the corporal came around, and not\r\nmove a step forward or backward, or he would fire upon him. The Colonel\r\nsaw that he had a sentinel to deal with who could not be either cajoled\r\nor bribed, and that he could do nothing else than await the coming of\r\nthe corporal, and then try his arts upon him. Could he have got near\r\nthe sentinel, he would have disarmed him and escaped, but this was\r\nimpossible. When the corporal came around to relieve the guard the\r\nColonel told him the same story he had told the sentinel; but he seemed\r\nto doubt the story, and told the Colonel he must \"fall in\" and accompany\r\nthem to the Captain's headquarters, about a half-mile distant. On\r\nreaching there the Colonel repeated the same old story, to all of which\r\nthe Captain listened attentively and respectfully. The Captain had just\r\neaten his supper, and, learning from the Colonel that he had not yet had\r\nhis, asked him to take a seat at the table and help himself. While the\r\nColonel was eating, the Captain narrowly observed him, and pretty soon\r\ncried out, \"Yes! I see you are a farmer from the way you handle your\r\nknife and fork! A pretty farmer you are, to be sure!\" The Colonel\r\nwas nonplussed for a moment and could make no reply; but after awhile\r\nmanaged to say that he \"could n't see why a farmer could not handle\r\na knife and fork just as well as anybody else.\" He was caught, fairly\r\ncaught, by his \"society manners,\" and the more he talked, the better\r\nsatisfied the Captain became that he was not a farmer, and might be a\r\nspy. He was accordingly sent, that same night, to the headquarters of\r\nthe Eleventh Pennsylvania regiment, and there put in the guard-house.\r\nNext morning the colonel of this regiment sent him to General Wilson's\r\nheadquarters, near by, who, after some questions, sent him back to\r\nthe guard-house. The next night Colonel Abercrombie made an attempt to\r\nescape, and nearly succeeded. This being reported to General Wilson, he\r\nordered a heavy ball and chain to be strongly riveted to the Colonel's\r\nleg. Matters now began to look desperate; for, while the Colonel had no\r\nfear of being condemned as a spy, he was ready to do anything, rather\r\nthan be brought before a court-martial and _recognized_. He bethought\r\nhimself of some medicine he always carried with him. Of this he took a\r\ndose, and soon had a most violent diarrhoea. He now could ask, and did\r\nask, to be sent to a hospital, and next day was sent to the Lincoln\r\nHospital, near Georgetown. It changed that on the next couch to his\r\nin the hospital lay a Confederate captain, named Lawrence Norton, of\r\nGeorgia. The two soon became acquainted. The Colonel told the Captain\r\nthat if by any means the ball and chain could be taken from his leg, he\r\ncould escape from the hospital. The Captain told his wife this when she\r\nvisited him next day; the wife became immediately interested, and soon\r\nprocured and brought to her husband a watch-spring file; the Captain\r\nthat same night so filed the clasp, which held the ball and chain to the\r\nColonel's ankle, that it could be slipped off at any moment. The Colonel\r\nwatched the surgeon when he came into the hospital next day, and managed\r\nto slip a pass from the surgeon's overcoat pocket while it lay upon a\r\nstand near his bed. With this pass and two empty bottles in his hand,\r\nhe rushed by the sentinel at the door, on the plea that he was in great\r\nhaste to bring medicines which the doctor had just sent him after.\r\nOnce outside the building, he sprang over a cemetery fence, and from\r\nthenceforth allowed no grass to grow under his feet until he was safe at\r\nBen Beveridge's hotel. Here, of course, there was great rejoicing at the\r\nColonel's wonderful escape; but, fearing pursuit, it was thought best\r\nthat the Colonel should proceed at once to Baltimore, and from thence to\r\nPhiladelphia. It was deemed best, too, that he should not start from\r\nthe Washington depot, lest detectives be on the watch there for him.\r\nAccordingly, Ben ordered up his own spanking team of bays, and before\r\ndaybreak had the Colonel at the Bladensburg station, where he took the\r\nfirst train that came along for Baltimore. Fearing, however, to go into\r\nthe Baltimore depot, lest detectives might be there on the watch for\r\nhim, the Colonel got off the train at the Relay House, and gave a man\r\na twenty-dollar gold piece to drive him into Baltimore, a distance of\r\nabout thirteen miles. He went direct to the Fountain Hotel, in Light\r\nStreet, where he remained carefully concealed for several days, only\r\nseeing Mr. Thomas, Mr. Wilson, and such others as he knew to be firm\r\nfriends of the Southern cause. Then he went to Philadelphia and remained\r\nat Dr. Howell's for about two weeks.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the newspapers of Washington and of the whole country were\r\npublishing accounts about the \"wonderful escape of a rebel spy,\" and\r\nall sorts of guesses were made as to who he was, how he had managed to\r\nescape, who had helped him, where he had gone, etc., etc. Of course,\r\nthe whole of Baker's national detective force and all the police and\r\ndetective forces of New York, Philadelphia, and of every other Northern\r\ncity, were specially charged to search out, arrest, and bring to\r\nspeedy justice this \"desperate rebel spy;\" but not one of them all ever\r\nsucceeded in arresting, nor even in ascertaining who this \"rebel spy\"\r\nwas; and not until this shall appear in print will the world at large\r\never know who the arrested party was, how he managed his escape, or what\r\nbecame of him after his escape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. JOHNSON IN A QUANDARY. THE HEART MASTERING THE HEAD.\r\n\r\n|There was another incident connected with the running of the land\r\nblockade which, though hardly sufficient for an entire chapter, is too\r\nimportant and too interesting to allow to pass without notice: for not\r\nuntil this is published will it ever be known outside of some half-dozen\r\npersons. The incident was as follows:\r\n\r\nOn one of his blockade-running visits to Washington, Colonel Abercrombie\r\nlearned that Senator Andrew Johnson, as it then was (though afterwards\r\nVice-President, and still afterwards President of the United States),\r\nhad rooms at Beveridge's Hotel, the very place that he was making his\r\nheadquarters when in Washington. Knowing the Senator to be a fierce,\r\nuncompromising Union man, the news of his close proximity at first\r\nalarmed the Colonel; but, upon reflection, he remembered that Mrs.\r\nJohnson and his mother had long been on the most intimate terms,--that\r\nthe Senator knew him personally, and had always treated him with the\r\nutmost kindness,--that he was a man of generous heart, and even though\r\nhe should learn of his being there, the danger of his interfering with\r\nhim was next to nothing. He therefore decided to stand his ground and\r\ntake the chances.\r\n\r\nAs proximity to danger is always exciting, and, after a time, becomes\r\nattractive, so in this case, what at first seemed alarming, after a time\r\nbecame so attractive that the Colonel had a longing desire to see and\r\nconverse with his old friend, Andrew Johnson. He communicated this\r\ndesire to his friend and co-associate in the blockade-running business,\r\nBen Beveridge, and asked him what he thought of it. Ben, at first,\r\nthought it would not do at all; but, like the Colonel, after thinking\r\nover the matter some time, concluded that it would be a capital joke,\r\nand advised the Colonel to try it.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel was disguised--so disguised, indeed, that even his own\r\nsister would not have known him, had she met him in the street--and the\r\narrangement was, that Ben should await in the entry, near the Senator's\r\nchamber-door, while the Colonel went in to talk with him; and that, if\r\nthe Senator did not receive him kindly, or if he showed any disposition\r\nto arrest him, the Colonel should at once quit the room, and Ben would\r\nhelp him to escape.\r\n\r\nEverything thus understood, the Colonel went to the Senator's door\r\nand knocked gently. A deep, stentorian voice replied, \"Come in but the\r\nColonel pretended not to hear this, and knocked again, as he wanted the\r\nSenator to come to and open the door, that he might at once step within\r\nthe room, whether the Senator invited him to do so or not. The second\r\nknock brought the Senator to the door, which he opened far enough to\r\nface his visitor, when he said:\r\n\r\n\"How do you do, sir?\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel replied, and, while replying, stepped within the room, when\r\nthe Senator shut the door, and invited his visitor to take a seat. The\r\nColonel did not sit down, but, taking hold of the back of the chair\r\noffered him, he said to Mr. Johnson:\r\n\r\n\"You seem not to know me, Mr. Senator. When did you leave Greenville?\r\nand where is Mrs. Johnson and Bob?\"\r\n\r\nThis confused the Senator more than ever, as the visitor seemed to be\r\nfamiliar with his wife and son, as well as with himself, and yet he\r\ncould not recollect to have ever seen him before.\r\n\r\n\"Well, no,\" replied the Senator, \"I really cannot place you, or call\r\nyour name. By jingo! who are you, any way?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you don't want to know me,\" replied the Colonel, \"and I had\r\nbetter be going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir; oh, no,\" replied Mr. Johnson; \"sit down! sit down! When\r\ndid you come from Greenville? But really, sir, I cannot recall your\r\nname--I cannot.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel observed the Senator's confusion, and so enjoyed the joke\r\nthat it was some time before he would let himself be known. Then,\r\nsuddenly tearing the false whiskers from his face and putting on a\r\nnatural expression, he stood revealed before the Senator.\r\n\r\n\"My God! is this you, Ralph?\" was all that Mr. Johnson could say for\r\nsome moments; and then added, \"Why, Ralph, ain't you in the rebel\r\nservice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what if I am?\" replied the Colonel; \"you don't propose to arrest\r\nme, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; but, by jingo! what under heavens brought you here?\" said the\r\nSenator; and, going to the door, locked it before the Colonel had time\r\nto reply. \"Sit down! sit down!\" he added, \"and tell me all about it.\r\nWhat under heavens could have brought you here, or induced you to call\r\nupon me?\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel then took a seat and explained to Mr. Johnson why he was\r\nthere, the nature of his business, and that he had only called upon him\r\nas a good joke, and to renew an old acquaintance; to all of which\r\nthe Senator listened attentively, though trembling meanwhile from\r\nexcitement. When the Colonel had finished, Mr. Johnson sprang from his\r\nchair, walked hurriedly across the room two or three times, went to\r\nthe front windows and pulled down the shades, and then, turning to the\r\nColonel, said:\r\n\r\n\"Does anybody know that you are here with me?\" Just then Mr. Johnson\r\nheard a tittering in the entryway, and, turning to the Colonel, asked\r\nhim if he had any companions waiting outside. The Colonel replied, that\r\nhe thought it might be Ben, as he alone knew of his visit. Immediately\r\nMr. Johnson stepped to the door, and, seeing Ben, asked him to step in.\r\nBen did so, and now the Senator became more in a quandary than ever. He\r\nscolded both Ben and the Colonel pretty severely, and told them they\r\ndid not appreciate the awkward position in which they were placing him;\r\nthat, if the Colonel's visit to him were known, it would, under the\r\ncircumstances, compromise him in a most serious manner. Ben tried to\r\nsoothe the Senator by telling him that the Colonel's call upon him was\r\nonly intended as a joke; that it could never be known outside of their\r\nthree selves; and that it should never be repeated, if annoying to him.\r\nThe Senator replied, that while he was glad, personally, to see Ralph,\r\nyet the fact that he was known to be an officer in the rebel army, and\r\nin his business of blockade-running might by some be regarded as a spy,\r\nmade it doubly awkward for him, and, if it were known to the Senate,\r\nmight cost him his seat, as well as his reputation as a consistent\r\nUnion man; that nearly every one would say that he ought to have had the\r\nColonel arrested and detained, at least as a prisoner-of-war, if not as\r\na spy; and that, in holding communication with him without attempting\r\nhis arrest, he made himself a party to his crime, whether as a rebel to\r\nthe government or as a spy. The more the Senator talked about it, the\r\ngraver he became over it, until the Colonel and Ben saw that what\r\nhad been intended as a comedy might prove a serious tragedy with all\r\nconcerned, and that the sooner they got out of the way the better.\r\nBefore leaving, the Senator exacted from each a solemn promise that they\r\nwould not repeat the joke under any possible circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere is no kind of doubt that Senator Johnson felt greatly troubled at\r\nreceiving such a visit from an officer in the Confederate service, and\r\nin learning that his landlady's son, Ben, was just as much of a rebel at\r\nheart as the Colonel himself. He knew, too, that his official duty as\r\na United States Senator was to have both of these men arrested, tried,\r\nand, if possible, convicted, while his heart prompted to a course\r\ndirectly the contrary. He had long known, and had high regard for, the\r\nmothers of both; the men he had known from childhood upward, and always\r\nliked them, as boys, as young men, as men in active life, and he would\r\nas soon have thought of having his own son, \"Bob,\" arrested as either\r\nof these, and yet his duty plainly pointed in that direction. It was a\r\nconflict between his head and his heart, in which his heart gained the\r\nmastery.\r\n\r\nThat the Senator did not hold any ill-will against the Colonel or\r\nagainst Ben for this wild prank of theirs against his Senatorial and\r\nofficial dignity is proven from the fact that he still continued to\r\nboard with Ben's mother at the \"Washington House,\" and within two years\r\nafter he became President he appointed the Colonel as one of three\r\ncommissioners to reopen and establish mail-routes throughout the late\r\nConfederate States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0101]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. PRISONERS, HOW USED AND HOW ABUSED. CRAFT AND CRUELTY\r\nPROMPTING THE ACTORS.\r\n\r\n|IN General L. C. Baker's \"History of the United States Secret Service,\"\r\nfour chapters are devoted to the subject of bounty-jumpers. In these\r\nchapters the startling facts are disclosed that on investigation, it\r\nwas found that only one in four of the enlisted men reached the front\r\nthat, in some instances, the entire quota of a township was filled with\r\nthe names of bounty-jumpers, not one of whom ever really enlisted or\r\nwent to the front; that desertions from the army became so common\r\nthat to \"even attempt to show, by actual figures, the number would be\r\nimpossible;\" that \"to aid the soldier to desert was deemed to be as much\r\nthe legitimate business and calling of the professional bounty broker\r\nas to enlist him;\" that in one investigation it was shown, \"out of 5,284\r\nenlisted, only 2,083 actually entered the service;\" that out of\r\nthis number--less than one-half who really enlisted--not more than\r\nthree-fourths ever reached the front, and of these probably one-fourth\r\ndeserted and returned to the States, to reënlist and receive bounty\r\nagain; that of one hundred and \"eighty-three who enlisted in one day at\r\nHoboken and were credited to the quota of Jersey City, every one was\r\na bounty-jumper;\" that case after case came to light where a single\r\nbounty-jumper had enlisted _three_ times, and received three separate\r\nbounties, in _one_ day, and that even gipsy-like gangs were organized,\r\nwho travelled from city to city, enlisting such of their number as they\r\ncould, assisting such as enlisted to escape, and then on to the next\r\ncity or recruiting station to repeat the same thing. Of one such gang\r\nit is related that \"in a trip of thirty-two days their total profits\r\namounted to $32,000.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also a matter of record that while skirmishes and battles were\r\nin progress, Union soldiers in the front ranks, and especially if sent\r\nforward as skirmishers, would sometimes throw down their muskets and run\r\nover to the enemy; and it not unfrequently happened that sentinels on\r\nthe outposts were missing and never heard of more, or, if heard of,\r\nit would be found they had gone within the Confederate lines and\r\nsurrendered.\r\n\r\nThese matters have all been told, and well told, by other historians,\r\nbut not until these \"Secrets of the Rebellion\" have been published will\r\nit be generally known what became of those who thus threw down their\r\narms, and of those who thus abandoned their posts, to go over to the\r\nenemy, and that to encourage bounty-jumping in the North, and thereby\r\npromote desertions from the Union army, became, after August, 1863, a\r\npart of the masterly diplomacy or tactics adopted by the Confederate\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nOf the bounty-jumpers who first tried the game of going over to the\r\nenemy, under the belief that they would soon be exchanged or paroled,\r\nand thus have opportunities for procuring additional bounties, quite\r\na number were shot as spies. The \"dead-board,\" as it was called, of\r\nGeneral Lee's army, had a summary way of dealing with all cases which\r\nthey deemed of a questionable character. A statement from the person\r\nmaking the arrest; where found, and under what circumstances; a few\r\nquestions to the accused; a consultation of ten minutes among the seven\r\nofficers who composed the board; sentence; and on the day following, and\r\nsometimes on the same day, the accused would be seen sitting on an empty\r\ncoffin, on his way to execution.\r\n\r\nBut in August, 1863, a new thought crossed the brain of the\r\nConfederate authorities. They then concluded that, instead of shooting\r\nbounty-jumpers as spies, they could make them serviceable to the\r\nConfederate cause by using them as stool-pigeons, and like as\r\nstool-pigeons are used to draw whole flocks into the net, so these could\r\nbe used to corrupt, and bring thousands into the Confederate lines.\r\nIn pursuance of this new idea, five large tobacco warehouses, on Carey\r\nStreet, each three stories high, directly opposite \"Castle Thunder,\" in\r\nRichmond, were converted into a prison, and called \"Castle Lightning.\"\r\nIn this prison, bounty-jumpers alone were put, and the rations furnished\r\nthem were doubly as good as the rations furnished the prisoners in other\r\nprisons. Whenever an exchange of prisoners was possible, those in Castle\r\nLightning were always given the preference, and, when about to leave,\r\nthey were told that they should take from the Yankees as many bounties\r\nas they possibly could; that, if again sent to the front, they should\r\ndesert, and bring as many others along with them as possible; that they\r\nwould always be well treated, and given the best rations the Confederacy\r\ncould afford; that they would be exchanged, or otherwise sent back to\r\ntheir homes, at the first opportunity; and that to secure safety and\r\ngood treatment, when coming into the Confederate lines, they should cry\r\nout, \"Bounty-jumper! Bounty-jumper!\" This was told them not only when\r\nabout to leave, but again, and again, and again during their stay, and\r\nthe superior treatment they received while prisoners, assured them that\r\nthe promises made would all be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWithin a few weeks after the return of the first batch of these\r\nbounty-jumpers to the North, the effect of the new policy began to show\r\nitself, and it steadily increased from that time onward. Hardly a day,\r\nand sometimes several times in a day, squads of Union prisoners arrived\r\nin Richmond, and were marched to Castle Lightning, who had voluntarily\r\ncome within the lines, and claimed to be bounty-jumpers. Nor was there\r\nscarcely a day in which squads of these same men might not be seen\r\nleaving the prison, on their way to be exchanged, or otherwise sent back\r\nto the Union army, or direct to their homes. Like leaven, its tendency\r\nwas to leaven the whole lump, as the authorities of the Confederacy\r\nbelieved would be the case when they adopted the policy. One such man\r\nin a company would, in time, taint the whole company; ten such men in\r\na regiment would, in time, taint the whole regiment. When a battle is\r\nprogressing, a single regiment, yea, a single company, going over to the\r\nenemy will sometimes so change the tide of battle that what seemed an\r\nassured victory, will prove a most disastrous defeat.\r\n\r\nOf course it is not known, never can be known, how many millions of\r\ndollars, nor how many thousands of lives the adoption of this policy\r\nby the South cost the North; nor can the South ever know the amount of\r\nadvantage which they derived from adopting the policy; but that it was\r\na new mode of warfare, and showed great shrewdness on the part of those\r\nwho conceived and carried out the project, all will agree in admitting.\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown how the Confederate authorities used Union prisoners\r\nto benefit their own cause, we will next proceed to state some\r\nadditional facts as to the abuse received by other Union prisoners.\r\nThe facts which we now purpose to state are not from hearsay, not from\r\none-sided newspapers, nor from partisan historians, but directly from the\r\nlips of one who had occasion to visit Confederate prisoners frequently\r\nduring the war, whose whole soul was in, and with, the Confederate\r\ncause, and who could not be, and would not be, by any who knew him,\r\naccused of sympathy with the \"Yankees,\" as he usually styles Union\r\nsoldiers when speaking of them. We have not space to write of all, and\r\nwill limit our remarks to only four of the many places throughout the\r\nConfederate States at which Union prisoners were confined.\r\n\r\n_First_.--\"Libby Prison.\" This was located in Richmond, and had been\r\na tobacco warehouse previous to its use as a prison. It was an immense\r\nbrick building, three stories high, rough floors, no plastering, a great\r\nnumber of windows, no fire-places, and no means for heating other than\r\nfor the office on the first floor. In this, hundreds of Union prisoners\r\nwere thrust and kept for weeks, months, years--some with scarcely enough\r\nclothing left to cover their nakedness, and with no chance for a change;\r\nmany without a blanket, even in the coldest winter weather; all without\r\nbeds, or mattress, or anything but the hard floor to lie upon. Their\r\nordinary daily ration consisted of a loaf made from one pint of\r\ncorn-meal and one pint of rice soup. Occasionally, though rarely, they\r\nwould have bread made from wheat flour and soup made from meat and\r\nbones. Once in a great while they were served with meat, but the\r\nquantity served to each man was so small that it could be taken at a\r\nmouthful. Our informant says he knows of a certainty that some _actually\r\nstarved to death_--that others _actually froze to death_--that many\r\nwere _wantonly shot_ while thoughtlessly looking out of the windows,\r\nby sentinels on the sidewalks, who had positive orders from Lieutenant\r\nTurner, the officer in command of Libby, to shoot any \"d------d Yankee\"\r\nwhose head might be seen at the window-bars; and that hundreds, yea,\r\nthousands, died from sickness brought upon them by the privations from\r\nwhich they suffered. We could give other details, but they are too\r\nhorrible to write, and would be too sickening to read.\r\n\r\n_Second_.--\"Castle Thunder.\" All that we have said of \"Libby\" will apply\r\nequally well to this prison, except that in some cases the cruelty\r\nof treatment might be _multiplied by two_, and in some instances by\r\n_three._ Here our informant saw prisoners with ball and chain to their\r\nlegs, and handcuffed together; chanced to be in the room when the brains\r\nof one of the prisoners were spattered against the wall, by a ball from\r\nthe musket in the hands of a sentinel on the pavement two stories below,\r\nand only because the prisoner had dared to look out at a window; learned\r\nof many like cases which occurred before and after that visit; nor has\r\nhe any doubt that scores were there inhumanly shot, because of orders\r\nfrom the officer in command, Captain Alexander. At least one Union\r\nprisoner, a Captain Dayton, was hung on the charge of being a spy. In\r\nthis prison, dogs that chanced to stray in were seized, killed, and\r\neaten; and rat-meat was regarded as a dainty dish.\r\n\r\n_Third_.--Salisbury, N. C., was a large enclosure within a high board\r\nfence, on the outside of which was a walk for sentinels, and within\r\nwhich was the \"dead-line,\" about thirty feet from the fence, to cross\r\nwhich meant instant death to any prisoner. The \"sinks\" for the camp were\r\nlocated on this \"dead-line,\" and at one of his visits our informant saw\r\nthe dead body of a prisoner lying in one of the \"sinks,\" who had been\r\nshot by a sentinel in the afternoon of the day before while sitting on\r\nthe pole at the \"sink.\" The sentinel, when asked why he had shot\r\nthe prisoner, replied that he thought he was trying to come over the\r\ndead-line and therefore shot him. At this same visit our informant saw\r\nsentinels, with guns on their shoulders, pacing their rounds on the\r\noutside of this fence, who were not over twelve years of age, and the\r\none who had shot the prisoner at the \"sink\" was scarcely over this age.\r\nThe whole regiment on guard at that camp, at that time, was made up of\r\nboys from twelve to sixteen years of age, and of very old men--not one\r\nof all of whom was fit for a soldier. The officer in command, a Major\r\nGee, was himself a brute, and no more fit to have the care of human\r\nbeings than a hyena would be to be placed in charge of a sheepfold.\r\nHere, as at Libby and Castle Thunder, the usual ration was a loaf made\r\nfrom one pint of corn-meal, each day, and occasionally a small bit\r\nof meat. For shelter most of them had to burrow for themselves, like\r\nrabbits, in holes under ground; and so poorly were they off for clothing\r\nand shoes, that our informant saw scores of men standing about the doors\r\nof hospitals, waiting for the clothing and shoes of those who might die\r\nwithin. Every morning carts came around to gather up the dead, to take\r\nthem without the camp and throw in trenches.\r\n\r\n_Fourth_.--Andersonville, Georgia. This was an enclosure of about\r\ntwenty-five acres, surrounded by a high stockade, and by earthworks\r\nmounted with cannon. One end of the enclosure was a swamp, through which\r\ncrept a sluggish, muddy stream, and this was the only water to which\r\nthe prisoners had access. To add to the filthiness and consequent\r\nunhealthfulness of this water, a Confederate camp was located upon it,\r\nabove the point where the stream entered the stockade. The few buildings\r\nwithin the enclosure were scarcely enough for hospital purposes, and\r\nhere, as at Salisbury, the prisoners had to burrow in the earth for\r\nshelter. Even in the coldest of weather thousands had no blankets, nor\r\nscarcely clothing enough to cover their nakedness. Their ordinary ration\r\nhere, as at the other places named, was a loaf made from one pint of\r\ncorn-meal each day, and when, as occasionally they did, receive anything\r\nbeyond this, it was regarded as a rare treat. The shooting of men on the\r\n\"dead-line\" was almost of daily occurrence.\r\n\r\nIndeed, many of the prisoners became so crazed from suffering that they\r\nsought death in this way. General Winder was commander of the camp, and\r\nunder him was the Captain Wirz who was tried, convicted, and hung at\r\nWashington near the close of the war. Thousands at the South, as well\r\nas at the North, believed then, and believe still, that General Winder,\r\ninstead of his subordinate officer, should have stood beneath the\r\nhangman's noose. Undoubtedly he could have corrected these terrible\r\nwrongs had he tried. That he did not try is proof positive that he did\r\nnot care. The world at large always gives to commanders the chief credit\r\nof all done by their subordinates, and, on the same principle, holds\r\nthem responsible for all that their subordinates fail to do or do\r\nwrongfully. Had General Winder desired his prisoners to have had better\r\ntreatment, neither Captain Wirz, nor any other of his subordinates,\r\nwould have treated them as they did. How much they suffered none will\r\never know. The horrible things related in the foregoing pages, and the\r\nthousands of other terrible things related by others who have written\r\nthe history of the Rebellion, are but as drops to the ocean, as sands to\r\nthe sea-shore, to all that occurred during the war. Dark deeds seek to\r\nhide themselves always, and while the \"secrets\" of this volume, and a\r\nfew-others, have oozed out since the war, others doubtless quite as\r\nbad have never yet, and probably never will, see the light of day. And\r\npossibly it is best so. There are some deeds that so harrow up one's\r\nfeelings that, if related, they would, as said by Hamlet's ghost:\r\n\r\n                    \"Freeze the young blood;\r\n\r\n               Make the two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres;\r\n\r\n               The knotted and combined locks to part,\r\n\r\n               And each particular hair to stand on end\r\n\r\n               Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.\"\r\n\r\nOr, after hearing them, make us to cry out with Hamlet (slightly\r\nvaried)\r\n\r\n               \"O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?\r\n\r\n               And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold my heart;\r\n\r\n               And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\r\n\r\n               But bear me stiffly up!--Remember them?\r\n\r\n               Yea, from the table of my memory\r\n\r\n'          I'll wipe away all trivial records,\r\n\r\n               All saws of books, all forms, all pleasures past,\r\n\r\n               That youth and observation copied there,\r\n\r\n               And these base deeds alone, alone shall live\r\n\r\n'          Within the book and volume of my brain\r\n\r\n'          Unmixed with baser matter;\r\n\r\n               And on my tablets I will set it down\r\n\r\n               That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!\"\r\n\r\nWe could ourself add more, much more, from what our informant told us;\r\nbut our heart sickens over such recitals, and our readers, we are sure,\r\nhave had quite enough of it.\r\n\r\nThe first question, and the most natural question for any one to ask,\r\nafter reading the terrible atrocities just recited, would be, Who was or\r\nis accountable for all this suffering?\r\n\r\nThe gentleman from whose lips we gathered most of the foregoing facts\r\nhad opportunities of learning the individual sentiments of President\r\nDavis upon this subject, as upon many others, quite as well, perhaps, as\r\nany man within the lines of the Confederacy, and he assured us that\r\nMr. Davis regretted, as much as any man could regret, the sufferings of\r\nUnion prisoners, and that, whenever reports of their ill-treatment came\r\nto his ears, he at once gave them attention. That, time and again, Mr.\r\nDavis appointed gentlemen of high character to visit the prison-places\r\nwe have named, and report to him any and all abuses of which they might\r\nlearn; that, again and again, he cautioned, reprimanded, and in some\r\ncases re moved, officers charged with cruelty to Union prisoners; and\r\nthat he did whatever it was possible for him to do to mitigate their\r\nsufferings. In view of the high personal character which Mr. Davis bore\r\nbefore he became President of the Confederacy, and, of the consistent\r\nChristian character he has since borne, it is to be hoped that this is\r\na correct interpretation of his sentiments with reference to Union\r\nprisoners. It would almost make one lose faith in humanity were it\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nIf President Davis was not responsible, the next most natural question\r\nwould be, Who is? and to this answers would differ with almost every\r\none who might attempt to make reply. While the outrages were being\r\nperpetrated, the people of the North generally held Mr. Davis\r\nresponsible for all of them, on the principle heretofore stated; but\r\ntowards the close of the war, and during the ten years following the\r\nwar, public opinion greatly changed, until few, if any, held him longer\r\nresponsible; and now there are not probably ten men in the whole United\r\nStates, of such as know anything of the facts, who hold him personally\r\nresponsible for these outrages.\r\n\r\nOur informant thought the responsibility lay most, if not wholly, with\r\nthe officers in immediate command of these prisons and camps. That,\r\nwhile food was undoubtedly scarce in the Confederacy, still he believed\r\nthe prisoners did not get all that the government allowed and paid for;\r\nthat while charged only with the safe-keeping of the prisoners, the\r\nofficers in command went far beyond this, and made security a pretext\r\nfor severity; that they were malicious, vindictive, devilish, and, while\r\ndressed in a \"little brief authority,\" allowed these traits of their\r\nown characters to have full play in torturing those committed to their\r\nkeeping. If this, or half of this, be true, God have pity on their souls\r\nwhen they stand, as all must, before Christ's judgment-seat!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0113]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. GUERILLAS ON THE WAR-PATH. CUNNING AND DUPLICITY PROMPTING\r\nTHE ACTORS.--DESTRUCTION IN THE BACKGROUND.\r\n\r\n|THE remark is attributed to General Grant that he had \"less dread of\r\nthe whole of General Lee's army than of Colonel Moseby's cavalry.\" To\r\none unacquainted with the irregular, predatory mode of warfare of these\r\nbands, such a remark, from such a source, would seem impossible; but\r\nwhen it is known that cunning, deception, downright lying, and any\r\namount of cruelty needed to their ends, were principles and practices\r\nwhich they regarded as fair; that they did not hold themselves amenable\r\nto army regulations, nor to the law of nations, but were in all cases\r\na \"law unto themselves,\" then the wonder ceases, and we can understand\r\nthat even so fearless and so wise a general as Grant might have made\r\njust such a remark.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the newspapers of the whole country had considerable to\r\nsay about Moseby and his marauding band; and, since the war, all who\r\nhave written histories have had more or less to say about him; and yet\r\nnot the one-hundredth part of his depredations have ever been recorded,\r\nnor is there one in a thousand, either North or South, who know how his\r\nband was organized, how they operated, or what were the results, except\r\nin a few cases, of their operations. With our army experience of nearly\r\nthree years, and with all our reading of newspapers and histories, we\r\nadmit to have known nothing, or next to nothing, of the plan on which\r\nhis band was organized, of the principles on which they operated, and\r\nof the terrible results of those operations until quite recently. It\r\nchanced, not long since, that we met a gentleman who was an officer\r\nin the Confederate army during nearly the whole of the war, who was\r\npersonally acquainted with Colonel Moseby and many of his men, and who\r\nhad from their own lips carefully detailed accounts of many of their\r\ndaring exploits, at a time when they gloried in them and delighted to\r\ntell them to their friends; and whose personal relations with President\r\nDavis, Adjutant-General Cooper, and others gave him the opportunity\r\nof knowing what was going on _behind_ the scenes, as well as upon the\r\nstage. From him we gathered most of the following facts, and as many of\r\nthem have never been published before, we are sure they will be of\r\ngreat interest, as showing another phase of the acts going on behind\r\nthe scenes while the armies of the Union and of the Confederacy were\r\nfighting their battles on the public stage, with all the world as\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that in the beginning of the Confederate\r\ngovernment troops were called out by proclamation of the President, the\r\nsame as at the North. But that, after a time, as the war progressed and\r\nvolunteering became less and less, conscription had to be resorted to,\r\nand, finally, that every man at all able to bear arms was called into\r\nthe service.\r\n\r\nEarly in the war Colonel Moseby proposed to the Confederate War\r\nDepartment to raise a company for \"special and _independent_ service,\"\r\nmeaning guerilla service, though of course he did not use a word so\r\nobjectionable in making the application. He was then a practising lawyer\r\nin a small town in Western Virginia, and wanted to keep up his own\r\ndignity as well as that of his profession. The War Department granted\r\nhis request, and in a little while his company was full. Finding others\r\neager to join him, as the young men of his own and of adjoining counties\r\nmuch preferred to join an \"independent\" command than go into the\r\nConfederate army (and they soon found they must do one or the other),\r\nhe next proposed to the War Department to raise a regiment on the same\r\nbasis. This, too, was granted him, and in due time he had about fifteen\r\nhundred men on his muster-rolls, divided up into companies, each with\r\nits captain, lieutenants, sergeants, etc., many of whom were not known\r\nto the general public, nor scarcely beyond their immediate friends and\r\nrelatives. All his officers and all his men lived at their homes, on\r\ntheir farms, in their offices, in their stores, in their workshops,\r\npursuing their usual vocations; but each was careful to carry, concealed\r\nabout his person, a certificate showing that he belonged to Colonel\r\nMoseby's regiment of \"independent\" cavalry, so that if called upon by\r\na conscripting officer he could at once show that he was already in the\r\nservice. The regiment was called \"independent,\" and was really so, for\r\nthe reason that it was attached to no brigade, division, or corps, but\r\noperated and cooperated with other commands only as chance happened\r\nto throw them together. His orders came from the President, or the War\r\nDepartment, through Adjutant-General Cooper, who directed him whom to\r\nobey as his superior officer for the time being, and to whom to report\r\nat any time for special duty. Many, a great many, of his acts, however,\r\nwere done purely on his own volition, on his own responsibility, and\r\nwithout orders from any superior officer, nor were these acts always\r\napproved by those at the seat of government. Two or three times he was\r\nsummoned to Richmond to answer complaints lodged against him; but such\r\nwas the influence he exerted with members of the Confederate Congress,\r\nthrough members of his regiment, many of whom were the sons or near\r\nrelatives of some of the most wealthy and most influential families of\r\nVirginia, that each time he came off scot-free, and was worse after than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nHis ordinary manner of operating was as follows: His officers and\r\nmen, as before stated, lived at home, and were only known as citizens,\r\npursuing their ordinary vocations; and, for the last two years of the\r\nwar, a considerable number, probably more than half, lived _within_ the\r\nUnion lines, and called themselves \"Union\" men. From and after the\r\ntime when the Rapidan River became the line of the two armies this was\r\nespecially so; and after that time nearly all his operations lay\r\nbetween the Rapidan and the Potomac, mostly in the counties of Loudon,\r\nFauquier, Shenandoah, and Rockingham. Occasionally he would cross the\r\nPotomac into Maryland, and operate at points between Cumberland City and\r\nthe Great Falls.\r\n\r\nWhen from officers and members of his own regiment living within\r\nthe Union lines, or from others, he would learn of the contemplated\r\nmovements of certain supply-trains, of certain paymasters, of certain\r\nsmall squads on special duty, he would at once issue orders to enough of\r\nhis men to meet him at a particular house, or a particular cross-roads,\r\nat ten or twelve o'clock of a particular night, fully armed, equipped,\r\nand mounted for the service in which they were about to engage.\r\nSometimes the number ordered out would be ten, sometimes twenty,\r\nsometimes fifty, and sometimes a whole company or more, according to\r\nthe force which they expected to meet and overcome. Only when ordered to\r\njoin and cooperate with some general commanding officer, would he call\r\nout his whole available force. He had no fixed headquarters, but his\r\nofficers and men always knew exactly where to communicate with him, as\r\nhe always knew exactly where to find them; and when he issued an order\r\nit was speedily conveyed from lip to lip, and seldom failed to meet with\r\nthe expected response. He and his men were all the while on the alert,\r\nand seldom failed to take prompt advantage of any opportunity that\r\noffered. His own men not unfrequently applied for (as farmers' sons\r\nliving in the neighborhood) and obtained temporary employment as\r\nteam-drivers, blacksmiths, farriers, etc., in the Union army, and in\r\nthis way secured information in advance of every contemplated movement,\r\nwhether of the army, of supplies, or of detachments on special service.\r\nAs soon as such information was obtained, it was conveyed from lip to\r\nlip, until it reached the ears of Colonel Moseby. Then he would decide\r\nwhether a raid was practicable or not; and if it was, the needed number\r\nof men were summoned to meet him at a certain place at a set time.\r\n\r\nTo get through the line of Union sentinels without alarming the whole\r\nUnion army, he had numerous stratagems. Having men on both sides of the\r\nline, he knew the exact location of every post, just the hour at which\r\neach sentinel was placed and relieved, and the precise strength of\r\nthe squad or company, and where located, from which each sentinel was\r\ndetached. Where only a single sentinel needed to be removed, to\r\nallow him and his squad to pass in and out of the Union lines, he was\r\nstealthily pounced upon, disarmed, killed, or otherwise taken care of.\r\nIf more than one needed removing, the same operation might be practised\r\non two or more. Where a whole squad or company needed to be gobbled up,\r\nhe had enough of his men to quietly surround them, and, at the blowing\r\nof a whistle or other signal, suddenly pounce upon and take them all\r\nprisoners, usually without the firing of a gun, or with scarcely a word\r\nspoken above a whisper. Secrecy, celerity, and \"dead men tell no\r\ntales,\" were his maxims--and most fearfully did he put these maxims into\r\npractice. It would fill this entire volume to tell all the times; but\r\nthe following instances, selected from the many, some of which have and\r\nsome of which _never have been told before_, will fully corroborate all\r\nthat we have heretofore said, and show the terrible character of the\r\nwarfare carried on by this class of men _behind_ the scenes, while the\r\nUnion and Confederate armies were contending for the mastery in front of\r\nthe scenes.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer and fall of 1863, Moseby's guerillas were exceedingly\r\nactive. Almost every night they had some enterprise on hand, large or\r\nsmall, and while most of them were of such a character as to excite but\r\nlittle attention and no alarm, yet now and then one would occur of so\r\nstartling a nature, and of so villanous a character, as to arouse all\r\nwho heard of it, and make every honest man wish that the perpetrators\r\ncould be caught and hung higher than Haman. The first we purpose to\r\nrelate was of this character, and, so far as we know, this will be its\r\nfirst publication in historic form, though well known at the time by\r\neverybody in the neighborhood, and by officers in both armies.\r\n\r\nThe position of Maryland during the war was exceedingly perplexing.\r\nLying, as it does, midway between the North and the South, her soil was\r\ntraversed by both armies, and her people were constantly subjected to\r\nannoyance, if not to danger, from both Union and Confederate troops. As\r\na slaveholding State, the sympathies of her people were mostly with the\r\nSouthern cause, and yet the business relations of many of her citizens\r\nwith the people of the North, and her contiguity to Pennsylvania, had\r\nmade many of her citizens strongly in favor of maintaining the Union. A\r\nconsiderable number of her citizens had joined the Confederate army; a\r\nconsiderable number had joined the Union army; while those who stayed at\r\nhome endeavored to remain as nearly neutral as possible. To a Northern\r\nman or a Union soldier, they were all for the Union; to a Southern man\r\nor a Confederate soldier, they were all for Jefferson Davis and the\r\nConfederacy; to one who did not care a fig which side won, they were\r\nquite as indifferent as he dared be. Moseby and his midnight marauders\r\nseemed to have taken, for some cause, a special dislike to the\r\nMarylanders, and the first four instances we purpose to give occurred on\r\nthat side of the Potomac.\r\n\r\nMr. B. (our informant had forgotten the name, though he had been at the\r\nplace and was entirely familiar with the incident, having obtained\r\nit from the lips of one who was a participant)--Mr. B. was a quiet,\r\ninoffensive old man, who endeavored to live at peace with everybody,\r\nand who was probably as little of a partisan as any man in the State. He\r\nseldom, if ever, talked upon politics, rarely about the war, and, when\r\nupon either, was always careful to do it in such a way as not to offend\r\nhis listener. He kept a small country store at a point where two roads\r\ncrossed each other, and was as ready to exchange his coffee, sugar, or\r\nmolasses, his calicoes, hardware, or queensware, for country produce or\r\nfor money, with a Confederate as with a Union man, or with a Union man\r\nas with a Confederate, There was no village about his store, not even\r\nthe usual accompaniments of a blacksmith- and wheelwright-shop.\r\n\r\nMoseby had taken a dislike to this man. Why, it is not known, except it\r\nbe that he sold his goods to Union men and Union soldiers, as well as to\r\nConfederates, when opportunity offered. So far as is known, the man had\r\nnever given any personal offence to Moseby or his men, though they had\r\nseveral times visited his store, usually, if not always, in disguise;\r\nand we may here add, once for all, that when Moseby or his men were\r\nmoving about within the Union lines on spying expeditions, they were\r\nalways in disguise, and when they went to perpetrate a diabolical act,\r\nthey always had their faces blackened, or were otherwise in mask.\r\n\r\nOn a dark night, or rather about two o'clock in the morning, in August,\r\n1863, ten of Moseby's gang approached this store. One of the men was\r\nlifted up to, and crept in at, a window, and, going to the front door,\r\nunlocked and opened it, that some might enter while others remained on\r\nthe outside as sentinels. Closing and locking the door, that there might\r\nbe no escape of the inmates, they struck a light and then commenced a\r\nsearch for persons. They soon found the old man (the owner), two young\r\nmen (his clerks or assistants), and a negro boy, all of whom had been\r\nasleep in the house adjoining, or in the second story of the store. As\r\nthere were no women in the house, it is probable that he and his clerks\r\nhad kept \"bachelors' hall.\" Of course the proprietor, clerks, and negro\r\nboy were very much alarmed at seeing these men with blackened faces\r\nbefore them, and inquired what it all meant? They were quickly informed\r\nthat it meant death to them, and a burning of the building, with all its\r\ncontents: All commenced to plead for their lives, fell upon their knees,\r\nand besought their captors to spare their lives at least, whatever other\r\npunishment or destruction they might think proper to inflict; but the\r\nmore they plead, the more deaf and the more lost to every sense of\r\nhumanity their captors seemed to become. Taking some trace-chains which\r\nthey found in the store, the old man, the two young men, and the negro\r\nboy were bound, hand and foot, and then secured to a post or some other\r\nfixed thing within the store. The only reason their captors would\r\ngive for all this was that they were \"d------d Yankees,\" that they\r\nhad \"supplied Union soldiers with food and clothing,\" that they were\r\n\"traitors to the South,\" etc., etc., etc., all of which was interspersed\r\nwith most horrid oaths and curses. When all four had been securely\r\nbound, gagged, and fastened, and their captors had helped themselves\r\nto whatever they wanted of the articles in the store, they left the\r\nbuilding, and in a few moments thereafter it was in flames. Had the\r\nbound captives within not been gagged they would have almost raised the\r\ndead with their cries; but, as it was, nothing was heard save the fierce\r\ncrackling of the flames, and in a little while the building and its\r\ncontents lay in ashes, mingled and intermingled with the bones of the\r\nfour victims. Again Moseby's oft-repeated maxims had found a terrible\r\nillustration, \"Dead men tell no tales\"--\"Dead men never bite!\"\r\n\r\nThe next instance of the doings of this gang of desperadoes which we\r\npurpose to relate, occurred not long after, near Shepherdstown, Md., and\r\nwas of a much milder type of villany. We relate it here that our readers\r\nmay see, by contrast, that these murdering guerillas were as ready to\r\ndo small, mean things, as great, horrid things; and that personal\r\nmalice and personal advantage, rather than advantage to the Southern\r\nConfederacy, were sometimes the incentives to their acts.\r\n\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Phillips, though a Marylander, was from the beginning\r\nof the agitation a strong Union man, and, when volunteers were called\r\nfor from Maryland, did not hesitate a moment to offer his services\r\nin the Union cause, and became lieutenant-colonel of one of the Union\r\nMaryland regiments. He left at home, in care of his father, a very fine\r\nhorse. Colonel Moseby heard of this horse, and determined to become its\r\npossessor. With blackened faces, he, or some of his men, went to the\r\nPhillips' farm at night, stole the horse, and returned to Virginia\r\nthe same night. The fact soon after came to the ears of a chivalrous\r\nConfederate officer, who had known Lieutenant-Colonel Phillips when at\r\nthe same college with himself, and who, though not liking Phillips now,\r\ndisliked meanness still more. He informed General Breckinridge, and\r\nafterwards General Lee, of the theft. General Lee regarded such an act\r\nas a disgrace to the whole Confederate army, and at once sent a written\r\norder to Colonel Moseby to restore the horse. Colonel Moseby demurred,\r\nand tried to excuse the act as a legitimate capture from a well-known\r\nenemy; but General Lee was not to be deceived by any such sophistry, and\r\ninsisted upon the return of the horse. The horse was returned!\r\n\r\nThe next instance, which occurred near Williamsport, Md., not long\r\nafter, was of a far blacker and more diabolical character. A farmer\r\nliving near this place, and known as a \"Dunkard,\" was believed to\r\nhave considerable quantities of gold and silver laid away in pots and\r\nstocking-legs about his house. He was not only a \"neutral\" in politics\r\nand with regard to the war, but his religion made him a non-combatant\r\nas well. Confederates, of course, denounced him as a traitor to the\r\nSouthern cause, and thought he should at least contribute his money, if\r\nnot his life, to defend it. He would say nothing, do nothing, no matter\r\nwhat others might say or do. One dark night three masked men came to his\r\nhouse, murdered him, and took his money. They were not recognized, not\r\ntraced, nor did any one then find out, nor does any one now know, who\r\nreally did the deed; but it was then believed, and is still believed,\r\nthat Moseby's guerilla band were the perpetrators.\r\n\r\nThat same fall another instance occurred, in which Moseby's guerillas\r\nwere certainly the actors, and which was of a much more warlike\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nTo cut off, gobble up, capture, or destroy paymasters and their escorts,\r\nquartermaster trains; and commissary trains, Colonel Moseby regarded as\r\nhis special and particular province, and every one of his men was on\r\nthe special look-out for chances of this kind. On the occasion now under\r\nconsideration, Brevet Major Paymaster Tilletson was on his way from\r\nWilliamsport to Shepherdstown, Md., accompanied by a captain, three\r\nlieutenants, and six privates--the latter and one lieutenant as an\r\nescort, the other officers returning to their respective commands from\r\nsick-leaves. Suddenly, without a moment's warning, Moseby, with a number\r\nof his gang, sprang out upon them, and, holding a cocked pistol at the\r\nhead of each, demanded their surrender. Of course, they could do nothing\r\nbut submit. Each officer was securely bound, while the privates were\r\neither killed or made their escape. In due time the whole party arrived\r\nwithin the Confederate lines, when the Union officers would probably\r\nhave been made to illustrate Moseby's maxim, that \"dead men tell no\r\ntales,\" had not an officer who had his authority direct from the War\r\nDepartment met him and ordered him to send the prisoners to Richmond.\r\nMoseby and his men helped themselves to so much of the greenbacks as\r\nthey could conveniently carry, while tens of thousands of dollars\r\nwere found next day scattered along the road between Williamsport and\r\nShepherdstown.\r\n\r\nNot long after the capture just related, Moseby and his men gobbled up\r\nanother squad of officers, consisting of one major, two captains, and\r\nthree lieutenants, who had been absent on sick-leaves and were then\r\nreturning to their respective commands. After they had surrendered as\r\nprisoners of war, their money, watches, and everything they had of any\r\nvalue was taken from them. When fairly within the Confederate lines they\r\nwere taken into a dense pine-grove, some distance off the road, and then\r\ntold they were all to be hung so soon as the needed preparations could\r\nbe made. Had a thunderbolt fallen at their feet from a clear sky, these\r\nsix Union officers could not have been more surprised. All protested\r\nagainst such unmilitary, unusual, inhuman treatment--some begged for\r\nlife, some wept; but the only reply they could get from Moseby was,\r\n\"Prepare for death!\" Providentially, as it would seem, one young man of\r\nMoseby's band had a \"heart of flesh,\" and determined, if possible, to\r\nsave the lives of these officers. He knew that an officer who had the\r\nauthority to command Moseby (the same referred to in the preceding\r\nincident) was at a farm-house only a few miles from the pine-grove in\r\nwhich they had stopped for temporary encampment, and where these Union\r\nofficers were to be executed. Slipping away from his comrades, he\r\nhastened to the farm-house to tell this officer of what Moseby proposed\r\nto do. So soon as the officer was told, he determined to stop it, if\r\nthey could only reach there before the men were executed. The officer\r\nand private mounted fresh horses, borrowed from the farmer, and rode\r\nwith breakneck speed until they reached the grove. It was quite dark,\r\nbut the camp-fires of Moseby and his men lighted them to the spot.\r\nSpringing from his horse at the edge of the grove, the officer left the\r\ntwo horses in care of the young man and hastened to where he saw the\r\ncamp-fire burning. Stopping for a moment to survey the scene before\r\nmaking his presence known, he observed the six Union officers seated on\r\na log on the opposite side of the fire from where he stood, each with\r\nhead dropped upon his breast, each with eyes glaring wildly into vacancy\r\nor suffused with tears, each with lips pale with fear or moving in\r\nsilent prayer, and each the very picture of despair in feature and\r\nattitude. Moseby was walking to and fro in front of them, uttering oaths\r\nand imprecations against them; guards stood about them or walked their\r\nrounds silently; while only a little way off, in plain sight, others\r\nwere busy throwing over or affixing ropes to limbs preparatory for\r\nexecution. It was a scene which only the pencil of a Raphael might have\r\nsketched or a Gorreggio have painted.\r\n\r\nThe officer, having fully surveyed and comprehended the whole scene,\r\nsuddenly sprang from the darkness into the light of the camp-fire, and\r\nin a sharp tone demanded of Colonel Moseby what all this meant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0127]\r\n\r\n\"You see what it means,\" Moseby replied, pointing to the men who were\r\naffixing the ropes to the trees.\r\n\r\n\"Who are these prisoners, and what have they done that you propose to\r\nhang them?\" asked the officer.\r\n\r\n\"They are d--d Yankee officers whom I captured this afternoon, and\r\n_purpose_ to hang them to-night. Dead men never bite,\" answered Moseby.\r\n\r\n\"I purpose,\" said the officer, \"that you do no such thing; that these\r\nofficers be sent under guard to Richmond, and that you yourself report\r\nthere at once under arrest.\" Of course a good deal more was said, and\r\na great many oaths uttered on both sides, but the above is about the\r\nsubstance. The Union officers heard and saw all that was said and done,\r\nbut were so dumbfounded that they could not say a word or utter a\r\ncry even to each other. When they did finally comprehend it all, they\r\nregarded their deliverer as one sent from heaven, and were ready to fall\r\ndown and worship him. The transition from death to life was so sudden,\r\nso unexpected, that it was some time before they could fully realize\r\nwhether they were in the body or out of the body, whether their natural\r\nsenses were still of the earth, earthy, or whether they had been\r\nsuddenly translated to another sphere, where angels only sing \"peace on\r\nearth and good will towards men!\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the commanding officer's orders, the six Union officers\r\nwere next day forwarded, as prisoners of war, to Richmond; while Moseby\r\nhimself soon after reported at the Adjutant General's office under\r\narrest, to await such action as the authorities might think proper in\r\nhis case. And thus, and thus, were the lives of six more men saved from\r\nthe infernal clutch and ravenous maw of this hyena in human form.\r\n\r\nNot many days after, the same officer who had released from Moseby's\r\nclutch the six Union officers above spoken of, chanced to be riding\r\nalong a public highway when he observed, at considerable distance off,\r\nin a deep gully, a man entirely naked, dodging from place to place, as\r\nif in fear or distress. The sight was so strange that the officer turned\r\nhis horse's head and quickly rode to the place where he had first seen\r\nthe man. Here he found not the one only, but three, all entirely naked,\r\nand all huddled together, as if to protect themselves from each other's\r\nsight. The officer demanded what it all meant. It was some moments\r\nbefore the men could answer at all, but when they did, they told the\r\nConfederate officer that they were three Union officers who had been\r\ngobbled up the day before by Moseby's guerillas, stripped of everything\r\nthey had on earth, even to their shirts, and then left in that woods or\r\nravine to do as best they might, with the warning, however, that if they\r\nmade the least alarm they would be again caught and either hung or shot;\r\nthat they had feared to approach any house in their nude state, lest\r\nthey might be shot at as ghosts or wild men; that they had not had a\r\nmorsel of food for a long time, and that even death was preferable\r\nto longer enduring such suspense and torture. The officer had seen\r\ninhumanity in almost every possible shape, but this, he said, was a\r\nrefinement of cruelty which shocked him more than anything he had ever\r\nseen before. He went to a house, not far off, and obtained shirts for\r\ntwo, and a woman's chemise for one, with such other clothing as they\r\nchanced to have. Thus, partially dressed, he then took them to the\r\nhouse, where they remained while the officer went to other houses of the\r\nneighborhood to get enough additional clothing to cover their nakedness.\r\nHe then had them accompany him to the nearest military command, where he\r\nturned them over as regular prisoners of war. And thus were three more\r\nclutched from the grasp of these bloodthirsty hyenas. Clutched from\r\ndeath, too, for had they not been seen and rescued by this officer, they\r\nwould, in all human probability, have been sought for by the guerillas\r\nnext day, and either shot or hung.\r\n\r\nThere was no month, and probably but few weeks or days, during the\r\nentire war that Moseby's guerillas were not planning or executing some\r\nvillanous enterprise against the Union army or Union men; but we have\r\nroom only for a few more, and these we will select from his operations\r\nin the Shenandoah Valley and vicinity during the summer and fall of\r\n1864.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1864, General Sheridan was assigned to the command of the\r\nMiddle Military Division, comprising the Middle Department and the\r\nDepartments of Washington, the Susquehanna, and West Virginia. Occupying\r\nthe Shenandoah Valley, in front of Sheridan, General Early lay, with\r\nabout eighteen thousand Confederate troops. To drive these troops out\r\nof, or at least further up, the Valley, and to keep them so employed\r\nthat no part of them should be detached from Early to send to Hood in\r\nhis defence of Atlanta against the attack of Sherman, was Sheridan's\r\nfirst concern during the summer and fall of '64. In pursuance of this\r\nplan, on the 10th of August, Sheridan began to move out his forces\r\nfrom Halltown for the possession of the Shenandoah Valley. When Early's\r\npositions were reached, he fell back, and continued to fall back, until\r\nhe reached Fisher's Hill, beyond Strasburg. In pursuing Early, Sheridan\r\nhad passed several gaps in the mountains which skirt the Valley, and\r\nleft them unguarded. Moseby, learning of this, hastily got together as\r\nmany of his guerillas as possible, dashed through Snicker's Gap on the\r\n13th, struck Sheridan's supply-train, which was only guarded by Kenly's\r\nbrigade of one hundred days' men, at Berryville, and, before the guard\r\nhad fairly recovered from the panic, Moseby had captured the entire\r\ntrain, consisting of seventy-five wagons, from five to six hundred\r\nhorses and mules, two hundred beef cattle, and a large quantity of\r\nstores. He also secured over two hundred prisoners. His own loss was\r\nonly two killed and three wounded.\r\n\r\nThe attack and loss were so sudden, so unexpected, and so exaggerated in\r\nthe telling from one soldier to another, that they seemed for the\r\nmoment to paralyze Sheridan's entire army; so much so that he deemed\r\nit expedient to make a retrograde movement, which he continued until\r\nhe reached, on the 21st of August, a position about two miles out from\r\nCharlestown. While Sheridan was thus falling back from day to day,\r\nMoseby's guerillas hung upon his rear and flanks, treacherously\r\ncapturing and killing whenever opportunity offered. In one instance, it\r\nis alleged, after taking some Union cavalrymen prisoners; after, indeed,\r\nthey had fully surrendered as prisoners of war and _been disarmed_,\r\nMoseby ordered _every one of them_ brutally murdered on the spot, in\r\npursuance of his maxim that \"dead men never bite.\" In retaliation for\r\nthis terrible outrage, Sheridan ordered that from thenceforth every\r\nhouse and barn of these half-guerillas, half-farmers in the Valley, that\r\ncould possibly be# reached by his cavalrymen, should be destroyed.\r\n\r\nNot only in retaliation for this one act, but for scores of other acts\r\nof a like or worse character, of which they were cognizant, and with a\r\nview to strike terror into the minds of such men as had been, and still\r\nwere, harboring and encouraging these guerillas--men who were farmers\r\nby day and robbers by night--both General Grant and General Sheridan\r\ndetermined to inaugurate a wholesale system of devastation in the\r\nlocalities where these outrages had been mostly carried on--especially\r\nin the Virginia counties of Shenandoah, Rockingham, Loudon, and\r\nFauquier. As a result of this policy--or, more properly speaking, _as a\r\nresult of the outrages which had been perpetrated by Moseby's guerillas_\r\n(for the policy would never have been thought of but for these\r\noutrages)--the following destruction of property is reported to have\r\noccurred in the four counties named, between the 1st of October, when\r\nthe policy was inaugurated, and the forepart of December (1864), when\r\nMerritt's cavalry division crossed the Blue Ridge, and made a grand raid\r\nthrough the upper part of Loudon and Fauquier counties:\r\n\r\nIn Shenandoah and Rockingham counties--according to the official report\r\nof a commissioner of the revenue to the Richmond authorities--\"there\r\nwere burned 18 dwelling-houses, 215 barns, 11 grist-mills, 9 water\r\nsaw-mills, 2 steam saw-mills, 1 furnace, 2 forges, 1 fulling-mill,\r\nbesides a number of smaller buildings, such as stables, etc. The\r\nquantity of grain destroyed is immense. I cannot give you any idea of\r\nthe amount of grain, hay, fodder, etc., destroyed, but the quantity is\r\nvery large.\"\r\n\r\nIn Loudon and Fauquier counties--according to the official report made\r\nby General Sheridan to General Grant at the time--the property burned\r\nand captured was as follows: Burned--barns, 1168; mills, 49; tanneries,\r\n1; factories, 2; distilleries, 6; tons of hay, 27,620; bushels of wheat,\r\n51,500; bushels of corn, 62,900; bushels of oats, 2000; haystacks, 1121;\r\nwheatstacks, 57; stacks of other grains, 104. Captured--horses, 388;\r\nmules, 8; cattle, 5520; sheep, 5837; swine, 1141. Total estimated value\r\nof property destroyed and captured in these two counties, $2,508,756.\r\n\r\nIt should be added, as a further reason for the destruction of wheat,\r\ncorn, hay, etc., that General Lee had been drawing his supplies largely\r\nfrom these four counties, and it was therefore for the purpose of\r\ncrippling Lee's army, as well as to punish these farmers for harboring\r\nand aiding Moseby's guerillas, that this wholesale destruction of\r\nproperty was planned and executed.\r\n\r\nThose who have witnessed the distress following the burning of a single\r\ndwelling-house, or a single barn with contents, in a neighborhood\r\nof farmers, can form some faint idea of the distress which must have\r\nfollowed the burning of eighteen dwelling-houses, and 1383 barns, with\r\nall their contents, and with all the stacks of grain, hay, and fodder\r\nsurrounding them! Even the thought is fearful,--how much more the\r\nreality! After what we have related of the operations of Moseby's\r\nguerillas--and what we have told is not a hundredth part of what might\r\nbe told--none of our readers, we think, will question the propriety of\r\nthe caption to this chapter, \"Guerillas on the War-path--Cunning and\r\nDuplicity Prompting the Actors;\" nor, after learning of the destruction\r\nof property which followed, will any one, we think, question the third\r\nline of the caption, \"Destruction in the Background!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0135]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. WHAT BECAME OF SLAVES DURING AND AFTER THE WAR. THE ALMIGHTY\r\nDOLLAR PROMPTING THE ACTORS.--\"WE NEBER SEED'EM ANY MORE.\"\r\n\r\n|IT is a well-attested fact, that there were many less slaves, or those\r\nwho had been slaves, in the United States on the 9th of April, 1865,\r\nwhen General Lee surrendered to General Grant, near the Appomattox\r\nCourt House, than when the war commenced by the firing on Fort Sumter,\r\non the 12th of April, 1861. Had there been no war, and had the ratio of\r\nincrease been the same from 1861 to 1865 as it had been for the previous\r\nfour years, there would have been several hundred thousand more in 1865\r\nthan there were in 1861.\r\n\r\nIt is also well known that from and after the 1st of January, 1863, when\r\nPresident Lincoln's proclamation of freedom to the slave--issued on\r\nthe 22d of September, 1862--went into effect, many hundreds, if not\r\nthousands, of those who had been slaves were taken into the military\r\nservice of the United States; that, when captured by the Confederate\r\nforces, they were not recognized as prisoners of war, but in many cases,\r\nas at Fort Pillow, were massacred like so many dogs; that thousands were\r\ndestroyed in this way, and that many other thousands died on fields of\r\nbattle; that many during the war tried to escape, but, being overtaken,\r\nwere killed on sight by their former masters or their agents; that the\r\nexcessive amount of labor which they were compelled to perform for their\r\nmasters on plantations, and for the Confederate government, in digging\r\nrifle-pits and throwing up fortifications, lessened their power\r\nof reproduction, and caused thousands of premature deaths; but,\r\nnotwithstanding all these facts, there still remains a very large number\r\nto be accounted for; and to account for these in part, if not wholly, is\r\nthe object of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nThe facts which we shall relate in this connection cannot fail to be\r\nas startling to our readers as they were to us. They have _never before\r\nbeen related,_ either in book or newspaper form; nor would they now be,\r\nbut that time has wiped out the passions of the war and the limits of\r\npersonal responsibility, and made the facts legitimate for the purposes\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nThat our readers may understand that no animosity towards the South, or\r\nthe Southern Confederacy, nor sympathy with the slave in any way,\r\nhas led to the divulging of these facts, we may say that Colonel\r\nAbercrombie, to whom we are indebted for the facts, is a Southern man (a\r\nBaltimorian) by birth, and from his earliest recollection was taught to\r\nlook upon the negro as a different race from our own--as a chattel, to\r\nbe bought and sold, the same as a horse or cow; that he was a captain\r\nin the Thirteenth United States Infantry in the early stages of the\r\nwar, but, being convinced that his duty lay with the South, resigned his\r\ncommission in the United States army, went South, joined the Confederate\r\nservice, and remained as an officer in that service until the close of\r\nthe war; and that it was not until soon after the war, when he went from\r\nNew York to Galveston by steamship, and from Galveston travelled nearly\r\nall over Texas on horseback, that he became fully aware of the facts\r\nwhich he detailed to us, and which we now purpose to communicate to our\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel, Captain Philip Lander, and three others, left Galveston for\r\nBrownsville about the middle of June, 1865. From Galveston to Houston\r\nthey went by steamboat; at Houston they purchased mules, and from\r\nthenceforth pursued their journey on muleback. At Columbus they found a\r\nconsiderable number of Confederate soldiers, who had belonged to General\r\nKirby Smith's command, and were then on their way to their homes. At\r\nBastrop they found two companies of United States volunteers doing guard\r\nduty. At Austin, the capital of the State, they found General Sturges\r\nwith four companies of the regiment which he commanded, the Seventh\r\nUnited States Cavalry. About the middle of July, they left Austin\r\nfor San Antonio. On the road they saw two men in one place, and one\r\nin another, hanging by the neck to limbs of trees, who had been strung\r\nup there by roving banditti--probably on the suspicion that they were\r\nUnion men--and left to hang there as a warning to others. At San\r\nAntonio they found General Magruder, who claimed that he had not yet\r\nsurrendered, though \"lying around loose,\" and, as they afterwards\r\nlearned, was probably looking after the interests of slave exporters,\r\nrather than the interests of the Southern Confederacy. It was the latter\r\npart of August when they left San Antonio for Brownsville. After five\r\ndays' travel from San Antonio, and just before reaching the branch\r\nroad which leads to Brazos San Diego, from the main military road to\r\nBrownsville, they overtook a gang of from six to eight hundred negroes,\r\nin charge of, and driven along by, about forty white men, part Americans\r\nand part Mexicans. The negroes consisted of men, women, and children.\r\nThere were no old men or old women among them. Some were handcuffed\r\ntogether; others were tied together with ropes; others not bound in any\r\nway. Some women were carrying children in their arms. All were on foot\r\nand seemed weary from long travel. Their drivers were all on horseback,\r\nsome at the front, some at the sides, and some in the rear, all armed\r\nwith pistols, all with whips in their hands, and all with curses in\r\ntheir mouths, which were hurled at the poor negroes on the slightest\r\nprovocation. Like cattle drivers, or worse, those at the sides and rear\r\nwere constantly hallooing, cursing, and saying to the negroes, \"Git\r\nalong! git along! Faster! faster!\" with an oath between each command.\r\nMany of the women, especially such as were carrying children,\r\nseemed ready to faint from exhaustion, and often turned their faces\r\nbeseechingly, and with tears in their eyes, towards their drivers, but\r\ntheir pleadings were only met by curses, still louder and still deeper,\r\nfrom their inhuman captors and drivers. Behind the gang were three\r\ntwo-wheeled carts and an old ambulance, in the first of which rations,\r\netc., were carried; in the ambulance, besides old clothes, lay a woman\r\nwhom the drivers said \"was about to kid.\"\r\n\r\nThe Colonel and his party rode along with this negro-driving party some\r\nthree or four hours, meanwhile gathering from their own lips all they\r\ncould relative to the character and extent of the business; how, when,\r\nand where inaugurated; how and to whom they sold their human chattels;\r\nwhat the profits of the business, and with whom the profits were\r\ndivided; what part, if any, the former owner got, etc., etc. The\r\ndrivers were not at all disposed to be communicative, nevertheless a\r\nconsiderable amount of information was drawn from them, part of\r\nwhich led to other clues, which, being followed up, led to additional\r\ninformation, the whole resulting in a development of the facts embraced\r\nin this chapter.\r\n\r\nWhen the branch road before spoken of was reached, the negro-drivers,\r\nwith their drove of human chattels, turned off for Brazos San Diego,\r\nwhile the Colonel and his party pursued their way to Brownsville\r\n(opposite Matamoras), which they reached on the following day. Here,\r\ntoo, they saw a considerable number of negroes in confinement, awaiting\r\nboats to take them down the Rio Grande River and thence to a market.\r\nFrom Brownsville the Colonel and his party went into Mexico, where they\r\nremained about six months. In February, 1866, the Colonel returned to\r\nTexas, and while stopping some time with Mr. Higgins, a large landowner\r\nand extensive cattle raiser, near Bastrop, overheard a Mexican ask his\r\nson, William Higgins, to get up a fandango at his saw-mills and invite\r\nall the negroes of the neighborhood, in order that he (the Mexican) and\r\nhis party might have opportunity to seize some of the negroes and run\r\nthem off to a market. This, it will be borne in mind, was about ten\r\nmonths after the close of the war, about six months since the Colonel\r\nhad seen the drove of negroes on the road to Brazos San Diego, and about\r\n_three years_ after President Lincoln's proclamation went into effect,\r\ndeclaring freedom to every slave within the limits of the Southern\r\nConfederacy.\r\n\r\nOf course, the Colonel was surprised at hearing such a proposition, and,\r\nthough as much of a pro-slavery man as any one could be after all that\r\nhad transpired, still felt curious to know all about this new business,\r\nor old business, as it might happen to be, of kidnapping, running\r\noff, and selling such as had been slaves. His inquiries resulted in\r\ndeveloping the following facts:\r\n\r\nFor many years prior to the war the breeding and raising of negroes had\r\nbecome as much of a standard business in Virginia as the planting and\r\nraising of cotton had formerly been, or as the breeding and raising of\r\ncattle still is in Texas. As the lands became poorer in Virginia from\r\nlong cultivation, the raising of crops became less and less profitable,\r\nuntil it was finally discovered that to raise about enough of crops\r\nto supply themselves and their negroes with bread and clothing, and to\r\ndevote all else of their thoughts and energies to the raising of negroes\r\nfor market and use in States where the climate and quality of soil made\r\nthe raising of cotton and rice a remunerative business, would, in the\r\nlong run, be much more profitable to them. This, therefore, became the\r\ngeneral sense of the State, and from thenceforth was generally\r\npursued throughout the State. This necessitated middlemen, or slave\r\nmerchants--such as would purchase the slave of the Virginia farmer at\r\nsuch price as might be agreed upon, take him or her to his place of\r\nbusiness, put them in the best possible trim for a market, and then take\r\nthem off in droves to South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, or wherever else\r\nneeded, and sell them at private or public sale for the best prices they\r\ncould obtain. Whatever inhumanity there might be in such business, it\r\ncertainly resulted in large profits, especially to the dealers, and\r\nhence it is not at all surprising that a great many should have been\r\nengaged in it.\r\n\r\nWhen the war commenced there were hundreds, if not thousands, of these\r\nslave-dealers throughout the South. Some went into the army; some, who\r\nhad well-filled purses, fled to Cuba, to 'Canada, to Nassau, to England;\r\nwhile others, too poor to get away, too cowardly to fight, too lazy to\r\nwork, and too ignorant to do any business other than what they had\r\nbeen doing, remained in the country and continued to ply their vocation\r\nwhenever and wherever opportunity offered. It was a fixed policy with\r\nthe Confederate Government not to allow slaves to be taken or sold\r\nbeyond their bounds, and that every possible precaution be taken to\r\nprevent the escape of slaves into the Union lines; but the Government\r\nhad no objection to the sale and transfer of slaves from Virginia to\r\nGeorgia, or to any other of the Confederate States, and as the Union\r\narmy advanced into Virginia, rather encouraged such sales and transfers,\r\nto prevent the escape of slaves into the Union lines. The effect of this\r\nwas to make an active and very profitable business for slave-dealers,\r\nand to largely increase the number of slaves in the more southern of the\r\nConfederate States.\r\n\r\nWhen, besides going into Virginia, Union armies commenced forward\r\nmovements into Kentucky and Tennessee, into Missouri and Arkansas, it\r\nwas deemed expedient to run off a large number of the slaves of those\r\nStates into Texas, the better to secure them from capture by the Union\r\narmies, and have them where they could be shipped to foreign ports,\r\nif not thereafter needed by the States of the Confederacy, or if,\r\nperadventure, the Confederacy itself might fail of success. When, on the\r\n16th of November, 1864, Sherman commenced his march \"from Atlanta to\r\nthe sea,\" a like necessity of getting slaves beyond the reach of Union\r\nsoldiers existed in all the Gulf States, and so far as it was possible\r\nto get them into Texas it was done. How many thousands, yea, how many\r\nhundreds of thousands were thus driven into Texas from other Confederate\r\nStates, God only knows, or will ever know!\r\n\r\nThis particular route was made necessary because of the blockading of\r\nSouthern ports; and because once in Texas, they could be held there\r\nuntil the result of the war was known. It was not, as before stated,\r\nthe policy of the Confederate Government to have the slaves taken beyond\r\ntheir control, as the corner-stone of the Confederacy was to be slavery,\r\nand the more they could have of it the greater, they thought, would be\r\ntheir prosperity; nor was it the policy of the slave-dealer to take his\r\nchattel beyond the reach of the best market in the world, so long as\r\nthere was a reasonable prospect of that market being kept open. In\r\nTexas the dealer had the double chance--either to return with his human\r\nchattels to the Confederate States, in case it became an established\r\ngovernment, or, if that failed, then to ship them from Brazos San Diego,\r\nfrom Brownsville, from Corpus Christi, from Powder Horn, or from any\r\nother port that might not be blockaded, to Cuba, to Brazil, or wherever\r\nelse slavery existed and a market could be found. These slave-dealers\r\nwatched the result of the contest between the North and the South with\r\nthe same interest that stock-jobbers and gold-gamblers watched the rise\r\nand fall of stocks, and the rise and fall of gold, when they had a large\r\nquantity of either on hand, and were waiting to turn their speculation\r\nto the best possible account. When news would reach them that the Union\r\narmies were carrying everything before them, off would go one or more\r\ncargoes of negroes to Cuba or Brazil. When, by the next mail probably,\r\nnews would reach them that the Confederate armies were meeting with\r\ngreat successes, making it probable that a Southern Confederacy would be\r\nestablished, they would regret that they had sent any away, and hold\r\nthe firmer to those they had left. The price at which slaves could be\r\nsold--especially at forced or hurried sales--in the Brazil and Cuban\r\nmarkets, was far less than what they could reasonably hope to obtain\r\nin the Southern Confederacy, _provided_ it became an acknowledged\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nWhen shipments of negroes were commenced from the Texan ports heretofore\r\nnamed, and how often, or to what extent they were made, we are unable\r\nto say definitely; but the probabilities are that they commenced\r\nimmediately after President Lincoln issued his proclamation of freedom\r\nto the slaves, September 22, 1862, and were made, to a greater or less\r\nextent, thereafter as news reached the dealers elevating or depressing\r\ntheir hopes of a permanent Southern Confederacy. After Sherman commenced\r\nhis march from Chattanooga to Atlanta, in May, 1864, and especially\r\nafter he resumed his march from Atlanta to Savannah, in November, 1864,\r\nand still more especially after he commenced his march from Savannah to\r\nCharleston, and thence to Richmond, in January, 1865, the slave-dealers\r\nin Texas thought they saw the handwriting on the wall, \"Mene, mene,\r\ntekel, upharsin\"--\"Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found\r\nwanting,\" and from thenceforth every steamer, schooner, or water-craft\r\nof any kind, that could carry ten or more persons, and which they could\r\npossibly procure in any way, was secured to run the negroes from Texas\r\nto such markets as it were possible to reach. They could not be taken to\r\nthe principal open ports of either Cuba or Brazil, lest, being seen\r\nby an anti-slavery man, the facts might be reported to United States\r\nconsuls and thence to the United States government; but they were\r\ntaken to out-of-the-way places along the coast of both countries, where\r\ncopartners in the business were in waiting to receive and make further\r\ndisposition of them. The money received from sales was sent back to the\r\ncopartners in Texas by the partner or agent bringing out the last lot,\r\nand thus a flow of negroes in one direction, and a flow of money, with\r\nwhich to buy more, in another direction, was kept up constantly.\r\n\r\nBut it was not necessary in all cases to make purchases and payments.\r\nIndeed, towards the close of the war, actual purchases were seldom made,\r\nand after the close of the war, none at all, though the business still\r\nremained active. The plan pursued was this: a dealer would go to a\r\nplanter, to a farmer, or to a man living in town or city, and ask him\r\nhow many slaves he owned. The answer would be ten, twenty, fifty, one\r\nhundred, or more, as the case might be; but he would probably add,\r\nimmediately after, that only one-half, or one-fourth, or less were then\r\nwith him--the others were hired out, or with the army, helping to dig\r\ntrenches, or running at large, he did not know where. The dealer, after\r\nexplaining to the owner the nature of his business, would propose to\r\ntake from him a written bill of sale of all the negroes he owned take\r\nhis own chances of catching them when and where he could, send them to a\r\nmarket when and where he could, and divide with the owner whatever might\r\nbe the net result of sales. The owner, reasoning from the standpoint\r\nthat \"a half loaf is better than no bread,\" and that if the Confederacy\r\nproved a failure he would get nothing at all for his slaves, would enter\r\ninto such written agreement with the dealer. With this in his pocket, to\r\nassure him from interference from pro-slavery men, and to prove to all\r\nwho might question him that his business was of a \"mercantile,\" rather\r\nthan of a kidnapping, character, the dealer and his agents would go\r\nforth to seize the negroes--men, women, and children--for whom he had\r\nbills of sale in his pocket. If resisted by a white man, out would come\r\nhis bill of sale to prove title; if resisted by a black man, he was shot\r\ndown or hung on the spot; if resisted by the alleged slave, he was at\r\nonce handcuffed, gagged, and marched away; if identity was questioned\r\nby a white man, the questioner had to prove property, while the bill of\r\nsale held by the dealer was regarded as _prima facie_ evidence of his\r\nright to the person claimed; if identity was questioned by the person\r\nseized, or by any other colored man, he was laughed at, gagged, or shot\r\ndown. In this way thousands were seized, thousands driven from where\r\nseized into Texas, and tens of thousands run from Texas to Brazilian and\r\nCuban ports.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the war, the fact that they had been made free by\r\nproclamation and by law spread rapidly among those who had been slaves,\r\nand from thenceforth the business of kidnapping and running them\r\noff became much more dangerous. While travelling through Texas, our\r\ninformant met many negroes on the road with pistols at their sides, or\r\nguns upon their shoulders, and, when asked what it meant, they would\r\nreply, \"Des am dangerous times, sa; we has to protect ourselves, you\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\nHe saw, too, as before stated, both black men and white men hanging to\r\nthe limbs of trees by the roadside, some of whom, doubtless, had been\r\nhung there because of resistance to kidnappers. All manner of means were\r\ndevised by these kidnappers to catch the negroes when and where they\r\ncould make the least resistance and the least noise. Even _ten months\r\nafter the war;_ as before stated, one of these dealers--the partner,\r\nprobably, of an extensive firm, made up of both Americans and\r\nMexicans--proposed to William Higgins to get up a fandango, or dance, at\r\nhis saw-mills, and invite thereto all the negroes in the neighborhood,\r\nfor the purpose, and only for the purpose, of enabling these kidnappers\r\nto seize and run off as many as could be ensnared within the trap, or\r\ngot hold of; and, as we have seen, it was _four months after the war_\r\nthat the drove of from six to eight hundred negroes were seen on the\r\nroad to Brazos San Diego.\r\n\r\nIt will be a wonder with some readers how it was possible to continue\r\nsuch a business after Union troops had been stationed at Austin, the\r\ncapital of the State, under so able a commander as General Sturges;\r\nand after they had been stationed at Bastrop, and at other large\r\ntowns throughout the State. The explanation is simply this: While the\r\nsentiment of the Union troops was entirely opposed to any such traffic,\r\nand while, in pursuance of law, their duty plainly was to hang any man\r\nwhom they found engaged in such a business, yet the sentiment of the\r\nwhite people, among whom the troops were located, was largely, if not\r\nuniversally, in favor of the traffic, and hence they would not inform\r\nagainst those who were engaged in it; and had the troops learned of, and\r\nattempted to arrest, any of the parties, every white man of the town or\r\nneighborhood would have risen in arms and attempted the rescue of the\r\nparties. Law, without public sentiment to sustain it, is a dead letter,\r\nor nearly so, under all circumstances, and where public sentiment is\r\ndecidedly opposed to a law, its execution is next to impossible.\r\n\r\nAnother wonder, scarcely less than the first, will be with some\r\nreaders, how it could be possible that honorable men--men whose personal\r\ncharacters before the war were above reproach, either from Southern or\r\nNorthern men; men who had led consistent Christian lives, and who had\r\nbeen regarded as bright and shining lights in their respective church\r\norganizations, could permit such things to be done before their very\r\neyes, and look on indifferently, if not approvingly. The explanation is\r\nthis: Most of this business of running off slaves was done without the\r\nknowledge of the Confederate authorities. Indeed, had it come to their\r\nears during the earlier stages of the war they would have done what\r\nthey could to prevent it, however indifferent they might have been to it\r\nduring the last year or last few months of the war. But a far weightier\r\nreason is, that what seems so heinous, so diabolical, so criminal\r\nindeed, to a Northern anti-slavery man, was, in the eyes of a Southern\r\npro-slavery man, only a fair business transaction, based on Bible\r\nauthority, State law, and the law of self-preservation. They regarded\r\nthese negroes as much the property of those who had owned them, as\r\nhorses or cattle would have been. Nor did they regard the proclamation\r\nof President Lincoln and the acts of Congress, whereby slaves were\r\ndeclared free, with any more awe or respect than they would have\r\nregarded a like proclamation, or like acts of Congress, if issued or\r\nmade with regard to horses or cattle. Hence, to their consciences it was\r\nno more of a sin to seize and run off to a market these negroes during\r\nthe war, or even after the war, than it would have been to seize or run\r\noff from the grasp of an enemy a like number of horses or cattle. That\r\nconscience is largely dependent on surroundings, and on education, is\r\nno longer a disputable question among mental philosophers. That the\r\ncannibal, who kills and eats his fellow-man, is just as conscientious\r\nin what he does as the man who kills and eats a lamb, is now a generally\r\nadmitted fact. With this philosophic truth as a stand-point from which\r\nto look at the subject, who can doubt that General Polk, who for so many\r\nyears had been the universally respected and highly beloved Bishop of\r\nthe diocese of Louisiana, was just as conscientious in his advocacy\r\nof slavery, and in his defence of the Southern Confederacy, as Bishop\r\nSimpson was in his opposition to slavery and his advocacy of the Union.\r\nWho can doubt that General Pendleton, who had been for so many years a\r\nreverend doctor in the Episcopal Church, and the head of a seminary\r\nnear Alexandria, Va., and who never gave the order to fire without first\r\nraising his eyes heavenward and saying, \"God have mercy on their souls,\"\r\nwas just as conscientious in the belief that slavery was justified by\r\nthe Bible, and approved of by God, as John Wesley was in the belief\r\nthat \"slavery was the sum of all villanies\"? Who can doubt that General\r\nJackson (\"Stonewall\"), with whom the Bible was a constant companion, who\r\nprayed while he marched, who prayed when he encamped, who prayed even\r\nwhile directing the movements of a battle, was just as conscientious in\r\nhis belief that slavery was right, as Wendell Phillips was that slavery\r\nwas wrong; just as conscientious in the belief that the Southern\r\nConfederacy should succeed, in order to make slavery perpetual in this\r\ncountry, as General Birney was that the Union cause should succeed, if\r\nfor no other reason than to wipe out slavery once and forever from the\r\nUnited States. This, certainly, is the charitable view to take of the\r\nwhole subject; nor, with our present knowledge of ethics and mental\r\nphilosophy, is it any more charitable than true.\r\n\r\nReason about it as we may, however, the fact remains that tens of\r\nthousands, probably hundreds of thousands, were driven out and run out\r\nof the United States in the manner indicated, and are now, if still\r\nalive, toiling as slaves in other lands; and that many a father, many\r\na mother, many a sister, and many a brother, after their loved ones had\r\nbeen thus kidnapped and taken away, without any knowledge upon the part\r\nof their friends, have had reason to cry out in the bitterness of their\r\nsouls, \"_We neber seed 'em any more!\"_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. THE CONFEDERACY AS SEEN FROM WITHIN. PRIDE, PASSION, AND WANT\r\nIN THE BACKGROUND.\r\n\r\n|SINCE the war, we have seen, and had long conversations with, a\r\nreverend doctor, whom we had known for many years previous to the war,\r\nwho resided in Virginia when the war commenced, was among the first to\r\ntake part in it, and who continued in the service until the war closed.\r\nWe have also met other Confederate officers since the war, some of whom\r\nhad extraordinary facilities for obtaining information while the war\r\ncontinued. From all these we learned much beyond anything we had ever\r\nknown before, or ever seen in newspapers or books. To put on record some\r\nof the things so learned is the object of the present chapter.\r\n\r\nThe South well knew, in the very beginning of the contest, that in\r\npoint of numbers, in wealth, and in material resources, it was greatly\r\ninferior to the North. They had hope, however, of dividing the North,\r\nor, rather, of having the North divide against itself; and had the\r\none-hundredth part of the promises made them by Northern men been kept,\r\nthere would indeed have been a division of force, as well as a division\r\nof political sentiment, in the North; and the result of such division\r\nmight have given the final victory to the Confederacy, instead of to the\r\nUnion cause. But what the South relied upon still more, was assistance\r\nfrom England. They had been led to believe that King Cotton was almost,\r\nif not quite, as powerful in England as Queen Victoria, and they had\r\nlaid the \"flattering unction to their souls\" that so soon as King Cotton\r\nsaw those who had made him king in distress, he would rush, pell-mell,\r\nto their rescue; scatter the Yankee blockading squadrons to the winds;\r\nthrow open all the Southern ports; bring men, ammunition, clothing, and\r\nprovisions to exchange for their cotton, and thus, beyond any reasonable\r\ndoubt, insure success to the Southern cause.\r\n\r\nAs well assured as they felt of all this, they still regarded it as\r\nimportant to keep all the while the \"best foot foremost;\" to keep up an\r\n_appearance_ of strength, however weak they might be; to keep up a show\r\nof independence, however much they might be hoping and praying for help.\r\nLike as an expectant bride, though she has the plighted faith of her\r\nlover, will continue to smile, to dress, to allure in every way she can,\r\nup to the very hour of the marriage ceremony, so the South continued to\r\nsmile, to dress, to allure, in every way she could, her Northern\r\nallies, who had solemnly plighted their faith to her, and her English\r\nsympathizers, whose pecuniary interests lay all in that direction,\r\nand these things she continued to do up to the very moment when the\r\nConfederacy collapsed, and when it was found that nothing was left of\r\nthe egg but the shell. As our reverend friend said to us, over and over\r\nagain, and as other Confederate officers have said to us, over and over\r\nagain, \"none but those within the lines, and behind the scenes, knew of\r\nthe destitution, of the suffering, of the heart-aches, of the skeletons\r\nwithin closets while those who held the keys were smiling as if they\r\nwere full of good things, of the turns and shifts which not only the\r\narmy but which almost every family in the South had to make, in order\r\nto preserve life, and yet keep up a fair outside show, during those four\r\nterrible years of war.\" And now for the illustrations--little or none of\r\nwhich has ever before been published.\r\n\r\nAfter the first year of the war, so much in want of food was the\r\nConfederate army at times, that, in one instance, an officer, with an\r\nescort, travelled sixty miles before he could purchase food enough to\r\nload one six-mule wagon which he had with him. Even then they had to go\r\nwithin the Union lines, and run very great risk of being captured.\r\n\r\nThe same officer from whom we learned the above incident, also told us\r\nthat, on one occasion, he and the men with him were so ravenous from\r\nhunger that he shot an old sow that had had a large litter of pigs only\r\nthe day before, and that while he and his fellow officers ate the meat\r\n(if meat it could be called) of the old sow, his men ate not only the\r\none-day-old pigs, but even the very entrails of the mother.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion this same officer shot an opossum that had just been\r\nhaving its young, and while, under ordinary circumstances, he could no\r\nmore have eaten its flesh than he could have eaten a viper, yet such was\r\nhis hunger at the time that the dish seemed palatable. Often, he said,\r\nhe had gone for a whole day, and occasionally two or three days at a\r\ntime, without one \"square meal;\" and this he knew to be an ordinary\r\nexperience among officers of the Confederate army, especially during the\r\nlast year of the war, and largely so during the two or three last years\r\nof the war. Certainly, if there was an officer in that army who had\r\nopportunities to live on the \"fat of the land,\" he was one of them, and\r\nif he suffered thus, God only knows what must have been the sufferings\r\nof others!\r\n\r\nEarly in the war, coffee became scarce, and, during the last year or\r\ntwo, hardly to be had at all within the lines of the Confederacy. To\r\nprocure it, all manner of devices were resorted to. On one occasion,\r\nwhen two sentinels were within calling distance of each other--one on\r\neither side of an intervening deep ravine--a Confederate officer present\r\ntold his sentinel to ask the Union sentinel whether his company had\r\nany coffee which they would exchange for tobacco. The Union sentinel\r\ninquired of his captain, and after a time hallooed back that they had\r\nof their company rations a bag of coffee left over, which they would\r\nexchange for tobacco, provided they could make a good trade. The\r\nConfederate officer instructed his sentinel to reply that they would\r\ngive twenty-five boxes of plug tobacco for one bag of coffee. The offer\r\nwas accepted, and as soon after as the coffee and the tobacco could be\r\nbrought to the spot, the Union sentinel rolled down the bag of coffee,\r\nthe Confederate sentinel rolled down the twenty-five boxes of tobacco,\r\nto the foot of the ravine, when, with assistants, each took away the\r\narticle traded for--hostilities being suspended meanwhile. Each of the\r\nparties was highly pleased with the trade. Before the war one or two\r\nboxes of tobacco would have brought in the New York market as much, if\r\nnot more, than one bag of coffee.\r\n\r\nPins and needles became so scarce in the Confederacy that at least one\r\nman--a Mr. Webster Sly, of Charles County, Md., brother to a celebrated\r\ndoctor in that vicinity--made quite a fortune by smuggling trunks full\r\nof these articles across the Union lines and selling them within the\r\nConfederate lines.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1863, one of our informants saw dogs in the streets of\r\nCharleston so emaciated that they could scarcely walk, and at one time\r\nsaw one of these animals leaning against a fence and chewing upon an old\r\nshoe. In that city and in Richmond he knew of families who had once\r\nbeen wealthy that were, during the war, compelled to sell not only\r\ntheir clothing, but even their beds, to procure food to live upon. Our\r\nreverend friend himself, though at one time the owner of a handsome\r\nhouse and of slaves, had, while at Petersburg, been compelled to live,\r\nwith his wife and daughter, in a garret, and upon food that a dog would\r\nscarcely have eaten under ordinary circumstances.\r\n\r\nNot only did such destitution prevail throughout the Confederate States\r\nduring the war, but still worse evils prevailed, engendered by pride,\r\njealousy, and passion. While this fact was carefully concealed from\r\nNorthern eyes and ears, and from English eyes and ears, yet it prevailed\r\nto an alarming extent, and when occasionally it would burst forth in\r\nsuch violence as to cause death, no mention of the fact was made in the\r\nnewspapers at Richmond lest it might reach Northern or English ears.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the beginning of the war two parties sprang up in the\r\nConfederacy, known as the \"Davis party\" and the \"Stephens party.\"\r\nPresident Davis advocated one line of policy; Vice-President Stephens\r\nadvocated another line of policy. Their respective friends took sides,\r\neach with his chief, and so bitter became the strife between the two,\r\nthat when the Government was removed from Montgomery to Richmond Mr.\r\nStephens would not come there to preside over the deliberations of\r\nthe Senate. At one time, in 1863, the strife between their respective\r\npartisans in the Confederate Congress, then meeting in Richmond, became\r\nso great, that a Virginian (a Davis man) shot and killed a Georgian\r\n(a Stephens man) upon the floor of the House for some words uttered\r\nin debate. The excitement for the moment was intense. Pistols and\r\nbowie-knives were drawn by dozens of Congressmen, and it seemed that\r\nmany additional lives would have to be sacrificed then and there before\r\nthe affray could end, but erelong quiet was restored and the dead body\r\nof the slain member removed from the chamber. Our informant saw the dead\r\nbody as it was carried along the street, inquired after and learned all\r\nthe incidents of the bloody affair, but neither on that day nor on any\r\nday thereafter was a word said about it in the Richmond newspapers.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of much irritation, much jealousy, and much bad blood,\r\narose in the appointing of general officers for the Confederate army.\r\nMr. Davis, being himself a \"West-Pointer,\" it was not unnatural that he\r\nshould prefer, in all cases, graduates of West Point; but, as the people\r\nof the several States had to furnish not only the money, but the men for\r\nthe army, it was not unnatural that they should desire to see some of\r\ntheir leading citizens in command of the men they furnished. The people\r\nbelieved that brains were quite as essential to success as technical\r\nmilitary knowledge, and were not willing to trust all their interests,\r\npersonal and pecuniary, to the direction of such as knew little or\r\nnothing beyond military tactics. The demand became so strong and so\r\npersistent that the administration yielded, so far as to appoint Bishop\r\nPolk, Rev. Dr. Pendleton, John C. Breckinridge, and Bradley Johnson, to\r\ngeneralships; but beyond this, few, if any, held high positions in the\r\narmy, other than West-Point-ers. Towards the close of the war, General\r\nLee said, at a dinner given to army officers, at Orange Court-House,\r\nnear his headquarters, that from thenceforth the \"policy of the\r\ngovernment would be to give promotion to such, and such only, as fairly\r\nearned it on the field of battle, without regard to their previous\r\nmilitary education.\" This speech was reported at once in every part of\r\nthe Confederacy, and as he was presumed to speak by authority, it had\r\nthe effect to quiet, in a great measure, the excitement which had so\r\nlong existed relative to military appointments.\r\n\r\nAnother source of demoralization, and, consequently, of weakness in the\r\nConfederacy, was the disposition to gamble among so many of its officers\r\nand leading citizens. At Richmond, while so many, who had been affluent,\r\nwere almost starving; while the gradual disappearance, and finally the\r\nentire absence, of cats and dogs in the city, proved that meat other\r\nthan lamb was supplying the tables of many of its citizens; while even\r\nthe highest officers of State were, at times, sorely perplexed about\r\nfood for their families, the gambling houses of that city were doing\r\na splendid business, and furnishing free lunches to their patrons far\r\nsuperior to what could be found upon the table of President Davis or any\r\nmember of his cabinet. Indeed, it became well known among Confederate\r\narmy officers, and among the leading gentlemen of the city as well, that\r\nthe best eatables and the best drinkables to be had in the Confederacy\r\nwere to be had at these gambling saloons, and many a one was induced to\r\npatronize them on this account more than on any other. It was said that\r\nthe proprietors of these saloons could obtain, and did obtain, supplies\r\nfrom the North, when the highest officers and the wealthiest men of\r\nRichmond could not obtain them. How done, except through pals and noted\r\ngamblers, some of whom were well-known spies, and often in Washington,\r\nwas never known. Notwithstanding the expensive free lunches given by\r\nthese gambling houses every day, they made immense amounts of money.\r\nWhat they made in gold and greenbacks they carefully stored away, or\r\nmade use of in the purchase of supplies. What they got in Confederate\r\nmoney they invested in real estate, so that, when the war ended, the\r\ngamblers of Richmond owned more real estate than any other class of\r\npersons, if not more than all other classes combined. What was true of\r\nRichmond, in all these particulars, was probably true of every other\r\ncity in the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nStill another source of weakness in the Confederacy was the lack of\r\nconfidence; almost from the beginning, in the currency issued by\r\nthe government, or by its authority. It was thought to be a terrible\r\ncondition of things in the North when a gold dollar commanded $2.85 in\r\ngreenbacks; when muslin, that had sold for ten cents per yard, sold for\r\nthirty; when coffee, sugar, meats, almost everything, commanded double,\r\nand, in some cases, treble the prices at which they had sold before the\r\nwar; but these were as nothing when compared with the South. A single\r\nchicken leg, or a single chicken wing, with a small piece of corn-bread\r\ntied to it, sold at from one to two dollars at many of the railroad\r\ndepots; a drink of brandy or whiskey, at the Ballard House, Richmond,\r\ncost five dollars; a single meal, at the same house, ten dollars; a\r\ngentleman's dressing-gown, smuggled through from the North by a land\r\nblockade-runner, sold, in Richmond, for eleven hundred dollars. Of\r\ncourse, all these prices mean Confederate currency. Such as were wise\r\nenough to invest their Confederate money in real estate had something of\r\nreal value after the war. Such as failed to do this, had large amounts\r\nin what purported to be money, but not one penny in real value, after\r\nthe war ended. Every dollar of gold or silver that came within the\r\nConfederate lines, after the second year of the war, was either hoarded\r\nor hid away, or expended for needed supplies, in which case it soon\r\nfound its way back to the North or to England.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we close this tenth scene of the drama, in which we have\r\nendeavored to give our readers a glimpse of the Southern Confederacy as\r\nseen from within; and to show, too, that pride, passion, and want formed\r\na fearful picture in the background.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0161]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. HOW ORDER WAS MAINTAINED. KINDNESS AND POWER (HAND-IN-HAND)\r\nBEHIND THE SCENES.\r\n\r\n|THE city of Alexandria is situated about seven miles below Washington,\r\non the Potomac River. It was at one time a part of the District of\r\nColumbia, but, by a subsequent arrangement, was retroceded to Virginia.\r\nPrior to the war it was a place of considerable business; contained,\r\nprobably, thirty thousand inhabitants; had some fine streets, and a few\r\nhandsome buildings; and was a favorite place of resort, as well as of\r\nresidence, for the more wealthy and influential citizens of that part of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nAfter the war commenced, by the firing on Fort Sumter, the first object\r\nof the United States Government was to save Washington from falling into\r\nthe hands of the enemy. Between the 18th of May and the 23d of June,\r\n1861, thirty-one fully organized regiments and three independent\r\ncompanies arrived in that city. Of these, four were from Pennsylvania,\r\nalso the three independent companies, four from Massachusetts, eleven\r\nfrom New York State, four from New Jersey, two from Rhode Island, three\r\nfrom Connecticut, one from Michigan, and two from Ohio. These regiments\r\nnumbered about 28,000 men. Besides these, there were about 4,000\r\nDistrict of Columbia militia, organized under Colonel Stone, and about\r\n4,000 regular United States troops. All these were concentrated, thus\r\nearly, for the defence of the capital, and to form a pivot for future\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nThough these volunteer regiments had had but little opportunity for\r\ndrill, the impatience of the North soon made it necessary for them to\r\nmake a forward movement of some kind; and, as Alexandria was the most\r\napproximate point, and as a considerable force of the Confederates were\r\nknown to be concentrated there, it was resolved to make an attack upon,\r\nand, if possible, capture that city. Accordingly, at midnight on the\r\n23d of May, 1861, a small force was pushed across the Long Bridge to\r\nthe Virginia side, to clear and hold the head of the bridge; and at two\r\no'clock on the following morning a considerable force left Washington on\r\nfoot, while a regiment of Zouaves, under command of Colonel Ellsworth,\r\nleft on two steamers--all for Alexandria. The movement was so concerted\r\nthat the force on foot reached the outskirts of the city at the same\r\ntime that Ellsworth's force reached the wharves. The Confederate force\r\nat Alexandria was far too small to contend with the Union force sent\r\nagainst them, and as the one entered the other retired from the city.\r\nBut for the unfortunate death of Colonel Ellsworth, who was shot by\r\nJames Jackson, the proprietor of the Marshall House, while the\r\nformer was removing a Confederate flag which had been flying from the\r\nflag-staff of that hotel, and the killing of Jackson, which followed\r\nimmediately after, there would have been no blood shed in the capture of\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nNot only did the Confederate troops retire on the approach of the Union\r\ntroops, but a large number of families and single citizens left at the\r\nsame time. Indeed, for several days previous to the coming of the Union\r\ntroops, it was well known in Alexandria that they were coming, and many\r\nof its citizens, some of whom owned farms in other parts of Virginia,\r\nsome plantations in other parts of the South, and others who had friends\r\nand relatives in other parts of the State, or in other parts of\r\nthe South, had all quietly left for their respective farm-homes,\r\nplantations, or friends. Some who could not leave thus suddenly went\r\nas soon as they could thereafter, so that, before a Union line had been\r\nfully established beyond Alexandria, probably two-thirds of its citizens\r\nhad left, leaving only about ten thousand out of a previous population\r\nof about thirty thousand.\r\n\r\nImmediately thereafter, however, the Union forces commenced to establish\r\ncamps at points beyond, yet not far from, Alexandria. Near the Seminary\r\nbuildings, only a few miles from the city, a considerable number of\r\ntroops were encamped; while, at Malvern Hills, at Edsall's farm, at or\r\nnear Fall's Church, and at many other points, regiments, brigades, or\r\nwhole divisions were located. As a consequence of this, notwithstanding\r\nAlexandria had been so largely abandoned by its own citizens, its\r\nstreets were more thronged with citizens and soldiers combined, its\r\ndrinking saloons were more frequented, and there was more of bustle and\r\nconfusion generally in the city during the summer, fall, and winter of\r\n1861 than there had ever been in any past period of its history.\r\n\r\nWith the hasty leaving of the leading citizens of Alexandria had gone\r\nwhatever it had possessed of municipal, county, or State government. The\r\nmayor and members of the city council had fled; all the State and county\r\njudges had fled; the county clerk, the surrogate, and every other county\r\nofficer had fled; nor was there a single justice of the peace, a\r\nsingle constable, or a single police-officer--or, at least, not one\r\nwho declared himself as such--left in the city. There was no formal\r\nannouncement of the establishing of martial law within the city limits,\r\nbut its possession by Union troops made it virtually so from the moment\r\nthey took possession.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Bull Run occurred on the 21st of July, 1861, and although\r\nAlexandria had been bad enough before that time, it was still worse\r\nafter. For some time after that battle the Union army seemed utterly\r\ndemoralized. The commanders of regiments, brigades, and divisions seemed\r\nfor the moment to have lost all control over their men. Officers and\r\nmen, instead of remaining in camp to drill, flocked into Washington and\r\ninto Alexandria by scores, yea, by hundreds, every day. Hotels, drinking\r\nsaloons, restaurants' houses of ill-fame were all doing a rushing\r\nbusiness, and meanwhile the legitimate duties of the officer and\r\nthe soldier were almost wholly neglected. General McClellan reached\r\nWashington, and assumed command of the Army of the Potomac, on the 26th\r\nof July, 1861, and on the 30th issued an order in which he said, \"The\r\ngeneral commanding the division has with much regret observed that large\r\nnumbers of officers and men stationed in the vicinity of Washington\r\n(his command included Alexandria and beyond as well) are in the habit\r\nof frequenting the streets and hotels of the city. This practice is\r\neminently prejudicial to good order and discipline, and must at once be\r\ndiscontinued.\" This order had a salutary effect to a certain extent, but\r\nit by no means cured the evil. It made officers and men more careful to\r\nprocure leaves of absence and passes before leaving their camps; for, if\r\nfound in Washington or Alexandria without such leave or pass, they were\r\nliable to be called upon by the provost-marshal, or arrested by the\r\nprovost-guard; but, after the first week or two, in the lessening of\r\nnumbers the effect of the order was hardly perceptible. The hotels,\r\ndrinking saloons, restaurants, and houses of ill-fame still continued to\r\ndo a thriving business; while fights in saloons, brawls in the streets,\r\ninsults to persons walking the streets, thefts, robberies, and the like\r\nmisdemeanors, were of almost daily and nightly occurrence.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things in Alexandria, when, in August, 1861,\r\nGeneral William R. Montgomery, who had been the Colonel of the First\r\nNew Jersey regiment of volunteers, but had recently been promoted to\r\na brigadier-generalship, was detached from his command, then encamped\r\nnear the Seminary buildings, and assigned to the command (as Military\r\nGovernor) of Alexandria. He had for his Assistant Adjutant-General,\r\nJacob R. Freese, of Trenton, N. J., who had been an active business-man\r\nall his life (he was then about thirty-five years of age), and who for\r\nthe four years immediately preceding the war had been the editor and\r\nproprietor of the _State Gazette_, one of the leading newspapers of the\r\nState. General Montgomery was then about sixty years of age, a graduate\r\nof West Point, had been connected with the regular army nearly all his\r\nlife--a perfect gentleman in his manners, mild, quiet, unobtrusive,\r\nexceedingly kind and gentle; but knew comparatively nothing of business\r\nlife, and had hardly been in a police-office or a courtroom during his\r\nwhole life. Though no officer in the army was truer to the Union cause\r\nthan he, yet so exceedingly kind was he in his general disposition,\r\nso disliked to refuse any favor asked of him, and so averse was he to\r\npunishment of any kind, that he soon found his new situation a very\r\nperplexing one. Hardly had he assumed command, before such of the\r\nsecessionists as remained in Alexandria commenced to ask favors at his\r\nhands. In all cases, where he possibly could, it gave him as much or\r\nmore pleasure to grant their requests than for them to receive the\r\nfavors. This soon became known to extreme Unionists, who thereupon\r\ncalled the General \"a rebel in disguise.\" When this came to the\r\nGeneral's ears, it distressed him greatly. It also distressed him\r\nas much, or more, to learn that some Alexandrians who remained were\r\npractising great cruelty towards some white citizens, and especially\r\ntowards their slaves, because they had dared to express Union\r\nsentiments. And still another source of great annoyance to him was, that\r\ngreat numbers of soldiers came into the city every day--some got drunk,\r\nabused citizens, created brawls in the streets, and then left without\r\nso much as saying \"by your leave, sir.\" Other disputes and disturbances\r\nwere occurring, almost daily, among the citizens, which, when all\r\nother means failed, would be referred to him for settlement, since, as\r\nheretofore stated, there were no courts left in the city to whom such\r\ndisputes could be referred. To organize a court-martial and keep it in\r\nsession all the while would take a number of officers from their regular\r\nduties, and seemed utterly impracticable. To undertake to arbitrate\r\nand decide all cases himself, seemed not less impracticable, if not\r\nimpossible; and as to prescribing punishment to others, he would almost\r\nprefer to take it upon himself.\r\n\r\nEvery day he talked these troublesome matters over with his Assistant\r\nAdjutant-General, and finally requested him to draw up, and submit to\r\nhim, in writing, a plan for governing the city. This he did on the day\r\nfollowing the request. The leading feature of the plan submitted was\r\nto organize a provost-court, over which some officer should preside as\r\nprovost-judge, who should hear and adjudicate all cases of whatsoever\r\nkind brought before him. To arrest delinquents and enforce the orders\r\nof the provost-court, the plan proposed that the soldiers, detailed for\r\nsentinel duty in the city, should be organized into a provost-guard,\r\nwith a provost-marshal at their head; that both the marshal and guard\r\nshould be subject to the direct orders of the provost-judge; and that\r\nthe provost-judge should submit his doings, every day, to the military\r\ngovernor for his approval, amendment, or reversal, since he alone was\r\nresponsible to the general government for what was done within his\r\ncommand. General Montgomery considered the plan carefully and decided\r\nto adopt it. He then asked his Adjutant to accept the appointment of\r\nprovost-judge, and perform its duties, in addition to such as he had as\r\nAssistant Adjutant-General of the post. At first the Adjutant declined,\r\nnot seeing how it was possible for him to perform both duties, since\r\neither one of them seemed quite as much as any one man could perform.\r\nThe General urged that, as he would be held officially responsible for\r\nwhatever the provost-judge might do, he must have some one in whom he\r\nhad implicit confidence, some one whom he could see and converse with at\r\nevery meal-time, some one who was familiar with the workings of courts\r\nof justice, and since he, the Adjutant, had drawn up the plan, there was\r\nno one whom he could detail that could put the plan in operation so\r\nwell as he. The Adjutant, on the other hand, urged that his duties were\r\nalready quite as much as he could perform satisfactorily to himself;\r\nthat almost every day he had quartermaster, commissary, and hospital\r\nreports to examine and sign; passes and permits to consider and issue,\r\netc.; all of which involved the writing, \"By order of Brigadier-General\r\nMontgomery, J. R. Freese, A. A. G.,\" from one hundred to five hundred\r\ntimes each day, which usually occupied every minute of his time. It was\r\nfinally arranged that the General should detail two additional clerks\r\nfor the Adjutant's office, and one to write up the records of the court\r\nat every sitting, and thereupon the Adjutant consented to enter upon\r\nthe additional duty of provost-judge of the city. The General issued the\r\nnecessary order, over his own signature, and on the day following the\r\nAdjutant entered upon his new duties.\r\n\r\nThe court-house had not been used for any purpose since the evacuation\r\nof the city by the Confederates. Men were now put to work in cleaning\r\nand fitting it up for the purposes of the new provost-court. A large\r\nbuilding on the outskirts of the city, which had been used for the\r\ntemporary detention of slaves, and therefore called a \"slave-pen,\"\r\nwas cleaned and fitted up as a guard-house. The old jail was cleaned,\r\nwhitewashed, and renovated generally. A large, empty building, in the\r\nheart of the city, was fitted up for the provost-marshal's office, and\r\nas quarters for the guards. Captain Griffiths, of Pennsylvania, the\r\nsenior captain of the companies then on duty as sentinels, was appointed\r\nprovost-marshal, and the two companies then on duty organized as a\r\nprovost-guard. The duty assigned them was to arrest every drunken\r\nman--officer, private, or citizen--whom they observed to be disturbing\r\nthe peace of the city, whether at hotels, drinking saloons, on the\r\nstreets, or elsewhere; to take them, so soon as arrested, to the officer\r\nin charge at the guard-house and report all the facts to him; if\r\nthe officer at the guard-house deemed the complaint to be of such\r\nseriousness as to require a further hearing, the arrested party was to\r\nbe locked up until the next sitting of the provost-court, when he was to\r\nbe brought before that court for trial. This was to be the procedure\r\nnot only in cases of drunkenness, but in all other cases of petty\r\nmisdemeanor. If, however, the offence was of a more serious character,\r\nthe party arrested was to be taken at once before the provost-marshal,\r\nand all the facts immediately after reported to the provost-judge. If\r\nhe deemed the charges sufficiently strong to hold the arrested party, he\r\nwas then to be sent to the county jail and there held until next day, or\r\nuntil the court was ready to try the case, which usually was on the\r\nday following the arrest. It was arranged that a session of the\r\nprovost-court should be held every day (Sundays excepted) at the\r\ncourt-house, commencing at ten o'clock, and continue until all the cases\r\nwere disposed of. Usually this could be done between ten and twelve\r\no'clock; but occasionally the sessions extended until late in the\r\nafternoon.\r\n\r\nAfter all needed arrangements had been completed, the Judge's\r\nhorse--saddled, bridled, and with a pair of loaded revolvers in the\r\nholsters--might be seen every morning, at precisely nine and a half\r\no'clock, standing before the General's headquarters. At precisely a\r\nquarter to ten, Judge Freese would come out of the Adjutant's office in\r\nfull uniform, mount his horse, and, usually on a full gallop, ride\r\nto the court-house, about a quarter of a mile distant from the\r\nheadquarters. On reaching the court-house the Judge dismounted, a\r\nsoldier took charge of his horse, and he passed in to take his seat\r\non the bench. Generally, the guards, and the prisoners from the\r\nguard-house, were already in waiting--every guard standing at attention,\r\nwith loaded musket and fixed bayonet. It was from this fact that it\r\nwas sometimes designated, by New York journals and others, as \"Judge\r\nFreese's Bayonet Court.\" The clerk, acting as \"crier,\" then announced\r\nthat the \"court was now open for business,\" and immediately after handed\r\nthe Judge a list containing the names of all the prisoners at the\r\nbar, with the nature of the offence charged against each. The Judge,\r\nbeginning with No. I, would call for the evidence of the sentinel making\r\nthe arrest, and then for the evidence of others who might know anything\r\nof the case. When the evidence for the prosecution had closed, the\r\naccused was asked to say anything he could in his own defence, and to\r\nproduce any witnesses he might have. It was plainly to be seen that\r\nthe Judge always leaned towards mercy; that he encouraged and aided the\r\nprisoner in the making of a defence, if any were possible; that never,\r\nat any time, did he speak harshly to a prisoner at the bar; but even in\r\nhis sentences so tempered his words with kindness and good advice as to\r\nmake the accused determine to do better in the future. At no session of\r\nthe court, nor at any time after, was a prisoner ever known to complain\r\nof his treatment by the Judge, such was his uniform kindness and\r\ncourtesy towards all who were brought before him, whether citizens or\r\nsoldiers, white or black. When all the evidence was in on both sides,\r\nthe Judge announced the sentence and the clerk recorded it The book in\r\nwhich the record was kept was open to the inspection and revision of the\r\nGeneral commanding (military governor) every day, so that he might, if\r\nhe chose, at once change or reverse any sentence which the Judge had\r\npassed upon any prisoner. The number of cases tried each day varied\r\nfrom ten to thirty. Most of them were of a minor character, and the\r\npunishment, consequently, very light Often the one day or one night's\r\ndetention in the guard-house, which they had already received, was\r\ndeemed sufficient; in other more serious cases, a fine of from one to\r\nfive dollars, or further confinement in the guard-house or in the jail\r\nfrom one to five days, was imposed; but now and then a case of far\r\ngraver character was brought before the court, one of which we will now\r\nrelate.\r\n\r\nMr. A. was an old resident of Alexandria, and for many years had been\r\nengaged in business as a hardware merchant He was a Virginian by birth;\r\na man of general good character, a hearty secessionist, and would have\r\ngone when the others left, only that his family and his business were in\r\nsuch condition that the one could not be removed, nor could the other be\r\nclosed without very great discomfort and a large sacrifice. He therefore\r\nconcluded to take his chances of remaining, and did remain.\r\n\r\nMr. B. had been a resident of Alexandria for several years. Had been one\r\nof the builders, and was then superintendent, of the gas-works of that\r\ncity. He was a New Englander by birth, and an earnest Unionist from the\r\nday the contest opened between the North and the South. Though a very\r\nquiet man, and never speaking upon political or warlike matters, except\r\nwhen in situations where he must speak or show cowardice, yet when thus\r\ncompelled to speak he never failed to express his honest sentiments.\r\n\r\nMessrs. A. and B. had been warm personal friends for several years,\r\nthe latter purchasing all the hardware needed for the gas-works of the\r\nformer, and being in his store frequently, as well for pastime as\r\non business. Until the war commenced there had never been a word of\r\ndifference between them, and since it commenced they had rarely spoken\r\nupon the subject, for each well knew the others sentiments, and neither\r\ndesired a rupture of friendly relations. On the day in which a rupture\r\ndid occur, Mr. B. went to Mr. A.'s store to make a purchase of some\r\narticle, when in some way the conversation between them turned upon the\r\nwar. For some cause Mr. A. seemed to be in a specially bad-humor that\r\nday, and very soon commenced to use most violent language toward the\r\n\"Yankees\" and the Union troops. Mr. B. replied, at first very mildly,\r\nbut one word led to another, until erelong both became angry and talked\r\nloud. All of a sudden Mr. A., who was a large, powerful man, seized Mr.\r\nB., who was a much smaller, weaker man, by the throat, and hurled him to\r\nthe floor. Then, seizing a large butcher-knife which chanced to lay\r\nupon the counter, he held it threateningly over B.'s breast, and said\r\nhe would kill him instantly unless he would promise not to report\r\nthe conversation they had had and the difficulty following it to\r\nProvost-Judge Freese. Of course, such noise and confusion brought others\r\ninto the store, and before the promise could be exacted others had\r\nseized and dragged Mr. A. from off his prostrate antagonist. Mr. B. went\r\nfrom the store direct to military headquarters and reported all that had\r\noccurred to Judge Freese. A formal statement, as detailed by Mr. B., was\r\nthen drawn up by the Judge and subscribed and sworn to by Mr. B. It\r\nwas then afternoon, and too late to try the case that day. The Judge,\r\ntherefore, issued an order to the Provost-Mar-shal to arrest Mr. A. at\r\nonce, lock him up in the county jail, and bring him before the court\r\nnext morning at ten o'clock--all of which was done precisely as ordered.\r\nThe arrest of so prominent a man as A. spread throughout the city at\r\nonce. Before sundown there was scarcely a man or a woman in the whole\r\ncity who did not know of it, and General Montgomery was besieged by Mr.\r\nA.'s wife, by his daughters, and by several of his secession friends to\r\norder his release at once. The General, having learned the facts from\r\nhis Adjutant, only replied that \"things must take their course; that the\r\ntrial, and that only, could develop whether Mr. A. was guilty or not,\r\nand, if he was, he could not and would not interfere with the Judge in\r\nthe infliction of a proper punishment, however much he regretted the\r\ndifficulty and sympathized with those who were afflicted by it.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day the court-room was crowded in every part, and promptly at\r\nten o'clock the crier announced the court open for business. After all\r\nthe other cases had been disposed of, that of Mr. A. was called. The\r\nwitnesses, both for the prosecution and for the defence, were examined\r\ncarefully and patiently by the Judge and by the defendant. Then the\r\ndefendant was invited to say whatever he could in his own defence. The\r\ndefendant had a lawyer present to suggest and prompt him, but the lawyer\r\nwould not appear as his formal attorney, for the reason that some time\r\nbefore the Judge had announced that, as that was a United States court,\r\nno lawyer could appear in it, as attorney for another, unless he would\r\ntake, if asked, the oath of allegiance to the United States Government,\r\nand the lawyer present being an avowed secessionist, he well knew that\r\nif he attempted to act as an attorney for his friend A., he would at\r\nonce be tendered the oath of allegiance to take or refuse. He therefore\r\ncontented himself with whispering in his friend's ear, without presuming\r\nto appear as his attorney. The facts, as heretofore stated, were all\r\nproved beyond any possible doubt. Indeed, the defendant himself scarcely\r\nmade a denial of any one of the statements made by Mr. B. He only\r\npleaded, in extenuation, that he had no ill-will towards Mr. B., and\r\nthat whatever was said or done was from an excess of passion for the\r\nmoment, which he could not control; that he greatly regretted all that\r\nhad happened, and would promise the court that the like should never\r\nhappen again. He also produced several witnesses to prove his previous\r\ngood character.\r\n\r\nBefore pronouncing sentence, the Judge took occasion to say that the\r\ncourt had been organized for the special purpose of maintaining the\r\npeace of the city. That, in the absence of all other courts, this was\r\nthe only judicial power to which citizens of Alexandria could look for\r\nthe protection of their lives and their property, and in this respect\r\nit was as much of a protection to the avowed secessionist as to the\r\nUnionist; that the lives and the property of the one or of the other\r\nwere equally under the protection of the court. While, he added, the\r\ncourt could not, and would not, recognize secession as a legal right,\r\nand while no secessionist, as such, could have any legal standing in\r\nthat court, professionally or otherwise, yet the court would, at all\r\ntimes and under all circumstances, use whatever power it possessed to\r\nprotect the lives and property of avowed secessionists. If, then, it\r\nwas thus ready to protect secessionists in their personal and property\r\nrights, certainly it should not be less willing to protect Unionists.\r\nNor would it be less ready to protect Union men so long as he remained\r\nthe Judge of the court. In conclusion, the Judge said that, in\r\nconsideration of Mr. A.'s previous good character, in the absence of all\r\npremeditation, and in consideration of other extenuating circumstances\r\nsurrounding the case, he would make the sentence of this defendant very\r\nlight, but gave fair warning, then and there, to all the residents of\r\nAlexandria, and to such as came within the jurisdiction of the court,\r\nthough not residents of the city, that should there be any further\r\nassaults upon Union men, whether by word or by act, the court would\r\npunish the offender with much greater severity. He then sentenced Mr.\r\nA. to pay a fine of five hundred dollars, and to stand committed to the\r\ncounty jail until the fine was paid. \"Of course,\" the Judge added, \"this\r\ndoes not relieve Mr. A. from the payment of damages to Mr. B. for any\r\ninjuries he may have sustained at the hands of A., and for which he may\r\nchoose to prosecute in an action for damages.\" The court then adjourned,\r\nand Mr. A. was ordered back to the county jail until the fine was paid.\r\n\r\nMr. A. and his friends were very indignant at the sentence; said it\r\nshould never be paid; that he would rot in the jail first; that they\r\nwould appeal to General McClellan, to the President, to the Cabinet, to\r\nCongress; but to all such threats the Judge only replied, when they came\r\nto his ears, \"He shall have all the opportunities he wants for appeal,\r\nbut until the fine is paid, or the judgment set aside by a higher\r\nauthority, he must remain in jail.\" That afternoon and evening every\r\npossible effort was made with General Montgomery and with Judge Freese\r\nto have him released on bail, but without avail. Next day, when the\r\ncourt opened, a friend of Mr. A. was present with five hundred dollars\r\nin silver, which he paid down, and thereupon received an order from the\r\nJudge for Mr. A.'s release from jail. That money, as all other received\r\nby the court for fines, and not used for feeding the prisoners and\r\nother incidental court expenses, was deposited with the United States\r\nTreasurer, at Washington, to await such further action as might be had\r\nin this or in any other case.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of their threats, Mr. A. and his friends at once went\r\nto work to have the fine refunded, and finally, after several months'\r\neffort, succeeded in getting General McClellan to issue an order on\r\nGeneral Montgomery for the refunding of the money. This was done by an\r\norder on the United States Treasurer for the five hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nMr. A. got his money back, but neither he nor any other secessionist of\r\nAlexandria ever again made an assault, with threat to kill, upon a\r\nUnion man; nor did any Union man make a like assault or threat upon a\r\nsecessionist. And, better still, it had the effect to convince every\r\nsecessionist that Judge Freese's court was no respecter of persons; that\r\nwhile it punished such of the poor as violated the law, it was no less\r\nready to punish the rich; and that a Union man in Alexandria would be\r\nprotected by the court with as much vigilance as one could possibly be\r\nin New York or Philadelphia. The refunding of the fine, however, proved\r\nthat General McClellan and his advisers, while pretending great love for\r\nthe Union, were largely in sympathy with the secessionists, and would,\r\nso far as they could, undo anything the Provost-Court might do in\r\npunishing rebels and protecting loyal men. General Montgomery and Judge\r\nFreese, being convinced that such would thenceforth be the policy of\r\nGeneral McClellan and his advisers, tried thereafter to so shape the\r\nproceedings of the court that General McClellan should know as little\r\nabout it, and have as little to do with it, as possible--believing (as\r\nafterwards proved true) that he would not only thwart its proceedings,\r\nbut really abolish the court altogether, whenever he could see that he\r\ncould do so without calling down upon himself and political associates\r\ncondemnation from the administration.\r\n\r\nThus has been stated the how and why of the organization of the\r\nProvost-Court at Alexandria; some of the details of its workings, so far\r\nas appertained to its municipal or police duties; its happy effect upon\r\nthe comparative quiet of the city; and its restraining power on the\r\nbelligerent disposition of some of its citizens. What other powers the\r\ncourt was called upon to exercise, and how it exercised them, will be\r\nreserved for future chapters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0179]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. JUDGE FREESE'S \"BAYONET COURT\" OTHER POWERS, AND HOW\r\nEXERCISED.\r\n\r\n|HARDLY had the Provost-Court at Alexandria been organized before\r\nreporters for Northern journals began to call upon the General and upon\r\nthe Judge for details of its doings, and soon thereafter reports, to a\r\nslight extent, of its operations began to appear in some journals under\r\nthe caption of Judge Freese's \"Bayonet Court\"--the same as placed at\r\nthe head of this chapter. One illustrated paper of New York city had\r\na full-page cut, representing the Judge upon the bench in military\r\nuniform, with his clerk sitting at his right, and his sword laying\r\nupon the desk at his left, with guards standing at attention, each with\r\nmusket and fixed bayonet; with a score or more of prisoners in the dock,\r\nall with woebegone faces; with the Provost-Marshal, in full uniform,\r\nstanding in front of the Judge, awaiting his orders; with lookers-on\r\nall about; and with all the other paraphernalia of a crowded city\r\ncourt-room.\r\n\r\nIt was not for show, by any means, that the Judge rode to the court in\r\nuniform, with loaded revolvers in his holsters; nor was it for show that\r\nhe sat upon the bench in uniform, and had guards about him with loaded\r\nmuskets and fixed bayonets. Almost from the day that the court commenced\r\nits sittings, the secessionists who remained in Alexandria began to\r\nsneer at the court, and some even went so far as to threaten the Judge\r\nwith assassination.\r\n\r\nThese facts were communicated to the Judge by friends, and through\r\nsecret detectives, whom the Provost-Marshal had employed to watch every\r\nmovement in the city. It was, therefore, literally true that the Judge\r\n\"carried his life in his hand\" every moment, and was liable to assault\r\nand attempted assassination every time he rode to the court-room, every\r\ntime he took his seat upon the bench, every time he walked the streets.\r\nBut a still greater reason for this display of power, and of constant\r\nreadiness to meet every emergency, was, that the inhabitants of the\r\ncity might be impressed with the power of the court, and the source\r\nfrom which it derived that power--namely, the military. Without such\r\nimpression of power among the citizens, the orders of the court would\r\nnot have been respected and obeyed, and twice, if not four times,\r\nthe number of guards would have been needed to enforce its orders and\r\nmaintain quiet in the city. To relate a few of the cases which came\r\nbefore the court, under this particular head, will better illustrate the\r\nfacts above stated than any amount of theorizing.\r\n\r\nOne day, the General informed the Judge that, as he was passing along\r\nKing Street, two females, dressed as ladies, overtook and passed him,\r\nand, as they passed, they gathered up their skirts and held them from\r\nhim, and made other signs of derision and contempt, as though he, the\r\nGeneral, was the vilest of all vile creatures. After they had passed, he\r\ninquired of a citizen and learned that they were the wives of two noted\r\nsecessionists, who still remained in the city.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time several officers, and quite a number of the guards,\r\ntold the Judge that, while the men of the city treated them with entire\r\nrespect, the women and the children of secession citizens insulted them\r\nalmost daily--the women by various acts of contempt, and the children\r\nby calling them vile names and throwing stones at them. They had borne,\r\nthey said, these things a long time without seeming to notice them, and\r\nwithout complaint; but the longer and more they forbore, the oftener\r\nand viler became the insults, and they could stand it no longer without\r\nmaking complaint to the court.\r\n\r\nThe Judge thereupon announced in open court, that from thenceforth any\r\nwoman, or any child, who offered an insult, or threw a stone or other\r\nmissile at any officer or soldier upon the public streets, should be\r\npromptly arrested and inquired of as to who was their husband, father,\r\nbrother, or other near male relative. That, if the guard making the\r\narrest was not entirely satisfied as to the truthfulness of the answers\r\nmade, the woman or child should be at once brought to the office of\r\nthe Provost-Marshal or of the Judge, for such further questioning\r\nand disposition as either might deem proper in the case. That, upon\r\nascertaining, without doubt, the name and whereabouts of the husband,\r\nfather, or brother, the woman or child should be dismissed, and the\r\nhusband, father, or brother of the one offending should be immediately\r\narrested, locked up in jail until next day, and then brought before the\r\ncourt for trial and sentence. Or, if the woman arrested proved to be\r\na courtesan, or, if the child had no father or adult brother who could\r\nanswer for him or her, then the woman herself, or the child, should be\r\nlocked up in jail until the next day, and then brought before the court\r\nfor trial and sentence.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours after this order was promulgated from the\r\nbench, it was known to every man, woman, and half-grown child of the\r\ncity. Of course, there were deep mutterings, some cursing, and not a few\r\nthreats, especially against Judge Freese, but the effect was wonderful\r\nand immediate. So wholesome a dread did it produce on the minds of those\r\nwho had been offering such insults, daily, and almost every hour of\r\nthe day, that there was only one instance in which the order had to be\r\nexecuted. That was the case of a child, who called vile names and threw\r\nstones at one of the guards, while at his post. The child was promptly\r\narrested, the name of his father ascertained, the child dismissed, and\r\nthe father at once arrested and locked up until next day. When\r\nbrought before the court, the father proved one of the most pronounced\r\nsecessionists of the city, and, instead of apologizing for the rude\r\nacts of his son, rather approved of what he had done. The Judge tried to\r\nreason with him as to the impropriety of such conduct towards any\r\none, and especially towards a guard, whose duty and business it was\r\nto protect the lives and property of secessionists no less than of\r\nUnionists. But the longer the Judge reasoned, the more obstinate the\r\ndefendant became, until finally the Judge said he would have to make a\r\nslight example in his case, and thereupon sentenced him to ten days\r\nin the county jail--promising that the next person arrested for a like\r\noffence should receive a sentence doubly, if not quadruply, as great.\r\nThe news of the arrest and sentence was speedily known in every house of\r\nthe city, and from thenceforth no other arrest was necessary for a like\r\noffence. The recognized power of the court had done the work, with but\r\none arrest and punishment as an example. But for this recognized power,\r\nat least a hundred arrests would have been needed before the evil could\r\nhave been abated.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the recognition of the power of the court was as\r\nfollows: One of the Episcopal ministers of the city was known to be in\r\nthe habit of omitting the prayer for the President of the United States,\r\nfound in the morning service of the Episcopal prayer-book. The fact\r\nwas told to the Provost-judge, and he was asked by some over-zealous\r\nUnionists to send a note to the minister, requiring him to use the\r\nprayer, or be subject to arrest in case he refused. The Judge declined\r\nto do any such thing--telling his informants, that whether the minister\r\nused that prayer or not was purely a matter of conscience, and that it\r\nwas no part of his business, or the business of his court, to interfere\r\nin matters of conscience; that he fully agreed with Roger Williams in\r\nthe opinion, that the civil or military authorities of a town, city, or\r\nstate, \"have no more right to command over the souls and consciences\r\nof their subjects than the master of a ship has over those of his\r\npassengers or the sailors under him, although he may justly see to the\r\nlabor of the one, and the civil behavior of all in the ship;\" that\r\nso long as the Episcopal minister, and those who attended his church,\r\ndeported themselves as quiet citizens, attending to their own affairs\r\nand not interfering with the affairs of others, no matter what might be\r\ntheir sentiments on religious or political affairs, they were entitled\r\nto protection in their persons and property, and should have it.\r\n\r\nThose who reported the minister and desired his arrest were not at all\r\npleased with Judge Freese's reply, and tried hard to get up some feeling\r\nagainst him among the Union men of the city; but utterly failed in the\r\nattempt. The Judge's Union sentiments were too well known, and had\r\nbeen too often tested, to allow any one who knew him to doubt him for a\r\nmoment. Failing to make any impression against the Judge among the Union\r\nmen of the city, these over-zealous busybodies next tried their hands\r\namong the officers of troops which lay about the city. It chanced, just\r\nat that time, that a regiment of Illinois cavalry was encamped on the\r\noutskirts of the city, whose officers were known to be among the most\r\nviolent abolitionists of the country; men who believed, or pretended to\r\nbelieve, that no man who lived in a slave State had any rights which\r\na Union man was bound to respect--not even the right of conscience.\r\nTo these officers these busybodies told the story about the Episcopal\r\nminister omitting the prayer for the President in the morning service of\r\nthe prayer-book; and also of their having told the whole thing to Judge\r\nFreese, and of his refusing to issue an order to the minister to use the\r\nprayer or be subject to arrest.\r\n\r\nOne of their listeners, the Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment, became\r\nso interested in their story as to volunteer at once to bring the\r\nrecusant minister to speedy justice; nor did he care \"a snap of his\r\nfinger for Judge Freese, or for any other judge.\" Several other officers\r\nof the regiment volunteered to join him, and the plan agreed upon was\r\nthat, on the following Sabbath, they would all attend the Episcopal\r\nservice, and when the Rev. Doctor came to the part where the prayer for\r\nthe President occurs, in the \"morning service,\" if he failed to read\r\nit, the Lieutenant-Colonel would arise in his seat and demand that it be\r\nread, and if the minister refused, then to arrest him, and take him\r\nto the general headquarters. According to appointment, the\r\nLieutenant-Colonel and his friends were at the church on the following\r\nSabbath morning. The congregation was not large, but those\r\npresent seemed to be unusually devout. The sexton had given the\r\nLieutenant-Colonel and his friends seats in about the centre of\r\nthe church. The service was opened in the usual form. The \"general\r\nconfession\" had been repeated, all kneeling; the \"declaration of\r\nabsolution\" had been pronounced; the Lord's prayer said in a clear but\r\nsubdued voice; the \"_Venite Exultemus Domino_\" had been sung by the\r\nchoir; the portion of the Psalms appointed for the day read; the \"_Te\r\nDeum Laudamus_\" sung; the lesson from the New Testament, according to\r\nthe calendar, read; the Apostles' Creed repeated; and the prayers were\r\nbeing read, when, all of a sudden, a stentorian voice was heard, saying,\r\n\"I demand, sir, that you read the prayer for the President of the United\r\nStates.\" Had a cannon-ball burst through the walls of the church and\r\nfallen upon the floor just at that instant, greater surprise would not\r\nhave been created. For a moment the minister stopped in his prayers.\r\nPart of the congregation arose from their knees to their feet and looked\r\nwildly around. Some of the more nervous of the ladies burst into tears.\r\nConfusion worse confounded seemed to pervade the whole congregation. So\r\nsoon as the minister recovered self-possession, he commenced to read\r\nthe prayer \"for the clergy and people,\" when again a voice, louder than\r\nbefore, sounded throughout the church, saying, \"I demand, sir, that\r\nyou read the prayer for the President of the United States.\" Again the\r\nminister stopped, and again confusion prevailed for some moments. When\r\nquiet again prevailed, the minister, without having made any answer\r\nwhatever to the two former requests, commenced to read the prayer for\r\n\"all conditions of men,\" when again the demand to read the prayer for\r\nthe President was repeated in a still louder and more threatening\r\ntone. The minister then arose from his knees, and, looking towards the\r\nLieutenant-Colonel, said, \"My conscience will not allow me, at this\r\ntime, to read that prayer, and the congregation who statedly worship\r\nin this church have requested that I should not read it while the war\r\nbetween the North and the South continues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir, you shall read no others while the war continues, and I now\r\narrest you on the charge of treason,\" said the Lieutenant-Colonel.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, still further increased the astonishment and confusion\r\nof the congregation. For a few moments every one seemed utterly\r\ndumbfounded. Meanwhile the Lieutenant-Colonel and his party left their\r\nseats, advanced near the altar, and told the minister he must accompany\r\nthem to the general headquarters. The minister asked whether he might\r\nnot first go to the vestry-room to lay aside his surplice and gown. The\r\nLieutenant-Colonel answered, \"No; come as you are.\" He then came out\r\nfrom the chancel, joined his arresters, and, in full canonicals, without\r\nhat or cap, marched with them through the streets, several squares, to\r\nthe general headquarters.\r\n\r\nAll this had been done without any knowledge whatever on the part of\r\nGeneral Montgomery or Judge Freese, nor could any two have been more\r\nastonished than they were on seeing the minister and hearing the story\r\nof his arrest. The General was annoyed beyond measure, and, for a\r\ntime, hardly knew what to say or to do. The Judge was decidedly more\r\nself-possessed, but, of course, said nothing. The General, turning to\r\nthe Judge, asked him if he had heard anything of the case before. The\r\nJudge then told the General all that he had known, and all that he had\r\nsaid about it, as has been heretofore detailed. As he, the Judge, had\r\ndone nothing, and had refused to do anything, concerning it, of course\r\nhe had made no report of it to the General, since there was nothing to\r\nreport. The General, turning to the Lieutenant-Colonel and his\r\nparty, said that he entirely agreed in sentiment with his Assistant\r\nAdjutant-General; that there was no reason, not the slightest, for the\r\narrest of this minister; that every officer engaged in the arrest had\r\nmade himself liable to be put in arrest, and tried by court-martial, for\r\ndoing that which he had no right to do as a military man; and that the\r\nminister, upon complaint to the Provost-Judge, might have every one\r\nof them arrested and tried by the Provost-Court for assault and for a\r\ndisturbance of public services. In conclusion, the General discharged\r\nthe minister from arrest and told him that he might go to his own home,\r\nwhen, turning to the cavalry officers, he said, \"The sooner you can get\r\nback to your own quarters, and the closer you remain there hereafter,\r\nthe better will it be for you.\"\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, all this created a great amount of\r\nexcitement on the streets and about the headquarters. The minister in\r\nhis white robes, in charge of several officers in full uniform, and with\r\nthe entire congregation following after, was such a sight as had never\r\nbeen seen in Alexandria before. Everybody--men, women, and children--who\r\nsaw it, followed after, until, when the headquarters were reached, there\r\nwere several hundred persons present. When the General's decision in the\r\ncase became known to the crowd, there was a general approval, as much\r\namong Unionists as among secessionists; but to this there were some\r\nexceptions. The officers and their informers, who had been balked in\r\ntheir mad purposes, felt chagrined and angry, and left the headquarters\r\nwith scowling faces, as though still bent on mischief. The General\r\nand the Judge went to their private quarters, in a building across the\r\nstreet, nearly opposite to the general headquarters. They supposed the\r\ntrouble ended, and that they should hear nothing more of it.\r\n\r\nIn about an hour thereafter, when the General and the Judge had\r\njust risen from their mess-table, an orderly came rushing into their\r\nquarters, to say that a large crowd of cavalry officers, soldiers, and\r\ncitizens were gathered about the Episcopal church, on E Street (the one\r\nin which the minister had been arrested), and that they were threatening\r\nto burn it. The General at once buckled on his sword, and told his\r\nAdjutant to do the same. Both put their revolvers in their belts. The\r\nJudge then told the orderly to hasten to the Provost-Marshal's office,\r\nand tell him to come himself, and bring as many officers and men with\r\nhim as possible to the Episcopal church on E Street,'and there await\r\nfurther orders from the General or himself. The General and the Judge\r\nthen went to the church in all possible haste, and found, as had been\r\ntold them, several hundred soldiers and citizens gathered about it. In\r\na little while after, the Provost-Marshal, with a considerable number\r\nof his guard, appeared on the ground. \"Burn it! burn it! burn it!\" with\r\nintermingling oaths, could be heard every now and then from the mouths\r\nof half-crazed cavalry soldiers. The General and the Judge worked their\r\nway through the crowd, and took their stations directly in front of the\r\nchurch. The Provost-Marshal and his guard also worked their way through\r\nthe crowd to the same place. The General then told the Judge to command\r\nthe peace, in as loud a voice as he could. The Judge did so, and then\r\nadded, \"If any one attempts to set fire to this church, he will be shot\r\ndown at once--and all persons, whether soldiers or citizens, who are\r\nfound within five hundred yards of this church building after thirty\r\nminutes shall have expired, will be arrested by the provost-guard, put\r\nin jail until to-morrow, and then brought before the Provost-Court\r\nfor disturbing the peace and violating the sanctity of the Sabbath.\"\r\nScarcely had the Judge finished his proclamation, before the crowd\r\ncommenced to move off, and before the thirty minutes had expired not a\r\nsoldier or citizen could be seen on the street, save the General and his\r\nparty. Guards were then stationed at every approach to the church,\r\nwith orders that they should be regularly relieved and the stations\r\nmaintained until otherwise ordered.\r\n\r\nThere was no other attempt to set fire to that church, nor to any other\r\nin Alexandria, after that, so long as \"Judge Freese's bayonet court\"\r\ncontinued to have an existence--nor could there have been a more signal\r\ninstance to exemplify the acknowledged power of the court than the one\r\njust related. The cavalry regiment spoken of numbered over one thousand\r\nofficers and men, nearly every one of whom held sentiments much the\r\nsame, if not precisely the same, as the Lieutenant-Colonel. Within a\r\ncircle of a few miles were dozens of other regiments, nearly all of whom\r\nheld similar sentiments. Had that one church been burned on that day,\r\nprobably every other church and two-thirds of all the buildings in the\r\ncity would have been burned during the following thirty days. To prevent\r\nthat church from being burned, there were present not more than fifty\r\nofficers and men, as against at least one thousand of an opposite\r\nsentiment. In physical power the one was as nothing to the other; but,\r\nafter the Judge had finished his announcement, there was not one of the\r\nthousand who stopped for a moment to question the power of which the\r\nJudge was the representative. Had a like power existed, and had a like\r\npower been exercised in other cities of the South occupied by Union\r\ntroops, how many millions upon millions of dollars' worth of property\r\nmight have been saved from the flames!\r\n\r\nWe will give only one other instance under this head, though, if time\r\nand space permitted, it would be easy to give scores.\r\n\r\nMr. D. lived upon one of the most fashionable streets of Alexandria, and\r\nhis family had long been regarded as among the F. F. V.'s of the State.\r\nHe owned lands in other parts of Virginia on which he had a large number\r\nof slaves, and always kept a few at his Alexandria residence to wait\r\nupon his family. For some cause Mr. D. did not leave Alexandria when\r\nother secessionists left, though he took the precaution to send all his\r\nslaves away except two, both females--mother and daughter--the one about\r\nforty, the other about twenty years of age.\r\n\r\nMr. H. lived next door to Mr. D., and though a Northern man by birth,\r\nhad long been a resident and merchant of Alexandria. He had always been\r\nconscientiously opposed to owning slaves, though he had hired them of\r\nothers as family servants ever since his residence in the city. The\r\nfamilies of Messrs. D. and H. had long been on the most friendly terms,\r\nand continued so, notwithstanding the war, up to the very day on which\r\nthe incident occurred which we are now about to relate.\r\n\r\nFor some weeks previous to this day, Mrs. H. had occasionally heard\r\nterrible, unearthly screams next door, and had wondered again and again\r\nwhat on earth it could mean. She had mentioned the fact to her husband,\r\nand he had suggested that it was probably the cry of servants being\r\npunished; but being upon the most friendly terms, as before stated, with\r\ntheir neighbors, they could not, and did not, say a word about it to\r\nothers. Thus matters went on until the day in question. Again Mrs. H.\r\nheard the same fearful, heart-rending cries, and they continued on and\r\non until her very heart grew sick and faint. Just then she heard some\r\none calling her name loudly from the back yard of the next building,\r\nand, stepping to the window, saw the elder of Mrs. D.'s two servants\r\nwringing her hands and crying out:\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, Mrs. H., come quickly! come quickly! They are killing my\r\nchild! they are killing my child!\"\r\n\r\nTears were pouring in a stream from the poor mothers eyes, and it seemed\r\nas though her very heart would break from anguish. Mrs. H. could stand\r\nit no longer, and stepping out on her own back porch, which adjoined\r\nthat of Mrs. D.'s, called out for Mrs. D., and when she appeared, asked\r\nher what was the cause of such awful screaming.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing, nothing,\" answered Mrs. D. \"It's only Jane, whom Mr. D. is\r\npunishing for looking out of the windows at the soldiers as they pass.\r\nI have told her again and again that she should not do it, and yet she\r\nwill persist in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Mrs. H., \"was that all? Surely a young girl like her could\r\nhardly do otherwise than look out of the windows when she heard music\r\nand saw soldiers passing? Did she do nothing else, Mrs. D.?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nothing else,\" answered Mrs. D.; \"but Mr. D. says if she and her\r\nmother are allowed to look out of the windows at the soldiers, they will\r\nsoon be wanting to run away, and therefore we must not allow them to\r\nlook out.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't neglect their work, do they, Mrs. D.?\" asked Mrs. H.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" answered Mrs. D. \"They are both most excellent servants, and\r\nnever neglect their work; but hav-ing these Yankee soldiers in the city\r\nwill, we fear, make them want to run away, and it is only to prevent\r\nthem from getting any such foolish notion in their heads that we have\r\nforbid them to look out at the windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you had to punish them often for disobeying the order?\" asked Mrs.\r\nH.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, not often,\" answered Mrs. D. \"This is only the fifth time, I\r\nthink, that Mr. D. has had to whip Jane since the Yankee soldiers came\r\ninto the city, and her mother has only needed three punishments for\r\nthe same offence. Take them all in all, there are, I think, few better\r\nservants in Alexandria than Jane and Mary.\"\r\n\r\nThis ended the conversation between the two ladies at that time, and\r\nMrs. H. returned to her own parlors a sadder, if not a wiser, woman.\r\nWithin a half hour Mrs. H. heard still louder and more piercing cries,\r\nand the voice this time was plainly that of Jane's mother. Stepping to\r\nand opening one of her back parlor-windows, she could distinctly hear\r\nthe conversation between Mr. D. and Mary, which seemed to come from\r\nthe garret of the house, the back dormer-windows of which chanced to be\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't kill me, Mr. D., don't kill me! I only called Mrs. H. because\r\nI thought you was killing my child--she screamed so terribly! Oh, please\r\ndon't whip me any more this time, please! My back is still sore from the\r\nlast whipping you gave me, and every stroke you now give me seems to cut\r\ninto the flesh like a knife. Oh, please don't whip me any more! please\r\ndon't! please! please!\"\r\n\r\nThese words from Mary's lips Mrs. H. distinguished as plainly as though\r\nthey had been spoken at her side, for both Jane and her mother spoke\r\nmost excellent English, having always been brought up as house servants,\r\nand never having imbibed the habit of using the negro dialect. Indeed,\r\nin their habits and manners they were quite as ladylike as their\r\nmistress, nor could it hardly be otherwise, since both from childhood\r\nhad been made to wait upon ladies of education and refinement, and could\r\nscarcely have failed to imbibe their language and manners. Pathetic as\r\nMary's pleadings were, however, they failed to reach Mr. D.'s heart, for\r\nin a moment after Mrs. H. heard the lash again applied, and this time\r\nMary screamed still louder than before. Again and again she could hear\r\nthe lash descend upon poor Mary's back, and again and again came\r\nfrom her lips the most horrid screechings and the most piteous\r\nmoans. Finally, Mrs. H. could listen no longer, but, returning to her\r\nsitting-room, threw herself upon a lounge and wept as if her very heart\r\nwould break. Then and there she made a most solemn vow to God that she\r\nwould give herself no rest until she had rescued Jane and her mother\r\nfrom their heartless, cruel master, nor would she ever try again to live\r\non terms of friendship, much less of intimacy, with Mr. and Mrs. D.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. H. came home to tea, he observed that his wife had been\r\nweeping, and inquired the cause. She then told him all that she had seen\r\nand heard during the afternoon, and begged of him, for her sake, for\r\nMary and Jane's sake, for God's sake, to go, immediately after tea,\r\nto Judge Freese's quarters and tell him all that had occurred. She was\r\nsure, she said, from what she had heard of his court, that he would not\r\npermit such heartless barbarities to continue in Alexandria. The husband\r\nwas deeply impressed with his wife's story, and still more so by the\r\npathetic appeal which she had made to him in behalf of the two servants,\r\nand promised to do as she requested, notwithstanding his very great\r\nreluctance to break friendship with Mr. and Mrs. D.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after tea, instead of going back to his store he went\r\ndirect to Judge Freese's quarters and told him the whole story, just as\r\nhis wife had told it to him. The Judge listened attentively, and, when\r\nMr. H. had finished, said, in a very quiet but in a very determined way,\r\nthat the case should have his careful and prompt attention. The Judge\r\nthen told Mr. H. to please bring his wife around to headquarters next\r\nmorning, that she might make a formal affidavit to what she had seen\r\nand heard, after receiving which he would direct the Provost-Mar-shal\r\nto arrest Mr. H., and bring him and the two servants before the court at\r\nits next sitting. Next morning early Mr. and Mrs. H. went to the general\r\nheadquarters. The Judge wrote down, as Mrs. H. detailed it, the story as\r\nheretofore told, when Mrs. H. added her signature and made affidavit as\r\nto its truthfulness. The Judge then sent for the Provost-Marshal, and\r\nordered him to arrest Mr. D. and bring him and the two servants, Mary\r\nand Jane, before the court at ten o'clock.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of so prominent a citizen as Mr. D. spread through the city\r\nlike wildfire, and, when the court assembled, the court-room was crowded\r\nin every part. After all the other prisoners present had been discharged\r\nor sentenced, the case of Mr. H. was called. He arose, when his name was\r\ncalled, and said he was there in obedience to the orders of the court,\r\nbut for what cause he knew not, except--if he had understood the marshal\r\naright--for punishing his own slaves, which, according to the laws of\r\nVirginia, he certainly had the right to do. The Judge only replied that\r\nhe (Mr. D.) would probably understand his rights better after the case\r\nhad been tried, and then directed that the trial proceed. Mr. D. asked\r\nif he could be represented by an attorney.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Judge, \"if the attorney will first take the\r\noath of allegiance to the United States Government.\"\r\n\r\nThis the attorney present declined to do, and Mr. D. was obliged to\r\nact as his own attorney. The first witness called was Mary, the\r\nslave-mother. She testified, in response to questions by the court, that\r\nshe had been born the slave of Mrs. D.'s father, and had lived in his\r\nfamily until Mrs. D. was married, when she had been given to Mrs. D. as\r\nher maid or body-servant; that her daughter Jane, then about five years\r\nof age, had been given to Mrs. D. at the same time; that she, Mary,\r\nhad never been married, but when less than twenty years of age had\r\nrepeatedly been ordered to the bedchamber of Mrs. D.'s father; that\r\nJane was none other than the daughter of Mrs. D.'s own father, and\r\nconsequently half-sister to Mrs. D. herself; that she had frequently\r\nasked her former master and her present mistress for the privilege to\r\nlearn to read and write, and, when she had learned herself, that she\r\nmight teach her daughter Jane, but they had always refused, and given as\r\na reason that the laws of Virginia made it a criminal offence to teach\r\na slave to read or write; that both she and her daughter had been\r\ngenerally well treated by Mr. and Mrs. D. until the Union troops came to\r\nAlexandria; that since that time both seemed to have entirely changed in\r\ntheir disposition towards her and her daughter; that nothing they\r\ncould do seemed to please them; that both she and her daughter had been\r\nforbidden to go upon the street at any time or upon any occasion, and\r\nthat finally they had been forbidden to look out of the windows; that\r\nthey had tried to obey even this order, but, on hearing music and the\r\ntramp of passing soldiers, they had sometimes been drawn to the windows\r\nunthinkingly; for this one offence and for no other--for Mrs. D. always\r\nreported them to her husband, and seemed to take pleasure in doing so\r\nwhenever she chanced to catch them at a window--Mr. D. had whipped both\r\nher and her daughter several times most terribly; that he always took\r\nthem to the garret, tied a cord around each wrist, threw the cord over a\r\nbeam and drew them up until their toes just touched the floor, stripped\r\nthem to the waist, and then with a rawhide gave them as many lashes as\r\nhe thought they could stand without fainting; that her own back, and\r\nher daughter's as well, were so raw and sore that they could hardly wear\r\ntheir dresses; that Mrs. D. always encouraged these whippings, and that\r\nneither she nor her husband ever manifested the least sympathy with\r\ntheir subsequent sufferings; that neither she nor her daughter had ever\r\nmade an attempt to escape from bondage, nor had either of them ever\r\nthreatened their master or mistress so to do, notwithstanding all they\r\nhad suffered. She wept frequently while giving in her testimony, and at\r\ntimes almost the entire audience seemed melted to tears. The Judge was\r\nobserved to wipe his eyes frequently, and several times his voice was so\r\nchoked with emotion that he had to hesitate some moments before he could\r\nput the next question. The whole of Mary's evidence had to be drawn\r\nfrom her lips, item by item. She seemed all the while afraid to answer\r\nquestions, and said nothing of her own accord.\r\n\r\nJane was next called. Her evidence entirely accorded with her mother's,\r\nso far as her knowledge extended. Mrs. D., she said, had never found\r\nany fault about her work--only about her looking out of the windows, and\r\nthis she had not meant to do, but did it every time without thinking.\r\nWhen she heard the music of a band, or the tramp of soldiers, some\r\n_irresistible force_ always drew her to the nearest window to look out.\r\nShe could not help it, though her life depended upon it. Both she and\r\nher mother were passionately fond of music, and when their mistress\r\nplayed on the piano in the parlor, they generally managed to leave their\r\nwork long enough to stand and listen, by a door ajar, until the music\r\nended. She did not understand why she and her mother should be so\r\ninfatuated--crazy as she called it--about music. She only knew that it\r\nwas so, and that neither of them could help it.\r\n\r\nMrs. H. was the next witness. She detailed, carefully and succinctly,\r\nwhat she had heard and seen the afternoon before. Told of her long and\r\nagreeable acquaintance with Mr. and Mrs. D., and how much she regretted\r\nthe rupture of those friendly relations. Said she had frequently heard\r\nMrs. D. speak in the highest terms of her two servants, Mary and Jane;\r\nthat several times before that afternoon she had heard strange, unusual\r\nnoises next door, but never until then had she heard them plain enough\r\nto know what they meant. On leaving the witness-stand and resuming her\r\nseat, she burst into a flood of tears, and it was several minutes before\r\nshe could regain her self-possession.\r\n\r\nThe Judge then asked Mr. D. to call any witnesses he had present, or to\r\npresent himself or his wife as a witness, if he thought proper.\r\n\r\nMr. D. replied that he had no witnesses in the case, neither did\r\nhe propose to offer himself nor his wife as a witness; that he\r\nsubstantially admitted all that had been said by the witnesses for the\r\nprosecution, except as to the severity of the punishment inflicted. In\r\nthat, he thought, the witnesses had all exaggerated. In the excitement\r\nattendant upon the punishment of a servant, however, one might strike\r\nharder blows, and more of them, than he intended or knew of at the\r\nmoment; but he certainly never had intended to punish either Mary or\r\nJane to the extent they had described. His defence, he said, was that he\r\nhad done nothing more than the laws of Virginia authorized. That, within\r\nmaiming and death, the law gave to a master the authority to punish a\r\nslave to any extent he pleased. That ever since Federal troops had\r\nbeen in the city he had suspected Mary and Jane to be planning means of\r\nescape, and that it was to make them realize his right to them as their\r\nowner and master, and to keep them in wholesome dread of his authority,\r\nthat he had forbidden them to go upon the streets, to look out at the\r\nwindows, and had occasionally punished them in, as he thought, a very\r\nmild way. Besides, he thought a military court had no right whatever\r\nto interfere with the relations between master and slave, and hoped the\r\ncourt would think proper to dismiss the case. He spoke in a very\r\npompous manner, and took his seat as one who had entirely demolished his\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was an almost death-like silence in the\r\ncourt-room. No one spoke. You could almost have heard a pin drop on the\r\nfloor. The Judge then ordered Mr. D. to stand up to receive the sentence\r\nof the court. Mr. D. stood up. The Judge then proceeded to say, \"Sir:\r\nYou are charged with assault and battery upon these two defenceless\r\nfemales, Mary and Jane. The evidence is clear that you committed such\r\nassault, not once only but several times. Indeed, you yourself admit it.\r\nYour defence is that they are your slaves, and that, according to the\r\nslave code of Virginia, you had the right to punish them to any extent\r\nyou pleased within that of maiming or the taking of life. I am not\r\nfamiliar with the slave code of Virginia, and cannot say of a certainty\r\nthat you represent it wrongfully, but I can say that if such authority\r\nexists upon any statute-book of any State, it is a disgrace to\r\ncivilization, and the sooner it be expunged the better. But, sir, it\r\nmatters not to this court what the laws of Virginia may be upon this or\r\nupon any other subject. This is a United States military court--a court\r\nof necessity, and 'necessity knows no law' is an old maxim--a court\r\nestablished because all other means of justice had fled from this\r\ncity--a court governed by the principles of equity, rather than of\r\nlaw--a court established to protect the lives, the natural rights, and\r\nthe property of every inhabitant of Alexandria, without regard to their\r\npolitical opinions, their religious predilections, their sex, their\r\ncondition in life, or their color--a court which does not, and cannot,\r\nrecognize slavery in any shape or form--a court which now and ever will\r\nprotect the lives, the personal rights, and the property of those called\r\nslaves as readily as of those called masters. While this court possesses\r\nno power to dissolve the relation which the laws of a State have made\r\npossible between master and slave--that power belonging alone to the\r\nPresident of the United States in his capacity as commander-in-chief\r\nof the army and navy--yet it does possess the power, and it is its\r\nimperative duty, to protect the weak against the strong, the slave\r\nagainst undue severity from his or her master or mistress, and\r\nparticularly from inflicting punishment without adequate cause. The\r\nevidence in this case, sir, shows that you had no cause, no reasonable\r\ncause, for inflicting any punishment whatever on either of these\r\nfemales; that they were both uniformly good servants, that your wife\r\ninvariably spoke of them as such until the Union troops came into this\r\ncity, and that then, and not till then, you conceived the idea that they\r\nwould escape from your service if they could, and to counteract such a\r\nthought in their minds you gave them commands contrary to all the laws\r\nof nature; and because they did not, for the reason that they could not,\r\nobey these unnatural commands, you inflicted upon them both a degree\r\nof punishment such as a man would be indictable for if inflicted upon\r\na horse. This you try to excuse by saying that, while in a passion, you\r\nmay have struck them harder and oftener than you intended; the answer\r\nto which is that a man subject to such violent passions, and devoid of\r\nmercy, as you, sir, appear to be, is utterly unfit to have in his power\r\nthose who are unable to defend themselves against brute violence. Those\r\nwhom you abuse, therefore, must be taken from your control; must be\r\nplaced in the hands of those who will treat them kindly, treat them as\r\nhuman beings; and though this temporary taking away may not destroy your\r\nlegal right to their services at some future time, it will, at least,\r\nprotect them from your violence for the present, and it may be that,\r\nbefore this sentence shall have expired, a merciful Providence may\r\ninduce the President to issue a proclamation of universal freedom to all\r\nthe slaves of this land. Meanwhile, this court will use all the power\r\nit possesses to protect them from undue violence from those who call\r\nthemselves their owners; and the court desires to give fair warning now,\r\nso that all may be without excuse hereafter, that from henceforth this\r\ncourt will regard an assault made upon a so-called slave in precisely\r\nthe same light as if made upon a free white person. For every stroke\r\nlaid, upon a slave hereafter, without justifiable cause, the master\r\nwill receive a like number, or other punishment equal thereto, by the\r\nsentence of this court; and the only reason why you, sir, are excused\r\nfrom corporal punishment now, is, that you acted ignorantly--acted, as\r\nyou supposed, under the laws of Virginia, and without knowing the law\r\nor orders of this court upon this subject. Hereafter no one within the\r\njurisdiction of this court can have any such excuse.\r\n\r\n\"The sentence of the court is, that you, Mr. D., immediately after the\r\nadjournment of this court, go with the Provost-Marshal to his office,\r\nand there, over your own hand and seal, with the Provost-Marshal as\r\na witness, execute a permit to Mary and to Jane, each, to leave your\r\nemploy at once, and take with them whatever of clothing or other\r\narticles heretofore recognized as theirs--to engage their services as\r\ndomestics to whomsoever else they please, to receive in their own right\r\nand to use as they please, whatever wages may be agreed upon between\r\nthem and their future employers--to go and come when and wheresoever\r\nthey please, and in no respect whatsoever to be subject to your\r\ndirection or control. And the further judgment of the court is, that\r\nthis sentence shall remain in full force and virtue so long as the war\r\nbetween the North and the South continues.\r\n\r\n\"To you, Mr. Provost-Marshal, the court begs to say that you will not\r\npermit Mr. D. to leave your custody until he has fully executed this\r\norder; and should he refuse, or even hesitate, you will at once lock him\r\nup in the county jail, and report to this court for further orders.\r\n\r\n\"To you, Mr. and Mrs. H., the court begs to return not only its thanks,\r\nbut the thanks of every peace-loving, mercy-loving, freedom-loving\r\ncitizen of this community, for having brought this case before the\r\ncourt, and thereby put a check, if not an entire stop, to an evil\r\nwhich otherwise might have grown to huge proportions; and, as a further\r\nmanifestation of your good hearts, the court requests that you will take\r\nMary and her daughter in your own employ, until such time as a better\r\narrangement can be effected, if that be ever possible.\r\n\r\n\"The court stands adjourned until to-morrow at ten o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Judge was delivering this sentence, perfect silence prevailed;\r\nbut the moment he closed, a buzz of approval ran throughout the\r\ncourt-room, amounting almost to cheers. Mr. D. and his attorney, and\r\nthe few friends immediately about him, looked like so many dark\r\nthunder-clouds in a clear sky; but the contrast only made the sky to\r\nappear the brighter. The crowd dispersed. The sentinels present, at\r\na shoulder-arms, with fixed bayonets, at once formed a front and rear\r\nguard to the Provost-Marshal and his prisoner, and, when on the street,\r\na hollow-square, until they reached the Provost Marshal's office. A\r\npermit, such as the court had directed, was then prepared, to which Mr.\r\nD. put his hand and seal, with the Provost-Marshal as a witness. The\r\nProvost-Marshal then went with Mary and her daughter (Mr. D. still\r\naccompanying and not yet discharged) to Mr. D.'s house, where the two\r\nservants were permitted to gather together their clothing and whatever\r\nelse they claimed as theirs. Mrs. D. was at first disposed to refuse the\r\nservants their clothing, or anything else, and to talk loudly against\r\nthe injustice of the court, etc.; but a word of caution from the\r\nProvost-Marshal, and a beseeching look from her husband, effectually\r\nclosed her lips. When Mary and Jane had got all together, in such\r\nbundle as they could easily carry, the Marshal accompanied them to the\r\nresidence of Mrs. H. and there left them.\r\n\r\nMrs. H. met them in the entry-way, and the moment they saw her, both\r\nservants fell on their knees and begged to kiss her hand, or even the\r\nhem of her garment. They wept and laughed alternately, and it was some\r\ntime before she could get them to arise from their knees and go to the\r\nroom which had been prepared for them. The transition from slavery\r\nto virtual freedom, from constant dread to free volition, to what had\r\nseemed to them a hell to what now seemed to them a heaven, had been so\r\nsudden, that they could scarcely realize it as possible; and, when they\r\nreached the room assigned them, both again fell on their knees, and for\r\na full hour returned thanks to God for his mercy and loving-kindness,\r\nand implored blessings on those who had shown them such unexpected\r\nkindness. Both Mary and her daughter were members of the Methodist\r\nChurch--the former had been so for many years--and both had always led,\r\nso far as was known, consistent Christian lives.\r\n\r\nThe result of the trial was soon in the mouths of everybody, some\r\ncondemning, but a large majority approving. The effect was, that not a\r\nsingle similar case was brought before the court after that. The warning\r\nof the court was so plain and pointed that all who owned slaves in\r\nAlexandria felt that they knew, as well before as after, what punishment\r\nwould follow ill-treatment, and none were ill-treated.\r\n\r\nHad like courts followed the army, or been established in every city\r\nof the South on the day they fell into the hands of Union troops, what\r\nimmense suffering might have been saved; how many rescued from premature\r\ngraves, caused by inhuman treatment; and how many thousands could have\r\nbeen given the blessed boon of freedom, who were run into Texas, thence\r\nto Cuba and Brazil, and thence consigned to a fate worse than death\r\nitself!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0205]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. LOYALTY VERSUS DISLOYALTY. PREJUDICE AND SELF-INTEREST\r\nPROMPTING THE ACTORS.\r\n\r\n|THE definition given by lexicographers to the word loyalty, namely,\r\n\"faithful to the lawful government,\" is so plain that no one can fail\r\nto comprehend it; and yet such were the complications in the late war\r\nbetween the United States and the Confederate States, that to no word\r\ncould a greater variety of significations have been given. The Northern\r\nman claimed that to be loyal one must be faithful to the United States\r\ngovernment, and all who were not so were rebels. The Southern man\r\nclaimed that, after the organization of the Confederate States\r\ngovernment, no man south of \"Mason and Dixon's line\" could be regarded\r\nas loyal who was not in favor of, and faithful to, that government. The\r\nextreme State-rights man claimed that to be loyal one must be faithful\r\nto the government of the State in which he resided, or of which he was\r\na native. Each claimed theirs, and theirs only, to be the \"lawful\"\r\ngovernment, and insisted that to be loyal one must be faithful to it,\r\nand to it alone, and that any lack of fidelity thereto was disloyalty,\r\nand could be nothing.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate by a figure once before used in this volume--that of a\r\ndivorce suit between man and wife--it is easy enough to see how the\r\nchildren, taking the side of the father, might charge those who took the\r\nside of the mother with disloyalty to the family, and how those taking\r\nthe side of the mother might retort by saying that else, the mother was\r\nquite as much a part of the family as the father, and that those who\r\nopposed her were more disloyal to the family than themselves. Thus\r\ncriminations and recriminations might pass between the children of a\r\ndivided household--divided in sentiment, if not yet by law--and if a\r\nthird party were called in as arbitrator, it would be no easy matter for\r\nhim to decide which of the two was right and which wrong. Viewing the\r\nsubject from this stand-point, now that the prejudices and excitements\r\nof the war are over, it is not difficult to understand how President\r\nDavis, General Lee, General Beauregard, General Polk, and their\r\nadherents, regarded themselves quite as loyal as President Lincoln,\r\nGeneral Grant, General Sherman, General Sheridan, and their followers.\r\nEach regarded theirs as the \"lawful government,\" and that only by\r\nadhering to it, by being faithful to it, could one justly claim to be\r\nloyal.\r\n\r\nBut there was a third class in the war, who, while claiming to be\r\nfaithful to one government, were, at heart, in favor of the other; who\r\nonly wore the \"garb of heaven\" that they might the better \"serve the\r\ndevil;\" who were ever ready to make promises to both sides, but who\r\nwere true to neither; men who, like Marlborough, while pretending to be\r\nfaithful to William III., was really plotting to restore James II.\r\nSo well laid were Marlborough's plans, that Macaulay says, \"Had\r\nMarlborough, therefore, after securing the cooperation of some\r\ndistinguished officers, presented himself at the critical moment to\r\nthose regiments which he had led to victory in Flanders and in Ireland,\r\nhad he called on them to rally around him, to protect the Parliament,\r\nand to drive out the aliens (William's friends), there is strong reason\r\nto think that the call would have been obeyed.\"\r\n\r\nWriting of the disloyalty and treachery of many who surrounded the\r\nthrone of William and Mary at that time (1691), Macaulay says: \"Wicked\r\nand base as their conduct was, there was nothing in it surprising. They\r\ndid after their kind. The times were troubled. A thick cloud was upon\r\nthe future. The most sagacious and experienced politician could not\r\nsee with any clearness three months before him. To a man of virtue and\r\nhonor, indeed, this mattered little. His uncertainty as to what the\r\nmorrow would bring forth, might make him anxious, but could not make\r\nhim perfidious. Though left in utter darkness as to what concerned his\r\ninterests, he had the sure guidance of his principles. But, unhappily,\r\nmen of virtue and honor were not numerous among the courtiers of that\r\nage. Whitehall had been, during thirty years, a seminary of every\r\npublic and private vice, and swarmed with low-minded, double-dealing,\r\nself-seeking politicians. The politicians now acted as it was natural\r\nthat men profoundly immoral should act at a crisis of which none could\r\npredict the issue. Some of them might have a slight predilection for\r\nWilliam; others a slight predilection for James; but it was not by any\r\nsuch predilection that the conduct of any of the breed was guided. If\r\nit had seemed certain that William would stand, they would all have been\r\nfor William. If it had seemed certain that James would be restored, they\r\nwould all have been for James. But what was to be done when the chances\r\nappeared to be almost exactly balanced? There were honest men of one\r\nparty who would have answered, 'To stand by the true king and the true\r\nchurch, and, if necessary, die for them like Laud.' There were honest\r\nmen of the other party who would have answered, 'To stand by the\r\nliberties of England and the Protestant religion, and, if necessary, die\r\nfor them like Sidney.' But such consistency was unintelligible to many\r\nof the noble and the powerful. Their object was to be safe in every\r\nevent. They therefore openly took the oath of allegiance to one king,\r\nand secretly plighted their word to the other. They were indefatigable\r\nin obtaining commissions, patents of peerage, pensions, grants of crown\r\nland, under the great seal of William, and they had in their secret\r\ndrawers promises of pardon in the handwriting of James.\"\r\n\r\nNow let the reader turn back and read this extract and the one preceding\r\nit about Marlborough, both from Macaulay's History of England, over\r\nagain, carefully and considerately--putting the name of Abraham Lincoln\r\nin the place of William, wherever it occurs; and the name of Jefferson\r\nDavis in place of James, wherever it occurs, and whatever name he\r\npleases in place of Marlborough's, and he will, we think, be entirely\r\ncompetent to draw his own similitudes, and to understand the causes\r\nof many things heretofore related in this volume, and of some which we\r\npurpose to relate in this chapter.\r\n\r\nAnother class of cases occasionally brought before the Provost-Court, at\r\nAlexandria, related to loyalty. To relate the details of one or two of\r\nthese cases will give to the reader a general conception of the whole.\r\n\r\nMr. E.'s usual residence was in Sussex County, New Jersey, but in some\r\nway, and at some time, he became the owner of a farm not many miles from\r\nAlexandria, Virginia. In throwing up earth-works at Munson's Hill and\r\nat other points, with a view to protect Washington and Alexandria, it so\r\nhappened that Mr. E.'s farm was left about one mile outside of the Union\r\nlines. And it so happened, too, that the Confederates, in establishing\r\ntheir picket-line and temporary works of defence, made them about one\r\nmile the other side of Mr. E.'s farm. This left him literally \"between\r\ntwo fires,\" for the mounted cannon on either side could throw a ball\r\ninto his house at any moment, and squads of cavalry from both sides\r\noccasionally visited his house. Had he continued to look after his\r\nfarming operations, and those only, he would probably not have been\r\nseriously disturbed by either side; but the love of the almighty dollar\r\nso far prevailed over his better judgment and his loyalty, that he\r\nconcluded to try merchandising, in a surreptitious way, at his own\r\nfarm-house. For years previous he had been in the habit of purchasing\r\nthe supplies for his farm in Alexandria, which, with the fact that\r\nhe was a Northern man and was presumed to be, as he professed to be,\r\nentirely loyal to the United States government, made it no trouble for\r\nhim to procure passes in and out of the Union lines, whenever he had\r\noccasion to use them. After awhile it was observed that he passed in\r\nand out of the lines much oftener than he had been in the habit of\r\ndoing when the line was first established, and that he usually drove a\r\ntwo-horse wagon, with a cloth cover over it, and apparently well filled\r\nwithin. It was observed, too, by officers, with their field-glasses,\r\nfrom the works at Munson's Hill, that Confederate cavalry visited Mr.\r\nE.'s house much oftener than they had been in the habit of doing during\r\nthe first months of the war, and how many, both of cavalry and infantry,\r\nvisited his place at night, of course they had no means of knowing. When\r\nUnion cavalry or infantry visited his house, they never saw anything\r\nmore than was usual about farm-houses, and he always welcomed them with\r\nthe utmost cordiality. He regretted, he said, that Confederate soldiers\r\nvisited his house so often. They seemed, he said, to suspicion that he\r\nwas too intensely Union, but he quieted them by saying that while, of\r\ncourse, he was a Union man, and could be nothing else, yet he meant to\r\nbe entirely neutral so long as the war continued, and, while he could do\r\nnothing for them, he would do nothing against them. The peculiarity of\r\nhis situation, between the two lines, made this answer seem entirely\r\nreasonable to the Unionists who visited him, or who questioned him at\r\nany time, and passes continued to be issued to him whenever he applied\r\nfor them.\r\n\r\nThus matters went on for weeks and months, until one day, when he was\r\nabout passing a sentinel's post, the sentinel had the curiosity, not\r\nonly to inquire, but to make a careful examination, of what he had in\r\nhis wagon. He found barrels of sugar, bags of coffee, chests of tea,\r\nsacks of salt, barrels of whiskey, and such other articles as are\r\nusually kept and sold at country stores. The sentinel asked Mr. E. if\r\nhe did not keep a store? Oh, no, he said, he bought these things all for\r\nhis own use and for the use of his servants on the farm, of whom he had\r\na large number. He never sold an ounce of anything to anybody, and kept\r\nhis supplies so concealed that when rebels came to his house, as they\r\ndid sometimes, they never could see anything. On no consideration would\r\nhe sell or give anything to the rebels, and the Union soldiers, of\r\ncourse, never had occasion to buy anything outside of their lines.\r\n\r\nHis manner, as well as his words, still further excited the suspicion of\r\nthe sentinel, and so soon as he was relieved he went to his captain and\r\ntold him all that had occurred. The captain reported the facts to his\r\ncolonel, and received orders from him to instruct the sentinel on that\r\npost that when Mr. E. next attempted to pass out of the lines with\r\na load of groceries to halt him, and bring him and his wagon to the\r\nregimental headquarters. Only a few days elapsed, when Mr. E. again\r\nattempted to pass out with a heavier load than at any time previous.\r\nWhen he showed his pass, as usual, the sentinel replied that his orders\r\nwere to halt him until he could call the corporal of the guard. Mr. E.\r\nprotested against the unnecessary detention, but, as the sentinel would\r\nnot yield, he could do nothing else than wait until the corporal came.\r\nThe corporal informed him that he must turn his team about and accompany\r\nhim to the regimental headquarters. Mr. E. was now more alarmed than\r\never, and tried first to cajole and then to bribe the corporal and the\r\nsentinel to let him pass, but they would not listen to his overtures.\r\nFinding no other way, he turned his team about and accompanied the\r\ncorporal to the regimental headquarters. The colonel examined Mr. E.'s\r\nload and found that it consisted principally of groceries. In reply to\r\nthe question, What he did with them? he answered the colonel, as he\r\nhad before answered the sentinel, that he used them for himself and the\r\nservants on his farm; that he did not sell an ounce to the rebels;\r\nwould not, under any circumstances, etc., etc. The colonel listened\r\nrespectfully to all that Mr. E. said, but did not believe a word of\r\nit. When he had finished, the colonel replied, very calmly but very\r\ndeterminately, that as Mr. E. was a private citizen, and could not,\r\ntherefore, be tried by a court-martial, he must accompany him next\r\nmorning to Alexandria, that all the facts of the case might be laid\r\nbefore the Provost-Judge of that city for such action as he might think\r\nproper. Meanwhile, his team and his goods would be well taken care of,\r\nand he should regard himself as in arrest. Mr. E. protested, but soon\r\nbecame satisfied that he was in the hands of one who could not be\r\ncajoled or trifled with, and that submission was his only course.\r\n\r\nNext morning the colonel, accompanied by Mr. E., the corporal, and the\r\ntwo sentinels--the one who had examined Mr. E.'s load the first time and\r\nthe one who had detained him last--went to Alexandria, reaching there\r\nabout nine o'clock. They went direct to the general, headquarters,\r\nand the colonel at once communicated all the facts to Judge Freese. He\r\nreplied that the provost-court met at ten o'clock, and that so soon as\r\nall other cases had been adjudicated this case should be heard, and that\r\nthe colonel, his prisoner, and his witnesses should be in attendance.\r\n\r\nPromptly at ten o'clock the court opened. A dozen or more cases were\r\nheard and adjudicated, after which the case of Mr. E. was called.\r\nThe first witness--the first sentinel--gave in his testimony just as\r\ndetailed heretofore. The second sentinel and the corporal did the same.\r\nThe colonel then related all that he knew about the case, and in the\r\ncourse of his testimony, said that he had known of Mr. E. ever since\r\nencamped where he then was; that he had frequently heard other officers\r\nspeak of him; that he, with others, had often watched Mr. E.'s house\r\nthrough their field-glasses, and frequently seen rebel officers and\r\nprivates coming and going; that for a week previous Mr. E. had gone\r\nbackwards and forwards through the lines every day or two, usually in a\r\ntwo-horse covered wagon, and dressed as a hard-working farmer; that he\r\nalways had with him a permit from the general commanding to pass in and\r\nout, and that his sentinels had never thought to question his right so\r\nto do until after the one sentinel took the liberty of looking in Mr.\r\nE.'s wagon, and found it filled with boxes and barrels; that since\r\nthen he had talked the matter over with the general and several other\r\nofficers, and all agreed in the opinion that Mr. E. was selling these\r\nsupplies to the enemy; that, thereupon, he had directed the sentinel\r\nupon that post to be instructed to arrest him and bring him to his\r\nheadquarters should he again attempt to pass with a loaded wagon; that\r\nhis wagon, when so arrested, was loaded, as heavily as two horses could\r\nwell draw, with groceries, liquors, etc., and that the team, wagon,\r\ngroceries, and liquors were now in his camp subject to any order the\r\ncourt might make.\r\n\r\nMr. E. was then called upon by the court to present any witnesses he\r\nmight have, or to offer himself as a witness, or to say anything he\r\ncould in his own defence, or all together, if he chose.\r\n\r\nMr. E. replied that he had no witnesses to offer, but, if the court\r\nplease, would like to make a statement. He then repeated about the\r\nsame story he had told the sentinel and the colonel, and added, that in\r\nSussex County, New Jersey, where he was well known, nobody doubted his\r\nloyalty; that his father had, at one time, been a member of Congress\r\nfrom that State, and that he himself would probably have raised a\r\ncompany or a regiment of volunteers when the war commenced had he not\r\nowned this plantation in Virginia and had it to look after. He insisted\r\nupon his loyalty, and strongly urged his immediate release from arrest.\r\n\r\nThe court replied that cases of this kind were exceedingly perplexing at\r\nall times, and he, the Judge, would only be too glad if there were some\r\nother tribunal to which they could be referred; but as there was not, he\r\ncould not do less than hear them, and after hearing, if he found\r\ncause for action, he could not do less than act. \"In this case it was\r\nperfectly plain to the court that, notwithstanding Mr. E.'s denial, he\r\nhad been selling groceries, liquors, etc., to officers and privates of\r\nGeneral Lee's army, and might, therefore, fairly be presumed to have\r\ngiven 'aid and comfort to the enemy.' But the court did not believe\r\nthat it had been done with any such intent. On the contrary, the court\r\nbelieved that it was the love of money--which is said to be the 'root of\r\nall evil'--that had induced the defendant to do just what he had done.\r\nMr. E. is one of the thousands and tens of thousands throughout the\r\nNorth who, while making loud professions of loyalty, are all the while\r\nlooking out for the 'main chance;' whose loyalty goes no deeper than\r\ntheir pockets; whose self-interests so far overbalance any sentiment\r\nof patriotism or loyalty, that they would be Lincoln men, or Davis men,\r\njust as they thought the one or the other was likely to win; who, while\r\nclaiming the protection of one government and getting from it all they\r\ncould, were all the while profuse in promises to the other, and ready\r\nto do for it whatever they could, whereby to put dollars in their\r\nown pockets or honors upon their own heads or shoulders. Nor is this\r\nsentiment confined to farmers and merchants, but the court regrets to\r\nhave to believe it is to be found in the army, in the navy, in the very\r\npresence-chamber of the chief executive, and what is true of the North,\r\nthe court has no doubt is equally true of the South, though not probably\r\nto so great an extent.\r\n\r\n\"In this case the defendant, doubtless, excused himself somewhat on the\r\nground that he was doing it upon his own property, and that he was doing\r\nit as a matter of self-preservation, which, as has been well said, is\r\nthe 'first law of nature.' But while such pleas would be entirely valid\r\nin time of peace, they are not valid in time of war. At such a time, all\r\nprivate interests have to yield to the public good, and what may seem\r\nlike the taking away of natural rights from the one, may be justice,\r\nonly justice, to the many. The defendant, too, though a man of general\r\nintelligence, was probably not aware that he was violating any law,\r\nState or national, in doing what he did.\r\n\r\n\"Viewing the case from all these stand-points, the court has decided\r\nto suspend sentence upon this defendant until he shall be again found\r\nviolating, or not fulfilling, the orders of the court. Meanwhile, the\r\ncourt orders that the goods now in Mr. E's wagon shall be brought back\r\nto Alexandria and returned to the parties from whom they were purchased;\r\nthat, immediately after, whatever other goods may be found upon Mr. E.'s\r\npremises (other than enough to support the servants on the place for one\r\nmonth, if any servants at all be found there) shall be brought to this\r\ncity and returned in like manner; that, after remaining one week longer\r\non his farm, to 'put his house in order,' Mr. E. shall return to his\r\nhome in Sussex County, New Jersey, and remain there until the war\r\ncloses; that, if at any time after one week Mr. E. be found upon his\r\nfarm, or in Alexandria, he be at once rearrested and brought before this\r\ncourt for sentence upon the charges now pending; and, if so brought, the\r\ndefendant may rest assured that he will not have opportunity to give the\r\nenemy any aid and comfort after that.\r\n\r\n\"With you, Colonel W., the court leaves the execution of this order in\r\nall its details, and, while thanking you for what you have already done,\r\nwill thank you still more when you have rendered this additional service\r\nfor the government.\"\r\n\r\nThe court then adjourned, and, of the large number present, there was\r\nprobably not one, save the extremists on either side, who might be\r\ncounted on one's fingers who did not approve of the action of the court\r\nin the case. It need only be added that the orders of the court were\r\ncarried out to the letter; that Mr. E. returned to his home in New\r\nJersey and remained there until the war ended.\r\n\r\nAnother case, of altogether a different character, and yet involving the\r\nsame principle--namely, that of disloyalty to the government by aiding\r\nthe enemy in a surreptitious way--occurred not long after and was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe \"Hutchinson Family,\" who had been giving a series of concerts in\r\nWashington, was invited by some New England regiments, encamped not\r\nfar from Alexandria, to come to their encampments and give a series of\r\nconcerts. The \"Family\" had accepted the invitation and given several\r\nconcerts in pursuance thereof. Of course, their programme was made up\r\nlargely of war lyrics--at that time by far the most popular songs with\r\na Northern audience, and especially with soldiers--among which was that\r\nwonderful, soul-stirring poem by the Quaker poet, John G. Whittier, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n               \"We wait beneath the furnace blast\r\n\r\n                    The pangs of transformation;\r\n\r\n               Not painlessly doth God recast\r\n\r\n                    And mould anew the nation.\r\n\r\n                         Hot burns the fire\r\n\r\n                         Where wrongs expire;\r\n\r\n                         Nor spares the hand\r\n\r\n                         That from the land\r\n\r\n                    Uproots the ancient evil.\r\n\r\n               ''The hand-breadth cloud the sages feared,\r\n\r\n                    Its bloody rain is dropping;\r\n\r\n               The poison-plant the fathers spared\r\n\r\n                    All else is overtopping.\r\n\r\n                         East, West, South, North,\r\n\r\n                         It curses the earth:\r\n\r\n                         All justice dies,\r\n\r\n                         And fraud and lies\r\n\r\n                    Live only in its shadow.\r\n\r\n               \"What gives the wheat-field blades of steel?\r\n\r\n                    What points the rebel cannon?\r\n\r\n               What sets the roaring rabble's heel\r\n\r\n                    On the old star-spangled pennon?\r\n\r\n                         What breaks the oath\r\n\r\n                         Of the men o' the South?\r\n\r\n                         What whets the knife\r\n\r\n                         For the Union's life?--\r\n\r\n                    Hark to the answer: Slavery!\r\n\r\n               \"Then waste no blows on lesser foes,\r\n\r\n                    In strife unworthy freemen;\r\n\r\n               God lifts to-day the veil, and shows\r\n\r\n                    The features of the demon'\r\n\r\n                         O North and South*\r\n\r\n                         Its victims both,\r\n\r\n                         Can ye not cry,\r\n\r\n                         'Let Slavery die!'\r\n\r\n                    And Union find in freedom?\r\n\r\n               \"What though the cast-out spirit tear\r\n\r\n                    The nation in his going?\r\n\r\n               We who have shared the guilt must share\r\n\r\n                    The pang of his o'erthrowing!\r\n\r\n                         Whate'er the loss,\r\n\r\n                         Whate'er the cross,\r\n\r\n                         Shall they complain\r\n\r\n                         Of present pain,\r\n\r\n                    Who trust in God's hereafter?\r\n\r\n               \"For who that leans on his right arm\r\n\r\n                    Was ever yet forsaken?\r\n\r\n               What righteous cause can suffer harm,\r\n\r\n                    If He its part has taken?\r\n\r\n                         Though wild and loud,\r\n\r\n                         And dark the cloud,\r\n\r\n                         Behind its folds\r\n\r\n                         His hand upholds\r\n\r\n                    The calm sky of to-morrow!\r\n\r\n               \"Above the maddening cry for blood,\r\n\r\n                    Above the wild war-drumming,\r\n\r\n               Let Freedom's voice be heard, with good\r\n\r\n                    The evil overcoming.\r\n\r\n                         Give prayer and purse\r\n\r\n                         To stay The Curse,\r\n\r\n                         Whose wrong we share,\r\n\r\n                         Whose shame we bear,\r\n\r\n                    Whose end shall gladden Heaven!\r\n\r\n               \"In vain the bells of war shall ring\r\n\r\n                    Of triumphs and revenges,\r\n\r\n               While still is spared the evil thing\r\n\r\n                    That severs and estranges.\r\n\r\n                         But blest the ear\r\n\r\n                         That yet shall hear\r\n\r\n                         The jubilant bell\r\n\r\n                         That rings the knell\r\n\r\n                    Of Slavery forever!-\r\n\r\n               \"Then let the selfish lip be dumb,\r\n\r\n                    And hushed the breath of sighing;\r\n\r\n               Before the joy of peace must come\r\n\r\n                    The pains of purifying.\r\n\r\n                         God give us grace,\r\n\r\n                         Each in his place\r\n\r\n                         To bear his lot,\r\n\r\n                         And, murmuring not,\r\n\r\n                    Endure, and wait, and labor!\"\r\n\r\nTo this was added another of Whittier's poems, called The Crisis, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n          \"The crisis presses on us; face to face with us it stands,\r\n\r\n          With solemn lips of question, like the Sphinx in Egypt's sands!\r\n\r\n'     This day we fashion Destiny, our web of fate we spin;\r\n\r\n          This day for all hereafter choose we holiness or sin;\r\n\r\n          Even now from starry Gerizim, or Ebal's cloudy crown,\r\n\r\n          We call the dews of blessing, or the bolts of cursing down!\r\n\r\n          \"By all for which the martyrs bore their agony and shame;\r\n\r\n          By all the warning words of truth with which the prophets came;\r\n\r\n'     By the future which awaits us; by all the hopes which cast\r\n\r\n'     Their faint and trembling beams across the blackness of the past,\r\n\r\n'     And in the awful name of Him who for earth's freedom died;\r\n\r\n          O ye people, O my brothers! let us choose the righteous side!\r\n\r\n          \"So shall the Northern pioneer go joyfully on his way,\r\n\r\n          To wed Penobscot's waters to San Francisco's bay;\r\n\r\n          To make the rugged places smooth, and sow the vales with grain,\r\n\r\n'     And bear, with Liberty and Law, the Bible in his train;\r\n\r\n          The mighty West shall bless the East, and sea shall answer sea;\r\n\r\n'     And mountain unto mountain call: Praise God, for we are\r\n\r\n                    free!\"\r\n\r\nThough the regiments to which they sang were made up principally of\r\nanti-slavery men, yet there were a few proslavery men among them, and\r\nthese objected, loudly and vehemently, to introducing or stimulating\r\nanti-slavery sentiments among the soldiers. Especially did they object\r\nto those lines by Whittier. This caused considerable discussion among\r\nboth officers and men, which, through one of the pro-slavery officers,\r\nfinally reached the ears of General McClellan, then in command of the\r\nforces south of the Potomac. The General, for reasons best known to\r\nhimself, thereupon issued an order to the \"Hutchinson Family\" to sing no\r\nmore in the camps, and retire at once.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this order, the \"Family\" left the camps and came to\r\nAlexandria, on their way to Washington. The reason for their leaving the\r\ncamps had reached Alexandria before the coming of themselves, and had\r\nproduced a very strong feeling among the Union men of the city against\r\nGeneral McClellan, and in favor of the Hutchinsons.\r\n\r\nOn reaching there, they were called upon by a number of leading\r\ncitizens, among whom was Hon. Louis McKenzie, afterwards a member of\r\nCongress from that district, and then and always a consistent Union\r\nman. They requested the Hutchinsons to give a concert in the city\r\nbefore leaving, and promised them a large and sympathizing audience. The\r\nHutchinsons were entirely willing to give a concert, provided they\r\ncould be assured of protection; but, having just been ordered by General\r\nMcClellan to leave his command, they feared to sing again south of the\r\nPotomac, unless they had permission, and promise of protection, from\r\nthe local authorities. This the callers promised to procure, and at once\r\nwent to the general headquarters for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThey at first called upon General Montgomery. He, while entirely\r\nsympathizing with their wishes, hesitated about giving such formal\r\npermission, or promising any such protection, for the reason, that,\r\nbeing within General McClellan's command, the General might regard it as\r\na contempt of his order to the Hutchinsons; nevertheless he would impose\r\nno objections of any kind, and recommended the applicants to see Judge\r\nFreese about it. General Montgomery really desired to do all that the\r\ncommittee requested; but, for the reasons above stated, preferred that\r\nJudge Freese should do it, by virtue of his milito-civic authority as\r\njudge of the provost-court.\r\n\r\nThe committee next called upon the Provost-Judge and laid all the facts\r\nbefore him, stating that General Montgomery had suggested that they\r\ncall upon him. They urgently requested Judge Freese to grant the needed\r\npermission, with promise of personal protection. The Judge did not\r\nhesitate a moment to grant both requests. He told the committee that\r\nif the court, backed by the provost-guard, was not strong enough to\r\nprotect peaceable citizens in the giving of a concert, no matter what\r\nwas sung, the sooner the people knew it the better, and he was ready to\r\ntest the matter at once. As to General McClellan's order, he regarded it\r\nas wholly unreasonable, and the army regulations required no officer to\r\nobey an \"unreasonable\" order. While he had a very high regard personally\r\nfor General McClellan, he thought, in this matter, he had given too\r\nmuch heed to the enemies, and too little heed to the friends, of the\r\ngovernment; and, whatever might be the consequences to himself, he\r\nhad no hesitancy in granting the asked-for permission and promise of\r\nprotection, even though General McClellan or his friends should regard\r\nit in direct contumacy of his order to the Hutchinsons. The Judge\r\nfurther said to the committee, that he \"particularly desired _Whittier's\r\ngreat poem to be sung_, nor need the singers hesitate to introduce other\r\nwar lyrics of like character--the more the better.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee then procured one of the churches in which to hold\r\nthe concert, and fixed upon the evening of the next day as the time.\r\nMeanwhile the Provost-Judge directed the Provost-Marshal to double\r\nthe number of guards throughout the city for that night, from eight to\r\ntwelve o'clock, and to have all who were not on post at the church while\r\nthe concert was being held--each with loaded musket and fixed bayonet.\r\n\r\nThe news of the proposed concert spread rapidly through the city, and\r\nwhen the evening and hour arrived, every seat in the church was filled,\r\nwhile hundreds were gathered outside. The windows of the church were\r\nthrown wide open, that the citizens and soldiers outside might the\r\nbetter hear the words and music. The Provost-judge and Provost-Marshal\r\ntook seats near the outer door, and it was observed that while they\r\nseemed to give one ear to the music, the other was given outside, to\r\ncatch the first note of alarm, should any occur. General Montgomery\r\nexpressed a very strong desire to attend the concert, but, out of\r\ncourtesy to General McClellan, his commanding officer, thought he had\r\nbetter not, and therefore stayed away. The concert proceeded without\r\nan iota of disturbance, and gave great pleasure to the many hundreds\r\npresent. Whittier's poem, and several others of like character, were so\r\nencored that the singers were obliged to repeat them. When the concert\r\nhad ended, the Provost-judge and Provost-Marshal, with the guard which\r\nhad been stationed about the church, accompanied the Hutchinsons to\r\ntheir lodgings, and left them in care of trusted friends. They were not\r\ndisturbed through the night, and left next morning for Washington, well\r\npleased with their stop-over at Alexandria.\r\n\r\nThis was not only a triumph over disloyalty, but another instance\r\nstrongly illustrating the restraining power which the provost-court held\r\nin that community. The day preceding the concert, and the day of the\r\nevening on which it was held, there were loud threats not only among\r\navowed secessionists, but among anti-administration men, that the\r\nconcert should not be given. Their own personal and political prejudices\r\nhad been so aroused, backed and stimulated by General McClellan's order,\r\nthat a single spark would have ignited their whole magazine of passion;\r\nand but for the wholesome dread which they had of Judge Freese's\r\n\"Bayonet Court,\" as they were then in the habit of calling it, that\r\nspark would undoubtedly have been applied.\r\n\r\nThe love of money, old political prejudices, and inordinate ambition,\r\nwere the three vile roots from which most of disloyalty sprang during\r\nthe late war, both in the North and in the South; and the illustrations\r\ngiven in this chapter are but two of hundreds which might be given, if\r\nthe proposed limits of this volume would allow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0225]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. DISLOYALTY AS AFFECTING THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY. ERROR AND\r\nPREJUDICE PROMPTING THE ACTORS.\r\n\r\n|ANOTHER class of cases brought before the provost-court at Alexandria\r\nrelated to disloyalty as affecting the property-rights of individuals.\r\nIn the hasty evacuation of the city, when the Union troops were about\r\ncoming in, many had left their carpets, furniture, pianos, bed? and\r\nbedding, cooking utensils, everything, indeed, except the clothing upon\r\ntheir persons and such few things as they could pack in trunks. In\r\nsome cases, persons remaining in Alexandria had been given the keys of\r\nabandoned houses and stores and the goods within left in their charge;\r\nbut in other cases, so great had been the fright and haste of the\r\noccupants, that even this precaution had not been observed. What was\r\ntrue of Alexandria was no less true of the country for several miles\r\naround. As regiment after regiment came over from Washington and\r\nencamped at points from one to five miles west and south of Alexandria,\r\nthey found many farm-houses and gentlemen's residences abandoned, in\r\nwhich had been left the furniture, the pianos, the beds and bedding, and\r\nwhatever else could not be carried away in trunks. Of course, all such\r\nabandoned residences were appropriated for headquarters of divisions,\r\nbrigades, and regiments, so far as they were needed for such purposes;\r\nand, in Alexandria, such residences as were not needed for headquarters\r\nwere quickly applied for (or taken possession of in many cases without\r\nany application to the General commanding) by those who came to the city\r\nfor purposes of trade, and for other purposes.\r\n\r\nThus far everything progressed with what seemed to be a sort of general\r\nconsent; but pretty soon a new class of questions arose, in which there\r\nwas a decided difference of opinion, not only as between Union citizens\r\nand secessionists, but between Union officers and Union soldiers as\r\nwell. These questions arose from an assumed right, upon the part of\r\nsome, to appropriate for their own individual use and profit whatever\r\nhad been abandoned by those who had gone into the Confederate lines,\r\nand who thereby had openly declared themselves not only disloyal, but\r\nhostile, to the United States government.\r\n\r\nThose who assumed such right, attempted to justify their opinions and\r\ntheir acts by referring to the Act of the United States Congress of\r\nAugust, 1861, by which all property used for insurrectionary purposes\r\nwas made liable to confiscation; and they further claimed that it was\r\nbut a fair retaliation to the Act of the Confederate Congress, by which\r\nthe property of all Union men, living within the Confederate lines, was\r\nmade liable to sequestration.\r\n\r\nGeneral Montgomery was among those who believed that, while the army,\r\nas an army, had a right to make use of property abandoned by an enemy,\r\nindividuals, whether as officers, soldiers, or citizens, had no such\r\nright; and among his first acts, after being appointed Military Governor\r\nof Alexandria, was to direct his Assistant Adjutant-General to issue an\r\norder forbidding the use of abandoned property, without permission\r\nfirst had from general headquarters; and when the provost-court was\r\nestablished, he directed Judge Freese to see that that order be in no\r\nway violated or evaded. In every case reported to the Judge, where\r\nan attempt was made to take an article from an abandoned house and\r\nappropriate it to the private use of the taker, whether officer,\r\nsoldier, or citizen, the party was directed to refrain, or, if already\r\ntaken, to return it at once, under the penalty of arrest and punishment.\r\nThis soon became so generally understood in Alexandria that no further\r\nattempt was made to appropriate abandoned property for private use and\r\nprofit there; but, after a time, a case arose from the country, which\r\nrequired the interposition of the court, a trial of the case, and a\r\njudgment; and it is this case which we now propose to relate.\r\n\r\nDr. W. was the assistant surgeon of the Fourth-Volunteers, and as good\r\na man, in every respect, as one often meets. When the government called\r\nfor troops, he was among the first to offer his services, though at\r\nthat time doing a large practice, having a large family to support, and\r\nhaving but little of this world's goods; and when the Fourth regiment\r\nwas organized, the governor of his State appointed him its assistant\r\nsurgeon. This regiment was among the first to reach Washington, and\r\nthe second to establish a camp beyond Alexandria. The colonel of the\r\nregiment was a wide-awake New Englander, an intense anti-slavery man, an\r\nardent admirer and supporter of President Lincoln, one who believed that\r\na secessionist, by becoming disloyal to the government, forfeited all\r\nthe rights he ever possessed, and that this forfeiture extended to\r\nproperty quite as well as to personal rights. Though he was never known\r\nto appropriate any abandoned property to his own private use or profit,\r\nyet he had no scruples of using it himself, and of allowing others\r\nof his regiment to use whatever fell in their way; and if any of his\r\nofficers or soldiers asked to appropriate to their own use anything\r\nwhich they had found, he never answered nay. That he was entirely\r\nconscientious in all this, no one that knew the man doubted for a\r\nmoment, however much they might differ with him in political opinion.\r\nWith a commanding officer holding such decided views, it was not at\r\nall surprising that his lieutenant-colonel, major, assistant-surgeon,\r\nadjutant, and almost, if not quite, every company officer should,\r\nerelong, become as decided as himself upon this question.\r\n\r\nNear the spot on which they fixed for an encampment was a large house,\r\nwhich had been abandoned by its owner and occupant on the morning that\r\nthe Union troops marched into Alexandria. So hasty had been the flight\r\nthat even the breakfast-table, with the dishes upon it, was left\r\nstanding in the centre of the dining-room. Not an article of furniture,\r\nso far as could be seen, had been removed. The house had been well\r\nfurnished, and, among other things, had a piano, about half worn. This\r\nhad doubtless been played upon by daughters of the family as well as by\r\nthe wife, as there were articles lying about the parlor which plainly\r\nindicated recent occupancy by young ladies. The piano stood open when\r\nthe colonel, doctor, and other of his officers first entered the house,\r\nand that most exquisite of all musical compositions, \"Home, Sweet Home,\"\r\nwas open on the music-holder.\r\n\r\nThis house the colonel at once appropriated for the headquarters of his\r\nregiment, and not only he, but his lieutenant-colonel, major, doctor,\r\nand adjutant slept and messed there. They slept in the beds, lounged on\r\nthe sofas, ate from the table, drank from the sideboard, and used nearly\r\neverything about the house except the piano. No one of the officers\r\nplayed, and erelong the piano became one of the neglected, if not one\r\nof the useless, articles about the house. One day, when they were all\r\nlounging in the parlor, the doctor said to the colonel:\r\n\r\n\"What a world of pleasure that piano would give my wife and daughters if\r\nI only had it at my own home!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the colonel, \"why then don't you send it to your own\r\nhome? The owner, or once owner--for I hold, you know, that rebels\r\nforfeit everything, even their lives--is not here to object, and I am\r\nsure I won't.\"\r\n\r\nThis led to a general conversation on the subject among all the officers\r\npresent, the conclusion of which was that the doctor should have the\r\npiano boxed, and sent to his family as soon as he could conveniently.\r\nThis, of course, pleased the doctor greatly, and on the following day he\r\ngot together boards, and a carpenter, had a suitable box made, the piano\r\ncarefully packed, and on the day following sent it to Alexandria, with\r\norders to have it forwarded to his home, in New England, as speedily as\r\npossible. When it was being unloaded at the shipping warehouse, one\r\nof the provost-guard chanced to be present, and inquired of' those who\r\nbrought it where it came from, who sent it, and where it was being sent\r\nto? Those who brought it answered all these questions without hesitancy,\r\nnor did they see any wrong in all that was being done; but the\r\nprovost-guard, knowing what the orders in the city were upon that\r\nsubject, felt it to be his duty to inform the Provost-Marshal of what\r\nhe had seen, and no sooner did the Marshal learn of it, than he informed\r\nthe Provost-judge.\r\n\r\nThe Judge directed the Marshal to go at once to the shipping merchant,\r\nand direct him not to send that box away until further orders from the\r\ncourt. He next directed the Marshal to call that afternoon upon the\r\ndoctor and the colonel, and request their presence at the court-room\r\nnext morning at ten o'clock. Should they decline to attend by request,\r\nto inform him at once, when he would order their arrest; but he much\r\npreferred to have all the facts inquired into without arrests, if it\r\ncould be done as well. The Marshal called upon the colonel and the\r\ndoctor that same afternoon, delivered the Judge's message, and both\r\npromised to be at the courtroom next morning without fail.\r\n\r\nPromptly, as per promise, the colonel, the doctor, and several other\r\nofficers of the regiment were at the courtroom next morning. The\r\ndoctor, it was plain to see, felt a little skary, but the colonel was so\r\nconfident of the justice of his case that he rejoiced in the opportunity\r\nof convincing the Judge that for once, at least, he was in the wrong.\r\nWhen all the other cases before the court had been disposed of, the\r\nJudge turned to the doctor, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Now the court will hear your case.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor at once arose, and said he was there in obedience to the\r\norders of the court, but was not at all aware with what crime he was\r\ncharged.\r\n\r\nThe Judge replied that, as yet, he was not accused of any crime, nor was\r\nhe present by the \"order,\" but rather by the request, of the court: The\r\nJudge then stated all that he had learned concerning the piano, and how\r\nhe had directed the shipping merchant not to send it away until further\r\norders from the court; that he had not issued an order for arrest, for\r\nthe reason that he much preferred to have the whole matter inquired into\r\namicably, as he was under the impression that all done thus far had been\r\nfrom error of judgment rather than from any intent to do wrong; but,\r\nif this course were declined, then there was but one other way\r\nleft--namely, arrest, trial, and judgment, whatever it might be.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and the colonel both replied that they much preferred an\r\namicable hearing of the case, and were ready, whenever it might please\r\nthe court, to state all the facts within their knowledge, either under\r\noath or upon their honors as gentlemen and officers.\r\n\r\nThe Judge expressed his pleasure at this frank manner of meeting the\r\ncase, and told the doctor to proceed, \"upon his honor as a gentleman and\r\nofficer,\" to state all the facts of the case within his knowledge--to\r\nwhich he might add any arguments he pleased by way of justification.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, thus assured and placed entirely at his ease, proceeded,\r\nin a calm, pleasant way, to state just what had occurred, and how it\r\noccurred, since their occupancy of that abandoned house. He particularly\r\ndetailed the conversation that had incidentally occurred between the\r\ncolonel and himself, which led to the packing up and sending away of\r\nthe piano--all of which, he said, could be confirmed by several\r\nofficers then in the courtroom; that he had done nothing secretly or\r\nsurreptitiously, nor had he once dreamed that he was doing a wrong\r\nin anything he had done; but if, in the judgment of the court, it was\r\nwrong, he was quite ready to undo all that he had done, and have the\r\npiano put back exactly where he had found it. As to the matter of\r\njustification, he preferred to leave that in the hands of his colonel,\r\nwho had given, to the subject more thought, and could better express\r\nthose thoughts than himself.\r\n\r\nThe Judge then extended to the colonel the same invitation he had given\r\nthe doctor, and upon the same terms. The colonel thanked the Judge\r\nfor the courtesy, and then proceeded to state the facts exactly as the\r\ndoctor had stated them, and exactly as heretofore given in this chapter.\r\nThis finished, he next entered upon an argument to prove that all that a\r\nman had of personal rights, of property, and even of life, he forfeited\r\nwhen he became disloyal to his government. He laid special stress upon\r\nthe act of sequestration passed by the rebel or Confederate Congress,\r\nand said that the taking of abandoned property by Unionists on this side\r\nof the line was only a fair retaliation for what the rebels were doing\r\nwith the Union people of the South. He also referred to the act of\r\nconfiscation then recently passed by the United States Congress, and\r\ncontended that if the government thought it right to confiscate the\r\nproperty of rebels in a wholesale way, individuals were certainly\r\njustified in doing it in a retail way. The colonel was earnest, at times\r\nquite eloquent, and certainly made the best argument that could possibly\r\nbe made on that side of the question.\r\n\r\nWhen the colonel had finished, the Judge inquired whether any other\r\nperson present desired to make a statement or an argument in the case.\r\nBeing answered in the negative, Judge Freese then proceeded to state his\r\nown views as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The court is obliged, very greatly obliged, both to the doctor and to\r\nthe colonel, for the cordial manner in which they have met the issues\r\nof this case. The court was reasonably satisfied before, but is still\r\nbetter satisfied now, that nothing of wrong was intended in all that had\r\nbeen done; that it was simply an error of judgment, and that none will\r\nbe found more ready than themselves to correct the error so soon as they\r\nare satisfied that it is an error. About the facts of the case there\r\nis no dispute whatever. All the statements agree. The only question,\r\ntherefore, is as to the reason or the law of the case. This court is not\r\nstrictly a law court. It is rather a court of necessity--of a 'necessity\r\nthat knows no law'--or of equity; but in this particular case it might\r\nwell afford to stand upon the law alone, even if there were no equities\r\nin the case to be considered.\r\n\r\n\"The act passed by the United States Congress, on the 6th of August\r\nlast, known as the 'Confiscation Act,' provides that, 'in the present or\r\nany future insurrection, any property given to aid such insurrection, or\r\nused for that purpose with the knowledge and consent of the owner,\r\nshall be subject to seizure and confiscation; that actions for the\r\ncondemnation of such property shall be brought in circuit, district,\r\nor admiralty courts having jurisdiction of the amount, and that the\r\nattorney-general, or any district attorney, may institute proceedings,\r\nwhich in such cases _shall be wholly for the benefit of the United\r\nStates, etc_.' It will be observed how carefully Congress has pointed\r\nout every step of the way by which this act shall be executed; and in\r\norder to avoid any possibility of private peculation, the act says, in\r\nso many words, 'such case shall be wholly--not in part, but wholly--for\r\nthe benefit of the United States.' There is nothing in this act to\r\njustify a private individual in taking so much as the value of a pin\r\nfrom a house abandoned by an avowed enemy, much less from the house of\r\none who still claims the protection of the common laws of his country,\r\nthough in temporary rebellion against the authorities now in power.\r\nThe court, it will be remarked, puts emphasis upon the words _private\r\nindividual_; for it holds that, for purposes of the army, for purposes\r\nof attack and defence, for purposes of sustenance and locomotion, or\r\neven for purposes of comfort, an army, or any regularly organized part\r\nof an army, may seize, hold, and use any property, real or personal,\r\nthat may have belonged to those now in arms against that government.\r\n\r\n\"The colonel has also referred to the act passed by the Confederate\r\nCongress, on the 30th of August last, known as the 'Sequestration Act,'\r\nand thinks the passage of that act justifies Union men in appropriating\r\nto their own use any property that may have been abandoned by the enemy.\r\nThat act was passed about three weeks after the 'Confiscation Act'\r\nby the United States Congress, and shows upon its face that it was\r\naltogether retaliatory. Indeed, one section of the act says this in so\r\nmany words. That section, which really gives the animus of the whole\r\nact, reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'Be it enacted by the Congress of the Confederate States, that all\r\nlands, goods, rights, and credits within these Confederate States owned\r\nby any alien enemy since the 21st of May, 1861, be sequestrated by the\r\nConfederate States of America, and shall be held for the full indemnity\r\nof any citizen and resident of these Confederate States, or other person\r\naiding said Confederate States in the prosecution of the present war,\r\nand for which' he may suffer any loss or injury under the act of the\r\nUnited States to which this act is retaliatory, authorizing the\r\nseizure or confiscation of the property of citizens or residents of\r\nthe Confederate States; and the same shall be seized and disposed of\r\nas provided for in this act' Even this act, emanating from a spirit\r\nof revenge and retaliation, gives no authority, in any part of it, to\r\nprivate individuals to seize for their own use and benefit any property\r\nbelonging to a Union man; but expressly declares in the section just\r\nquoted, that 'the same shall be seized and disposed of as provided for\r\nin this act; and the provisions referred to are quite as stringent\r\nand precise as those in the United States 'Confiscation Act.' heretofore\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\n\"The reason why all governments are thus particular in pointing out the\r\nexact mode by which an enemy's property may be seized and appropriated,\r\nis plain enough, if one will but stop and consider it. Without such\r\nparticularity of procedure, an army going into an enemy's country would\r\nsoon become a rabble or mob--war would soon become rapine--officers\r\nwould soon lose all control of their men, and from thenceforth\r\nplundering, spoliation, and pillage would become the order of the day.\r\nYea, more, it would have the effect to set an army to warring among\r\nthemselves, for each officer and each soldier would want the 'lion's\r\nshare,' and it would only be a question of strength and endurance as to\r\nwhich should have it.\r\n\r\n\"In the matter of the piano now in question, what more right had the\r\ndoctor to it than the major? what more right had the major to it than\r\nany one of the ten captains of the regiment? What more right had any\r\ncaptain to it than any one of the twenty lieutenants? or what more right\r\nhad any lieutenant to it than any one of the one thousand privates? If\r\nit were a question of strength only, the strongest man in the regiment\r\nwould finally gain the prize, even though he had to walk over the dead\r\nbody of every other man in the regiment to gain it. The court thinks\r\nthat even the doctor, though he had his hands full of scalpels, or the\r\ncolonel, though a sword were suspended from every hair of his head,\r\nwould shrink from a contest of this character!\r\n\r\n\"Again, it should be borne in mind that, though property may have been\r\nabandoned temporarily by its owner, he may afterwards repent of\r\nsuch abandonment and reclaim possession. Bouvier, in his admirable\r\n'_Institutes of American Law_,' says: 'Things that have been abandoned\r\nby the owner belong to the first occupant; but if the owner should\r\nrepent of having thrown away or abandoned the thing, _he may retake it\r\nbefore any one else, and he regains his former title_. To entitle the\r\nfinder to such chattels, the former owner, must have wholly abandoned\r\nhis title; if, as in the case of a wreck, he has parted with the\r\npossession on the ground of necessity, or with the evident intention of\r\nresuming it, the property has never been abandoned.'\r\n\r\n\"Again, he says: 'The right of acquiring personal chattels by finding,\r\nis limited to those found upon the surface of the earth. It does not\r\nextend to goods found derelict at sea, though abandoned without hope of\r\nrecovery, nor to goods or money found hidden in the earth, known by the\r\nname of _treasure trove_. In England such goods belong to the crown; in\r\nthis country the title to them perhaps has been seldom questioned in the\r\nhands of the finder, except by the real owner. No title by occupancy\r\ncan in this country be gained in waifs, or stolen goods thrown away or\r\nscattered by a thief in his flight, in order to effect his escape. In\r\nEngland they belong to the King; here this prerogative has never been\r\nadopted by the government against the true owner, and never, perhaps,\r\nput in practice against the finder, though against him there would be a\r\nbetter reason for adopting it. Nor can any title be gained by occupancy\r\nof estrays, or cattle whose owner is unknown, or of wrecks, or such\r\ngoods as after a shipwreck are cast upon the land by the sea, and left\r\nthere, within some county, so as not to belong to the jurisdiction of\r\nthe admiralty, but to the common law.'\r\n\r\n\"Kent in his _Commentaries_ lays down the same principles, and both he\r\nand Bouvier cite a large number of decisions, both English and American\r\ncases, to prove the correctness of the doctrine. Indeed, the principle\r\nhas been so universally adopted, that it would be difficult to find a\r\ncourt, in this or any other civilized country, that would not enforce\r\nit, in every case where the question of abandoned property was brought\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\"This is the first attempt, so far as the court knows, to take a piano\r\nfrom any one of the many abandoned houses in this city and vicinity;\r\nbut frequent attempts have been made to take smaller and less valuable\r\narticles; and, in every instance, where it has come to the knowledge of\r\nthe court, the person making the attempt has been required to return the\r\narticle to the place where found. Nor can the court make any exception\r\nto the rule in this case. If, from the law and reasons stated by the\r\ncourt, the doctor and the colonel have become satisfied that they\r\ncommitted an error in the taking of the piano, and will, without delay,\r\nreturn it to the exact place where they found it, and promise to protect\r\nit from removal or damage hereafter, or so long, at least, as they\r\ncontinue to occupy the house for their headquarters, then no further\r\nsteps need be taken in this case. If they are not so convinced, and\r\ndecline to make any such promise, then the duty of the court will be to\r\norder them both in arrest, and that the piano be taken in charge by the\r\nProvost-Marshal, to await the further orders of the court.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor immediately arose and said he \"desired to extend his most\r\nhearty thanks to the court for the many courtesies which had been\r\nextended towards him, and to add, that the reasonings of the court had\r\nentirely satisfied him of his error; that he would, without one moment\r\nof unnecessary delay, have the piano returned to the house from whence\r\ntaken; and that from thenceforth, and so long as he remained in the\r\narmy, he would use whatever influence he possessed towards preventing\r\nthe taking of abandoned property for individual purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThe colonel then arose and said he was \"reminded of the old maxim,\r\nthat it 'took a bolder man to confess an error than to face a cannon's\r\nmouth,' and while he laid no claim to boldness, he did claim to be able\r\nto do what he believed to be right; and since he had heard the law and\r\nreason of the case, as laid down by the court, he was free to confess\r\nthat he had all along been in error, and that the court was in the\r\nright.\" He had, he said, such \"an utter detestation for disloyalty, that\r\nnothing, he thought, could be too great punishment for a rebel, and he\r\nhad regarded the taking of their property--no matter when, how, or by\r\nwhom--as a part of their just punishment; but the reasoning of the\r\ncourt had made it entirely clear to his mind that, while this could be\r\nproperly done by the government for the general good, it could not\r\nbe properly done by individuals for their private gain.\" He, like the\r\ndoctor, would \"turn a short corner on this subject, and from thenceforth\r\nuse whatever influence he possessed to discourage the taking of\r\nabandoned or captured property for private uses. So long as he retained\r\nhis present headquarters, he would see that nothing was removed from\r\nthe premises, and, so far as it was possible, he would have returned\r\nwhatever had been taken away.\"\r\n\r\nThus ended, pleasantly and satisfactorily, what, at one time, threatened\r\nto be a very ugly case. Had the doctor and colonel chosen to disregard\r\nthe request of the court, and insisted upon their right to send the\r\npiano to the doctor's home, it would have brought on a direct\r\nconflict of authority, necessitated arrests, caused appeals to higher\r\nauthorities, and created confusion generally; but their respect for the\r\ncourt was such as to overcome all these unhappy consequences. On the\r\nafternoon of the same day on which the case was heard, the colonel sent\r\na team to the Provost-Marshal's office; the Marshal went with the driver\r\nto the office of the shipping-merchant and directed the delivery of the\r\npiano; and before sundown of that day, the piano stood in the exact spot\r\nfrom which it had been taken a few days before.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of reason over error and prejudice was complete. From\r\nthenceforth the long-mooted and often discussed question, as to how\r\ndisloyalty affected the rights of property, was settled in and about\r\nAlexandria. There was no further attempt to appropriate abandoned\r\nproperty for private uses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0241]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. A NEW WAY TO PAY OLD DEBTS. JUSTICE SHIFTING THE SCENES AND\r\nPROMPTING THE ACTORS.\r\n\r\n|ANOTHER class of questions which came before the provost-court at\r\nAlexandria excited at the time a large amount of interest; was discussed\r\nto some extent by many of the ablest journals of the country; resulted\r\nin the payment of several old debts--amounting to many thousands of\r\ndollars--in an entirely new way; and as no correct account thereof has\r\never yet appeared in historical form, we purpose in this chapter to\r\nrelate the facts and incidents connected with one or two of the cases.\r\n\r\nThough the causes of the war had been brewing for many, many years;\r\nthough it was, indeed, as Mr. Seward had long before called it, an\r\n\"irrepressible conflict,\" which could only be settled by the sacrifice\r\nof thousands of lives and millions of treasure; though threats, louder,\r\ndeeper, and more ominous, came year after year from Southern States, and\r\nthat, too, from a class of men whom all acknowledged could act as\r\nwell as threaten whenever they chose to put their threats into\r\nexecution,--yet, when the storm did finally burst upon the country, it\r\nseemed to tens of thousands in the North like a clap of thunder from a\r\nclear sky, so wholly were they unprepared for it. Especially was this\r\ntrue among merchants, and still more especially was it true with that\r\nclass of merchants who, for many years previously, had been selling\r\ngoods to Southern merchants, and buying from them cotton, sugar, rice,\r\nand tobacco. These merchants had, of course, a great many pleasant\r\npersonal acquaintances throughout the South; they had often been at\r\ntheir customers' stores, dined with their families, been upon their\r\nplantations, visited their sugar-mills, witnessed the workings of their\r\ncotton-gins, admired the wonderful power of their cotton-presses, heard\r\ntheir negroes sing while picking the cotton, listened in raptures to the\r\npeculiar melodies of the negroes as they stripped the tobacco leaf or\r\nrolled it into fragrant cigars, and though, even at such times and in\r\nsuch places, they had frequently heard Southern merchants and Southern\r\nplanters complain of what they called \"Northern interference with\r\nslavery\" and \"Northern oppression because of tariffs,\" etc., etc., yet\r\nit had never occurred to them as possible that the time would come when\r\nthese same men would try to break loose from the North and set up for\r\nthemselves a separate confederacy.\r\n\r\nSuch had been the confidences between Northern and Southern merchants,\r\nthat, for years previous to the war, the former had been in the habit of\r\nselling the latter goods on a whole year's credit This was necessitated,\r\nin part, from the fact that planters had got behind in their finances,\r\nand were compelled to pledge their next year's crops for their present\r\nyear's supplies; but it was owing much more to the fact that confidence,\r\nvery great confidence, had become established between the Northern and\r\nthe Southern merchant. This confidence, and consequent long credit,\r\nresulted in the fact that, when the war actually commenced, the\r\nmerchants and planters of the South owed the merchants and cotton\r\nfactors of the North the enormous sum of two hundred millions of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nSome part of this debt would probably have been paid had the Southern\r\nmerchant and planter been left to his own free choice; but the\r\ngovernmental and military authorities of the South, with a view to\r\ncripple the North and strengthen themselves, had a law passed so early\r\nin the contest as May 21st, 1861, prohibiting all debtors owing money\r\nto Northern creditors from paying them, and requiring the payment of\r\nthe amount into the Confederate treasury, either in specie or treasury\r\nnotes, for which they were to receive a certificate of the payment\r\nbearing interest and redeemable at the close of the war. How much of\r\nthe sum due the North was ever paid into the Confederate treasury is\r\nnot known, but probably a very small proportion of the whole amount. The\r\nGovernment having virtually repudiated the claim towards the one to whom\r\nthe debt was actually due, it was not unnatural that the merchant should\r\nrepudiate it towards the Government, and when asked the question how\r\nmuch he owed the merchants of New York, Philadelphia, or Boston, his\r\nanswer was, \"Nothing at all,\" nor was the creditor or any one else present\r\nto dispute his answer. In this way at least one hundred and ninety of\r\nthe two hundred millions due the North escaped payment altogether,\r\nwhile even the ten millions which we suppose to have been paid into the\r\nConfederate treasury were absorbed by English capitalists and others\r\nlike the mist of a summer morning.\r\n\r\nAmong the Southern merchants who owed considerable amounts to merchants\r\nand manufacturers of the North were those of Alexandria. What may\r\nhave been the gross amount of their indebtedness to the North is not\r\ndefinitely known, but certainly tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nSoon after the provost-court had been established in Alexandria,\r\nmanufacturers and merchants began to come there to look after debts due\r\nthem from the merchants of that city. Such as had not fled made such\r\nresponse as they could--paying in money if they had it and desired to\r\ncontinue in business, or returning to their creditors so much of their\r\nremaining stock as would satisfy their claims. Only in one instance,\r\nwhere the debtor remained in Alexandria, was the creditor obliged to\r\ncall upon the Provost-Judge for assistance. In that case the debtor\r\npleaded, as an excuse for non-payment, the act of the Confederate\r\nCongress of May 21st, heretofore spoken of. He wanted, he said, to\r\npay--\"of course he wanted to pay; but, being a Southern man, and with\r\nthat act staring him in the face, he did not see how he could.\" The\r\ncreditor called upon Judge Freese and acquainted him with the facts as\r\nabove stated. The Judge sent for the debtor to meet the creditor at his\r\nprivate office. He there told the debtor that \"the excuse he offered\r\nfor nonpayment was no excuse at all--indeed, worse; for, besides being a\r\nmere subterfuge, it was a virtual acknowledgment of his own disloyalty;\r\nthat it mattered not at all what laws the Confederate Congress had\r\npassed or might pass, they could not be recognized by the citizens of\r\nAlexandria so long as it remained in possession of the Union troops, and\r\nthat was likely to be so long as the war continued; and that if he had\r\nthe means to pay his creditor, the sooner he did it the better!\" Within\r\nan hour the debt was paid, and it was the last of that kind of cases in\r\nwhich the Judge had to interfere, as within twenty-four hours the facts\r\nof this case were known to every merchant of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nBut there was another class of cases which came thick and fast, and for\r\nawhile gave the court a vast amount of trouble. To relate the origin,\r\nthe incidents, and the results of a few of these will be the object of\r\nthis chapter. The first was as follows:\r\n\r\nMr. S. was an old resident of Alexandria, and for several years before\r\nthe war had been keeping an agricultural and hardware store in that\r\ncity. He was regarded by his neighbors as a highly honorable merchant,\r\nand being a man of considerable means, had always met his payments\r\npromptly. He was a Virginian by birth, and when the contest began\r\nbetween the North and the South, promptly took sides with the South.\r\nIndeed, he had advocated secession so strongly and so loudly that he\r\nfeared he would be arrested for disloyalty if he remained in Alexandria,\r\nso, when the Union troops were about coming in and the Confederate\r\ntroops about going out, he retired with them. He did this, however, so\r\nunexpectedly, and in so much of a hurry, that he had no time to make a\r\nformal sale and transfer of his stock of goods to any one; but, on the\r\nmorning that he left, he handed the key of his store to a neighbor and\r\ntold him to look after his affairs until he returned, or until he could\r\nmake some other arrangement. The neighbor did as requested, kept the\r\nstore open, sold whatever he could for ready cash, and transmitted the\r\nmoney to Mr. S. whenever he had opportunity.\r\n\r\nThus matters were going on when a Philadelphia merchant, to whom Mr. S.\r\nwas indebted, went to Alexandria to look after his claim. He had written\r\nseveral letters, addressed to Mr. S., Alexandria, Va., but could get no\r\nreply, and began to suspect that he might have left the city, though he\r\nhad no positive information to that effect until he reached there. He\r\ninquired of the man whom he found in the store of the whereabouts of Mr.\r\nS., and was told that he had left, on the coming in of the Union troops;\r\nbut where he had gone, or exactly where he then was, the man in the\r\nstore pretended not to know. The Philadelphian said he had a claim, past\r\ndue, of several hundred dollars, against Mr. S., and would like to\r\nhave it settled in some way. The agent replied that he had not\r\nbeen authorized by Mr. S. to pay any debts, and, besides that, the\r\nConfederate Congress had passed a law requiring all men who owed debts\r\nto Northern merchants to pay the amount into the Confederate treasury,\r\nand it was possible that Mr. S. might have already paid off the claim by\r\npaying it into the Southern treasury.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphian replied that he did not recognize any such payment as\r\ncancelling his claim; and, as he observed some of the very goods he had\r\nsold Mr. S. then in the store-room, he thought the agent ought to be\r\nwilling to return him those goods, which he would take in payment at\r\ncost price, and then to pay him the balance in money. The agent said\r\nhe could not, for one moment, entertain any such proposition. That, the\r\ngoods having been placed in his care by Mr. S. when he left, he regarded\r\nhimself as the owner of them, and could not think of returning any part\r\nof them to Mr. S.'s creditors, nor of disposing of them in any other\r\nway, except for cash in hand. The Philadelphian tried to convince the\r\nagent of the justice and reasonableness of the proposition he had made,\r\nand finally offered to accept of goods, at cost price, for the whole\r\nof his claim; but the longer he reasoned, the more obstinate grew the\r\nagent, until at last the agent said he could not, and would not,\r\ndo anything about it; that the debt was not his own anyhow; that it\r\npossibly had been paid into the Confederate treasury, and, if so, was\r\nlegally paid; and that it was only a waste of time and breath to talk to\r\nhim any more about it.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphian, having read something in the newspapers about Judge\r\nFreese's \"Bayonet Court,\" concluded to seek the Judge and see if there\r\nwas not some way by which his claim might be enforced. Going to his\r\noffice, he told the Judge the whole case, and begged that he would aid\r\nhim in some way to secure his claim.\r\n\r\nThe Judge replied that the provost-court had been established only\r\nwith a view of preserving the peace of the city, and the personal\r\nand property rights of individuals, and not with any view whatever of\r\ncollecting claims; that if its jurisdiction was enlarged to include\r\ncivil as well as criminal cases, the business might prove larger than\r\nany one court could do, and thereby defeat wholly, or in part, its\r\noriginal intention; that whatever he could do by moral suasion to induce\r\nMr. S.'s agent to pay his claim, he would most cheerfully do, but as to\r\nopening the court for the hearing and adjudication of such cases, it was\r\nmore than he could at present consent to do. He would, he added,\r\nsend for Mr. S.'s agent and see what, if anything, could be done.\r\nHe accordingly sent an orderly to request the agent to come to the\r\nheadquarters immediately.\r\n\r\nWhen the agent made his appearance, the Judge told him why he had been\r\nsent for, and strongly urged him to make some equitable arrangement\r\nwhereby to settle the claim of the Philadelphia merchant. The agent made\r\nabout the same reply to the Judge that he had made to the Philadelphian,\r\nto all of which the Judge listened attentively without uttering a word.\r\nWhen he had entirely finished, the Judge said he would like to ask him\r\na few questions to which he would like direct answers. To this the agent\r\nassented.\r\n\r\n\"First, then,\" said the Judge, \"did Mr. S., before leaving, execute\r\nto you a bill of sale, or any other paper, by which to make the goods\r\nyours?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the agent, \"he did not; but when about to leave he handed\r\nme the key of his store, and told me to take care of the goods until his\r\nreturn, or until he might make some other arrangement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Judge, \"the goods are no more legally yours than they\r\nare mine, and you are simply acting as guard over them. Have you not\r\nbeen selling some of the goods?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the agent; \"I understood the care to include the right\r\nto sell, and have accordingly sold of the goods whenever I had\r\nopportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you done with the money received from sales?\" said the Judge.\r\n\r\nThe agent became confused, hesitated, stammered, and finally got out\r\nthat he had \"sent some of it to Mr. S., and still had some of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is your intention, I suppose.\" said the Judge, \"to send it all\r\nto him so soon as you shall have sold all the goods?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" said the agent; \"it would all belong to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think that no part of it would belong to his creditors; but\r\nthat all should go to him?\" said the Judge.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, about so,\" said the agent; \"for if he has paid his debts\r\nonce into the Confederate treasury, as I suppose he has or will, it\r\nwould seem unreasonable that he should pay them again to such Northern\r\nmerchants as he may happen to owe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you not aware,\" said the Judge, \"that any law passed by the\r\nConfederate Congress is a nullity in Alexandria, and can have no\r\npossible effect on the question of contracts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, no, yes; but Alexandria, you know, is in Virginia, and Mr.\r\nS., you know, is at Richmond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! at Richmond, is he? Only a little while ago you told this creditor\r\nthat you did not know where he was, and I understood you to say the same\r\nin your story to me, and now, all at once, when you seek to screen\r\nhim from justice and from Northern laws, you recollect that he is at\r\nRichmond. Very well, sir, then to the Richmond authorities he must look\r\nfor protection, while this Northern merchant has no protection save\r\nthrough our provost-court, and though I told him, previous to your\r\ncoming here, that the court could not take up such cases, yet now that\r\nI have heard your story, and see that by allowing you to retain and\r\nsell the goods will virtually be to give 'aid and comfort to the enemy,'\r\nwhile to interfere in behalf of this merchant will be to weaken the\r\nenemy, by cutting off some of his resources, besides doing an act of\r\nsimple justice--in view, I say, of all these facts, I am now resolved to\r\ntake up this case, and the first step in the case will be for the court\r\nto take possession of the store-room and all of its contents until the\r\ncase can be heard and adjudicated. You will at once hand the key of the\r\nstore-room, after closing it carefully, to the Provost-Marshal. He will\r\nplace a guard over the premises to see that nothing is taken away or\r\ndisturbed until the case is heard and decided, and to-morrow morning,\r\nat ten o'clock, you will be at the court with any books, papers, or\r\nwitnesses you may have, when the case will be heard.\"\r\n\r\nHad a bombshell fallen and burst at the feet of the agent, he could not\r\nhave been more surprised. For some moments he seemed so dumbfounded\r\nthat he could not, or did not, utter a word. Then, slowly arising to his\r\nfeet, he was about to leave, when the Judge told him to again be seated,\r\nto await the coming of the Provost-Marshal, for whom he had sent.\r\n\r\nWhen the Marshal made his appearance, the Judge directed him to\r\naccompany the agent to the store-room, to see that every window and\r\nevery door was securely closed and fastened, to then place a guard both\r\nat the front and at the rear of the premises, and to see that they were\r\nregularly relieved and replaced, the same as other guards of the city,\r\nuntil further orders from the court, and meanwhile to retain the key of\r\nthe store-room in his own possession, and see that nothing whatever was\r\nremoved from the premises.\r\n\r\nThe agent then left with the Marshal, and all was done precisely as\r\ndirected. That the Philadelphia merchant was pleased with the turn\r\nthings had taken need hardly be added.\r\n\r\nNext day, at ten o'clock, the Philadelphia merchant, the agent, and\r\nabout a dozen friends of the agent, including the secession lawyer\r\nheretofore spoken of, appeared at the court-room. When all the police\r\ncases had been disposed of, the court said it was now ready to hear the\r\ncivil case, in which, upon the court record, Mr. G., of Philadelphia,\r\nwas named as plaintiff, and Mr. T., of Alexandria, as agent for Mr. S.,\r\nwas named as defendant.\r\n\r\nMr. G. arose, and said that he had no attorney to represent him in\r\nthis case, and that he was himself wholly unacquainted with court\r\nproceedings, and did not know even how to take the first step. He begged\r\nto inquire of the court what was needed to be done upon his part?\r\n\r\nThe Judge replied that the first thing required of him was to prove his\r\nclaim against Mr. S., beyond any reasonable doubt. To do this he must\r\nproduce his original books of entry, and prove by the one who sold\r\nthe goods, or by some one who knows of their delivery, that the goods\r\ncharged in the original entry were actually sold and delivered to Mr S.,\r\nand then you or some one else must, under oath or affirmation, satisfy\r\nthe court that they have never been paid for.\r\n\r\nMr. G. replied that all this could be done if a few days' time could be\r\ngiven him; that he had not brought his account-books with him, nor was\r\nthe clerk who sold the goods present. He could himself at once make\r\naffidavit as to the correctness of the account, and to the fact that it\r\nhad never been paid, but beyond this he could not go until he could send\r\nto Philadelphia for his books and clerk; that he could have his books\r\nand clerk present if the court would adjourn the case for two days.\r\n\r\nThe court said that, under the circumstances, it would be entirely\r\nproper to grant the adjournment asked for by the plaintiff; but, to\r\njustify the Marshal in longer retaining the goods, the court would\r\nrequire Mr. G. to make a written state-of-demand against Mr. S., setting\r\nforth the nature and amount of his claim, and the fact that the claim\r\nhad never been paid in any way, and was now justly due and owing to him.\r\nTo this he must set his name, and then make affidavit that the statement\r\nis true. Upon this, as _prima facie_ evidence of the claim, the court\r\nwill direct the Marshal to continue possession of the goods until the\r\ncase can be heard. The court asked the defendant if he had any objection\r\nto an adjournment, or to the course of procedure proposed, to which he\r\nanswered that he had not; whereupon the court adjourned the case for two\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nTwo days after, the parties again appeared before the court The\r\nplaintiff now produced his original books of entry, and both he and his\r\nclerk swore that they were such. The clerk swore that he had sold to,\r\nand forwarded to, Mr. S. every article charged upon the books. Mr. G.\r\nswore that he had seen many of the articles in Mr. S.'s store-room on\r\nthe day he first arrived in Alexandria; that the account was due and\r\noverdue; and that no part thereof had been paid.\r\n\r\nMr. T. was then called upon by the court to make any defence he thought\r\nproper. He replied that he had no defence to make, further than the\r\nJudge already knew, that every fact and every argument within his reach\r\nhad been stated and made at the interview had at the headquarters. He\r\nadded, that the attorney which Mr. S. had been in the habit of employing\r\nbefore he left Alexandria was in the court-room, and that he had tried\r\nto induce him to take charge of and conduct the case, but this he had\r\ndeclined to do, as he was not prepared to take the oath of allegiance to\r\nthe United States government, required by the court from all attorneys\r\nwho would practise in it He had not had opportunity to confer with Mr.\r\nS., by letter or otherwise, since these proceedings commenced, nor did\r\nhe know that he should have for a long time to come, else he might ask\r\nfor an adjournment of the case until he could hear from him. Under all\r\nthe circumstances he saw no other way than to submit to the judgment of\r\nthe court, whatever it might be.\r\n\r\nAll parties having rested, Judge Freese said he \"would have much\r\npreferred not to take up this class of cases, but under all the\r\ncircumstances it was a responsibility he could not avoid. The plaintiff\r\ncame to this city seeking his debtor and the recovery of a just claim.\r\nUpon inquiry he learns that his debtor has fled and is now within the\r\nenemy's lines, yea, even under the very wings and protection of the\r\nauthorities at Richmond. He cannot pursue him thither, nor can he issue,\r\nor have issued, any process by which to compel his return. The goods\r\nhe sold him, however, with a large amount of other goods, he finds in\r\nAlexandria, in possession of a man who claims to be Mr. S.'s agent for\r\nthe care and sale of his goods, but not his agent for the payment of his\r\ndebts. Indeed, this so-called agent--who, in a legal sense, is no agent\r\nat all, and has no more claim upon the goods than any other gentleman\r\nin this court-room--even goes so far as to say that 'Mr. S. may not owe\r\nthis plaintiff anything now, however justly he may have, owed him a few\r\nmonths ago, for the reason that the Confederate Congress has since then\r\npassed a law sequestrating all debts due from the South to the North; in\r\nreply to which the court told him, and may now repeat for the benefit\r\nof this whole community, that it matters not what laws may or may not be\r\npassed by the Confederate Congress, they can in no way affect the people\r\nof this city so long as it remains in charge of Union troops, and that\r\nis likely to be so long as the war continues. Had there been any other\r\ntribunal in this city to which this class of cases could have been\r\nreferred, this court would not have taken them up; but, since the State\r\nand county courts of Alexandria had virtually run away when the people\r\nran away, the simple question to decide was, whether this court should\r\ntake up this class of cases, in addition to such as it had already\r\ntaken up, or allow Mr. G., and others like him, to be without any\r\nremedy whatever? Viewed from this standpoint, it became a duty, a\r\nresponsibility, and one which the court could not avoid, without\r\ninflicting great injury upon others and consequent blame upon itself.\r\n\r\n\"With regard to the facts in the present case there is not a shadow of\r\ndoubt in the mind of the court, nor is it at all probable that Mr. S.\r\nwould deny any one of them, if here himself. He unquestionably owes this\r\ndebt to Mr. G.; the goods in the store-room which he lately occupied\r\nunquestionably belong to Mr. S.; Mr. T. has no claim upon them whatever,\r\nnot even the claim of an agent or clerk, in a legal sense; he has\r\nassumed authority so far as it suited his own convenience, but declines\r\nto assume it when it does not suit his convenience or his secession\r\nnotions; to sell the goods, pocket the money, and transmit all or part\r\nof it to Richmond was, to his mind, all right--to pay Mr. S.'s creditors\r\nwith the money, or with a portion of the goods, was, to his mind, all\r\nwrong. In all this the court differs with him entirely, and holds that\r\nso much of the goods as have not been paid for belong to his creditors\r\nrather than to him, and that the agent, so soon as he became satisfied\r\nof the correctness of the claim, should not have hesitated a moment\r\nabout returning to Mr. G. so much of his goods as remained in store, and\r\npaid him the balance in money or in other goods. It is a principle of\r\nlaw that a consideration of some kind must pass from buyer to seller\r\nbefore legal possession can be claimed by the buyer. Hence you see\r\nin contracts the words, 'For and in consideration of one dollar, the\r\nreceipt of which is hereby acknowledged,' etc.; whereas no dollar, or\r\nany other sum, has passed between the parties, and yet these words or\r\ntheir equivalent are necessary in order to make the contract legal. It\r\nmay be answered that the taking of a note, or a consent to a charge\r\nupon books of regular entry, are regarded as a 'consideration' in the\r\nmercantile world, and this may be so; but certainly, if the purchaser\r\nafterwards repudiates his note or book account, or if the government\r\nunder which he has placed himself repudiates the debt for him, then\r\nthere is not, nor has there been, any 'consideration,' and the seller,\r\nin law as well as in equity, has a right to the goods.\r\n\r\n\"Again: in the eye of the law, Mr. S. would be regarded as an absconded\r\ndebtor, and had there been a court of common pleas in this city, Mr. G.\r\ncould have had an attachment issued, and the goods of Mr. S. seized\r\nand held by virtue of that attachment. True, Mr. S. has not left the\r\nState--and in most of the States the law requires that the party shall\r\nhave left the State before an attachment can issue--but, under the\r\npresent state of things, Mr. S. has as virtually left the State, or at\r\nleast the jurisdiction of a court in Alexandria, as though he had gone\r\nto England. I certainly should have taken this view of the case had\r\nI been presiding in a common pleas court, and this case been brought\r\nbefore me, and I doubt not any other judge would have done the same. In\r\nlaw, as in other things, 'circumstances alter cases,' and it is the\r\nduty of a court always to consider circumstances, and to give such\r\nconstruction to law as will best promote the ends of justice.\r\n\r\n\"Nor does this principle at all conflict with another, so often and so\r\nstrongly insisted upon by this court, namely, that abandoned property\r\nshall not be taken for private gain. Had any party, having no just claim\r\nupon Mr S., attempted to take for his own use and profit any of the\r\ngoods left by Mr. S. in that store-room, this court, if informed of the\r\nattempt, would have used all its power to prevent such taking, and, if\r\nalready taken, the court would have made the party return the goods\r\nto the place from whence taken. But the case in hand is altogether\r\ndifferent. Here the party has a claim, a just claim, indeed an implied,\r\nif not a legal ownership in the goods which he seeks to take, and,\r\ninstead of preventing, it becomes the duty of the court to assist in the\r\ntransfer.\r\n\r\n\"But, again, it may be said by some--and is probably thought, if not\r\nsaid, by this defendant and his secession friends--that, as this is\r\na military court, it has not, and should not presume to have, any\r\njurisdiction in civil matters, or matters touching the transfer of\r\nproperty, real or personal. As heretofore stated, this court surely\r\nwould not have assumed any such jurisdiction, had there been a circuit,\r\ndistrict, common pleas, or chancery court in this city, to which cases\r\nof this kind could have been referred; but, as all present well know,\r\nthere has been no such court here since the Confederate troops left, and\r\nwith them all the officers of State and county courts. Hence, as before\r\nstated, it was this court or nothing. But there is a view, and a very\r\nstrong view, of the case, in which it would become not only the right,\r\nbut the duty, of this court, or of any military court, to interfere in\r\ncases of this kind, namely, where it became known that property, or the\r\nproceeds from sales of property, was being surreptitiously transferred\r\nfrom the hands of friends to the hands of enemies. The third section\r\nof the third article of the Constitution of the United States defines\r\ntreason to be the 'levying of war against the United States, or in\r\nadhering to their enemies, _giving them aid and comfort_.' Now, if the\r\ntransfer of goods, or the transfer of money from the sale of goods,\r\ngives to an enemy 'aid and comfort,' then, surely, it is the business\r\nof a military court to stop it, and the evidence in this case shows this\r\nto have been done. The agent admits that he has sold the goods for\r\ncash in hand whenever he had opportunity, and that, as he has had\r\nopportunity, he has transmitted the money to Mr. S.; nor does he, or any\r\nother of his friends, pretend to deny that Mr. S. is an avowed enemy to\r\nthe government which this court, in part, represents.\r\n\r\n\"So suddenly and so unexpectedly has this new class of cases come\r\nupon the court, that no time has been had to consult with the\r\nAttorney-General or other legal gentlemen, or even to consult legal\r\nauthorities with regard to the matter; but the court has no doubt that\r\nthe principles laid down in every law text-book, including Blackstone,\r\nKent, Parsons, Greenleaf, Chitty, Cockburn, Stephen, and others, will\r\nfully justify every position thus far taken by this court, even though\r\nthere be not a single precedent to cite. While this court would much\r\nprefer to follow than to make precedents, yet it has no hesitancy in\r\nmaking them when the circumstances of a case call for, or justify,\r\nsuch action. At the earliest possible moment the court will draw up and\r\npromulgate a course of proceedings in cases of this character. Until\r\nthen the form of proceedings and the manner of adjudication will have to\r\ndepend altogether upon the facts in each particular case.\r\n\r\n\"The judgment of the court in this case is, that the plaintiff choose\r\none man, the defendant another, and the two, a third, or, if there\r\nbe any disagreement about the choice of a third man, that the\r\nProvost-Marshal act as such third man. That the three thus selected\r\nconstitute a commission, authorized and directed by this court to set\r\napart, of the goods left by Mr. S., so much as will pay in full, at\r\na fair valuation, the claim due from Mr. S. to Mr. G.; that this\r\ncommission shall fix the price of every article transferred to Mr. G.,\r\nand, where there is a disagreement as to value between the two, the\r\njudgment of the third shall be final; that the gross amount of goods to\r\nbe transferred shall include the amount of Mr. G.'s claim, the estimated\r\ncost of transportation from this city to Philadelphia, and five dollars\r\nto each of the commissioners for the services they will render; that the\r\ncommissioners make a written report to this court so soon as the goods\r\nhave been selected and set apart; but that the goods be not taken from\r\nthe store-room, until the report of the commissioners be approved\r\nby this court, and an order for their shipment obtained. The\r\nProvost-Marshal will see to the execution of this order in all its\r\nparts.\"\r\n\r\nThe court then adjourned. On the afternoon of the same day each party\r\nchose their man, and the Provost-Marshal consented to act as the third.\r\nNext morning the three went to the store-room, accompanied by Mr. G. and\r\nMr. T., and before noon had a sufficient amount of goods selected and\r\nset apart to cover Mr. G.'s claim. In the afternoon they presented their\r\nwritten report to the Provost-judge; he examined and approved it, and at\r\nonce gave an order for the delivery and shipment of the goods. Next\r\nday they were shipped, and probably a better pleased man never left\r\nAlexandria than Mr. G.\r\n\r\nThe only other case of this character to which we can give place,\r\noccurred between a large wholesale dry-goods firm of New York and one of\r\nthe largest retail dry-goods houses in Alexandria, and differed from the\r\nfirst case only in the fact that here the store was securely locked up,\r\nand had been ever since the owners left. There was no agent in this case\r\nleft to sell or otherwise dispose of the goods, though it came out, in\r\nthe course of the evidence, that the clerk, with whom the keys had been\r\nleft, had frequently been seen to take large packages of goods from the\r\nstore, and he acknowledged that he had sent some across the lines to his\r\nformer employers.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in the one related, the New York merchant went to\r\nAlexandria to look after his customers, and found them gone. After\r\nconsiderable inquiry, he found the clerk who had the keys, but the clerk\r\nsaid he had no authority from the owners to do anything, and would not\r\nso much as open the store to allow the creditor to look in. The merchant\r\nthen called upon Judge Freese and told him the facts of the case. The\r\nJudge informed him that the court now had a regular course of procedure\r\nin these cases, and if he chose to pursue that course he could bring his\r\ncase before the court. The merchant inquired what was the procedure? The\r\nJudge informed him that the first step was, for the party having a claim\r\nto make an affidavit as to its amount and its correctness--the same\r\nas in cases of attachment in ordinary courts; that thereupon the\r\ncourt issued an order, having the force of an attachment, to the\r\nProvost-Marshal, to take charge of the goods of the defendant until such\r\ntime as the case could be heard--usually in one week from the day the\r\nattachment issued; that the plaintiff must then produce his original\r\nbooks of entry, or note, or other evidence of debt, and satisfy the\r\ncourt, beyond any possible doubt, that the debt is due and unpaid; that\r\nwhen this had been done--the defendant meanwhile, or any one for him,\r\nhaving, of course, full opportunity to make any defence within\r\nhis power, if any he had to make--the court appoints three wholly\r\ndisinterested persons to fix the value and set apart so much of the\r\ndefendant's goods as would satisfy the claim of the plaintiff, with cost\r\nof transportation to a market, and costs of proceedings; that the three\r\ncommissioners must then make report, with schedule of goods set apart,\r\nto the court; that the court carefully examines said report, and\r\nif found correct in all particulars, then issues an order to\r\nProvost-Marshal to deliver to plaintiff the goods so set apart; upon\r\nreceipt of which the plaintiff executes receipt to Provost-Marshal for\r\nthe goods, as in full liquidation of his claim against the defendant.\r\nThe proceedings, the Judge said, were so plain that a child could\r\nunderstand them, and so open and straightforward, from first to last,\r\nthat a mistake was scarcely possible.\r\n\r\nThe merchant expressed his delight at the mode of procedure, as detailed\r\nby the Judge, and said he was ready to make the preliminary affidavit\r\nat once, and in a week would return to Alexandria with his books and\r\nwitnesses to substantiate his claim. The Judge drew the necessary\r\naffidavit; the merchant subscribed and swore thereto; the\r\nProvost-Marshal was sent for; the order for attaching the goods put into\r\nhis hands; and within one hour from the time when the New York merchant\r\nentered the Judge's office, guards stood in front and at the rear of the\r\nbuilding, to see that no goods were taken from the store-room. The\r\nyoung man who had the keys was then sent for, and told to write to his\r\nemployers, and inform any friends of his employers who might still be in\r\nAlexandria, of just what had been done thus far, and that the court had\r\nappointed one week from that day to hear the case. If they, or any one\r\nfor them, had any defence to make, they should be at the court-room at\r\nten o'clock of that day and should then be heard. He thanked the Judge\r\nfor his courtesy in sending for him, and for the timely notice given for\r\ndefence, and was about to retire, when the Judge told him that he\r\nmight hand the keys over to the Provost-Marshal until the case had been\r\ndisposed of. This he at first refused to do, but a few words from the\r\nJudge satisfied him that wisdom was the better part of valor, when he\r\ntook the keys from his pocket and handed them to the Marshal.\r\n\r\nIn one week the trial came on. The New York merchant, on behalf of\r\nhis firm, appeared with his books and with the clerk who had sold\r\nand delivered the goods. The defendants were not present, but were\r\nrepresented by their clerk, by the secession lawyer of the city,\r\nheretofore spoken of, and by about a dozen other gentlemen, who were\r\nfriends, if not relatives, of the absconded debtors. The plaintiff\r\nproved that the books before the court were the original books of entry\r\nof the firm of which he was a member. By his clerk he proved the sale\r\nand delivery of the goods, item by item, as charged upon the books. By\r\nhimself he proved that the debt was now due, and that no part of it had\r\never been paid. The court then asked if there was any person present to\r\nmake a defence in this case, if so, they would now be heard. The clerk\r\nthen arose and said he \"was instructed by the attorney of the firm to\r\nsay, that while they had no formal defence to make in this case, yet\r\nthey desired to enter their protest against the jurisdiction of this\r\ncourt, and to reserve to and for themselves whatever rights they might\r\nhave under the laws of Virginia.\" He added, that he himself \"was aware\r\nthat the firm, of which he was formerly a clerk, had purchased goods of\r\nthe New York firm represented in this case, and had no doubt that the\r\namount they claimed was due them; but that it would have been wiser and\r\nmore honorable in them to have waited until the war was over, when they\r\nwould undoubtedly have been paid dollar for dollar.\" The court inquired\r\nif there was any other gentleman present who desired to offer any\r\nevidence, or say anything by way of defence in this case. There was no\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nThe court then proceeded to give an opinion in the case, which occupied\r\nnearly an hour, and was listened to with almost breathless silence by\r\nthe large audience present. In amount claimed, and in point of high\r\nstanding, both as to the plaintiffs and defendants, it was the most\r\nimportant case of the kind yet brought before the court, and for\r\nthe information of the general public, no less than for the parties\r\nimmediately interested, the Judge thought it well to state the\r\nprinciples upon which the court acted, and their applicability to\r\nthe case in hand. A reporter present wrote out the opinion, which, by\r\nrequest of the New York merchant, was published soon after in the New\r\nYork Times, occupying over two columns of closely printed matter. As\r\nmost of the principles enunciated in this opinion were the same as\r\nstated in the first case heretofore given, it is not necessary to\r\nrepeat them here. In reply to the clerk's request \"to reserve to and for\r\nthemselves whatever rights they might have under the laws of Virginia,\"\r\nand to the opinion expressed by him that \"the New York firm would have\r\nacted wiser and more honorable to have waited for their claim until the\r\nwar was over,\" the court said:\r\n\r\n\"Of course, in this, as in every other case, the parties can and do\r\nreserve for themselves whatever rights they possess under the laws\r\nof Virginia, of which this city forms a part, and, if the rebellion\r\nsucceeds, the parties reserving these rights will undoubtedly make the\r\nbest use of them possible; but meanwhile the claimants, so far as this\r\ncourt can effect it, shall have a return of their own goods, or of\r\nothers equal in value to their claim, and after that, if the debtors,\r\nthrough sequestration laws made by the Confederate Congress, or any laws\r\nnow made or hereafter to be made by Virginia, can get the goods back or\r\ndamages by way of reclamation, this court at least will have done its\r\nduty. With regard to the opinion expressed by the young gentleman, the\r\ncourt begs to differ with him. By his own confession portions of the\r\ngoods have already been sent across the lines, and to that extent have\r\ncontributed to the 'aid and comfort' of the enemies of this government,\r\nand had there been no claimants, no interference, there is no manner of\r\ndoubt that every article in the store would, sooner or later, have gone\r\nthe same way; and as to the debtors paying the claim after the war is\r\nover, if we may judge by what they and their chosen government have\r\nalready done, there is no more probability of it than for the waters of\r\nNiagara Falls to run backwards. As the leap of the waters in that case\r\nis irrevocable, so is the leap from the fair haven of loyalty to the\r\ndeep, dark chasm of disloyalty--once taken, there can be no hope of\r\nreturn.\" One other matter the court explained in this case, which was\r\nnot explained in the first, namely, why the goods were not sold at\r\npublic sale, and the money, instead of the goods, turned over to\r\nclaimants. He said: \"It will be observed that by the rules of procedure\r\nadopted in these cases, the court is quite as careful to protect the\r\ninterests of debtors as of claimants. In ordinary actions for debt, in\r\ncourts of common pleas, the goods, after being attached or levied upon,\r\nare put up at public sale and sold to the highest bidder, and the money\r\nreceived at such sales paid to claimants. In such cases it often happens\r\nthat, even in a market, goods do not bring one-half and sometimes not\r\none-fourth their real value, and the defendant of course has to suffer\r\nthe loss. If the goods seized here were thus exposed to public sale, at\r\nthis time, when two-thirds of its ordinary inhabitants have fled from\r\nthe city, and when there is little or no market for anything outside\r\nof army stores, they would not bring one-fourth their cost; whereas the\r\nsame goods taken to a market, will sell for about their original cost.\r\nHence the rule in the proceedings whereby goods are assessed by three\r\ndisinterested persons, and turned over to the claimants at the prices\r\nfixed by the commissioners. And the court begs to add--though not\r\nboastfully, since it only performs a duty in so doing--that, because of\r\nthe absence of the defendants, doubly the care is taken that the full\r\nmarket value is fixed to each article turned over to the creditor; and\r\nthat in every case the court carefully supervises the schedules, to see\r\nthat no mistakes have been made.\r\n\r\n\"If the goods were sold at a public sale, the court could in no way\r\ncontrol the price, and a debtor's goods might be sold for one-half or\r\none-fourth of their real value; but by this procedure the debtor is sure\r\nto receive about the fair value of the goods. The fact that the debtor\r\nis absent (although a rebel to the government which this court in part\r\nrepresents) makes us all the more careful to see that he shall have\r\nexact justice; for, in all these cases, this court recognizes the\r\nprinciples so ably stated by Bouvier, by Blackburn, and by others who\r\nhave written on the law of sales--1. That 'to constitute a sale, there\r\nmust be a price, which is the consideration given for the purchase of a\r\nthing.' 2. That 'the price must be serious, or such a one as the seller\r\nintends to require to be paid to him. As to the quantum of the price,\r\nthat is altogether immaterial, unless there has been fraud in the\r\ntransaction.' 3. That 'the price must be certain and determined, but\r\nupon the maxim, id certum est quod reddi cerium potest, a sale may be\r\nvalid, although it is agreed that the price of the thing sold shall be\r\ndetermined by a third person! 4. That 'the price must consist in a sum\r\nof money which the buyer agrees to pay to the seller; for, if it be paid\r\nin any other way, the contract is not a sale, but an exchange or barter.\r\nBut it is only requisite that the agreement should be for a payment in\r\nmoney; in the sequel it may be changed, and the creditor may take goods\r\nin payment, and the contract will still be a sale. It is not requisite\r\nthat the money should be paid down, either at the time of the sale or\r\nthe delivery of the goods; it may be upon a credit, or payable at a\r\nfuture time. And, 5. That the consent of the contracting parties must be\r\nobtained; by which consent is meant an agreement to something proposed.\r\nIt does not consist simply in a vague will to sell or to pay; it must\r\nbear on all the conditions which may be suggested by the circumstances\r\nof the case or imagined by the caprice of the contracting parties.'\"\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in others, the court fixed upon the amount due the\r\nclaimants, appointed three commissioners to select and assess values to\r\ngoods to the amount of claim, supervised the report and schedule made,\r\ngave order to the Provost-Marshal to deliver the goods; all of which\r\nwas done, and the New York merchant returned to his home, with the full\r\nconviction that in one city at least, and in one court at least, justice\r\nwas administered without partiality, and without fear or favor of, or\r\nto, any one.\r\n\r\nNot only was the Judge's decision in this case published, as heretofore\r\nstated, in the New York journals, but the newspapers all over the\r\ncountry had more or less to say about it editorially--some favorable and\r\nsome unfavorable--the particulars of which and the results of which will\r\nbe more fully stated in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 267]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. LEGAL TECHNICALITIES IN CONFLICT WITH COMMON SENSE. ANOTHER\r\nACT IN THE DRAMA.--PRIDE ON THE ONE SIDE AND JUSTICE ON THE OTHER\r\nPROMPTING THE ACTORS.\r\n\r\n|THERE is nothing so uncommon as common sense; nor is there anything\r\nmore distasteful than common sense to such as pride themselves on\r\ntechnical knowledge. The doctor who would rather kill by rule than cure\r\nby reason, if the reason chanced to come from a sick-nurse, or from\r\nan old woman; and the lawyer who would rather lose a case by observing\r\ntechnicalities and following precedents, than gain it by exercising\r\nplain common sense, are by no means so rare as some suppose. They are to\r\nbe found in all the walks of life, high as well as low, and whenever or\r\nwherever found, should be carefully noted, especially by the historian,\r\nin order to warn others from falling into a like error.\r\n\r\nFrom the very day the provost-court opened in Alexandria, the\r\nsecessionists of that city, and all whom they could influence in\r\nWashington and elsewhere, commenced to oppose it--not so much openly as\r\nsecretly. This was especially true of the only lawyer remaining there,\r\nand his reasons for opposition were of a threefold character. First, he\r\nsaw it might, and probably would be used in the interests of the Union\r\ncause and in the cause of freedom, and thus interfere with the plans of\r\nsecessionists and of slave-owners; secondly, he opposed it because the\r\ncourt refused to admit him, or any other lawyer, to practise in it,\r\nunless they would first take the oath of allegiance to the United States\r\ngovernment; and thirdly, because the court was presided over by one who\r\nwas not a professional lawyer; by one who seemed to have more regard\r\nfor justice and equity than for legal technicalities; by one who cared\r\nnothing about the laws of Virginia, or law precedents of any State, if\r\none or the other stood in the way of justice; by one who preferred to be\r\nguided by the rules of common sense, rather than by the rules of law.\r\nTo one who is not a professional man himself, all this may seem strange;\r\nbut to one who has mingled much with professional men, it will be\r\nreadily understood as comprehending cases which have fallen under his\r\nown observation. On the pretence of protecting the people, though really\r\nto protect their own selfish interests, both doctors and lawyers\r\nhave procured the passage of laws in many States, whereby no one is\r\nauthorized to practise in either profession until he shall have complied\r\nwith such rules and regulations as these laws prescribe. It is virtually\r\na relinquishment by the people of one of the very first principles of\r\nfreedom--namely, the right to choose their own agents or servants,\r\nbut it is submitted to on the plea that it keeps out quacks and\r\npettifoggers. If, while keeping these out, it imparted more of common\r\nsense to those taken in, it would be at least compensating in its\r\noperations, but it does neither.\r\n\r\nIt was observed that immediately after the court fined that secessionist\r\nfive hundred dollars for assault and threat to kill the Unionist (an\r\naccount of which has heretofore been given), the Alexandria lawyer\r\nbecame doubly active in his opposition to the court, and it was stated,\r\nas a reason for his greatly increased activity, that the hardware\r\nmerchant had agreed to give the five hundred dollars as a fee to the\r\nlawyer, provided he could get it back, and procure an order from General\r\nMcClellan, or from the authorities at Washington, to suppress the court.\r\nTo effect this object the Alexandria lawyer applied to every prominent\r\nsecessionist at Washington, and got from each the promise to bring to\r\nbear whatever influence he could, through Northern sympathizers. He went\r\nhimself, personally, to every lawyer in Washington, and appealed to each\r\nto protect the \"honor of their profession,\" by assisting to suppress\r\na court which had no legal existence, or, at least, to remove from its\r\nhead one who was not a lawyer, but a doctor, by profession. Even several\r\nUnion lawyers were moved to activity by this plea for \"protection to the\r\nprofession,\" while secession lawyers were ready enough to make this, or\r\nanything else, a plea whereby to cripple the government.\r\n\r\nIt came to the ears of Judge Freese that some of these professedly\r\nUnion, but really disloyal, lawyers had gone direct to President Lincoln\r\nand urged him, both as President and as a lawyer, to issue an order to\r\nsuppress the Alexandria court, or, at least, direct the removal of the\r\n\"doctor-judge.\" The reply, as reported by one who chanced to be present,\r\nwas characteristic of President Lincoln, and in about the following\r\nwords: \"I have known Dr. Freese as a first-class physician for some\r\nyears, and have only known of him as a judge for a few months: but from\r\nthe way he administers law-doses to these Alexandrians, I am beginning\r\nto think that he is even a better judge than he is a doctor. He may not\r\nunderstand legal technicalities and the rules of courts quite as well as\r\nsome lawyers I know of--present company, of course, always excepted--but\r\nhe shows in his decisions a wonderful deal of common sense, which is far\r\nbetter than rules of law or technicalities. What they say of the doctor\r\nreminds me of a story which is told of a man who said he could not cure\r\nchills and fever, but was 'death on fits,' and wanted all his patients\r\nto have fits, when he would cure them at once. Most of our lawyers and\r\njudges are death on technicalities, but can't cure the commonest ills\r\nto which society is subjected; whereas, Dr. Freese is curing the ills of\r\nAlexandria so rapidly and so successfully, that it will soon be one\r\nof the most healthy and one of the most thoroughly Union cities in the\r\nwhole country'. I would not interfere with him or his court for the\r\nworld, and don't think any one else should.\"\r\n\r\nFinding that they could make no impression upon the President, they next\r\nwent to the Secretary of War, Simon Cameron. He listened to all they had\r\nto say, and then replied about as follows: \"Yes, I've heard considerable\r\nabout Freese's 'Bayonet Court,' as secessionists and Northern\r\nsympathizers with secession call it, and the more I've heard of it the\r\nbetter I like it. I only wish we had just such a court, and just such a\r\njudge at the head of it, in every city we've conquered from the rebels.\r\nThey would do more towards extracting the venom of these secession\r\nserpents than all our armies combined. As to the Judge being a doctor,\r\ninstead of a lawyer, by profession, that only makes me think the more of\r\nhim. A lawyer is anybody's man who'll pay him a fee, and the one who'll\r\npay the best is apt to get from him the best service, no matter on which\r\nside he pretends to be employed, but a doctor has only to cure the case\r\nin hand, and can have no conflicting interests; and from the way Judge\r\nFreese is pulling out the teeth of those secession scoundrels, by taking\r\nfrom them the means to do harm and transferring it to the pockets of\r\nthose to whom it justly belongs, and who will use it to sustain the\r\nUnion cause, I am satisfied that he is just the man for the place, and\r\non no account would I do anything to suppress either him or his court.\"\r\n\r\nTheir next applications were to the Attorney-General, Edward Bates, of\r\nMissouri, and Postmaster-General Montgomery Blair, of Maryland. Here\r\nthey struck chords which were much more likely to prove responsive--not\r\nonly because they each had been pro-slavery men all their lives,\r\nand would naturally resent Judge Freese's interference with the\r\n\"institution,\" and with those who still claimed the right to hold and to\r\nuse \"human chattels\" just as they pleased, but, more especially, because\r\nthey were both lawyers, both felt a special interest in maintaining\r\nthe \"_dignity_ of the profession\" for both expected to return to active\r\npractice so soon as they vacated their then official positions in Mr.\r\nLincoln's cabinet. Mr. Bates took up the matter with great earnestness\r\nso soon as it was fairly before him, and, within one hour from the time\r\nthe self-constituted committee left him, he was with the President,\r\nurging him to suppress the court. When Mr. Lincoln had expressed his\r\nopinions concerning it, Mr. Bates, for the time being, seemed entirely\r\nnonplussed; but next day he returned to the attack with renewed energy,\r\nand for days and weeks after that, whenever he met the President, he had\r\nsomething to say against the Alexandria provost-court. Mr. Blair also\r\nspoke to the President concerning it, and strongly contended that it\r\nwould greatly aid the Union cause, \"especially in the _border_ States,\"\r\nif that court were suppressed. The President did not think so, and would\r\ngive no such order.\r\n\r\nWhile these efforts were being made with the President and with the\r\nCabinet, corresponding efforts were being made with General McClellan,\r\nthen in command of the troops on the south side of the Potomac. Within\r\na week or two from the opening of the court, one of the General's aids\r\ncalled upon General Montgomery to make inquiry about it, and several\r\ntimes after that this same aid (whom the Union men of Alexandria knew\r\npersonally as a pro-slavery Washington sympathizer with the rebellion,\r\nthough professedly a Union man) called upon General Montgomery to\r\nprotest against the acts of the court, so far as they related to the\r\npeople of Alexandria. Whether always sent by General McClellan, or\r\nwhether he sometimes called on his own volition, was not definitely\r\nknown. The Alexandria secession lawyer seemed to be on intimate personal\r\nrelations with this aid-de-camp, and it may have been that this personal\r\nrelationship stirred up the aid to special efforts. Doubtless the lawyer\r\nkept the aid, and, through the aid, General McClellan, well-informed\r\nof all that was going on in Alexandria--especially with regard to the\r\ndoings of the provost court.\r\n\r\nThus matters had gone on, and were going on, up to the time when the\r\nlast case recorded in the previous chapter was decided by the court.\r\nThe publicity given to that case, by the publication at length of the\r\nJudge's opinion in the New York Times and other Northern papers, aroused\r\nthe entire pro-slavery secession-sympathizing element of the Northern\r\nStates, and in a few days thereafter it came surging into Washington\r\nlike a flood. It beat against the door of every Cabinet officer; it\r\nrolled and tumbled about in every hotel and drinking-saloon; it surged\r\nviolently against the White House; and even found its way into the\r\nexecutive chamber. Mr. Bates now put on renewed and increased vigor, and\r\ninsisted with the President, that, as all United States courts\r\nbelonged to his department, and the people held him responsible, as\r\nAttorney-General, for their doings and misdoings, he, and he alone,\r\nought to have the deciding of the Alexandria matter, and, if left with\r\nhim, he would at once suppress the court.\r\n\r\nWhen things had reached this crisis, the President sent word to Judge\r\nFreese to call upon him at his earliest convenience. The Judge, after\r\nbeing stationed at Alexandria, had, during the first few months, called\r\nfrequently upon President Lincoln, Secretary Seward, and Secretary\r\nCameron, as he had known them all personally, and somewhat intimately,\r\nfor many years; but for the month preceding this word from the\r\nPresident, the Judge had been kept so exceedingly busy with the affairs\r\nof his court that he had scarcely been to Washington. On the afternoon\r\nof the next day after getting Mr. Lincoln's message, Judge Freese called\r\nupon him, and was received with the utmost cordiality. So soon as they\r\nwere entirely alone, the President told the Judge of the position which\r\nAttorney-General Bates had taken with reference to the Alexandria court,\r\nand added: \"I really think Bates will resign unless he can have his own\r\nway in this thing. I wish, Doctor, you would call upon him at once, and\r\nsee if you can't change his mind. It would be a dreadful thing, just\r\nnow, when we are in the midst of a war, to have any Cabinet officer\r\nresign, as our enemies would regard it as showing weakness on our part,\r\nand as a triumph for themselves, and yet I don't want your court closed,\r\nif it can possibly be helped. Call upon Bates, Doctor, call upon Bates,\r\nand let me know the result.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the President's room the Judge went direct to Mr. Bates's office\r\nand had a long conference with him. The Attorney-General, while\r\nadmitting the correctness of Judge Freese's decisions, so far as he\r\nhad heard of them, still insisted that there was no law by which the\r\nexistence of such a court was authorized, and therefore it ought to\r\ncease its operations at once. The Judge admitted that he knew of no law\r\nby which such a court was authorized, but contended that \"necessity\r\nknew no law,\" and that the existence of just such a court was a real\r\nnecessity in Alexandria, not only as a means of preserving the peace of\r\nthe city, but for all other purposes for which courts were ever used,\r\nsince the State, county, and municipal courts had all run away when the\r\nUnion troops came in, and this was the only court through which\r\njustice could be obtained in any case or for any purpose. All this, the\r\nAttorney-General said, seemed to be true, but it was better to wait for\r\njustice than to violate known rules of law in trying to obtain it. \"The\r\ncourt has no legal existence, sir, the court has no legal existence,\" he\r\nkept saying over and over again, and this was his answer, and his only\r\nanswer, to every argument brought forth by the Judge. The Judge finally\r\nmade him this proposition: \"If you, sir, will withdraw your opposition\r\nto the continuance of this court, I will enter into a bond with the\r\nUnited States government, in the sum of one hundred thousand dollars,\r\nwith good and sufficient sureties, the condition of which bond shall\r\nbe, that, when the war shall have ended, every case which has been\r\nadjudicated by that court, and every one which may be adjudicated by it\r\nhereafter, shall be revised by the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nor by any one or more of the justices thereof, and if in any case it be\r\nfound that injustice has been done, I will refund to the parties doubly\r\nthe amount out of which they have been wronged because of the action\r\nof the court; or, if any punishment has been inflicted beyond what the\r\nSupreme Court will say was right, under the circumstances, I will pay\r\nto the party punished, or to his legal representatives, whatever damages\r\nthe Supreme Court may adjudge.\"\r\n\r\n\"This, certainly,\" replied the Attorney-General, \"is a very fair\r\nproposition on your part; but, sir, the court has no legal existence, no\r\nlegal existence, and while I remain Attorney-General, and am responsible\r\nfor whatever is done in this department of governmental affairs, I\r\ncannot consent that such a court shall continue.\"\r\n\r\nThis ended their interview, for the Judge plainly saw that he might talk\r\ntill doomsday and yet not change the Attorney-General's mind an iota.\r\n\"Convince a man against his will, and he remains of the same opinion\r\nstill,\" says an old maxim, and never was the maxim better exemplified\r\nthan in the case of Mr. Bates. He was one of those men who looked at\r\neverything, as it were, through a gun-barrel, and could see nothing to\r\nthe right or left of the one line of vision; one of those men who are so\r\nstraight, that, like the Indian's gun, they \"lean a little over;\" one\r\nof those self opinionated men, who, having once conceived an idea or\r\nprejudice, no amount of argument can change his mind.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Judge again called upon the President, and told him all\r\nthat had passed between the Attorney-General and himself. The President\r\nlaughed heartily at the \"mulishness of old Bates,\" as he called it,\r\nand yet seemed a good deal annoyed at the unreasonable stubbornness\r\nmanifested by the Attorney-General. He did not, he said, know what to do\r\nor to say. He was in a quandary, and could not see his way clearly out.\r\nFinally, he asked the Judge to call upon the Secretary of War, and see\r\nwhat he might say about it.\r\n\r\nThe Judge then called upon Mr. Cameron, and told him of the interviews\r\nhe had had with the President and with the Attorney-General, relative to\r\nthe Alexandria court. The Secretary listened attentively, and, when the\r\nJudge had finished, expressed opinions about the Attorney-General more\r\nforcible than polite. He talked, he said, \"just like a d--d old traitor,\r\nand if he is not one, his own tongue belies him!\" He strongly suspected,\r\nhe said, that \"both Bates and Blair were wolves in sheep's clothing, and\r\nthis only went to confirm that opinion.\" He had, he said, \"expressed as\r\nmuch to the President, and would do so again when next he met him.\" He\r\nhad thought himself of resigning, rather than remain in the Cabinet in\r\ncompany \"with such d--d rascals and traitors to their country.\" For a\r\nfull half-hour the Secretary fairly raved with excitement, and when the\r\nJudge was about to leave, told him to hold on, let come what would.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be well to add that within a few weeks after\r\nthat interview Mr. Cameron did resign his place in the cabinet, and Mr.\r\nE. M. Stanton was appointed in his stead; but whether Bates's action in\r\nthe case of the Alexandria court was one of his reasons for resigning,\r\nwe have no means of knowing, though it Is not at all improbable.\r\n\r\nAgain the Judge called upon the President, and told him what had passed\r\nbetween Secretary Cameron and himself. The President seemed now more\r\nconfounded than ever, and finally told the Judge to let things rest for\r\na few days until he could think over the matter, and see what was best\r\nto be done.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after this, the aid-de-camp of General McClellan, who had\r\nso often before called upon General Montgomery, called again, and told\r\nhim that it was General McClellan's special wish that the provost-court\r\nshould have nothing more to do with civil cases, or cases touching the\r\nsubject of slavery in any way. That while General McClellan greatly\r\npreferred not to issue a formal order on the subject, yet he would\r\ncertainly do so if his wishes could not be carried out in any other way.\r\nHe was not willing, the aid said, to have Judge Freese interfere\r\nwith the old citizens of Alexandria in any way, though if he chose to\r\ncontinue the court merely for the punishment of soldiers who got drunk\r\nwithin the city limits, or otherwise disturbed the peace, he had no\r\nobjection. At the same visit, the aid delivered to General Montgomery\r\nan order from General McClellan requiring the court to refund to the\r\nAlexandria hardware merchant the five hundred dollars which he had been\r\nrequired to pay as a fine, because of the assault, with threat to kill,\r\nupon the Union man--all of which has heretofore been related.\r\n\r\nWhen the aid had gone, General Montgomery sent for Judge Freese,\r\nand they had a long conference as to what had best be done under the\r\ncircumstances. The Judge had before told the General all that had passed\r\nbetween the President, the Attorney-General, the Secretary of War, and\r\nhimself; and the General now told the Judge all that had passed between\r\nGeneral McClellan's aid-de-camp and himself. The Judge said that under\r\nno circumstances could he consent to continue the court, if thenceforth\r\nit was only to punish soldiers for drunkenness and other misdemeanors;\r\nthat it had been exceedingly distasteful to him from the first to\r\nhave to punish a soldier at all, and now to punish him alone, and let\r\ncitizens, who committed offences far worse, go free from punishment,\r\nwould be, in his opinion, a mockery of justice, and he would not be the\r\npresiding officer of such a court; that, it having gone abroad that\r\nthe court was willing and ready to assist Northern creditors in their\r\nefforts to collect claims against disloyal debtors, it would now\r\nbe exceedingly unpleasant to have to deny such claimants as might\r\nthereafter call, and, rather than have to do this, he would much\r\nprefer to see the court closed; for then the public would place the\r\nresponsibility just where it belonged. The Judge added, that he knew the\r\ncourt was placing the President in a very embarrassing position, so far\r\nas related to his Cabinet; that, while Cameron and Seward were anxious\r\nto have the court continue, Bates and Blair were just as anxious to have\r\nit suppressed; and from the order just received from General McClellan\r\nto return the five hundred dollars fine, it was entirely clear that the\r\nsecessionists of Alexandria, and the sympathizers with secession at the\r\nNorth, had gained complete control over him; from all of which the Judge\r\nthought it would be best to close the court.\r\n\r\nGeneral Montgomery fully concurred with the Judge in all these views,\r\nand added that, as the court had been organized upon his order, without\r\nfirst consulting with General McClellan or the President, he would much\r\nprefer to have it close voluntarily, than to be compelled to close\r\nit upon the order of General McClellan or of the President. The Judge\r\nreplied, that while he believed that President Lincoln would never issue\r\nsuch an order, no matter what the consequences to himself might be,\r\nstill he should be glad to relieve the President from what to him was\r\nevidently a great embarrassment; and if he, General Montgomery, would\r\nissue an order directing the court to close its operations on the next\r\nor any day following, he, the Judge, would gladly announce the order\r\nfrom the bench and adjourn the court _sine die._\r\n\r\nSuch was the conclusion finally agreed upon. General Montgomery wrote\r\nout the necessary order and handed it to the Judge. Next day, after all\r\nthe business before the court had been disposed of as usual, the Judge\r\nread General Montgomery's order from the bench, and explained to those\r\npresent why it had been issued. Had a cannon burst then and there and\r\nkilled a hundred men, the surprise could not have been greater. Some\r\nraved at Attorney-General Bates, and pro-slavery men generally; others\r\ncursed General McClellan and Northern sympathizers with rebellion,\r\ngenerally; deep and somewhat loud were the mutterings among all present;\r\nbut the order was irrevocable, and thus closed at once and forever the\r\nprovost-court of Alexandria.\r\n\r\nHad that court been continued, and others like it established in every\r\ncity of the South, so soon as they came into the possession of Union\r\ntroops, at least one hundred millions of dollars would have been\r\ncollected from the property of Southern debtors and gone into the\r\npockets of Northern creditors; the war would have ended two years\r\nsooner; over five hundred millions of dollars would have been saved to\r\nthe United States treasury; and over one hundred thousand lives been\r\nsaved to the homes and families of both the North and the South. Only\r\nat the last judgment-day will it be known how great was the mistake--a\r\nmistake which, in its ultimate consequences, was not less ruinous to\r\nthe South than to the North--of those who insisted upon, and who finally\r\ncompelled, the closing of the provost-court at Alexandria.\r\n\r\nWe say this after a full consideration of the whole subject as drawn\r\nfrom the facts heretofore detailed in this volume, and do not think\r\nwe shall have to take a single word of it back. True, very true, as\r\neloquently stated in a letter from our old friend, J. E. Brush, Esq.,\r\nof New York--\"Floyd, Thompson, and Cobb, of Buchanan's Cabinet, had so\r\ndisarmed and depleted the government of means, that Lincoln had very\r\nslender resources; and the gullibility of Northern business men in\r\nfilling the orders of Southern men for war material, for months previous\r\nto the opening of the war, proves that they meant business, while the\r\nNorth did not take in the situation at all;\" still we think, but for\r\nthe secret machinations of Northern sympathizers--of men on whom, for a\r\ntime, the government relied and entirely trusted, including generals in\r\nthe field, officers in the navy, and even officers in the Cabinet--the\r\nwar would have been ended at least two years sooner, and hundreds of\r\nmillions saved to the taxpayers of the country.\r\n\r\nWe are aware that such a statement at first sight seems extravagant,\r\nif not wild; but if the reader will carefully weigh each factor of the\r\nproblem, and follow out the relation which each bears to the other;\r\nand then if he will suspend judgment until he shall have read the last\r\nchapter and last line of this book--so that he shall have all the facts\r\nbefore him, all the secret springs which were so adroitly worked, but\r\nof which nobody even suspected the existence, all the villanies of men\r\nsingly and of men united in political and religious associations--we\r\nhave no doubt at all but what he will reach the same conclusion that we\r\nhave reached in the above paragraph. Facts and figures never lie when\r\nproperly placed; but men are so disposed to shut their eyes against\r\nunpleasant facts, and so inclined to place figures in such a way as will\r\nbring the result they wish for, that the most palpable truths are often\r\nhid, and kept hid, from the public, until by some accident or incident\r\nthe secrets are revealed, as in this volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 283]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. FACTS, FIGURES, AND FAIR INFERENCES.\r\n\r\n|WHEN, on the 15th of April, 1861, Abraham Lincoln, as President of the\r\nUnited States, called for 75,000 men, for three months, to suppress the\r\nrebellion, he did it after repeated consultations with every member\r\nof his Cabinet, both when assembled in council and privately with each\r\nindividual member. That Cabinet was one of the ablest, if not the very\r\nablest, that any President of the United States ever had about him.\r\nWilliam H. Seward had been Governor of New York, had long been United\r\nStates Senator, and understood the strength and resources of each\r\nindividual State, and of the whole Union, as well, probably, as any man\r\nthen living. Salmon P. Chase had been Governor of Ohio, long a United\r\nStates Senator, was a thorough statistician, mathematician, and\r\nfinancier, and had made the resources of both States and nation a long\r\nand faithful study. Simon Cameron had been a statistician and banker\r\nnearly his whole life, had long been a United States Senator, was a man\r\nof unusually strong common sense, and had, from a political stand-point,\r\nmade the Southern States and their peculiar institutions and resources a\r\nspecial study. Wells and Smith were good, strong, practical-sensed men;\r\nwhile Blair and Bates were both Southern men, were thoroughly conversant\r\nwith the institutions, with the leading men, with the wealth, and with\r\nthe resources of every Southern State.\r\n\r\nOne would have thought the combined wisdom of such a body of men as near\r\nperfection, as near certainty in political prophecy, as it was possible\r\nfor men to attain, when judging of the future by inferences drawn from\r\nactual knowledge of the past and present; and yet, subsequent events\r\nproved that never were men wider from the mark than were these men in\r\nadvising the President to call out 75,000 men for three months to subdue\r\nthe rebellion. Why this great error of calculation and judgment?\r\n\r\nThose who have carefully read the preceding chapters of this book will\r\nhave the answer, in part, but not the whole answer. Of course, President\r\nLincoln and his Cabinet thoroughly understood the sympathy which existed\r\nbetween English cotton-spinners and American cotton-growers, and, in\r\ntheir calculations, made due allowance for this feeling. They also\r\nunderstood thoroughly the sympathy existing between the aristocracy\r\nof England and king cotton of America; for they well knew that the\r\naristocracy of England were largely the owners of those cotton-mills or\r\nfurnished the capital with which to run them. For this, then, they\r\nalso made due allowance in all their calculations; and, with a view\r\nto checkmate this influence as far as possible, sent Thurlow Weed on a\r\nsecret mission to England. They understood the business relations of the\r\nPacific Mail Steamship Company with the Southern States, as well as the\r\nrelations of other incorporated companies, and of merchants generally,\r\nwith the South. They knew of the debt that was then owing--nearly\r\ntwo hundred millions of dollars--from Southern merchants to Northern\r\nmerchants, and fully comprehended the sympathy which such community of\r\ninterests would naturally create between the parties; and for all this\r\nmade due allowance. They understood, of course, the love of gain natural\r\nto every man, and that merchants, manufacturers, and others, by the\r\nthousands, would be on the constant lookout to make money out of the\r\nwar in any possible way commensurate with their own safety; and for this\r\nmade due allowance in their calculations as to what was to be overcome.\r\nAnd last, but not least, they well understood the general sympathy\r\nwhich was felt by the Democratic party of the North for the people and\r\npeculiar institutions of the South, and how ready some of the leaders of\r\nthat party would be to aid the South in any way they could with safety\r\nto themselves; but they also understood that a very large number of\r\nthe followers of the masses--of the bone and sinew of that party--were\r\npatriotic; while another portion, and a very large portion, would be\r\nready to hire themselves to do whatever would pay best, and that if\r\nlarge monthly pay and large bounties were offered, these men would be\r\nas ready to hire themselves to kill their fellow-men as to slaughter\r\ncattle; and with these two elements (the patriotic and the mercenary),\r\nthey believed the party could be so far controlled as to prevent it from\r\ndoing any material injury to the Union cause.\r\n\r\nBut while comprehending all these things, and making due allowance\r\nfor them all, they did not comprehend nor make allowance for the\r\ndeep-seated, desperate, condemnable villany that was hid away in the\r\nhearts of these same Democratic leaders, and that would come forth from\r\nits hiding-places whenever and wherever it could do so with the hope of\r\ngain to itself, or with the hope of so crippling the Union cause that it\r\nwould finally fail, when the affairs of the government would again fall\r\ninto the hands of the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nThey did not comprehend, nor was it possible for any human foresight\r\nto have conceived any one of the many secret devices recorded in the\r\npreceding chapters of this volume, whereby men could and would serve the\r\nrebellion in the guise of Unionism; whereby men would, while playing\r\nthe patriot, really be the most desperate rebels At heart; whereby\r\nmen could, while receiving pay as generals in the Union army, do acts\r\nwhereby millions of dollars were lost to loyal merchants; whereby\r\ntransportation companies would, through its leading officers, while\r\nreceiving large pay from the United States government for services\r\nlegitimately rendered, be all the while aiding the rebellion by\r\nfurnishing ships and money with which to exchange cotton for war\r\nmaterials and army supplies; whereby, in a word, the Democratic party,\r\nas a party would so exercise its influence that vice disguised would\r\nseem virtue personified; that the promise of a candidacy to the office\r\nof President would so change the heart and paralyze the arm of a\r\nUnion general as to make him favor the rebel cause by delays, and by\r\ntransferring (through the closing of a provost-court) the sinews of\r\nwar (millions of dollars) from Union pockets to rebel coffers; that\r\nsteamship companies, while receiving the protection of Union arms,\r\nwould be all the while aiding the rebel cause; and that men, otherwise\r\nregarded as honorable, high-minded gentlemen, would, because of old\r\npolitical prejudice and present gain, meet in secret conclaves in\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington, and then and there\r\nconcoct the most desperate measures in aid of rebellion. These were\r\nsecrets which no human eye could penetrate, exigencies against which no\r\nhuman foresight could provide, and hence it cannot be said in truth that\r\nthese men failed in judgment, since they only failed upon points which\r\nwere entirely outside of all human calculation.\r\n\r\nBut for these things, three months' service of 75,000 men would have\r\nbeen amply sufficient to crush the rebellion, and from this we draw our\r\nfirst inference--which no one can pronounce otherwise than fair--that\r\nwhatever time it took beyond three months to crush the rebellion,\r\nwhatever men it took beyond 75,000, whatever money it cost beyond the\r\npay of 75,000 for three months, together with collateral expenses for\r\nthe same time, and whatever lives it cost beyond what would have\r\nbeen the probable mortality among the 75,000, are chargeable, fairly\r\nchargeable, unquestionably chargeable, to the Democratic party as a\r\nparty. We are careful to say as a party, for we know many individuals\r\nof that party who are as honorable, as pure, as patriotic as any in the\r\nRepublican party, and who only continue their connection with that party\r\n(for they know its past sins and present corruptions quite as well as we\r\ndo) either because their fathers were Democrats' and they do not wish\r\nto be regarded as \"turn-coats,\" or because they think the chances of\r\npolitical preferment are better in the Democratic than in the Republican\r\nparty; or, as they have sometimes replied to us, half in jest and half\r\nin earnest, \"the more corrupt the party is as a party, the greater\r\nnecessity is there to have some good men remain in it, to prevent it\r\nfrom doing greater injury to the country.\"\r\n\r\nAs historian, and as readers searching after truth, our next inquiry\r\nwill naturally be--First. How much more time did it take to subdue\r\nthe rebellion? Second. How many more men did it take? Third. How\r\nmuch additional did it cost? Fourth. How many additional lives were\r\nsacrificed? All these we regard as properly belonging to \"Secrets of the\r\nLate Rebellion, now Revealed for the First Time,\" for the reason that\r\nno one heretofore has ever made researches in this particular direction,\r\nand while the facts have existed ever since they came into being (just\r\nas the continent of America existed long before Columbus discovered\r\nit), yet they have never until now been revealed to the public in the\r\nrelations and connections to which they historically belong.\r\n\r\nI. Though both North and South had been making preparations months\r\nbefore, the actual beginning of open war may be dated from the firing\r\nupon Fort Sumter, on the 12th of April, 1861. The close of the war\r\nmay be reckoned from the surrender of General Lee to General Grant, at\r\nAppomattox Court-House, on April 9th, 1865, though it was months after\r\nbefore all the volunteer troops were disbanded and had reached their\r\nhomes. From the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender was three years,\r\neleven months, and twenty-eight days; or, to make the calculation still\r\nfiner, from the calling out of the seventy-five thousand troops to Lee's\r\nsurrender was three years, eleven months, and twenty-five days. Now,\r\ndeduct from this three months, and you have the extra time consumed in\r\ncrushing the rebellion, every month, every week, and every day of which\r\nis justly chargeable to the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nII. The records of the War Department show that 2,688,523 men were\r\ncalled into the national service from the beginning to the end of the\r\nwar. Deduct from this number 75,000, and you have the additional number\r\ncalled into service because of the secret machinations and villa-nies\r\nheretofore spoken of., viz, 2,613,523, every man of whom is chargeable,\r\nfairly chargeable, unquestionably chargeable to the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nIII. At the close of the fiscal year (June 30th) for 1861, the Treasurer\r\nreported the debt of the United States to be $90,867,828. On the 31st of\r\nMarch, 1865, the Treasurer reported the public debt of the United\r\nStates to be $2,423,437,001, showing an increase during the war of\r\n$2,332,567,173. This increase of debt of the general government by no\r\nmeans represents the sum-total cost of the war; for, meanwhile, the\r\npeople had been paying immensely increased taxes every year, and beside\r\nthis every State, every county, every large city, and almost every\r\ntownship of the North had been issuing bonds with which to pay bounties\r\nand other war expenses, so that in 1865 the amount of bounties paid\r\nby States and local authorities, so far as returned to the general\r\ngovernment, amounted to $285,941,036. Add this to the government\r\ndebt and you have the sum of $2,709,378,037. It is difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, for any mind to really comprehend so large a sum, and\r\nthe only way to appreciate it is to divide it among families, or\r\nindividualize it. In 1860 the United States census returns show for the\r\neighteen Northern States 18,855,831. In 1870 the returns show for the\r\nsame States 24,035,359. There being no census returns for 1865 (as the\r\nUnited States census is only taken at the close of each ten years), the\r\nonly way to approximate the population then is to divide the increase\r\nbetween 1860 and 1870. This indicates a population in these eighteen\r\nStates for 1865 to have been about 21,445,595. Now the average estimate\r\nfor each family is five. This would give us 4,289,119 families as\r\nexisting in these States at that time. Next, divide the number of\r\nfamilies into the number of dollars of public debt, and you show\r\nthat upon each family was saddled, at the close of the war, a debt of\r\n$631.68. Or, to individualize it, divide this sum by five, and you have\r\nthe sum of $126.33 as the average debt then owing by every mart, woman,\r\nand child then residing in the eighteen Northern States. Thus, it\r\nmattered not how poor a man was, or how many children he had, a ticket\r\nof indebtedness for the sum of $126.33 was plastered on the forehead of\r\neach. \"Oh, well,\" some one may say, \"that was easy enough for rich men\r\nto pay, and of course the poor never paid it, nor never will, since many\r\nof the very poor never handle as much money as that in all their lives.\r\nWhy, to a man with ten children (and the poor, you know, generally have\r\nthe most) that would have made a debt of $1515.96, which of course he\r\ncould never pay, in addition to supporting his family.\" Ah! but, my\r\nfriend, there is just where you are most mistaken; for it is just\r\nthat class of men, together with farmers, who do pay much the larger\r\nproportion of public debts. True, they never pay it, nor would try to\r\npay it, in dollars and cents to the tax-gatherer; but they pay it in the\r\nincreased price they pay the merchant for the tea and coffee they drink,\r\nfor the muslins and woollens, and hats and shoes they wear; they pay it\r\nin increased rents and decreased wages; and the farmer pays it not\r\nonly in every article that he purchases, but in increased taxes and in\r\ndecreased receipts for what he raises to sell. And what these fail\r\nto pay, the rich have to pay in increased taxes for State, county,\r\ntownship, or municipal purposes.\r\n\r\nNow let us apply these facts to the solving of the problem (third)--How\r\nmuch additional did it cost?\r\n\r\nThis we can only do approximately by stating the problem thus: If\r\nto bring into the field 2,688,523 men for forty-seven months cost\r\n$2,709,378,037, how much would it have cost to bring in 75,000 for three\r\nmonths? Deduct this sum, amounting to $4,824,369 from the whole cost,\r\nand we have remaining the sum of $2,704,553,668 as the additional\r\ncost of the war because of the secret machinations and most desperate\r\nvillanies described in the previous chapters of this book--every dollar\r\nof which, every penny of which, is justly chargeable to the Democratic\r\nparty as a party. Or, to make the matter still plainer, more than\r\nthree-fourths of all the taxes which the poor man, or farmer, or rich\r\nman has heretofore paid, or will hereafter pay, whether upon what he\r\neats and drinks and wears, or upon cash paid tax-collector, is directly\r\nchargeable to the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nIV. How many additional lives were sacrificed? This, like the last\r\nquestion, can only be answered approximately, and by the same process of\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nThe reports made to the War Department, during the war, show the total\r\nloss to have been 280,420 men--the very sight of which figures makes\r\nthe heart sink in agony and sicken over the thought, and yet there is no\r\nescaping their terrible reality.\r\n\r\nTo get at the additional sacrifice, the proposition may be stated thus:\r\nIf in a war lasting forty-seven months, with 2,688,523 men in service\r\n(of whom 1,500,000 it is estimated were in battles), the sacrifice of\r\nlife amounted to 280,420 men, what would have been the sacrifice had the\r\nwar lasted only three months, with 75,000 men in service? The answer to\r\nthis problem is 499 lives. Now take this number from the former, and\r\nyou have as the additional number 279,921 lives--the loss of which is as\r\nfairly attributable to the Democratic party as though it had by sentence\r\ncondemned, and by its own power had executed, every one of these men.\r\n\r\nThe remains of thousands and tens of thousands who died in the service\r\nnever were gathered, but to-day lie in Southern swamps, scattered\r\nover Southern cotton-fields, or at the bottom of the deep, blue sea,\r\n\"unknown, unhonored, and unwept;\" but the remains of other thousands and\r\ntens of thousands have been gathered, and now lie in National cemeteries\r\nat Arlington Heights, at Gettysburg, at Antietam, at Beverly, and at\r\nmany other places throughout the length and breadth of our land.\r\nThe above calculations show--and figures never lie when correctly\r\nplaced--that if upon ninety-five out of every one hundred headstones\r\nerected to the memory of these departed heroes in the National and\r\nprivate cemeteries of our country were written the words, _Died by the\r\nhands of the Democratic party_, the record would be as true as anything\r\nnow written upon those headstones.\r\n\r\nWe are fully aware of the terrible character of this indictment. We know\r\nalready how many thousands will hold up their hands in holy horror and\r\nexclaim, Oh, this cannot be so! These are not the words of a historian,\r\nbut of a politician, who allows his prejudices to get the better of his\r\nreason! But hold, my friend, hold, and think twice before you\r\ncondemn once. Are they not words of truth and soberness? Examine each\r\nproposition just as carefully as you would examine one of Euclid's\r\nproblems (for this is just what we have tried to do), and see if it is\r\npossible to reach any other conclusion. Republican though we certainly\r\nare, yet, in examining these questions as a historian, we have tried to\r\ndivest our mind of every particle of political prejudice, and though\r\nthe results of our researches and calculations are as astounding, as\r\nterrible, as sickening-of-heart to us as they can possibly be to any one\r\nof our readers, yet the figures would show no other, and we have had to\r\naccept them as veritable.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the secret is only half out--the story, as yet, but half told.\r\nThe losses of time, of money, and of lives heretofore spoken of relate\r\nonly to the North--the Southern side of the story remains yet to be\r\ntold; for in this volume we are writing no less for the information of\r\nSouthern than of Northern men, nor would we in this record do any less\r\njustice to the South than to the North.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis, however wild and mistaken politically, was never other\r\nthan a high-minded, chivalrous gentleman. He was just as honest in his\r\nadvocacy of slavery as Paul was in his advocacy of Phariseeism; and\r\nwhen Davis went forth to catch, imprison, and, if need be, to slay the\r\nenemies of slavery, he did it as conscientiously as Paul did, or\r\nmeant to do, his work, in going to Damascus with the commission of a\r\nhigh-priest in his pocket Not only so, but President Davis was a man of\r\ndeep knowledge, a thorough statistician, a cool calculator, and one who\r\nnever took a step without first carefully counting the cost. He was the\r\nfarthest possible remove from a reckless man. When a young man in the\r\nUnited States army and with the troops in Mexico, he never struck a\r\nblow, or made the least move, without first considering all the chances.\r\nIn this respect he was almost as careful and as prudent as his renowned\r\nfather-in-law, General Zachary Taylor. As a United States Senator he was\r\nremarkable for his caution and foresight, and though he sometimes took\r\npart in sharp debate, his general political tactics were conservative,\r\nwatch for chances, investigate thoroughly, and then strike with effect.\r\n\r\nNow, we have it only second-handed from President Davis's own lips that\r\nhe would never have thought of a war with the North--never would have\r\nrecommended such a war--never would have engaged in such a war--\"_but\r\nfor encouragement given him, and actual pledges made him, by leading\r\nDemocrats of the Northern States_.\" He had once been Secretary of War;\r\nhe had been a United States Senator for several years preceding the\r\nrebellion; he thoroughly understood the resources, not only of the\r\ngeneral government, but of each individual State, and would, as he\r\nsaid, have thought it perfect madness for the South to have attempted a\r\nseparate confederation, \"_but for the pledges of assistance made him\r\nand others by leading Democrats of the Northern States_.\" Of this, as\r\nan historical fact, there is no more doubt than that there was a war.\r\nOutside of President Davis's own word, the facts heretofore related\r\nin this volume, and a thousand others which might be adduced, are\r\nconfirmatory of these statements. .\r\n\r\nAgain, the men whom President Davis had about him as a Cabinet and as\r\noutside advisers were generally men of marked intelligence and large\r\nexperience, one of whom (John Tyler) had been President of the United\r\nStates; some had been United States Senators; others, Congressmen;\r\nothers had all their lives been connected with the army or navy; and\r\nscarcely one of all but what thoroughly understood the strength and\r\nresources, not only of the general government, but of each State, North\r\nand South. Is it to be presumed that a single one of these men would\r\nhave ever thought of rebellion, or said one word to encourage it, _but\r\nfor the assurances they had from leading Northern Democrats that the\r\nparty, as a party, would sustain them in such a movement?_\r\n\r\nIf these facts be admitted, and this inference be conceded, does it\r\nnot follow as an inevitable conclusion that the _Democratic party, as a\r\nparty_, is responsible before God, and should be held responsible before\r\nall men, for the _time wasted, the money squandered, and the lives\r\nsacrificed_ by the South in their attempt to establish a separate\r\nconfederacy?\r\n\r\nWe cannot give the exact figures, for the archives of the Confederate\r\ngovernment were mostly destroyed when the rebels fled and the Union army\r\ntook possession of Richmond; but think, reader, think how many weary\r\ndays, and weeks, and months, and years of untold suffering that was\r\ncaused by that mad and murderous attempt; think of the houses burned,\r\nhomes desolated, plantations ruined, by the frenzy and fury of reckless\r\ndemagogues; think of the thousands of affluent families made homeless\r\nand penniless by this mad attempt, and of the thousands upon thousands\r\nwho were once comfortable now turned out as beggars to die, through the\r\nefforts of a band of conspirators; think of the millions upon millions\r\nof hard-earned dollars squandered, worse than squandered, by this mad\r\nattempt; think of the thousands upon thousands of wives made widows,\r\nchildren made fatherless, parents made childless, by this foul treason;\r\nand then think--for if you are honest with your own conscience, and can\r\nrid yourself of political prejudice, you must think it--that all this\r\nwaste of time, all this squandering of money, all this sacrifice\r\nof lives, all this suffering of wives, of children, of parents, _is\r\nunquestionably chargeable_ to the _Democratic party;_ and, with this\r\nlast thought, ask yourself the question, What should be thought of--what\r\nshould be the fate of--a party guilty of such unparalleled wickedness?\r\n\r\nOf course, to this last question there could be but one answer, and yet\r\nthe party feebly lives! Why it lives--for what purpose it lives--would\r\nbe the next question which would naturally arise with every searcher\r\nafter truth. To these inquiries we will try to give an answer, not an\r\nopinion merely, but an answer founded upon accredited history, as have\r\nbeen all the answers heretofore given.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to every student of history that, as far back as 1817,\r\nthe leading sovereigns and princes of Europe, in their solemn conclaves\r\nand secret treaties with each other, formed the determination to subvert\r\nthe liberties of the United States. Much of what was said and done at\r\nthat time leaked out, and was duly communicated by our ministers and\r\nconsuls abroad to the general government; but so conscious was our\r\ngovernment of its own strength in the hearts of the people, that all\r\nsuch threats passed them by like the idle wind. When, however, the Duke\r\nof Richmond died in Montreal in 1819--a man whom everybody knew to be a\r\nsagacious and wise statesman, and whose many high employments had made\r\nhim intimate with all the sovereigns and politics of Europe, and\r\nwhose deep personal interests at stake gave to his opinions immense\r\nweight--and when he declared, a short time before his death, that \"The\r\nsurplus population of Europe, when not wanted for the armies and navies\r\nof their own land, would be permitted to flock here, and would be\r\nentitled to vote; and, mingling in the elections without a knowledge or\r\na love of the laws, or even the language, of the country, will be tools\r\nfor demagogues, and create a disturbing influence, which the government\r\ncannot withstand;\" and when to this he added, \"I have conversed with\r\nmany of the princes and sovereigns of Europe, particularly with George\r\nIII. and Louis XVIII., and they have unanimously expressed these\r\nopinions relative to the government of the United States, and their\r\ndetermination to subvert it\"--when, we say, these were published and\r\nbecame generally known shortly after his death, they did for a little\r\nwhile create some excitement, and both government officials and the\r\npeople had something to say about these statements; but such was the\r\nconfidence felt in our own strength, that the words of the Duke were\r\nsoon forgotten, and were laid away with the \"mouldering past.\"\r\n\r\nOnly three years thereafter (in A. d. 1822) the great powers of Europe\r\nheld a congress at Vienna, and among the conclusions then and there\r\nreached, and which formed a part of their treaty stipulations, the two\r\nfollowing cannot but strike Americans with great force:\r\n\r\n\"Article I. The high contracting powers being convinced that the\r\nsystem of representative governments is equally as incompatible with\r\nmonarchical principles, as the maxim of the sovereignty of the people\r\nwith the divine right of kings, engage mutually, in the most solemn\r\nmanner, to use all their efforts to put an end to the system of\r\nrepresentative governments in Europe, and to prevent its being\r\nintroduced into those countries where it is not known.\r\n\r\n\"Article II. As it cannot be doubted that the liberty of the press is\r\nthe most powerful means used by the pretended supporters of the rights\r\nof nations to the detriment of those princes, the high contracting\r\npowers promise reciprocally to adopt all proper means to suppress it.\"\r\n\r\nThe representatives of this government in Europe got hold of these\r\narticles soon after, and duly communicated them to the State Department\r\nat Washington; and the newspapers of this country also got hold of\r\nthem, and for awhile had considerable to say about them; but erelong the\r\nexcitement of both government and people died out, and things went on in\r\ntheir usual way. How many times since then the powers of Europe have\r\nmet in secret conclave and reaffirmed what they then said, and adopted\r\nsecret measures whereby to carry out these resolves, is not generally\r\nknown, for the reason that the excitement following their first\r\npromulgation gave them warning that whatever they said or did in that\r\ndirection thereafter had better be with closed doors, and under the most\r\nsacred pledges of profound secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe congress at Vienna was held soon after they had lodged the First\r\nNapoleon safely at St. Helena, and when all the world seemed to be\r\napplauding them for the act, and hence their outspoken boldness in\r\ndenouncing representative forms of government and the liberty of the\r\npress. Indeed, in view of what they had all just witnessed, and some of\r\nthem severely felt, it was not at all unnatural that they should have\r\nadopted the two articles quoted; and that they should have ever since\r\nfelt that there was an irrepressible conflict between the \"divine right\r\nof kings\" and representative forms of government--between the absolute\r\nrule of kings and the liberty of the press, and that one or the other\r\nmust eventually supersede the other. Hence, with them it became a\r\nquestion of self preservation--the very first law of nature--and under\r\nsuch circumstances it was not at all wonderful that they resolved just\r\nas they did.\r\n\r\nThey had recently witnessed the final act of a French drama and tragedy\r\ncombined--the French Revolution, and the career of Napoleon as a\r\nconsequence thereof--which they regarded as results of a representative\r\nform of government and of the liberty of the press; but which were\r\nresults rather of irresponsible personal government and license of the\r\npress. They had seen or read of the assembling of a French parliament\r\nthat had refused to register the royal edicts; they had witnessed or\r\nread of the disputes between the king and parliament, and the death soon\r\nafter of Louis XV.; from thence they had observed the spread of liberal\r\nopinions and the accession of Louis XVI. to the throne of France; next,\r\nthey had seen or read of the calling together of the States-General, and\r\nhow they, soon after assembling, had assumed the name of the \"National\r\nAssembly;\" they knew of the dismissal of Neckar; the destruction of the\r\nBastile; the abolishment of the privileges of the nobles and clergy,\r\nand of the first insult offered to the king and royal family; of\r\nRobespierre's government and the dreadful disorders accompanying it; of\r\nLafayette's resignation; of the trial and execution of Louis XVI. and\r\nof his queen, Marie Antoinette, and of the Duke of Orleans; of the\r\nConvention's abjuration of the Catholic religion and substitution of\r\nreason in its place; of the abolition of the Sabbath; of the tens of\r\nthousands beheaded, or otherwise slaughtered, in Paris; of how Napoleon\r\nBonaparte had finally appeared upon the scene, and for a while seemed\r\nto still the troubled waters; but how he erelong not only usurped the\r\ncrown, but commenced war upon almost every nation of Europe; how in a\r\nhundred battles fought by him, at Austerlitz and elsewhere, he had been\r\nsuccessful in almost every one; how he had finally invaded Russia and\r\nthus defeated himself; how he was afterwards made to resign and sent in\r\nbanishment to Elba; how he had again reappeared in France and resumed\r\npower; how all the allied powers of Europe then determined upon his\r\ndestruction; how he was defeated at the battle of Waterloo; how he\r\nafterwards surrendered himself into the hands of the English; and how,\r\non the 17th of October, 1815, he was landed at St. Helena a prisoner of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nAll this they knew, and all this they set down as the natural results\r\nof a representative form of government and the liberty of the press, and\r\nhence it was that the first two articles of the treaty, from which we\r\nhave heretofore quoted, were specially aimed against them; and a solemn\r\npledge made, each to the other, that they must be destroyed. Of course,\r\nno mention was made in that treaty of the United States; for to have\r\ndone so would have been virtually a declaration of war; but as it was\r\nthen generally believed among the sovereigns and princes of Europe that\r\nthe French Revolution of 1789 was a natural outgrowth from the\r\nAmerican Revolution of 1776, and that Lafayette was at the bottom of it\r\nall--having imbibed the ideas from George Washington, John Adams, John\r\nHancock, and other revolutionists of America,--the inference is plain\r\nand unmistakable that those two articles were aimed at the United\r\nStates, and that the word \"Europe\"--where it reads they \"engage\r\nmutually, in the most solemn manner, to use all their efforts to put\r\nan end to the system of representative governments in Europe\"--was only\r\nmeant as a blinder.\r\n\r\nBut, it may next be asked, allowing all this to be so, have they been\r\ndoing anything since that time whereby to carry out any such intention?\r\n\r\nTo this inquiry, we answer yes, and will now proceed to show, briefly\r\nbut unmistakably, how they have been carrying out such intentions; and\r\nthis, too, comes legitimately under the head of \"Secrets of the Late\r\nRebellion, now Revealed for the First Time,\" since no one, to our\r\nknowledge, has ever heretofore shown the close relationship and unity of\r\npurpose between these same European governments and the Democratic\r\nparty of the United States; and how, in the late rebellion (as in\r\nmany instances before that time), they joined hands to destroy this\r\ngovernment, and to break down the liberty of the press.\r\n\r\nThe first two political parties in the United States were known as\r\n_Federal_ and _Republican_. In 1800, John Adams was the candidate of\r\nthe Federalists for a second presidential term, and Thomas Jefferson the\r\ncandidate of the Republicans. Jefferson was elected, and took his seat\r\nas President of the United States on the 4th of March, 1801. After a\r\ntime, these two names gave way to Whig and Democratic. These continued\r\nuntil the name Republican took the place of Whig, in 1856-60. In its\r\nearlier days the Democratic party, as a party, was as pure and patriotic\r\nas any party that ever existed in this or any other country; but when\r\nthe question of \"Protection to Home Industry\" (of which Henry Clay was\r\nthe leading champion in his time) became a prime question in American\r\npolitics; and when, because that this question involved the interests\r\nof European capitalists and manufacturers, Augustus Belmont, of New York\r\ncity (a European by birth, a Jew, and the agent in this country of the\r\nRothschilds', the great Jew banking-house of Europe, to whom almost\r\nevery sovereign in Europe was indebted for loans), became the Chairman\r\nof the National Democratic Executive Committee--from that moment the\r\nDemocratic party, as a party, became as completely in the interests of\r\nEuropean sovereigns, capitalists, and manufacturers, as though every\r\nmember of the party, as well as its head and front, had been born\r\na European. We are not, of course, attempting to write a history of\r\nparties. To do so would require a volume of itself, and a large one at\r\nthat. We have only made this running sketch that those not familiar\r\nwith general history may readily see and understand the unmistakable\r\nhistorical relationship which exists, and which has existed for some\r\nforty years past, between the Democratic party, as a party, and European\r\ngovernments, European capitalists, and European manufacturers.\r\n\r\nWith this fact in mind, it is easy to understand why ninety out of\r\nevery one hundred European emigrants who come to this country attach\r\nthemselves to the Democratic party; easy to understand why the\r\nentire influence of the Roman Catholic Church (which is the church of\r\nnine-tenths of the sovereigns of Europe) should be thrown in favor of\r\nthe Democratic party; easy to understand why more than ninety-five out\r\nof every one hundred Jews who come to this country from Europe attach\r\nthemselves to the Democratic party; and easy to understand why, in\r\nthe late rebellion, the Democratic party, as a party, cooperated with\r\nEnglish lords, with English capitalists, and with English manufacturers\r\n(as shown in previous chapters of this volume), in trying to break down\r\nthis government, and establish a slaveocracy in its stead--the leaders\r\n(not the masses) well knowing that this would soon give way to a yet\r\nmore concentrated form of government in order to hold their slaves\r\nin subjection--neither a landed and family aristocracy, like that of\r\nEngland, or an absolute monarchy, like that of Austria, in either of\r\nwhich cases a representative or republican form of government and the\r\nliberty of the press would have been effectually and forever suppressed.\r\n\r\nThe answer, then, to the two questions, Why it lives? For what purpose\r\nit lives? are, to the first, Because of the additions made to the party\r\nfrom year to year from foreign emigration; and to the second the answer\r\nis, For the purpose of playing into the hands of European sovereigns,\r\nEuropean capitalists, and European manufacturers, with a view to set\r\naside a representative form of government, and destroy the liberty\r\nof the press in this country; and these answers we give, it will\r\nbe observed, not from a political, but from a historical,\r\nstand-point--facts which cannot be controverted, and deductions from\r\nthose facts as natural and as undeniable as that we know arsenic to be\r\na poison, because it invariably kills when taken in certain doses. And\r\nthat the Democratic party, as a party, is as deadly a poison as arsenic\r\nwe know to be true, because it has killed its thousands and tens of\r\nthousands, than which we want no other or better proof than is furnished\r\nby the preceding chapters of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. WHY THE SOUTH HAS NOT DENOUNCED THE DEMOCRATIC\r\nPARTY--WHAT KEEPS THE PARTY ALIVE--WHAT THE FINAL END OF THIS REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n|THREE more questions, please, and then I will not trouble you more.\r\nWhat you have already said seems to be true, and yet so new and so\r\nstrange are these revelations to my ears--stranger than any fiction I\r\never read in the works of Sir Walter Scott or others--that had you not\r\nsubstantiated each proposition with arguments drawn from antecedent\r\nprobability, from sign, and from example, I could scarcely have believed\r\nthem. But three queries yet remain in my mind. Allowing all that you\r\nhave said to be veritable history, how comes it that the South has not\r\ndenounced the Democratic party for its perfidy in making promises which\r\nit never fulfilled? How comes it that, with such a weight of sin upon\r\nit, the party can still be kept alive? And, from all your study of\r\nhistory, what deductions do you draw as to the final decline and\r\nfall--if such a thing is to be--of this Republic?\r\n\r\nYour questions are plain, frank, yet pointed, and I will endeavor to\r\nanswer each in as plain and frank a manner. First, as to the truth of\r\nwhat we have already said, if the statements and propositions related\r\nto any other than a political subject, there would be no more doubt of\r\ntheir truthfulness than of any statement or proposition made by Gibbon,\r\nMacaulay, Bancroft, or any other historian. But upon the two subjects\r\nof politics and religion, men are generally so set in their opinion that\r\nblindness in the one and bigotry in the other seems to be as natural to\r\nthe human mind \"as for grass to be green, or skies to be blue, on\r\nbright clear days in June.\" Nor are such statements ever allowed to go\r\nunchallenged, however true they may be, unless the parties have been\r\nso long dead and buried that no sympathy remains. What Macaulay says of\r\npolitical parties and of church influences in his _History of England,_\r\nis just as true as any other part of his admirable work, and yet the\r\nwork had scarcely made its appearance before the most violent epithets\r\nwere hurled at him because of these. Had Gibbon written his Decline and\r\nFall of the Roman Empire ten or even five centuries earlier, it would\r\nhave received most bitter denunciation from all who yet sympathized with\r\nthe wrongs which Gibbon pointed out, and even so late as the eighteenth\r\ncentury, when his work was first published, it did not escape censure.\r\nWhile Bancroft only wrote of the long, long ago, in his capital History\r\nof the United States, nobody questioned his statements or deductions;\r\nbut as he approached nearer to the present, and had of necessity to\r\nsay something of the acts and influence of political parties and of\r\nchurches, he awoke the sleeping demons--blindness and bigotry--and from\r\nthenceforth there was more or less growl whenever a new volume appeared.\r\nI revive and mention these facts now, only to show you, my friend, that\r\nI am not at all surprised at your inquiries; nor shall I be surprised if\r\nthe last six chapters of this volume, and, because of these, the whole\r\nbook, are most violently and bitterly denounced by the entire Democratic\r\npress of this country, and by every religious and political journal in\r\nthis country and Europe whose special province it is to uphold foreign\r\nreligious and political influence. With these as introductory remarks, I\r\nwill now proceed to answer your inquiries.\r\n\r\n1. How comes it that the South has not denounced the Democratic party\r\nfor its perfidy in making promises which it never fulfilled?\r\n\r\nWe have no sympathy now, and never had, with rebellion, as such; and,\r\nwhile it continued, helped to fight it as best we could; but we had\r\nthen, and have now, a very deep sympathy with those who were blindly led\r\nto their own destruction by wicked, designing men. To no people in all\r\nof history are the words of our blessed Saviour more applicable than to\r\nthe people of the South, when he said, \"Woe unto the world because of\r\noffences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man\r\nby whom the offence cometh!\"\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore spoken of Jefferson Davis, his Cabinet, and of\r\nothers with whom he advised, as high-minded, honorable gentlemen. This\r\ncharacter they had before the war, maintained it during the war, and\r\nsuch as survived continued to maintain it after the war. After the war,\r\nMr. Davis had but little to say of the events of the past. He preferred\r\nnot to talk of them at all, as he often said to those who broached the\r\nsubject, and never would talk of them except to his most confidential\r\nfriends. He desired to live a quiet, peaceful, retired, Christian life,\r\nin the bosom of his little family (and no man ever had a truer or more\r\nfaithful helpmeet than Mrs. Davis proved to be to her husband), nor\r\nwould he allow himself to talk of politics at all, as before stated,\r\nexcept to a very few. From one of these few we have it, as from Mr.\r\nDavis's own lips, that no one felt, nor could feel, more keenly than he\r\ndid, the perfidy, the meanness, the baseness which had been practised\r\nupon the South by certain leading Democratic politicians of the North;\r\nand yet he could not but recollect that others, as they had opportunity,\r\nhad aided him and their cause to the full extent of their ability, and\r\nhad the will to aid them a thousand times more, if they could have done\r\nso with safety to themselves, personally and pecuniarily. This last\r\nrecollection took the keen edge off the first, and left a sort of\r\ndulcamara--a bitter-sweet--to rest upon his mind.\r\n\r\nAnd, besides this, only a choice of evils was left to him and his\r\nfollowers. Their own party of Secession having been destroyed, only the\r\nDemocratic and Republican parties remained. To side with or go into the\r\nRepublican party was out of the question. Such as did, would be charged\r\nwith, or suspected of, treachery by both sides. To denounce and yet\r\nexpect to get into, or cooperate with, the Democratic party, was out of\r\nthe question. No one can regard as a friend one that curses him. So, you\r\nsee, they were walled in, as it were, on every side, and, as a choice of\r\nevils, thought it best to go into the Democratic party--to which most\r\nof them had belonged all their lives, previous to the rebellion--to hold\r\ntheir peace, and to \"wait for the good time coming which the voice of\r\ncertain siren leaders still whispered into their ears. We say this not\r\nin a poetic, but in a historic sense; for we know it to be true that,\r\nafter the close of the rebellion, prominent leaders of the Democratic\r\nparty North said to prominent gentlemen of the South that so soon as\r\nthey could get the general government once again into their own hands,\r\nall Southern claims upon the government, because of the war, should be\r\nadjusted, the same as Northern claims had been; all bonds issued by the\r\nConfederate government during the war should be placed upon precisely\r\nthe same footing as the bonds issued by the United States government\r\nduring the same period; and that slavery should be restored as it\r\nwas before the war, or those who had owned slaves, or their legal\r\nrepresentatives, should be paid full value for every slave they had\r\nlost. When it was said to them that to do all this would require several\r\nalterations in the United States Constitution as it now stands, their\r\nready reply was, \"Only put the government into our hands, and we'll find\r\nmeans to amend the Constitution just as readily as to make laws, for\r\nall needed purposes. Your wrongs and ours will find a way, or make\r\none!\" With such assurances, made over and over again in the most solemn\r\nmanner, how could a Southern man find it in his heart to denounce the\r\nDemocratic party, notwithstanding all the wrongs he had suffered from\r\nit?\r\n\r\nSome seventeen years have now passed since the close of that war. As a\r\nmatter of history it is well known that over ninety-five per cent, of\r\nthose who had taken an active part in the Confederate cause went into\r\nthe Democratic party, and since that time have steadily cooperated with\r\nthat party. A few, a very few, could not, as they said, forgive the\r\ntreachery and the wrongs of the Democratic party towards the South, and\r\nthese went into the Republican party--some honestly, no doubt; others,\r\nonly because they thought it would \"pay best.\"\r\n\r\nAnother answer to your query would be, that in not denouncing, but by\r\ngoing into, the Democratic party a very large proportion of Southern men\r\nwere only returning to their first love. In the days of Whiggery several\r\nof the Southern States gave Whig majorities; but when that party died,\r\nbecause of its coquetting with slavery, and the Republican party took\r\nits place, the leading principle of which new party was opposition to\r\nslavery, first, as to its extension, and then as to its continuance,\r\nnearly the whole vote of the South became Democratic. This was very\r\nplainly shown in the vote cast for Franklin Pierce and Winfield Scott\r\n(the last Whig candidate), in 1852, when the former received two hundred\r\nand fifty-four electoral votes and the latter only forty-two. Indeed, it\r\nwas this fact, and the great preponderance of Democratic votes at\r\nthat election, that gave to the Secessionists of the South, and their\r\nsympathizers, aiders, and abettors of the North, the encouragement which\r\ncaused them to inaugurate a rebellion in 1860. It was this, together\r\nwith the fact that out of the thirty-two preceding years--from the\r\nelection of Jackson in 1828 to that of Lincoln in 1860--the Democrats\r\nhad held the power twenty-four years and the Whigs only eight. They\r\nhad grown to look upon the Democratic power as invincible, and their\r\nEuropean coadjutors had been made to believe that the time had finally\r\ncome when the hated representative form of the United States government\r\ncould be changed into a slaveocracy, then into an aristocracy, and then\r\ninto a kingly form of government; while a censorship could be placed\r\nupon the press so effectual, that from thenceforth it could never do\r\nEuropean sovereignties or the Roman Catholic Church any harm. Those\r\nwho only saw the outside of the late rebellion supposed that it had its\r\nincipiency in 1860, whereas those who knew of its inside workings (as we\r\nall know now), knew that preparations had been going on for eight years\r\nprevious, and that both Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan, from 1852\r\nto 1860, had only been used as tools or instruments by which to forward\r\nthese preparations. The result of the Presidential vote in 1856 only\r\nmade those in the secret of the secession movement (both in this country\r\nand in Europe) the more determined to strike the blow in 1860; for they\r\nsaw by that vote that, while their candidate, Buchanan, was elected by\r\na majority of fifty-two electoral votes (Buchanan one hundred and\r\nseventy-four, Fremont et al. one hundred and twenty-two), yet the\r\npopular vote stood Buchanan 1,838,169, Fremont et al. 2,215,498, being\r\nreally against their candidate, on the popular vote, to the extent of\r\n377,329 votes. This strange result was owing to the fact that, while\r\nall the Southern States voted for their candidate, and several Northern\r\nStates as well, they were all by small majorities; whereas such of\r\nthe Northern States as voted for Fremont and others did so by large\r\nmajorities. Had they delayed the strike another four years, it would\r\nhave been forever too late.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the secret commenced to ooze out among the masses, it caused\r\nno little commotion in the Democratic party itself, and when they came\r\nto name presidential candidates in 1860, while those in the secret\r\nboldly put forward John C. Breckenridge (who afterwards became a rebel\r\ngeneral in their army), the more timid and doubting named Stephen A.\r\nDouglas, while those who were yet more frightened at the prospect of\r\ncoming events named Bell of Tennessee. The Republicans named Abraham\r\nLincoln. The result showed one hundred and eighty electoral votes for\r\nLincoln and one hundred and twenty-three for all the others (again the\r\nSouth voting solid against the Republican nominee), while the popular\r\nvote showed 1,866,352 for Lincoln, and 2,810,501 for all the others. The\r\nSouth by that time became so thoroughly identified with the Democratic\r\nparty, and the Democratic party with the South, that, like man and wife,\r\ntheir interests were thenceforth inseparable, while the groomsman and\r\nbridesmaid (fitly represented by European sovereignty and the Roman\r\nCatholic Church) stood at their sides, or close behind, tapping them on\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\nAnd just here let us say, lest we may be misunderstood, that when we\r\nspeak of the Catholic Church it is not by way of disparagement, so\r\nfar as their religion is concerned, but only and purely as one of the\r\ninstruments by which European sovereigns hope to work the downfall of\r\nthis nation, or rather of the representative form of its government and\r\nthe liberty of its press. Against the religious faith and the religious\r\nzeal of the Catholics we have not a word to say, though ourself a\r\nProtestant. History, as well as our own eyes and ears while travelling\r\nin Europe, has proven to us that with every ounce of corruption to be\r\nfound in that Church there is a full pound of virtue, and, better\r\nthan this, so far as we know, cannot be said of any other church\r\norganization. We cannot forget, nor overlook the facts, that while\r\nTetzel was peddling indulgences and Luther was thundering against them,\r\nthousands of Sisters of Charity (God bless them!) were waiting upon the\r\nsick and dying in Paris and elsewhere, and doing what they could to make\r\nlife tolerable and death endurable to thousands and tens of thousands;\r\nthat while scores were being tortured and burned by the Spanish\r\ninquisition, thousands of faithful Catholic missionaries, in all parts\r\nof the world, were enlightening their fellow-men, easing their burdens\r\nof life, and pointing them to a hope beyond the grave. Nor can we\r\noverlook the fact that other religious bodies have been just as bigoted\r\nand just as intolerant as the Catholics, whenever they have had the\r\npower and opportunity; that John Calvin and his followers burned\r\nServetus, at Geneva, with just as little compunction of conscience as\r\nthe Catholics burned Huss at Constance; that Luther and his coadjutors\r\ngranted to Philip, the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, a dispensation for\r\npolygamy, rather than lose his support, while Clement VII., Pope of\r\nRome, refused a like dispensation to Henry VIII., King of England; that\r\nthis same Henry, who was acknowledged at the time as the head of the\r\nChurch of England, divorced two wives and beheaded two others; and that\r\neven here, in our own New England, when the Puritans had absolute power,\r\nthey ordered delicate Quaker women tied to a cart-tail and whipped upon\r\nthe bare back, and others hung, for no other reason than that they chose\r\nto worship God in a different way from themselves. A somewhat careful\r\nstudy of the rise and progress of all religions, and of all religious\r\nsects, convinces us that bigotry, intolerance, and persecution are\r\nalike common to all whenever they hold absolute power, and that in this\r\nrespect the Catholics are no worse than others.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, while saying all this, no less in justice to ourself than to\r\nthem, we must not overlook the fact that Catholicism is the religion\r\nof a large majority of the sovereigns and princes of Europe; that\r\nabsolutism (and consequent opposition to anything like a representative\r\nform of government, or the liberty of the press) is one of its cardinal\r\nprinciples of faith and practice; that, being so largely supported by\r\nEuropean sovereigns, it would naturally be disposed to aid them in\r\nany way within its power; and that to aid them in overthrowing our\r\nrepresentative form of government, and our boasted liberty of the press,\r\nwould be no violation of their own cherished principles, but in exact\r\naccordance therewith. Hence in all our calculations as to influence and\r\npower, without having the least prejudice against the religion of the\r\nCatholics, we must invariably put them down as in favor of absolutism,\r\nand as only using, in this country, the name democracy (which means the\r\nreverse of absolutism) as a cloak to their real sentiments. Of course in\r\nthis we only refer to the bishops, priests, and few educated laymen of\r\nthe Catholic Church; for, as to the great mass of its adherents, they\r\nmerely follow the dictum of others, without knowing or caring about the\r\nmeaning of names, and would vote under any name, or for anybody, if only\r\ntold to do so by their church officials.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of public notoriety--indeed of public record--that, under\r\nthe name of \"Societies for the Propagation of the Faith,\" the sovereigns\r\nof Europe, and their more wealthy subjects, have sent, and are every\r\nyear sending, large sums of money to this country. A single one of these\r\nsocieties at Lyons, France (as published in their own reports at the\r\ntime), sent in this way $65,438 in 1839; $163,000 in 1840; $177,000 in\r\n1842; $207,218 in 1843, while correspondingly large sums were doubtless\r\nsent from Spain, Austria, and other European countries during the same\r\nyears; and from that time until the present every year. A portion of\r\nthis was and is undoubtedly contributed from the purest of religious\r\nmotives; but by far the larger portion, only with the view to subvert\r\nour representative form of government and the liberty of the press. 'All\r\nthese are matters of history, and as such come legitimately within the\r\nprovince of any historian, and of any reader, who, aside from religious\r\nor political prejudices, would carefully weigh facts with a view to\r\narrive at undoubted conclusions.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, my friend (the reader), have we, by reciting historic facts,\r\nand through the processes of deduction and induction, shown you very\r\nplainly \"How it comes that the South has not denounced the Democratic\r\nparty for its perfidy in making promises which it never fulfilled;\" and\r\nthus, my friend, I have, I think, fully and fairly answered your first\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0317]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. -- II.--HOW COMES IT THAT THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, WITH SUCH A\r\nWEIGHT OF SIN UPON IT, CAN STILL BE KEPT ALIVE?\r\n\r\n|TO answer this question, we would first direct your attention to the\r\nUnited States census returns for the years 1850,'60,'70, and 80. We only\r\ngo back four decades, for from these we can draw correct conclusions\r\njust as well as if we commenced at an earlier date. These returns show\r\nthat for the ten years preceding 1850 there arrived in this country from\r\nEurope 1,713,251 persons; for the ten preceding 1860, 2,598,214; for\r\nthe ten preceding 1870, 2,491,209; and for the ten preceding 1880,\r\n2,742,137. Of those that came from Catholic countries, 95 out of every\r\n100 went into the Democratic party. Of those that came from Germany\r\nand other Protestant countries, probably about one-half went into the\r\nDemocratic party; for even though they came from nominally Protestant\r\ncountries, fully one-half of the emigrants from those countries are\r\nCatholics. Of those who are Protestants in Europe, but few join the\r\nDemocratic party after reaching this country. Estimating that one out of\r\nevery five of these emigrants becomes a voter, and that 85 out of every\r\n100 of these voters joined the Democratic party, we should have as added\r\nto that party from naturalization alone, for the ten years preceding\r\n1850, 290,753 votes; for the ten preceding 1860, 431,696 votes; for\r\nthe ten preceding 1870, 424,505 votes; and for the ten preceding 1880,\r\n466,164 votes. Meanwhile, while these immense additions are being made\r\nfrom year to year to the Democratic party from naturalization, it loses\r\nlarge numbers every year from increased civilization. The Whig party\r\nwas, and the Republican party is, the party of enlightenment; and as\r\nforeigners, and especially their children, become more enlightened as\r\nto the advantages of a republican or representative form of\r\ngovernment--more and more enlightened as to the advantages of a free\r\npress--they leave that party and go into the Republican; or, what is\r\nmore frequent, their children, having been educated in our free schools,\r\nlearn to love freedom of thought as well as of action, and, on becoming\r\nof age, join the Republican party, and some of them join Protestant\r\nchurches. But for this retroactive process, which is constantly going\r\non, this country long ago would have been completely under foreign\r\ninfluence, and we never should have been permitted to have celebrated\r\nthe one hundredth anniversary of American independence.\r\n\r\nNow let us take a retrospective view and see what has been the practical\r\noutcome of these two antagonistic principles. In 1852 the number of\r\nDemocratic votes cast for President was 1,601,474; number of Whig votes,\r\n1,542,403; total, 3,143,877; population of the United States in 1850,\r\n23,191,876. In 1860, number of Republican votes, 1,866,352; Democratic\r\nand all others, 2,810,501; total, 4,676,853; population that year,\r\n31,443,321. In 1872, number of Republican votes, 3,597,070; Democratic,\r\n2,834,078; total, 6,431,148; population for 1870, 38,558,371. In 1880,\r\nnumber of Republican votes, 4,450,921; Democratic, 4,447,888; total,\r\n8,898,809; population for 1880, 50,155,783.\r\n\r\nThe immigration for the last few years has been exceedingly large,\r\nreaching the enormous figures of 457,257 for 1880, and 669,431 for 1881.\r\nAmong these were 2,600 Jews from Russia, of whom it is announced there\r\nare 10,000 more to come soon, and for whom contract has already been\r\nmade with the Hamburg line of steamers. Of these it is safe to calculate\r\nthat 95 out of every 100 voters will go into the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nAs showing the effect of the retroactive process heretofore spoken of,\r\nwhereby enlightenment turns Catholics into Protestants and Democrats\r\ninto Republicans, it may be stated (as census returns show) that while\r\nin 1801 there were in the two Protestant countries of Great Britain and\r\nthe United States about 6,000,000 Roman Catholics to about 15,000,000\r\nProtestants, or about one to two and a-half, in 1880 there were about\r\n12,000,000 Catholics to about 74,000,000 Protestants, or about one\r\nto six. In using the word enlightenment in connection with the words\r\nRepublican and Protestant, we would by no means have it inferred that\r\nall Democrats and all Catholics are ignorant. In both are to be found\r\nmen of the highest intelligence and of the most exalted character; but\r\nthese form the exception rather than the rule--the leading few, who have\r\ntheir own purposes to subserve, rather than the following many, with\r\nwhom party is madness only for the benefit of the few.\r\n\r\nNow, my friend (the reader), you can begin to see, can you not, why it\r\nis that the Democratic party, notwithstanding all its sins, has still\r\nbeen kept alive? But yet there is one more item to be added to account\r\nfor its continued existence: namely, that it is not only supplied with\r\nrecruits from Europe, but with money as well. We have heretofore shown\r\nfrom official sources how many hundreds of thousands of dollars have\r\nbeen, and are constantly being sent from Europe to this country to\r\n\"propagate\" the Catholic faith--which is, indeed, but another name and\r\nanother way of propagating the Democratic party--and but for the extreme\r\nsecrecy of their movements, we might show just as plainly that other\r\nhundreds of thousands are sent here at every Presidential election by\r\nEuropean capitalists, European manufacturers, and European sovereigns,\r\nwith a view to influence our elections. Bribery at elections being made\r\na misdemeanor in nearly all the States, movements of this character have\r\nto be conducted with extreme secrecy; but that the thing has been done\r\nfor the past forty years (ever since the inauguration of the protective\r\nsystem by Henry Clay), and is still being done, there is not a shadow of\r\ndoubt; nor is there a doubt that this is another one of the reasons why\r\nthe Democratic party is kept alive. A single Hartford convention killed\r\nthe Federal party; a single set of pro-slavery resolutions, adopted by\r\na National convention, killed the Whig party; and the part which the\r\nDemocratic party took in the late rebellion would have killed it so\r\neffectually that no resurrection could have ever reached it, but for\r\nthe support it has had, and still has, from European powers, through\r\nemigration and through the Catholic Church, and with the once avowed,\r\nand now no less steadily held, object of overthrowing our representative\r\nform of government, and of destroying the liberty of our press. Thus, my\r\nfriend (the reader), your second query is answered beyond, as we think,\r\nall possibility of successful contradiction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0323]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. -- III.--FROM ALL YOUR STUDY OF HISTORY, WHAT DEDUCTIONS DO\r\nYOU DRAW AS TO THE FINAL DECLINE AND FALL, IF SUCH A THING IS EVER TO\r\nBE, OF THIS REPUBLIC?\r\n\r\n|TO the casual reader, the relationship that this question bears to\r\n\"Secrets of the Late Rebellion, now Revealed for the First Time,\"\r\nmay seem very obscure, but to our mind, that sees the end from the\r\nbeginning, the relationship seems very close, as our readers will also\r\nsee, we think, before we close the answer.\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, in one of his outbursts of eloquence, said he \"knew of no\r\nway to judge of the future save by the past.\" Taking this as our guide,\r\nlet us inquire somewhat into the history of former republics, and see\r\nif we cannot gather therefrom some probabilities as to the future of our\r\nown, and some light by which to guide our own footsteps meanwhile. Our\r\nplan and limited space will only permit us to take a bird's-eye view of\r\nfour--Athens, Sparta, Thebes, and Rome--but even from these alone we may\r\nlearn some useful lessons.\r\n\r\nThe republic of Athens came into existence immediately after the\r\nvoluntary death of King Codrus, about 1068 years before Christ. Codrus\r\nhaving been made to believe, through an oracle, that if he sacrificed\r\nhis own life, his country would be victorious over the Heraclidæ, with\r\nwhom they were then engaged in war, disguised himself as a peasant, and,\r\npurposely quarrelling with a soldier of the hostile army, procured the\r\ndeath he wished. His sons, Medon and Nileus, disputed the succession\r\nto the crown; and the Athenians, taking advantage of this dispute,\r\ndetermined to set aside the crown altogether, and thenceforth have\r\na representative or republican form of government. Hence arose the\r\nAthenian Republic. Though they abolished the title of king, out of the\r\nhigh regard they had for Codrus, they appointed his son Medon chief\r\nmagistrate for life, and even made the office hereditary, so that for\r\nthree hundred and thirty-one years thereafter the chief magistrate\r\ncontinued in that family. They then abolished the perpetual archonship,\r\nand made the tenure of the office ten years. This term they reduced\r\nerelong to one year, and, instead of one archon or chief magistrate,\r\nappointed nine, with equal authority. Meanwhile their government became\r\nso purely democratic as to become utterly despotic, and the tyranny of\r\nthe mob was found to be more oppressive than the restraints of a\r\nsingle ruler. Then followed the laws of Draco, which, because of\r\ntheir severity, were said to have been \"written in blood.\" He made\r\nno distinction of offences, but punished all equally with death. He\r\nweakened the authority of the Areopagus, and instituted a new tribunal,\r\nin which judges were given almost unlimited power, and virtually made\r\nbrutes. The severity of his laws defeated their own object.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of things when the great lawmaker, Solon,\r\nappeared on the stage, five hundred and ninety-four years before Christ.\r\nThe laws which he framed and gave the Athenians were not, as he said\r\nhimself, \"the best possible, but the best which the Athenians were\r\ncapable of receiving.\" To the rich he gave offices and dignities; to the\r\npoor he gave the right of suffrage, whereby in the framing of laws,\r\nthe election of magistrates, the making of war or peace, the forming\r\nof treaties and alliances, and in all that regarded either religious or\r\ncivil policy, they should have an equal voice with the rich, and, being\r\nmuch the greater in number, their class could overbalance the other\r\nthree, though out of their class could no nomination be made to any\r\noffice of honor or profit. A senate of four hundred members held an\r\nintermediate place between office-holders and the people, and served as\r\na restraint upon both. The arbitrary power of the judges, as established\r\nby Draco, Solon restrained, and made the court of Areopagus the chief\r\njudicial tribunal, and gave it also a tutorial power over all the youth\r\nof the republic. Instead of having an egotistical, half-educated state\r\nschool superintendent to do such duty (as sometimes found in this\r\ncountry), this court appointed masters and governors for the youth, and\r\nsuperintended their education. The Areopagus also inquired into the life\r\nand morals of all who held offices in the state, and such as could not\r\nstand the scrutiny were not only incapacitated for employ, but declared\r\ninfamous. His laws also prohibited all imprisonment for debt, and\r\ncontained many other provisions in which legislators have made no\r\nimprovement during the nearly two thousand five hundred years that have\r\npassed since then.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the good laws of Solon, then, as now, there were found\r\nmen to take advantage of their provisions to gratify their own\r\nprivate hates. Thus, Solon's laws allowed popular action for most\r\noffences--regarding all offences as against the \"peace and dignity of\r\nthe state\"--as we do now; but in many cases advantage was taken of this\r\nby bad men to make the most calumnious accusations against men whose\r\ncharacter until then had stood even above suspicion. So advantage was\r\nfrequently taken of the law of ostracism (which was only meant for\r\ngood), whereby some of their very best men were banished from the\r\nstate. Thus, when an ignorant citizen was about to cast his vote for the\r\nostracism of Aristides, he was asked by Aristides himself, who chanced\r\nto be passing by at the moment, and who was unknown t<\\ him:\r\n\r\n\"Why, what harm, my friend, has Aristides done to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"None in the world,\" replied he; \"but I hate to hear everybody call him\r\nthe 'Just.'\"\r\n\r\nThucydides also, from whom Athens had received the most eminent\r\nservices, was in like manner banished by ostracism; as likewise were\r\nMiltiades, Cimon, Themistocles, Phocion, and many other of their most\r\neminent men. What was meant, too, for religious freedom was made to\r\nsubserve (by those who temporarily had the power) the purposes of\r\nreligious bigotry, tyranny, and persecution, until even the renowned\r\nphilosopher, Socrates, was made to drink the fatal hemlock.\r\n\r\nWhile the great majority of Athenians were entirely satisfied with\r\ntheir form of government; while the masses were equally jealous of their\r\nliberty, because liberty was equally necessary to each for the enjoyment\r\nof his favorite scheme of life; yet there were those inside of the\r\nrepublic, as well as outside, who did not like a republican form of\r\ngovernment, and who were all the while watching for an opportunity\r\nto overthrow it Among these was Pisistratus, a man of large wealth,\r\nsplendid talents, and of great popularity. He aspired to sovereign\r\npower, and by his artifices came so near in obtaining it, that Solon,\r\ndisgusted at the want of patriotism among his countrymen, and unable\r\nto witness its degradation, bade adieu to Athens, and died in voluntary\r\nexile. He--even he, the great and good Solon--was made to feel what it\r\nwas to be \"a man without a country,\" and chose to die in exile rather\r\nthan to remain in his native land, or even to look upon it again in a\r\nstate of degradation.. If the time should ever come (and God only knows\r\nhow soon it may come!) when not only one but scores, yea, hundreds, of\r\nAmerican Solons should be wandering throughout the world, without a home\r\nand without a country, because of the destruction of our representative\r\nform of government by European jealousy and Catholic bigotry, then, if\r\nnever before, they and all others will fully understand something of the\r\nnatural outgrowth of the Democratic party of this country, of which the\r\nlate rebellion was the first act in the drama, and of which its secret\r\nworkings only represented the machinations of a hundred Pisistratuses!\r\n\r\nBut though Pisistratus thus usurped power, and for a while played the\r\nsovereign, he was unable to retain it long. Megacles and Lycurgus,\r\nthe chiefs of the Alemæonidæ, gained at length so much strength as\r\nto attack and expel the usurper from Athens. By a stratagem he again\r\nsecured power, and, on dying, bequeathed the crown to his sons,\r\nHippias and Hipparchus, but erelong Hipparchus was killed, and Hippias\r\ndethroned, and once again the republic prevailed, and statues were\r\nerected to the honor of Harmodius and Aristogiton as the authors of\r\ntheir country's deliverance from tyranny.\r\n\r\nFrom thenceforth there was almost a constant warfare between the\r\npolitical parties or factions of the republic, while jealous eyes\r\noutside were consequently watching an opportunity for its destruction.\r\nAmbitious demagogues were constantly using the people as their tools,\r\nbut scarcely would one obtain the chief magistracy until another would\r\npull him down--if not by a vote of the people, then by faction or by\r\nassassination. Meanwhile Hippias, who had been dethroned, sought aid\r\nfrom the king of Persia to reinstate him, and thus brought a long and\r\nbloody war upon his own country. In this war were fought the renowned\r\nbattles of Marathon, Salamis, Plateæ, and Mycale, and the Greeks came\r\noff victorious, but at a most fearful sacrifice of treasure and life.\r\nAfter this followed the disunion among the several Grecian states--the\r\nsecession of some--the coldness and indifference of others; and though\r\nthe brilliant administrations of Cimon and Pericles seemed to revive the\r\nrepublic for awhile, it was evident to all that the seeds of death were\r\nfast germinating and would bring forth fruit erelong. The Persian king,\r\nand the sovereigns of other surrounding countries, had long felt\r\ndeep jealousy of the Athenian Republic, and, when an excuse came for\r\nattacking it, they were not backward in availing themselves of the\r\nopportunity. Fortunately for the Athenian Republic the attack made upon\r\nthem by Persia had the effect to bring the whole power of the Spartan\r\nRepublic to their aid, which, with such other aid as they received from\r\nminor states of Greece, enabled them to defeat the Persians in the end\r\nand maintain their own independence.\r\n\r\nBut a worse fate awaited them--namely, a fight among themselves. The\r\nmutual jealousies that had long existed between Athens and Sparta\r\nbroke out afresh, and soon terminated in an open war between the two\r\nrepublics, and most of the minor states of Greece took a part in the\r\nquarrel. The first declaration of hostilities, however, was compromised\r\nbefore they came to actual conflict; but it proved to be only a\r\nsmouldering, and not an extinguishment, of the fire that had long burned\r\nin the breast of each--a fire that afterwards broke forth in what was\r\nknown as the \"Peloponnesian war,\" and lasted twenty-eight years. Our\r\nplan and space will not permit any details of this. A history of the\r\nfirst twenty-two years of the war was admirably written by Thucydides,\r\nand of the last six years by Xenophon, to whom we must refer the reader\r\nwho would know its particulars. Suffice it to say here that during this\r\nlong internecine war each achieved victories and each suffered defeats.\r\nAt one time the Spartans so reduced Athens as to make an entire change\r\nin its constitution. The republic was abolished and thirty governors,\r\nor, as the Greek historians style them, \"thirty tyrants\" were\r\nsubstituted, whose power seems to have been absolute, unless in so far\r\nas each was restrained by the equally arbitrary will of his colleagues.\r\nSo fearful and terrible was their rule, that Xenophon thinks \"a greater\r\nnumber of Athenian citizens lost their lives by the sentence of these\r\ntyrants, in the short space of eight months, than had fallen in the\r\nwhole twenty-eight years of the Peloponnesian war.\" Hundreds of the most\r\neminent of the Athenian families left their country in despair, and what\r\nremained were for a time awed into silence, and dumb with consternation.\r\n\r\nAnd just here we may pause to say that precisely the same kind of rule,\r\nand the same kind of results, would have been witnessed in this country,\r\nhad the rebellion, by the aid of the Democratic party, succeeded in\r\ncapturing Washington and in establishing their rule over this country.\r\nIt is one of the \"Secrets of the Late Rebellion, now Revealed for the\r\nFirst Time\" (and our information comes from one who was behind the\r\nscenes and knew all about it, and the first sixteen chapters of this\r\nvolume entirely confirm this opinion), that behind President Davis and\r\nbehind General Lee stood a body of desperate men, who, at one single\r\nsweep, would have wiped them off the chess-board and put others in their\r\nstead, had they shown the least considerate humanity in dealing with\r\nNorthern men, in case the rebellion had succeeded. Not Abraham Lincoln\r\nalone would have fallen at the hands of the assassin or hangman, but\r\nthousands of others throughout the North would have suffered a like\r\nfate, until the rule of the \"thirty tyrants\" in Athens would have been\r\nconsidered but child's play in comparison with the rule of the more than\r\nthree hundred tyrants of this republic. Then would have been witnessed\r\nhere, as there, thousands of the most eminent of American\r\nfamilies leaving their country in despair--wandering they knew not\r\nwhither--without a home, and without a country! Abraham Lincoln's\r\nassassination was indeed done by a half crazed Southern rebel; but who\r\ncan doubt, after reading the secrets revealed in the foregoing pages,\r\nthat the frenzy that fired Booth's brain, and the nerve that enabled him\r\nto fire the deadly shot, came as directly from the Democratic party,\r\nas a party, as that the pistol itself was purchased by a Democratic\r\npartisan. All these facts go hand-in-hand, and there is no separating\r\none from the others.\r\n\r\nBut we have already occupied much more of time and space on the Athenian\r\nRepublic than we had intended. We can only say, in conclusion, that,\r\nafter the reign of the \"thirty tyrants,\" its fortunes were up and\r\ndown--oftener down than up--until the battle of Chæronea, which occurred\r\nin the year 338 before Christ, when the liberties of Greece were made\r\nto yield finally and forever to the stronger arm of the Macedonian. The\r\nAthenian Republic had existed after a fashion--and, indeed, much of the\r\ntime it was orderly \"after a fashion\"--for seven hundred and thirty years;\r\nand when it fell, there was not so much as an empty shell left. Its\r\ninternal dissensions, more than anything else, had eaten out its vitals;\r\nthe jealousy of surrounding monarchies had been to it a constant source\r\nof danger, and several times a source of great disaster; while for\r\nfully one-half of the seven hun-dren and thirty years it was rather a\r\ngovernment of tyranny than of liberty to those who lived under it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0333]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. OF SPARTA AND ITS LESSONS.\r\n\r\n|SPARTA was built by Lacedaemon as early as 1487 years before Christ;\r\nbut it did not become a republic until Lycurgus remodelled its\r\nlaws, eight hundred and eighty-four years before Christ. Though a\r\nrepresentative form of government, and therefore a republic, yet it\r\nwas so different from any other government that ever existed before\r\nor since, it may well be called unique, singular, sui generis. Its\r\ncitizens, for instance, ate at public tables; the children were regarded\r\nas belonging to the state rather than to parents; its money was made of\r\niron and of such weight that no one man could carry a hundred\r\ndollars. Thus, and in other ways, the accumulation of wealth was\r\ndiscouraged--while instruction in the art of war was made pastime--meat,\r\ndrink, and sleep, as it were, to all its male inhabitants. The labor of\r\nits farms, of its shops, of its merchants even, was all done by slaves;\r\nwhile the administration of government, the learning how to fight, and\r\nfighting, seems to have been the principal, if not the only, employment\r\nof its free citizens. Though existing at the same time with the Athenian\r\nRepublic, and within one hundred and eighty-four years as old, the two\r\ngovernments were in no sense a type of each other. The Athenian found in\r\nhis taste for pleasure constant employment; the Spartan's taste was\r\nonly for war. The arts of Athens met with the highest encouragement;\r\nat Sparta, scarcely none at all. At Athens the luxury of the rich\r\nconstantly employed the industry of the poor; at Sparta, luxury was\r\nregarded as almost criminal, and he who indulged in it was regarded with\r\ncontempt, if not with execration. The sciences were also cultivated by\r\nAthenians with the same ardor as the arts; while Spartans cared nothing\r\nfor science, except so far as it contributed to the efficiency of\r\nwarfare. As another, in contrasting the two republics, has very aptly\r\nput it, \"Sparta was altogether a military establishment; every other\r\nart was prohibited, industry among individuals was unknown, and domestic\r\neconomy unnecessary--for all was in common. The Lacedaemonians were\r\nactive only when at war. In peace, their manner of life was languid,\r\nuniform, indolent, and insipid. Taught to consider war as the sole\r\nhonorable or manly occupation, they contracted a fierce and ferocious\r\nturn of mind, which distinguished them from all the other states of\r\nGreece. Despising the arts themselves, they despised all who cultivated\r\nthem. Their constitution was fitted to form a small, a brave, and an\r\nindependent state; but had no tendency to produce a great, a polished,\r\nor a conquering people.\"\r\n\r\nBetween our own and a republic so peculiarly constituted, we can hardly\r\nmake comparisons; and yet we find, even in that, some features like in\r\nour own. Lysander was not only a great general, but, as Plutarch calls\r\nhim, he was a fox as well. Richelieu, when told that his enemies called\r\nhim a fox, said: \"Fox!--Well, I like the nickname! What did Plutarch say\r\nof the Greek Lysander?\"\r\n\r\nJoseph. I forget.\r\n\r\nRichelieu. That where the lion's skin fell short, he eked it out with\r\nthe fox's! A great statesman, Joseph, that same Lysander!\r\n\r\nMartin Van Buren, both before and after he became President of the\r\nUnited States, was called a fox, because of his great slyness and\r\nshrewdness in pulling the wires for the Democratic party. He denounced\r\nthat party before he died, however, and allowed himself to be run\r\nagainst their regular candidate for the Presidency; and, were he alive\r\nto-day, and knew of the secrets which this volume discloses, no man in\r\nthe United States would be more free in denouncing that party for the\r\npart it took in the rebellion, and for the part it is still taking in\r\nhelping Europeans in their designs to overthrow this government and the\r\nfreedom of the press, than Martin Van Buren.\r\n\r\nThis republic, like that of Athens, had its ending with the battle of\r\nChæronea, b.c. 338, after which the all-conquering Philip took possession\r\nof it and of all the states of Greece. The republic had existed after a\r\nfashion (for here, as at Athens, it was only \"after a fashion\" part\r\nof the time) through a period of five hundred and forty-six years; but\r\nfinally died from the ambition of those within and the jealousy of those\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nThebes was the last of the Grecian republics, but for a time shone\r\nwith as much brilliancy as either of the others. It had its origin from\r\nfortuitous circumstances rather than from the genius of any lawmaker;\r\nbut it produced and nurtured legislators as wise as Solon or Lycurgus,\r\nand soldiers as brave and as brilliant as Pericles or Lysander. When\r\nAthens and Sparta were visibly tending to decline, Thebes suddenly rose\r\nto a degree of splendor which eclipsed all her sister and contemporary\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nLong before b. c. 382, at which time the citadel of Thebes was seized by\r\nthe Spartans, the government of the Thebans was called republican, but\r\nit was rather so in name than in fact. The oligarchic party at Thebes,\r\ncorresponding with the Democratic party of this country, were all the\r\nwhile aiming at the establishment of an oligarchy, while the patriotic\r\nsupporters of liberty and independence were just as determined not only\r\nto maintain the republic, but to make it so in fact as well as in name.\r\n\r\nThe last-named party of Thebes corresponded precisely with the\r\nRepublican party of this country. When the contention between these two\r\nparties was at fever heat, it happened that Phoebidas, a Lacedaemonian\r\ngeneral, was sent with an army to punish the people of Olynthus, a\r\nThracian city, for an alleged infraction of a treaty of peace formed\r\nnot long before. While Phoebidas was on this expedition, Leontiades, the\r\nhead of the oligarchic party at Thebes, prevailed on him to second\r\nthe attempts of his party against the liberties of their country. The\r\nSpartan general yielded to the suggestion, and, while the unsuspecting\r\nThebans were celebrating the festival of Ceres, Phoebidas marched\r\nhis army into the city and took possession of their citadel. When the\r\nrepublicans of Thebes protested against this, the Spartans acknowledged\r\nit an act of treason in Leontiades to have thus betrayed his country,\r\nand they reprobated the conduct of Phoebidas in giving his aid to a\r\nmeasure which was a direct infraction of a national treaty; but being\r\nnow masters of Thebes, they did not choose to abandon their acquisition.\r\n\r\nIf through the influence and aid of Lord John Brewerton (the particulars\r\nof which are given in the fifth chapter of this volume) and others\r\nlike him, the heads, the Leontiadeses, of the Democratic party of this\r\ncountry, could have betrayed our government into the hands of Great\r\nBritain, and thereby pleased every other kingly government of Europe,\r\nevery Englishman would have acknowledged that somebody had played the\r\ntraitor, and that it constituted not only a direct infraction of the\r\ntreaty between their government and ours, but an infraction of the law\r\nof nations as well; yet, like the Spartans, they would have been unequal\r\nto the conflict between virtue and self-interest, and, like them, would\r\nhave replied, Now that we have the country, we'll keep it!\r\n\r\nBut though the \"mills of the gods grind slowly, they grind exceeding\r\nfine,\" and erelong the republicans of Thebes, headed by the brave\r\nPelopidas, and seconded by the no less brave Epaminondas, shook off the\r\nSpartan yoke--shook off the oligarchy--and reëstablished a republican\r\nform of government, and from thenceforth the Theban Republic went\r\nforward in a career of glory equal to anything that Athens or Sparta\r\ncould ever boast. The battle of Leuctra, in which six thousand Thebans,\r\ncommanded by Epaminondas, entirely defeated twenty-five thousand\r\nLacedaemonians, leaving four thousand, with their chief, Cleombrotus,\r\ndead upon the field, was but the beginning of a series of actions all\r\nof which reflected upon Thebes the highest glory. We have not room to\r\nrelate these in detail, but one incident in the life of Epaminondas--at\r\nits close--we cannot omit. The full particulars of the incident may be\r\nfound in Xenophon and Diodorus, but its gist is about as follows: At the\r\nbattle of Mantinea, Epaminondas, too rashly pursuing his success, had\r\nadvanced beyond the line of his troops, when, the enemy rallying, he was\r\nexposed to a whole shower of darts, and fell, pierced with numberless\r\nwounds. \"His faithful Thebans,\" says Professor Tytler, \"found means to\r\nrescue his body while life yet remained, and to bring him to his tent.\r\nA javelin stuck fast in his breast, and his physician declared that on\r\nextracting it he would immediately expire. In this extremity, breathless\r\nand fainting, while his friends stood weeping around him, he first\r\ninquired what had become of his shield, and being told that it was safe,\r\nhe beckoned to have it brought to him, and kissed it. He then asked\r\nwhich side had gained the victory, and being told it was the Thebans,\r\n'Then,' said he, 'all is well.' While some of his friends were\r\nlamenting his untimely fall, and regretting that he had left no\r\nchildren to perpetuate his memory, 'Yes,' said he, 'I have left two fair\r\ndaughters, Leuctra and Mantinea (the names of battle-fields)--'these\r\nwill perpetuate my memory;' so saying, with his own hands he drew forth\r\nthe javelin from his breast, and instantly expired.\"\r\n\r\nIf the republic at that moment could have died with Epaminondas,\r\nit would have gone out in a blaze of glory; but, alas! alas! it yet\r\ncontained traitors in its own bosom, and was yet to reap the fruits of\r\ntreason.\r\n\r\nPhilip, King of Macedon, determined to subvert the liberties of all\r\nthe Grecian republics. To him, as to European sovereigns of to-day, a\r\nrepresentative form of government was hateful, as would have been the\r\nliberty of the press, had there been a press in those days. It was one\r\nof his favorite maxims that \"no fortification was impregnable into which\r\na mule could make its way with a bag of money!\" as it was a maxim with\r\nthe first Napoleon that \"every man has his price?\" In pursuance of this\r\npolicy, Philip had his bribed emissaries in Thebes, as he had at Athens\r\nand Sparta. In Athens he had in his pay no less a man than Æschines,\r\nthe great orator, and Aris-todemus and Neoptolemus, the two great\r\ncomedians--all of whom were men of the highest influence in the public\r\nassemblies.\r\n\r\nWith such men at the capitals of the three largest republics--all\r\nconstantly declaring themselves' to be the \"stanchest of democrats\"--it\r\nwas only a question of time with Philip when he should have the\r\nrepublics within his grasp. Demosthenes thundered and lightened worse\r\nthan the natural elements. His \"Philippics\" rolled over the heads\r\nand hearts of the people, and found responsive echoes in thousands of\r\nbreasts; but the still, small voice of Philip's gold in the pockets of\r\nleading loud-mouthed so-called Democrats had more influence than all\r\nthe thunders of a Demosthenes. Philip's far-reaching plan was first to\r\nintroduce treachery in the heart of each republic, and then set them\r\nat variance with each other, that his alliance might be courted and an\r\nopportunity furnished for introducing Macedonian troops into Greece.\r\nHe had not long to wait for the maturing of his plans. The Phocians,\r\ninstead of paying a fine inflicted upon them by the Amphictyonic Council\r\n(corresponding to our Congress), seized the temple of Apollo at\r\nDelphos, with all its treasures. This set the republics at war with\r\neach other--some siding with the Council and some with the Phocians.\r\nAt length the Thessalians implored Philip's assistance against their\r\ntyrant, Lycophron, whose government they felt to be intolerable.\r\nThe tyrant sought aid of the Phocians to support him against his own\r\nsubjects. They responded to Lycophron, and Philip, with an alacrity that\r\nknew no precedent, responded to the people. The result of all this was\r\nthat Philip obtained a strong foothold in Greece, the very thing he\r\nhad so long sought through his paid emissaries. This advantage Philip\r\nfollowed up with the keen scent and persistence of a bloodhound, and\r\nalthough Demosthenes still continued to thunder against him, Philip's\r\ngold in the pockets of sordid ignorance, under the guise of democratic\r\npatriots, overbalanced the warnings of eloquence, and thus matters went\r\non, step by step, until the battle of Chæronea, when, at one fell swoop,\r\nnot only the republic of Thebes, but all the other republics and states\r\nof Greece, fell into the hands of Philip.\r\n\r\nCan you not see, my friend (the reader), in all this some striking\r\npoints of resemblance between the rise, progress, and fall of the Theban\r\nRepublic, and the rise, progress, and what threatened to be the fall of\r\nour own government in the late rebellion?\r\n\r\nAccording to European notions, we had a sort of republic, a sort of\r\nrepresentative form of government, prior to 1776; but it was rather\r\nan oligarchy than a republic, and Washington, Adams, John Hancock, and\r\nothers, determined to have a real republic or die in the attempt. Seven\r\nyears of terrible struggle and fearful sacrifice brought their wishes to\r\na successful issue. From 1783 until 1822 the course of this republic\r\nwas one blaze of glory, equal to anything that Thebes could ever boast.\r\nMeanwhile the jealous eyes of many European Philips had been looking on,\r\nand finally a Congress at Vienna, in 1822, entered into a solemn treaty\r\nwith each other (two of the articles of which we have heretofore quoted)\r\nthat representative governments, and the liberty of the press, were\r\n\"incompatible\" (that is the word) with \"monarchical principles,\" and\r\ntherefore ought to be abolished. In pursuance of this resolve the\r\nPhilips of Europe began to send their gold into this country, of which\r\nno less than $612,656 were sent from a single city of France (Lyons)\r\nin four years, as we have heretofore shown from their own published\r\nreports. True, this was but a drop in the bucket, but it shows that the\r\ndrops came from thick-lipped vials, and consequently were very large\r\ndrops. Among the contributions made about that time, it was announced,\r\nwith a great flourish of trumpets and as greatly to his credit, that\r\nthe Emperor of Austria had contributed twenty thousand francs to \"The\r\nSociety for the Propagation of the Faith.\" For the propagation of what?\r\nOf the faith? God save the mark! Had the item read, For the propagation\r\nof the Democratic party, and, through it, monarchical principles, it\r\nwould, in our humble judgment, have been nearer the truth. Of course\r\nwe do not know--no one ever can know--what proportion of the money\r\ncontributed in Europe and sent to this country (nominally to propagate\r\nthe faith of the Catholic Church) went into the hands of State and\r\nNational Democratic Executive Committees; but this we do know, as well\r\nas we know any conclusion drawn from known facts by deduction, that the\r\nmoney so sent had for its ultimate object (no matter into whose hands\r\nit first fell) more the destruction of the representative form of this\r\ngovernment, and the liberty of the press, than the propagation of any\r\nreligious faith.\r\n\r\nAnd let us pause a moment just here to say, that the process of\r\ninvestigation and of reasoning by which we arrive at the above\r\nconclusion, and at other conclusions heretofore announced, is very near\r\nto certainty, nor is it at all mystical. As Professor Huxley very aptly\r\nsays, when writing of the results of induction and deduction, \"The vast\r\nresults obtained by science are won by no mystical faculties, by no\r\nmental processes, other than those which are practised by every one\r\nof us in the humblest and meanest walks of life. A detective policeman\r\ndiscovers a burglar from the marks made by his shoe, by a mental process\r\nidentical with that by which Cuvier restored the extinct animals of\r\nMontmartre from fragments of their bones. Nor does that process of\r\ninduction and deduction by which a lady, finding a stain of a particular\r\nkind upon her dress, concludes that somebody has upset the inkstand\r\nthereon, differ in any way from that by which Adams and Leverrier\r\ndiscovered a new planet. The man of science, in fact, simply uses with\r\nscrupulous exactness the methods which we all habitually and at every\r\nmoment use carelessly.\"\r\n\r\nThough our present treatise is on history rather than on science,\r\nwe have used the facts which have fallen in our way from a somewhat\r\nextensive reading and study of history with as much \"scrupulous\r\nexactness\" as though we had been writing upon science, and we feel\r\nwithin our own breast that the conclusions reached are very near, if\r\nnot a dead, certainty. We did not make the facts that we have used. They\r\nhave been parts of current history from time to time, extending through\r\na period of nearly three thousand years. We have simply put the facts\r\nin logical form--in the form of proposition and proof--and then drawn\r\ntherefrom such inferences as seemed natural and inevitable. Politicians\r\nwill say, we know, that our conclusions are the result of preconceived\r\nopinions; bigots in religion will say that our conclusions are founded\r\nupon prejudice; but neither the one nor the other will be true. Take\r\nthe same facts, and we defy any logician or rhetorician in the world to\r\nreach different conclusions, if honest with his own conscience before\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0345]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER.\r\n\r\n|HAVING more than consumed the space allotted for this volume, we have\r\nneither room nor time left in which to write of the Roman Republic as\r\nits importance demands, and as indeed we should gladly have written.\r\nAnd yet we confess there is not, or ought not to be, any necessity for\r\nadding another word. If the lessons taught us from what we have learned\r\nof the three preceding republics have not opened our eyes to the\r\ndangerous tendencies of the Democratic party as a party; if we are not\r\nalready convinced that the leaders of that party, and those who stand\r\nbehind the scenes to prompt the leaders and furnish them with the\r\n\"sinews of war,\" in the shape of European gold, have for their ultimate\r\nobject the setting aside of our representative form of government\r\nand the destruction of the liberty of our press, then we would not be\r\nconvinced though one arose from the dead.\r\n\r\nWhy, then, need we add a word about the founding of the Roman Republic,\r\nfive hundred and ten years before Christ; why tell of the law, then\r\nfor the first time enacted by the Senate, that any citizen who had been\r\ncondemned to death by a magistrate, or even to banishment, or corporal\r\npunishment, should have the right of an appeal to the people before the\r\nsentence went into effect; why tell of the wars in which the republic\r\nwas thenceforth engaged, and how gloriously the people sustained the\r\nhonor of the republic; why tell how the people were afterwards betrayed\r\nby their rulers, and made to suffer the most intolerable hardships\r\nuntil they obtained the privilege of electing tribunes; why tell of the\r\nstruggles that these tribunes of the people had with rulers chosen by\r\nthe aristocracy for many, many years in maintaining for the people the\r\nrights for which they had made immense sacrifice of life, and which\r\nthey valued so highly; why tell--as it would take an entire volume to\r\ntell--how corruptions crept, from time to time, into the heart of the\r\nrepublic, how ambition took the place of patriotism, how the leaders\r\nin the provinces were watching with jealous eyes those at Rome and\r\nvice versa, how Caesar finally \"passed the Rubicon,\" how he seized the\r\ngovernment, how he attempted to put on a crown, and in the attempt lost\r\nboth the crown and his life; and how, when great Caesar fell, fell\r\nthe republic, with a crash that was heard to the uttermost ends of the\r\nearth? If we were to tell all this with the precision of a Montesquieu,\r\nor with as much display of learning as an Abbé de Vertot, there could\r\nonly be gathered therefrom precisely the same lessons as we have already\r\nlearned from the rise, progress, decline, and downfall of the three\r\nGrecian republics.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, my friend (the reader), we are finally brought face to face\r\nto the last clause of your third question, as to What is to be the final\r\nend of this republic?\r\n\r\nThe shortest answer would be, We don't know, and then stop right there;\r\nbut this would not be satisfactory to you. The next shortest answer will\r\nbe that our republic will, in all human probability, follow the fate of\r\nthe Grecian and Roman republics, and that it is only a question of time\r\nwhen that shall be. We know that such a confession is humiliating to\r\none's pride, and that we would all much rather believe, as it is usual\r\nfor Fourth of July orators to say, that \"this republic is to last\r\nforever!\" but alas! alas! for human vanity, it is only too true that\r\n\"history but repeats itself!\"\r\n\r\nBut, allowing this answer to be the correct one, it by no means lessens\r\nyour and my responsibility; for whether that end comes in twenty years,\r\nor two hundred years, or two thousand years, depends altogether upon\r\nAmericans themselves. There are good, and true, and intelligent men in\r\nevery political party, as there are good, and true, and intelligent men\r\nin every religious organization. While we conscientiously believe that\r\nthe tendency of the Democratic party to be just as we have repeatedly\r\nstated; and while we as conscientiously believe that the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch, as a church, is being made use of by European sovereigns, just\r\nas we have repeatedly stated; yet we believe, indeed, we know, that both\r\nin that party and in that church are as good men, as true men, and as\r\nintelligent men as are to be found in any party or in any church\r\non earth; and if these will but unite with the good, and true, and\r\nintelligent of other parties and of other churches, the representative\r\nform of this government, and consequently its liberties, and the liberty\r\nof its press, may be preserved yet for many scores of years, if not for\r\nmany centuries. It is no mere figure of speech to say that \"the price\r\nof liberty is eternal vigilance\" Like panthers crouching and waiting\r\nfor their prey, the enemies of this government are all the while on the\r\nwatch. They have their paid emissaries not only at Washington, but at\r\nevery State capital, just as Philip of Macedon had among the republics\r\nof Greece. A lack of vigilance upon the part of patriots may, at any one\r\nof our national elections, put the general government into their hands.\r\nThis once in their hands, they will find a way, or make one, as we have\r\nheretofore said, to hold it for all time to come; for every crowned head\r\nof Europe would at once, openly or secretly, rally to their support.\r\nThen would come a weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, but,\r\nalas, it would be too late! Then would be found Americans in all parts\r\nof the world without a home and without a country, but their regrets,\r\nalas! would bring back neither. There are Greeks and Romans to-day, as\r\nthere were Greeks and Romans two thousand and three thousand years ago;\r\nbut it blurs the eye to see (as we have seen in their own lands), and\r\nit sickens the heart to think (as any intelligent man may think) of,\r\nthe difference between a citizen of Greece and of Rome to-day and of the\r\ncitizen who lived when they were republics! Pigmies and giants are the\r\nonly two English words we have to express such difference; but to one\r\nwho has seen and felt the difference, while travelling through their own\r\nlands, these words fail utterly to convey a true conception of the real\r\ndifference which exists.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my good friend (the reader), I must bid you farewell. We have\r\ntravelled a long way together--longer, perhaps, than has occurred to you\r\nas we have steadily pursued our course. Starting in our own times,\r\nand with events in some of which we have ourselves taken part, we\r\nhave slowly ascended the river of time until we reached a point (the\r\nbeginning of the Athenian Republic) nearly three thousand years from\r\nwhere we started. Then, retracing our way, we slowly descended the\r\nriver, stopping long enough to gather a few grains of wheat at one\r\nplace, a few grains of rye at another, a few grains of corn at another,\r\nand so on, and on, until we have got back to where we started. In the\r\nbeginning of our journey we peeped into some dark places--places into\r\nwhich the light of history never before had shone, but which, from\r\nthis time forth, will be as well known as any other facts of the great\r\nrebellion.\r\n\r\nAll that I have done for you, in all these journeyings, is, at near the\r\nclose of our pilgrimage, to select out the different kinds of grain,\r\narrange them in form of proposition and proof, just as any other\r\nlogician or rhetorician might have done, and then point out to you that,\r\nif we would be profited by these grains (of information), picked up on\r\nthe way, and treat them in a certain manner, they would yield wholesome\r\nbread and sustain life (the life of our republic) for many years to\r\ncome; whereas, treated in another way, these same grains would only make\r\nthe vilest of whiskey, which, used wrongfully, could only lead to misery\r\nand final death here and eternal death hereafter. In some things, my\r\nfriend (the reader), your knowledge is far beyond mine; in others,\r\nmine may be greater than yours, because of chances of information which\r\nhappened to come in my way instead of coming in yours. While glad to\r\nlearn anything I can from you, I have only done my duty, for which\r\nI claim no credit--only done as I would wish to be done by--in\r\ncommunicating to you such facts, and the unmistakable inference from\r\nsuch facts, as were secrets with others until they came to me, and\r\nsecrets with me until I now communicate them to you, and through you and\r\nthe printed page to the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd now, what is your and my duty in the premises? Is it to sit with\r\nfolded hands and see our glorious republic drift on and on until it\r\nfalls into the hands of the Democratic party, and then into the hands\r\nof European sovereigns, and then is blotted out in one eternal night?\r\nOr shall we not rather (as Gough so graphically pictures in one of his\r\ninimitable lectures) cry aloud to those whom we see carelessly sailing\r\non the river of Time--the Niagara River,--only a little way above the\r\nrapids, and within plain hearing of the thundering of the all-devouring\r\nfalls--\"Young men, ahoy there; the rapids are below you!\" And if they\r\nshould at first respond with a \"Ha! ha! we will laugh and quaff; all\r\nthings delight us; what care we for the future?\"--then to cry again,\r\nstill louder than before, \"Beware! Beware! The rapids are below you!\"\r\nand if, after all this, they still go shrieking, howling, blaspheming\r\nover the falls of the river of Time, your skirts and mine will be free\r\nof their blood.\r\n\r\nOr, to change the metaphor, my friend, let you and I and all of us who\r\nlove a representative form of government, who love the freedom of the\r\npress, who love our own glorious republic--let us, whenever we see the\r\n\"ship of state\" floundering in the breakers and liable to be engulphed\r\nby the angry waves of passion, hate, and self-interest, imitate the\r\nexample of our blessed Saviour, and cry aloud, \"Peace; be still!\" and\r\nthough we may not, like Him, calm the waves by miraculous power, yet, if\r\nwith our cry we put our shoulders firmly together, and pull at the same\r\nend of the rope, all of us who really love the republic--the honest\r\nDemocrat with the honest Republican, the honest Catholic with the honest\r\nProtestant--we and our descendants may save the \"ship of state\" from\r\nsinking, at least for many years, if not for many centuries to come. And\r\nmay God bless and prosper every such united effort for the saving of our\r\nglorious republic!\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Secrets of the Late Rebellion, by J.
