Burt Company, Publishers, New York\r\n\r\n1903\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 0005]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORD OF PREFACE\r\n\r\nIt should be said in the beginning that these memoirs will not be\r\nwritten by my own hand. I have no skill of pen and ink, and any relation\r\nof length would be beyond my genius. The phrasing would fall to be\r\ndisreputable, and the story itself turn involved and to step on its own\r\ntoes, and mayhap with the last of it to fall flat on its face, unable\r\nto proceed at all. Wherefore, as much for folk who are to read as for\r\nmy own credit, I shall have one who makes print his trade to write these\r\npages for me.\r\n\r\nNor shall I advance apology in this. If I plan for the construction of\r\na house, I call to my aid architects and artisans in wood and stone and\r\niron. I am not disgraced for that out of my own hands and head I do not\r\nthrow up the walls and lay on the roof of the edifice. Why, then, when\r\nnow I am about the paper-telling of my life, should I blush because I am\r\ndriven to seek the aid of him who makes an inkpot his profession? I am\r\nlike a lumber-yard or a stone-quarry, and full of the raw material for\r\nthis work; but I require one drilled of saw and chisel to carry off the\r\nbusiness of my housebuilding.\r\n\r\nIt would be the thing natural, should you who open these leaves put the\r\nquestion of motive and ask why, when now I am retired, and should be\r\ncautious with my threescore years, I come forth with confidences which,\r\naside from the mere sorrow of them, are like to prove less for my honor\r\nthan I might wish. Why is it that I who have removed my loneliness\r\nand my millions to scenes of peace at least, may not leave well enough\r\nalone? Why should I return with disclosures touching Tammany and the\r\ninner history of that organization, when the dullest must apprehend only\r\ntrouble and pain as the foolish fruits of such garrulity?\r\n\r\nTo the cheer of ones still on the firing lines of Tammany effort, let me\r\npromise to say no more of them than belongs of necessity to the story\r\nof my own career. I aim towards the painting of no man's picture save\r\nmy own. Also from first to last I will hold before the face of each old\r\nfriend the shield of an alias and never for a moment in name or feature\r\nuncover him to the general eye.\r\n\r\nAs to why it pleases me to give the public my Tammany evolution, and\r\nwhether I hope for good or ill therefrom, I am not able to set forth.\r\nThere is that within my bosom to urge me to this work, that much I know;\r\nthe thing uncertain being--is it vanity, or is it remorse or a hunger\r\nfor sympathy to so ride me and force my frankness to top-speed? There\r\ncomes one thought: however black that robe of reputation which the truth\r\nweaves for me, it will seem milk-white when laid side by side with what\r\nMendacity has invented and Malice sworn to as the story of my career.\r\n\r\nBefore I lift the latch of narration, I would have you pardon me a first\r\ndefensive word. Conceiving that, in the theory of politics, whatever the\r\npractice may discover, there is such a commodity as morals and such a\r\nware as truth, and, remembering how much as the Chief of Tammany Hall I\r\nhave been condemned by purists and folk voluble for reform as a fashion\r\nof City Satan, striving for all that was ebon in local conditions and\r\ncontrol, I would remind the reader--hoping his mind to be unbiased and\r\nthat he will hold fairly the scales for me--that both morals and truth\r\nas questions will ever depend for their answer on environment and point\r\nof view. The morality of one man is the sin of another, and the truth in\r\nthis mouth is the serpent lie in that. Having said this much, let me now\r\ngo forward without more of flourish or time to be eaten up with words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOSS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I--HOW THE BOSS CAME TO NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\nMY father was a blacksmith, and he and my mother came out of Clonmel,\r\nwhere I myself was born. There were four to our family, for besides my\r\nfather and mother, I owned a sister named Anne, she being my better in\r\nage by a couple of years. Anne is dead now, with all those others I have\r\nloved, and under the grass roots; but while she lived--and she did not\r\npass until after I had reached the size and manners of a man--she abode\r\na sort of second mother to me, and the littlest of my interests was her\r\nchief concern.\r\n\r\nThat Anne was thus tenderly about my destinies, worked doubtless a deal\r\nof fortunate good to me. By nature, while nothing vicious, I was as\r\nlawless as a savage; and being resentful of boundaries and as set for\r\nliberty as water down hill, I needed her influence to hold me in some\r\nquiet order. That I have the least of letters is due wholly to Anne, for\r\nschool stood to me, child and boy, as hateful as a rainy day, and it was\r\nonly by her going with me to sit by my side and show me my blurred way\r\nacross the page that I would mind my book at all.\r\n\r\nIt was upon a day rearward more than fifty years when my father,\r\ngathering together our slight belongings, took us aboard ship for\r\nAmerica. We were six weeks between Queenstown and New York; the ship my\r\nfather chose used sails, and there arose unfriendly seas and winds to\r\nbaffle us and set us back. For myself, I hold no clear memory of that\r\nvoyage, since I was but seven at the time. Nor could I have been called\r\ngood company; I wept every foot of the way, being sick from shore to\r\nshore, having no more stomach to put to sea with then than I have now.\r\n\r\nIt was eight of the clock on a certain July night that my father, having\r\nabout him my mother and Anne and myself, came ashore at Castle Garden.\r\nIt being dark, and none to meet us nor place for us to seek, we slept\r\nthat night, with our coats to be a bed to us, on the Castle Garden\r\nflags. If there were hardship to lurk in thus making a couch of the\r\nstone floors, I missed the notice of it; I was as sound asleep as a tree\r\nat midnight when we came out of the ship and for eight hours thereafter,\r\nnever once opening my eyes to that new world till the sun was up.\r\n\r\nIndeed, one may call it in all candor a new world! The more since, by\r\nthe grace of accident, that first day fell upon the fourth of the month,\r\nand it was the near, persistent roar of cannon all about us, beginning\r\nwith the break of day, to frighten away our sleep. My father and mother\r\nwere as simple as was I, myself, on questions of Western story, and\r\nthe fact of the Fourth of July told no news to them. Guns boomed; flags\r\nflaunted; bands of music brayed; gay troops went marching hither and\r\nyon; crackers sputtered and snapped; orators with iron throats swept\r\ndown on spellbound crowds in gales of red-faced eloquence; flaming\r\nrockets when the sun went down streaked the night with fire! To these\r\nmanifestations my father and the balance of us gave admiring ear and\r\neye; although we were a trifle awed by the vehemence of an existence\r\nin which we planned to have our part, for we took what we heard and\r\nwitnessed to be the everyday life of the place.\r\n\r\nMy father was by trade a blacksmith, and one fair of his craft. Neither\r\nhe nor my mother had much learning; but they were peaceful, sober folk\r\nwith a bent for work; and being sure, rain or shine, to go to church,\r\nand strict in all their duties, they were ones to have a standing with\r\nthe clergy and the neighbors, It tells well for my father that within\r\nthe forty-eight hours to follow our landing at Castle Garden, he had a\r\nroof above our heads, and an anvil to hammer upon; this latter at a\r\nwage double the best that Clonmel might offer even in a dream. And so\r\nwe began to settle to our surroundings, and to match with them, and fit\r\nthem to ourselves; with each day Clonmel to gather a dimness, and we to\r\nseem less strange and more at home, and in the last to feel as naturally\r\nof America as though we had been born upon the soil.\r\n\r\nIt has found prior intimation that my earlier years ran as wild as a\r\ncolt, with no strong power save Anne's to tempt me in a right direction.\r\nMy father, so far as his mood might promise, would have led me in paths\r\nI should go; but he was never sharp to a condition, and with nothing to\r\nhim alert or quick he was one easily fooled, and I dealt with him as I\r\nwould. Moreover, he had his hands filled with the task of the family's\r\nsupport; for while he took more in wage for his day's work than had ever\r\ncome to him before, the cost to live had equal promotion, and it is\r\nto be doubted if any New York Monday discovered him with riches in his\r\npocket beyond what would have dwelt there had he stayed in Clonmel. But\r\nwhether he lacked temper or time, and whatever the argument, he cracked\r\nno thong of authority over me; I worked out my days by patterns to\r\nplease myself, with never a word from him to check or guide me.\r\n\r\nAnd my mother was the same. She had her house to care for; and in a\r\nwash-tub day, and one when sewing machines were yet to find their birth,\r\na woman with a family to be a cook to, and she of a taste besides to see\r\nthem clothed and clean, would find her every waking hour engaged.\r\nShe was a housekeeper of celebration, was my mother, and a star for\r\nneighboring wives to steer by; with floor and walls and everything about\r\nher as spick and span as scouring soap and lye might make them. Pale,\r\nwork-worn, I still carry her on the skyline of my memory; and I recall\r\nhow her eye would light and her gray cheek show a flush when the priest\r\ndid us the credit of supper at our board, my father pulling down his\r\nsleeves over his great hairy arms in deference to the exalted station of\r\nthe guest. It comes to this, however, that both my father and my mother,\r\nin their narrow simplicities and time taken up with the merest arts of\r\nliving, had neither care nor commands for me. I came and I went by\r\nmy own clock, and if I gave the business thought, it was a thought of\r\ngratitude to find myself so free.\r\n\r\nTo be sure I went now and then to my lessons. Anne had been brisk to\r\nseek forth a school; for she refused to grow up in ignorance, and even\r\ncherished a plan to one day teach classes from a book herself. Being\r\nestablished, she drew me after her, using both persuasion and force to\r\nthat end, and to keep me in a way of enlightenment, invented a system\r\nof rewards and punishments, mainly the former, by which according to my\r\nmerit I was to suffer or gain.\r\n\r\nThis temple of learning to which Anne lured me was nothing vast, being\r\nno bigger than one room. In lieu of a blackboard there was a box of\r\nclean white sand wherewith to teach dullards of my age and sort their\r\nalphabet. That feat of education the pedagogue in charge--a somber\r\npersonage, he, and full of bitter muscularities--accomplished by tracing\r\nthe letter in the sand. This he did with the point of a hickory ruler,\r\nwhich weapon was never out of his hand, and served in moments of\r\nthickness as a wand of inspiration, being laid across the dull one's\r\nback by way of brightening his wits. More than once I was made wiser in\r\nthis fashion; and I found such stimulus to go much against the grain and\r\nto grievously rub wrong-wise the fur of my fancy.\r\n\r\nThese hickory drubbings to make me quicker, falling as thickly as\r\nOctober's leaves, went short of their purpose. On the heels of one of\r\nthem I would run from my lessons for a week on end. To be brief with\r\nthese matters of schools and books and alphabets and hickory beatings,\r\nI went to my classes for a day, only to hide from them for a week; as\r\nmight be guessed, the system collected but a scanty erudition.\r\n\r\nIt is a pity, too: that question of education cannot too much invite an\r\nemphasis. It is only when one is young that one may be book-taught, just\r\nas the time of spring is the time for seed. There goes a byword of an\r\nold dog and a new trick, and I should say it meant a man when he is\r\nthirty or forty with a book; for, though driven by all the power of\r\nshame, I in vain strove with.\r\n\r\nWhat was utmost in me to repair in middle years the loss of those\r\nschooldays wasted away. I could come by no advance; the currents of\r\nhabitual ignorance were too strong and I made no head against them. You\r\nthink I pause a deal over my want of letters? I tell you it is the thing\r\nI have most mourned in all my life.\r\n\r\nWhen a fugitive from lessons, I would stay away from my home. This was\r\nbecause I must manage an escape from Anne; should she find me I was\r\nlost, and nothing for it save to be dragged again to school. The look of\r\ngrief in her brown eyes meant ever defeat for me. My only safety was to\r\nturn myself out of doors and play the exile.\r\n\r\nThis vagabondage was pleasant enough, since it served to feed my native\r\nvagrancy of temper. And I fared well, too; for I grew into a kind of\r\ncateran, and was out of my sleeping lair with the sun to follow the\r\nmilkman and baker on their rounds. Coming betimes to the doors of\r\ncustomers who still snored between their sheets, these merchants left\r\ntheir wares in areas. That was all my worst need asked; by what time\r\nthey doubled the nearest corner I had made my swoop and was fed for the\r\nwhole of a day.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I knew a way to pick up coppers. On a nearby corner in the\r\nBowery a great auction of horses was going. Being light and little, and\r\nhaving besides a lively inclination for horses, I was thrown upon the\r\nbacks of ones put up for sale to show their paces. For each of these\r\nmounts I came the better off by five cents, and on lucky days have made\r\nas much as the half of a dollar at that trade. As for a bed, if it were\r\nsummer time, what should be finer than the docks? Or if winter, then the\r\nfire-rooms of the tugs, with the engineers and stokers whereof I made\r\nit my care to be friendly? I was always ready to throw off a line, or\r\npolish a lantern, or, when a tug was at the wharf, run to the nearest\r\ntap-room and fetch a pail of beer; for which good deeds the East River\r\nwent thickly dotted of my allies before ever I touched the age of ten.\r\n\r\nThese meager etchings give some picture of what was my earlier life, the\r\nmajor share of which I ran wild about the streets. Neither my father nor\r\nmy mother lived in any command of me, and the parish priest failed as\r\ndismally as did they when he sought to confine my conduct to a rule.\r\nThat hickory-wielding dominie, with his sandbox and alphabet, was a\r\npriest; and he gave me such a distaste of the clergy that I rolled away\r\nfrom their touch like quicksilver. Anne's tears and the soft voice of\r\nher were what I feared, and so I kept as much as possible beyond their\r\nspell.\r\n\r\nComing now to a day when I began first to consider existence as a\r\nproblem serious, I must tell you how my lone sole claim to eminence\r\nabode in the fact that, lung and limb, I was as strong and tireless as\r\nany bison or any bear. It was my capital, my one virtue, the mark that\r\nset me above my fellows. This story of vast strength sounds the more\r\nstrange, since I was under rather than above the common height, and\r\nnever, until when in later life I took on a thickness of fat, scaled\r\nheavier than one hundred and forty pounds. Thus it stood, however, that\r\nmy muscle strength, even as a youth, went so far beyond what might be\r\ncalled legitimate that it became as a proverb in the mouths of people.\r\nThe gift was a kind of genius; I tell of it particularly because it\r\nturned to be the ladder whereby I climbed into the first of my fortunes.\r\nWithout it, sure, I never would have lifted myself above the gutter\r\nlevels of my mates, nor fingered a splinter of those millions that now\r\nlie banked and waiting to my name and hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II--THE BOSS MEETS WITH POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was when I was in my fifteenth year that face to face I first met\r\npolitics. Or to fit the phrase more nearly with the fact, I should say\r\nit was then when politics met me. Nor was that meeting in its incident\r\none soon to slip from memory. It carried for a darkling element the\r\nlocking of me in a graceless cell, and that is an adventure sure to\r\nleave its impress. The more if one be young, since the trail of events\r\nis ever deepest where the ground is soft. It is no wonder the business\r\nlies in my mind like a black cameo. It was my first captivity, and there\r\nwill come on one no greater horror than seizes him when for the earliest\r\ntime he hears bars and bolts grate home behind him.\r\n\r\nOn that day, had one found and measured me he would not have called me\r\na child of thoughts or books or alcoves. My nature was as unkempt as the\r\nstreets. Still, in a turbid way and to broadest banks, the currents of\r\nmy sentiment were running for honesty and truth. Also, while I wasted no\r\nspace over the question, I took it as I took the skies above me that law\r\nwas for folk guilty of wrong, while justice even against odds of power\r\nwould never fail the weak and right. My eyes were to be opened; I was\r\nto be shown the lesson of Tammany, and how law would bend and judges bow\r\nbefore the mighty breath of the machine.\r\n\r\nIt was in the long shadows of an August afternoon when the Southhampton\r\nboat was docked--a clipper of the Black Ball line. I stood looking on;\r\nmy leisure was spent about the river front, for I was as fond of the\r\nwater as a petrel. The passengers came thronging down the gang-plank;\r\nonce ashore, many of the poorer steerage sort stood about in misty\r\nbewilderment, not knowing the way to turn or where to go.\r\n\r\nIn that far day a special trade had grown up among the piers; the men to\r\nfollow it were called hotel runners. These birds of prey met the\r\nships to swoop on newcomers with lie and cheat, and carry them away\r\nto hostelries whose mean interests they served. These latter were the\r\npoorest in town, besides being often dens of wickedness.\r\n\r\nAs I moved boy-like in and out among the waiting groups of immigrants,\r\na girl called to me. This girl was English, with yellow hair, and cheeks\r\nred as apples. I remember I thought her beautiful, and was the more to\r\nnotice it since she seemed no older than myself. She was stark alone and\r\na trifle frightened.\r\n\r\n“Boy,” said Apple Cheek, “boy, where can I go for to-night? I have\r\nmoney, though not much, so it must not be a dear place.”\r\n\r\nBefore I could set my tongue to a reply, a runner known as Sheeny Joe\r\nhad Apple Cheek by the arm and was for leading her away.\r\n\r\n“Come with me,” said Sheeny Joe to Apple Cheek; “I will show you to a\r\nhouse, as neat as pins, and quiet as a church; kept it is by a Christian\r\nlady as wears out her eyes with searching of the scriptures. You can\r\nstay there as long as ever you likes for two shillin' a day.”\r\n\r\nThis was reeled off by Sheeny Joe with a suave softness like the flow of\r\ntreacle. He was cunning enough to give the charge in shillings so as to\r\nmatch the British ear and education of poor Apple Cheek.\r\n\r\n“Where is this place?” asked Apple Cheek. I could see how she shrunk\r\nfrom Sheeny Joe, with his eyes greedy and black, and small and shiny\r\nlike the eyes of a rat.\r\n\r\n“You wouldn't know the place, young lady,” returned Sheeny Joe; “but\r\nit's all right, with prayers and that sort of thing, both night and\r\nmornin'. It's in Water Street, the place is. Number blank, Water\r\nStreet,” repeated Sheeny Joe, giving a resort known as the Dead Rabbit.\r\n“Come; which ones is your bundles? I'll help you carry them.”\r\n\r\nNow by general word, the Dead Rabbit was not unknown to me. It was\r\nneither tavern nor boarding house, but a mill of vice, with blood on\r\nits doorstep and worse inside. If ever prayers were said there they must\r\nhave been parcel of some Black Sanctus; and if ever a Christian went\r\nthere it was to be robbed and beaten, and then mayhap to have his throat\r\ncut for a lesson in silence.\r\n\r\n“You don't want to go to that house,” said I, finding my voice and\r\nturning to Apple Cheek. “You come to my mother's; my sister will find\r\nyou a place to stay. The house he's talkin' about”--here I indicated\r\nSheeny Joe--“aint no tavern. It's a boozin' ken for crimps and thieves.”\r\n\r\nWithout a word, Sheeny Joe aimed a swinging blow at my head: Apple Cheek\r\ngave a low scream. While somewhat unprepared for Sheeny Joe's attack,\r\nit falling so sharply sudden, I was not to be found asleep; nor would\r\nI prove a simple conquest even to a grown man. My sinister strength,\r\nalmost the strength of a gorilla, would stand my friend.\r\n\r\nQuick as a goat on my feet, and as soon to see a storm coming up as any\r\nsailor, I leaped backward from the blow; and next, before Sheeny Joe\r\nrecovered himself, I was upon him with a wrestler's twitch and trip\r\nthat tossed him high in the air like a rag. He struck on his head and\r\nshoulders, the chimb of a cask against which he rolled cutting a fine\r\ngash in his scalp.\r\n\r\nWith a whirl of oaths, Sheeny Joe tried to scramble to his feet; he was\r\nshaken with rage and wonder to be thus outfaced and worsted by a boy. As\r\nhe gained his knees, and before he might straighten to his ignoble feet,\r\nI dealt him a crashing blow between the eyes, or rather, on the bridge\r\nof the nose, which latter feature for Sheeny Joe grew curved and beaky.\r\nThe blow was of the sort that boxers style a “hook,” and one nothing\r\ngood to stop. Over Sheeny Joe went with the kicking force of it, and lay\r\nagainst the tier of casks, bleeding like tragedy, beaten, and yelling\r\n“murder!”\r\n\r\nSheeny Joe, bleeding and roaring, and I by no means glutted, but still\r\nhungry for his harm, were instantly the center of a gaping crowd that\r\ncame about us like a whirlpool. With the others arrived an officer of\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\n“W'at's the row here?” demanded the officer.\r\n\r\n“Take him to the station!” cried Sheeny Joe, picking himself up, a\r\ndripping picture of blood; “he struck me with a knuckle duster.”\r\n\r\n“Not so fast, officer,” put in a reputable old gentleman. “Hear the\r\nlad's story first. The fellow was saying something to this girl. Nor\r\ndoes he look as though it could have been for her benefit.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me about it, youngster,” said the officer, not unkindly. My age\r\nand weight, as against those of Sheeny Joe, told with this agent of\r\nthe peace, who at heart was a fair man. “Tell me what there is to this\r\nshindy.”\r\n\r\n“Why don't you take him in?” screamed Sheeny Joe. “W'at have you to do\r\nwith his story?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there's two ends to an alley,” retorted the officer warmly. “I'll\r\nhear what the boy has to say. Do you think you're goin' to do all the\r\ntalkin'?”\r\n\r\n“The first thing you'll know,” cried Sheeny Joe fiercely, “I'll have\r\nthem pewter buttons off your coat.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you will!” retorted the officer with a scowl. “Now just for that\r\nI'll take you in. A night in the jug will put the soft pedal on that\r\nmouth of yours.” With that, the bluecoat seized Sheeny Joe, and there we\r\nwere, one in each of his hands.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I had not uttered a syllable. I was ever slow of speech, and\r\nfar better with my hands than my tongue. Apple Cheek, the cause of the\r\nwar, stood weeping not a yard away; perhaps she was thinking, if her\r\nconfusion allowed her thought, of the savageries of this new land to\r\nwhich she was come. Apple Cheek might have taken herself from out the\r\nhubbub by merely merging with the crowd; I think she had the coolness to\r\ndo this, but was too loyal. She owned the spirit, as it stood, to come\r\nforward when I would not say a word to tell the officer the story. Apple\r\nCheek was encouraged to this steadiness by the reputable old gentleman.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, Apple Cheek could win to the end of the first sentence,\r\na burly figure of a man, red of face and broad as a door across the\r\nshoulders, pushed his way through the crowd.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he asked, coming in front of the officer. “Turn that man\r\nloose,” he continued, pointing to Sheeny Joe.\r\n\r\nThe red-faced man spoke in a low tone, but one of cool command. The\r\nofficer, however, was not to be readily driven from his ground; he\r\nwas new to the place and by nature an honest soul. Still, he felt an\r\natmosphere of power about the red-faced personage; wherefore, while he\r\nkept strictest hold on both Sheeny Joe and myself, he was not wanting of\r\nrespect in his response.\r\n\r\n“These two coves are under arrest,” said the officer, shaking Sheeny Joe\r\nand myself like rugs by way of identification.\r\n\r\n“I know,” said the other, still in the low cool tone. “All the same, you\r\nturn this one loose.”\r\n\r\nThe officer still hesitated with a look of half-defiance. With that the\r\nred-faced man lost temper.\r\n\r\n“Take your hands off him, I tell you!” cried the redfaced man, a spark\r\nof anger showing in his small gray eyes. “Do you know me? I'm Big\r\nKennedy. Did you never hear of Big John Kennedy of Tammany Hall? You\r\ndo what I say, or I'll have you out in Harlem with the goats before\r\nto-morrow night.”\r\n\r\nWith that, he of the red face took Sheeny Joe from between the officer's\r\nfingers; nor did the latter seek to detain him. The frown of authority\r\nleft his brow, and his whole face became overcast with a look of surly\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\n“You should have said so at the jump,” remarked the officer sullenly.\r\n“How was I to know who you are?”\r\n\r\n“You're all right,” returned the red-faced one, lapsing into an easy\r\nsmile. “You're new to this stroll; you'll be wiser by an' by.”\r\n\r\n“What'll I do with the boy?” asked the officer.\r\n\r\n“Officer,” broke in the reputable old gentleman, who was purple to the\r\npoint apoplectic; “officer, do you mean that you will take your orders\r\nfrom this man?”\r\n\r\n“Come, my old codger,” interrupted the red-faced one loftily, “stow\r\nthat. You had better sherry for Fift' Avenue where you belong. If you\r\ndon't, th' gang down here may get tired, d'ye see, an' put you in\r\nthe river.” Then to the officer: “Take the boy in; I'll look him over\r\nlater.”\r\n\r\n“An' the girl!” screamed Sheeny Joe. “I want her lagged too.”\r\n\r\n“An' the girl, officer,” commanded the red-faced one. “Take her along\r\nwith the boy.”\r\n\r\nThus was the procession made up; the officer led Apple Cheek and myself\r\nto the station, with Sheeny Joe, still bleeding, and the red-faced man\r\nto be his backer, bringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nAt the station it was like the whirl and roar of some storm to me. It\r\nwas my first captivity--my first collision with the police, and my wits\r\nwere upside down. I recall that a crowd of people followed us, and were\r\nmade to stand outside the door.\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman came also, and tried to interefere in behalf\r\nof Apple Cheek and myself. At a sign from the red-faced man, who stood\r\nleaning on the captain's desk with all the confidence of life, that\r\npotentate gave his sharp command.\r\n\r\n“Screw out!” cried he, to the reputable old gentleman. “We don't want\r\nany of your talk!” Then to an officer in the station: “Put him out!”\r\n\r\n“I'm a taxpayer!” shouted the reputable old gentleman furiously.\r\n\r\n“You'll pay a fine,” responded the captain with a laugh, “if you kick up\r\na row 'round my station. Now screw out, or I'll put you the wrong side of\r\nthe grate.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman was thrust into the street with about as\r\nmuch ceremony as might attend the delivery of a bale of goods at one's\r\ndoor. He disappeared, declaring he would have justice; at which a smile\r\nwidened the faces of the sophisticated officers, several of whom were\r\nlounging about the room.\r\n\r\n“He'll have justice!” repeated the captain with a chuckle. “Say! he\r\naought to put that in the Joe Miller Joke-book.” Then to the red-faced\r\nman, who still leaned against the desk, the image of autocracy sure of\r\nitself: “What is it to be, Mr. Kennedy?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” quoth the red-faced one, “you must lock this boy up. Yes, an' the\r\ngirl, too; she had better go in for the night. I'll take a look into th'\r\nbusiness, an' let the judge know in the mornin'.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think, captain,” interposed the officer who brought us from the\r\ndocks, “there's any use locking up these people. It was nothin' but a\r\ncheap muss on the pier.”\r\n\r\n“Say! I don't stand that!” broke in Sheeny Joe. “This party smashed me\r\nwith a bar of iron. The girl was in the play; an' I say they're both to\r\ngo in.”\r\n\r\n“You 'say,'” mocked the captain, in high scorn. “An' who are you? Who is\r\nthis fellow?” he demanded, looking about him.\r\n\r\n“He's one of my people,” said the red-faced man, still coolly by the\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n“No more out of you!” snarled the captain to the kindly officer, as the\r\nlatter again tried to speak; “you get back to your beat!”\r\n\r\n“An' say!” cried the red-faced man, slowly rousing from his position\r\nby the desk; “before you go, let me give you a word. You're a sight too\r\ngabby; you had better think more and say less, or you won't last long\r\nenough as a copper to wear out that new uniform. An' if anybody asks,\r\ntell him it was Big Kennedy that told you.”\r\n\r\nThey led me to a cell, while poor Apple Cheek, almost fainting, was\r\ncarried to another. As I was being taken away, Anne came rushing in. Bad\r\nnews is a creature of wings, and Anne had been told my adventures by\r\na small urchin who ran himself nearly to death in defeating two fellow\r\nurchins for the privilege before I had reached the station.\r\n\r\nAnne did not observe me as she came in, for I stood somewhat to the\r\nrear, with several turnkeys and officers between. I could see the white\r\nface of her, and how the lamps of a great alarm were lighted in her\r\neyes. Her voice was so low with terror I could not hear her words.\r\nEvidently she was pleading, girl-fashion, for my liberty. The tones of\r\nthe captain, however, rose clear and high.\r\n\r\n“That'll do ye now,” said he in a manner of lordly insolence, looking\r\nup from the desk to which he had returned. “If we put a prisoner on\r\nthe pavement every time a good-looking girl rushed in with a yarn about\r\nbein' his sister, we wouldn't need no cells at all. This boy stays till\r\nthe judge takes a look at him in the mornin'. Meanwhile, you had better\r\nget back to your window, or all the men will have left the street.”\r\n\r\nAt this, a mighty anger flamed up in my heart. I tore away from the\r\nofficer who had me by the shoulders, and, save that three others as\r\npracticed in the sleight of it as football players instantly seized me,\r\nI should have gone straight at the captain's neck like a bulldog.\r\n\r\n“I'll have his life!” I foamed.\r\n\r\nThe next moment I was thrown into a cell. The door slammed; the lock\r\nshot home; with that, my heart seemed to turn to water in my bosom and I\r\nsank upon the stone floor of my cage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III--THE BOSS SEES THE POWER OF TAMMANY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT night under lock and key was a night of laughed and screamed like\r\nbedlam. Once I heard the low click of sobs, and thought it might be poor\r\nunhappy Apple Cheek. The surmise went wide, for she was held in another\r\npart of the prison.\r\n\r\nIt was in the first streaks of the morning before I slept. My slumbers\r\ndid not last long; it seemed as though I had but shut my eyes when a\r\nloud rap of iron on iron brought me up, and there stood one armed of a\r\nkey so large it might have done for the gate of a giant's castle. It was\r\nthis man hammering with his weapon on the grate of my cell that roused\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“Now then, young gallows-bird,” said the functionary, “be you ready for\r\ncourt?”\r\n\r\nThe man, while rough, gave me no hard impression, for he wore a tolerant\r\ngrin and had eyes of friendly brown. These amiable signs endowed me with\r\ncourage to ask a question.\r\n\r\n“What will they do with me?” I queried. I was long delirium. Drunken men\r\nbabbled and cursed and shouted; while a lunatic creature anxious, for I\r\nhad no experience to be my guide. “What will they do? Will they let me\r\ngo?”\r\n\r\n“Sure! they'll let you go.” My hopes gained their feet. “To\r\nBlackwell's.” My hopes lay prone again.\r\n\r\nThe turnkey, for such was the man's station, had but humored me with\r\none of the stock jokes of the place. On seeing my distress, and perhaps\r\nremembering that I should be something tender if years were to count,\r\nand no frequent tenant of the cells with sensibilities trained to the\r\nsafe consistency of leather, he made me further reply.\r\n\r\n“No, I'll tell you the truth, youngster. If you plead guilty, an'\r\nthere's no one there but the cop, it'll be about ten dollars or twenty\r\ndays on the Island. But if Sheeny Joe comes 'round to exhibit his nose,\r\nor Big Kennedy shows up to stall ag'inst you, why I should say you might\r\ntake six months and call yourself in luck.”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to brighten the eye in the story, and my ribs seemed\r\nto inclose a heart of wood.\r\n\r\nWith a vile dozen to be my companions, frowsy, bleary creatures, some\r\nshaking with the dumb ague of drink whose fires had died out, I was\r\ndriven along a narrow corridor, up a pair of stairs, and into a room of\r\nrespectable size! Its dimensions, however, would be its only claim to\r\nrespectability, for the walls and ceiling were smoke-blackened, while\r\nthe floor might have come the better off for a pailful of soap and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nOnce within the room I found myself in a railed pen. Against the wall,\r\nwith a desk before him and raised above the herd by a platform, sat the\r\nmagistrate. There was a fence which divided the big room, and beyond and\r\nleaning on it lolled the public, leering and listening, as hard an array\r\nas one might wish to see. One might have sentenced the entire roomful to\r\nthe workhouse and made few mistakes.\r\n\r\nInside this fence, and gathered for the most part about the magistrate,\r\nwere those who had business with the court; officers, witnesses, friends\r\nand enemies of the accused, with last although not least a collection of\r\nthe talent of the bar. Many of these latter were brisk Jews, and all of\r\nthem were marked by soiled linen, frayed elbows, greasy collars, and an\r\nevident carelessness as to the state of their hands and faces. There\r\nwere boys to wait on these folk of law, a boy to each I should say. None\r\nof these urchins was older than was I, and some no more than twelve.\r\nThey carried baize bags, chatted gravely while waiting the call of their\r\nmasters, and gave themselves strutting airs and brows of consequence.\r\nThese engaging children, in a spirit of loyalty, doubtless, showed\r\nthemselves as untainted of water as were their betters.\r\n\r\nWhile I rehearse these sordid appearances as developed in the dim lights\r\nwhich through the grimy windows fell across the scene, you are not to\r\nsuppose the notice of them preyed upon me. I was, in that hour, neither\r\nso squeamish nor so observant as to make particular note of them, nor\r\nwas I to that degree the slave of soap in my own roving person, as to\r\njustify the risk of strictures which might provoke retort. Besides, I\r\nwas thinking dolefully on that trip to Blackwell's Island whereof the\r\nfuture seemed so full, and my eyes scanned the judge on the bench rather\r\nthan lesser folk who were not so important in my affairs.\r\n\r\nWhile in the mills of great misery, still I was steady enough. I turned\r\nmy gaze upon the magistrate, and sought in his looks and words, as he\r\nwent about the sorry destinies of other delinquents, some slant of what\r\nI might look forward to for myself. The dignitary in question showed\r\nlean and sallow and bald, with a sly face and an eye whereof the great\r\nexpression was one of sleepless self-interest. He did not come upon you\r\nas either brave or good, but he had nothing brutal or vindictive, and\r\nhis timid mealy voice was shaken by a quaver that seemed a perpetual\r\napology for what judgments he from time to time would pass. His\r\nsentences were invariably light, except in instances where some strong\r\ninfluence from the outside, generally a politician or the agent of a big\r\ncompany, arose to demand severity.\r\n\r\nWhile within the railed pen with those other unfortunates whom the\r\ndragnets of the police had brought to these mean shores, and in an\r\ninterval when my fascinated eyes were off the magistrate, I caught sight\r\nof Anne and my father. They had seats inside the fence. The latter's\r\nface was clouded with simple trouble; he wore his Sunday coat, and\r\nhis hands, hard and showing the stains of his forge, roved in uneasy\r\nalternation from his pockets to his lapels and back again. Anne's young\r\neyes were worn and tired, for she had slept as little as had I and wept\r\nmuch more the night before. I could not discover Apple Cheek, although I\r\nlooked about the room for her more than once. I had it in my hopes\r\nthat they had given Apple Cheek her freedom, and the thought was a\r\nhalf-relief. Nothing of such decent sort had come to pass, however;\r\nApple Cheek was waiting with two or three harridans, her comrades of the\r\ncells, in an adjoining room.\r\n\r\nWhen my name was called, an officer of the court opened a gate in the\r\nprisoner's pen and motioned me to come forth.\r\n\r\n“Hurry up!” said the officer, who was for expedition. “W'at's the\r\ntrouble with your heels? You aint got no ball an' chain on yet, you\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nThen he gave me a chair in front of the magistrate, where the man of\r\npower might run me up and down with his shifty deprecatory eye.\r\n\r\n“There was a girl brought in with him, your honor,” remarked the officer\r\nat the gate.\r\n\r\n“Have her out, then,” said the magistrate; whereupon Apple Cheek, a bit\r\ndisheveled and cheeks redder than ever with the tears she had shed, was\r\nproduced and given a seat by my side.\r\n\r\n“Who complains of these defendants?” asked the magistrate in a mild\r\nnon-committal voice, glancing about the room.\r\n\r\n“I do, your honor.”\r\n\r\nIt was Sheeny Joe who came pushing to the fore from a far corner. His\r\nhead had received the benefit of several bandages, and it gave me a\r\ndullish joy to think it was I to furnish the reason of them.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate appeared to know Sheeny Joe, and to hold him in regard\r\nat that. The moment my enemy declared himself as the complainant, and\r\nno one springing up to take my part, the magistrate bent upon me a\r\nstony glance that spoke plainly of those six months concerning which the\r\nturnkey told. I gave up everything, myself and Apple Cheek, as surely\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n“Tell your story,” said the magistrate to Sheeny Joe. His manner was\r\nfull of commiseration for that unworthy. “What did he assault you with?”\r\n\r\n“With a blackjack, your honor, or a piece of lead pipe,” replied Sheeny\r\nJoe. “He struck me when I wasn't lookin'. I'm busy trying to tell the\r\ngirl there w'at hotel she wants. He gives it to me over the head from\r\nbehind; then as I wheels, he smashes me across the nose. I couldn't see\r\nwith w'at, but it was a bar of some kind, mebby iron, mebby lead. As I\r\ngoes down, I hears the sketch--the girl, I mean--sing out, 'Kill him!'\r\nThe girl was eggin' him on, your honor.”\r\n\r\nSheeny Joe unwound this string of lies without hitch or pause, and\r\nwithal so rapidly it fair stole my breath away. I felt the eyes of the\r\nmagistrate upon me; I knew my danger and yet could come by no words\r\nfor my own defense. I make no doubt, had it not been for a diversion\r\nas unlooked-for as it was welcome, I would have been marked for prison\r\nwhere I stood.\r\n\r\n“I demand to be heard,” came suddenly, in a high angry voice. “What that\r\nrogue has just uttered is all a pack of lies together!”\r\n\r\nIt was the reputable old gentleman of the evening before who thus\r\nthrew himself in the way of events. Being escorted through the press of\r\nonlookers by an officer, the reputable old gentleman stood squarely in\r\nfront of the magistrate.\r\n\r\n“I demand justice for that boy,” fumed the reputable old gentleman,\r\nglaring at the magistrate, and growing crimson in the face; “I demand\r\na jury. As for the girl, she wasn't ten minutes off the boat; her only\r\npart in the offense would seem to be that this scoundrel,” pointing to\r\nSheeny Joe, “was striving to lure her to a low resort.”\r\n\r\n“The Dead Rabbit a low resort!” cried Sheeny\r\n\r\nJoe indignantly. “The place is as straight as a gun.”\r\n\r\n“Will you please tell me who you are?” asked the magistrate of the\r\nreputable old gentleman. He had resumed his non-committal look. The\r\nconfident vigor of the reputable old gentleman disconcerted him and made\r\nhim wary.\r\n\r\n“I am a taxpayer,” said the reputable old gentleman; “yes,” donning an\r\nair as though the thunders and lightnings of politics dwelt in the word,\r\n“yes, your honor, a taxpayer. I do not know this boy, but here are his\r\nfather and sister to speak for him.” Then, as he caught sight of the\r\ncaptain who had ordered him out of the station: “There is a man, your\r\nhonor, who by the hands of his minions drove me from a public police\r\noffice--me, a taxpayer!”\r\n\r\nThe captain grinned easily to find himself thus distinguished. The grin\r\nirritated the reputable old gentleman, who was even more peppery than\r\nreputable.\r\n\r\n“Smile, sir!” cried the reputable old gentleman, shaking his wrathful\r\nfinger at the captain. “I shall have you before your superiors on\r\ncharges before I'm done!”\r\n\r\n“That's what they all say,” remarked the captain, stifling a yawn.\r\n\r\n“One thing at a time, sir,” said the magistrate to the reputable\r\nold gentleman. His attitude was wheedling and propitiatory. “Did I\r\nunderstand you to say that the gentleman and the lady at your back are\r\nthe father and sister of this boy?”\r\n\r\nMy father and Anne had taken their stations to the rear of the reputable\r\nold gentleman. The latter, looking around as if to identify them,\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n“If the court please, I'm told so.”\r\n\r\n“Your honor,” broke in Sheeny Joe with a front of injury, “w'at's that\r\ngot to do with his sandbaggin' me? Am I to be murdered w'en peacefully\r\nabout me business, just 'cause a guy's got a father?”\r\n\r\n“What were you saying to this girl?” asked the magistrate mildly of\r\nSheeny Joe, and indicating Apple Cheek with his eye where she sat\r\ntearful and frightened by my side. “This gentleman”--the reputable old\r\ngentleman snorted fiercely--“declares that you were about to lure her to\r\na low resort.”\r\n\r\n“Your honor, it was the Dead Rabbit,” said Sheeny Joe.\r\n\r\n“Is the Dead Rabbit,” observed the magistrate, to the captain, who was\r\nstill lounging about, “is the Dead Rabbit a place of good repute?”\r\n\r\n“It aint no Astor House,” replied the captain, “but no one expects an\r\nAstor House in Water Street.”\r\n\r\n“Is it a resort for thieves?”\r\n\r\nThe magistrate still advanced his queries in a fashion apologetic and\r\nsubdued. The reputable old gentleman impressed him as one he would not\r\nlike to offend. Then, too, there was my father--an honest working-man by\r\nplain testimony of his face. On the other hand stood Sheeny Joe, broken\r\nof nose, bandaged, implacable. Here were three forces of politics,\r\naccording to our magistrate, who was thinking on a re-election; he would\r\nprefer to please them all. Obviously, he in no sort delighted in his\r\npresent position, since whichever way he turned it might be a turn\r\ntoward future disaster for himself.\r\n\r\n“Is the Dead Rabbit a resort for thieves?” again asked the magistrate.\r\n\r\n“Well,” replied the captain judgmatically, “even a crook has got to go\r\nsomewhere. That is,” he added, “when he aint in hock.”\r\n\r\nWhere this criss-cross colloquy of justice or injustice might have left\r\nme, and whether free or captive, I may only guess. The proceedings were\r\nto gain another and a final interruption. This time it was the red-faced\r\nman, he who had called himself “Big Kennedy,” to come panting into the\r\npresence of the court. The red-faced man had hurried up the stairs,\r\nthree steps at a time, and it told upon his breathing.\r\n\r\nThe magistrate made a most profound bow to the red-faced man.\r\nRemembering the somber prophecy of him with the big key, should “Big\r\nKennedy show up to Stall ag'inst me,” my hope, which had revived with\r\nthe stand taken by the reputable old gentleman, sunk now to lowest\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\n“What will you have, Mr. Kennedy?” purred the magistrate obsequiously.\r\n\r\n“Is the court going to dispose of the cases of this boy and this girl?”\r\n interrupted the reputable old gentleman warmly. “I demand a jury trial\r\nfor both of them. I am a taxpayer and propose to have justice.”\r\n\r\n“Hold up, old sport, hold up!” exclaimed the redfaced man in cheerful\r\ntones. He was addressing the reputable old gentleman. “Let me get to\r\nwork. I'll settle this thing like throwin' dice.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, sir, by calling me an old sport?” demanded the\r\nreputable old gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe red-faced man did not heed the question, but wheeled briskly on the\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\n“Your honor,” said the red-faced man, “there's nothin' to this. Sheeny\r\nJoe there has made a misdeal, that's all. I've looked the case over,\r\nyour honor; there's nothin' in it; you can let the girl an' the boy go.”\r\n\r\n“But he said the Dead Rabbit was a drum for crooks!” protested Sheeny\r\nJoe, speaking to the redfaced man.\r\n\r\n“S'ppose he did,” retorted the other, “that don't take a dollar out of\r\nthe drawer.”\r\n\r\n“An' he's to break my nose an' get away?” complained Sheeny Joe.\r\n\r\n“Well, you oughter to take care of your nose,” said the red-faced man,\r\n“an' not go leavin' it lyin' around where a kid can break it.”\r\n\r\nSheeny Joe was not to be shaken off; he engaged in violent argument with\r\nthe red-faced man. Their tones, however, were now more guarded, and no\r\none might hear their words beyond themselves. While this went forward,\r\nthe magistrate, to save his dignity, perhaps, and not to have it look as\r\nthough he were waiting for orders, pretended to be writing in his book\r\nof cases which lay open on his desk.\r\n\r\nIt was Sheeny Joe to bring the discussion between himself and the\r\nred-faced man to an end. Throughout the whispered differences between\r\nthem, differences as to what should be my fate, Sheeny Joe showed hot\r\nwith fury, while the red-faced man was cool and conciliatory; his voice\r\nwhen one caught some sound of it was coaxing.\r\n\r\n“There's been enough said!” cried Sheeny Joe, suddenly walking away from\r\nthe red-faced man. “No duck is goin' to break my nose for fun.”\r\n\r\n“The boy's goin' loose,” observed the red-faced man in placid\r\ncontradiction. “An' the girl goes to her friends, wherever they be, an'\r\nthey aint at the Dead Rabbit.” Then in a blink the countenance of\r\nthe redfaced man went from calm to rage. He whirled Sheeny Joe by the\r\nshoulder. “See here!” he growled, “one more roar out of you, an' I'll\r\nstand you up right now, an' it's you who will take sixty days, or\r\nmy name aint Big John Kennedy. If you think that's a bluff, call it.\r\nAnother yeep, an' the boat's waitin' for you! You've been due at the\r\nIsland for some time.”\r\n\r\n“That's all right, Mr. Kennedy!” replied Sheeny Joe, his crest falling,\r\nand the sharpest terror in his face, “that's all right! You know me? Of\r\ncourse it goes as you say! Did you ever know me to buck ag'inst you?”\r\n\r\nThe red-faced man smiled ferociously. The anger faded from his brow,\r\nand leaving Sheeny Joe without further word, he again spoke to the\r\nmagistrate.\r\n\r\n“The charges ag'inst these two children, your honor, are withdrawn.” He\r\nspoke in his old cool tones. “Captain,” he continued, addressing that\r\ndignitary, “send one of your plain-clothes people with this girl to find\r\nher friends for her. Tell him he mustn't make any mistakes.”\r\n\r\n“The cases are dismissed,” said the magistrate, making an entry in his\r\nbook. He appeared relieved with the change in the situation; almost as\r\nmuch, if that were possible, as myself. “The cases are dismissed; no\r\ncosts to be taxed. I think that is what you desire, Mr. Kennedy?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your honor.” Then coming over to where I sat, the red-faced man\r\ncontinued: “You hunt me up to-morrow--Big John Kennedy--that's my name.\r\nAny cop can tell you where to find me.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” I answered faintly.\r\n\r\n“There's two things about you,” said the red-faced man, rubbing my\r\nstubble of hair with his big paw, “that's great in a boy. You can hit\r\nlike the kick of a pony; an' you can keep your mouth shut. I aint heard\r\na yelp out of you, mor'n if you was a Boston terrier.” This, admiringly.\r\n\r\nAs we left the magistrate's office--the red-faced man, the reputable old\r\ngentleman, my father, Apple Cheek, and myself, with Anne holding my\r\nhand as though I were some treasure lost and regained--the reputable old\r\ngentleman spoke up pompously to the red-faced man.\r\n\r\n“I commend what you have done, sir; but in that connection, and as\r\na taxpayer, let me tell you that I resent your attitude towards the\r\nmagistrate. You issued your orders, sir, and conducted yourself toward\r\nthat officer of justice as though you owned him.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what of it?” returned the red-faced man composedly. “I put him\r\nthere. What do you think I put him there for? To give me the worst of\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Sir, I do not understand your expressions!” said the reputable old\r\ngentleman. “And I resent them! Yes, sir, I resent them as a taxpayer of\r\nthis town!”\r\n\r\n“Say,” observed the red-faced man benignantly, “there's nothin' wrong\r\nabout you but your head. You had better take a term or two at night\r\nschool an' get it put on straight. You say you're a taxpayer; you've\r\nalready fired the fact at me about five times. An' now I ask you:\r\nSuppose you be?”\r\n\r\n“Taxpayer; yes, sir, taxpayer!” repeated the reputable old gentleman,\r\nin a mighty fume. “Do you intend to tell me there's no meaning to the\r\nword?”\r\n\r\n“It means,” said the red-faced man in the slow manner of one who gives\r\ninstruction; “it means that if you're nothin' but a taxpayer--an' I\r\ndon't think you be or you'd have told us--you might as well sit down.\r\nYou're a taxpayer, eh? All right; I'm a ward-leader of Tammany Hall.\r\nYou're a taxpayer; good! I'm the man that settles how much you pay, d'ye\r\nsee!” Then, as though sympathy and disgust were blended: “Old man, you\r\ngo home and take a hard look at the map, and locate yourself. You don't\r\nknow it, but all the same you're in New York.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV--THE BOSS ENTERS THE PRIMARY GRADE OF POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nPERHAPS you will say I waste space and lay too much of foolish stress\r\nupon my quarrel with Sheeny Joe and its police-cell consequences. And\r\nyet you should be mindful of the incident's importance to me as the\r\nstarting point of my career. For I read in what took place the power of\r\nthe machine as you will read this printed page. I went behind the bars\r\nby the word of Big John Kennedy; and it was by his word that I emerged\r\nand took my liberty again. And yet who was Big John Kennedy? He was the\r\nmachine; the fragment of its power which molded history in the little\r\nregion where I lived. As mere John Kennedy he would be nothing. Or at\r\nthe most no more than other men about him. But as “Big John Kennedy,”\r\n an underchief of Tammany Hall, I myself stood witness while a captain of\r\npolice accepted his commands without a question, and a magistrate found\r\nfolk guilty or innocent at the lifting of his finger. Also, that sweat\r\nof terror to sprinkle the forehead of Sheeny Joe, when in his moment of\r\nrebellion he found himself beneath the wrathful shadow of the machine,\r\nwas not the least impressive element of my experience; and the tolerant\r\nsmile, that was half pity, half amusement, as Big Kennedy set forth\r\nto the reputable old gentleman--who was only “a taxpayer”--the little\r\nlimits of his insignificance, deepened the effect upon my mind of what\r\nhad gone before.\r\n\r\nTrue, I indulged in no such analysis as the above, and made no study of\r\nthe picture in its detail; but I could receive an impression just as\r\nI might receive a blow, and in the innocence of my ignorance began\r\ninstantly to model myself upon the proven fact of a power that was above\r\nlaw, above justice, and which must be consulted and agreed with, even\r\nin its caprice, before existence could be profitable or even safe. From\r\nthat moment the machine to me was as obviously and indomitably abroad as\r\nthe pavement under foot, and must have its account in every equation\r\nof life to the solution whereof I was set. To hold otherwise, and\r\nparticularly to act otherwise, would be to play the fool, with failure\r\nor something worse for a reward.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy owned a drinking place. His barroom was his headquarters;\r\nalthough he himself never served among his casks and bottles, having\r\nbarmen for that work. He poured no whisky, tapped no beer, donned no\r\napron, but sat at tables with his customers and laid out his campaigns\r\nof politics or jubilated over victory, and seemed rather the visitor\r\nthan the proprietor in his own saloon. He owned shrewdness, force,\r\ncourage, enterprise, and was one of those who carry a pleasant\r\natmosphere that is like hypnotism, and which makes men like them. His\r\nmanner was one of rude frankness, and folk held him for a bluff, blunt,\r\ngenial soul, who made up in generosity what he lacked of truth.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I have thought folk mistaken in Big Kennedy. For all his loud\r\nopenness and friendly roar, which would seem to tell his every thought,\r\nthe man could be the soul of cunning and turn secret as a mole. He was\r\nfor his own interest; he came and went a cold calculating trader of\r\npolitics; he never wasted his favors, but must get as much as he gave,\r\nand indulged in no revenges except when revenge was needed for a lesson.\r\nHe did what men call good, too, and spent money and lost sleep in its\r\naccomplishment. To the ill he sent doctors and drugs; he found work and\r\nwages for idle men; he paid landlords and kept the roofs above the heads\r\nof the penniless; where folk were hungry he sent food, and where they\r\nwere cold came fuel.\r\n\r\nFor all that, it was neither humanity nor any milk of kindness which\r\nput him to these labors of grace; it was but his method of politics and\r\nmeant to bind men to him. They must do his word; they must carry out his\r\nwill; then it was he took them beneath the wing of his power and would\r\nspare neither time nor money to protect and prosper them.\r\n\r\nAnd on the other side, he who raised his head in opposition to Big\r\nKennedy was crushed; not in anger, but in caution. He weeded out\r\nrebellion, and the very seed of it, with as little scruple and for the\r\nsame reason a farmer weeds a field.\r\n\r\nIt took me years to collect these truths of Big Kennedy. Nor was their\r\narrival when they did come one by one, to make a shade of change in my\r\nregard for him. I liked him in the beginning; I liked him in the end;\r\nhe became that headland on the coasts of politics by which I steered my\r\ncourse. I studied Big Kennedy as one might study a science; by the lines\r\nof his conduct I laid down lines for my own; in all things I was his\r\ndisciple and his imitator.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy is dead now; and I will say no worse nor better of him than\r\nthis: He was a natural captain of men. Had he been born to a higher\r\nstation, he might have lighted a wick in history that would require\r\nthose ten thicknesses of darkness which belong with ten centuries, to\r\nobscure. But no such thing could come in the instance of Big Kennedy;\r\nhis possibilities of eminence, like my own, were confined to Tammany and\r\nits politics, since he had no more of education than have I. The time\r\nhas gone by in the world at large, and had in Big Kennedy's day, when\r\nthe ignorant man can be the first man.\r\n\r\nUpon the day following my release, as he had bid me.\r\n\r\nI sought Big Kennedy. He was in his barroom, and the hour being\r\nmid-morning I was so far lucky as to find him quite alone. He was quick\r\nto see me, too, and seemed as full of a pleasant interest in me as\r\nthough my simple looks were of themselves good news. He did most of the\r\ntalking, for I sat backward and bashful, the more since I could feel his\r\nsharp eyes upon me, taking my measure. Never was I so looked over and\r\nso questioned, and not many minutes had come and gone before Big Kennedy\r\nknew as much of me and my belongings as did I myself. Mayhap more; for\r\nhe weighed me in the scales of his experience with all the care of gold,\r\nconsidering meanwhile to what uses I should be put, and how far I might\r\nbe expected to advance his ends.\r\n\r\nOne of his words I recall, for it gave me a glow of relief at the time;\r\nat that it was no true word. It was when he heard how slightly I had\r\nbeen taught of books.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said he, “books as often as not get between a party's legs\r\nand trip him up. Better know men than books. There's my library.” Here\r\nhe pointed to a group about a beer table. “I can learn more by studyin'\r\nthem than was ever found between the covers of a book, and make more out\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy told me I must go to work.\r\n\r\n“You've got to work, d'ye see,” said he, “if it's only to have an excuse\r\nfor livin'.”\r\n\r\nThen he asked me what I could do. On making nothing clear by my\r\nreplies--for I knew of nothing--he descended to particulars.\r\n\r\n“What do you know of horses? Can you drive one?”\r\n\r\nMy eye brightened; I might be trusted to handle a horse.\r\n\r\n“An' I'll gamble you know your way about the East Side,” said he\r\nconfidently; “I'll answer for that.” Then getting up he started for the\r\ndoor, for no grass grew between decision and action with Big Kennedy.\r\n“Come with me,” he said.\r\n\r\nWe had made no mighty journey when we stopped before a grocery. It was\r\na two-store front, and of a prosperous look, with a wealth of vegetables\r\nand fruits in crates, and baskets, and barrels, covering half the\r\nsidewalk. The proprietor was a rubicund German, who bustled forth at\r\nsight of my companion.\r\n\r\n“How is Mr. Kennedy?” This with exuberance. “It makes me prout that you\r\npay me a wisit.”\r\n\r\n“Yes?” said the other dryly. Then, going directly to the point: “Here's\r\na boy I've brought you, Nick. Let him drive one of your wagons. Give him\r\nsix dollars a week.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Kennedy,” replied the grocer dubiously, looking me over with\r\nthe tail of his eye, “I haf yet no wacancy. My wagons is all full.”\r\n\r\n“I'm goin' to get him new duds,” said Big Kennedy, “if that's what\r\nyou're thinkin' about.”\r\n\r\nStill, the grocer, though not without some show of respectful alarm,\r\ninsisted on a first position.\r\n\r\n“If he was so well dressed even as you, Mr. Kennedy, yet I haf no\r\nwacancy,” said he.\r\n\r\n“Then make one,” responded Big Kennedy coolly. “Dismiss one of the boys\r\nyou have, d'ye see? At least two who work for you don't belong in my\r\nward.” As the other continued doubtful Big Kennedy became sharp. “Come,\r\ncome, come!” he cried in a manner peremptory rather than fierce; “I\r\ncan't wait all day. Don't you feed your horses in the street? Don't you\r\nobstruct the sidewalks with your stuff? Don't you sell liquor in your\r\nrear room without a license? Don't you violate a dozen ordinances? Don't\r\nthe police stand it an' pass you up? An' yet you hold me here fiddlin'\r\nand foolin' away time!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, Mr. Kennedy,” cried the grocer, who from the first had sought\r\nto stem the torrent of the other's eloquence, “I was only try in' to\r\nthink up w'ich horse I will let him drive alreatty. That's honest! sure\r\nas my name is Nick Fogel!”\r\n\r\nClothed in what was to me the splendors of a king, being indeed a full\r\nnew suit bought with Big Kennedy's money, I began rattling about the\r\nstreets with a delivery wagon the very next day. As well as I could, I\r\ntried to tell my thanks for the clothes.\r\n\r\n“That's all right,” said Big Kennedy. “I owe you that much for havin'\r\nyou chucked into a cell.”\r\n\r\nWhile Grocer Fogel might have been a trifle slow in hiring me, once I\r\nwas engaged he proved amiable enough. I did my work well too, missing\r\nfew of the customers and losing none of the baskets and sacks. Grocer\r\nFogel was free with his praise and conceded my value. Still, since he\r\ninstantly built a platform in the street on the strength of my being\r\nemployed, and so violated a new and further ordinance upon which he\r\nfor long had had an eye, I have sometimes thought that in forming his\r\nopinion of my worth he included this misdemeanor in his calculations.\r\nHowever, I worked with my worthy German four years; laying down the\r\nreins of that delivery wagon of my own will at the age of nineteen.\r\n\r\nNor was I without a profit in this trade of delivering potatoes and\r\ncabbages and kindred grocery forage. It broadened the frontiers of my\r\nacquaintance, and made known to me many of a solvent middle class, and\r\nof rather a higher respectability than I might otherwise have met. It\r\nserved to clean up my manners, if nothing more, and before I was done,\r\nthat acquaintance became with me an asset of politics.\r\n\r\nWhile I drove wagon for Grocer Fogel, my work of the day was over with\r\nsix o'clock. I had nothing to do with the care of the horses; I threw\r\nthe reins to a stable hand when at evening I went to the barn, and left\r\nfor my home without pausing to see the animals out of the straps or\r\ntheir noses into the corn. Now, had I been formed with a genius for it,\r\nI might have put in a deal of time at study. But nothing could have been\r\nmore distant from my taste or habit; neither then nor later did I engage\r\nmyself in any traffic with books, and throughout my life never opened a\r\nhalf-dozen.\r\n\r\nStill, considering those plans I had laid down for myself, and that\r\nfuture of politics to which my ambition began to consider, I cannot\r\nsay I threw away my leisure. If my nose were not between the pages of\r\na book, my hands were within a pair of boxing gloves, and I, engaged\r\nagainst this or that opponent, was leading or guarding, hitting or\r\nstopping, rushing or getting away, and fitting to an utmost hand and\r\nfoot and eye and muscle for the task of beating a foeman black and blue\r\nshould the accidents or duties of life place one before me.\r\n\r\nAnd I prospered with my boxing. I think I owned much native stomach for\r\nthe business, since in my sullen fashion I was as near the touch of true\r\nhappiness when in the midst of a mill as ever I hope to stand. My heart,\r\nand with that word I mean courage, was of fighting sort. While I was\r\nexceedingly cautious, my caution was based on courage. Men of this stamp\r\nstay until the last and either conquer or fall. There be ones who have\r\ncourage, but their construction is the other way about. Their courage is\r\nbased on caution; such if hard bested run away. Should you seek the man\r\nwho will stand to the work of battle to the dour end, pick him whose\r\ncaution, coming first in the procession of his nature, is followed by\r\nhis courage, rather than that one whose caution follows his courage to\r\ntap it on the shoulder, preach to it of peril, and counsel flight.\r\n\r\nYou are not to assume that I went about these boxing gymnastics because\r\nof any savageries or blood-hunger dominant in my breast, or was moved\r\nsolely of that instinct by which the game-cock fights. I went to my\r\nfist-studies as the result of thought and calculation. In my slow way\r\nI had noted how those henchmen of the inner circle who surrounded Big\r\nKennedy--those who were near to him, and upon whom he most relied,\r\nwere wholly valued by him for the two matters of force of fist and that\r\nfidelity which asks no question. Even a thicker intellect than mine\r\nwould have seen that to succeed as I proposed, I must be the gladiator.\r\nWherefore, I boxed and wrestled and perfected my muscles; also as\r\ncorollary I avoided drink and tobacco as I would two poisons.\r\n\r\nAnd Big Kennedy, who had a little of his eye on me most of the time, was\r\nso good as to approve. He applauded my refusal of alcohol and tobacco.\r\nAnd he indorsed my determination to be a boxer.\r\n\r\n“A man who can take care of himself with his hands,” said he, “an' who\r\nnever lets whisky fool him or steal his head, can go far in this game of\r\npolitics. An' it's a pretty good game at that, is politics, and can be\r\nbrought to pay like a bank.”\r\n\r\nIt chanced that I met with an adventure which added to my celebration\r\nin a way I could have wished. I was set upon by a drunken fellow--a\r\nstranger. He was an invader, bent upon mischief and came from an\r\nadjacent and a rival ward. I had offered no provocation; why he selected\r\nme to be his victim and whether it were accident or design I cannot say.\r\nPossibly I was pointed out to this drinking Hotspur as one from whose\r\nconquest honor would flow; perhaps some enemy of the pattern of Sheeny\r\nJoe had set him to it. All I know is that without challenge given, or\r\nthe least offer of warning, the creature bore down upon me, whirling his\r\nfists like flails.\r\n\r\n“You're the party I'm lookin' for!” was all he said.\r\n\r\nIn the mix-up to follow, and which I had neither time to consider\r\nnor avoid, the visitor from that other ward was fully and indubitably\r\nbeaten. This was so evident that he himself admitted it when at the\r\nfinish of hostilities certain Samaritans gave him strong drink as a\r\nrestorative. It developed also that my assailant, in a shadowy subdued\r\nway, was a kind of prizefighter, and by his own tribe deemed invincible.\r\nMy victory, therefore, made a noise in immediate circles; and I should\r\nsay it saved me from a deal of trouble and later strife, since it served\r\nto place me in a class above the common. There came few so drunk or\r\nso bold as to ask for trouble with me, and I found that this casual\r\nbattle--safe, too, because my prizefighter was too drunk to be\r\ndangerous--had brought me a wealth of peace.\r\n\r\nThere dawned a day when Big Kennedy gave me a decisive mark of his\r\nesteem. He presented me to his father. The elder Kennedy, white-haired\r\nand furrowed of age, was known as “Old Mike.” He was a personage of\r\ngravity and power, since his was the only voice in that region to which\r\nBig Kennedy would yield. Wherefore to be of “Old Mike's” acquaintance\r\nshone in one's favor like a title of knighthood.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy's presentation speech, when he led me before his father,\r\nwas characteristic and peculiar. Old Mike was in the shadow of his front\r\nporch, while three or four oldsters of the neighborhood, like a council\r\nor a little court about a monarch, and all smoking short clay pipes,\r\nwere sitting about him.\r\n\r\n“Here's a pup,” cried Big Kennedy, with his hand on my shoulder, “I want\r\nyou to look over. He's a great pup and ought to make a great dog.”\r\n\r\nOld Mike glanced at me out of his twinkling gray eyes. After a moment he\r\nsaid, addressing me:\r\n\r\n“Come ag'in.”\r\n\r\nThat was all I had from Old Mike that journey.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy it should be said was a model for all sons. He kept his\r\nfather in ease and comfort in a house of his own. He was prone to have\r\nOld Mike's advice, particularly if what he proposed were a step novel or\r\none dangerous in its policy, and he never went to anything in the face\r\nof Old Mike's word. It wasn't deference, it was faith; Big Kennedy\r\nbelieved in the wisdom of Old Mike and relied upon it with a confidence\r\nthat was implicit. I shall have more to tell of Old Mike as my story\r\nunrolls to the eye. If Big Kennedy were my example, Old Mike should be\r\ncalled my mentor. Taking the cue from Big Kennedy, I came to own for Old\r\nMike that veneration which the youths of Ancient Greece felt for their\r\noracles, and as utterly accepted either his argument or conclusion. It\r\nstood no wonder that I was impressed and played upon by this honor of an\r\nintroduction to Old Mike. To bring you before Old Mike and name you for\r\nhis consideration was the extremest proof of Big Kennedy's regard. As\r\nI've said, it glittered on one like the chain and spurs of knighthood,\r\nand the fact of it gave me a pedestal among my fellows.\r\n\r\nAfter my bout with that erring one who came out of his own ward to sup\r\ngrief at my hands, there began to collect about me a coterie of halfway\r\nbruisers. This circle--and our enemies were quick to bestow upon it the\r\nepithet of “gang”--never had formal organization. And while the members\r\nwere of the rougher sort, and each a man of his hands, the argument of\r\nits coming together was not so much aggression as protection.\r\n\r\nThe town forty years ago was not a theater of peace and lambs'-wool\r\nsafety. One's hand must keep one's head, and a stout arm, backed by\r\na stout heart, traveled far. To leave one's own ward, or even the\r\nneighborhood where one lived, was to invite attack. In an alien ward,\r\none would be set upon and beaten to rags before one traveled a mile.\r\nIf one of the enemy were not equal to the business, others would lend a\r\nhand. Whether it required one or two or three or twenty, the interloper\r\nwas fated to heir a drubbing. If his bones were not broken, he was\r\nlooked upon as fortunate, while those who had undertaken to correct his\r\nwanderings went despised as bunglers who had slighted a task.\r\n\r\nNow and then a war-party would make a sortie from their own region to\r\nbreak windows and heads in the country of an enemy. Such hands often\r\ndescended upon the domain of Big Kennedy, and it was a notion of defense\r\nagainst these Goths which brought the militant spirits I have mentioned\r\nto my shoulder. It was we who must meet them, when they would make\r\ndesolate our territory. The police were of no use; they either walked\r\nthe other way in a spirit of cautious neutrality, or were driven into\r\nhiding with a shower of stones.\r\n\r\nBy the common tongue, this coterie to collect at my back was named the\r\n“Tin Whistle Gang.” Each member carried a whistle as part of his pocket\r\nfurniture. These were made of uniform pattern, and the same keen note,\r\nlike the screech of a hawk, was common to all.\r\n\r\nThe screaming fife-like song would bring out the Tin Whistles as hotly\r\nbent for action as a colony of wasps. In those days, when might was\r\nright, the sound of these whistles was a storm signal. Quiet people shut\r\ntheir doors and drew their bolts, while apothecaries made ready to sell\r\nlint and plasters.\r\n\r\nIt is required that I speak of the Tin Whistles in this place. I was now\r\nfor the first time to be called into political activity by Big Kennedy.\r\nI was eighteen, and of a sober, steady, confident cast, and trustworthy\r\nin a wordless way. Because I was sober of face and one not given to talk\r\nor to laughter, men looked on me as five years better than my age; I\r\nthink these characteristics even imposed on Big Kennedy himself, for he\r\ndealt with me as though I were a man full grown.\r\n\r\nIt was in the height of a campaign. Two days before the balloting, Big\r\nKennedy sent for me. There was a room to the rear of his bar. This room\r\nwas a holy of holies; no one entered there who was not established in\r\nthe confidence of Big Kennedy. It was a greater distinction even than\r\nthe acquaintance of Old Mike. Knowing these things, my brow flushed when\r\nBig Kennedy led me into this sanctum of his policies.\r\n\r\n“Now, if I didn't trust you,” said Big Kennedy, looking me hard in the\r\neye, “if I didn't trust you, you'd be t'other side of that door.” I said\r\nnothing; I had found that silence pleased Big Kennedy, and I learned\r\nearly to keep my tongue between my teeth. Big Kennedy went on: “On\r\nelection day the polls will close at six o'clock. Half an hour before\r\nthey close, take that Bible Class of yours, the Tin Whistles, and drive\r\nevery one of the opposition workers an' ticket peddlers away from the\r\npolling place. You'll know them by their badges. I don't want anyone\r\nhurt mor'n you have to. The less blood, the better. Blood's news; it\r\ngets into the papers. Now remember: half an hour before six, blow your\r\nwhistle an' sail in. When you've got the other fellows on the run,\r\nkeep'em goin'. And don't let'em come back, d'ye see.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V--THE BATTLE OF THE BALLOTS\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG KENNEDY'S commands concerning the Tin Whistles taught me that\r\nlurking somewhere in the election situation he smelled peril to himself.\r\nCommonly, while his methods might be a wide shot to the left of the\r\nlawful, they were never violent. He must feel himself hard pressed to\r\ncall for fist and club. He lived at present cross-purposes with sundry\r\nhigh spirits of the general organization; perhaps a word was abroad for\r\nhis disaster and he had heard some sigh of it. This would be nothing\r\nwonderful; coarse as he seemed fibered, Big Kennedy had spun his web\r\nthroughout the ward as close-meshed as any spider, and any fluttering\r\nproof of treason was certain to be caught in it.\r\n\r\nThe election, while the office at local bay came to be no weightier than\r\nthat of Alderman, was of moment to Big Kennedy. Defeat would mean\r\nhis eclipse, and might even spell his death of politics. To lose the\r\nAlderman was to let fall the reins of ward direction. The Alderman and\r\nhis turtle-devouring fellows cracked the whip over the police whom they\r\nappointed or dismissed, and the police were a ballot-engine not to be\r\nresisted. He who held the Alderman, held the police; and he who had the\r\npolice, carried victory between his hands.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it was some inner-circle treachery which Big Kennedy\r\napprehended. The regular opposition, while numerous and carrying on\r\nits muster rolls the best respectability of the ward, lacked of that\r\norganization which was the ridgepole of Big Kennedy's supremacies.\r\nIt straggled, and was mob-like in its movements; and while, as I've\r\nwritten, it showed strong in numbers, it was no more to be collected or\r\nfashioned into any telling force for political effort than a flock of\r\ngrazing sheep. If there were to come nothing before him more formidable\r\nthan the regular opposition, Big Kennedy would go over it like a train\r\nof cars and ask no aid of shoulder-hitters. Such innocent ones might\r\nstand three deep about a ballot-box, and yet Big Kennedy would take from\r\nit what count of votes he chose and they be none the wiser. It would\r\ncome to no more than cheating a child at cards.\r\n\r\nThe open opposition to Big Kennedy was made up of divers misfit\r\nelements. At its head, as a sort of captain by courtesy, flourished\r\nthat reputable peppery old gentleman who aforetime took my part against\r\nSheeny Joe. A bit in love with his own eloquence, and eager for a forum\r\nwherein to exercise it, the reputable old gentleman had named himself\r\nfor Alderman against Big Kennedy's candidate. As a campaign scheme\r\nof vote-getting--for he believed he had but to be heard to convince\r\na listener--the reputable old gentleman engaged himself upon what he\r\ntermed a house-to-house canvass.\r\n\r\nIt was the evening of that day whereon Big Kennedy gave me those orders\r\ntouching the Tin Whistles when the reputable old gentleman paid a visit\r\nto Old Mike, that Nestor being as usual on his porch and comforting\r\nhimself with a pipe. I chanced to be present at the conversation,\r\nalthough I had no word therein; I was much at Old Mike's knee during\r\nthose callow days, having an appetite for his counsel.\r\n\r\n“Good-evening, sir,” said the reputable old gentleman, taking a chair\r\nwhich Old Mike's politeness provided, “good-evening, sir. My name\r\nis Morton--Mr. Morton of the Morton Bank. I live in Lafayette Place.\r\nIncidentally, I am a candidate for the office of Alderman, and I thought\r\nI'd take the freedom of a neighbor and a taxpayer and talk with you on\r\nthat topic of general interest.”\r\n\r\n“Why then,” returned Old Mike, with a cynical grin, “I'm th' daddy of\r\nBig Jawn Kennedy, an' for ye to talk to me would be loike throwin' away\r\nyour toime.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman was set aback by the news. Next he took\r\nheart of grace.\r\n\r\n“For,” he said, turning upon Old Alike a pleasant eye, although just a\r\ndash of the patronizing showed in the curve of his brow, “if I should be\r\nso fortunate as to explain to you your whole duty of politics, it might\r\ninfluence your son. Your son, I understand, listens greatly to your\r\nword.”\r\n\r\n“He would be a ba-ad son who didn't moind his own father,” returned Old\r\nMike. “As to me jooty av politics--it's th' same as every other man's.\r\nIt's the jooty av lookin' out for meself.”\r\n\r\nThis open-air selfishness as declared by Old Mike rather served to shock\r\nthe reputable old gentleman.\r\n\r\n“And in politics do you think first of yourself?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Not only first, but lasht,” replied Old Mike. “An' so do you; an' so\r\ndoes every man.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand the narrowness of your view,” retorted the\r\nreputable old gentleman, somewhat austere and distant. “You are a\r\nrespectable man; you call yourself a good citizen?”\r\n\r\n“Why,” responded Old Mike, for the other's remark concluded with a\r\nrising inflection like a question, “I get along with th' p'lice; an' I\r\nget along with th' priests--what more should a man say!”\r\n\r\n“Are you a taxpayer?”\r\n\r\n“I have th' house,” responded Old Mike, with a smile.\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman considered the other dubiously. Evidently he\r\ndidn't regard Old Mike's one-story cottage as all that might be desired\r\nin the way of credentials. Still he pushed on.\r\n\r\n“Have you given much attention to political economy?” This with an\r\nerudite cough. “Have you made politics a study?”\r\n\r\n“From me cradle,” returned Old Mike. “Every Irishman does. I knew so\r\nmuch about politics before I was twinty-one, th' British Government\r\nwould have transhported me av I'd stayed in Dublin.”\r\n\r\n“I should think,” said the reputable old gentleman, with a look of one\r\nwho had found something to stand on, “that if you ran from tyranny in\r\nIreland, you would refuse here to submit to the tyranny of Tammany Hall.\r\nIf you couldn't abide a Queen, how can you now put up with a Boss?”\r\n\r\n“I didn't run from th' Queen, I ran from th' laws,” said Old Mike. “As\r\nfor the Boss--everything that succeeds has a Boss. The President's a\r\nboss; the Pope's a boss; Stewart's a boss in his store down in City\r\nHall Park. That's right; everything that succeeds has a boss. Nothing is\r\nstrong enough to stand the mishtakes av more than one man. Ireland would\r\nhave been free th' long cinturies ago if she'd only had a boss.”\r\n\r\n“But do you call it good citizenship,” demanded the reputable old\r\ngentleman, not a trifle nettled by Old Mike's hard-shell philosophy of\r\nstate; “do you call it good citizenship to take your orders from a boss?\r\nYou are loyal to Tammany before you are loyal to the City?”\r\n\r\n“Shure!” returned Old Mike, puffing the puffs of him who is undisturbed.\r\n“Do ye ever pick up a hand in a game av ca-ards?” The reputable old\r\ngentleman seemed properly disgusted. “There you be then! City Government\r\nis but a game; so's all government, Shure, it's as if you an' me were\r\nplayin' a game av ca-ards, this politics; your party is your hand, an'\r\nTammany is my hand. In a game of ca-ards, which are ye loyal to, is it\r\nyour hand or the game? Man, it's your hand av coorse! By the same token!\r\nI am loyal to Tammany Hall.”\r\n\r\nThat closed the discussion; the reputable old gentleman went his way,\r\nand one might tell by his face that the question to assail him was\r\nwhether he had been in a verbal encounter with a Bedlamite or an\r\nAnarchist. He did not recognize me, nor was I sorry. I liked the\r\nreputable old gentleman because of that other day, and would not have\r\nhad him discover me in what he so plainly felt to be dangerous company.\r\n\r\n“He's a mighty ignorant man,” said Old Mike, pointing after the\r\nreputable old gentleman with the stem of his pipe. “What this country\r\nhas mosht to fear is th' ignorance av th' rich.”\r\n\r\nIt stood perhaps ten of the clock on the morning of election day when,\r\non word sent me, I waited on Big Kennedy in his barroom. When he had\r\ndrawn me into his sanctum at the rear, he, as was his custom, came\r\npointedly to the purpose.\r\n\r\n“There's a fight bein' made on me,” he said. “They've put out a lot of\r\nmoney on the quiet among my own people, an' think to sneak th' play on\r\nme.” While Big Kennedy talked, his eyes never left mine, and I could\r\nfeel he was searching me for any flickering sign that the enemy had been\r\ntampering with my fealty. I stared back at him like a statue. “An',”\r\n went on Big Kennedy, “not to put a feather-edge on it, I thought I'd run\r\nyou over, an' see if they'd been fixin' you. I guess you're all right;\r\nyou look on the level.” Then swinging abruptly to the business of the\r\nday; “Have you got your gang ready?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I nodded.\r\n\r\n“Remember my orders. Five-thirty is the time. Go for the blokes with\r\nbadges--th' ticket peddlers. An' mind! don't pound'em, chase'em. Unless\r\nthey stop to slug with you, don't put a hand on'em.”\r\n\r\nBeing thus re-instructed and about to depart, I made bold to ask Big\r\nKennedy if there were any danger of his man's defeat. He shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Not a glimmer,” he replied. “But we've got to keep movin'. They've put\r\nout stacks of money. They've settled it to help elect the opposition\r\ncandidate--this old gent, Morton. They don't care to win; they're only\r\nout to make me lose. If they could take the Alderman an' the police away\r\nfrom me, they would go in next trip an' kill me too dead to skin. But\r\nit's no go; they can't make th' dock. They've put in their money; but\r\nI'll show'em a trick that beats money to a standstill.”\r\n\r\nIt was as I had surmised; Big Kennedy feared treachery and the underhand\r\nsupport of the enemy by men whom he called his friends. For myself, I\r\nwould stand by him. Beg Kennedy was the only captain I knew.\r\n\r\nTo the commands of Big Kennedy, and their execution, I turned with\r\nas ready a heart as ever sent duck to drink. No impulse to disobey or\r\ndesert so much as crossed my slope of thought. Tammany Hall has ever\r\nbeen military in its spirit. Big Kennedy was my superior officer, I but\r\na subaltern; it was my province to accept his commands and carry them\r\nforward without argument or pause.\r\n\r\nIn full and proper season, I had my Tin Whistles in hand. I did not\r\nmarch them to the polling place in a body, since I was not one to\r\nobstreperously vaunt or flaunt an enterprise in advance. Also, I was too\r\nmuch the instinctive soldier to disclose either my force or my purpose,\r\nand I knew the value of surprise.\r\n\r\nThere were a round twenty of my Tin Whistles, each a shoulder-hitter\r\nand warm to shine in the graces of Big Kennedy. I might have recruited\r\na double strength, but there was no need. I had counted the foe; the\r\npoll-tenders of the opposition numbered but ten; my twenty, and each a\r\nberserk of his fists, ought to scatter them like a flock of sparrows. My\r\ninstructions given to my fellows were precisely Big Kennedy's orders as\r\ngiven to me; no blows, no blood unless made necessary by resistance.\r\n\r\nAs the time drew down for action, my Tin Whistles were scattered about,\r\nsticking close to the elbows of the enemy, and waiting the signal. The\r\npolling booth was a small frame construction, not much larger than a\r\nSaratoga trunk. On other occasions it served as the office of a wood and\r\ncoal concern. The table, with the ballot-box thereon, stood squarely\r\nin the door; behind it were the five or six officers--judges and tally\r\nclerks--of election. There was a crush and crowd of Big Kennedy's\r\nclansmen to entirely surround the little building, and they so choked\r\nup the path that ones who had still to vote couldn't push through. There\r\narose, too, a deal of shoving and jostling, and all to a running uproar\r\nof profanity; affairs appeared to be drifting towards the disorderly.\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman, his face red with indignation, was moving\r\nto and fro on the outskirts of the crowd, looking for a police officer.\r\nHe would have him cut a way through the press for those who still owned\r\nvotes. No officer was visible; the reputable old gentleman, even though\r\nhe searched with that zeal common of candidates anxious for success,\r\nwould have no aid from the constabulary.\r\n\r\n“And this is the protection,” cried the reputable old gentleman,\r\nstriding up to Big Kennedy, and shaking a wrathful finger in his face,\r\n“that citizens and taxpayers receive from the authorities! Here are\r\nscores of voters who are being blocked from the polls and robbed of\r\ntheir franchise. It's an outrage!”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy smiled upon the reputable old gentleman, but made no other\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n“It's an outrage!” repeated the reputable old gentleman in a towering\r\nfury. “Do you hear? It's an outrage on the taxpaying citizens of this\r\ntown!”\r\n\r\n“Look out, old man!” observed a young fellow who stood at Big Kennedy's\r\nside, and who from his blackened hands and greasy blue shirt seemed to\r\nbe the engineer of some tug. “Don't get too hot. You'll blow a cylinder\r\nhead.”\r\n\r\n“How dare you!” fumed the reputable old gentleman; “you, a mere boy by\r\ncomparison! how dare you address me in such terms! I'm old enough, sir,\r\nto be your father! You should understand, sir, that I've voted for a\r\npresident eight times in my life.”\r\n\r\n“That's nothin',” returned the other gayly; “I have voted for a\r\npresident eighty times before ten o'clock.”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the laugh that followed this piece of characteristic\r\nwit, Big Kennedy crossed to where I stood.\r\n\r\n“Send your boys along!” said he. “Let's see how good you are.”\r\n\r\nMy whistle screamed the signal. At the first sharp note, a cry went up:\r\n\r\n“The Tin Whistles! The Tin Whistles!”\r\n\r\nIt was done in a moment; a pair to a man, my Tin Whistles were sending\r\ntheir quarry down the streets as fast as feet might follow. And they\r\nobeyed directions; not a blow was struck, no blood was drawn; there was\r\na hustling flurry, and the others took to their heels. The hard repute\r\nof the Tin Whistles was such that no ten were wild enough to face them\r\nor meet their charge.\r\n\r\nAs the Tin Whistles fell upon their victims, the press of men that\r\nsurged about the polling place began to shout, and strain, and tug.\r\nSuddenly, the small building commenced to heave and lift suspiciously.\r\nIt was as though an earthquake were busy at its base. The mob about the\r\nstructure seemed to be rolling it over on its side. That would be\r\nno feat, with men enough to set hand upon it and carry it off like a\r\nparcel.\r\n\r\nWith the first heave there came shouts and oaths from those within.\r\nThen arose a crashing of glass, and the table was cast aside, as the\r\nthreatened clerks and judges fought to escape through door and window.\r\nIn the rush and scamper of it, a sharp hand seized the ballot-box.\r\n\r\nTen minutes the riot raged. It was calmed by Big Kennedy, who forced\r\nhimself into the middle of the tumult, hurling men right and left with\r\nhis powerful hands as though they were sacks of bran, while he commanded\r\nthe peace in a voice like the roar of a lion.\r\n\r\nPeace fell; the little building, which had not been overthrown, but only\r\nrocked and tipped, settled again to a decorous safe solidity; the judges\r\nand the clerks returned; the restored ballot-box again occupied the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nAs that active one, who had saved the ballot-box when the downfall of\r\nthe building seemed threatened came edgewise through the throng, he\r\npassed close to Big Kennedy. The latter gave him a sharp glance of\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n“I stuffed it full to the cover,” whispered the active one. “We win four\r\nto one, an' you can put down your money on that!”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy nodded, and the zealot who saved the ballot-box passed on\r\nand disappeared.\r\n\r\nWhen the Tin Whistles fell upon their prey, I started to go with them.\r\nBut in a moment I saw there was no call; the foe went off at top flight,\r\nand my twenty would keep them moving. Thus reasoning, I turned again to\r\nsee what was going forward about the booth.\r\n\r\nMy interest was immediately engaged by the words and actions of the\r\nreputable old gentleman, who, driven to frenzy, was denouncing. Big\r\nKennedy and all who wore his colors as scoundrels without measure or\r\nmate.\r\n\r\n“I defy both you and your plug-uglies,” he was shouting, flourishing his\r\nfist in the face of Big Kennedy, who, busy with his own plans, did not\r\nheed him. “This is a plot to stuff the ballot-box.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman had gone thus far, when a hulking creature\r\nof a rough struck him from behind with a sandbag. I sprang forward, and\r\nfended away a second blow with my left arm. As I did so, I struck the\r\nrough on the jaw with such vengeful force that, not only did he drop\r\nlike some pole-axed ox, but my right hand was fairly wrecked\r\nthereby. Without pausing to discover my own condition or that of the\r\nsandbag-wielding ruffian, I picked up the reputable old gentleman and\r\nbore him out of the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman had come by no serious harm; he was stunned\r\na trifle, and his hat broken. With me to hold him up, he could stand on\r\nhis feet, though still dazed and addled from the dull power of the blow.\r\nI beckoned a carriage which Big Kennedy had employed to bring the old\r\nand infirm to the polling place. It came at my signal, and I placed the\r\nreputable old gentleman inside, and told the driver to take him to his\r\nhome. The reputable old gentleman was murmuring and shaking his head\r\nas he drove away. As I closed the carriage door, he muttered: “This\r\nis barbarous! That citizens and taxpayers should receive such\r\ntreatment------” The balance was lost in the gride of the wheels.\r\n\r\nThe hurly-burly had now ceased; all was as calm and equal as a goose\r\npond.\r\n\r\n“So you saved the old gentleman,” said Big Kennedy, as he came towards\r\nme. “Gratitude, I s'pose, because he stood pal to you ag'inst Sheeny\r\nJoe that time. Gratitude! You'll get over that in time,” and Big Kennedy\r\nwore a pitying look as one who dwells upon another's weakness. “That was\r\nJimmy the Blacksmith you smashed. You'd better look out for him after\r\nthis.” My dander was still on end, and I intimated a readiness to look\r\nout for Jimmy the Blacksmith at once.\r\n\r\n“Mind your back now!” cautioned Big Kennedy, “and don't take to gettin'\r\nit up. Let things go as they lay. Never fight till you have to, d'ye\r\nsee! an' never fight for fun. Don't go lookin' for th' Blacksmith until\r\nyou hear he's out lookin' for you.” Then, as shifting the subject: “It's\r\nbeen a great day, an' everything to run off as smooth an' true as sayin'\r\nmass. Now let's go back and watch'em count the votes.”\r\n\r\n“Did we beat them?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Snowed'em under!” said Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI--THE RED JACKET ASSOCIATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG KENNEDY'S success at the election served to tighten the rivets of\r\nhis rule. It was now I looked to see him ferret forth and punish those\r\nrenegades who had wrought against him in the dark. To my amazement he\r\nengaged himself in no such retaliatory labor. On the contrary he smiled\r\non all about him like the sun at noon. Was it folly or want of heart\r\nthat tied his hands? Assuredly it was error, and this I submitted to Old\r\nMike. That veteran of policy disagreed with this, meanwhile beaming upon\r\nme in a way of fatherly cunning.\r\n\r\n“Jawn knows his business,” said Old Mike. “Thim people didn't rebel,\r\nthey sold out. That's over with an' gone by. Everybody'll sell ye out\r\nif he gets enough; that's a rishk ye have to take. There's that Limerick\r\nman, Gaffney, however; ye'll see something happen to Gaffney. He's one\r\nof thim patent-leather Micks an' puts on airs. He's schemin' to tur-rn\r\nJawn down an' take th' wa-ard. Ye'll see something happen to that\r\nLimerick man, Gaffney.”\r\n\r\nGaffney made his money with flour and horse feed and hay and similar\r\ngoods. Also, as Old Mike said, Gaffney was ambitious. It was within the\r\nweek, when a midnight shower of stones smashed sash and glass and laid\r\nwaste that offensive merchant's place of business. Gaffney restored his\r\nsash and glass only to invite a second midnight storm of stones. Three\r\ntimes were Gaffney's windows smashed by hands unknown; and no police\r\nofficer would go within two blocks of Gaffney's. In the end, Gaffney\r\ncame to Big Kennedy. The latter met him with a hectoring laugh.\r\n\r\n“Why do you come to me?” asked Big Kennedy. “Somebody's been trying to\r\nsmash the windows of my leadership for over a year, but I never went\r\nhowling about it to you.”\r\n\r\nGaffney showed not a little shaken. He asked, in a manner sullen yet\r\nbeaten, what he should do.\r\n\r\n“I'd get out of th' ward,” replied Big Kennedy as cool as ice.\r\n“Somebody's got it in for you. Now a man that'll throw a brick will\r\nlight a match, d'ye see, an' a feed store would burn like a tar barrel.”\r\n\r\n“If I could sell out, I'd quit,” said Gaffney.\r\n\r\n“Well,” responded Big Kennedy, “I always like to help a friend.”\r\n\r\nGrocer Fogel bought Gaffney's store, making a bargain.\r\n\r\nThis iron-bound lesson in practical politics I dwell on in full. I drew\r\nfrom it some notion of the stern character of that science. Old Mike,\r\nfrom the pinnacles of his hard experience, looked down to justify it.\r\n\r\n“Gaffney would do th' same,” said Old Mike, “if his ar-rm was long\r\nenough. Politics is a game where losers lose all; it's like war, shure,\r\nonly no one's kilt--at any rate, not so many.”\r\n\r\nAs the days drew on, I grew in favor with Big Kennedy, and the blossom\r\nthereof took this color.\r\n\r\n“Why don't you start a club?” he asked one afternoon, as we sat in his\r\nsanctum. “You could bring two hundred young fellows together, couldn't\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I replied. I spoke doubtfully; the suggestion was of the\r\nsharpest, and gave me no space to think. It was one, too, which asked\r\nquestions of the kind that don't answer themselves. “But where would\r\nthey meet?” I put this after a pause.\r\n\r\n“There's the big lodgeroom over my saloon,” and Big Kennedy tossed his\r\nstubby thumb towards the ceiling. “You could meet there. There's a dumb\r\nwaiter from the bar to send up beer and smokes.”\r\n\r\n“How about the Tin Whistles?” I hinted. “Would they do to build on?”\r\n\r\n“Leave the Tin Whistles out. They're all right as shoulder-hitters,\r\nan' a swifter gang to help at the polls, or break up the opposition's\r\nmeetin's, never walked the streets. But for a play of this kind, they're\r\na little off color. Your Tin Whistles can join, man by man, but if they\r\ndo they must sing low. They mustn't try to give the show; it's the\r\nback seat for them. What you're out for now is the respectable young\r\nworkin'-man racket; that's the lay.”\r\n\r\n“But where's the money?” said I. “These people I have in mind haven't\r\nmuch money.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” retorted Big Kennedy confidently, “an' what little they\r\nhave they want for beer. But listen: You get the room free. Then once\r\na year your club gives an excursion on the river; it ought to sell\r\nhundreds of tickets because there'll be hundreds of officeholders, an'\r\nbreweries, an' saloon keepers, an' that sort who'll be crazy to buy'em.\r\nIf they aint crazy to start with, you ought to be able to make'em crazy\r\nth' first election that comes 'round. The excursion should bring three\r\nthousand dollars over an' above expenses, d'ye see. Then you can give\r\nballs in the winter an' sell tickets. Then there's subscriptions an'\r\nhon'ry memberships. You'll ketch on; there's lots of ways to skin th'\r\ncat. You can keep th' club in clover an' have some of the long green\r\nleft. That's settled then; you organize a young men's club. You be\r\npresident an' treasurer; see to that. An' now,” here Big Kennedy took me\r\nby the shoulder and looked me instructively in the eye, “it's time for\r\nyou to be clinchin' onto some stuff for yourself. This club's goin' to\r\ntake a lot of your time. It'll make you do plenty of work. You're\r\nno treetoad; you can't live on air an' scenery.” Big Kennedy's look\r\ndeepened, and he shook me as one who demands attention. “You'll be\r\npresident and treasurer, particularly treasurer; and I'll chip you in\r\nthis piece of advice. A good cook always licks his fingers.” Here he\r\nwinked deeply.\r\n\r\nThis long speech was not thrown away. Big Kennedy, having delivered\r\nhimself, lapsed into silence, while I sat ruminating ways and means and\r\nwhat initiatory steps I should take.\r\n\r\n“What shall we call it?” I asked, as I arose to go.\r\n\r\n“Give it an Indian name,” said Big Kennedy. “S'p-pose you call it the\r\nRed Jacket Association.”\r\n\r\nWithin the fortnight the Red Jackets held their maiden meeting. It was\r\nan hour rife of jubilation, fellowship, and cheer. While abstinence from\r\ndrink was my guiding phrase, I made no point of that kind in the conduct\r\nof others, and a nearby brewery having contributed unlimited beer those\r\nwhom it pleased lacked no reason for a light heart.\r\n\r\nAs Big Kennedy had advised, I was chosen for the double responsibilities\r\nof president and treasurer. I may say in my own compliment, however,\r\nthat these honors came drifting to my feet. There were reasons for this\r\naside from any stiffness of heart or fist-virtues which might be mine.\r\nI have said that I was by disposition as taciturn as a tree, and this\r\nwondrous gift of silence earned me the name of wisdom, I was looked\r\nupon as one whose depth was rival to the ocean's. Stronger still, as\r\nthe argument by which I rose, was my sobriety. The man who drinks, and\r\nwhether it be little or much, never fails to save his great respect for\r\nhim who sets whisky aside.\r\n\r\n“An' now,” remarked Big Kennedy, when the club had found fortunate\r\nbirth, “with these Red Jackets to make the decent front, th' Tin\r\nWhistles to fall back on for the rough work, and Gaffney out of th' way,\r\nI call th' ward cleaned up. I'll tell you this, my son: after th' next\r\nelection you shall have an office, or there's no such man as Big John\r\nKennedy.” He smote the table with his heavy hand until the glasses\r\ndanced.\r\n\r\n“But I won't be of age,” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“What's the difference?” said Big Kennedy. “We'll play that you are,\r\nd'ye see. There'll be no one fool enough to talk about your age if I'm\r\nat your side. We'll make it a place in the dock department; that'll be\r\nabout your size. S'ppose we say a perch where there's twelve hundred\r\ndollars a year, an' nothin' to do but draw th' scads an' help your\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nJimmy the Blacksmith was an under-captain of Big Kennedy's and prevailed\r\nas vote-master in the northern end of the ward. Within certain fixed\r\nfrontiers, which ran on one side within a block of my home, it was the\r\nbusiness of Jimmy the Blacksmith to have watch and ward. He had charge\r\nof what meetings were held, and under the thumb of Big Kennedy carried\r\nforward the campaign, and on election day got out the vote.\r\n\r\nHaving given the question its share of thought, I determined for myself\r\non a forward, upward step. My determination--heart and soul--became\r\nagate-hard to drive Jimmy the Blacksmith from his place, and set up my\r\nown rule over that slender kingdom.\r\n\r\nNor would I say aught to Big Kennedy of this private war which I\r\nmeditated. Not that he would have interfered either to thwart or aid me,\r\nbut by the ethics of the situation, to give him such notice was neither\r\nproper nor expected. To fight Jimmy the Blacksmith for his crown was\r\nnot only right by every rule of ward justice, but it was the thing\r\nencouraged as a plan best likely to bring the strongest to the fore.\r\nTake what you may, keep what you can! was a Tammany statute; I would be\r\nright enough in that overthrow of Jimmy the Blacksmith, I was bent upon,\r\nif only I proved strong enough to bring it about. No, I was not to give\r\nword of my campaign to Big Kennedy, it was none of his affair, and he\r\nwould prefer to be ignorant since he was bound to stand neutral. It is\r\npolicy thus to let the younger cocks try beak and spur among themselves;\r\nit develops leadership, and is the one sure way of safety in picking out\r\nyour captains.\r\n\r\nThere was one drawback; I didn't live within the region of which I would\r\nmake prize. However, ambition edged my wits and I bethought me of a plan\r\nwhereby I might plow around that stump.\r\n\r\nIt was my own good fortune that I had no love, but only hate, for Jimmy\r\nthe Blacksmith. I was yet so softened of a want of years, that had we\r\nbeen friends I would have withheld myself from attacking him. Youth is\r\ngenerous, wherefore youth is weak. It is not until age has stopped these\r\nleaks in one's nature, and one ceases to give and only lives to take and\r\nkeep, that one's estate begins to take on fat. Have the word, therefore,\r\nof him whose scars speak for his experience: that one will be wise who\r\nregards generosity as a malady, a mere disease, and sets to cure it with\r\nevery sullen, cruel drug the case demands. I say it was my good luck to\r\nhate Jimmy the Blacksmith. He had never condoned that election-day blow,\r\nand I must confess there was reason for this hardness. His jaw had been\r\nbroken, and, though mended, it was still all of one side and made of him\r\na most forbidding spectacle. And he nursed a thought of revenge in his\r\nbreast; there came a light to his eye when we met that belongs with none\r\nsave him whose merest wish is murder. I would have had more than black\r\nlooks, but his heart was of a pale and treacherous family that can\r\nstrike no blow in front, and thus far the pathway of chance had not\r\nopened for him to come upon me unaware. For all of which, not alone my\r\nambition, but my safety and my pleasure urged me about the destruction\r\nof Jimmy the Blacksmith.\r\n\r\nThat epithet of the Blacksmith was born of no labors of the forge. Jimmy\r\nthe Blacksmith was no more a blacksmith than a bishop. If he ever did\r\na day's work, then the fact was already so far astern upon the tides\r\nof time that no eye of memory might discern it. The title was won in a\r\nbrawl wherein he slew a man. True to his nature, Jimmy slunk away\r\nfrom his adversary and would not face him. He returned, carrying a\r\nblacksmith's fore-hammer. Creeping behind the other, Jimmy suddenly\r\ncried, with an oath:\r\n\r\n“I'll clink your anvil for you!”\r\n\r\nWith that word, the hammer descended and the victim fell, skull crushed\r\nlike an eggshell. It required a deal of perjury to save the murderer\r\nfrom noose and trap. I should not say he was set backward by this\r\nbloodshed, since most men feared him for it and stepped out of his way,\r\ngiving him what he asked for in the name of their own safety. It was\r\nfor this work he was called the Blacksmith, and he carried the word as\r\nthough it were a decoration.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man on whose downfall I stood resolved and whose place I\r\nmeant to make my own. The thing was simple of performance too; all it\r\nasked were secrecy and a little wit. There was a Tammany club, one of\r\nregular sort and not like my Red Jacket Association, which was volunteer\r\nin its character. It met in that kingdom of the Blacksmith's as a little\r\nparliament of politics. This club was privileged each year to name for\r\nBig Kennedy's approval a man for that post of undercaptain. The annual\r\nselection was at hand. For four years the club had named Jimmy the\r\nBlacksmith; there came never the hint for believing he would not be\r\npitched upon again.\r\n\r\nNow be it known that scores of my Red Jackets were residents of the\r\ndistrict over which Jimmy the Blacksmith held sway. Some there were who\r\nalready belonged to his club. I gave those others word to join at once.\r\nAlso I told them, as they regarded their standing as Red Jackets, to be\r\npresent at that annual meeting.\r\n\r\nThe night arrived; the room was small and the attendance--except for my\r\nRed Jackets--being sparse, my people counted for three-quarters of those\r\npresent. With the earliest move I took possession of the meeting, and\r\nselected its chairman. Then, by resolution, I added the block in which\r\nI resided to the public domain of the club. That question of residence\r\nreplied to, instead of Jimmy the Blacksmith, I was named ballot-captain\r\nfor the year. It was no more complex as a transaction than counting ten.\r\nThe fact was accomplished like scratching a match; I had set the foot of\r\nmy climbing on Jimmy the Blacksmith's neck.\r\n\r\nThat unworthy was present; and to say he was made mad with the fury of\r\nit would be to write with snow the color of his feelings.\r\n\r\n“It's a steal!” he cried, springing to his feet. The little bandbox of\r\na hall rang with his roarings. Then, to me: “I'll fight you for it! You\r\ndon't dare meet me in the Peach Orchard to-morrow at three!”\r\n\r\n“Bring your sledge, Jimmy,” shouted some humorist; “you'll need it.”\r\n\r\nThe Peach Orchard might have been a peach orchard in the days of\r\nPeter Stuyvesant. All formal battles took place in the Peach Orchard.\r\nWherefore, and because the challenge for its propriety was not without\r\nprecedent, to the Peach Orchard at the hour named I repaired.\r\n\r\nJimmy the Blacksmith, however, came not. Someone brought the word\r\nthat he was sick; whereat those present, being fifty gentlemen with a\r\ncuriosity to look on carnage, and ones whose own robust health led them\r\nto regard the term “sickness” as a synonym for the preposterous, jeered\r\nthe name of Jimmy the Blacksmith from their hearts.\r\n\r\n“Jimmy the Cur! it ought to be,” growled one, whose disappointment over\r\na fight deferred was sore in the extreme.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you will argue that it smacked of the underhand to thus steal\r\nupon Jimmy the Blacksmith and take his place from him without due\r\nwarning given. I confess it would have been more like chivalry if I had\r\nsent him, so to say, a glove and told my intentions against him. Also\r\nit would have augmented labor and multiplied risk. The great thing is\r\nto win and win cheaply; a victory that costs more than it comes to is\r\nnothing but a mask for defeat.\r\n\r\n“You're down and out,” said Big Kennedy, when Jimmy the Blacksmith\r\nbrought his injuries to that chieftain. “Your reputation is gone too;\r\nyou were a fool to say 'Peach Orchard' when you lacked the nerve to make\r\nit good. You'll never hold up your head ag'in in th' ward, an' if I was\r\nyou I'd line out after Gaffney. This is a bad ward for a mongrel, Jimmy,\r\nan' I'd skin out.”\r\n\r\nJimmy the Blacksmith followed Gaffney and disappeared from the country\r\nof Big Kennedy. He was to occur again in my career, however, as he who\r\nreads on shall see, and under conditions which struck the color from\r\nmy cheek and set my heart to a trot with the terrors they loosed at its\r\nheels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII--HOW THE BOSS WAS NAMED FOR ALDERMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW it was that in secret my ambition took a hearty start and would\r\nvine-like creep and clamber. My triumph over Jimmy the Blacksmith added\r\nvastly to my stature of politics. Moreover, the sly intrigue by which I\r\nconquered began to found for me a fame. I had been locally illustrious,\r\nif I may so set the term to work, for a granite fist and a courage as\r\nrooted as a tree. For these traits the roughs revered me, and I may\r\nsay I found my uses and rewards. Following my conquest of that\r\nunder-captaincy, however, certain upper circles began to take account of\r\nme; circles which, if no purer than those others of ruder feather, were\r\nwont to produce more bulging profits in the pockets of their membership.\r\nIn brief, I came to be known for one capable and cunning of a plot, and\r\nwho was not without a genius for the executive.\r\n\r\nWith Big Kennedy I took high position. His relations with Jimmy\r\nthe Blacksmith never had been close; he had never unbuckled in any\r\nfriendship and felt for him nothing nearer than distrust. But for me\r\nhe held another pose. Big Kennedy, upon my elevation, fair made me his\r\npartner in the ward, a partnership wherein, to speak commercially, I\r\nmight be said to have had an interest of one-fourth. This promotion\r\nbrought me pleasure; and being only a boy when all was said, while I\r\nwent outwardly quiet, my spirit in the privacy of my own bosom would on\r\noccasion spread moderately its tail and strut.\r\n\r\nNow, as time passed, I became like the shadow of Big Kennedy's authority\r\nthroughout the ward; my voice was listened to and my word obeyed. I\r\nshould say, too, that I made it a first concern to carry the interest of\r\nBig Kennedy ever on the crest of my thought. This should be called the\r\noffspring neither of loyalty nor gratitude; I did it because it was\r\ndemanded of my safety and to curry advantage for myself. For all that\r\nattitude of confident friendship, I was not put off my guard. Big\r\nKennedy never let my conduct roam beyond his ken. A first sign of an\r\ninterest outside his own would have meant my instant disappearance. He\r\nwould have plucked me of my last plume. With a breath he could reduce me\r\nto be a beggarman where now I gave alms. Having, therefore, the measure\r\nof his fell abilities, I was not so blind as to draw their horns my way.\r\n\r\nStill, while I went tamely to heel at a word from Big Kennedy, I had\r\nalso resolved to advance. I meant before all was over to mount the\r\nlast summit of Tammany Hall. I laid out my life as architects lay out a\r\nbuilding; it would call for years, but I had years to give.\r\n\r\nMy work with Grocer Fogel had ended long ago. I now gave myself entirely\r\nto the party, and to deepen the foundations of its power. Inside our\r\nlines a mighty harmony prevailed. Big Kennedy and those headquarters\r\nenemies who once schemed for his defeat had healed their differences and\r\nthe surface of events showed as serene as summer seas. About this time\r\na great star was rising in the Tammany sky; a new chief was gaining\r\nevolution. Already, his name was first, and although he cloaked his\r\ndictatorship with prudence, the sophisticated knew how his will was even\r\nthen as law and through his convenient glove of velvet felt his grip of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I closely observed the unfolding of his genius. His methods\r\nas well as those of Big Kennedy were now my daily lesson. I had\r\never before me in that formative, plastic hour the examples of these\r\npast-masters of the art of domination.\r\n\r\nIt was well for me. A dictator is so much unlike a poet that he is made,\r\nnot born. He must build himself; and when completed he must save himself\r\nfrom being torn to pieces. No one blunders into a dictatorship; one\r\nmight as well look to blunder upon some mountain peak. Even blunders\r\nare amenable to natural law, and it can be taken as a truism that no one\r\nblunders up hill.\r\n\r\nWherefore, he who would be dictator and with his touch determine the day\r\nfor pushing, struggling, rebelling thousands and mold their times for\r\nthem, must study. And study hard I did.\r\n\r\nMy Red Jackets received my most jealous care. They deserved that much\r\nfrom me, since their existence offered measurably for my support. When\r\nthe day arrived, I was given that twelve-hundred-dollar place with the\r\ndocks, whereof Big Kennedy had spoken, and under his suggestion and to\r\nthe limits of my strength made what employ of it I might for my own and\r\nmy friends' behoof. But those twelve hundred dollars would not go far\r\nin the affairs of one who must for their franchises lead hither and yon\r\ndivers scores of folk, all of whom had but the one notion of politics,\r\nthat it was founded of free beer. There came, too, a procession of\r\nborrowers, and it was a dull day when, in sums from a dime to a dollar,\r\nI did not to these clients part with an aggregate that would have\r\nsupported any family for any decent week. There existed no door of\r\nescape; these charges, and others of similar kidney, must be met and\r\nborne; it was the only way to keep one's hold of politics; and so Old\r\nMike would tell me.\r\n\r\n“But it's better,” said that deep one, “to lind people money than give\r\nit to'em. You kape thim bechune your finger longer by lindin'.”\r\n\r\nIt was on the Red Jackets I leaned most for personal revenue. They were\r\nmy bread-winners. No Tammany organization, great or small, keeps books.\r\nNo man may say what is received, or what is disbursed, or name him who\r\ngave or got; and that is as it should be. If it were otherwise, one's\r\ntroubles would never earn an end. For the Red Jackets I was--to steal\r\na title from the general organization--not alone the treasurer, but the\r\nwiskinskie. In this latter rôle I collected the money that came in.\r\nThus the interests, financial, of the Red Jackets were wholly within\r\nmy hands, and recalling what Big Kennedy had said anent a good cook, I\r\nfailed not to lick my fingers.\r\n\r\nMoney was in no wise difficult to get. The Red Jackets were formidable\r\nboth for numbers and influence, and their favor or resentment meant\r\na round one thousand votes. Besides, there stood the memorable Tin\r\nWhistles, reckless, militant, ready for any midnight thing, and their\r\ndim outlines, like a challenge or a threat, filled up the cloudy\r\nbackground. Those with hopes or fears of office, and others who as\r\nmerchants or saloonkeepers, or who gambled, or did worse, to say naught\r\nof builders who found the streets and pavements a convenient even though\r\nan illegal resting place for their materials of bricks and lime and\r\nlumber, never failed of response to a suggestion that the good Red\r\nJackets stood in need of help. Every man of these contributing gentry,\r\nat their trades of dollar-getting, was violating law or ordinance, and\r\nI who had the police at my beck could instantly contract their liberties\r\nto a point that pinched. When such were the conditions, anyone with an\r\nimagination above a shoemaker's will see that to produce what funds\r\nmy wants demanded would be the lightest of tasks. It was like grinding\r\nsugar canes, and as easily sure of steady sweet returns.\r\n\r\nTrue, as an exception to a rule, one met now and again with him who for\r\nsome native bull-necked obstinacy would refuse a contribution. In such\r\nevent the secret of his frugality was certain to leak forth and spread\r\nitself among my followers. It would not be required that one offer even\r\na hint. Soon as ever the tale of that parsimony reached the ear of a Tin\r\nWhistle, disasters like a flock of buzzards collected about the saving\r\nman. His windows were darkly broken like Gaffney's. Or if he were a\r\ngrocer his wares would upset themselves about the pavements, his carts\r\nof delivery break down, his harnesses part and fall in pieces, and he\r\nbeset to dine off sorrow in many a different dish.\r\n\r\nAnd then and always there were the police to call his violative eye to\r\nthis ordinance, or hale him before a magistrate for that one. And there\r\nwere Health Boards, and Street Departments, who at a wink of Red Jacket\r\ndisfavor would descend upon a recalcitrant and provide burdens for his\r\nlife. With twenty methods of compulsion against him, and each according\r\nto law, there arose no man strong enough to refuse those duties of\r\ndonation. He must support the fortunes of my Red Jackets or see his\r\nown decline, and no one with a heart for commerce was long to learn the\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nThe great credit, however, in such coils was due the police. With them\r\nto be his allies, one might not only finance his policies, but control\r\nand count a vote; and no such name as failure.\r\n\r\n“They're the foot-stones of politics,” said Old Mike. “Kape th' p'lice,\r\nan' you kape yourself on top.”\r\n\r\nNor was this the task complex. It was but to threaten them with the\r\npowers above on the one hand, or on the other toss them individually\r\nan occasional small bone of profit to gnaw, and they would stand to you\r\nlike dogs. I soon had these ins and outs of money-getting at the tips\r\nof my tongue and my fingers, for I went to school to Big Kennedy and\r\nOld Mike in the accomplishment, and I may tell you it was a branch of\r\nlearning they were qualified to teach.\r\n\r\nBlackmail! cry you? Now there goes a word to that. These folk were\r\nviolating the law. What would you have?--their arrest? Let me inform you\r\nthat were the laws of the State and the town enforced to syllable and\r\nletter, it would drive into banishment one-half the population. They\r\nwould do business at a loss; it would put up the shutters for over half\r\nthe town. Wherefore, it would be against the common interest to arrest\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd still you would have the law enforced? And if it were, what, let me\r\nask, would be the immediate response? These delinquents would be fined.\r\nYou would then be satisfied. What should be the corrective difference\r\nbetween a fine paid to a court, and a donation paid to my Red Jackets?\r\nThe corrective influence in both should be the same, since in either\r\ninstance it is but a taking of dollars from the purses of the lawless.\r\nAnd yet, you clamor, “One is blackmail and the other is justice!” The\r\nseparation I should say was academic rather than practical; and as for a\r\nname: why then, I care nothing for a name.\r\n\r\nI will, however, go this farther journey for my own defense. I have not\r\nbeen for over twoscore years with Tammany and sixteen years its head,\r\nwithout being driven to some intimate knowledge of my times, and those\r\nprinciples of individual as well as communal action which underlie them\r\nto make a motive. And now I say, that I have yet to meet that man, or\r\nthat corporation, and though the latter were a church, who wouldn't\r\nfollow interest across a prostrate law, and in the chase of dollars\r\nbreak through ordinance and statute as a cow walks through a cobweb.\r\nAnd each and all they come most willingly to pay the prices of their\r\noutlawry, and receivers are as bad as thieves--your price-payer as black\r\nas your price-taker. Practically, the New York definition of an honest\r\nman has ever gone that he is one who denounces any robbery in the\r\nproceeds whereof he is not personally interested, and with that\r\ndefinition my life has never failed to comply. If Tammany and Tammany\r\nmen have been guilty of receiving money from violators of law, they had\r\namong their accomplices the town's most reputable names and influences.\r\nWhy then should you pursue the one while you excuse the other? And are\r\nyou not, when you do so, quite as much the criminal as either?\r\n\r\nWhen I was in the first year of my majority we went into a campaign\r\nfor the ownership of the town. Standing on the threshold of my earliest\r\nvote, I was strung like a bow to win. My fervor might have gained a more\r\nthan common heat, because by decision of Big Kennedy I, myself, was put\r\ndown to make the run for alderman. There was a world of money against\r\nus, since we had the respectable element, which means ever the rich, to\r\nbe our enemies.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy and I, after a session in his sanctum, resolved that not one\r\nmeeting should be held by our opponents within our boundaries. It was\r\nnot that we feared for the vote; rather it swung on a point of pride;\r\nand then it would hearten our tribesmen should we suppress the least\r\nsignal of the enemy's campaign.\r\n\r\nHaving limitless money, the foe decided for sundry gatherings. They also\r\noutlined processions, hired music by the band, and bought beer by the\r\nbarrel. They would have their speakers to address the commons in halls\r\nand from trucks.\r\n\r\nOn each attempt they were encountered and dispersed. More than once the\r\nRed Jackets, backed by the faithful Tin Whistles, took possession of a\r\nmeeting, put up their own orators and adopted their own resolutions.\r\nIf the police were called, they invariably arrested our enemies, being\r\nsapient of their own safety and equal to the work of locating the butter\r\non their personal bread. If the enemy through their henchmen or managers\r\nmade physical resistance, the Tin Whistles put them outside the hall,\r\nand whether through door or window came to be no mighty matter.\r\n\r\nAt times the Red Jackets and their reserves of Tin Whistles would\r\npermit the opposition to open a meeting. When the first orator had been\r\neloquent for perhaps five minutes, a phalanx of Tin Whistles would arise\r\nin their places, and a hailstorm of sponges, soaking wet and each\r\nthe size of one's head, would descend upon the rostrum. It was a\r\nnever-failing remedy; there lived never chairman nor orator who would\r\nface that fusillade. Sometimes the lights were turned out; and again,\r\nwhen it was an open-air meeting and the speakers to talk from a truck,\r\na bunch of crackers would be exploded under the horses and a runaway\r\noccur. That simple device was sure to cut the meeting short by carrying\r\noff the orators. The foe arranged but one procession; that was disposed\r\nof on the fringe of our territory by an unerring, even if improper,\r\nvolley of eggs and vegetables and similar trumpery. The artillery used\r\nwould have beaten back a charge by cavalry.\r\n\r\nStill the enemy had the money, and on that important point could\r\noverpower us like ten for one, and did. Here and there went their\r\nagents, sowing sly riches in the hope of a harvest of votes. To\r\ncounteract this still-hunt where the argument was cash, I sent the word\r\nabroad that our people were to take the money and promise votes. Then\r\nthey were to break the promise.\r\n\r\n“Bunco the foe!” was the watchword; “take their money and 'con' them!”\r\n\r\nThis instruction was deemed necessary for our safety. I educated our men\r\nto the thought that the more money they got by these methods, the higher\r\nthey would stand with Big Kennedy and me. If it were not for this,\r\nhundreds would have taken a price, and then, afraid to come back to\r\nus, might have gone with the banners of the enemy for that campaign at\r\nleast. Now they would get what they could, and wear it for a feather\r\nin their caps. They exulted in such enterprise; it was spoiling the\r\nEgyptian; having filled their pockets they would return and make a brag\r\nof the fact. By these schemes we kept our strength. The enemy parted\r\nwith money by the thousands, yet never the vote did they obtain. The\r\ngoods failed of delivery.\r\n\r\nSheeny Joe was a handy man to Big Kennedy. He owned no rank; but\r\nvoluble, active, well dressed, and ready with his money across a barroom\r\ncounter, he grew to have a value. Not once in those years which fell in\r\nbetween our encounter on the dock and this time I have in memory, did\r\nSheeny Joe express aught save friendship for me. His nose was queer\r\nof contour as the result of my handiwork, but he met the blemish in a\r\nspirit of philosophy and displayed no rancors against me as the author\r\nthereof. On the contrary, he was friendly to the verge of fulsome.\r\n\r\nSheeny Joe sold himself to the opposition, hoof and hide and horn. Nor\r\nwas this a mock disposal of himself, although he gave Big Kennedy and\r\nmyself to suppose he still held by us in his heart. No, it wasn't the\r\nmoney that changed him; rather I should say that for all his pretenses,\r\nhis hankerings of revenge against me had never slept. It was now he\r\nbelieved his day to compass it had come. The business was no more no\r\nless than a sheer bald plot to take my life, with Sheeny Joe to lie\r\nbehind it--the bug of evil under the dark chip.\r\n\r\nIt was in the early evening at my own home. Sheeny Joe came and called\r\nme to the door, and all in a hustle of hurry.\r\n\r\n“Big Kennedy wants you to come at once to the Tub of Blood,” said Sheeny\r\nJoe.\r\n\r\nThe Tub of Blood was a hang-out for certain bludgeon-wielding thugs who\r\nlived by the coarser crimes of burglary and highway robbery. It was\r\nsuspected by Big Kennedy and myself as a camping spot for “repeaters”\r\n whom the enemy had been at pains to import against us. We had it then in\r\nplan to set the Tin Whistles to the sacking of it three days before the\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nOn this word from Sheeny Joe, and thinking that some new programme was\r\nafoot, I set forth for the Tub of Blood. As I came through the door, a\r\nmurderous creature known as Strong-Arm Dan was busy polishing glasses\r\nbehind the bar. He looked up, and giving a nod toward a door in the\r\nrear, said:\r\n\r\n“They want you inside.”\r\n\r\nThe moment I set foot within that rear door, I saw how it was a trap.\r\nThere were a round dozen waiting, and each the flower of a desperate\r\nflock.\r\n\r\nIn the first surprise of it I did not speak, but instinctively got the\r\nwall to my back. As I faced them they moved uneasily, half rising from\r\ntheir chairs, growling, but speaking no word. Their purpose was to\r\nattack me; yet they hung upon the edge of the enterprise, apparently in\r\nwant of a leader. I was not a yard from the door, and having advantage\r\nof their slowness began making my way in that direction. They saw that\r\nI would escape, and yet they couldn't spur their courage to the leap.\r\nIt was my perilous repute as a hitter from the shoulder that stood my\r\nfriend that night.\r\n\r\nAt last I reached the door. Opening it with my hand behind me, my eyes\r\nstill on the glaring hesitating roughs, I stepped backward into the main\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“Good-night, gentlemen,” was all I said.\r\n\r\n“You'll set up the gin, won't you?” cried one, finding his voice.\r\n\r\n“Sure!” I returned, and I tossed Strong-Arm Dan a gold piece as I passed\r\nthe bar. “Give'em what they want while it lasts,” said I.\r\n\r\nThat demand for gin mashed into the teeth of my thoughts like the cogs\r\nof a wheel. It would hold that precious coterie for twenty minutes. When\r\nI got into the street, I caught the shadow of Sheeny Joe as he twisted\r\naround the corner.\r\n\r\nIt was a half-dozen blocks from the Tub of Blood that I blew the\r\ngathering call of the Tin Whistles. They came running like hounds to\r\nhuntsman. Ten minutes later the Tub of Blood lay a pile of ruins, while\r\nStrong-Arm Dan and those others, surprised in the midst of that guzzling\r\nI had paid for, with heads and faces a hash of wounds and blood and\r\nthe fear of death upon them, were running or staggering or crawling for\r\nshelter, according to what strength remained with them.\r\n\r\n“It's plain,” said Big Kennedy, when I told of the net that Sheeny Joe\r\nhad spread for me, “it's plain that you haven't shed your milk-teeth\r\nyet. However, you'll be older by an' by, an' then you won't follow off\r\nevery band of music that comes playin' down the street. No, I don't\r\nblame Sheeny Joe; politics is like draw-poker, an' everybody's got a\r\nright to fill his hand if he can. Still, while I don't blame him, it's\r\nup to us to get hunk an' even on th' play.” Here Big Kennedy pondered\r\nfor the space of a minute. Then he continued: “I think we'd better make\r\nit up-the-river--better railroad the duffer. Discipline's been gettin'\r\nslack of late, an' an example will work in hot an' handy. The next crook\r\nwon't pass us out the double-cross when he sees what comes off in th'\r\ncase of Sheeny Joe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII--THE FATE OF SHEENY JOE\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG KENNEDY'S suggestion of Sing Sing for Sheeny Joe did not fit with\r\nmy fancy. Not that a cropped head and a suit of stripes would have been\r\nmisplaced in the instance of Sheeny Joe, but I had my reputation to\r\nconsider. It would never do for a first bruiser of his day to fall back\r\non the law for protection. Such coward courses would shake my standing\r\nbeyond recovery. It would have disgraced the Tin Whistles; thereafter,\r\nin that vigorous brotherhood, my commands would have earned naught save\r\nlaughter. To arrest Sheeny Joe would be to fly in the face of the Tin\r\nWhistles and their dearest ethics. When to this I called Big Kennedy's\r\nattention, he laughed as one amused.\r\n\r\n“You don't twig!” said he, recovering a partial gravity. “I'm goin' to\r\nsend him over th' road for robbery.”\r\n\r\n“But he hasn't robbed anybody!”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy made a gesture of impatience, mixed with despair.\r\n\r\n“Here!” said he at last, “I'll give you a flash of what I'm out to do\r\nan' why I'm out to do it. I'm goin' to put Sheeny Joe away to stiffen\r\ndiscipline. He's sold himself, an' th' whole ward knows it. Now I'm\r\ngoin' to show'em what happens to a turncoat, as a hunch to keep their\r\ncoats on right side out, d'ye see.”\r\n\r\n“But you spoke of a robbery!” I interjected; “Sheeny Joe has robbed no\r\none.”\r\n\r\n“I'm gettin' to that,” returned Big Kennedy, with a repressive wave of\r\nhis broad palm, “an' I can see that you yourself have a lot to learn.\r\nListen: If I knew of any robbery Sheeny Joe had pulled off, I wouldn't\r\nhave him lagged for that; no, not if he'd taken a jimmy an' cracked\r\na dozen bins. There'd be no lesson in sendin' a duck over th' road\r\nin that. Any old woman could have him pinched for a crime he's really\r\npulled off. To leave an impression on these people, you must send a\r\nparty up for what he hasn't done. Then they understand.”\r\n\r\nFor all Big Kennedy's explanation, I still lived in the dark. I made no\r\nreturn, however, either of comment or question; I considered that I had\r\nonly to look on, and Big Kennedy's purpose would elucidate itself. Big\r\nKennedy and I were in the sanctum that opened off his barroom. He called\r\none of his barmen.\r\n\r\n“Billy, you know where to find the Rat?” Then, when the other nodded:\r\n“Go an' tell the Rat I want him.”\r\n\r\n“Who is the Rat?” I queried. I had never heard of the Rat.\r\n\r\n“He's a pickpocket,” responded Big Kennedy, “an' as fly a dip as ever\r\nnipped a watch or copped a leather.”\r\n\r\nThe Rat belonged on the west side of the town, which accounted for my\r\nhaving failed of his acquaintance. Big Kennedy was sure his man would\r\nfind him.\r\n\r\n“For he grafts nights,” said Big Kennedy, “an' at this time of day it's\r\na cinch he's takin' a snooze. A pickpocket has to have plenty of sleep\r\nto keep his hooks from shakin'.”\r\n\r\nWhile we were waiting the coming of the Rat, one of the barmen entered\r\nto announce a caller. He whispered a word in Big Kennedy's ear.\r\n\r\n“Sure!” said he. “Tell him to come along.”\r\n\r\nThe gentleman whom the barman had announced, and who was a young\r\nclergyman, came into the room. Big Kennedy gave him a hearty handshake,\r\nwhile his red face radiated a welcome.\r\n\r\n“What is it, Mr. Bronson?” asked Big Kennedy pleasantly; “what can I do\r\nfor you?”\r\n\r\nThe young clergyman's purpose was to ask assistance for a mission which\r\nhe proposed to start near the Five Points.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” said Big Kennedy, “an' not a moment to wait!” With that he\r\ngave the young clergyman one hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen that gentleman, after expressing his thanks, had departed, Big\r\nKennedy sighed.\r\n\r\n“I've got no great use for a church,” he said. “I never bought a gold\r\nbrick yet that wasn't wrapped in a tract. But it's no fun to get a\r\npreacher down on you. One of'em can throw stones enough to smash every\r\nwindow in Tammany Hall. Your only show with the preachers is to flatter\r\n'em;--pass'em out the flowers. Most of 'em's as pleased with flattery as\r\na girl. Yes indeed,” he concluded, “I can paste bills on 'em so long as\r\nI do it with soft soap.”\r\n\r\nThe Rat was a slight, quiet individual and looked the young physician\r\nrather than the pickpocket. His hands were delicate, and he wore gloves\r\nthe better to keep them in condition. His step and air were as quiet as\r\nthose of a cat.\r\n\r\n“I want a favor,” said Big Kennedy, addressing the Rat, “an' I've got\r\nto go to one of the swell mob to get it. That's why I sent for you, d'ye\r\nsee! It takes someone finer than a bricklayer to do th' work.”\r\n\r\nThe Rat was uneasily questioning my presence with his eye. Big Kennedy\r\npaused to reassure him.\r\n\r\n“He's th' straight goods,” said Big Kennedy, speaking in a tone wherein\r\nwere mingled resentment and reproach. “You don't s'ppose I'd steer you\r\nag'inst a brace?”\r\n\r\nThe Rat said never a word, but his glance left me and he gave entire\r\nheed to Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“This is the proposition,” resumed Big Kennedy. “You know Sheeny Joe.\r\nShadow him; swing and rattle with him no matter where he goes. The\r\nmoment you see a chance, get a pocketbook an' put it away in his\r\nclothes. When th' roar goes up, tell th' loser where to look. Are you\r\non? Sheeny Joe must get th' collar, an' I want him caught with th'\r\ngoods, d'ye see.”\r\n\r\n“I don't have to go to court ag'inst him?” said the Rat interrogatively.\r\n\r\n“No,” retorted Big Kennedy, a bit explosively. “You'd look about as well\r\nin th' witness box as I would in a pulpit. No, you shift th' leather.\r\nThen give th' party who's been touched th' office to go after Sheeny\r\nJoe. After that you can screw out; that's as far as you go.”\r\n\r\nIt was the next evening at the ferry. Suddenly a cry went up.\r\n\r\n“Thief! Thief! My pocketbook is gone!”\r\n\r\nThe shouts found source in a broad man. He was top-heavy with too much\r\nbeer, but clear enough to realize that his money had disappeared. The\r\nRat, sly, small, clean, inconspicuous, was at his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“There's your man!” whispered the Rat, pointing to Sheeny Joe, whose\r\nfootsteps he had been dogging the livelong day; “there's your man!”\r\n\r\nIn a moment the broad man had thrown himself upon Sheeny Joe.\r\n\r\n“Call the police!” he yelled. “He's got my pocket-book!”\r\n\r\nThe officer pulled him off Sheeny Joe, whom he had thrown to the ground\r\nand now clung to with the desperation of the robbed.\r\n\r\n“Give me a look in!” said the officer, thrusting the broad man aside.\r\n“If he's got your leather we'll find it.”\r\n\r\nSheeny Joe was breathless with the surprise and fury of the broad man's\r\ndescent upon him. The officer ran his hand over the outside of Sheeny\r\nJoe's coat, holding him meanwhile fast by the collar. Then he slipped\r\nhis hand inside, and drew forth a chubby pocketbook.\r\n\r\n“That's it!” screamed the broad man, “that's my wallet with over six\r\nhundred dollars in it! The fellow stole it!”\r\n\r\n“It's a plant!” gasped Sheeny Joe, his face like ashes. Then to the\r\ncrowd: “Will somebody go fetch Big John Kennedy? He knows me; he'll say\r\nI'm square!”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy arrived at the station as the officer, whose journey was\r\nslow because of the throng, came in with Sheeny Joe. Big Kennedy\r\nheard the stories of the officer and the broad man with all imaginable\r\npatience. Then a deep frown began to knot his brow. He waved Sheeny Joe\r\naside with a gesture that told of virtuous indignation.\r\n\r\n“Lock him up!” cried Big Kennedy. “If he'd slugged somebody, even if\r\nhe'd croaked him, I'd have stuck to him till th' pen'tentiary doors\r\npinched my fingers. But I've no use for a crook. Sing Sing's th' place\r\nfor him! It's just such fine workers as him who disgrace th' name of\r\nTammany Hall. They lift a leather, an' they make Tammany a cover for th'\r\nplay.”\r\n\r\n“Are you goin' back on me?” wailed Sheeny Joe.\r\n\r\n“Put him inside!” said Big Kennedy to the officer in charge of the\r\nstation. Then, to Sheeny Joe, with the flicker of a leer: “Why don't you\r\nsend to the Tub of Blood?”\r\n\r\n“Shall I take bail for him, Mr. Kennedy, if any shows up?” asked the\r\nofficer in charge.\r\n\r\n“No; no bail!” replied Big Kennedy. “If anyone offers, tell him I don't\r\nwant it done.”\r\n\r\nIt was three weeks later when Sheeny Joe was found guilty, and sentenced\r\nto prison for four years. The broad man, the police officer, and divers\r\nwho at the time of his arrest were looking on, come forward as witnesses\r\nagainst Sheeny Joe, and twelve honest dullards who called themselves a\r\njury, despite his protestations that he was “being jobbed,” instantly\r\ndeclared him guilty. Sheeny Joe, following his sentence, was dragged\r\nfrom the courtroom, crying and cursing the judge, the jury, the\r\nwitnesses, but most of all Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\nNor do I think Big Kennedy's agency in drawing down this fate upon\r\nSheeny Joe was misunderstood by ones with whom it was meant to pass\r\nfor warning. I argue this from what was overheard by me as we left the\r\ncourtroom where Sheeny Joe was sentenced. The two in conversation were\r\nwalking a pace in advance of me.\r\n\r\n“He got four spaces!” said one in an awed whisper.\r\n\r\n“He's dead lucky not to go for life!” exclaimed the other. “How much of\r\nthe double-cross do you guess now Big Kennedy will stand? I've seen a\r\nbloke take a slab in th' morgue for less. It was Benny the Bite; he gets\r\na knife between his slats.”\r\n\r\n“What's it all about, Jawn?” asked Old Mike, who later sat in private\r\nreview of the case of Sheeny Joe. “Why are you puttin' a four-year\r\nsmother on that laad?”\r\n\r\n“It's gettin' so,” explained Big Kennedy, “that these people of ours\r\nlook on politics as a kind of Virginny reel. It's first dance on one\r\nside an' then cross to th' other. There's a bundle of money ag'inst us,\r\nbig enough to trip a dog, an' discipline was givin' way. Our men could\r\nsmell th' burnin' money an' it made 'em crazy. Somethin' had to come off\r\nto sober 'em, an' teach 'em discipline, an' make 'em sing 'Home, Sweet\r\nHome'!”\r\n\r\n“It's all right, then!” declared Old Mike decisively.\r\n\r\n“The main thing is to kape up th' organization! Better twinty like that\r\nSheeny Joe should learn th' lockstep than weaken Tammany Hall. Besides,\r\nI'm not like th' law. I belave in sindin' folks to prison, not for what\r\nthey do, but for what they are. An' this la-ad was a har-rd crackther.”\r\n\r\nThe day upon which Sheeny Joe went to his prison was election day.\r\nTammany Hall took possession of the town; and for myself, I was made an\r\nalderman by a majority that counted into the skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX--HOW BIG KENNEDY BOLTED\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE I abandon the late election in its history to the keeping of time\r\npast, there is an episode, or, if you will, an accident, which should\r\nfind relation. Of itself it would have come and gone, and been of brief\r\nimportance, save for an incident to make one of its elements, which in\r\na later pinch to come of politics brought me within the shadow of a\r\ngibbet.\r\n\r\nBusy with my vote-getting, I had gone to the docks to confer with the\r\nhead of a certain gang of stevedores. These latter were hustling up and\r\ndown the gangplanks, taking the cargo out of a West India coffee boat.\r\nThe one I had come seeking was aboard the vessel.\r\n\r\nI pushed towards the after gangplank, and as I reached it I stepped\r\naside to avoid one coming ashore with a huge sack of coffee on his\r\nshoulders. Not having my eyes about me, I caught my toe in a ringbolt\r\nand stumbled with a mighty bump against a sailor who was standing on\r\nthe string-piece of the wharf. With nothing to save him, and a six-foot\r\nspace opening between the wharf and the ship, the man fell into the\r\nriver with a cry and a splash. He went to the bottom like so much\r\npig-iron, for he could not swim.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of a moment to throw off my coat and go after him. I was\r\nas much at ease in the water as a spaniel, and there would be nothing\r\nmore dangerous than a ducking in the experiment. I dived and came up\r\nwith the drowning man in my grip. For all his peril, he took it coolly\r\nenough, and beyond spluttering, and puffing, and cracking off a jargon\r\nof oaths, added no difficulties to the task of saving his life. We\r\ngained help from the dock, and it wasn't five minutes before we found\r\nthe safe planks beneath our feet again.\r\n\r\nThe man who had gone overboard so unexpectedly was a keen small dark\r\ncreature of a Sicilian, and to be noticed for his black eyes, a red\r\nhandkerchief over his head, and ears looped with golden earrings.\r\n\r\n“No harm done, I think?” said I, when we were both ashore again.\r\n\r\n“I lose-a my knife,” said he with a grin, the water dripping from his\r\nhair. He was pointing to the empty scabbard at his belt where he had\r\ncarried a sheath-knife.\r\n\r\n“It was my blunder,” said I, “and if you'll hunt me up at Big Kennedy's\r\nthis evening I'll have another for you.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, at a pawnshop in the Bowery, I bought a strange-looking\r\nweapon, that was more like a single-edged dagger than anything else. It\r\nhad a buck-horn haft, and was heavy and long, with a blade of full nine\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nMy Sicilian came, as I had told him, and I gave him the knife. He was\r\nextravagant in his gratitude.\r\n\r\n“You owe me nothing!” he cried. “It is I who owe for my life that you\r\nsave. But I shall take-a the knife to remember how you pull me out. You\r\ngood-a man; some day I pull you out--mebby so! who knows?”\r\n\r\nWith that he was off for the docks again, leaving me neither to hear nor\r\nto think of him thereafter for a stirring handful of years.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me as strange, even in a day when I gave less time to\r\nthought than I do now, that my first impulse as an alderman should be\r\none of revenge. There was that police captain, who, in the long ago,\r\noffered insult to Anne, when she came to beg for my liberty. “Better\r\nget back to your window,” said he, “or all the men will have left the\r\nstreet!” The memory of that evil gibe had never ceased to burn me with\r\nthe hot anger of a coal of fire, and now I resolved for his destruction.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Big Kennedy, he turned the idea on his wheel of thought for\r\nfull two minutes.\r\n\r\n“It's your right,” said he at last. “You've got the ax; you're entitled\r\nto his head. But say! pick him up on proper charges; get him dead to\r\nrights! That aint hard, d'ye see, for he's as crooked as a dog's hind\r\nleg. To throw him for some trick he's really turned will bunco these\r\nreform guys into thinkin' that we're on th' level.”\r\n\r\nThe enterprise offered no complexities. A man paid that captain money to\r\nsave from suppression a resort of flagrant immorality. The bribery\r\nwas laid bare; he was overtaken in this plain corruption; and next, my\r\ncombinations being perfect, I broke him as I might break a stick across\r\nmy knee. He came to me in private the following day.\r\n\r\n“What have I done?” said he. “Can I square it?”\r\n\r\n“Never!” I retorted; “there's some things one can't square.” Then I told\r\nhim of Anne, and his insult.\r\n\r\n“That's enough,” he replied, tossing his hand resignedly. “I can take my\r\nmedicine when it's come my turn.”\r\n\r\nFor all that captain's stoicism, despair rang in his tones, and as he\r\nleft me, the look in his eye was one to warm the cockles of my heart and\r\nfeed my soul with comfort.\r\n\r\n“Speakin' for myself,” said Big Kennedy, in the course of comment, “I\r\ndon't go much on revenge. Still when it costs nothin', I s'ppose\r\nyou might as well take it in. Besides, it shows folks that there's a\r\ndead-line in th' game. The wise ones will figger that this captain held\r\nout on us, or handed us th' worst of it on th' quiet. The example of him\r\ngettin' done up will make others run true.”\r\n\r\nSeveral years slipped by wherein as alderman I took my part in the\r\ntown's affairs. I was never a talking member, and gained no glory for my\r\neloquence. But what I lacked of rhetoric, I made up in stubborn loyalty\r\nto Tammany, and I never failed to dispose of my vote according to its\r\nmandates.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone my right, but my duty to do this. I had gone to the\r\npolls the avowed candidate of the machine. There was none to vote for\r\nme who did not know that my public courses would be shaped and guided by\r\nthe organization. I was free to assume, therefore, being thus elected as\r\na Tammany member by folk informed to a last expression of all that the\r\nphrase implied, that I was bound to carry out the Tammany programmes and\r\nexecute the Tammany orders. Where a machine and its laws are known, the\r\npeople when they lift to office one proposed of that machine, thereby\r\ndirect such officer to submit himself to its direction and conform to\r\nits demands.\r\n\r\nThere will be ones to deny this. And these gentry of denials will be\r\nplausible, and furnish the thought of an invincible purity for their\r\nassumptions. They should not, however, be too sure for their theories.\r\nThey themselves may be the ones in error. They should reflect\r\nthat wherever there dwells a Yes there lives also a No. These\r\ncontradictionists should emulate my own forbearance.\r\n\r\nI no more claim to be wholly right for my attitude of implicit obedience\r\nto the machine, than I condemn as wholly wrong their own position of\r\nboundless denunciation. There is no man so bad he may not be defended;\r\nthere lives none so good he does not need defense; and what I say of a\r\nman might with equal justice be said of any dogma of politics. As I set\r\nforth in my preface, the true and the false, the black and the white in\r\npolitics will rest ever with the point of view.\r\n\r\nDuring my years as an alderman I might have made myself a wealthy man.\r\nAnd that I did not do so, was not because I had no profit of the place.\r\nAs the partner, unnamed, in sundry city contracts, riches came often\r\nwithin my clutch. But I could not keep them; I was born with both hands\r\nopen and had the hold of money that a riddle has of water.\r\n\r\nThis want of a money wit is a defect of my nature. A great merchant late\r\nin my life once said to me:\r\n\r\n“Commerce--money-getting--is like a sea, and every man, in large or\r\nlittle sort, is a mariner. Some are buccaneers, while others are sober\r\nmerchantmen. One lives by taking prizes, the other by the proper gains\r\nof trade. You belong to the buccaneers by your birth. You are not a\r\nbusiness man, but a business wolf. Being a wolf, you will waste and\r\nnever save. Your instinct is to pull down each day's beef each day.\r\nYou should never buy nor sell nor seek to make money with money. Your\r\nknowledge of money is too narrow. Up to fifty dollars you are wise.\r\nBeyond that point you are the greatest dunce I ever met.”\r\n\r\nThus lectured the man of markets, measuring sticks, and scales; and\r\nwhile I do not think him altogether exact, there has been much in my\r\nstory to bear out what he said. It was not that I wasted my money in\r\nriot, or in vicious courses. My morals were good, and I had no vices.\r\nThis was not much to my credit; my morals were instinctive, like\r\nthe morals of an animal. My one passion was for politics, and my one\r\nambition the ambition to lead men. Nor was I eager to hold office; my\r\nhope went rather to a day when I should rule Tammany as its Chief. My\r\ngenius was not for the show ring; I cared nothing for a gilded place.\r\nThat dream of my heart's wish was to be the power behind the screen,\r\nand to put men up and take men down, place them and move them about, and\r\nplay at government as one might play at chess. Still, while I dreamed\r\nof an unbridled day to come, I was for that the more sedulous to execute\r\nthe orders of Big Kennedy. I had not then to learn that the art of\r\ncommand is best studied in the art of obedience.\r\n\r\nTo be entirely frank, I ought to name the one weakness that beset me,\r\nand which more than any spendthrift tendency lost me my fortune as fast\r\nas it flowed in. I came never to be a gambler in the card or gaming\r\ntable sense, but I was inveterate to wager money on a horse. While money\r\nlasted, I would bet on the issue of every race that was run, and I was\r\nmade frequently bankrupt thereby. However, I have said enough of my want\r\nof capacity to hoard. I was young and careless; moreover, with my place\r\nas alderman, and that sovereignty I still held among the Red Jackets,\r\nwhen my hand was empty I had but to stretch it forth to have it filled\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn my boyhood I went garbed of rags and patches. Now when money came,\r\nI sought the first tailor of the town. I went to him drawn of his high\r\nprices; for I argued, and I think sagaciously, that where one pays the\r\nmost one gets the best.\r\n\r\nNor, when I found that tailor, did I seek to direct him in his labors.\r\nI put myself in his hands, and was guided to quiet blacks and grays, and\r\nat his hint gave up thoughts of those plaids and glaring checks to which\r\nmy tastes went hungering. That tailor dressed me like a gentleman and\r\ndid me a deal of good. I am not one to say that raiment makes the man,\r\nand yet I hold that it has much to do with the man's behavior. I can say\r\nin my own case that when I was thus garbed like a gentleman, my conduct\r\nwas at once controlled in favor of the moderate. I was instantly ironed\r\nof those rougher wrinkles of my nature, which last, while neither noisy\r\nnor gratuitously violent, was never one of peace.\r\n\r\nThe important thing was that these clothes of gentility gave me\r\nmultiplied vogue with ones who were peculiarly my personal followers.\r\nThey earned me emphasis with my Red Jackets, who still bore me aloft as\r\ntheir leader, and whose favor I must not let drift. The Tin Whistles,\r\ntoo, drew an awe from this rich yet civil uniform which strengthened my\r\nauthority in that muscular quarter. I had grown, as an alderman and that\r\none next in ward power to Big Kennedy, to a place which exempted me\r\nfrom those harsher labors of fist and bludgeon in which, whenever the\r\nexigencies of a campaign demanded, the Tin Whistles were still employed.\r\nBut I claimed my old mastery over them. I would not permit so hardy\r\na force to go to another's hands, and while I no longer led their war\r\nparties, I was always in the background, giving them direction and\r\nstopping them when they went too far.\r\n\r\nIt was demanded of my safety that I retain my hold upon both the Tin\r\nWhistles and the Red Jackets. However eminent I might be, I was by no\r\nmeans out of the ruck, and my situation was to be sustained only by the\r\nstrong hand. The Tin Whistles and the Red Jackets were the sources of my\r\nimportance, and if my voice were heeded or my word owned weight it was\r\nbecause they stood ever ready to my call. Wherefore, I cultivated their\r\nfavor, secured my place among them, while at the same time I forced them\r\nto obey to the end that they as well as I be preserved.\r\n\r\nThose clothes of a gentleman not only augmented, but declared my\r\nstrength. In that time a fine coat was an offense to ones more coarsely\r\nclothed. A well-dressed stranger could not have walked three blocks on\r\nthe East Side without being driven to do battle for his life. Fine\r\nlinen was esteemed a challenge, and that I should be so arrayed and\r\ngo unscathed, proved not alone my popularity, but my dangerous repute.\r\nSecretly, it pleased my shoulder-hitters to see their captain so garbed;\r\nand since I could defend my feathers, they made of themselves another\r\nreason of leadership. I was growing adept of men, and I counted on this\r\neffect when I spent my money with that tailor.\r\n\r\nWhile I thus lay aside for the moment the running history of events\r\nthat were as the stepping stones by which I crossed from obscurity\r\nand poverty to power and wealth, to have a glance at myself in my more\r\npersonal attitudes, I should also relate my marriage and how I took a\r\nwife. It was Anne who had charge of the business, and brought me this\r\nsoft victory. Had it not been for Anne, I more than half believe I\r\nwould have had no wife at all; for I was eaten of an uneasy awkwardness\r\nwhenever my fate delivered me into the presence of a girl. However\r\nearnestly Anne might counsel, I had no more of parlor wisdom than a\r\nsavage, Anne, while sighing over my crudities and the hopeless thickness\r\nof my wits, established herself as a bearward to supervise my conduct.\r\nShe picked out my wife for me, and in days when I should have been\r\na lover, but was a graven image and as stolid, carried forward the\r\ncourting in my stead.\r\n\r\nIt was none other than Apple Cheek upon whom Anne pitched--Apple Cheek,\r\ngrown rounder and more fair, with locks like cornsilk, and eyes of\r\neven a deeper blue than on that day of the docks. Anne had struck out a\r\nfriendship for Apple Cheek from the beginning, and the two were much in\r\none another's company. And so one day, by ways and means I was too much\r\nconfused to understand, Anne had us before the priest. We were made\r\nhusband and wife; Apple Cheek brave and sweet, I looking like a fool in\r\nneed of keepers.\r\n\r\nAnne, the architect of this bliss, was in tears; and yet she must have\r\nkept her head, for I remember how she recalled me to the proprieties of\r\nmy new station.\r\n\r\n“Why don't you kiss your bride!” cried Anne, at the heel of the\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nAnne snapped out the words, and they rang in my delinquent ears like a\r\nstorm bell. Apple Cheek, eyes wet to be a match for Anne's, put up her\r\nlips with all the courage in the world. I kissed her, much as one\r\nmight salute a hot flatiron. Still I kissed her; and I think to the\r\nsatisfaction of a church-full looking on; but I knew what men condemned\r\nhave felt on that journey to block and ax.\r\n\r\nApple Cheek and her choice of me made up the sweetest fortune of my\r\nlife, and now when I think of her it is as if I stood in a flood of\r\nsunshine. So far as I was able, I housed her and robed her as though she\r\nwere the daughter of a king, and while I have met treason in others and\r\ndesertion where I looked for loyalty, I held her heart-fast, love-fast,\r\nfaith-fast, ever my own. She was my treasure, and when she died it was\r\nas though my own end had come.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy and the then Chief of Tammany, during my earlier years as\r\nalderman, were as Jonathan and David. They were ever together, and their\r\nplans and their interests ran side by side. At last they began to fall\r\napart. Big Kennedy saw a peril in this too-close a partnership, and was\r\nfor putting distance between them. It was Old Mike who thus counseled\r\nhim. The aged one became alarmed by the raw and insolent extravagance of\r\nthe Chief's methods.\r\n\r\n“Th' public,” said Old Mike, “is a sheep, while ye do no more than\r\njust rob it. But if ye insult it, it's a wolf. Now this man insults\r\nth' people. Better cut loose from him, Jawn; he'll get ye all tor-rn to\r\npieces.”\r\n\r\nThe split came when, by suggestion of Old Mike and\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy, I refused to give my vote as alderman to a railway company\r\nasking a terminal. There were millions of dollars in the balance, and\r\nwithout my vote the machine and the railway company were powerless. The\r\nstress was such that the mighty Chief himself came down to Big Kennedy's\r\nsaloon--a sight to make men stare!\r\n\r\nThe two, for a full hour, were locked in Big Kennedy's sanctum; when\r\nthey appeared I could read in the black anger that rode on the brow of\r\nthe Chief how Big Kennedy had declined his orders, and now stood ready\r\nto abide the worst. Big Kennedy, for his side, wore an air of confident\r\nserenity, and as I looked at the pair and compared them, one black, the\r\nother beaming, I was surprised into the conviction that Big Kennedy of\r\nthe two was the superior natural force. As the Chief reached the curb he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“You know the meaning of this. I shall tear you in two in the middle an'\r\nleave you on both sides of the street!”\r\n\r\n“If you do, I'll never squeal,” returned Big Kennedy carelessly. “But\r\nyou can't; I've got you counted. I can hold the ward ag'inst all you'll\r\nsend. An' you look out for yourself! I'll throw a switch on you yet\r\nthat'll send you to th' scrapheap.”\r\n\r\n“I s'ppose you think you know what you're doin'?” said the other\r\nangrily.\r\n\r\n“You can put a bet on it that I do,” retorted Big Kennedy. “I wasn't\r\nborn last week.”\r\n\r\nThat evening as we sat silent and thoughtful, Big Kennedy broke forth\r\nwith a word.\r\n\r\n“I've got it! You're on speakin' terms with that old duffer, Morton,\r\nwho's forever talkin' about bein' a taxpayer. He likes you, since you\r\nlaid out Jimmy the Blacksmith that time. See him, an' fill him up with\r\nth' notion that he ought to go to Congress. It won't be hard; he's sure\r\nhe ought to go somewhere, an' Congress will fit him to a finish. In two\r\ndays he'll think he's on his way to be a second Marcy. Tell him that if\r\nhis people will put him up, we'll join dogs with 'em an' pull down th'\r\nplace. You can say that we can't stand th' dishonesty an' corruption\r\nat th' head of Tammany Hall, an' are goin' to make a bolt for better\r\ngovernment. We'll send the old sport to Congress. He'll give us a bundle\r\nbig enough to fight the machine, an' plank dollar for dollar with it.\r\nAn' it'll put us in line for a hook-up with th' reform bunch in th'\r\nfight for th' town next year. It's the play to make; we're goin' to see\r\nstormy weather, you an' me, an' it's our turn to make for cover. We'll\r\nput up this old party, Morton, an' give th' machine a jolt. Th' Chief'll\r\nleave me on both sides of th' street, will he? I'll make him think,\r\nbefore he's through, that he's run ag'inst th' pole of a dray.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X--HOW JIMMY THE BLACKSMITH DIED\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG KENNEDY was right; the reputable old gentleman rose to that lure\r\nof Congress like any bass to any fly. It was over in a trice, those\r\npreliminaries; he was proud to be thus called upon to serve the people.\r\nIncidentally, it restored his hope in the country's future to hear that\r\nsuch tried war-dogs of politics as Big Kennedy and myself were making a\r\nline of battle against dishonesty in place. These and more were said\r\nto me by the reputable old gentleman when I bore him that word how Big\r\nKennedy and I were ready to be his allies. The reputable old gentleman\r\npuffed and glowed with the sheer glory of my proposal, and seemed\r\nalready to regard his election as a thing secured.\r\n\r\nIn due course, his own tribe placed him in nomina-ton. That done, Big\r\nKennedy called a meeting of his people and declared for the reputable\r\nold gentleman's support. Big Kennedy did not wait to be attacked by\r\nthe Tammany machine; he took the initiative and went to open rebellion,\r\ngiving as his reason the machine's corruption.\r\n\r\n“Tammany Hall has fallen into the hands of thieves!” shouted Big\r\nKennedy, in a short but pointed address which he made to his\r\nclansmen. “As an honest member of Tammany, I am fighting to rescue the\r\norganization.”\r\n\r\nIn its way, the move was a master-stroke. It gave us the high ground,\r\nsince it left us still in the party, still in Tammany Hall. It gave us a\r\nposition and a battle-cry, and sent us into the conflict with a cleaner\r\nfame than it had been our wont to wear.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, the reputable old gentleman paid a pompous visit to\r\nBig Kennedy. Like all who saw that leader, the reputable old gentleman\r\ncame to Big Kennedy's saloon. This last was a point upon which Big\r\nKennedy never failed to insist.\r\n\r\n“Th' man,” said Big Kennedy, “who's too good to go into a saloon, is too\r\ngood to go into politics; if he's goin' to dodge th' one, he'd better\r\nduck the' other.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman met this test of the barrooms, and qualified\r\nfor politics without a quaver. Had a barroom been the shelter of his\r\ninfancy, he could not have worn a steadier assurance. As he entered,\r\nhe laid a bill on the bar for the benefit of the public then and there\r\nathirst. Next he intimated a desire to talk privately with Big Kennedy,\r\nand set his course for the sanctum as though by inspiration. Big Kennedy\r\ncalled me to the confab; closing the door behind us, we drew together\r\nabout the table.\r\n\r\n“Let's cut out th' polite prelim'naries,” said Big Kennedy, “an' come\r\ndown to tacks. How much stuff do you feel like blowin' in?”\r\n\r\n“How much should it take?” asked the reputable old gentleman.\r\n\r\n“Say twenty thousand!” returned Big Kennedy, as cool as New Year's Day.\r\n\r\n“Twenty thousand dollars!” repeated the reputable old gentleman, with\r\nwide eyes. “Will it call for so much as that?”\r\n\r\n“If you're goin' to put in money, put in enough to win. There's no sense\r\nputtin' in just enough to lose. Th' other fellows will come into th'\r\ndistrict with money enough to burn a wet dog. We've got to break even\r\nwith 'em, or they'll have us faded from th' jump.”\r\n\r\n“But what can you do with so much?” asked the reputable old gentleman\r\ndismally. “It seems a fortune! What would you do with it?”\r\n\r\n“Mass meetin's, bands, beer, torches, fireworks, halls; but most of all,\r\nbuy votes.”\r\n\r\n“Buy votes!” exclaimed the reputable old gentleman, his cheek paling.\r\n\r\n“Buy 'em by th' bunch, like a market girl sells radishes!” Then, seeing\r\nthe reputable old gentleman's horror: “How do you s'ppose you're goin'\r\nto get votes? You don't think that these dock-wallopers an' river\r\npirates are stuck on you personally, do you?”\r\n\r\n“But their interest as citizens! I should think they'd look at that!”\r\n\r\n“Their first interest as citizens,” observed Big Kennedy, with a cynical\r\nsmile, “is a five-dollar bill.”\r\n\r\n“But do you think it right to purchase votes?” asked the reputable old\r\ngentleman, with a gasp.\r\n\r\n“Is it right to shoot a man? No. Is it right to shoot a man if he's\r\nshootin' at you? Yes. Well, these mugs are goin' to buy votes, an' keep\r\nat it early an' late. Which is why I say it's dead right to buy votes to\r\nsave yourself. Besides, you're th' best man; it's th' country's welfare\r\nwe're protectin', d'ye see!”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman remained for a moment in deep thought. Then\r\nhe got upon his feet to go.\r\n\r\n“I'll send my son to talk with you,” he said. Then faintly: “I guess\r\nthis will be all right.”\r\n\r\n“There's somethin' you've forgot,” said Big Kennedy with a chuckle,\r\nas he shook hands with the reputable old gentleman when the latter was\r\nabout to depart; “there's a bet you've overlooked.” Then, as the other\r\nseemed puzzled: “You aint got off your bluff about bein' a taxpayer.\r\nBut, I understand! This is exec'tive session, an' that crack about bein'\r\na taxpayer is more of a public utterance. You're keepin' it for th'\r\nstump, most likely.”\r\n\r\n“I'll send my son to you to-night,” repeated the reputable old\r\ngentleman, too much in the fog of Big Kennedy's generous figures to heed\r\nhis jests about taxpayers. “He'll be here about eight o'clock.”\r\n\r\n“That's right!” said Big Kennedy. “The sooner we get th' oil, th' sooner\r\nwe'll begin to light up.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman kept his word concerning his son and that\r\nyoung gentleman's advent. The latter was with us at eight, sharp, and\r\nbrought two others of hard appearance to bear him company as a kind of\r\nbodyguard. The young gentleman was slight and superfine, with eyeglass,\r\nmustache, and lisp. He accosted Big Kennedy, swinging a dainty cane the\r\nwhile in an affected way.\r\n\r\n“I'm Mr. Morton--Mr. James Morton,” he drawled. “You know my father.”\r\n\r\nOnce in the sanctum, and none save Big Kennedy and myself for company,\r\nyoung Morton came to the question.\r\n\r\n“My father's running for Congress. But he's old-fashioned; he doesn't\r\nunderstand these things.” The tones were confident and sophisticated. I\r\nbegan to see how the eyeglass, the cane, and the lisp belied our caller.\r\nUnder his affectations, he was as keen and cool a hand as Big Kennedy\r\nhimself. “No,” he repeated, taking meanwhile a thick envelope from his\r\nfrock-coat, “he doesn't understand. The idea of money shocks him, don't\r\ny' know.”\r\n\r\n“That's it!” returned Big Kennedy, sympathetically. “He's old-fashioned;\r\nhe thinks this thing is like runnin' to be superintendent of a Sunday\r\nschool. He aint down to date.”\r\n\r\n“Here,” observed our visitor, tapping the table with the envelope, and\r\nsmiling to find himself and Big Kennedy a unit as to the lamentable\r\ninnocence of his father, “here are twenty one-thousand-dollar bills.\r\nI didn't draw a check for reasons you appreciate. I shall trust you to\r\nmake the best use of this money. Also, I shall work with you through the\r\ncampaign.”\r\n\r\nWith that, the young gentleman went his way, humming a tune; and all as\r\nthough leaving twenty thousand dollars in the hands of some chance-sown\r\npolitician was the common employment of his evenings. When he was\r\ngone, Big Kennedy opened the envelope. There they were; twenty\r\none-thousand-dollar bills. Big Kennedy pointed to them as they lay on\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n“There's the reformer for you!” he said. “He'll go talkin' about Tammany\r\nHall; but once he himself goes out for an office, he's ready to buy a\r\nvote or burn a church! But say! that young Morton's all right!” Here Big\r\nKennedy's manner betrayed the most profound admiration. “He's as flossy\r\na proposition as ever came down th' pike.” Then his glance recurred\r\ndoubtfully to the treasure. “I wish he'd brought it 'round by daylight.\r\nI'll have to set up with this bundle till th' bank opens. Some fly guy\r\nmight cop a sneak on it else. There's a dozen of my best customers, any\r\nof whom would croak a man for one of them bills.”\r\n\r\nThe campaign went forward rough and tumble. Big Kennedy spent money\r\nlike water, the Red Jackets never slept, while the Tin Whistles met the\r\nplug-uglies of the enemy on twenty hard-fought fields.\r\n\r\nThe only move unusual, however, was one made by that energetic\r\nexquisite, young Morton. Young Morton, in the thick from the first, went\r\nshoulder to shoulder with Big Kennedy and myself. One day he asked us\r\nover to his personal headquarters.\r\n\r\n“You know,” said he, with his exasperating lisp, and daintily adjusting\r\nhis glasses, “how there's a lot of negroes to live over this way--quite\r\na settlement of them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Big Kennedy, “there's about three hundred votes among\r\n'em. I've never tried to cut in on 'em, because there's no gettin' a\r\nnigger to vote th' Tammany ticket.”\r\n\r\n“Three hundred votes, did you say?” lisped the youthful manager. “I\r\nshall get six hundred.” Then, to a black who was hovering about: “Call\r\nin those new recruits.”\r\n\r\nSix young blacks, each with a pleasant grin, marched into the room.\r\n\r\n“There,” said young Morton, inspecting them with the close air of a\r\ncritic, “they look like the real thing, don't they? Don't you think\r\nthey'll pass muster?”\r\n\r\n“An' why not?” said Big Kennedy. “I take it they're game to swear to\r\ntheir age, an' have got sense enough to give a house number that's in\r\nth' district?”\r\n\r\n“It's not that,” returned young Morton languidly. “But these fellows\r\naren't men, old chap, they're women, don't y' know! It's the clothes\r\ndoes it. I'm going to dress up the wenches in overalls and jumpers; it's\r\nmy own little idea.”\r\n\r\n“Say!” said Big Kennedy solemnly, as we were on our return; “that young\r\nMorton beats four kings an' an ace. He's a bird! I never felt so\r\nmuch like takin' off my hat to a man in my life. An' to think he's a\r\nRepublican!” Here Big Kennedy groaned over genius misplaced. “There's no\r\nuse talkin'; he ought to be in Tammany Hall.”\r\n\r\nThe district which was to determine the destinies of the reputable old\r\ngentleman included two city wards besides the one over which Big Kennedy\r\nheld sway. The campaign was not two weeks old before it stood patent to\r\na dullest eye that Big Kennedy, while crowded hard, would hold his place\r\nas leader in spite of the Tammany Chief and the best efforts he could\r\nput forth. When this was made apparent, while the strife went forward\r\nas fiercely as before, the Chief sent overtures to Big Kennedy. If that\r\nrebellionist would return to the fold of the machine, bygones would be\r\nbygones, and a feast of love and profit would be spread before him. Big\r\nKennedy, when the olive branch was proffered, sent word that he would\r\nmeet the Chief next day. He would be at a secret place he named.\r\n\r\n“An' tell him to come alone,” said Big Kennedy to the messenger. “That's\r\nth' way I'll come; an' if he goes to ringin' in two or three for this\r\npowwow, you can say to him in advance it's all off.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the going of the messenger, Big Kennedy fell into a brown\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n“Do you think you'll deal in again with the Chief and the machine?” I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“It depends on what's offered. A song an' dance won't get me.”\r\n\r\n“But how about the Mortons? Would you abandon them?”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy looked me over with an eye of pity. Then he placed his hand\r\non my head, as on that far-off day in court.\r\n\r\n“You're learnin' politics,” said Big Kennedy slowly, “an' you're showin'\r\nspeed. But let me tell you: You must chuck sentiment. Quit th' Mortons?\r\nI'll quit 'em in a holy minute if th' bid comes strong enough.”\r\n\r\n“Would you quit your friends?”\r\n\r\n“That's different,” he returned. “No man ought to quit his friends. But\r\nyou must be careful an' never have more'n two or three, d'ye see. Now\r\nthese Mortons aint friends, they're confed'rates. It's as though we\r\nhappened to be members of the same band of porch-climbers, that's all.\r\nTake it this way: How long do you guess it would take the Mortons to\r\nsell us out if it matched their little game? How long do you think we'd\r\nlast? Well, we'd last about as long as a drink of whisky.” Big Kennedy\r\nmet the Chief, and came back shaking his head in decisive negative.\r\n\r\n“There's nothin' in it,” he said; “he's all for playin' th' hog. It's\r\nthat railway company's deal. Your vote as Alderman, mind you, wins or\r\nloses it! What do you think now he offers to do? I know what he gets. He\r\ngets stock, say two hundred thousand dollars, an' one hundred thousand\r\ndollars in cold cash. An' yet he talks of only splittin' out fifteen\r\nthousand for you an' me! Enough said; we fight him!”\r\n\r\nJimmy the Blacksmith, when, in response to Big Kennedy's hint, he\r\n“followed Gaffney,” pitched his tent in the ward next north of our own.\r\nHe made himself useful to the leader of that region, and called together\r\na somber bevy which was known as the Alley Gang. With that care for\r\nhimself which had ever marked his conduct, Jimmy the Blacksmith, and\r\nhis Alley Gang, while they went to and fro as shoulder-hitters of\r\nthe machine, were zealous to avoid the Tin Whistles, and never put\r\nthemselves within their reach. On the one or two occasions when the Tin\r\nWhistles, lusting for collision, went hunting them, the astute Alleyites\r\nwere no more to be discovered than a needle in the hay.\r\n\r\n“You couldn't find 'em with a search warrant!” reported my disgusted\r\nlieutenant. “I never saw such people! They're a disgrace to th' East\r\nSide.”\r\n\r\nHowever, they were to be found with the last of it, and it would have\r\nbeen a happier fortune for me had the event fallen the other way.\r\n\r\nIt was the day of the balloting, and Big Kennedy and I had taken\r\nmeasures to render the result secure. Not only would we hold our ward,\r\nbut the district and the reputable old gentleman were safe. Throughout\r\nthe morning the word that came to us from time to time was ever a white\r\none. It was not until the afternoon that information arrived of sudden\r\nclouds to fill the sky. The news came in the guise of a note from young\r\nMorton:\r\n\r\n“Jimmy the Blacksmith and his heelers are driving our people from the\r\npolls.”\r\n\r\n“You know what to do!” said Big Kennedy, tossing me the scrap of paper.\r\n\r\nWith the Tin Whistles at my heels, I made my way to the scene of\r\ntrouble. It was full time; for a riot was on, and our men were winning\r\nthe worst of the fray. Clubs were going and stones were being thrown.\r\n\r\nIn the heart of it, I had a glimpse of Jimmy the Blacksmith, a slungshot\r\nto his wrist, smiting right and left, and cheering his cohorts. The\r\nsight gladdened me. There was my man, and I pushed through the crowd to\r\nreach him. This last was no stubborn matter, for the press parted before\r\nme like water.\r\n\r\nJimmy the Blacksmith saw me while yet I was a dozen feet from him. He\r\nunderstood that he could not escape, and with that he desperately faced\r\nme. As I drew within reach, he leveled a savage blow with the slungshot.\r\nIt would have put a period to my story if I had met it. The shot\r\nmiscarried, however, and the next moment I had rushed him and pinned him\r\nagainst the walls of the warehouse in which the precinct's polls were\r\nbeing held.\r\n\r\n“I've got you!” I cried, and then wrenched myself free to give me\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nI was to strike no blow, however; my purpose was to find an interruption\r\nin midswing. While the words were between my teeth, something like\r\na sunbeam came flickering by my head, and a long knife buried itself\r\nvengefully in Jimmy the Blacksmith's throat. There was a choking gurgle;\r\nthe man fell forward upon me while the red torrent from his mouth\r\ncovered my hands. Then he crumpled to the ground in a weltering heap;\r\ndead on the instant, too, for the point had pierced the spine. In a dumb\r\nchill of horror, I stooped and drew forth the knife. It was that weapon\r\nof the Bowery pawnshop which I had given the Sicilian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI--HOW THE BOSS STOOD AT BAY FOR HIS LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN I gave that knife to the Sicilian, I had not thought how on the\r\nnext occasion that I encountered it I should draw it from the throat of\r\na dead and fallen enemy. With the sight of it there arose a vision of\r\nthe dark brisk face, the red kerchief, and the golden earrings of him to\r\nwhom it had been presented. In a blurred way I swept the throng for his\r\ndiscovery. The Sicilian was not there; my gaze met only the faces of\r\nthe common crowd--ghastly, silent, questioning, staring, as I stood with\r\nknife dripping blood and the dead man on the ground at my feet. A police\r\nofficer was pushing slowly towards me, his face cloudy with apology.\r\n\r\n“You mustn't hold this ag'inst me,” said he, “but you can see yourself,\r\nI can't turn my blind side to a job like this. They'd have me pegged out\r\nan' spread-eagled in every paper of th' town.”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” I replied vaguely, not knowing what I said. “An' there's th' big\r\nTammany Chief you're fightin',” went on the officer; “he'd just about\r\nhave my scalp, sure. I don't see why you did it! Your heart must be\r\nturnin' weak, when you take to carryin' a shave, an' stickin' people\r\nlike pigs!”\r\n\r\n“You don't think I killed him!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Who else?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe officer shrugged his shoulders and turned his hands palm upwards\r\nwith a gesture of deprecation. To the question and the gesture I made\r\nno answer. It came to me that I must give my Sicilian time to escape. I\r\ncould have wished his friendship had taken a less tropical form; still\r\nhe had thrown that knife for me, and I would not name him until he had\r\nfound his ship and was safe beyond the fingers of the law. Even now I\r\nthink my course a proper one. The man innocent has ever that innocence\r\nto be his shield; he should be ready to suffer a little in favor of ones\r\nwho own no such strong advantage.\r\n\r\nIt was nine of that evening's clock before Big Kennedy visited me in the\r\nTombs. Young Morton came with him, clothed of evening dress and wearing\r\nwhite gloves. He twisted his mustache between his kid-gloved finger and\r\nthumb, meanwhile surveying the grimy interior--a fretwork of steel bars\r\nand freestone--with looks of ineffable objection. The warden was with\r\nthem in his own high person when they came to my cell. That functionary\r\nwas in a mood of sullen uncertainty; he could not make out a zone of\r\nsafety for himself, when now Big Kennedy and the Tammany Chief were at\r\ndaggers drawn. He feared he might go too far in pleasuring the former,\r\nand so bring upon him the dangerous resentment of his rival.\r\n\r\n“We can't talk here, Dave,” said Big Kennedy, addressing the warden,\r\nafter greeting me through the cell grate. “Bring him to your private\r\noffice.”\r\n\r\n“But, Mr. Kennedy,” remonstrated the warden, “I don't know about that.\r\nIt's after lockin'-up hours now.”\r\n\r\n“You don't know!” repeated Big Kennedy, the specter of a threat peeping\r\nfrom his gray eyes. “An' you're to hand me out a line of guff about\r\nlockin'-up hours, too! Come, come, Dave; it won't do to get chesty! The\r\nChief an' I may be pals to-morrow. Or I may have him done for an' on\r\nth' run in a month. Where would you be then, Dave? No more words, I say:\r\nbring him to your private office.”\r\n\r\nThere was no gainsaying the masterful manner of Big Kennedy. The warden,\r\nweakened with years of fear of him and his power, grumblingly undid the\r\nbolts and led the way to his room.\r\n\r\n“Deuced wretched quarters, I should say!” murmured young Morton,\r\nglancing for a moment inside the cell. “Not at all worth cutting a\r\nthroat for.”\r\n\r\nWhen we were in the warden's room, that master of the keys took up a\r\nposition by the door. This was not to Big Kennedy's taste.\r\n\r\n“Dave, s'ppose you step outside,” said Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“It's no use you hearin' what we say; it might get you into trouble,\r\nd'ye see!” The last, insinuatingly.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Kennedy, I'm afraid!” replied the warden, with the voice of one\r\nworried. “You know the charge is murder. He's here for killin' Jimmy the\r\nBlacksmith. I've no right to let him out of my sight.”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, I know it's murder,” responded Big Kennedy. “I'd be\r\nplankin' down bail for him if it was anything else. But what's that got\r\nto do with you skip-pin' into th' hall? You don't think I'm goin' to\r\npass him any files or saws, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Really, Mr. Warden,” said young Morton, crossing over to where the\r\nwarden lingered irresolutely, “really, you don't expect to stay and\r\noverhear our conversation! Why, it would be not only impolite, but\r\nperposterous! Besides, it's not my way, don't y' know!” And here young\r\nMorton put on his double eyeglass and ran the warden up and down with an\r\nintolerant stare.\r\n\r\n“But he's charged, I tell you,” objected the warden, “with killin' Jimmy\r\nth' Blacksmith. I can't go to givin' him privileges an' takin' chances;\r\nI'd get done up if I did.”\r\n\r\n“You'll get done up if you don't!” growled Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“It is as you say,” went on young Morton, still holding the warden\r\nin the thrall of that wonderful eyeglass, “it is quite true that this\r\nperson, James the Horseshoer as you call him, has been slain and will\r\nnever shoe a horse again. But our friend had no hand in it, as we stand\r\nready to spend one hundred thousand dollars to establish. And by\r\nthe way, speaking of money,”--here young Morton turned to Big\r\nKennedy--“didn't you say as we came along that it would be proper to\r\nremunerate this officer for our encroachments upon his time?”\r\n\r\n“Why, yes,” replied Big Kennedy, with an ugly glare at the warden, “I\r\nsaid that it might be a good idea to sweeten him.”\r\n\r\n“Sweeten! Ah, yes; I recall now that sweeten was the term you employed.\r\nA most extraordinary word for paying money. However,” and here young\r\nMorton again addressed the warden, tendering him at the same time a\r\none-hundred-dollar bill, “here is a small present. Now let us have no\r\nmore words, my good man.”\r\n\r\nThe warden, softened by the bill, went out and closed the door. I could\r\nsee that he looked on young Morton in wonder and smelled upon him a\r\nmysterious authority. As one disposed to cement a friendship just begun,\r\nthe warden, as he left, held out his hand to young Morton.\r\n\r\n“You're th' proper caper!” he exclaimed, in a gush of encomium; “you're\r\na gent of th' right real sort!” Young Morton gazed upon the warden's\r\noutstretched hand as though it were one of the curious things of nature.\r\nAt. last he extended two fingers, which the warden grasped.\r\n\r\n“This weakness for shaking hands,” said young Morton, dusting his gloved\r\nfingers fastidiously, “this weakness for shaking hands on the part of\r\nthese common people is inexcusable. Still, on the whole, I did not think\r\nit a best occasion for administering a rebuke, don't y' know, and so\r\nallowed that low fellow his way.”\r\n\r\n“Dave's all right,” returned Big Kennedy. Then coming around to me: “Now\r\nlet's get down to business. You understand how the charge is murder, an'\r\nthat no bail goes. But keep a stiff upper lip. The Chief is out to put\r\na crimp in you, but we'll beat him just th' same. For every witness he\r\nbrings, we'll bring two. Do you know who it was croaked th' Blacksmith?”\r\n\r\nI told him of the Sicilian; and how I had recognized the knife as I drew\r\nit from the throat of the dead man.\r\n\r\n“It's a cinch he threw it,” said Big Kennedy; “he was in the crowd an'\r\nsaw you mixin' it up with th' Blacksmith, an' let him have it. Them\r\nDagoes are great knife throwers. Did you get a flash of him in the\r\ncrowd?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, “there was no sign of him. I haven't told this story to\r\nanybody. We ought to give him time to take care of himself.”\r\n\r\n“Right you are,” said Big Kennedy approvingly. “He probably jumped\r\naboard his boat; it's even money he's outside the Hook, out'ard bound,\r\nby now.”\r\n\r\nThen Big Kennedy discussed the case. I would be indicted and tried;\r\nthere was no doubt of that. The Chief, our enemy, had possession of the\r\ncourt machinery; so far as indictment and trial were concerned he would\r\nnot fail of his will.\r\n\r\n“An' it's th' judge in partic'lar, I'm leary of,” said Big Kennedy\r\nthoughtfully. “The Chief has got that jurist in hock to him, d'ye\r\nsee! But there's another end to it; I've got a pull with the party who\r\nselects the jury, an' it'll be funny if we don't have half of 'em our\r\nway. That's right; th' worst they can hand us is a hung jury. If it\r\ntakes money, now,” and here Big Kennedy rolled a tentative eye on young\r\nMorton, “if it should take money, I s'ppose we know where to look for\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nYoung Morton had been listening to every word, and for the moment,\r\nnothing about him of his usual languor. Beyond tapping his white\r\nteeth with the handle of his dress cane, he retained no trace of those\r\naffectations. I had much hope from the alert earnestness of young\r\nMorton, for I could tell that he would stay by my fortunes to the end.\r\n\r\n“What was that?” he asked, when Big Kennedy spoke of money.\r\n\r\n“I said that if we have to buy any little thing like a juror or a\r\nwitness, we know where to go for the money.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly!” he lisped, relapsing into the exquisite; “we shall buy the\r\ncourthouse should the purchase of that edifice become necessary to our\r\nfriend's security.”\r\n\r\n“Aint he a dandy!” exclaimed Big Kennedy, surveying young Morton in a\r\nrapt way. Then coming back to me: “I've got some news for you that\r\nyou want to keep under your waistcoat. You know Billy Cassidy--Foxy\r\nBilly--him that studied to be a priest? You remember how I got him a\r\npost in th' Comptroller's office. Well, I sent for him not an hour ago;\r\nhe's goin' to take copies of th' accounts that show what th' Chief an'\r\nthem other highbinders at the top o' Tammany have been doin'. I'll have\r\nthe papers on 'em in less'n a week. If we get our hooks on what I'm\r\nafter, an' Foxy Billy says we shall, we'll wipe that gang off th'\r\nearth.”\r\n\r\n“Given those documents, we shall, as you say, obliterate them,” chimed\r\nin young Morton. “But speaking of your agent: Is this Foxy Billy as\r\nastute as his name would imply?”\r\n\r\n“He could go down to Coney Island an' beat th' shells,” said Big Kennedy\r\nconfidently.\r\n\r\n“About the knife which gave James the Horseshoer his death wound,” said\r\nyoung Morton. His tones were vapid, but his glance was bright enough.\r\n“They've sent it to the Central Office. The detectives are sure\r\nto discover the pawnbroker who sold it. I think it would be wise,\r\ntherefore, to carry the detectives the word ourselves. It will draw the\r\nsting out of that wasp; it would, really. It wouldn't look well to a\r\njury, should we let them track down-this information, while it will\r\ndestroy its effect if we ourselves tell them. I think with the start he\r\nhas, we can trust that Sicilian individual to take care of himself.”\r\n\r\nThis suggestion appealed to Big Kennedy as good. He thought, too, that\r\nhe and young Morton might better set about the matter without delay.\r\n\r\n“Don't lose your nerve,” said he, shaking me by the hand. “You are as\r\nsafe as though you were in church. I'll crowd 'em, too, an' get this\r\ntrial over inside of six weeks. By that time, if Foxy Billy is any good,\r\nwe'll be ready to give the Chief some law business of his own.”\r\n\r\n“One thing,” I said at parting; “my wife must not come here. I wouldn't\r\nhave her see me in a cell to save my life.”\r\n\r\nFrom the moment of my arrival at the Tombs, I had not ceased to think of\r\nApple Cheek and her distress. Anne would do her best to comfort her; and\r\nfor the rest--why! it must be borne. But I could not abide her seeing me\r\na prisoner; not for her sake, but for my own.\r\n\r\n“Well, good-by!” said young Morton, as he and Big Kennedy were taking\r\nthemselves away. “You need give yourself no uneasiness. Remember, you\r\nare not only right, but rich; and when, pray, was the right, on being\r\nbacked by riches, ever beaten down?”\r\n\r\n“Or for that matter, the wrong either?” put in Big Kennedy sagely. “I've\r\nnever seen money lose a fight.”\r\n\r\n“Our friend,” said young Morton, addressing the warden, who had now\r\nreturned, and speaking in a high superior vein, “is to have everything\r\nhe wants. Here is my card. Remember, now, this gentleman is my friend;\r\nand it is not to my fancy, don't y' know, that a friend of mine should\r\nlack for anything; it isn't, really!”\r\n\r\nAs Big Kennedy and young Morton reached the door, I bethought me for the\r\nfirst time to ask the result of the election.\r\n\r\n“Was your father successful?” I queried. “These other matters quite\r\ndrove the election from my head.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” drawled young Morton, “my father triumphed. I forget the\r\nphrase in which Mr. Kennedy described the method of his success, but\r\nit was highly epigrammatic and appropriate. How was it you said the old\r\ngentleman won?”\r\n\r\n“I said that he won in a walk,” returned Big Kennedy. Then,\r\nsuspiciously: “Say you aint guying me, be you?”\r\n\r\n“Me guy you?” repeated young Morton, elevating his brows. “I'd as soon\r\nthink of deriding a king with crown and scepter!”\r\n\r\nMy trial came on within a month. Big Kennedy had a genius for\r\nexpedition, and could hurry both men and events whenever it suited his\r\ninclinations. When I went to the bar I was accompanied by two of the\r\nleaders of the local guild of lawyers. These were my counsel, and they\r\nwould leave no stone unturned to see me free. Big Kennedy sat by my side\r\nwhen the jury was empaneled.\r\n\r\n“We've got eight of 'em painted,” he whispered. “I'd have had all\r\ntwelve,” he continued regretfully, “but what with the challengin', an'\r\nwhat with some of 'em not knowin' enough, an' some of 'em knowin' too\r\nmuch, I lose four. However, eight ought to land us on our feet.”\r\n\r\nThere were no Irishmen in the panel, and I commented on the fact as\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\n“No, I barred th' Irish,” said Big Kennedy. “Th' Irish are all right;\r\nI'm second-crop Irish--bein' born in this country--myself. But you don't\r\nnever want one on a jury, especially on a charge of murder. There's this\r\nthing about a Mick: he'll cry an' sympathize with you an' shake your\r\nhand, an' send you flowers; but just th' same he always wants you\r\nhanged.”\r\n\r\nAs Big Kennedy had apprehended, the Judge on the bench was set hard and\r\nchill as Arctic ice against me; I could read it in his jadestone eye.\r\nHe would do his utmost to put a halter about my neck, and the look\r\nhe bestowed upon me, menacing and full of doom, made me feel lost and\r\ngallows-ripe indeed. Suppose they should hang me! I had seen Sheeny Joe\r\ndispatched for Sing Sing from that very room! The memory of it, with the\r\nJudge lowering from the bench like a death-threat, sent a cold thought\r\nto creep and coil about my heart and crush it as in the folds of a\r\nsnake.\r\n\r\nThere came the pawnbroker to swear how he sold me the knife those years\r\nago. The prosecution insisted as an inference drawn from this, that\r\nthe knife was mine. Then a round dozen stood up to tell of my rush\r\nupon Jimmy the Blacksmith; and how he fell; and how, a moment later, I\r\nfronted them with the red knife in my clutch and the dead man weltering\r\nwhere he went down. Some there were who tried to say they saw me strike\r\nthe blow.\r\n\r\nWhile this evidence was piling up, ever and again some timid juryman\r\nwould glance towards Big Kennedy inquiringly. The latter would send back\r\nan ocular volley of threats that meant death or exile should that juror\r\nflinch or fail him.\r\n\r\nWhen the State ended, a score of witnesses took the stand in my behalf.\r\nOne and all, having been tutored by Big Kennedy, they told of the thrown\r\nknife which came singing through the air like a huge hornet from the\r\nfar outskirts of the crowd. Many had not seen the hand that hurled the\r\nknife; a few had been more fortunate, and described him faithfully as\r\na small lean man, dark, a red silk cloth over his head, and earrings\r\ndangling from his ears.\r\n\r\n“He was a sailorman, too,” said one, more graphic than the rest; “as I\r\ncould tell by the tar on his hands an' a ship tattooed on th' back of\r\none of 'em. He stood right by me when he flung the knife.”\r\n\r\n“Why didn't you seize him?” questioned the State's Attorney, with a\r\nhalf-sneer.\r\n\r\n“Not on your life!” said the witness. “I aint collarin' nobody; I don't\r\nget policeman's wages.”\r\n\r\nThe Judge gave his instructions to the jury, and I may say he did his\r\nbest, or worst, to drag me to the scaffold. The jurors listened; but\r\nthey owned eyes as well as ears, and for every word spoken by the\r\nJudge's tongue, Big Kennedy's eyes spoke two. Also, there was that\r\nfaultless exquisite, young Morton, close and familiar to my side. The\r\ndullest ox-wit of that panel might tell how I was belted about by strong\r\ninfluences, and ones that could work a vengeance. Wherefore, when the\r\njury at last retired, there went not one whose mind was not made up, and\r\nno more than twenty minutes ran by before the foreman's rap on the door\r\nannounced them as prepared to give decision. They filed soberly in. The\r\nclerk read the verdict.\r\n\r\n“Not guilty!”\r\n\r\nThe Judge's face was like thunder; he gulped and glared, and then\r\ndemanded:\r\n\r\n“Is this your verdict?”\r\n\r\n“It is,” returned the foreman, standing in his place; and his eleven\r\nfellow jurors, two of whom belonged to my Red Jackets, nodded assent.\r\n\r\nHome I went on wings. Anne met me in the hallway and welcomed me with a\r\nkiss. She wore a strange look, but in my hurry for Apple Cheek I took no\r\nparticular heed of that.\r\n\r\n“Where is she--where is my wife?” said I.\r\n\r\nThen a blackcoat man came from the rear room; he looked the doctor and\r\nhad the smell of drugs about him. Anne glanced at him questioningly.\r\n\r\n“I think he may come in,” he said. “But make no noise! Don't excite\r\nher!”\r\n\r\nApple Cheek, who was Apple Cheek no longer with her face hollowed and\r\nwhite, was lying in the bed. Her eyes were big and bright, and the ghost\r\nof a smile parted her wan lips.\r\n\r\n“I'm so happy!” she whispered, voice hardly above a breath. Then with\r\nweak hands she drew me down to her. “I've prayed and prayed, and I knew\r\nit would come right,” she murmured.\r\n\r\nThen Anne, who had followed me to the bedside, drew away the coverings.\r\nIt was like a revelation, for I had been told no word of it, nor so much\r\nas dreamed of such sweet chances. The dear surprise of it was in one\r\nsense like a blow, and I staggered on my feet as that day's threats\r\nhad owned no power to make me. There, with little face upturned and\r\nsleeping, was a babe!--our babe!\r\n\r\n--Apple Cheek's and mine!--our baby girl that had been born to us while\r\nits father lay in jail on a charge of murder! While I looked, it opened\r\nits eyes; and then a wailing, quivering cry went up that swept across my\r\nsoul like a tune of music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII--DARBY THE GOPHER\r\n\r\n\r\nFOXY BILLY CASSIDY made but slow work of obtaining those papers asked\r\nfor to overthrow our enemy, the Chief. He copied reams upon reams of\r\ncontracts and vouchers and accounts, but those to wholly match the\r\ncrushing purposes of Big Kennedy were not within his touch. The\r\ndocuments which would set the public ablaze were held in a safe, of\r\nwhich none save one most trusted by the Chief, and deep in both his\r\nplans and their perils, possessed the secret.\r\n\r\n“That's how the game stands,” explained Big Kennedy. “Foxy Billy's up\r\nag'inst it. The cards we need are in th' safe, an' Billy aint got th'\r\ncombination, d'ye see.”\r\n\r\n“Can anything be done with the one who has?”\r\n\r\n“Nothin',” replied Big Kennedy. “No, there's no gettin' next to th'\r\nparty with th' combination. Billy did try to stand in with this duck;\r\nan' say! he turned sore in a second.”\r\n\r\n“Then you've no hope?”\r\n\r\n“Not exactly that,” returned Big Kennedy, as though revolving some\r\nproposal in his mind. “I'll hit on a way. When it comes to a finish, I\r\ndon't think there's a safe in New York I couldn't turn inside out. But\r\nI've got to have time to think.”\r\n\r\nThere existed strong argument for exertion on Big Kennedy's part. Both\r\nhe and I were fighting literally for liberty and for life. Our sole\r\nhope of safety layin the overthrow of the Chief; we must destroy or be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy was alive to the situation. He said as much when, following\r\nthat verdict of “Not guilty!” I thanked him as one who had worked most\r\nfor my defense.\r\n\r\n“There's no thanks comin',” said Big Kennedy, in his bluff way. “I had\r\nto break th' Chief of that judge-an'-jury habit at th' go-off. He'd have\r\nnailed me next.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy and I, so to phrase it, were as prisoners of politics.\r\nOur feud with the Chief, as the days went by, widened to open war.\r\nIts political effect was to confine us to our own territory, and we\r\nundertook no enterprise which ran beyond our proper boundaries. It was\r\nas though our ward were a walled town. Outside all was peril; inside\r\nwe were secure. Against the Chief and the utmost of his power, we could\r\nkeep our own, and did. His word lost force when once it crossed our\r\nfrontiers; his mandates fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nStill, while I have described ourselves as ones in a kind of captivity,\r\nwe lived sumptuously enough on our small domain. Big Kennedy went about\r\nthe farming of his narrow acres with an agriculture deeper than ever. No\r\nenterprise that either invaded or found root in our region was permitted\r\nto go free, but one and all paid tribute. From street railways to push\r\ncarts, from wholesale stores to hand-organs, they must meet our levy or\r\nsee their interests pine. And thus we thrived.\r\n\r\nHowever, for all the rich fatness of our fortunes, Big Kennedy's designs\r\nagainst the Chief never cooled. On our enemy's side, we had daily proof\r\nthat he, in his planning, was equally sleepless. If it had not been for\r\nmy seat in the Board of Aldermen, and our local rule of the police which\r\nwas its corollary, the machine might have broken us down. As it was, we\r\nsustained ourselves, and the sun shone for our ward haymaking, if good\r\nweather went with us no farther.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon Big Kennedy of the suddenest broke upon me with an\r\nexclamation of triumph.\r\n\r\n“I have it!” he cried; “I know the party who will show us every paper in\r\nthat safe.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” said I.\r\n\r\n“I'll bring him to you to-morrow night. He's got a country place up th'\r\nriver, an' never leaves it. He hasn't been out of th' house for almost\r\nfive years, but I think I can get him to come.” Big Kennedy looked as\r\nthough the situation concealed a jest. “But I can't stand here talkin';\r\nI've got to scatter for th' Grand Central.”\r\n\r\nWho should this gifted individual be? Who was he who could come in from\r\na country house, which he had not quitted for five years, and hand\r\nus those private papers now locked, and fast asleep, within the\r\nComptroller's safe? The situation was becoming mysterious, and my\r\npatience would be on a stretch until the mystery was laid bare. The sure\r\nenthusiasm of Big Kennedy gave an impression of comfort. Big Kennedy was\r\nno hare-brained optimist, nor one to count his chickens before they were\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\nWhen Big Kennedy came into the sanctum on the following evening, the\r\ngrasp he gave me was the grasp of victory.\r\n\r\n“It's all over but th' yellin'!” said he; “we've got them papers in a\r\ncorner.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy presented me to a shy, retiring person, who bore him\r\ncompany, and who took my hand reluctantly. He was not ill-looking, this\r\nstranger; but he had a furtive roving eye--the eye of a trapped animal.\r\nHis skin, too, was of a yellow, pasty color, like bad piecrust, and\r\nthere abode a damp, chill atmosphere about him that smelled of caves and\r\ncaverns.\r\n\r\nAfter I greeted him, he walked away in a manner strangely unsocial, and,\r\nfinding a chair, sate himself down in a corner. He acted as might one\r\ndetained against his will and who was not the master of himself. Also,\r\nthere was something professional in it all, as though the purpose of\r\nhis presence were one of business. I mentioned in a whisper the queer\r\nsallowness of the stranger.\r\n\r\n“Sure!” said Big Kennedy. “It's th' prison pallor on him. I've got to\r\nlet him lay dead for a week or ten days to give him time to cover it\r\nwith a beard, as well as show a better haircut.”\r\n\r\n“Who is he?” I demanded, my amazement beginning to sit up.\r\n\r\n“He's a gopher,” returned Big Kennedy, surveying the stranger with\r\nvictorious complacency. “Yes, indeed; he can go through a safe like th'\r\ngrace of heaven through a prayer meetin'.”\r\n\r\n“Is he a burglar?”\r\n\r\n“Burglar? No!” retorted Big Kennedy disgustedly; “he's an artist. Any\r\nhobo could go in with drills an' spreaders an' pullers an' wedges, an'\r\ncrack a box. But this party does it by ear; just sits down before a\r\nsafe, an' fumbles an' fools with it ten minutes, an' swings her open.\r\nI tell you he's a wonder! He knows th' insides of a safe like a priest\r\nknows th' insides of a prayer-book.”\r\n\r\n“Where was he?” I asked. “Where did you pick him up?” and here I took\r\na second survey of the talented stranger, who dropped his eyes on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“The Pen,” said Big Kennedy. “The warden an' me are old side-partners,\r\nan' I borrowed him. I knew where he was, d'ye see! He's doin' a stretch\r\nof five years for a drop-trick he turned in an Albany bank. That's\r\nwhat comes of goin' outside your specialty; he'd ought to have stuck to\r\nsafes.”\r\n\r\n“Aren't you afraid he'll run?” I said. “You can't watch him night and\r\nday, and he'll give you the slip.”\r\n\r\n“No fear of his side-steppin',” replied Big Kennedy confidently. “He's\r\nonly got six weeks more to go, an' it wouldn't pay to slip his collar\r\nfor a little pinch of time like that. Besides, I've promised him five\r\nhundred dollars for this job, an' left it in th' warden's hands.”\r\n\r\n“What's his name?” I inquired.\r\n\r\n“Darby the Goph.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy now unfolded his plan for making Darby the Goph useful in\r\nour affairs. Foxy Billy would allow himself to get behind in his labors\r\nover the City books. In a spasm of industry he would arrange with his\r\nsuperiors to work nights until he was again abreast of his duties. Foxy\r\nBilly, night after night, would thus be left alone in the Comptroller's\r\noffice. The safe that baffled us for those priceless documents would be\r\nunguarded. Nothing would be thought by janitors and night watchmen of\r\nthe presence of Darby the Goph. He would be with Foxy Billy in the rôle\r\nof a friend, who meant no more than to kindly cheer his lonely labors.\r\n\r\nDarby the Goph would lounge and kill time while Foxy Billy moiled.\r\n\r\n“There's the scheme to put Darby inside,” said Big Kennedy in\r\nconclusion. “Once they're alone, he'll tear th' packin' out o' that\r\nsafe. When Billy has copied the papers, th' game's as simple as suckin'\r\neggs. We'll spring 'em, an' make th' Chief look like a dress suit at a\r\ngasfitters' ball.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy's programme was worked from beginning to end by Foxy Billy\r\nand Darby the Goph, and never jar nor jolt nor any least of friction.\r\nIt ran out as smoothly as two and two make four. In the end, Big Kennedy\r\nheld in his fingers every evidence required to uproot the Chief. The ear\r\nand the hand of Darby the Goph had in no sort lost their cunning.\r\n\r\n“An' now,” said Big Kennedy, when dismissing Darby the Goph, “you go\r\nback where you belong. I've wired the warden, an' he'll give you that\r\nbit of dough. I've sent for a copper to put you on th' train. I don't\r\nwant to take chances on you stayin' over a day. You might get to\r\nlushin', an' disgrace yourself with th' warden.”\r\n\r\nThe police officer arrived, and Big Kennedy told him to see Darby the\r\nGoph aboard the train.\r\n\r\n“Don't make no mistake,” said Big Kennedy, by way of warning. “He\r\nbelongs in Sing Sing, an' must get back without fail to-night. Stay by\r\nth' train till it pulls out.”\r\n\r\n“How about th' bristles?” said the officer, pointing to the two-weeks'\r\ngrowth of beard that stubbled the chin of the visitor. “Shall I have him\r\nscraped?”\r\n\r\n“No, they'll fix his face up there,” said Big Kennedy. “The warden don't\r\ncare what he looks like, only so he gets his clamps on him ag'in.”\r\n\r\n“Here's the documents,” said Big Kennedy, when Darby the Goph and his\r\nescort had departed. “The question now is, how to give th' Chief th'\r\ngaff, an' gaff him deep an' good. He's th' party who was goin' to leave\r\nme on both sides of th' street.” This last with an exultant sneer.\r\n\r\nIt was on my thoughts that the hand to hurl the thunderbolt we had been\r\nforging was that of the reputable old gentleman. The blow would fall\r\nmore smitingly if dealt by him; his was a name superior for this duty to\r\neither Big Kennedy's or my own. With this argument, Big Kennedy declared\r\nhimself in full accord.\r\n\r\n“It'll look more like th' real thing,” said he, “to have th' kick come\r\nfrom th' outside. Besides, if I went to th' fore it might get in my way\r\nhereafter.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman moved with becoming conservatism, not to say\r\ndignity. He took the documents furnished by the ingenuity of Darby the\r\nGoph, and the oil-burning industry of Foxy Billy, and pored over them\r\nfor a day. Then he sent for Big Kennedy. “The evidence you furnish\r\nme,” said he, “seems absolutely conclusive. It betrays a corruption not\r\nparalleled in modern times, with the head of Tammany as the hub of\r\nthe villainy. The town has been plundered of millions,” concluded the\r\nreputable old gentleman, with a fine oratorical flourish, “and it is my\r\nduty to lay bare this crime in all its enormity, as one of the people's\r\nRepresentatives.”\r\n\r\n“An' a taxpayer,” added Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“Sir, my duty as a Representative,” returned the reputable old gentleman\r\nseverely, “has precedence over my privileges as a taxpayer.” Then, as\r\nthough the question offered difficulties: “The first step should be the\r\npublication of these documents in a paper of repute.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman had grounds for hesitation. Our enemy, the\r\nChief, was not without his allies among the dailies of that hour. The\r\nChief was popular in certain glutton circles. He still held to those\r\ncharacteristics of a ready, laughing, generous recklessness that marked\r\nhim in a younger day when, as head of a fire company, with trousers\r\ntucked in boots, red shirt, fire helmet, and white coat thrown over arm,\r\nhe led the ropes and cheered his men. But what were excellent as traits\r\nin a fireman, became fatal under conditions where secrecy and a policy\r\nof no noise were required for his safety. He was headlong, careless;\r\nand, indifferent to discovery since he believed himself secure, the\r\ntrail of his wrongdoing was as widely obvious, not to say as unclean, as\r\nwas Broadway.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the reputable old gentleman, “the great thing is to pitch\r\nupon a proper paper.”\r\n\r\n“There's the _Dally Tory?_” suggested Big Kennedy. “It's a very honest\r\nsheet,” said the reputable old gentleman approvingly.\r\n\r\n“Also,” said Big Kennedy, “the Chief has just cut it out of th' City\r\nadvertisin', d'ye see, an' it's as warm as a wolf.”\r\n\r\nFor these double reasons of probity and wrath, the _Daily Tory_ was\r\nagreed to. The reputable old gentleman would put himself in touch with\r\nthe _Daily Tory_ without delay.\r\n\r\n“Who is this Chief of Tammany?” asked the reputable old gentleman,\r\ntowards the close of the conference. “Personally, I know but little\r\nabout him.”\r\n\r\n“He'd be all right,” said Big Kennedy, “but he was spoiled in the\r\nbringin' up. He was raised with th' fire companies, an' he made th'\r\nmistake of luggin' his speakin' trumpet into politics.”\r\n\r\n“But is he a deep, forceful man?”\r\n\r\n“No,” returned Big Kennedy, with a contemptuous toss of the hand. “If\r\nhe was, you wouldn't have been elected to Congress. He makes a brash\r\nappearance, but there's nothin' behind. You open his front door an'\r\nyou're in his back yard.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman was bowing us out of his library, when Big\r\nKennedy gave him a parting word.\r\n\r\n“Now remember: my name aint to show at all.”\r\n\r\n“But the honor!” exclaimed the reputable old gentleman. “The honor of\r\nthis mighty reform will be rightfully yours. You ought to have it.”\r\n\r\n“I'd rather have Tammany Hall,” responded Big Kennedy with a laugh, “an'\r\nif I get to be too much of a reformer it might queer me. No, you go in\r\nan' do up th' Chief. When he's rubbed out, I intend to be Chief in his\r\nplace. I'd rather be Chief than have th' honor you tell of. There's more\r\nmoney in it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you prefer money to honor?” returned the reputable old gentleman,\r\nsomewhat scandalized.\r\n\r\n“I'll take th' money for mine, every time,” responded Big Kennedy.\r\n“Honor ought to have a bank account. The man who hasn't anything but\r\nhonor gets pitied when he doesn't get laughed at, an' for my part I'm\r\nout for th' dust.”\r\n\r\nFour days later the _Daily Tory_ published the first of its articles; it\r\nfell upon our enemy with the force of a trip-hammer. From that hour the\r\nassaults on the Chief gained never let or stay. The battle staggered on\r\nfor months. The public, hating him for his insolence, joined in hunting\r\nhim. One by one those papers, so lately his adorers, showed him their\r\nbacks.\r\n\r\n“Papers sail only with the wind,” said Big Kennedy sagely, in commenting\r\non these ink-desertions of the Chief.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the trouble, Old Mike began to sicken for his end. He\r\nwas dying of old age, and the stream of his life went sinking into his\r\nyears like water into sand. Big Kennedy gave up politics to sit by the\r\nbedside of the dying old man. One day Old Mike seemed greatly to revive.\r\n\r\n“Jawn,” he said, “you'll be th' Chief of Tammany. The Chief, now\r\nfightin' for his life, will lose. The mish-take he made was in robbin'\r\nhonest people. Jawn, he should have robbed th' crim'nals an' th' law\r\nbreakers. The rogues can't fight back, an' th' honest people can. An'\r\nremember this: the public don't care for what it hears, only for what it\r\nsees. Never interfere with people's beer; give 'em clean streets; double\r\nthe number of lamp-posts--th' public's like a fly, it's crazy over\r\nlamps--an' have bands playin' in every par-rk. Then kape th' streets\r\nfree of ba-ad people, tinhorn min, an' such. You don't have to drive 'em\r\nout o' town, only off th' streets; th' public don't object to dirt, but\r\nit wants it kept in the back alleys. Jawn, if you'll follow what I tell\r\nyou, you can do what else ye plaze. The public will go with ye loike a\r\ndrunkard to th' openin' of a new s'loon.”\r\n\r\n“What you must do, father,” said Big Kennedy cheerfully, “is get well,\r\nan' see that I run things straight.”\r\n\r\n“Jawn,” returned Old Mike, smiling faintly, “this is Choosday; by\r\nSaturday night I'll be dead an' under th' daisies.”\r\n\r\nOld Mike's funeral was a creeping, snail-like, reluctant thing of miles,\r\nwith woe-breathing bands to mark the sorrowful march. Big Kennedy never\r\nforgot; and to the last of his power, the question uppermost in his\r\nmind, though never in his mouth, was whether or not that one who sought\r\nhis favor had followed Old Mike to the grave.\r\n\r\nThe day of Old Mike's funeral saw the destruction of our enemy, the\r\nChief. He fell with the crash of a tree. He fled, a hunted thing, and\r\nwas brought back to perish in a prison. And so came the end of him,\r\nby the wit of Big Kennedy and the furtive sleighty genius of Darby the\r\nGoph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII--BIG KENNEDY AND THE MUGWUMPS\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the old Chief was gone, Big Kennedy succeeded to his place as the\r\nruling spirit of the organization. For myself, I moved upward to become\r\na figure of power only a whit less imposing; for I stepped forth as\r\na leader of the ward, while in the general councils of Tammany I was\r\nrecognized as Big Kennedy's adviser and lieutenant.\r\n\r\nTo the outside eye, unskilled of politics in practice, everything of\r\nTammany sort would have seemed in the plight desperate. The efforts\r\nrequired for the overthrow of the old Chief, and Big Kennedy's bolt in\r\nfavor of the forces of reform--ever the blood enemy of Tammany--had torn\r\nthe organization to fragments. A first result of this dismemberment\r\nwas the formation of a rival organization meant to dominate the local\r\nDemocracy. This rival coterie was not without its reasons of strength,\r\nsince it was upheld as much as might be by the State machine. The\r\nsituation was one which for a time would compel Big Kennedy to tolerate\r\nthe company of his reform friends, and affect, even though he privately\r\nopposed them, some appearance of sympathy with their plans for the\r\npurification of the town.\r\n\r\n“But,” observed Big Kennedy, when we considered the business between\r\nourselves, “I think I can set these guys by the ears. There aint a man\r\nin New York who, directly or round th' corner, aint makin' money through\r\na broken law, an' these mugwumps aint any exception. I've invited three\r\nmembers of the main squeeze to see me, an' I'll make a side bet they get\r\ntired before I do.”\r\n\r\nIn deference to the invitation of Big Kennedy, there came to call upon\r\nhim a trio of civic excellence, each a personage of place. Leading\r\nthe three was our longtime friend, the reputable old gentleman. Of the\r\nothers, one was a personage whose many millions were invested in real\r\nestate, the rentals whereof ran into the hundreds of thousands, while\r\nhis companion throve as a wholesale grocer, a feature of whose business\r\nwas a rich trade in strong drink.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy met the triumvirate with brows of sanctimony, and was a\r\nmoral match for the purest. When mutual congratulations over virtue's\r\nlate successes at the ballot box, and the consequent dawn of whiter\r\ndays for the town, were ended, Big Kennedy, whose statecraft was of the\r\nblunt, positive kind, brought to the discussional center the purpose of\r\nthe meeting.\r\n\r\n“We're not only goin' to clean up th' town, gents,” said Big Kennedy\r\nunctuously, “but Tammany Hall as well. There's to be no more corruption;\r\nno more blackmail; every man an' every act must show as clean as a dog's\r\ntooth. I s'ppose, now, since we've got th' mayor, th' alderman, an' th'\r\npolice, our first duty is to jump in an' straighten up th' village?”\r\n Here Big Kennedy scanned the others with a virtuous eye.\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” observed the reputable old gentleman. “And since the most\r\nglaring evils ought to claim our earliest attention, we should compel\r\nthe police, without delay, to go about the elimination of the disorderly\r\nelements--the gambling dens, and other vice sinks. What do you say,\r\nGoldnose?” and the reputable old gentleman turned with a quick air to\r\nhim of the giant rent-rolls.\r\n\r\n“Now on those points,” responded the personage of real estate dubiously,\r\n“I should say that we ought to proceed slowly. You can't rid the\r\ncommunity of vice; history shows it to be impossible.” Then, with a\r\nlook of cunning meaning: “There exist, however, evils not morally bad,\r\nperhaps, that after all are violations of law, and get much more in the\r\nway of citizens than gambling or any of its sister iniquities.” Then,\r\nwheeling spitefully on the reputable old gentleman: “There's the\r\nsidewalk and street ordinances: You know the European Express Company,\r\nMorton? I understand that you are a heaviest stockholder in it. I went\r\nby that corner the other day and I couldn't get through for the jam\r\nof horses and trucks that choked the street. There they stood, sixty\r\nhorses, thirty trucks, and the side street fairly impassable. I\r\nscratched one side of my brougham to the point of ruin--scratched off my\r\ncoat-of-arms, in fact, on the pole of one of the trucks. I think that to\r\nenforce the laws meant to keep the street free of obstructions is more\r\nimportant, as a civic reform, than driving out gamblers. These latter\r\npeople, after all, get in nobody's way, and if one would find them one\r\nmust hunt for them. They are prompt with their rents, too, and ready to\r\npay a highest figure; they may be reckoned among the best tenants to be\r\nfound.”\r\n\r\nThe real estate personage was red in the face when he had finished this\r\nharangue. He wiped his brow and looked resentfully at the reputable old\r\ngentleman. That latter purist was now in a state of great personal heat.\r\n\r\n“Those sixty horses were being fed, sir,” said he with spirit. “The barn\r\nis more than a mile distant; there's no time to go there and back during\r\nthe noon hour. You can't have the barn on Broadway, you know. That would\r\nbe against the law, even if the value of Broadway property didn't put it\r\nout of reach.”\r\n\r\n“Still, it's against the law to obstruct the streets,” declared the\r\nreal-estate personage savagely, “just as much as it is against the law\r\nto gamble. And the trucks and teams are more of a public nuisance, sir!”\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” responded the reputable old gentleman, with a sneer,\r\n“that if my express horses paid somebody a double rent, paid it to you,\r\nGoldnose, for instance, they wouldn't be so much in the way.” Then, as\r\none exasperated to frankness: “Why don't you come squarely out like a\r\nman, and say that to drive the disorderly characters from the town would\r\ndrive a cipher or two off your rents?”\r\n\r\n“If I, or any other real-estate owner,” responded the baited one\r\nindignantly, “rent certain tenements, not otherwise to be let, to\r\ndisorderly characters, whose fault is it? I can't control the town for\r\neither its morals or its business. The town grows up about my property,\r\nand conditions are made to occur that practically condemn it. Good\r\npeople won't live there, and the property is unfit for stores or\r\nwarehouses. What is an owner to do? The neighborhood becomes such that\r\nbest people won't make of it a spot of residence. It's either no rent,\r\nor a tenant who lives somewhat in the shade. Real-estate owners, I\r\nsuppose, are to be left with millions of unrentable property on their\r\nhands; but you, on your side, are not to lose half an hour in taking\r\nyour horses to a place where they might lawfully be fed? What do you\r\nsay, Casebottle?” and the outraged real-estate prince turned to the\r\nwholesale grocer, as though seeking an ally.\r\n\r\n“I'm inclined, friend Goldnose,” returned the wholesale grocer suavely,\r\n“I'm inclined to think with you that it will be difficult to deal with\r\nthe town as though it were a camp meeting. Puritanism is offensive\r\nto the urban taste.” Here the wholesale grocer cleared his throat\r\nimpressively.\r\n\r\n“And so,” cried the reputable old gentleman, “you call the suppression\r\nof gamblers and base women, puritanism? Casebottle, I'm surprised!”\r\n\r\nThe wholesale grocer looked nettled, but held his peace. There came a\r\nmoment of silence. Big Kennedy, who had listened without interference,\r\nmaintaining the while an inflexible morality, took advantage of the\r\npause.\r\n\r\n“One thing,” said he, “about which I think you will all agree, is that\r\nevery ginmill open after hours, or on Sunday, should be pinched, and\r\nno side-doors or speakeasy racket stood for. We can seal th' town up as\r\ntight as sardines.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy glanced shrewdly at Casebottle. Here was a move that would\r\ninjure wholesale whisky. Casebottle, however, did not immediately\r\nrespond; it was the reputable old gentleman who spoke.\r\n\r\n“That's my notion,” said he, pursing his lips. “Every ginmill ought to\r\nbe closed as tight as a drum. The Sabbath should be kept free of that\r\ndisorder which rum-drinking is certain to breed.”\r\n\r\n“Well, then,” broke in Casebottle, whose face began to color as his\r\ninterests began to throb, “I say that a saloon is a poor man's club. If\r\nyou're going to close the saloons, I shall be in favor of shutting up\r\nthe clubs. I don't believe in one law for the poor and another for the\r\nrich.”\r\n\r\nThis should offer some impression of how the visitors agreed upon a\r\ncivil policy. Big Kennedy was good enough to offer for the others, each\r\nof whom felt himself somewhat caught in a trap, a loophole of escape.\r\n\r\n“For,” explained Big Kennedy, “while I believe in rigidly enforcin'\r\nevery law until it is repealed, I have always held that a law can be\r\ntacitly repealed by th' people, without waitin' for th' action of some\r\nskate legislature, who, comin' for th' most part from th' cornfields,\r\nhas got it in for us lucky ducks who live in th' town. To put it this\r\nway: If there's a Sunday closin' law, or a law ag'inst gamblers, or\r\na law ag'inst obstructin' th' streets, an' th' public don't want it\r\nenforced, then I hold it's repealed by th' highest authority in th'\r\nland, which is th' people, d'ye see!”\r\n\r\n“Now, I think that very well put,” replied the real-estate personage,\r\nwith a sigh of relief, while the wholesale grocer nodded approval. “I\r\nthink that very well put,” he went on, “and as it's getting late, I\r\nsuggest that we adjourn for the nonce, to meet with our friend, Mr.\r\nKennedy, on some further occasion. For myself, I can see that he and the\r\ngreat organization of which he is now, happily, the head, are heartily\r\nwith us for reforming the shocking conditions that have heretofore\r\npersisted in this community. We have won the election; as a corollary,\r\npeculation and blackmail and extortion will of necessity cease. I think,\r\nwith the utmost safety to the public interest, we can leave matters to\r\ntake their natural course, without pushing to extremes. Don't you think\r\nso, Mr. Kennedy?”\r\n\r\n“Sure!” returned that chieftain. “There's always more danger in too much\r\nsteam than in too little.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman was by no means in accord with the\r\nreal-estate personage; but since the wholesale grocer cast in his voice\r\nfor moderation and no extremes, he found himself in a hopeless minority\r\nof no one save himself. With an eye of high contempt, therefore, for\r\nwhat he described as “The reform that needs reform,” he went away with\r\nthe others, and the weighty convention for pure days was over.\r\n\r\n“An' that's th' last we'll see of 'em,” said Big Kennedy, with a laugh.\r\n“No cat enjoys havin' his own tail shut in th' door; no man likes th'\r\nreform that pulls a gun on his partic'lar interest. This whole reform\r\nracket,” continued Big Kennedy, who was in a temper to moralize, “is, to\r\nmy thinkin', a kind of pouter-pigeon play. Most of 'em who go in for\r\nit simply want to swell 'round. Besides the pouter-pigeon, who's in\r\nth' game because he's stuck on himself, there's only two breeds of\r\nreformers. One is a Republican who's got ashamed of himself; an' th'\r\nother is some crook who's been kicked out o' Tammany for graftin'\r\nwithout a license.”\r\n\r\n“Would your last include you and me?” I asked. I thought I might hazard\r\na small jest, since we were now alone.\r\n\r\n“It might,” returned Big Kennedy, with an iron grin. Then, twisting\r\nthe subject: “Now let's talk serious for two words. I've been doin' th'\r\nbunco act so long with our three friends that my face begins to ache\r\nwith lookin' pious. Now listen: You an' me have got a long road ahead of\r\nus, an' money to be picked up on both sides. But let me break this off\r\nto you, an' don't let a word get away. When you do get th' stuff, don't\r\ngo to buildin' brownstone fronts, an' buyin' trottin' horses, an' givin'\r\nyourself away with any Coal-Oil Johnny capers. If we were Republicans\r\nor mugwumps it might do. But let a Democrat get a dollar, an' there's a\r\nwarrant out for him before night. When you get a wad, bury it like a dog\r\ndoes a bone. An' speakin' of money; I've sent for th' Chief of Police..\r\nCome to think of it, we'd better talk over to my house. I'll go there\r\nnow, an' you stay an' lay for him. When he shows up, bring him to me.\r\nThere won't be so many pipin' us off over to my house.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy left the Tammany headquarters, where he and the good\r\ngovernment trio had conferred, and sauntered away in the direction\r\nof his habitat. The Chief of Police did not keep me in suspense. Big\r\nKennedy was not four blocks away when that blue functionary appeared.\r\n\r\n“I'm to go with you to his house,” said I.\r\n\r\nThe head of the police was a bloated porpoise-body of a man, oily,\r\nplausible, masking his cunning with an appearance of frankness. As for\r\nscruple; why then the sharks go more freighted of a conscience.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy met the Chief of Police with the freedom that belongs with\r\nan acquaintance, boy and man, of forty years. In a moment they had\r\ngotten to the marrow of what was between them.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Big Kennedy, “Tammany's crippled just now with not\r\nhavin' complete swing in th' town; an' I've got to bunk in more or less\r\nwith the mugwumps. Still, we've th' upper hand in th' Board of Aldermen,\r\nan' are stronger everywhere than any other single party. Now you\r\nunderstand;” and here Big Kennedy bent a keen eye on the other. “Th'\r\norganization's in need of steady, monthly contributions. We'll want 'em\r\nin th' work I'm layin' out. I think you know where to get 'em, an' I\r\nleave it to you to organize th' graft. You get your bit, d'ye see! I'm\r\ngoin' to name a party, however, to act as your wardman an' make th'\r\ncollections. What sort is that McCue who was made Inspector about a week\r\nago?”\r\n\r\n“McCue!” returned the Chief of Police in tones of surprise. “That man\r\nwould never do! He's as honest as a clock!”\r\n\r\n“Honest!” exclaimed Big Kennedy, and his amazement was a picture. “Well,\r\nwhat does he think he's doin' on th' force, then?”\r\n\r\n“That's too many for me,” replied the other. Then, apologetically: “But\r\nyou can see yourself, that when you rake together six thousand men, no\r\nmatter how you pick 'em out, some of 'em's goin' to be honest.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” assented Big Kennedy thoughtfully, “I s'ppose that's so, too.\r\nIt would be askin' too much to expect that a force, as you say, of six\r\nthousand could be brought together, an' have 'em all crooked. It was\r\nFather Considine who mentioned this McCue; he said he was his cousin an'\r\nasked me to give him a shove along. It shows what I've claimed a dozen\r\ntimes, that th' Church ought to keep its nose out o' politics. However,\r\nI'll look over th' list, an' give you some good name to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“But how about th' town?” asked the Chief of Police anxiously. “I want\r\nto know what I'm doin'. Tell me plain, just what goes an' what don't.”\r\n\r\n“This for a pointer, then,” responded Big Kennedy. “Whatever goes has\r\ngot to go on th' quiet. I've got to keep things smooth between me an'\r\nth' mugwumps. The gamblers can run; an' I don't find any fault with even\r\nth' green-goods people. None of 'em can beat a man who don't put himself\r\nwithin his reach, an' I don't protect suckers. But knucks, dips,\r\nsneaks, second-story people, an' strong-arm men have got to quit. That's\r\nstraight; let a trick come off on th' street cars, or at th' theater, or\r\nin the dark, or let a crib get cracked, an' there'll be trouble between\r\nyou an' me, d'ye see! An' if anything as big as a bank should get done\r\nup, why then, you send in your resignation. An' at that, you'll be dead\r\nlucky if you don't do time.”\r\n\r\n“There's th' stations an' th' ferries,” said the other, with an\r\ninsinuating leer. “You know a mob of them Western fine-workers are\r\nlikely to blow in on us, an' we not wise to 'em--not havin' their mugs\r\nin the gallery. That sort of knuck might do business at th' depots\r\nor ferries, an' we couldn't help ourselves. Anyway,” he concluded\r\nhopefully, “they seldom touch up our own citizens; it's mostly th'\r\nfarmers they go through.”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Big Kennedy cheerfully, “I'm not worryin' about what\r\ncomes off with th' farmers. But you tell them fine-workers, whose mugs\r\nyou haven't got, that if anyone who can vote or raise a row in New York\r\nCity goes shy his watch or leather, th' artist who gets it can't come\r\nhere ag'in. Now mind: You've got to keep this town so I can hang my\r\nwatch on any lamp-post in it, an' go back in a week an' find it hasn't\r\nbeen touched. There'll be plenty of ways for me an' you to get rich\r\nwithout standin' for sneaks an' hold-ups.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy, so soon as he got possession of Tammany, began divers\r\nimprovements of a political sort, and each looking to our safety and\r\nperpetuation. One of his moves was to break up the ward gangs, and this\r\nincluded the Tin Whistles.\r\n\r\n“For one thing, we don't need 'em--you an' me,” said he. “They could\r\nonly help us while we stayed in our ward an' kept in touch with 'em. The\r\ngangs strengthen th' ward leaders, but they don't strengthen th' Chief.\r\nSo we're goin' to abolish 'em. The weaker we make th' ward leaders, the\r\nstronger we make ourselves. Do you ketch on?” and Big Kennedy nudged me\r\nsignificantly.\r\n\r\n“You've got to disband, boys,” said I, when I had called the Tin\r\nWhistles together. “Throw away your whistles. Big Kennedy told me that\r\nthe first toot on one of 'em would get the musician thirty days on the\r\nIsland. It's an order; so don't bark your shins against it.”\r\n\r\nAfter Big Kennedy was installed as Chief, affairs in their currents for\r\neither Big Kennedy or myself went flowing never more prosperously. The\r\ntown settled to its lines; and the Chief of Police, with a wardman whom\r\nBig Kennedy selected, and who was bitten by no defect of integrity like\r\nthe dangerous McCue, was making monthly returns of funds collected for\r\n“campaign purposes” with which the most exacting could have found no\r\nfault. We were rich, Big Kennedy and I; and acting on that suggestion of\r\nconcealment, neither was blowing a bugle over his good luck.\r\n\r\nI could have been happy, being now successful beyond any dream that\r\nmy memory could lay hands on, had it not been for Apple Cheek and her\r\nwaning health. She, poor girl, had never been the same after my trial\r\nfor the death of Jimmy the Blacksmith; the shock of that trouble bore\r\nher down beyond recall. The doctors called it a nervous prostration, but\r\nI think, what with the fright and the grief of it, that the poor child\r\nbroke her heart. She was like something broken; and although years went\r\nby she never once held up her head. Apple Cheek faded slowly away, and\r\nat last died in my arms.\r\n\r\nWhen she passed, and it fell upon me like a pall that Apple Cheek had\r\ngone from me forever, my very heart withered and perished within me.\r\nThere was but one thing to live for: Blossom, my baby girl. Anne came\r\nto dwell with us to be a mother to her, and it was good for me what Anne\r\ndid, and better still for little Blossom. I was no one to have Blossom's\r\nupbringing, being ignorant and rude, and unable to look upon her without\r\nmy eyes filling up for thoughts of my lost Apple Cheek. That was\r\na sharpest of griefs--the going of Apple Cheek! My one hope lay in\r\nforgetfulness, and I courted it by working at politics, daylight and\r\ndark.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, too, that the blow that sped death to Apple Cheek had\r\nleft its nervous marks on little Blossom. She was timid, hysterical,\r\nterror-whipped of fears that had no form. She would shriek out in the\r\nnight as though a fiend frighted her, and yet could tell no story of it.\r\nShe lived the victim of a vast formless fear that was to her as a demon\r\nwithout outlines or members or face. One blessing: I could give the\r\ntrembling Blossom rest by holding her close in my arms, and thus she has\r\nslept the whole night through. The “frights,” she said, fled when I was\r\nby.\r\n\r\nIn that hour, Anne was my sunshine and support; I think I should have\r\nfollowed Apple Cheek had it not been for Blossom, and Anne's gentle\r\ncourage to hold me up. For all that, my home was a home of clouds and\r\ngloom; waking or sleeping, sorrow pressed upon me like a great stone. I\r\ntook no joy, growing grim and silent, and far older than my years.\r\n\r\nOne evening when Big Kennedy and I were closeted over some enterprise\r\nof politics, that memorable exquisite, young Morton, was announced.\r\nHe greeted us with his old-time vacuity of lisp and glance, and after\r\nmounting that double eyeglass, so potent with the herd, he said:\r\n“Gentlemen, I've come to make some money.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV--THE MULBERRY FRANCHISE\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT'S my purpose in a nutshell,” lisped young Morton; “I've decided to\r\nmake some money; and I've come for millions.” Here he waved a delicate\r\nhand, and bestowed upon Big Kennedy and myself his look of amiable\r\ninanity.\r\n\r\n“Millions, eh?” returned Big Kennedy, with his metallic grin. “I've seen\r\nwhole fam'lies taken the same way. However, I'm glad you're no piker.”\r\n\r\n“If by 'piker,'” drawled young Morton, “you mean one of those cheap\r\npersons who play for minimum stakes, I assure you that I should scorn\r\nto be so described; I should, really! No, indeed; it requires no more of\r\nthought or effort to play for millions than for ten-dollar bills.”\r\n\r\n“An' dead right you are!” observed Big Kennedy with hearty emphasis. “A\r\nsport can buck faro bank for a million as easily as for a white chip.\r\nThat is, if he can find a game that'll turn for such a bundle, an' has\r\nth' money to back his nerve. What's true of faro is true of business.\r\nSo you're out for millions! I thought your old gent, who's into fifty\r\nenterprises an' has been for as many years, had long ago shaken\r\ndown mankind for a whole mountain of dough. The papers call him a\r\nmultimillionaire.”\r\n\r\nYoung Morton, still with the empty smile, brought forth a cigarette\r\ncase. The case, gold, was adorned with a ruby whereon to press when one\r\nwould open it, and wore besides the owner's monogram in diamonds. Having\r\nlighted a cigarette, he polished his eyeglass with a filmy handkerchief.\r\nRe-establishing the eyeglass on his high patrician nose, he again shone\r\nvacuously upon Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\nThat personage had watched these manifestations of fastidious culture\r\nin a spirit of high delight. Big Kennedy liked young Morton; he had long\r\nago made out how those dandyisms were no more than a cover for what fund\r\nof force and cunning dwelt beneath. In truth, Big Kennedy regarded young\r\nMorton's imbecilities as a most fortunate disguise. His remark would\r\nshow as much. As young Morton--cigarette just clinging between his lips,\r\neye of shallow good humor--bent towards him, he said, addressing me:\r\n\r\n“Say! get onto that front! That look of not knowin' nothin' ought\r\nby itself to cash in for half a million! Did you ever see such a\r\nthrow-off?” and here Big Kennedy quite lost himself in a maze of\r\nadmiration. Recovering, however, and again facing our caller, he\r\nrepeated: “Yes, I thought your old gent had millions.”\r\n\r\n“Both he and the press,” responded young Morton, “concede that he has;\r\nthey do, really! Moreover, he possesses, I think, the evidence of it in\r\na cord or two of bonds and stocks, don't y' know! But in what fashion,\r\npray, does that bear upon my present intentions as I've briefly laid\r\nthem bare?”\r\n\r\n“No fashion,” said Big Kennedy, “only I'd naturally s'ppose that when\r\nyou went shy on th' long green, you'd touch th' old gentleman.”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly,” returned young Morton, “I could approach my father with\r\na request for money--that is if my proposal were framed in a spirit of\r\nmoderation, don't y' know!--say one hundred thousand dollars. But such\r\na sum, in my present temper, would be but the shadow of a trifle. I\r\nowe five times the amount; I do, really! I've no doubt I'm on Tiffany's\r\nbooks for more than one hundred thousand, while my bill at the florist's\r\nshould be at least ten thousand dollars, if the pen of that brigand of\r\nnosegays has kept half pace with his rapacity. However,” concluded young\r\nMorton, breaking into a soft, engaging laugh, “since I intend, with your\r\naid, to become the master of millions, such bagatelles are unimportant,\r\ndon't y' know.”\r\n\r\n“Certainly!” observed Big Kennedy in a consolatory tone; “they don't\r\namount to a deuce in a bum deck. Still, I must say you went in up to\r\nyour neck on sparks an' voylets. I never saw such a plunger on gewgaws\r\nan' garlands since a yard of cloth made a coat for me.”\r\n\r\n“Those bills arose through my efforts to make grand opera beautiful. I\r\nset the prima donna ablaze with gems; and as for the stage, why, it was\r\nlike singing in a conservatory; it was really!”\r\n\r\n“Well, let that go!” said Big Kennedy, after a pause. “I shall be glad\r\nif through my help you make them millions. If you do, d'ye see, I'll\r\nmake an armful just as big; it's ag'inst my religion to let anybody grab\r\noff a bigger piece of pie than I do when him an' me is pals. It would\r\nlower my opinion of myself. However, layin' guff aside, s'ppose you butt\r\nin now an' open up your little scheme. Let's see what button you think\r\nyou're goin' to push.”\r\n\r\n“This is my thought,” responded young Morton, and as he spoke the\r\neyeglass dropped from its aquiline perch, and under the heat of a\r\nreal animation those mists of affectation were dissipated; “this is my\r\nthought: I want a street railway franchise along Mulberry Avenue, the\r\nlength of the Island.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“It's my plan to form a corporation---Mulberry Traction. There'll be\r\neight millions of preferred stock at eight per cent. I can build and\r\nequip the road with that. In addition, there'll be ten millions of\r\ncommon stock.”\r\n\r\n“Have you th' people ready to take th' preferred?”\r\n\r\n“Ready and waiting. If I had the franchise, I could float those eight\r\nmillions within ten days.”\r\n\r\n“What do you figger would be th' road's profits?”\r\n\r\n“It would carry four hundred thousand passengers a day, and take in\r\ntwenty thousand dollars. The operating expenses would not exceed an\r\nannual four millions and a half. That, after the eight per cent, on\r\nthe preferred were paid, would leave over two millions a year on the\r\ncommon--a dividend of twenty per cent., or five per cent, every quarter.\r\nYou can see where such returns would put the stock. You, for your ride,\r\nwould go into the common on the ground floor.”\r\n\r\n“We'll get to how I go in, in a minute,” responded Big Kennedy dryly.\r\nHe was impressed by young Morton's proposal, and was threshing it out in\r\nhis mind as they talked. “Now, see here,” he went on, lowering his\r\nbrows and fixing his keen gray glance on young Morton, “you mustn't get\r\nrestless if I ask you questions. I like to tap every wheel an' try every\r\nrivet on a scheme or a man before I hook up with either.”\r\n\r\n“Ask what you please,” said young Morton, as brisk as a terrier.\r\n\r\n“I'll say this,” observed Big Kennedy. “That traction notion shows that\r\nyou're a hogshead of horse sense. But of course you understand that\r\nyou're going to need money, an' plenty of it, before you get th'\r\nfranchise. I can take care of th' Tammany push, perhaps; but there's\r\nhighbinders up to your end of th' alley who'll want to be greased.”\r\n\r\n“How much do you argue that I'll require as a preliminary to the grant\r\nof the franchise?” asked young Morton, interrupting Big Kennedy.\r\n\r\n“Every splinter of four hundred thousand.”\r\n\r\n“That was my estimate,” said young Morton; “but I've arranged for twice\r\nthat sum.”\r\n\r\n“Who is th' Rothschild you will get it from?”\r\n\r\n“My father,” replied young Morton, and now he lapsed anew into his\r\nmanner of vapidity. “Really, he takes an eighth of the preferred at\r\npar--one million! I've got the money in the bank, don't y' know!”\r\n\r\n“Good!” ejaculated Big Kennedy, with the gleam which never failed to\r\nsparkle in his eye at the mention of rotund riches.\r\n\r\n“My father doesn't know my plans,” continued young Morton, his indolence\r\nand his eyeglass both restored. “No; he wouldn't let me tell him; he\r\nwouldn't, really! I approached him in this wise:\r\n\r\n“'Father,' said I, 'you are aware of the New York alternative?'\r\n\r\n“'What is it?' he asked.\r\n\r\n“'Get money or get out.'\r\n\r\n“'Well!' said he.\r\n\r\n“'Father, I've decided not to move. Yes, father; after a full\r\nconsideration of the situation, I've resolved to make, say twenty or\r\nthirty millions for myself; I have, really! It's quite necessary, don't\r\ny' know; I am absolutely bankrupt. And I don't like it; there's nothing\r\ncomfortable in being bankrupt, it so deucedly restricts a man. Besides,\r\nit's not good form. I've evolved an idea, however; there's a business I\r\ncan go into.'\r\n\r\n“'Store?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n“'No, no, father,' I replied, for the odious supposition quite upset me;\r\n'it's nothing so horribly vulgar as trade; it's a speculation, don't y'\r\nknow. There'll be eight millions of preferred stock; you are to take a\r\nmillion. Also, you are to give me the million at once.'\r\n\r\n“'What is this speculation?' he asked. 'If I'm to go in for a million, I\r\ntake it you can entrust me with the outlines.'\r\n\r\n“'Really, it was on my mind to do so,' I replied.\r\n\r\n“'My scheme is this: I shall make an alliance with Mr. Kennedy.'\r\n\r\n“'Stop, stop!' cried my father hastily. 'On the whole, I don't care to\r\nhear your scheme. You shall have the money; but I've decided that it\r\nwill reflect more glory upon you should you bring things to an issue\r\nwithout advice from me. Therefore, you need tell me no more; positively,\r\nI will not hear you.'”\r\n\r\n“It was my name made him leary,” observed Big Kennedy, with the\r\ngratified face of one who has been paid a compliment. “When you said\r\n'Kennedy,' he just about figgered we were out to get a kit of tools\r\nan' pry a shutter off th' First National. It's th' mugwump notion of\r\nTammany, d'ye see! You put him onto it some time, that now I'm Chief\r\nI've got center-bits an' jimmies skinned to death when it comes to\r\nmakin' money.”\r\n\r\n“I don't think it was your name,” observed young Morton. “He's beginning\r\nto learn, however, about my voting those three hundred wenches in\r\noveralls and jumpers, don't y' know, and it has taught him to distrust\r\nmy methods as lacking that element of conservatism which he values so\r\nmuch. It was that which came uppermost in his memory, and it occurred\r\nto him that perhaps the less he knew about my enterprises the sounder he\r\nwould sleep. Is it not remarkable, how fondly even an advanced man like\r\nmy father will cling to the moss-grown and the obsolete?”\r\n\r\n“That's no dream neither!” exclaimed Big Kennedy, in earnest coincidence\r\nwith young Morton. “It's this old fogy business on th' parts of people\r\nwho ought to be leadin' up th' dance for progress, that sends me to bed\r\ntired in th' middle of th' day!” And here Big Kennedy shook his head\r\nreproachfully at gray ones whose sluggishness had wounded him.\r\n\r\n“My father drew his check,” continued young Morton. “He couldn't let it\r\ncome to me, however, without a chiding. Wonderful, how the aged like\r\nto lord it over younger folk with rebukes for following in their\r\nfootsteps--really!\r\n\r\n“'You speak of bankruptcy,' said my father, sucking in his cheeks.\r\n'Would it violate confidence should you tell me how you come to be in\r\nsuch a disgraceful predicament?' This last was asked in a spirit of\r\nsarcasm, don't y' know.\r\n\r\n“'It was by following your advice, sir,' said I.\r\n\r\n“'Following my advice!' exclaimed my father. 'What do you mean, sir? Or\r\nare you mad?'\r\n\r\n“'Not at all,' I returned. 'Don't you recall how, when I came from\r\ncollege, you gave me a world of advice, and laid particular stress on\r\nmy establishing a perfect credit? “Nothing is done without credit,” you\r\nsaid on that occasion; “and it should be the care of a young man, as\r\nhe enters upon life, to see to it that his credit is perfect in every\r\nquarter of trade. He should extend his credit with every opportunity.”\r\n This counsel made a deep impression upon me, it did, really! and so I've\r\nextended my credit wherever I saw a chance until I owe a half-million.\r\nI must say, father, that I think it would have saved me money, don't\r\ny' know, had you told me to destroy my credit as hard as I could. In\r\nfostering my credit, I but warmed a viper.'”\r\n\r\nYoung Morton paused to fire another cigarette, while the pucker about\r\nthe corner of his eye indicated that he felt as though he had turned the\r\nlaugh upon his father. Following a puff or two, he returned gravely to\r\nMulberry Traction.\r\n\r\n“Do you approve my proposition?” he asked of Big Kennedy, “and will you\r\ngive me your aid?”\r\n\r\n“The proposition's all hunk,” said Big Kennedy. “As to my aid: that\r\ndepends on whether we come to terms.”\r\n\r\n“What share would you want?”\r\n\r\n“Forty per cent, of th' common stock,” responded Big Kennedy. “That's\r\nalways th' Tammany end; forty per cent.”\r\n\r\nYoung Morton drew in his lips. The figure seemed a surprise. “Do you\r\nmean that you receive four millions of the common stock, you paying\r\nnothing?” he asked at last.\r\n\r\n“I don't pony for a sou markee. An' I get th' four millions, d'ye see!\r\nWho ever heard of Tammany payin' for anything!” and Big Kennedy glared\r\nabout the room, and sniffed through his nose, as though in the presence\r\nof all that might be called preposterous.\r\n\r\n“But if you put in no money,” remonstrated young Morton, “why should\r\nyou have the stock? I admit that you ought to be let in on lowest terms;\r\nbut, after all, you should put in something.”\r\n\r\n“I put in my pull,” retorted Big Kennedy grimly. “You get your franchise\r\nfrom me.”\r\n\r\n“From the City,” corrected young Morton.\r\n\r\n“I'm the City,” replied Big Kennedy; “an' will be while I'm on top of\r\nTammany, an' Tammany's on top of th' town.” Then, with a friendliness\r\nof humor: “Here, I like you, an' I'll go out o' my way to educate you\r\non this point. You're fly to some things, an' a farmer on others. Now\r\nunderstand: The City's a come-on--a sucker--an' it belongs to whoever\r\npicks it up. That's me this trip, d'ye see! Now notice: I've got no\r\noffice; I'm a private citizen same as you, an' I don't owe no duty to\r\nth' public. Every man has his pull--his influence. You've got your pull;\r\nI've got mine. When a man wants anything from th' town, he gets his\r\npull to work. In this case, my pull is bigger than all th' other pulls\r\nclubbed together. You get that franchise or you don't get it, just as I\r\nsay. In short, you get it from me--get it by my pull, d'ye see! Now why\r\nshouldn't I charge for th' use of my pull, just as a lawyer asks his\r\nfee, or a bank demands interest when it lends? My pull's my pull; it's\r\nmy property as much as a bank's money is th' bank's, or a lawyer's\r\nbrains is the lawyer's. I worked hard to get it, an' there's hundreds\r\nwho'd take it from me if they could. There's my doctrine: I'm a private\r\ncitizen; my pull is my capital, an' I'm as much entitled to get action\r\non it in favor of myself as a bank has to shave a note. That's why\r\nI take forty per cent. It's little enough: The franchise will be\r\nfour-fifths of th' whole value of th' road; an' all I have for it is\r\ntwo-fifths of five-ninths, for you've got to take into account them\r\neight millions of preferred.”\r\n\r\nYoung Morton was either convinced of the propriety of what Big Kennedy\r\nurged, or saw--the latter is the more likely surmise--that he must\r\nagree if he would attain success for his enterprise. He made no more\r\nobjection, and those forty per cent, in favor of Big Kennedy were looked\r\nupon as the thing adjusted.\r\n\r\n“You spoke of four hundred thousand dollars as precedent to the\r\nfranchise,” said young Morton. “Where will that go?”\r\n\r\n“There's as many as thirty hungry ones who, here an' there an' each in\r\nour way, must be met an' squared.”\r\n\r\n“How much will go to your fellows?”\r\n\r\n“Most of th' Tammany crowd I can beat into line. But there's twelve who\r\nwon't take orders. They were elected as 'Fusion' candidates, an' they\r\nthink that entitles 'em to play a lone hand. Whenever Tammany gets th'\r\ntown to itself, you can gamble! I'll knock their blocks off quick. You\r\nask what it'll take to hold down th' Tammany people? I should say two\r\nhundred thousand dollars. We'll make it this way: I'll take thirty per\r\ncent, instead of forty of th' common, an' two hundred thousand in coin.\r\nThat'll be enough to give us th' Tammany bunch as solid as a brick\r\nswitch shanty.”\r\n\r\n“That should do,” observed young Morton thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nWhen young Morton was about to go, Big Kennedy detained him with a final\r\nquery.\r\n\r\n“This aint meant to stick pins into you,” said Big Kennedy, “but, on th'\r\ndead! I'd like to learn how you moral an' social high-rollers reconcile\r\nyourselves to things. How do you agree with yourself to buy them votes\r\nneeded to get th' franchise? Not th' ones I'll bring in, an' which you\r\ncan pretend you don't know about; but them you'll have to deal with\r\npersonally, d'ye see!”\r\n\r\n“There'll be none I'll deal with personally, don't y' know,” returned\r\nyoung Morton, getting behind his lisp and eyeglass, finding them a\r\nrefuge in what was plainly an embarrassed moment, “no; I wouldn't do\r\nanything with the vulgar creatures in person. They talk such awful\r\nEnglish, it gets upon my nerves--really! But I've retained Caucus &\r\nClub; they're lawyers, only they don't practice law, they practice\r\npolitics. They'll attend to those low details of which you speak. For me\r\nto do so wouldn't be good form. It would shock my set to death, don't y'\r\nknow!”\r\n\r\n“That's a crawl-out,” observed Big Kennedy reproachfully, “an' it aint\r\nworthy of you. Why don't you come to th' center? You're goin' to give\r\nup four hundred thousand dollars to get this franchise. You don't think\r\nit's funny--you don't do it because you like it, an' are swept down in a\r\ngust of generosity. An' you do think it's wrong.”\r\n\r\n“Really, now you're in error,” replied young Morton earnestly, but\r\nstill clinging to his lisp and his languors. “As you urge, one has\r\nscant pleasure in paying this money. On the contrary, I shall find it\r\nextremely dull, don't y' know! But I don't call it wrong. I'm entitled,\r\nunder the law, and the town's practice--a highly idiotic one, this\r\nlatter, I concede!--of giving these franchises away, to come forward\r\nwith my proposition. Since I offer to build a perfect road, and to run\r\nit in a perfect manner, I ought, as a matter of right--always bearing\r\nin mind the town's witless practice aforesaid--to be granted this\r\nfranchise. But those officers of the city who, acting for the city,\r\nshould make the grant, refuse to do their duty by either the city or\r\nmyself, unless I pay to each of them, say ten thousand dollars; they\r\ndo, really! What am I to do? I didn't select those officers; the public\r\npicked them out. Must I suffer loss, and go defeated of my rights,\r\nbecause the public was so careless or so ignorant as to pitch upon those\r\nimproper, or, if you will, dishonest officials? I say, No. The fault is\r\nnot mine; surely the loss should not be mine. I come off badly enough\r\nwhen I submit to the extortion. No, it is no more bribery, so far as\r\nI am involved, than it is bribery when I surrender my watch to that\r\nfootpad who has a pistol at my ear. In each instance, the public should\r\nhave saved me and has failed, don't y' know. The public, thus derelict,\r\nmust not denounce me when, under conditions which its own neglect has\r\ncreated, I take the one path left open to insure myself; it mustn't,\r\nreally!”\r\n\r\nYoung Morton wiped the drops from his brow, and I could tell how he was\r\ndeeply in earnest in what he thus put forward. Big Kennedy clapped him\r\nlustily on the back.\r\n\r\n“Put it there!” he cried, extending his hand. “I couldn't have said it\r\nbetter myself, an' I aint been doin' nothin' but buy aldermen since I\r\ncut my wisdom teeth. There's one last suggestion, however: I take it,\r\nyou're onto the' fact that Blackberry Traction will lock horns with us\r\nover this franchise. We parallel their road, d'ye see, an' they'll try\r\nto do us up.” Then to me: “Who are th' Blackberry's pets in th' Board?”\r\n\r\n“McGinty and Doloran,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“Keep your peepers on them babies. You can tell by th' way they go\r\nto bat, whether th' Blackberry has signed up to them to kill our\r\nfranchise.”\r\n\r\n“I can tell on the instant,” I said.\r\n\r\n“That has all been anticipated,” observed young Morton. “The president\r\nof Blackberry Traction is a member of my club; we belong in the same\r\nsocial set. I foresaw his opposition, and I've provided for it; I have,\r\nreally! McGinty and Doloran, you say? The names sound like the enemy.\r\nPlease post me if those interesting individuals move for our disfavor.”\r\n\r\nAnd now we went to work. Whatever was demanded of the situation as it\r\nunfolded found prompt reply, and in the course of time Mulberry Traction\r\nwas given its franchise. The Blackberry at one crisis came forward to\r\nwork an interruption; the sudden hot enmity of McGinty and Doloran was\r\ndisplayed. I gave notice of it to young Morton.\r\n\r\n“I'll arrange the matter,” he said. “At the next meeting of the Board I\r\nthink they will be with us, don't y' know.”\r\n\r\nIt was even so; and since Big Kennedy, with my aid, discharged every\r\nresponsibility that was his, the ordinance granting the franchise went\r\nthrough, McGinty and Doloran voting loudly with the affirmative. They\r\nwere stubborn caitiffs, capable of much destructive effort, and their\r\nfinal tameness won upon my surprise. I put the question of it to young\r\nMorton.\r\n\r\n“This is the secret of that miracle,” said he. “The president of\r\nBlackberry has been a Wall Street loser, don't y' know, for more than a\r\nyear--has lost more than he could honestly pay. And yet he paid! Where\r\ndid he get the money? At first I asked myself the question in a feeling\r\nof lazy curiosity. When I decided to organize our Mulberry Traction, I\r\nasked it in earnest; I did, really! I foresaw my friend's opposition,\r\nand was seeking a weapon against him. Wherefore I looked him over\r\nwith care, trying to determine where he got his loans. Now, he was the\r\npresident, and incidentally a director, of the Confidence Trust Company.\r\nI bought stock in the Confidence. Then I drew into my interest that\r\nemployee who had charge of the company's loans. I discovered that our\r\nBlackberry president had borrowed seven millions from the Trust\r\nCompany, giving as security a collection of dogs and cats and chips and\r\nwhetstones, don't y' know! That was wrong; considering his position\r\nas an officer of the company, it was criminal. I made myself master of\r\nevery proof required to establish his guilt in court. Then I waited.\r\nWhen you told me of those evil symptoms manifested by McGinty and\r\nDoloran, I took our president into the Fifth Avenue window of the club\r\nand showed him those evidences of his sins. He looked them over, lighted\r\na cigar, and after musing for a moment, asked if the help of McGinty and\r\nDoloran for our franchise would make towards my gratification. I told\r\nhim I would be charmed--really! You know the rest. Oh, no; I did not do\r\nso rude a thing as threaten an arrest. It wasn't required. Our president\r\nis a highly intellectual man. Besides, it wouldn't have been clubby; and\r\nit would have been bad form. And,” concluded young Morton, twirling\r\nhis little cane, and putting on that look of radiant idiocy, “I've an\r\nabsolute mania for everything that's form, don't y' know.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV--THAT GAS COMPANY INJUNCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUNG MORTON was president of Mulberry Traction. When the franchise\r\ncame sound and safe into the hands of Mulberry, young Morton evolved a\r\nconstruction company and caused himself to be made president and manager\r\nthereof. These affairs cleared up, he went upon the building of his road\r\nwith all imaginable spirit. He was still that kid-gloved, eve-glassed\r\nexquisite of other hours, but those who dealt with him in his\r\nroad-building knew in him a hawk to see and a lion to act in what he\r\nwent about. Big Kennedy was never weary of his name, and glowed at its\r\nmerest mention.\r\n\r\n“He's no show-case proposition!” cried Big Kennedy exultantly. “To look\r\nat him, folks might take him for a fool. They'd bring him back, you bet!\r\nif they did. You've got to see a party in action before you can tell\r\nabout him. A mudscow will drift as fast as an eight-oared shell; it's\r\nonly when you set 'em to goin' endwise, an' give 'em a motive, you begin\r\nto get onto th' difference.”\r\n\r\nOne day young Morton told me how the Gas Company had lodged suit against\r\nMulberry.\r\n\r\n“They've gotten a beastly injunction, they have, really!” said he.\r\n“They say we're digging, don't y' know, among their pipes and mains. The\r\nhearing is put down for one week from to-day.”\r\n\r\n“The Gas Company goes vastly out of its way in this!” observed the\r\nreputable old gentleman indignantly.\r\n\r\nHe had arrived in company with young Morton. When now the franchise was\r\nobtained, and those more devious steps for Mulberry advancement had been\r\ntaken, the reputable old gentleman began to feel a vigorous interest in\r\nhis son's enterprise. The reputable old gentleman had grown proud of his\r\nson, and it should be conceded that young Morton justified the paternal\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n“Let us go over to Tammany Hall,” said I, “and talk with Big Kennedy.”\r\n\r\nWe found Big Kennedy in cheerful converse with the Reverend Bronson,\r\nover the latter's Five Points Mission. He and the dominie were near Big\r\nKennedy's desk; in a far corner lolled a drunken creature, tattered,\r\nunshorn, disreputable, asleep and snoring in his chair. As I entered the\r\nroom, accompanied by the reputable old gentleman and young Morton, Big\r\nKennedy was giving the Reverend Bronson certain hearty assurances of his\r\ngood will.\r\n\r\n“I'll see to it to-day,” Big Kennedy was saying. “You go back an' deal\r\nyour game. I'll have two cops detailed to every meetin', d'ye see, an'\r\ntheir orders will be to break their night-sticks over th' head of th'\r\nfirst duck that laughs or makes a row. You always come to me for what\r\nyou want; you can hock your socks I'll back you up. What this town needs\r\nis religious teachin' of an elevated kind, an' no bunch of Bowery bums\r\nis goin' to give them exercises th' smother. An' that goes!”\r\n\r\n“I'm sure I'm much obliged,” murmured the Reverend Bronson, preparing to\r\ntake himself away. Then, turning curious: “May I ask who that lost and\r\nabandoned man is?” and he indicated the drunkard, snoring in his chair.\r\n\r\n“You don't know him,” returned Big Kennedy, in a tone of confident,\r\nfriendly patronage. “Just now he's steeped in bug juice to th' eyes,\r\nan' has been for a week. But I'm goin' to need him; so I had him brought\r\nin.”\r\n\r\n“Of what earthly use can one who has fallen so low be put to?” asked the\r\nReverend Bronson. Then, with a shudder: “Look at him!”\r\n\r\n“An' that's where you go wrong!” replied Big Kennedy, who was in one of\r\nhis philosophical humors. “Now if it was about morals, or virtue, or th'\r\nhereafter, I wouldn't hand you out a word. That's your game, d'ye see,\r\nan' when it's a question of heaven, you've got me beat. But there's\r\nother games, like Tammany Hall for instance, where I could give you\r\ncards an' spades. Now take that sot there: I know what he can do, an'\r\nwhat I want him for, an' inside of a week I'll be makin' him as useful\r\nas a corkscrew in Kentucky.”\r\n\r\n“He seems a most unpromising foundation upon which to build one's hope,”\r\n said the Reverend Bronson dubiously.\r\n\r\n“He aint much to look at, for fair!” responded Big Kennedy, in his large\r\ntolerant way. “But you mustn't bet your big stack on a party's looks.\r\nYou can't tell about a steamboat by th' coat of paint on her sides;\r\nyou must go aboard. Now that fellow”--here he pointed to the sleeping\r\ndrunkard--“once you get th' booze out of him, has a brain like a\r\nbuzzsaw. An' you should hear him talk! He's got a tongue so acid it\r\nwould eat through iron. The fact is, th' difference between that soak\r\nan' th' best lawyer at the New York bar is less'n one hundred dollars.\r\nI'll have him packed off to a Turkish bath, sweat th' whisky out of him,\r\nhave him shaved an' his hair cut, an' get him a new suit of clothes.\r\nWhen I'm through, you won't know him. He'll run sober for a month, which\r\nis as long as I'll need him this trip.”\r\n\r\n“And will he then return to his drunkenness?” asked the Reverend\r\nBronson.\r\n\r\n“Sure as you're alive!” said Big Kennedy. “The moment I take my hooks\r\noff him, down he goes.”\r\n\r\n“What you say interests me! Why not send him to my mission, and let me\r\ncompass his reform.”\r\n\r\n“You might as well go down to th' morgue an' try an' revive th' dead.\r\nNo, no, Doctor; that duck is out of humanity's reach. If you took him in\r\nhand at your mission, he'd show up loaded some night an' tip over your\r\nworks. Better pass him up.”\r\n\r\n“If his case is so hopeless, I marvel that you tolerate him.”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Bronson was a trifle piqued at Big Kennedy for thinking his\r\ninfluence would fall short of the drunkard's reform.\r\n\r\n“You aint onto this business of bein' Chief of Tammany,” responded Big\r\nKennedy, with his customary grin. “I always like to do my work through\r\nthese incurables. It's better to have men about you who are handicapped\r\nby some big weakness, d'ye see! They're strong on th' day you need 'em,\r\nan' weak when you lay 'em down. Which makes it all the better. If\r\nthese people were strong all th' year 'round, one of 'em, before we got\r\nthrough, would want my job, an' begin to lay pipes to get it. Some time,\r\nwhen I wasn't watchin', he might land th' trick at that. No, as hands to\r\ndo my work, give me fellows who've got a loose screw in their machinery.\r\nThey're less chesty; an' then they work better, an' they're safer.\r\nI've only one man near me who don't show a blemish. That's him,” and he\r\npointed to where I sat waiting with young Morton and the reputable old\r\ngentleman. “I'll trust him; because I'm goin' to make him Boss when I\r\nget through; an' he knows it. That leaves him without any reason for\r\ndoin' me up.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy called one of his underlings, and gave him directions to\r\nhave the sleeping drunkard conveyed instantly to a bath-house.\r\n\r\n“Get th' kinks out of him,” said he; “an' bring him back to me in four\r\ndays. I want to see him as straight as a string, an' dressed as though\r\nfor a weddin'. I'm goin' to need him to make a speech, d'ye see! at that\r\nmugwump ratification meetin' in Cooper Union.”\r\n\r\nWhen the Reverend Bronson, and the drunken Cicero, in care of his\r\nkeeper, had gone their several ways, Big Kennedy wheeled upon us. He was\r\nbriefly informed of the troubles of Mulberry Traction.\r\n\r\n“If them gas crooks don't hold hard,” said he, when young Morton had\r\nfinished, “we'll have an amendment to th' city charter passed at\r\nAlbany, puttin' their meters under th' thumb an' th' eye of th' Board of\r\nLightin' an' Supplies. I wonder how they'd like that! It would cut sixty\r\nper cent, off their gas bills. However, mebby th' Gas Company's buttin'\r\ninto this thing in th' dark. What judge does the injunction come up\r\nbefore?”\r\n\r\n“Judge Mole,” said young Morton.\r\n\r\n“Mole, eh?” returned Big Kennedy thoughtfully. “We'll shift th' case\r\nto some other judge. Mole won't do; he's th' Gas Company's judge, d'ye\r\nsee.”\r\n\r\n“The Gas Company's judge!” exclaimed the reputable old gentleman, in\r\nhorrified amazement.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy, at this, shone down upon the reputable old gentleman like a\r\nbenignant sun.\r\n\r\n“Slowly but surely,” said he, “you begin to tumble to th' day an'\r\nth' town you're livin' in. Don't you know that every one of our giant\r\ncompanies has its own judge? Why! one of them Captains of Industry, as\r\nth' papers call 'em, would no more be without his judge than without his\r\nstenographer.”\r\n\r\n“In what manner,” snorted the reputable old gentleman, “does one of our\r\ngreat corporations become possessed of a judge?”\r\n\r\n“Simple as sloppin' out champagne!” returned Big Kennedy. “It asks us to\r\nnominate him. Then it comes up with his assessment, d'ye see!--an' I've\r\nknown that to run as high as one hundred thousand--an' then every year\r\nit contributes to our various campaigns, say fifty thousand dollars a\r\nwhirl. Oh! it comes high to have your own private judge; but if you're\r\nsettin' into a game of commerce where th' limit's higher than a cat's\r\nback, it's worth a wise guy's while.”\r\n\r\n“Come, come!” interposed young Morton, “we've no time for moral and\r\npolitical abstractions, don't y' know! Let's get back to Mulberry\r\nTraction. You say Judge Mole won't do. Can you have the case set down\r\nbefore another judge?”\r\n\r\n“Easy money!” said Big Kennedy. “I'll have Mole send it over to Judge\r\nFlyinfox. He'll knock it on th' head, when it comes up, an' that's th'\r\nlast we'll ever hear of that injunction.”\r\n\r\n“You speak of Judge Flyinfox with confidence,” observed the reputable\r\nold gentleman, breaking in. “Why are you so certain he will dismiss the\r\napplication for an injunction?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” retorted Big Kennedy, in his hardy way, “he comes up for\r\nrenomination within two months. He'd look well throwin' the harpoon into\r\nme right now, wouldn't he?” Then, as the double emotions of wrath and\r\nwonder began to make purple the visage of the reputable old gentleman:\r\n“Look here: you're more'n seven years old. Why should you think a judge\r\nwas different from other men? Haven't you seen men crawl in th' sewer\r\nof politics on their hands an' knees, an' care for nothin' only so they\r\ncrawled finally into th' Capitol at Albany? Is a judge any better than\r\na governor? Or is either of 'em any better than other people? While\r\nTammany makes th' judges, do you s'ppose they'll be too good for th'\r\norganization? That last would be a cunnin' play to make!”\r\n\r\n“But these judges,” said the reputable old gentleman. “Their terms are\r\nso long and their salaries so large, I should think they would defy you\r\nand your humiliating orders.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” returned Big Kennedy, with the pleasant air of one aware of\r\nhimself, “an' that long term an' big salary works square th' other way.\r\nThere's so many of them judges that there's one or two to be re-elected\r\neach year. So we've always got a judge whose term is on th' blink, d'ye\r\nsee! An' he's got to come to us--to me, if you want it plain--to get\r\nback. You spoke of th' big salary an' th' long term. Don't you see that\r\nyou've only given them guys more to lose? Now th' more a party has to\r\nlose, th' more he'll bow and scrape to save himself. Between us, a judge\r\nwithin a year or so of renomination is th' softest mark on th' list.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman expressed unbounded indignation, while Big\r\nKennedy laughed.\r\n\r\n“What're you kickin' about?” asked Big Kennedy, when he had somewhat\r\nrecovered. “That's the 'Boss System.' Just now, d'ye see! it's water\r\non your wheel, so you oughtn't to raise th' yell. But to come back\r\nto Mulberry Traction: We'll have Mole send th' case to Flyinfox; an'\r\nFlyinfox will put th' kybosh on it, if it comes up. But I'll let you\r\ninto a secret. Th' case'll never come up; th' Gas Company will go back\r\nto its corner.”\r\n\r\n“Explain,” said young Morton eagerly.\r\n\r\n“Because I'll tell 'em to.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that you'll go to the Gas Company,” sneered the reputable\r\nold gentleman, “and give its officers orders the same as you say you\r\ngive them to the State's and the City's officers?”\r\n\r\n“Th' Gas Company'll come to me, an' ask for orders.”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman drew a long breath, while his brows worked\r\nup and down.\r\n\r\n“And dare you tell me,” he cried, “that men of millions--our leading men\r\nof business, will come to you and ask your commands?”\r\n\r\n“My friend,” replied Big Kennedy gravely, “no matter how puffed up an'\r\nbig these leadin' men of business get to be, th' Chief of Tammany is a\r\nbigger toad than any. Listen: th' bigger the target th' easier th' shot.\r\nIf you'll come down here with me for a month, I'll gamble you'll meet\r\nan' make th' acquaintance of every business king in th' country. An'\r\nyou'll notice, too, that they'll take off their hats, an' listen to what\r\nI say; an' in th' end, they'll do what I tell 'em to do.” Big Kennedy\r\nglowered impressively upon the reputable old gentleman. “That sounds\r\nlike a song that is sung, don't it?” Then turning to me: “Tell th'\r\nStreet Department not to give th' Gas Company any more permits to open\r\nstreets until further orders. An' now”--coming back to the reputable old\r\ngentleman--“can't you see what'll come off?”\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman looked mystified. Young Morton, for his\r\npart, began to smile.\r\n\r\n“He sees!” exclaimed Big Kennedy, pointing to young Morton. “Here's\r\nwhat'll happen. Th' Gas Company has to have two hundred permits a day to\r\ntear open th' streets. After that order reaches the Street Commissioner,\r\nit won't get any.”\r\n\r\n“'Better see the Boss,' the Street Commissioner will whisper, when the\r\nGas Company asks what's wrong.\r\n\r\n“The next day one of th' deck hands will come to see me. I'll turn him\r\ndown; th' Chief of Tammany don't deal with deck hands. The next day th'\r\nGas Company will send th' first mate. The mate'll get turned down; th'\r\nChief of Tammany deals with nobody less'n a captain, d'ye see! On th'\r\nthird day, or to put it like a prophet, say next Friday--since this\r\nis Tuesday--th' president of th' Gas Company will drive here in his\r\nbrougham. I'll let him wait ten minutes in the outer room to take the\r\nswell out of his head. Then I'll let him in, an', givin' him th' icy\r\neye, I'll ask: 'What's th' row?' Th' Gas Company will have been three\r\ndays without permits to open th' streets;--its business will be at a\r\nstandstill;--th' Gas Company'll be sweatin' blood. There'll be th' Gas\r\nCompany's president, an' here'll be Big John Kennedy. I think that even\r\nyou can furnish th' wind-up. As I tell you, now that I've had time to\r\nthink it out, th' case will be withdrawn. Still, to make sure, we'll\r\nhave Mole send th' papers over to Flyinfox, just as though we had\r\nnowhere except th' courts to look for justice.”\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the day before the case was to have been called, the Gas\r\nCompany, humbled and made penitent with a stern paucity of “permits,”\r\n dismissed its petition for an injunction against Mulberry Traction, and\r\nyoung Morton returned to his career, unchecked of a court's decree.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said young Morton, as we came from our interview with Big\r\nKennedy, “I'm not sure that the so-called Boss System for the Government\r\nof Cities is wholly without its advantages, don't y' know!” And here\r\nyoung Morton puffed a complacent, not to say superior, cigarette.\r\n\r\n“Humph!” retorted the reputable old gentleman angrily. “Every Esau,\r\nselling his birthright for a mess of pottage, would speak the same.”\r\n\r\n“Esau with a cigarette--really!” murmured young Morton, giving a\r\nruminative puff. “But I say, father, it isn't a mess of pottage, don't\r\ny' know, it's a street railway.”\r\n\r\nAs Mulberry Traction approached completion, the common stock reached\r\nforty. At that point Big Kennedy closed out his interest. Snapping the\r\ncatchlock behind us, to the end that we be alone, he tossed a dropsical\r\ngray envelope on the table.\r\n\r\n“There's two hundred thousand dollars' worth of Uncle Sam's bonds,” said\r\nhe. “That's your end of Mulberry Traction.”\r\n\r\n“You've sold out?”\r\n\r\n“Sold out an' got one million two hundred thousand.”\r\n\r\n“The stock would have gone higher,” said I. “You would have gotten more\r\nif you'd held on.”\r\n\r\n“Wall Street,” returned Big Kennedy, with a cautious shake of the head,\r\n“is off my beat. I'm afraid of them stock sharps; I feel like a come-on\r\nth' minute I begin to talk with one, an' I wouldn't trust 'em as far as\r\nI could throw a dog by th' tail. I break away as fast as ever I can, an'\r\nchase back to Fourteenth Street, where I'm wise to th' game. I've seen\r\nsuckers like me who took a million dollars into Wall Street, an'\r\ncame out in a week with nothin' but a pocket full of canceled postage\r\nstamps.”\r\n\r\n“I've been told,” said I with a laugh, and going with Big Kennedy's\r\nhumor, “that two hundred years ago, Captain Kidd, the pirate, had his\r\nhome on the site of the present Stock Exchange.”\r\n\r\n“Did he?” said Big Kennedy. “Well, I figger that his crew must\r\nhave lived up an' down both sides of the street from him, an' their\r\ndescendants are still holdin' down th' property. An' to think,” mused\r\nBig Kennedy, “that Trinity Church stares down th' length of Wall Street,\r\nwith th' graves in th' Trinity churchyard to remind them stock wolves of\r\nth' finish! I'm a hard man, an' I play a hard game, but on th' level!\r\nif I was as big a robber as them Wall Street sharps, I couldn't look\r\nTrinity Church in th' face!” Then, coming back to Mulberry Traction and\r\nto me: “I've put it in bonds, d'ye see! Now if I was you, I'd stand pat\r\non 'em just as they are. Lay 'em away, an' think to yourself they're for\r\nthat little Blossom of yours.”\r\n\r\nAt the name of Blossom, Big Kennedy laid his heavy hand on mine as might\r\none who asked a favor. It was the thing unusual. Big Kennedy's rough\r\nhusk gave scanty promise of any softness of sentiment to lie beneath.\r\nSomehow, the word and the hand brought the water to my eyes.'\r\n\r\n“It is precisely what I mean to do,” said I. “Blossom is to have it, an'\r\nhave it as it is--two hundred thousand dollars in bonds.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy, with that, gave my hand a Titan's grip in indorsement of my\r\nresolve.\r\n\r\nBlossom was growing up a frail, slender child, and still with her\r\nfrightened eyes. Anne watched over her; and since Blossom lacked in\r\nsturdiness of health, she did not go to a school, but was taught by\r\nAnne at home. Blossom's love was for me; she clung to me when I left the\r\nhouse, and was in my arms the moment the door opened upon my return. She\r\nwas the picture of my lost Apple Cheek, wanting her roundness, and my\r\neyes went wet and weary with much looking upon her.\r\n\r\nMy home was quiet and, for me, gloomy. Anne, I think, was happy in a\r\nmanner pensive and undemonstrative. As for Blossom, that terror she drew\r\nin from her mother when the latter was struck by the blow of my arrest\r\nfor the death of Jimmy the Blacksmith, still held its black dominion\r\nover her fancy; and while with time she grew away from those agitations\r\nand hysterias which enthralled her babyhood, she lived ever in a\r\ntwilight of melancholy that nothing could light up, and from which her\r\nspirit never emerged. In all her life I never heard her laugh, and her\r\nsmile, when she did smile, was as the soul of a sigh. And so my house\r\nwas a house of whispers and shadows and silences as sad as death--a\r\nhouse of sorrow for my lost Apple Cheek, and fear for Blossom whose life\r\nwas stained with nameless mourning before ever she began to live at all.\r\n\r\nNext door to me I had brought my father and mother to dwell. Anne, who\r\nabode with me, could oversee both houses. The attitude of Big Kennedy\r\ntowards Old Mike had not been wanting in effect upon me. The moment my\r\nmoney was enough, I took my father from his forge, and set both him and\r\nmy mother to a life of workless ease. I have feared more than once that\r\nthis move was one not altogether wise. My people had been used to labor,\r\nand when it was taken out of their hands they knew not where to turn\r\nwith their time. They were much looked up to by neighbors for the power\r\nand position I held in the town's affairs; and each Sunday they could\r\ngive the church a gold piece, and that proved a mighty boon to their\r\npride. But, on the whole, the leisure of their lives, and they unable\r\nto employ it, carked and corroded them, and it had not a little to do in\r\nbreaking down their health. They were in no sense fallen into the vale\r\nof years, when one day they were seized by a pneumonia and--my mother\r\nfirst, with her patient peasant face! and my father within the week that\r\nfollowed--passed both to the other life.\r\n\r\nAnd now when I was left with only Blossom and Anne to love, and to be\r\ndear and near to me, I went the more among men, and filled still more\r\nmy head and hands and heart with politics. I must have action, motion.\r\nGrief walked behind me; and, let me but halt, it was never long in\r\ncoming up.\r\n\r\nSundry years slipped by, and the common routine work of the organization\r\nengaged utterly both Big Kennedy and myself. We struggled heartily, and\r\nhad our ups and our downs, our years of black and our years of white.\r\nThe storm that wrecked Big Kennedy's predecessor had left Tammany in\r\nshallow, dangerous waters for its sailing. Also Big Kennedy and I were\r\nnot without our personal enemies. We made fair weather of it, however,\r\nparticularly when one considers the broken condition of Tammany, and the\r\ndays were not desolate of their rewards.\r\n\r\nNow ensues a great heave upward in my destinies.\r\n\r\nOne evening I came upon Big Kennedy, face gray and drawn, sitting as\r\nstill as a church. Something in the look or the attitude went through me\r\nlike a lance.\r\n\r\n“What's wrong?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“There was a saw-bones here,” said he, “pawin' me over for a\r\nlife-insurance game that I thought I'd buy chips in. He tells me my\r\nlight's goin' to flicker out inside a year. That's a nice number to\r\nhand a man! Just as a sport finds himself on easy street, along comes\r\na scientist an' tells him it's all off an' nothin' for it but the\r\nbone-yard! Well,” concluded Big Kennedy, grimly lighting a cigar, “if\r\nit's up to me, I s'ppose I can hold down a hearse as good as th' next\r\none. If it's th' best they can do, why, let her roll!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI--THE BOSS IS DEAD; LONG LIVE THE BOSS!\r\n\r\n\r\nBIG KENNEDY could not live a year; his doom was written. It was the\r\nword hard to hear, and harder to believe, of one who, broad, burly,\r\nruddy with the full color of manhood at its prime, seemed in the very\r\nfeather of his strength. And for all that, his hour was on its way.\r\nDeath had gained a lodgment in his heart, and was only pausing to\r\nstrengthen its foothold before striking the blow. I sought to cheer him\r\nwith the probability of mistake on the side of ones who had given him\r\nthis dark warning of his case.\r\n\r\n“That's all right,” responded Big Kennedy in a tone of dogged dejection;\r\n“I'm up ag'inst it just th' same. It didn't need th' doctor to put me\r\non. More'n once I've felt my heart slip a cog. I shall clean up an'\r\nquit. They say if I pull out an' rest, I may hang on for a year. That's\r\nth' tip I've got, an' I'm goin' to take it. I'm two millions to th'\r\ngood, an' when all is done, why, that's enough.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy declared for a vacation; the public announcement went for\r\nit that he would rest. I was to take control as a fashion of Boss by\r\nbrevet.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said Big Kennedy when we talked privately of the situation,\r\n“you understand. I'm down an' out, done for an' as good as dead right\r\nnow. But it's better to frame th' play as I've proposed. Don't change\r\nth' sign over th' door for a month or two; it'll give you time to\r\nstiffen your grip. There's dubs who would like th' job, d'ye see, an' if\r\nthey found an openin' they'd spill you out of th' place like a pup out\r\nof a basket. It's for you to get your hooks on th' levers, an' be in\r\ncontrol of th' machine before I die.” Then, with a ghastly smile: “An'\r\nseein' it's you, I'll put off croakin! till th' last call of th' board.”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy, seeking that quiet which had been the physician's\r\nprescription, went away. When, later by ten months, he came back, his\r\nappearance was a shock to me. The great, bluff man was gone, and he who\r\nfeebly took me by the hand seemed no more than a weak shadow of that\r\nBig John Kennedy whom I had followed. The mere looks of him were like a\r\nknife-stab. He stayed but a day, and then returned to his retreat in the\r\nsilent hills. Within a month Big Kennedy was dead.\r\n\r\n“You've got things nailed,” said he, on the last evening, “an' I'm glad\r\nit's so. Now let me give you a few points; they may help you to hold\r\ndown your place as Boss. You're too hungry for revenge; there's your\r\nweakness. The revenge habit is worse than a taste for whisky. Th' best\r\nyou can say for it is it's a waste of time. When you've downed a man,\r\nstop. To go on beatin' him is like throwin' water on a drowned rat.\r\n\r\n“When it comes to handin' out th' offices an' th' contracts, don't play\r\nfav'rites. Hand every man what's comin' to him by th' rules of th' game.\r\nIt'll give you more power to have men say you'll do what's square, than\r\nthat you'll stick by your friends. Good men--dead-game men, don't want\r\nfavors; they want justice.\r\n\r\n“Never give a man the wrong office; size every man up, an' measure him\r\nfor his place th' same as a tailor does for a suit of clothes. If you\r\ngive a big man a little office, you make an enemy; if you give a little\r\nman a big office, you make trouble.\r\n\r\n“Flatter th' mugwumps. Of course, their belfry is full of bats; but\r\nabout half th' time they have to be your pals, d'ye see, in order to be\r\nmugwumps. An' you needn't be afraid of havin' 'em around; they'll never\r\nketch onto anything. A mugwump, as some wise guy said, is like a man\r\nridin' backward in a carriage; he never sees a thing until it's by.\r\n\r\n“Say 'No' nineteen times before you say 'Yes' once. People respect th'\r\nman who says 'No,' an' his 'Yes' is worth more where he passes it out.\r\nWhen you say 'No,' you play your own game; when you say 'Yes,' you're\r\nplayin' some other duck's game. 'No,' keeps; 'Yes,' gives; an' th' gent\r\nwho says 'No' most will always be th' biggest toad in his puddle.\r\n\r\n“Don't be fooled by a cheer or by a crowd. Cheers are nothin' but a\r\nbreeze; an' as for a crowd, no matter who you are, there would always be\r\na bigger turn-out to see you hanged than to shake your mit.\r\n\r\n“Always go with th' current; that's th' first rule of leadership. It's\r\neasier; an' there's more water down stream than up.\r\n\r\n“Think first, last, an' all th' time of yourself. You may not be of\r\naccount to others, but you're the whole box of tricks to yourself. Don't\r\ngive a man more than he gives you. Folks who don't stick to that steer\r\nland either in bankruptcy or Bloomin'dale.\r\n\r\n“An' remember: while you're Boss, you'll be forced into many things\r\nag'inst your judgment. The head of Tammany is like th' head of a snake,\r\nan' gets shoved forward by the tail. Also, like th' head of a snake, th'\r\nBoss is th' target for every rock that is thrown.\r\n\r\n“Have as many lieutenants as you can; twenty are safer than two. Two\r\nmight fake up a deal with each other to throw you down; twenty might\r\nstart, but before they got to you they'd fight among themselves.\r\n\r\n“Have people about you who distrust each other an' trust you. Keep th'\r\nleaders fightin' among themselves. That prevents combinations ag'inst\r\nyou; an' besides they'll do up each other whenever you say the word,\r\nwhere every man is hated by the rest.\r\n\r\n“Always pay your political debts; but pay with a jolly as far as it'll\r\ngo. If you find one who won't take a jolly, throw a scare into him and\r\npay him with that. If he's a strong, dangerous mug with whom a jolly\r\nor a bluff won't work, get him next to you as fast as you can. If you\r\nstrike an obstinate party, it's th' old rule for drivin' pigs. If you\r\nwant 'em to go forward, pull 'em back by th' tails. Never trust a man\r\nbeyond his interest; an' never love the man, love what he does.\r\n\r\n“The whole science of leadership lies in what I've told you, an' if you\r\ncan clinch onto it, you'll stick at th' top till you go away, like I do\r\nnow, to die. An' th' last of it is, don't get sentimental--don't take\r\npolitics to heart. Politics is only worth while so long as it fills your\r\npockets. Don't tie yourself to anything. A political party is like a\r\nstreet car; stay with it only while it goes your way. A great partisan\r\ncan never be a great Boss.”\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself master of Tammany, my primary thought was to be\r\ncautious. I must strengthen myself; I must give myself time to take\r\nroot. This was the more necessary, for not only were there a full score\r\nof the leaders, any one of whom would prefer himself for my place, but\r\nthe political condition was far from reassuring. The workingman--whom as\r\nsomeone said we all respect and avoid--was through his unions moving to\r\nthe town's conquest. It was as that movement of politics in the land\r\nof the ancient Nile. Having discovered a Moses, the hand-workers would\r\noffer him for the mayoralty on the issue of no more bricks without\r\nstraw.\r\n\r\nSkilled to the feel of sentiment, I could gauge both the direction\r\nand the volume of the new movement. Nor was I long in coming to the\r\nknowledge that behind it marched a majority of the people. Unless\r\nchecked, or cheated, that labor uprising would succeed; Tammany and its\r\nold-time enemies would alike go down.\r\n\r\nThis news, self-furnished as a grist ground of the mills of my own\r\njudgment, stimulated me to utmost action. It would serve neither my\r\npresent nor my future should that battle which followed my inauguration\r\nbe given against me. I was on my trial; defeat would be the signal for\r\nmy overthrow. And thus I faced my first campaign as Boss.\r\n\r\nThat rebellion of the working folk stirred to terror the conservatives,\r\never the element of wealth. Each man with a share of stock to shrink in\r\nvalue, or with a dollar loaned and therefore with security to shake, or\r\nwith a store through the plate-glass panes of which a mob might hurl\r\na stone, was prey to a vast alarm. The smug citizen of money, and of\r\nease-softened hands, grew sick as he reflected on the French Revolution;\r\nand he predicted gutters red with blood as the near or far finale\r\nshould the town's peasantry gain the day. It was then those rich ones,\r\npanic-bit, began to ask a succor of Tammany Hall. There were other\r\nsepts, but Tammany was the drilled, traditional corps of political\r\njanissaries. Wherefore, the local nobility, being threatened, fled to it\r\nfor refuge.\r\n\r\nThese gentry of white faces and frightened pocket-books came to me by\r\nones and twos and quartettes; my every day was filled with them; and\r\ntheir one prayer was for me to make a line of battle between them and\r\nthat frowning peril of the mob. To our silken worried ones, I replied\r\nnothing. I heard; but I kept myself as mute for hope or for fear as any\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was sure from the beginning that I must make an alliance with\r\nmy folk of purple. The movement they shuddered over was even more of a\r\nmenace to Tammany than it was to them. It might mean dollars to them,\r\nbut for Tammany it promised annihilation, since of every five who went\r\nwith this crusade, four were recruited from the machine.\r\n\r\nFifth Avenue, in a fever, did not realize this truth. Nor was I one to\r\nenlighten my callers. Their terror made for the machine; it could be\r\ntrained to fill the Tammany treasure chest with a fund to match those\r\nswelling fears, the reason of its contribution. I locked up my tongue;\r\nit was a best method to augment a mugwump horror which I meant should\r\nfind my resources.\r\n\r\nYoung Morton, still with his lisp, his affectations, his scented gloves,\r\nand ineffable eyeglass, although now no longer “young,” but like myself\r\nin the middle journey of his life, was among my patrician visitors.\r\nLike the others, he came to urge a peace-treaty between Tammany and the\r\nmugwumps, and he argued a future stored of fortune for both myself and\r\nthe machine, should the latter turn to be a defense for timid deer from\r\nwhom he came ambassador.\r\n\r\nTo Morton I gave particular ear. I was never to forget that loyalty\r\nwherewith he stood to me on a day of trial for the death of Jimmy the\r\nBlacksmith. If any word might move me it would be his. Adhering to a\r\nplan, however, I had as few answers for his questions as I had for those\r\nof his mates, and wrapped myself in silence like a mantle.\r\n\r\nMorton was so much his old practical self that he bade me consider a\r\ncandidate and a programme.\r\n\r\n“Let us nominate my old gentleman for mayor,” said he. “He's very old;\r\nbut he's clean and he's strong, don't y' know. Really he would draw\r\nevery vote to his name that should of right belong to us.”\r\n\r\n“That might be,” I returned; “but I may tell you, and stay within the\r\ntruth, that if your father got no more votes than should of right be\r\nhis, defeat would overtake him to the tune of thousands. Add the machine\r\nto the mugwumps, and this movement of labor still has us beaten\r\nby twenty thousand men. That being the case, why should I march\r\nTammany--and my own fortune, too--into such a trap?”\r\n\r\n“What else can you do?” asked Morton.\r\n\r\n“I can tell you what was in my mind,” said I. “It was to go with this\r\nlabor movement and control it.”\r\n\r\n“That labor fellow they've put up would make the worst of mayors.\r\nYou and Tammany would forever be taunted with the errors of his\r\nadministration. Besides, the creature's success would vulgarize the\r\ntown; it would, really!”\r\n\r\n“He is an honest man,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Honest, yes; but what of that? Honesty is the commonest trait of\r\nignorance. There should be something more than honesty, don't y' know,\r\nto make a mayor. There be games like draw poker and government where\r\nto be merely honest is not a complete equipment. Besides, think of the\r\nshock of such a term of hobnails in the City Hall. If you, with your\r\nmachine, would come in, we could elect my old gentleman over him or any\r\nother merely honest candidate whom those vulgarians could put up; we\r\ncould, really!”\r\n\r\n“Tell me how,” said I.\r\n\r\n“There would be millions of money,” lisped Morton, pausing to select a\r\ncigarette; “since Money would be swimming for dear life. All our fellows\r\nat the club are scared to death--really! One can do anything with money,\r\ndon't y' know.”\r\n\r\n“One can't stop a runaway horse with money,” I retorted; “and this labor\r\nmovement is a political runaway.”\r\n\r\n“With money we could build a wall across its course and let those idiots\r\nof politics run against it. My dear fellow, let us make a calculation.\r\nReally, how many votes should those labor animals overrun us, on the\r\nsituation's merits?”\r\n\r\n“Say twenty-five thousand.”\r\n\r\n“This then should give so experienced a hand as yourself some shade of\r\ncomfort. The Master of the Philadelphia Machine, don't y' know, is one\r\nof my railway partners. 'Old chap,' said he, when I told him of the\r\ndoings of our New York vandals, 'I'll send over to you ten thousand men,\r\nany one of whom would loot a convent. These common beggars must be put\r\ndown! The example might spread to Philadelphia.' So you see,” concluded\r\nMorton, “we would not be wanting in election material. What should ten\r\nthousand men mean?”\r\n\r\n“At the least,” said I, “they should count for forty thousand. A man\r\nvotes with a full beard; then he votes with his chin shaved; then he\r\nshaves the sides of his face and votes with a mustache; lastly he votes\r\nwith a smooth face and retires to re-grow a beard against the\r\nnext campaign. Ten thousand men should tally forty thousand votes.\r\nRegistration and all, however, would run the cost of such an enterprise\r\nto full five hundred thousand dollars.”\r\n\r\n“Money is no object,” returned Morton, covering a yawn delicately with\r\nhis slim hand, “to men who feel that their fortunes, don't y' know, and\r\nperhaps their lives, are on the cast. Bring us Tammany for this one war,\r\nand I'll guarantee three millions in the till of the machine; I\r\nwill, really! You would have to take those ten thousand recruits from\r\nPhiladelphia into your own hands, however; we Silk Stockings don't own\r\nthe finesse required to handle such a consignment of goods. Besides, if\r\nwe did, think what wretched form it would be.”\r\n\r\nTo hide what was in my thought, I made a pretense of considering the\r\nbusiness in every one of its angles. There was a minute during which\r\nneither of us spoke.\r\n\r\n“Why should I put the machine,” I asked at last, “in unnecessary peril\r\nof the law? This should be a campaign of fire. Every stick of those\r\nthree millions you speak of would go to stoke the furnaces. I will do as\r\nwell, and win more surely, with the labor people.”\r\n\r\n“But do you want to put the mob in possession?” demanded Morton,\r\nemerging a bit from his dandyisms. “I'm no purist of politics; indeed,\r\nI think I'm rather practical than otherwise, don't y' know. I am free\r\nto say, however, that I fear a worst result should those savages of a\r\ndinner-can and a dollar-a-day, succeed--really! You should think once in\r\na while, and particularly in a beastly squall like the present, of the\r\nCity itself.”\r\n\r\n“Should I?” I returned. “Now I'll let you into an organization tenet.\r\nTammany, blow high, blow low, thinks only of itself.”\r\n\r\n“You would be given half the offices, remember.”\r\n\r\n“And the Police?”\r\n\r\n“And the Police.”\r\n\r\n“Tammany couldn't keep house without the police,” said I, laughing.\r\n“You've seen enough of our housekeeping to know that.”\r\n\r\n“You may have the police, and what else you will.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, bringing the talk to a close, “I can't give you an\r\nanswer now. I must look the situation in the eyes. To be frank, I don't\r\nthink either the Tammany interest or my own runs with yours in this. I,\r\nwith my people, live at the other end of the lane.”\r\n\r\nWhile Morton and I were talking, I had come to a decision. I would name\r\nthe reputable old gentleman for mayor. He was stricken of years; but\r\nI bethought me how for that very reason he might be, when elected, the\r\neasier to deal with. But I would keep my resolve from Morton. There was\r\nno stress of hurry; the election was months away. I might see reason\r\nto change. One should ever put off his contract-making until the last.\r\nBesides, Morton would feel the better for a surprise.\r\n\r\nBefore I went to an open alliance with the mugwumps, I would weaken the\r\nlabor people. This I might do by pretending to be their friend.\r\nThere was a strip of the labor candidate's support which was rabid\r\nanti-Tammany. Let me but seem to come to his comfort and aid, and every\r\none of those would desert him.\r\n\r\nWithin the week after my talk with Morton, I sent a sly scrap of news\r\nto the captains of labor. They were told that I had given utterance\r\nto sentiments of friendship for them and their man. Their taste to\r\ncultivate my support was set on edge. These amateurs of politics came\r\nseeking an interview. I flattered their hopes, and spoke in high terms\r\nof their candidate, his worth and honesty. The city could not be in\r\nsafer hands.\r\n\r\nThere were many interviews. It was as an experience, not without a side\r\nto amuse, since my visitors, while as pompous as turkey cocks, were as\r\ninnocently shallow as so many sheep. Many times did we talk; and I gave\r\nthem compliments and no promises.\r\n\r\nMy ends were attained. The papers filled up with the coming partnership\r\nbetween the labor movement and the machine, and those berserks of\r\nanti-Tammany, frothing with resentment against ones who would sell\r\nthemselves into my power as the price of my support, abandoned the\r\nlaborites in a body. There were no fewer than five thousand of these to\r\nshake the dust of labor from their feet. When I had driven the last of\r\nthem from the labor champion, by the simple expedient of appearing to be\r\nhis friend, I turned decisively my back on him. Also, I at once called\r\nTammany Convention--being the first in the field--and issued those\r\norders which named the reputable old gentleman.\r\n\r\nThere arose a roar and a cheer from my followers at this, for they read\r\nin that name a promise of money knee-deep; and what, than that word,\r\nshould more brighten a Tammany eye! I was first, with the machine at\r\nmy back, to walk upon the field with our reputable old gentleman. The\r\nmugwumps followed, adopting him with all dispatch; the Republicans,\r\nproper, made no ticket; two or three straggling cliques and split-offs\r\nof party accepted the reputable old gentleman's nomination; and so the\r\nlines were made. On the heels of the conventions, the mugwump leaders\r\nand I met and merged our tickets, I getting two-thirds and surrendering\r\none-third of those names which followed that of the reputable old\r\ngentleman for the divers offices to be filled.\r\n\r\nWhen all was accomplished, the new situation offered a broad foundation,\r\nand one of solvency and depth, whereon to base a future for both Tammany\r\nand myself. It crystallized my power, and my grip on the machine was set\r\nfast and hard by the sheer effect of it. The next thing was to win at\r\nthe polls; that would ask for studied effort and a quickness that must\r\nnot sleep, for the opposition, while clumsy, straggling, and unwieldly\r\nwith no skill, overtopped us in strength by every one of those thousands\r\nof which I had given Morton the name.\r\n\r\n“Really, you meant it should be a surprise,” observed Morton, as he\r\ngrasped my hand. It was the evening of the day on which the Tammany\r\nConvention named the reputable old gentleman. “I'll plead guilty; it\r\nwas a surprise. And that's saying a great deal, don't y' know. To be\r\nsurprised is bad form, and naturally I guard myself against such a\r\nvulgar calamity. But you had me, old chap! I was never more baffled\r\nand beaten than when I left you. I regarded the conquest of the City by\r\nthose barbarians as the thing made sure. Now all is changed. We will go\r\nin and win; and not a word I said, don't y' know, shall be forgotten and\r\nevery dollar I mentioned shall be laid down. It shall, 'pon honor!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII--THE REPUTABLE OLD GENTLEMAN IS MAYOR\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE Philadelphia machine was a training school for repeaters. Those\r\nten thousand sent to our cause by Morton's friend, went about their work\r\nlike artillerymen about their guns. Each was good for four votes. As one\r\nof the squad captains said:\r\n\r\n“There's got to be time between, for a party to change his face an'\r\nshift to another coat an' hat. Besides, it's as well to give th' judges\r\nan hour or two to get dim to your mug, see!”\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy had set his foot upon the gang spirit, and stamped out of\r\nexistence such coteries as the Tin Whistles and the Alley Gang, and I\r\ncopied Big Kennedy in this. Such organizations would have been a threat\r\nto me, and put it more in reach of individual leaders to rebel against\r\nan order. What work had been done by the gangs was now, under a better\r\ndiscipline and with machine lines more tightly drawn, transacted by the\r\npolice.\r\n\r\nWhen those skillful gentry, meant to multiply a ballot-total, came in\r\nfrom the South, I called my Chief of Police into council. He was that\r\nsame bluff girthy personage who, aforetime, had conferred with Big\r\nKennedy. I told him what was required, and how his men, should occasion\r\narise, must foster as far as lay with them the voting purposes of our\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\n“You can rely on me, Gov'nor,” said the Chief. He had invented this\r\ntitle for Big Kennedy, and now transferred it to me. “Yes, indeed, you\r\ncan go to sleep on me doin' my part. But I'm bothered to a standstill\r\nwith my captains. Durin' th' last four or five years, th' force has\r\nbecome honeycombed with honesty; an', may I be struck! if some of them\r\nsquare guys aint got to be captains.”\r\n\r\n“Should any get in your way,” said I, “he must be sent to the outskirts.\r\nI shall hold you for everything that goes wrong.”\r\n\r\n“I guess,” said the Chief thoughtfully, “I'll put the whole racket in\r\ncharge of Gothecore. He'll keep your emigrants from Philadelphia walkin'\r\na crack. They'll be right, while Gothecore's got his peeps on 'em.”\r\n\r\n“Has Gothecore had experience?”\r\n\r\n“Is Bill Gothecore wise? Gov'nor, I don't want to paint a promise so\r\nbrilliant I can't make good, but Gothecore is th' most thorough workman\r\non our list. Why, they call him 'Clean Sweep Bill!' I put him in th'\r\nTenderloin for six months, an' he got away with everything but th' back\r\nfence.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said I, “the care of these colonists is in your hands.\r\nHere's a list of the places where they're berthed.”\r\n\r\n“You needn't give 'em another thought, Gov'nor,” observed the Chief.\r\nThen, as he arose to depart: “Somethin's got to be done about them\r\ncaptains turnin' square. They act as a scare to th' others. I'll tell\r\nyou what: Make the price of a captaincy twenty thousand dollars. That'll\r\nbe a hurdle no honest man can take. Whoever pays it, we can bet on as a\r\nmember of our tribe. One honest captain queers a whole force; it's like\r\na horse goin' lame.” This last, moodily.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh hour, by our suggestion and at our cost, the Republican\r\nmanagers put up a ticket. This was made necessary by certain inveterate\r\nones who would unite with nothing in which Tammany owned a part. As\r\nbetween us and the labor forces, they would have offered themselves to\r\nthe latter. They must be given a ticket of their own whereon to waste\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe campaign itself was a whirlwind of money. That princely fund\r\npromised by Morton was paid down to me on the nail, and I did not stint\r\nor save it when a chance opened to advance our power by its employment.\r\nI say “I did not stint,” because, in accord with Tammany custom, the\r\nfund was wholly in my hands.\r\n\r\nAs most men know, there is no such post as that of Chief of Tammany\r\nHall. The office is by coinage, and the title by conference, of the\r\npublic. There exists a finance committee of, commonly, a dozen names. It\r\nnever meets, and the members in ordinary are 'to hear and know no\r\nmore about the money of the organization than of sheep-washing among\r\nEttrick's hills and vales. There is a chairman; into his hands all\r\nmoneys come. These, in his care and name, and where and how and if he\r\nchooses, are put in bank. He keeps no books; he neither gives nor\r\ntakes a scrap of paper, nor so much as writes a letter of thanks, in\r\nconnection with such treasurership. He replies to no one for this\r\nmoney; he spends or keeps as he sees fit, and from beginning to end has\r\nthe sole and only knowledge of either the intake or the outgo of the\r\nmillions of the machine. The funds are wholly in his possession. To\r\nborrow a colloquialism, “He is the Man with the Money,” and since money\r\nis the mainspring of practical politics, it follows as the tail the\r\nkite, and without the intervention of either rule or statute, that he\r\nis The Boss. Being supreme with the money, he is supreme with the men of\r\nthe machine, and it was the holding of this chairmanship which gave me\r\nmy style and place as Chief.\r\n\r\nThe position is not wanting in its rewards. Tammany, for its own safety,\r\nshould come forth from each campaign without a dollar. There is no\r\nargument to carry over a residue from one battle to the next. It is not\r\nrequired, since Tammany, from those great corporations whose taxes and\r\nliberties it may extend or shrink by a word, may ever have what money\r\nit will; and it is not wise, because the existence of a fund between\r\ncampaigns would excite dissension, as this leader or that one conceived\r\nsome plan for its dissipation. It is better to upturn the till on the\r\nback of each election, and empty it in favor of organization peace. And\r\nto do this is the duty of the Chairman of the Finance Committee; and I\r\nmay add that it is one he was never known to overlook.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing notable in that struggle which sent the reputable old\r\ngentleman to the city fore as Mayor, beyond the energy wherewith the\r\nwork required was performed. Every move ran off as softly sure as could\r\nbe wished. The police did what they should. Those visitors from below\r\nturned in for us full forty thousand votes, and then quietly received\r\ntheir wages and as quietly went their way. I saw to it that, one and\r\nall, they were sharply aboard the ferryboats when their work was done.\r\nNo one would care for them, drunken and mayhap garrulous, about the\r\nstreets, until after the last spark of election interest had expired.\r\nThe polls were closed: the count was made; the laborites and their Moses\r\nwas beaten down, and the reputable old gentleman was declared victor by\r\nfifteen thousand. Those rich ones, late so pale, revived the color in\r\ntheir cheeks; and as for Tammany and myself, we took deep breaths, and\r\nfelt as ones from whose shoulders a load had been lifted.\r\n\r\nIt was for me a fortunate upcome; following that victory, my leadership\r\ncould no more be shaken than may the full-grown oaks. Feeling now my\r\nstrength, I made divers machine changes of the inner sort. I caused my\r\nexecutive leaders to be taken from the assembly districts, rather than\r\nfrom the wards. There would be one from each; and since there was\r\na greater number of districts than wards, the executive array was\r\nincreased. I smelled safety for myself in numbers, feeling, as Big\r\nKennedy advised, the more secure with twenty than with two. Also the new\r\nsituation gave the leaders less influence with the Aldermen, when now\r\nthe frontiers of the one no longer matched those of the other. I had\r\naimed at this; for it was my instant effort on becoming Chief to collect\r\nwithin my own fingers every last thread of possible authority. I wanted\r\nthe voice of my leadership to be the voice of the storm; all others I\r\nwould stifle to a whisper.\r\n\r\nWhile busy within the organization, deepening and broadening the\r\nchannels of my power, I did not neglect conditions beyond the walls.\r\nI sent for the leaders of those two or three bands of Democracy which\r\nprofessed themselves opposed to Tammany Hall. I pitched upon my men as\r\nlumber folk in their log-driving pitch upon the key-logs in a “jam.” I\r\nloosened them with office, or the promise of it, and they instantly came\r\nriding down to me on the currents of self-interest, and brought with\r\nthem those others over whom they held command.\r\n\r\nWithin the twelvemonth Tammany was left no rival within the lines of the\r\nregular party; I had, either by purring or by purchase, brought about\r\nthe last one's disappearance. It was a fair work for the machine, and I\r\ncould feel the gathering, swelling confidence of my followers uplifting\r\nme as the deep sea uplifts a ship.\r\n\r\nThere was a thorn with that rose of leadership, nor did my hand escape\r\nits sting. The papers in their attacks upon me were as incessant as they\r\nwere vindictive, and as unsparing as they were unfair. With never a fact\r\nset forth, by the word of these unmuzzled and uncaring imprints I stood\r\nforth as everything that was thievish, vile, and swart.\r\n\r\nWhile I made my skin as thick against these shafts as I could, since I\r\nmight neither avoid nor return them, still they pierced me and kept me\r\nbleeding, and each new day saw ever a new wound to my sensibilities. It\r\nis a bad business--these storms of black abuse! You have but to fasten\r\nupon one, even an honest one, the name of horse-thief and, behold you!\r\nhe will steal a horse. Moreover, those vilifications of types become\r\narrows to glance aside and bury themselves in the breasts of ones\r\ninnocent.\r\n\r\nBlossom was grown now to be a grave stripling girl of fifteen. Anne\r\nconceived that she should be taught in a school. She, herself, had\r\ncarried Blossom to a considerable place in her books, but the finishing\r\nwould be the better accomplished by teachers of a higher skill,\r\nand among children of Blossom's age. With this on her thought, Anne\r\ncompleted arrangements with a private academy for girls, one of superior\r\nrank; and to this shop of learning, on a certain morning, she conveyed\r\nBlossom. Blossom was to be fitted with a fashionable education by those\r\nmodistes of the intellectual, just as a dressmaker might measure her,\r\nand baste her, and stitch her into a frock.\r\n\r\nBut insult and acrid grief were lying there in ambush for\r\nBlossom--Blossom, then as ever, with her fear-haunted eyes. She was home\r\nbefore night, tearful, hysterical--crying in Anne's arms. There had been\r\na cartoon in the papers. It showed me as a hairy brutal ape, the city\r\nin the shape of a beautiful woman fainting in my arms, and a mighty rock\r\nlabeled “Tammany” in one hand, ready to hurl at my pursuers. The whole\r\nwas hideous; and when one of the girls of the school showed it to\r\nBlossom, and taunted her with this portrait of her father, it was more\r\nthan heart might bear. She fled before the outrage of it, and would\r\nnever hear the name of school again. This ape-picture was the thing\r\nfearful and new to Blossom, for to save her, both Anne and I had been\r\nat care to have no papers to the house. The harm was done, however;\r\nBlossom, hereafter, would shrink from all but Anne and me, and when she\r\nwas eighteen, save for us, the priest, and an old Galway serving woman\r\nwho had been her nurse, she knew no one in the whole wide world.\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman made a most amazing Major. He was puffed\r\nwith a vanity that kissed the sky. Honest, and by nature grateful, he\r\nwas still so twisted as to believe that to be a good Mayor one must\r\ncomport himself in an inhuman way.\r\n\r\n“Public office is a public trust!” cried he, quoting some lunatic\r\nabstractionist.\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman's notion of discharging this trust was\r\nto refuse admittance to his friends, while he sat in council with his\r\nenemies. To show that he was independent, he granted nothing to ones\r\nwho had builded him; to prove himself magnanimous, he went truckling to\r\nformer foes, preferring them into place. As for me, he declined every\r\nsuggestion, refused every name, and while there came no open rupture\r\nbetween us, I was quickly taught to stay away.\r\n\r\n“My luck with my father,” said Morton, when one day we were considering\r\nthat lofty spirit of the reputable old gentleman, “is no more flattering\r\nthan your own, don't y' know. He waves me away with a flourish. I\r\nreminded him that while he might forget me as one who with trowel and\r\nmortar had aided to lay the walls of his career, he at least should\r\nremember that I was none the less his son; I did, really! He retorted\r\nwith the story of the Roman father who in his rôle as judge sentenced\r\nhis son to death. Gad! he seemed to regret that no chance offered for\r\nhim to equal though he might not surpass that noble example. Speaking\r\nseriously, when his term verges to its close, what will be your course?\r\nYou know the old gentleman purposes to succeed himself. And, doubtless,\r\nsince such is mugwump thickness, he'll be renominated.”\r\n\r\n“Tammany,” said I, “will fight him. We'll have a candidate on a straight\r\nticket of our own. His honor, your father, will be beaten.”\r\n\r\n“On my soul! I hope so,” exclaimed Morton. “Don't you know, I expect\r\nevery day to find him doing something to Mulberry Traction--trying to\r\ninvalidate its franchise, or indulging in some similar piece of humor. I\r\nshall breathe easier with my parent returned to private life--really!”\r\n\r\n“Never fear; I'll have the city in the hollow of my hand within the\r\nyear,” said I.\r\n\r\n“I will show you where to find a million or two in Wall Street, if you\r\ndo,” he returned.\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the reputable old gentleman was already half\r\naccomplished. One by one, I had cut the props from beneath him. While he\r\nwould grant me no contracts, and yield me no offices for my people,\r\nhe was quite willing to consider my advice on questions of political\r\nconcern. Having advantage of this, I one day pointed out that it was\r\nun-American to permit certain Italian societies to march in celebration\r\nof their victories over the Pope long ago. Why should good Catholic\r\nIrish-Americans be insulted with such exhibitions! These Italian\r\nfestivals should be kept for Italy; they do not belong in America.\r\nThe reputable old gentleman, who was by instinct more than half a Know\r\nNothing, gave warm assent to my doctrines, and the festive Italians did\r\nnot celebrate.\r\n\r\nNext I argued that the reputable old gentleman should refuse his\r\ncountenance to the Irish exercises on St. Patrick's Day. The Irish were\r\nno better than the Italians. He could not make flesh of one and fish\r\nof the other. The reputable old gentleman bore testimony to the lucid\r\nbeauty of my argument by rebuffing the Irish in a flame of words in\r\nwhich he doubted both their intelligence and their loyalty to the land\r\nof their adoption. In another florid tirade he later sent the Orangemen\r\nto the political right-about. The one powerful tribe he omitted to\r\ninsult were the Germans, and that only because they did not come within\r\nhis reach. Had they done so, the reputable old gentleman would have\r\nheaped contumely upon them with all the pleasure in life.\r\n\r\nIt is not needed that I set forth how, while guiding the reputable old\r\ngentleman to these deeds of derring, I kept myself in the background. No\r\none knew me as the architect of those wondrous policies. The reputable\r\nold gentleman stood alone; and in the inane fullness of his vanity took\r\na deal of delight in the uproar he aroused.\r\n\r\nThere was an enemy of my own. He was one of those elegant personalities\r\nwho, in the elevation of riches and a position to which they are born,\r\nfind the name of Tammany a synonym for crime. That man hated me, and\r\nhated the machine. But he loved the reputable old gentleman; and, by his\r\nname and his money, he might become of utmost avail to that publicist in\r\nany effort he put forth to have his mayorship again.\r\n\r\nOne of the first offices of the city became vacant, that of chamberlain.\r\nI heard how the name of our eminent one would be presented for the\r\nplace. That was my cue. I instantly asked that the eminent one be named\r\nfor that vacant post of chamberlain. It was the earliest word which the\r\nreputable old gentleman had heard on the subject, for the friends of the\r\neminent one as yet had not broached the business with him.\r\n\r\nWhen I urged the name of the eminent one, the reputable old gentleman\r\npursed up his lips and frowned. He paused for so long a period that I\r\nbegan to fear lest he accept my suggestion. To cure such chance, I broke\r\nviolently in upon his cogitations with the commands of the machine.\r\n\r\n“Mark you,” I cried, in the tones wherewith I was wont in former and\r\ndespotic days to rule my Tin Whistles, “mark you! there shall be no\r\ndenial! I demand it in the name of Tammany Hall.”\r\n\r\nThe sequel was what I sought; the reputable old gentleman elevated his\r\ncrest. We straightway quarreled, and separated in hot dudgeon. When the\r\nselect bevy who bore among them the name of the eminent one arrived upon\r\nthe scene, the reputable old gentleman, metaphorically, shut the door in\r\ntheir faces. They departed in a rage, and the fires of their indignation\r\nwere soon communicated to the eminent one.\r\n\r\nAs the result of these various sowings, a nodding harvest of enemies\r\nsprung up to hate and harass the reputable old gentleman. I could tell\r\nthat he would be beaten; he, with the most formidable forces of politics\r\nagainst him solid to a man! To make assurance sure, however, I secretly\r\ncalled to me the Chief of Police. In a moment, the quiet order was\r\nabroad to close the gambling resorts, enforce the excise laws against\r\nsaloons, arrest every contractor violating the ordinances regulating\r\nbuilding material in the streets, and generally, as well as\r\nspecifically, to tighten up the town to a point that left folk gasping.\r\n\r\nNo one can overrate the political effect of this. New York has no home.\r\nIt sits in restaurants and barrooms day and night. It is a city of\r\nnoisome tenements and narrow flats so small that people file themselves\r\naway therein like papers in a pigeonhole.\r\n\r\nThese are not homes: they grant no comfort; men do not seek them until\r\ndriven by want of sleep. It is for the cramped reasons of flats and\r\ntenements that New York is abroad all night. The town lives in the\r\nstreets; or, rather, in those houses of refreshment which, open night\r\nand day, have thrown away their keys.\r\n\r\nThis harsh enforcement of the excise law, or as Old Mike put it,\r\n“Gettin' bechune th' people an' their beer,” roused a wasps' nest\r\nof fifty thousand votes. The reputable old gentleman was to win the\r\nstinging benefit, since he, being chief magistrate, must stand the brunt\r\nas for an act of his administration.\r\n\r\nAltogether, politically speaking, my reputable old gentleman tossed and\r\nbubbled in a steaming kettle of fish when he was given his renomination.\r\nFor my own side, I put up against him a noble nonentity with a historic\r\nname. He was a mere jelly-fish of principle--one whose boneless\r\nconvictions couldn't stand on their own legs. If the town had looked at\r\nmy candidate, it would have repudiated him with a howl. But I knew my\r\npublic. New York votes with its back to the future. Its sole thought is\r\nto throw somebody out of office--in the present instance, the offensive\r\nreputable old gentleman--and this it will do with never a glance at that\r\none who by the effect of the eviction is to be raised to the place.\r\nNo, I had no apprehensions; I named my jelly-fish, and with a straight\r\nmachine-made ticket, mine from truck to keel, shoved boldly forth. This\r\ntime I meant to own the town.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII--HOW THE BOSS TOOK THE TOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE reputable old gentleman was scandalized by what he called my\r\ndefection, and told me so. That I should put up a ticket against him was\r\ngrossest treason.\r\n\r\n“And why should I not?” said I. “You follow the flag of your interest; I\r\nbut profit by your example.”\r\n\r\n“Sir!” cried the reputable old gentleman haughtily, “I have no interest\r\nsave the interest of The public.”\r\n\r\n“So you say,” I retorted, “and doubtless so you think.” I had a desire\r\nto quarrel finally and for all time with the reputable old gentleman,\r\nwhose name I no longer needed, and whose fame as an excise purist would\r\nnow be getting in my way. “You deceive yourself,” I went on. “Your prime\r\nmotive is to tickle your own vanity with a pretense of elevation. From\r\nthe pedestal of your millions, and the safe shelter of a clean white\r\nshirt, you patronize mankind and play the prig. That is what folk say of\r\nyou. As to what obligation in your favor rests personally upon myself,\r\nI have only to recall your treatment of my candidate for that place of\r\nchamberlain.”\r\n\r\n“Do you say men call me a prig?” demanded the reputable old gentleman\r\nwith an indignant start. He ignored his refusal of the eminent one as\r\nchamberlain.\r\n\r\n“Sir, I deny the term 'prig.' If such were my celebration, I should not\r\nhave waited to hear it from you.”\r\n\r\n“What should you hear or know of yourself?” said I. “The man looking\r\nfrom his window does not see his own house. He who marches with it,\r\nnever sees the regiment of which he is a unit. No more can you, as\r\nmayor, see yourself, or estimate the common view concerning you. It\r\nis your vanity to seem independent and above control, and you have\r\ntransacted that vanity at the expense of your friends. I've stood by\r\nwhile others went that road, and politically at least it ever led down\r\nhill.”\r\n\r\nThat was my last conference with the reputable old gentleman. I went\r\nback to Fourteenth Street, and called on my people of Tammany to do\r\ntheir utmost. Nor should I complain of their response, for they went\r\nbehind their batteries with the cool valor of buccaneers.\r\n\r\nThere was but one question which gave me doubt, and that was the\r\nquestion of the Australian ballot, then a novelty in our midst.\r\nTheretofore, a henchman of the machine went with that freeman to the\r\nballot-box, and saw to it how he put no cheat upon his purchasers. Now\r\nour commissioners could approach a polls no nearer than two hundred\r\nfeet; the freeman went in alone, took his folded ticket from the judges,\r\nretired to privacy and a pencil, and marked his ballot where none might\r\nbehold the work. Who then could know that your mercenary, when thus\r\nremoved from beneath one's eye and hand, would fight for one's side? I\r\nmay tell you the situation was putting a wrinkle in my brow when Morton\r\ncame lounging in.\r\n\r\n“You know I've nothing to do with the old gentleman's campaign,” said\r\nhe, following a mouthful or two of commonplace, and puffing the\r\nwhile his usual cigarette. “Gad! I told him that I had withdrawn from\r\npolitics; I did, really! I said it was robbing me of all fineness; and\r\nthat I must defend my native purity of sensibility, don't y' know, and\r\npreserve it from such sordid contact.\r\n\r\n“'Father,' said I, 'you surely would not, for the small cheap glory of a\r\nsecond term, compel me into experiences that must leave me case-hardened\r\nin all that is spiritual?'\r\n\r\n“No, he made no reply; simply turned his back upon me in merited\r\ncontempt. Really, I think he was aware of me for a hypocrite. It was\r\nbeastly hard to go back on the old boy, don't y' know! But for what I\r\nhave in mind it was the thing to do.”\r\n\r\nNow, when I had him to counsel with, I gave Morton my troubles over the\r\nAustralian law. The situation, generally speaking, showed good; the more\r\nbecause there were three tickets in the field. Still, nothing was sure.\r\nWe must work; and we must omit no usual means of adding to our strength.\r\nAnd the Australian law was in our way.\r\n\r\n“Really, you're quite right,” observed Morton, polishing his eyeglass\r\nmeditatively. “To be sure, these beasts of burden, the labor element,\r\nhave politically gone to pieces since our last campaign. But they are\r\nstill wandering about by twos and threes, like so many lost sheep, and\r\nunless properly shepherded--and what a shepherd's crook is money!--they\r\nmay fall into the mouths of opposition wolves, don't y' know. What\r\nexasperating dullards these working people are! I know of but one\r\ngreater fool than the working man, and that is the fool he works for!\r\nAnd so you say this Australian law breeds uncertainty for our side?”\r\n\r\n“There is no way to tell how a man votes.”\r\n\r\nMorton behind that potent eyeglass narrowed his gaze to the end of his\r\nnose, and gave a full minute to thought. Then his eyes, released from\r\ncontemplation of his nose, began to brighten. I placed much reliance\r\nupon the fertility of our exquisite, for all his trumpery affectations\r\nof eyeglass and effeminate mannerisms, and I waited with impatience for\r\nhim to speak.\r\n\r\n“Really, now,” said he, at last, “how many under the old plan would\r\nhandle your money about each polling place?”\r\n\r\n“About four,” I replied. “Then at each polling booth there would be a\r\ndozen pullers-in, to bring up the voters, and go with them to see that\r\nthey put in the right ballots. This last, you will notice, is by the\r\nAustralian system made impossible.”\r\n\r\n“It is the duty of artillery people,” drawled Morton, “whenever the\r\narmor people invent a plate that cannot be perforated by guns in being,\r\ndon't y' know, to at once invent a gun that shall pierce it. The same\r\nholds good in politics. Gad! we must invent a gun that shall knock a\r\nhole through this Australian armor; we must, really! A beastly system, I\r\nshould call it, which those beggarly Australians have constructed! It's\r\nno wonder: they are all convicts down there, and it would need a felon\r\nto devise such an interference. However, this is what I suggest. You\r\nmust get into your hands, we'll put it, five thousand of the printed\r\nballots in advance of election day. This may be secretly done, don't y'\r\nknow, by paying the printers where the tickets are being struck off. A\r\nprinter is such an avaricious dog; he is, really! The tickets would be\r\nequally distributed among those men with the money whom you send about\r\nthe polling places. A ballot in each instance should be marked with the\r\ncross for Tammany Hall before it is given to the recruit. He will then\r\ncarry it into the booth in his pocket. Having received the regular\r\nticket from the hands of the judges, he can go through the form of\r\nretiring, don't y' know; then reappear and give in the ticket which was\r\nmarked by your man of the machine.”\r\n\r\n“And yet,” said I breaking in, “I do not see how you've helped the\r\nsituation. The recruit might still vote the ticket handed him by the\r\njudges, for all our wisdom. Moreover, it would be no easy matter to get\r\nhold of fifty thousand tickets, all of which we would require to make\r\nsure. Five thousand we might manage, but that would not be enough.”\r\n\r\n“You should let me finish; you should, really!” returned Morton. “One\r\nwould not pay the recruit until he returned to that gentleman of finance\r\nwith whom he was dealing, don't y' know, and put into his hands the\r\nunmarked ballot with which the judges had endowed him. That would prove\r\nhis integrity; and it would also equip your agent with a new fresh\r\nballot against the next recruit. Thus you would never run out of\r\nballots. Gad! I flatter myself, I've hit upon an excellent idea, don't\r\ny' know!” and with that, Morton began delicately to caress his mustache,\r\nagain taking on his masquerade of the ineffably inane.\r\n\r\nMorton's plan was good; I saw its merits in a flash. He had proposed\r\na sure system by which the machine might operate in spite of that\r\nantipodean law. We used it too, and it was half the reason of our\r\nvictory. Upon its proposal, I extended my compliments to Morton.\r\n\r\n“Really, it's nothing,” said he, as though the business bored him. “Took\r\nthe hint from football, don't y' know. It is a rule of that murderous\r\namusement, when you can't buck the center, to go around the ends. But I\r\nmust have a ride in the park to rest me; I must, really! I seldom permit\r\nmyself to think--it's beastly bad form to think--and, therefore, when\r\nI do give my intelligence a canter, it fatigues me beyond expression.\r\nWell, good-by! I shall see you when I am recuperated. Meanwhile, you\r\nmust not let that awful parent of mine succeed; it would be our ruin,\r\ndon't y' know!” and Morton glared idiotically behind the eyeglass at\r\nthe thought of the reputable old gentleman flourishing through a second\r\nterm. “Yes, indeed,” he concluded, “the old boy would become a perfect\r\njuggernaut!”\r\n\r\nMorton's plan worked to admiration. The mercenary was given a ballot,\r\nready marked; and later he returned with the one which the judges gave\r\nhim, took his fee, and went his way.\r\n\r\nIn these days, when the ballot furnished, by the judges is stamped on\r\nthe back, each with its separate number in red ink, which number is set\r\nopposite a voter's name at the time he receives the ballot, and all to\r\nbe verified when he brings it again to the judges for deposit in the\r\nbox, the scheme would be valueless. There lies no open chance for the\r\nsubstitution of a ready-made ballot, because of the deterrent number in\r\nred ink.\r\n\r\nUnder these changed conditions, however, as Morton declared they must,\r\nthe gunners of party have invented both the projectile and the rifle to\r\npierce this new and stronger plate. The party emblems, the Eagle, the\r\nStar, the Ship, and other totems of partisanship, are printed across the\r\nhead of the ticket in black accommodating ink. The recruit now makes his\r\ndesignating cross with a pencil that is as soft as fresh paint. Then\r\nhe spreads over the head of the ticket, as he might a piece of blotting\r\npaper, a tissue sheet peculiarly prepared. A gentle rub of the fingers\r\nacross the tissue, stains it plainly with the Eagle, the Star, the Ship,\r\nand the entire procession of totems; also, it takes with the rest an\r\nimpression of that penciled cross. This tissue, our recruit brings to\r\nthat particular paymaster of the forces with whom he is in barter, and a\r\nglance answers the query was the vote made right or wrong. If “right” the\r\nrecruit has his reward; if “wrong,” he is spurned from the presence as\r\none too densely ignorant to be of use.\r\n\r\nThe reputable old gentleman, when the vote came on, was overpowered; he\r\nretired to private life, inveighing against republics for that they were\r\nungrateful. My jelly-fish of historic blood took his place as mayor, and\r\nTammany dominated every corner of the town. My word was absolute\r\nfrom the bench of the jurist to the beat of the policeman; the second\r\ngreatest city in the world, with every dollar of its treasure, was in my\r\nhands to do with it as I would. I drew a swelling sense of comfort from\r\nthe situation which my breast had never known.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I was not made mad by this sudden grant of power. I knew by\r\nthe counsel of Big Kennedy, and the dungeon fate of that Boss who was\r\ndestroyed, that I must light a lamp of caution for my journeyings.\r\nNeither the rôle of bully, nor the bluff method of the highwayman, would\r\nserve; in such rough event, the people, overhanging all, would be upon\r\none like an avalanche. One must proceed by indirection and while the\r\ncommon back was turned; one, being careful, might bleed the public while\r\nit slept.\r\n\r\nWhen the town in its threads was thus wholly in my hands, with every\r\noffice, great or small, held by a man of the machine, Morton came to\r\ncall upon me.\r\n\r\n“And so you're the Czar!” said he.\r\n\r\n“You have the enemy's word for it,” I replied. “'Czar' is what they call\r\nme in their papers when they do not call me 'rogue.'”\r\n\r\n“Mere compliments, all,” returned Morton airily. “Really, I should\r\nfeel proud to be thus distinguished. And yet I'm surprised! I was just\r\ntelling an editor of one of our rampant dailies: 'Can't you see,' said\r\nI, 'that he who speaks ill of his master speaks ill of himself? To call\r\na man a scoundrel or an ignoramus, is to call him weak, since neither\r\nis a mark of strength. And when you term him scoundrel and ignoramus who\r\nhas beaten you, you but name yourself both viler, weaker still. Really,'\r\nI concluded, 'if only to preserve one's own standing, one should ever\r\nspeak well of one's conqueror, don't y' know!' But it was of no use;\r\nthat ink-fellow merely scowled and went his way. However, to discuss a\r\ntheory of epithet was not my present purpose. Do you recall how, on the\r\nedge of the campaign, I said that if you would but win the town I'd lead\r\nyou into millions?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “you said something of the sort.”\r\n\r\n“You must trust me in this: I understand the market better than you do,\r\ndon't y' know. Perhaps you have noticed that Blackberry Traction is very\r\nlow--down to ninety, I think?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I replied, “the thing is news to me. I know nothing of stocks.”\r\n\r\n“It's as well. This, then, is my road to wealth for both of us. As a\r\nfirst move, don't y' know, and as rapidly as I can without sending it\r\nup, I shall load myself for our joint account with we'll say--since I'm\r\nsure I can get that much--forty thousand shares of Blackberry. It will\r\ntake me ten days. When I'm ready, the president of Blackberry will call\r\nupon you; he will, really! He will have an elaborate plan for extending\r\nBlackberry to the northern limits of the town; and he will ask, besides,\r\nfor a half-dozen cross-town franchises to act as feeders to the main\r\nline, and to connect it with the ferries. Be slow and thoughtful with\r\nour Blackberry president, but encourage him. Gad! keep him coming to you\r\nfor a month, and on each occasion seem nearer to his view. In the end,\r\ntell him he can have those franchises--cross-town and extensions--and,\r\nfor your side, go about the preliminary orders to city officers. It\r\nwill send Blackberry aloft like an elevator, don't y' know! Those forty\r\nthousand shares will go to one hundred and thirty-five--really!”\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later Morton gave me the quiet word that he held for us a\r\ntrifle over forty thousand shares of Blackberry which he had taken at an\r\naverage of ninety-one. Also, he had so intrigued that the Blackberry's\r\npresident would seek a meeting with me to consider those extensions, and\r\ndiscover my temper concerning them.\r\n\r\nThe president of Blackberry and I came finally together in a parlor of\r\nthe Hoffman House, as being neutral ground. I found him soft-voiced,\r\nplausible, with a Hebrew cast and clutch. He unfurled his blue-prints,\r\nwhich showed the proposed extensions, and what grants of franchises\r\nwould be required.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning, I was cold, doubtful; I distrusted a public approval\r\nof the grants, and feared the public's resentment.\r\n\r\n“Tammany must retain the people's confidence,” said I. “It can only do\r\nso by protecting jealously the people's interests.”\r\n\r\nThe president of Blackberry shrugged his shoulders. He looked at me\r\nhard, and as one who waited for my personal demands. He would not speak,\r\nbut paused for me to begin. I could feel it in the air how a halfmillion\r\nmight be mine for the work of asking. I never said the word, however; I\r\nhad no mind to put my hand into that dog's mouth.\r\n\r\nThus we stood; he urging, I considering the advisability of those\r\nasked-for franchises. This was our attitude throughout a score of\r\nconferences, and little by little I went leaning the Blackberry way.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the secret of our meetings was whispered in right quarters,\r\nand every day found fresh buyers for Blackberry. Meanwhile, the shares\r\nclimbed high and ever higher, until one bland April morning they stood\r\nat one hundred and thirty-seven.\r\n\r\nThroughout my series of meetings with the president of Blackberry, I had\r\nseen no trace of Morton. For that I cared nothing, but played my part\r\nslowly so as to give him time, having confidence in his loyalty, and\r\nknowing that my interest was his interest, and I in no sort to\r\nbe worsted. On that day when Blackberry showed at one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven, Morton appeared. He laid down a check for an even million\r\nof dollars.\r\n\r\n“I've been getting out of Blackberry for a week,” said he, with his air\r\nof delicate lassitude. “I found that it was tiring me, don't y' know;\r\nI did really! Besides, we've done enough: No gentlemen ever makes more\r\nthan one million on a single turn; it's not good form.” That check,\r\ndrawn to my order, was the biggest of its kind I'd ever handled. I took\r\nit up, and I could feel a pringling to my finger-ends with the contact\r\nof so much wealth all mine. I envied my languid friend his genius for\r\ncoolness and aplomb. He selected a cigarette, and lighted it as though\r\na million here and there, on a twist of the market, was a commonest of\r\naffairs. When I could command my voice, I said:\r\n\r\n“And now I suppose we may give Blackberry its franchises?”\r\n\r\n“No, not yet,” returned Morton. “Really, we're not half through. I've\r\nnot only gotten rid of our holdings, but I've sold thirty-five thousand\r\nshares the other way. It was a deuced hard thing to do without sending\r\nthe stock off--the market is always so beastly ready to tumble, don't\r\ny' know. But I managed it; we're now short about thirty-five thousand\r\nshares at one hundred and thirty-seven.”\r\n\r\n“What then?” said I.\r\n\r\n“On the whole,” continued Morton, with just a gleam of triumph behind\r\nhis eyeglass, “on the whole, I think I should refuse Blackberry, don't\r\ny' know. The public interest would be thrown away; and gad! the people\r\nare prodigiously moved over it already, they are, really! It would be\r\nneither right nor safe. I'd come out in an interview declaring that a\r\ngrant of what Blackberry asks for would be to pillage the town. Here,\r\nI've the interview prepared. What do you say? Shall we send it to the\r\n_Daily Tory_?”\r\n\r\nThe interview appeared; Blackberry fell with a crash. It slumped fifty\r\npoints, and Morton and I were each the better by fairly another million.\r\nBlackberry grazed the reef of a receivership so closely that it rubbed\r\nthe paint from its side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX--THE SON OF THE WIDOW VAN FLANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN now I was rich with double millions, I became harrowed of new\r\nthoughts and sown with new ambitions. It was Blossom to lie at the roots\r\nof it--Blossom, looking from her window of young womanhood upon a world\r\nshe did not understand, and from which she drew away. The world was like\r\na dark room to Blossom, with an imagined fiend to harbor in every\r\ncorner of it. She must go forth among people of manners and station.\r\nThe contact would mend her shyness; with time and usage she might find\r\nherself a pleasant place in life. Now she lived a morbid creature of\r\nsorrow which had no name--a twilight soul of loneliness--and the thought\r\nof curing this went with me day and night.\r\n\r\nNor was I unjustified of authority.\r\n\r\n“Send your daughter into society,” said that physician to whom I put the\r\nquestion. “It will be the true medicine for her case. It is her nerves\r\nthat lack in strength; society, with its dinners and balls and fêtes\r\nand the cheerful hubbub of drawing rooms, should find them exercise, and\r\nrestore them to a complexion of health.”\r\n\r\nAnne did not believe with that savant of nerves. She distrusted my\r\nsociety plans for Blossom.\r\n\r\n“You think they will taunt her with the fact of me,” I said, “like that\r\none who showed her the ape cartoon as a portrait of her father. But\r\nBlossom is grown a woman now. Those whom I want her to meet would be\r\nmade silent by politeness, even if nothing else might serve to stay\r\ntheir tongues from such allusions. And I think she would be loved among\r\nthem, for she is good and beautiful, and you of all should know how she\r\nowns to fineness and elevation.”\r\n\r\n“But it is not her nature,” pleaded Anne. “Blossom would be as much hurt\r\namong those men and women of the drawing rooms as though she walked,\r\nbarefooted, over flints.”\r\n\r\nFor all that Anne might say, I persisted in my resolve. Blossom must be\r\nsaved against herself by an everyday encounter with ones of her own age.\r\nI had more faith than Anne. There must be kindness and sympathy in the\r\nworld, and a countenance for so much goodness as Blossom's. Thus she\r\nshould find it, and the discovery would let in the sun upon an existence\r\nnow overcast with clouds.\r\n\r\nThese were my reasonings. It would win her from her broodings and those\r\nterrors without cause, which to my mind were a kind of insanity that\r\nmight deepen unless checked.\r\n\r\nFull of my great design, I moved into a new home--a little palace in its\r\nway, and one to cost me a penny. I cared nothing for the cost; the house\r\nwas in the center of that region of the socially select. From this fine\r\ncastle of gilt, Blossom should conquer those alliances which were to\r\nmean so much for her good happiness.\r\n\r\nBeing thus fortunately founded, I took Morton into my confidence. He was\r\na patrician by birth and present station; and I knew I might have both\r\nhis hand and his wisdom for what was in my heart. When I laid open my\r\nthought to Morton, he stood at gaze like one planet-struck, while that\r\ninevitable eyeglass dropped from his amazed nose.\r\n\r\n“You must pardon my staring,” said he, at last. “It was a beastly rude\r\nthing to do. But, really, don't y' know, I was surprised that one\r\nof force and depth, and who was happily outside society, should find\r\nhimself so badly guided as to seek to enter it.”\r\n\r\n“You, yourself, are in its midst.”\r\n\r\n“That should be charged,” he returned, “to accident rather than design.\r\nI am in the midst of society, precisely as some unfortunate tree might\r\nbe found in the middle of its native swamp, and only because being born\r\nthere I want of that original energy required for my transplantation.\r\nI will say this,” continued Morton, getting up to walk the floor; “your\r\nintroduction into what we'll style the Four Hundred, don't y' know,\r\nmight easily be brought about. You have now a deal of wealth; and that\r\nof itself should be enough, as the annals of our Four Hundred offer\r\nample guaranty. But more than that, stands the argument of your power,\r\nand how you, in your peculiar fashion, are unique. Gad, for the latter\r\ncause alone, swelldom would welcome you with spread arms; it would,\r\nreally! But believe me, if it were happiness you came seeking you would\r\nmiss it mightily. There is more laughter in Third Avenue than in Fifth.”\r\n\r\n“But it is of my Blossom I am thinking,” I cried. “For myself I am not\r\nso ambitious.”\r\n\r\n“And what should your daughter,” said Morton, “find worth her young\r\nwhile in society? She is, I hear from you, a girl of sensibility. That\r\ntrue, she would find nothing but disappointment in this region you think\r\nso select. Do you know our smart set? Sir, it is composed of savages in\r\nsilk.” Morton, I found, had much the manner of his father, when stirred.\r\n“It is,” he went on, “that circle where discussion concerns itself with\r\nnothing more onerous than golf or paper-chases or singlestickers or polo\r\nor balls or scandals; where there is no literature save the literature\r\nof the bankbook; where snobs invent a pedigree and play at caste; where\r\nfolk give lawn parties to dogs and dinners to which monkeys come as\r\nguests of honor; where quarrels occur over questions of precedence\r\nbetween a mosquito and a flea; where pleasure is a trade, and idleness\r\nan occupation; in short, it is that place where the race, bruised of\r\nriches, has turned cancerous and begun to rot.”\r\n\r\n“You draw a vivid picture,” said I, not without a tincture of derision.\r\n“For all that, I stick by my determination, and ask your help. I tell\r\nyou it is my daughter's life or death.”\r\n\r\nMorton, at this, relapsed into his customary attitude of moral, mental\r\nLah-de-dah, and his lisp and his drawl and his eyeglass found their\r\nusual places. He shrugged his shoulders in his manner of the superfine.\r\n\r\n“Why then,” said he, “and seeing that you will have no other way for it,\r\nyou may command my services. Really, I shall be proud to introduce\r\nyou, don't y' know, as one who, missing being a monkey by birth, is now\r\ndetermined to become one by naturalization. Now I should say that a way\r\nto begin would be to discover a dinner and have you there as a guest. I\r\nknow a society queen who will jump at the chance; she will have you at\r\nher chariot wheel like another Caractacus in another Rome, and parade\r\nyou as a latest captive to her social bow and spear. I'll tell her; it\r\nwill offer an excellent occasion for you to declare your intentions and\r\ntake out your first papers in that Apeland whereof you seem so strenuous\r\nto become a citizen.”\r\n\r\nWhile the work put upon me by my place as Boss had never an end, but\r\nfilled both my day and my night to overflowing, it brought with it\r\ncompensation. If I were ground and worn away on the wheel of my position\r\nlike a knife on a grindstone, still I was kept to keenest edge, and\r\nI felt that joy I've sometimes thought a good blade must taste in the\r\nsheer fact of its trenchant quality. Besides, there would now and then\r\narrive a moment which taught me how roundly I had conquered, and touched\r\nme with that sense of power which offers the highest pleasure whereof\r\nthe soul of man is capable. Here would be an example of what I mean,\r\nalthough I cannot believe the thing could happen in any country save\r\nAmerica or any city other than New York.\r\n\r\nIt was one evening at my own door, when that judge who once sought to\r\nfix upon me the murder of Jimmy the Blacksmith, came tapping for an\r\ninterview. His term was bending towards the evening of its close, and\r\nthe mean purpose of him was none better-than to just plead for his place\r\nagain. I will not say the man was abject; but then the thought of his\r\nmission, added to a memory of that relation to each other in which it\r\nwas aforetime our one day's fate to have stood, choked me with contempt.\r\nI shall let his conduct go by without further characterization; and yet\r\nfor myself, had our fortunes been reversed and he the Boss and I the\r\nJudge, before I had been discovered in an attitude of office-begging\r\nfrom a hand I once plotted to kill, I would have died against the wall.\r\nBut so it was; my visitor would labor with me for a renomination.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was one of destruction; I would put him beneath the\r\nwheel and crush out the breath of his hopes. And then came Big Kennedy's\r\nwarning to avoid revenge when moved of nothing broader than a reason of\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nI sat and gazed mutely upon that judge for a space; he, having told\r\nhis purpose, awaited my decision without more words. I grew cool, and\r\ncunning began to have the upper hand of violence in my breast. If I cast\r\nhim down, the papers would tell of it for the workings of my vengeance.\r\nIf, on the quiet other hand, he were to be returned, it would speak\r\nfor my moderation, and prove me one who in the exercise of power lifted\r\nhimself above the personal. I resolved to continue him; the more since\r\nthe longer I considered, the clearer it grew that my revenge, instead of\r\nbeing starved thereby, would find in it a feast.\r\n\r\n“You tried to put a rope about my neck,” said I at last.\r\n\r\n“I was misled as to the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Still you put a stain upon me. There be thousands who believe me guilty\r\nof bloodshed, and of that you shall clear me by printed word.”\r\n\r\n“I am ever ready to repair an error.”\r\n\r\nWithin a week, with black ink and white paper, my judge in peril set\r\nforth how since my trial he had gone to the ends of that death of Jimmy\r\nthe Blacksmith in its history. I was, he said, an innocent man, having\r\nhad neither part nor lot therein.\r\n\r\nI remember that over the glow of triumph wherewith I read his words,\r\nthere came stealing the chill shadow of a hopeless grief. Those phrases\r\nof exoneration would not recall poor Apple Cheek; nor would they restore\r\nBlossom to that poise and even balance from which she had been shaken on\r\na day before her birth. For all the sorrow of it, however, I made good\r\nmy word; and I have since thought that whether our judge deserved the\r\nplace or no, to say the least he earned it.\r\n\r\nEvery man has his model, and mine was Big John Kennedy. This was in\r\na way of nature, for I had found Big Kennedy in my boyhood, and it is\r\nthen, and then only, when one need look for his great men. When once you\r\nhave grown a beard, you will meet with few heroes, and make to yourself\r\nfew friends; wherefore you should the more cherish those whom your\r\nfortunate youth has furnished.\r\n\r\nBig Kennedy was my exemplar, and there arose few conditions to frown\r\nupon me with a problem to be solved, when I did not consider what Big\r\nKennedy would have done in the face of a like contingency. Nor was I\r\nto one side of the proprieties in such a course. Now, when I glance\r\nbackward down that steep aisle of endeavor up which I've come, I recall\r\noccasions, and some meant for my compliment, when I met presidents,\r\ngovernors, grave jurists, reverend senators, and others of tallest\r\nhonors in the land. They talked and they listened, did these mighty\r\nones; they gave me their views and their reasons for them, and heard\r\nmine in return; and all as equal might encounter equal in a commerce of\r\nlevel terms. And yet, choose as I may, I have not the name of him who\r\nin a pure integrity of force, or that wisdom which makes men follow, was\r\nthe master of Big John Kennedy. My old chief won all his wars within the\r\norganization, and that is the last best test of leadership. He made no\r\nbackward steps, but climbed to a final supremacy and sustained himself.\r\nI was justified in steering by Big Kennedy. Respect aside, I would have\r\nbeen wrecked had I not done so. That man who essays to live with no\r\nshining example to show his feet the path, is as one who wanting a\r\nlantern, and upon a moonless midnight, urges abroad into regions utterly\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nNot alone did I observe those statutes for domination which Big Kennedy\r\nboth by precept and example had given me, but I picked up his alliances;\r\nand that one was the better in my eyes, and came to be observed with\r\nwider favor, who could tell of a day when he carried Big Kennedy's\r\nconfidence. It was a brevet I always honored with my own.\r\n\r\nOne such was the Reverend Bronson, still working for the regeneration\r\nof the Five Points, He often came to me for money or countenance in his\r\nlabors, and I did ever as Big Kennedy would have done and heaped up the\r\nmeasure of his requests.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, also, that I had more of the acquaintance of this good\r\nman than had gone to my former leader. For one thing, we were more\r\nnear in years, and then, too, I have pruned my language of those slangy\r\nrudenesses of speech which loaded the conversation of Big Kennedy, and\r\ncultivated in their stead softness and a verbal cleanliness which put\r\nthe Reverend Bronson at more ease in my company. I remember with what\r\nsatisfaction I heard him say that he took me for a person of education.\r\n\r\nIt was upon a time when I had told him of my little learning; for the\r\ngloom of it was upon me constantly, and now and then I would cry out\r\nagainst it, and speak of it as a burden hard to bear. I shall not soon\r\nforget the real surprise that showed in the Reverend Bronson's face, nor\r\nyet the good it did me.\r\n\r\n“You amaze me!” he cried. “Now, from the English you employ I should not\r\nhave guessed it. Either my observation is dulled, or you speak as much\r\nby grammar as do I, who have seen a college.”\r\n\r\nThis was true by more than half, since like many who have no glint of\r\nletters, and burning with the shame of it, I was wont to listen closely\r\nto the talk of everyone learned of books; and in that manner, and by\r\nimitation, I taught myself a decent speech just as a musician might\r\ncatch a tune by ear.\r\n\r\n“Still I have no education,” I said, when the Reverend Bronson spoke of\r\nhis surprise.\r\n\r\n“But you have, though,” returned he, “only you came by that education\r\nnot in the common way.”\r\n\r\nThat good speech alone, and the comfort of it to curl about my heart,\r\nmore than repaid me for all I ever did or gave by request of the\r\nReverend Bronson; and it pleases me to think I told him so. But I fear I\r\nset down these things rather in vanity than to do a reader service, and\r\nbefore patience turns fierce with me, I will get onward with my story.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon the Reverend Bronson came leading a queer bedraggled boy,\r\nwhose years--for all he was stunted and beneath a size--should have been\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\n“Can't you find something which this lad may do?” asked the Reverend\r\nBronson. “He has neither father nor mother nor home--he seems utterly\r\nfriendless. He has no capacity, so far as I have sounded him, and, while\r\nhe is possessed of a kind of animal sharpness, like the sharpness of a\r\nhawk or a weasel, I can think of nothing to set him about by which he\r\ncould live. Even the streets seem closed to him, since the police for\r\nsome reason pursue him and arrest him on sight. It was in a magistrate's\r\ncourt I found him. He had been dragged there by an officer, and would\r\nhave been sent to a reformatory if I had not rescued him.”\r\n\r\n“And would not that have been the best place for him?” I asked, rather\r\nto hear the Reverend Bronson's reply, than because I believed in my own\r\nquery. Aside from being a born friend of liberty in a largest sense, my\r\nown experience had not led me to believe that our reformatories reform.\r\nI've yet to hear of him who was not made worse by a term in any prison.\r\n“Why not send him to a reformatory?” said I again.\r\n\r\n“No one should be locked up,” contended the Reverend Bronson, “who\r\nhas not shown himself unfit to be free. That is not this boy's case, I\r\nthink; he has had no chance; the police, according to that magistrate\r\nwho gave him into my hands, are relentless against him, and pick him up\r\non sight.”\r\n\r\n“And are not the police good judges of these matters?”\r\n\r\n“I would not trust their judgment,” returned the Reverend Bronson.\r\n“There are many noble men upon the rolls of the police.” Then, with a\r\ndoubtful look: “For the most part, however, I should say they stand at\r\nthe head of the criminal classes, and might best earn their salaries by\r\narresting themselves.”\r\n\r\nAt this, I was made to smile, for it showed how my reverend visitor's\r\nyears along the Bowery had not come and gone without lending him some\r\nsaltiness of wit.\r\n\r\n“Leave the boy here,” said I at last, “I'll find him work to live by,\r\nif it be no more than sitting outside my door, and playing the usher to\r\nthose who call upon me.”\r\n\r\n“Melting Moses is the only name he has given me,” said the Reverend\r\nBronson, as he took his leave. “I suppose, if one might get to it, that\r\nhe has another.”\r\n\r\n“Melting Moses, as a name, should do very well,” said I.\r\n\r\nMelting Moses looked wistfully after the Reverend Bronson when the\r\nlatter departed, and I could tell by that how the urchin regretted the\r\ngoing of the dominie as one might regret the going of an only friend.\r\nSomehow, the lad's forlorn state grew upon me, and I made up my mind to\r\nserve as his protector for a time at least. He was a shrill child of the\r\nBowery, was Melting Moses, and spoke a kind of gutter dialect, one-half\r\nslang and the other a patter of the thieves that was hard to understand.\r\nMy first business was to send him out with the janitor of the building\r\nto have him thrown into a bathtub, and then buttoned into a new suit of\r\nclothes.\r\n\r\nMelting Moses submitted dumbly to these improvements, being rather\r\nresigned than pleased, and later with the same docility went home to\r\nsleep at the janitor's house. Throughout the day he would take up his\r\npost on my door and act as herald to what visitors might come.\r\n\r\nBeing washed and combed and decently arrayed, Melting Moses, with black\r\neyes and a dark elfin face, made no bad figure of a boy. For all his\r\ndwarfishness, I found him surprisingly strong, and as active as a\r\nmonkey. He had all the love and loyalty of a collie for me, and within\r\nthe first month of his keeping my door, he would have cast himself into\r\nthe river if I had asked him for that favor.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, scrap by scrap, Melting Moses gave me his story. Put\r\ntogether in his words, it ran like this:\r\n\r\n“Me fadder kept a joint in Kelly's Alley; d' name of-d' joint was d'\r\nDoor of Death, see! It was a hot number, an' lots of trouble got pulled\r\noff inside. He used to fence for d' guns an' dips, too, me fadder did;\r\nan' w'en one of 'em nipped a super or a rock, an' wanted d' quick dough,\r\nhe brought it to me fadder, who chucked down d' stuff an' no questions\r\nasked. One day a big trick comes off--a jooeler's winder or somet'ing\r\nlike dat. Me fadder is in d' play from d' outside, see! An' so w'en\r\ndere's a holler, he does a sneak an' gets away, 'cause d' cops is layin'\r\nto pinch him. Me fadder gets put wise to this be a mug who hangs out\r\nabout d' Central Office. He sherries like I says.\r\n\r\n“At dat, d' Captain who's out to nail me fadder toins sore all t'rough.\r\nW'en me fadder sidesteps into New Joisey or some'ers, d' Captain sends\r\nalong a couple of his harness bulls from Mulberry Street, an' dey\r\npinches me mudder, who aint had nothin' to do wit' d' play at all.\r\nDey rings for d' hurry-up wagon, an' takes me mudder to d' station. D'\r\nCaptain he gives her d' eye, an' asts where me fadder is. She says she\r\ncan't put him on, 'cause she aint on herself. Wit' dat, dis Captain\r\nt'rows her d' big chest, see! an' says he'll give her d' t'ree degrees\r\nif she don't cough up d' tip. But she hands him out d' old gag: she aint\r\non. So then, d' Captain has her put in a cell; an' nothin' to eat.\r\n\r\n“After d' foist night he brings her up ag'in.\r\n\r\n“'Dat's d' number one d'gree,' says he.\r\n\r\n“But still me mudder don't tell, 'cause she can't. Me fadder aint such a\r\nfarmer as to go leavin' his address wit' no one.\r\n\r\n“D' second night dey keeps me mudder in a cell, an' toins d' hose on d'\r\nfloor so she can't do nothin' but stan' 'round--no sleep! no chuck! no\r\nnothin'!\r\n\r\n“'Dat's d' number two d'gree,' says d' bloke of a Captain to me mudder.\r\n'Now where did dat husband of yours skip to?'\r\n\r\n“But me mudder couldn't tell.\r\n\r\n“'Give d' old goil d' dungeon,' says d' Captain; 'an' t'row her in a\r\nbrace of rats to play wit'.'\r\n\r\n“An' now dey locks me mudder in a place like a cellar, wit' two rats to\r\nsqueak an' scrabble about all night, an' t'row a scare into her.\r\n\r\n“An' it would too, only she goes dotty.\r\n\r\n“Next day, d' Captain puts her in d' street. But w'at's d' use? She's\r\noff her trolley. She toins sick; an' in a week she croaks. D' sawbones\r\ngets her for d' colleges.”\r\n\r\nMelting Moses shed tears at this.\r\n\r\n“Dat's about all,” he concluded. “W'en me mudder was gone, d' cops\r\ntoined in to do me. D' Captain said he was goin' to clean up d' fam'ly;\r\nso he gives d' orders, an' every time I'd show up on d' line, I'd get d'\r\ncollar. It was one of dem times, w'en d' w'itechoker, who passes me on\r\nto you, gets his lamps on me an' begs me off from d' judge, see!”\r\n\r\nMelting Moses wept a deal during his relation, and I was not without\r\nbeing moved by it myself. I gave the boy what consolation I might, by\r\nassuring him that he was safe with me, and that no policeman should\r\nthreaten him. A tale of trouble, and particularly if told by a child,\r\never had power to disturb me, and I did not question Melting Moses\r\nconcerning his father and mother a second time.\r\n\r\nMy noble nonentity--for whom I will say that he allowed me to finger\r\nhim for offices and contracts, as a musician fingers the keyboard of a\r\npiano, and play upon him what tunes of profit I saw fit--was mayor, and\r\nthe town wholly in my hands, with a Tammany man in every office, when\r\nthere occurred the first of a train of events which in their passage\r\nwere to plow a furrow in my life so deep that all the years to come\r\nafter have not served to smooth it away. I was engaged at my desk, when\r\nMelting Moses announced a caller.\r\n\r\n“She's a dame in black,” said Melting Moses; “an' she's of d' Fift'\r\nAvenoo squeeze all right.”\r\n\r\nMelting Moses, now he was fed and dressed, went through the days with\r\nuncommon spirit, and when not thinking on his mother would be gay\r\nenough. My visitors interested him even more than they did me, and he\r\nannounced but few without hazarding his surmise as to both their origins\r\nand their errands.\r\n\r\n“Show her in!” I said.\r\n\r\nMy visitor was a widow, as I could see by her mourning weeds. She was\r\npast middle life; gray, with hollow cheeks, and sad pleading eyes.\r\n\r\n“My name is Van Flange,” said she. “The Reverend Bronson asked me to\r\ncall upon you. It's about my son; he's ruining us by his gambling.”\r\n\r\nThen the Widow Van Flange told of her son's infatuation; and how\r\nblacklegs in Barclay Street were fleecing him with roulette and faro\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nI listened to her story with patience. While I would not find it on my\r\nprogramme to come to her relief, I aimed at respect for one whom the\r\nReverend Bronson had endorsed. I was willing to please that good man,\r\nfor I liked him much since he spoke in commendation of my English.\r\nBesides, if angered, the Reverend Bronson would be capable of trouble.\r\nHe was too deeply and too practically in the heart of the East Side;\r\nhe could not fail to have a tale to tell that would do Tammany Hall no\r\ngood, but only harm. Wherefore, I in no wise cut short the complaints\r\nof the Widow Van Flange. I heard her to the end, training my face to\r\nsympathy the while, and all as though her story were not one commonest\r\nof the town.\r\n\r\n“You may be sure, madam,” said I, when the Widow Van Flange had\r\nfinished, “that not only for the Reverend Bronson's sake, but for your\r\nown, I shall do all I may to serve you. I own no personal knowledge of\r\nthat gambling den of which you speak, nor of those sharpers who conduct\r\nit. That knowledge belongs with the police. The number you give,\r\nhowever, is in Captain Gothecore's precinct. We'll send for him if\r\nyou'll wait.” With that I rang my desk bell for Melting Moses. “Send for\r\nCaptain Gothecore,” said I. At the name, the boy's black eyes flamed up\r\nin a way to puzzle. “Send a messenger for Captain Gothecore; I want him\r\nat once.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX--THE MARK OF THE ROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHILE the Widow Van Flange and I sat waiting the coming of Gothecore,\r\nthe lady gave me further leaves of her story. The name of Van Flange was\r\nold. It had been honorable and high in the days of Wouter Van Twiller,\r\nand when the town was called New Amsterdam. The Van Flanges had found\r\ntheir source among the wooden shoes and spinning-wheels of the ancient\r\nDutch, and were duly proud. They had been rich, but were now reduced,\r\ncounting--she and her boy--no more than two hundred thousand dollars for\r\ntheir fortune.\r\n\r\nThis son over whom she wept was the last Van Flange; there was no one\r\nbeyond him to wear the name. To the mother, this made his case the more\r\ndesperate, for mindful of her caste, she was borne upon by pride of\r\nfamily almost as much as by maternal love. The son was a drunkard; his\r\ntaste for alcohol was congenital, and held him in a grip that could\r\nnot be unloosed. And he was wasting their substance; what small riches\r\nremained to them were running away at a rate that would soon leave\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n“But why do you furnish him money?” said I.\r\n\r\n“You should keep him without a penny.”\r\n\r\n“True!” responded the Widow Van Flange, “but those who pillage my son\r\nhave found a way to make me powerless. There is a restaurant near this\r\ngambling den. The latter, refusing him credit and declining his checks,\r\nsends him always to this restaurant-keeper. He takes my son's check,\r\nand gives him the money for it. I know the whole process,” concluded\r\nthe Widow Van Flange, a sob catching in her throat, “for I've had my son\r\nwatched, to see if aught might be done to save him.”\r\n\r\n“But those checks,” I observed, “should be worthless, for you have told\r\nme how your son has no money of his own.”\r\n\r\n“And that is it,” returned the Widow Van Flange.\r\n\r\n“I must pay them to keep him from prison. Once, when I refused, they\r\nwere about to arrest him for giving a spurious check. My own attorney\r\nwarned me they might do this. My son, himself, takes advantage of it. I\r\nwould sooner be stripped of the last shilling, than suffer the name\r\nof Van Flange to be disgraced. Practicing upon my fears, he does not\r\nscruple to play into the hands of those who scheme his downfall. You may\r\nknow what he is about, when I tell you that within the quarter I have\r\nbeen forced in this fashion to pay over twenty-seven thousand dollars.\r\nI see no way for it but to be ruined,” and her lips twitched with the\r\ndespair she felt.\r\n\r\nWhile the Widow Van Flange and I talked of her son and his down-hill\r\ncourses, I will not pretend that I pondered any interference. The\r\ngamblers were a power in politics. The business of saving sons was none\r\nof mine; but, as I've said, I was willing, by hearing her story, to\r\ncompliment the Reverend Bronson, who had suggested her visit. In the\r\nend, I would shift the burden to the police; they might be relied upon\r\nto find their way through the tangle to the advantage of themselves and\r\nthe machine.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this same Gothecore would easily dispose of the affair. Expert\r\nwith practice, there was none who could so run with the hare while\r\npretending to course with the hounds. Softly, sympathetically, he would\r\ntalk with the Widow Van Flange; and she would depart in the belief that\r\nher cause had found a friend.\r\n\r\nAs the Widow Van Flange and I conversed, we were brought to sudden\r\nsilence by a strange cry. It was a mad, screeching cry, such as might\r\nhave come from some tigerish beast in a heat of fury. I was upon my feet\r\nin a moment, and flung open the door.\r\n\r\nGothecore was standing outside, having come to my message. Over from him\r\nby ten feet was Melting Moses, his shoulders narrowed in a feline way,\r\ncrouching, with brows drawn down and features in a snarl of hate. He was\r\nslowly backing away from Gothecore; not in fear, but rather like some\r\ncat-creature, measuring for a spring.\r\n\r\nOn his side, Gothecore's face offered an equally forbidding picture.\r\nHe was red with rage, and his bulldog jaws had closed like a trap.\r\nAltogether, I never beheld a more inveterate expression, like malice\r\ngone to seed.\r\n\r\nI seized Melting Moses by the shoulder, and so held him back from flying\r\nat Gothecore with teeth and claws.\r\n\r\n“He killed me mudder!” cried Melting Moses, struggling in my fingers\r\nlike something wild.\r\n\r\nWhen the janitor with whom Melting Moses lived had carried him off--and\r\nat that, the boy must be dragged away by force--I turned to Gothecore.\r\n\r\n“What was the trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Why do you stand for that young whelp?” he cried. “I won't have it!”\r\n\r\n“The boy is doing you no harm.”\r\n\r\n“I won't have it!” he cried again. The man was like a maniac.\r\n\r\n“Let me tell you one thing,” I retorted, looking him between the eyes;\r\n“unless you walk with care and talk with care, you are no better than\r\na lost man. One word, one look, and I'll snuff you out between my thumb\r\nand finger as I might a candle.”\r\n\r\nThere must have been that which showed formidable in my manner,\r\nfor Gothecore stood as though stunned. The vicious insolence of the\r\nscoundrel had exploded the powder in my temper like a coal of fire. I\r\npointed the way to my room.\r\n\r\n“Go in; I've business with you.”\r\n\r\nGothecore seemed to recall himself to steadiness. Without more words, he\r\nentered my door.\r\n\r\nWith as much dignity as I might summon in the track of such a storm, I\r\npresented him to the Widow Van Flange. She had heard the sound of our\r\ndifferences; but, taken with her own troubles, she made no account of\r\nthem. The Widow Van Flange received the rather boorish salutation of\r\nGothecore in a way politely finished. Upon my hint, she gave him her\r\nstory. Gothecore assumed a look at once professional and deprecatory.\r\n\r\n“An' now you're done, Madam,” said Gothecore, giving that slight police\r\ncough by which he intimated for himself a limitless wisdom, “an' now\r\nyou're done, Madam, let me chip in a word. I know your son; I've knowed\r\nBilly Van Flange, now, goin' on three year--ever since he comes out o'\r\ncollege. I don't want to discourage you, Madam; but, to put it to you on\r\nth' square, Billy Van Flange is a warm member. I leave it to you to say\r\nif I aint right. Yes, indeed! he's as hot a proposition as ever went\r\ndown th' line.”\r\n\r\nHere the eye of Gothecore wandered towards the ceiling, recalling the\r\nmad pranks of young Van Flange.\r\n\r\n“But these gamblers are destroying him!” moaned the Widow Van Flange.\r\n“Is there no way to shield him? Surely, you should know how to punish\r\nthem, and keep him out of their hands!”\r\n\r\n“I know that gang of card sharps in Barclay Street,” remarked Gothecore;\r\n“an' they're a bunch of butes at that! But let me go on: I'll tell you\r\nwhat we can do; and then I'll tell you why it won't be fly to do it. In\r\nth' finish, however, it will all be up to you, Madam. We'll act on any\r\nsteer you hand us. If you say 'pinch,' pinch goes.\r\n\r\n“But as I was tellin': I'm dead onto Billy Van Flange; I know him like\r\na gambler knows an ace. He hits up th' bottle pretty stiff at that, an'\r\nany man who finds him sober has got to turn out hours earlier than I do.\r\nAn' I'll tell you another thing, Madam: This Billy Van Flange is a tough\r\nmug to handle. More'n once, I've tried to point him for home, an'\r\nevery time it was a case of nothin' doin'. Sometimes he shed tears,\r\nan' sometimes he wanted to scrap; sometimes he'd give me th' laugh,\r\nan' sometimes he'd throw a front an' talk about havin' me fired off th'\r\nforce. He'd run all the way from th' sob or th' fiery eye, to th' gay\r\nface or th' swell front, accordin' as he was jagged.”\r\n\r\nWhile Gothecore thus descanted, the Widow Van Flange buried her face in\r\nher handkerchief. She heard his every word, however, and when Gothecore\r\nagain consulted the ceiling, she signed for him to go on.\r\n\r\n“Knowin' New York as I do,” continued Gothecore, “I may tell you, Madam,\r\nthat every time I get my lamps on that son of yours, I hold up my mits\r\nin wonder to think he aint been killed.” The Widow Van Flange started;\r\nher anxious face was lifted from the handkerchief. “That's on th' level!\r\nI've expected to hear of him bein' croaked, any time this twelve\r\nmonths. Th' best I looked for was that th' trick wouldn't come off in\r\nmy precinct. He carries a wad in his pocket; an' he sports a streak of\r\ngilt, with a thousand-dollar rock, on one of his hooks; an' I could put\r\nyou next to a hundred blokes, not half a mile from here, who'd do him up\r\nfor half th' price. That's straight! Billy Van Flange, considerin' th'\r\nindoocements he hangs out, an' th' way he lays himself wide open to th'\r\nplay, is lucky to be alive.\r\n\r\n“Now why is he alive, Madam? It is due to them very gamblin' ducks in\r\nBarclay Street. Not that they love him; but once them skin gamblers\r\ngets a sucker on th' string, they protect him same as a farmer does his\r\nsheep. They look on him as money in th' bank; an' so they naturally see\r\nto it that no one puts his light out.\r\n\r\n“That's how it stands, Madam!” And now Gothecore made ready to bring\r\nhis observations to a close. This Billy Van Flange, like every other\r\nrounder, has his hangouts. His is this deadfall on Barclay Street, with\r\nthat hash-house keeper to give him th' dough for his checks. Now I'll\r\ntell you what I think. While he sticks to th' Barclay Street mob, he's\r\nsafe. You'll get him back each time. They'll take his stuff; but they'll\r\nleave him his life, an' that's more than many would do.\r\n\r\n“Say th' word, however, an' I can put th' damper on. I can fix it so\r\nBilly Van Flange can't gamble nor cash checks in Barclay Street. They'll\r\nthrow him out th' minute he sticks his nut inside the door. But I'll put\r\nyou wise to it, Madam: If I do, inside of ninety days you'll fish him\r\nout o' th' river; you will, as sure as I'm a foot high!”\r\n\r\nThe face of the Widow Van Flange was pale as paper now, and her bosom\r\nrose and fell with new terrors for her son. The words of Gothecore\r\nseemed prophetic of the passing of the last Van Flange.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” said Gothecore, following a pause, “I've put it up to you. Give\r\nme your orders. Say th' word, an' I'll have th' screws on that Barclay\r\nStreet joint as fast as I can get back to my station-house.”\r\n\r\n“But if we keep him from going there,” said the Widow Van Flange, with\r\na sort of hectic eagerness, “he'll find another place, won't he?” There\r\nwas a curious look in the eyes of the Widow Van Flange. Her hand was\r\npressed upon her bosom as if to smother a pang; her handkerchief went\r\nconstantly to her lips. “He would seek worse resorts?”\r\n\r\n“It's a cinch, Madam!”\r\n\r\n“And he'd be murdered?”\r\n\r\n“Madam, it's apples to ashes!”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the Widow Van Flange seemed to light up with an unearthly\r\nsparkle, while a flush crept out in her cheek. I was gazing upon these\r\nsigns with wonder regarding them as things sinister, threatening ill.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, she stood on her feet; and then she tottered in a blind,\r\nstifled way toward the window as though feeling for light and air.\r\nThe next moment, the red blood came trickling from her mouth; she fell\r\nforward and I caught her in my arms.\r\n\r\n“It's a hemorrhage!” said Gothecore.\r\n\r\nThe awe of death lay upon the man, and his coarse voice was stricken to\r\na whisper.\r\n\r\n“Now Heaven have my soul!” murmured the dying woman. Then: “My son! oh,\r\nmy son!”\r\n\r\nThere came another crimson cataract, and the Widow Van Flange was dead.\r\n\r\n“This is your work!” said I, turning fiercely to Gothecore.\r\n\r\n“Or is it yours?” cries he.\r\n\r\nThe words went over my soul like the teeth of a harrow. Was it my work?\r\n\r\n“No, Chief!” continued Gothecore, more calmly, and as though in answer\r\nto both himself and me, “it's the work of neither of us. You think that\r\nwhat I said killed her. That may be as it may. Every word, however, was\r\ntrue. I but handed her th' straight goods.”\r\n\r\nThe Widow Van Flange was dead; and the thought of her son was in her\r\nheart and on her lips as her soul passed. And the son, bleared and\r\ndrunken, gambled on in the Barclay Street den, untouched. The counters\r\ndid not shake in his hand, nor did the blood run chill in his veins, as\r\nhe continued to stake her fortune and his own in sottish ignorance.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when the first snow of winter was beating in gusty swirls\r\nagainst the panes, Morton walked in upon me. I had not seen that\r\nmiddle-aged fop since the day when I laid out my social hopes and fears\r\nfor Blossom. It being broad September at the time, Morton had pointed\r\nout how nothing might be done before the snows.\r\n\r\n“For our society people,” observed Morton, on that September occasion,\r\n“are migratory, like the wild geese they so much resemble. At this time\r\nthey are leaving Newport for the country, don't y' know. They will not\r\nbe found in town until the frost.”\r\n\r\nNow, when the snow and Morton appeared together, I recalled our\r\nconversation. I at once concluded that his visit had somewhat to do with\r\nour drawing-room designs. Nor was I in the wrong.\r\n\r\n“But first,” said he, when in response to my question he had confessed\r\nas much, “let us decide another matter. Business before pleasure; the\r\ngetting of money should have precedence over its dissipation; it should,\r\nreally! I am about to build a conduit, don't y' know, the whole length\r\nof Mulberry, and I desire you to ask your street department to take no\r\ninvidious notice of the enterprise. You might tell your fellows that it\r\nwouldn't be good form.”\r\n\r\n“But your franchise does not call for a conduit.”\r\n\r\n“We will put it on the ground that Mulberry intends a change to the\r\nunderground trolley--really! That will give us the argument; and I\r\nthink, if needs press, your Corporation Counsel can read the law that\r\nway. He seems such a clever beggar, don't y' know!”\r\n\r\n“But what do you want the conduit for?”\r\n\r\n“There's nothing definite or sure as yet. My notion, however, is to\r\ninaugurate an electric-light company. The conduit, too, would do for\r\ntelephone or telegraph, wires. Really, it's a good thing to have; and my\r\nmen, when this beastly weather softens a bit, might as well be about the\r\ndigging. All that's wanted of you, old chap, is to issue your orders\r\nto the department people to stand aloof, and offer no interruptions. It\r\nwill be a great asset in the hands of Mulberry, that conduit; I shall\r\nincrease the capital stock by five millions, on the strength of it.”\r\n\r\n“Your charter isn't in the way?”\r\n\r\n“The charter contemplates the right on the part of Mulberry to change\r\nits power, don't y' know. We shall declare in favor of shifting to the\r\nunderground trolley; although, really, we won't say when. The necessity\r\nof a conduit follows. Any chap can see that.”\r\n\r\n“Very well!” I replied, “there shall be no interference the city. If the\r\npapers grumble, I leave you and them to fight it out.”\r\n\r\n“Now that's settled,” said Morton, producing his infallible cigarette,\r\n“let us turn to those social victories we have in contemplation. I take\r\nit you remain firm in your frantic resolutions?”\r\n\r\n“I do it for the good of my child,” said I.\r\n\r\n“As though society, as presently practiced,” cried Morton, “could be for\r\nanybody's good! However, I was sure you would not change. You know the\r\nDe Mudds? One of our best families, the De Mudds--really! They are on\r\nthe brink of a tremendous function. They'll dine, and they'll dance, and\r\nall that sort of thing. They've sent you cards, the De Mudds have; and\r\nyou and your daughter are to come. It's the thing to do; you can conquer\r\nsociety in the gross at the De Mudds.”\r\n\r\n“I'm deeply obliged,” said I. “My daughter's peculiar nervous condition\r\nhas preyed upon me more than I've admitted. The physician tells me that\r\nher best hope of health lies in the drawing-rooms.”\r\n\r\n“Let us trust so!” said Morton. “But, realty, old chap, you ought to be\r\ndeucedly proud of the distinction which the De Mudds confer upon you.\r\nAmericans are quite out of their line, don't y' know! And who can\r\nblame them? Americans are such common beggars; there's so many of them,\r\nthey're vulgar. Mamma DeMudd's daughters--three of them--all married\r\nearls. Mamma DeMudd made the deal herself; and taking them by the lot,\r\nshe had those noblemen at a bargain; she did, really! Five millions was\r\nthe figure. Just think of it! five millions for three earls! Why, it was\r\nlike finding them in the street!\r\n\r\n“'But what is he?' asked Mamma DeMudd, when I proposed you for her\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n“'He's a despot,' said I, 'and rules New York. Every man in town is his\r\nserf.'\r\n\r\n“When Mamma DeMudd got this magnificent idea into her head, she was\r\neager to see you; she was, really.\r\n\r\n“However,” concluded Morton, “let us change the subject, if only to\r\nrestore my wits. The moment I speak of society, I become quite idiotic,\r\ndon't y' know!”\r\n\r\n“Speaking of new topics, then,” said I, “let me ask of your father. How\r\ndoes he fare these days?”\r\n\r\n“Busy, exceeding busy!” returned Morton. “He's buying a home in New\r\nJersey. Oh, no, he won't live there; but he requires it as a basis for\r\ndeclaring that he's changed his residence, don't y' know! You'd wonder,\r\ngad! to see how frugal the old gentleman has grown in his old age. It's\r\nthe personal property tax that bothers him; two per cent, on twenty\r\nmillions come to quite a sum; it does, really! The old gentleman doesn't\r\nlike it; so he's going to change his residence to New Jersey. To be\r\nsure, while he'll reside in New Jersey, he'll live here.\r\n\r\n“'It's a fribble, father,' said I, when he set forth his little game.\r\n'Why don't you go down to the tax office, and commit perjury like a man?\r\nAll your friends do.'\r\n\r\n“But, really! he couldn't; and he said so. The old gentleman lacks in\r\nthose rugged characteristics, required when one swears to a point-blank\r\nlie.”\r\n\r\nWhen Morton was gone, I gave myself to pleasant dreams concerning\r\nBlossom. I was sure that the near company and conversation of those men\r\nand women of the better world, whom she was so soon to find about her,\r\nwould accomplish all for which I prayed. Her nerves would be cooled;\r\nshe would be drawn from out that hypochondria into which, throughout her\r\nlife, she had been sinking as in a quicksand.\r\n\r\nI had not unfolded either my anxieties or my designs to Blossom. Now I\r\nwould have Anne tell her of my plans. Time would be called for wherein\r\nto prepare the necessary wardrobe. She should have the best artistes;\r\nnone must outshine my girl, of that I was resolved. These dress-labors,\r\nwith their selections and fittings, would of themselves be excellent.\r\nThey would employ her fancy, and save her from foolish fears of the De\r\nMudds and an experience which she might think on as an ordeal. I never\r\nonce considered myself--I, who was as ignorant of drawing-rooms as a\r\ncart-horse! Blossom held my thoughts. My heart would be implacable until\r\nit beheld her, placed and sure of herself, in the pleasant midst of\r\nthose most elevated circles, towards which not alone my faith, but my\r\nadmiration turned its eyes. I should be proud of her station, as well as\r\nrelieved on the score of her health, when Blossom, serene and even and\r\ncontained, and mistress of her own house, mingled on equal terms with\r\nones who had credit as the nobility of the land.\r\n\r\nWas this the dream of a peasant grown rich? Was it the doting vision of\r\na father mad with fondness? Why should I not so spread the nets of my\r\nmoney and my power as to ensnare eminence and the world's respect for\r\nthis darling Blossom of mine? Wherein would lie the wild extravagance\r\nof the conceit? Surely, there were men in every sort my inferiors, and\r\nwomen, not one of whom was fit to play the rôle of maid to Blossom, who\r\nhad rapped at this gate, and saw it open unto them.\r\n\r\nHome I went elate, high, walking on air. Nor did I consider how weak it\r\nshowed, that I, the stern captain of thousands, and with a great city\r\nin my hands to play or labor with, should be thus feather-tickled with\r\na toy! It was amazing, yes; and yet it was no less sweet:--this building\r\nof air-castles to house my Blossom in!\r\n\r\nIt stood well beyond the strike of midnight as I told Anne the word that\r\nMorton had brought. Anne raised her dove's eyes to mine when I was done,\r\nand they were wet with tears. Anne's face was as the face of a nun, in\r\nits self-sacrifice and the tender, steady disinterest that looked from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNow, as I exulted in a new bright life to be unrolled to the little\r\ntread of Blossom, I saw the shadows of a sorrow, vast and hopeless,\r\nsettle upon Anne. At this I halted. As though to answer my silence, she\r\nput her hand caressingly upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Brother,” said Anne, “you must set aside these thoughts for Blossom of\r\nmen and women she will never meet, of ballrooms she will never enter,\r\nof brilliant costumes she will never wear. It is one and all impossible;\r\nyou do not understand.”\r\n\r\nWith that, irritated of too much opposition and the hateful mystery of\r\nit, I turned roughly practical.\r\n\r\n“Well!” said I, in a hardest tone, “admitting that I do not understand;\r\nand that I think on men and women she will never meet, and ballrooms\r\nshe will never enter. Still, the costumes at least I can control, and\r\nit will mightily please me if you and Blossom at once attend to the\r\nfrocks.”\r\n\r\n“You do not understand!” persisted Anne, with sober gentleness. “Blossom\r\nwould not wear an evening dress.”\r\n\r\n“Anne, you grow daft!” I cried. “How should there be aught immodest in\r\ndressing like every best woman in town? The question of modesty is a\r\nquestion of custom; it is in the exception one will find the indelicate.\r\nI know of no one more immodest than a prude.”\r\n\r\n“Blossom is asleep,” said Anne, in her patient way. Then taking a\r\nbed-candle that burned on a table, she beckoned me. “Come; I will show\r\nyou what I mean. Make no noise; we must not wake Blossom. She must never\r\nknow that you have seen. She has held this a secret from you; and I, for\r\nher poor sake, have done the same.”\r\n\r\nAnne opened the door of Blossom's room. My girl was in a gentle slumber.\r\nWith touch light as down, Anne drew aside the covers from about her\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n“There,” whispered Anne, “there! Look on her throat!”\r\n\r\nOnce, long before, a man had hanged himself, and I was called. I had\r\nnever forgotten the look of those marks which belted the neck of that\r\nself-strangled man. Encircling the lily throat of Blossom, I saw the\r\nfellows to those marks--raw and red and livid!\r\n\r\nThere are no words to tell the horror that swallowed me up. I turned\r\nill; my reason stumbled on its feet. Anne led me from the room.\r\n\r\n“The mark of the rope!” I gasped. “It is the mark of the rope!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI--THE REVEREND BRONSON'S REBELLION\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT should it be?--this gallows-brand to show like a bruised ribbon of\r\nevil about the throat of Blossom! Anne gave me the story of it. It was\r\na birthmark; that hangman fear which smote upon the mother when, for the\r\ndeath of Jimmy the Blacksmith, I was thrown into a murderer's cell, had\r\nleft its hideous trace upon the child. In Blossom's infancy and in her\r\nearliest childhood, the mark had lain hidden beneath the skin as seeds\r\nlie buried and dormant in the ground. Slowly, yet no less surely, the\r\ninveterate years had quickened it and brought it to the surface; it had\r\ngrown and never stopped--this mark! and with each year it took on added\r\nsullenness. The best word that Anne could give me was that it would so\r\ncontinue in its ugly multiplication until the day of Blossom's death.\r\nThere could be no escape; no curing change, by any argument of medicine\r\nor surgery, was to be brought about; there it glared and there it would\r\nremain, a mark to shrink from! to the horrid last. And by that token,\r\nmy plans of a drawing room for Blossom found annihilation. Anne had\r\nsaid the truth; those dreams that my girl should shine, starlike, in the\r\nfirmament of high society, must be put away.\r\n\r\nIt will have a trivial sound, and perchance be scoffed at, when I say\r\nthat for myself, personally, I remember no blacker disappointment than\r\nthat which overtook me as I realized how there could come none of those\r\ntriumphs of chandeliers and floors of wax. Now as I examine myself,\r\nI can tell that not a little of this was due to my own vanity, and a\r\nsecret wish I cherished to see my child the equal of the first.\r\n\r\nAnd if it were so, why should I be shamed? Might I not claim integrity\r\nfor a pride which would have found its account in such advancement? I\r\nhad been a ragged boy about the streets. I had grown up ignorant; I\r\nhad climbed, if climbing be the word, unaided of any pedigree or any\r\npocketbook, into a place of riches and autocratic sway. Wherefore, to\r\nhave surrounded my daughter with the children of ones who had owned\r\nthose advantages which I missed--folk of the purple, all!--and they to\r\naccept her, would have been a victory, and to do me honor. I shall\r\nnot ask the pardon of men because I longed for it; nor do I scruple to\r\nconfess the blow my hopes received when I learned how those ambitions\r\nwould never find a crown.\r\n\r\nFollowing my sight of that gallows mark, I sat for a long time\r\ncollecting myself. It was a dreadful thing to think upon; the more,\r\nsince it seemed to me that Blossom suffered in my stead. It was as if\r\nthat halter, which I defeated, had taken my child for a revenge.\r\n\r\n“What can we do?” said I, at last.\r\n\r\nI spoke more from an instinct of conversation, and because I would have\r\nthe company of Anne's sympathy, than with the thought of being answered\r\nto any purpose. I was set aback, therefore, by her reply.\r\n\r\n“Let Blossom take the veil,” said Anne. “A convent, and the good work of\r\nit, would give her peace.”\r\n\r\nAt that, I started resentfully. To one of my activity, I, who needed the\r\nworld about me every moment--struggling, contending, succeeding--there\r\ncould have come no word more hateful. The cell of a nun! It was as\r\nthough Anne advised a refuge in the grave. I said as much, and with no\r\nspecial choice of phrases.\r\n\r\n“Because Heaven in its injustice,” I cried, “has destroyed half her\r\nlife, she is to make it a meek gift of the balance? Never, while I live!\r\nBlossom shall stay by me; I will make her happy in the teeth of Heaven!”\r\n Thus did I hurl my impious challenge. What was to be the return, and the\r\ntempest it drew upon poor Blossom, I shall unfold before I am done. I\r\nhave a worm of conscience whose slow mouth gnaws my nature, and you may\r\nname it superstition if you choose. And by that I know, when now I sit\r\nhere, lonesome save for my gold, and with no converse better than the\r\nyellow mocking leer of it, that it was this, my blasphemy, which wrought\r\nin Heaven's retort the whole of that misery which descended to dog my\r\ngirl and drag her down. How else shall I explain that double darkness\r\nwhich swallowed up her innocence? It was the bolt of punishment, which\r\nthose skies I had outraged, aimed at me.\r\n\r\nBack to my labors of politics I went, with a fiercer heat than ever. My\r\nlife, begun in politics, must end in politics. Still, there was a mighty\r\nchange. I was not to look upon that strangling mark and escape the\r\nscar of it. I settled to a savage melancholy; I saw no pleasant moment.\r\nConstantly I ran before the hound-pack of my own thoughts, a fugitive,\r\nflying from myself.\r\n\r\nAlso, there came the signs visible, and my hair was to turn and lose\r\nits color, until within a year it went as white as milk. Men, in the\r\nidleness of their curiosity, would notice this, and ask the cause. They\r\nwere not to know; nor did Blossom ever learn how, led by Anne, I had\r\ncrept upon her secret. It was a sorrow without a door, that sorrow of\r\nthe hangman's mark; and because we may not remedy it, we will leave it,\r\nnever again to be referred to until it raps for notice of its own black\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nThe death of the Widow Van Flange did not remove from before me the\r\nquestion of young Van Flange and his degenerate destinies. The Reverend\r\nBronson took up the business where it fell from the nerveless fingers of\r\nhis mother on that day she died.\r\n\r\n“Not that I believe he can be saved,” observed the Reverend Bronson;\r\n“for if I am to judge, the boy is already lost beyond recall. But there\r\nis such goods as a pious vengeance--an anger of righteousness!--and I\r\nfind it in my heart to destroy with the law, those rogues who against\r\nthe law destroy others. That Barclay Street nest of adders must be\r\nburned out; and I come to you for the fire.”\r\n\r\nIn a sober, set-faced way, I was amused by the dominie's extravagance.\r\nAnd yet I felt a call to be on my guard with him. Suppose he were to\r\ndislodge a stone which in its rolling should crash into and crush the\r\nplans of the machine! The town had been lost before, and oftener than\r\nonce, as the result of beginnings no more grave. Aside from my liking\r\nfor the good man, I was warned by the perils of my place to speak him\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, trying for a humorous complexion, “if you are bound for\r\na wrestle with those blacklegs, I will see that you have fair play.”\r\n\r\n“If that be true,” returned the Reverend Bronson, promptly, “give me\r\nInspector McCue.”\r\n\r\n“And why Inspector McCue?” I asked. The suggestion had its baffling\r\nside. Inspector McCue was that honest one urged long ago upon Big\r\nKennedy by Father Considine. I did not know Inspector McCue; there\r\nmight lurk danger in the man. “Why McCue?” I repeated. “The business of\r\narresting gamblers belongs more with the uniformed police. Gothecore is\r\nyour proper officer.”\r\n\r\n“Gothecore is not an honest man,” said the Reverend Bronson, with\r\nsententious frankness. “McCue, on the other hand, is an oasis in the\r\nSahara of the police. He can be trusted. If you support him he will\r\ncollect the facts and enforce the law.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said I, “you shall take McCue. I have no official control\r\nin the matter, being but a private man like yourself. But I will speak\r\nto the Chief of Police, and doubtless he will grant my request.”\r\n\r\n“There is, at least, reason to think so,” retorted the Reverend Bronson\r\nin a dry tone.\r\n\r\nBefore I went about an order to send Inspector McCue to the Reverend\r\nBronson, I resolved to ask a question concerning him. Gothecore should\r\nbe a well-head of information on that point; I would send for Gothecore.\r\nAlso it might be wise to let him hear what was afoot for his precinct.\r\nHe would need to be upon his defense, and to put others interested upon\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nMelting Moses, who still stood warder at my portals, I dispatched upon\r\nsome errand. The sight of Gothecore would set him mad. I felt sorrow\r\nrather than affection for Melting Moses. There was something unsettled\r\nand mentally askew with the boy. He was queer of feature, with the\r\ntwisted fantastic face one sees carved on the far end of a fiddle.\r\nCommonly, he was light of heart, and his laugh would have been comic had\r\nit not been for a note of the weird which rang in it. I had not asked\r\nhim, on the day when he went backing for a spring at the throat of\r\nGothecore, the reason of his hate. His exclamation, “He killed me\r\nmudder!” told the story. Besides, I could have done no good. Melting\r\nMoses would have given me no reply. The boy, true to his faith of Cherry\r\nHill, would fight out his feuds for himself; he would accept no one's\r\nhelp, and regarded the term “squealer” as an epithet of measureless\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nWhen Gothecore came in, I caught him at the first of it glowering\r\nfurtively about, as though seeking someone.\r\n\r\n“Where is that Melting Moses?” he inquired, when he saw how I observed\r\nhim to be searching the place with his eye.\r\n\r\n“And why?” said I.\r\n\r\n“I thought I'd look him over, if you didn't mind. I can't move about\r\nmy precinct of nights but he's behind me, playin' th' shadow. I want to\r\nknow why he pipes me off, an' who sets him to it.”\r\n\r\n“Well then,” said I, a bit impatiently, “I should have thought a\r\nfull-grown Captain of Police was above fearing a boy.”\r\n\r\nWithout giving Gothecore further opening, I told him the story of the\r\nReverend Bronson, and that campaign of purity he would be about.\r\n\r\n“And as to young Van Flange,” said I. “Does he still lose his money in\r\nBarclay Street?”\r\n\r\n“They've cleaned him up,” returned Gothecore. “Billy Van Flange is gone,\r\nhook, line, and sinker. He's on his uppers, goin' about panhandlin' old\r\nchums for a five-dollar bill.”\r\n\r\n“They made quick work of him,” was my comment.\r\n\r\n“He would have it,” said Gothecore. “When his mother died th' boy got\r\nhis bridle off. Th' property--about two hundred thousand dollars--was\r\nin paper an' th' way he turned it into money didn't bother him a bit.\r\nHe came into Barclay Street, simply padded with th' long\r\ngreen--one-thousand-dollar bills, an' all that--an' them gams took it\r\noff him so fast he caught cold. He's dead broke; th' only difference\r\nbetween him an' a hobo, right now, is a trunk full of clothes.”\r\n\r\n“The Reverend Bronson,” said I, “has asked for Inspector McCue. What\r\nsort of a man is McCue?” Gothecore wrinkled his face into an expression\r\nof profound disgust.\r\n\r\n“Who's McCue?” he repeated. “He's one of them mugwump pets. He makes a\r\nbluff about bein' honest, too, does McCue. I think he'd join a church,\r\nif he took a notion it would stiffen his pull.”\r\n\r\n“But is he a man of strength? Can he make trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Trouble?” This with contempt. “When it comes to makin' trouble, he's a\r\nfalse alarm.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said I, in conclusion, “McCue and the dominie are going into\r\nyour precinct.”\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you one thing,” returned Gothecore, his face clouding up, “I\r\nthink it's that same Reverend Bronson who gives Melting Moses th' office\r\nto dog me. I'll put Mr. Whitechoker onto my opinion of th' racket, one\r\nof these days.”\r\n\r\n“You'd better keep your muzzle on,” I retorted. “Your mouth will get you\r\ninto trouble yet.”\r\n\r\nGothecore went away grumbling, and much disposed to call himself\r\nill-used.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days I was to receive frequent visits from the\r\nReverend Bronson. His mission was to enlist me in his crusade against\r\nthe gamblers. I put him aside on that point.\r\n\r\n“You should remember,” said I, as pleasantly as I well could, “that I am\r\na politician, not a policeman. I shall think of my party, and engage in\r\nno unusual moral exploits of the sort you suggest. The town doesn't want\r\nit done.”\r\n\r\n“The question,” responded the Reverend Bronson warmly, “is one of\r\nlaw and morality, and not of the town's desires. You say you are a\r\npolitician, and not a policeman. If it comes to that, I am a preacher,\r\nand not a policeman. Still, I no less esteem it my duty to interfere for\r\nright. I see no difference between your position and my own.”\r\n\r\n“But I do. To raid gamblers, and to denounce them, make for your success\r\nin your profession. With me, it would be all the other way. It is quite\r\neasy for you to adopt the path you do. Now I am not so fortunately\r\nplaced.”\r\n\r\n“You are the head of Tammany Hall,” said the Reverend Bronson solemnly.\r\n“It is a position which loads you with responsibility, since your power\r\nfor good or bad in the town is absolute. You have but to point your\r\nfinger at those gambling dens, and they would wither from the earth.”\r\n\r\n“Now you do me too much compliment,” said I. “The Chief of Tammany is a\r\nmuch weaker man than you think. Moreover, I shall not regard myself as\r\nresponsible for the morals of the town.”\r\n\r\n“Take young Van Flange,” went on the Reverend Bronson, disregarding my\r\nremark. “They've ruined the boy; and you might have saved him.”\r\n\r\n“And there you are mistaken,” I replied. “But if it were so, why should\r\nI be held for his ruin? 'I am not my brother's keeper.'”\r\n\r\n“And so Cain said,” responded the Reverend Bronson. Then, as he was\r\ndeparting: “I do not blame you too much, for I can see that you are the\r\nslave of your position. But do not shield yourself with the word that\r\nyou are not your brother's keeper. You may be made grievously to feel\r\nthat your brother's welfare is your welfare, and that in his destruction\r\nyour own destruction is also to be found.”\r\n\r\nMen have rallied me as superstitious, and it may be that some grains\r\nof truth lie buried in that charge. Sure it is, that this last from the\r\nReverend Bronson was not without its uncomfortable effect. It pressed\r\nupon me in a manner vaguely dark, and when he was gone, I caught\r\nmyself regretting the “cleaning up,” as Gothecore expressed it, of the\r\ndissolute young Van Flange.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, why should one feel sympathy for him who, by his resolute\r\nviciousness, struck down his own mother? If ever rascal deserved ruin,\r\nit was he who had destroyed the hopes of one who loved him before all!\r\nThe more I considered, the less tender for the young Van Flange I grew.\r\nAnd as to his destruction carrying personal scathe for me, it might\r\nindeed do, as a flourish of the pulpit, to say so, but it was a thought\r\ntoo far fetched, as either a warning or a prophecy, to justify one in\r\ntransacting by its light his own existence, or the affairs of a great\r\norganization of politics. The end of it was that I smiled over a\r\nweakness that permitted me to be disturbed by mournful forebodes, born\r\nof those accusing preachments of the Reverend Bronson.\r\n\r\nFor all that my reverend mentor was right; the sequel proved how those\r\nflames which licked up young Van Flange were to set consuming fire to my\r\nown last hope.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that young Van Flange, as a topic, was in everybody's\r\nmouth. Morton, having traction occasion for calling on me, began to talk\r\nof him at once.\r\n\r\n“Really!” observed Morton, discussing young Van Flange, “while he's\r\na deuced bad lot, don't y' know, and not at all likely to do Mulberry\r\ncredit, I couldn't see him starve, if only for his family. So I set him\r\nto work, as far from the company's money as I could put him, and on the\r\nsoberish stipend of nine hundred dollars a year. I look for the best\r\neffects from those nine hundred dollars; a chap can't live a double life\r\non that; he can't, really!”\r\n\r\n“And you call him a bad lot,” said I.\r\n\r\n“The worst in the world,” returned Morton. “You see young Van Flange is\r\nsuch a weakling; really, there's nothing to tie to. All men are vicious;\r\nbut there are some who are strong enough to save themselves. This fellow\r\nisn't.”\r\n\r\n“His family is one of the best,” said I.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I've a sincere respect for blood, and some glimpse of it\r\nmust have found display in my face.\r\n\r\n“My dear boy,” cried Morton, “there's no more empty claptrap than this\r\nclaptrap of family.” Here Morton adorned his high nose with the eyeglass\r\nthat meant so much with him, and surveyed me as from a height. “There's\r\nnothing in a breed when it comes to a man.”\r\n\r\n“Would you say the same of a horse or a dog?”\r\n\r\n“By no means, old chap; but a dog or a horse is prodigiously a different\r\nthing, don't y' know. The dominant traits of either of those noble\r\ncreatures are honesty, courage, loyalty--they're the home of the\r\nvirtues. Now a man is another matter. He's an evil beggar, is a man;\r\nand, like a monkey, he has virtues only so far as you force him to adopt\r\nthem. As Machiavelli says: 'We're born evil, and become good only by\r\ncompulsion.' Now to improve a breed, as the phrase is, makes simply for\r\nthe promotion of what are the dominant traits of the creature one has in\r\nhand. Thus, to refine or emphasize the horse and the dog, increases them\r\nin honesty, loyalty, and courage since such are top-traits with those\r\nanimals. With a monkey or a man, and by similar argument, the more you\r\nrefine him, the more abandoned he becomes. Really,” and here Morton\r\nrestored himself with a cigarette, “I shouldn't want these views to find\r\ntheir way to my club. It would cause the greatest row ever in our set;\r\nit would, really! I am made quite ill to only think of it.”\r\n\r\n“What would you call a gentleman, then?” I asked.\r\n\r\nMorton's theories, while I in no manner subscribed to them, entertained\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“What should I call a gentleman? Why I should call him the caricature of\r\na man, don't y' know.”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Bronson had been abroad in his campaign against those\r\nsharpers of Barclay Street for perhaps four weeks. I understood, without\r\npaying much heed to the subject, that he was seeking the evidence of\r\ntheir crimes, with a final purpose of having them before a court. There\r\nhad been no public stir; the papers had said nothing. What steps\r\nhad been taken were taken without noise. I doubted not that the\r\ninvestigation would, in the finish, die out. The hunted ones of Barclay\r\nStreet were folk well used to the rôle of fugitive, and since Gothecore\r\nkept them informed of the enemy's strategy, I could not think they would\r\noffer the Reverend Bronson and his ally, McCue, any too much margin.\r\n\r\nAs yet, I had never seen this McCue. By that, I knew him to be an honest\r\nman. Not that one is to understand how none save a rogue would come to\r\nme. I need hardly explain, however, that every policeman of dark-lantern\r\nmethods was eagerly prone to make my acquaintance. It was a merest\r\ninstinct of caution; the storm might break and he require a friend. Now\r\nthis McCue had never sought to know me, and so I argued that his record\r\nwas pure white.\r\n\r\nThis did not please me; I preferred men upon whom one might have some\r\nhold. These folk of a smooth honesty go through one's fingers like\r\nwater, and no more of a grip to be obtained upon one of them than upon\r\nthe Hudson. I made up my mind that I would see this McCue.\r\n\r\nStill I did not send for him; it was no part of my policy to exhibit\r\nconcern in one with whom I was strange, and who later might open his\r\nmouth to quote it against me. McCue, however, was so much inclined to\r\nhumor my desire, that one afternoon he walked into my presence of his\r\nown free will.\r\n\r\n“My name is McCue,” said he, “Inspector McCue.” I motioned him to a\r\nchair. “I've been told to collect evidence against certain parties in\r\nBarclay Street,” he added. Then he came to a full stop.\r\n\r\nWhile I waited for him to proceed in his own way and time, I studied\r\nInspector McCue. He was a square-shouldered man, cautious, keen,\r\nresolute; and yet practical, and not one to throw himself away in the\r\njaws of the impossible. What he had come to say, presently proved my\r\nestimate of him. On the whole, I didn't like the looks of Inspector\r\nMcCue.\r\n\r\n“What is your purpose?” I asked at last. “I need not tell you that I\r\nhave no official interest in what you may be about. Still less have I a\r\npersonal concern.”\r\n\r\nInspector McCue's only retort was a grimace that did not add to his\r\npopularity. Next he went boldly to the object of his call.\r\n\r\n“What I want to say is this,” said he. “I've collected the evidence I\r\nwas sent after; I can lay my hands on the parties involved as keepers\r\nand dealers in that Barclay Street den. But I'm old enough to know that\r\nall the evidence in the world won't convict these crooks unless the\r\nmachine is willing. I'm ready to go ahead and take my chances. But I'm\r\nnot ready to run against a stone wall in the dark. I'd be crazy, where\r\nno good can come, to throw myself away.”\r\n\r\n“Now this is doubtless of interest to you,” I replied, putting some\r\nimpression of distance into my tones, “but what have I to do with the\r\nmatter?”\r\n\r\n“Only this,” returned McCue. “I'd like to have you tell me flat, whether\r\nor no you want these parties pinched.”\r\n\r\n“Inspector McCue,” said I, “if that be your name and title, it sticks in\r\nmy head that you are making a mistake. You ask me a question which you\r\nmight better put to your chief.”\r\n\r\n“We won't dispute about it,” returned my caller; “and I'm not here to\r\ngive offense. I am willing to do my duty; but, as I've tried to explain,\r\nI don't care to sacrifice myself if the game's been settled against me\r\nin advance. You speak of my going to the chief. If arrests are to be\r\nmade, he's the last man I ought to get my orders from.”\r\n\r\n“If you will be so good as to explain?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Because, if I am to go on, I must begin by collaring the chief. He's\r\nthe principal owner of that Barclay Street joint.”\r\n\r\nThis was indeed news, and I had no difficulty in looking grave.\r\n\r\n“Captain Gothecore is in it, too; but his end is with the restaurant\r\nkeeper. That check-cashing racket was a case of flam; there was a\r\nhold-out went with that play. The boy, Van Flange, was always drunk,\r\nand the best he ever got for, say a five-hundred-dollar check, was\r\nthree hundred dollars. Gothecore was in on the difference. There's the\r\nlay-out. Not a pleasant outlook, certainly; and not worth attempting\r\narrests about unless I know that the machine is at my back.”\r\n\r\n“You keep using the term 'machine,'” said I coldly. “If by that you mean\r\nTammany Hall, I may tell you, sir, that the 'machine' has no concern in\r\nthe affair. You will do your duty as you see it.”\r\n\r\nInspector McCue sat biting his lips. After a moment, he got upon his\r\nfeet to go.\r\n\r\n“I think it would have been better,” said he, “if you had met me\r\nfrankly. However, I've showed you my hand; now I'll tell you what my\r\ncourse will be. This is Wednesday. I must, as you've said yourself, do\r\nmy duty. If--mark you, I say 'If'--if I am in charge of this case on\r\nSaturday, I shall make the arrests I've indicated.”\r\n\r\n“Did you ever see such gall!” exclaimed the Chief of Police, when I\r\nrecounted my conversation with Inspector McCue. Then, holding up his\r\npudgy hands in a manner of pathetic remonstrance: “It shows what I told\r\nyou long ago. One honest man will put th' whole force on th' bum!”\r\n\r\nInspector McCue, on the day after his visit, was removed from his place,\r\nand ordered to a precinct in the drear far regions of the Bronx. The\r\norder was hardly dry on the paper when there descended upon me the\r\nReverend Bronson, his eyes glittering with indignation, and a protest\r\nagainst this Siberia for Inspector McCue apparent in his face.\r\n\r\n“And this,” cried the Reverend Bronson, as he came through the door,\r\n“and this is what comes to an officer who is willing to do his duty!”\r\n\r\n“Sit down, Doctor,” said I soothingly, at the same time placing a chair;\r\n“sit down.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII--THE MAN OF THE KNIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN the first gust was over, the Reverend Bronson seemed sad rather\r\nthan enraged. He reproached the machine for the failure of his effort\r\nagainst that gambling den.\r\n\r\n“But why do you call yourself defeated?” I asked. It was no part of my\r\npurpose to concede, even by my silence, that either I or Tammany was\r\nopposed to the Reverend Bronson. “You should put the matter to the test\r\nof a trial before you say that.”\r\n\r\n“What can I do without Inspector McCue? and he has been removed from the\r\naffair. I talked with him concerning it; he told me himself there was no\r\nhope.”\r\n\r\n“Now, what were his words?” said I, for I was willing to discover how\r\nfar Inspector McCue had used my name.\r\n\r\n“Why, then,” returned the Reverend Bronson, with a faint smile at the\r\nrecollection, “if I am to give you the precise words, our talk ran\r\nsomewhat like this:\r\n\r\n“'Doctor, what's the use?' said Inspector McCue. 'We're up against it;\r\nwe can't move a wheel.'\r\n\r\n“'There's such a word as law,' said I, advancing much, the argument you\r\nhave just now given me; 'and such a thing as justice.'\r\n\r\n“'Not in the face of the machine,' responded Inspector McCue. 'The will\r\nof the machine stands for all the law and all the justice that we're\r\nlikely to get. The machine has the courts, the juries, the prosecuting\r\nofficers, and the police. Every force we need is in its hands.\r\nPersonally, of course, they couldn't touch you; but if I were to so much\r\nas lift a finger, I'd be destroyed. Some day I, myself, may be chief;\r\nand if I am, for once in a way, I'll guarantee the decent people of this\r\ntown a run for their money.'\r\n\r\n“'And yet,' said I, 'we prate of liberty!'\r\n\r\n“'Liberty!' cried he. 'Doctor, our liberties are in hock to the\r\npoliticians, and we've lost the ticket.'”\r\n\r\nIt was in my mind to presently have the stripes and buttons off the\r\nloquacious, honest Inspector McCue. The Reverend Bronson must have\r\ncaught some gleam of it in my eye; he remonstrated with a gentle hand\r\nupon my arm.\r\n\r\n“Promise me that no more harm shall come to McCue,” he said. “I ought\r\nnot to have repeated his words. He has been banished to the Bronx; isn't\r\nthat punishment enough for doing right?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I returned, after a pause; “I give you my word, your friend is\r\nin no further peril. You should tell him, however, to forget the name,\r\n'machine.' Also, he has too many opinions for a policeman.”\r\n\r\nThe longer I considered, the more it was clear that it would not be a\r\ncautious policy to cashier McCue. It would make an uproar which I\r\ndid not care to court when so near hand to an election. It was not\r\ndifficult, therefore, to give the Reverend Bronson that promise, and I\r\ndid it with a good grace.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by my compliance, the Reverend Bronson pushed into an\r\nargument, the object of which was to bring me to his side for the town's\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n“Doctor,” said I, when he had set forth what he conceived to be my duty\r\nto the premises, “even if I were disposed to go with you, I would have\r\nto go alone. I could no more take Tammany Hall in the direction you\r\ndescribe, than I could take the East River. As I told you once before,\r\nyou should consider our positions. It is the old quarrel of theory and\r\npractice. You proceed upon a theory that men are what they should be; I\r\nmust practice existence upon the fact of men as they are.”\r\n\r\n“There is a debt you owe Above!” returned the Reverend Bronson, the\r\npreacher within him beginning to struggle.\r\n\r\n“And what debt should that be?” I cried, for my mind, on the moment, ran\r\ngloomily to Blossom. “What debt should I owe there?--I, who am the most\r\nunhappy man in the world!”\r\n\r\nThere came a look into the eyes of the Reverend Bronson that was at once\r\nsharp with interrogation and soft with sympathy. He saw that I had\r\nbeen hard wounded, although he could not know by what; and he owned the\r\nkindly tact to change the course of his remarks.\r\n\r\n“There is one point, sure,” resumed the Reverend Bronson, going backward\r\nin his trend of thought, “and of that I warn you. I shall not give up\r\nthis fight. I began with an attack upon those robbers, and I've been\r\nwithstood by ones who should have strengthened my hands. I shall now\r\nassail, not alone the lawbreakers, but their protectors. I shall attack\r\nthe machine and the police. I shall take this story into every paper\r\nthat will print it; I shall summon the pulpits to my aid; I shall\r\narouse the people, if they be not deaf or dead, to wage war on those who\r\nprotect such vultures in their rapine for a share of its returns. There\r\nshall be a moral awakening; and you may yet conclude, when you sit down\r\nin the midst of defeat, that honesty is after all the best policy, and\r\nthat virtue has its reward.”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Bronson, in the heat of feeling, had risen from the chair,\r\nand declaimed rather than said this, while striding up and down. To\r\nhim it was as though my floor were a rostrum, and the private office of\r\nTammany's Chief, a lecture room. I am afraid I smiled a bit cynically at\r\nhis ardor and optimism, for he took me in sharp hand, “Oh! I shall not\r\nlack recruits,” said he, “and some will come from corners you might\r\nleast suspect. I met your great orator, Mr. Gutterglory, but a moment\r\nago; he gave me his hand, and promised his eloquence to the cause of\r\nreform.”\r\n\r\n“Nor does that surprise me,” said I. Then, with a flush of wrath: “You\r\nmay say to orator Gutterglory that I shall have something to remind him\r\nof when he takes the stump in your support.”\r\n\r\nMy anger over Gutterglory owned a certain propriety of foundation. He\r\nwas that sodden Cicero who marred the scene when, long before, I called\r\non Big Kennedy, with the reputable old gentleman and Morton, to consult\r\nover the Gas Company's injunction antics touching Mulberry Traction.\r\nBy some wonderful chance, Gutterglory had turned into sober walks. Big\r\nKennedy, while he lived, and afterward I, myself, had upheld him, and\r\nput him in the way of money. He paid us with eloquence in conventions\r\nand campaigns, and on show occasions when Tammany would celebrate a\r\nholiday or a victory. From low he soared to high, and surely none was\r\nmore pleased thereby than I. On every chance I thrust him forward; and\r\nI was sedulous to see that always a stream of dollar-profit went running\r\nhis way.\r\n\r\nMorton, I remember, did not share my enthusiasm. It was when I suggested\r\nGutterglory as counsel for Mulberry.\r\n\r\n“But really now!” objected Morton, with just a taint of his old-time\r\nlisp, “the creature doesn't know enough. He's as shallow as a skimming\r\ndish, don't y' know.”\r\n\r\n“Gutterglory is the most eloquent of men,” I protested.\r\n\r\n“I grant you the beggar is quite a talker, and all that,” retorted\r\nMorton, twirling that potential eyeglass, “but the trouble is, old\r\nchap, that when we've said that, we've said all. Gutterglory is a mere\r\nrhetorical freak. He ought to take a rest, and give his brain a chance\r\nto grow up with his vocabulary.”\r\n\r\nWhat Morton said had no effect on me; I clung to Gutterglory, and made\r\nhis life worth while. I was given my return when I learned that for\r\nyears he had gone about, unknown to me, extorting money from people with\r\nthe use of my name. Scores have paid peace-money to Gutterglory, and\r\nthought it was I who bled them. So much are we at the mercy of rascals\r\nwho win our confidence!\r\n\r\nIt was the fact of his learning that did it. I could never be called\r\na good judge of one who knew books. I was over prone to think him of\r\nfinest honor who wrote himself a man of letters, for it was my weakness\r\nto trust where I admired. In the end, I discovered the villain duplicity\r\nof Gutterglory, and cast him out; at that, the scoundrel was rich with\r\nsix figures to his fortune, and every dime of it the harvest of some\r\nblackmail in my name.\r\n\r\nHe became a great fop, did Gutterglory; and when last I saw him--it\r\nbeing Easter Day, as I stepped from the Cathedral, where I'd been with\r\nBlossom--he was teetering along Fifth Avenue, face powdered and a glow\r\nof rouge on each cheekbone, stayed in at the waist, top hat, frock coat,\r\nchecked trousers, snowy “spats” over his patent leathers, a violet in\r\nhis buttonhole, a cane carried endwise in his hand, elbows crooked,\r\nshoulders bowed, the body pitched forward on his toes, a perfect picture\r\nof that most pitiful of things--an age-seamed doddering old dandy! This\r\nwas he whom the Reverend Bronson vaunted as an ally!\r\n\r\n“You are welcome to Gutterglory,” said I to my reverend visitor on that\r\ntime when he named him as one to become eloquent for reform. “It but\r\nproves the truth of what Big John Kennedy so often said: Any rogue,\r\nkicked out of Tammany Hall for his scoundrelisms, can always be sure of\r\na job as a 'reformer.'”\r\n\r\n“Really!” observed Morton, when a few days later I was telling him of\r\nthe visit of the Reverend Bronson, “I've a vast respect for Bronson. I\r\ncan't say that I understand him--working for nothing among the scum and\r\nrubbish of humanity!--for personally I've no talent for religion, don't\r\ny' know! And so he thinks that honesty is the best policy!”\r\n\r\n“He seemed to think it not open to contradiction.”\r\n\r\n“Hallucination, positive hallucination, my boy! At-least, if taken in a\r\nmoney sense; and 'pon my word! that's the only sense in which it's worth\r\none's while to take anything--really! Honesty the best policy! Why, our\r\ndominie should look about him. Some of our most profound scoundrels are\r\nour richest men. Money is so much like water, don't y' know, that it\r\nseems always to seek the lowest places;” and with that, Morton went\r\nhis elegant way, yawning behind his hand, as if to so much exert his\r\nintelligence wearied him.\r\n\r\nFor over nine years--ever since the death of Big Kennedy--I had kept the\r\ntown in my hands, and nothing strong enough to shake my hold upon\r\nit. This must have its end. It was not in the chapter of chance that\r\nanyone's rule should be uninterrupted. Men turn themselves in bed, if\r\nfor no reason than just to lie the other way; and so will your town turn\r\non its couch of politics. Folk grow weary of a course or a conviction,\r\nand to rest themselves, they will put it aside and have another in its\r\nplace. Then, after a bit, they return to the old.\r\n\r\nIn politics, these shifts, which are really made because the community\r\nwould relax from some pose of policy and stretch itself in new\r\ndirections, are ever given a pretense of morality as their excuse. There\r\nis a hysteria to arise from the crush and jostle of the great city.\r\nMen, in their crowded nervousness, will clamor for the new. This is also\r\ngiven the name of morals. And because I was aware how these conditions\r\nof restlessness and communal hysteria ever subsist, and like a magazine\r\nof powder ask but the match to fire them and explode into fragments\r\nwhatever rule might at the time exist, I went sure that some day,\r\nsomehow the machine would be overthrown. Also, I went equally certain\r\nhow defeat would be only temporary, and that before all was done, the\r\ntown would again come back to the machine.\r\n\r\nYou've seen a squall rumple and wrinkle and toss the bosom of a lake? If\r\nyou had investigated, you would have learned how that storm-disturbance\r\nwas wholly of the surface. It did not bite the depths below. When the\r\ngust had passed, the lake--whether for good or bad--re-settled to its\r\nusual, equal state. Now the natural conditions of New York are machine\r\nconditions. Wherefore, I realized, as I've written, that no gust of\r\nreformation could either trouble it deeply or last for long, and that\r\nthe moment it had passed, the machine must at once succeed to the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the Reverend Bronson left me, vowing insurrection, I had\r\nno fears of the sort immediate. The times were not hysterical, nor ripe\r\nfor change. I would re-carry the city; the Reverend Bronson--if his\r\nstrength were to last that long--with those moralists he enlisted, might\r\ndefeat me on some other distant day. But for the election at hand I was\r\nsafe by every sign.\r\n\r\nAs I pored over the possibilities, I could discern no present argument\r\nin his favor. He himself might be morally sure of machine protection\r\nfor those men of Barclay Street. But to the public he could offer no\r\npractical proof. Should he tell the ruin of young Van Flange, no one\r\nwould pay peculiar heed. Such tales were of the frequent. Nor would\r\nthe fate of young Van Flange, who had employed his name and his fortune\r\nsolely as the bed-plates of an endless dissipation, evoke a sympathy.\r\nIndeed those who knew him best--those who had seen him then, and who saw\r\nhim now at his Mulberry Traction desk, industrious, sober, respectable\r\nin a hall-bedroom way on his narrow nine hundred a year, did not scruple\r\nto declare that his so-called ruin was his regeneration, and that those\r\ncard-criminals who took his money had but worked marvels for his good.\r\nNo; I could not smell defeat in the contest coming down. I was safe for\r\nthe next election; and the eyes of no politician, let me tell you, are\r\nstrong enough to see further than the ballot just ahead. On these facts\r\nand their deductions, while I would have preferred peace between the\r\nReverend Bronson and the machine, and might have conceded not a little\r\nto preserve it, I based no present fears of that earnest gentleman, nor\r\nof any fires of politics he might kindle.\r\n\r\nAnd I would have come through as I forejudged, had it not been for that\r\nelement of the unlooked-for to enter into the best arranged equation,\r\nand which this time fought against me. There came marching down upon me\r\na sudden procession of blood in a sort of red lockstep of death. In it\r\nwas carried away that boy of my door, Melting Moses, and I may say that\r\nhis going clouded my eye. Gothecore went also; but I felt no sorrow\r\nfor the death of that ignobility in blue, since it was the rock of his\r\nmurderous, coarse brutality on which I split. There was a third to die,\r\nan innocent and a stranger; however, I might better give the story of it\r\nby beginning with a different strand.\r\n\r\nIn that day when the Reverend Bronson and Inspector McCue worked for the\r\ncondemnation of those bandits of Barclay Street, there was one whom they\r\nproposed as a witness when a case should be called in court. This man\r\nhad been a waiter in the restaurant which robbed young Van Flange, and\r\nin whose pillage Gothecore himself was said to have had his share.\r\n\r\nAfter Inspector McCue was put away in the Bronx, and the Reverend\r\nBronson made to give up his direct war upon the dens, this would-be\r\nwitness was arrested and cast into a cell of the station where Gothecore\r\nheld sway. The Reverend Bronson declared that the arrested one had been\r\nseized by order of Gothecore, and for revenge. Gothecore, ignorant,\r\ncruel, rapacious, violent, and with never a glimmer of innate fineness\r\nto teach him those external decencies which go between man and man as\r\ncourtesy, gave by his conduct a deal of plausibility to the charge.\r\n\r\n“Get out of my station!” cried Gothecore, with a rain of oath upon oath;\r\n“get out, or I'll have you chucked out!” This was when the Reverend\r\nBronson demanded the charge on which the former waiter was held. “Do\r\na sneak!” roared Gothecore, as the Reverend Bronson stood in silent\r\nindignation. “I'll have no pulpit-thumper doggin' me! You show your\r\nmug in here ag'in, an' you'll get th' next cell to that hash-slingin'\r\nstoolpigeon of yours. You can bet your life, I aint called Clean Sweep\r\nBill for fun!”\r\n\r\nAs though this were not enough, there arrived in its wake another bit of\r\nnews that made me, who was on the threshold of my campaign to retain the\r\ntown, bite my lip and dig my palms with the anger it unloosed within\r\nme. By way of added fuel to flames already high, that one waiter, but\r\nthe day before prisoner to Gothecore, must be picked up dead in the\r\nstreets, head club-battered to a pulp.\r\n\r\nWho murdered the man?\r\n\r\nHalf the town said Gothecore.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I do not care to dwell upon that poor man's butchery, and\r\nmy veins run fire to only think of it. There arises the less call for\r\nelaboration, since within hours--for it was the night of that very day\r\non which the murdered man was found--the life was stricken from the\r\nheart of Gothecore. He, too, was gone; and Melting Moses had gone with\r\nhim. By his own choice, this last, as I have cause to know.\r\n\r\n“I'll do him before I'm through!” sobbed Melting Moses, as he was held\r\nback from Gothecore on the occasion when he would have gone foaming for\r\nhis throat; “I'll get him, if I have to go wit' him!”\r\n\r\nIt was the Chief of Police who brought me word. I had sent for him with\r\na purpose of charges against Gothecore, preliminary to his dismissal\r\nfrom the force. Aside from my liking for the Reverend Bronson, and the\r\nresentment I felt for the outrage put upon him, Gothecore must go as a\r\ndefensive move of politics.\r\n\r\nThe Chief's eye, when he arrived, popped and stared with a fishy horror,\r\nand for all the coolness of the early morning his brow showed clammy\r\nand damp. I was in too hot a hurry to either notice or remark on these\r\nphenomena; I reeled off my commands before the visitor could find a\r\nchair.\r\n\r\n“You're too late, Gov'nor,” returned the Chief, munching uneasily, his\r\nfat jowls working. “For once in a way, you've gone to leeward of the\r\nlighthouse.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” said I.\r\n\r\nThen he told the story; and how Gothecore and Melting Moses were taken\r\nfrom the river not four hours before.\r\n\r\n“It was a fire in th' box factory,” said the Chief; “that factory\r\n'buttin' on th' docks. Gothecore goes down from his station. The night's\r\nas dark as the inside of a cow. He's jimmin' along th' edge of th'\r\nwharf, an' no one noticin' in particular. Then of a sudden, there's an\r\noath an' a big splash.\r\n\r\n“'Man overboard!' yells some guy.\r\n\r\n“The man overboard is Gothecore. Two or three coves come chasin' up to\r\nlend a hand.\r\n\r\n“'Some duck jumps after him to save him,' says this party who yells\r\n'overboard!' 'First one, an' then t'other, hits th' water. They oughter\r\nbe some'ers about.'\r\n\r\n“That second party in th' river was Melting Moses. An' say! Gov'nor, he\r\ndidn't go after Gothecore to save him; not he! Melting Moses had shoved\r\nGothecore in; an' seein' him swimmin' hard, an' likely to get ashore,\r\nhe goes after him to cinch th' play. I'll tell you one thing: he cinches\r\nit. He piles himself on Gothecore's back, an' then he crooks his right\r\narm about Gothecore's neck--the reg'lar garotte hug! an' enough to choke\r\nth' life out by itself. That aint th' worst.” Here the Chief's voice\r\nsunk to a whisper. “Melting Moses had his teeth buried in Gothecore's\r\nthroat. Did you ever unlock a bulldog from his hold? Well, it was easy\r\nmoney compared to unhookin' Melting Moses from Gothecore. Sure! both was\r\ndead as mackerels when they got 'em out; they're on th' ice right now.\r\nOh, well!” concluded the Chief; “I told Gothecore his finish more'n\r\nonce. 'Don't rough people around so, Bill,' I'd say; 'you'll dig up more\r\nsnakes than you can kill.' But he wouldn't listen; he was all for th'\r\nstrong-arm, an' th' knock-about! It's a bad system. Nothin's lost by\r\nbein' smooth, Gov'nor; nothin's lost by bein' smooth!” and the Chief\r\nsighed lugubriously; after which he mopped his forehead and looked\r\npensively from the window.\r\n\r\nYour river sailor, on the blackest night, will feel the tide for its\r\nebb or flow by putting his hand in the water. In a manner of speaking,\r\nI could now as plainly feel the popular current setting against the\r\nmachine. It was like a strong flood, and with my experience of the town\r\nand its tempers I knew that we were lost. That murdered man who might\r\nhave been a witness, and the violence done to the Reverend Bronson, were\r\narguments in everybody's mouth.\r\n\r\nAnd so the storm fell; the machine was swept away as by a flood. There\r\nwas no sleight of the ballot that might have saved the day; our money\r\nproved no defense. The people fell upon Tammany and crushed it, and the\r\ntown went from under my hand.\r\n\r\nMorton had seen disaster on its way.\r\n\r\n“And, really! I don't half like it,” observed that lounging king of\r\ntraction. “It will cost me a round fifty thousand dollars, don't y'\r\nknow! Of course, I shall give Tammany the usual fifty thousand, if only\r\nfor the memory of old days. But, by Jove! there's those other chaps.\r\nNow they're going to win, in the language of our departed friend, Mr.\r\nKennedy, I'll have to 'sweeten' them. It's a deuced bore contributing to\r\nboth parties, but this time I can't avoid it--really!” and Morton stared\r\nfeebly into space, as though the situation held him helpless with its\r\nperplexities.\r\n\r\nThere is one worth-while matter to be the offspring of defeat. A beaten\r\nman may tell the names of his friends. On the day after I scored a\r\nvictory, my ante-rooms had been thronged. Following that disaster to\r\nthe machine, just chronicled, I sat as much alone as though Fourteenth\r\nStreet were the center of a pathless waste.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was not to be wholly deserted. It was in the first shadows\r\nof the evening, when a soiled bit of paper doing crumpled duty as a card\r\nwas brought me. I glanced at it indifferently. I had nothing to give;\r\nwhy should anyone seek me? There was no name, but my interest flared up\r\nat this line of identification:\r\n\r\n“The Man of the Knife!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII--THE WEDDING OF BLOSSOM\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAY, weather-worn, beaten of years, there in the door was my Sicilian!\r\nI observed, as he took a seat, how he limped, with one leg drawn and\r\ndistorted. I had him in and gave him a chair.\r\n\r\nMy Sicilian and I sat looking one upon the other. It was well-nigh the\r\nfull quarter of a century since I'd clapped eyes on him. And to me\r\nthe thing marvelous was that I did not hate him. What a procession\r\nof disasters, and he to be its origin, was represented in that little\r\nweazened man, with his dark skin, monkey-face, and eyes to shine like\r\nbeads! That heart-breaking trial for murder; the death of Apple Cheek;\r\nBlossom and the mark of the rope;--all from him! He was the reef upon\r\nwhich my life had been cast away! These thoughts ran in my head like a\r\nmill-race; and yet, I felt only a friendly warmth as though he were some\r\ngood poor friend of long ago.\r\n\r\nMy Sicilian's story was soon told. He had fallen into the hold of a\r\nvessel and broken his leg. It was mended in so bad a fashion that he\r\nmust now be tied to the shore with it and never sail again. Could I find\r\nhim work?--something, even a little, by which he might have food and\r\nshelter? He put this in a manner indescribably plaintive.\r\n\r\nThen I took a thought full of the whimsical. I would see how far a\r\nbeaten Chief of Tammany Hall might command. There were countless small\r\nberths about the public offices and courts, where a man might take a\r\nmeager salary, perhaps five hundred dollars a year, for a no greater\r\nservice than throwing up a window or arranging the papers on a desk.\r\nThese were within the appointment of what judges or officers prevailed\r\nin the departments or courtrooms to which they belonged. I would offer\r\nmy Sicilian for one.\r\n\r\nAnd I had a plan. I knew what should be the fate of the fallen. I had\r\nmet defeat; also, personally, I had been the target of every flinging\r\nslander which the enemy might invent. It was a time when men would fear\r\nmy friendship as much as on another day they had feared my power. I was\r\nan Ishmael of politics. The timid and the time-serving would shrink away\r\nfrom me.\r\n\r\nThere might, however, be found one who possessed the courage and the\r\ngratitude, someone whom I had made and who remembered it, to take my\r\norders. I decided to search for such a man. Likewise (and this was my\r\nplan) I resolved--for I knew better than most folk how the town would be\r\nin my hands again--to make that one mayor when a time should serve.\r\n\r\n“Come with me,” said I. “You shall have a berth; and I've nothing now to\r\ndo but seek for it.”\r\n\r\nThere was a somber comicality to the situation which came close\r\nto making me laugh--I, the late dictator, abroad begging a\r\nfive-hundred-dollar place!\r\n\r\nTwenty men I went to; and if I had been a leper I could not have filled\r\nthem with a broader terror. One and all they would do nothing. These\r\nfools thought my downfall permanent; they owed everything to me, but\r\nforgot it on my day of loss. They were of the flock of that Frenchman\r\nwho was grateful only for favors to come. Tarred with the Tammany stick\r\nas much as was I, myself, each had turned white in a night, and must\r\nmimic mugwumpery, when now the machine was overborne. Many were those\r\nwhom I marked for slaughter that day; and I may tell you that in a later\r\nhour, one and all, I knocked them on the head.\r\n\r\nNow in the finish of it, I discovered one of a gallant fidelity, and\r\nwho was brave above mugwump threat. He was a judge; and, withal, a man\r\nindomitably honest. But as it is with many bred of the machine, his\r\ninstinct was blindly military. Like Old Mike, he regarded politics as\r\nanother name for war. To the last, he would execute my orders without\r\ndemur.\r\n\r\nWith this judge, I left my Sicilian to dust tables and chairs for\r\nforty dollars a month. It was the wealth of Dives to the poor broken\r\nsailorman, and he thanked me with tears on his face. In a secret,\r\nlock-fast compartment of my memory I put away the name of that judge. He\r\nshould be made first in the town for that one day's work.\r\n\r\nMy late defeat meant, so far as my private matters were involved,\r\nnothing more serious than a jolt to my self-esteem. Nor hardly that,\r\nsince I did not blame myself for the loss of the election. It was the\r\nfortune of battle; and because I had seen it on its way, that shaft of\r\nregret to pierce me was not sharpened of surprise.\r\n\r\nMy fortunes were rolling fat with at least three millions of dollars,\r\nfor I had not held the town a decade to neglect my own good. If it had\r\nbeen Big Kennedy, now, he would have owned fourfold as much. But I was\r\nlavish of habit; besides being no such soul of business thrift as was my\r\nold captain. Three millions should carry me to the end of the journey,\r\nhowever, even though I took no more; there would arise no money-worry to\r\nbark at me. The loss of the town might thin the flanks of my sub-leaders\r\nof Tammany, but the famine could not touch me.\r\n\r\nWhile young Van Flange had been the reason of a deal that was unhappy in\r\nmy destinies, I had never met the boy. Now I was to see him. Morton sent\r\nhim to me on an errand of business; he found me in my own house just as\r\ndinner was done. I was amiably struck with the look of him. He was tall\r\nand broad of shoulder, for he had been an athlete in his college and\r\ntugged at an oar in the boat.\r\n\r\nMy eye felt pleased with young Van Flange from the beginning; he was as\r\ngraceful as an elm, and with a princely set of the head which to my\r\nmind told the story of good blood. His manner, as he met me, became\r\nthe sublimation of deference, and I could discover in his air a tacit\r\nflattery that was as positive, even while as impalpable, as a perfume.\r\nIn his attitude, and in all he did and said, one might observe the\r\naristocrat. The high strain of him showed as plain as a page of print,\r\nand over all a clean delicacy that reminded one of a thoroughbred colt.\r\n\r\nWhile we were together, Anne and Blossom came into the room. This last\r\nwas a kind of office-place I had at home, where the two often visited\r\nwith me in the evening.\r\n\r\nIt was strange, the color that painted itself in the shy face of\r\nBlossom. I thought, too, that young Van Flange's interest stood a bit on\r\ntiptoe. It flashed over me in a moment:\r\n\r\n“Suppose they were to love and wed?”\r\n\r\nThe question, self-put, discovered nothing rebellious in my breast. I\r\nwould abhor myself as a matchmaker between a boy and a girl; and yet, if\r\nI did not help events, at least, I wouldn't interrupt them. If it were\r\nto please Blossom to have him for a husband: why then, God bless the\r\ngirl, and make her day a fair one!\r\n\r\nAnne, who was quicker than I, must have read the new glow in Blossom's\r\nface and the new shine in her eyes. But her own face seemed as friendly\r\nas though the picture gave her no pang, and it reassured me mightily to\r\nfind it so.\r\n\r\nYoung Van Flange made no tiresome stay of it on this evening. But he\r\ncame again, and still again; and once or twice we had him in to dinner.\r\nOur table appeared to be more complete when he was there; it served to\r\nbring an evenness and a balance, like a ship in trim. Finally he was in\r\nand out of the house as free as one of the family.\r\n\r\nFor the earliest time in life, a quiet brightness shone on Blossom that\r\nwas as the sun through mists. As for myself, delight in young Van Flange\r\ncrept upon me like a habit; nor was it made less when I saw how he had a\r\nfancy for my girl, and that it might turn to wedding bells. The thought\r\ngave a whiter prospect of hope for Blossom; also it fostered my own\r\npeace, since my happiness hung utterly by her.\r\n\r\nOne day I put the question of young Van Flange to Morton.\r\n\r\n“Really, now!” said Morton, “I should like him vastly if he had a\r\nstronger under jaw, don't y' know. These fellows with chins like cats'\r\nare a beastly lot in the long run.”\r\n\r\n“But his habits are now good,” I urged. “And he is industrious, is he\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Of course, the puppy works,” responded Morton; “that is, if you're to\r\ncall pottering at a desk by such a respectable term. As for his habits,\r\nthey are the habits of a captive. He's prisoner to his poverty. Gad! one\r\ncan't be so deucedly pernicious, don't y' know, on nine hundred a year.”\r\n Then, with a burst of eagerness: “I know what you would be thinking. But\r\nI say, old chap, you mustn't bank on his blood. Good on both sides, it\r\nmay be; but the blend is bad. Two very reputable drugs may be combined\r\nto make a poison, don't y' know!”\r\n\r\nThere the matter stuck; for I would not tell Morton of any feeling my\r\ngirl might have for young Van Flange. However, Morton's view in no wise\r\nchanged my own; I considered that with the best of motives he might\r\nstill suffer from some warping prejudice.\r\n\r\nThere arose a consideration, however, and one I could not look in the\r\nface. There was that dread birthmark!--the mark of the rope! At last I\r\nbrought up the topic of my fears with Anne.\r\n\r\n“Will he not loathe her?” said I. “Will his love not change to hate when\r\nhe knows?”\r\n\r\n“Did your love change?” Anne asked.\r\n\r\n“But that is not the same.”\r\n\r\n“Be at peace, then,” returned Anne, taking my hand in hers and pressing\r\nit. “I have told him. Nor shall I forget the nobleness of his reply: 'I\r\nlove Blossom,' said he; 'I love her for her heart.'”\r\n\r\nWhen I remember these things, I cannot account for the infatuation of us\r\ntwo--Anne and myself. The blackest villain of earth imposed himself upon\r\nus as a saint! And I had had my warning. I should have known that he who\r\nbroke a mother's heart would break a wife's.\r\n\r\nNow when the forces of reform governed the town, affairs went badly for\r\nthat superlative tribe, and each day offered additional claim for the\r\nreturn of the machine. Government is not meant to be a shepherd of\r\nmorals. Its primal purposes are of the physical, being no more than to\r\nsafeguard property and person. That is the theory; more strongly still\r\nmust it become the practice if one would avoid the enmity of men. He\r\nwhose morals are looked after by the powers that rule, grows impatient,\r\nand in the end, vindictive. No mouth likes the bit; a guardian is never\r\nloved. The reform folk made that error against which Old Mike warned Big\r\nKennedy: They got between the public and its beer.\r\n\r\nThe situation, thus phrased, called for neither intrigue nor labor on my\r\nown part. I had but to stay in my chair, and “reform” itself would drive\r\nthe people into Tammany's arms.\r\n\r\nIn those days I had but scanty glimpses of the Reverend Bronson.\r\nHowever, he now and then would visit me, and when he did, I think I read\r\nin his troubled brow the fear of machine success next time. Morton was\r\nthere on one occasion when the Reverend Bronson came in. They were well\r\nknown to one another, these two; also, they were friends as much as men\r\nmight be whose lives and aims went wide apart.\r\n\r\n“Now the trouble,” observed Morton, as the two discussed that backward\r\npopularity of the present rule, “lies in this: Your purist of politics\r\nis never practical. He walks the air; and for a principle, he fixes\r\nhis eyes on a star. Besides,” concluded Morton, tapping the Reverend\r\nBronson's hand with that invaluable eyeglass, “you make a pet, at the\r\nexpense of statutes more important, of some beggarly little law like the\r\nlaw against gambling.”\r\n\r\n“My dear sir,” exclaimed the Reverend Bronson, “surely you do not defend\r\ngambling.”\r\n\r\n“I defend nothing,” said Morton; “it's too beastly tiresome, don't y'\r\nknow. But, really, the public is no fool; and with a stock-ticker and a\r\nbucket shop on every corner, you will hardly excite folk to madness over\r\nroulette and policy.”\r\n\r\n“The policy shops stretch forth their sordid palms for the pennies of\r\nthe very poor,” said the Reverend Bronson earnestly.\r\n\r\n“But, my boy,” retorted Morton, his drooping inanity gaining a color,\r\n“government should be concerned no more about the poor man's penny than\r\nthe rich man's pound. However, if it be a reason, why not suppress the\r\nbarrooms? Gad! what more than your doggery reaches for the pennies of\r\nthe poor?”\r\n\r\n“There is truth in what you say,” consented the Reverend Bronson\r\nregretfully. “Still, I count for but one as an axman in this wilderness\r\nof evil; I can fell but one tree at a time. I will tell you this,\r\nhowever: At the gates of you rich ones must lie the blame for most of\r\nthe immoralities of the town. You are guilty of two wrongs: You are not\r\nbenevolent; and you set a bad moral example.”\r\n\r\n“Really!” replied Morton, “I, myself, think the rich a deuced bad lot;\r\nin fact, I hold them to be quite as bad as the poor, don't y' know. But\r\nyou speak of benevolence--alms-giving, and that sort of thing. Now I'm\r\nagainst benevolence. There is an immorality in alms just in proportion\r\nas there's a morality to labor. Folk work only because they lack money.\r\nNow you give a man ten dollars and the beggar will stop work.”\r\n\r\n“Let me hear,” observed the Reverend Bronson, amused if not convinced,\r\n“what your remedy for the town's bad morals would be.”\r\n\r\n“Work!” replied Morton, with quite a flash of animation. “I'd make every\r\nfellow work--rich and poor alike. I'd invent fardels for the idle. The\r\nonly difference between the rich and the poor is a difference of cooks\r\nand tailors--really! Idleness, don't y' know, is everywhere and among\r\nall classes the certain seed of vice.”\r\n\r\n“You would have difficulty, I fear,” remarked the Reverend Bronson, “in\r\nconvincing your gilded fellows of the virtuous propriety of labor.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't convince them, old chap, I'd club them to it. It is a\r\nmistake you dominies make, that you are all for persuading when you\r\nshould be for driving. Gad! you should never coax where you can drive,”\r\n and Morton smiled vacantly.\r\n\r\n“You would deal with men as you do with swine?”\r\n\r\n“What should be more appropriate? Think of the points of resemblance.\r\nBoth are obstinate, voracious, complaining, cowardly, ungrateful,\r\nselfish, cruel! One should ever deal with a man on a pig basis.\r\nPersuasion is useless, compliment a waste. You might make a bouquet\r\nfor him--orchids and violets--and, gad! he would eat it, thinking it a\r\ncabbage. But note the pleasing, screaming, scurrying difference when\r\nyou smite him with a brick. Your man and your hog were born knowing all\r\nabout a brick.”\r\n\r\n“The rich do a deal of harm,” remarked the Reverend Bronson\r\nthoughtfully. “Their squanderings, and the brazen spectacle thereof,\r\nshould be enough of themselves to unhinge the morals of mankind. Think\r\non their selfish vulgar aggressions! I've seen a lake, once the open\r\njoy of thousands, bought and fenced to be a play space for one rich man;\r\nI've looked on while a village where hundreds lived and loved and had\r\ntheir pleasant being, died and disappeared to give one rich man room; in\r\nthe brag and bluster of his millions, I've beheld a rich man rearing a\r\nshelter for his crazy brain and body, and borne witness while he bought\r\nlumber yards and planing mills and stone quarries and brick concerns\r\nand lime kilns with a pretense of hastening his building. It is all a\r\ndisquieting example to the poor man looking on. Such folk, dollar-loose\r\nand dollar-mad, frame disgrace for money, and make the better sentiment\r\nof better men fair loathe the name of dollar. And yet it is but a\r\nsickness, I suppose; a sort of rickets of riches--a Saint Vitus dance\r\nof vast wealth! Such go far, however, to bear out your parallel of the\r\nswine; and at the best, they but pile exaggeration on imitation and\r\ndrink perfumed draff from trough of gold.”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Bronson as he gave us this walked up and down the floor\r\nas more than once I'd seen him do when moved. Nor did he particularly\r\naddress himself to either myself or Morton until the close, when he\r\nturned to that latter personage. Pausing in his walk, the Reverend\r\nBronson contemplated Morton at some length; and then, as if his thoughts\r\non money had taken another path, and shaking his finger in the manner of\r\none who preferred an indictment, he said:\r\n\r\n“Cato, the Censor, declared: 'It is difficult to save that city from\r\nruin where a fish sells for more than an ox.' By the bad practices of\r\nyour vulgar rich, that, to-day, is a description of New York. Still,\r\nfrom the public standpoint, I should not call the luxury it tells of,\r\nthe worst effect of wealth, nor the riches which indulge in such luxury\r\nthe most baleful riches. There be those other busy black-flag millions\r\nwhich maraud a people. They cut their way through bars and bolts of\r\ngovernment with the saws and files and acids of their evil influence--an\r\ninfluence whose expression is ever, and simply, bribes. I speak of\r\nthose millions that purchase the passage of one law or the downfall of\r\nanother, and which buy the people's officers like cattle to their\r\nwill. But even as I reproach those criminal millions, I marvel at their\r\nblindness. Cannot such wealth see that in its treasons--for treason it\r\ndoes as much as any Arnold--it but undermines itself? Who should need\r\nstrength and probity in government, and the shelter of them, more than\r\nMoney? And yet in its rapacity without eyes, it must ever be using the\r\ncriminal avarice of officials to pick the stones and mortar from the\r\nhonest foundations of the state!”\r\n\r\nThe Reverend Bronson resumed his walking up and down. Morton, the\r\nimperturbable, lighted a cigarette and puffed bland puffs as though\r\nhe in no fashion felt himself described. Not at all would he honor the\r\nnotion that the reverend rhetorician was talking either of him or at\r\nhim, in his condemnation of those pirate millions.\r\n\r\n“I should feel alarmed for my country,” continued the Reverend Bronson,\r\ncoming back to his chair, “if I did not remember that New York is not\r\nthe nation, and how a sentiment here is never the sentiment there. The\r\ncountry at large has still its ideals; New York, I fear, has nothing\r\nsave its appetites.”\r\n\r\n“To shift discussion,” said Morton lightly, “a discussion that would\r\nseem academic rather than practical, and coming to the City and what you\r\ncall its appetites, let me suggest this: Much of that trouble of\r\nwhich you speak arises by faults of politics as the latter science is\r\npracticed by the parties. Take yourself and our silent friend.” Here\r\nMorton indicated me: “Take the two parties you represent. Neither was\r\never known to propose an onward step. Each of you has for his sole\r\nissue the villainies of the other fellow; the whole of your cry is the\r\niniquity of the opposition; it is really! I'll give both of you this for\r\na warning. The future is to see the man who, leaving a past to bury a.\r\npast, will cry 'Public Ownership!' or some equally engaging slogan. Gad!\r\nold chap, with that, the rabble will follow him as the rats followed the\r\npied piper of Hamelin. The moralist and the grafter will both be left,\r\ndon't y' know!” Morton here returned into that vapidity from which, for\r\nthe moment, he had shaken himself free. “Gad!” he concluded, “you will\r\nnever know what a passion to own things gnaws at your peasant in his\r\nblouse and wooden shoes until some prophetic beggar shouts 'Public\r\nOwnership!' you won't, really!”\r\n\r\n“Sticking to what you term the practical,” said the Reverend Bronson,\r\n“tell me wherein our reform administration has weakened itself.”\r\n\r\n“As I've observed,” responded Morton, “you pick out a law and make a pet\r\nof it, to the neglect of criminal matters more important. It is\r\nyour fad--your vanity of party, to do this. Also, it is your heel of\r\nAchilles, and through it will come your death-blow.” Then, as if weary\r\nof the serious, Morton went off at a lively tangent: “Someone--a very\r\ngood person, too, I think, although I've mislaid his name--observed:\r\n'Oh, that mine enemy would write a book!' Now I should make it: 'Oh,\r\nthat mine enemy would own a fad!' Given a fellow's fad, I've got him.\r\nOnce upon a time, when I had a measure of great railway moment--really!\r\none of those measures of black-flag millions, don't y' know!--pending\r\nbefore the legislature at Albany, I ran into a gentleman whose name\r\nwas De Vallier. Most surprising creature, this De Vallier! Disgustingly\r\nhonest, too; but above all, as proud as a Spanish Hidalgo of his name.\r\nSaid his ancestors were nobles of France under the Grand Monarch, and\r\nthat sort of thing. Gad! it was his fad--this name! And the bitterness\r\nwherewith he opposed my measure was positively shameful. Really, if the\r\nfloor of the Assembly--the chap was in the Assembly, don't y' know--were\r\nleft unguarded for a moment, De Vallier would occupy it, and call\r\neverybody but himself a venal rogue of bribes. There was never anything\r\nmore shocking!\r\n\r\n“But I hit upon an expedient. If I could but touch his fad--if I might\r\nbut reach that name of De Vallier, I would have him on the hip. So with\r\nthat, don't y' know, I had a bill introduced to change the fellow's name\r\nto Dummeldinger. I did, 'pon my honor! The Assembly adopted it gladly.\r\nThe Senate was about to do the same, when the horrified De Vallier threw\r\nhimself at my feet. He would die if he were called Dummeldinger!\r\n\r\n“The poor fellow's grief affected me very much; my sympathies are easily\r\nexcited--they are, really! And Dummeldinger was such a beastly name! I\r\ncouldn't withstand De Vallier's pleadings. I caused the bill changing\r\nhis name to be withdrawn, and in the fervor of his gratitude, De Vallier\r\nvoted for that railway measure. It was my kindness that won him; in his\r\nrelief to escape 'Dummeldinger,' De Vallier was ready to die for me.”\r\n\r\nIt was evening, and in the younger hours I had pulled my chair before\r\nthe blaze, and was thinking on Apple Cheek, and how I would give the\r\nlast I owned of money and power to have her by me. This was no uncommon\r\ntrain; I've seen few days since she died that did not fill my memory\r\nwith her image.\r\n\r\nOutside raged a threshing storm of snow that was like a threat for\r\nbitterness, and it made the sticks in the fireplace snap and sparkle in\r\na kind of stout defiance, as though inviting it to do its worst.\r\n\r\nIn the next room were Anne and Blossom, and with them young Van Flange.\r\nI could hear the murmur of their voices, and at intervals a little laugh\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\nAn hour went by; the door between opened, and young Van Flange, halting\r\na bit with hesitation that was not without charm, stepped into my\r\npresence. He spoke with grace and courage, however, when once he was\r\nlaunched, and told me his love and asked for Blossom. Then my girl came,\r\nand pressed her face to mine. Anne, too, was there, like a blessing and\r\na hope.\r\n\r\nThey were married:--my girl and young Van Flange. Morton came to my aid;\r\nand I must confess that it was he, with young Van Flange, who helped us\r\nto bridesmaids and ushers, and what others belong with weddings in their\r\ncarrying out. I had none upon whom I might call when now I needed wares\r\nof such fine sort; while Blossom, for her part, living her frightened\r\nlife of seclusion, was as devoid of acquaintances or friends among the\r\nfashionables as any abbess might have been.\r\n\r\nThe street was thronged with people when we drove up, and inside the\r\nchurch was such a jam of roses and folk as I had never beheld. Wide was\r\nthe curious interest in the daughter of Tammany's Chief; and Blossom\r\nmust have felt it, for her hand fluttered like a bird on my arm as, with\r\norgan crashing a wedding march, I led her up the aisle. At the altar\r\nrail were the bishop and three priests. And so, I gave my girl away.\r\n\r\nWhen the ceremony was done, we all went back to my house--Blossom's\r\nhouse, since I had put it in her name--for I would have it that they\r\nmust live with me. I was not to be cheated of my girl; she should not\r\nbe lost out of my arms because she had found a husband's. It wrought\r\na mighty peace for me, this wedding, showing as it did so sure of\r\nhappiness to Blossom. Nor will I say it did not feed my pride. Was it\r\na slight thing that the blood of the Clonmel smith should unite itself\r\nwith a strain, old and proud and blue beyond any in the town? We made\r\none family of it; and when we were settled, my heart filled up with a\r\nfeeling more akin to content than any that had dwelt there for many a\r\nsore day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV--HOW VAN FLANGE WENT INTO STOCKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was by the suggestion of young Van Flange himself that he became\r\na broker. His argument I think was sound; he had been bred to no\r\nprofession, and the floor of the Exchange, if he would have a trade,\r\nwas all that was left him. No one could be of mark or consequence in New\r\nYork who might not write himself master of millions. Morton himself said\r\nthat; and with commerce narrowing to a huddle of mammoth corporations,\r\nhow should anyone look forward to the conquest of millions save through\r\nthose avenues of chance which Wall Street alone provided? The Stock\r\nExchange was all that remained; and with that, I bought young Van Flange\r\na seat therein, and equipped him for a brokerage career. I harbored no\r\nmisgivings of his success; no one could look upon his clean, handsome\r\noutlines and maintain a doubt.\r\n\r\nThose were our happiest days--Blossom's and mine. In her name, I split\r\nmy fortune in two, and gave young Van Flange a million and a half\r\nwherewith to arm his hands for the fray of stocks. Even now, as I look\r\nbackward through the darkness, I still think it a million and a half\r\nwell spent. For throughout those slender months of sunshine, Blossom\r\nwent to and fro about me, radiating a subdued warmth of joy that was\r\nlike the silent glow of a lamp. Yes, that money served its end. It made\r\nBlossom happy, and it will do me good while I live to think how that was\r\nso.\r\n\r\nMorton, when I called young Van Flange from his Mulberry desk to send\r\nhim into Wall Street, was filled with distrust of the scheme.\r\n\r\n“You should have him stay with Mulberry,” said he. “If he do no good, at\r\nleast he will do no harm, and that, don't y' know, is a business record\r\nfar above the average. Besides, he's safer; he is, really!”\r\n\r\nThis I did not like from Morton. He himself was a famous man of stocks,\r\nand had piled millions upon millions in a pyramid of speculation. Did\r\nhe claim for himself a monopoly of stock intelligence? Van Flange was as\r\nwell taught of books as was he, and came of a better family. Was it that\r\nhe arrogated to his own head a superiority of wit for finding his way\r\nabout in those channels of stock value? I said something of this sorb to\r\nMorton.\r\n\r\n“Believe me, old chap,” said he, laying his slim hand on my shoulder,\r\n“believe me, I had nothing on my mind beyond your own safety, and the\r\nsafety of that cub of yours. And I think you will agree that I have\r\nexhibited a knowledge of what winds and currents and rocks might\r\ninterrupt or wreck one in his voyages after stocks.”\r\n\r\n“Admitting all you say,” I replied, “it does not follow that another may\r\nnot know or learn to know as much.”\r\n\r\n“But Wall Street is such a quicksand,” he persisted. “Gad! it swallows\r\nnine of every ten who set foot in it. And to deduce safety for another,\r\nbecause I am and have been safe, might troll you into error. You should\r\nconsider my peculiar case. I was born with beak and claw for the game.\r\nLike the fish-hawk, I can hover above the stream of stocks, and swoop\r\nin and out, taking my quarry where it swims. And then, remember my\r\narrangements. I have an agent at the elbow of every opportunity. I have\r\nmade the world my spy, since I pay the highest price for information. If\r\na word be said in a cabinet, I hear it; if a decision of court is to be\r\nhanded down, I know it; if any of our great forces or monarchs of the\r\nstreet so much as move a finger, I see it. And yet, with all I know, and\r\nall I see, and all I hear, and all my nets and snares as complicated as\r\nthe works of a watch, added to a native genius, the best I may do is\r\nwin four times in seven. In Wall Street, a man meets with not alone the\r\nforeseeable, but the unforeseeable; he does, really! He is like a man in\r\na tempest, and may be struck dead by some cloud-leveled bolt while you\r\nand he stand talking, don't y' know!”\r\n\r\nMorton fell a long day's journey short of convincing me that Wall Street\r\nwas a theater of peril for young Van Flange. Moreover, the boy said\r\ntrue; it offered the one way open to his feet. Thus reasoning, and led\r\nby my love for my girl and my delight to think how she was happy, I did\r\nall I might to further the ambitions of young Van Flange, and embark him\r\nas a trader of stocks. He took office rooms in Broad Street; and on the\r\none or two occasions when I set foot in them, I was flattered as well as\r\namazed by the array of clerks and stock-tickers, blackboards, and\r\ntall baskets, which met my untaught gaze. The scene seemed to buzz and\r\nvibrate with prosperity, and the air was vital of those riches which it\r\npromised.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce required that I say I paid not the least attention to young\r\nVan Flange and his business affairs. I possessed no stock knowledge,\r\nbeing as darkened touching Wall Street as any Hottentot. More than that,\r\nmy time was taken up with Tammany Hall. The flow of general feeling\r\ncontinued to favor a return of the machine, for the public was becoming\r\nmore and sorely irked of a misfit “reform” that was too tight in one\r\nplace while too loose in another. There stood no doubt of it; I had only\r\nto wait and maintain my own lines in order, and the town would be my\r\nown again. It would yet lie in my lap like a goose in the lap of a Dutch\r\nwoman; and I to feather-line my personal nest with its plumage to what\r\nsoft extent I would. For all that, I must watch lynx-like my own forces,\r\nguarding against schism, keeping my people together solidly for the\r\nbattle that was to be won.\r\n\r\nMuch and frequently, I discussed the situation with Morton. With his\r\ntraction operations, he had an interest almost as deep as my own. He\r\nwas, too, the one man on whose wisdom of politics I had been educated to\r\nrely. When it became a question of votes and how to get them, I had yet\r\nto meet Morton going wrong.\r\n\r\n“You should have an issue,” said Morton. “You should not have two, for\r\nthe public is like a dog, don't y' know, and can chase no more than just\r\none rabbit at a time. But one you should have--something you could point\r\nto and promise for the future. As affairs stand--and gad! it has been\r\nthat way since I have had a memory--you and the opposition will go into\r\nthe campaign like a pair of beldame scolds, railing at one another.\r\nPolitics has become a contest of who can throw the most mud. Really, the\r\ntown is beastly tired of both of you--it is, 'pon my word!”\r\n\r\n“Now what issue would you offer?”\r\n\r\n“Do you recall what I told our friend Bronson? Public Ownership should\r\nbe the great card. Go in for the ownership by the town of street\r\nrailways, water works, gas plants, and that sort of thing, don't y'\r\nknow, and the rabble will trample on itself to vote your ticket.”\r\n\r\n“And do you shout 'Municipal Ownership!'--you with a street railway to\r\nlose?”\r\n\r\n“But I wouldn't lose it. I'm not talking of anything but an issue. It\r\nwould be a deuced bore, if Public Ownership actually were to happen.\r\nBesides, for me to lose my road would be the worst possible form! No,\r\nI'm not so insane as that. But it doesn't mean, because you make Public\r\nOwnership an issue, that you must bring it about. There are always ways\r\nto dodge, don't y' know. And the people won't care; the patient beggars\r\nhave been taught to expect it. An issue is like the bell-ringing before\r\nan auction; it is only meant to call a crowd. Once the auction begins,\r\nno one remembers the bell-ringing; they don't, really!”\r\n\r\n“To simply shout 'Public Ownership:'” said I, “would hardly stir the\r\ndepths. We would have to get down to something practical--something\r\ndefinite.”\r\n\r\n“It was the point I was approaching. Really! what should be better now\r\nthan to plainly propose--since the route is unoccupied, and offers\r\na field of cheapest experiment--a street railway with a loop around\r\nWashington Square, and then out Fifth Avenue to One Hundred and Tenth\r\nStreet, next west on One Hundred and Tenth Street to Seventh Avenue, and\r\nlastly north on Seventh Avenue until you strike the Harlem River at the\r\nOne Hundred and Fifty-fifth Street bridge?”\r\n\r\n“What a howl would go up from Fifth Avenue!” said I.\r\n\r\n“If it were so, what then? You are not to be injured by silk-stocking\r\nclamor. For each cry against you from the aristocrats, twenty of the\r\npeasantry would come crying to your back; don't y', know! Patrician\r\nopposition, old chap, means ever plebeian support, and you should do\r\nall you may, with wedge and maul of policy, to split the log along those\r\nlines. Gad!” concluded Morton, bursting suddenly into self-compliments;\r\n“I don't recall when I was so beastly sagacious before--really!”\r\n\r\n“Now I fail to go with you,” I returned. “I have for long believed that\r\nthe strongest force with which the organization had to contend, was its\r\nown lack of fashion. If Tammany had a handful or two of that purple and\r\nfine linen with which you think it so wise to quarrel, it might rub some\r\nof the mud off itself, and have quieter if not fairer treatment from a\r\npress, ever ready to truckle to the town's nobility. Should we win next\r\ntime, it is already in my plans to establish a club in the very heart of\r\nFifth Avenue. I shall attract thither all the folk of elegant fashion\r\nI can, so that, thereafter, should one snap a kodak on the machine, the\r\nforeground of the picture will contain a respectable exhibition of lofty\r\nnames. I want, rather, to get Tammany out of the gutter, than arrange\r\nfor its perpetual stay therein.”\r\n\r\n“Old chap,” said Morton, glorying through his eyeglass, “I think I\r\nshall try a cigarette after that. I need it to resettle my nerves; I do,\r\nreally. Why, my dear boy! do you suppose that Tammany can be anything\r\nother than that unwashed black sheep it is? We shall make bishops of\r\nburglars when that day dawns. The thing's wildly impossible, don't y'\r\nknow! Besides, your machine would die. Feed Tammany Hall on any diet\r\nof an aristocracy, and you will unhinge its stomach; you will, 'pon my\r\nfaith!”\r\n\r\n“You shall see a Tammany club in fashion's center, none the less.”\r\n\r\n“Then you don't like 'Public Ownership?'” observed Morton, after a\r\npause, the while twirling his eyeglass. “Why don't you then go in for\r\ncutting the City off from the State, and making a separate State of it?\r\nYou could say that we suffer from hayseed tyranny, and all that. Really!\r\nit's the truth, don't y' know; and besides, we City fellows would gulp\r\nit down like spring water.”\r\n\r\n“The City delegation in Albany,” said I, “is too small to put through\r\nsuch a bill. The Cornfields would be a unit to smother it.”\r\n\r\n“Not so sure about the Cornfields!” cried Morton. “Of course it would\r\ntake money. That provided, think of the wires you could pull. Here are\r\na half-dozen railroads, with their claws and teeth in the country\r\nand their tails in town. Each of them, don't y' know, as part of its\r\nequipment, owns a little herd of rustic members. You could step on the\r\nrailroad tail with the feet of your fifty city departments, and torture\r\nit into giving you its hayseed marionettes for this scheme of a new\r\nState. Pon my word! old chap, it could be brought about; it could,\r\nreally!”\r\n\r\n“I fear,” said I banteringly, “that after all you are no better than\r\na harebrained theorist. I confess that your plans are too grand for\r\nmy commonplace powers of execution. I shall have to plod on with those\r\nmoss-grown methods which have served us in the past.”\r\n\r\nIt would seem as though I had had Death to be my neighbor from the\r\nbeginning, for his black shadow was in constant play about me. One day\r\nhe would take a victim from out my very arms; again he would grimly step\r\nbetween me and another as we sat in talk. Nor did doctors do much good\r\nor any; and I have thought that all I shall ask, when my own time comes,\r\nis a nurse to lift me in and out of bed, and for the rest of it, why!\r\nlet me die.\r\n\r\nIt was Anne to leave me now, and her death befell like lightning from an\r\nopen sky. Anne was never of your robust women; I should not have said,\r\nhowever, that she was frail, since she was always about, taking the\r\nwhole weight of the house to herself, and, as I found when she was gone,\r\nfurnishing the major portion of its cheerfulness. That was what misled\r\nme, doubtless; a brave smile shone ever on her face like sunlight, and\r\nserved to put me off from any thought of sickness for her.\r\n\r\nIt was her heart, they said; but no such slowness in striking as when\r\nBig Kennedy died. Anne had been abroad for a walk in the early cool of\r\nthe evening. When she returned, and without removing her street gear,\r\nshe sank into a chair in the hall.\r\n\r\n“What ails ye, mem?” asked the old Galway wife that had been nurse to\r\nBlossom, and who undid the door to Anne; “what's the matter of your pale\r\nface?”\r\n\r\n“An' then,” cried the crone, when she gave me the sorry tale of it, “she\r\nanswered wit' a sob. An' next her poor head fell back on the chair, and\r\nshe was by.”\r\n\r\nBoth young Van Flange and I were away from the house at the time of it;\r\nhe about his business, which kept him often, and long, into the night;\r\nand I in the smothering midst of my politics. When I was brought home,\r\nthey had laid Anne's body on her bed. At the foot on a rug crouched the\r\nold nurse, rocking herself forward and back, wailing like a banshee.\r\nBlossom, whose cheek was whitened with the horror of our loss, crept to\r\nmy side and stood close, clutching my hand as in those old terror-ridden\r\nbaby days when unseen demons glowered from the room-comers. It was no\r\ngood sight for Blossom, and I led her away, the old Galway crone at the\r\nbed's foot keening her barbarous mourning after us far down the hall.\r\n\r\nBlossom was all that remained with me now. And yet, she would be enough,\r\nI thought, as I held her, child-fashion, in my arms that night to comfort\r\nher, if only I might keep her happy.\r\n\r\nYoung Van Flange worked at his trade of stocks like a horse. He was into\r\nit early and late, sometimes staying from home all night. I took pride\r\nto think how much more wisely than Morton I had judged the boy.\r\n\r\nThose night absences, when he did not come in until three of the\r\nmorning, and on occasion not at all, gave me no concern. My own business\r\nof Tammany was quite as apt to hold me; for there are events that must\r\nbe dealt with in the immediate, like shooting a bird on the wing. A\r\nmultitude of such were upon me constantly, and there was no moment of\r\nthe day or night that I could say beforehand would not be claimed\r\nby them. When this was my own case, it turned nothing difficult to\r\nunderstand how the exigencies of stocks might be as peremptory.\r\n\r\nOne matter to promote a growing fund of confidence in young Van Flange\r\nwas his sobriety. The story ran--and, in truth, his own mother had told\r\nit--of his drunkenness, when a boy fresh out of his books, and during\r\nthose Barclay Street days when he went throwing his patrimony to the\r\nvultures. That was by and done with; he had somehow gotten by the\r\nbottle. Never but once did he show the flush of liquor, and that fell\r\nout when he had been to a college dinner. I had always understood how\r\nit was the custom to retire drunk from such festivals, wherefore that\r\nparticular inebriety gave me scant uneasiness. One should not expect a\r\nroaring boy about town to turn deacon in a day.\r\n\r\nBlossom was, as I've said, by nature shy and secret, and never one to\r\nrelate her joys or griefs. While she and he were under the same roof\r\nwith me, I had no word from her as to her life with young Van Flange,\r\nand whether it went bright, or was blurred of differences. Nor do I\r\nbelieve that in those days there came aught to harrow her, unless it\r\nwere the feeling that young Van Flange showed less the lover and more\r\nlike folk of fifty than she might have wished.\r\n\r\nOnce and again, indeed, I caught on her face a passing shade; but her\r\neyes cleared when I looked at her, and she would come and put her arms\r\nabout me, and by that I could not help but see how her marriage had\r\nflowered life's path for her. This thought of itself would set off a\r\ntune in my heart like the songs of birds; and I have it the more sharply\r\nupon my memory, because it was the one deep happiness I knew. The\r\nshadows I trapped as they crossed the brow of Blossom, I laid to a\r\nthought that young Van Flange carried too heavy a load of work. It might\r\nbreak him in his health; and the fear had warrant in hollow eyes and a\r\nthin sallowness of face, which piled age upon him, and made him resemble\r\ntwice his years.\r\n\r\nTowards me, the pose of young Van Flange was that one of respectful\r\ndeference which had marked him from the start. Sometimes I was struck\r\nby the notion that he was afraid of me; not with any particularity of\r\nalarm, but as a woman might fear a mastiff, arguing peril from latent\r\nferocities and a savagery of strength.\r\n\r\nStill, he in no wise ran away; one is not to understand that; on the\r\ncontrary he would pass hours in my society, explaining his speculations\r\nand showing those figures which were the record of his profits. I was\r\nglad to listen, too; for while I did not always grasp a meaning, being\r\nstock-dull as I've explained, what he said of “bull” and “bear” and\r\n“short” and “long,” had the smell of combat about it, and held me\r\nenthralled like a romance.\r\n\r\nThere were instances when he suggested speculations, and now and then as\r\nhigh as one thousand shares. I never failed to humor him, for I thought\r\na negative might smack of lack of confidence--a thing I would not think\r\nof, if only for love of Blossom. I must say that my belief in young Van\r\nFlange was augmented by these deals, which turned unflaggingly, though\r\nnever largely, to my credit.\r\n\r\nIt was when I stood waist-deep in what arrangements were preliminary\r\nto my battle for the town, now drawing near and nearer, that young Van\r\nFlange approached me concerning Blackberry Traction.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said he--for he called me “father,” and the name was pleasant\r\nto my ear--“father, if you will, we may make millions of dollars like\r\nturning hand or head.”\r\n\r\nThen he gave me a long story of the friendship he had scraped together\r\nwith the president of Blackberry--he of the Hebrew cast and clutch, whom\r\nI once met and disappointed over franchises.\r\n\r\n“Of course,” said young Van Flange, “while he is the president of\r\nBlackberry, he has no sentimental feelings concerning the fortunes of\r\nthe company. He is as sharp to make money as either you or I. The truth\r\nis this: While the stock is quoted fairly high, Blackberry in fact is\r\nin a bad way. It is like a house of cards, and a kick would collapse it\r\ninto ruins. The president, because we are such intimates, gave me the\r\nwhole truth of Blackberry. Swearing me to secrecy, he, as it were,\r\nlighted a lantern, and led me into the darkest corners. He showed me the\r\nbooks. Blackberry is on the threshold of a crash. The dividends coming\r\ndue will not be paid. It is behind in its interest; and the directors\r\nwill be driven to declare an immense issue of bonds. Blackberry stock\r\nwill fall below twenty; a receiver will have the road within the year.\r\nTo my mind, the situation is ready for a coup. We have but to sell and\r\nkeep selling, to take in what millions we will.”\r\n\r\nThere was further talk, and all to similar purpose. Also, I recalled the\r\nease with which Morton and I, aforetime, took four millions between us\r\nout of Blackberry.\r\n\r\n“Now I think,” said I, in the finish of it, “that Blackberry is my gold\r\nmine by the word of Fate itself. Those we are to make will not be the\r\nfirst riches I've had from it.”\r\n\r\nExcept the house we stood in, I owned no real estate; nor yet that,\r\nsince it was Blossom's, being her marriage gift from me. From the first\r\nI had felt an aversion for houses and lots. I was of no stomach\r\nto collect rents, squabble with tenants over repairs, or race to\r\nmagistrates for eviction. This last I should say was the Irish in my\r\narteries, for landlords had hectored my ancestors like horseflies. My\r\nwealth was all in stocks and bonds; nor would I listen to anything else.\r\nMorton had his own whimsical explanation for this:\r\n\r\n“There be those among us,” said he, “who are nomads by instinct--a sort\r\nof white Arab, don't y' know. Not intending offense--for, gad! there are\r\nreasons why I desire to keep you good-natured--every congenital criminal\r\nis of that sort; he is, really! Such folk instinctively look forward\r\nto migration or flight. They want nothing they can't pack up and depart\r\nwith in a night, and would no more take a deed to land than a dose of\r\narsenic. It's you who are of those migratory people. That's why you\r\nabhor real estate. Fact, old chap! you're a born nomad; and it's in your\r\nblood to be ever ready to strike camp, inspan your teams, and trek.”\r\n\r\nMorton furnished these valuable theories when he was investing my money\r\nfor me. Having no belief in my own investment wisdom, I imposed the task\r\nupon his good nature. One day he brought me my complete possessions in a\r\nwonderful sheaf of securities. They were edged, each and all, with gold,\r\nsince Morton would accept no less.\r\n\r\n“There you are, my boy,” said he, “and everything as clean as running\r\nwater, don't y' know. Really, I didn't think you could be trusted, if\r\nit came on to blow a panic, so I've bought for you only stuff that can\r\nprotect itself.”\r\n\r\nWhen young Van Flange made his Blackberry suggestions, I should say\r\nI had sixteen hundred thousand dollars worth of these bonds and\r\nstocks--mostly the former--in my steel box. I may only guess concerning\r\nit, for I could not reckon so huge a sum to the precise farthing. It was\r\nall in the same house with us; I kept it in a safe I'd fitted into the\r\nwalls, and which was so devised as to laugh at either a burglar or a\r\nfire. I gave young Van Flange the key of that interior compartment which\r\nheld these securities; the general combination he already possessed.\r\n\r\n“There you'll find more than a million and a half,” said I, “and that,\r\nwith what you have, should make three millions. How much Blackberry can\r\nyou sell now?”\r\n\r\n“We ought to sell one hundred and fifty thousand shares. A drop of\r\neighty points, and it will go that far, would bring us in twelve\r\nmillions.”\r\n\r\n“Do what you think best,” said I. “And, mind you: No word to Morton.”\r\n\r\n“Now I was about to suggest that,” said young Van Flange.\r\n\r\nMorton should not know what was on my slate for Blackberry. Trust him?\r\nyes; and with every hope I had. But it was my vanity to make this move\r\nwithout him. I would open his eyes to it, that young Van Flange, if not\r\nso old a sailor as himself, was none the less his equal at charting a\r\ncourse and navigating speculation across that sea of stocks, about the\r\ntreacherous dangers whereof it had pleased him so often to patronize me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV--PROFIT AND LOSS; MAINLY THE LATTER\r\n\r\n\r\nSINCE time began, no man, not even a king, has been better obeyed in\r\nhis mandates, than was I while Chief of Tammany Hall. From high to low,\r\nfrom the leader of a district to the last mean straggler in the ranks,\r\none and all, they pulled and hauled or ran and climbed like sailors in a\r\ngale, at the glance of my eye or the toss of my finger. More often than\r\nonce, I have paused in wonder over this blind submission, and asked\r\nmyself the reason. Particularly, since I laid down my chiefship, the\r\nquery has come upon my tongue while I remembered old days, to consider\r\nhow successes might have been more richly improved or defeats, in their\r\ndisasters, at least partially avoided.\r\n\r\nNor could I give myself the answer. I had no close friendships among my\r\nmen; none of them was my confidant beyond what came to be demanded of\r\nthe business in our hands. On the contrary, there existed a gulf between\r\nme and those about me, and while I was civil--for I am not the man, and\r\nnever was, of wordy violences--I can call myself nothing more.\r\n\r\nIf anything, I should say my people of politics feared me, and that a\r\nsort of sweating terror was the spur to send them flying when I gave an\r\norder. There was respect, too; and in some cases a kind of love like a\r\ndog's love, and which is rather the homage paid by weakness to strength,\r\nor that sentiment offered of the vine to the oak that supports its\r\nclamberings.\r\n\r\nWhy my men should stand in awe of me, I cannot tell. Certainly, I was\r\nmindful of their rights; and, with the final admonitions of Big Kennedy\r\nin my ears, I avoided favoritisms and dealt out justice from an even\r\nhand. True, I could be stern when occasion invited, and was swift to\r\ndestroy that one whose powers did not match his duty, or who for a bribe\r\nwould betray, or for an ambition would oppose, my plan.\r\n\r\nNo; after Big Kennedy's death, I could name you none save Morton\r\nwhose advice I cared for, or towards whom I leaned in any thought\r\nof confidence. Some have said that this distance, which I maintained\r\nbetween me and my underlings, was the secret of my strength. It may have\r\nbeen; and if it were I take no credit, since I expressed nothing save a\r\nloneliness of disposition, and could not have borne myself otherwise\r\nhad I made the attempt. Not that I regretted it. That dumb concession\r\nof themselves to me, by my folk of Tammany, would play no little part\r\nin pulling down a victory in the great conflict wherein we were about to\r\nengage.\r\n\r\nTammany Hall was never more sharply organized. I worked over the\r\nbusiness like an artist over an etching. Discipline was brought to\r\na pitch never before known. My district leaders were the pick of the\r\ncovey, and every one, for force and talents of executive kind, fit to\r\nlead a brigade into battle. Under these were the captains of election\r\nprecincts; and a rank below the latter came the block captains--one for\r\neach city block. Thus were made up those wheels within wheels which,\r\ntaken together, completed the machine. They fitted one with the other,\r\nblock captains with precinct captains, the latter with district leaders,\r\nand these last with myself; and all like the wheels and springs and\r\nratchets and regulators of a clock; one sure, too, when wound and oiled\r\nand started, to strike the hours and announce the time of day in local\r\npolitics with a nicety that owned no precedent.\r\n\r\nThere would be a quartette of tickets; I could see that fact of four\r\ncorners in its approach, long months before the conventions. Besides the\r\ntwo regular parties, and the mugwump-independents--which tribe, like the\r\npoor, we have always with us--the laborites would try again. These had\r\nnot come to the field in any force since that giant uprising when we\r\nbeat them down with the reputable old gentleman. Nor did I fear them\r\nnow. My trained senses told me, as with thumb on wrist I counted\r\nthe public pulse, how those clans of labor were not so formidable by\r\nthree-fourths as on that other day a decade and more before.\r\n\r\nOf those three camps of politics set over against us, that one to be the\r\nstrongest was the party of reform. This knowledge swelled my stock of\r\ncourage, already mounting high. If it were no more than to rout the\r\nadministration now worrying the withers of the town, why, then! the\r\nmachine was safe to win.\r\n\r\nThere arose another sign. As the days ran on, rich and frequent, first\r\nfrom one big corporation and then another--and these do not give until\r\nthey believe--the contributions of money came rolling along. They would\r\nbuy our favor in advance of victory. These donations followed each other\r\nlike billows upon a beach, and each larger than the one before, which\r\nshowed how the wind of general confidence was rising in our favor. It\r\nwas not, therefore, my view alone; but, by this light of money to our\r\ncause, I could see how the common opinion had begun to gather head that\r\nthe machine was to take the town again.\r\n\r\nThis latter is often a decisive point, and one to give victory of\r\nitself. The average of intelligence and integrity in this city of New\r\nYork is lower than any in the land. There are here, in proportion to\r\na vote, more people whose sole principle is the bandwagon, than in any\r\nother town between the oceans. These “sliders,” who go hither and yon,\r\nand attach themselves to this standard or ally themselves with that one,\r\nas the eye of their fancy is caught and taught by some fluttering signal\r\nof the hour to pick the winning side, are enough of themselves to decide\r\na contest. Wherefore, to promote this advertisement among creatures of\r\nchameleon politics, of an approaching triumph for the machine, and it\r\nbeing possible because of those contributed thousands coming so early\r\ninto my chests, I began furnishing funds to my leaders and setting them\r\nto the work of their regions weeks before the nearest of our enemies had\r\nbegun to think on his ticket.\r\n\r\nThere was another argument for putting out this money. The noses of my\r\npeople had been withheld from the cribs of office for hungry months upon\r\nmonths. The money would arouse an appetite and give their teeth an edge.\r\nI looked for fine work, too, since the leanest wolves are ever foremost\r\nin the hunt.\r\n\r\nEmphatically did I lay it upon my leaders that, man for man, they must\r\ncount their districts. They must tell over each voter as a churchman\r\ntells his beads. They must give me a true story of the situation, and I\r\npromised grief to him who brought me mistaken word. I will say in their\r\ncompliment that, by the reports of my leaders on the day before the\r\npoll, I counted the machine majority exact within four hundred votes;\r\nand that, I may tell you, with four tickets in the conflict, and a whole\r\ncount which was measured by hundreds of thousands, is no light affair. I\r\nmention it to evidence the hair-line perfection to which the methods of\r\nthe machine had been brought.\r\n\r\nMore than one leader reported within five votes of his majority, and\r\nnone went fifty votes astray.\r\n\r\nYou think we overdid ourselves to the point ridiculous, in this\r\nbreathless solicitude of preparation? Man! the wealth of twenty Ophirs\r\nhung upon the hazard. I was in no mood to lose, if skill and sleepless\r\nforethought, and every intrigue born of money, might serve to bring\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nMorton--that best of prophets!--believed in the star of the machine.\r\n\r\n“This time,” said he, “I shall miss the agony of contributing to the\r\nother fellows, don't y' know. It will be quite a relief--really! I must\r\nsay, old chap, that I like the mugwump less and less the more I see of\r\nhim. He's so deucedly respectable, for one thing! Gad! there are\r\ntimes when a mugwump carries respectability to a height absolutely\r\nincompatible with human existence. Besides, he is forever walking a\r\ncrack and calling it a principle. I get tired of a chalkline morality.\r\nIt's all such deuced rot; it bores me to death; it does, really! One\r\nbegins to appreciate the amiable, tolerant virtues of easy, old-shoe\r\nvice.”\r\n\r\nMorton, worn with this long harangue, was moved to recruit his moody\r\nenergies with the inevitable cigarette. He puffed recuperative puffs for\r\na space, and then he began:\r\n\r\n“What an angelic ass is this city of New York! Why! it doesn't know as\r\nmuch as a horse! Any ignorant teamster of politics can harness it, and\r\nhaul with it, and head it what way he will. I say, old chap, what are\r\nthe round-number expenses of the town a year?”\r\n\r\n“About one hundred and twenty-five millions.”\r\n\r\n“One hundred and twenty-five millions--really! Do you happen to know the\r\naggregate annual profits of those divers private companies that control\r\nand sell us our water, and lighting, and telephone, and telegraph, and\r\ntraction services?--saying nothing of ferries, and paving, and all that?\r\nIt's over one hundred and fifty millions a year, don't y' know! More\r\nthan enough to run the town without a splinter of tax--really! That's\r\nwhy I exclaim in rapture over the public's accommodating imbecility.\r\nNow, if a private individual were to manage his affairs so much like a\r\nhowling idiot, his heirs would clap him in a padded cell, and serve the\r\nbeggar right.”\r\n\r\n“I think, however,” said I, “that you have been one to profit by those\r\nsame idiocies of the town.”\r\n\r\n“Millions, my boy, millions! And I'm going in for more, don't y' know.\r\nThere are a half-dozen delicious things I have my eye on. Gad! I shall\r\nhave my hand on them, the moment you take control.”\r\n\r\n“I make you welcome in advance,” said I. “Give me but the town again,\r\nand you shall pick and choose.”\r\n\r\nIn season, I handed my slate of names to the nominating committee to be\r\nhanded by them to the convention.\r\n\r\nAt the head, for the post of mayor, was written the name of that bold\r\njudge who, in the presence of my enemies and on a day when I was down,\r\nhad given my Sicilian countenance. Such folk are the choice material\r\nof the machine. Their characters invite the public; while, for their\r\ncourage, and that trick to be military and go with closed eyes to the\r\nexecution of an order, the machine can rely upon them through black and\r\nwhite. My judge when mayor would accept my word for the last appointment\r\nand the last contract in his power, and think it duty.\r\n\r\nAnd who shall say that he would err? It was the law of the machine; he\r\nwas the man of the machine; for the public, which accepted him, he was\r\nthe machine. It is the machine that offers for every office on the list;\r\nthe ticket is but the manner or, if you please, the mask. Nor is this\r\nsecret. Who shall complain then, or fasten him with charges, when my\r\njudge, made mayor, infers a public's instruction to regard himself\r\nas the vizier of the machine?--its hand and voice for the town's\r\ngovernment?\r\n\r\nIt stood the day before the polls, and having advantage of the usual\r\nlull I was resting myself at home. Held fast by the hooks of politics, I\r\nfor weeks had not seen young Van Flange, and had gotten only glimpses of\r\nBlossom. While lounging by my fire--for the day was raw, with a wind off\r\nthe Sound that smelled of winter--young Van Flange drove to the door in\r\na brougham.\r\n\r\nThat a brisk broker should visit his house at an hour when the floor of\r\nthe Exchange was tossing with speculation, would be the thing not looked\r\nfor; but I was too much in a fog of politics, and too ignorant of stocks\r\nbesides, to make the observation. Indeed, I was glad to see the boy,\r\ngreeting him with a trifle more warmth than common.\r\n\r\nNow I thought he gave me his hand with a kind of shiver of reluctance.\r\nThis made me consider. Plainly, he was not at ease as we sat together.\r\nCovering him with the tail of my eye, I could note how his face carried\r\na look, at once timid and malignant.\r\n\r\nI could not read the meaning, and remained silent a while with the mere\r\nriddle of it. Was he ill? The lean yellowness of his cheek, and the dark\r\nabout the hollow eyes, were a hint that way, to which the broken stoop\r\nof the shoulders gave added currency.\r\n\r\nYoung Van Flange continued silent; not, however, in a way to promise\r\nsullenness, but as though his feelings were a gag to him. At last I\r\nthought, with a word of my own, to break the ice.\r\n\r\n“How do you get on with your Blackberry?” said I.\r\n\r\nIt was not that I cared or had the business on the back of my mind; I\r\nwas too much buried in my campaign for that; but Blackberry, with young\r\nVan Flange, was the one natural topic to propose.\r\n\r\nAs I gave him the name of it, he started with the sudden nervousness\r\nof a cat. I caught the hissing intake of his breath, as though a\r\nknife pierced him. What was wrong? I had not looked at the reported\r\nquotations, such things being as Greek to me. Had he lost those\r\nmillions? I could have borne it if he had; the better, perhaps, since I\r\nwas sure in my soul that within two days I would have the town in hand,\r\nand I did not think to find my old paths so overgrown but what I'd make\r\nshift to pick my way to a second fortune.\r\n\r\nI was on the hinge of saying so, when he got possession of himself. Even\r\nat that he spoke lamely, and with a tongue that fumbled for words.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Blackberry!” cried he. Then, after a gulping pause: “That twist\r\nwill work through all right. It has gone a trifle slow, because, by\r\nincredible exertions, the road did pay its dividends. But it's no more\r\nthan a matter of weeks when it will come tumbling.”\r\n\r\nThis, in the beginning, was rambled off with stops and halts, but in the\r\nwind-up it went glibly enough.\r\n\r\nWhat next I would have said, I cannot tell; nothing of moment, one may\r\nbe sure, for my mind was running on other things than Blackberry up or\r\ndown. It was at this point, however, when we were interrupted. A message\r\narrived that asked my presence at headquarters.\r\n\r\nAs I was about to depart, Blossom came into the room.\r\n\r\nI had no more than time for a hurried kiss, for the need set forth in\r\nthe note pulled at me like horses.\r\n\r\n“Bar accidents,” said I, as I stood in the door, “tomorrow night we'll\r\ncelebrate a victory.”\r\n\r\nWithin a block of my gate, I recalled how I had left certain papers I\r\nrequired lying on the table. I went back in some hustle of speed, for\r\ntime was pinching as to that question of political detail which tugged\r\nfor attention.\r\n\r\nAs I stepped into the hallway, I caught the tone of young Van Flange\r\nand did not like the pitch of it. Blossom and he were in the room to the\r\nleft, and only a door between us.\r\n\r\nIn a strange bristle of temper, I stood still to hear. Would the\r\nscoundrel dare harshness with my girl? The very surmise turned me savage\r\nto the bone!\r\n\r\nYoung Van Flange was speaking of those two hundred thousand dollars in\r\nbonds with which, by word of Big Kennedy, I had endowed Blossom in a day\r\nof babyhood. When she could understand, I had laid it solemnly upon her\r\nnever to part with them. Under any stress, they would insure her against\r\nwant; they must never be given up. And Blossom had promised.\r\n\r\nThese bonds were in a steel casket of their own, and Blossom had the\r\nkey. As I listened, young Van Flange was demanding they be given to\r\nhim; Blossom was pleading with him, and quoting my commands. My girl was\r\nsobbing, too, for the villain urged the business roughly. I could not\r\nfit my ear to every word, since their tones for the most were dulled to\r\na murmur by the door. In the end, with a lift of the voice, I heard him\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n“For what else should I marry you except money? Is one of my blood to\r\nlink himself with the daughter of the town's great thief, and call it\r\nlove? The daughter of a murderer, too!” he exclaimed, and ripping out\r\nan oath. “A murderer, yes! You have the red proof about your throat!\r\nBecause your father escaped hanging by the laws of men, heaven's law is\r\nhanging you!”\r\n\r\nAs I threw wide the door, Blossom staggered and fell to the floor. I\r\nthought for the furious blink of the moment, that he had struck her.\r\nHow much stronger is hate than love! My dominant impulse was to avenge\r\nBlossom rather than to save her. I stood in the door in a white flame\r\nof wrath that was like the utter anger of a tiger. I saw him bleach and\r\nshrink beneath his sallowness.\r\n\r\nAs I came towards him, he held up his hands after the way of a boxing\r\nschool. That ferocious strength, like a gorilla's, still abode with me.\r\nI brushed away his guard as one might put aside a trailing vine. In a\r\nflash I had him, hip and shoulder. My fingers sunk into the flesh like\r\nthings of steel; he squeaked and struggled as does the rabbit when\r\ncrunched up by the hound.\r\n\r\nWith a swing and a heave that would have torn out a tree by its roots,\r\nI lifted him from his feet. The next moment I hurled him from me. He\r\ncrashed against the casing of the door; then he slipped to the floor as\r\nthough struck by death itself.\r\n\r\nMoved of the one blunt purpose of destruction, I made forward to seize\r\nhim again. For a miracle of luck, I was withstood by one of the servants\r\nwho rushed in.\r\n\r\n“Think, master; think what you do!” he cried.\r\n\r\nIn a sort of whirl I looked about me. I could see how the old Galway\r\nnurse was bending over Blossom, crying on her for her “Heart's dearie!”\r\n My poor girl was lying along the rug like some tempest-broken flower.\r\nThe stout old wife caught her up and bore her off in her arms.\r\n\r\nThe picture of my girl's white face set me ablaze again. I turned the\r\nvery torch of rage!\r\n\r\n“Be wise, master!” cried that one who had restrained me before. “Think\r\nof what you do!”\r\n\r\nThe man's hand on my wrist, and the earnest voice of him, brought me to\r\nmyself. A vast calm took me, as a storm in its double fury beats flat\r\nthe surface of the sea. I turned my back and walked to the window.\r\n\r\n“Have him away, then!” cried I. “Have him out of my sight, or I'll tear\r\nhim to rags and ribbons where he lies!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI--THE VICTOR AND THE SPOILS\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR all the cry and call of politics, and folk to see me whom I would\r\nnot see, that night, and throughout the following day--and even though\r\nthe latter were one of election Fate to decide for the town's mastery--I\r\nnever stirred from Blossom's side. She, poor child! was as one desolate,\r\ndazed with the blow that had been dealt her. She lay on her pillow,\r\nsilent, and with the stricken face that told of the heart-blight fallen\r\nupon her.\r\n\r\nNor was I in much more enviable case, although gifted of a rougher\r\nstrength to meet the shock. Indeed, I was taught by a despair that\r\npreyed upon me, how young Van Flange had grown to be the keystone of my\r\narch of single hope, now fallen to the ground. Blossom's happiness had\r\nbeen my happiness, and when her breast was pierced, my own brightness\r\nof life began to bleed away. Darkness took me in the folds of it as in\r\na shroud; I would have found the grave kinder, but I must remain to be\r\nwhat prop and stay I might to Blossom.\r\n\r\nWhile I sat by my girl's bed, there was all the time a peril that kept\r\nplucking at my sleeve in a way of warning. My nature is of an inveterate\r\nkind that, once afire and set to angry burning, goes on and on in\r\never increasing flames like a creature of tow, and with me helpless to\r\nsmother or so much as half subdue the conflagration. I was so aware\r\nof myself in that dangerous behalf that it would press upon me as a\r\nconviction, even while I held my girl's hand and looked into her vacant\r\neye, robbed of a last ray of any peace to come, that young Van Flange\r\nmust never stray within my grasp. It would bring down his destruction;\r\nit would mean red hands for me and nothing short of murder. And, so,\r\nwhile I waited by Blossom's side, and to blot out the black chance of\r\nit, I sent word for Inspector McCue.\r\n\r\nThe servants, on that day of awful misery, conveyed young Van Flange\r\nfrom the room. When he had been revived, and his injuries dressed--for\r\nhis head bled from a gash made by the door, and his shoulder had been\r\ndislocated--he was carried from the house by the brougham that brought\r\nhim, and which still waited at the gate. No one about me owned word of\r\nhis whereabouts. It was required that he be found, not more for his sake\r\nthan my own, and his destinies disposed of beyond my reach.\r\n\r\nIt was to this task I would set Inspector McCue. For once in a way, my\r\ncall was for an honest officer. I would have Inspector McCue discover\r\nyoung Van Flange, and caution him out of town. I cared not where he\r\nwent, so that he traveled beyond the touch of my fingers, already\r\nitching for the caitiff neck of him.\r\n\r\nNor did I think young Van Flange would resist the advice of Inspector\r\nMcCue. He had reasons for flight other than those I would furnish. The\r\nvery papers, shouted in the streets to tell how I had re-taken the town\r\nat the polls, told also of the failure of the brokerage house of Van\r\nFlange; and that young Van Flange, himself, was a defaulter and his\r\narrest being sought by clients on a charge of embezzling the funds which\r\nhad been intrusted to his charge. The man was a fugitive from justice;\r\nhe lay within the menace of a prison; he would make no demur now when\r\nword and money were given him to take himself away.\r\n\r\nWhen Inspector McCue arrived, I greeted him with face of granite. He\r\nshould have no hint of my agony. I went bluntly to the core of the\r\nemploy; to dwell upon the business would be nothing friendly to my\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n“You know young Van Flange?” Inspector McCue gave a nod of assent.\r\n\r\n“And you can locate him?”\r\n\r\n“The proposition is so easy it's a pushover.”\r\n\r\n“Find him, then, and send him out of the town; and for a reason, should\r\nhe ask one, you may say that I shall slay him should we meet.”\r\n\r\nInspector McCue looked at me curiously. He elevated his brow, but in the\r\nend he said nothing, whether of inquiry or remark. Without a reply he\r\ntook himself away. My face, at the kindliest, was never one to speak of\r\nconfidences or invite a question, and I may suppose the expression of\r\nit, as I dealt with Inspector McCue, to have been more than commonly\r\nrepellent.\r\n\r\nThere abode another with whom I wanted word; that one was Morton; for\r\nhard by forty years he had not once failed me in a strait. I would ask\r\nhim the story of those Blackberry stocks. A glance into my steel box had\r\nshowed me the bottom as bare as winter boughs. The last scrap was\r\ngone; and no more than the house that covered us, and those two hundred\r\nthousand dollars in bonds that were Blossom's, to be left of all our\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nMy temper was not one to mourn for any loss of money; and yet in this\r\ninstance I would have those steps that led to my destruction set forth\r\nto me. If it were the president of Blackberry Traction who had taken\r\nmy money, I meditated reprisal. Not that I fell into any heat of hatred\r\nagainst him; he but did to me what Morton and I a few years further back\r\nhad portioned out to him. For all that, I was coldly resolved to have my\r\nown again. I intended no stock shifts; I would not seek Wall Street for\r\nmy revenge. I knew a sharper method and a surer. It might glisten less\r\nwith elegance, but it would prove more secure. But first, I would have\r\nthe word of Morton.\r\n\r\nThat glass of exquisite fashion and mold of proper form, albeit\r\nsomething grizzled, and like myself a trifle dimmed of time, tendered\r\nhis congratulations upon my re-conquest of the town. I drew him straight\r\nto my affair of Blackberry.\r\n\r\n“Really, old chap,” said Morton, the while plaintively disapproving of\r\nme through those eyeglasses, so official in his case, “really, old\r\nchap, you walked into a trap, and one a child should have seen. That\r\nBlackberry fellow had the market rigged, don't y' know. I could have\r\nsaved you, but, my boy, I didn't dare. You've such a beastly temper when\r\nanyone saves you. Besides, it isn't good form to wander into the stock\r\ndeals of a gentleman, and begin to tell him what he's about; it isn't,\r\nreally.”\r\n\r\n“But what did this Blackberry individual do?” I persisted.\r\n\r\n“Why, he let you into a corner, don't y' know! He had been quietly\r\nbuying Blackberry for months. He had the whole stock of the road in his\r\nsafe; and you, in the most innocent way imaginable, sold thousands of\r\nshares. Now when you sell a stock, you must buy; you must, really! And\r\nthere was no one from whom to buy save our sagacious friend. Gad! as the\r\nbusiness stood, old chap, he might have had the coat off your back!” And\r\nMorton glared in horror over the disgrace of the situation.\r\n\r\nWhile I took no more than a glimmer of Morton's meaning, two things were\r\nmade clear. The Blackberry president had stripped me of my millions; and\r\nhe had laid a snare to get them.\r\n\r\n“Was young Van Flange in the intrigue?”\r\n\r\n“Not in the beginning, at least. There was no need, don't y' know. His\r\nhand was already into your money up to the elbow.”\r\n\r\n“What do you intend by saying that young Van Flange was not in the\r\naffair in the beginning?”\r\n\r\n“The fact is, old chap, one or two things occurred that led me to think\r\nthat young Van Flange discovered the trap after he'd sold some eight or\r\nten thousand shares. There was a halt, don't y' know, in his operations.\r\nThen later he went on and sold you into bankruptcy. I took it from\r\nyoung Van Flange's manner that the Blackberry fellow might have had some\r\nsecret hold upon him, and either threatened him, or promised him, or\r\nperhaps both, to get him to go forward with his sales; I did, really.\r\nYoung Van Flange didn't, in the last of it, conduct himself like a free\r\nmoral or, I should say, immoral agent.”\r\n\r\n“I can't account for it,” said I, falling into thought; “I cannot\r\nsee how young Van Flange could have been betrayed into the folly you\r\ndescribe.”\r\n\r\n“Why then,” said Morton, a bit wearily, “I have but to say over what\r\nyou've heard from me before. Young Van Flange was in no sort that man of\r\ngifts you held him to be; now really, he wasn't, don't y' know! Anyone\r\nmight have hoodwinked him. Besides, he didn't keep up with the markets.\r\nWhile I think it beastly bad form to go talking against a chap when he's\r\nabsent, the truth is, the weak-faced beggar went much more to Barclay\r\nthan to Wall Street. However, that is only hearsay; I didn't follow\r\nyoung Van Flange to Barclay Street nor meet him across a faro layout by\r\nway of verification.”\r\n\r\nMorton was right; and I was to hear a worse tale, and that from\r\nInspector McCue.\r\n\r\n“Would have been here before,” said Inspector McCue when he came to\r\nreport, “but I wanted to see our party aboard ship, and outside Sandy\r\nHook light, so that I might report the job cleaned up.”\r\n\r\nThen clearing his throat, and stating everything in the present tense,\r\nafter the police manner, Inspector McCue went on.\r\n\r\n“When you ask me can I locate our party, I says to myself, 'Sure thing!'\r\nand I'll put you on to why. Our party is a dope fiend; it's a horse to a\r\nhen at that very time he can be turned up in some Chink joint.”\r\n\r\n“Opium?” I asked in astonishment. I had never harbored the thought.\r\n\r\n“Why, sure! That's the reason he shows so sallow about the gills, and\r\nwith eyes like holes burnt in a blanket. When he lets up on the bottle,\r\nhe shifts to hop.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Now,” continued Inspector McCue, “I thought I knew the joint in which\r\nto find our party. One evenin', three or four years ago, when the\r\nReverend Bronson and I are lookin' up those Barclay Street crooks, I see\r\nour party steerin' into Mott Street. I goes after him, and comes upon\r\nhim in a joint where he's hittin' the pipe. The munk who runs it has\r\njust brought him a layout, and is cookin' the pill for him when I shoves\r\nin.\r\n\r\n“Now when our party is in present trouble, I puts it to myself, that\r\nhe's sure to be goin' against the pipe. It would be his idea of gettin'\r\ncheerful, see! So I chases for the Mott Street hang-out, and there's our\r\nparty sure enough, laid out on a mat, and a roll of cotton batting under\r\nhis head for a pillow. He's in the skies, so my plan for a talk right\r\nthen is all off. The air of the place is that thick with hop it would\r\nhave turned the point of a knife, but I stays and plays my string out\r\nuntil he can listen and talk.\r\n\r\n“When our party's head is again on halfway straight, and he isn't such a\r\ndizzy Willie, I puts it to him that he'd better do a skulk.\r\n\r\n“'You're wanted,' says I, 'an' as near as I make the size-up, you'll\r\ntake about five spaces if you're brought to trial. You'd better chase;\r\nand by way of the Horn, at that. If you go cross-lots, you might get\r\nthe collar on a hot wire from headquarters, and be taken off the train.\r\nOur party nearly throws a faint when I says 'embezzlement.' It's the\r\nfirst tip he'd had, for I don't think he's been made wise to so much as\r\na word since he leaves here. It put the scare into him for fair; he was\r\nready to do anything I say.'\r\n\r\n“'Only,' says he, 'I don't know what money I've got. And I'm too dippy\r\nto find out.'\r\n\r\n“With that, I go through him. It's in his trousers pocket I springs a\r\nplant--fifteen hundred dollars, about.\r\n\r\n“'Here's dough enough and over,' says I; and in six hours after, he's\r\naboard ship.\r\n\r\n“She don't get her lines off until this morning, though; but I stays by,\r\nfor I'm out to see him safe beyond the Hook.”\r\n\r\n“What more do you know of young Van Flange?” I asked. “Did you learn\r\nanything about his business habits?”\r\n\r\n“From the time you start him with those offices in Broad Street, our\r\nparty's business habits are hop and faro bank. The offices are there;\r\nthe clerks and the blackboards and the stock tickers and the tape\r\nbaskets are there; but our party, more'n to butt in about three times\r\na week and leave some crazy orders to sell Blackberry Traction, is never\r\nthere. He's either in Mott Street, and a Chink cookin' hop for him;\r\nor he's in Barclay Street with those Indians, and they handin' him out\r\nevery sort of brace from an 'end-squeeze' or a 'balance-top,' where they\r\ngive him two cards at a clatter, to a 'snake' box, where they kindly\r\nlets him deal, but do him just the same. Our party lose over a\r\nhalf-million in that Barclay Street deadfall during the past Year.”\r\n\r\n“I must, then,” said I, and I felt the irony of it, “have been\r\nindirectly contributing to the riches of our friend, the Chief of\r\nPolice, since you once told me he was a principal owner of the Barclay\r\nStreet place.”\r\n\r\nInspector McCue shrugged his shoulders professionally, and made no\r\nresponse. Then I questioned him as to the charge of embezzlement; for I\r\nhad not owned the heart to read the story in the press.\r\n\r\n“It's that Blackberry push,” replied Inspector McCue, “and I don't think\r\nit's on the level at that. It looks like the Blackberry president--and,\r\nby the way, I've talked with the duffer, and took in all he would\r\ntell--made a play to get the drop on our party. And although the trick\r\nwas put up, I think he landed it. He charges now that our party is a\r\nwelcher, and gets away with a bunch of bonds--hocked 'em or something\r\nlike that--which this Blackberry guy gives him to stick in as margins\r\non some deal. As I say, I think it's a put-up job. That Blackberry\r\nduck--who is quite a flossy form of stock student and a long shot from\r\na slouch--has some game up his sleeve. He wanted things rigged so's he\r\ncould put the clamps on our party, and make him do as he says, and pinch\r\nhim whenever it gets to be a case of must. So he finally gets our party\r\nwhere he can't holler. I makes a move to find out the inside story; but\r\nthe Blackberry sport is a thought too swift, and he won't fall to my\r\ngame. I gives it to him dead that he braced our party, and asks him,\r\nWhy? At that he hands me the frozen face, springs a chest, and says he's\r\ninsulted.\r\n\r\n“But the end of it is this: Our party is now headed for Frisco. When he\r\ncomes ashore, the cops out there will pick him up and keep a tab on him;\r\nwe can always touch the wire for his story down to date. Whenever you\r\nsay the word, I can get a line on him.”\r\n\r\n“Bring me no tales of him!” I cried. “I would free myself of every\r\nmemory of the scoundrel!”\r\n\r\nThat, then, was the story--a story of gambling and opium! It was these\r\nthat must account for the sallow face, stooped shoulders, hollow eyes,\r\nand nights away from home. And the man of Blackberry, from whom Morton\r\nand I took millions, had found in the situation his opportunity. He laid\r\nhis plans and had those millions back. Also, it was I, as it had been\r\nothers, to now suffer by Barclay Street.\r\n\r\n“And now,” observed Inspector McCue, his hand on the door, but turning\r\nwith a look at once inquisitive and wistful--the latter, like the\r\nanxious manner of a good dog who asks word to go upon his hunting--“and\r\nnow, I suppose, you'll be willin' to let me pull that outfit in Barclay\r\nStreet. I've got 'em dead to rights!” The last hopefully.\r\n\r\n“If it be a question,” said I, “of where a man shall lose His money, for\r\nmy own part, I have no preference as to whether he is robbed in Barclay\r\nStreet or robbed in Wall. We shall let the Barclay Street den alone, if\r\nyou please. The organization has its alliances. These alliances cannot\r\nbe disturbed without weakening the organization. I would not make the\r\norder when it was prayed for by the mother of young Van Flange, and she\r\ndied with the prayer on her lips. I shall not make it now when it is I\r\nwho am the sufferer. It must be Tammany before all; on no slighter terms\r\ncan Tammany be preserved.”\r\n\r\nInspector McCue made no return to this, and went his way in silence. It\r\nwas a change, however, from that other hour when I had been with him\r\nas cold and secret as a vault. He felt the flattery of my present\r\nconfidence, and it colored him with complacency as he took his leave.\r\n\r\nRoundly, it would be two months after the election before Tammany took\r\ncharge of the town. The eight weeks to intervene I put in over that list\r\nof officers to be named by me through the mayor and the various chiefs\r\nof the departments. These places--and they were by no means a stinted\r\nletter, being well-nigh thirty thousand--must be apportioned among the\r\ndistricts, each leader having his just share.\r\n\r\nWhile I wrought at these details of patronage, setting a man's name to a\r\nplace, and all with fine nicety of discrimination to prevent jealousies\r\nand a thought that this or that one of my wardogs had been wronged, a\r\nplan was perfecting itself in my mind. The thought of Blossom was ever\r\nuppermost. What should I do to save the remainder of her life in peace?\r\nIf she were not to be wholly happy, still I would buckler her as far as\r\nlay with me against the more aggressive darts of grief. There is such a\r\nword as placid, and, though one be fated to dwell with lasting sorrow,\r\none would prefer it as the mark of one's condition to others of\r\ntumultuous violence. There lies a choice, and one will make it, even\r\namong torments. How could I conquer serenity for Blossom?--how should\r\nI go about it to invest what further years were hers with the restful\r\nblessings of peace? That was now the problem of my life, and at last I\r\nthought it solved.\r\n\r\nMy decision was made to deal with the town throughout the next regime\r\nas with a gold mine. I would work it night and day, sparing neither\r\nconscience nor sleep; I would have from it what utmost bulk of treasure\r\nI might during the coming administration of the town's affairs. The game\r\nlay in my palm; I would think on myself and nothing but myself; justice\r\nand right were to be cast aside; the sufferings of others should be no\r\nmore to me than mine had been to them. I would squeeze the situation\r\nlike a sponge, and for its last drop. Then laying down my guiding staff\r\nas Chief, I would carry Blossom, and those riches I had heaped together,\r\nto regions, far away and new, where only the arch of gentle skies should\r\nbend above her days! She should have tranquillity! she should find rest!\r\nThat was my plan, my hope; I kept it buried in my breast, breathed of it\r\nto no man, not even the kindly Morton, and set myself with all of that\r\nferocious industry which was so much the badge of my nature to its\r\ncarrying forth. Four years; and then, with the gold of a Monte Cristo,\r\nI would take Blossom and go seeking that repose which I believed must\r\nsurely wait for us somewhere beneath the sun!\r\n\r\nWhile I was engaged about those preliminaries demanded of me if the\r\nmachine were to begin its four-years' reign on even terms of comfort,\r\nMorton was often at my shoulder with a point or a suggestion. I was glad\r\nto have him with me; for his advice in a fog of difficulty such as mine,\r\nwas what chart and lighthouse are to mariners.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon while Morton and I were trying to hit upon some man of\r\neducation to take second place and supplement the ignorance of one\r\nwhom the equities of politics appointed to be the head of a rich but\r\ndifficult department, the Reverend Bronson came in.\r\n\r\nWe three--the Reverend Bronson, Morton, and myself--were older now than\r\non days we could remember, and each showed the sere and yellow of his\r\nyears. But we liked each other well; and, although in no sort similar\r\nin either purpose or bent, I think time had made us nearer friends than\r\nmight have chanced with many who were more alike.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, while I engaged myself with lists of names and lists\r\nof offices, weighing out the spoils, Morton and the Reverend Bronson\r\ndebated the last campaign, and what in its conclusion it offered for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n“I shall try to be the optimist,” said the Reverend Bronson at last,\r\ntossing up a brave manner. “Since the dying administration was not so\r\ngood as I hoped for, I trust the one to be born will not be so bad as I\r\nfear. And, as I gather light by experience, I begin to blame officials\r\nless and the public more. I suspect how a whole people may play the\r\nhypocrite as much as any single man; nor am I sure that, for all its\r\nclamors, a New York public really desires those white conditions of\r\npurity over which it protests so much.”\r\n\r\n“Really!” returned Morton, who had furnished ear of double interest to\r\nthe Reverend Bronson's words, “it is an error, don't y' know, to give\r\nany people a rule they don't desire. A government should always match a\r\npublic. What do you suppose would become of them if one were to suddenly\r\norganize a negro tribe of darkest Africa into a republic? Why, under\r\nsuch loose rule as ours, the poor savage beggars would gnaw each other\r\nlike dogs--they would, really! It would be as depressing a solecism as a\r\nScotchman among the stained glasses, the frescoes, and the Madonnas of\r\na Spanish cathedral; or a Don worshiping within the four bare walls and\r\nroof of a Highland kirk. Whatever New York may pretend, it will always\r\nbe found in possession of that sort of government, whether for virtue\r\nor for vice, whereof it secretly approves.” And Morton surveyed the good\r\ndominie through that historic eyeglass as though pleased with what he'd\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“But is it not humiliating?” asked the Reverend Bronson. “If what you\r\nsay be true, does it not make for your discouragement?”\r\n\r\n“No more than does the vulgar fact of dogs and horses, don't y' know!\r\nReally, I take life as it is, and think only to be amused. I remark\r\non men, and upon their conditions of the moral, the mental, and the\r\nphysical!--on the indomitable courage of restoration as against the\r\nceaseless industry of decay!--on the high and the low, the good and the\r\nbad, the weak and the strong, the right and the wrong, the top and the\r\nbottom, the past and the future, the white and the black, and all those\r\nother things that are not!--and I laugh at all. There is but one thing\r\nreal, one thing true, one thing important, one thing at which I\r\nnever laugh!--and that is the present. But really!” concluded Morton,\r\nrecurring to affectations which for the moment had been forgot, “I'm\r\nnever discouraged, don't y' know! I shall never permit myself an\r\ninterest deep enough for that; it wouldn't be good form. Even those\r\nbeastly low standards which obtain, as you say, in New York do not\r\ndiscourage me. No, I'm never discouraged--really!”\r\n\r\n“You do as much as any, by your indifference, to perpetuate those\r\nstandards,” remarked the Reverend Bronson in a way of mournful severity.\r\n\r\n“My dear old chap,” returned Morton, growing sprightly as the other\r\ndisplayed solemnity, “I take, as I tell you, conditions as I find them,\r\ndon't y' know! And wherefore no? It's all nature: it's the hog to\r\nits wallow, the eagle to its crag;--it is, really! Now an eagle in a\r\nmud-wallow, or a hog perching on a crag, would be deuced bad form!\r\nYou see that yourself, you must--really!” and our philosopher glowered\r\nsweetly.\r\n\r\n“I shall never know,” said the Reverend Bronson, with a half-laugh,\r\n“when to have you seriously. I cannot but wish, however, that the town\r\nhad better luck about its City Hall.”\r\n\r\n“Really, I don't know, don't y' know!” This deep observation Morton\r\nflourished off in a profound muse. “As I've said, the town will get\r\nwhat's coming to it, because it will always get what it wants. It always\r\nhas--really! And speaking of 'reform' as we employ the term in politics:\r\nThe town, in honesty, never desires it; and that's why somebody must\r\nforever attend on 'reform' to keep it from falling on its blundering\r\nnose and knees by holding it up by the tail. There are people who'll\r\ntake anything you give them, even though it be a coat of tar and\r\nfeathers, and thank you for it, too,--the grateful beggars! New York\r\nresembles these. Some chap comes along, and offers New York 'reform.'\r\nBeing without 'reform' at the time, and made suddenly and sorrowfully\r\nmindful of its condition, it accepts the gift just as a drunkard takes a\r\npledge. Like the drunkard, however, New York is apt to return to its old\r\nways--it is, really!”\r\n\r\n“One thing,” said the Reverend Bronson as he arose to go, and laying\r\nhis hand on my shoulder, “since the Boss of Tammany, in a day of the\r\nmachine, is the whole government and the source of it, I mean to come\r\nhere often and work upon our friend in favor of a clean town.”\r\n\r\n“And you will be welcome, Doctor, let me say!” I returned.\r\n\r\n“Now I think,” said Morton meditatively, when the Reverend Bronson had\r\ndeparted, “precisely as I told our excellent friend. A rule should ever\r\nfit a people; and it ever does. A king is as naturally the blossom of\r\nthe peasantry he grows on as is a sunflower natural to that coarse\r\nstem that supports its royal nod-dings, don't y' know. A tyranny, a\r\ndespotism, a monarchy, or a republic is ever that flower of government\r\nnatural to the public upon which it grows. Really!--Why not? Wherein\r\nlurks the injustice or the inconsistency of such a theory? What good\r\nis there to lie hidden in a misfit? Should Providence waste a man's\r\ngovernment on a community of dogs? A dog public should have dog\r\ngovernment:--a kick and a kennel, a chain to clank and a bone to gnaw!”\r\n\r\nWith this last fragment of wisdom, the cynical Morton went also his way,\r\nleaving me alone to chop up the town--as a hunter chops up the carcass\r\nof a deer among his hounds--into steak and collop to feed my hungry\r\nfollowers.\r\n\r\nHowever much politics might engage me, I still possessed those hundred\r\neyes of Argus wherewith to watch my girl. When again about me she had no\r\nword for what was past. And on my side, never once did I put to her the\r\nname of young Van Flange. He was as much unmentioned by us as though he\r\nhad not been. I think that this was the wiser course. What might either\r\nBlossom or I have said to mend our shattered hopes?\r\n\r\nStill, I went not without some favor of events. There came a support to\r\nmy courage; the more welcome, since the latter was often at its ebb. It\r\nwas a strangest thing at that! While Blossom moved with leaden step, and\r\nwould have impressed herself upon one as weak and wanting sparkle, she\r\nnone the less began to gather the color of health. Her cheeks, before\r\nof the pallor of snow, wore a flush like the promise of life. Her face\r\ngained rounder fullness, while her eyes opened upon one with a kind of\r\nwide brilliancy, that gave a look of gayety. It was like a blessing! Nor\r\ncould I forbear, as I witnessed it, the dream of a better strength for\r\nmy girl than it had been her luck to know; and that thought would set me\r\nto my task of money-getting with ever a quicker ardor.\r\n\r\nStill, as I've said, there was the side to baffle. For all those roses\r\nand eyes like stars, Blossom's breath was broken and short, and a little\r\ntrip upstairs or down exhausted her to the verge of pain. To mend her\r\nbreathing after one of these small household expeditions, she must find\r\na chair, or even lie on a couch. All this in its turn would have set my\r\nfears to a runaway if it had not been for that fine glow in her cheeks\r\nto each time restore me to my faith.\r\n\r\nWhen I put the question born of my uneasiness, Blossom declared herself\r\nquite well, nor would she give me any sicklier word. In the end my fears\r\nwould go back to their slumbers, and I again bend myself wholly to that\r\ntask of gold.\r\n\r\nGood or bad, to do this was when all was said the part of complete\r\nwisdom. There could be nothing now save my plan of millions and a final\r\npilgrimage in quest of peace. That was our single chance; and at it, in\r\na kind of savage silence, night and day I stormed as though warring with\r\nwalls and battlements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII--GOLD CAME, AND DEATH STEPPED IN\r\n\r\n\r\nNOW, when I went about refurnishing my steel box with new millions, I\r\nturned cautious as a fox. I considered concealment, and would hide my\r\ntrail and walk in all the running water that I might. For one matter,\r\nI was sick and sore with the attacks made upon me by the papers, which\r\ngrew in malignant violence as the days wore on, and as though it were\r\na point of rivalry between them which should have the black honor of\r\nhating me the most. I preferred to court those type-cudgelings as little\r\nas stood possible, and still bring me to my ends.\r\n\r\nThe better to cover myself, and because the mere work of it would be too\r\nweary a charge for one head and that head ignorant of figures, I called\r\ninto my service a cunning trio who were, one and all, born children\r\nof the machine. These three owned thorough training as husbandmen of\r\npolitics, and were ones to mow even the fence corners. That profit of\r\nthe game which escaped them must indeed be sly, and lie deep and close\r\nbesides. Also, they were of the invaluable brood that has no tongue, and\r\nany one of the triangle would have been broken upon the wheel without a\r\nsyllable of confession disgracing his lips.\r\n\r\nThese inveterate ones, who would be now as my hand in gathering together\r\nthat wealth which I anticipated, were known in circles wherein they\r\nmoved and had their dingy being, as Sing Sing Jacob, Puffy the Merchant,\r\nand Paddy the Priest. Paddy the Priest wore a look of sanctity, and it\r\nwas this impression of holiness to confer upon him his title. It might\r\nhave been more consistent with those virtues of rapine dominant of\r\nhis nature, had he been hailed Paddy the Pirate, instead. Of Sing Sing\r\nJacob, I should say, that he had not served in prison. His name was\r\ngiven him because, while he was never granted the privilege of stripes\r\nand irons, he often earned the same. In what manner or at what font\r\nPuffy the Merchant received baptism, I never learned. That he came\r\nfit for my purpose would find sufficient indication in a complaining\r\ncompliment which Paddy the Priest once paid him, and who said in\r\ndescription of Puffy's devious genius, that if one were to drive a nail\r\nthrough his head it would come forth a corkscrew.\r\n\r\nThese men were to be my personal lieutenants, and collect my gold for\r\nme. And since they would pillage me with as scanty a scruple as though\r\nI were the foe himself, I must hit upon a device for invoking them to\r\nhonesty in ny affairs. It was then I remembered the parting words of\r\nBig Kennedy. I would set one against the others; hating each other,\r\nthey would watch; and each would be sharp with warning in my ear should\r\neither of his fellows seek to fill a purse at my expense.\r\n\r\nTo sow discord among my three offered no difficulties; I had but to say\r\nto one what the others told of him, and his ire was on permanent end. It\r\nwas thus I separated them; and since I gave each his special domain\r\nof effort, while they worked near enough to one another to maintain a\r\nwatch, they were not so thrown together as to bring down among them open\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIt will be required that I set forth in half-detail those various\r\nmunicipal fields and meadows that I laid out in my time, and from which\r\nthe machine was to garner its harvest. You will note then, you who are\r\ninnocent of politics in its practical expressions and rewards, how\r\nthe town stood to me as does his plowlands to a farmer, and offered\r\nas various a list of crops to careful tillage. Take for example the\r\nknee-deep clover of the tax department. Each year there was made a whole\r\nvaluation of personal property of say roundly nine billions of dollars.\r\nThis estimate, within a dozen weeks of its making, would be reduced\r\nto fewer than one billion, on the word of individuals who made the\r\nlaw-required oaths. No, it need not have been so reduced; but the\r\nreduction ever occurred since the machine instructed its tax officers to\r\nact on the oath so furnished, and that without question.\r\n\r\nThat personage in tax peril was never put to fret in obtaining one to\r\nmake the oath. If he himself lacked hardihood and hesitated at perjury,\r\nwhy then, the town abounded in folk of a daring easy veracity. Of all\r\nthat was said and written, of that time, in any New York day, full\r\nninety-five per cent, was falsehood or mistake. Among the members of\r\na community, so affluent of error and mendacity, one would not long go\r\nseeking a witness who was ready, for shining reasons, to take whatever\r\noath might be demanded. And thus it befell that the affidavits were\r\never made, and a reduction of eight billions and more, in the assessed\r\nvaluation of personal property, came annually to be awarded. With a\r\ntax levy of, say, two per cent. I leave you to fix the total of those\r\nmillions saved to ones assessed, and also to consider how far their\r\ngratitude might be expected to inure to the yellow welfare of the\r\nmachine--the machine that makes no gift of either its forbearance or its\r\nhelp!\r\n\r\nSpeaking in particular of the town, and what opportunities of riches\r\nswung open to the machine, one should know at the start how the whole\r\nannual expense of the community was roughly one hundred and twenty-five\r\nmillions. Of these millions twenty went for salaries to officials; forty\r\nwere devoted to the purchase of supplies asked for by the public needs;\r\nwhile the balance, sixty-five millions, represented contracts for paving\r\nand building and similar construction whatnot, which the town was bound\r\nto execute in its affairs.\r\n\r\nAgainst those twenty millions of salaries, the machine levied an annual\r\nprivate five per cent. Two-thirds of the million to arise therefrom,\r\nfound their direct way to district leaders; the other one-third was\r\npaid into the general coffer. Also there were county officers, such\r\nas judges, clerks of court, a sheriff and his deputies: and these,\r\nlikewise, were compelled from their incomes to a yearly generosity of\r\nnot fewer than five per cent.\r\n\r\nOf those forty millions which were the measure for supplies, one-fifth\r\nunder the guise of “commissions” went to the machine; while of the\r\nsixty-five millions, which represented the yearly contracts in payments\r\nmade thereon, the machine came better off with, at the leanest of\r\nestimates, full forty per cent, of the whole.\r\n\r\nNow I have set forth to you those direct returns which arose from the\r\nsure and fixed expenses of the town. Beyond that, and pushing for\r\nthe furthest ounce of tallow, I inaugurated a novelty. I organized a\r\nguaranty company which made what bonds the law demanded from officials;\r\nand from men with contracts, and those others who furnished the town's\r\nsupplies. The annual charge of the company for this act of warranty\r\nwas two per cent, on the sum guaranteed; and since the aggregate\r\nthus carried came to about one hundred millions, the intake from\r\nsuch sources--being for the most part profit in the fingers of the\r\nmachine--was annually a fair two millions. There were other rills to\r\nflow a revenue, and which were related to those money well-springs\r\nregistered above, but they count too many and too small for mention\r\nhere, albeit the round returns from them might make a poor man stare.\r\n\r\nOf those other bottom-lands of profit which bent a nodding harvest\r\nto the sickle of the machine, let me make a rough enumeration. The\r\nreturns--a bit sordid, these!--from poolrooms, faro banks and disorderly\r\nresorts and whereon the monthly charge imposed for each ran all the way\r\nfrom fifty to two thousand dollars, clinked into the yearly till, four\r\nmillions. The grog shops, whereof at that time there was a staggering\r\nhost of such in New York City of-the-many-sins! met each a draft of\r\ntwenty monthly dollars. Then one should count “campaign contributions.”\r\n Of great companies who sued for favor there were, at a lowest census,\r\nfive who sent as tribute from twenty to fifty thousand dollars each.\r\nAlso there existed of smaller concerns and private persons, full one\r\nthousand who yielded over all a no less sum than one million. Next came\r\nthe police, with appointment charges which began with a patrolman at\r\nfour hundred dollars, and soared to twenty thousand when the matter was\r\nthe making of a captain.\r\n\r\nHere I shall close my recapitulation of former treasure for the machine;\r\nI am driven to warn you, however, that the half has not been told.\r\nStill, if you will but let your imagination have its head, remembering\r\nhow the machine gives nothing away, and fails not to exert its pressures\r\nwith every chance afforded it, you may supply what other chapters belong\r\nwith the great history of graft.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers a Tammany profit, one will perforce be driven to the\r\nquestion: What be the expenses of the machine? The common cost of an\r\nelection should pause in the neighborhood of three hundred thousand\r\ndollars. Should peril crowd, and an imported vote be called for by the\r\ndangers of the day, the cost might carry vastly higher. No campaign,\r\nhowever, in the very nature of the enterprise and its possibilities of\r\nexpense, can consume a greater fund than eight hundred thousand. That\r\nsum, subtracted from the income of the machine as taken from those\r\nsundry sources I've related, will show what in my time remained for\r\ndistribution among my followers.\r\n\r\nAnd now that brings one abreast the subject of riches to the Boss\r\nhimself. One of the world's humorists puts into the mouth of a character\r\nthe query: What does a king get? The answer would be no whit less\r\ndifficult had he asked: What does a Boss get? One may take it, however,\r\nthat the latter gets the lion's share. Long ago I said that the wealth\r\nof Ophir hung on the hazard of the town's election. You have now some\r\nslant as to how far my words should be regarded as hyperbole. Nor must I\r\nomit how the machine's delegation in a legislature, or the little flock\r\nit sends to nibble on the slopes of Congress, is each in the hand of\r\nthe Boss to do with as he will, and it may go without a record that the\r\nopportunities so provided are neither neglected nor underpriced.\r\n\r\nThere you have the money story of Tammany in the bowels of the town.\r\nThose easy-chair economists who, over their morning coffee and waffles,\r\nengage themselves for purity, will at this point give honest rage the\r\nrein. Had I no sense of public duty? Was the last spark of any honesty\r\nburned out within my bosom? Was nothing left but dead embers to be a\r\nconscience to me? The Reverend Bronson--and I had a deep respect for\r\nthat gentleman--put those questions in his time.\r\n\r\n“Bear in mind,” said he when, after that last election, I again had\r\nthe town in my grasp, “bear in mind the welfare and the wishes of the\r\npublic, and use your power consistently therewith.”\r\n\r\n“Now, why?” said I. “The public of which you tell me lies in two pieces,\r\nthe minority and the majority. It is to the latter's welfare--the good\r\nof the machine--I shall address myself. Be sure, my acts will gain the\r\nplaudits of my own people, while I have only to go the road you speak of\r\nto be made the target of their anger. As to the minority--those who\r\nhave vilified me, and who still would crush me if they but had the\r\nstrength--why, then, as Morton says, I owe them no more than William\r\nowed the Saxons when after Hastings he had them under his feet.”\r\n\r\nWhen the new administration was in easy swing, and I had time to look\r\nabout me, I bethought me of Blackberry and those three millions taken\r\nfrom the weakness and the wickedness of young Van Flange. I would have\r\nthose millions back or know the secret of it.\r\n\r\nWith a nod here and a hand-toss there--for the shrug of my shoulders or\r\nthe lift of my brows had grown to have a definition among my people--I\r\nbrewed tempests for Blackberry. The park department discovered it in a\r\ntrespass; the health board gave it notice of the nonsanitary condition\r\nof its cars; the street commissioner badgered it with processes because\r\nof violations of laws and ordinances; the coroner, who commonly wore\r\na gag, gave daily news of what folk were killed or maimed through the\r\nwantonness of Blackberry; while my corporation counsel bestirred himself\r\nas to whether or no, for this neglect or that invasion of public right,\r\nthe Blackberry charter might not be revoked.\r\n\r\nIn the face of these, the president of Blackberry--he of the Hebrew cast\r\nand clutch--stood sullenly to his guns. He would not yield; he would not\r\npay the price of peace; he would not return those millions, although he\r\nknew well the argument which was the ground-work of his griefs.\r\n\r\nThe storm I unchained beat sorely, but he made no white-flag signs. I\r\nadmired his fortitude, while I multiplied my war.\r\n\r\nIt was Morton who pointed to that final feather which broke the camel's\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“Really, old chap,” observed Morton, that immortal eyeglass on nose and\r\nlanguid hands outspread, “really, you haven't played your trumps, don't\r\ny' know.”\r\n\r\n“What then?” cried I, for my heart was growing hot.\r\n\r\n“You recall my saying to our friend Bronson that, when I had a chap\r\nagainst me whom I couldn't buy, I felt about to discover his fad or his\r\nfear--I was speaking about changing a beggar's name, and all that, don't\r\ny' know?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “it all comes back.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” continued Morton. “Now the fear that keeps a street-railway\r\ncompany awake nights is its fear of a strike. There, my dear boy, you\r\nhave your weapon. Convey the information to those Blackberry employees,\r\nthat you think they get too little money and work too long a day. Let\r\nthem understand how, should they strike, your police will not repress\r\nthem in any crimes they see fit to commit. Really, I think I've hit\r\nupon a splendid idea! Those hirelings will go upon the warpath, don't y'\r\nknow! And a strike is such a beastly thing!--such a deuced bore! It is,\r\nreally!”\r\n\r\nWithin the fortnight every Blackberry wheel was stopped, and every\r\nemployee rioting in the streets. Cars were sacked; what men offered for\r\nwork were harried, and made to fly for very skins and bones. Meanwhile,\r\nthe police stood afar off with virgin-batons, innocent of interference.\r\n\r\nFour days of this, and those four millions were paid into my hand; the\r\nBlackberry president had yielded, and my triumph was complete. With\r\nthat, my constabulary remembered law and order, and, descending upon the\r\nturbulent, calmed them with their clubs. The strike ended; again were\r\nthe gongs of an unharassed Blackberry heard in the land.\r\n\r\nAnd now I draw near the sorrowful, desperate end--the end at once of my\r\nlabors and my latest hope. I had held the town since the last battle\r\nfor well-nigh three and one-half years. Throughout this space affairs\r\npolitical preserved themselves as rippleless as a looking-glass, and\r\nnothing to ruffle with an adverse wind. Those henchmen--my boys of the\r\nbelt, as it were--Sing Sing Jacob, Puffy the Merchant, and Paddy the\r\nPriest, went working like good retrievers at their task of bringing\r\ndaily money to my feet.\r\n\r\nNor was I compelled to appear as one interested in the profits of the\r\ntown's farming, and this of itself was comfort, since it served to keep\r\nme aloof from any mire of those methods that were employed.\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful how a vile source for a dollar will in no wise daunt a\r\nman, so that he be not made to pick it from the direct mud himself. If\r\nbut one hand intervene between his own and that gutter which gave it up,\r\nboth his conscience and his sensibilities are satisfied to receive it.\r\nOf all sophists, self-interest is the sophist surest of disciples; it\r\nwill carry conviction triumphant against what fact or what deduction may\r\ncome to stand in the way, and, with the last of it, “The smell of all\r\nmoney is sweet.”\r\n\r\nBut while it was isles of spice and summer seas with my politics,\r\nmatters at home went ever darker with increasing threat. Blossom\r\nbecame weaker and still more weak, and wholly from a difficulty in her\r\nbreathing. If she were to have had but her breath, her health would have\r\nbeen fair enough; and that I say by word of the physician who was there\r\nto attend her, and who was a gray deacon of his guild.\r\n\r\n“It is her breathing,” said he; “otherwise her health is good for any\r\ncall she might make upon it.”\r\n\r\nIt was the more strange to one looking on; for all this time while\r\nBlossom was made to creep from one room to another, and, for the most\r\npart, to lie panting upon a couch, her cheeks were round and red as\r\npeaches, and her eyes grew in size and brightness like stars when the\r\nnight is dark.\r\n\r\n“Would you have her sent away?” I asked of the physician. “Say but the\r\nplace; I will take her there myself.”\r\n\r\n“She is as well here,” said he. Then, as his brows knotted with the\r\nproblem of it: “This is an unusual case; so unusual, indeed, that during\r\nforty years of practice I have never known its fellow. However, it is no\r\nquestion of climate, and she will be as well where she is. The better;\r\nsince she has no breath with which to stand a journey.”\r\n\r\nWhile I said nothing to this, I made up my mind to have done with\r\npolitics and take Blossom away. It would, at the worst, mean escape from\r\nscenes where we had met with so much misery. That my present rule of the\r\ntown owned still six months of life before another battle, did not move\r\nme. I would give up my leadership and retire at once. It would lose me\r\nhalf a year of gold-heaping, but what should that concern? What mattered\r\na handful of riches, more or less, as against the shoreless relief of\r\nseclusion, and Blossom in new scenes of quiet peace? The very newness\r\nwould take up her thoughts; and with nothing about to recall what had\r\nbeen, or to whisper the name of that villain who hurt her heart to the\r\ndeath, she might have even the good fortune to forget. My decision was\r\nmade, and I went quietly forward to bring my politics to a close.\r\n\r\nIt became no question of weeks nor even days; I convened my district\r\nleaders, and with the few words demanded of the time, returned them\r\nmy chiefship and stepped down and out. Politics and I had parted; the\r\nmachine and I were done.\r\n\r\nAt that, I cannot think I saw regret over my going in any of the faces\r\nwhich stared up at me. There was a formal sorrow of words; but the great\r\nexpression to to seize upon each was that of selfish eagerness. I, with\r\nmy lion's share of whatever prey was taken, would be no more; it was the\r\nthought of each that with such the free condition he would be like to\r\nfind some special fatness not before his own.\r\n\r\nWell! what else should I have looked for?--I, who had done only justice\r\nby them, why should I be loved? Let them exult; they have subserved\r\nmy purpose and fulfilled my turn. I was retiring with the wealth of\r\nkings:--I, who am an ignorant man, and the son of an Irish smith! If my\r\nmoney had been put into gold it would have asked the strength of eighty\r\nteams, with a full ton of gold to a team, to have hauled it out of\r\ntown--a solid procession of riches an easy half-mile in length! No\r\nAlexander, no Cæsar, no Napoleon in his swelling day of conquest,\r\ncould have made the boast! I was master of every saffron inch of forty\r\nmillions!\r\n\r\nThat evening I sat by Blossom's couch and told her of my plans. I made\r\nbut the poor picture of it, for I have meager power of words, and am\r\nfettered with an imagination of no wings. Still, she smiled up at me as\r\nthough with pleasure--for her want of breath was so urgent she could\r\nnot speak aloud, but only whisper a syllable now and then--and, after a\r\nwhile, I kissed her, and left her with the physician and nurse for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIt was during the first hours of the morning when I awoke in a sweat\r\nof horror, as if something of masterful menace were in the room. With a\r\nchill in my blood like the touch of ice, I thought of Blossom; and with\r\nthat I began to huddle on my clothes to go to her.\r\n\r\nThe physician met me at Blossom's door. He held me back with a gentle\r\nhand on my breast.\r\n\r\n“Don't go in!” he said.\r\n\r\nThat hand, light as a woman's, withstood me like a wall. I drew back\r\nand sought a chair in the library--a chair of Blossom's, it was--and sat\r\nglooming into the darkness in a wonder of fear.\r\n\r\nWhat wits I possess have broad feet, and are not easily to be staggered.\r\nThat night, however, they swayed and rocked like drunken men, under the\r\npressure of some evil apprehension of I knew not what. I suppose now I\r\nfeared death for Blossom, and that my thoughts lacked courage to look\r\nthe surmise in the face.\r\n\r\nAn hour went by, and I still in the darkened room. I wanted no lights.\r\nIt was as though I were a fugitive, and sought in the simple darkness\r\na refuge and a place wherein to hide myself. Death was in the house,\r\nrobbing me of all I loved; I knew that, and yet I felt no stab of agony,\r\nbut instead a fashion of dumb numbness like a paralysis.\r\n\r\nIn a vague way, this lack of sharp sensation worked upon my amazement.\r\nI remember that, in explanation of it, I recalled one of Morton's tales\r\nabout a traveler whom a lion seized as he sat at his campfire; and how,\r\nwhile the lion crunched him in his jaws and dragged him to a distance,\r\nhe still had no feel of pain, but--as I had then--only a numbness and\r\nfog of nerves.\r\n\r\nWhile this went running in my head, I heard the rattle of someone at the\r\nstreet door, and was aware, I don't know how, that another physician had\r\ncome. A moment later my ear overtook whisperings in the hall just beyond\r\nmy own door.\r\n\r\nMoved of an instinct that might have prompted some threatened animal\r\nto spy out what danger overhung him, I went, cat-foot, to the door and\r\nlistened. It was the two physicians in talk.\r\n\r\n“The girl is dead,” I heard one say.\r\n\r\n“What malady?” asked the other.\r\n\r\n“And there's the marvel of it!” cries the first. “No malady at all, as\r\nI'm a doctor! She died of suffocation. The case is without a parallel.\r\nIndubitably, it was that birthmark--that mark as of a rope upon her\r\nneck. Like the grip of destiny itself, the mark has been growing and\r\ntightening about her throat since ever she lay in her cradle, until now\r\nshe dies of it. A most remarkable case! It is precisely as though she\r\nwere hanged--the congested eye, the discolored face, the swollen tongue,\r\naye! and about her throat, the very mark of the rope!”\r\n\r\nBlossom dead! my girl dead! Apple Cheek, Anne, Blossom, all gone, and\r\nI to be left alone! Alone! The word echoed in the hollows of my empty\r\nheart as in a cavern! There came a blur, and then a fearful whirling;\r\nthat gorilla strength was as the strength of children; my slow knees\r\nbegan to cripple down! That was the last I can recall; I fell as if\r\nstruck by a giant's mallet, and all was black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII--BEING THE EPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT should there be more? My house stands upon a hill; waving, sighing\r\ntrees are ranked about it, while to the eastward I have the shimmering\r\nstretches of the river beneath my feet. From a wooden seat between two\r\nbeeches, I may see the fog-loom born of the dust and smoke of the city\r\nfar away. At night, when clouds lie thick and low, the red reflection of\r\nthe city's million lamps breaks on the sky as though a fire raged.\r\n\r\nIt is upon my seat between the beeches that I spend my days. Men would\r\ncall my life a stagnant one; I care not, since I find it peace. I have\r\nneither hopes nor fears nor pains nor joys; there come no exaltations,\r\nno depressions; within me is a serenity--a kind of silence like the\r\nheart of nature.\r\n\r\nAt that I have no dimness; I roll and rock for hours on the dead swells\r\nof old days, while old faces and old scenes toss to and fro like seaweed\r\nwith the tides of my memory. I am prey to no regrets, to no ambitions;\r\nmy times own neither currents nor winds; I have outlived importance\r\nand the liking for it; and all those little noises that keep the world\r\nawake, I never hear.\r\n\r\nMy Sicilian, with his earrings and his crimson headwear of silk, is with\r\nme; for he could not have lived had I left him in town, being no more\r\nable to help himself than a ship ashore. Here he is busy and happy over\r\nnothing. He has whittled for himself a trio of little boats, and he\r\nsails them on the pond at the lawn's foot. One of these he has named the\r\nDemocrat, while the others are the Republican and the Mugwump. He sails\r\nthem against each other; and I think that by some marine sleight he\r\ngives the Democrat the best of it, since it ever wins, which is not true\r\nof politics. My Sicilian has just limped up the hill with a story of\r\nhow, in the last race, the Republican and the Mugwump ran into one\r\nanother and capsized, while the Democrat finished bravely.\r\n\r\nSave for my Sicilian, and a flock of sable ravens that by their tameness\r\nand a confident self-sufficiency have made themselves part of the\r\nhousehold, I pass the day between my beeches undisturbed. The ravens are\r\ngrown so proud with safety that, when I am walking, they often hold\r\nthe path against me, picking about for the grains my Sicilian scatters,\r\nkeeping upon me the while a truculent eye that is half cautious,\r\nhalf defiant. In the spring I watch these ravens throughout their\r\nnest-building, they living for the most part in the trees about my\r\nhouse. I've known them to be baffled during a whole two days, when winds\r\nwere blowing and the swaying of the branches prevented their labors.\r\n\r\nNow and then I have a visit from Morton and the Reverend Bronson. The\r\npair are as they were, only more age-worn and of a grayer lock. They\r\nwere with me the other day; Morton as faultless of garb as ever, and\r\nwith eyeglass as much employed, the Reverend Bronson as anxious as in\r\nthe old time for the betterment of humanity. The spirit of unselfishness\r\nnever flags in that good man's breast, although Morton is in constant\r\nbicker with him concerning the futility of his work.\r\n\r\n“The fault isn't in you, old chap,” said Morton, when last they were\r\nwith me; “it isn't, really. But humanity in the mass is such a beastly\r\ndullard, don't y' know, that to do anything in its favor is casting\r\npearls before swine.”\r\n\r\n“Why, then,” responded the Reverend Bronson with a smile, “if I were\r\nyou, I should help mankind for the good it gave me, without once\r\nthinking on the object of my generosity.”\r\n\r\n“But,” returned Morton, “I take no personal joy from helping people.\r\nGad! it wearies me. Man is such a perverse beggar; he's ever wrong end\r\nto in his affairs. The entire race is like a horse turned round in its\r\nstall, and with its tail in the fodder stands shouting for hay. If men,\r\nin what you call their troubles, would but face the other way about,\r\nnine times in ten they'd be all right. They wouldn't need help--really!”\r\n\r\n“And if what you say be true,” observed the Reverend Bronson, who was as\r\nfond of argument as was Morton, “then you have outlined your duty. You\r\nsay folk are turned wrong in their affairs. Then you should help them to\r\nturn right.”\r\n\r\n“Really now,” said Morton, imitating concern, “I wouldn't for the world\r\nhave such sentiments escape to the ears of my club, don't y' know, for\r\nit's beastly bad form to even entertain them, but I lay the trouble you\r\nseek to relieve, old chap, to that humbug we call civilization; I do,\r\n'pon my word!”\r\n\r\n“Do you cry out against civilization?”\r\n\r\n“Gad! why not? I say it is an artifice, a mere deceit. Take ourselves:\r\nwhat has it done for any of us? Here is our friend”--Morton dropped his\r\nhand upon my shoulder--“who, taking advantage of what was offered of our\r\ncivilization, came to be so far victorious as to have the town for\r\nhis kickball. He was a dictator; his word was law among three\r\nmillions--really! To-day he has riches, and could pave his grounds\r\nwith gold. He was these things, and had these things, from the hand\r\nof civilization; and now, at the end, he sits in the center of sadness\r\nwaiting for death. Consider my own case: I, too, at the close of my\r\njuice-drained days, am waiting for death; only, unlike our friend, I\r\nplay the cynic and while I wait I laugh.”\r\n\r\n“I was never much to laugh,” I interjected.\r\n\r\n“The more strange, too, don't y' know,” continued Morton, “since you are\r\naware of life and the mockery of it, as much as I. I may take it that\r\nI came crying into this world, for such I understand to be the beastly\r\npractice of the human young. Had I understood the empty jest of it, I\r\nshould have laughed; I should, really!”\r\n\r\n“Now with what do you charge civilization?” asked the Reverend Bronson.\r\n\r\n“It has made me rich, and I complain of that. The load of my millions\r\nbegins to bend my back. A decent, wholesome savagery would have\r\npresented no such burdens.”\r\n\r\n“And do you uplift savagery?”\r\n\r\n“I don't wonder you're shocked, old chap, for from our civilized\r\nstandpoint savagery is such deuced bad form. But you should consider;\r\nyou should, really! Gad! you know that civilized city where we dwell;\r\nyou know its civilized millions, fretting like maggots, as many as four\r\nthousand in a block; you know the good and the evil ground of those\r\ncivilized mills! Wherein lieth a triumph over the red savage who abode\r\nupon the spot three centuries ago? Who has liberty as had that savage?\r\nHe owned laws and respected them; he had his tribe, and was a patriot\r\nfit to talk with William Tell. He fought his foe like a Richard of\r\nEngland, and loved his friend like a Jonathan. He paid neither homage to\r\npower nor taxes to men, and his privileges were as wide as the world's\r\nrim. His franchises of fagot, vert, and venison had never a limit; he\r\nmight kill a deer a day and burn a cord of wood to its cookery. As for\r\nhis religion: the test of religion is death; and your savage met death\r\nwith a fortitude, and what is fortitude but faith, which it would bother\r\nChristians to parallel. It may be said that he lived a happier life, saw\r\nmore of freedom, and was more his own man, than any you are to meet in\r\nBroadway.”\r\n\r\nMorton, beneath his fluff of cynicism, was a deal in earnest. The\r\nReverend Bronson took advantage of it to say:\r\n\r\n“Here, as you tell us, are we three, and all at the end of the journey.\r\nHere is that one who strove for power: here is that one who strove for\r\nwealth; here is that one who strove to help his fellow man. I give you\r\nthe question: Brushing civilization and savagery aside as just no more\r\nthan terms to mark some shadowy difference, I ask you: Who of the three\r\nlives most content?--for it is he who was right.”\r\n\r\n“By the way!” said Morton, turning to me, as they were about to depart,\r\nand producing a scrap of newspaper, “this is what a scientist writes\r\nconcerning you. The beggar must have paid you a call, don't y' know.\r\nAt first, I thought it a beastly rude thing to put in print; but, gad!\r\nthe more I dwell upon it, the more honorable it becomes. This is what he\r\nsays of you:\r\n\r\n“'There was a look in his eye such as might burn in the eye of an old\r\nwolf that has crept away in solitude to die. As I gazed, there swept\r\ndown upon me an astounding conviction. I felt that I was in the presence\r\nof the oldest thing in the world--a thing more ancient than the Sphinx\r\nor aged pyramids. This once Boss, silent and passive and white and\r\nold, and waiting for the digging of his grave, is what breeders call a\r\n“throw-back”--a throw-back, not of the generations, but of the ages. In\r\nwhat should arm him for a war of life against life, he is a creature of\r\nutter cunning, utter courage, utter strength. He is a troglodyte; he\r\nis that original one who lived with the cave bear, the mastodon, the\r\nsabertoothed tiger, and the Irish elk.'”\r\n\r\nThey went away, the Reverend Bronson and Morton, leaving me alone on my\r\nbench between the beeches, while the black ravens picked and strutted\r\nabout my feet, and my Sicilian on the lake at the lawn's foot matching\r\nhis little ships for another race.\r\n\r\nTHE END",
