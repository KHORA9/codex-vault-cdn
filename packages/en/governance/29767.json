IV.--AUGUST, 1863.--No. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these exciting times, when our country is enduring the throes of\r\npolitical convulsion, and every time-honored institution, every\r\nwell-regulated law of society seems tottering from the broad foundation\r\nof the past, how few are there who ask themselves the question, What is\r\nto be our future? For the past two years we have lived in a state of\r\nextraordinary and unnatural excitement, beside which the jog-trot\r\nexistence of the former days, with all its periodical excitements, its\r\nhebdomadal heavings of the waves of society, pales into insignificance.\r\nLike the grave, with its eternal 'Give! give!' our appetites, stimulated\r\nto a morbid degree by their daily food of marvels, cry constantly for\r\nmore; and a lull of but a few brief months in the storm whose angry\r\npinions are constantly bringing new wonders to our view, begets an\r\nalmost insupportable _ennui_ in the public mind, and a restlessness\r\namong the masses, such as our history has never before shown. Nor will\r\nthe craving be satiated so long as the war shall last; for the stirring\r\nevents, following so closely upon each other, and filling every hour of\r\nour national life, will keep up the unnatural excitement, even as the\r\nstimulating effect of alcoholic drinks is prolonged by repeated\r\ndraughts. Only when the source is entirely cut off will the stimulus\r\npass away; and then, when peace is established, and we drop again into\r\nthe ruts and grooves of the olden days, the reaction will set in, and\r\nhappy shall we be if it is not followed by a political _delirium\r\ntremens_.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are living in and for the present alone. Men's minds are so\r\ncompletely absorbed in the wonderful events that are constantly passing\r\naround them, in the startling _denouements_ that each day brings forth,\r\nthat their attention is entirely distracted from that future to which we\r\nare inevitably tending. And this not because that future is of little\r\nimportance, but because nearer and more vital interests are staring us\r\nin the face, in which it is involved, and upon which it depends--a\r\nnearer and more portentous future, which we must ourselves control and\r\nshape, else the farther state will be utterly beyond our influence,\r\nfixed in the channel of a malignant and ever-grovelling fate. The great\r\nquestion now is, how soonest to end the war prosperously to ourselves;\r\nand until this problem, involving our very existence, is solved, the\r\nfuture, with all its prospects, good or bad, is left to take care of\r\nitself, and rightly, too; for in the event of our present success, our\r\nfuture will be in our own hands, while, if we fail, it will be fixed and\r\nirrevocable, without the slightest reference to our interests or our\r\nexertions. And yet, natural as this fact may seem, it is a little\r\nsingular that, while thousands of minds are eagerly searching for light\r\nupon the question of the future of the American negro, few are found to\r\ninquire what is to be our own. Strange that one exciting topic should so\r\nfill men's minds and monopolize their sympathies as to entirely exclude\r\nother questions of greater importance, and bearing more directly upon\r\nour present and vital interests. Yet so it is, and so it has been in all\r\nages of the world, though, happily, the hallucination does not last for\r\nany very extended period; for there is a compensation in human as well\r\nas in inanimate nature, which, in its own good time, brings mind to its\r\nproper balance by the harsh remedy of severe and present necessity, and\r\nso retrieves the errors of a blind past.\r\n\r\nYet, absorbed as is the popular mind in the stirring events of the war,\r\nand dull as all other themes may seem in comparison, it may not be\r\nwithout interest to examine, in connection with our future, some of\r\nthose facts which are now floating about at random on the surface of\r\nsociety, waiting for some hand to gather and arrange them in the\r\ntreasure house of prophecy. And in so doing, let it be premised that we\r\nproceed entirely upon the hypothesis--which to every truly loyal mind is\r\nalready an established truth--of the ultimate success and complete\r\ntriumph of the North in the present contest. For in any other event all\r\nthese facts are dumb, and the inferences to be drawn from them vague and\r\nunsatisfactory, absolutely no better than mere random conjecture. And as\r\nthe war has now become the great fact in our history, and its effects\r\nmust modify our whole social life for many years to come, its results\r\nmust not be neglected in an investigation of this kind, but, on the\r\ncontrary, claim our first attention.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, then, among the lasting results of the war, will be\r\nthe _arousing of our nationality_. To the majority of readers it will\r\nseem the climax of heresy to assert that hitherto we have not known a\r\npure and lofty nationality. What! you will ask, did not our ancestors,\r\nby their sufferings and strivings in that war which first made our land\r\nfamous throughout the civilized world, bestow upon us a separate, true,\r\nand noble national existence? Have we not twice humbled the pride of the\r\nmost powerful nation upon earth? Have we not covered the seas with our\r\ncommerce, and brought all nations to pay tribute to our great staples?\r\nHave we not taken the lead in all adventurous and eminently practical\r\nenterprises, and is not our land the home of invention and the foster\r\nmother of the useful arts? Has not the whole world gazed with admiring\r\nwonder at our miraculous advancement in the scale of national existence?\r\nIn a word, have we not long since become a great, established fact, as\r\nwell in physical history as in the sublime record of that intellectual\r\nprogress whereby humanity draws constantly nearer to the divine? And as\r\nfor patriotic feeling, do we not yearly burn tons of powder on the\r\nall-glorious Fourth of July, and crack our throats with huzzas for the\r\n'star-spangled banner' and the American eagle? And a caviller might\r\nperhaps go farther, and ask the significant question, Are we not known\r\nall over the world as a race of arrant braggarts?\r\n\r\nGrant all these things, and we are yet as far from that true, firm,\r\nself-relying, high-toned nationality which alone is worthy of the name,\r\nas when the Pilgrims landed upon Plymouth rock. Our patriotism has\r\nhitherto been too utterly heartless--too much a thing of sounding words\r\nand meaningless phrases--too much of the 'sounding brass and tinkling\r\ncymbal.' We have built too much upon the exploits of our ancestors,\r\nreposed too long upon their laurels, forgetting that their efforts were\r\nbut the initiatory step in the great contest that was to be carried on\r\nby succeeding generations; forgetting that we have still a destiny to\r\nwork out for ourselves, a niche to secure in the great temple of\r\nhumanity, obstacles to surmount, difficulties to overcome, bitter and\r\ndeadly foes to vanquish. And how totally devoid of heart have been even\r\nour celebrations of our great national birthday and holiday! While we\r\nhave amused ourselves with the explosion of crackers and blowing off of\r\nour neighbors' arms by premature discharges of rusty cannon, while we\r\nhave rent the air with squibs, shouts, and exclamations, and listened to\r\nthe periodical and hackneyed outbursts of oratorical gas, how few of us\r\nhave remembered the deep significance of the day, and felt our hearts\r\nswell with genuine patriotic emotion! How few of us have realized that\r\nwe were celebrating not merely the establishing of a form of government,\r\nthe severing of galling bonds which bound us to the servitude of the old\r\nworld, not merely the birthday of independence and of a nation, but the\r\nbirthday of an immortal principle, whose beneficent effects were not\r\nmore for us than for the generations of all succeeding time! The masses\r\nsaw in that day but an universal _fête_, a day of national relaxation\r\nand enjoyment, and neither thought or cared much about its deep meaning;\r\nwhile to the few, the thinking men alone, appeared the principle which\r\nunderlay all this festivity and vociferation. Henceforth this will not\r\nbe so. We have lived so long and so undisturbed in the enjoyment of our\r\npolitical blessings, that we have not appreciated our favored lot; but\r\nnow, when for the first time in our history treason has boldly lifted\r\nits head, and traitors have endeavored to deprive us of all our most\r\ncherished blessings--to strike at the very root of all that is good and\r\npure in our political system--now for the first time do we see those\r\nblessings in their true light, and realize their inestimable value. Now\r\nthat the prestige of our greatness threatens to depart from us, do we\r\nfirst see the glorious destiny which the great God of nature has marked\r\nout for us. Now for the first time do we realize that we have a purpose\r\nin life--that we are the exponents of one of the great truths of the\r\nuniverse itself, and appreciate the awful responsibility that rests upon\r\nus in the development of our great principle, as well as in protecting\r\nit from the inroads of error and corruption. And herein lies the great\r\nsecret of all true national life. For no nation was ever yet truly great\r\nthat had not constantly before it some lofty and ennobling object to\r\ndirect all its strivings, some great central truths at its very core,\r\ncontinually working outward through all the great arterial ramifications\r\nof society, keeping up a brisk and healthy circulation by the force of\r\nits own eternal energy. Lack of a noble purpose, in nations as well as\r\nindividuals, begets a vacillating policy, which is inevitably followed\r\nby degeneration and corruption. The soldier, who has passed many a weary\r\nmonth in the monotony of the camp, enduring all the hardships of\r\nrigorous winters and scorching summers, of fatigue and privation, and\r\nwho has shed his blood upon many a hard-fought field, will learn to\r\nappreciate as he never has before the true value of that Government for\r\nwhich he has suffered so much, and, with the return of our armies to\r\ntheir homes, this sentiment will be diffused among the masses, and the\r\nlessons they have learned will be taught to their fellows: and this,\r\ntogether with the recognition of our true end and aim in existence--of\r\nthe part which our country is destined to play in the great drama of\r\nlife, will beget a noble, self-relying national pride, the very opposite\r\npole to that senseless, loud-mouthed self-laudation which has too much\r\ncharacterized us in the days gone by. The boaster betrays the\r\nconsciousness of the very weakness he wishes to conceal; while 'still\r\nwaters run deep,' and the man of true courage and strength is the man of\r\nfew words and great deeds. So that arrant bragging which has hitherto\r\nbeen our besetting sin, and which, so long as our real importance in the\r\naffairs of the world was unacknowledged, was somewhat excusable, and\r\nperhaps even necessary to sustain a yet unestablished cause, will be\r\nnecessary no longer when we have proved ourselves worthy of the position\r\nwe claim, and will, with the newborn consciousness of our power and\r\nstrength, pass away forever, and we shall work steadily on in our\r\nappointed course, leaving it to others to recognize and proclaim our\r\nworth, to sound the trumpet which we have so long been industriously\r\nblowing for ourselves, content to let our reputation bide its time and\r\nrest upon sterling deeds rather than upon pompous declamations and empty\r\noratorical phrases. The deeds of our ancestors were great indeed, and\r\ntheir patriotism and self-sacrificing devotion to a noble cause beyond a\r\nparallel: but even those will pale beside the present struggle of a\r\nfull-grown nation at the very crisis of its fate; and the results which\r\nfollowed their efforts will be as nothing to those which shall flow from\r\nour battle of to-day. For while it was theirs to initiate, it is ours to\r\ndevelop and firmly establish; theirs to deliver the nation from the womb\r\nof centuries, ours to educate, to guard from danger through childhood\r\nand youth, to nurse through disease, to tone down the crudities of\r\nnational hobble-de-hoy-dom, to fix and strengthen by judicious training\r\nthe iron constitution, both mental and physical, which shall resist the\r\nravages of disease and error for all time to come. How much more\r\nimportant, then, appears our mission than theirs! how much greater the\r\nresponsibility which rests upon us to faithfully fulfil that mission!\r\nAnd this will be the feeling of every true American. This will be the\r\nknowledge, gained by the bitterest experience, which will give us that\r\nnationality we have so long lacked.\r\n\r\nAnd not a little conducive to the development of that new-found\r\nnationality will be the respect and admiration, not to say applause,\r\nwhich the display of our latent power and resources, the prosperous\r\nconduct and successful close of this the most gigantic struggle of\r\nhistory, will win for us from the nations of the Old World. And this\r\nbrings me to the second beneficial effect of this war upon our future,\r\nnamely, the establishment of our position among the great powers of the\r\nearth, and our relief from all future aggressions, encroachments, and\r\nannoyances of the mother country. From the day when our independence was\r\ndeclared, America has been an eyesore to all the leading Governments of\r\nEurope--the object of detraction and bitter hostility, of envy, hatred,\r\nand malice, and all uncharitableness. And though these feelings have\r\nbeen partially concealed under the cloak of studied politeness and\r\nfalse, hollow-hearted friendship, occasions enough have been given for\r\nthem to break forth in sufficient intensity to establish beyond a\r\nquestion the fact of their existence. The apostles of despotic power\r\nhave suffered no opportunity to escape of dealing a blow at our national\r\nexistence: even the low and disreputable weapon of slander has been\r\nbrought to bear against us, and we have been held up to mankind as a\r\nrace of visionaries, of fanatical reformers, whose efforts have ever\r\nbeen to destroy all the honored landmarks of the past, and lead humanity\r\nback over the track of ages to the socialism of primitive existence. And\r\nit was but natural for us to expect little sympathy from their hands,\r\nfor in our success lay the triumph of a principle which was deadly to\r\nall their cherished institutions--a principle which, once firmly\r\nestablished, must in time inevitably spread beyond the waters, to the\r\nutter and eternal downfall of aristocracies and dynasties, since it is\r\nfounded in one of the very first truths of universal human nature--in\r\nthe recognition of the rights of the individual, and of the total\r\ndependence of the governing upon the governed. And yet they could not\r\nwithhold their admiration of the indomitable energy and perseverance of\r\nthe American race, and their wonder at our miraculous growth in\r\nenlightenment and power. Taught wisdom by the past, they dared not\r\ncombine to crush us by brute force, and so they have waited and hoped\r\nfor the downfall which they sincerely believed would, sooner or later,\r\novertake us. England and France have ever hung about us like hungry\r\nwolves around the dying buffalo, waiting patiently for the hour when\r\nthey might safely step in and claim the lion's share of the spoil. The\r\ncrisis of our fate which they have so long awaited, they now fondly\r\nbelieve to be upon us; and old England, false, treacherous, cowardly,\r\npiratical England, fearful lest our native resources may enable us to\r\nweather the storm, has at last dropped the mask of a century, and openly\r\nencourages and abets the rebels and traitors who are desperately\r\nstriving for our dismemberment, even furnishing them with the very bone\r\nand sinews of war, that they may compass their unholy ends, and effect\r\nthe ruin which will give to her another fat colonial province. While the\r\nmore wily French emperor, looking to our possible success, and anxious\r\nfor a subterfuge beneath which he may skulk in that event, and so escape\r\nthe retribution which will assuredly fall upon his head, has really\r\noutwitted his island rival, in his Mexican expedition, whereby he hoped\r\nto 'kill two birds with one stone,' securing, in either event, the\r\nrichest portion of the American continent, and thereby establishing a\r\nfoothold, that, in case of our ruin, he may be first 'in at the death,'\r\nand carry off the larger share of the booty. And what will be the\r\nresult? Checked, defeated, disgraced on the very threshold of his\r\nundertaking, his chosen and hitherto invincible legions, furnished with\r\nall the appliances of warlike invention, and perfected in the boasted\r\nFrench skill and discipline, baffled and routed by the half-civilized\r\nMexicans, to whose very capital our own raw volunteers marched in a\r\nsingle season, he will be by no means anxious to measure his strength\r\nwith ours when we shall have emerged from a war in which the lessons of\r\nmilitary science, learned by hard experience, have been widely diffused\r\namong our hitherto peaceful people, and when we shall have nearly a\r\nmillion of trained troops ready to spring to arms at an hour's call;\r\ntroops who will fight a foreign foe with double the courage and\r\ndesperation which has characterized the present war. If he cannot subdue\r\nthe rude Mexicans, can he conquer us?\r\n\r\nThe development of those latent resources of which even ourselves were\r\nignorant, the display of wealth and power at which we are astonished no\r\nless than foreign nations, the energetic prosecution of more than two\r\nyears of war on such a magnificently extended and expensive scale,\r\nwithout even feeling the drain upon either our population or treasure,\r\nhave taught Great Britain a lesson which she will not soon forget, and\r\nof which she will not fail to avail herself. What nation ever before,\r\nwithout even the nucleus of a standing army, raised, equipped, and put\r\ninto the field, within a brief six months, an army of half a million of\r\nmen, and supported it for such a length of time, at the cost of a\r\nmillion dollars per day, while scarcely increasing the burden of\r\ntaxation upon the people? And yet this was done by a portion only of our\r\ncountry--the Northern States; and that, too, by a people totally of and\r\nhitherto unaccustomed to warlike pursuits. If such are our strength and\r\nresources when divided, what will they be united and against a foreign\r\nfoe? England cannot fail to see the question in this light, and in the\r\nfuture she will find her interest in courting our friendship and\r\nalliance, rather than in continual encroachment and exasperation. We\r\nshall hear no more of Bay Islands or northwestern boundaries, of San\r\nJuan or rights of search; and the Monroe doctrine will perforce receive\r\nfrom her a recognition which she has never yet accorded to it. She will\r\nrecognize as the fiat of destiny our supremacy on the western\r\nhemisphere. Foreign nations have respected us in the past; they must\r\nfear us in the future. And while they will have no cause to dread our\r\ninterference with the affairs of the Old World, they will be cautious of\r\ntampering with a power which has proved itself one of the first, if not\r\nthe very first, on the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nFor--and this is another effect of the war which may be noticed in this\r\nconnection--for many years to come we shall be a military nation. The\r\nnecessity of guarding against a similar outbreak in the future will\r\nprompt the increase of our standing army; while the same cause, as well\r\nas the taste for military pursuits which our people will have acquired\r\nduring this war, will keep the great mass of the people prepared to\r\nrespond to the first call in the hour of danger. The militia laws will\r\nbe revived, revised, and established on a firmer basis than ever before,\r\nand the antiquated militia musters and 'June trainings' will again\r\nbecome our most cherished holidays. Independent military organizations\r\nwill spring up and flourish all over the land, and he who aforetime wore\r\nhis gorgeous uniform at the heavy cost of running the gauntlet of his\r\nneighbors' sneers and gibes as a holiday soldier, will now be honored in\r\nenrolling his name among the 'Independent Rifles' of his native village.\r\nThe youth will labor to acquire the elements of military knowledge and\r\nreduce them to practice, not with a view to holiday parades, but with an\r\neye to the possible exigencies of the future, knowing that when the hour\r\nof trial shall come, the post of honor and of fame will be open to all,\r\nand that he who has most cultivated the military art in time of peace\r\nwill bid fair to win in the race for preferment. Military schools will\r\nderive a new importance in our country; they will be patronized by high\r\nand low, and most of our institutions of learning will, ere many years,\r\nhave a military as well as a scientific and classical department. And\r\nthus will the knowledge of the art of war become so universally diffused\r\namong the people, that in the event of another great struggle, we shall\r\nnot be left, as heretofore, to depend upon raw and undisciplined\r\nvolunteers, but an army of well-trained troops will spring like magic to\r\nthe field, ready to march at once to victory, without the necessity of\r\n'camps of instruction' and twelve months' delays. And when that day does\r\ncome, woe to that potentate who shall have the temerity to provoke a war\r\nwith our race of soldiers: his legions will be swept away like chaff\r\nbefore the whirlwind, and only defeat and disgrace will settle upon his\r\nbanners.\r\n\r\nAgain, the stimulus which this contest has applied to warlike invention\r\nhas already placed us in that respect far ahead of the most warlike\r\nnation on earth. France has hitherto been known as the great originator\r\nin all military science: probably she will yet, for many years, retain\r\nthe palm in the province of tactics and executive skill. But as an\r\noriginator and perfecter of the engines and defences of war, America has\r\nalready robbed her of her crown, and stands to-day unsurpassed. No\r\ngreater proof is needed of our superiority in this respect than the fact\r\nthat in two short years of civil strife we have revolutionized the whole\r\nart of war as it has existed for ages, rendering absurd the maxims and\r\nuseless the experience of the olden days, while filling their places\r\nwith systems and theories whose practical results are so clear as to\r\noverwhelmingly sustain the new order of things, and compel not only the\r\nadmiration but the support and adoption of the onlooking world. The\r\nantiquated weapons of warfare are harmless to-day, and their places are\r\nsupplied by new and more destructive engines, which Europe must perforce\r\nadopt in self-defence, and thus bow to the genius of American invention,\r\nwhereby the old is so entirely and radically supplanted by the new, that\r\nthe Napoleons and Wellingtons of a past age would be but tyros in our\r\nbattles of to-day. The lesson of the Monitors is not the only one Europe\r\nhas learned from us within the last two years. And we have more to teach\r\nher yet, more marvels yet to be evolved from that inexhaustible mine of\r\ninvention--the Yankee brain. For as long as the war shall last,\r\nfurnishing not only a promise of a golden harvest in the future, but a\r\npresent and substantial support to inventive genius, at the same time\r\nthat a new stimulus is being constantly supplied by the events and\r\nexperience of each succeeding day, the work will go on, and weapon after\r\nweapon, engine after engine, will be thrown into the world's great\r\nmarket, constantly approaching nearer to the perfection of destructive\r\npower. And as there is no poison without its antidote, so the\r\noriginating faculties of the American mind will be as fully exerted in\r\nthe creation of defences against those very engines of destruction.\r\nArmed thus at all points, and containing within ourselves not only a\r\nsource of future supply, but even the very fount of originating faculty\r\nin this speciality, we shall be a power with which it is dangerous to\r\ntrifle--a power with which others will not care to come in collision in\r\nany other form than that of an overwhelming combination, which, thank\r\nGod! has become in these days one of the impossibilities of political\r\nmanoeuvring. Nor will they be anxious, on any slight provocation, to\r\nagain arouse that inventive faculty which furnishes us with material of\r\nwar far in advance of the rest of the world. We have within ourselves\r\nevery element of strength, every quality necessary to inspire and compel\r\nrespect from all nations. In our own God-given faculties lie both the\r\n'_Procul, procul, este profani!_' and the 'Tread not on me, or I bite,'\r\nwhich in all ages have constituted so-called national honor and pride,\r\nand which will be to us the broad ægis of protection when the\r\nstorm-cloud of war darkens the horizon of the world. If this fail, the\r\nfault will be our own; we shall be unworthy custodians of the treasure;\r\nour downfall will be merited as it is sudden and sure, and few will be\r\nfound to mourn over us.\r\n\r\nAs the effervescence of new wine brings all impurities to the surface,\r\ncasting off those noxious superfluities whose presence is pollution to\r\nthe liquid and disease and death to the partaker, so the present war is\r\nbut the effervescence of our as yet new and unpurified political system,\r\nwhereby all errors and impurities are thrown to the surface of society,\r\nready to be skimmed off by the hand of the people, who are themselves\r\nthe vintners and the rectifiers. No system of government is without\r\nradical defects, and it was not to be expected that our own would be\r\nfree from error, founded as it is upon a principle new to the world, or\r\nonly known as having totally failed in the past through the clumsiness\r\nof its originators and subsequent custodians--a system which had little\r\naid from the experiences of the past, and must necessarily grope in the\r\ndarkness which surrounds all new experiments of this kind, lighted only\r\nby the few, meagre, _à priori_ truths of deductive reasoning. Our\r\nancestors, hampered as they were by the lack of this great experience of\r\nsocial life, legislated for the men and circumstances of their time; and\r\nthough they had ever an eye to the future, yet, conscious of the\r\nfallibility of human wisdom and foresight, they themselves did not\r\nexpect their work to stand unchanged for all time. New circumstances\r\nwould arise--the people themselves would change with time, and with them\r\nmust necessarily change the laws that govern their actions. Law and\r\ngovernment must keep pace with the progress of humanity, else the nation\r\nitself becomes effete, superannuated, deteriorated. Many errors there\r\ndoubtless are in our system, taking their rise as well in the very\r\ncommencement of our existence as from the fluctuations of society. Of\r\nthese, some have hitherto lain inert and concealed, from the very lack\r\nof circumstances to induce their development, and from the lack of a\r\nfield of action. Others have worked so slowly and insidiously as to have\r\nremained totally concealed from our view, as well from the fact of their\r\nnever having as yet been productive of any decided and palpable evil\r\neffect, as from our becoming gradually accustomed to them and their\r\nworkings, and from the preoccupation of the public mind with more\r\nexciting questions. But in all times of popular excitement and tumult,\r\nof revolutionary ideas and attempted violent reform, errors spring forth\r\nin dazzling brightness from the darkness of the past, like Minerva from\r\nthe brain of Jove, armed with the full panoply of destructive war,\r\nclothed in the garb of maturity, and endowed with gigantic strength.\r\nSuch has been the case in our day. As the early spring sun, warming the\r\nlong-frozen soil and heating the foul moistures of the earth, brings to\r\nlife and to the surface of the ground swarming myriads of noxious\r\ninsects and reptiles, who, during the long winter months, have slept\r\nsilent and torpid far down within the oozy depths, and hatches the\r\nthrice-told myriads of eggs deposited in seasons passed away, and which\r\nhave long waited for his life-giving influence to pour forth their\r\nswarming millions to the upper air; even so this war has hatched the\r\neggs of error, and brought forth the torpid defects of long gone-by\r\ndecades, affording them a broad field of operation in their work of\r\ndestruction; while it has at the same time torn away the veil which has\r\nhitherto blinded our eyes, and shown us, in the disasters of to-day, the\r\nculmination of the evil effects of causes which have for long years been\r\nworking secretly at the very core of the body politic. But not alone has\r\nit brought forth error and corruption; for the same harsh influence has\r\nalso revivified the seeds of virtue and awakened the sleeping lion of\r\njustice, uprightness, and national honor, which shall act as healthful\r\ncounterbalances to all the evil, and supplant the monsters of\r\ndestructive error.\r\n\r\nFor in the [Greek: gnôthi seauton] of the Greek philosopher lies the\r\nsecret of all reform. To know one's faults is already one half the\r\nbattle to correct them. He who becomes conscious that health of body and\r\nmind are steadily yielding to the inroads of an insidious foe, is worse\r\nthan a fool if he do not at once apply the knife to the seat of disease,\r\nhowever painful may be the operation. And though to-day we hear but\r\nlittle of reform, and all parties seem striving which shall display the\r\nmost devotion to the cause of the past, the most affection for the\r\nunchanged and unchangeable _status quo ante bellum_ in all things, yet\r\nis the popular mind not the less earnestly though silently working.\r\nTo-day we have a task which occupies all our attention, absorbs all our\r\npowers and resources, and there is no time for reform: the all-absorbing\r\nand vital question being the establishing of things upon the old\r\nfooting. But, peace restored, and the deathblow given to treason, the\r\nwork of reform will commence. Then will become manifest the workings of\r\nthe great mind of the nation during all this trying and bloody war. To\r\nacknowledge our defects and miscomings now, is but to give a handle to\r\nthe enemies of our cause: but, this danger removed, the axe will at once\r\nbe laid at the root of those evils which have come nigh to working our\r\ndestruction; all the unsightly excrescences which have for years been\r\naccumulating upon the trunk of our goodly tree will be carefully pruned\r\naway, and the result will be a healthier and more abundant fruit in the\r\ndays to come. And these reforms will be brought about quietly, yet with\r\na firm and vigorous hand, and in a manner that will show to the world\r\nour determination henceforth to leave no loophole for the entrance of\r\nthe destroyer.\r\n\r\nNo race of _thinkers_ can ever be enslaved. Hitherto we have been too\r\nunreflecting, too much governed by momentary impulses, too much carried\r\naway by party cries and unhealthy enthusiasm, and hence completely\r\nbeneath the sway of designing demagogues. We have left the politicians\r\nto do our thinking for us, and accepted too unhesitatingly their\r\ninterested dicta as our rules of political action. The press has\r\nhitherto led the people, and so mighty an engine of political power has\r\nbeen eagerly seized and controlled by party leaders as a means of\r\naccomplishing their ends. All this will be done away with. We shall do\r\nour thinking for ourselves, and those who shall hereafter be put forward\r\nas the prominent actors upon the great stage of politics will become,\r\nwhat they have never before been save in name, the servants of the\r\npeople. The press of America, like that of England, must hereafter\r\nfollow, not lead, the sentiments of the nation. And while true 'freedom\r\nof the press' will be religiously conserved, that unrestrained license\r\nwhich has always too much characterized it will be restrained and\r\nbrought within its true limits, not by statutes or brute force, but by\r\nthe much more powerful agency of public opinion--by the danger of\r\ntampering with the cherished and elevated sentiments of the reading\r\nmasses.\r\n\r\nAnd as a result of this newborn faculty of thought, we shall see the\r\ndisappearance of extreme views and the birth of charity in our midst.\r\nMen will give due weight to the opinions and respect more the natural\r\nprejudices of their fellows. While ultra conservatism is the rust which\r\neats away the nation's life, radicalism is the oxygen in which it\r\nconsumes itself too rapidly away. Or perhaps, a better simile would be\r\nfound in the components of atmospheric air--nitrogen and oxygen; the one\r\na non-supporter of combustion, the other giving it a too dazzling\r\nbrilliancy at the expense of the material upon which it feeds; yet both,\r\nproperly combined, so as in a measure to neutralize each other,\r\nsupporting the steady and enduring flame which gives forth a mild and\r\ncheering light and heat, neither dazzling nor scorching. So conservatism\r\nand radicalism, properly intermingled and exercising a restraining\r\ninfluence upon each other, are the very life of a great and free people.\r\nAnd never, in the history of the world, have these principles been more\r\nthoroughly demonstrated, more clearly manifested to the eyes of even the\r\nunlearned and humble, than in the present war, in which one or the other\r\nof these two great mental phases has been the originator of every great\r\nmovement, to make no mention of the palpable effect, now appearing upon\r\nthe face of society, of their action in the past. And hence, in the\r\nfuture, we shall see in a noble, far-reaching, broadly spreading,\r\nheaven-aspiring _conservative radicalism_ the prevailing characteristic\r\nof American life and progress.\r\n\r\nHitherto the very prime principle of self-government, an intelligent\r\ncognizance of public affairs and a reflective insight into the\r\nfundamental principles of liberty, has been totally neglected in our\r\nland. And if the events of these years shall really teach our people to\r\nthink--I care not how erroneously at first, for the very exercise of the\r\nGod-given faculty will soon teach us to discriminate between true and\r\nfalse deductions, and restore Thought to her native empire,--then the\r\nblood and treasure we have so lavishly poured out, the trembling and the\r\nmourning, the trials, the toils, and the privations we have suffered,\r\neven the mighty shock which the society of the whole civilized world has\r\nreceived, will be but a small price to pay for the blessing we shall\r\nhave gained, and our future prosperity will have been easily purchased\r\neven at so tremendous a cost. God grant it may be so.\r\n\r\nThere is no land on earth where treason may work with such impunity as\r\nin our own. And this is owing as well to the greater latitude conceded\r\nto political speculations by the very nature of our system, as to the\r\nfact that our ancestors, having, as they thought, effectually destroyed\r\nall those incentives to treason which exist in more despotic lands, and\r\nlittle anticipating the new motives which might with changing men and\r\ntimes spring up in our midst, neglected to ordain the preventives and\r\nremedies for a disease which they imagined could never flourish in our\r\nhealthy atmosphere. And while they imposed an inadequate penalty, they\r\nat the same time made so difficult the proof of this the greatest of\r\ncrimes, that when at last the monster reared its head and stalked boldly\r\nthrough the land, there was no power to check or destroy it. It will be\r\nours to see, in the future, that this impunity is taken away from this\r\nworse than parricide, and that, while a more awful penalty is affixed to\r\nthe crime, the plotter shall be as amenable to the law and as easy to be\r\nconvicted as he who takes the murderous weapon in his hands.\r\n\r\nAnd for the accomplishment of this and similar ends, doubtless greater\r\npower will be conceded by the States to the Federal Government. The day\r\nhas gone by when the people were frightened at the bare idea of giving\r\nto the central Government the necessary power to maintain its own\r\nintegrity. The pernicious doctrine of State sovereignty as paramount to\r\nthe national, has in this war received its deathblow at the hands of\r\nthose who have always been its most zealous supporters. The South,\r\nstarting out upon the very basis of this greatest political heresy of\r\nour age, had no sooner taken the initiatory step in severing completely\r\nall the ties and bonds which held them to the Union, than they discarded\r\nthe very doctrine which had been their strongest weapon in forcing their\r\npeople to revolt: well knowing that no government founded upon such a\r\nbasis could stand for a single year; that the upholding of such a\r\nprinciple was neither more nor less than political suicide. And though\r\nat the commencement of our struggle there were many at the North in\r\nwhose minds the dogma had taken deep root, few are found to-day to\r\nuphold the pernicious doctrine, and those few men of more than\r\nquestionable loyalty. And not this principle only, but every other which\r\nis inconsistent with republican ideas, antagonistic to the growth of the\r\ngiant plant of human freedom, has come to its death at the hands of the\r\ngod of war. Great commotions are the test of great ideas, and that\r\nprinciple either of government or of human action which can withstand\r\nthe shock of such an upheaving as the present, and come unharmed through\r\nthe war of such conflicting elements, may well claim our support as\r\nfounded in eternal truth. The penetrating glance of human intellect,\r\nsharpened by the perilous exigencies of the times, and by the quick\r\nsuccession of startling events, even as the inventive faculties are said\r\nto be rendered more acute by the presence of danger, at such times sees\r\nclearly the fallacies which perhaps have blinded mankind for years, and\r\nrecognizes, with unerring certainty, the misfortunes and disasters of\r\nto-day as the evil effects of theories which aforetime were only\r\nconsidered capable of good.\r\n\r\nAnd with these theories must inevitably fall their supporters and\r\npromulgators. The men who have persistently misled the public mind and\r\nfalsified the experience of the past as well as the deductions of\r\nabstract reasoning, and who, consequently, if not the originators, are\r\nat least the aggravators, of all our misfortunes, need expect no mercy\r\nat the hands of the people. They must share the fate of their doctrines,\r\nand consent to be quietly shelved, buried beyond the hope of a\r\nresurrection: and it is to be hoped that their places will be filled by\r\ngood, earnest, and true men, who have proved themselves devoted to the\r\ncause of our country's advancement rather than to that of personal\r\npreferment. In this war, the men of the future must make their record,\r\nand whenever they shall come before the people for the posts of honor\r\nand distinction, they will be judged according as they have to-day\r\nsacrificed personal prejudices and partisan feeling upon the altar of\r\nunity and freedom. For years to come the first question concerning a\r\ncandidate will be, Was he loyal in the troublous times? was he earnest\r\nand true? There will be no distinction between the truly loyal Democrat\r\nand the earnest Republican. Those who have to-day stood shoulder to\r\nshoulder in the common cause will, whatever may be their difference in\r\nshades of opinion, be sworn friends in the future; while he who has in\r\nthese times been only noted for a carping, cavilling spirit, for\r\nactivity in endeavors to hamper and thwart the constituted authorities\r\nin their efforts to restore and maintain the integrity of the\r\nGovernment, will to their dying day wear the damning mark of Cain upon\r\ntheir brows: their record will bear a stain which no subsequent effort\r\ncan wipe away. And though in the days to come other exciting questions\r\nwill arise to divide the people into strongly opposing parties, which,\r\nindeed, are necessary to all true national life, preserving the balance\r\nof political power, acting as a check upon injudicious and interested\r\nlegislation, and, above all, evolving truths by the very attrition of\r\nconflicting ideas, yet the intimate association of the past, bringing\r\nabout a thorough acquaintance with the virtues and patriotism of the\r\ngreat mass of those who profess radically different ideas and opinions,\r\nas well as the wearing off of the sharp corners of those ideas\r\nthemselves by a closer and more impartial observation, will tend to\r\nsmooth away the asperities of partisan conflict, and beget greater\r\ncharity and more respect for the opposing opinions of others, based upon\r\na knowledge of the purity of intention and loftiness of purpose of\r\npolitical opponents. The evils of sectional feeling and sectional\r\nlegislation, so clearly manifested in present events, will be avoided in\r\nthe future, as the Maelstrom current which sucks in the stoutest bark to\r\ninevitable destruction: and while we shall still retain that natural\r\nlove of home which binds us most closely to the place of our abode, the\r\nprinciple will be recognized that the well-being of the whole can only\r\nlie in the soundness and prosperity of each particular part, and we\r\nshall know no dividing lines in our love of country, but all become\r\nmembers of one great brotherhood, citizens of one common and united\r\ncountry. The experience of the past will teach us to religiously avoid\r\nthe snares and pitfalls that beset our path, the hidden rocks and shoals\r\nupon which our bark had wellnigh stranded; and the science of politics\r\nwill henceforward have a broader sweep, a loftier appreciation of\r\nnational responsibility, a purer benevolence, a sublimer philanthropy.\r\n\r\nAmong the influences which will greatly modify the future of American\r\npolitics, not the least is the lately enacted banking law. Hitherto we\r\nhave been divided in our finances as no nation ever was before. Every\r\nindividual State has had not only its own system of banking, but its own\r\nseparate and distinct currency; a currency oftentimes based upon an\r\ninsufficient security, and possessing only a local par value. The\r\ntraveller who would journey from one portion of the country to another\r\nwas driven to the alternative of converting his funds into bills of\r\nexchange, or of shopping from broker to broker to procure the currency\r\nof the particular localities which he proposed to visit. Not to mention\r\nthe inconvenience of such a state of things, it is productive of many\r\ndire evils, which it is not my purpose to enumerate, since they are\r\nalready familiar to the majority of my readers. Suffice it to say that\r\nsuch a diversity in a point so vital to all enlightened nations, is\r\nantagonistic to the very spirit of our institutions, under a government\r\nwhose existence depends upon the principle of unity, in a land whose\r\nprosperity depends upon the consolidation of all its constituent parts\r\ninto one homogeneous whole. Not only is this diversity in the money\r\nmarket forever destroyed by the establishment of a uniform currency, but\r\nfrom the peculiar nature of the law, the stability of the Government is\r\nmade a matter of direct self-interest to every individual citizen, than\r\nwhich no surer or more enduring bond of union can be devised. For\r\nself-interest, the Archimedean lever that moves the world, loses no jot\r\nof its influence when even honor and patriotism have withered away.\r\nEvery dollar of the security upon which the currency is based must be\r\ndeposited in the treasury vaults: in other words, the wealth of every\r\nindividual citizen is under Government lock and key. Should, then, in\r\nthe future, any misguided portion of our people see fit to withdraw from\r\nour communion, irretrievable ruin not only stares them in the face, but\r\nis actually upon them from the moment the bond is severed. On the one\r\nside is devotion to the country, and a firm, secure currency, which at\r\nany moment will bring its full value in gold; on the other, secession,\r\nwith the inevitable attendant of a circulation, not depreciated, but\r\nutterly worthless, and that, too, with no other to fill its place, since\r\nthe operation of the law must soon drive out of existence every dollar\r\nof the present local bank circulation: patriotism and prosperity arrayed\r\nagainst rebellion and ruin. The business men all see this, and in the\r\nevent of any threatened disruption, they, the most influential part of\r\ncommunity, because controlling that which is the representative of all\r\nvalue, will be found firm and unwavering on the side of the duly\r\nconstituted authority. Thus we shall have all the benefits of a funded\r\nnational debt, with none of its attendant evils. And what a bond of\r\nunion is this!--a bond which involves our very meat and drink, a bond\r\nwhich there can be no possible motive to sever so powerful as the\r\nincentive to union and mutual coöperation.\r\n\r\nAgain, the financial crises with which our country has been afflicted at\r\nregular periods of her existence, lowering thousands at one moment from\r\na condition of ease and comfort to one of the most pinching want,\r\nchanging merchant princes to beggars, and spreading ruin far and wide,\r\nhave owed their origin, not to a wild spirit of speculation, but to the\r\nover inflation of bank issues, which is itself the cause of that\r\nreckless speculation. This evil, too, will be done away with in the\r\nfuture, for the issue must and will be regulated by the demands of the\r\ncommunity. The Government, in whose hands are the securities, and who\r\nfurnish the circulation based thereon, will control this matter and\r\nrestrain the issue to its proper bounds. And even if it should run\r\nbeyond that point, there will be less danger, since there can be no\r\nspurious basis, every dollar being secured by a tangible deposit in the\r\nGovernment vaults. The only escape from this view is in open and\r\nbarefaced fraud, which will be easy of conviction, and no more to be\r\nfeared than the ordinary operations of counterfeiters, and which will be\r\neffectually provided against. So carefully drawn are the provisions of\r\nthe bill that no loophole is left for speculation; and he who shall\r\nhereafter succeed in flooding the country with a 'wildcat' currency,\r\nwill be a shrewder financier and a more accomplished villain than the\r\nworld has yet seen. The people, too, will repose such a confidence in\r\nthe banks as they have never done before. We shall hear little hereafter\r\nof 'runs upon the banks;' for the currency holders, well knowing that\r\nthe Government holds in its hands the wherewithal to redeem the greater\r\nportion of the circulation of every bank in the land in the event of the\r\nclosing of its doors, the only 'runs' will be upon the deposits, and\r\nthis only in cases of the grossest and most patent fraud and\r\nmismanagement on the part of the banks themselves. Hence, in times of\r\nfinancial peril we shall see the people combining to sustain the banks\r\nof their own locality, rather than, as is the case to-day, hastening to\r\naccelerate the ruin of perfectly solvent institutions which, but for\r\ntheir ill-timed fright, might weather the storm. Again I say, there\r\ncould be no greater element of union and strength than this, which has\r\ngrown out of our necessities and tribulations. In spite of all the\r\nconfusion and ruin and bloodshed, in spite of all the mourning, and\r\nsuffering, and sundering of ties, and upheaving of the very foundations\r\nand apparent total disruption of American society, no greater blessing\r\ncould have befallen us than this same war, which has roused us to a new\r\nlife, to the consciousness of defects and determination of reform,\r\nthereby planting us firmly on the true road to prosperity and happiness\r\nand power.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful display of our power and resources has given a\r\nreputation--call it notoriety, if you will--among the middle and lower\r\nclasses of the old world, which in long years of peace we could not have\r\nattained. And our success in withstanding the terrible tempest which has\r\nassailed us, in maintaining the integrity of our political system, will\r\nspread that reputation far and wide, and give us a prestige whose effect\r\nwill be seen in the increased tide of immigration that will flow in upon\r\nus upon the reëstablishment of peace. The teeming soil and salubrious\r\nclimate of the far West, together with the prospect it affords, not only\r\nof wealth, but of social advancement, both of which are forever denied\r\nthem in their own country, and extremely difficult of attainment even in\r\nour own Eastern States, where the population is dense and every branch\r\nof industry crowded to repletion, will allure the hardy laborers of\r\nEurope by thousands and tens of thousands to the prairie land. In the\r\nimmense unsettled tracts west of the Mississippi there is room for the\r\naction of men inured to toil, and promise of quick and abundant returns\r\nfor their labor. There they will be free from the disastrous competition\r\nof their superiors in education and enlightenment, and have\r\nopportunities such as no other portion of the earth presents, for the\r\nfounding of communities of their own, and the practical realization of\r\ntheir own ideas of social progress. Comparatively few years will pass\r\nafter the restoration of peace before the West will be peopled by the\r\nvery bone and sinew of all civilized nations. And these men will come to\r\nour shores imbued with the bitterest hatred of monarchical institutions,\r\nand an unbounded admiration and love of our own. Hence the new country\r\nwill be intensely republican in its tendencies, and this will be another\r\nstrong bond of union--another mighty element of strength and perpetuity\r\nto republicanism. For, as the movement goes steadily on, in time the\r\nbalance of political power will rest with them. And it will be ours to\r\nsee that the strong bias in favor of antiquated customs, laws, and\r\nusages, the result of centuries of unopposed tyranny, is eradicated from\r\nthe minds of these men. They must be properly instructed in the\r\nprinciples of true liberty and self-government. They must be\r\nfamiliarized with the workings of free institutions and put to school in\r\nthe experience of our century of experiment. Our very safety requires\r\nit; for so great is the field and so quickly will it be filled, that if\r\nwe are not alive to the work, a mighty nation will soon have sprung up\r\non our borders, and almost in our midst, which will be entirely beyond\r\nour control, and threaten the very existence of our race, and of the\r\nprinciples we most cherish. For the danger is that, suddenly released\r\nfrom all the restrictions of their own feudal climes, they will fly to\r\nthe other extreme, and become lawless, reckless, and turbulent. For many\r\nyears to come all legislation must have an eye to the possible and\r\nprobable capacities and immense importance of the yet unsettled West,\r\nand to the exigencies arising from causes which at present we know not\r\nof save by conjecture. We have a future before us such as the past has\r\nnever known, and an incentive, nay, rather a necessity, for more\r\nvigorous action than we have yet been called upon to display, and for a\r\ndeeper and more far-sighted wisdom than has ever yet pervaded our\r\ncouncils.\r\n\r\nThe religious future of this portion of our country is veiled in the\r\ndeepest obscurity. Here we shall have the free-thinking German, the\r\nbigoted Roman Catholic, the atheistic Frenchman, and the latitudinarian\r\nYankee, in one grand heterogeneous conglomeration of nations and ideas\r\nsuch as the world has never seen. Whether these diverse peculiarities\r\nwill by close contact and mutual attrition, by the advancing light of\r\neducation and refinement as well as by the progress of intellect, be in\r\ntime softened down, assimilated, and fused into a pure, elevating\r\nreligion, or aggravated till they result in a godless, materialistic\r\nrace, God only knows. For no man was ever yet able to prognosticate of\r\nreligion, or prophecy with the remotest degree of its future action. For\r\nit is a thing of God, under his exclusive care, and subject to none of\r\nthe influences of human action. In His hands we must leave it, in the\r\nearnest hope and belief that He will not suffer His divine purposes to\r\nbe thwarted, and this people, to whom He has intrusted the task of the\r\nworld's regeneration, to forget and deny their God, who has led them on\r\nto power and prosperity and happiness, to go back upon the scale of the\r\nsoul's eternal progress, and become a race of wicked, corrupt, and\r\nGod-defying sensualists.\r\n\r\nYet there is no maxim more true than that 'the gods help those who help\r\nthemselves,' and in this great work of religious advancement we have\r\nnevertheless a part to act, a duty to perform. And the day is not far\r\ndistant when the work of the missionary in our own land will overshadow\r\nthat of the teacher in African climes. Here will be an ample field for\r\nall our exertions, all our contributions; and if we do our duty by our\r\nown people, we shall be forced, for a time at least, to leave the task\r\nof instructing the heathen of foreign lands to the Christian nations of\r\nthe Old World. Our greatest responsibility is here, and it behooves us\r\nto look well to the religious culture of our own rapidly increasing\r\npopulation, that in after times they may be fitted for the task of\r\nChristianizing the world.\r\n\r\nEvery nation has its crisis, when its existence trembles in the balance,\r\nand through which it must safely pass before it can be firmly\r\nestablished as a great fact in history, a tangible landmark of progress,\r\na controlling influence in the affairs of humanity. Nor is this crisis\r\never a mere fortuitous circumstance, but the necessary consequence of\r\nconflicting ideas and of untried systems. It is that point in the great\r\nprocess of assimilation when different and hitherto almost discordant\r\nelements tremble on the verge either of a harmonious blending for all\r\ntime, or of flying off into eternal divergence and hostility. Hence it\r\nwas not to be imagined that we could escape the common lot: our crisis\r\nwas to be expected, and now that it has come upon us it is to be\r\nmanfully met, and so controlled by an iron will, a loftiness of\r\ndetermination, and a purity of aim, that it leave us not stranded among\r\nthe breakers of disunion and political death. And if we shall succeed in\r\nso controlling the mighty current of affairs, we may rest assured that\r\nwe shall be purified by the trial, and shall have established a position\r\non earth that no subsequent events can shake, until God, in His own good\r\ntime, shall bid us give way to some higher development of mankind, if\r\nsuch shall be His will. With a noble and worthy nationality; with an\r\nincontestable position of strength and political influence, a widely\r\ndiffused skill and experience in military affairs, a fund of warlike\r\ninvention, and unbounded physical resources, which shall free us from\r\nall annoyances and intermeddlings at the hands of foreign nations; with\r\na purification from the errors of the past, and a deeper insight into\r\nthe capabilities as well as the exigencies of the present and the\r\nfuture; with a regenerated and higher-toned press; with an _anathema\r\nmaranatha_ for treason, in whatever shape it may assume; with a purer\r\ncharity for the opinions of others, and a more graceful yielding of the\r\nobnoxious characteristics of our own; with a firmly established and\r\nhealth-giving system of finance; with a rapidly increasing population,\r\nbringing with it an increase of responsibility, and furnishing a broader\r\nfield for the development of our energies and resources; with a glorious\r\npast behind and a golden future before us, we shall sweep majestically\r\non upon the waves of time, an object of admiration to the world and of\r\njustifiable pride to ourselves--a great, and glorious, and, above all, a\r\nfree, happy, united, and prosperous people. God grant it may be so! God\r\ngrant that we may be true to the trust reposed in us, and that the\r\nglorious cause of human liberty--the cause in which are bound up the\r\nhopes of the whole world--may not again fall to the earth through the\r\nblindness and weakness and incompetence of us, who are to-day its only\r\nexponents. May we of this day and generation live to see the crowning of\r\nall these hopes; and when our sun goes down in the shadows of eternity,\r\nmay we be able to look back and thank God for the trials and sufferings\r\nand losses and mournings of to-day, as the refining fire through which\r\nwe have come strong and bright, the sharp knife whereby the gnawing\r\nworms of error, and corruption and inevitable death have been cut from\r\nthe heart of our goodly tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOD'S HARP.\r\n\r\nFROM AN UNWRITTEN POEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n    God struck the heavens' holy Harp,\r\n      While sang the grand celestial choir.\r\n    Earth heard the awful sound, and saw\r\n      The trembling of the golden wire.\r\n    'Twas thunder to the stranger ear,\r\n      And to the eye the lightning's fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN LEAVES.\r\n\r\n                       'O Heaven! were man\r\n    But constant, he were perfect; that one error\r\n    Fills him with faults, makes him run through all sins.'\r\n\r\n                            _Two Gentlemen of Verona_\r\n\r\n\r\n    Are they truly dying,\r\n      All the summer leaves?\r\n    Will the blasts of autumn\r\n      Strip the happy trees?\r\n    Bright the glowing foliage\r\n      Paints the misty air--\r\n    Crimson, purple, golden--\r\n      Must they die--so fair?\r\n\r\n    Where has flown the sunshine\r\n      Wooed them to their birth,\r\n    Tempting them to flutter\r\n      Far above the earth?\r\n    Ruthless did it leave them\r\n      In their hour of bloom,\r\n    Let the chill blasts whisper\r\n      Tales of death and doom?\r\n\r\n    Rapidly they robed them\r\n      In each varied hue,\r\n    Hoping thus the sunshine\r\n      To attract anew;\r\n    But the fickle glitter\r\n      Looked in anger down,\r\n    Freezing up the life-pulse\r\n      With an icy frown.\r\n\r\n    Then the happy radiance\r\n      Sinks to rise no more;\r\n    Leaves of gold and crimson\r\n      Strew earth's gloomy floor.\r\n    Gone their summer glory,\r\n      Lifeless, lost, they lie;\r\n    Wilted, withered, drifting\r\n      As winds will, they fly.\r\n\r\n    Thus in woman's bosom\r\n      Love wakes bud and bloom,\r\n    'Neath his glowing sunshine\r\n      Thinking not of doom;\r\n    Covering soft life's desert\r\n      Spread the branches green,\r\n    Hope's bright birds sing through them--\r\n      Close the leafy screen.\r\n\r\n    Through the quivering foliage\r\n      Falls a sudden fear!\r\n    Leaves are rustling, trembling--\r\n      Feel _change_ drawing near!\r\n    Brighter then they robe them,\r\n      Call on every hue,\r\n    Color every fibre--\r\n      Love to win anew.\r\n\r\n    Summon gold and crimson,\r\n      Bright as dyed in blood;\r\n    Hectic fever flushes\r\n      Pour in anguished flood!\r\n    Gone the healthful quiet\r\n      Of the summer green;\r\n    Hope-birds turn to ravens,\r\n      Sighs the leafy screen.\r\n\r\n    Love looks down in anger\r\n      On the wildering show;\r\n    Freezing follows change-frost--\r\n      Love heaps ice and snow!\r\n    Then the fevered radiance\r\n      Fades from life's doomed tree;\r\n    Wilted, withered, drifting,\r\n      Bud, bloom, leaves we see.\r\n\r\n    Love looks down upon them,\r\n      Wonders how it came--\r\n    Thinks through all his changing\r\n      They should bloom the same:\r\n    Did not know his change-frost\r\n      Had the power to kill;\r\n    Did not deem his frowning\r\n      Life's quick pulse could still!\r\n\r\n    Gone the fickle sunshine!\r\n      Gone the rosy hours!\r\n    Gone love's early wooing!\r\n      Gone the healthful powers!\r\n    Come and cool the hectic,\r\n      Chill the fevered glow,\r\n    Pale the crimson flushing,\r\n      Death, beneath thy snow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACROSS MAINE IN MID-WINTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA journey by stage coach in these days, when railroads are fast\r\npenetrating to the remotest corners of our country, has already become a\r\nsomewhat novel experience. In the course of comparatively few years,\r\neven the 'air line' will have given place to an international railway,\r\nconnecting us immediately with New Brunswick, and the stage coaches of\r\nthis region will be among the reminiscences of the past.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which this journey of mine was performed were\r\nmost painful. Still, through that remarkable power of the human mind,\r\nwhich seems to act independently of volition, that mysterious duality of\r\nbeing which observes, discriminates, and remembers, while at the same\r\ntime preoccupied by an overwhelming grief, I was enabled to note each\r\nlittle incident with more than usual intensity.\r\n\r\nWas it that they stood out in bolder, more sharply cut relief, because\r\nof the dark background of emotion behind?\r\n\r\nThere had been little, if any, snow on the island all the winter, and\r\nthe morning of the 26th of January was bright and mild as April. Indeed,\r\nit was difficult to imagine it winter.\r\n\r\n'Come, Fred,' said I to my second little boy, 'We must take a walk to\r\nthe batteries this fine morning.'\r\n\r\nAs I stood upon the height, while the little fellow frisked about among\r\nthe rocks, I stretched my eyes westward toward the hills and forests of\r\nthe mainland, and thought of my father and mother, and of the letter\r\nwhich I almost knew was on its way to me then. Ah! little did I dream\r\nthat at that very moment the gaunt sentinels of the telegraph were\r\ntossing from one to another, with lightning speed, a message of woe for\r\nme. Its long journey of four hundred miles was accomplished in less time\r\nthan my short walk. I had just returned when it arrived.\r\n\r\nI saw by my husband's countenance as he read it, and by his extreme\r\ntenderness of manner toward me, that a great misfortune had befallen me.\r\nI sank down on the floor beside him, trembling with apprehension, yet\r\nlonging to know the worst. 'Is it mother?' I gasped. He handed me the\r\ntelegram, which was directed to him:\r\n\r\n'Your father-in-law died this morning. Can Elsie come to the funeral? If\r\nso, what day? Telegraph immediately.'\r\n\r\nAnd this was all. My father was _dead_! How long he had been ill, or\r\nwhat was his disease, I knew not. 'Why did they not send for me sooner,\r\nthat I might have seen him alive once more?' I asked, in the first\r\nunreasoning agony of grief. But he was _dead_. All I could do for him\r\nnow was to yield him my last tribute of reverence and affection.\r\n\r\n'Can Elsie come to the funeral?' Yes, I could go. It was all I could do\r\nfor my father now; I knew that. My family would be well cared for in my\r\nabsence. My husband did not oppose me, though he could not approve. But\r\nhe exerted himself in every way to further my plans.\r\n\r\nThere were difficulties at the outset. The regular morning stage had\r\nalready left. The 'air line,' as it is called, was the only route\r\nremaining to me. Now this 'air line' started from a point thirty miles\r\nnorth of us, and lay through ninety miles of wilderness. I had heard of\r\nit before I ever came to the island, and had been told a wild story\r\nabout a stage coach having been chased by a pack of wolves for several\r\nmiles on this route a few years before. The innkeeper, too, spoke very\r\ndubiously about it to my husband. But what were the hundred and twenty\r\nmiles between me and the cars--the four hundred between me and my\r\nfather, then! Should these few miles of earth detain me? No! It was\r\npossible for me to go, and go I must.\r\n\r\nMy preparations were soon made; but I found, to my dismay, on applying\r\nfor a passage in the stage to C----(where the journey proper would\r\nbegin) that all the seats were taken. The innkeeper sent me word,\r\nhowever, that he would furnish me a private conveyance, if I _must_ go.\r\nSo at two o'clock, P.M., an open, low-backed buggy appeared at my gate.\r\nI kissed my little ones, who gathered wonderingly around to 'see mamma\r\ngo away,' and wrapping my old plaided cloak about me (the cloak I wore\r\nwhen a child), I seated myself beside the buffalo-bundled driver, and\r\nwas soon whirling out of town.\r\n\r\nThe air was soft and mild, and no snow was to be seen except a little\r\nhere and there by the roadside as we advanced northward. The sky had\r\nbecome overcast, and showed signs of an approaching storm. The scenery\r\nwas generally bare and uninteresting. We followed the St. Croix river in\r\nits course. Opposite St. Andrews it widens into a broad bay. It was then\r\nnear sunset, and the clouds broke away a little and gave a cheery, rosy\r\nflush to the calm water.\r\n\r\nNight soon settled down upon us. It was dark when we arrived at the ----\r\nHotel, after a drive of five hours. I had never been in C----, and this\r\nwas my first experience in hotel life alone.\r\n\r\nI was ushered into a large, lonesome room, in total darkness except for\r\nthe light from the hall burner, which streamed dismally into its depths.\r\nA tall, black shadow soon announced himself as the landlord, to whom I\r\nmade known my wants. His wife, a kind-hearted, energetic woman, took\r\ncompassion on me, and showed me into her own private parlor to get\r\nwarmed, for I was very chilly. Here the good lady's curiosity was piqued\r\nsomewhat to find that the young man who accompanied me was _not_ my\r\nhusband, and that I proposed to go on the next morning to Bangor alone.\r\nI shuddered when she told me the journey was usually made in an open\r\nconveyance. Think of riding all day and all night on a board slung\r\nacross an open wagon! And what if it should _rain_!\r\n\r\nI bethought myself of two friends of mine who were visiting in C----,\r\nand to them I despatched my cards. After tea, when I was seated quietly\r\nin my room, Aunt Carter came. She is one of those good, kind souls who\r\nare always aunts to everybody. She came to me with hearty sympathy. The\r\nevening passed pleasantly away, for her simple words of faith and hope\r\ncheered and consoled me.\r\n\r\nI slept but little that night. I lay thinking of my father, and of the\r\nmorrow's journey, and listening to every sound. I fancied I heard it\r\nraining. At last I was almost sure of it. When I peeped out of the\r\nwindow in the gray of the dawn, the ground was white, and it was snowing\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nSoon after breakfast my kind friends appeared, and the good clergyman\r\nalso, who went down to make some inquiries about the stage coach for me,\r\nand, returning soon, announced with a very grave countenance that it had\r\nnot connected with the cars at Bangor for nearly a week. In fact, that\r\nit was unusual for it to do so at this season.\r\n\r\n'It seems to have set in for a storm,' said he. 'All our storms this\r\nwinter have terminated in rain. There is a uniformity in storms,' he\r\nadded, lugubriously, 'and if this should turn to rain, you cannot\r\npossibly get through.'\r\n\r\nFor a few moments my purpose was shaken. If I did not succeed in\r\nreaching the cars the next morning, I would be too late for my father's\r\nfuneral, and my journey would be all but in vain. There was my mother,\r\nto be sure, but my whole heart turned to my father now. Could I, ought I\r\nto run this risk?\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, how could I relinquish my object when thus far\r\non the way to it?\r\n\r\nBlessings on Aunt Carter! She came to the rescue.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said she, 'I have found that a good Providence always took care\r\nof me, and _I_ believe He will take care of you. You've begun your\r\njourney and got thus far safely, and _I_ believe you'll get through to\r\nBangor in time. At any rate, if you don't, you will have the\r\nsatisfaction of comforting your mother. I've been about the world\r\nconsiderable,' she continued, 'and I've always found a _man_ to take\r\ncare of me. Now you shall have _my man_ to take care of you.'\r\n\r\nReassured by her hopeful words, I exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Enough, I will go! If there be any power in will, or any speed in\r\nhorses, I will get there!'\r\n\r\nThe minister sighed, but I commenced putting on my cloak. Just then, the\r\nyoung man who had driven me up from the island the day before, came to\r\ntake my parting commands.\r\n\r\n'Tell Mr. K.,' said I, 'that I start under favorable auspices. Is any\r\none going through?'\r\n\r\n'Two passengers, but no ladies,' he replied.\r\n\r\n'Who are they?' I inquired.\r\n\r\n'They are both strangers, from the 'other side''--(the Maine cognomen\r\nfor the neighboring British provinces).\r\n\r\n'What do they look like?'\r\n\r\n'Well, they _look_ like gentlemen, and we _hope_ they are so,' he\r\nreplied, with dubious emphasis.\r\n\r\nAnd these were my favorable auspices! A doubtful snowstorm and two\r\ndoubtful gentlemen! Nevertheless I spoke the truth.\r\n\r\nAt length I was all ready, and the landlady, who was quite interested in\r\nme by that time, took me once more into her parlor with my friends,\r\nwhile waiting for the stage. Again the thought of my travelling\r\ncompanions occurred to me. I inquired if the landlady knew aught of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'Nothing but their names,' said she. 'Neither of them was ever here\r\nbefore. They look a little rough, but you cannot always tell about these\r\nprovince people, they dress so differently from our folks. I dare say\r\nthey are real gentlemen.'\r\n\r\nIt was decided, with the concurrence of my friends, to request an\r\nintroduction to one of them through the landlord, as I was travelling\r\nalone, and might need some aid. If they were as it was 'hoped,' this\r\nwould be an advantage; and if they were not, the formality might be some\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\nI confess I was not strongly prepossessed in their favor when I\r\nconfronted them at the door of the hotel; the one a short, fat figure in\r\na coarse blue coat, with a hood of the same, lined with scarlet; a flat\r\ncloth cap, and long heavy boots, reaching above the knee. An ugly\r\nred-and-green woollen scarf tied around the waist enhanced the oddity of\r\nhis appearance. The other was taller and more slenderly built. His\r\ncomplexion was decidedly 'sandy,' with short, curling hair and a\r\nprodigious mustache. His countenance, like his dress, was grave, the\r\nlatter being an iron-gray travelling suit.\r\n\r\nWith a low bow the landlord presented me to the former. It was a kindly\r\nvoice that said, 'Excuse my mitten,' as, instinctively drawing off my\r\nown, my hand rested a moment in his big, shaggy palm. There was\r\ngood-nature in the face too, from the roguish dark eyes to the genial,\r\nlaughter-loving mouth.\r\n\r\nI trembled, though, as, bidding farewell to my friends, I stepped into\r\nthe coach.\r\n\r\n'Take good care of this lady, driver,' said Aunt Carter, 'for she's a\r\nprecious charge.'\r\n\r\nMy good friend the clergyman was the last one to bid me good-by. He\r\nreached into the coach and shook hands with me, wishing me a prosperous\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nAt last we were off. The snow fell thick and fast and moist. What if it\r\nshould turn to rain? But it was not cold, and I at least was\r\nuncomfortably warm, for my kind friends had provided me with a\r\nwell-heated plank for my feet, and a brick for my hands. It was heavy\r\nsleighing, and we dragged along at the rate of four miles an hour for\r\nthe first twelve or fifteen miles. Occasionally the object of my journey\r\nand the novelty of my situation would come over me like a dream; but I\r\nresolutely buried my grief away down in my heart, and lived on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nI entered into conversation with my travelling companions, whom I\r\nscrutinized narrowly.\r\n\r\nWe had not gone very far before the Englishman unbuttoned his overcoat\r\nand produced what is technically called a 'pocket pistol.' It was a flat\r\nflask of generous proportions, encased in leather, fitting into a silver\r\ndrinking cup below, and with a stopper of the same screwing on the top.\r\nAt any rate, however questionable its contents might be, its appearance\r\noutwardly was highly respectable.\r\n\r\n'By your permission, madam,' said he, pouring a portion into the cup.\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' said I, significantly, 'within reasonable limits.'\r\n\r\n'Of course,' said he, pleasantly, as he offered it to the other\r\ngentleman, since I declined it. I learned to bless them both, and the\r\nbrandy flask into the bargain, before I got to the end of my journey.\r\nBut I will not anticipate.\r\n\r\nThey were intelligent and well-educated. Occasionally the conversation\r\ntook a solemn and earnest tone. We touched on many topics. We discussed\r\nthe Queen and royal family; the Prince of Wales; his visit to this\r\ncountry; his intended marriage, &c.; the prospect of Prince Alfred\r\nbecoming King of Greece; the condition of these United States; the\r\nrebellion, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nI was sorry to find that the young Englishman was strongly tinctured\r\nwith the prejudices now so prevalent in the provinces against\r\nemancipation. He frankly acknowledged that at the time of the 'Trent\r\naffair' his sympathies turned toward the South, but that since he had\r\nread more and thought more on the subject, he had become decidedly in\r\nfavor of the North.\r\n\r\nThe other gentleman was a Scotchman, born and brought up near Gretna\r\nGreen. His recollections of the renowned blacksmith and the runaway\r\ncouples he had often seen riding posthaste to the smithy, with pursuers\r\nclose behind perhaps, were very interesting. He was recently from New\r\nOrleans, where he had resided for several years. He was there through\r\nthe blockade, and served in the city troops several months, though,\r\nbeing a foreigner, he could not be impressed into the regular army on\r\neither side. He was reserved, of course, concerning his opinions, but it\r\nwas easy to see that he regarded General Butler, whom I lauded highly,\r\nwith no friendly eye.\r\n\r\nAt one o'clock we stopped at a dingy little cottage to dine. Here the\r\nEnglishman took me under his special charge, assisting me into the\r\nhouse, while the Scotchman followed after with my plank and brick, which\r\nwere duly set up before the blazing open fire to warm for the next\r\nstage. Here I first saw the Frenchman, who had ridden outside in order\r\nto enjoy his pipe. He was sitting by the fire wringing the moisture from\r\nhis long black hair, and wondering if he could get any 'rum.' On seeing\r\nthe lady he courteously made way, and, after, laying aside my wrappings,\r\nI seated myself before the fire, while waiting for dinner. It was a dim\r\nlittle room, uncarpeted, and poorly furnished with a looking glass, a\r\nmap, and a few wooden chairs, and ornamented by a 'mourning piece,'\r\nwhich hung over the mantel, representing a bareheaded lady with a\r\nhandkerchief at her eyes, standing beside a monument under a weeping\r\nwillow.\r\n\r\nBut the open fire was a sight worth seeing in those days. How it roared\r\nand blazed and crackled and hissed and diffused its hospitable warmth\r\nand ruddy glow all over the little brown room! How cheerfully it\r\ncontrasted with the storm without!\r\n\r\nDinner was soon announced, and as Mr. K.'s last injunction had been to\r\n'be sure to eat, whether I wished to or not,' I prepared to pass through\r\nthe first ordeal of eating against my inclination. There was little to\r\nexcite appetite. The room was browner and dimmer than the one we had\r\njust left; the table was spread with a coarse brown cloth; the bread was\r\nbrown, not honest 'rye and Indian,' but tawny-colored wheat, and sour at\r\nthat; the thick uncomely slices of corned beef were brown too, and the\r\ndishes and plates were all brown. The Englishman looked despondingly on\r\nthe repast, and ventured to inquire if the landlady, a quiet body in a\r\nbrown dress, had any eggs.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' she replied, with a strong nasal twang, 'but they ain't very\r\nfresh. I shud be 'fraid to resk b'ilin' 'em. I could fry some, ef yer\r\nliked.'\r\n\r\n'It's of no consequence, madam,' said the Englishman; but the good\r\nwoman, bent on being accommodating, and observing, ''Twouldn't take but\r\na minute to do 'em,' disappeared into the kitchen, and returned in an\r\nincredibly short space of time with a plate of eggs swimming in grease.\r\nI did the best I could to obey my husband's orders, but with poor\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWe were soon on our way again. At every solitary house along the road we\r\nstopped to leave a mailbag. Whom could the letters be for? we wondered.\r\n\r\nAt one place a pretty girl ran out bareheaded through the snow to take\r\nthe mail. She was neatly dressed, and wore a pretty, bright-colored\r\n'Sontag' over her shoulders, but she spoiled her good looks by chewing\r\nvigorously a mouthful of spruce gum, a custom which prevails in this\r\nregion, probably borrowed from the Indians.\r\n\r\nHere we met the 'return stage' from Bangor--a rough, uncovered sleigh.\r\nThere were two or three province men in it, whom the Englishman\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n'I say,' cried he, 'if you see any of my people, tell them you saw me\r\nabout three days out from Bangor.'\r\n\r\nWe passed on, and met nothing more the rest of the journey. The snow\r\nshut off the distant views from us, but, clinging to every twig and rock\r\nand stump, gave a fairy-like beauty to the otherwise dreary scene. The\r\nalder bushes were particularly beautiful, filled as they were with balls\r\nof snow, resembling large bunches of white flowers.\r\n\r\nThe forest was mostly small second growth. Much of the country was\r\npartially cleared, and long logs lay by the roadside, some of which we\r\nwere several minutes in passing. The stumps had been left three or four\r\nfeet high. These, blackened by fire or storms, and crowned with snow,\r\ninclined their square heads forward, as if seeking to catch a glimpse of\r\nus as we passed.\r\n\r\nThe way grew more lonesome and dreary every mile, and the snow more fine\r\nand moist. Would it turn to rain? There were no bells on the horses, and\r\nthe driver, a surly, silent fellow, had not even an encouraging\r\n'chirrup' for them, while the muffled crunching of the soft snow by the\r\nrunners seemed to have a somnolent influence upon them, judging from our\r\nprogress. Occasionally the gentlemen would get out and run up the hills,\r\nand once the Englishman fell full length, and jumped in again, his blue\r\ncoat and peaked hood well frosted with snow, looking, were it not for\r\nhis youthful face, the very impersonation of Santa Claus. He had a\r\npowerful physique, and was full of vitality. These runs in the snow\r\nseemed to refresh him greatly, while they exhausted the more delicate\r\nScotchman.\r\n\r\nIn vain we looked for the wolves. We half wished they might appear, that\r\nthe horses might quicken their paces. Not a sign of life was anywhere to\r\nbe seen, except one flock of snow-birds on the top of a hill.\r\n\r\nConversation still went on, but the intervals of silence were longer and\r\nmore frequent, and the burden of my sudden grief would press upon me\r\nheavily at times. My anxiety and excitement, too, lest I should not make\r\nthe connection with the cars, increased as the day advanced. At last the\r\nmonotonous motion of the stage coach, added to the agitated state of my\r\nnerves, began to affect me like the rolling of the sea. The trees of the\r\nforest seemed to waltz around me in mazy circles. Faster and faster they\r\nwhirled, till my sight grew dim and I could scarcely distinguish them at\r\nall. My senses were winding up. I felt them slipping from me in spite of\r\nthe strongest effort of my will to hold them. A confused sound filled my\r\nears; my strength failed me; I drooped heavily; but Aunt Carter's 'man'\r\nwas by me, sure enough. His protecting arm supported me, and his calm\r\nand steady voice penetrated even my deadened hearing, as he asked my\r\npermission to apply some snow to my forehead. I uttered an almost\r\ninarticulate assent. There was one blank moment, and then the refreshing\r\ncoolness on my brow and on my hands revived me. I apologized for the\r\ntrouble I had given. 'We all have mothers and sisters,' he replied,\r\nquietly, as he poured a draught from his travelling flask for me. My\r\ndistrust of him and his 'pocket pistol,' too, had vanished.\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman also was unwearied in his attention to my comfort. Did the\r\nsnow blow in upon me? He would lower the curtain. Did I wish more air?\r\nhe would raise it again. Were my feet becoming chilled? He would tuck in\r\nthe buffalo. Between the two I fared certainly as comfortably as\r\ncircumstances would permit.\r\n\r\nThe weather was still mild, though colder than before. As the day wore\r\non, the wind began to rise, and I observed frequent eddies and\r\nwhirlwinds of snow and ominous grooves around every wayside stone. Would\r\nthe storm increase and drift? In that case my chance of getting to\r\nBangor in time was doubtful enough.\r\n\r\nWe reached our next stopping place at half past four, P.M. It was a\r\nweather-stained house, which we must have entered by the back door, for\r\nwe passed into the kitchen at once, where were a stout, pleasant-faced\r\nwoman, with two stout, pleasant-faced daughters, and a big fat yellow\r\ndog, who sat up in a chair beside them at the window, as though he were\r\nindeed a part of the family. We were ushered into a small room beyond,\r\nwhich rejoiced in another glorious wood fire, before which the\r\nEnglishman duly planted me, and the Scotchman my plank and brick. Over\r\nthe mantel was another version of the sepulchral monument with the\r\nweeping woman and willow, in whimsical contrast with the jolly,\r\nrollicking fire beneath, which gave us such a hearty welcome.\r\n\r\nAs we sat luxuriating in the warmth, the two fat girls in the kitchen\r\nbegan to vocalize with low sweet voices that harmonized pleasantly, 'Do,\r\nre, mi, si, la, si, do.' Evidently there had been a singing school in\r\nthe neighborhood. Presently they struck into 'Marching Along,' which\r\nthey sang with considerable spirit.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, an overgrown youth, apparently belonging to the house,\r\nwho sat in one corner, tilting his chair, said, addressing all of us at\r\nonce, 'Wal, you've got the wust half the road before yer now. Thur's a\r\nhill a mile an' a half long, jest out here a little ways. You'll have to\r\nbreak yer own roads, I reckon; there's nothin' else goin' along to-day.\r\nStorm's gittin' wuss.'\r\n\r\nWe looked dubiously at each other, and he, probably observing my anxious\r\ncountenance, endeavored to reassure us by saying, in an uncertain tone,\r\n'But I _rayther_ guess you'll git through.'\r\n\r\nWe were soon off again on the next stage, which was to be twenty-four\r\nmiles, without any stopping-place or village between. We ascended many\r\nhills, in fact there seemed to be no going down to any of them; but when\r\nthe horses came to a dead halt, and the coach began to slip backward,\r\nand the driver called out, 'I guess, gentlemen, you'll hev to git out\r\nhere for a spell,' we knew we had come to the hill 'a mile an' a half\r\nlong.' I kept my place, for my weight was too inconsiderable to make\r\nmuch difference. The Englishman, taking hold of the coach, helped the\r\nhorses to start again with a vigorous push, and then the three\r\npassengers went plunging through the snow till the driver stopped and\r\ntook them in again, quite out of breath.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the depths of the forest, many miles from any house.\r\nOccasionally we passed a deserted lumberman's hut by the wayside, and\r\ndiscussed the liability of a breakdown or an overturn in that wild\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nThe white-headed, square-faced stumps which abounded in the partially\r\ncleared tracts, peered in upon us for mile after mile with haunting\r\nrepetition.\r\n\r\nThe trees were heavily laden with snow, which they shook down upon us as\r\nwe brushed along beneath their low-bending branches. In the dim twilight\r\nthey assumed every variety of fanciful form. There were gaunt old trees,\r\nwith gnarled and twisted branches, outstretched like arms in deadly\r\nLaocoon-like struggle with the writhing winds and storms; there were\r\ndelicate birches, each slender twig bearing its feathery burden; and\r\nthere were spruces and hemlocks, regal in snowy splendor. It lay upon\r\nthem in heavy masses, and gave their bending boughs a still more\r\ngraceful dip. There was something which harmonized with my grief in the\r\nsilent snow and the drooping trees. They sank beneath the snow as the\r\nhuman heart sinks beneath its burden of sorrow. Yet it fell gently and\r\nbeautifully upon them, as affliction falls from the hand of our Father,\r\n'who chasteneth whom he loveth.' One tree, which bent completely over in\r\na perfect abandonment of grief, particularly impressed me. There was\r\nsomething in the sweep of the branches which suggested the utter\r\nprostration of the heart beneath the first shock of a great affliction.\r\n\r\nHow still it was! It was not dark, for the moon had risen, and the\r\nclouds were thin. The snow, too, made it lighter.\r\n\r\nIt was at this solemn, awe-inspiring hour that my companions first\r\nlearned the object of my journey. The sympathy with which they met me\r\ndid honor to human nature.\r\n\r\n'I thought,' said the Englishman, 'that the urgency of my own journey\r\nwas great, but it is nothing compared to yours.'\r\n\r\nHe apologized for any light or careless conversation in which they had\r\nindulged, not knowing the circumstances of my journey, and entered fully\r\ninto the sentiment which had prompted me to undertake it. He assured me\r\nthat he would see that I got through in time for the cars the next\r\nmorning, and begged me to feel no further uneasiness about it.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment, both my companions were more assiduously devoted to my\r\ncomfort than ever. Their interest was increased on finding that my\r\nfather was the son of a well-known inventor.\r\n\r\nHis history was soon told. He had inherited his father's business (now\r\npassed out of the family) with something of his mechanical talent. Of a\r\nconfiding disposition, he had been wronged by those whom he had\r\nintrusted most extensively, and, property gone and strength failing, his\r\nmisfortunes, which he had at all times borne with exemplary patience and\r\nfortitude, had culminated in the loss of his old home, the home of his\r\nfather before him, by the hand of the incendiary. He had left me a\r\nprecious legacy in his memory, to which my present journey was an\r\ninadequate tribute.\r\n\r\nThe hours wore on. It did not grow much darker, but oh, it was so still!\r\nYou could hear the stillness when the coach stopped, as occasionally it\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nIt was there, in the depths of this remote wilderness, that our subdued\r\nvoices mingled in those grand old chorals which belong to the church\r\nuniversal, and in which, Methodist, Presbyterian, and Unitarian as we\r\nwere, we could all heartily join: 'Old Hundred,' so full of worship;\r\n'Dundee,' with its plaintive melody; and 'America,' breathing the soul\r\nof loyalty, whether sung to 'God save the Queen,' or 'Our country, 'tis\r\nof thee.'\r\n\r\nMy voice was feeble, and soon gave out. I had come near fainting\r\nrepeatedly, and had only been resuscitated by the snow and the\r\nEnglishman's brandy. I was now nearly exhausted.\r\n\r\n'You had better make use of my shoulder as a pillow,' he said,\r\nperceiving my condition.\r\n\r\n'You had better, by all means,' chimed in the Scotchman.\r\n\r\nI hesitated a moment. What would Mrs. Grundy say--and my husband? I was\r\ntoo tired to care for the former, and the latter, I knew, would be only\r\ngrateful to my compassionate friends.\r\n\r\n'Circumstances must dispense with ceremony,' I observed, suiting the\r\naction to the word.\r\n\r\n'Madam,' rejoined the Englishman, with warmth, 'I hope you will find,\r\nbefore you get to the end of your journey, that you are in honorable\r\ncompany.'\r\n\r\n'I have found it out already,' I murmured, and then, committing myself\r\nto the care and keeping of the Good Father, my last shadow of distrust\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nI was too weary to hold my eyelids open, and too much excited to sleep.\r\nAt length I was aroused by a sudden stop. The 'whippletree' had broken.\r\nIn a few minutes we proceeded, the 'leader' being still driven loosely,\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nAgain we came to a pause--this time to water the horses at a wayside\r\nspring. While the others were refreshing themselves, the 'leader'\r\nquietly walked off, to the great indignation of the driver, who began to\r\nswear as he chased him through the snow. He was captured at last, and we\r\ncontinued on our way.\r\n\r\nThe poor Frenchman had by this time become so chilled that he was glad\r\nto come inside, though by so doing he felt obliged to give up the luxury\r\nof his pipe.\r\n\r\nAll at once the striking difference in our nationalities occurred to me,\r\nand I exclaimed, on the impulse of the moment:\r\n\r\n'See, do we not represent the four leading nations of the\r\nearth--England, France, Scotland, and America?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' replied the Englishman, with some hesitation in his manner;\r\n'England is surely one of the leading nations; so is France;'--(here the\r\nFrenchman broke in with some inarticulate jargon to the glory of\r\nFrance)--'but Scotland--I don't know about that being a 'leading\r\nnation.''\r\n\r\nThis roused the Scotchman. 'Scotland _has_ been a glorious nation! She\r\nhas proud memories for her sons!' he cried, with a fire of enthusiasm,\r\nnot without pathos, in its unavoidable admission that the glory of his\r\ncountry as an individual power in the world was past.\r\n\r\n'That is right,' said I, admiring his sudden warmth; 'cling to your own\r\ncountry before all others, come what may.'\r\n\r\nThe Englishman then reverted to the present lamentable condition of\r\nthese United States, and with characteristic complacency pointed to the\r\nstability and grandeur of his own Government.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that I spoke of the future of our country, and\r\nrepresented our present troubles to be, as I firmly believe, the means\r\nof our regeneration into a nobler and truer national existence. His\r\nEnglish prejudices were not to be shaken. England was, and would remain\r\n_the leading_ nation of the earth.\r\n\r\nHow much longer the discussion would have continued I know not, had we\r\nnot caught sight of lights, and driven up to a more pretentious mansion\r\nthan we had yet seen on our way.\r\n\r\nScarcely able to stand, I alighted, and the landlord, seeing the lady,\r\nushered us into the parlor, which showed signs of approaching\r\ncivilization in the large-figured Kiddermister carpet and the\r\n'air-tight' stove.\r\n\r\nA fine-looking young man, whom they called 'Doctor,' in a gray suit with\r\ndeep fur cuffs, sat at a table, looking over a volume of house plans\r\nwith a pretty young lady. Apparently the occupation had been of\r\nabsorbing interest, for the fire was nearly out, and the room was quite\r\ncold, and the look with which they greeted our entrance betokened\r\nsurprise rather than pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman made himself at home, and, not waiting to call a servant,\r\nprocured three or four sticks of wood from some unknown quarter, and\r\nbegan piling them into the stove. They burned feebly, for the fire was\r\nvery low indeed, and I still shivered; so, catching up the rocking\r\nchair, he ran off with it into the other room.\r\n\r\n'There's a good open fire out here,' said he; 'it doesn't look quite as\r\ntidy, perhaps, but I guess you'll get warm.'\r\n\r\nThat was the main thing, to be sure; so I followed on. Here the fire was\r\nnot so good as it might have been, but by dint of a little bluster, a\r\nquantity of 'light-stuff' and more solid fuel was soon forthcoming, and\r\nwe shortly had a blaze almost strong enough to set the chimney and my\r\ninevitable plank on fire. Here we wound our watches. After a little\r\ndelay supper was announced--fried beefsteaks, potatoes, and doughnuts.\r\n\r\nThis was the place where we were to exchange drivers, and where a delay\r\nof several hours frequently occurred.\r\n\r\nWhen we were about half through supper, which my travelling companions\r\ndiscussed with enviable zeal, a short, stoutly built, sharp-visaged man\r\nappeared in the doorway, and cried out, 'All ready!'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm not,' said the Englishman, looking up good-humoredly. With a\r\nmuttered threat about going on and leaving us, the new driver turned\r\naway, and we thought the prospect of getting to Bangor in time had\r\ndecidedly improved. Still, there were more than forty miles between.\r\n\r\n'I will take one of your doughnuts, madam,' said I, putting it into my\r\npocket, for I had been able to eat but little.\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' said the landlady; 'take as many as you wish.'\r\n\r\nThere was something in her kindly tone that did me good. It cheered and\r\nhelped me more than she could know.\r\n\r\nWe were to pay our passage here to the returning driver. I had secured a\r\n'through ticket' at C----, but my companions, having only English gold\r\nwith them, had not done so, having been assured by this same man that\r\nthey could just as well pay at Bangor, where they would obtain a higher\r\npremium on their money. Now, however, he demanded his pay, and at first\r\nwas not disposed to allow any premium for the gold. This, of course,\r\nexcited their indignation, and some high words passed. However, the\r\nmatter was compromised by the driver giving them twenty per cent., when\r\ngold was at that moment worth fifty at Bangor.\r\n\r\nI had stolen from the room, and was hastily putting on my numerous\r\nwrappings, when the Englishman came to me with what he called a 'dose,\r\nwhich he thought would do me good.'\r\n\r\nI took part of it, and then hesitated, for it contained strong\r\nreminiscences of the 'pocket pistol.'\r\n\r\n'Would you really advise me to take the rest?' said I gravely.\r\n\r\n'I certainly would,' he replied, with conclusive solemnity. So I took\r\nit, and I think it did 'do me good.'\r\n\r\n'This is a hard journey for you,' said the landlady, compassionately\r\nregarding my diminutive stature and frail aspect.\r\n\r\nThe driver was very impatient. She half apologized for him, saying, 'He\r\nis very anxious to get through to-night. He doesn't like to go through\r\nin the night always, for there are many dangerous places along the road;\r\nbut it is sleighing to-night, and not very dark, so he thinks he can do\r\nvery well.'\r\n\r\nThe urgency of my case, which the Englishman had represented to him,\r\nwith what other inducements I can only imagine, occasioned his unwonted\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\nWhen we entered the coach once more for the long night ride, one of the\r\nbuffaloes was missing.\r\n\r\n'It's over to the other stable,' said the driver, carelessly; 'twas left\r\nover there by mistake. You shall have it when we get there.'\r\n\r\nYou would have thought, from his manner of speaking, that the 'other\r\nstable' was just across the road, instead of being twenty miles away. As\r\nwe drove away, I observed, 'I have a doughnut in my pocket; the first\r\none hungry shall have it.'\r\n\r\nThe curtains were now buttoned closely down for the first time, and we\r\nwere in total darkness. We rode in silence for some time, each\r\nresolutely trying to go to sleep. The Frenchman succeeded best. He had\r\nserved as a soldier on the Continent, and was evidently accustomed to\r\nhardship. He slept as soundly as though he were on a down bed, instead\r\nof riding backward in a stage coach.\r\n\r\nAgain insensibility threatened me. I could not speak, but my labored\r\nbreathing aroused my companions just in time to save me from entire\r\nunconsciousness. The faithful Scotchman had raised the curtain, and the\r\nair rushed in freshly upon me. It was very chilly, and much colder than\r\nit had been. It had ceased snowing, and the moon was shining feebly\r\nthrough the breaking clouds. We were going at a goodly rate of speed. By\r\nand by I thought of my doughnut, and inquired who was hungry. The\r\nScotchman was not; the Englishman was not; the Frenchman still slept.\r\n\r\n'Give it to me, if you please,' said the Englishman, a sudden idea\r\nseeming to strike him.\r\n\r\n'Here,' said he, making a thrust at the Frenchman; 'wake up! here's a\r\ndoughnut for you.' The old soldier muttered something drowsily. He was\r\nnot hungry. 'Won't you take it for the lady?' said the former, with a\r\ndash of sentiment.\r\n\r\n'I only eat for the satisfacti-on of mine appétit!' he exclaimed,\r\nsulkily, settling himself back again to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe night wore on, interrupted only by frequent stoppages, when the\r\ndriver dismounted to apply the 'drags' in going down the hills. Before\r\nthis, we had seemed to be going up all the hills; now there seemed to be\r\na continual descent.\r\n\r\nI was too weary to sleep. Let me change my position as I might, I could\r\nnot be comfortable. My mind was constantly busy, and, since outward\r\nobjects could no longer engage my attention, I could no longer escape my\r\nthoughts. At one time I would think of my husband and my five little\r\nones at home, all sleeping quietly in their beds. I wondered if they had\r\nall said their prayers to their father, and if he had tucked them all up\r\nwarmly. Then I would think of my mother. Was she expecting me? I\r\nwondered. My poor mother! what a sad meeting that would be! And then my\r\ndead father would come to mind. How sad, how strange it would seem, to\r\nreceive no warm greeting from him!\r\n\r\nIt was about two o'clock in the morning, when we stopped for our last\r\nchange of horses. The house stood black and sombre as a tomb in the dim\r\nmoonlight. The family had evidently retired to rest. At length we were\r\nadmitted into a dimly lighted room, where a table was spread with\r\nsubstantial food. The old gentleman, whose slumbers we had so ruthlessly\r\ndisturbed, fumbled among a pile of letters and papers, which he\r\ndistributed in three monstrous mailbags, that flapped about on the floor\r\nlike so many whales out of water. His toilet had evidently been hastily\r\nmade, and he shuffled the letters and papers about with the manner of a\r\nperson half asleep. His hair, which was white and very abundant, stood\r\nerect all over his head, and contrasted queerly with his nut-brown face,\r\nwhich was strongly marked and deeply wrinkled.\r\n\r\nWe were all sleepy and stupid enough by this time, and, had the\r\nScotchman been a less chivalrous knight than he had proved himself, I\r\ndoubt not he would have experienced some satisfaction in placing my\r\nplank and brick before the fire to heat for the last time.\r\n\r\nWe were none of us hungry but the sharp-visaged driver, who devoured his\r\nsupper, or breakfast, whichever it might be called, with the air of a\r\nman who was determined to get through to Bangor before morning.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman, who had been completely cowed down by the old gentleman's\r\nindignant 'No, _sir!_ we don't keep no sich stuff abaout these\r\npremises!' in reply to his demand for 'rum,' meekly took refuge in a cup\r\nof coffee.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time a baby in the adjoining room, awakened by our\r\nmovements, began to cry. It was quite a young cry. It could not be more\r\nthan three or four months old, I thought, as I compared it mentally with\r\nthe efforts of my own youngest in that direction. But the baby shoe\r\nwhich hung by the fireplace betokened an older child. It must have been\r\nthe old gentleman's grandchild. I pitied its mother, for it might lie\r\nawake until morning.\r\n\r\nOnce more our resolute driver, with an authoritative 'All ready!'\r\nsummoned us to depart.\r\n\r\n'Amaziah, bring the light around here!' cried the Englishman, who seemed\r\nto know the names of every one at these stopping places by a sort of\r\nintuition.\r\n\r\n'Amaziah' promptly obeyed, and by the aid of his lantern I settled\r\nmyself for the last stage of my journey. To the Scotchman's comfort, the\r\nmissing buffalo was produced here, according to the driver's promise.\r\n\r\nThe Frenchman, who had been over the 'line' before, had hinted that four\r\ngray horses were to take us into Bangor; but it seemed to be the fate of\r\nthree only.\r\n\r\nIt was then not far from three o'clock, and we had more than twenty\r\nmiles before us. As the distance lessened, my excitement increased. I\r\nbecame so feverish that I could no longer bear my mittens on my hands.\r\nAnxiety and fatigue produced a nervous exhaustion, and the harsh grating\r\nof the 'drags' as we descended the oft-recurring hills, threw me into an\r\nuncontrollable tremor. I was too tired to sleep--too tired, almost, to\r\nthink. Strength, sense, hope seemed to lose themselves in my utter\r\nweariness. It seemed at times to become a question whether I should even\r\nlive to reach my destination.\r\n\r\nMy companions cheered and comforted me as best they could, with\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten kindness. We stopped once to throw out a mailbag,\r\nand I thought, from the appearance of the place as well as I could see\r\nit, that we were already on the outskirts of Bangor.\r\n\r\n'What place is this?' the Englishman inquired.\r\n\r\n'Eddington Bend,' replied the driver.\r\n\r\n'How far from Bangor?'\r\n\r\n'Sixteen miles.'\r\n\r\nToward dawn we all lost ourselves for a few minutes. I first aroused,\r\nand, through the interstices beside the curtains, perceived the gray\r\nlight of morning. It was six o'clock, and we were but four miles from\r\nBangor, the driver informed us.\r\n\r\nOnly four miles! but how long they seemed! The cars left at half past\r\nseven o'clock, and the daylight was fast advancing.\r\n\r\n'Shall we after all get there in time?' said I.\r\n\r\n'Not in time for breakfast, I imagine,' replied the Englishman,\r\nresignedly.\r\n\r\nAt last came the welcome announcement, 'Bangor! There is Bangor!'\r\n\r\n'Where is it? I do not see it,' said I, looking eagerly out into the\r\ngray morning mist.\r\n\r\n'Why, there, to be sure! Don't you see that steeple? There's another!\r\nand there's another!'\r\n\r\nYes, surely there was Bangor at last, welcome to me as ever the Holy\r\nCity to the penance-worn pilgrim.\r\n\r\nIn my gratitude, I overflowed with benignity to all the world, and even\r\ngranted the poor Frenchman permission to enjoy his pipe, a privilege of\r\nwhich he made haste to avail himself. It was an ill-timed charity, to be\r\nsure, but I could well afford to submit to the temporary discomfort in\r\nthe fulness of my satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe driver hastened the horses. With ever-increasing speed we passed the\r\nlowly cottages in the suburbs, where people were getting up and\r\npreparing breakfast by candle light, and at last the 'three grays'\r\ncantered triumphantly to the ---- Hotel--in time for breakfast, too!\r\n\r\nThere was not a moment to spare, however, and so, without waiting even\r\nto make my toilet, we hurried to the train.\r\n\r\nThe relief I experienced when fairly seated in the car, the excitement\r\nof finding myself in the world once more, among bustling, wide-awake\r\npeople, stimulated me, and for some time I was unconscious of my\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman was to leave me at a station a few miles beyond Bangor,\r\nas his journey lay in a different direction. We exchanged cards, and I\r\ncould not help saying, as we parted:\r\n\r\n'I met you a stranger, but I have found in you a friend and a\r\nbrother.'[A]\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman continued on to Boston with me.\r\n\r\nHis chivalrous and thoughtful consideration remained undiminished.\r\n\r\nAt last, after many intervals of lassitude and reanimation, I broke down\r\naltogether. My strength left me. Over-powered with grief and fatigue, I\r\nwas glad to rest my weary head on my old plaid cloak, which the\r\nScotchman rolled into a pillow for me in the saloon of the car, where I\r\nlay for the last six hours until we reached Boston.\r\n\r\nKind friends were there to meet me, and the Scotchman gave me into their\r\ncharge, a poor, exhausted creature.\r\n\r\nBut I was in _time_--and that was enough.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] The accomplished author of 'Intuitive Morals,' in an article in\r\n_Fraser's Magazine_, entitled 'A Day at the Dead Sea,' takes occasion to\r\nrender a high tribute to the courtesy of our countrymen. She writes:\r\n\r\n     'If at any time I needed to find a gentleman who should aid me\r\n     in any little difficulties of travel, or show me a kindness,\r\n     with that consideration for a woman, _as a woman_, which is the\r\n     true tone of manly courtesy, then I should desire to find a\r\n     North American gentleman.... They are simply the most kind and\r\n     courteous of any people.'\r\n\r\nIt is with heartfelt pleasure that I return this compliment, in this\r\naccount of my winter journey, which, but for the constant and delicate\r\nkindness of her countrymen, would have proved wellnigh insupportable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARY OF FRANCES KRASINSKA;\r\n\r\nOR, LIFE IN POLAND DURING THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January 3d._\r\n\r\nYesterday, amid the drinking of toasts, the peals of joyous music, and\r\nthe volleys of musketry from our dragoons in honor of the investiture of\r\nthe Duke of Courland, the chamberlain despatched to Warsaw returned,\r\nwith letters announcing that the ceremony had been delayed, on account\r\nof the king's illness: it has been postponed until the eighth of\r\nJanuary. Our little Matthias says it is a bad omen, and that as the\r\nducal crown eludes his grasp, so will a royal one. I felt quite\r\nuneasy,... but then there came several visitors, and they distracted my\r\nthoughts. After dinner came Madame Dembinska, wife of the king's\r\ncupbearer, with her sons and daughters; the pantler Jordan, with his\r\nwife and son, and M. Swidinski, Palatine of Braclaw, with his nephew,\r\nthe Abbé Vincent. The latter gentleman has been several times at\r\nMaleszow; he is a very pious man; my parents love and esteem him very\r\nmuch. Although he is quite young, we kiss his hands as a minister of\r\nGod. Barbara has completely won his good opinion; he has given her a\r\nrosary, and the 'Christian's Daily Manual.' He was seated next to her at\r\nsupper, and even addressed his conversation to her twice. This is not at\r\nall astonishing, for Barbara is so good; besides, she is the eldest, and\r\nhence entitled to more politeness than the rest of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friday, January 5th._\r\n\r\nThe palatine and his nephew are still with us, and we are daily\r\nexpecting other guests. The eldest of the palatine's sons is Starost of\r\nRadom, and the younger is a colonel in the king's army. The palatine,\r\nwho has been a widower several years, has also two daughters, one\r\nmarried to Granowski, Palatine of Rawa, and the other recently wedded to\r\nLauckorouski, Castellan of Polaniec. I am very curious to see the\r\npalatine's sons; they were educated at Luneville, in France; they must\r\nhave an air and manner different from those of our young Poles.\r\n\r\nThe good King Stanislaus, though he dwells in a foreign land, is always\r\nseeking to be useful to his compatriots; several young Polish gentlemen\r\nare maintained and educated by him at Luneville. They receive the best\r\ninstruction, and the sons of our first families strive for the honor,\r\nusing the pretext of relationship, however distant, to obtain their\r\ndesires. Indeed, they are quite right, for when one can say of a young\r\nman, He has studied at Luneville, and has been to Paris, he has\r\ncertainly an excellent foundation for the beginning of his career. Every\r\none feels quite sure that his manners will be irreproachable, that he\r\ncan speak French, and dance the minuet and quadrilles. All the gentlemen\r\nwho have been in France are very successful in society, and very\r\npleasing to ladies.... Really, I am exceedingly curious to see the\r\npalatine's two sons!\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday, _January 6th._\r\n\r\nThey finally arrived yesterday afternoon, and do not in the least\r\ncorrespond to the idea I had formed of them, the starost less than his\r\nbrother. I thought I should see a young, lively, and agreeable man, in\r\nshort, a young man like Prince Cherry, in Madame de Beaumont's tales,\r\nwho would speak French all the time; but I was quite mistaken. The\r\nstarost is no longer young; he is thirty years old, and quite stout; he\r\nis not fond of dancing, and never speaks a single word of French. Every\r\nnow and then he puts in a word or two of Latin, like my father. I am\r\nmuch better pleased with the colonel; he wears a uniform, is young, and\r\nsays at least a few words in French.\r\n\r\nTo-day is Twelfth day, and Michael Chronowski will be emancipated before\r\nnightfall. They are baking a great cake in the kitchen, with a bean in\r\nit. Who will be king? Heavens, if I were to be queen! I should wear a\r\ncrown on my head during the whole evening, and should bear absolute sway\r\nin the castle.... There would be plenty of dancing then, I'll answer for\r\nit!... But whether I command it or not, there must be dancing, I am\r\nsure, for a crowd of visitors has been pouring in ever since morning;\r\nthe servants are grumbling, and the keeper of the table service is quite\r\nprovoked. When he sees all the carriages standing on the square facing\r\nthe church of Piotrkowicé, he says there is no end to work for him. As\r\nfor me, I jump with joy; and so it is in this world, where some are\r\nhappy from the very cause which makes the torment of others.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, _January 7th_.\r\n\r\nHow many people! The castle is so gay and lively! We amused ourselves\r\nfinely. I was not queen, for Barbara got the bean, and when she saw it\r\nin her portion of the cake, she blushed to her very eyes. Madame, who\r\nwas seated near her, announced the fact, and all the guests and\r\nattendants testified their satisfaction by loud shouts. Our little\r\nMatthias laughed and said: She who has the bean will marry Mr. Michael\r\n(kto dostal migdala dostanie Michala) a Polish proverb always repeated\r\nupon such occasions. It is also a common saying that when a young girl\r\nhas it, she will be married before the end of the carnival. God grant\r\nthat this prophecy may be verified, for then we shall have a wedding,\r\nand abundance of dancing!\r\n\r\nI cannot become accustomed to the starost; his gravity does not please\r\nme; he would dance nothing yesterday but Polish dances. He never\r\nmentions Paris or Luneville, and takes no notice of young people; he\r\nnever addresses to us any of those little gallantries which are the\r\nsmall change of good society; he talks only to our parents, plays cards,\r\nand reads the newspapers. I still continue to think that his brother is\r\nworth more than he; at least he is more sociable, he talks about Paris\r\nand Luneville, and is not so old.\r\n\r\nBut I am forgetting to relate the ceremonies accompanying Michael\r\nChronowski's emancipation; I was quite diverted with them. When all the\r\ncompany had assembled in the great hall, my father took his place upon\r\nthe highest seat; the folding doors were thrown open, and the steward,\r\naccompanied by several young courtiers, introduced the candidate for\r\nemancipation, very richly dressed in a full suit of new clothes. He\r\nknelt before my father, who touched his cheek lightly in sign of good\r\nwill; he then fastened a sword at the young man's side, drank off a cup\r\nof wine, and presented him with a fine horse, accompanied by a groom,\r\nalso well mounted and equipped. The two horses were in the castle court.\r\n\r\nMy father asked Chronowski if he preferred trying his fortune in the\r\nworld or remaining in his service. Michael replied, timidly, that he was\r\nvery happy in the castle, but would like to see more of his country, and\r\nventured to ask a recommendation to Prince Lubomirski, Palatine of\r\nLublin, my father's brother-in-law. His request was granted, my father\r\nslipped a roll of twenty gold ducats into his hand, and invited him to\r\nremain with us during the carnival. Chronowski seemed delighted with\r\nthis proposition, and after paying his homage to my father and mother,\r\nhe kissed the hands of all the ladies present; from that moment he was\r\nadmitted into our society, and danced his best in Mazurkas and\r\nCracroviennes with Barbara. He certainly dances very well, and my sister\r\nis equally graceful; it was charming to see them!\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday, _January 8th._\r\n\r\nThe prophecy has been really fulfilled! Barbara is to be married at the\r\ntermination of the carnival, and she is to marry Mr. Michael, for such\r\nis the name of the Starost Swidzinski. He asked Barbara's hand of my\r\nmother yesterday, and to-morrow they will be betrothed! Poor Barbara was\r\nall in tears when she came to tell us the great news; she shrinks from\r\nthe idea of marriage, and it will be very painful to her to leave her\r\nparents and her home. But it would have been very unadvisable to have\r\nrefused the match, when my father and mother assure her that she will be\r\nvery happy. The starost seems to me a very pious, gentle, and upright\r\nman; his family is noble, ancient, and wealthy. What more is necessary?\r\n\r\nThe three brothers Swidzinski, Alexander, Michael, and Anthony, died as\r\nbrave men should, near Chocim, under the command of the celebrated\r\nChodkiewicz. This renown is a glory for those who still live. The\r\nstarost's parents have already conferred upon him the entire ownership\r\nof the castle of Sulgostow. He holds, besides, a considerable starosty\r\nunder the king's appointment, and expects soon to be a castellan. The\r\nPalatine Swidzinski and the Abbé Vincent have come to speed on the\r\nmarriage; they desire it exceedingly. The palatine is charmed with\r\nBarbara, and I am sure he will love her dearly when he knows her better.\r\nThe wedding will take place at the castle of Maleszow on the 25th of\r\nFebruary. What fine balls and concerts we shall have! We will dance\r\nuntil we can scarcely stand. Barbara will be: Your ladyship the\r\nstarostine. I shall be very sorry when I can no longer call her Barbara,\r\ndear Barbara.\r\n\r\nI really feel quite remorseful at having described the starost so ill in\r\nmy journal; however, I do not think I have said anything very offensive.\r\nI hope Barbara may be happy, and I think she will be, for she has always\r\ntold me she did not like very young people; the starost is reasonable,\r\nand in my mother's opinion such men make the best husbands. If my mother\r\nsays so, it must be true; but for my part, I much prefer gay and\r\nagreeable young men. One is certainly entitled to one's own individual\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nI have not forgotten that this is the day selected for the investiture\r\nof the prince royal with the dukedom of Courland. The king's health is\r\nreëstablished. Colonel Swidzinski speaks in the highest terms of Prince\r\nCharles, whom he knows very well; but the palatine and his eldest son do\r\nnot wish him to succeed his father; they say that the crown should be\r\nplaced upon the head of a compatriot.\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday, _January 10th._\r\n\r\nThe betrothal took place yesterday. Dinner was served at the usual hour.\r\nWhen Barbara entered the saloon my mother gave her a ball of silk to\r\nuntwist; she was red as fire, and her eyes were fixed on the ground. The\r\nstarost did not leave her a moment. Our little Matthias laughed with his\r\nmalicious air, and gave vent to a thousand pleasantries, which diverted\r\nevery one exceedingly; all laughed aloud, and although I did not\r\nunderstand the meaning of his jests, I laughed more than any one else.\r\nAfter dinner, Barbara seated herself in the recess by the window; the\r\nstarost approached her, and said, aloud:\r\n\r\n'Is it indeed true, mademoiselle, that you will oppose no obstacles to\r\nmy happiness?'\r\n\r\nBarbara replied, in a low and trembling voice:\r\n\r\n'My parents' will has always been for me a sacred duty.'\r\n\r\nHere the conversation ended.\r\n\r\nWhen the chamberlains, attendants, and servants had retired, the\r\npalatine, followed by the Abbé Vincent, conducted the starost to my\r\nparents, who were seated on a sofa. The palatine addressed my father in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n     'My heart is penetrated with the sincerest affection and most\r\n     profound esteem for the illustrious house of the Corvini\r\n     Krasinski; I have always ardently desired that the modest arms\r\n     of Polkozie might be united with the glorious and illustrious\r\n     arms of Slepowron. My happiness is at its height on beholding\r\n     that your highnesses will deign to grant me this great honor.\r\n     Your daughter Barbara is a model of virtue and grace; my son\r\n     Michael is the glory and consolation of my life; deign, then,\r\n     to consent to the union of this young couple; deign to confirm\r\n     your promise on this very day. Behold the ring which I received\r\n     from my parents: I placed it upon the hand of my betrothed, who\r\n     is, alas! now no more, but who will live eternally in my heart.\r\n     Permit, then, that during a similar ceremony my son may offer\r\n     it to your daughter, as a token of his affection and\r\n     unalterable attachment.'\r\n\r\nAs he said these words, he placed the ring upon a silver dish held by\r\nthe Abbé Vincent. The abbé also made a discourse, but he put so much\r\nLatin into it that I could not understand it.\r\n\r\nMy father replied to the two speeches in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     'I am most happy to confirm the promise I have made to you; I\r\n     consent to the marriage of my daughter with the starost; I give\r\n     her my blessing, and surrender to your honorable son all the\r\n     rights I possess over her.'\r\n\r\n     'I unite in the desires and intentions of my husband,' added my\r\n     mother. 'I give this ring to my daughter; it is the most\r\n     precious jewel of our house. My father, Stephen Humiecki,\r\n     received it from the hand of Augustus II, when he had\r\n     fortunately succeeded in concluding the peace of Carlowitz, by\r\n     which the Turks restored the fortress of Kamieniec-Podolski to\r\n     the Poles. With this ring, which recalls so many dear\r\n     remembrances, was I myself betrothed; I give it to my eldest\r\n     daughter, with my blessing, and the hope that she may be as\r\n     happy as I have been since my marriage.'\r\n\r\nThus saying, she placed on the dish a ring set with superb diamonds,\r\nenclosing a miniature of Augustus II.\r\n\r\n'Barbara, come to me,' said my father; but the poor child was so\r\nconfused, so agitated and trembling, that she could scarcely walk; I\r\ncannot understand how she moved even those few paces. At last, however,\r\nshe placed herself at my father's side, and the Abbé Vincent gave them\r\nhis benediction in Latin. One of the rings was given to the starost, and\r\nthe other to my sister; her betrothed placed it upon the little finger\r\nof her left hand, called the heart finger (serdeczny). He then kissed\r\nBarbara's hand, and she in her turn presented her ring; but she was so\r\nmuch overcome that she found great difficulty in encircling the end of\r\nhis finger with the glittering hoop. The starost again kissed her hand,\r\nafter which he threw himself at my parents' feet, and swore to watch\r\nover the happiness of their beloved daughter.\r\n\r\nThe palatine kissed Barbara on the forehead, while the colonel and the\r\nabbé made her a thousand compliments, each more beautiful than the last.\r\nMy father filled a great goblet with old Hungarian wine; he toasted the\r\nnew couple, and all who were present drank by turns out of the same cup.\r\n\r\nAll this passed so solemnly and tenderly that I wept unrestrainedly.\r\n\r\n'Do not weep, little Frances,' said Matthias, who was present at this\r\nscene; 'a year hence it will be your turn.'\r\n\r\nA year would be too soon; but if it were in two years, I would not be\r\nsorry.\r\n\r\nThe whole Swidzinski family are so kind and attentive to Barbara! and my\r\nparents for the first time kissed her face when she bade them good\r\nnight. Since yesterday, every one in the castle treats her with the\r\ngreatest respect; all congratulate her, and she is overwhelmed with\r\nhomage and compliments. Each one would like to be employed in her\r\nestablishment; my father has given 1,000 Holland ducats to my mother,\r\nrecommending her to do all for her daughter that she may think\r\nnecessary. They consulted a long time over the trousseau that should be\r\ngiven to her. To-morrow Miss Zawistowska will go to Warsaw with the\r\ncommissary, to make purchases. This Miss Zawistowska is a very\r\nrespectable person; she is about thirty, and has lived in the castle\r\never since she was a child. There are in the storeroom four large chests\r\nfilled with silver, destined for our use. My father had Barbara's\r\nbrought to him and examined it carefully; this chest will be sent to\r\nWarsaw, that the silver may be cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe palatine and the starost leave us to-morrow. They go to Sulgostow,\r\nwhere they will make all the preparations necessary for Barbara's\r\nreception.\r\n\r\nMy father has had the customary letters written to announce the\r\nmarriage, and will send them by the chamberlains to the various parts of\r\nPoland. The most distinguished among our chamberlains, and an equerry\r\nrichly equipped, will depart in two days to carry letters to the king,\r\nthe princes his sons, the primate, and the principal senators. My father\r\nannounces the marriage, and begs them to give it their benediction; if\r\nhe does not exactly invite them, he gives them to understand that he\r\nwould feel highly honored by their presence. Ah! if one of the princes\r\nwere to come--the Duke of Courland, for example--what a lustre it would\r\nthrow upon the wedding! But they will merely send their representatives,\r\nas is usual upon such occasions.\r\n\r\nThe castle is in a state of constant activity; great preparations are\r\nmaking for the approaching festivities. The starost has displayed an\r\nunexampled generosity; he has made us all the most beautiful presents.\r\nHe has given me a turquoise pin; Sophia has received a ruby cross; Mary,\r\na Venetian chain, and even my parents have condescended to accept gifts\r\nfrom him. My father has a silver-gilt goblet, admirably chased; and my\r\nmother, a beautiful box made of mother-of-pearl mounted in gold. Even\r\nmadame has not been forgotten, for she found a blonde mantle on her bed\r\nthis morning; she praises the generosity of the Polish lords to the\r\nskies. But this is the only virtue she concedes to our nation, so that I\r\ncannot love madame; her injustice toward my countrymen repels me. We had\r\nyesterday a grand state supper; the orchestra played unceasingly, toasts\r\nwere drunk in honor of the happy couple, and the dragoons fired\r\nnumberless volleys of musketry; their captain gave them as their\r\nwatchword for the day, 'Michael and Barbara.'\r\n\r\nBarbara begins to take courage; she only blushes now when she looks at\r\nher ring; she hides it as much as she can; but it is of no use, for\r\nevery one sees it, and the brilliants sparkle like stars.\r\n\r\nThis morning all the court went hunting, in accordance with the old\r\ncustom, which renders this action of good omen to the wedded pair.\r\nFormerly before they set out, the betrothed was obliged to display her\r\nankle to the hunters. God be praised that this custom no longer exists,\r\nfor I am sure Barbara would have died of shame. But our little Matthias\r\ninsisted upon the performance of this ceremony, saying that if it were\r\nomitted the chase would certainly be unfortunate. For once his prophecy\r\nfailed; they killed a wild boar, two bucks, an elk, and many hares. The\r\nstarost killed the wild boar with his own hand, and laid it at Barbara's\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nMy father had all the horses brought out of his stables for the hunters\r\nto ride upon. Among them was one of exceeding beauty, but so\r\nunmanageable that the best groom had never yet been able to mount him.\r\nThe starost was confident he could control him, and, notwithstanding\r\nthe terror of the spectators, he leaped on his back and guided him three\r\ntimes round the castle of Maleszow. It was truly a noble sight. Barbara\r\nwas very pale; she trembled for her betrothed; but when she saw him so\r\nfirmly seated on the fiery animal, the bright color returned to her\r\ncheek. From that moment I felt reconciled to the starost. In truth, he\r\nis not so bad; he looks well on horseback, and possesses that dauntless\r\ncourage so dear to the heart of a woman. I must then forgive his\r\nignorance of the minuet and quadrilles. My father gave the starost the\r\nhorse he had so well merited, completely caparisoned, and with a groom\r\nto take care of him.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, _January 20th._\r\n\r\nI have neglected my journal during the past week; we have been so busy\r\nwith the preparations for the marriage; there are such crowds of people\r\nat the castle; every one is occupied doing the honors; both mornings and\r\nafternoons are passed in company. Our studies are laid aside--the\r\nchronology, the French grammar, and even Madame de Beaumont lie quiet\r\nand undisturbed in their places. We are busily engaged with our needles,\r\nbecause each one of us desires to make a present to Barbara. I am\r\nembroidering a morning dress, which will be charming; I even steal some\r\nhours from my sleep that I may the sooner finish it. Mary is\r\nembroidering a straw-colored muslin, with shaded silks mingled with gold\r\nthread, and Sophia is making a lovely toilet cover.\r\n\r\nMy mother is entirely occupied with the trousseau; she opens her\r\nwardrobes and chests, bringing out linen, cloth, furs, curtains, and\r\ntapestry. I help her as well as I can; she is sometimes good enough to\r\nask my opinion; she is so scrupulous, so much afraid of not dividing our\r\nshares equally. She is so particular, that she even sends for the\r\nchaplain to judge of the exactness of the division. The tailors and\r\nlace-makers who have come from Warsaw to make up the trousseau will\r\nhardly be able to finish their work during the next month. The linen is\r\nall ready. The young ladies belonging to our suite have aided\r\nmaterially. They have been sewing at linen during the past two years,\r\nand now they are marking it with blue cotton. These poor girls will soon\r\nbe very expert in making the letters B and K. The trousseau will be\r\nmagnificent.\r\n\r\nBarbara cannot conceive what she will ever be able to do with so many\r\ndresses! Until now none of us have ever had more than four at a time:\r\ntwo brown woollen ones, with black aprons, for every-day wear, a white\r\none for Sundays, and a more elegant one for grand occasions,\r\nceremonials, etc. We always found them quite enough, but my mother says\r\nthat her ladyship the starostine will need an entirely different\r\ntoilette from that required by Miss Barbara; that what was proper for a\r\nyoung girl will not be sufficient for a married woman.\r\n\r\nI spoke of a ball of silk given to Barbara by my mother on the day of\r\nthe betrothal; well, that was to make a purse for the starost. Barbara\r\nworks at her purse from morning till night: the tangled silk was given\r\nher as a trial of her care and patience; for she must first wind the\r\nskeins without breaking them or dimming their lustre. She has succeeded\r\nadmirably. Barbara may marry without doubt or fear; our little Matthias\r\nanswers for her vocation.\r\n\r\nThe chamberlains and the equerry have departed with their letters of\r\nannouncement. Barbara is terrified at the thought that the princes and\r\nlords of the court may perhaps come from Warsaw. What a child she is! As\r\nfor me, I should be delighted! But I just remember--the investiture of\r\nthe prince royal took place on the eighth of this month. The evening\r\nbefore the ceremony, our cousin, Prince Lubomirska, Palatine of Lublin\r\nand the prince royal's marshal, gave a magnificent ball. The dinners,\r\nballs, and concerts are said to have lasted more than a week. The new\r\nDuke of Courland made a speech in Polish, which produced an excellent\r\neffect. He is now regarded as an independent prince, and has shown both\r\ndignity and greatness of mind throughout this whole affair.\r\n\r\nThe _Polish Courier_ gave all the details of the ceremony. If I had had\r\ntime I should have copied them, they interested me so deeply! But all\r\nthese details are nothing to what I should have seen with my own eyes\r\nhad I been there. What is description compared with one's own\r\nobservation? I am really very glad of the final investiture of the\r\nprince; it is the only public matter which pleases and consoles me; all\r\nelse seems to be in a most lamentable condition. While I am so\r\ndiligently working at Barbara's morning dress I am forced to hear things\r\nwhich sadden me deeply. The chaplain reads the papers aloud to us, and I\r\nsee that the republic loses daily in power and dignity; the neighboring\r\npowers invade it under divers pretexts; their troops pillage and\r\ndevastate the country, while the Government refuses to interfere.... I\r\ndare not think of the future, but my father says we must enjoy the\r\npresent. All speak in subdued tones of the woes which threaten Poland,\r\nand then dance and drink; the joyous festivals and banquets would\r\ndeceive one into thinking the times must be prosperous. The Poles,\r\nperhaps, act like our little Matthias; when he is vexed he never lets\r\nthe glass leave his hands, repeating always: He who pines, needs good\r\nwines (dobry trunek na frasunek); the sadder he is, the more he drinks.\r\n\r\n\r\nFriday, _January 25th, 1759._\r\n\r\nThe starost arrived yesterday, and Barbara found on her table this\r\nmorning two beautiful silver baskets filled with oranges and bonbons;\r\nshe distributed them among us (her sisters) and the young ladies of the\r\ncourt; even the waiting women received their share. Our work is\r\nprogressing; my morning dress is nearly finished.\r\n\r\nMy mother gives Barbara a bedstead with all its furniture. We have long\r\nhad our flocks of geese and swans. There is a poor creature in the\r\ncastle who can do nothing but pick down; poor Marina is so stupid that\r\nshe is incapable of comprehending anything more difficult, and passes\r\nher whole life in this occupation. Each of us has her share of the down;\r\nBarbara will have two large feather beds, eight large pillows of goose\r\ndown, and two small ones of swans' down. The pillows are made of stuff\r\nspun in the castle, and are to be covered with crimson damask, besides\r\nwhich they will have an upper case of Holland cambric, trimmed with\r\nlace. The young ladies of our suite have put a great deal of work upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday, _February 2d._\r\n\r\nThe starost remained a week at the castle, and left us yesterday. When\r\nhe again returns, it will be to carry Barbara away with him. I cannot\r\nimagine her going off alone with a stranger, it is truly inconceivable;\r\nI must see it with my own eyes before I can believe it.\r\n\r\nBarbara seems to feel daily more and more esteem and friendship toward\r\nthe starost. He, however, rarely addresses her; all his conversation is\r\ndirected to our parents--his cares and attentions are exclusively for\r\nthem. I am told that this is the proper way for a well-bred man to make\r\nhis court, and that he should win the heart of his betrothed by pleasing\r\nher family.\r\n\r\nIn three weeks the wedding will take place. My sisters and I have each a\r\nnew dress, presented to us by Barbara; she has given a dress to all the\r\nyoung girls in the castle.\r\n\r\nNearly all the persons invited to the wedding have accepted; but the\r\nking and the princes, to my great regret, will merely send their\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether the palatiness, Princess Lubomirska, can come; she will\r\nfind difficulty in leaving Warsaw at the present time. She approves\r\nhighly of Barbara's marriage, and has written her a charming letter of\r\ncongratulation; my father is delighted.\r\n\r\nMy morning dress will be finished in time; but then I have worked\r\nunceasingly, that is, as much as I could; for my mother is constantly\r\ncalling upon me; she is so kind to me, and condescends to make use of my\r\nservices in all her preparations. Until now, Barbara alone was consulted\r\nand had confidence placed in her, as being the eldest; this happiness\r\nwas her right, but my good parents desire that I should now take her\r\nplace. I have already been twice intrusted with the key of the little\r\nroom where the cordials and sweet-meats are kept; that gives me\r\nimportance. I have consequently assumed a graver air; every one must see\r\nthat I have grown a year older. I will try to imitate Barbara, so that\r\nwhen the starost takes her away my parents may not feel her loss too\r\ndeeply. I have plenty of good will, but shall I be able to satisfy them?\r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday, _February 12th._\r\n\r\nIt seems that the splendor and magnificence displayed at the investiture\r\nhad never before been equalled. The Warsaw gazettes are never weary of\r\ndilating upon this subject.\r\n\r\nThe guests begin to arrive; people are pouring in from the most distant\r\nquarters. Notwithstanding the number and size of the apartments, it will\r\nbe impossible to lodge all in the castle; preparations have been made in\r\nthe village, in the priest's house, and even in the better class of huts\r\nbelonging to the peasants, to receive some of our guests.\r\n\r\nThe cooks and confectioners are all busy; the laundry is in a state of\r\nunceasing activity; the trousseau is nearly finished; and the bedsteads,\r\ntwo cases filled with mattresses, pillows, and carpets, a box of silver,\r\nand a thousand other things, were sent off to Sulgostow this morning.\r\nThe bedsteads are of iron and beautifully wrought; the curtains are of\r\nblue damask, and fastened to the four corners by bunches of ostrich\r\nplumes.\r\n\r\nBarbara ought to kiss both the feet and the hands of our parents, who\r\nhave given her so many precious things. My father has inscribed an exact\r\nlist of the trousseau in a large book, preceded by the words which I\r\nhere copy, lest I should forget them:\r\n\r\n     'List of the trousseau which I, Stanislaus, of the Corvini\r\n     Krasinski, etc., etc., and my wife Angelica Humiecka, give to\r\n     our dear and well beloved daughter Barbara, on the occasion of\r\n     her marriage with His Excellency, Michael Swidinski, Starost of\r\n     Radom. We implore the blessing of Heaven upon our dear child,\r\n     and we bless her with parental affection in the name of the\r\n     Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.'\r\n\r\nI do not copy the list of the trousseau, for I have no time; I shall,\r\nbesides, be one day obliged to do it upon my own account.\r\n\r\n\r\nWednesday, _February 20th._\r\n\r\nWell! time flies, and the wedding will take place in five days. The\r\nstarost arrived yesterday evening. Barbara trembled like a leaf in an\r\nautumn wind when he was announced by the chamberlain. We expect to-day\r\nthe palatine, the colonel, the Abbé Vincent, and the Palatine Granowski,\r\nwith the palatiness, the starost's sister. Madame Lanckoronska, the\r\nstarost's second sister, cannot come to Maleszow; she is in Podolia with\r\nher husband. Barbara is really sorry, for she is very anxious to know\r\nher, every one speaks so highly of her. My sister is about entering into\r\na good family; all the persons composing it are pious and honorable;\r\nthey show her the most unbounded attention, and pay her homage as if she\r\nwere a queen.\r\n\r\nThe trousseau is entirely finished; all that could not be sent to\r\nSulgostow has been deposited in chests, of which Miss Zawistowska keeps\r\nthe keys. Barbara is very well pleased that she is to take Miss\r\nZawistowska with her; she has been accustomed to see her ever since she\r\nwas a child, and, when far away from her mother, will be very happy to\r\nhave near her a careful person whom she can trust, and with whom such\r\ndear remembrances are linked.\r\n\r\nShe will also be accompanied by several of our suite. She will have two\r\nchamberlains, two young girls (her god-daughters) who embroider\r\nbeautifully, a waiting woman, and a young lady companion. The latter is\r\nof an excellent family, and is endowed with infinite wit and good sense;\r\nher name is Louisa Linowska: she has lived in the castle several years,\r\nand Barbara is passionately fond of her. There are several other young\r\ngirls desirous of entering the service of the future lady starostine; if\r\nmy parents would consent, she would soon have a dozen at least. When I\r\nmarry, I will take a still larger number into my service; I have already\r\npromised three of our young girls that I will take them with me. One is\r\nthe daughter of Hyacinth, keeper of the table furniture. The poor man\r\nmade me a profound bow, and his brows unbent for the first time in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday, _February 24th._\r\n\r\nTo-morrow will be Barbara's wedding day. What a crowd there will be! The\r\nminister Borch, the king's representative, has arrived, as also\r\nKochanowski, son of the Duke of Courland's castellan, and the duke's\r\nfavorite. Kochanowski is a very accomplished young man; one may truly\r\nsay: As the master, so the man (iaki pan taki kram).\r\n\r\nThe invitations were issued for yesterday evening, and every one has\r\nbeen exact in coming. The arrival of the guests was magnificent;\r\neverything had been prepared for their reception; expresses announced\r\ntheir coming, and our dragoons, all ranged in battle array, presented\r\narms to each lord as he appeared. The cannon were discharged, and the\r\nmusketry kept up a rolling fire, while at intervals were heard joyous\r\npeals of music. I never witnessed any scene so beautiful, so animated,\r\nand imposing as that of the reception. One may well believe that the\r\nmost especial honors had been reserved for the king's representative. My\r\nfather awaited him with uncovered head upon the drawbridge, and before\r\nhe reached the castle he was obliged to pass through a double file of\r\ncourtiers, guests, and attendants. He received profound salutations from\r\nright and from left, and the hurrahs seemed never ending.\r\n\r\nThe contract of marriage was signed to-day amid a large concourse of\r\npersons, and in presence of the appointed witnesses. I do not understand\r\nthe forms of the document, but I do know that the young bride's presents\r\nare superb and in the best taste. The starost has given her three\r\nstrings of Oriental pearls and a pair of diamond earrings with drops.\r\nThe palatine's gifts are a diamond cross, an aigrette, and a diadem; the\r\ncolonel, always amiable and gallant, has presented her with a charming\r\nwatch and chain from Paris. The Abbé Vincent's gifts are worthy of\r\nhimself, consisting of certain precious relics. She is indeed\r\noverwhelmed with kindness.\r\n\r\nBarbara has never worn any jewelry; until now, her only ornament has\r\nbeen a little ring bearing an image of the Blessed Virgin; she will\r\ncertainly not lay that aside, notwithstanding all her pretty new things.\r\n\r\nBut I must stop writing, for here comes my morning dress, all nicely\r\nbleached and ironed. The embroidery makes an excellent effect; I must\r\nput the last stitches into the dress and then carry it to Miss\r\nZawistowska, that she may offer it to Barbara to-morrow when she\r\ndresses; how lovely she will look in the pretty white morning dress!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SLEEPING PERI.\r\n\r\nLINES SUGGESTED BY PALMER'S STATUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lo! upon the stone reposing,\r\n    Dewy sleep her eyelids closing,\r\n        Rests the Fay;\r\n    Wearily hath the exile wandered,\r\n    Sadly o'er her sorrow pondered,\r\n        All the day.\r\n\r\n    Flinty pathways, lone and dreary,\r\n    Quite unmeet for foot of Peri,\r\n        Soft and fair;--\r\n    Heavy air with vapors laden,\r\n    Shrinking, fragile wings from Aidenn\r\n        May not dare;--\r\n\r\n    Such the gifts our planet proffers,\r\n    Such the thorny home she offers\r\n        Spirits fine:\r\n    Artists, poets, earthward sent us,\r\n    Heavenly natures, briefly lent us,\r\n        Droop like thine!\r\n\r\n    Happy if, amid their dreaming,\r\n    They can feel the glories streaming\r\n        From above;--\r\n    See the light, and hear the flowing,\r\n    Gushing anthems--melting, glowing\r\n        Strains of love!\r\n\r\n    Happy Peri! faintly smiling;\r\n    Quivering lip, the sense beguiling,\r\n        Dimpled cheek,\r\n    Form ethereal, heavenly moulded,\r\n    Shadowing eyelids, soft wings folded\r\n        Rest to seek,--\r\n\r\n    All betray thee, young immortal,\r\n    Eden's child, without its portal\r\n        Doomed to roam!\r\n    Yet thy spirit sees the glory,\r\n    Hears entranced the rapturous story\r\n        Of thy home.\r\n\r\n    Who, O Fay, would dare to wake thee,\r\n    From ecstatic visions take thee\r\n        But to weep?\r\n    Softly dreaming, waking never\r\n    Till thy dreams are truths forever,\r\n        Sweetly sleep!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LOST DARLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boom of cannon in the distance, flags floating gaily in the bright\r\nmorning air, strains of martial music filling it, a waving of caps and\r\nhandkerchiefs, shouts in the streets below, and the tramp of many feet.\r\nA regiment is passing! To a stern fate, that beckons darkly in the\r\ndistance, these patriots are moving, with firm, determined tread--to\r\nlong, exhausting marches, and fireless bivouac; to hunger and cold; to\r\nsufferings in varied forms; to wounds and imprisonment; _to death_! God\r\nknows when and how they are going;--and, amid the doomed throng slowly\r\npassing, the bright face of my darling smilingly upturned to mine. I\r\nwave my hand and kiss it; my handkerchief is wet through and through.\r\n\r\nHe came to me but an hour since, decked in his uniform (a lamb decked\r\nfor the slaughter). 'I'm a lieutenant now,' he said, tapping his\r\nshoulder gaily; 'I shall rival Sam Patch at a leap, and jump to the head\r\nat once. Three months is enough to make a colonel of me.' And so, with\r\nhis young heart beating high and warm, upborne by wild hopes like these,\r\nhe held me to his heart at parting, and went away quite joyously, my\r\npoor darling! shedding only a few tears in sympathy with mine. I watch\r\nhis form until I lose it in the mass before me; then I watch the mass\r\nmoving slowly, slowly on, bearing him away from me; till the heavy tramp\r\ndies out upon the air, and the dark mass, growing less and less, becomes\r\na dim speck in the distance; and the music wanes, and wanes, and dies\r\nout also, and in the still air about me only the voice of the wind is\r\nheard: coming and going at long, lazy intervals, it speaks to my inner\r\nsense with a warning note, a low requiem sound. Why is it that it takes\r\nthat weird tone always when sorrow is darkly waiting for me in the\r\nfuture? What prophet's voice speaks to me in it? What invisible thing\r\nwithout addresses its wild warning to the invisible within? As I\r\nlistened, my soul grew chill and dark with the shadow of a coming gloom;\r\nmy heart grew cold. God help me! How wildly, how almost despairingly I\r\nprayed for my darling's life!\r\n\r\nAlone in the world, we were all in all to each other. Mine was a wild,\r\nexclusive love. Heart and soul were bound up in him. Other girls had\r\ntheir lovers; my fond heart beat for him alone. What tie nearer and\r\ndearer than the tie of blood united us? What bond, sacred and invisible,\r\nbound our souls together? I know not; I only know that my heart and mind\r\nechoed always the thoughts and moods of his; that, no matter what dreary\r\ndistance lay between us, our souls held communication still; that I\r\nrejoiced when he was glad; and wept when I said, 'He is sorrowful\r\nto-day.' He had gone away gay and hopeful, and had left me\r\nweeping--oppressed by vague fears and chill forebodings, my heart could\r\nnot echo _now_ the happy mood of his. Wild and weird, all that dreary\r\nday, the wind moaned its warning; and the sad echo sounded through other\r\ndreary days that followed this; and dreary nights came also, when I\r\nprayed and wept, and covered the pictured face with tears and\r\nkisses--when I cried, 'God keep my precious one, and bring my darling\r\nback to me;' and that was all my prayer;--when I sank to fitful\r\nslumbers, and wildly dreamed of shell and cannon ball, and bullets thick\r\nas hail, of foes met in deadly fray, of shielding my darling's form with\r\nmine--there, where all was smoke and darkness and blood and horror--and\r\ndying gladly in his stead. Or the scene changed from horror to\r\ndesolation, and, with a dreadful sense of isolation on me, alone in the\r\ndarkness I wandered up and down, blindly searching for him I never\r\nfound; or finding him, perhaps, covered with ghastly wounds, and dead,\r\nquite dead; and then starting broad awake with horror at the sight.\r\n\r\nGod help us! us women, with our wild, inordinate affections, when Death\r\nwaits in ambush for our darlings, whom we are powerless to save from the\r\nsmallest of life's ills and perils! A letter came at last, eight dear\r\npages, with all the margins filled. Long, confidential, loving, with\r\njust a thought of sadness in it; a slight, almost imperceptible shadow\r\nresting on the glowing hopes with which he left; yet bright withal,\r\nbright like himself. The charm of novelty was potent yet. How I read it\r\no'er and o'er, this first dear message from him; how I kissed the\r\nsenseless thing; how my tears fell upon it; how day and night I wore it\r\non my heart, until another took its place!\r\n\r\nThey came at stated intervals _now_, and as the time wore on, and their\r\ntone changed, little by little, I knew that the hard life he led began\r\nto tell upon him--that, petted, fondled, cherished as he had been,\r\nunfitted for hardship of any kind, they grew at times almost too great\r\nfor calm endurance. He never complained, my grand, brave boy; he spoke\r\nof them lightly always, sometimes jestingly, but he could not deceive\r\nthat fine interior sense. I knew there were times when he turned\r\nheartsick from the wild life that claimed him; I could see how his noble\r\nnature shrank from all that was coarse and revolting in it; how he\r\nlonged for fireside joys and sweet domestic peace, and pined with dreary\r\nhomesickness; how his heart cried out for me in the melancholy night.\r\nAnd then even this comfort, that had softened the dull, longing pain\r\nwithin, was denied me--no letters came. Mail after mail went and came,\r\nand I grew feverish with suspense. I imagined him beset by ghastly\r\nperils, and, with torturing uncertainty wearing my very life away, I\r\nwatched and waited as women are wont to do. Then dark rumors were afloat\r\nof foes making a desperate advance, and of bloody battle pending. One\r\nnight a horror fell upon my troubled sleep--an appalling gloom, a\r\nshuddering, suffocating sense of some impending doom. Battling fiercely\r\nand blindly with this dread, invisible something, I awoke in deadly\r\nfright, to find the terror no less clear to my perceptions, no less\r\npalpable and real, and to wrestle with it still. Some blind instinct in\r\nme called aloud for air; with difficulty mastering an almost\r\noverpowering impulse to rush out into the night, I flew to the window,\r\nraised it, and looked out. A fierce storm was raging--a storm of whose\r\nvery existence I had until that moment been unconscious. The thunder\r\nrolled, and muttered, and broke in wild, fearful crashes. Sheets of\r\nlightning every instant lighted up the blackness, and made the sky\r\nterrific. Gushes of wind and rain wet and chilled me through and\r\nthrough. Unmindful of it, with that fine interior sense aroused, I\r\nlistened with all my soul--not to the thunder's fearful voice, to the\r\nwild beating of the storm, or to the wind's melancholy moaning, but to\r\n_something_ on the tempestuous air, and yet a stranger to it.\r\n\r\nThere came a lull in the storm at last, and then, O God! O God! through\r\nthe sullen gloom, his voice was calling to me. Now faint and low, as if\r\nhis life was ebbing; then raised in agony, wild with supplication and\r\nsharp with pain. I saw him covered with gaping wounds, on a hideous\r\nfield, piled with slain and soaked with blood. I went mad, I think: I\r\nhave a vague remembrance of rushing out into that fearful storm,\r\nundressed as I was, with wild resolve to follow the sound of the voice,\r\nto reach him somehow, or die in the mad attempt; of being brought back,\r\nshut up in my room, and a sort of guard placed over me; of making wild\r\nattempts to rush out again, and struggling ineffectually with those that\r\nheld me back--of raving wildly; then of long and dreamless slumbers,\r\nwhen I had become exhausted, and the sharp agony was past; of rousing\r\nmyself to go about in a listless, apathetic way, waiting with dulled\r\nsense for lists of killed and wounded; of the doctor bringing the paper\r\nto me and saying, with his face all light: 'He is not dead; you will\r\nfind his name among the wounded;' of finding where he was, eluding their\r\nvigilance, and travelling night and day until I reached the place. All\r\nthis seems vague and unreal, as a half-forgotten dream--too dim and\r\nlifeless for memory. Entire change of scene, new sights and faces, and,\r\nmore than all, the conviction that the time had come for action _now_,\r\nand that _he_ would need me, roused me from this misty state a little.\r\nWhen I landed at the place, I think I recovered the clear consciousness\r\nof my surroundings, while standing in the provost-marshal's office (the\r\ncity was under military rule) waiting my turn to speak.\r\n\r\nThen I thought for the first time what a mad thing it was in me to have\r\ncome at all--at least, to have come in the way I had come; I, so\r\nunpractical, so wofully lacking in that sterling common sense, that\r\npotent weapon with which women battled successfully with the stern\r\nrealities of life; and thinking, too, with a dull pain at my heart, that\r\ndoubtless my darling would suffer by reason of my ignorance and\r\ninability. I studied the mass of strange faces about me, thinking to\r\nwhich I would turn for help, if help were needed. After reading them,\r\none after another, and rejecting them, I turned at last to a group in\r\nfront of me, and singled out one that was addressing the others, a man\r\nof consequence among them--at least a certain superiority of air and\r\nmanner led to that conjecture. He had a fine open face, whose expression\r\nchanged continually; and the more I studied the face, the more I placed\r\na blind trust and reliance in it. Attracted by the magnetism of a fixed\r\ngaze, probably, his eyes wandered from the group about him, after a\r\nlittle while, wandered aimlessly about the room, and then met mine.\r\nSeeing that I was watching him, or observing, perhaps, that I was\r\nsuffering, though, Heaven knows, the sight of misery of all kinds\r\n_there_ was common enough, he crossed the room and came to me. 'You may\r\nbe obliged to wait some time longer yet,' he said, in a tone of hearty\r\nkindness; 'you look ill, madam. You had better sit down.' He found a\r\nchair and brought it to me. He was on the point of leaving, but I\r\ngrasped his arm as he turned to go. 'If you have any influence here,' I\r\nsaid, in a half-distracted way, 'tell the clerk, tell somebody to let my\r\nturn come next. My brother is here and wounded; I have travelled night\r\nand day to get to him; it's dreadful to be so near, and yet to wait and\r\nwait.' He turned in grave surprise, and looked at me narrowly, fancying,\r\nfrom my incoherency, I was taking leave of my senses possibly. 'Your\r\nname, young lady?' he said, at last. I gave it, 'Margaret Dunn.' He\r\nstarted at the name, and a heavy shadow came over his face: 'And your\r\nbrother,' he said, hurriedly, 'is Lieutenant Dunn, of the Fifty-fifth\r\nIllinois Volunteers, Company A? I am surgeon of the Fifty-fifth; I know\r\nhim well. He was a brave fellow, and as fine, manly, and handsome a\r\nfellow as one need wish to see.' He ended with a sigh, and mingling with\r\nthe shadow there came a look of pity in his face. The past tense, which\r\nI am sure he used unconsciously; the look of pity; the sigh but half\r\nsuppressed, overpowered me with dread. 'He has not died of his wounds?'\r\nI gasped, grasping his arm convulsively, 'O God! he is not dead?' 'He is\r\nalive,' said the doctor, gravely. 'Father, I thank Thee, Thou hast heard\r\nmy prayer!'\r\n\r\nThe sudden transition from that mortal dread of death to the blessed\r\ncertainty of life was too much; my joy was too great; forgetful of my\r\nsurroundings, unmindful of his presence, I wept and sobbed aloud. When I\r\nhad controlled my emotion in a measure, or at least their stormy outward\r\nmanifestation, I found the doctor regarding me with the same grave face.\r\n'You should not have come here in your present weak, excited state,' he\r\nsaid, at last, 'or, rather, you should not have come at all. From sights\r\nand sounds of a hospital, even strong men turn with a shudder. It's no\r\nplace for a delicate woman.' 'He is there,' I murmured, tremulously; 'I\r\ncan suffer anything for those I love.' Regarding me in silence for a\r\nmoment, he looked as if taking my measure. 'These women that _can_\r\nbear,' he said, with a sigh, 'sometimes overrate their powers of\r\nendurance.' 'Do you think I shall have to wait much longer? do you think\r\nI can go soon now?' I questioned, appealingly, breaking the silence that\r\nhad fallen between us. 'No, you must wait your turn,' said the doctor,\r\ndecidedly; 'besides, you are not calm enough yet; the surgeons are at\r\nwork in the ward where we are going. They are taking off a man's\r\nlimb--two or three of them, for that matter. I shan't take you there\r\nuntil the operations are finished.' Then first came the horrid thought\r\nthat _he_ might be mutilated in the same way. Vague, indistinct,\r\ndreadful visions uprose before me, of all sorts and kinds of horrid\r\ndisfigurement, and I grew sick and faint. 'Not _his_ limb!' I gasped,\r\nstruggling with a deathly faintness. 'No, not his,' said the doctor,\r\nsorrowfully. The same cloud was still there that had settled on his face\r\nwhen he first spoke of him; the same pity for me shining through it.\r\n'There is a room here where the ladies go when they have long to wait.\r\nYou had better go in there and rest yourself. I will bring you some tea\r\nand something light and palatable in the shape of food, and you must eat\r\nand drink. Confiscated property, you see,' he said, as he entered; 'a\r\nrebel family walked out, and we walked in; comfortable quarters.' I\r\nnoticed then there was a carpet on the floor, sofa, mirrors, and other\r\ncomforts. 'Sit down,' said the doctor. He had taken the tone of command\r\nwith me--a tone I would have resented at any other time; now, nerveless\r\nand weak, relying on him solely, I obeyed him like a sick child. He\r\nbrought the tea, watched me while I drank it, looked on while I choked\r\ndown tears and food together. He ordered me to go to sleep, and left me.\r\nDoubtless even this command had its effect. Things grew dreamy and\r\nindistinct after a while; perhaps I slept a little; but the time seemed\r\nvery, very long. At last his tap at the door roused me from this\r\nhalf-conscious state. 'Ready?' he briefly questioned, as he looked in, a\r\nmoment after. I said yes, tremulously: now that the time had come, I\r\ntrembled so I could scarcely keep my feet. He gave me his arm as we went\r\nout together. 'It's not far,' he said, encouragingly, 'just across\r\nhere.' The fresh air did me good. Quite likely, the conversation he\r\nperseveringly maintained on indifferent subjects, in spite of my random\r\nreplies, was also of service to me. I grew calmer as we went along. The\r\ndistance was but short, and we soon reached the place of our\r\ndestination--a large hotel, which had been hurriedly converted into a\r\nhospital.\r\n\r\n'Come,' said the doctor, pausing with his hand upon the door, and\r\nturning to me, 'cheer up! There is no misery, after all, but what is in\r\nthe comparative degree. Things are never so bad but that they may have\r\nbeen worse. I dare say, on occasion you can be a brave little woman.'\r\n\r\n'I can,' I returned, eagerly, too grateful for his penetration, or at\r\nleast his good opinion, and too sad and abstracted altogether, to notice\r\nthat he was paying me a compliment. 'I can, indeed; indeed, you haven't\r\nseen the best part of me.'\r\n\r\nHe smiled just the ghost of a smile in answer, as we went in. He led me\r\nthrough several rooms into what had been a large dining hall--a chill,\r\nbare, desolate place. Cots were ranged up and down the room, cots across\r\nit, cots filled up the centre, and all, _all_ filled with sick and\r\nwounded men. I thought if I was once in the room with my brother, some\r\ninstinct would lead me to him; but I felt no drawing toward any one of\r\nthose miserable bedsides, and a chill of disappointment fell upon me.\r\n'Take me to the ward where my brother is lying,' I said to the doctor,\r\npleadingly, 'ah, pray do!' 'This _is_ the ward,' he replied, but he did\r\nnot take me to him. He stopped at every cot we passed. Of my burning\r\nimpatience, which he could not choose but see, of the urgent and almost\r\npassionate appeals I made to hasten his progress, he took no notice\r\nwhatever. He stopped almost every moment; he felt the pulse of one\r\npatient, questioned another, dealt out medicine here and there--took his\r\nown time for everything. We stopped at last where, on the outside of the\r\ncoverlet, lay a wounded soldier, half dressed; a poor, mutilated\r\ncreature; a leg and an arm were gone. The face was turned toward the\r\nwall, away from us; not a muscle moved; he was sleeping, probably. 'Take\r\nme to my brother,' I piteously moaned, shuddering with horror as I\r\nturned from the unaccustomed sight. 'I have waited so long; do take me\r\nto my brother.' 'This is somebody's brother!' said the doctor, sharply.\r\nSomething in the tone, not the sharpness of it--something half familiar\r\nin the broken outline of the form, caused a half-suffocating sense of a\r\nvague, unutterable horror. A deathly faintness seized me; I sank into a\r\nchair beside the bed. The doctor gave me water to drink--hastily and\r\nsilently sprinkled some water upon my head and face. There was a\r\nmovement of the poor maimed form upon the bed--he gave me a warning\r\nlook--the face turned toward us. It was my darling's! 'My life!'\r\nShivering and shuddering I threw myself upon the narrow bed beside him,\r\nclasped my poor darling in my arms, and held his stricken heart to mine.\r\nThe hard, defiant look upon his features melted into one of\r\ntenderness--down the worn face the tears fell slowly. 'I didn't know as\r\nyou would love me just the same,' he said. It was his right arm that was\r\ngone. Calling him by every endearing name with wild expressions of\r\naffection, I wiped the tears tenderly away, covering the dear face with\r\nkisses, while my own fell fast. The doctor left us together for a\r\nlittle--albeit used to scenes like this, wiping _his_ eyes as he went\r\naway.\r\n\r\nA gust of bitter passion swept over my darling. He started up. 'Rascally\r\nrebels!' he cried; 'cursed bullets! Why couldn't they have been aimed at\r\nmy heart, and _killed_ me! I was willing to give my life--but to make a\r\nwreck, a broken hull of me! Look at me, Maggie, a poor, maimed wretch.\r\nWhat am I fit for? Who will care for me _now?_ To be an object of\r\nloathing!' he continued, between his set teeth; 'to be a sight of\r\nhorror; to win, perhaps, after she gets used to the deformity, a little\r\nmeagre love for charity's sake; to be scorned, and loathed, and pitied;\r\nif I could get only off from the face of the earth--out of the sight of\r\nmen; if God would let me die!' Wounded sorely as he was, his boyish\r\nvanity in his really handsome person, his manly pride in its strength,\r\nwas more sorely wounded still. Yes, strangers _would_ think him a sight\r\nto behold: had not even I turned shuddering from that disfigured form,\r\nbefore I knew it was my darling's? He _was_ ruined for life, and he was\r\nyoung too--only nineteen. He was very weak, and this passionate outbreak\r\nof feeling had exhausted him. It was but a flash of his old fire at\r\nbest. His head sank back upon my arm again; he lay with his eyes closed,\r\nresting for a little; when he spoke again, his voice was low and\r\nwavering, tremulous with tears.\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't care so much, only----' He paused, hesitated, drew with\r\ndifficulty a little locket from his bosom, and gazed upon it tearfully.\r\nA jealous pain shot through my heart. I had thought until that moment\r\nthat I was all in all to him, first in his affections, as he was in\r\nmine; that no rival shared his heart. _This_ was the bitterest pang of\r\nall. I looked down at the beautiful face set in the locket, perfect as\r\nto form and color, with such a fierce hatred of its original as I hope\r\nin God's name I shall never feel again for any mortal breathing.\r\n\r\n'It's all over between us,' he sighed; 'even if I were ungenerous enough\r\nto ask it, she wouldn't receive me now.' My face spoke my scorn. 'Don't\r\nblame her,' he said, pathetically; 'it isn't natural she should, poor\r\nlittle thing! This for what she might have been to me.' Then, he kissed\r\nthe pictured face, and sorrowfully laid it back again upon his heart. 'I\r\nthought to go back to her a colonel at least--a general, perhaps,' he\r\nwent on, with a piteous smile; 'to be crowned with laurels, loaded with\r\nhonors and proudly claim her as my bride: I little thought that this\r\nwould be the end!' It was a man's grave comment on a boy's wild dream.\r\nHe had buried his youth in those two weeks of anguish. It was a man's\r\nface that looked upon me, and I read in it a man's strong endurance and\r\nstern resolve. That, and the smile with which he said it, moved me more\r\nthan any emotion, however hopeless or despairing, could have done. My\r\ngrief burst forth anew.\r\n\r\nDearer, a thousand times dearer, now that love had left him, and\r\nyouthful friends turned coldly away. Ah! thank God! bless God! There are\r\nnone so dear to each other, so inexpressibly dear, as those whom sorrow\r\njoins; no tie that binds so closely as the sacred bond of suffering. I\r\nsaid so brokenly, sobbing out my love and sorrow, as I held him to my\r\nheart. His longing for home had been intense; now that he had seen me,\r\nit became wellnigh insupportable. To go away from this his place of\r\nsuffering--from the myriad eyes bent upon him here, and creep back\r\nbroken-hearted to that sacred sheltering haven, and hide his great grief\r\nthere--this wish absorbed him quite. 'I want to go home, Maggie,' he\r\nsaid, in a broken-hearted whisper, clinging to me the while; 'I want to\r\ngo home and die.' Die! I wouldn't hear the word; I stopped its\r\nhalf-formed utterance with tears and kisses. The doctor shook his head\r\nat the suggestion and counselled delay; but he was burning with\r\nimpatience, and I was resolute. We started the very next day. We\r\ntravelled by easy stages, but he grew weaker all the time: toward the\r\nlast, with his head upon my breast, he would sleep for hours, peacefully\r\nas a little child. Reduced to almost infant weakness when we reached our\r\njourney's end, they took him in their arms tenderly as they would have\r\ntaken an infant, and laid him on my bed. There, in that darkened room, I\r\nnursed him night and day, striving to win him back to thoughts of life,\r\nand love of it. 'It's too late, Maggie,' he would say, with placid\r\nresignation; 'life has nothing for me, dear; I want to go to sleep--to\r\nthat long, dreamless sleep, where memory never wakes to haunt us!' But\r\nI couldn't bear it--I wouldn't have it so. I bade him think of how _my_\r\nheart would break if he, too, died and left me! In my earnest love, I\r\ncalled Heaven to witness that I was ready not only to die for him, if\r\nneed be, but to do a better, nobler thing, God helping me--to live for\r\nhim; eschewing other ties, to devote my life and heart to this one\r\naffection. We had wealth, thank God! (I never thanked God for that\r\nbefore.) We would go to far-off lands as soon as he was able--away from\r\nold sights and scenes, where no familiar object would recall the past,\r\nand where, cut off from all association, we could be all and all to each\r\nother; and, with ardent hope, I commenced immediate preparations for our\r\nvoyage. I read him books of travel; showed him the half-finished\r\ngarments intended for our journey; purchased all things needful, even to\r\nthe books we would read upon the way--richly paid for toilsome endeavor,\r\nfor days of patient waiting, if I but roused in him even a passing\r\ninterest in the subject, won from him but the shadow of a smile. Ah!\r\neven those days had their gleams of sunshine. I was his only nurse, his\r\nsole dependence, his all; there was exquisite happiness in that! I said\r\nto myself, he is mine now, and always will be; and then I thought of the\r\nfair face so lovingly resting against the weary heart, and grew\r\nexultant, Heaven forgive me! and said, 'Nothing will take him from me\r\nnow.' One day he rallied very suddenly. A portion of his old vigor\r\nseemed to animate his frame; something of the old look was in his face.\r\nHe took my hand and laid it tenderly against his cheek; he smiled twice\r\nduring the morning; I kissed him and said, 'We shall be able to start\r\nsoon now, my darling!' The doctor gravely watched us both, but I would\r\nnot let his gravity disturb me. He called me to him as he left the room.\r\nAs I went out, the dear brown eyes were watching me. I turned to nod and\r\nsmile to him, saying blithely, as I joined the doctor, 'Don't you think\r\nwe shall be able to start in three weeks, doctor?' 'Shut the door, my\r\ndear,' he said; I had left it ajar. The tone startled me. There was\r\ncompassion in it; and I noticed now that he was walking up and down the\r\nroom in an agitated way. 'My dear,' he said again, 'you had better take\r\na seat farther from the door.' His voice was hoarse this time--his tone,\r\nhis air, his unwonted tenderness, were ominous. 'What is the matter?' I\r\nsaid, in sudden fear; 'can't we go as soon as we have intended?'\r\n\r\nHe did not answer me at first; he walked to the window and looked out;\r\nhe turned to me again after a little:\r\n\r\n'He is bound on a longer voyage,' he said, with a tremor in his voice;\r\n'he is going to a more distant country.'\r\n\r\nI did not start or cry; I did not comprehend the meaning of his words. I\r\nsat silent, looking at him. He came to me, took both my hands in his:\r\n'Hush!' he said; 'don't cry aloud--it would disturb him. But I must tell\r\nyou the truth: he won't live three days.' I understood it all now--took\r\nin the _full_ meaning of his dreadful words. I did not cry or faint; I\r\ndid not even weep; I thought my heart was bleeding--that the blood was\r\nactually oozing from it drop by drop. I clung to the doctor as I would\r\nto the strong arm of an earthly saviour with wild entreaty, with\r\npassionate appeal. I prayed him to save my darling, as if he held within\r\nhis grasp the keys of life and death. I offered all my wealth; I made\r\nunheard-of vows--promised impossible things. In the anguish of my\r\nsupplication, I fell at his very feet. 'My dear,' he said, as he raised\r\nme tenderly up again, 'even in this world there is a limit to wealth's\r\npotent power; it is always powerless in a time like this.' I had sunk\r\ninto a chair, exhausted by emotion, and chill with dread, my face buried\r\nin my hands despairingly. He laid his hand upon my head in fatherly\r\ncompassion: 'It's what we've all got to come to, sooner or later,' he\r\nwent on, tremulously. 'As life goes on, our hopes die out one by one;\r\nand, one after another, death claims our treasures. Bow to what is\r\ninevitable; pray for resignation.'\r\n\r\nI couldn't--I wouldn't. I prayed for _his_ life, yet in a hopeless,\r\ndespairing way. To the All-powerful my soul went out continually in one\r\nwild, desperate cry. I battled fiercely with that stern impending fate,\r\nyet I felt from the first how vainly. Around my poor, wounded, dying\r\nboy, night and day I hovered constantly--I would not leave him for an\r\ninstant. Every hour was bearing him away from me--drifting him farther\r\nand farther out into an unknown sea. I crept to his side when I could do\r\nnothing more for him, and laid my head beside his on the pillow.\r\nSometimes I slept there for very sorrow, grasping him instinctively the\r\nwhile, seeking even in sleep, with fierce, rebellious will, to stem the\r\ninvisible tide of that dark river, and bear him back to life. 'He would\r\nnot live three days,' the doctor had said: he _did_ live just _three\r\ndays._ It was on the evening of the third, just as the day was fading,\r\nthat he called me softly to him. I had opened the window and put back\r\nthe curtain, to admit the air and the waning light.\r\n\r\nThe wind rose as the twilight deepened, waking at intervals in the\r\ngloomy stillness, as if from sleep. It filled the room every now and\r\nthen with a sad, sighing sound, then died out slowly, again to swell,\r\nagain to fall, sad as the tolling of a funeral knell. He lay listening\r\nto it when I went to him, with parted lips and strange solemnity of\r\nface. Too heart-broken for speech, I knelt beside him with a stifled\r\nmoan. 'Magsie,' (that was his pet name for me,) 'I thought it was your\r\nnotion, dear, but there is a voice in the wind to-night, and it is\r\ncalling me.' I made an effort to answer him, to speak; to tell him at\r\nthe last how precious he had always been to me--how inexpressibly dear;\r\nto win from him some parting word of fond endearment that I might\r\nremember always; but the words died out in hoarse, inarticulate murmurs.\r\n'Yes, a voice _is_ calling to me, and it falls through miles and miles\r\nof air; then the wind takes it up and brings it to me. They want me up\r\nthere, and I am going, Magsie; kiss me, dear.' The one arm stole around\r\nmy neck; the chilled lips met mine in a lingering farewell pressure. He\r\nwent on, feebly: 'I have been wild and wayward, Magsie, in the times\r\ngone by; I have grieved your great love sometimes, by giving you a cross\r\nword or look, not meaning it, dear, never meaning it, but because a\r\nperverse mood seized me. Forgive me, dear; don't remember it against me,\r\nsister!' Words came at last; they burst forth in a low moan of anguish:\r\n'My darling! my darling! you break my heart!' Then my poor boy crept\r\ncloser to me, in a last fond effort at endearment, and laid his cold\r\ncheek close against my own. The gloom deepened. The form within my clasp\r\ngrew cold, became a lifeless weight. I knew it, but I could not lay it\r\ndown. I still chafed the pulseless hand, and kissed it, and still I\r\npressed the poor, maimed, lifeless form closer and closer to my heart,\r\ntill reason fled, and I remember nothing. They unwound the chilled arm\r\nfrom about my neck; they thought I, too, was dead.... With muffled\r\ndrumbeat and martial music, with horrid pomp of war, they buried my\r\ndarling as soldiers are buried that die at home; but on the grave over\r\nwhich was fired the parting volley there fell no kindred's tear: I, the\r\nonly mourner, lay _raving_ in my room.\r\n\r\nWintry winds have piled the dreary snow above that grave; spring has\r\nkissed it into bloom and verdure; summer skies have smiled above it; and\r\nthe maimed form they laid there has melted into nothing _now!_ Time has\r\nsoftened the despair of my grief--the worst bitterness is past.\r\n\r\nThrough the gloomy portals of that dark gate of suffering, an unseen\r\nHand has led me out into a broader and a higher life; and the heart\r\nthat held darling _only_, purged from its selfishness by the fierce fire\r\nof affliction, beats now for all humanity. Hearts whose love and\r\ngratitude God has given me the power to win, say, out of the fulness of\r\ntheir love for me, that a ministering angel is among them in woman's\r\nguise; that no hand is half so lavish in its gifts, no heart so full of\r\nsympathy, no watcher's form so constant beside the couch of pain. The\r\nsick follow me with murmured prayer and blessing; and wounded soldiers\r\nturn to kiss my shadow as I pass. Yet ever as the twilight falls I steal\r\naway to listen to the night wind's moaning, and ever in the gloom I feel\r\nan unseen presence--an arm about my neck--a cheek laid close to mine.\r\nJourneying on the lonely, rugged path of duty, 'following meekly where\r\nHis footsteps lead,' I work and wait, and patiently abide my\r\ntime--content if, when the welcome summons come, when life's day is\r\nfading, I may feel my darling's face pressed close to my own. He may not\r\ncome to me, but I shall go to him, where he may wear his glorified body\r\nforever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREASON, RHYME, AND RHYTHM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.--UNITY.\r\n\r\nThe Divine Attributes, the base of all true Art.\r\n\r\nHaving already shown that the aspirations of man, made in the image of\r\nhis God, are always directed toward that wondrous background from which\r\nall life projects--the Infinite, we now propose to make a few remarks\r\nupon the manifestation of some of the remaining attributes revealed to\r\nhim, and which he is forever striving to incarnate in the works of art.\r\n\r\nBeauty, in its proper expression, must be allied to or suggest the\r\nInfinite, for in it alone can ceaseless _variety_ be united with\r\nabsolute _unity_. Unity is an essential characteristic of life itself;\r\nvariety resolving itself into unity, and unity expanding itself into\r\nvariety, mark all that God has made. As a necessary consequence of the\r\nposition we have assumed, viz.: 'That art is not a servile copy, but\r\nrather a creation of man in the Spirit of Nature,' _Variety and Unity_\r\nmust characterize every great work of art, as they mark every work of\r\nthe Creator. Let us take any of the humblest things which He has made, a\r\nflower, for example: Unity, Order, Proportion, and Symmetry are in all\r\nits fragile leaves--the Great Over-Soul seems to have lingered lovingly\r\nover the elaboration of its idea, and stamped upon its fragrant leaves,\r\nperishing and trivial as they may seem, the secrets of Infinity! With\r\nwhat variety it is marked! How many shades in the gradations of the\r\ncolor! What infinitesimal changes in the direction of the gentle\r\ncurvature of the rounded lines! what richness in the details! what\r\nsubtle and penetrating tenderness in the perfume! _Love_, _Infinity_,\r\n_Unity_, _Order_, _Proportion_, _Symmetry_, mark all the Divine Works:\r\n_Unity_, _Order_, _Proportion_, _Symmetry_, _Love_, as manifested in the\r\ncareful rendering of the subject in hand, with the suggestion of that\r\nmystic Infinite in which all being is cradled, and from which all art is\r\nnurtured, should, on their lower level in their finite degree, mark\r\nevery work of art. But to our subject: the divine attribute of unity,\r\nand its manifestation in and through the finite.\r\n\r\nAll things, except God, receive externally some perfection from other\r\nthings. We will not now consider the unity of His mystical Trinity, but\r\nrather dwell upon the necessity of His inherence in all things, without\r\nwhich no creature could retain existence for a moment. We speak of His\r\ncomprehensive unity because it is an object of hope to men; it is that\r\nof which Christ thought when he said: 'Neither pray I for these alone,\r\nbut for them also which shall believe on me through their word: that\r\nthey may be all One, as Thou, Father, art in me, and I in Thee.' There\r\nis no matter, no spirit, that is not capable of unity of some kind with\r\nother creatures, in which unity is found their several perfections, and\r\nwhich is a source of joy for all who see it. The Unity of Spirits is\r\npartly in their sympathy, partly in their giving and taking, and ever in\r\ntheir love, their inseparable dependency on each other and _always_ on\r\ntheir Maker--not like the cold peace of undisturbed stones and solitary\r\nmountains, but the living peace of trust, the living power of\r\nconfidence, _of hands that hold each other and are still_! Who has not\r\nfelt the strength of united love? In the sudden emotion common to\r\nhumanity which we all experience at the sight of suffering, and which\r\nbrought tears from the Holy One on the death of Lazarus, in the strange\r\nshivering which we feel pervade our souls at the shrill cry of anguish,\r\ndo we not recognize more than a simple resemblance of nature--do we not\r\nfeel that the _race_ is really _One_, that a common grief again unites\r\nit, that in this _oneness_ we are all justly partakers in the sin of\r\nAdam, that in this _oneness_ we may partake of the glory of the Brother\r\nwho died to _unite_ the finite with the Infinite?\r\n\r\nIt is to this essential _unity_ of the race that the dramatist owes much\r\nof his power; for let him but strike the common strings of grief and\r\nlove, and the crowd at once show by their words, their gestures, their\r\nlooks, and often by their tears, their earnest sympathy. Even at the\r\nspectacle of an imaginary grief their hearts are moved, the sorrow\r\nthrills through every soul; if the poet has been true to nature, they\r\nfeel that his imaginary characters are but part and parcel of themselves\r\nin their woe. Thus the emotion excited by dramatic representations has\r\nits source in the very root of our being, the _unity_ of our common\r\nnature, in our common brotherhood; consequently, neither in the\r\ninstincts of the body nor the caprices of the poetic fancy. If the poet\r\nwould not break the bond, let him respect the _unities_ of nature,\r\nwhatever view he may take of those of convention. It is to this\r\nwonderful unity with our common nature that the greatest of all\r\nuninspired writers, Shakspeare, owes his universal acknowledgment, his\r\nunequalled power.\r\n\r\nIf, as we have labored to teach, matter always symbolizes mind, we\r\nshould expect to find it also pervaded with the unity pertaining to its\r\nlower rank, and so indeed we find it. In its noblest form the unity of\r\nmatter is that organization of it which builds it into living temples\r\nfor the indwelling spirits, those houses not made with hands--the bodies\r\nof noble men, of fair and loving women.\r\n\r\nIn a lower form, it gives that sweet and strange affinity which adds the\r\nglory of orderly arrangement to its elements, gifting them with the fair\r\nvariety of change and assimilation that turns the dust into crystal, and\r\nseparates the waters above the firmament from those below. It is the\r\nwalking and clinging _together_ that gives power to the winds, weight to\r\nthe waves, heat to the sunbeams, and stability to the mountains. It is\r\nthe 'clinging together' which throws our syllables into words, gives\r\nmetre to poetry, and melody and harmony to sound. Indeed, the clinging\r\ntogether of sounds, as seized by the ear in _time_, with the ever\r\nforming and living ebb and flow of widely different rhythms, exerting\r\nthe most mysterious influences upon the soul, is not less remarkable\r\nthan its more familiar history in space.\r\n\r\nManifold, indeed, would be the generalizations of the different species\r\nof unity, for it is the secret link of all being.\r\n\r\nWe have the unity of separate things subjected to one and the same\r\ninfluence, as the unity of clouds as they are driven by parallel winds,\r\nor ordered by electric currents: there is the unity of myriads of sea\r\nwaves, of the bending and undulating of forest masses.\r\n\r\nIn creatures capable of will, there would be the unity of acts\r\ncontrolled, in all their apparent variety, by its directing power; and\r\nthe unity of emotions in the masses, when swayed by some common impulse.\r\n\r\nThere is also the unity of the origin of things arising from one source,\r\nalways suggesting their common brotherhood: in matter this is manifested\r\nin the unity of the branches of the trees, of the petals and starry rays\r\nof flowers, of the beams of light, of heat, &c., &c.; in spiritual\r\ncreatures it is their filial relation to Him from whom they have their\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\nThere is the unity of sequence, which is that of things which form links\r\nin chains, steps in ascent, and stages in journeys; this, in matter, is\r\nthe unity of communicable forces in their continuance and propagation\r\nfrom one thing to another; it is the passing upward and downward of\r\nbeneficent effects among all things; it is the melody of sounds; the\r\nbeauty of continuous lines; and orderly successions of motions and\r\ntimes. In spiritual creatures, it is their own constant building up by\r\ntrue knowledge and consecutive efforts to higher perfection, and the\r\nsingleness and straightforwardness of their tendencies to more complete\r\nunion with God.\r\n\r\nThere is the unity of membership, which is the union of things\r\nseparately imperfect into a perfect whole; this is the great unity of\r\nwhich all other unities are but parts and means. In matter it is the\r\nconsistency of bodies, the harmony of sounds;--with spiritual beings, it\r\nis their love, happiness, and life in God. But this unity cannot subsist\r\nbetween things _similar_ to each other. Two or more equal or like things\r\ncannot be members the one of the other, nor can they form one or a whole\r\nthing. _Two_ they must remain both in nature and in our conception\r\nunless they are united by a _third_. Thus the arms, which are like each\r\nother, remain always two arms in our conception, and could not be united\r\nby a third arm, but must be linked by something which is not an arm, and\r\nwhich, imperfect without them as they without it, will, with them, form\r\none perfect body. Nor is unity even thus accomplished without a\r\ndifference and opposition of direction in the setting on of members.\r\nTherefore, among things which are to have membership with each other,\r\nthere must be difference or variety; and though it is possible that many\r\nlike things may be made members of one body, yet it is very remarkable\r\nthat this stricture appears rather characteristic of the lower creatures\r\nthan the higher, as the many legs of the caterpillar, and the arms and\r\nsuckers of Radiata seem to prove. As we rise in the order of being the\r\nnumber of similar members becomes less; their structure appearing based\r\non the principle of two things united by a third;--a constant type even\r\nin matter of the Triune Existence.\r\n\r\nOut of the necessity of _unity_ arises that of _variety_, a necessity\r\nvividly felt, because it lies at the surface of things, and is assisted\r\nby our love of change and the power of contrast. It were a mistake to\r\nsuppose that mere variety, without a linking principle of unity, is,\r\nnecessarily, either agreeable or beautiful.\r\n\r\n        'All are needed by each one,\r\n        Nothing is fair or good alone.\r\n    I thought the sparrow's note from heaven,\r\n      Singing at dawn on the alder bough;\r\n    I brought him home in his nest at even;\r\n      He sings the song, but it pleases not now,\r\n    For I could not bring home the river and sky;--\r\n    He sang to my ear,--they sang to my eye.\r\n      The delicate shells lay on the shore;\r\n        The bubbles of the latest wave\r\n        Fresh pearls to their enamel gave;\r\n        And the bellowing of the savage sea\r\n        Greeted their safe escape to me.\r\n        I wiped away the weeds and foam,\r\n        I fetched my seaborn treasures home;\r\n      But the poor, unsightly, noisome things\r\n      Had left their beauty on the shore\r\n    With the sun, and the sand, and the wild uproar.'\r\n\r\nIt is not mere unrelated variety which charms us, for a forest of all\r\nmanner of trees is poor in its effect, while a mass of one species of\r\ntrees is sublime;--the swan, with its purity of unbroken whiteness, is\r\none of the most beautiful of creatures. It is, indeed, only harmonious\r\nand chordal variety, that variety which is necessary to secure and\r\nextend unity (for the greater the number of objects which by their\r\ndifferences become members of one another, the more extended and sublime\r\nis their unity), which is essentially beautiful. _Variety_ is never so\r\nconspicuous as when united with some intimation of _unity_. For example,\r\nthe perpetual change of clouds is monotonous in its very dissimilarity,\r\nnor is difference ever striking where no connection is implied; but if\r\nthrough a range of barred clouds crossing half the heavens, all governed\r\nby the same forces, and falling into one general form, there be yet a\r\nmarked and evident dissimilarity between each member of the great\r\nmass--one more finely drawn, the next more delicately moulded, the next\r\nmore gracefully bent--each broken into differently modelled and\r\nvariously numbered groups,--the _variety_ is doubly striking because\r\ncontrasted with the perfect _unity_ and _symmetry_ of which it forms a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nNow, of that which is thus necessary to the perfection of things, all\r\ntypes and suggestions must be beautiful in whatever way they may suggest\r\nor manifest it. To the perfection of beauty in lines, colors, forms,\r\nmasses, or multitudes, the appearance of unity is absolutely essential.\r\nLet the artist look to it, that our pictures may gain expression; our\r\nmusic cease to weary us through the unceasing dissimilarity of its\r\nparts, highly adorned arabesques running into each other, graceful, but\r\nwithout significance, without any perceptible principle of unity in the\r\njarring '_motifs_;' and our poems have some certain theme, that their\r\nhighly wrought details may not confuse and bewilder the spirit always in\r\nsearch of some central unity. Like the burning sands which, clinging not\r\ntogether in any sweet union of fellowship, blind and confuse us with\r\ntheir drifting masses, are all such essays in art; for an idea capable\r\nof quickening an artistic creation must be vitally One, and every great\r\nwork, notwithstanding its variety and the manifold complexity of its\r\nparts, must form a Whole.\r\n\r\nThe _association of ideas_, upon which is based the _unity_ of the\r\ncontinuous life of the individual, with the pervading sense of personal\r\nidentity, has been aptly called the '_cohesion of the moral world_.' It\r\nis not less powerful, less irresistible, than that of the physical\r\nworld. The association of ideas is a constituent and necessary phase of\r\nthe _unity_ of our mental and moral being, the indispensable condition\r\nof all development, whether of mind or soul. Without the power of\r\nassociation, the intellect would strive in vain to construct consecutive\r\ntrains of thought; it would indeed be condemned to eternal infancy,\r\nbecause, as it ascertained new relations, those already acquired would\r\nescape, and a labor constantly renewed would be requisite to regain\r\nthem. Without association of ideas, no voluntary virtue would be\r\npossible; and at the end of long years of effort and self-restraint, we\r\nwould have gained no additional control over the course of our impetuous\r\npassions.\r\n\r\nThe fact that much of the difference in intellectual capacity so\r\nstrongly characterizing different individuals arises from their various\r\npowers over the flow and logical association of ideas, has scarcely\r\nelicited the attention it so well deserves. It is of immense importance\r\nin the history of mental development. If an individual connects his\r\nideas with difficulty, or can continue to chain them in rational\r\nsequence only with the most laborious efforts, he will have either a\r\ndull and heavy, or flighty and illogical, mind.\r\n\r\nIf another has great trouble in modifying or arranging the association\r\nof ideas which arise spontaneously in the soul, he will suffer himself\r\nto be ruled by them, in place of exercising rational domination over\r\nthem; he will pursue every chimera; he will trust every impulse; he will\r\nbut dream, even when he tries to think; and will be of a weak and\r\nfickle, but obstinate and self-opinionated, intellect. His whole\r\nexhaustive logic will consist in clothing in exact and reiterated\r\nassertions the heterogeneous order in which ideas are arbitrarily,\r\naccidentally, and spontaneously associated in his own imagination.\r\n\r\nAnother will associate his ideas in logical sequence, yet with startling\r\nrapidity; in a manner and through subtle relations quite unknown to\r\ncommon men, incapable of such vivid, rational, and consequential\r\ncombinations; and will, in consequence, be a man of clear and vivid\r\nintellect.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful faculty of improvisation so often seen in Italy, is an\r\nexample of the power of appropriate and rapid association. There is no\r\ndoubt that this power is susceptible of development and cultivation, and\r\nthat much that is brilliant in intuition is lost through the want of it.\r\nIn spite of this, no system has as yet been devised for its culture. Let\r\nhim who would labor for the real improvement of humanity think of it,\r\nwrite for it, and aid us in its development: as the law of _internal\r\nunity_ with regard to the immense range of possible associations is so\r\nvital to our moral well being, so essential to our intellectual sanity,\r\nlet our deepest thinkers devote themselves to its culture in the race!\r\n\r\nWe may distinctly trace the intuitive strivings of the human spirit for\r\n_unity_ even in the theology of nations without revelation. In one of\r\nthe ancient fragments of Greek poetry known as Orphic Hymns, we find\r\nthem thus articulated:\r\n\r\n     'Jupiter is the First and Last; Jupiter is man and immortal\r\n     Virgin; Jupiter is the base of Earth and Heaven; Jupiter is the\r\n     living breath of all beings; Jupiter is the source of Fire; the\r\n     root of the Sea; Jupiter is the Sun and Moon; Jupiter is King\r\n     of the universe; He created all things; He is a Living Force; a\r\n     God; the Heart of all that is;--a supernal Body which embraces\r\n     all bodies, fire, water, earth, air, night, day, with Metis the\r\n     first Generatrix, and Love, full of magic. All that is, is\r\n     contained in the immense Body of Jupiter.'\r\n\r\nThe reader will not fail to observe how much this Greek hymn resembles\r\nin its spirit the extract we have already given him from the Vedas; how\r\nclosely it coincides with the transcendental philosophy of the Hindoos.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of God, vague and indeterminate apart from revelation, soon\r\nlost its _pantheistic_ unity in the wildest _polytheistic_ variety. The\r\nprimitive idea of unity, passing through the distorting prism of the\r\nfallen and corrupt human imagination, was divided, decomposed, clothed\r\nin a thousand colors and forms to allure and satisfy the senses. Thus\r\nthere was no part of nature without its appropriate god, invested with\r\nsupreme power over the class of being subjected to its care. No one had\r\never seen any one of these gods, but the people had no doubt of their\r\nexistence. Names in close accordance with their separate functions were\r\ngiven them; these names became symbols destined to represent the\r\ndifferent active principles of the physical world.\r\n\r\nThus in their literary and sacred language they substituted the names of\r\nJupiter, Hyades, Hamadryads, Apollo, for those of Air, Fountains,\r\nForests, and Sun. Nature almost disappeared under this traditionary\r\nlanguage, which, giving play to the lighter fancy, chilled the\r\nimagination, and singularly limited the view. Indeed, it so amused and\r\nallured the fancy by its diversity that the mind scarcely cared to rise\r\nfrom this fantastic and grotesque world to seek the sublime principles\r\nof Infinity, of Unity. If the ancients had regarded nature as a vast\r\nsystem of signs designed to manifest the ideas of the Great Artist; if\r\nthey had at all understood the marvellous Unity of the Divine Works, it\r\nwould have been worse than idle in them to have invented a language\r\nwhich thus lowered nature, robbing it of its solemn majesty, its august\r\ndignity. As all these divinities had the human figure, God was banished\r\nfrom His own universe, man everywhere substituting his own personality.\r\nSpeaking of the great dearth of vivid descriptions of natural scenery\r\namong the ancients, Chateaubriand says: 'It must not be supposed that\r\nmen as full of sensibility as the ancients wanted eyes to see nature, or\r\ntalent to depict it, if some powerful cause had not blinded and misled\r\nthem; this cause was their mythology, which, peopling the universe with\r\ngraceful phantoms, robbed creation of its solemnity, of its sublime\r\nrepose. Christianity came--and fauns, satyrs, and wanton nymphs\r\ndisappeared; the grottos regained their holy silence; the dim woods\r\ntheir mystic reveries; the vast forests their vague and sublime\r\nmelancholy; the streams overturned their petty urns to drink only from\r\nthe mountain tops, to pour forth only the waters of the abyss. The true\r\nand One God, in reappearing in His own mystical works, again breathed\r\nthrough the voice of nature the secret thrill of His perfect Unity, His\r\nincomprehensible Infinity.'\r\n\r\n    'Earth outgrows the mythic fancies\r\n       Sung beside her in her youth;\r\n     And those debonaire romances\r\n       Sound but dull beside the truth.\r\n    Phoebus' chariot race is run!\r\n    Look up, poets, to the Sun!\r\n                     Pan, Pan is dead.\r\n\r\n    'Christ hath sent us down the angels;\r\n       And the whole earth and the skies\r\n     Are illumed by altar candles\r\n       Lit for blessed mysteries;\r\n     And a Priest's hand through creation\r\n     Waveth calm and consecration--\r\n                     And Pan is dead.\r\n\r\n    'O brave Poets, keep back nothing;\r\n       Mix not falsehood with the whole!\r\n     Look up Godward! speak the truth in\r\n       Worthy song from earnest soul!\r\n     Hold, in high poetic duty,\r\n     Truest truth, the fairest Beauty!\r\n                     Pan, Pan is dead.'\r\n\r\nAs we have already intimated, Pantheism is the negation of the Divine\r\nPersonality in order to arrive at Unity; Polytheism is the negation of\r\nthe Divine Unity, which is fractioned and divided that its multitudinous\r\naction may be conceived. The light fancy was delighted with such\r\ndivisions, resulting in varied gods and goddesses; but the soul could\r\nfind no satisfaction for its deeper needs in such conceptions; urged on\r\nby its secret instincts, it sought to recompose the broken unity of the\r\ndivine nature.\r\n\r\nAll government requires a Head; and when an attempt was made to apply\r\nthe heterogeneous qualities and contradictory powers of the gods to the\r\nregulation of society--when it was necessary to find in an Olympus\r\nfilled with quarrels and scandals, a steady Power capable of directing\r\nthe destinies of a great people toward a single aim--men were again\r\nforced to recompose the fractioned Unity, to form an idea of one God\r\nsuperior to those with whom they had peopled earth and heaven. They\r\nwere thus forced upon the conception of a Being superior to Jupiter, who\r\nsubjected all the gods to his inflexible laws; and giving wings to those\r\ninstincts of dread always present in the soul of a fallen race, they\r\ninvented an invisible Divinity who never manifested himself to men; who\r\ndwelt in inaccessible and dreadful regions, in which an inscrutable\r\nHorror forever reigned; and through this new Terror, Unity was again\r\nbrought into the design of creation, for all beings were, in despite of\r\nthemselves, forced to fulfil the decrees of its pitiless will. All\r\nstruggle was vain, all effort useless, prayer was without avail, and\r\nhuman anguish utterly unheeded by this terrific phantom of irresistible\r\nand crushing Power without a heart!\r\n\r\nIt is this dread idea which, pervading the pages of Eschylus, gives them\r\nthat peculiar character of simplicity and grandeur, with which no other\r\ntragedies are marked in a like degree. Such was the source of the\r\ninspiration of classic tragedy, the spring of that stern and severe\r\npoetry which throws the lurid hues of a melancholy so profound upon the\r\npallid and affrighted face of humanity. Man, struggling with all the\r\ngloomy energy of despair against this vague but formidable Horror, which\r\nno virtue or agony could conciliate--this dark Fate, the creation of his\r\nown misled and perverted intuitions--and vainly seeking to escape from\r\nthe inflexible circle which he had traced around himself, is an object\r\nwhich cannot fail to awaken the deepest pity. He asks from his fellow\r\nmen, from nature, from the gods, the meaning of the dire enigma of life.\r\nAlas! they leave him to struggle in the stony hands of an unbending\r\nFate! no reply is ever given to his wild demand, and the 'veil of Isis\r\nis never raised!' The world quivered under some strange anathema; a\r\nmystic malediction wreathed its thorns round the anguished heads of men;\r\neven in the midst of their festivals, when seeming to drink deep of joy\r\nfrom the brimming cup of life, the invisible hand of a Gorgon Fate was\r\nforever felt tracing upon their walls the decrees of a dark,\r\ninscrutable, inflexible, and terrible destiny!\r\n\r\nYet there are poets among us, who would willingly return to the days of\r\nPaganism, and resuscitate the gods of Greece!\r\n\r\n    'Get to dust as common mortals,\r\n      By a common doom and track!\r\n    Let no Schiller from the portals\r\n      Of that Hades call you back,\r\n    Or instruct us all to weep:\r\n    Everlasting be your sleep!\r\n                    Pan, Pan is dead!'\r\n\r\n    ''Twas the hour when one in Zion\r\n      Hung for Love's sake on a cross--\r\n    When His brow was chill with dying,\r\n      And His soul was faint with loss;\r\n    When His priestly blood dropped downward;\r\n    And His kingly eyes looked homeward--\r\n                    Then Pan was dead!'\r\n\r\nThe Prometheus of the rock, the Tantalus of the fable, man, plunged in\r\nthis world of woe with his lips thirsty for happiness, stretches out his\r\nhand to pluck the bitter Dead-Sea fruits of this earth. With his\r\nprofound instincts of the Infinite, his craving for the Absolute, he\r\nseizes madly upon every object which suggests their image to him; the\r\nfoul fiend, adapting his temptations to the nature of the tempted, still\r\nwhispers, as into the ear of the mother of mankind: 'Ye shall be as\r\ngods;'--but the phenomenal flies before him, and he everywhere falls\r\nupon the thorns closely hedging in the narrow circle of the actual.\r\nWithout Faith, the artist is among the most miserable of men, for\r\nthrough the illimitable horizons of the Infinite, genius catches secrets\r\nwhich it can never fully utter; symbolic signs, whose sense it cannot\r\narticulate; while the voice of the invisible Love loads every breeze.\r\nWhat profound and mournful aspirations for that _Unknown_ which the\r\nmortal may not see, surge through the soul of the imaginative!\r\n\r\n    'E'en the flowing azure air\r\n    Thou hast charmed for his despair.'\r\n\r\nWhile the artist strives to incorporate with the works which their\r\npresence shall render immortal, suggestions of Infinity, of Unity, let\r\nhim hopefully turn to the Author of all Beauty for true inspiration and\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAs satisfaction and response to the longings of the spirit, the Gospel\r\nhas brought Life and Immortality to light. The assurance that 'God is\r\nLove' responds to the inmost wish of the soul. The problem of antiquity,\r\nthe possible Union of the finite with the Infinite, has been solved in\r\nthe most marvellous manner. No longer are we oppressed with the loss of\r\nall personal identity, all moral responsibility, as in pantheism; nor\r\nconfused by the debasing fractioning of the Divine Unity, as in\r\npolytheism; nor bound hand and foot under the crushing despotism of a\r\npitiless Fate;--but in the Glorified Humanity of Christ these perplexing\r\nproblems of the soul are answered, and the incomprehensible union of the\r\nInfinite and finite at last accomplished, He took our nature upon Him\r\nthat Infinite Love might pass through all degrees of suffering, even to\r\nthe last dying gasp of agony, to release us from the horrors of the\r\n'second death.' Every human feeling is known to Him, but in infinite\r\npurity; the Real and Ideal are in equal perfection. Far higher, indeed,\r\nthan the most sublime conception that uninspired thought could ever have\r\nengendered; human, yet far above humanity; ruling all ages; winning all\r\nadoration; sublime in tender simplicity--behold the meek Lamb of God,\r\nthe Holy Son of the Blessed Virgin!\r\n\r\nOh, eternal, immaculate Beauty! if in this world Thou but sufferest us\r\nto divine Thy Perfections; if Thou hast given us ephemeral delights\r\nwhich always escape our eager grasp at the very moment we dream of their\r\nfull enjoyment; if the flower fades so fast--the days of spring are so\r\nfleeting; if nature, like a thick veil thrown between this world and the\r\nnext, suffers but a few rays of Thy glory to pierce its folds, while it\r\nkeeps us from Thee even in kindling the flame of desires which it never\r\nsatisfies--it is because Thou knowest that in the inexhaustible richness\r\nof Thy Being there are everlasting fountains to quench the insatiate\r\nthirst of the human soul, when in the bosom of infinite splendor we may\r\ncontemplate and adore Thee forever and ever!\r\n\r\n'That they _all_ may be _One_, as Thou, Father, in me, and I in Thee:\r\nthat they also may be _one_ in us.'\r\n\r\nOh, inconceivable and glorious Unity! What wonder that thy types on\r\nearth are so full of meaning--so rich in delight!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUCCANEERS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nA still more terrible name to the Spaniards, as a leader of the\r\nbuccaneers, was Francis Lolonois, a Frenchman, who in his youth was\r\ntransported as a slave to the Caribbean Islands. Passing thence to\r\nTortuga, he became a common mariner, and conducted himself so well in\r\nseveral voyages as to win the confidence of the governor, M. de la\r\nPlace, who gave him a ship in which to seek his fortune. The beginning\r\nof his career on his own account was favorable; but his cruelties toward\r\nthe Spaniards were such as to make his name terrible throughout the\r\nIndies; and the Spanish mariner preferred death in any form to falling\r\ninto his hands. Fortune, however, being ever inconstant, Lolonois did\r\nnot escape reverses. Encountering a tempest on the coast of Campeachy,\r\nhis ship was wrecked, and himself and crew cast on shore. Scarcely had\r\nhe dried his dripping clothes when he was met by an armed force, and\r\ndefeated in a severe battle. Being wounded, and concealing himself among\r\nthe dead bodies of his companions, he escaped, and arrived at Campeachy\r\nin disguise, in time to take part in the thanksgiving and religious\r\nrejoicings of the Spaniards on account of his supposed death. Here he\r\nsucceeded in enticing some slaves from their masters, with whom he again\r\nput to sea, with the design of ravaging the small town of De los Cayes,\r\non the south side of Cuba. Divining his project, however, some fishermen\r\nconveyed information to the governor at Havana, who immediately\r\ndespatched a vessel of war of ten guns in pursuit, with orders not to\r\nreturn until the pirates were captured, and every man executed except\r\nLolonois himself, who was to be brought to Havana. This vessel entered\r\nthe port of De los Cayes while the pirates were yet at sea; but they\r\nwere advised of every particular of the pursuit, and concerted their\r\nmeasures accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt was on a clear, starlight night, when the Spaniard lay quietly at\r\nanchor in the glassy waters of the bay,\r\n\r\n    'Secure that nought of evil could delight\r\n    To walk in such a scene on such a night,'\r\n\r\nthat the pirates entered the harbor in two canoes. Stealing upon their\r\nintended prey so silently as to escape observation, they boarded her on\r\nboth sides at once, and, after a sharp conflict, succeeded in her\r\ncapture. Lolonois then informed the prisoners that he knew their orders,\r\nand it was his purpose to execute them upon those who were to have\r\nenforced them upon him. Supplications and entreaties were in vain. He\r\nsuccessively struck off the heads of every one with his own\r\nhand--sucking, at each stroke, the drops of blood that trickled from his\r\nsabre. Only one person was saved, whom he sent back to the governor with\r\na letter stating what he had done, and declaring his determination\r\nthenceforward to show no quarter to a Spaniard, adding: 'I have great\r\nhopes I shall execute on your own person the punishment I have upon\r\nthose you sent against me. Thus have I retaliated the kindness you\r\ndesigned to me and my companions.' The governor was much troubled at the\r\nmessage, and declared that no quarter should ever again be granted to a\r\npirate; but knowing who would have the advantage in such a war of\r\nretaliation, the inhabitants induced him to change his determination.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by his success, Lolonois forthwith set about organizing a\r\nforce to make a descent upon the main, with a view of taking Maracaibo\r\nitself. While engaged in these preparations, he formed a connection with\r\nMichael de Basco, who, having retired from the sea, was living upon his\r\ngains. De Basco had served in the wars of Europe as an officer with\r\ndistinguished gallantry; and he now engaged with Lolonois as the land\r\ncommander. When the expedition sailed, it consisted of eight vessels and\r\nsix hundred men. On their passage they fell in with a Spanish armed ship\r\nfrom Porto Rico for New Spain. Lolonois parted from the fleet and\r\ninsisted on engaging the Spaniard alone. He did so, and carried the ship\r\nafter an engagement of three hours. She mounted sixteen guns, carried a\r\ncrew of sixty men, and was, moreover, richly laden with specie, jewels,\r\nand merchandise. Shortly after another vessel was taken, when on her\r\nvoyage to Hispaniola to pay the troops. This was a valuable capture, the\r\nprize being laden with arms and ammunition as well as specie. The prize\r\nvessels were sent into Tortuga, where they were unladen; and one of them\r\nwas immediately armed and sent back to join the main squadron as the\r\nflagship. Their marine thus augmented, they sailed first into the Bay of\r\nVenerada, the fort guarding the entrance to which was taken, the guns\r\nspiked, and the garrison, numbering two hundred and fifty men, put to\r\nthe sword. The pirates next sailed into the Lake of Maracaibo, landed\r\ntheir forces, and proceeded at once to attack the castle that guarded\r\nthe entrance to the harbor. The governor had made judicious dispositions\r\nfor its defence, having formed an ambuscade for the purpose of bringing\r\nthe pirates between two fires. His design, however, in this respect, was\r\nfrustrated, for those forming the ambuscade, being discovered and\r\nrouted, fled to the town, the inhabitants of which, remembering the\r\nformer visitation of the pirates, deserted in wild consternation, and\r\nfell back upon Gibraltar, thirty leagues distant. Meantime the pirates,\r\nthough armed with swords and pistols only, attacked the castle with such\r\nimpetuosity as to compel its capitulation. The slaughter was great.\r\nAfter the surrender the guns were spiked, and the castle demolished. The\r\nnext day the invaders advanced upon the town, which they found desolate.\r\nIt was well stored with provisions, but all the valuables had been\r\nremoved or buried. Lolonois demanded information of the prisoners where\r\nthe plate, jewels, and money were concealed, and attempts were made to\r\nextort confessions by the rack, but to little purpose. He then hacked\r\none of the prisoners to pieces with his sword, declaring that such\r\nshould be the fate of all, unless the hidden treasures of the town\r\nshould be forthcoming. But the poor wretches were unable to give the\r\ninformation, as the owners had fled as best they could, changing their\r\nown hiding places, and taking away their valuables. Having remained\r\nfifteen days in Maracaibo, and supposing that the people had carried\r\ntheir treasures with them to Gibraltar, Lolonois determined to sail to\r\nthat town. The deputy governor, however, without the knowledge of the\r\npirates, had made vigorous preparations for its defence; and\r\naccordingly, on their arrival in sight of the town, they unexpectedly\r\ndiscovered the royal standard floating from two strong batteries\r\nguarding a very narrow channel through which the pirate squadron must\r\npass. A council of war was called, at which, after a spirited speech\r\nfrom Lolonois, it was agreed to land and carry the works by storm--the\r\nleader declaring that he would pistol any man who should flinch, with\r\nhis own hand. The Spanish forces numbered eight hundred men, well\r\nappointed; but nothing could daunt the resolution of the pirates. The\r\nSpaniards conducted themselves bravely; and not until five hundred of\r\ntheir number had fallen did they yield. The buccaneers had eighty killed\r\nand wounded, not one of the latter recovering--an evidence of the\r\ndesperation with which they fought. The town of Gibraltar, of course,\r\nfell into their hands; but it was a bootless conquest, inasmuch as\r\nduring the time the pirates had wasted at Maracaibo, the people had\r\nsecured their treasure by carrying it away. To save the town from the\r\ntorch, however, the inhabitants paid a ransom of ten thousand pieces of\r\neight, yet not until a portion of it had been burned. After spending two\r\nmonths on shore, the buccaneers reëmbarked, carrying away all the\r\ncrosses, pictures, and bells of the churches, for the purpose, as they\r\nalleged, of erecting a chapel in the island of Tortuga, to which pious\r\nobject a portion of the spoils was to be consecrated! The amount of\r\ntheir booty, during their expedition, was two hundred and sixty thousand\r\npieces of eight, together with vast quantities of plate, jewels, and\r\nmerchandise--most of which was soon dissipated, after their return, in\r\ndebauchery, and other rude pleasures of such a ruffian race.\r\n\r\nThe next exploit of Lolonois was the capture, in the mouth of the\r\nGuatemala river, of a Spanish ship, carrying forty-two guns, and manned\r\nby one hundred and thirty fighting men; the pirate carrying only\r\ntwenty-two guns, and being attended by a single small vessel. The\r\nSpaniard made a good defence, and the pirate chief was at first\r\nrepulsed. Yet afterward, under cover of a thick mist, rendered more\r\ndense by the smoke of the powder, the pirates boarded the Spaniard from\r\ntheir small craft, and bravely accomplished their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe career of this desperado was soon to come to an end. Shortly after\r\nthis last exploit, while cruising in the Bay of Honduras, his own ship\r\nwas wrecked, and he, together with his crew, were thrown upon an island.\r\nTheir next business was to build a boat from the remains of the broken\r\nship--a work which occupied them six months, and when finished she would\r\ncarry but half their number--the other half remaining behind by lot.\r\nLolonois then directed his course for Carthagena; but venturing ashore\r\nat Darien, he was made prisoner by a wild tribe of Indians, who became\r\nthe instruments of divine justice in avenging his many cruelties. They\r\nwere not ignorant of his character, and, believing that no trace or\r\nmemorial of such a wretch ought to remain upon earth, they tore him in\r\npieces alive, throwing his body limb by limb into the fire, and\r\nafterward scattering his ashes to the winds. Fitting death for such a\r\nhorrible monster!\r\n\r\nBut the career of the most formidable chief in this bloody catalogue\r\nremains yet to be described. It was that of Henry Morgan, whose very\r\nname, as it has been justly remarked, 'spread such terror abroad, that\r\nwith it the old women frightened their children asleep, and then lay\r\nawake themselves through fear.' Morgan was the son of a wealthy farmer\r\nin Wales, but not satisfied with his secluded condition, he sought a\r\nseaport, and sailed for Barbadoes, where he was sold for a term of years\r\nfor his passage. The term of his service having expired, he repaired to\r\nJamaica, where the temptations spread before him by the buccaneers of\r\nrapidly arriving at wealth and fame, induced him to join their\r\ncommunity. In the course of several voyages, which were attended with\r\ngreat success, he evinced so much intrepidity, skill, prudence, and\r\njudgment, as to win the confidence of his companions, several of whom\r\nproposed the purchase of a ship on joint account, the command of which\r\nwas conferred on him. About this time, also, Morgan became acquainted\r\nwith Mausvelt, an old pirate, and who had now on foot an expedition\r\ndestined for a descent upon the Spanish main. Mausvelt induced Morgan to\r\njoin him as his vice-admiral, and they were shortly at sea with a fleet\r\nof fifteen sail, great and small, and five hundred men, chiefly French\r\nand Maroons. Their course was first directed against the two small\r\nislands, nearly contiguous, of St. Catharine's, on the coast of Costa\r\nRica. These, though strongly fortified, were easily taken, by reason of\r\nthe inefficiency both of the commander and his troops, superinduced by\r\nthe terror inspired by the very name of the pirates. The design of\r\nMausvelt in the acquisition of these islands, was to fortify and hold\r\nthem as a place of rendezvous. Leaving, therefore, a garrison of one\r\nhundred men in the forts, Mausvelt and Morgan continued their course to\r\nthe main; but as a knowledge of their intentions had preceded them, such\r\npreparations had been made by the Spaniards on the coast for their\r\nreception, as induced them to return to St. Catharine's. Thence they\r\nsailed back to Jamaica for recruits; but not being favored by the\r\ngovernor, Mausvelt repaired to Tortuga, where he died. The command now\r\ndevolved upon Morgan, who endeavored to prosecute the designs of his\r\npredecessor; but the Spaniards having regained possession of St.\r\nCatharine's, his projects were for a time defeated. Not only had the\r\nSpaniards recovered the island, but a large English ship, despatched\r\nthither from Jamaica for the aid of the buccaneers, and well supplied\r\nwith arms, men, provisions, and women, also fell into their hands. This\r\nwas a severe disappointment to Morgan, who had made extensive\r\narrangements for preserving St. Catharine's as a storehouse and place of\r\nrefuge, and had opened a correspondence with Virginia and New England\r\nupon the subject. These events took place in 1665.\r\n\r\nBut, far from relinquishing the profession he had chosen, Morgan had\r\nonly just entered upon it. He soon succeeded in organizing another fleet\r\nof nine sail of different-sized vessels, manned by four hundred and\r\nfifty men. With these he made sail for Porto Bello, the third strongest\r\npost at that time in the American dominions of Spain. In order to secure\r\nsecrecy, Morgan had communicated his purpose to no living soul, until he\r\ncame almost in view of the town. Some of his bold spirits then faltered\r\nfor a moment; but he had the power to dissipate their doubts of success,\r\neven against odds so great. Landing his forces in the night, Morgan\r\narrived at the very citadel before he was discovered, having taken\r\ncaptive the sentinel so suddenly as to prevent the least alarm. The\r\ncastle was summoned to surrender on pain of putting every man found\r\ntherein to death. The summons being disregarded, the assault was begun,\r\nand bravely repelled for a time; but the fortress was at length\r\ncompelled to yield to the impetuous assaults of the pirates. But there\r\nwere yet other castles, and one of the strongest, to be subdued. With\r\nthis latter Morgan was hotly engaged from daylight until noon--losing\r\nmany of his men, and at times almost despairing himself of success. At\r\nlength another of the lesser castles gave way, and Morgan was encouraged\r\nand strengthened by the return of the detachment that had been engaged\r\nagainst it. As a device, moreover, to compel the Spanish governor to\r\nyield the principal castle, the pirate chief caused its walls to be\r\nplanted round with scaling ladders, upon which, in front of his own men,\r\nthe religious prisoners in his hands, priests and nuns, were forced to\r\nascend. But although these people called to the governor in the name of\r\nall their saints to yield and save their lives, his determination was\r\ninflexible. He declared he would yield only with his life, and that the\r\ncastle should be defended to the last. Night approached, and the contest\r\nyet raged; but finally, after performing prodigies of valor, the\r\nassailants succeeded in scaling the walls, and the castle was entered\r\nsword in hand. The garrison thereupon submitted, all but the governor,\r\nwho, deaf to the entreaties of his wife and daughter, fought on, killing\r\nseveral of the pirates with his own hand, and also some of his own\r\nsoldiers for surrendering, until he was himself killed. The entire town\r\nwas now in possession of the rapacious invaders; and all the treasures\r\nof the churches, having been placed in the castles for safety, of course\r\nfell into the hands of the victors, as also did a vast amount of money\r\nand plate.\r\n\r\nAmazed that a town so strongly fortified as Porto Bello, and so well\r\ngarrisoned, should have been captured by so small a force, the president\r\nof Panama sent a message to Morgan, desiring a pattern of the arms by\r\nwhich he had performed so desperate an exploit. Morgan treated the\r\nmessenger with courtesy, and returned to the president a pistol and\r\nseveral bullets, as a slender pattern of the arms he had used,\r\nrequesting his Excellency to preserve them carefully for a twelvemonth,\r\nwhen he promised to come to Panama and bring them away. The president,\r\nhowever, sent the articles back again, to save the pirate chief the\r\ntrouble of coming after them. He also sent him as a gift a gold ring,\r\nwith a civil request that he would not trouble himself to come to Panama\r\nat the time mentioned, since he would not be likely to fare so well as\r\nhe had at Porto Bello. Morgan, after having destroyed the military walls\r\nat Porto Bello, reëmbarked with his numbers greatly diminished by\r\nbattle, debauchery, and disease, and returned to Jamaica.\r\n\r\nThe fame of exploits like these caused the name of Morgan to resound\r\nthroughout Europe; and large numbers of the English chivalry, men of\r\nfamily and rank, hastened to the New World, either to mend dilapidated\r\nfortunes, or to acquire new ones, and to participate in the unlawful\r\nglory which even the darkness of the deeds by which it was won could not\r\neclipse. These recruits attached themselves to Morgan, and eagerly\r\naccepted commands under him. The bold rover gave them commissions in the\r\nname of the king of England, authorizing them to commit hostilities\r\nagainst the Spaniards, whom he declared to be the enemies of the British\r\ncrown. To such an amazing extent did the buccaneering system increase,\r\nthat more than four thousand men were now engaged in it, two thousand of\r\nwhom were under Morgan, with a fleet of thirty-seven vessels, divided\r\ninto squadrons, and appointed with all the formality of an independent\r\nsovereignty. Their place of rendezvous was between Tortuga and St.\r\nDomingo, the coast of the latter being plundered for provisions. A\r\nsquadron of four sail was also sent to the region of the Rio de la Hacha\r\nupon the same errand, where a large ship was captured, the coast\r\nsuccessfully ravaged, and many prisoners put to death, as in former\r\ninstances, by the most exquisite tortures.\r\n\r\nAll things being in readiness, the expedition sailed in December, 1670,\r\nthe ultimate destination of which was to pay the promised visit to the\r\ngovernor of Panama--the richest city of Spanish America. Preliminary,\r\nhowever, to their landing upon the isthmus, a detachment of the fleet\r\nwas sent against a fortress at the mouth of the Chagu--which river it\r\nwas necessary to ascend before disembarking for Panama. This fortress\r\nwas built upon a steep rock, against which the waves of the sea were\r\ncontinually breaking, and was defended by an officer of distinguished\r\nability and courage, and by a garrison in all respects worthy of such a\r\ncommander. For a time the contest was doubtful, but the fates favored\r\nthe freebooters. The Spanish commander was slain, and, the fort taking\r\nfire, the position fell into the hands of the besiegers. The manner in\r\nwhich the fire was communicated to the fortress was very remarkable.\r\nDuring the fight, an arrow from the bow of one of the garrison was\r\nlodged in the eye of one of the pirates, standing near his chief.\r\nExtracting the barbed shaft from his head with his own hand, and binding\r\nsome cotton around the missile, he set it on fire, and shot it back into\r\nthe fortress from the barrel of his gun. The burning arrow fell upon the\r\nroof of a house thatched with palm leaves, which were dry, and a\r\nconflagration ensued, which the garrison strove in vain to resist. But\r\nfor this untoward occurrence, it was believed that Brodley, the pirate\r\nvice-admiral, would have been repulsed.\r\n\r\nBrodley was now joined by the main fleet under Morgan himself; and the\r\nvessels, having been brought to anchor, were left with a sufficient\r\nguard, while the commander, with twelve hundred men, embarked in boats\r\nand canoes, and commenced the ascent of the river toward the capital,\r\nthe sacking of which was to be the crowning act of his career of outrage\r\nand blood. They were compelled soon to leave their boats; and their\r\nmarch for nine days was one of the severest operations ever successfully\r\nencountered by man. The country was desolate, villages and plantations\r\nbeing alike deserted, and in the flight of the people nothing had been\r\nleft behind that could possibly be converted into food, or in any wise\r\nminister to the cupidity of the invaders. The hardships they underwent\r\nin climbing mountains almost inaccessible, and traversing morasses\r\nnearly impassable, while in a state bordering upon starvation, exceed\r\nthe power of language to describe. The carcass of an ass found by the\r\nway afforded an uncooked tempting meal; and such cats and dogs as did\r\nnot flee with their owners, were considered delicious morsels.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day a narrow defile was feebly defended by a company of\r\nIndians, by whom ten of the pirates were killed, and fourteen others\r\nwounded. On the ninth, having gained the summit of a lofty mountain, to\r\ntheir infinite delight they came in view of the great Southern ocean,\r\nand saw beneath them the glittering spires of Panama, and the shipping\r\nin the harbor. The despondency which had been brooding over them for\r\nseveral days, was now lighted up by the most extravagant demonstrations\r\nof joy. They leaped, and sang, and threw up their hats, and blew their\r\ntrumpets, and beat their arms, as though the prize were already their\r\nown without a struggle. Seemingly refreshed in strength by the sight of\r\nthe object of their desires, the pirates rushed eagerly forward, and\r\nbefore nightfall encamped upon the great plain on which stood the city,\r\ndispersing with ease several strong reconnoitring parties who had thrown\r\nthemselves in their way. The Spaniards had evidently been preparing for\r\ntheir reception, and they played their artillery upon the invaders all\r\nnight, but with little effect; the pirates sleeping on the grass with\r\ngreat composure, anxious for the arrival of the day which was to reward\r\ntheir sufferings with untold riches.\r\n\r\nThe invaders were early on foot on the morning of the tenth day, and in\r\nfull march for the city. Arriving upon the summit of a little hill, they\r\nwere brought to a pause by a force which they saw advancing to meet\r\nthem. Their own numbers had been reduced on the march to less than a\r\nthousand effective men; and they now beheld an army consisting of two\r\nsquadrons of horse, and four regiments of foot, led by the governor in\r\nperson, and preceded by a large herd of wild bulls, the design of which\r\nsingular description of light troops was to throw the buccaneers into\r\nconfusion. Beyond these, in immediate proximity to the city, they\r\ndiscovered the people of Panama in arms, in yet greater numbers. The\r\naction with the advanced army, under the governor, soon commenced, the\r\nwild cattle being of no avail against the pirates, who shot them all\r\ndown in a very brief space of time. But the Spaniards, especially the\r\ncavalry, fought bravely for more than two hours. The horse having at\r\nlength been compelled to yield, the infantry fled, after a brief\r\nresistance. Six hundred Spaniards lay dead upon the field, and the\r\nbuccaneers suffered so severely that they were forced to desist from an\r\nimmediate pursuit, and obtain some rest. From a prisoner they\r\nascertained that the city was defended by two thousand five hundred men,\r\nwith a large number of heavy guns, planted at different points. But the\r\nbuccaneers, though sadly diminished in numbers, were determined to\r\nfinish the work they had begun on the same day; and taking an oath that\r\nthey would stand by each other to the last, they again advanced, and a\r\nsecond fierce and bloody encounter took place at the very gates of the\r\ncity, which, after a resistance of three hours, fell into the hands of\r\nthe buccaneers. Neither party gave or received quarter, and after the\r\nconquest the pirates killed nearly all who fell into their hands,\r\nsparing neither ecclesiastics nor women.\r\n\r\nThe city was at that time one of remarkable splendor, containing two\r\nthousand houses of great magnificence. The private dwellings were\r\nchiefly built of cedar, and embellished with hangings, paintings, and\r\neverything that luxury and taste could supply. It was the see of a\r\nbishop, with two large churches, and seven monasteries, all richly\r\nadorned with altar pieces, paintings, gold, silver, and precious stones.\r\nBut the gorgeous palaces and solemn temples were doomed to the flames by\r\nthe order of Morgan himself, although he afterward endeavored to fix the\r\nact of vandalism upon others. They were probably burned in revenge\r\nbecause found empty, for many of the inhabitants had sought refuge in\r\nflight, carrying away such of their valuables as they could. Still, by\r\nthe horrible processes of torture, immense discoveries were made of\r\ntreasures concealed in the wells and caves, and in the woods. Some\r\nvaluable freights were taken from boats in the harbor, which had been\r\nleft aground at low water; and rich deposits were frequently discovered\r\nin the earth, under the excruciating tortures of the rack.\r\n\r\nMorgan lingered at Panama for a considerable period, until, indeed, his\r\nmen began to murmur at their protracted inactivity. The cause of this\r\ninaction will hardly be divined from the character thus far developed of\r\nthis stupendous freebooter; but it was the tender passion! He had among\r\nhis prisoners a beautiful Spanish lady, who attracted his particular\r\nattention. She was a native of Spain, and the wife of an opulent\r\nmerchant, whose business had some time before called him to Peru.\r\nAccording to the historians of that day, she was still in the bloom of\r\nyouth; 'Her cheeks, naturally ruddy, were heightened by a tropical sun\r\ninto a warmer glow; and her fine black eyes, dazzling with uncommon\r\nlustre, gave animation to the noblest countenance that ever the hand of\r\nnature delineated, or poet's fancy conceived. The interest which her\r\nunhappy situation excited was heightened into admiration by her elevated\r\nmien; and her whole deportment indicated a soul incapable of being\r\ndegraded from its native rank, by any reverse of condition, or any depth\r\nof misery.' Morgan, rude as he was, and unused to the melting mood, was\r\nnevertheless charmed with her conversation, and the admiration which he\r\nfelt for her bearing was ere long changed into yet more tender emotions.\r\nHe provided a house for her, and assigned to her service a retinue of\r\ndomestics. Shortly afterward he attempted to open such a correspondence\r\nwith her as might favor his desires, but failing in this, he proceeded\r\nto usurp some freedoms, at which her delicacy revolted. Her rebuke, firm\r\nand noble, drove him back abashed; but his impetuous temper could not\r\nwell brook disappointment, and in the ardor of his passion he\r\nsubsequently attempted to force her into compliance with his brutal\r\ndesires. But with a virtue as exalted as that of the Roman matron, who\r\nresisted, but in vain, the advances of the son of Tarquin, and with a\r\nyet higher courage, she sprang from his attempted embrace, exclaiming,\r\n'Stop! Thinkest thou, then, that thou canst ravish mine honor from me,\r\nas thou hast wrested from me my fortune and my liberty? Be assured that\r\nI can die and be avenged!' Having said this, she drew from her bosom a\r\nponiard, which she would have plunged into his breast, had he not\r\navoided the blow. From that moment she became an object not only of his\r\nhate, but of his cruelty, until at length she was ransomed by some of\r\nher friends. History has not preserved the name of this lofty specimen\r\nof female purity and honor; but, like that of Lucretia, it deserves the\r\ntopmost niche in the temple of virtue.\r\n\r\nAt length, in the month of February, Morgan took his departure from\r\nPanama, having one hundred and seventy-five beasts of burden laden with\r\nsilver and gold, jewelry, and other precious things. He also took with\r\nhim six hundred prisoners, men, women, and children, for the purpose of\r\nextorting enormous ransoms for them by the way; the cries of the women\r\nand children were pitiful to hear; but the freebooter's heart was\r\nsteeled against every humane emotion. Returning down the river Chagre,\r\nhe destroyed the castle at its entrance, and prepared to reëmbark for\r\nJamaica. Before going on board, however, a division of the plunder was\r\nmade, which gave great dissatisfaction. It seemed unaccountable to his\r\nmen that so large an apparent amount of booty should yield only about\r\ntwo hundred pieces of eight _per capita_, and rumors of foul play were\r\nrife. Meantime he had richly laden his own ship with merchandise; and in\r\nthe course of the following night, while his companions were in a deep\r\nsleep, he put to sea and escaped to Jamaica, and thence to England. Such\r\nan instance of treachery had never been before known among the\r\nbuccaneers, and the rage and resentment that ensued cannot be described.\r\nHis departure was the signal for the dispersion of the fleet. The French\r\nreturned to Tortuga. Some of the English attempted to overtake the\r\nmighty robber and make him disgorge, but were unsuccessful. Others of\r\nthe crews dispersed with their vessels to seek their fortunes as best\r\nthey might. Morgan ultimately returned to England laden with wealth, and\r\nwas well received. He afterward became a commander in the naval service\r\nof his country, and obtained the honor of knighthood from William III.\r\n\r\nThe capture of Panama, however, was the last great land expedition\r\nsuccessfully undertaken by the buccaneers. A few other land expeditions,\r\nit is true, were begun by chiefs of lesser note; but the indifferent\r\nsuccess which attended these, induced the freebooters insensibly to\r\nconfine their operations more exclusively to the water, and there was no\r\nsea left untraversed by them, from the Atlantic to the Indian ocean. The\r\ncommerce of almost all nations was annoyed by them, although their\r\ndepredations continued more particularly to be directed against the\r\nfirst objects of their hate, the Spaniards. It is a curious fact,\r\nillustrating the corruption of the Roman Catholic Church at that time,\r\nthat in one of the Spanish ships captured while on her way to South\r\nAmerica, by an Englishman named White, there were found no less than two\r\nmillions of Papal bulls, granting indulgences to the Spaniards of the\r\nNew World! These were a royal trade, and had been purchased by the king\r\nof Spain for three hundred thousand florins, _prime cost_, and by him\r\nwere designed to be retailed for five millions. Thus, by their capture,\r\nhis Catholic Majesty lost the benefit of a fine speculation. Had these\r\nindulgences been captured by Yankees, they would have contrived to\r\nbarter them away at a profit; or had the captors been good Catholics,\r\nthey might have ravaged the whole continent with very quiet consciences,\r\nhaving the Pope's pardon already in their pockets.[B]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact, not, I believe, very extensively understood, that\r\nthe great English circumnavigator Dampier was for a considerable period\r\nconnected with the buccaneers after the flight of Morgan. Dampier found\r\nhimself among them at first by accident, having gone ashore on the\r\nSpanish main in great distress to procure provisions. Falling in with a\r\nparty of the marauders, he was induced to join them. He was at the\r\ntaking of Porto Bello; and afterward crossed the Isthmus of Darien with\r\nSawkins, Sharp, and others. Sawkins, the commander, was killed in an\r\nattack on Puebla Nova in 1679. Dampier, in his 'Voyages,' gives an\r\ninteresting account of their subsequent course along the coasts, and\r\namong the islands of the Pacific, which was rather disastrous. A mutiny,\r\nhowever, occurring among those of the buccaneers engaged in the\r\nexpedition, Dampier returned across the Isthmus and came to Virginia in\r\nJuly, 1682, where, after he and his companions had dissipated all their\r\nwealth, they fitted out another piratical expedition for the South seas,\r\ndoubling Cape Horn in the spring of 1684. Proceeding northward to\r\nPanama, Dampier's party were joined by large numbers of buccaneers who\r\nhad just crossed the Isthmus; and obtaining a number of additional\r\nvessels, they prepared to intercept the Plate fleet on its departure\r\nfrom Lima for Spain. After a few successes, and several disasters,\r\nDampier and his companions sailed to the Philippine Islands in 1686; and\r\nsubsequently visited most of the islands in the Pacific, sometimes\r\nrioting in luxury, and at others brought to the verge of starvation.\r\nDampier quitted the buccaneers at the island of Nicoba, in the spring of\r\n1688. Subsequently, however, he again joined them, as the commander of a\r\nfine vessel; but the treachery of his officers and crew defeated the\r\nobjects of the cruise. Returning from this bootless voyage, he was\r\npresented to Queen Anne, and well received. He subsequently made a\r\nfourth voyage to the Pacific, during which he discovered and took from\r\nthe island of Juan Fernandez the celebrated Alexander Selkirk, the hero\r\nof De Foe's Robinson Crusoe--a story ever delightful and ever new to\r\nreaders old and young. The actual experience of Selkirk, as related by\r\nDampier, corresponds more closely with the narrative, probably, than has\r\ngenerally been supposed.\r\n\r\nThe last great enterprise of this remarkable race of men was directed\r\nagainst Carthagena in 1697. It was planned in France, from one of the\r\nports of which a squadron of twelve vessels sailed, under the command of\r\nPointis. It was joined by twelve hundred buccaneers in the West Indies;\r\nand although Carthagena was then the strongest city in the New World,\r\nits forts and castles were carried by storm in rapid succession. The\r\nbooty thus acquired by Pointis amounted to one million seven hundred and\r\nfifty thousand pounds sterling, with which he embarked and made sail.\r\nBut they had not been long at sea before the buccaneers discovered that\r\ntheir rapacious commander was meditating how he should deprive them of\r\ntheir share of the plunder. Exasperated at this treatment, they at first\r\ndetermined to put him to death. This purpose, however, was diverted by a\r\nsuggestion to return to Carthagena and demand a heavy ransom to save the\r\ncity from destruction, that they might fill their pockets in that way.\r\nThis project was carried into execution. Entering the city without\r\nresistance, the men were confined in the great church, and a ransom\r\ndemanded of more than two hundred and eighteen thousand pounds sterling.\r\nA venerable priest ascended the pulpit, and by his eloquent address\r\npersuaded the people to comply with the demand, by surrendering all\r\ntheir remaining money and jewels. But the amount fell short of the\r\ndemand, and the city was sacked a second time. Having amassed all the\r\nwealth they could find, the adventurers once more put to sea. But they\r\ndid not long enjoy their ill-gotten riches. Meeting with a fleet of\r\nships belonging to England and Holland, both of which nations were then\r\nin alliance with Spain, an engagement ensued, in which several of the\r\npirates were taken and sunk, and among them were lost the treasure\r\nships, so that the booty went to the bottom of the sea. This was the\r\nlast memorable event in the history of the buccaneers of America,\r\nalthough a lower order of piracy prevailed, both in the Atlantic and\r\nPacific oceans, for many years afterward.\r\n\r\nThere had been for the most part a separation between the English and\r\nFrench buccaneers on the revolution of 1688, which brought William and\r\nMary to the throne of England, and terminated the friendly relations\r\nbetween that nation and the Gauls. By the peace of Ryswick, moreover, in\r\n1697, peace was restored between France and Spain, and it then became\r\nthe interest as well as the policy of Europe to put an end to the\r\nassociated existence of the most extraordinary combination of men who\r\never trod the earth. History affords no parallel to the buccaneers.\r\n'Without any regular system, without laws, without any degree of\r\nsubordination, and even without any fixed revenue, they became the\r\nastonishment of the age in which they lived, as they will be of\r\nposterity.' In their actions is to be found a mixture of the most\r\nopposite feelings and principles. They were at once undauntedly brave,\r\nand cowardly brutal; full of justice and honor to each other, and yet a\r\nlawless banditti. As an evidence of their feelings of honor,\r\nit is related that on a certain occasion a company of their\r\nfraternity--'Brothers of the Coast,' as they styled themselves--had\r\nstipulated, for a certain sum, to escort a Spanish ship richly laden.\r\nOne of them ventured to propose to his companions to enrich themselves\r\nat once by taking the ship. Montauban, the commander of the troop, had\r\nno sooner heard the proposal, than he desired to resign his command and\r\nbe set on shore. 'What!' replied the freebooters, 'would you then leave\r\nus? Is there one among us who approves of the treachery you abhor?' A\r\ncouncil was thereupon called, and it was agreed that the person who had\r\nmade the proposition should be thrown upon the first coast they should\r\nreach. 'The history of past times,' says a quaint writer, 'doth not\r\noffer, nor will that of future times produce, an example of such an\r\nassociation, almost as marvellous as the discovery of the New World.\r\nTheir swords and their daring spirit, which they exercised with such\r\nterrible effect, were the only fortune they possessed in Europe. In\r\nAmerica, being enemies of all mankind, and dreaded by all, perpetually\r\nexposed to the most extreme dangers, and considering every day as their\r\nlast, their wealth was dissipated in the same manner in which it was\r\nacquired. They gave themselves up to all excesses of debauchery and\r\nprofusion, and on returning from their expeditions, the intoxication of\r\ntheir victories accompanied them in their feasts: they would embrace\r\ntheir mistresses in their bloody arms and fall asleep for a while,\r\nlulled by voluptuous pleasures, from which they were aroused to proceed\r\nto fresh massacres. It was a matter of indifference to them whether they\r\nleft their bodies upon the earth or beneath the waters, and they\r\nconsequently looked upon life and death with the same composure.\r\nFerocious in mind, misguided in conscience, destitute of connections, of\r\nrelatives, of friends, of fellow citizens, of country, of an asylum;\r\nwithout any of those motives which moderate the ardor of bravery by the\r\nvalue which they attach to existence, they were ever ready to rush, as\r\nwithout sight, upon the most desperate attempts. Equally incapable of\r\nsubmitting to indigence or quiet; too proud to employ themselves in\r\ncommon labor; they would have been the scourge of the Old World, had\r\nthey not been that of the New.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn closing this paper, it remains to glance for a moment at the real\r\nhistory of William Kidd, the buccaneer of the American colonies, whose\r\nname, as remarked in the former part of this article,[C] has for a\r\nhundred and fifty years stood at the head of the pirate legends of the\r\nNorth, but who, in reality, must have been one of the smallest members\r\nof the fraternity. I have not been able to ascertain the place of Kidd's\r\nnativity. He was, however, the captain of a merchant vessel, trading\r\nbetween New York and London, and was celebrated for his nautical skill\r\nand enterprise. The first mention of him, in our authentic criminal\r\nhistory, occurs in 1691, in which year, as we learn from the journals of\r\nthe New York Assembly, much was allowed to be due him 'for the many good\r\nservices done for the province in attending with his vessels.' But in\r\nwhat capacity, or for what object, he 'attended with his vessels,' does\r\nnot appear. It was also declared that he ought to be suitably rewarded.\r\nAccordingly, in the same year, it was ordered by the Assembly 'that the\r\nsum of one hundred and fifty pounds be paid to Captain Kidd, as a\r\nsuitable acknowledgement for the important benefits which the colony had\r\nderived from his services.' The presumption is, that those services were\r\nin some way connected with the protection of the colonial merchant ships\r\nfrom the attacks of the pirates, who were even yet hovering along the\r\ncoasts of the Northern colonies. Indeed, the harbor of New York itself\r\nwas no stranger to the pirate vessels, and the commerce between them and\r\nthe 'people of figure' in the city was not inconsiderable. It was no\r\nsecret that the pirates were freely supplied with provisions by the\r\ninhabitants of Long Island. Further yet, it was well known in the year\r\n1695, that the English pirates had fitted out the vessels in the harbor\r\nof New York. On the arrival of the pirate vessels from their cruises,\r\ntheir goods were openly sold in the city, and the conduct of the\r\nColonial Government was such, that collusion, if not actual partnerships\r\nbetween them and the public authorities, was not doubted. Colonel\r\nFletcher, a poor and profligate man, was governor at that time. He was\r\nbeyond doubt concerned with the freebooters, as also was William Nicoll,\r\na member of the privy council. Complaints upon this subject having\r\nreached England, Fletcher was succeeded, in 1695, by the Earl of\r\nBellamont, the appointment being made in the belief that, from his rank\r\nand the wealth of his character, he would be able to retrieve the\r\ncharacter of the Colonial Government.\r\n\r\nJustice, however, to the memory of Kidd requires it to be said that he\r\nwas not at that period, so far as it is known, a pirate himself. Before\r\nLord Bellamont sailed from England for his government, he met with\r\nRobert Livingston of New York--the ancestor of the Livingstons of\r\nLivingston's Manor--with whom he held a conversation respecting the\r\npirates, and the best means that could be adopted to put them down. The\r\nproject of employing a swift-sailing armed ship of thirty guns, and one\r\nhundred and fifty men, to cruise against them, was spoken of; and\r\nLivingston recommended his lordship to Kidd, as a man of integrity and\r\ncourage, acquainted with the pirates and their places of rendezvous, and\r\nas one in all respects fit to be intrusted with the command of a vessel\r\nengaged in such a difficult service. He had, indeed, commanded a\r\nprivateer, in regular commission, against the pirates in the West\r\nIndies, in which service he had acquitted himself as a brave and\r\nadventurous man. The project not being entertained by the Board of\r\nAdmiralty, a private adventure against the pirates was suggested by Mr.\r\nLivingston, one fifth part of the stock of which he would take himself,\r\nbesides becoming security for the good conduct of Kidd. The proposition\r\nwas approved by the king, who became interested to the amount of one\r\ntenth; and the residue of the expense was supplied by Lord Chancellor\r\nSomers, the Duke of Shrewsbury, the Earls of Romney and Oxford, and Sir\r\nEdmund Harrison and others. The ship having been procured and equipped,\r\nKidd sailed for New York under a regular commission, in April, 1696--the\r\ndirection of the enterprise being committed to the Earl of Bellamont and\r\nhimself. For a time he served faithfully and with advantage to the\r\ncommerce of the colonies and mother country; for which services he\r\nreceived much public applause, and another grant from the colony of two\r\nhundred and fifty pounds. Tradition, moreover, says that, on visiting\r\nthe government house, he was received with public honors, and invited to\r\na seat with the speaker of the House of Assembly.\r\n\r\nOn his next voyage, however, he stretched away to the Indian ocean, and\r\nturned pirate himself. Selecting the island of Madagascar as his\r\nprincipal place of rendezvous, and burning his own ship after having\r\ncaptured one that suited him better, his depredations upon the commerce\r\nof all nations were represented to have been great. It is said that he\r\n'ranged over the Indian coast from the Red sea to Malabar, and that his\r\ndepredations extended from the Eastern ocean back along the Atlantic\r\ncoast of South America, through the Bahamas, the whole of the West\r\nIndies, and the shores of Long Island.' But it will presently be seen\r\nthat this statement must have been an exaggeration, as time was not\r\nafforded for operations so extensive before his arrest.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond doubt true that Long Island contained several of his hiding\r\nplaces. 'Kidd's Rock' is well known at Manhasset, upon Long Island, to\r\nthis day. Here he was supposed to have buried some of his treasures, and\r\nmany have been the attempts of the credulous to find the hidden gold,\r\nbut it could not be found. There is also no doubt that he was wont to\r\nhide himself and his vessel among those curious rocks in Sachem's Head\r\nHarbor, called the Thimble islands. There is also upon one of those\r\nrocks, sheltered from the view of the Sound, a beautiful artificial\r\nexcavation of an oval form, holding perhaps the measure of a barrel,\r\ncalled 'Kidd's Punch Bowl.' It was here, according to the legend of the\r\nneighborhood, that he used to carouse with his crew. It is a fact,\r\nhowever, beyond controversy, that he was accustomed to anchor his vessel\r\nin Gardner's bay. On one occasion, in the night, he landed upon\r\nGardner's island, and requested Mrs. Gardner to provide a supper for\r\nhimself and his attendants. Knowing his desperate character, she dared\r\nnot refuse, and fearing his displeasure, she took great pains,\r\nespecially in roasting a pig. The pirate chief was so pleased with her\r\nculinary success, that, on going away, he presented her with a cradle\r\nblanket of gold cloth. On another occasion, also, when he landed at the\r\nisland, he buried a small casket of gold, silver, and precious stones in\r\npresence of Mr. Gardner, but under the most solemn injunctions of\r\nsecrecy.\r\n\r\nRepairing soon afterward to Boston, where Lord Bellamont happened to be\r\nat the time, he was summoned before his lordship, and directed to give a\r\nreport of his proceedings in the service of his company. Refusing to\r\ncomply with this demand, he was arrested on the third of July, 1699, on\r\nthe charge of piracy. He appears to have disclosed the fact of having\r\nburied the treasure at Gardner's island, for the same was demanded by\r\nhis lordship, and surrendered by Mr. Gardner. I have conversed with a\r\ngentleman who has seen the original receipt for the amount, with the\r\ndifferent items of the deposit. The amount was by no means large, and\r\naffords evidence of no such mighty sweepings of the seas as have been\r\ntold of in story and in song. Of gold, in coins, gold dust, and bars,\r\nthere were seven hundred and fifty ounces. Of silver, five hundred and\r\nsix ounces, and of precious stones about sixteen ounces.\r\n\r\nLord Bellamont wrote home for a ship of war, to carry Kidd to England\r\nfor trial. The 'Rochester' was despatched upon that service, but being\r\nobliged to put back, a general suspicion prevailed in England that there\r\nwas collusion between the pirates and the ministers, and, in fact, that\r\nthey dared not bring the sea robber home for trial, lest it should be\r\ndiscovered that the Lord Chancellor and his noble associates in the\r\nenterprise were confederates in the piracies also. Party spirit ran\r\nhigh, and the opponents of the ministers brought a resolution into the\r\nHouse of Commons for excluding from place all the partners of Kidd in\r\nthe original enterprise. And although this resolution was voted down,\r\nyet the Tories contrived afterward to impeach the Whig lords upon the\r\ncharge of having been concerned with Kidd. But the articles were not\r\nsustained. Meanwhile Kidd had been taken to England, tried on an\r\nindictment for piracy and murder, and hung in chains, with six of his\r\ncrew. In addition to the indictment for piracy, he was indicted for the\r\nmurder of one of his own subordinate officers, named Moore, whom he\r\nkilled in a quarrel, by striking him over the head with a bucket. He was\r\nconvicted upon both charges, but protested to the last that he was the\r\nvictim of conspiracy and perjury.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, suspicions were entertained by the public that the\r\nexecution was a sham--that the Government dared not put him to death;\r\nand that, to avoid disclosures, a man of straw was hung in his place. In\r\nproof of this assertion, it was gravely and strongly alleged that Kidd\r\nhad been seen alive and well, many years afterward, by those who could\r\nnot be mistaken as to his identity. I think there is no doubt, however,\r\nof his having been honestly hung at 'Execution Dock,' in London, on the\r\n12th of May, 1701. Yet, when compared with the nobler villains, Lolonois\r\nand Morgan, Kidd must have been a pirate upon an insignificant scale--a\r\nmere bottle imp by the side of Satan, as portrayed in stupendous\r\ngrandeur by Milton!\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[B] An indulgence was never granted in advance of any crime yet to be\r\ncommitted.

Two millions of Papal\r\nbulls!!!--_Ed._\r\n\r\n[C] See CONTINENTAL for June, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER THE PALMETTO.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 31st of January, 1863, the steamer 'S.R. Spaulding,'\r\nflagship of General Foster's fleet, left the harbor of Morehead City, N.\r\nC., on a supposed expedition to some point on the Southern coast. For\r\ntwo days we had watched from her deck the long procession of vessels\r\nmoving slowly round Fort Macon, and then, with all sails set, or under\r\nfull head of steam, passing proudly on in their southward course. Only\r\nthose who have witnessed such scenes can realize the eager interest and\r\nintense excitement which attend the preparation for a naval expedition.\r\nThen, too, there were glories of the past to kindle hope and stimulate\r\nambition. The successes of Burnside, Du Pont, and Farragut were fresh in\r\nmemory, and why should not we win new laurels for the old flag, and\r\nplace our commander's name high on the list of fame? And so, with\r\nfeelings of pride and expectation, we gladly saw the shores of North\r\nCarolina with their forests of pines recede from sight, as, under a\r\ncloudless sky and over a waveless sea, we glided on toward the hated\r\nmother State of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe sequel of the 'Foster Expedition' is well known. We anchored, on the\r\n2d of February, in the capacious harbor of Port Royal, and were flagship\r\nno longer. Fortunately, the long interval between our arrival and the\r\nfinal departure for Charleston under another commander, gave abundant\r\nopportunities for studying new phases of life and character, and for\r\nlearning something of the 15,000 freedmen who compose the loyal\r\npopulation of the Sea islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE PLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\nA geographical description of these outlying islands of South Carolina\r\nis hardly necessary at a time when we are studying the map of the\r\nrepublic under the guidance of bayonets and rifled cannon; and the guns\r\nof Admiral Du Pont revealed more of Port Royal and its surroundings than\r\nwe should ever have learned from our geographies. Previous to the\r\nrebellion these islands seem to have been rarely visited--so rarely,\r\nindeed, that the presence of one of our naval vessels in the Beaufort\r\nriver, a few years ago, was the signal for a week's festivities and a\r\ngeneral gathering of all the inhabitants to see the strangers--while\r\nthe 'cotton lords' vied with each other in entertaining the\r\ndistinguished guests. For the most part the islands are low, abounding\r\nin salt-water creeks and marshes, and covered, here and there, with\r\nforests of pine and live oak. The climate in winter is delightful, and\r\nthe rapid advance of vegetation in March and April--the sudden bursting\r\ninto bloom of a great variety of flowers and flowering shrubs--lends\r\nadditional charms to the early spring. Sitting, on one of those\r\ndelicious April days, in the upper piazza of an old plantation\r\nhouse--the eye resting on the long stretch of the cotton fields, now\r\ngreen with the growing plant--or tracing the windings of the creek\r\nthrough the numerous small islands, till it is lost in the haze which\r\ncovers all the distance--or, again, watching the shadows as they pass\r\nover the groves of oak and pine--while over the whole scene there broods\r\nthe stillness of a midsummer's noon--I could but wonder at the madness\r\nwhich had driven the former dwellers in such a fair land into the\r\ndesperate hazards and unaccustomed privations of civil war.\r\n\r\nThose who visit these islands to-day, must not expect to realize, in the\r\naltered condition of affairs, their ideal of plantation life, however\r\nthat ideal may have been formed. The change which has been wrought in\r\nlittle more than a year, is truly wonderful. The traces of slavery may\r\nindeed be found in an exhausted soil and an exhausted race, but all\r\noutward signs of the institution have been removed. 'The whip is lost,\r\nthe handcuff broken,' the whipping post destroyed, and the cotton gins\r\nbroken down. At the 'great house' you find, instead of the master and\r\noverseer, the superintendent and school teacher. In the field, the\r\ncotton tasks are comparatively small, but the garden patch in the rear\r\nof the cabin is large, well fenced in and well cultivated. If you see\r\nfew indications of positive happiness, you find no appearances of\r\noverburdened misery. There is about the whole place something of the air\r\nof a New England farmstead, where labor, being honored, crowns even the\r\nhumblest with dignity and peace. You take unspeakable comfort in the\r\nfact, that, open what door you may into the life of these people, there\r\nis no _skeleton_ of oppression to startle and haunt you. Go with me,\r\nthen, on this calm, bright day of early March, to visit one of the\r\nplantations on Port Royal Island, a few miles out of Beaufort. The\r\nquartermaster kindly furnishes us with a carriage, somewhat shabby and\r\nrickety to be sure, but one of the best that 'Secesh' has left for our\r\nuse. Our steeds, too, are only slow-moving Government mules, but there\r\nis one aristocratic feature of our establishment to remind us of the\r\nlife that was, viz.: a negro coachman 'educated to drive,' under whose\r\nskilful guidance many a happy family party have been conveyed from\r\nplantation to plantation on social visits like ours to-day. Uncle Ned\r\nspeaks kindly of his 'ole massa,' and says he 'would hab stayed wid 'um,\r\nef massa hadn't run away from heself.'\r\n\r\n'But why didn't you _go_ with him, uncle?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, sah, I could nebber go to de Secesh.'\r\n\r\nDoubtless many more of the house slaves and body servants of the\r\nplanters would have followed their masters, had they not been deterred\r\nby fear of the rebel soldiers and hard work in the trenches.\r\n\r\n'Use your whip, uncle,' and away we go at a respectable trot over the\r\nprincipal road on the island, which, from the fact of its having been\r\nmade of oyster shells, is called the 'Shell road,' and extends ten miles\r\nto Port Royal Ferry, at the extreme western point of the island. Timely\r\nshowers have laid the dust, and all the trees and bushes wear clean\r\nfaces. In the yards there are peach trees in bloom, beautiful crimson\r\njaponicas, the jonquil and snowdrop; while everywhere by the roadside\r\nwe see the ungainly form and coarse flower of the prickly pear. Passing\r\nthe rifle pits and picket station, we soon turn off from the Shell road,\r\nand pass through what was formerly a handsome forest of pines, but which\r\nnow has been cleared by the soldier's axe, and rejoices in the title of\r\n'pickpocket tract.' Few of the plantations lie on the main road, and\r\nmany of them, like the one we are now seeking, are approached only by\r\ngoing over several cross roads and by lanes. Our last turn takes us into\r\na handsome avenue of live oaks, whose overarching branches are adorned\r\nwith long ringlets of the graceful Spanish moss. In the woods on either\r\nside of the drive way are dogwood and Pride-of-Asia trees in full\r\nblossom, wild honeysuckle, and the sweet yellow jasmine which fills the\r\nair with its delicious fragrance. As we drive into the yard, the\r\nplantation house suddenly appears to view, half hidden by the dense\r\nfoliage of magnolia and orange trees. Although called one of the finest\r\nresidences on the island, the house is inferior to many of our larger\r\nfarmhouses in New England, and is a simple two-story structure of wood,\r\nresting on brick piles, with a veranda in front. Just beyond the path\r\nthat leads by the house, is a handsome flower garden, while both in the\r\nrear of the 'great house' and beyond the flower garden are rows of negro\r\nhuts. We are soon greeted by our hosts--one, a brave Vermonter, who\r\nserved faithfully in the army till disabled, the other, a Quaker of\r\nPhiladelphia, who has left family and friends to labor for the\r\nfreedman--and ushered into the principal room of the house, where we are\r\npresented to a party of the neighboring superintendents and school\r\nteachers. Dinner is all ready, and we sit down to a right royal\r\nentertainment, the chief dishes of which are portions of an immense\r\n_drumfish_ cooked in various fashion. Few entertainers can prove more\r\nagreeable than Northern men with Southern hospitality, and we eat and\r\nmake merry without even a thought of Colonel Barnwell, whose home we\r\nhave thus 'invaded,' and who, perchance, is shivering in the cold, and\r\nsuffering the privations of a rebel camp in Eastern Virginia. We must\r\nnot omit the praise due to our cook, a woman taken from the 'field\r\nhands,' and whose only instructors have been our hosts, neither of whom\r\ncan boast of much knowledge of the art of cooking. It would, however, be\r\nhardly safe to trust to an untutored field hand, as I once learned to my\r\ncost, when my contraband of the kitchen department called me to dinner\r\nby announcing that the eggs had been boiling for an hour, and the\r\noysters stewing for twice that time!\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME LIFE OF THE FREEDMEN.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner we visit the negroes in their cabins. The _home life_ of\r\nthe freedmen is at once the most noticeable and most interesting feature\r\nof their new condition. Even in former days, however often the sanctity\r\nof their homes may have been violated, with however weary limbs and\r\nsuffering souls they may have gone to them, yet here they must have\r\nfound their chiefest joy. Now, the humble cabins have become\r\ntransfigured, and we find therein not only joy, but peace and comfort,\r\nand, indeed, in greater or less degree, every element of that domestic\r\norder which makes the home the corner stone of our free institutions. I\r\nhave frequently, when conversing with the freedmen about the flight of\r\ntheir former masters, asked them why they did not accompany them, and\r\nhave invariably received the reply, 'Oh, sah, we couldn't do dat. We\r\nbelongs yere. _Dese are our homes._' This strong attachment to the soil,\r\nwhich has been made still stronger by the removal of everything which\r\ncould in any way remind them of their former condition, has proved to be\r\nthe great _lever_ to raise them into the dignity of free laborers. It is\r\ntrue their cabins are not yet free-holds; but the assurance that,\r\nunless the Government itself fails, no fault or misfortune of another\r\ncan ever deprive them of their homes, puts them at once on their good\r\nbehavior, that they may retain in their possession what they prize so\r\ndearly. The good results of this transformation of the home are seen in\r\nevery direction. The marriage relation is observed with a constantly\r\nincreasing strictness. Family ties are knitted more closely together.\r\nParents take a deep interest in the education of their children, and the\r\nchildren become in turn teachers to the parents of much that is\r\nimproving and civilizing. In the field there are generous rivalries\r\nbetween families to see which will cultivate the largest patches of corn\r\nand cotton. Greater neatness and order are observable about the\r\ndwellings, and wherever new cabins have been erected--always by negro\r\ncarpenters--there has been marked improvement in the style and comfort\r\nof the buildings. Freedom has also created new wants, and the freedman\r\npurchases from time to time, as he has ability, articles of luxury and\r\nof ornament for his home.\r\n\r\nI must, however, acknowledge a feeling of disappointment at not finding\r\nthe negroes more joyous in this new condition of freedom and progress.\r\nThose who know them best--the superintendents and teachers--testify to\r\nthe happiness of their daily lives and their light-hearted enjoyment of\r\nall their blessings; but to the casual observer there seems to be a\r\ngeneral absence among the freedmen of that cheerfulness and mirth which\r\nhe naturally expects to find in their homes. A simple explanation of\r\nthis fact may be found in the _sense of insecurity_ which the uncertain\r\nissue of the civil war that rages about them creates in their minds.\r\nThey have seen one after another of those islands which have been in our\r\npossession given up to the reoccupation of the rebels; the disastrous\r\nbattles of James's Island and Pocotaligo and the fruitless campaigns in\r\nFlorida are fresh in their minds; while that wearisome waiting for\r\nsomething to be accomplished which spreads such a spirit of restlessness\r\nand discontent among our soldiers, is felt even more keenly by the\r\nfreedmen. There is very much in the uncertainties of their present\r\ncondition to justify the favorite allusion of their preachers, who often\r\ncompare the freedmen to the children of Israel before they had fairly\r\ngained the promised land. Until a permanent peace shall give to these\r\npeople that feeling of security, without which, though there may be\r\ncontentment, there can be little joyousness, it is absurd for us to\r\n'require of them mirth,' or ask them to sing songs of gladness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREE LABOR.\r\n\r\nCochin, in his admirable work on the 'Results of Emancipation,' asserts\r\nof the negroes: 'This race of men, like all the human species, is\r\ndivided into two classes, the diligent and the idle; freedom has nothing\r\nto do with the second, while it draws from the labor of the first a\r\nbetter yield than servitude.' Has this statement proved true on the Sea\r\nIslands? The prejudiced are ready with their negative answer, and point\r\nto the comparatively small amount of cotton raised during the past year.\r\nBy such persons no allowance is made for the peculiarly unfavorable\r\ncircumstances under which the experiment of free labor thus far has been\r\ntried, and they are only too happy to charge upon emancipation all the\r\nevils which labor has suffered from the presence of our soldiers and the\r\ncontinuance of the war. The causes of the smallness of the cotton crop\r\nproduced last year, are obvious to the most careless observer. Owing to\r\nthe late arrival of the first company of superintendents who were sent\r\nfrom the North, no preparations were made for planting till more than\r\ntwo months after the usual time. On many of the plantations the seed\r\nused was of a poor quality, while it was almost impossible to find any\r\nimplements of culture or to obtain the necessary mules or horses. As a\r\nconsequence of the late planting, the cotton was not sufficiently\r\nadvanced to resist the attacks of the caterpillars in September, and for\r\na month these insects held grand carnival on the yet immature plants,\r\ncausing widespread damage to the crop. The low wages offered to the\r\nfreedmen by Government were no offset to the attractions of trading with\r\nthe army and navy, and all the negroes were ambitious to have some\r\nconnection with camp life. As a natural result of this condition of\r\nthings, both the industry and interest of the freedmen were drawn away\r\nfrom the cotton fields. Early in the season, also, when the young crops\r\nrequired constant attention, all the able-bodied men were drafted into\r\nGeneral Hunter's regiments, and kept in camp till the fall. The\r\ninfluence of the draft upon those who remained at home, added to the\r\ndelay and smallness of the Government payments, made the laborers\r\ndiscouraged at their prospects, disaffected toward the superintendents,\r\nand careless at their work.\r\n\r\nThe obstacles in the way of successful agricultural operations, produced\r\nby the military occupation of the islands, are still further evident\r\nfrom the fact that both provision and cotton crops improved in\r\nproportion to the distance from the camps. Thus, on Port Royal and\r\nHilton Head Islands, where most of the troops were encamped, very little\r\ncotton was raised, and so small a crop of provisions, that it became\r\nnecessary for Government to ration many of the freedmen during a brief\r\nperiod. On Ladies' and St. Helena Islands, away from the immediate\r\nvicinity of the camps, very fair crops of cotton were raised, and nearly\r\nenough provision for the support of all the laborers. The rations\r\nfurnished by Government, and which have given rise to so much unfriendly\r\ncomment, were called for, either by the refugees from the mainland and\r\nadjacent islands, many of whom had at first no means of subsistence, or\r\nby the freedmen on those plantations so exposed to the camps and so\r\nharassed by the soldiers, that the crops which they were able to gather\r\nfailed to last them through the year. In one district on St. Helena\r\nIsland, including three plantations, which was under the care of a\r\ncapable and judicious superintendent, of sufficient means to advance his\r\nprivate funds to the payment of the laborers, the total receipts from\r\nthe sale of the cotton and the surplus provisions raised were more than\r\ndouble all the expenses incurred in wages, clothing, and\r\nsuperintendence.\r\n\r\nSuch were the results of the first year's experiment. Early in the\r\npresent year several of the plantations passed into the possession of\r\nprivate individuals, and thus an important change has been effected in\r\nthe aspect of the free-labor problem. On the Government plantations,\r\nwhich are under the care of salaried superintendents as last year, a\r\nuniform system of labor has been adopted, embodying the results of\r\nprevious experience. Under this system, the laborers agree as to the\r\namount of cotton land which they will cultivate, and are then paid\r\ntwenty-five cents a day for their work. At the end of the year they are\r\nto receive a bonus of two cents per pound of unginned cotton for\r\npicking. This additional reward at once stimulates them to exertion, and\r\nteaches them that steady and continued labor brings the best return. In\r\naddition to raising the amount of cotton agreed upon, each freedman is\r\nresponsible for cultivating corn and potatoes enough for his own\r\nsubsistence, and land is allotted for this purpose. The laborers are\r\nalso required to produce corn enough for the subsistence of the\r\nplantation mules and horses, for the use of the superintendents, and for\r\nthe subsistence of all the old and disabled persons for whom provision\r\nis not otherwise made. As regards payments, the Government theory is\r\nmost excellent, inasmuch as it provides for partial payments while the\r\nwork is going on, so as to furnish the freedman enough money for his\r\nimmediate wants, and then, by the bonus which is paid at the end of the\r\nyear, supplies him with an amount greater than his wages, to be laid up\r\nor put out at interest. Unfortunately the practice of the Government has\r\nbeen most injurious. The delay in the monthly payments during the past\r\nyear, sometimes for as long a period as six months, caused the laborers\r\nto become discouraged, discontented, and suspicious. Unlike the soldier,\r\nthe freedman is not clothed or fed by Government (except in the case of\r\nthose who are utterly destitute), nor can he, like other laborers,\r\nobtain credit to the extent of the wages due him. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the delay on the part of the Government in paying the\r\nfreedman has been not only unjust to the laborers but disastrous to the\r\nworkings of the free-labor system.\r\n\r\nOn the purchased plantations we find a wholly different state of things,\r\nand, as might be expected, a great variety of systems of labor. Some of\r\nthe best managers keep up the Government scale of prices, but pay the\r\nlaborers more promptly, and increase their wages by many indirect means,\r\nsuch as giving them bacon and molasses in proportion to the amount of\r\ncotton land which they cultivate, providing a store for the plantation,\r\nwhere the freedmen can purchase articles at a much lower rate than\r\nelsewhere, keeping the cabins in good repair, building new ones, and\r\nhaving always on hand the necessary plantation implements for\r\nfacilitating the culture of the cotton. Others pay higher wages, and\r\nalso increase the bonus which is paid for picking the cotton. Some\r\npromise the freedmen so much per pound for the cotton which they shall\r\nraise, and see that all their wants are supplied till the crop is\r\ngathered; while still others, from lack of judgment or capital, offer\r\nthe negroes a certain portion of the crop--in some cases as high as two\r\nthirds--in return for their labor. On all these plantations the freedmen\r\nare doing better than on those which are still retained by Government.\r\nThe average amount of cotton land which has been planted this spring is\r\nfrom an acre and a half to two acres for each 'full hand.' Under slavery\r\na full hand took care on an average of three acres, but it must be\r\nremembered that all the able-bodied negroes, excepting only a foreman to\r\neach plantation, have been drafted into the army, or are working in the\r\nQuartermaster's Department.\r\n\r\nAt the present time all indications point to a successful season. Riding\r\nover many of the plantations, I have seen the negroes at work breaking\r\nup the ground or planting the seed, and everywhere found them laboring\r\ndiligently, and even showing a manly emulation in their tasks. Yet it\r\nwould be unreasonable to expect too much where so many obstacles beset\r\nthe way. As one of the new planters writes: 'For success in an\r\nexperiment of free hired labor among ignorant blacks just emancipated,\r\nconditions of peace and quiet are absolutely necessary. However, the\r\ndifficulties in our way are purely natural workings, and merely show\r\nthat black is more nearly white than is usually allowed.' Perhaps the\r\ngreatest of these obstacles is the vicinity of the camps at Beaufort and\r\nHilton Head, which tempts the freedmen to leave their regular\r\nemployments and obtain an easy livelihood by the sale of eggs, chickens,\r\nfish, oysters, &c. Such markets affect the blacks on the plantations\r\njust as the California fever affected the laboring men of the North a\r\nfew years ago; and it is a matter of surprise and congratulation that\r\nthe presence of the soldiers has not produced a greater demoralization\r\namong the negroes than we find to be the case.\r\n\r\nFive of the plantations were bought by the freedmen themselves, who are\r\nnow carrying them on as independent cultivators. Everywhere the\r\nfreedmen, on hearing that the lands were to be sold, were eager to buy,\r\nand it was found in many cases that they had saved considerable sums of\r\nmoney from their earnings of the previous year. This almost universal\r\ndesire of the negroes to become landowners, is a complete refutation of\r\nthe charge that sudden emancipation from forced labor opens the door for\r\nthe return of the blacks to barbarism.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the trial of free labor is now carried on in\r\nSouth Carolina, are unparalleled in history. Those who are familiar with\r\nthe results of emancipation in the French and English colonies, will\r\nfind few points of comparison between those results and the present\r\nworkings of freedom on the Sea Islands. Consider that at no previous\r\ntime, and in no other country, has there ever been an immediate and\r\nunconditional abolition of slavery. France, in the frenzy of the\r\nRevolution, declared that slavery was abolished, but was forced to\r\nreëstablish it under the Consulate; and, during the half century which\r\nfollowed before the complete and final emancipation of the slaves in\r\n1848, we find continually acts and measures adopted which gradually\r\npaved the way to this ultimate success. England, too, after the\r\nabolition of the slave trade, made repeated efforts to ameliorate the\r\ncondition of the slave population of her colonies, and when, in 1833,\r\nthe Act of Emancipation was passed, it was found that, while declaring\r\nall slaves on English soil to be instantly free, it made provisions for\r\ntransforming them into apprenticed laborers. In South Carolina,\r\nemancipation, proclaimed by the guns of Admiral Du Pont, was instant,\r\nunlooked for, and without conditions. However ardently it may have been\r\ndesired by the slaves themselves, they surely could not have expected\r\nit, at a time when the belief universally prevailed among the planters\r\nthat the forts which defended their islands were impregnable.\r\n\r\nIn the colonies of France and England, there was no civil war, bringing\r\ninto the midst of the plantations the demoralizing influences of the\r\ncamp, harassing the simple-minded freedmen with constant fear of\r\nreverses, which would consign them to a worse bondage than they had ever\r\nknown, and tending, in the absence of all civil law and the restraints\r\nof a well-ordered society, to draw away the laborer from the cultivation\r\nof the soil. In South Carolina, moreover, no masters or overseers were\r\nleft, as in the French and English colonies, to direct the negroes in\r\ntheir labor; and, in consequence, their guidance has been intrusted to a\r\nbody of superintendents from the North, most of them young men, and all\r\nwithout experience, either in the management of the blacks or the\r\nculture of the cotton. This complete separation of the freedmen from\r\ntheir former masters, by reason of the flight and escape of all the\r\nplanters, has been, in many respects, most favorable to their progress\r\nin liberty. Consider for a moment what would have been the result if, at\r\nany time during the past thirty years, it had been possible to effect\r\nthe abolishment of slavery in these islands by an act of the General\r\nGovernment. Who can doubt that such an act, passed against the wills of\r\nthe slaveholders, would have produced the most disastrous consequences,\r\nand that such an experiment of free labor as is now going on would have\r\nbeen utterly impossible? Those, at least, who have had opportunities for\r\nobserving the bitter hate engendered toward the negroes, among those\r\nmasters whom the proclamation of the 1st of January deprived of their\r\nformer 'chattels,' cannot but regard with satisfaction such peaceful\r\nsolutions of this fearful problem as that effected at Port Royal, where\r\nthe shot and shell of our gunboats, in breaking the chains of the slave,\r\nat the same moment compelled the master to flight.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGION OF THE FREEDMEN.\r\n\r\nThe religious condition of the South Carolina freedmen presents many\r\npeculiar and interesting features. Whether, like the negroes in the 'old\r\nNorth State,' they celebrated their new birth into freedom by services\r\nof praise and thanksgiving at the altar, I have been unable to learn;\r\nbut certain it is, that the wonderful tranquillity of their sudden\r\ntransition from bondage, and the good use which they have made of their\r\nliberty, are owing in great measure to their deep religious earnestness.\r\nThis earnestness, it is evident, is not the result of conviction or\r\nenlightenment, so much as of the strong emotional nature of the blacks,\r\nintensified by sympathy, and kept alive to religious feeling by their\r\nfrequent meetings for prayer and praise. Yet, to the careful observer,\r\nthe blind and often superstitious worship of these people, which, as is\r\nnow so plainly seen, was fostered by slavery, is one of the saddest\r\nresults of the system. Those who are now permitted to watch over the\r\nreligious progress of the freedmen, can bring new and abundant proof to\r\nthe assertion of De Tocqueville, that 'Christianity is a religion of\r\n_freemen_.' The present opportunities for religious worship which the\r\nfreedmen enjoy consist of their 'praise meetings'--similar in most\r\nrespects to our prayer meetings--which are held two or three times a\r\nweek on the plantations, and the Sunday services at the various churches\r\nscattered about the islands. These services are usually conducted by\r\nwhite preachers, and are attended not only by the negroes, but also by\r\nthe superintendents, teachers, and many casual visitors from the camps.\r\nAt Beaufort and Hilton Head large and flourishing Sunday schools are in\r\noperation. Most of the freedmen belong either to the Baptist or\r\nMethodist denomination, and the fervor and zeal of the preachers of the\r\nlatter persuasion always find a response in the excitable and impulsive\r\nnature of the blacks. It is not a little singular that, while Cochin can\r\nwrite concerning the freedmen in the French colonies that 'the\r\n_Catholic_ worship has incomparable attractions for the blacks,' we find\r\nthe negro in our own country everywhere attracted toward that sect of\r\nProtestants which has always been the most powerful antagonist to\r\nRomanism.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 15th of March, in company with a party of superintendents\r\nand teachers, I attended a service held for the freedmen on St. Helena's\r\nIsland. Our ride from the plantation took us through field and wood,\r\ntill we reached the main road on which the church is situated. It is a\r\nsimple, unpretending structure of brick, shaded on all sides by handsome\r\nlive oaks. Near by is the small cemetery, and the drooping moss from the\r\noaks hangs in sombre beauty over the graves. Under the trees is a group\r\nof superintendents discussing the news and the last order of General\r\nHunter. As we ride up, a party of officers comes galloping in from camp,\r\nwhile from the other direction is seen approaching a venerable carryall,\r\nconveying a party of lady teachers from a distant plantation. The\r\nservice has already begun, and the church is crowded with the dusky\r\nauditors, while here and there may be seen a pew filled with 'white\r\nfolks.' The day is warm, so we can stand by the open window and take in\r\nthe whole scene at a single glance. No danger to-day of any\r\nmanifestations of overwrought feelings; no groans nor excited shoutings\r\nof 'Amen.' The preacher has taken his text from the first chapter of\r\nGenesis, and he is describing the wonders of the creation. His sermon\r\nmight properly be entitled a 'Disquisition upon the Universe.' It is\r\nevident that his colored hearers fail to see the 'beauty and mysterious\r\norder of the stellar world' which he is portraying, for most of them are\r\nalready dozing, and the rest are nodding their heads as if in sleepy\r\nassent to the undoubted truth of the good man's words. He has\r\noverreached his mark, and hits neither the heads nor the hearts of his\r\ncongregation. At length the discourse is ended, and all rise to join in\r\nthe closing hymn, which is 'deaconed off' by the minister, and responded\r\nto by the negroes in a monotonous '_yah, yah_.' They have not recovered\r\nfrom the soporific effect of the sermon, and, besides, can hardly be\r\nblamed for not catching the feebly uttered words. But their time is\r\ncoming. No sooner is the benediction pronounced, than one of the negro\r\nelders strikes up a well known hymn, and, suddenly rousing from their\r\nstupor, the whole congregation join in singing in clear and ringing\r\ntones verse after verse of the jubilant song. Then follow other hymns\r\nand chants peculiar to the negro worship, the crude expressions of their\r\ndeep emotional feeling. As we leave the church, we are convinced that\r\nthe religious teachers of the newly freed blacks are sadly at fault in\r\nrepeating so much the kind of preaching to which the negroes were\r\naccustomed under the old system, and in neglecting to pour into their\r\nperceptive souls both the light and warmth of the Gospel. As an officer\r\nremarked who had stood at our side listening to the service: 'These\r\npeople had enough of the Old Testament thrown at their heads under\r\nslavery. Now give them the glorious utterances and practical teachings\r\nof the Great Master.'\r\n\r\nAt some of the meetings of the freedmen, they are addressed by negro\r\npreachers, who never fail to speak with great effect. In Alexandria,\r\nVa., I was told by the superintendent of the freedmen of an old negro\r\nteacher and exhorter, the self-elected pastor of all the blacks there,\r\ngoing about from house to house to minister to the wants of the sick and\r\nafflicted, teaching the young, and speaking in all the meetings. 'This\r\nold negro,' said the superintendent, 'has more influence over the\r\nblacks, and does more good among them, than all the missionaries and\r\nchaplains who have been sent here.' To the same effect is the testimony\r\nof all who have listened to the colored preacher at Port Royal, and who\r\nknow the great power which the chief elders of their churches possess\r\nover the rest of the negroes. A verbatim report of an exhortation given,\r\njust before the expedition to Jacksonville, Fla., to the soldiers of\r\nColonel Higginson's 1st South Carolina Volunteers, by one of these negro\r\npreachers, would be worthy a place in 'American Oratory.' I remember\r\nonly one striking passage, where, in his appeal to the troops to fight\r\nbravely, he urged them to seek always the post of danger, since heaven\r\nwould be the immediate reward of all who should be killed in battle;\r\nfor, said he, as if moved by an oracle: 'What hab been, dat will be. He\r\nwho is de fust man to get into de boat, and de fust to jump on shore,\r\nhim, if he fall, will be de fust to get to heaben.' Then, as if standing\r\nalready in the midst of the fight, and with all the feelings of his\r\nnature roused against his enemies, he added: 'An' when de battle\r\ncomes--when you see de Kunn'l put his shoulder to de wheel, and hear de\r\nshot and shell flying all round like de rain drops, den remember dat\r\nebery one ob dose shot is a bolt ob de Almighty God to send dem rebels\r\nto deir eberlasting damnation.' Such fervent utterances are not uncommon\r\namong the negro preachers, and are well calculated to produce a powerful\r\neffect upon the susceptible natures of their hearers, 'deep answering\r\nunto deep.'\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGRO 'SHOUTS' AND SHOUT SONGS.\r\n\r\nAt the 'praise meetings' on the plantations, one of the elders usually\r\npresides, and conducts the exercises with great solemnity. Passages of\r\nScripture are quoted from memory, and the hymns, which constitute the\r\nprincipal feature of the meeting, are deaconed off as at church.\r\nSometimes the superintendent or one of the teachers attends these\r\nmeetings, and is then expected to conduct the exercises and make an\r\naddress. After the praise meeting is over, there usually follows the\r\nvery singular and impressive performance of the '_Shout_,' or religious\r\ndance of the negroes. Three or four, standing still, clapping their\r\nhands and beating time with their feet, commence singing in unison one\r\nof the peculiar shout melodies, while the others walk round in a ring,\r\nin single file, joining also in the song. Soon those in the ring leave\r\noff their singing, the others keeping it up the while with increased\r\nvigor, and strike into the shout step, observing most accurate time with\r\nthe music. This step is something halfway between a shuffle and a dance,\r\nas difficult for an uninitiated person to describe as to imitate. At the\r\nend of each stanza of the song the dancers stop short with a slight\r\nstamp on the last note, and then, putting the other foot forward,\r\nproceed through the next verse. They will often dance to the same song\r\nfor twenty or thirty minutes, once or twice, perhaps, varying the\r\nmonotony of their movement by walking for a little while and joining in\r\nthe singing. The physical exertion, which is really very great, as the\r\ndance calls into play nearly every muscle of the body, seems never to\r\nweary them in the least, and they frequently keep up a shout for hours,\r\nresting only for brief intervals between the different songs. Yet, in\r\ntrying to imitate them, I was completely tired out in a very short time.\r\nThe children are the best dancers, and are allowed by their parents to\r\nhave a shout at any time, though, with the adults, the shout always\r\nfollows a religious meeting, and none but church members are expected to\r\njoin. It is to one of these shouts of the negro children that Mr.\r\nRussell alludes in his Diary when describing a visit which he paid to a\r\nplantation near Charleston in April, 1861. He speaks of the children as\r\na set of 'ragged, dirty, and shoeless urchins, who came in shyly,\r\noftentimes running away till they were chased and captured, dressed into\r\nline with much difficulty, and, then, shuffling their flat feet,\r\nclapping their hands, and drawling out in a monotonous sort of chant\r\nsomething about the 'River Jawdam.'' Such a sketch conveys no idea of\r\nthe shout as it may be witnessed to-day on any of the plantations among\r\nthe Sea Islands. You will find the children clean, and, in general,\r\nneatly dressed, coming into the room when asked by the superintendent,\r\nrendering their impressive and oftentimes pleasing melodies in a manner\r\nseldom surpassed in our schools at the North, while their 'shouting'\r\nreveals a suppleness of limb and peculiar grace of motion beyond the\r\npower of our dancing masters to impart.\r\n\r\nThere are many features of the negro shout which amuse us from their\r\nstrangeness; some, also, that strike the observer as wholly absurd. Yet,\r\nviewed as a religious exercise--and in this light it is always\r\nconsidered by the older negroes--I cannot help regarding it, in spite of\r\nmany of its characteristics, as both a natural and a rational expression\r\nof devotional feeling. The negroes never indulge in it when, for any\r\nreason, they feel downhearted or sad at their meetings. The shout is a\r\nsimple outburst and manifestation of religious fervor--a 'rejoicing in\r\nthe Lord'--making a 'joyful noise unto the God of their salvation.'\r\n\r\nThe words of the shout songs are a singular medley of things sacred and\r\nprofane, and are the natural outgrowth of the imperfect and fragmentary\r\nknowledge of the Scriptures which the negroes have picked up. The\r\nsubstitution for these crude productions of appropriate hymns, would\r\nremove from the shout that which is now the chief objection to it in\r\nintelligent minds, and would make of the dance, to which the negroes are\r\nso much attached, a useful auxiliary in their religious culture. The\r\ntunes to which these songs are sung, are some of them weird and\r\nwild--'barbaric madrigals'--while others are sweet and impressive\r\nmelodies. The most striking of their barbaric airs it would be\r\nimpossible to write out, but many of their more common melodies are\r\neasily caught upon being heard a few times. This music of the negro\r\nshout opens a new and rich field of melody--a mine in which there is\r\nmuch rough quartz, but also many veins of sparkling ore.\r\n\r\nWhat, for example, could be more animated, and at the same time more\r\nexpressive of the thought conveyed in the verse than the following\r\nchorus?--the introduction to which is a sort of recitative or chant:\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    I'd a like to die as a Jesus die, An' he die wid a freely good will, He\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    lay in de grabe, An' he stretchy out he arms, O, Lord, remember me.\r\n\r\n    CHORUS. _Lively._\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    O, Lord, remember me,  Do, Lord, remember me;  Re-\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    member me when de year rolls round, O,  Lord, remember me.\r\n\r\nThe words of the chant are evidently a very childlike expression of the\r\nwish to die with the same good will and spirit of forgiveness which were\r\nmanifested in the Saviour's death.\r\n\r\nOf a very different character is the following verse, sung to the same\r\nrecitative:\r\n\r\n    'O, Death he is a little man,\r\n    He goes from do' to do',\r\n    He kill some soul, an he wounded some,\r\n    An' he lef' some soul for to pray.'\r\n\r\nA most striking contrast between the recitative and chorus, is presented\r\nin the following:\r\n\r\n    RECITATIVE (_Sung to one note like a chant, with a cadence at the\r\n    end_):--\r\n\r\n    'I wonder why Satan do follow me so?\r\n    Satan hab noting 't all for to do, long 'wid me.'\r\n\r\n    CHORUS. _Slow and forcibly._\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    Hold your light, Hold your light, Hold your light on Canaan's shore.\r\n\r\nThe next song presents a greater variety in melody, as well as in the\r\ndifferent verses, which seem to have no connection whatever with each\r\nother. The 'Parson Fuller' referred to is the Rev. Dr. Fuller, of\r\nBaltimore, who owns a plantation on one of the islands:\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    Dar's a meetin' here to-night, Dar's a meetin' here to-night, Dar's a\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n                                                    ( 1. Parson Fuller sittin'\r\n    on de\r\n    meetin' here to-night,  I hope to meet you dar. ( 2. Little children learn\r\n    to\r\n                                                    ( 3. Let no angry word or\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    Tree of Life, An' he heary when Jordan roll.)\r\n    fear de Lord, An'  let your days be long.   )  Roll, Jordan,  roll Jordan,\r\n    spiteful boast Be  heard up-on your tongue. )\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n     Roll, Jor-dan, roll,  Roll, Jordan, roll, O roll, Jordan,  roll, O my\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    soul will rise to heab'n above, An' heary when Jordan roll.\r\n\r\nThe following has evidently been composed since the negroes became free,\r\nand expresses very forcibly their feelings toward 'driber, massa, and\r\nmissus':\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    Done wid driber's  dribin',   Done wid driber's dribin',\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    Done wid driber's  drib-in', Roll,  Jordan,  roll.\r\n\r\n    2.

You feed on milk and honey,  You feed on milk and honey, my Lord, You\r\n\r\n    [music notation]\r\n\r\n    down in de lonesome valley,   You meet my Jesus  dere.\r\n    feed on milk and honey,       And meet my Jesus dere.\r\n\r\nThe third and fourth stanzas are:\r\n\r\n    3. When Johnny brought a letter,\r\n       When Johnny brought a letter, my Lord,\r\n       When Johnny brought a letter,\r\n                   He meet my Jesus dere.\r\n\r\n    4. An' Mary and Marta read 'em,\r\n       An' Mary and Marta read 'em, my Lord,\r\n       An' Mary and Marta read 'em,\r\n                   Dey meet my Jesus dere.\r\n\r\nThe example above given will convey a good idea of the general character\r\nof the shout songs. Apart from these religious songs, there is no music\r\namong the South Carolina freedmen, except the simple airs which are sung\r\nby the boatmen, as they row on the rivers and creeks. A tinge of sadness\r\npervades all their melodies, which bear as little resemblance to the\r\npopular Ethiopian melodies of the day as twilight to noonday. The\r\njoyous, merry strains which have been associated in the minds of many\r\nwith the Southern negro, are never heard on the Sea Islands. Indeed, by\r\nmost of the negroes, such songs as 'Uncle Ned' and 'O Susanna' are\r\nconsidered as highly improper. In the schools, many of the best songs\r\nwhich are sung in our Sunday and public schools have been introduced,\r\nand are opening new sources of pleasure to a race so musical by their\r\nvery nature as are the negroes of the South.\r\n\r\nWhile in Beaufort, I attended a concert given by a band of genuine\r\n'negro minstrels.' The company had taken the name of the 'Charleston\r\nMinstrels,' and was composed mainly of refugees from Charleston, who\r\nwere then servants to various officers in General Saxton's Department.\r\nThe concert was held in the Episcopal Church, and the proceeds devoted\r\nto the benefit of the sick and wounded of the First South Carolina\r\nVolunteers. The first view of the performers, as they sat round the\r\nstage, a dozen finely formed and good-looking negroes, caused the\r\nspectator to fancy himself in the presence of the famous band of\r\nChristy, or some other company of white Ethiopian serenaders. Soon, the\r\nopera glass revealed the amusing fact, that, although every minstrel was\r\nby nature as black as black could be, yet all the performers had given\r\ntheir faces a coating of burnt cork, in order that their resemblance to\r\nYankee minstrels might be in every respect complete. There were\r\nexcellent voices among the singers, and some of the players handled\r\ntheir instruments with surprising skill; but the presence of an audience\r\ncomposed entirely of white people, and including many of the highest\r\nofficers in the Department, evidently caused great embarrassment to\r\nperformers so unaccustomed to the stage. Not a single song which could\r\nbe called comic was included in the programme; and, with the exception\r\nof a few patriotic airs, the songs were of the 'Lily Dale,'\r\nhalf-mournful sort. Between the pieces there was the customary telling\r\nof anecdotes and cracking of jokes, some of which were quite amusing,\r\nwhile others excited laughter from the manner in which they were told.\r\nAs an imitation of our Northern minstrelsy given by a band of uneducated\r\nnegro musicians, the performance was a wonderful success. Yet the\r\ngeneral impression left upon the mind of the hearer was far from\r\npleasing. One could not help feeling that a people, whose very natures\r\nare attuned to harmony, are capable of something better than even the\r\nmost perfect imitation of those who have so grossly caricatured their\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHOOLS AND EDUCATION AMONG THE FREEDMEN.\r\n\r\nThe education of the children of the freedmen was begun simultaneously\r\nwith the work of employing the negroes as free laborers. Teachers, both\r\nmen and women, from Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, accompanied the\r\nsuperintendents who were sent to Port Royal in March, 1862. The results\r\nof their labors during the past year have been most encouraging, in\r\nspite of the changes and confusion caused by the war and the numerous\r\nobstacles in the way of a steady and continued application on the part\r\nof the children. The teachers in their reports all unite to attest the\r\n'universal eagerness to learn,' which they have not found equalled in\r\nwhite persons, arising both from the desire for knowledge common to all,\r\nand the desire to raise their condition now so very strong among these\r\npeople. The details of these reports present few points of special\r\ninterest to the common reader. A common mistake, both of those who visit\r\nthese schools for the first time, and of others who have merely heard of\r\ntheir existence, arises from comparing the negro schools, where children\r\nof all ages are to be seen, with our district schools in New England,\r\nwhere difference of age implies a corresponding difference in\r\nattainments. 'What are your most advanced classes studying?' is very\r\noften asked of the teachers, when a moment's reflection would convince\r\nthe inquirer, that the Primer and First Reader are the only books which\r\nwe expect to see in the hands of children who have but just learned\r\ntheir letters. Viewing the rapid progress which these colored children\r\nhave made in learning to read during the past year--many of them being\r\nobliged to leave school and work in the field during a considerable\r\nportion of the time--the retentive memories which they have shown in\r\ntheir studies, and their great eagerness to learn, which requires no\r\nurging from parents or teachers, and which manifests itself in the\r\npunctual attendance even of those who are obliged to walk from long\r\ndistances to the school house--we may well be satisfied with what has\r\nalready been accomplished, and with the prospects for the future.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the _adults_ are as eager to learn as the children,\r\nand the reading or spelling book is the almost invariable companion of\r\nthe freedmen when off duty. On the wharves, in the intervals between\r\nlabor--in the camp, whenever a leisure moment is found--on the\r\nplantations, when work is done--everywhere, you will see the negroes\r\nwith book in hand, patiently poring over their lesson, picking the way\r\nalong as best they can, or eagerly following the guidance of some kind\r\nfriend who stops to teach them. Probably few of these adult students\r\nwill ever advance beyond a simple knowledge of reading, and many,\r\ndoubtless, will stop short of this, lacking the perseverance necessary\r\nto attain success. Most of the freedmen, however, are so earnest and\r\ndetermined in their pursuit of knowledge, so patient and untiring in\r\ntheir efforts to learn, and, withal, enjoy such keen pleasure in this\r\nawakening to consciousness of their mental powers, that they cannot fail\r\nto elevate themselves thereby, and also to feel an increased interest in\r\nthe education of their children.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN CAMP.\r\n\r\nNegro soldiers on the Sea islands have long since ceased to be objects\r\nof wonder or curiosity, and may be seen to-day in camp, on picket, or on\r\ndetached service, everywhere doing their work in a quiet, soldierly\r\nmanner, and attracting no more attention than the white troops about\r\nthem. Through many difficulties, and against great opposition, they have\r\nconquered their present honorable position in the Department of the\r\nSouth. The untimely draft of the freedmen made by General Hunter in May,\r\n1862, the violence and deception with which the order was enforced, as\r\nwell as the refusal of the Government to receive these regiments into\r\nthe service, causing the dispersion of the troops without pay and\r\nwithout honor, was enough to discourage all further enlistment. But\r\nwhen, last winter, General Saxton called for volunteers, an entire\r\nregiment was soon raised, and early in the present year, the 1st South\r\nCarolina Volunteers were ready to take the field. Fortunately for the\r\nregiment and for the country, the services of Thomas Wentworth\r\nHigginson, of Worcester, Mass., were secured as commander of this first\r\nregiment of Union soldiers raised in South Carolina. 'The right man in\r\nthe right place' has not become so common a sight in our army, as to\r\nprevent our being thankful that so fit an appointment was made and\r\naccepted. Surely we are but just beginning to learn what heroes we have,\r\nwhen we see a man of high literary attainments, whose eloquent words,\r\nboth spoken and written, have contributed so largely to the physical,\r\nmental, and moral culture of his countrymen, laying down the pen for the\r\nsword at the call of duty, and winning at once by his wisdom and skill\r\nthe two highest objects of an officer's ambition, the devotion of his\r\nmen, and the commendation of his superiors.\r\n\r\nSoon after arriving at Port Royal, I paid a visit to Colonel Higginson's\r\nregiment, then encamped about four miles from Beaufort. Setting out on\r\nhorseback in company with one of the superintendents, our ride took us\r\nalong the banks of the Beaufort river, past cotton plantations, and\r\nthrough pleasant woods bright with the golden blossoms of the pines.\r\nAlthough it was early in February, we saw the negroes at work in the\r\nfields, 'listing' the ground--a process of breaking up the soil with\r\nhoes--while here and there a solitary palmetto stood, like a scarecrow,\r\nas if to warn away all invaders. We soon reached 'Camp Saxton,' which we\r\nfound pleasantly situated near a large and magnificent grove of live\r\noaks, just at the bend of the river, where a fine view is given of the\r\nwinding stream, the harbor of Port Royal, and the low-lying islands in\r\nthe distance. The grove, which is the handsomest on the islands, was\r\nformerly part of a plantation belonging to a master well known by his\r\ncruelty toward his slaves, and the tree which served as the whipping\r\npost is still pointed out. A short distance from the camp, by the river\r\nside, may be seen the remains of an old Spanish fort, built of oyster\r\nshells, and said to have been erected in the year 1637.\r\n\r\nTo one accustomed to notice the sanitary appearance of camps, the\r\nneatness observable both in the streets and tents of 'Camp Saxton' was\r\nan agreeable surprise. Few camps in any department of the army are\r\nbetter policed, or present to the visitor such a general air of order\r\nand cleanliness as this first encampment of Colonel Higginson's\r\nregiment. As we enter one of the streets a company inspection of arms is\r\ngoing on, which displays to good advantage the proficiency of the\r\ncolored soldier in the minutiæ of his work. Soon after, we are summoned\r\nto witness a battalion drill, and my companion, who has been both an\r\narmy officer and a 'Democrat,' is extravagant in his praise of the\r\nmovements and evolutions of the troops. Before leaving the camp we visit\r\nthe snug and comfortable hospital into which Yankee ingenuity has\r\nmetamorphosed the upper story of an old ginhouse. The surgeon informs us\r\nthat the most common disease in the regiment is _pneumonia_, and that,\r\nin order to guard as far as possible against this, he has the middle\r\nboard of the tent floor taken up just at night, and a fire built on the\r\nground, to remove the dampness.\r\n\r\nWe are careful to make our exit at the proper place, as negro soldiers\r\non guard observe unwonted strictness, and we hear of their having\r\nthreatened to shoot the commanding general himself for attempting to\r\npass out at some other than the regular passage way.\r\n\r\nI have seen the soldiers of Colonel Higginson's regiment on several\r\nother occasions than the one above described, and have always found them\r\ndisplaying the same soldierly qualities. Their picketing of Port Royal\r\nisland has not been surpassed by any white regiment for the rigor and\r\nwatchfulness with which it was enforced. 'Will they fight?' is a\r\nquestion which the events of the war are fast answering in the\r\naffirmative. The South Carolina volunteers have not as yet met the\r\nrebels in close conflict; but, in holding captured places against large\r\nnumbers of the enemy, in passing rebel batteries on the Florida rivers,\r\nand in hazardous excursions into the heart of the enemy's country, where\r\nthey have been constantly exposed to the fire of sharp-shooters and\r\nguerillas, they have behaved as bravely as any other regiments in the\r\nservice; while they have united to their ready obedience and prompt\r\nexecution of orders, a dash and fierceness such as might have been\r\nexpected from their excitable nature when under the stimulus of actual\r\nwarfare. In view, therefore, of the admirable manner in which these\r\nfreedmen have performed all the duties of a soldier's life which have\r\nthus far been required of them, it is fair to presume that in the fierce\r\nshock of open battle, they will acquit themselves like men. A striking\r\nillustration of the wide difference between the theories of those who\r\noppose the use of the negro as a soldier, and the facts which the war is\r\nconstantly revealing, was furnished on our passage from North Carolina\r\nto Port Royal. 'Will the negro troops be clean?' was asked of an officer\r\nof the regular army, and his reply was a highly wrought and imaginary\r\ndescription of the horrible condition of the garrisons, and the fearful\r\nepidemics, which would be occasioned by placing black soldiers in the\r\nforts on our Southern coast. The facts of the case in reference to the\r\ncomparative cleanliness of white and black troops showed that, while the\r\ncompanies of regulars under this officer's care habitually neglected on\r\nship-board the simplest sanitary regulations, such as sweeping and\r\nwashing the decks, the negro soldiers who had been taken on our\r\nGovernment transports to various points on the Florida coast, daily\r\nobserved these important rules, gaining thereby the commendation of the\r\nship's officers, and promoting at the same time their own health and\r\ncomfort. The explanation of this fact is found in the prompt and\r\nunquestioning obedience of the black soldier, the peculiar\r\ncharacteristic of those who have been accustomed in a state of servitude\r\nto execute the commands of those who were over them.\r\n\r\nThe tide of public opinion is setting so strongly in favor of the use of\r\nnegroes as soldiers, that the present danger seems to lie in the\r\ndirection of our indulging in too extravagant expectations of their\r\nefficiency. We must not overlook the fact that, in the case of the\r\nformer slaves, as much depends upon the character of their officers as\r\nupon the valor of the men. Nor should it be forgotten that among the\r\nfreedmen who come within our lines, there is only a small proportion of\r\nable-bodied men capable of enduring the hardships of the service. In too\r\nmany instances slavery has sapped the vigor of their lives, and the\r\nexaminations of our surgeons have revealed an extent of physical\r\nweakness which is truly surprising. There can, however, no longer be any\r\ndoubt in the minds of candid and loyal men, that the freedmen who are\r\nable to bear arms will prove themselves valiant soldiers, jealous\r\ndefenders of their own and their country's liberties, and a terror to\r\ntheir enemies, who have so madly attempted to destroy both 'Liberty and\r\nUnion.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SPIRIT'S REPROACH.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I stood beside the altar with a friend,\r\n    To hear him plight his faith to a young bride,\r\n    A rosy child of simple heart and mind.\r\n    Yet two short years before, on that same spot,\r\n    I heard the funeral chant above the bier\r\n    Of a first wife--a woman bright as fair,\r\n    Or blessed or cursed with genius, full of fire--\r\n    Who loved him with a passion high and rare;\r\n    Whom he had won from paths of fame and art\r\n    To walk unknown life's quiet ways with him.\r\n    My mind was with the past, when the loud swell\r\n    Of music rose to greet the childlike bride,\r\n    The organ quivering as with solemn joy:\r\n    Alas! another voice breathed through it all,\r\n    Reproachful, haughty, wild, but very sad;\r\n    Near, though its tones fell from that farthest shore,\r\n    Where the eternal surge beats time no more!\r\n    Sadly I gazed upon my friend, to mark\r\n    If his new joys were quelled by the weird strains:\r\n    He heard it not--he only saw the face,\r\n    Blushing and girlish, 'neath its bridal veil;\r\n    Saw not the stronger spirit standing by,\r\n    With immortelles upon its massive front,\r\n    And drooping wings adown its snowy shroud,\r\n    And sense of wrong dewing its starry eye;\r\n    Nor heard the chant of agony, reproach,\r\n    Chilling the naïve joy of the marriage song.\r\n\r\n       *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n    'Say, canst thou woo another for thy bride,\r\n    Whilst I am living--ever near thee still!\r\n    Renounce the faith so often pledged to me,\r\n    Forget me, while I dream of thee in heaven!\r\n    When the word _love_ first fell upon my ear,\r\n    I was a dreamer wrapped in pleasant thoughts,\r\n    Dwelling in themes apart from common life,\r\n    Nor needed aught for bliss save my still hours,\r\n    My studies, and the poet's golden lyre.\r\n    The stars revealed to me their trackless paths,\r\n    The flowers whispered me their secrets sweet,\r\n    And science oped her ways of calm and light.\r\n    Yet love, like ancient scroll, was closely rolled;\r\n    I had no wish to read its mystic page;\r\n    Its wooing wakened in me wondering scorn,\r\n    Its homage insult to my virgin pride;\r\n    If lovers knelt, 'twas but to be denied.\r\n\r\n    And yet it pleased to know myself so fair,\r\n    Because I loved the Beautiful. We met!\r\n    Dark, fierce, and full of power thy features were,\r\n    Yet finely cut, chiselled and sculptured well,\r\n    Reminding me of antique demigod.\r\n    The dream of the wild Greek, maddened with light\r\n    From Beauty's sun, before me living stood.\r\n    Ah! not of marble were thy features pale!\r\n    Like summer's lightning, lights and shadows danced\r\n    As feelings surged within thy stormful soul.\r\n    Full of high thoughts and poetry wert thou:\r\n    I left the paths of thought to hear thee speak\r\n    Of love and its devotion, endless truth.\r\n    All nature glowed with sudden, roseate light;\r\n    The waves of ocean, mountains, forests dim,\r\n    The waterfall, the flower, the clinging moss,\r\n    Were woven in types of purity and peace,\r\n    To etherealize and beautify thy love.\r\n    Marriage of souls, eternal constancy,\r\n    Gave wildering love new worth and dignity.\r\n    My maiden pride was soothed, and if I felt\r\n    Repelled by human passion, still I joyed\r\n    In sacrifice that made me wholly thine.\r\n    We wedded--and I rested on thy heart,\r\n    Counted its throbs, and when I sadly thought\r\n    They measured out the fleeting sands of life,\r\n    I smiled at Time--_Love lives eternally!_\r\n    I was not blind to my advantages,\r\n    Yet I became a humble household dove,\r\n    Smoothing to thy caress the eager wings\r\n    Which might have borne me through the universe.\r\n    All wealth seemed naught; had stars been in my gift,\r\n    I would have thrown them reckless all to thee!\r\n    Two happy years--how swift they fleeted by!--\r\n    And then I felt a fluttering, restless life\r\n    Throbbing beneath my heart; and with it knew\r\n    (I ne'er could tell you how such knowledge came)\r\n    That I must die! A moment's dread and pang\r\n    O'ercame me--then the bitter thought grew sweet:\r\n    My passing agony would win the boon\r\n    Of life immortal for _our_ infant's soul;\r\n    The innocent being, through whose veins would flow\r\n    Our mingling hearts for ever--ever--one!\r\n    We spoke of death, and of eternal life;\r\n    Many and fond the vows then pledged to me:\r\n    'If cruel death must sever us on earth,\r\n    Rest calmly on my never-changing love;\r\n    Now and forever it is solely thine!\r\n    _Thou art my soul's elect--my Bride in Heaven!_'\r\n\r\n    So deeply did I trust thy plighted faith,\r\n    I nerved my ardent soul to bear it all,\r\n    And calmly saw the fated hour approach,\r\n    Nor quailed before the pangs of death to give\r\n    Our living love to a fond father's kiss:\r\n    Smiling I placed him in thy arms--then died.\r\n    The songs of angels wooed me high above,\r\n    But my firm soul refused to leave its loves!\r\n    I won the boon from heaven to hover near,\r\n    To count the palpitations of thy heart,\r\n    And speak, unseen, to thee in varied ways.\r\n    I breathed to thee in music's plaintive tones,\r\n    I floated round thee in the breath of flowers,\r\n    I wooed thee in the poet's tender page,\r\n    And through the blue eyes of our orphaned child\r\n    I gazed upon thee with the buried love\r\n    So fraught with faith and haunting memories.\r\n    With spirit power I ranged the world of thought\r\n    To twine thee with the blue 'Forget me not!'\r\n\r\n       *   *   *   *\r\n\r\n    Oh, God! thine eye seeks now a fresher face,\r\n    Thy voice has won another's earnest love,\r\n    Her head rests on the heart once pledged to me,\r\n    And I have poured my worship on the dust!\r\n    He loves again, and yet I gave him all--\r\n    Been proud--is this 'the worm that never dies?'\r\n    Ah, what am I?--a ruined wreck adrift\r\n    Upon a surging sea of endless pain!\r\n    Are human hearts all fickle, faithless, base?\r\n    Does levity brand all of mortal race?\r\n    When we shall meet within the Spirit's land,\r\n    How wilt thou bear my sorrow, my despair?\r\n    Wilt strive to teach me there thy new-found lore--\r\n    Forgetfulness?

ROBERT J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n    LONDON, 10, Half Moon Street, Piccadilly,\r\n\r\n                                    _June 30th, 1863._\r\n\r\nSoon after my arrival in London from New York, my attention was called,\r\nby some English, as well as American friends, to an article which had\r\nappeared more than a month previously in the London _Times_ of the 23d\r\nof March last. In the money article of that date is the following letter\r\nfrom the Hon. John Slidell, the Minister of Jefferson Davis at Paris.\r\n\r\n     'MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n     I have yours of yesterday. I am inclined to think the people of\r\n     London confound Mr. Reuben Davis, whom I have always understood\r\n     to have taken the lead on the question of repudiation, with\r\n     President Jefferson Davis. I am not aware that the latter was\r\n     in any way identified with that question. I am very confident\r\n     that it was not agitated during his canvass for Governor, or\r\n     during his administration. The Union Bank bonds were issued in\r\n     direct violation of an express constitutional provision. There\r\n     is a wide difference between these bonds, and those of the\r\n     Planters' Bank, for the repudiation of which, neither excuse\r\n     nor palliation can be offered. I feel confident that Jefferson\r\n     Davis never approved or justified that repudiation. What may\r\n     have been his private opinions of the refusal to consider the\r\n     State of Mississippi bound to provide for the payment of the\r\n     Union Bank bonds, I do not know.\r\n\r\n                                        Yours truly,\r\n\r\n                                          'JOHN SLIDELL.'\r\n\r\nIt is due to the editor of the _Times_ here to state, that, in his money\r\narticle of the 23d March last, he refers to the controversy of that\r\npress with Jefferson Davis on that question in 1849, and, as regards the\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Slidell, that it might have been Reuben Davis who was\r\nthe repudiator in 1849, instead of Jefferson Davis, the editor remarked,\r\n'it is to be feared that the proof in the other direction is too\r\nstrong.' Indeed, the editor might well be astonished at the supposition\r\nthat Jefferson Davis, who subscribed the repudiation letter in question\r\nof the 25th May, 1849, as well as a still stronger communication of the\r\n29th August, 1849, should have been confounded, during a period of near\r\nfourteen years, by the press of Europe and America, with Reuben Davis,\r\nand that the supposed mistake should just now be discovered, especially\r\nas Reuben Davis never was a Senator of the United States from\r\nMississippi, or from any other State.\r\n\r\nI was asked if it really was Reuben or Jefferson Davis who was the\r\nauthor of the letter in question advocating the repudiation of the Union\r\nBank bonds of Mississippi, their recollection being, that it was the\r\nlatter. I said that the repudiation letter in question of the 25th May,\r\n1849, was subscribed and published at its date in the Washington\r\n_Union_, by Jefferson Davis, as a Senator of the United States from\r\nMississippi, which position he then held, that he was personally well\r\nknown to me for nearly a fourth of a century, as was also Reuben Davis,\r\nand that the latter never had been a Senator of the United States from\r\nMississippi, or any other State, as was well known to me, and would be\r\nshown by reference to the Journals of the United States Senate. I\r\nstated, that I had represented the State of Mississippi in the Senate of\r\nthe United States from January, 1836, until March, 1845, when, having\r\nresigned that office, I was called to the Cabinet of President Polk, as\r\nSecretary of the Treasury of the United States, and remained in that\r\nposition until the close of that administration in March, 1849. I added,\r\nthat I was in Washington City, the capital of the Union, and residing\r\nthere as a counsellor at law in the Supreme Court of the United States,\r\nwhen the first repudiation letter of Jefferson Davis, communicated by\r\nhim to the editor of the _Union_ (a newspaper of that city), was\r\npublished, on the 25th May, 1849, in that print, and very generally\r\nthroughout the United States. It was remarked by me, that it was well\r\nknown to myself personally, and I believed to every prominent public man\r\nof that date, especially those then in Washington, that Mr. Jefferson\r\nDavis was the author of that letter then published over his signature,\r\nand that he defended its doctrines, with all that earnestness and\r\nability for which he was so distinguished. I was also residing in\r\nWashington, when Mr. Jefferson Davis published, over his signature, as a\r\nSenator of the United States from Mississippi, his well-known second\r\nrepudiation letter, dated at his _residence_, 'Brierfield, Miss.,'\r\nAugust 29, 1849. This letter was addressed to the editors of the\r\n_Mississippian_, a newspaper published at Jackson, Mississippi, and was\r\nreceived by me in due course of mail. This letter extended over several\r\ncolumns, and was an elaborate defence of the repudiation of Mississippi.\r\nThis letter also was generally republished throughout the United States.\r\nThese views of Mr. Jefferson Davis attracted my most earnest attention,\r\nbecause, after a brief interval, he was one of my successors in the\r\nSenate of the United States, from Mississippi. I had always earnestly\r\nopposed the doctrine of repudiation in Mississippi, and the Legislature\r\nof 1840-'41, by which I was re-elected, passed resolutions by\r\noverwhelming majorities (hereafter quoted), denouncing the repudiation\r\neither of the Union Bank, or Planters' Bank bonds.\r\n\r\nAt the period of the conversations before referred to, late in April or\r\nearly in May last, I was, on this recital of the facts, strongly urged\r\nto make them known in Europe, to which my consent was given.\r\n\r\nAfter some investigation, however, the necessary documents fully to\r\nelucidate the whole subject could not be obtained here. It was\r\nnecessary, therefore, to write home and procure them. This has been\r\ndone, and I now proceed to a narrative of these transactions from the\r\nauthentic historical public documents.\r\n\r\nThe first letter of Mr. Jefferson Davis before referred to, of the 25th\r\nof May, 1849, was published by him as a Senator of the United States\r\nfrom Mississippi, over his signature, in the _Union_, a newspaper\r\npublished at Washington City. That letter is in these words:\r\n\r\n     'DAILY UNION, WASHINGTON CITY, _May 25th, 1849_.\r\n\r\n    '_Statement furnished by Jefferson Davis,\r\n      Esq., Senator of the United States._\r\n\r\n     'The State of Mississippi has no other question with\r\n     bondholders than that of debt or no debt. When the United\r\n     States Bank of Pennsylvania purchased what are known as the\r\n     Union Bank bonds, it was within the power of any stock dealer\r\n     to learn that they had been issued in disregard of the\r\n     Constitution of the State whose faith they assumed to pledge.\r\n     By the Constitution and laws of Mississippi, any creditor of\r\n     the State may bring suit against the State, and test his claim,\r\n     as against an individual. To this the bondholders have been\r\n     invited; but conscious that they have no valid claim, have not\r\n     sought their remedy. Relying upon empty (because false)\r\n     denunciation, they have made it a point of honor to show what\r\n     can be shown by judicial investigation; i. e., that there being\r\n     no debt, there has been no default. The crocodile tears which\r\n     have been shed over ruined creditors, are on a par with the\r\n     baseless denunciations which have been heaped upon the State.\r\n     Those bonds were purchased by a bank then tottering to its\r\n     fall--purchased in violation of the charter of the bank, or\r\n     fraudulently, by concealing the transaction under the name of\r\n     an individual, as may best suit those concerned--purchased in\r\n     violation of the terms of the law under which the bonds were\r\n     issued, and in disregard of the Constitution of Mississippi, of\r\n     which the law was an infraction. To sustain the credit of that\r\n     rickety bank, the bonds were hypothecated abroad for interest\r\n     on loans which could not be met as they became due.\r\n\r\n     'A smaller amount is due for what are termed Planters' Bank\r\n     bonds of Mississippi. These evidences of debt, as well as the\r\n     coupons issued to cover accruing interest, are receivable for\r\n     State lands; and no one has a right to assume they will not be\r\n     provided for otherwise, by or before the date at which the\r\n     whole debt becomes due.\r\n\r\n                                      'JEFFERSON DAVIS.'\r\n\r\nTo this letter the London _Times_, in its money article, of the 13th\r\nJuly, 1849, replied as follows:\r\n\r\n     'The case of Mississippi stands thus: In 1838 the State issued\r\n     bonds for five millions of dollars, to establish the Union\r\n     Bank. These bonds were dated June, 1838, bearing five per cent.\r\n     interest from date, and it was stipulated with the bank that\r\n     they should not be sold under their par value. On the 18th\r\n     August following, the bank sold all these bonds to the United\r\n     States Bank for five millions of dollars, payable in five equal\r\n     instalments in November, January, March, May, and July, but\r\n     without interest. The money was punctually paid to the\r\n     Mississippi Bank, and the Legislature of Mississippi, on the\r\n     terms of the sale being communicated to them, resolved, _'That\r\n     the sale of the bonds was highly advantageous to the State, and\r\n     in accordance with the injunctions of the charter, reflecting\r\n     the highest credit on the Commissioners, and bringing timely\r\n     aid to an embarrassed community.'_ In little more than two\r\n     years, however, the Mississippi Bank became totally insolvent,\r\n     having lost the entire five millions invested in it by the\r\n     State. Immediately on this having transpired, the Governor of\r\n     the State sent a message to the Legislature recommending them\r\n     to _repudiate_ (this was the first time the word was used)\r\n     their obligations, being founded on the plea, that as the bonds\r\n     were issued with interest payable from the date, and they had\r\n     been sold to the United States Bank for their nominal amount\r\n     only, the stipulation that they should not be disposed of below\r\n     their par value had been departed from. He further urged that\r\n     although the bonds had been sold ostensibly to Mr. Biddle, the\r\n     president of the United States Bank, the sale was actually to\r\n     the bank itself, which, by its charter, could not legally\r\n     purchase them. Hence, although Mississippi had received the\r\n     money for the bonds, it was thus proposed to refuse to repay\r\n     it, on the ground that the purchaser had no right to buy them.\r\n     The Legislature, however, was not quite prepared for this, and\r\n     accordingly, in responding to the Governor's message, they\r\n     resolved: '1st. That the State of Mississippi is bound to the\r\n     holders of the bonds of the State sold on account of the bank\r\n     for the amount of principal and interest. 2d. That the State of\r\n     Mississippi will pay her bonds, and preserve her faith\r\n     inviolate. 3d. That the insinuation that the State of\r\n     Mississippi would repudiate her bonds and violate her plighted\r\n     faith, is a calumny upon the justice, honor, and dignity of the\r\n     State.' But after this, the pecuniary condition of the State\r\n     became rapidly worse, and the disposition to pay diminished in\r\n     proportion. Accordingly a joint committee of the Legislature\r\n     appointed in 1842, reported that the State was not bound to pay\r\n     the bonds, advancing the reasons before mentioned, and also\r\n     another, namely, that the bonds had not been sanctioned in the\r\n     manner required by the Constitution, since, although the\r\n     provision that no loan should be raised, unless sanctioned by a\r\n     law passed through two successive Legislatures, had been\r\n     complied with, and the bonds had been legally authorized, the\r\n     act also prescribed certain conditions regarding the Bank of\r\n     Mississippi, which conditions had been altered by a subsequent\r\n     act, that had only passed through one Legislature.\r\n\r\n     'In addition to the five millions thus repudiated, Mississippi\r\n     owes two millions which she recognizes. It has always, however,\r\n     been a difference without distinction, since she pays no\r\n     dividends on either. From the period of repudiation up to the\r\n     present moment, all representations of the bondholders have\r\n     been treated with disregard. About a year and a half back,\r\n     however, one of the citizens of Mississippi, a Mr. Robbins,\r\n     admitted the moral liability of the State, and proposed that\r\n     the people should discharge it by voluntary contributions.\r\n\r\n     'The next step is the appearance of the letter from Mr.\r\n     Jefferson Davis, with whom we are now called upon to deal. This\r\n     statement, which was transmitted by him to the Washington\r\n     _Union_, in reply to our remarks of the 23d February last, runs\r\n     as follows.'\r\n\r\nHere the _Times_ inserts Mr. Jefferson Davis's repudiation letter before\r\nquoted.\r\n\r\n     'The assurance in this statement that the Planters' Bank, or\r\n     non-repudiated bonds, are receivable for State lands, requires\r\n     this addition, which Mr. Jefferson Davis has omitted, that they\r\n     are only so receivable upon lands being taken at three times\r\n     its current value. The affirmation afterward, that no one has a\r\n     right to assume that these bonds will not be fully provided for\r\n     before the date at which the principal falls due, is simply to\r\n     be met by the fact that portions of them fell due in 1841 and\r\n     1846, and that on these, as well as on all the rest, both\r\n     principal and interest remain wholly unpaid.\r\n\r\n     'Regarding the first part of the statement no comment could be\r\n     made which would not weaken its effect. Taking its principle\r\n     and its tone together, it is a doctrine which has never been\r\n     paralleled. Let it circulate throughout Europe, that a member\r\n     of the United States Senate in 1849, has openly proclaimed that\r\n     at a recent period the Governor and Legislative Assemblies of\r\n     his own State deliberately issued fraudulent bonds for five\r\n     millions of dollars to 'sustain the credit of a rickety bank;'\r\n     that the bonds in question, having been hypothecated abroad to\r\n     innocent holders, such holders had not only no claim against\r\n     the community by whose executive and representatives this act\r\n     was omitted, but that they are to be taunted for appealing to\r\n     the verdict of the civilized world, rather than to the judgment\r\n     of the legal officers of the State by whose functionaries they\r\n     have been already robbed; and that the ruin of toilworn men, of\r\n     women, of widows, and of children, and the 'crocodile tears'\r\n     which that ruin has occasioned, is a subject of jest on the\r\n     part of those by whom it has been accomplished; and then let it\r\n     be asked if any foreigner ever penned a libel on the American\r\n     character equal to that against the people of Mississippi by\r\n     their own Senator.'\r\n\r\nTo this reply of the London _Times_, which (except in portions of\r\nMississippi) was generally approved throughout the Union, Mr. Jefferson\r\nDavis responded in a very long letter, dated from his residence,\r\nBrierfield, Mississippi, August 29, 1849, addressed to the editors of\r\nthe _Mississippian_. He begins as follows:\r\n\r\n     'The London _Times_ of July 13, 1849, contains an article which\r\n     most unjustly and unfairly attacks the State of Mississippi and\r\n     myself, because of a statement I made in refutation of a\r\n     former calumny against her, which was published in the same\r\n     paper.'\r\n\r\nThis article of the London _Times_ Mr. Davis denounces as 'a\r\n_foreigner's slander_ against the government, the judiciary, and people\r\nof Mississippi;' 'very well for the high Tory paper as an attack upon\r\nour republican government;' as 'untrue;' 'the hypocritical cant of\r\nstockjobbers and _pensioned presses_' 'reckless of reputation;' 'hired\r\nadvocates of the _innocent_ stock dealers of London 'Change;' 'a\r\ncalumnious imputation.' These are pleasant epithets which Mr. Jefferson\r\nDavis applied to the London _Times_ and the London 'Change. But Mr.\r\nJefferson Davis was very indignant, not only with London, but with all\r\nEngland; for he says,\r\n\r\n     'With far more propriety might _repudiation_ be charged on the\r\n     _English Government_, for the reduction of interest on her\r\n     loans when she consolidated her debts; for the income tax,\r\n     which compels fundholders to return part of the interest they\r\n     receive on their evidences of public debt, for the support of\r\n     the Government which is their debtor.'\r\n\r\nAccording, then, to Mr. Jefferson Davis, the London _Times_ and the\r\nLondon 'Change are great reprobates, and it is not Mississippi, but 'THE\r\nENGLISH GOVERNMENT' which has repudiated their own public debt.\r\n\r\nFrom such angry epithets and fierce denunciation, the reader will be\r\nprepared to find very little argument in Mr. Jefferson Davis' second\r\nletter. He denies that Mississippi received the money. But a bank, of\r\nwhich she was the sole stockholder, and whose directory was all\r\nappointed by her, received it. They received it also for her exclusive\r\nbenefit, for she, _as a State_, was to derive large profits on the stock\r\nof the bank, which was hers exclusively, and was paid for entirely by\r\nthe proceeds of these bonds. Mississippi then, as a State, through her\r\nagents appointed by her, received this money. All governments must act\r\nthrough human agency, and the agency in this case, which received the\r\nmoney, was appointed entirely by the State. But this is not all. The\r\nBank, which was exclusively a State bank, and based entirely on the\r\nproceeds of these State bonds, with no other stockholders, was directed\r\nby the charter to loan this money, the proceeds of these bonds, only to\r\n'the citizens of the State,' sec. 46, and so the loans were made. The\r\nState, then, through an agency appointed exclusively by itself, received\r\nthis money, the proceeds of the State bonds, and the State, through this\r\nsame agency, loaned this money to 'the citizens of the State,' who never\r\nrepaid the loans. The State then received the money and loaned it out to\r\nits own citizens, who still hold it; and yet this money, obtained on the\r\nsolemn pledge of the faith of the State, her citizens still hold, and\r\nthe State repudiates her bonds on which the money was received, and Mr.\r\nJefferson Davis sustains, indorses, and eulogizes this proceeding. Never\r\nwas there a stronger case.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson Davis reiterates in this letter his arguments contained in\r\nhis previous communication of the 25th May, 1849, so fully answered by\r\nthe editors of the London _Times_ in their money article before quoted\r\nof the 13th July, 1849. He elaborates, particularly, the legal position,\r\nthat the bonds were invalid, because he says not sanctioned by two\r\nsuccessive Legislatures as required by the Constitution of Mississippi.\r\nThis statement is erroneous, because the loan, in the precise form in\r\nwhich the bonds were issued, was sanctioned by two successive\r\nLegislatures in perfect conformity with the Constitution. This is shown,\r\nas will be proved hereafter, by reference to the laws passed by the\r\nState, and such was the decision on this very point by the highest\r\njudicial tribunal of Mississippi, in 1842 and 1853. But let us suppose\r\nthat there was some technical legal informality as to the law, would\r\nthat justify the repudiation of these bonds? The Legislature had passed\r\nlaws in 1837 and 1838 authorizing the issue and sale of these bonds,\r\nthose acts had been all signed and approved by the Governor of the\r\nState, the bonds had been signed by the Governor and Treasurer of the\r\nState, the broad seal of the State had been affixed to them by the\r\nGovernor, they were placed in the hands of the authorities of the State\r\nfor sale, they were sold by them, and the full amount paid over to the\r\nagency appointed by the State, and by that agency the money was loaned\r\nto the 'citizens of the State' and still retained by them. When the sale\r\nof these State bonds in August, 1838, together with all the facts and\r\ndocuments, were placed by the Governor before the Legislature in 1839,\r\nthey ratified and highly approved the sale, as before quoted by the\r\n_Times_, and again still more decidedly in 1841. And yet the State, on\r\nthe technical grounds stated by Mr. Davis, repudiated their bonds. It\r\nwas unconstitutional to return the money which they had borrowed and\r\nused! Could anything be more absurd or dishonorable than this? The law\r\nsays, if a man borrows money without certain legal authentications, he\r\nshall not be forced to repay; but if he receives and uses the money, and\r\nthen interposes such technical pleas, he is justly deemed infamous. He\r\nhas violated his honor. And is the honor of an individual more sacred\r\nthan that of a state or nation? State and national debts rest upon\r\nfaith, they repose upon honor, the obligation is sacred, and must be\r\nfulfilled. It can never he illegal or unconstitutional to _pay a debt_,\r\nwhere the money has been received by a state or a nation. And, where a\r\nState, acting through its supreme Executive and Legislature, has issued\r\nits bonds and affixed its seal, and they have passed into the hands of\r\n_bona fide_ holders, the obligation must be fulfilled. For a state or\r\nnation, having issued its bonds under its highest legislative and\r\nexecutive sanction, to say, that their own functionaries mistook some of\r\nthe formalities of the law, and refuse payments, is a fraud upon the\r\n_bona fide_ holders, and can never be sustained before the tribunal of\r\nthe world. But when, besides the Legislature and Executive of the State,\r\nits highest judicial tribunals have declared the bonds perfectly\r\nconstitutional and valid, and to have been sold in accordance with the\r\nterms of the law, for such repudiation of such bonds it is difficult to\r\nfind any language sufficiently strong to mark the infamy of such a\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\nIf indeed the formalities of the Constitution had not been complied\r\nwith, and this were not a mere pretext, how easy would it have been to\r\nhave passed a new act in conformity with the constitutional formalities,\r\nassuming the debt, or providing for the issue of new bonds to be\r\ndelivered to the holders on the return of those alleged to be informal.\r\nBut the truth is, this alleged unconstitutionality was a mere pretext\r\nfor repudiating a just debt: it never occurred to the Legislatures which\r\npassed these laws in 1837 and 1838, or to the Governor, who signed them,\r\nand was rejected by the Legislature in 1839, and again, in the most\r\nsolemn form, in 1841.\r\n\r\nAnd now let me trace the history of this transaction chronologically.\r\nThe original act chartering the bank, with the 5th section authorizing\r\nthe loan, was passed by the Legislature January 21st, 1837, and again,\r\nin strict compliance with the provisions of the Constitution, reënacted\r\nin the same words on the 5th of February, 1838. Now the bonds issued are\r\nin strict conformity with this law, and an exact copy of the form of the\r\nbonds prescribed by the law. If then, the supplemental act of the 15th\r\nFebruary, 1838, was unconstitutional, null, and void, as contended by\r\nthe repudiators, then the whole original act remained in full force, and\r\nthe bonds were valid under that law, and such was the unanimous decision\r\nof the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi, as will be shown\r\nhereafter. It was contended before the court (and by Mr. Davis in his\r\nlast letter) that, under the original law, certain acts were to be\r\nperformed before the bonds could issue. But here again, it is plain on\r\nthe face of the law, and so the High Court of Errors and Appeals of\r\nMississippi unanimously decided, that these acts were not required to be\r\nperformed as _conditions precedent_ to the issue of the bonds, and that\r\nthe issue and sale of the bonds were perfectly valid before these acts\r\nhad been performed. The bonds then are in exact conformity with a law,\r\nwhich was passed by two successive Legislatures, precisely as provided\r\nby the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn 1836 there was a great pecuniary embarrassment in Mississippi,\r\nattributed by many to what was called the _specie circular_, and soon\r\nfollowed a suspension of the banks. Under these circumstances there was\r\nan almost universal demand in Mississippi for relief measures. As a\r\nconsequence, the attention of the Legislature was absorbed almost\r\nexclusively in the consideration of remedies for the existing\r\nembarrassments. The result was the enactment, on the 21st January, 1837,\r\nof the law, creating the Union Bank of Mississippi. This bank was based\r\nupon loans to be obtained upon bonds of the State, the proceeds of\r\nwhich, when sold, were to constitute the capital of the bank, which\r\nmoney, by the terms of the charter, was to be loaned to the '_citizens\r\nof the State_,' to relieve the existing embarrassments.\r\n\r\nThe fifth section of the act was the only one in which any authority was\r\ngiven for a loan by the State, and any power to pledge its faith. That\r\nsection, entire, was as follows:\r\n\r\n     'That, in order to facilitate the said Union Bank for the said\r\n     loan of fifteen millions five hundred thousand dollars, the\r\n     faith of this State be, and is hereby pledged, both for the\r\n     security of the capital and interest, and that 7,500 bonds of\r\n     $1,000 each, to wit: 1,875 payable in twelve years; 1,875 in\r\n     fifteen years; 1,875 in eighteen years; and 1,875 in twenty\r\n     years, and bearing interest at the rate of five per cent. per\r\n     annum, shall be signed by the Governor of the State to the\r\n     order of the Mississippi Bank, countersigned by the State\r\n     Treasurer, and under the seal of the State; said bonds to be in\r\n     the following words, viz.:\r\n\r\n     '$2,000. Know all men by these presents, that the State of\r\n     Mississippi _acknowledges to be indebted_ to the Mississippi\r\n     Union Bank in the sum of two thousand dollars, which sum the\r\n     said State of Mississippi _promises to pay_ in current money of\r\n     the United States to the order of the President, Directors, and\r\n     Company in the ---- year ----with interest at the rate of five\r\n     per cent. per annum, payable half yearly, at the place named in\r\n     the indorsement hereto, viz.: ---- on the ---- of every year\r\n     until the payment of the said principal sum: in testimony\r\n     whereof the Governor of the State of Mississippi has signed,\r\n     and the Treasurer of the State has countersigned these\r\n     presents, and caused the seal of the State to be affixed\r\n     thereto, at Jackson, this ---- in the ---- year of our Lord.\r\n\r\n                                             '_Governor._\r\n\r\n                                             '_Treasurer._'\r\n\r\nThe whole act, of which this section was a part, was passed by the\r\nLegislature and approved by the Governor in 1837, and the entire section\r\nas to the loan as required by the provision of the Constitution of the\r\nState, was referred to the action of the next succeeding Legislature.\r\nThat succeeding Legislature was chosen in November, 1837, and assembled,\r\nat its regular session, in January, 1838. After full discussion in both\r\nhouses, this act of 1837 was passed by large majorities in both branches\r\nof the Legislature, and approved by the new Governor, A. G. McNutt, on\r\nthe 5th of February, 1838. The act of 1837, including the 5th section,\r\nbefore quoted, was thus reënacted by the succeeding Legislature, without\r\nany change whatever. There was then a full, complete, and undisputed\r\ncompliance with the requirements of the Constitution, and, under this\r\nact, thus sanctioned by two successive Legislatures, it is conceded that\r\nthe faith of the State was pledged, and that the bonds might be issued\r\nand sold. But it is contended by Mr. Jefferson Davis in his first, as\r\nwell as his second letter, before quoted, that the bonds are invalid,\r\nbecause of the supplemental act of the 15th of February, 1838. Now, it\r\nwill be observed, that no change whatever was made by this supplemental\r\nact, in this 5th section of the original act, before quoted, by which\r\nalone the faith of the State was pledged for the payment of these bonds,\r\nand which section alone, as required by the Constitution, had been\r\nreferred to the action of the succeeding Legislature. No change whatever\r\nwas made by the supplemental act in that section of the original act,\r\nthe bonds were issued and sold in precise conformity with its\r\nprovisions, and, indeed, these bonds, thus actually issued and sold, are\r\na precise and literal copy of the form of the bonds as given in the\r\noriginal act, as before quoted. The supplemental act changed only some\r\nof the '_details_' of the charter of the Bank, but made no alteration\r\nwhatever in the 5th section. This supplemental act, which is now\r\ndenounced by Jefferson Davis as unconstitutional, was passed, after the\r\nfullest investigation of this question, as to the power of the\r\nLegislature, with favorable reports as to the constitutional power by\r\nthe joint Committee of both Houses. The Committee reported to the\r\nSenate, that, by a 'supplemental bill' 'it is competent for this\r\nLegislature to alter and amend the details of the bill, incorporating\r\nthe subscribers to the Mississippi Union Bank, passed at the last\r\nsession of the Legislature of this State.' (Senate Journal, 103.)\r\n\r\nThe report of the Committee to the House was as follows: 'The said\r\nCommittee are of the opinion, that it is within the province of the\r\nLegislature to amend or change the details of the said Mississippi Union\r\nBank Charter,' &c. (House Journal, p. 117.) Such was the opinion of the\r\njoint Committee of both Houses of the Legislature, which reported this\r\nsupplemental act, which act was passed by the vote of 22 to 3 in the\r\nSenate (Journal, 320), and 55 to 22 in the House. (Journal, 329-30.) It\r\nwould appear, then, that in the opinion of an overwhelming majority of\r\nboth branches of the Legislature of Mississippi, the supplemental act\r\nwas constitutional; and the act was approved by A. G. McNutt, the\r\nGovernor of the State, and thus became a law on the 15th of February,\r\n1838. Indeed, the idea that a subsequent Legislature could change none\r\nof the details of a bank charter, because there was embodied in the act\r\na separate and distinct section authorizing a loan of money by the\r\nState, seemed to me never to rise to the dignity of a question. Such, we\r\nhave seen, was the view of the Legislatures of 1838, 1839, and 1841, and\r\nsuch was the unanimous decision, hereafter quoted, of the Chancellor and\r\nCircuit Judge of Mississippi, and of the supreme judicial tribunal, the\r\nHigh Court of Errors and Appeals of the State, in two decisions, on this\r\nvery point, and in favor of the constitutionality of this law. One of\r\nthese decisions was made in January, 1842, and the other in April, 1853.\r\nThese decisions were conclusive against the State, and binding upon the\r\nLegislature, the Governor, and the people, for the following reasons.\r\nThe Constitution of the State of Mississippi contains the following\r\nclause:\r\n\r\n     'ARTICLE II. _Distribution of Powers._\r\n\r\n     'Sec. 1. The powers of the Government of the State of\r\n     Mississippi shall be divided into three distinct departments,\r\n     and each of them confided to a separate body of magistracy; to\r\n     wit, those which are legislative to one, those which are\r\n     judicial to another, and those which are executive to another.\r\n\r\n     'Sec. 2. No person or collection of persons, being of one of\r\n     these departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging\r\n     to either of the others, except in the instances hereinafter\r\n     expressly directed or permitted.'\r\n\r\nIt is not pretended that any exception was made for this case. The\r\ncontrary has always been held by the courts of Mississippi. Indeed, as\r\nlate as October term, 1858, this very question was decided by the High\r\nCourt of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi, when it was ruled by the\r\ncourt that 'the Legislature may not, therefore, exercise powers which in\r\ntheir nature are judicial.' (Isom. _v._ Missis. R. R. Co., 7 George\r\n314.)\r\n\r\nIn the 9th section of the 7th article of the Constitution of Mississippi\r\nis found the provision on which Mr. Jefferson Davis relies requiring the\r\nassent of two successive Legislatures to pledge the faith of the State.\r\nImmediately succeeding this provision is the following: 'The Legislature\r\n_shall direct_ by law in what courts suits may be brought against the\r\nState.'\r\n\r\nThese two consecutive sections of the _same article_ of the\r\nConstitution, being in _pari materia_, are to be construed together.\r\nIndeed, it is a well known historical fact, that this 9th section, as\r\nregards the pledge of the faith of the State, which is now perverted to\r\na wholly different purpose, was intended to give greater solemnity and a\r\nhigher credit to the bonds of the State, as was likewise the provision\r\nin the same Constitution of 1832, sanctioning by name the Planters' Bank\r\nbonds of the State (now unpaid), in consequence of which, they were sold\r\nat a premium of thirteen and a half per cent. In pursuance of the\r\nprovision of the Constitution before quoted, the Legislature of\r\nMississippi, in 1833, passed an act, designating the Court of Chancery\r\nas the one in which suits might be brought against the State, with the\r\nright of appeal by either party to the High Court of Errors and Appeals.\r\nThat act was passed in 1833, in pursuance of this _mandatory_ provision\r\nof the Constitution before quoted. That act provided, that, if the\r\ndecree of the court should be against the State, the Governor _shall\r\nissue_ his mandate to the Auditor to draw on the Treasurer to pay the\r\ndecree, but 'no execution whatever shall ever issue on any decree in\r\nchancery against the State of Mississippi, whereby the State may be\r\ndispossessed of lands, tenements, goods and chattels.' (Howard's Dig.\r\n523, 524.)\r\n\r\nHere, then, are the two consecutive provisions of the Constitution in\r\n_pari materia_, the one designating the mode by which the bonds of the\r\nState might be issued, and the other the judicial tribunals in which all\r\ndisputes as to such bonds might be _definitively_ settled, and payment\r\nmade, if the decree were against the State. That Constitution vested the\r\n_whole judicial power of the State_ in the courts, it vested nothing but\r\n'legislative power' in the Legislature, and it prohibited the\r\nLegislature and Executive from exercising judicial power; it adopted the\r\ngreat fundamental principle of constitutional government, separating the\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial power. Indeed, it is the great\r\ndoctrine of American law, that the concentration of any of these two\r\npowers, in any one body or functionary, is dangerous to liberty, and\r\nthat the _consolidation_ of all of these powers creates a despotism. The\r\ninterpretation of a law, and particularly of a constitution, which is\r\nmade the 'supreme law,' the _lex legum_, has uniformly been regarded as\r\nexclusively a judicial, and not an executive or legislative function. In\r\nthis case, however, it has been made clear by an express provision of\r\nthe Constitution separating these functions, and designating, under its\r\nmandate, the _courts_ in which _suits_ shall be brought against the\r\nState, and the form of the decree to be rendered, and requiring payment\r\nto be at once made. A suit is a judicial act, and so is the decree of a\r\ncourt. Well, then, the highest judicial tribunals of Mississippi have\r\ntwice decided this question; they have declared this supplemental act\r\nconstitutional, these bonds valid, and the sale of them to be in\r\nconformity with the law; and, in a suit on one of these very bonds,\r\nafter the fullest argument, the court entered a decree of payment,\r\noverruling every point made by Jefferson Davis; and yet the State still\r\nrepudiates, as well after the first decision in 1842, as the second in\r\n1853. It is difficult to imagine a more palpable infraction of the\r\nConstitution, or a clearer violation of every principle of justice than\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe State prescribes certain forms under which her bonds may issue; she\r\nadds to this, in the very _next section_, a provision _commanding_ the\r\nLegislature to designate the judicial tribunals in which suit may be\r\nbrought on such bonds against the State; those tribunals are designated\r\nby the Legislature, namely, the Court of Chancery, with appeal to the\r\nHigh Court of Errors and Appeals of the State; both those tribunals\r\n(including the Chancellor) have unanimously decided against the State,\r\nand a decree is entered for payment of the bonds. And yet the State\r\npersists in repudiation, and Jefferson Davis defends her course. When\r\nthe High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi first decided this\r\nquestion, it was composed of Chief Justice Sharkey, and Justices Turner\r\nand Trotter (one of the framers of the Constitution). When, again, in\r\n1851, suit was brought against the State on one of these repudiated\r\nUnion Bank bonds, and a decree for its payment rendered by the\r\nChancellor, that decree, on full argument on appeal, was unanimously\r\nconfirmed by the highest judicial tribunal of the State, composed\r\nentirely of different judges, namely, Chief Justice Smith, and Justices\r\nYerger and Fisher. Here, then, are eight judges, all chosen by the\r\npeople of Mississippi, concurring in 1842, as well as in 1853, as to the\r\nvalidity of these bonds; and yet Jefferson Davis justifies their\r\nrepudiation. The judges of Mississippi all take an oath to support the\r\nConstitution, and it is made their duty to interpret it, and especially\r\nthis very clause: the Legislature is confined to law making, and\r\nforbidden to exercise any judicial power; the expounding this\r\nsupplemental law, and the provisions under which it was enacted, is\r\nexclusively a judicial power, and yet the Legislature _usurps_ this\r\npower, repudiates the bonds of the State, and the acts of three\r\npreceding Legislatures, and the decision of the highest tribunals of the\r\nState: Jefferson Davis sustains this repudiation, and the British public\r\nare asked to take new Confederate bonds, issued by the same Jefferson\r\nDavis, and thus to sanction, and encourage, and offer a premium for\r\nrepudiation. These so-called Confederate bonds are issued in open\r\nviolation of the Constitution of the United States; they are absolute\r\nnullities, they are tainted with treason, they never can or will be\r\npaid, and yet they are to be thrust on the British public under the\r\nsanction of the same great repudiator, Jefferson Davis, who applauds the\r\nnon-payment of the Mississippi bonds, and thus condemns hundreds of\r\ninnocent holders, including widows and orphans, to want and misery. Talk\r\nabout _faith_, about _honor_, about _justice_, and the _sanctity of\r\ncontracts_. Why, if such flagrant outrages, such atrocious crimes, can\r\nbe sustained by the great public of any nation, small indeed must be the\r\nvalue of their bonds, which rests exclusively on good faith.\r\n\r\nSuppose some astute lawyer could find some informality in the law\r\nauthorizing the issue and sale of the bonds representing the British\r\nconsols; would any member of either House propose in Parliament to\r\nrepudiate such bonds, and would not such a motion cause his immediate\r\nexpulsion? Yet, this is what the Legislature of Mississippi has done,\r\nwhat Jefferson Davis approves and applauds, and what, _he says_, the\r\n'English Government' _has done_.\r\n\r\nThe London _Times_ has heretofore quoted the proceedings of the\r\nLegislature of Mississippi in 1839, approving the sale of these bonds\r\nand eulogizing the transaction. It has also referred to the Message of\r\nGovernor McNutt, of 1841, nearly three years after the sale of the\r\nbonds, first recommending their repudiation, and to the resolutions of\r\nthe Legislature of Mississippi of that date, affirming the legality of\r\nthese bonds and the duty of the State to pay them. As these resolutions\r\nare of great importance, and ought to have closed the whole controversy,\r\nI will state, what is shown by the Journals of the Senate and the House,\r\nthat they passed both Houses, in great part _unanimously_, and for the\r\nremainder, by large majorities. (Sen. Jour. p. 312; House Jour. pp.\r\n416-417, 249, 324-329.)\r\n\r\nThe objections made by Governor McNutt in 1841, were as follows:\r\n\r\n     '1st. The Bank of the United States is prohibited by its\r\n     charter from purchasing such stock, either directly or\r\n     indirectly.\r\n\r\n     '2d. It was fraudulent on the part of the bank, inasmuch as the\r\n     contract was made in the name of an individual, when, in fact,\r\n     it was for the benefit of the bank, and payment was made with\r\n     its funds.\r\n\r\n     '3d. The sale was illegal, inasmuch as the bonds were sold on a\r\n     credit.\r\n\r\n     '4th. Interest to the amount of about $170,000 having accrued\r\n     on those bonds before the purchase money was stipulated to be\r\n     all paid, the bonds were, in fact, sold at less than their par\r\n     value, in direct violation of the charter of the bank.' (House\r\n     Journal, p. 25).\r\n\r\nIt will here be remarked, that the great objection now urged by\r\nJefferson Davis against these bonds, namely, that the act under which\r\nthey were alleged to have been issued was unconstitutional, is _not\r\nenumerated_ by Governor McNutt. Surely if such an objection existed to\r\nthe payment of the bonds, it must have found a place in this celebrated\r\nmessage. Is not this conclusive proof that this constitutional objection\r\nwas a mere afterthought and pretext of Jefferson Davis and his associate\r\nrepudiators?\r\n\r\nLet us examine the Governor's objections. As to the 1st and 2d--the bank\r\ndid not make the purchase; the contract was made by an individual,\r\nalthough the performance was guaranteed by the bank. As this is a mere\r\ntechnical objection, surely the Bank guarantee, even if void, could not\r\naffect the contract itself. 2d. The purchase, even if made by the bank,\r\nwas not of _stock_, but a _loan_ made upon _bonds_. 3d. The right of the\r\nbank to make the purchase is immaterial, if the money was paid, as in\r\nthis case, the bonds received, payable to bearer, and passed for value,\r\ninto the hands of _bona fide_ holders. What an objection to the\r\nrefunding the money--that, although it was received, the purchaser of\r\nthe bonds had no right to buy them, and therefore the _bona fide_\r\nholders should lose the money. It might have been in violation of its\r\ncharter for the bank to purchase the bonds, but it was '_fraudulent_,'\r\nwhen the money was received by the State, to retain it, on the\r\nallegation, that the bank could not legally make the purchase,\r\nespecially when the bonds, in the mean time, had passed into the hands\r\nof _bona fide_ holders. As to the 3d objection--as the money was paid\r\nbefore the objection was made, and the Union Bank authorized to draw _at\r\nonce_ for the amount, at a point beyond the limits of the State, which\r\nit did do, and realized a large premium on the exchange, and profit on\r\nthe transaction, the objection is as unfounded in law as it is in morals\r\nor good faith; especially as the bonds were payable to bearer, upon\r\ntheir face, in exact conformity to the law, and had passed, for value,\r\ninto the hands of _bona fide_ holders. Besides, there was no such\r\nrestriction in the charter. The only restriction in the supplement was,\r\nthat they should not be sold _below par_. Suppose the bonds for five\r\nmillions of dollars had been sold for five millions and a half, payable\r\nin sixty days, and the money paid at the time, it is equally absurd and\r\nfraudulent to contend, that for such a reason, the whole money could be\r\nretained, and bonds repudiated. As to the 4th objection, the original\r\n5th section which passed two successive Legislatures, did not require\r\nthat the bonds should not be sold for 'less than their par value.' If,\r\nthen, as contended by Jefferson Davis, the supplemental act containing\r\nthis provision, was unconstitutional, null and void, then no such\r\nrestriction existed, and the sale was valid under the original act. But\r\nthe truth is, the bonds were not sold _below par_, but _above par_, as\r\nshown by the High Court of Errors and Appeals of Mississippi, in the\r\ndecision hereafter quoted by me. Indeed, all these four objections of\r\nthe Governor, as well as those of Jefferson Davis, are shown in that\r\ndecision to be as unfounded in fact, as they were in law or morals.\r\n\r\nBut suppose the bonds were sold below par, that is, that the State had\r\nlost $170,000, or less than four per cent., on bonds for five millions\r\nof dollars. Was that a just or valid ground for repudiating the whole,\r\nprincipal and interest? The plea of _usury_ is always disgraceful, even\r\nif true, especially where the security was negotiable to bearer and had\r\npassed, for full value, into the hands of _bona fide_ holders. But if\r\nsuch a plea is disgraceful to individuals, what shall be said when it is\r\nmade on behalf of a State? And what shall be thought of those who make\r\nsuch an objection? What of a Governor, or of a United States Senator,\r\nwho urges such objections on behalf of a State? Do we not feel as if the\r\nState were some miserable culprit on trial, and some pettifogging lawyer\r\nwas endeavoring to screen him from punishment, by picking a flaw in the\r\nindictment. Yet such are the pleas on behalf of a State, urged by\r\nGovernor McNutt and Senator Jefferson Davis. On reference to the letter\r\nbefore referred to, of Jefferson Davis, it will be found that he does\r\nnot confine himself to the constitutional objections. In his first\r\nletter, before quoted, of 25th May, 1849, Mr. Jefferson Davis says,\r\n'Those bonds were purchased by a bank then tottering to its\r\nfall--purchased in violation of the charter of the bank, or\r\nfraudulently, by concealing the transaction under the name of an\r\nindividual, as may best suit those concerned, purchased in violation of\r\nthe terms of the law under which the bonds were issued, and in disregard\r\nof the Constitution of Mississippi, of which the law was an infraction.'\r\nThese positions are deliberately repeated by Jefferson Davis, in his\r\nsecond letter, before referred to, of the 29th August, 1849. That is,\r\nthe State should pay _none_ of the money received, because the\r\npurchaser, as alleged, had no right to buy the bonds--and because the\r\nsale was, as erroneously stated, an infraction of the law, that is\r\n_usurious_, or a sale below par. He insists the money was not received\r\nby the State, because, he says, 'Mississippi had no bank, and could not\r\nhave a bank of issue, because forbidden by the tenth section of the\r\nfirst article of the United States Constitution--'no State shall emit\r\nbills of credit.'' Surely Mr. Davis must have known, that in the case of\r\nthe Bank of Kentucky, a State bank of issue owned exclusively by the\r\nState, it was decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, that\r\nsuch a bank was constitutional, and no politician of the secession\r\nschool can object to that decision. (2 Peters 257.) But however this\r\nmight be, what kind of a plea is this? Why, if, as alleged by Mr. Davis,\r\nMississippi had violated the Federal Constitution, by establishing a\r\nbank of circulation, that therefore the _bonds_ of the State should be\r\nrepudiated. Is it not incredible that a Senator should assume such a\r\nposition on behalf of his State? But, if this be sound, it clearly\r\nfollows, that, inasmuch as the Confederate bonds are issued in plain\r\nviolation of the Constitution of the United States, those bonds should\r\nbe repudiated; so also if they were sold below par, or if there be any\r\nother technical objection. Nor will it avail that the bonds may have\r\npassed into the hands of _bona fide_ holders, for, Mr. Jefferson Davis\r\nsays, in his letter of the 29th August, 1849, 'If the bonds have passed\r\ninto the hands of innocent holders, the fact does not vary the legal\r\nquestion, as the purchaser could not acquire more than the seller had to\r\ndispose of.' And again, he says, referring to the alleged inability of\r\nthe first purchaser to buy the bonds, 'The claim of foreign holders is\r\nas good, but no better, than that of the first purchaser.' It is\r\ndifficult to say which is most astounding, the law or the morals of this\r\nposition. At all events, 'the foreign holders' of Confederate bonds are\r\ninformed by Jefferson Davis, that this is the law. Indeed it is a\r\nsingular coincidence, that one of the objections made to the payment of\r\nthe Union Bank bonds by the Governor, was, as he alleged, 'the monstrous\r\nassumption of power on the part of the bank, in seeking to monopolize\r\nthe _cotton crop_ of the State, and becoming a _factor_ and _shipper_ of\r\nour great staple.' (Senate Journals, 29.) Why, this is what is being\r\nattempted by these Confederate cotton bonds, although the State-rights\r\nstrict constructionists of slavedom would in vain look for any clause in\r\ntheir so-called constitution, authorizing any such transactions in\r\ncotton. And here, let me say, that the objection of a Senator from\r\nMississippi to the payment of her bonds, that, in issuing them, her\r\nGovernor and Legislature had violated _their own Constitution_, proposes\r\nto cure one fraud, by committing another far more stupendous. The bonds\r\nwere issued by the highest legislative and executive functionaries of\r\nthe State, the broad seal of the State attached, the bonds sold, and the\r\nmoney received. In such a case, there is a legal, as well as a moral\r\nestoppel, forbidding such a plea, for, by the English, as well as by the\r\nAmerican doctrine, an estoppel excludes the truth, whenever such proof\r\nwould enable the party, who obtained money on false pretences, to commit\r\na fraud on third persons, by disproving his own averment. This is not a\r\nmere technical rule, but one which is based upon experience, and\r\nsustained by the most exalted morality.\r\n\r\nI have given the several objections made by Governor McNutt and Senator\r\nDavis to the payment of these bonds, with one exception. This will be\r\nfound in the following extract from the executive message of Governor\r\nMcNutt, (p. 502): 'The bank, I have been informed, has hypothecated\r\nthese bonds, and borrowed money upon them of the Baron Rothschild; the\r\nblood of Judas and Shylock flows in his veins, and he unites the\r\nqualities of both his countrymen. He has mortgages on the silver mines\r\nof Mexico and the quicksilver mines of Spain. He has advanced money to\r\nthe Sublime Porte, and taken as security a mortgage upon the holy city\r\nof Jerusalem, and the sepulchre of our Saviour. It is for the people to\r\nsay, whether he shall have a mortgage upon our cotton fields and make\r\nserfs of our children.' I trust the baron will have the good sense to\r\nsmile at such folly, and realize how universally, at least throughout\r\nthe North, the malice and dishonesty of these suggestions was condemned\r\nand repudiated. We have no such prejudices, worthy only of the dark\r\nages, against 'God's chosen people,' 'the descendants of the patriarchs\r\nand prophets,' and the 'countrywomen of the mother of our Lord.'\r\n\r\nBut this whole question has been twice unanimously decided by the\r\nhighest judicial tribunal of Mississippi against the State, and every\r\npoint made by Governor McNutt and Jefferson Davis overruled by the\r\ncourt. One of these decisions was in January term, 1842, more than seven\r\nyears before the date of Jefferson Davis's letters, and the other was at\r\nApril term, 1853, nearly four years subsequently.\r\n\r\nThe first decision, at January term, 1842, is in the case of Campbell et\r\nal. _v._ Mississippi Union Bank (6 Howard 625 to 683). In this case it\r\nwas pleaded 'that the charter of the Mississippi Union Bank was not\r\nenacted and passed by the Legislature in compliance with the provisions\r\nof the Constitution of the State, in this, that the supplemental act of\r\n15th February, 1838, the same being a law to raise a loan of money on\r\nthe credit of the State, was not published and submitted to the\r\nsucceeding Legislature, according to the provisions of the Constitution\r\nin 9th section, 7th article.' Here the direct constitutional question\r\nwas presented, requiring the decision of the Court. The case was most\r\nelaborately argued on both sides. The able and upright circuit judge,\r\nHon. B. Harris, had decided that the supplemental act was\r\nconstitutional, and the bonds valid, and the High Court of Errors and\r\nAppeals of Mississippi, after full argument on both sides, unanimously\r\naffirmed that decision. In delivering the opinion of this highest\r\njudicial tribunal of the State, and the one designated by the\r\nLegislature in 1833, under the _mandatory_ clause of the Constitution,\r\nChief Justice Sharkey said:\r\n\r\n     'The second plea is, in substance, that the act supplemental to\r\n     the charter of the Union Bank, was not agreed to by a majority\r\n     of each House of the Legislature, and entered on the journals\r\n     with the yeas and nays, and referred to the next succeeding\r\n     Legislature, after publication in the newspapers, according to\r\n     the provisions of the 9th section of the 7th article of the\r\n     Constitution; but the said supplemental act made material\r\n     alterations in the original act, and was only passed by one\r\n     Legislature, and that no loan of money can be made on the faith\r\n     of the State without the assent of two Legislatures, given in\r\n     the manner prescribed by the Constitution.'--'I shall then\r\n     proceed to notice the constitutional provision, and to inquire,\r\n     by an application of it to the bank charter, whether the\r\n     position can be sustained. The 9th section of the 7th article\r\n     (of the Constitution) is in these words: 'No law shall ever be\r\n     passed to raise a loan of money on the credit of the State, for\r\n     the payment or redemption of any loan or debt, unless such law\r\n     be proposed in the Senate or House of Representatives, and be\r\n     agreed to by a majority of the members of each House, and\r\n     entered on their journals, with the yeas and nays taken\r\n     thereon, and be referred to the next succeeding Legislature,\r\n     and published for three months previous to the next regular\r\n     election, in three newspapers of the State, and unless a\r\n     majority of each branch of the Legislature, so elected after\r\n     such publication, shall agree to pass such law, and in such\r\n     case, the yeas and nays shall be taken, and entered on the\r\n     journals of each House.'\r\n\r\n     'The 5th section of the original act provides--'That in order\r\n     to facilitate the said Union Bank for the said loan of fifteen\r\n     million five hundred thousand dollars, the faith of this State\r\n     be and is hereby pledged, both for the security of the capital\r\n     and interest,' &c. It appears that the original charter in\r\n     which this provision is contained, was passed in accordance\r\n     with the provision in the Constitution. The supplemental act\r\n     makes no alteration whatever in regard to this section. It\r\n     changes in some respects the mere details of the original\r\n     charter, in the mode of carrying the corporation into\r\n     successful operation, and authorizes the Governor to subscribe\r\n     for the stock on the part of the State. The object of the\r\n     pledge is not changed; on the contrary, the supplemental act\r\n     was passed in aid of the original design. In applying the\r\n     constitutional test to the 5th section, I am not able to\r\n     perceive any reason which to me seems sufficient to justify the\r\n     conclusion that it is unconstitutional.'\r\n\r\n     'The plea presents no bar to the action.'\r\n\r\nJustices Turner and Trotter concurred.\r\n\r\nMr. Howard, the distinguished State reporter, gives, in the heading of\r\nthe case, the following as the decision of the court. 'The act\r\nsupplemental to the charter of the Union Bank, being in aid of the\r\ncharter, and changing the same only in some of the mere details, is a\r\nconstitutional act.'\r\n\r\nSurely this decision should have settled the question. But it did not.\r\nThe Governor, A. G. McNutt, who had signed the laws authorizing these\r\nbonds, and the bonds themselves, anticipating the decision of the court\r\n(as he indicates in his message) in favor of 'the holders of certain\r\nbonds heretofore issued to the Planters' and Union Bank,' recommends the\r\nLegislature, in his message of January, 1842, to create a 'revenue\r\ncourt,' the judge of which shall be appointed 'by the Executive or\r\nLegislature,' to which such cases should be transferred. (Sen. Jour. p.\r\n22.) Thus the case, on the bonds, was to be taken from the high tribunal\r\n(where it was then pending) created by the Constitution, and chosen by\r\nthe people, and transferred to a revenue judge to be appointed by the\r\nrepudiating Governor and Legislature of 1842, of course a mere executive\r\nparasite, or legislative minion, placed on the bench to repudiate the\r\nbonds. Fortunately, such an appointment was forbidden expressly by the\r\nConstitution, and would have been disregarded by the court; so this\r\nattempted usurpation failed.\r\n\r\nThe Governor says in that message:\r\n\r\n     'It never was intended by the framers of the Constitution, that\r\n     every public creditor should be permitted to harass the State\r\n     at pleasure by vexatious suits. Neither the judgment of a court\r\n     nor the decree of the Chancellor _can be obligatory on the\r\n     Legislature_,' &c. (P. 17.)\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this recommendation of the Governor, the Legislature\r\npassed a series of resolutions declaring that 'the Legislature is the\r\nexclusive judge of the objects for which money shall be raised and\r\nappropriated by its authority,' &c.; that the Legislature has no right\r\nto 'levy or appropriate money for the purpose of executing the object of\r\na law, by them deemed repugnant to, or unauthorized by the\r\nConstitution;' that the 'Supplemental (Union Bank) Bill is\r\nunconstitutional;' that 'the bonds delivered by said bank, and by it\r\nsold to Nicholas Biddle on the 18th August, 1838, are not binding upon\r\nthe State,' &c. (Acts of 1842, ch. 127.) But, unfortunately for these\r\npositions, the Constitution of the State had deprived the Legislature of\r\nall 'judicial power;' it had vested this power exclusively in 'the\r\ncourts;' it had, in the very case of all bonds of the State, required\r\nand commanded the Legislature to designate the _courts_ in which such\r\ncases should be decided; it had, by the act of 1833, passed in obedience\r\nto the imperative mandate of the Constitution, referred all such cases\r\nto the decision of the Court of Chancery, with appeal to the High Court\r\nof Errors and Appeals; it had made their decision conclusive; it had\r\nalready appropriated the money, to pay _all such decrees_, and made it\r\nthe _duty_ of the Governor to command the Auditor to draw his warrant on\r\nthe Treasurer for payment: this was the constitution of the law when\r\nthese bonds were issued and sold in 1838--such was the _contract_ of the\r\nState, in regard to which the Federal Constitution declares, 'no State\r\nshall pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts'--which clause\r\nhas been uniformly held by all the Federal as well as State Courts, to\r\napply to contracts of a State--and yet, in flagrant defiance of the\r\nhighest duties and the most sacred obligations, the Legislature passed\r\nthese resolutions, to nullify the anticipated decisions of the court. We\r\nhave seen, however, that this executive and legislative usurpation\r\nwas ineffectual. The court stood firm, not a single judge\r\nwavered, and, by a unanimous decree, reversed the legislative and\r\nexecutive repudiation--vindicated the majesty of the law and the\r\nConstitution--upheld the sacred cause of truth and justice--resisted the\r\npopular frenzy, and defied the unprincipled demagogues by whom the\r\npeople of the State had been deceived and deluded. It was a noble\r\nspectacle, when those three upright and fearless Judges, Sharkey,\r\nTurner, and Trotter, entered the temple of justice, and declared to the\r\npeople, by whose ballots they were chosen, that the State was bound to\r\npay these bonds, and decreed accordingly. The same sublime scene was\r\nreënacted by a similar decree, in a suit against the State, on one of\r\nthese bonds, by the same court, in 1853, then composed of different\r\njudges--Smith, Yerger, and Fisher. And not one judge or chancellor of\r\nthe State ever wavered. Amid all this heaven-daring iniquity, thank\r\nGod! the judicial ermine was unstained. Whilst constrained to denounce\r\nthe repudiating Legislature, Governor, and _Senator_ of Mississippi, let\r\nme point to another green spot amid the moral waste and desolation of\r\nthat dreadful period.\r\n\r\nWith scarcely an exception, the _Bar of Mississippi_ was true to the\r\ncause of honor, law, and justice. They knew the objections of McNutt and\r\nDavis were wretched pretexts, and they vindicated the reputation of that\r\nnoble profession, which, in all ages, has been the champion of\r\nconstitutional liberty. They were men of the same stamp as their\r\nillustrious English ancestry, Hampden, Sidney, and Russell, whose names\r\ncover the map of my country, and whose deeds have exalted the character\r\nof man; and although the blood of our anti-repudiating heroes did not\r\nflow like that of the British martyrs, as a sacrificial offering on the\r\naltar of freedom, they sacrificed ease, and affluence, and ambition, and\r\npolitical preferment, and endured obloquy and reproach. I rejoice in the\r\nrecollection, that, during this contest they should have selected a\r\nsentence from my address against repudiation, and placed it on their\r\nbanners, and at the head of their presses, in these words: 'The honor of\r\nthe nation and of every State is the birthright of every American--it is\r\nthe stainless and priceless jewel of popular sovereignty--it has been\r\npreserved unsullied, in all times that are past, through every sacrifice\r\nof blood and treasure, and it must be maintained.' Ay! and it will yet\r\nbe maintained. The time will come, when repudiation will be repudiated\r\nby Mississippi--when her wretched secession leaders, the true authors of\r\nher disgrace and ruin, will be discarded--when her insolent slaveholding\r\noligarchy will be overthrown, when the people will break the chains of\r\ntheir imperious masters, and labor, without regard to color, will be\r\nemancipated. _Secession_, _repudiation_, and _slavery_ are the same in\r\nprinciple and had the same leaders. Jefferson Davis carried the\r\nrepudiation banner in 1849, as he now does that of secession and\r\nslavery. Secession is a repudiation of law, of constitution, of country,\r\nof the flag of our forefathers, and of the Union purchased by their\r\nblood. Driven at home within a circle of fire, which narrows every day,\r\nit is crouching before foreign rulers, and imploring their aid to\r\naccomplish the ruin of our country. It appeals to their ambition, their\r\navarice, their fears, their hatred of free institutions and of\r\nconstitutional government. It summons them to these English shores, it\r\nunsheathes the imperial sceptre in the House of Commons, denounces the\r\nMinistry of England, and dictates the vote of Parliament on the most\r\nmomentous question in the history of the world. Why, when these\r\nsentiments were uttered, I almost expected to see the shades of Burke\r\nand Fox, and Pitt and Chatham, and Peel and Wellington, rise in the\r\nmidst and denounce the degenerate bearer of such a message. What! the\r\nBritish Commons become the supple tools, the obsequious minions, the\r\nobedient parasites, to do the bidding of a foreign master, and tremble\r\nwhen his envoy should stamp his foot and wave the imperial banner in the\r\nhalls of Parliament. From whom was this message, and to whom? Was it to\r\nthe England of Trafalgar and the Nile? Was it to the descendants of the\r\nmen who conquered at Agincourt and Cressy, and changed for ages at\r\nWaterloo the destiny of the world? Why, Nelson would speak from his\r\nmonument, and the Iron Duke from his equestrian statue, and forbid the\r\ndegradation of their country. But there stood the Confederate messenger,\r\ndelivering the mandate of a foreign power to the House of Commons,\r\ndescribing England as a crawling reptile, exalting the Government he\r\nprofessed to represent, as controlling the Continent, and fearing lest\r\nthe Imperial Eagle alone should swoop down upon his prey. And such\r\nlanguage, such sentiments! Was I in Billingsgate, that ancient and\r\nillustrious institution, so near the House of Parliament? Why, the whole\r\ncode of morals and of international law was repudiated in a sentence,\r\nand our demagogues distanced in the race. Did the envoy echo the voice\r\nof his master, when he announced that the American Union must be\r\ndissolved by foreign intervention, because, if reunited, it would be too\r\nstrong, and bully the world--therefore France and England combined must\r\nstrike us when we were supposed to be weak and divided. It is not the\r\nauthor of such atrocious and dastard sentiments that would lead the\r\nbanner of France or of England anywhere except to humiliation and\r\ndisgrace. 'Non talis auxilii, nec defensoribus ipsis.' No, when England\r\nseeks leaders, it will not be the sycophants of power, those who worship\r\nalternately democracy and autocracy, who slaver over despotism one day\r\nwith their venom, and the next with their still more loathsome\r\nadulation.\r\n\r\nBut there was a change. The Ministry, and one of an order supposed to be\r\nour most deadly foes, spoke. There were some opinions as to the results\r\nin which no American could concur--there was deep devotion to\r\nEngland--but there was also the voice of reason, of justice, of\r\ninternational law: it was not so cosmopolitan as I expected, but the\r\nargument of felon force and robber violence was discarded. The scholar,\r\nthe statesman, the gentleman, the philanthropist addressed the English\r\nCommons. Yes, and the nobility of nature also spoke, one who could rise\r\nabove the reputed prejudices of his order, and do justice to a kindred\r\nrace of simple republicans, though they may know neither diadems nor\r\ncoronets. Such examples exalt and dignify the character of man. They\r\nteach us republicans a useful lesson--that those who differ from us as\r\nto some of the forms of government, may most sincerely support that\r\nsystem which in their judgment will best promote the welfare and\r\nhappiness of the people. That indeed is the only question. Let England\r\nand America work out the problem in peaceful and friendly rivalry. Time\r\nand experience will decide the question. If, when slavery is\r\nextinguished in our Union, and the only aggressive element of our system\r\nis extirpated, we should run a grand and peaceful career of honor and\r\nglory and prosperity, we will want no other argument than the results.\r\nThe blasphemous doctrine of the divine rights of kings was discarded by\r\nEngland in the revolution of 1688. The British throne reposes now on the\r\nalleged basis of the welfare and happiness of the people. What form of\r\ngovernment will best promote that end--this is the only question. I\r\nbelieve it is ours--but only with slavery extinguished, and universal\r\neducation--schools--_schools_--SCHOOLS--common schools--_high schools_\r\nfor all. Education the criterion of the right of suffrage, not property.\r\nI do not believe in a government of ignorance, whether by the many or\r\nthe few. With the constant and terrible opposing element of slavery, we\r\nhave certainly achieved stupendous results in three fourths of a\r\ncentury, and to say that our system has failed, because slavery now\r\nmakes war upon it, is amazing folly. Why predict, that, when reunited,\r\nand with slavery extinguished, we would _bully the world_. Who were our\r\nbullies? Who struck down Charles Sumner, the Senator of Massachusetts,\r\nthe eminent scholar and orator, on the floor of the Senate, for\r\ndenouncing the horrors of slavery? A South Carolinian, whilst all\r\nslavedom approved the deed. Who endeavored to force slavery on Kansas by\r\nmurder and rapine, and the forgery of a constitution? Who repealed the\r\nMissouri Compromise, in order to force slavery upon all the Territories\r\nof the United States? Who are endeavoring now to dissolve the Union, and\r\nspread slavery over all this wide domain? There is a plain answer to\r\nall these questions. It is the lords of the whip and the chain and the\r\nbranding iron, who are our bullies--who insist upon forced labor, and\r\nrepudiate all compensation to the toiling millions of slaves--who\r\nrepudiate, among slaves, the marital and parental relation, and class\r\nthem by law as chattels--who forbid emancipation--who make it a crime to\r\nteach slaves to read or write--ay, even the Bible--who keep open the\r\ninterstate slave-trade (more horrible than the African, making Virginia\r\na human stock farm), tearing husband from wife, and parents from\r\nchildren--founding a government boldly announcing the doctrine of\r\n_property_ in man, based avowedly on the divinity, extension, and\r\nperpetuity of slavery--these are our bullies; and when they are\r\noverthrown, we shall commence a new career of peaceful progress and\r\nadvanced civilization. And why sow the seeds of international hatred\r\nbetween England and America? Is war really desired between the two\r\ncountries, or is it supposed that we will yield to foreign intervention\r\nwithout a struggle? No, the North will rise up as one man, and thousands\r\neven from the South will join them. The country will become a camp, and\r\nthe ocean will swarm with our privateers. Rather than submit to\r\ndismemberment or secession, which is anarchy and ruin, we will, we must\r\nfight, until the last man has fallen. The Almighty can never prosper\r\nsuch a war upon us. If the views of a foreign power have been truly\r\nrepresented in Parliament, and such an aggression upon us is\r\ncontemplated, let him beware, for in such a contest, the political\r\npyramid resting upon its apex, the power of one man, is much more likely\r\nto fall, than that which reposes on the broad basis of the will of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nReturning from this episode, I resume the narrative.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the repudiating Executive message and repudiating\r\nlegislative resolutions of January, 1842, and their failure to influence\r\nthe decision of the court. And now, we approach another act in the\r\ndrama. The court having affirmed the constitutionality of the Union Bank\r\nbonds, and as the act of 1833 directed their payment, the Legislature of\r\n1844 enacted a new law, in these words: 'That hereafter, no judgment or\r\ndecree of any court of law or equity having jurisdiction of suits\r\nagainst the State, shall be paid by warrants on the Treasurer, or\r\notherwise, without an appropriation by law, any former law or usage to\r\nthe contrary notwithstanding.' The 'law and usage' were plain, to pay\r\nsuch decrees, as required by the law and Constitution; but both were\r\ndisregarded, and the act of 1833, for all practical purposes, repealed.\r\nIt remained in part, on the statute book, only to invite to the\r\ngambler's game of 'odd I win, even you lose'--that is, if, under the act\r\nof 1833, there should be a decision in any case in favor of the State,\r\nit should be conclusive, but if against the State, the money should not\r\nbe paid, where (as in the case of these bonds) the Legislature differed\r\nfrom the court, and had already repudiated its decision. Such was the\r\naction of the Legislature in 1842 and 1844. In 1842, it repudiated, in\r\nadvance, the decision of the court on these bonds, and, after that\r\ndecision, repealed so much of the law as required the payment of the\r\ndecrees of the court. Now, with a full knowledge of these facts, is it\r\nnot amazing, incredible, that, several years subsequently, Mr. Jefferson\r\nDavis should have declared, in his first letter of 1849, 'By the\r\nConstitution and laws of Mississippi, any creditor of the State may\r\nbring suit against the State, and test his claim as against an\r\nindividual; but, conscious that they have no valid claim, they have not\r\nsought the remedy;' and he repeats this averment, substantially, in his\r\nsecond letter. Now, who would have supposed, that more than five years\r\nbefore the date of Mr. Davis's letters, the highest judicial tribunal\r\nof the State, the one designated by the law and the Constitution, had\r\nalready unanimously decided that these bonds were valid, and that the\r\nState Legislature, instead of paying the money, had _repealed the\r\nappropriation_. But there came a new court, all chosen by the people,\r\nunder the wretched system, in many of the States, of an elective\r\njudiciary, but unknown to the independent Federal judicial system. A\r\nsuit was brought in 1851, under the act of 1833, on one of the Union\r\nBank State bonds and coupons before the Chancellor. After elaborate\r\nargument, the Chancellor decided against the State, and entered a decree\r\nfor the payment of the money. The State, as authorized by the law,\r\nappealed from this decision to its own High Court of Errors and Appeals,\r\nelected by the people.\r\n\r\nSurely, it was supposed, that this new court, so recently chosen by the\r\npeople, after the legislative repudiation, would be governed by '_a\r\nproper regard for the public interest and public opinion_.' Before the\r\nChancellor, as well as the High Court, all the objections made by\r\nGovernor McNutt and Senator Davis were earnestly pressed by the\r\nAttorney-General of the State and associate counsel, but in vain; the\r\ndecision of the Chancellor was against the State, and it was unanimously\r\naffirmed by the High Court. This case will be found reported by the\r\nState reporter, Johnson _v._ The State, April term, 1853. (3 Cushman,\r\n625 to 882,--257 pages.)\r\n\r\nIn this case, the bond sued on is given in the record, and will be found\r\nan exact copy of that (heretofore quoted) under the original act, which\r\nhad passed two successive Legislatures, the principal as well as coupons\r\nbeing payable in Federal currency.\r\n\r\nOn the reverse side of the bond is the following:\r\n\r\n     '£450 sterling. The President, Directors, and Co. of the\r\n     Mississippi Union Bank, do hereby designate the agency of the\r\n     Bank of the United States in London, as the place of payment of\r\n     the within bond and interest, and hereby assign and transfer\r\n     the same for value received to the bearer, principal equal to\r\n     £450 sterling, and guarantee the payment of the same at the\r\n     place designated.\r\n\r\n                                 'S. GWIN, _Cashier_.\r\n\r\n                                 'H. G. RUNNELLS, _President_.\r\n\r\n     'Mississippi State Bond, No. 91. 'Redeemable February 25th,\r\n     1850.'\r\n\r\nAs to the place where the bond was made payable, there could be no\r\nobjection, for the original, as well as the supplemental act, gave full\r\nauthority to make the bonds payable abroad. But as to the objection that\r\nthey were said to be payable in sterling, at the rate of four shillings\r\nand sixpence to the pound, the answer was, as shown: 1st. That this was\r\nthe true rate of exchange. 2d. That the bond was payable in Federal\r\ncurrency, and this was all the bondholder ever asked from the State. As\r\nto the allegation that the bonds were sold below par, the court showed\r\nmost conclusively from the facts and agreed case, that they were sold\r\nabove par, and their constitutionality was fully affirmed.\r\n\r\nThe argument of the Attorney-General (Glenn) for the State, embraced 32\r\nprinted pages; in addition to which was an elaborate argument by his\r\nassociate, Mr. Stearns. The opinion of Chief Justice Smith embraced 45\r\npages, the concurring opinion of Justice Yerger, 27 pages, and Justice\r\nFisher concurred. The State was not satisfied, but moved for a\r\nreargument, that of Wharton for the State, embracing 54 pages, and that\r\nof Mays, on the same side, 32 pages; but the court adhered to their\r\ndecision, and unanimously affirmed the decree of the Chancellor against\r\nthe State. The decision of the court, in the heading of the case, is\r\nthus given by the reporter.\r\n\r\n     'The bonds might have been legally issued to the bank, by the\r\n     Governor, on the 5th June, 1838, pursuant to the provision of\r\n     the original charter of the bank, and the faith of the State\r\n     pledged for the purpose of raising the capital.' 'The\r\n     supplement was not void in consequence of not having been\r\n     passed in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution\r\n     contained in the 7th article, 9th section of that instrument.'\r\n     'The object of the original pledge of the faith of the State,\r\n     was not changed by the supplemental charter, but it was passed\r\n     in aid of the original charter.' 'Campbell _v._ Union Bank (6\r\n     Howard 625) _cited and confirmed_.' 'The liability of the\r\n     State, under the operation of the charter of the bank, attached\r\n     so soon or whenever the bonds were legally executed to the\r\n     bank, and the execution of the mortgages was neither a\r\n     condition precedent to the pledge of the faith of the State,\r\n     nor the condition on which the State bonds were to be executed\r\n     and delivered.' 'It does not appear from the facts that the\r\n     bonds were sold for less than their par value. Held that the\r\n     sale was neither illegal nor void.' 'If the commissioners in\r\n     the sale of the bonds received 'sterling money of Great\r\n     Britain' at the rate of four shillings and sixpence to the\r\n     pound, that is not such an act on their part as would avoid the\r\n     bonds.'\r\n\r\nHere, then, the whole case was again fully decided in 1853, by the very\r\ntribunal to which Jefferson Davis, in 1849, invited the bondholders. And\r\ndid he or the State then yield or pay the obligations. Not at all, but\r\nthey adhered to the repudiation of these bonds, disregarded and defied\r\nthe decision of the court, and have never paid one dollar of principal\r\nor interest, and never will, so long as slavery exists in Mississippi.\r\n\r\nAnd now, after the almost unanimous passage of the supplemental act in\r\n1838, the sanction of the Legislature in 1839 and 1841, the decision of\r\nthe Circuit Court and Chancellor, and of the High Court of Errors and\r\nAppeals, how strange is the assertion of Mr. Slidell, that 'The Union\r\nBank bonds were issued in direct violation of an express constitutional\r\nprovision.' It is a well settled principle of American law, so\r\nadjudicated by the State Courts, as well as by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, that, 1st, To authorize the court to decide that a law is\r\nunconstitutional, the repugnance to the Constitution must be '_plain and\r\npalpable_.' 2d., That the interpretation given by the _highest court of\r\na State_, to a State law, or constitution, '_is conclusive_.' But the\r\ntruth is, as is proved by Mr. Slidell's own letter (having never resided\r\nin the State), he knew nothing of the subject, or he never would have\r\nspoken of Jefferson Davis as 'Governor,' or alluded to 'his\r\nadministration,' when he never held that office. But it is of some\r\nmoment, at least to the unfortunate bondholders, that the minister of\r\nJefferson Davis at Paris, _avers now_ that these bonds are\r\n_unconstitutional_.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. Slidell says, 'There is a wide difference between these bonds\r\nand those of the Planters' Bank, for the repudiation of which, neither\r\nexcuse nor palliation can be offered.'\r\n\r\nNow, in a subsequent letter, I will prove conclusively, from authentic\r\ndocuments, that the State of Mississippi has, _most effectually_,\r\nrepudiated those bonds also, and that Jefferson Davis has sustained that\r\nrepudiation.\r\n\r\nIn the case, also, of another slaveholding State, I will prove, from the\r\npublic documents, that Jefferson Davis volunteered to sustain her in the\r\nrepudiation of her State bonds, in a case more atrocious, if possible,\r\nthan that of Mississippi. As Jefferson Davis is now at the head of a\r\nslaveholding conspiracy, endeavoring to destroy the Government of my\r\ncountry, and is now also engaged in selling worthless Confederate bonds\r\nin this market, I have deemed it my duty to make this publication.\r\n\r\n                                                    R. J. WALKER.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Since this was written, the supposed menacing message from the\r\nContinent has been officially contradicted. Surely, however, I had a\r\nright to conclude, after such solemn assurances from a member to the\r\nHouse, that, although acting in the character of a Confederate\r\nmessenger, and avowing such atrocious sentiments, he at least spoke the\r\ntruth on that point.\r\n\r\n                                                    R. J. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERGREEN BEAUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps if my early home had stood upon an island of evergreens, or if I\r\nhad dreamed my first bright dreams among pine hills and cliffs of\r\nlaurel, I should have loved their changeless beauty less. But through\r\nall my early years I saw but little of our native evergreens, and none\r\nof cultured, save a stunted cedar, that grew, or, rather, refused to\r\ngrow, in our front yard at home; and thus they have ever attracted me\r\nexceedingly--the charm of rarity and novelty being added for me to their\r\nexceeding beauty.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, if brought up among them, I might but have loved them more. For\r\nall I know of philosophy, if I had been earlier familiar with shrubs,\r\nhedges, groups, cedared cliffs, and tall forests of evergreens, they\r\nmight have brought me still nobler conceptions, a more exquisite sense\r\nof beauty, than they now do.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, two years 'among the pines' of Virginia and her piny\r\nmountains, have enriched my mind with rare pictures of scenic beauty\r\nthat shall keep fresh and green in memory while memory endures! I am no\r\nbotanist, I have made no studies of the evergreens, nor shall I attempt\r\nto write of them as scholar or critic, but only as a fascinated\r\nobserver. I neither care to know or tell whether the shrubs and trees in\r\nmy evergreen pictures are angiosperms or gymnosperms; we have no\r\n'transportation' for text books for students! During these two years,\r\nhowever, I have been charmed with a thousand views of landscape scenery,\r\nembracing every form, hue, and combination of our lovely native\r\nevergreens, whether on mountain, hill, or plain. I have seen them along\r\nwinding streams, with backgrounds of bold, rocky bluffs; sweeping across\r\nundulating plains; rising with the uplifting mountains; peering into and\r\nover romantic mountain gorges; and growing up through the interstices of\r\nbowldered cascades. Or, standing on the mountain peaks, I have seen them\r\nsweep away into the vastness and grandeur of mighty, varied, and almost\r\nboundless expanse. These are but parts of my evergreen pictures. I have\r\nlooked upon a simple holly bush when the wind of winter was upon it,\r\nscattering in lovely fragments its pure white robe of snow, revealing\r\nthe gleaming of the rich green leaves, and the half-hidden clusters of\r\nthe carmine berries. Three distinct colors thrown carelessly together,\r\nbut no want of harmony--only pure and exquisite beauty!\r\n\r\nIn the summer months our evergreens are greatly less noticeable. They\r\nare overshadowed and eclipsed by the rich and exuberant foliage of our\r\ncommon but noble forest trees; but their beauty is not, even then, lost.\r\nThey give variety of hues to the forests which they fringe or help to\r\nform; variety of shapes, and always exquisite, spicy, and healthful\r\nodors. But when the autumn comes, with its infinitely varied tintings of\r\norange and vermilion; when the frost works its wonders, and the wooded\r\nhills are clothed with splendor--then the rich groups of our native\r\nevergreens rise in their immortality of freshness. How exquisitely their\r\nbright unfading green sets off and contrasts with the rich golds,\r\nglowing scarlets, russet browns, purples, and crimsons, in all their\r\ndelicate shades and evanescent hues! The forest leaves grow sere and\r\nfall from their stems, sailing down singly or in groups, like bevies of\r\nfrightened birds, until the hickory, oak, maple, and elm stand\r\nuncrowned, disrobed, lifting their bare arms to the winter skies; then\r\nhigher and ever higher rises, as the gloom of winter deepens, the glory\r\nof evergreen shrub and tree.\r\n\r\nThe fields are dull russet, the forests are black, each tree seems a\r\nskeleton; all nature, save the evergreen, looks dead. But our mountains\r\nof firs, our hills of pine, our groves of cedar, our thickets of holly,\r\nour cliffs crowned with laurel, full of life, and covered with\r\nunchangeable verdure, keep eternally fresh and beautiful. Then come the\r\ngreat white silent snowflakes, sailing round and falling gently down,\r\nalighting on trunk, branch, and leaf, and covering and draping the\r\nhills, until they are pure and fair as the hills of Beulah. There is a\r\ndreamlike beauty in an evergreen forest mantled with snow. What words\r\ncould tell the purity of coloring, the gracefulness of form of the pine\r\nboughs bending under their white burden of feathery crystals? Especially\r\nis this true of the young and pliant trees in hedgerows and thickets,\r\nand such as are everywhere springing up over the waste and wornout lands\r\nof Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe old monarch pine stands out like a sculptured column of ebony\r\nagainst the blue sky. Its umbel top, crowned with white, makes a fitting\r\ncapital for a shaft so noble. It is a picture, in and of itself. The\r\nshrubs and young trees, so rich in leaves and verdure, so pliant to the\r\nlines and curves of grace, when happily and picturesquely grouped, are\r\nalmost bewilderingly beautiful. Yet perhaps that which contains in\r\nitself the greatest number of the elements of beauty, is the\r\nmedium-sized pyramidal tree, be it of spruce, Norway pine, or balsam\r\nfir. It unites at once, in its pyramidal shape, the strength and majesty\r\nof the old, and in its gracefully curved limbs and abundant leaves, the\r\nbeauty and freshness of the young tree. When loaded down with a spotless\r\nburden of snow until its limbs are almost ready to break, no pyramid of\r\nart, no monument chiselled by human hands, can hope to approach its pure\r\nand model beauty.\r\n\r\nThe evergreen itself, however, seems to know no season but spring. In\r\nnone other does it appear to change, and even then it casts not off the\r\nold--it only puts on the new in tenderer and fresher beauty! The new\r\ngrowth of the spruce and fir, the pale yellowish-green tips set in the\r\ndark old background, are exquisitely lovely; nor are the light green\r\nshoots of the white, yellow, and pitch pine much, less beautiful.\r\n\r\nLater comes the glory of the laurel bloom, the most beautiful woodflower\r\nin our climate. As the other trees put on their leaves successively, the\r\ntinting of light, dark, and yellowish green are infinitely varied and\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\nNor must I pass over, in my picture of evergreen, the mosses and ferns\r\nof the mountains of Virginia. More fragile than the trees and shrubs,\r\nthey cannot be considered less beautiful. Indeed, the mosses of Cheat\r\nMountain are the most luxuriant, exquisite, delicate, and richly\r\nbeautiful things in nature. No dream of fairyland could, to my\r\nimagination, be lovelier than are the evergreen heights of these\r\nmountains, covered, matted, fringed, heaped, piled as they are with the\r\ngreatest variety of mosses of the most delicate texture, feathery forms,\r\nand wondrously beautiful combinations. No one who has not seen them can\r\nhave any just conception of mountain mosses, nor of the marvellous\r\nluxuriance of beauty with which they clothe rock, and tree, and earth,\r\nand everything upon these lone wild slopes and summits. Over the rocks,\r\namid the mosses, hang the long pendent ferns, in richer, darker green.\r\nAnd with the grand old pine and fir trees lifting their heads to the\r\nheavens, and the thick tanglewood of shrub and underbrush, there is\r\ngrandeur, grace, and beauty in bewildering, changeful, and ravishing\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nHow I have loved, in leisure hours, to turn aside from the stern duties\r\nof the field, or the dull monotony of the camp, to gallop under the\r\ngreat pines, or wind through pathless thickets and native parks of\r\nevergreen, feasting my very soul on their eternal freshness and glory!\r\nHow I have loved to see 'Black Hawk' crush with his feet, and sink up to\r\nhis fetlocks, in the tender and fairy-like mosses that drape the\r\nmountains! How I have delighted to weave the trailing evergreens into\r\nwreaths, trellises, and bowers in front of my white tent! And, alas!\r\nwith hushed and solemn pride, I have planted the holly and the pine on\r\nthe graves of my dead comrades, hoping they might live in all their\r\nwondrous beauty over the quiet mound, and keep green the memory of the\r\nbrave forever!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDYING IN THE HOSPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am dying, mother, dying, in the hospital alone;\r\n    With a hundred faces round me, not a single one is known;\r\n    And the human heart within me, like a fluttering, wounded dove,\r\n    Hungers with a ceaseless yearning for one answering word of love.\r\n\r\n    Oh, 'tis hard, 'tis hard, my mother, thus to linger day by day,\r\n    Dying here, without the music of the battle's fierce array;--\r\n    Dying, far from home and kindred, robbed of all life's dearest ties,\r\n    With the eager eyes out-gazing but to meet with stranger eyes.\r\n\r\n    It were sweet to fall, my mother, with the battle raging round,\r\n    And to leap from earth to heaven at a single patriot-bound;\r\n    It were sweet to feel that glory would check the tears of woe--\r\n    That o'er hearts whose griefs were deepest a gush of pride would flow.\r\n\r\n    But to lie at night, dear mother, and to list the warder's tread,\r\n    As it falls upon my heart, I seem a prisoner with the dead;\r\n    And I long to lose my sense of pain, to find a calm release,\r\n    And to sink each vain, vain longing, in a silent sea of peace.\r\n\r\n    Oh, could I see, dear mother, the dog that guards our door,\r\n    It would make each life throb at my heart beat quicker than before;\r\n    And the nursing of your own dear hands, the breath of our old hills,\r\n    Would send a flood of fresh life back through all these draining rills.\r\n\r\n    But it may not be, loved mother: I must die here, all alone;\r\n    Where, a hundred faces round me, not a single one is known;\r\n    With the human heart within me hungering, like a wounded dove,\r\n    For the soft glance of my mother, and her dear home-words of love.\r\n\r\n    Oh, the heart of man, loved mother, is as dauntless as a rock\r\n    In a time of mortal danger--in the battle's deadly shock;\r\n    But alone--alone and dying, how he craves affection's ties--\r\n    Craves a woman's strength in weakness, and the lovelight in her eyes!\r\n\r\n    Oh, the dreams, the dreams, my mother, that have vanished from my sky,\r\n    Like the misty mountain vapors that before the sunlight fly--\r\n    All the golden dreams of glory, with their rainbow tints of fame,\r\n    That would link with deeds of valor my bright, my deathless name!\r\n\r\n    Where are they now, dear mother? Like a mirage of the plain,\r\n    Like a bubble on the ocean, like a jewel on the main,\r\n    Like the sweetest flowers of autumn, when they feel the biting frost,\r\n    All those glorious aspirations--they are lost, forever lost!\r\n\r\n    Yet if I could live, my mother, I know I still should go\r\n    And help to rid our country of her fratricidal foe;\r\n    For you have taught me, long ago, that he was no true man\r\n    Who would not, in a time like this, step forward with the van.\r\n\r\n    And though I leave, my mother, no laurel crown of fame,\r\n    There is not linked with my past life a single breath of shame;\r\n    And though I ne'er shall see your face, I will no more complain,\r\n    For I know that not a sparrow falleth to the ground in vain.\r\n\r\n    But another dawn, sweet mother, is breaking o'er me now;\r\n    When to-morrow's sunlight beameth, it will find a calm, cold brow;\r\n    And another rough, rude coffin will be taken from the door:\r\n    God bless you, dearest mother, and good-by forevermore!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n     WEAK LUNGS, AND HOW TO MAKE THEM STRONG; or, Diseases of the\r\n     Organs of the Chest, with their Home Treatment by the Movement\r\n     Cure. By DIO LEWIS, M. D. Profusely illustrated. Ticknor &\r\n     Fields, Boston, 1863.\r\n\r\nDiet, air, sunshine, dress, exercise, and water, are all indispensable\r\nhygienic agents, but considerable knowledge and experience are necessary\r\nfor their proper adaptation to particular cases. Dr. Lewis's work is\r\ndesigned (to a certain degree) to impart such knowledge, and, while the\r\ngeneral rules he gives cannot fail to be useful to all, we doubt not\r\nthere are many instances of the especial malady under consideration in\r\nwhich the proposed mode of treatment would prove entirely efficacious.\r\nThe numerous and carefully elaborated illustrations contained in the\r\nbook render the application of the text simple and easy. The feature\r\nwhich especially pleases us is, that arrangements are made for home\r\ntreatment, for, if there is anything depressing to the human spirit, it\r\nis an association of invalids. We do not mean a regular hospital, where\r\npeople are suffering from acute forms of disease, and are learning and\r\nteaching the grand lessons of patience, endurance, and fortitude so\r\nnecessary to humanity, but a community of individuals, able to walk\r\nabout, talk to one another, and be generally engrossed with one idea,\r\nthe pursuit of health. We once spent thirty days in a water-cure\r\nestablishment, and can truly say that it was one of the most miserable\r\nmonths we ever passed. The totally physical atmosphere, the selfish,\r\nmaterial countenances surrounding us, weighed upon our spirit until our\r\nnerves gave way, and we wondered which were on the broad road to\r\ninsanity, our companions or ourselves. We examined narrowly, and found\r\n(in the generality of cases) that the angels within the bodies of those\r\nmen and women had had their wings cut away until nothing remained but\r\nthe senses and the limited knowledge they are capable of conveying.\r\n\r\nOur experience may have been peculiarly unfortunate, but it has rendered\r\nus always happy to welcome a rational treatment of disease that may be\r\npursued at home. Self-denial and activity are the two principal lessons\r\ninculcated in the work; and if we be careful to lift them from the body\r\nto the soul, we need not fear the slight tinge of materialism that seems\r\nalmost inseparable from essays on bodily health. We repeat that Dr.\r\nLewis's book abounds in excellent suggestions, essential to all, and its\r\nwide circulation will doubtless tend to the improvement of the general\r\nhealth of our people. Those even who, in some points, fail to agree with\r\nthe author, must acknowledge the usefulness and practicability of the\r\ngeneral ideas advanced, together with the simplicity of their\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n     LIFE OF CHOPIN, by F. LISZT. Translated from the French by\r\n     MARTHA WALKER COOK. 12mo, pp. 202. Philadelphia: F. Leypoldt.\r\n     New York: F. W. Christern and James Miller. 2d Edition.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see that this little work has already gone into its\r\nsecond edition. It gives evidence that, in spite of our domestic\r\nafflictions, more interest is felt in this country for art, than is\r\ngenerally believed to be the case, even by the most astute publishers\r\namong us. In calling the attention of our readers to this second edition\r\nof Liszt's 'Chopin,' we do not think we can do better than place before\r\nthem the following extracts from a critique which appeared in the New\r\nYork _Daily Tribune_ of June 11th, 1863.\r\n\r\n'The lovers of musical art may justly be congratulated on the appearance\r\nof this extraordinary biographical study in an appropriate English\r\ndress. It is the enthusiastic tribute of a man of noble genius to a\r\nkindred spirit, whose mastership he acknowledged, and with whom he\r\ncherished a deep and tender friendship, beyond the vitiating touch of\r\npersonal or artistic rivalry. The volume, indeed, affords a no less\r\nadmirable illustration of the impulsive, generous, unworldly character\r\nof the author, than of the rare and wonderful gifts of its unique\r\nsubject. It is the product of the heart rather than the head, and its\r\nfrequent passages of childlike _naïveté_, its transparent revelations of\r\nthe inmost soul of the writer, and the radiant atmosphere of spiritual\r\nbeauty in which thoughts and images are melted together with a magic\r\nspell, transport it from the sphere of prose composition to that of high\r\npoetry. In spite of the trammels of words, it gives expression to the\r\nsame subtle and ethereal conceptions which inspired the genius of Liszt\r\nas a musical artist. As a sketch of the life of the great composer, it\r\npossesses an interest with which few biographical works can compare; but\r\nno details of incident could imprison the soul of the author; and a fine\r\næsthetic aroma breathes from every page, fragrant with the blossoming\r\nout of a rich, original nature, as well as with an exquisite sense of\r\nart.\r\n\r\n'Chopin was born in Poland, near Warsaw, in the year 1810. His boyhood\r\nwas marked by no events that gave promise of the greatness of his future\r\ncareer. He early became the victim of ill health, which was almost the\r\nperpetual torment of his after life. He grew up in simple and quiet\r\nhabits, surrounded by the purest influences, conversant with bright\r\nexamples of piety, modesty, and integrity, which gave to his imagination\r\n'the velvety tenderness that characterizes the plants which have never\r\nbeen exposed to the dust of the beaten highways.' Commencing the study\r\nof music when he was but nine years old, he was soon after confided to a\r\npassionate disciple of Sebastian Bach, who for many years directed his\r\nstudies in accordance with the prevailing classic models. Through the\r\nliberality of a distinguished patron of art, Prince Radziwill, he was\r\nplaced in one of the first colleges in Warsaw, where he received a\r\nfinished education in every branch of learning. The following picture,\r\nalthough partaking of the nature of a fancy piece, is introduced by\r\nLiszt, from the pen of one of the greatest living writers of fiction, as\r\na just representation of the youthful artist at this period of his life.\r\n\r\n     'Gentle, sensitive, and very lovely, at fifteen years of age he\r\n     united the charms of adolescence with the gravity of a more\r\n     mature age. He was delicate both in body and in mind. Through\r\n     the want of muscular development he retained a peculiar beauty,\r\n     an exceptional physiognomy, which had, if we may venture so to\r\n     speak, neither age nor sex. It was not the bold and masculine\r\n     air of a descendant of a race of magnates, who know nothing but\r\n     drinking, hunting, and making war; neither was it the\r\n     effeminate loveliness of a cherub _couleur de rose_. It was\r\n     more like the ideal creations with which the poetry of the\r\n     Middle Ages adorned the Christian temples: a beautiful angel,\r\n     with a form pure and slight as a young god of Olympus, with a\r\n     face like that of a majestic woman filled with a divine sorrow,\r\n     and as the crown of all, an expression at the same time tender\r\n     and severe, chaste and impassioned.\r\n\r\n     'This expression revealed the depths of his being. Nothing\r\n     could be purer, more exalted than his thoughts; nothing more\r\n     tenacious, more exclusive, more intensely devoted, than his\r\n     affections.... But he could only understand that which closely\r\n     resembled himself.... Everything else only existed for him as a\r\n     kind of annoying dream which he tried to shake off while living\r\n     with the rest of the world. Always plunged in reveries,\r\n     realities displeased him. As a child, he could never touch a\r\n     sharp instrument without injuring himself with it; as a man, he\r\n     never found himself face to face with a being different from\r\n     himself without being wounded by the living contradiction....\r\n\r\n     'He was preserved from a constant antagonism by a voluntary and\r\n     almost inveterate habit of never seeing or hearing anything\r\n     which was disagreeable to him, unless it touched upon his\r\n     personal affections. The beings who did not think as he did,\r\n     were only phantoms in his eyes. As his manners were polished\r\n     and graceful, it was easy to mistake his cold disdain or\r\n     insurmountable aversion for benevolent courtesy....\r\n\r\n     'He never spent an hour in open-hearted expansiveness, without\r\n     compensating for it by a season of reserve. The moral causes\r\n     which induced such reserve were too slight, too subtle, to be\r\n     discovered by the naked eye. It was necessary to use the\r\n     microscope to read his soul, into which so little of the light\r\n     of the living ever penetrated....\r\n\r\n     'With such a character, it seems strange he should have had\r\n     friends: yet he had them, not only the friends of his mother,\r\n     who esteemed him as the noble son of a noble mother, but\r\n     friends of his own age, who loved him ardently, and who were\r\n     loved by him in return.... He had formed a high ideal of\r\n     friendship; in the age of early illusions he loved to think\r\n     that his friends and himself, brought up nearly in the same\r\n     manner, with the same principles, would never change their\r\n     opinions, and that no formal disagreement could ever occur\r\n     between them....\r\n\r\n     'He was externally so affectionate, his education had been so\r\n     finished, and he possessed so much natural grace, that he had\r\n     the gift of pleasing even where he was not personally known.\r\n     His exceeding loveliness was immediately prepossessing, the\r\n     delicacy of his constitution rendered him interesting in the\r\n     eyes of women, the full yet graceful cultivation of his mind,\r\n     the sweet and captivating originality of his conversation,\r\n     gained for him the attention of the most enlightened men. Men\r\n     less highly cultivated, liked him for his exquisite courtesy of\r\n     manner. They were so much the more pleased with this, because,\r\n     in their simplicity, they never imagined it was the graceful\r\n     fulfilment of a duty into which no real sympathy entered.\r\n\r\n     'Could such people have divined the secrets of his mystic\r\n     character, they would have said he was more amiable than\r\n     loving--and with respect to them, this would have been true.\r\n     But how could they have known that his real, though rare\r\n     attachments, were so vivid, so profound, so undying?...\r\n\r\n     'Association with him in the details of life was delightful. He\r\n     filled all the forms of friendship with an unaccustomed charm,\r\n     and when he expressed his gratitude, it was with that deep\r\n     emotion which recompenses kindness with usury. He willingly\r\n     imagined that he felt himself every day dying; he accepted the\r\n     cares of a friend, hiding from him, lest it should render him\r\n     unhappy, the little time he expected to profit by them. He\r\n     possessed great physical courage, and if he did not accept with\r\n     the heroic recklessness of youth the idea of approaching death,\r\n     at least he cherished the expectation of it with a kind of\r\n     bitter pleasure.'...\r\n\r\n'After completing his studies in harmony with a celebrated master, he\r\ncomplied with the wishes of his parents, who desired that he should\r\ntravel, in order that he should become familiar with the best musical\r\nproductions under the advantage of their perfect execution. For this\r\npurpose he visited many of the German cities, and was absent from Warsaw\r\non one of his excursions when the revolution broke out in the autumn of\r\n1830. He was thus forced to remain in Vienna, and was heard there in\r\nsome concerts, but failed to receive the appreciation from the artistic\r\npublic of that city which he had a right to anticipate. Leaving Vienna,\r\nhe repaired to Paris, which was henceforth to be the scene of his\r\nbrilliant triumphs. His constitution, being frail and delicate, could\r\nnot long sustain the rude shocks of life unscathed, and we accordingly\r\nfind Chopin at the age of thirty with rapidly declining health; and for\r\nthe next decade, his existence was only a continued succession of the\r\nalternations of disease. At last, he began to fail so rapidly that the\r\nfears of his friends assumed the shape of despair. He scarcely ever left\r\nhis bed, and spoke but rarely.\r\n\r\n     'His sister, upon receiving this intelligence, came from Warsaw\r\n     to take her place at his pillow, which she left no more. He\r\n     witnessed the anguish, the presentiments, the redoubled sadness\r\n     around him, without showing what impression they made upon him.\r\n     He thought of death with Christian calm and resignation, yet he\r\n     did not cease to prepare for the morrow. From week to week and\r\n     soon from day to day, the cold shadow of death gained upon him.\r\n     His end was rapidly approaching; his sufferings became more and\r\n     more intense; his crises grew more frequent, and at each\r\n     accelerated occurrence resembled more and more a mortal agony.\r\n     He retained his presence of mind, his vivid will upon their\r\n     intermission, until the last; neither losing the precision of\r\n     his ideas, nor the clear perception of his intentions. The\r\n     wishes which he expressed in his short moments of respite,\r\n     evinced the calm solemnity with which he contemplated the\r\n     approach of death.'\r\n\r\n'The inevitable hour came finally not without a certain strange,\r\nromantic beauty in its solemn aspects.\r\n\r\n     'The parlor adjoining the chamber of Chopin was constantly\r\n     occupied by some of his friends, who, one by one, in turn,\r\n     approached him to receive a sign of recognition, a look of\r\n     affection, when he was no longer able to address them in words.\r\n     On Sunday, the 15th of October, his attacks were more violent\r\n     and more frequent--lasting for several hours in succession. He\r\n     endured them with patience and great strength of mind. The\r\n     Countess Delphine Potocka, who was present, was much\r\n     distressed; her tears were flowing fast when he observed her\r\n     standing at the foot of his bed; tall, slight, draped in white,\r\n     resembling the beautiful angels created by the imagination of\r\n     the most devout among the painters. Without doubt, he supposed\r\n     her to be a celestial apparition; and when the crisis left him\r\n     a moment in repose, he requested her to sing; they deemed him\r\n     at first seized with delirium, but he eagerly repeated his\r\n     request. Who could have ventured to oppose his wish? The piano\r\n     was rolled from his parlor to the door of his chamber, while,\r\n     with sobs in her voice, and tears streaming down her cheeks,\r\n     his gifted countrywoman sang. Certainly, this delightful voice\r\n     had never before attained an expression so full of profound\r\n     pathos. He seemed to suffer less as he listened. She sang that\r\n     famous Canticle to the Virgin, which, it is said, once saved\r\n     the life of Siradella. 'How beautiful it is!' he exclaimed. 'My\r\n     God, how very beautiful! Again--again!' Though overwhelmed with\r\n     emotion, the Countess had the noble courage to comply with the\r\n     last wish of a friend, a compatriot; she again took a seat at\r\n     the piano, and sang a hymn from Marcello. Chopin again feeling\r\n     worse, everybody was seized with fright--by a spontaneous\r\n     impulse all who were present threw themselves upon their\r\n     knees--no one ventured to speak; the sacred silence was only\r\n     broken by the voice of the Countess, floating, like a melody\r\n     from heaven, above the sighs and sobs which formed its heavy\r\n     and mournful earth accompaniment. It was the haunted hour of\r\n     twilight; a dying light lent its mysterious shadows to this sad\r\n     scene--the sister of Chopin, prostrated near his bed, wept and\r\n     prayed--and never quitted this attitude of supplication while\r\n     the life of the brother she had so cherished lasted.\r\n\r\n     'His condition altered for the worse during the night, but he\r\n     felt more tranquil upon Monday morning, and as if he had known\r\n     in advance the appointed and propitious moment, he asked to\r\n     receive immediately the last sacraments. In the absence of the\r\n     Abbé ----, with whom he had been very intimate since their\r\n     common expatriation, he requested that the Abbé Jelowicki, one\r\n     of the most distinguished men of the Polish emigration, should\r\n     be sent for. When the holy Viaticum was administered to him, he\r\n     received it, surrounded by those who loved him, with great\r\n     devotion. He called his friends a short time afterward, one by\r\n     one, to his bedside, to give each of them his last earnest\r\n     blessing; calling down the grace of God fervently upon\r\n     themselves, their affections, and their hopes--every knee\r\n     bent--every head bowed--all eyes were heavy with tears--every\r\n     heart was sad and oppressed--every soul elevated.\r\n\r\n     'Attacks, more and more painful, returned and continued during\r\n     the day; from Monday night until Tuesday, he did not utter a\r\n     single word. He did not seem able to distinguish the persons\r\n     who were around him. About eleven o'clock on Tuesday evening he\r\n     appeared to revive a little. The Abbé Jelowicki had never left\r\n     him. Hardly had he recovered the power of speech, than he\r\n     requested him to recite with him the prayers and litanies for\r\n     the dying. He was able to accompany the Abbé in an audible and\r\n     intelligible voice. From this moment until his death, he held\r\n     his head constantly supported upon the shoulder of M. Gutman,\r\n     who, during the whole course of this sickness, had devoted his\r\n     days and nights to him.\r\n\r\n     'A convulsive sleep lasted until the 17th of October, 1849. The\r\n     final agony commenced about two o'clock; a cold sweat ran\r\n     profusely from his brow; after a short drowsiness, he assessed\r\n     in a voice scarcely audible: 'Who is near me?' Being answered;\r\n     he bent his head to kiss the hand of M. Gutman, who still\r\n     supported it--while giving this last tender proof of love and\r\n     gratitude, the soul of the artist left its fragile clay. He\r\n     died as he had lived--in loving.\r\n\r\n     'His love for flowers being well known, they were brought in\r\n     such quantities the next day, that the bed in which they had\r\n     placed them, and indeed the whole room, almost disappeared,\r\n     hidden by their varied and brilliant hues. He seemed to repose\r\n     in a garden of roses. His face regained its early beauty, its\r\n     purity of expression, its long unwonted serenity. Calmly--with\r\n     his youthful loveliness, so long dimmed by bitter suffering,\r\n     restored by death--he slept among the flowers he loved, the\r\n     last long and dreamless sleep!'\r\n\r\n'We must not forget to thank the intelligent translator of this volume\r\nfor the fidelity with which she has executed her by no means easy task.\r\nThe elevated, almost aerial conceptions of Liszt, often seeming as if\r\nthey disdained the bonds of language, are presented in lucid, idiomatic\r\nEnglish, which derives a certain vital force more from warmth of\r\nsympathy with the original than from the use of any of the arts of\r\nvigorous expression.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     ROCKFORD; or, Sunshine and Storm. By Mrs. LILLIE DEVEREUX\r\n     UMSTED. Author of Southwold. Carleton, publisher, 413 Broadway,\r\n     New York.\r\n\r\nA novel of considerable ability. The characters are well drawn, and the\r\nmoral unexceptionable. The scenes occur in fashionable life; the\r\ndescriptions are vivid, the conversations (in which it abounds) are easy\r\nand sparkling, and the pictures of social life varied and interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n     GOOD THOUGHTS IN BAD TIMES, AND OTHER PAPERS. By THOMAS FULLER,\r\n     D. D. Price, $1.50. Ticknor & Fields, Boston.\r\n\r\nColeridge says of Fuller: 'Next to Shakespeare, I am not certain whether\r\nhe, beyond all other writers, does not excite in me the sense and\r\nemotion of the marvellous.'\r\n\r\nThomas Fuller was born in 1608, was a chaplain in the army during the\r\ngreat civil war in England, and died in 1661, so that much of his\r\nfifty-four years of life was spent among no very peaceful scenes. He\r\nfollowed the army with a loyal heart and courageous spirit, and wrought\r\nearnestly to mitigate the violence of hostile parties. One of the wisest\r\nand wittiest divines who have ever ascended the pulpit, he has left\r\nbehind him a fame second to none who have labored to elevate and make\r\ntheir fellow creatures better. 'Untiring humor seemed the ruling passion\r\nof his soul. With a heart open to all innocent pleasures, purged from\r\nthe leaven of malice and uncharitableness, it was as natural that he\r\nshould be full of mirth as it is for the grasshopper to chirp or bee to\r\nhum, or the birds to warble in the spring breeze and bright sunshine.'\r\n\r\nHis good thoughts are clothed in pure and beautiful language, are wise,\r\nquaint, genial, and witty. Being collected and matured during his\r\nmarches and countermarches through the country at the time of the great\r\ncivil war, we look upon their present publication as very timely and\r\njudicious, considering the disturbed state of our own suffering country.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE GENTLEMAN. By GEORGE H. CALVERT. Ticknor & Fields. Boston.\r\n     Price, 75 cts.\r\n\r\nA book which we hope will have a wide circulation, and exercise a\r\nbeneficial influence in this country. It is no superficial essay on\r\nexternal matters of etiquette, or even of mere æsthetic culture: it goes\r\nto the very heart of the meaning of the abused word, Gentleman, and\r\nproves its root to be _unselfishness_. The author says: 'It is the\r\n_moral_ element which, in my conception of the gentleman, is pivotal.\r\nDealing with the highest type, I conceive that in that type not only are\r\nmorals primary, but that manners result from them; so that where there\r\nis not a solid substratum of pure, elevated feeling there cannot be a\r\nclean, high, and unaffected demeanor.' 'The true gentleman is a\r\nChristian product.\r\n\r\n              'The best of men\r\n    That e'er wore earth about him was a sufferer,\r\n    A soft, meek, patient, humble, tranquil spirit,\r\n    The first true gentleman that ever breathed.''\r\n\r\nThese views are illustrated with genius and scholarship. Their\r\ndissemination among ourselves is especially important, because our ideas\r\nof what is requisite to form a gentleman are essentially vague, crude,\r\nunformed, and often false.\r\n\r\nIt is no dull book of commonplace thoughts, but a high and noble essay\r\non an important subject, and we commend it to the attention of our\r\nreaders. Let him who would look upon the reverse of the gentleman, turn\r\nto the Editor's Table of the July issue of THE CONTINENTAL, and regard\r\nthe repulsive sketch of the 'Southern Colonel,' whose ideal seems to be\r\n'Brandy Smash and Cocktails.' Alas! that such ideals too frequently\r\noccur among ourselves. Bayard and Sir Philip Sydney are valuable studies\r\nfor our own young and gallant soldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n     POINT OF HONOR. By the Author of the 'Morals of May Fair,'\r\n     'Creeds,' &c., &c. Harper & Brothers, publishers, Franklin\r\n     Square, New York.\r\n\r\nThis is no sensational tale. Its interest is not derived from intricacy\r\nof plot or mysterious developments; it presents us with admirable\r\nstudies of male and female character, the traits of which are manifested\r\nin the progress of the plot. The portraits are detailed, natural, and\r\nliving; the heroine feminine and lovely. The moral is good, and the\r\n'Point of Honor' ably displayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n     SCIENCE FOR THE SCHOOL AND FAMILY. Part I. Natural Philosophy.\r\n     By WORTHINGTON HOOKER, M. D., Professor of the Theory and\r\n     Practice of Medicine in Yale College, Author of 'Human\r\n     Physiology,' 'Child's Book of Nature,' 'Natural History,' &c.,\r\n     Illustrated by nearly 300 engravings. Harper & Brothers,\r\n     publishers, Franklin Square, New York.\r\n\r\nA valuable offering to teachers and pupils.\r\n\r\nProfessor Hooker has published a graduated series of books, carefully\r\nadapted to the different periods of the course of study; exceedingly\r\nsimple for the beginner, stepping carefully from the known to the\r\nunknown, and widening their range with the increasing knowledge and\r\nmental growth of the student. The first in the graduated series is the\r\n'Child's Book of Common Things.' Next, the 'Child's Book of Nature,' in\r\nthree Parts, viz.: 'Plants,' 'Animals,' 'Air, Water, Light, Heat,'--then\r\nfollow the 'First Book in Chemistry' and 'First Book in Physiology.' The\r\nnext step in the gradation brings us to three books under one title:\r\n'Science for the School and the Family;' Part I, Natural Philosophy;\r\nPart II, Chemistry; Part III, Mineralogy and Geology.\r\n\r\nOur author says: 'One grand essential for giving interest to any study\r\nis the presentation of the various points in the _natural order_ in\r\nwhich they should enter the mind. _They should be so presented that each\r\nportion of a book shall make the following portions more interesting and\r\nmore easily understood._ This principle I have endeavored to observe\r\nstrictly in the preparation of my volumes.' We believe Professor Hooker\r\nhas succeeded in the observation of this principle, and that its\r\nobservation must insure success.\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE STORY OF THE GUARD: A Chronicle of the War. By JESSIE\r\n     BENTON FREMONT. Knapsack Edition. Price, 50 cts. Ticknor &\r\n     Fields, Boston.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to see this little work of affection and patriotism from the\r\nhand of a gifted lady (who says: 'For any personal object I should never\r\nuse my name, which has been to me a _double_ charge to keep; but I think\r\nmy father would more than approve, when it is to do justice, and to aid\r\nthe widow and the orphan') already passed into the _sixth_ edition.\r\n\r\n'To do justice to brave men and to aid the widow and orphan!' What\r\nnobler motive could there be for publishing a book, than the prevailing\r\none so simply given by Mrs. Fremont in the lines just quoted! Truly the\r\nmost determined hater of the so much read and so much abused 'women's\r\nbooks,' must cease to sneer in acknowledging that here indeed was\r\ninducement sufficient to make the most timid and shrinking of the sex\r\nface the frowns of the critic, the scoff of the antagonistic politician,\r\nand the astonishment of the fashionable world that one who had long been\r\none of its most brilliant ornaments should condescend to become known as\r\nan authoress! We heartily congratulate her on the success of her book,\r\nwhich, as achieving its object, must be dear to her heart. Very\r\ncharming, too, are the extracts given from General Fremont's letters.\r\nDomestic love and peace are surely holy!\r\n\r\n'To do justice to brave men!' 'Major Zagonyi, with one hundred and fifty\r\nof the body guard, attacked and drove from Springfield over two thousand\r\nrebels, with a loss of only fifteen men.' All honor to the brave\r\nZagonyi! His Hungarian English is strong, graphic, simple, and, like\r\nhimself, true. With a thorough military education, dauntless courage,\r\nuntiring energy, and a natural, perhaps national, love for horses and\r\nhorsemanship, we doubt not he is one of the best cavalry officers in our\r\nservice. He has long chafed under a forced inaction, and, full of\r\nunselfish devotion, burns to do and dare in what he believes to be the\r\ncause of freedom and humanity. May he soon add fresh laurels to his\r\nglorious Springfield wreath--and may the same gentle chronicler again\r\ntwine them for his brave brow!\r\n\r\n\r\n     SUBSTANCE AND SHADOW; or, Morality and Religion in their\r\n     Relation to Life: An Essay upon the Physics of Creation. By\r\n     HENRY JAMES. Ticknor & Fields, Boston.\r\n\r\nWe advise such of our readers as take interest in metaphysical theology,\r\nin the vexed questions of the origin of evil, of free will, of God's\r\ncommunication with the spirit of man, of the growth of faith in the\r\nsoul, to read this book for themselves. We are not Swedenborgians,\r\nthough we believe Swedenborg to have been a great and good man; we do\r\nnot deem ourselves able to pronounce upon the truths or errors\r\nelaborated in the pages of Mr. James's book, but we feel convinced that\r\nits author is as sincere as able, and that he really aims at reaching\r\nthe heart and marrow of his important subjects. His argument with the\r\nGerman and Scotch philosophies is profound and skilful. He is a believer\r\nin revelation, in its unfolding a true philosophy of the Infinite;\r\nshowing how the infinite is contained in the finite, the absolute in the\r\nrelative, not spatially or by continuation, but by exact correspondency,\r\nas the soul is contained in the body. He always steers clear of the\r\nshoals of atheism, and of the dim and chaotic abysses of pantheism. He\r\nis often obscure, but has the power to be concise and luminous. His\r\nstyle is vigorous, though we object to the meaning he attaches to two\r\nwords very dear to the human heart: for _religion_ is not _ritualism_,\r\nnor is _morality_ made of the starched buckram of _selfhood_. Religion\r\nis love to God--morality, love to our neighbor. We differ from him in\r\nmany of his positions, his standpoint is not ours, but he struggles\r\nbravely to rescue philosophy from a degrading bondage to sense, and to\r\nrestore her to the service of revelation. No analysis within our present\r\nlimits would avail to combat the errors, to make manifest the truths\r\ncontained in the book, nor do we feel ourselves competent to undertake\r\nthe task.\r\n\r\nIf the lucid and vigorous writer, author of the article entitled 'Mill\r\non Liberty' in our June issue, as well as of some able remarks headed\r\n'Matter and Spirit' published in the Editor's Table of the July number\r\nof THE CONTINENTAL, would review this book of Mr. James, he might be\r\nable to pour a flood of light on many mooted questions, many\r\nmetaphysical queries; for a clear mind is a marvellous solvent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WESTERN LAW MONTHLY.

Even while we write this\r\nsentence, a great battle is raging in one of the fairest valleys of\r\nPennsylvania, and although the actual struggle is destined to be\r\ndecisive in its bearing, there is no possibility of knowing how the\r\nstrife goes from hour to hour. Issues of immense and incalculable\r\nimportance are involved in the immediate result: the cities of\r\nWashington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, to say nothing of the existence\r\nof the nation itself, so gravely imperilled, on the one hand; and\r\nRichmond, with all the desperate hopes and daring purposes of the\r\nrebellion, on the other, are the mighty stakes played for in the bloody\r\ngame now going on upon the chessboard in the vicinity of Gettysburg.\r\n\r\nWith the overthrow of Lee's army, and its effectual cut off from escape,\r\nnot only will come the speedy fall of Richmond, but the rebellion itself\r\nwill be virtually at an end; for it will never be able to recover from\r\nthe blow. On the other hand, with the complete discomfiture of our own\r\narmy, we should be temporarily at the mercy of the enemy, as we do not\r\nseem to have contemplated the contingency of defeat, and have made\r\nlittle preparation for it. The victorious Lee would drive our shattered\r\nforces into Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia, and would follow\r\nclose upon their heels with his irresistible columns. Dark would be the\r\nday for our country and for human liberty, and terrible would be the\r\nstruggle made necessary afterward to enable us to recover from so great\r\na disaster. Assuredly we would be able to recover; and in this fact lies\r\nour great superiority over the adversary, who stakes his all upon the\r\nissue of this desperate and reckless invasion into the heart of the\r\nloyal States. But, with all our confidence in the justice and ultimate\r\ntriumph of our cause, how great is the patriotic anxiety with which our\r\nhearts are burdened, and how intensely earnest are the prayers we offer\r\nto the Most High for the success of our noble army in the pending\r\nbattle! In our excited imaginations, we see only the impenetrable cloud\r\nof smoke which envelops the bloody field; we hear the loud thunders of\r\nthe murderous artillery, the rattle of musketry, the groans of the\r\nwounded and dying, and the shouts of infuriated columns as they rush\r\ninto the jaws of death, and are rolled away on the fiery billows of the\r\nmighty conflict. We feel all the frenzy of the deadly strife as if we\r\nwere in the midst of it; and yet, though we strain our inward vision to\r\nthe utmost, no ray of light comes from the terrible scene to inform us\r\nhow the scale of victory inclines. We only know that thousands of our\r\nbrothers lie on the battle field dead or dying, wounded and suffering,\r\nand we anticipate the melancholy wail which their wives and children,\r\ntheir brothers and friends will utter on the morrow. Shall it be mingled\r\nwith shouts of victory, and softened by the sweet consolation that the\r\ndeath and suffering of so many noble victims have been repaid by the\r\nsafety of our country, and the reëstablishment of liberty under the\r\nglorious Constitution of our fathers?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE RELIEF.--Time rolls on. In spite of anxieties and torturing\r\nuncertainties; over broken hearts and ruined hopes; over fields of\r\nslaughter, where the harvest of death has been garnered in abundance so\r\ngreat as to sicken the soul of man; over pillaged cities and countries\r\nlaid waste; over all the works of man, good and bad, time rolls on,\r\ncareless alike of the joys and sorrows, the victories and defeats of\r\nmen and nations. And, with the steady and remorseless march of time,\r\nevents, however bound up with the mightiest interests of mankind,\r\nnecessarily hasten to their consummation. The web of fate is\r\nunravelled--the tide of battle flows in its irrevocable course, and\r\nhaving stranded the hopes of the defeated power, there is no ebb, no\r\nreflux, by which the disaster may be undone, and the ruined cause\r\nrestored again to prosperity and hope.\r\n\r\nGradually the cloud breaks away from the battle field, and the various\r\nincidents and accomplished results of the contest become known. The\r\nsilent, faithful wires, stretching away to the intervening cities and\r\nvillages, are burdened with their mysterious messages, to be delivered\r\nfrom time to time to the expectant crowds who await them with eager\r\nimpatience. With the dawn of Independence Day, some gleams of light come\r\nup from the scene of conflict, and some encouraging words are heard from\r\nhigh quarters. In their patriotic assemblages, the people are full of\r\nhope and confidence, though still not without intense anxiety with\r\nregard to the final result, yet imperfectly made known. Every additional\r\nmessage, with which the wires tremble, makes the hopeful impression\r\nstronger and stronger; and, upon the whole, the 4th of July, 1863, is a\r\nday of rejoicing to all those who love their country and desire to see\r\nit restored to its pristine vigor and glory. Scarcely a doubt remains\r\nthat the daring traitors have been defeated and the country saved;\r\nthough it is yet uncertain whether the victory will be complete and the\r\narmy of the enemy scattered and destroyed or captured.\r\n\r\nIf by possibility Lee should again escape and make his way back to the\r\nexhausted fields of Eastern Virginia, there may still be some hard work\r\nfor our armies in order to put a final end to the great rebellion. But\r\nthe failure of this last desperate enterprise gives the deathblow to the\r\nwicked and ambitious power of the usurpers at the head of the pretended\r\nconfederacy. They may obstruct our march and harass our armies, but they\r\ncan no longer hope to place any permanent obstacle in the way of our\r\nprogress toward the restoration of the Union. The tide has turned at\r\nlast. We have seen the darkest day of our mortal struggle, and the hour\r\nof deliverance is at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND WAR.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is the foundation of all other industries. It is quite as\r\nindispensable for the support of armies in the field as it is for that\r\nof commerce and manufactures in the halcyon days of national repose. If\r\nthose who have gone forth with arms in their hands to do battle for the\r\npreservation of our free government are performing services of the\r\nhighest importance to the nation, those also who remain at home to till\r\nthe earth are doing work indispensable to the success of our sacred\r\ncause. If they do not strike the enemy with their hoes and scythes, they\r\nat least sustain and invigorate those who carry the bayonet and meet the\r\nshock of actual war.\r\n\r\nUnder all circumstances the great operations of agriculture must still\r\ngo on. The seasons do not cease their appointed rounds; the sun does not\r\nfail to dispense his genial stores of light and heat; nor do the\r\nfertilizing showers of heaven refuse to descend upon the soil, because\r\nthe fierce passions of man have aroused him to discord and battle.\r\nNature still maintains her serenity in the midst of all the fearful\r\nagitations of mankind; and she still scatters her blessings with a\r\nlavish hand, though they may be trampled under foot by the gathering\r\nhosts of infuriated men. Even, therefore, while the human tempest rages\r\naround us, we may well pause to contemplate the peaceful beneficence of\r\nnature, and to rejoice in the thought that all the wickedness and\r\nviolence of man cannot provoke or derange into confusion and disorder\r\nthe great natural elements which minister to his comfort and\r\nhappiness--which cause the seed to germinate, the flower to bloom, and\r\nthe fruit to ripen, regardless of all his passions, and in spite of his\r\ningratitude. The unambitious pursuits of the husbandman may have in them\r\nnothing of the pomp and circumstance of glorious war; but they are at\r\nleast in harmony with the beneficence of God and the permanent interests\r\nof man; while they are also of the highest importance to the country,\r\neven in the extremity of her peril.\r\n\r\nThe harvest, now approaching, everywhere gives promise of a bounteous\r\nsupply of the productions which annually bless our favored land. The\r\nvast invading army of the enemy, soon to be driven with disaster out of\r\nthe loyal States, will have made no serious impression upon the\r\nabundance of our overflowing stores. There may be some scarcity of\r\nlabor to secure the maturing crops, but we shall still supply all our\r\nown wants abundantly, leaving a large surplus for shipment abroad, and\r\neven for meeting the necessities of our suffering brethren in the South,\r\nwhen they shall have utterly failed in their wicked purpose of\r\ndestroying the Government, and when their sharp cry of hunger and\r\nsuffering shall appeal to our relenting hearts for succor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AND THE AIR.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of all vegetation is derived from the atmosphere. The air\r\nis always loaded with watery vapor, and it contains a vast quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, which furnishes the chief material for the woody\r\nfibre of all plants, for the starch, sugar, gums, oils, and other\r\nvaluable compounds produced by them. Nitrogen, also, is one of the large\r\nconstituents of the air, and is found in it likewise in the form of\r\nammonia. It is wonderful to reflect that of all the vegetable\r\nproductions of the earth--its vast forests, the flowery clothing of its\r\nboundless prairies, the immeasurable productions raised by the industry\r\nof the whole human race in its countless fields of labor--that of all\r\nthis mighty growth which covers and adorns the face of the whole solid\r\nglobe, more than ninety-five hundredths are derived exclusively from the\r\natmosphere. This vast ocean which surrounds the earth, in which we are\r\nimmersed, and which is actually the breath of life to us, indispensable\r\nto our existence during every moment of our lives, is also the great\r\nreservoir from which the mighty vegetable world draws almost the whole\r\nof its substance. While we are inspiring the invisible fluid, and with\r\nevery breath renewing the ruddy currents of the heart and sending them\r\nglowing with warmth and vitality to all the extremities of the frame,\r\nevery leaf in the mighty forest, and every herb, and flower, and blade\r\nof grass on the surface of the whole earth, is maintaining a similar\r\ncommerce with the air, drawing from its boundless stores of carbon,\r\npiling up cell upon cell and adding fibre to fibre, until trunk, and\r\nbranch, and stem, and leaf, with all the gorgeous productions of\r\nvegetable life, stand forth in their maturity, filling the bosom of the\r\nconscious atmosphere with wonderful creations of beauty and fruits of\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nBut in fact the atmosphere is only an appendage to the solid earth,\r\nexisting in that plastic form which is necessary to the creation both of\r\nanimal and vegetable life. It is her breath, by which, as the minister\r\nof God, she breathes life into the nostrils of men and animals, and\r\nimparts vitality and growth to all plants. But in this life-giving\r\nprocess, she furnishes also a part, minute though it be, of her own\r\nproper substance. Consume with fire the trees of the forest, or the\r\ngrass of the prairie, and though the greater part of the burning mass\r\nwill disappear and mingle with the air from which it came, there will\r\nyet remain the ashes, which cannot be dissipated, but must return again\r\nto the earth which gave them. These solid constituents of plants are the\r\ncontributions of the soil; and though they seem to be comparatively\r\ninconsiderable, yet when taken in connection with the large operations\r\nof agriculture continued through a series of years, they become so great\r\nas to be of the utmost importance. They perform an interesting part in\r\nthe economy of vegetable life, for they are to the plant what the bones\r\nare to the animal. In the stalks of wheat and Indian corn, as indeed of\r\nall the grasses, the flinty surface is constituted largely of silex; as\r\nthe shells of crustacea and the bones of animals are composed mostly of\r\nlime. Without these earthy substances, nothing that grows from the soil\r\ncan come to perfection. They are equally important to animals and to man\r\nhimself, who receives them from the vegetable world and assimilates them\r\nin his own marvellous organization--building up his bony frame with the\r\nlime of the earth; filling his veins with its iron; constructing the\r\nvery seat and citadel of the soul, and flashing its spiritual mandates\r\nthrough the nerves, by the help of the phosphorus which he derives from\r\nthe soil through the elaboration of plants and inferior animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE'RE NOT TIRED OF FIGHTING YET!\r\n\r\n    Oh, we're not tired of fighting yet!\r\n    We're not the boys to frighten yet!\r\n      While drums are drumming we'll be coming,\r\n      With the ball and bayonet!\r\n    For we can hit while they can pound,\r\n    And so let's have another round!\r\n    Secesh is bound to lick the ground,\r\n      And we'll be in their pantry yet!\r\n\r\n    Oh, we're not tired of tramping yet--\r\n    Of soldier life or camping yet;\r\n      And rough or level, man or devil,\r\n      We are game for stamping yet.\r\n    We've lived through weather wet and dry,\r\n    Through hail and fire, without a cry;\r\n    We wouldn't freeze, and couldn't fry,\r\n      And haven't got through our ramping yet!\r\n\r\n    We haven't broke up the party yet;\r\n    We're rough, and tough, and hearty yet;\r\n      Who talks of going pays what's owing,\r\n      And there's a bill will smart ye yet!\r\n    So bang the doors, and lock 'em tight!\r\n    Secesh, you've got to make it right!\r\n    We'll have a little dance to-night;\r\n      You can't begin to travel yet!\r\n\r\n    Oh, we're not tired of fighting yet,\r\n    Nor ripe for disuniting yet!\r\n      Before they do it, or get through it,\r\n      There'll be some savage biting yet!\r\n    Then hip, hurrah for Uncle Sam!\r\n    And down with all secesh and sham!\r\n    From Davis to Vallandigham,\r\n      They all shall rue their treason yet!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe cannot close the present number of THE CONTINENTAL without a few\r\nwords of fervid congratulation to our readers and countrymen. We may\r\ngreet each other now with glad hearts and uplifted brows. What a\r\nglorious \"Fourth\" was ours, with our Eagle scattering the heavy\r\nwar-clouds which hung around us, soaring to gaze once more undazzled at\r\nthe sun of liberty; our stars again shining down clear upon us from\r\ntheir heaven of light! Joy sparkles in every eye, and high, strong words\r\nflash from every tongue. Grant victorious--Vicksburg ours--the army of\r\nthe Potomac covered with glory--Meade everywhere triumphant, and in full\r\npursuit of our flying and disheartened foe! Heroes and soldiers, your\r\ncountry blesses and thanks you!\r\n\r\nLet us now resolve that with every day our Union shall grow closer. Let\r\nfaction die; political intrigue cease to rear its serpent head; let\r\ndoubt become trust; suspicion, faith! Countrymen, let us also learn to\r\npity the unhappy race whom this war must free. You cannot now prevent\r\nit; its first tocsin of liberty pealed with the first gun fired at Fort\r\nSumter. After long ages of barbaric night, of slavery, of misery, these\r\nbeings cut in ebony begin to robe themselves as men; on the battle field\r\nthey have at last put on the virile toga dyed in blood, not now drawn by\r\nthe lash from the back of the wretched chattel, but from the heart of\r\nthe man face to face with his oppressor on the field of righteous\r\nbattle. Rude and uncultured, they hold up to you hands hard with labor,\r\nstill bleeding from the scarcely fallen manacles, and implore aid and\r\nmanly mercy. Let it be granted without stint, and let not the freedom\r\nGod has given, become a curse to them! You cannot roll back the stately\r\nsteppings of destiny--and let this great and magnanimous people show its\r\nmagnanimity now!\r\n\r\nAnd, oh, ye glorious dead, now resting in eternal peace, whom the drum\r\nand fife will rouse no more to superhuman effort in our behalf, sweet be\r\nyour sleep in the heart of the country you died to save, and ever green\r\nthe laurel above your grassy graves! We will not forget you, wrapped in\r\nyour gory shrouds for the land ye loved! Never shall our national hymns\r\nagain greet our ears without awakening tender thoughts of you! Hot, sad\r\ntears will mourn your loss in the homes your smiles shall light no\r\nmore--but your names shall be an heirloom of glory to your mothers,\r\nwives, and children, and your country will weep with them! We greet you,\r\nholy graves! As the onward path of humanity passes over your new-made\r\nmounds, her children will veil their heads and honor the martyrs who lie\r\nbelow. And when the coming centuries shall have covered you with moss\r\nand flowers, they will never forget to throw the laurel as they pass,\r\nacknowledging that these tombs have made progress and happiness\r\npossible! Brothers, the Union shall be sacred which you died to save! In\r\nthe more intense and glowing patriotism engendered by your sacrifice, we\r\nswear it on your blessed sepulchres, and this shall be your deathless\r\nepitaph!\r\n\r\n    M. W. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\n_Continental Monthly._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important position it\r\nhas assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the brilliant\r\narray of political and literary talent of the highest order which\r\nsupports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the latter is\r\nabundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection of its\r\ncounsels in many important public events, and in the character and power\r\nof those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThough but little more than a year has elapsed since the CONTINENTAL was\r\nfirst established, it has during that time acquired a strength and a\r\npolitical significance elevating it to a position far above that\r\npreviously occupied by any publication of the kind in America. In proof\r\nof which assertion we call attention to the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. Of its POLITICAL articles republished in pamphlet form, a single one\r\nhas had, thus far, a circulation of _one hundred and six thousand_\r\ncopies.\r\n\r\n2. From its LITERARY department, a single serial novel, \"Among the\r\nPines,\" has, within a very few months, sold nearly _thirty-five\r\nthousand_ copies. Two other series of its literary articles have also\r\nbeen republished in book form, while the first portion of a third is\r\nalready in press.\r\n\r\nNo more conclusive facts need be alleged to prove the excellence of the\r\ncontributions to the CONTINENTAL, or their _extraordinary popularity_;\r\nand its conductors are determined that it shall not fall behind.\r\nPreserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which a thousand\r\njournals have attributed to it, it will greatly enlarge its circle of\r\naction, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every principle involved in\r\nthe great questions of the day. The first minds of the country,\r\nembracing the men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are among its contributors; and it is no mere\r\n\"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say that this \"magazine for the\r\ntimes\" will employ the first intellect in America, under auspices which\r\nno publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the great\r\nquestions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal: much the\r\nlarger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore, by\r\ntales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be found,\r\nunder its new staff of Editors, occupying a position and presenting\r\nattractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                           TERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n    Two copies for one year,                 Five dollars.\r\n    Three copies for one year,               Six dollars.\r\n    Six copies for one year,                 Eleven dollars.\r\n    Eleven copies for one year,              Twenty dollars.\r\n    Twenty copies for one year,              Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\nPAID IN ADVANCE.\r\n\r\n_Postage, Thirty six cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\nSINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\nThree dollars a year, IN ADVANCE. _Postage paid by the Publisher._\r\n\r\n    JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 50 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 85,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. DAIRY FARMING also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\n_The experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant._\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles.
