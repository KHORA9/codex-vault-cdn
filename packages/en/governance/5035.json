SPEAKER AND MEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nIt is a very gratifying privilege to come to the Congress with the Republic\r\nat peace with all the nations of the world. More, it is equally gratifying\r\nto report that our country is not only free from every impending, menace of\r\nwar, but there are growing assurances of the permanency of the peace which\r\nwe so deeply cherish.\r\n\r\nFor approximately ten years we have dwelt amid menaces of war or as\r\nparticipants in war's actualities, and the inevitable aftermath, with its\r\ndisordered conditions, bits added to the difficulties of government which\r\nadequately can not be appraised except by, those who are in immediate\r\ncontact and know the responsibilities. Our tasks would be less difficult if\r\nwe had only ourselves to consider, but so much of the world was involved,\r\nthe disordered conditions are so well-nigh universal, even among nations\r\nnot engaged in actual warfare, that no permanent readjustments can be\r\neffected without consideration of our inescapable relationship to world\r\naffairs in finance and trade. Indeed, we should be unworthy of our best\r\ntraditions if we were unmindful of social, moral, and political conditions\r\nwhich are not of direct concern to us, but which do appeal to the human\r\nsympathies and the very becoming interest of a people blest with our\r\nnational good fortune.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to bring to you a program of world restoration. In the\r\nmain such a program must be worked out by the nations more directly\r\nconcerned. They must themselves turn to the heroic remedies for the\r\nmenacing conditions under which they are struggling, then we can help, and\r\nwe mean to help. We shall do so unselfishly because there is compensation\r\nin the consciousness of assisting, selfishly because the commerce and\r\ninternational exchanges in trade, which marked our high tide of fortunate\r\nadvancement, are possible only when the nations of all continents are\r\nrestored to stable order and normal relationship.\r\n\r\nIn the main the contribution of this Republic to restored normalcy in the\r\nworld must come through the initiative of the executive branch of the\r\nGovernment, but the best of intentions and most carefully considered\r\npurposes would fail utterly if the sanction and the cooperation of Congress\r\nwere not cheerfully accorded.\r\n\r\nI am very sure we shall have no conflict of opinion about constitutional\r\nduties or authority. During the anxieties of war, when necessity seemed\r\ncompelling there were excessive grants of authority and all extraordinary\r\nconcentration of powers in the Chief Executive. The repeal of war-time\r\nlegislation and the automatic expirations which attended the peace\r\nproclamations have put an end to these emergency excesses but I have the\r\nwish to go further than that. I want to join you ill restoring-, ill the\r\nmost cordial way, the spirit of coordination and cooperation, and that\r\nmutuality of confidence and respect which is necessary ill representative\r\npopular government.\r\n\r\nEncroachment upon the functions of Congress or attempted dictation of its\r\npolicy are not to be thought of, much less attempted, but there is all\r\ninsistent call for harmony of purpose and concord of action to speed the\r\nsolution of the difficult problems confronting both the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches of the Government.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to make allusion here to the character of our Clove\r\nGovernment, mindful as one must be that an address to you is no less it\r\nmessage to all our people, for whom you speak most intimately. Ours is it\r\npopular Government through political parties. We divide along political\r\nlines, and I would ever have it so. I do not mean that partisan preferences\r\nshould hinder any public servant in the performance of a conscientious and\r\npatriotic official duty. We saw partisan lines utterly obliterated when war\r\nimperiled, and our faith in the Republic was riveted anew. We ought not to\r\nfind these partisan lines obstructing the expeditious solution of the\r\nurgent problems of peace.\r\n\r\nGranting that we are fundamentally a representative popular Government,\r\nwith political parties the governing agencies, I believe the political\r\nparty in power should assume responsibility, determine upon policies ill\r\nthe conference which supplements conventions and election campaigns, and\r\nthen strive for achievement through adherence to the accepted policy.\r\n\r\nThere is vastly greater security, immensely more of the national\r\nviewpoint, much larger and prompter accomplishment where our divisions are\r\nalong party lines, in the broader and loftier sense, than to divide\r\ngeographically, or according to pursuits, or personal following. For a\r\ncentury and a third, parties have been charged with responsibility and held\r\nto strict accounting. When they fail, they are relieved of authority; and\r\nthe system has brought its to a national eminence no less than a world\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nNecessarily legislation is a matter of compromise. The full ideal is seldom\r\nattained. In that meeting of minds necessary to insure results, there must\r\nand will be accommodations and compromises, but in the estimate of\r\nconvictions and sincere put-poses the supreme responsibility to national\r\ninterest must not be ignored. The shield to the high-minded public servant\r\nwho adheres to party policy is manifest, but the higher purpose is the good\r\nof the Republic as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt would be ungracious to withhold acknowledgment of the really large\r\nvolume and excellent quality of work accomplished by the extraordinary\r\nsession of Congress which so recently adjourned. I am not unmindful of the\r\nvery difficult tasks with which you were called to deal, and no one can\r\nignore the insistent conditions which, during recent years, have called for\r\nthe continued and almost exclusive attention of your membership to public\r\nwork. It would suggest insincerity if I expressed complete accord with\r\nevery expression recorded in your roll calls, but we are all agreed about\r\nthe difficulties and the inevitable divergence of opinion in seeking the\r\nreduction, amelioration and readjustment of the burdens of taxation. Later\r\non, when other problems are solved, I shall make some recommendations about\r\nrenewed consideration of our tax program, but for the immediate time before\r\nus we must be content with the billion dollar reduction in the tax draft\r\nupon the people, and diminished irritations, banished uncertainty and\r\nimproved methods of collection. By your sustainment of the rigid economies\r\nalready inaugurated, with hoped-for extension of these economies and added\r\nefficiencies in administration, I believe further reductions may be enacted\r\nand hindering burdens abolished.\r\n\r\nIn these urgent economies we shall be immensely assisted by the budget\r\nsystem for which you made provision in the extraordinary session. The first\r\nbudget is before you. Its preparation is a signal achievement, and the\r\nperfection of the system, a thing impossible in the few months available\r\nfor its initial trial, will mark its enactment as the beginning of the\r\ngreatest reformation in governmental practices since the beginning of the\r\nRepublic.\r\n\r\nThere is pending a grant of authority to the administrative branch of the\r\nGovernment for the funding and settlement of our vast foreign loans growing\r\nout of our grant of war credits. With the hands of the executive branch\r\nheld impotent to deal with these debts we are hindering urgent\r\nreadjustments among our debtors and accomplishing nothing for ourselves. I\r\nthink it is fair for the Congress to assume that the executive branch of\r\nthe Government would adopt no major policy in dealing with these matters\r\nwhich would conflict with the purpose of Congress in authorizing the loans,\r\ncertainly not without asking congressional approval, but there are minor\r\nproblems incident to prudent loan transactions and the safeguarding of our\r\ninterests which can not even be attempted without this authorization. It\r\nwill be helpful to ourselves and it will improve conditions among our\r\ndebtors if funding and the settlement of defaulted interest may be\r\nnegotiated.\r\n\r\nThe previous Congress, deeply concerned in behalf of our merchant marine,\r\nin 1920 enacted the existing shipping law, designed for the upbuilding of\r\nthe American merchant marine. Among other things provided to encourage our\r\nshipping on the world's seas, the Executive was directed to give notice of\r\nthe termination of all existing commercial treaties in order to admit of\r\nreduced duties on imports carried in American bottoms. During the life of\r\nthe act no Executive has complied with this order of the Congress. When the\r\npresent administration came into responsibility it began an early inquiry\r\ninto the failure to execute the expressed purpose of the Jones Act. Only\r\none conclusion has been possible. Frankly, Members of House and Senate,\r\neager its I am to join you in the making of an American merchant marine\r\ncommensurate with our commerce, the denouncement of our commercial\r\ntreaties would involve us in a chaos of trade relationships and add\r\nindescribably to the confusion of the already disordered commercial world.\r\nOur power to do so is not disputed, but power and ships, without comity of\r\nrelationship, will not give us the expanded trade which is inseparably\r\nlinked with a great merchant marine. Moreover, the applied reduction of\r\nduty, for which the treaty denouncements were necessary, encouraged only\r\nthe carrying of dutiable imports to our shores, while the tonnage which\r\nunfurls the flag on the seas is both free and dutiable, and the cargoes\r\nwhich make it nation eminent in trade are outgoing, rather than incoming.\r\n\r\nIt is not my thought to lay the problem before you in detail today. It is\r\ndesired only to say to you that the executive branch of the Government,\r\nuninfluenced by the protest of any nation, for none has been made, is well\r\nconvinced that your proposal, highly intended and heartily supported here,\r\nis so fraught with difficulties and so marked by tendencies to discourage\r\ntrade expansion, that I invite your tolerance of noncompliance for only a\r\nfew weeks until a plan may be presented which contemplates no greater draft\r\nupon the Public Treasury, and which, though yet too crude to offer it\r\nto-day, gives such promise of expanding our merchant marine, that it will\r\nargue its own approval. It is enough to say to-day that we are so possessed\r\nof ships, and the American intention to establish it merchant marine is so\r\nunalterable, that a plain of reimbursement, at no other cost than is\r\ncontemplated in the existing act, will appeal to the pride and encourage\r\nthe hope of all the American people.\r\n\r\nThere is before you the completion of the enactment of what has been termed\r\na \"permanent\" tariff law, the word \"permanent\" being used to distinguish\r\nit from the emergency act which the Congress expedited early in the\r\nextraordinary session, and which is the law today. I can not too strongly\r\nurge in early completion of this necessary legislation It is needed to\r\nstabilize our industry at home; it is essential to make more definite our\r\ntrade relations abroad. More, it is vital to the preservation of many of\r\nour own industries which contribute so notably to the very lifeblood of our\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nThere is now, and there always will be, a storm of conflicting opinion\r\nabout any tariff revision. We can not go far wrong when we base our tariffs\r\non the policy of preserving the productive activities which enhance\r\nemployment and add to our national prosperity.\r\n\r\nAgain comes the reminder that we must not be unmindful of world conditions,\r\nthat peoples are struggling for industrial rehabilitation and that we can\r\nnot dwell in industrial and commercial exclusion and at the same time do\r\nthe just thing in aiding world reconstruction and readjustment. We do not\r\nseek a selfish aloofness, and we could not profit by it, were it possible.\r\nWe recognize the necessity of buying wherever we sell, and the permanency\r\nof trade lies in its acceptable exchanges. In our pursuit of markets we\r\nmust give as well as receive. We can not sell to others who do not produce,\r\nnor can we buy unless we produce at home. Sensible of every obligation of\r\nhumanity, commerce and finance, linked as they are in the present world\r\ncondition, it is not to be argued that we need destroy ourselves to be\r\nhelpful to others. With all my heart I wish restoration to the peoples\r\nblighted by the awful World War, but the process of restoration does not\r\nlie in our acceptance of like conditions. It were better to, remain on firm\r\nground, strive for ample employment and high standards of wage at home, and\r\npoint the way to balanced budgets, rigid economies, and resolute, efficient\r\nwork as the necessary remedies to cure disaster.\r\n\r\nEverything relating to trade, among ourselves and among nations, has been\r\nexpanded, excessive, inflated, abnormal, and there is a madness in finance\r\nwhich no American policy alone will cure. We are a creditor Nation, not by\r\nnormal processes, but made so by war. It is not an unworthy selfishness to\r\nseek to save ourselves, when the processes of that salvation are not only\r\nnot denied to others, but commended to them. We seek to undermine for\r\nothers no industry by which they subsist; we are obligated to permit the\r\nundermining of none of our own which make for employment and maintained\r\nactivities.\r\n\r\nEvery contemplation, it little matters in which direction one turns,\r\nmagnifies the difficulty of tariff legislation, but the necessity of the\r\nrevision is magnified with it. Doubtless we are justified in seeking it.\r\nMore flexible policy than we have provided heretofore. I hope a way will be\r\nfound to make for flexibility and elasticity, so that rates may be adjusted\r\nto meet unusual and changing conditions which can not be accurately\r\nanticipated. There are problems incident to unfair practices, and to\r\nexchanges which madness in money have made almost unsolvable. I know of no\r\nmanner in which to effect this flexibility other than the extension of the\r\npowers of the Tariff Commission so that it can adapt itself to it\r\nscientific and wholly just administration of the law.\r\n\r\nI am not unmindful of the constitutional difficulties. These can be met by\r\ngiving authority to the Chief Executive, who could proclaim-additional\r\nduties to meet conditions which the Congress may designate.\r\n\r\nAt this point I must disavow any desire to enlarge the Executive's powers\r\nor add to the responsibilities of the office. They are already too large.\r\nIf there were any other plan I would prefer it.\r\n\r\nThe grant of authority to proclaim would necessarily bring the Tariff\r\nCommission into new and enlarged activities, because no Executive could\r\ndischarge such a duty except upon the information acquired and\r\nrecommendations made by this commission. But the plan is feasible, and the\r\nproper functioning of the board would give its it better administration of\r\na defined policy than ever can be made possible by tariff duties prescribed\r\nwithout flexibility.\r\n\r\nThere is a manifest difference of opinion about the merits of American\r\nvaluation. Many nations have adopted delivery valuation as the basis for\r\ncollecting duties; that is, they take the cost of the imports delivered at\r\nthe port of entry as the basis for levying duty. It is no radical\r\ndeparture, in view of varying conditions and the disordered state of money\r\nvalues, to provide for American valuation, but there can not be ignored the\r\ndanger of such a valuation, brought to the level of our own production\r\ncosts, making our tariffs prohibitive. It might do so in many instances\r\nwhere imports ought to be encouraged. I believe Congress ought well\r\nconsider the desirability of the only promising alternative, namely, a\r\nprovision authorizing proclaimed American valuation, under prescribed\r\nconditions, on any given list of articles imported.\r\n\r\nIn this proposed flexibility, authorizing increases to meet conditions so\r\nlikely to change, there should also be provision for decreases. A rate may\r\nbe just to-day, and entirely out of proportion six months from to-day. If\r\nour tariffs are to be made equitable, and not necessarily burden our\r\nimports and hinder our trade abroad, frequent adjustment will be necessary\r\nfor years to come. Knowing the impossibility of modification by act of\r\nCongress for any one or a score of lines without involving a long array of\r\nschedules, I think we shall go a long ways toward stabilization, if there\r\nis recognition of the Tariff Commission's fitness to recommend urgent\r\nchanges by proclamation.\r\n\r\nI am sure about public opinion favoring the early determination of our\r\ntariff policy. There have been reassuring signs of a business revival from\r\nthe deep slump which all the world has been experiencing. Our unemployment,\r\nwhich gave its deep concern only a few weeks ago, has grown encouragingly\r\nless, and new assurances and renewed confidence will attend the\r\ncongressional declaration that American industry will be held secure.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said about the protective policy for ourselves making it\r\nimpossible for our debtors to discharge their obligations to us. This is a\r\ncontention not now pressing for decision. If we must choose between a\r\npeople in idleness pressing for the payment of indebtedness, or a people\r\nresuming the normal ways of employment and carrying the credit, let us\r\nchoose the latter. Sometimes we appraise largest the human ill most vivid\r\nin our minds. We have been giving, and are giving now, of our influence and\r\nappeals to minimize the likelihood of war and throw off the crushing\r\nburdens of armament. It is all very earnest, with a national soul\r\nimpelling. But a people unemployed, and gaunt with hunger, face a situation\r\nquite as disheartening as war, and our greater obligation to-day is to do\r\nthe Government's part toward resuming productivity and promoting fortunate\r\nand remunerative employment.\r\n\r\nSomething more than tariff protection is required by American agriculture.\r\nTo the farmer has come the earlier and the heavier burdens of readjustment.\r\nThere is actual depression in our agricultural industry, while agricultural\r\nprosperity is absolutely essential to the general prosperity of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nCongress has sought very earnestly to provide relief. It has promptly given\r\nsuch temporary relief as has been possible, but the call is insistent for\r\nthe permanent solution. It is inevitable that large crops lower the prices\r\nand short crops advance them. No legislation can cure that fundamental law.\r\nBut there must be some economic solution for the excessive variation in\r\nreturns for agricultural production.\r\n\r\nIt is rather shocking to be told, and to have the statement strongly\r\nsupported, that 9,000,000 bales of cotton, raised on American plantations\r\nin a given year, will actually be worth more to the producers than\r\n13,000,000 bales would have been. Equally shocking is the statement that\r\n700,000,000 bushels of wheat, raised by American farmers, would bring them\r\nmore money than a billion bushels. Yet these are not exaggerated\r\nstatements. In a world where there are tens of millions who need food and\r\nclothing which they can not get, such a condition is sure to indict the\r\nsocial system which makes it possible.\r\n\r\nIn the main the remedy lies in distribution and marketing. Every proper\r\nencouragement should be given to the cooperative marketing programs. These\r\nhave proven very helpful to the cooperating communities in Europe. In\r\nRussia the cooperative community has become the recognized bulwark of law\r\nand order, and saved individualism from engulfment in social paralysis.\r\nUltimately they will be accredited with the salvation of the Russian\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThere is the appeal for this experiment. Why not try it? No one challenges\r\nthe right of the farmer to a larger share of the consumer's pay for his\r\nproduct, no one disputes that we can not live without the farmer. He is\r\njustified in rebelling against the transportation cost. Given a fair\r\nreturn for his labor, he will have less occasion to appeal for financial\r\naid; and given assurance that his labors shall not be in vain, we reassure\r\nall the people of a production sufficient to meet our National requirement\r\nand guard against disaster.\r\n\r\nThe base of the pyramid of civilization which rests upon the soil is\r\nshrinking through the drift of population from farm to city. For a\r\ngeneration we have been expressing more or less concern about this\r\ntendency. Economists have warned and statesmen have deplored. We thought\r\nfor at time that modern conveniences and the more intimate contact would\r\nhalt the movement, but it has gone steadily on. Perhaps only grim necessity\r\nwill correct it, but we ought to find a less drastic remedy.\r\n\r\nThe existing scheme of adjusting freight rates hits been favoring the\r\nbasing points, until industries are attracted to some centers and repelled\r\nfrom others. A great volume of uneconomic and wasteful transportation has\r\nattended, and the cost increased accordingly. The grain-milling and\r\nmeat-packing industries afford ample illustration, and the attending\r\nconcentration is readily apparent. The menaces in concentration are not\r\nlimited to the retardingly influences on agriculture. Manifestly the.\r\nconditions and terms of railway transportation ought not be permitted to\r\nincrease this undesirable tendency. We have a just pride in our great\r\ncities, but we shall find a greater pride in the Nation, which has it\r\nlarger distribution of its population into the country, where comparatively\r\nself-sufficient smaller communities may blend agricultural and\r\nmanufacturing interests in harmonious helpfulness and enhanced good\r\nfortune. Such a movement contemplates no destruction of things wrought, of\r\ninvestments made, or wealth involved. It only looks to a general policy of\r\ntransportation of distributed industry, and of highway construction, to\r\nencourage the spread of our population and restore the proper balance\r\nbetween city and country. The problem may well have your earnest\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt has been perhaps the proudest claim of our American civilization that in\r\ndealing with human relationships it has constantly moved toward such\r\njustice in distributing the product of human energy that it has improved\r\ncontinuously the economic status of the mass of people. Ours has been a\r\nhighly productive social organization. On the way up from the elemental\r\nstages of society we have eliminated slavery and serfdom and are now far on\r\nthe way to the elimination of poverty.\r\n\r\nThrough the eradication of illiteracy and the diffusion of education\r\nmankind has reached a stage where we may fairly say that in the United\r\nStates equality of opportunity has been attained, though all are not\r\nprepared to embrace it. There is, indeed, a too great divergence between\r\nthe economic conditions of the most and the least favored classes in the\r\ncommunity. But even that divergence has now come to the point where we\r\nbracket the very poor and the very rich together as the least fortunate\r\nclasses. Our efforts may well be directed to improving the status of both.\r\n\r\nWhile this set of problems is commonly comprehended under the general\r\nphrase \"Capital and labor,\" it is really vastly broader. It is a question\r\nof social and economic organization. Labor has become a large contributor,\r\nthrough its savings, to the stock of capital; while the people who own the\r\nlargest individual aggregates of capital are themselves often hard and\r\nearnest laborers. Very often it is extremely difficult to draw the line of\r\ndemarcation between the two groups; to determine whether a particular\r\nindividual is entitled to be set down as laborer or as capitalist. In a\r\nvery large proportion of cases he is both, and when he is both he is the\r\nmost useful citizen.\r\n\r\nThe right of labor to organize is just as fundamental and necessary as is\r\nthe right of capital to organize. The right of labor to negotiate, to deal\r\nwith and solve its particular problems in an organized way, through its\r\nchosen agents, is just as essential as is the right of capital to organize,\r\nto maintain corporations, to limit the liabilities of stockholders. Indeed,\r\nwe have come to recognize that the limited liability of the citizen as a\r\nmember of a labor organization closely parallels the limitation of\r\nliability of the citizen as a stockholder in a corporation for profit.\r\nAlong this line of reasoning we shall make the greatest progress toward\r\nsolution of our problem of capital and labor.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the corporation which enjoys the privilege of limited\r\nliability of stockholders, particularly when engaged in in the public\r\nservice, it is recognized that the outside public has a large concern\r\nwhich must be protected; and so we provide regulations, restrictions, and\r\nin some cases detailed supervision. Likewise in the case of labor\r\norganizations, we might well apply similar and equally well-defined\r\nprinciples of regulation and supervision in order to conserve the public's\r\ninterests as affected by their operations.\r\n\r\nJust as it is not desirable that a corporation shall be allowed to impose\r\nundue exactions upon the public, so it is not desirable that a labor\r\norganization shall be permitted to exact unfair terms of employment or\r\nsubject the public to actual distresses in order to enforce its terms.\r\nFinally, just as we are earnestly seeking for procedures whereby to adjust\r\nand settle political differences between nations without resort to war, so\r\nwe may well look about for means to settle the differences between\r\norganized capital and organized labor without resort to those forms of\r\nwarfare which we recognize under the name of strikes, lockouts, boycotts,\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\nAs we have great bodies of law carefully regulating the organization and\r\noperations of industrial and financial corporations, as we have treaties\r\nand compacts among nations which look to the settlement of differences\r\nwithout the necessity of conflict in arms, so we might well have plans of\r\nconference, of common counsel, of mediation, arbitration, and judicial\r\ndetermination in controversies between labor and capital. To accomplish\r\nthis would involve the necessity to develop a thoroughgoing code of\r\npractice in dealing with such affairs It might be well to frankly set forth\r\nthe superior interest of the community as a whole to either the labor group\r\nor the capital group. With rights, privileges, immunities, and modes of\r\norganization thus carefully defined, it should be possible to set up\r\njudicial or quasi judicial tribunals for the consideration and\r\ndetermination of all disputes which menace the public welfare.\r\n\r\nIn an industrial society such as ours the strike, the lockout, and the\r\nboycott are as much out of place and as disastrous in their results as is\r\nwar or armed revolution in the domain of politics. The same disposition to\r\nreasonableness, to conciliation, to recognition of the other side's point\r\nof view, the same provision of fair and recognized tribunals and processes,\r\nought to make it possible to solve the one set of questions its easily as\r\nthe other. I believe the solution is possible.\r\n\r\nThe consideration of such a policy would necessitate the exercise of care\r\nand deliberation in the construction of a code and a charter of elemental\r\nrights, dealing with the relations of employer and employee. This\r\nfoundation in the law, dealing with the modern conditions of social and\r\neconomic life, would hasten the building of the temple of peace in industry\r\nwhich a rejoicing nation would acclaim.\r\n\r\nAfter each war, until the last, the Government has been enabled to give\r\nhomes to its returned soldiers, and a large part of our settlement and\r\ndevelopment has attended this generous provision of land for the Nation's\r\ndefenders.\r\n\r\nThere is yet unreserved approximately 200,000,000 acres in the public\r\ndomain, 20,000,000 acres of which are known to be susceptible of\r\nreclamation and made fit for homes by provision for irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe Government has been assisting in the development of its remaining\r\nlands, until the estimated increase in land values in the irrigated\r\nsections is full $500,000,000 and the crops of 1920 alone on these lands\r\nare estimated to exceed $100,000,000. Under the law authorization these\r\nexpenditures for development the advances are to be returned and it would\r\nbe good business for the Government to provide for the reclamation of the\r\nremaining 20,000,000 acres, in addition to expediting the completion of\r\nprojects long under way.\r\n\r\nUnder what is known as the coal and gas lease law, applicable also to\r\ndeposits of phosphates and other minerals on the public domain, leases are\r\nnow being made on the royalty basis, and are producing large revenues to\r\nthe Government. Under this legislation, 10 per centum of all royalties is\r\nto be paid directly to the Federal Treasury, and of the remainder 50 per\r\ncentum is to be used for reclamation of arid lands by irrigation, and 40\r\nper centum is to be paid to the States, in which the operations are\r\nlocated, to be used by them for school and road purposes.\r\n\r\nThese resources are so vast, and the development is affording so reliable a\r\nbasis of estimate, that the Interior Department expresses the belief that\r\nultimately the present law will add in royalties and payments to the\r\ntreasuries of the Federal Government and the States containing these public\r\nlands a total of $12,000,000,000. This means, of course, an added wealth of\r\nmany times that sum. These prospects seem to afford every justification of\r\nGovernment advances in reclamation and irrigation.\r\n\r\nContemplating the inevitable and desirable increase of population, there is\r\nanother phase of reclamation full worthy of consideration. There are\r\n79,000,000 acres of swamp and cut-over lands which may be reclaimed and\r\nmade as valuable as any farm lands we possess. These acres are largely\r\nlocated in Southern States, and the greater proportion is owned by the\r\nStates or by private citizens. Congress has a report of the survey of this\r\nfield for reclamation, and the feasibility is established. I gladly commend\r\nFederal aid, by way of advances, where State and private participation is\r\nassured.\r\n\r\nHome making is one of the greater benefits which government can bestow.\r\nMeasures are pending embodying this sound policy to which we may well\r\nadhere. It is easily possible to make available permanent homes which will\r\nprovide, in turn, for prosperous American families, without injurious\r\ncompetition with established activities, or imposition on wealth already\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nWhile we are thinking of promoting the fortunes of our own people I am sure\r\nthere is room in the sympathetic thought of America for fellow human beings\r\nwho are suffering and dying of starvation in Russia. A severe drought in\r\nthe Valley of the Volga has plunged 15,000,000 people into grievous famine.\r\nOur voluntary agencies are exerting themselves to the utmost to save the\r\nlives of children in this area, but it is now evident that unless relief is\r\nafforded the loss of life will extend into many millions. America can not\r\nbe deaf to such a call as that.\r\n\r\nWe do not recognize the government of Russia, nor tolerate the propaganda\r\nwhich emanates therefrom, but we do not forget the traditions of Russian\r\nfriendship. We may put aside our consideration of all international\r\npolitics and fundamental differences in government. The big thing is the\r\ncall of the suffering and the dying. Unreservedly I recommend the\r\nappropriation necessary to supply the American Relief Administration with\r\n10,000,000 bushels of corn and 1,000,000 bushels of seed grains, not alone\r\nto halt the wave of death through starvation, but to enable spring planting\r\nin areas where the seed grains have been exhausted temporarily to stem\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nThe American Relief Administration is directed in Russia by former officers\r\nof our own armies, and has fully demonstrated its ability to transport and\r\ndistribute relief through American hands without hindrance or loss. The\r\ntime has come to add the Government's support to the wonderful relief\r\nalready wrought out of the generosity of the American private purse.\r\n\r\nI am not unaware that we have suffering and privation at home. When it\r\nexceeds the capacity for the relief within the States concerned, it will\r\nhave Federal consideration. It seems to me we should be indifferent to our\r\nown heart promptings, and out of accord with the spirit which acclaims the\r\nChristmastide, if we do not give out of our national abundance to lighten\r\nthis burden of woe upon a people blameless and helpless in famine's peril.\r\n\r\nThere are it full score of topics concerning which it would be becoming to\r\naddress you, and on which I hope to make report at a later time. I have\r\nalluded to the things requiring your earlier attention. However, I can not\r\nend this limited address without a suggested amendment to the organic law.\r\n\r\nMany of us belong to that school of thought which is hesitant about\r\naltering the fundamental law. I think our tax problems, the tendency of\r\nwealth to seek nontaxable investment, and the menacing increase of public\r\ndebt, Federal, State and municipal-all justify a proposal to change the\r\nConstitution so as to end the issue of nontaxable bonds. No action can\r\nchange the status of the many billions outstanding, but we can guard\r\nagainst future encouragement of capital's paralysis, while a halt in the\r\ngrowth of public indebtedness would be beneficial throughout our whole\r\nland.\r\n\r\nSuch a change in the Constitution must be very thoroughly considered before\r\nsubmission. There ought to be known what influence it will have on the\r\ninevitable refunding of our vast national debt, how it will operate on the\r\nnecessary refunding of State and municipal debt, how the advantages of\r\nNation over State and municipality, or the contrary, may be avoided.\r\nClearly the States would not ratify to their own apparent disadvantage. I\r\nsuggest the consideration because the drift of wealth into nontaxable\r\nsecurities is hindering the flow of large capital to our industries,\r\nmanufacturing, agricultural, and carrying, until we are discouraging the\r\nvery activities which make our wealth.\r\n\r\nAgreeable to your expressed desire and in complete accord with the purposes\r\nof the executive branch of the Government, there is in Washington, as you\r\nhappily know, an International Conference now most earnestly at work on\r\nplans for the limitation of armament, a naval holiday, and the just\r\nsettlement of problems which might develop into causes of international\r\ndisagreement.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to believe a world-hope is centered on this Capital City. A most\r\ngratifying world-accomplishment is not improbable.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nWarren Harding\r\nDecember 8, 1922\r\n\r\nMEMBERS OF THE CONGRESS:\r\n\r\nSo many problems are calling for solution that a recital of all of them, in\r\nthe face of the known limitations of a short session of Congress, would\r\nseem to lack sincerity of purpose. It is four years since the World War\r\nended, but the inevitable readjustment of the social and economic order is\r\nnot more than barely begun. There is no acceptance of pre-war conditions\r\nanywhere in the world. In a very general way humanity harbors individual\r\nwishes to go on with war-time compensation for production, with pre-war\r\nrequirements in expenditure. In short, everyone, speaking broadly, craves\r\nreadjustment for everybody except himself, while there can be no just and\r\npermanent readjustment except when all participate.\r\n\r\nThe civilization which measured its strength of genius and the power of\r\nscience and the resources of industries, in addition to testing the limits\r\nof man power and the endurance and heroism of men and women--that same\r\ncivilization is brought to its severest test in restoring a tranquil order\r\nand committing humanity to the stable ways of peace.\r\n\r\nIf the sober and deliberate appraisal of pre-war civilization makes it seem\r\na worth-while inheritance, then with patience and good courage it will be\r\npreserved. There never again will be precisely the old order; indeed, I\r\nknow of no one who thinks it to be desirable For out of the old order came\r\nthe war itself, and the new order, established and made secure, never will\r\npermit its recurrence.\r\n\r\nIt is no figure of speech to say we have come to the test of Our\r\ncivilization. The world has been passing--is today passing through of a\r\ngreat crisis. The conduct of war itself is not more difficult than the\r\nsolution of the problems which necessarily follow. I am not speaking at\r\nthis moment of the problem in its wider aspect of world rehabilitation or\r\nof international relationships. The reference is to our own social,\r\nfinancial, and economic problems at home. These things are not to be\r\nconsidered solely as problems apart from all international relationship,\r\nbut every nation must be able to carry on for itself, else its\r\ninternational relationship will have scant importance.\r\n\r\nDoubtless our own people have emerged from the World War tumult less\r\nimpaired than most belligerent powers; probably we have made larger\r\nprogress toward reconstruction. Surely we have been fortunate in\r\ndiminishing unemployment, and our industrial and business activities, which\r\nare the lifeblood of our material existence, have been restored as in no\r\nother reconstruction period of like length in the history of the world. Had\r\nwe escaped the coal and railway strikes, which had no excuse for their\r\nbeginning and less justification for their delayed settlement, we should\r\nhave done infinitely better. But labor was insistent on holding to the war\r\nheights, and heedless forces of reaction sought the pre-war levels, and\r\nboth were wrong. In the folly of conflict our progress was hindered, and\r\nthe heavy cost has not yet been fully estimated. There can be neither\r\nadjustment nor the penalty of the failure to readjust in which all do not\r\nsomehow participate.\r\n\r\nThe railway strike accentuated the difficulty of the American farmer. The\r\nfirst distress of readjustment came to the farmer, and it will not be a\r\nreadjustment fit to abide until he is relieved. The distress brought to the\r\nfarmer does not affect him alone. Agricultural ill fortune is a national\r\nill fortune. That one-fourth of our population which produces the food of\r\nthe Republic and adds so largely to our export commerce must participate in\r\nthe good fortunes of the Nation, else there is none worth retaining.\r\n\r\nAgriculture is a vital activity in our national life. In it we had our\r\nbeginning, and its westward march with the star of the empire has reflected\r\nthe growth of the Republic. It has its vicissitudes which no legislation\r\nwill prevent, its hardships for which no law can provide escape. But the\r\nCongress can make available to the farmer the financial facilities which\r\nhave been built up under Government aid and supervision for other\r\ncommercial and industrial enterprises. It may be done on the same solid\r\nfundamentals and make the vitally important agricultural industry more\r\nsecure, and it must be done.\r\n\r\nThis Congress already has taken cognizance of the misfortune which\r\nprecipitate deflation brought to American agriculture. Your measures of\r\nrelief and the reduction of the Federal reserve discount rate undoubtedly\r\nsaved the country from widespread disaster. The very proof of helpfulness\r\nalready given is the strongest argument for the permanent establishment of\r\nwidened credits, heretofore temporarily extended through the War Finance\r\nCorporation.\r\n\r\nThe Farm Loan Bureau, which already has proven its usefulness through the\r\nFederal land banks, may well have its powers enlarged to provide ample farm\r\nproduction credits as well as enlarged land credits. It is entirely\r\npractical to create a division in the Federal land banks to deal with\r\nproduction credits, with the limitations of time so adjusted to the farm\r\nturnover as the Federal reserve system provides for the turnover in the\r\nmanufacturing and mercantile world. Special provision must be made for\r\nlive-stock production credits, and the limit of land loans may be safely\r\nenlarged. Various measures are pending before you, and the best judgment of\r\nCongress ought to be expressed in a prompt enactment at the present\r\nsession.\r\n\r\nBut American agriculture needs more than added credit facilities. The\r\ncredits will help to solve the pressing problems growing out of\r\nwar-inflated land values and the drastic deflation of three years ago, but\r\npermanent and deserved agricultural good fortune depends on better and\r\ncheaper transportation.\r\n\r\nHere is an outstanding problem, demanding the most rigorous consideration\r\nof the Congress and the country. It has to do with more than agriculture.\r\nIt provides the channel for the flow of the country's commerce. But the\r\nfarmer is particularly hard hit. His market, so affected by the world\r\nconsumption, does not admit of the price adjustment to meet carrying\r\ncharges. In the last half of the year now closing the railways, broken in\r\ncarrying capacity because of motive power and rolling stock out of order,\r\nthough insistently declaring to the contrary, embargoed his shipments or\r\ndenied him cars when fortunate markets were calling. Too frequently\r\ntransportation failed while perishable products were turning from possible\r\nprofit to losses counted in tens of millions.\r\n\r\nI know of no problem exceeding in importance this one of transportation. In\r\nour complex and interdependent modern life transportation is essential to\r\nour very existence. Let us pass for the moment the menace in the possible\r\nparalysis of such service as we have and note the failure, for whatever\r\nreason, to expand our transportation to meet the Nation's needs.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1880 recorded a population of 50,000,000. In two decades more\r\nwe may reasonably expect to count thrice that number. In the three decades\r\nending in 1920 the country's freight by rail increased from 631,000,000\r\ntons to 2,234,000,000 tons; that is to say, while our population was\r\nincreasing, less than 70 per cent, the freight movement increased over 250\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nWe have built 40 per cent of the world's railroad mileage, and yet find it\r\ninadequate to our present requirements. When we contemplate the inadequacy\r\nof to-day it is easy to believe that the next few decades will witness the\r\nparalysis of our transportation-using social scheme or a complete\r\nreorganization on some new basis. Mindful of the tremendous costs of\r\nbetterments, extensions, and expansions, and mindful of the staggering\r\ndebts of the world to-day, the difficulty is magnified. Here is a problem\r\ndemanding wide vision and the avoidance of mere makeshifts. No matter what\r\nthe errors of the past, no matter how we acclaimed construction and then\r\ncondemned operations in the past, we have the transportation and the honest\r\ninvestment in the transportation which sped us on to what we are, and we\r\nface conditions which reflect its inadequacy to-day, its greater inadequacy\r\nto-morrow, and we contemplate transportation costs which much of the\r\ntraffic can not and will not continue to pay.\r\n\r\nManifestly, we have need to begin on plans to coordinate all transportation\r\nfacilities. We should more effectively connect up our rail lines with our\r\ncarriers by sea. We ought to reap some benefit from the hundreds of\r\nmillions expended on inland waterways, proving our capacity to utilize as\r\nwell as expend. We ought to turn the motor truck into a railway feeder and\r\ndistributor instead of a destroying competitor.\r\n\r\nIt would be folly to ignore that we live in a motor age. The motor car\r\nreflects our standard of living and gauges the speed of our present-day\r\nlife. It long ago ran down Simple Living, and never halted to inquire about\r\nthe prostrate figure which fell as its victim. With full recognition of\r\nmotor-car transportation we must turn it to the most practical use. It can\r\nnot supersede the railway lines, no matter how generously we afford it\r\nhighways out of the Public Treasury. If freight traffic by motor were\r\ncharged with its proper and proportionate share of highway construction, we\r\nshould find much of it wasteful and more costly than like service by rail.\r\nYet we have paralleled the railways, a most natural line of construction,\r\nand thereby taken away from the agency of expected service much of its\r\nprofitable traffic, which the taxpayers have been providing the highways,\r\nwhose cost of maintenance is not yet realized.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Government has a right to inquire into the wisdom of this\r\npolicy, because the National Treasury is contributing largely to this\r\nhighway construction. Costly highways ought to be made to serve as feeders\r\nrather than competitors of the railroads, and the motor truck should become\r\na coordinate factor in our great distributing system.\r\n\r\nThis transportation problem can not be waived aside. The demand for lowered\r\ncosts on farm products and basic materials can not be ignored. Rates\r\nhorizontally increased, to meet increased wage outlays during the war\r\ninflation, are not easily reduced. When some very moderate wage reductions\r\nwere effected last summer there was a 5 per cent horizontal reduction in\r\nrates. I sought at that time, in a very informal way, to have the railway\r\nmanagers go before the Interstate Commerce Commission and agree to a\r\nheavier reduction on farm products and coal and other basic commodities,\r\nand leave unchanged the freight tariffs which a very large portion of the\r\ntraffic was able to bear. Neither the managers nor the commission tile@@\r\nsuggestion, so we had the horizontal reduction saw fit to adopt too slight\r\nto be felt by the higher class cargoes and too little to benefit the heavy\r\ntonnage calling most loudly for relief.\r\n\r\nRailways are not to be expected to render the most essential service in our\r\nsocial organization without a air return on capital invested, but the\r\nGovernment has gone so far in the regulation of rates and rules of\r\noperation that it has the responsibility of pointing the way to the reduced\r\nfreight costs so essential to our national welfare.\r\n\r\nGovernment operation does not afford the cure. It was Government operation\r\nwhich brought us to the very order of things against which we now rebel,\r\nand we are still liquidating the costs of that supreme folly.\r\n\r\nSurely the genius of the railway builders has not become extinct among the\r\nrailway managers. New economies, new efficiencies in cooperation must be\r\nfound. The fact that labor takes 50 to 60 per cent of total railway\r\nearnings makes limitations within which to effect economies very difficult,\r\nbut the demand is no less insistent on that account.\r\n\r\nClearly the managers are without that intercarrier, cooperative\r\nrelationship so highly essential to the best and most economical operation.\r\nThey could not function in harmony when the strike threatened the paralysis\r\nof all railway transportation. The relationship of the service to public\r\nwelfare, so intimately affected by State and Federal regulation, demands\r\nthe effective correlation and a concerted drive to meet an insistent and\r\njustified public demand.\r\n\r\nThe merger of lines into systems, a facilitated interchange of freight\r\ncars, the economic use of terminals, and the consolidation of facilities\r\nare suggested ways of economy and efficiency.\r\n\r\nI remind you that Congress provided a Joint Commission of Agricultural\r\nInquiry which made an exhaustive investigation of car service and\r\ntransportation, and unanimously recommended in its report of October 15,\r\n1921, the pooling of freight cars under a central agency. This report well\r\ndeserves your serious consideration. I think well of the central agency,\r\nwhich shall be a creation of the railways themselves, to provide, under the\r\njurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, the means for financing\r\nequipment for carriers which are otherwise unable to provide their\r\nproportion of car equipment adequate to transportation needs. This same\r\nagency ought to point the way to every possible economy in maintained\r\nequipment and the necessary interchanges in railway commerce.\r\n\r\nIn a previous address to the Congress I called to your attention the\r\ninsufficiency of power to enforce the decisions of the Railroad Labor\r\nBoard. Carriers have ignored its decisions, on the one hand, railway\r\nworkmen have challenged its decisions by a strike, on the other hand.\r\n\r\nThe intent of Congress to establish a tribunal to which railway labor and\r\nmanagers may appeal respecting questions of wages and working conditions\r\ncan not be too strongly commended. It is vitally important that some such\r\nagency should be a guaranty against suspended operation. The public must be\r\nspared even the threat of discontinued service.\r\n\r\nSponsoring the railroads as we do, it is an obligation that labor shall be\r\nassured the highest justice and every proper consideration of wage and\r\nworking conditions, but it is an equal obligation to see that no concerted\r\naction in forcing demands shall deprive the public of the transportation\r\nservice essential to its very existence. It is now impossible to safeguard\r\npublic interest, because the decrees of the board are unenforceable against\r\neither employer or employee.\r\n\r\nThe Labor Board itself is not so constituted as best to serve the public\r\ninterest. With six partisan members on a board of nine, three partisans\r\nnominated by the employees and three by the railway managers, it is\r\ninevitable that the partisan viewpoint is maintained throughout hearings\r\nand in decisions handed down. Indeed, the few exceptions to a strictly\r\npartisan expression in decisions thus far rendered have been followed by\r\naccusations of betrayal of the partisan interests represented. Only the\r\npublic group of three is free to function in unbiased decisions. Therefore\r\nthe partisan membership may well be abolished, and decisions should be made\r\nby an impartial tribunal.\r\n\r\nI am well convinced that the functions of this tribunal could be much\r\nbetter carried on here in Washington. Even were it to be continued as a\r\nseparate tribunal, there ought to be contact with the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, which has supreme authority in the rate making to which wage\r\ncost bears an indissoluble relationship Theoretically, a fair and living\r\nwage must be determined quite apart from the employer's earning capacity,\r\nbut in practice, in the railway service, they are inseparable. The record\r\nof advanced rates to meet increased wages, both determined by the\r\nGovernment, is proof enough.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of a labor division in the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nmade up from its membership, to hear and decide disputes relating to wages\r\nand working conditions which have failed of adjustment by proper committees\r\ncreated by the railways and their employees, offers a more effective plan.\r\n\r\nIt need not be surprising that there is dissatisfaction over delayed\r\nhearings and decisions by the present board when every trivial dispute is\r\ncarried to that tribunal. The law should require the railroads and their\r\nemployees to institute means and methods to negotiate between themselves\r\ntheir constantly arising differences, limiting appeals to the Government\r\ntribunal to disputes of such character as are likely to affect the public\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nThis suggested substitution will involve a necessary increase in the\r\nmembership of the commission, probably four, to constitute the labor\r\ndivision. If the suggestion appeals to the Congress, it will be well to\r\nspecify that the labor division shall be constituted of representatives of\r\nthe four rate-making territories, thereby assuring a tribunal conversant\r\nwith the conditions which obtain in the different ratemaking sections of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nI wish I could bring to you the precise recommendation for the prevention\r\nof strikes which threaten the welfare of the people and menace public\r\nsafety. It is an impotent civilization and an inadequate government which\r\nlacks the genius and the courage to guard against such a menace to public\r\nwelfare as we experienced last summer. You were aware of the Government's\r\ngreat concern and its futile attempt to aid in an adjustment. It will\r\nreveal the inexcusable obstinacy which was responsible for so much distress\r\nto the country to recall now that, though all disputes are not yet\r\nadjusted, the many settlements which have been made were on the terms which\r\nthe Government proposed in mediation.\r\n\r\nPublic interest demands that ample power shall be conferred upon the. labor\r\ntribunal, whether it is the present board or the suggested substitute, to\r\nrequire its rulings to be accepted by both parties to a disputed question.\r\n\r\nLet there be no confusion about the purpose of the suggested conferment of\r\npower to make decisions effective. There can be no denial of constitutional\r\nrights of either railway workmen or railway managers. No man can be denied\r\nhis right to labor when and how he chooses, or cease to labor when he so\r\nelects, but, since the Government assumes to safeguard his interests while\r\nemployed in an essential public service, the security of society itself\r\ndemands his retirement from the service shall not be so timed and related\r\nas to effect the destruction of that service. This vitally essential public\r\ntransportation service, demanding so much of brain and brawn, so much for\r\nefficiency and security, ought to offer the most attractive working\r\nconditions and the highest of wages paid to workmen in any employment.\r\n\r\nIn essentially every branch, from track repairer to the man at the\r\nlocomotive throttle, the railroad worker is responsible for the safety of\r\nhuman lives and the care of vast property. His high responsibility might\r\nwell rate high his pay within the limits the traffic will bear; but the\r\nsame responsibility, plus governmental protection, may justly deny him and\r\nhis associates a withdrawal from service without a warning or under\r\ncircumstances which involve the paralysis of necessary transportation. We\r\nhave assumed so great a responsibility in necessary regulation that we\r\nunconsciously have assumed the responsibility for maintained service;\r\ntherefore the lawful power for the enforcement of decisions is necessary\r\nto sustain the majesty of government and to administer to the public\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\nDuring its longer session the present Congress enacted a new tariff law.\r\nThe protection of the American standards of living demanded the insurance\r\nit provides against the distorted conditions of world commerce The framers\r\nof the law made provision for a certain flexibility of customs duties,\r\nwhereby it is possible to readjust them as developing conditions may\r\nrequire. The enactment has imposed a large responsibility upon the\r\nExecutive, but that responsibility will be discharged with a broad\r\nmindfulness of the whole business situation. The provision itself admits\r\neither the possible fallibility of rates or their unsuitableness to\r\nchanging conditions. I believe the grant of authority may be promptly and\r\ndiscreetly exercised, ever mindful of the intent and purpose to safeguard\r\nAmerican industrial activity, and at the same time prevent the exploitation\r\nof the American consumer and keep open the paths of such liberal exchanges\r\nas do not endanger our own productivity.\r\n\r\nNo one contemplates commercial aloofness nor any other aloofness\r\ncontradictory to the best American traditions or loftiest human purposes.\r\nOur fortunate capacity for comparative self-containment affords the firm\r\nfoundation on which to build for our own security, and a like foundation on\r\nwhich to build for a future of influence and importance in world commerce.\r\nOur trade expansion must come of capacity and of policies of righteousness\r\nand reasonableness in till our commercial relations.\r\n\r\nLet no one assume that our provision for maintained good fortune at home,\r\nand our unwillingness to assume the correction of all the ills of the\r\nworld, means a reluctance to cooperate with other peoples or to assume\r\nevery just obligation to promote human advancement anywhere in the world.\r\n\r\nWar made its a creditor Nation. We did not seek an excess possession of the\r\nworld's gold, and we have neither desire to profit Unduly by its possession\r\nnor permanently retain it. We do not seek to become an international\r\ndictator because of its power.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the United States has a respectful hearing in international\r\ncouncils, because we have convinced the world that we have no selfish ends\r\nto serve, no old grievances to avenge, no territorial or other greed to\r\nsatisfy. But the voice being heard is that of good counsel, not of\r\ndictation. It is the voice of sympathy and fraternity and helpfulness,\r\nseeking to assist but not assume for the United States burdens which\r\nnations must bear for themselves. We would rejoice to help rehabilitate\r\ncurrency systems and facilitate all commerce which does not drag us to the\r\nvery levels of those we seek to lift up.\r\n\r\nWhile I have everlasting faith in our Republic, it would be folly, indeed,\r\nto blind ourselves to our problems at home. Abusing the hospitality of our\r\nshores are the advocates of revolution, finding their deluded followers\r\namong those who take on the habiliments of an American without knowing an\r\nAmerican soul. There is the recrudescence of hyphenated Americanism which\r\nwe thought to have been stamped out when we committed the Nation, life and\r\nsoul, to the World War.\r\n\r\nThere is a call to make the alien respect our institutions while he\r\naccepts our hospitality. There is need to magnify the American viewpoint to\r\nthe alien who seeks a citizenship among us. There is need to magnify the\r\nnational viewpoint to Americans throughout the land. More there is a demand\r\nfor every living being in the United States to respect and abide by the\r\nlaws of the Republic. Let men who are rending the moral fiber of the\r\nRepublic through easy contempt for the prohibition law, because they think\r\nit restricts their personal liberty, remember that they set the example and\r\nbreed a contempt for law which will ultimately destroy the Republic.\r\n\r\nConstitutional prohibition has been adopted by the Nation. It is the\r\nsupreme law of the land. In plain speaking, there are conditions relating\r\nto its enforcement which savor of nation-wide scandal. It is the most\r\ndemoralizing factor in our public life.\r\n\r\nMost of our people assumed that the adoption of the eighteenth amendment\r\nmeant the elimination of the question from our politics. On the contrary,\r\nit has been so intensified as an issue that many voters are disposed to\r\nmake all political decisions with reference to this single question. It is\r\ndistracting the public mind and prejudicing the judgment of the\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\nThe day is unlikely to come when the eighteenth amendment will be repealed.\r\nThe fact may as well be recognized and our course adapted accordingly. If\r\nthe statutory provisions for its enforcement are contrary to deliberate\r\npublic opinion, which I do not believe the rigorous and literal enforcement\r\nwill concentrate public attention on any requisite modification. Such a\r\ncourse, conforms with the law and saves the humiliation of the Government\r\nand the humiliation of our people before the world, and challenges the\r\ndestructive forces engaged in widespread violation, official corruption and\r\nindividual demoralization.\r\n\r\nThe eighteenth amendment involves the concurrent authority of State and\r\nFederal Governments, for the enforcement of the policy it defines. A\r\ncertain lack of definiteness, through division of responsibility is thus\r\nintroduced. In order to bring about a full understanding of duties and\r\nresponsibilities as thus distributed, I purpose to invite the governors of\r\nthe States and Territories, at an early opportunity, to a conference with\r\nthe Federal Executive authority. Out of the full and free considerations\r\nwhich will thus be possible, it is confidently believed, will emerge a more\r\nadequate, comprehension of the whole problem, and definite policies of\r\nNational and State cooperation in administering the laws.\r\n\r\nThere are pending bills for the registration of the alien who has come to\r\nour shores. I wish the passage of such an act might be expedited. Life amid\r\nAmerican opportunities is worth the cost of registration if it is worth the\r\nseeking, and the Nation has the right to know who are citizens in the\r\nmaking or who live among us anti share our advantages while seeking to\r\nundermine our cherished institutions. This provision will enable us to\r\nguard against the abuses in immigration, checking the undesirable whose\r\nirregular Willing is his first violation of our laws. More, it will\r\nfacilitate the needed Americanizing of those who mean to enroll as fellow\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nBefore enlarging the immigration quotas we had better provide registration\r\nfor aliens, those now here or continually pressing for admission, and\r\nestablish our examination boards abroad, to make sure of desirables only.\r\nBy the examination abroad we could end the pathos at our ports, when men\r\nand women find our doors closed, after long voyages and wasted savings,\r\nbecause they are unfit for admission It would be kindlier and safer to tell\r\nthem before they embark.\r\n\r\nOur program of admission and treatment of immigrants is very intimately\r\nrelated to the educational policy of the Republic With illiteracy estimated\r\nat front two-tenths of 1 per cent to less than 2 per cent in 10 of the\r\nforemost nations of Europe it rivets our attention to it serious problem\r\nwhen we are reminded of a 6 per cent illiteracy in the United States. The\r\nfigures are based on the test which defines an Illiterate as one having no\r\nschooling whatever. Remembering the wide freedom of our public schools\r\nwith compulsory attendance in many States in the Union, one is convinced\r\nthat much of our excessive illiteracy comes to us from abroad, and the\r\neducation of the immigrant becomes it requisite to his Americanization. It\r\nmust be done if he is fittingly to exercise the duties as well as enjoy the\r\nprivileges of American citizenship. Here is revealed the special field for\r\nFederal cooperation in furthering education.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning public education has been left mainly in the hands\r\nof the States. So far as schooling youth is concerned the policy has been\r\njustified, because no responsibility can be so effective as that of the\r\nlocal community alive to its task. I believe in the cooperation of the\r\nnational authority to stimulate, encourage, and broaden the work of the\r\nlocal authorities. But it is the especial obligation of the Federal\r\nGovernment to devise means and effectively assist in the education of the\r\nnewcomer from foreign lands, so that the level of American education may be\r\nmade the highest that is humanly possible.\r\n\r\nClosely related to this problem of education is the abolition of child\r\nlabor. Twice Congress has attempted the correction of the evils incident to\r\nchild employment. The decision of the Supreme Court has put this problem\r\noutside the proper domain of Federal regulation until the Constitution is\r\nso amended as to give the Congress indubitable authority. I recommend the\r\nsubmission of such an amendment.\r\n\r\nWe have two schools of thought relating to amendment of the Constitution.\r\nOne need not be committed to the belief that amendment is weakening the\r\nfundamental law, or that excessive amendment is essential to meet every\r\nephemeral whim. We ought to amend to meet the demands of the people when\r\nsanctioned by deliberate public opinion.\r\n\r\nOne year ago I suggested the submission of an amendment so that we may\r\nlawfully restrict the issues of tax-exempt securities, and I renew that\r\nrecommendation now. Tax-exempt securities are drying up the sources of\r\nFederal taxation and they are encouraging unproductive and extravagant\r\nexpenditures by States and municipalities. There is more than the menace in\r\nmounting public debt, there is the dissipation of capital which should be\r\nmade available to the needs of productive industry. The proposed amendment\r\nwill place the State and Federal Governments and all political subdivisions\r\non an exact equality, and will correct the growing menace of public\r\nborrowing, which if left unchecked may soon threaten the stability of our\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nWe are so vast and so varied in our national interests that scores of\r\nproblems are pressing for attention. I must not risk the wearying of your\r\npatience with detailed reference.\r\n\r\nReclamation and irrigation projects, where waste land may be made available\r\nfor settlement and productivity, are worthy of your favorable\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nWhen it is realized that we are consuming our timber four times as rapidly\r\nas we are growing it, we must encourage the greatest possible cooperation\r\nbetween the Federal Government, the various States, and the owners of\r\nforest lands, to the end that protection from fire shall be made more\r\neffective and replanting encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe fuel problem is under study now by a very capable fact-finding\r\ncommission, and any attempt to deal with the coal problem, of such deep\r\nconcern to the entire Nation, must await the report of the commission.\r\n\r\nThere are necessary studies of great problems which Congress might well\r\ninitiate. The wide spread between production costs and prices which\r\nconsumers pay concerns every citizen of the Republic. It contributes very\r\nlargely to the unrest in agriculture and must stand sponsor for much\r\nagainst which we inveigh in that familiar term--the high cost of living.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts the excess is traceable to the levy of the middleman, but it\r\nwould be unfair to charge him with all responsibility before we appraise\r\nwhat is exacted of him by our modernly complex life. We have attacked the\r\nproblem on one side by the promotion of cooperative marketing, and we might\r\nwell inquire into the benefits of cooperative buying. Admittedly, the\r\nconsumer is much to blame himself, because of his prodigal expenditure and\r\nhis exaction of service, but Government might well serve to point the way\r\nof narrowing the spread of price, especially between the production of food\r\nand its consumption.\r\n\r\nA superpower survey of the eastern industrial region has recently been\r\ncompleted, looking to unification of steam, water, and electric powers, and\r\nto a unified scheme of power distribution. The survey proved that vast\r\neconomies in tonnage movement of freights, and in the efficiency of the\r\nrailroads, would be effected if the superpower program were adopted. I am\r\nconvinced that constructive measures calculated to promote such an\r\nindustrial development--I am tempted to say, such an industrial\r\nrevolution-would be well worthy the careful attention and fostering\r\ninterest of the National Government.\r\n\r\nThe proposed survey of a plan to draft all the resources of the Republic,\r\nhuman and material, for national defense may well have your approval. I\r\ncommended such a program in case of future war, in the inaugural address.\r\nof March 4, 1921, and every experience in the adjustment and liquidation of\r\nwar claims and the settlement of war obligations persuades me we ought to\r\nbe prepared for such universal call to armed defense.\r\n\r\nI bring you no apprehension of war. The world is abhorrent of it, and our\r\nown relations are not only free from every threatening cloud, but we have\r\ncontributed our larger influence toward making armed conflict less likely.\r\n\r\nThose who assume that we played our part in the World War and later took\r\nourselves aloof and apart, unmindful of world obligations, give scant\r\ncredit to the helpful part we assume in international relationships.\r\n\r\nWhether all nations signatory ratify all the treaties growing out of the\r\nWashington Conference on Limitation of Armament or some withhold approval,\r\nthe underlying policy of limiting naval armament has the sanction of the\r\nlarger naval powers, and naval competition is suspended. Of course,\r\nunanimous ratification is much to be desired.\r\n\r\nThe four-power pact, which abolishes every probability of war on the\r\nPacific, has brought new confidence in a maintained peace, and I can well\r\nbelieve it might be made a model for like assurances wherever in the world\r\nany common interests are concerned.\r\n\r\nWe have had expressed the hostility of the American people to a\r\nsupergovernment or to any commitment where either a council or an assembly\r\nof leagued powers may chart our course. Treaties of armed alliance can have\r\nno likelihood of American sanction, but we believe in respecting the rights\r\nof nations, in the value of conference and consultation, in the\r\neffectiveness of leaders of nations looking each other in the face ace\r\nbefore resorting to the arbitrament of arms.\r\n\r\nIt has been our fortune both to preach and promote international\r\nunderstanding. The influence of the United States in bringing near the\r\nsettlement of an ancient dispute between South American nations is added\r\nproof of the glow of peace in ample understanding. In Washington to-day are\r\nmet the delegates of the Central American nations, gathered at the table of\r\ninternational understanding, to stabilize their Republics and remove every\r\nvestige of disagreement. They are met here by our invitation, not in our\r\naloofness, and they accept our hospitality because they have faith in our\r\nunselfishness and believe in our helpfulness. Perhaps we are selfish in\r\ncraving their confidence and friendship, but such a selfishness we proclaim\r\nto the world, regardless of hemisphere, or seas dividing.\r\n\r\nI would like the Congress and the people of the Nation to believe that in a\r\nfirm and considerate way we are insistent on American rights wherever they\r\nmay be questioned, and deny no rights of others in the assertion of our\r\nown. Moreover we are cognizant of the world's struggles for full\r\nreadjustment and rehabilitation, and we have shirked no duty which comes of\r\nsympathy, or fraternity, or highest fellowship among nations. Every\r\nobligation consonant with American ideals and sanctioned under our form of\r\ngovernment is willingly met. When we can not support we do not demand. Our\r\nconstitutional limitations do not forbid the exercise of a moral influence,\r\nthe measure of which is not less than the high purposes we have sought to\r\nserve.\r\n\r\nAfter all there is less difference about the part this great Republic shall\r\nplay in furthering peace and advancing humanity than in the manner of\r\nplaying it. We ask no one to assume responsibility for us; we assume no\r\nresponsibility which others must bear for themselves, unless nationality is\r\nhopelessly swallowed up in internationalism.",
