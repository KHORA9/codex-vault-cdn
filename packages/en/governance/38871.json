He wore shepherd’s plaid trousers\r\nand the swallow-tail coat of the day, with a figured muslin cravat\r\nwound about his wide-spread collar. He halted opposite the Privy\r\nGardens, and, with his face turned skywards, listened until the sound\r\nof the Tower guns smote again on the ear and dispelled his doubts. To\r\nthe experienced, his outward man, neat and modestly prosperous, denoted\r\na young barrister of promise or a Treasury clerk. His figure was good,\r\nhe was above the middle height, and he carried himself with an easy\r\nindependence. He seemed to be one who both held a fair opinion of\r\nhimself and knew how to impress that opinion on his fellows; yet was\r\nnot incapable of deference where deference was plainly due. He was\r\nneither ugly nor handsome, neither slovenly nor a _petit-maître_;\r\nindeed, it was doubtful if he had ever seen the inside of Almack’s. But\r\nhis features were strong and intellectual, and the keen grey eyes which\r\nlooked so boldly on the world could express both humour and good\r\nhumour. In a word, this young man was one upon whom women, even great\r\nladies, were likely to look with pleasure, and one woman—but he had not\r\nyet met her—with tenderness.\r\n\r\nBoom!\r\n\r\nHe was only one among a dozen, who within the space of a few yards had\r\nbeen brought to a stand by the sound; who knew what the salute meant,\r\nand in their various ways were moved by it. The rumour which had flown\r\nthrough the town in the morning that the King was about to dissolve his\r\nsix-months-old Parliament was true, then! so true that already in the\r\nclubs, from Boodle’s to Brooks’s, men were sending off despatches,\r\nwhile the long arms of the semaphore were carrying the news to the\r\nContinent. Persons began to run by Vaughan—the young man’s name was\r\nArthur Vaughan; and behind him the street was filling with a multitude\r\nhastening to see the sight, or so much of it as the vulgar might see.\r\nSome ran towards Westminster without disguise. Some, of a higher\r\nstation, walked as fast as dignity and their strapped trousers\r\npermitted; while others again, who thought themselves wiser than their\r\nneighbours, made quickly for Downing Street and the different openings\r\nwhich led into St. James’s Park, in the hope of catching a glimpse of\r\nthe procession before the crowd about the Houses engulfed it.\r\n\r\nNine out of ten, as they ran or walked—nay, it might be said more\r\ntruly, ninety-nine out of a hundred—evinced a joy quite out of the\r\ncommon, and such as no political event of these days produces. One\r\ncried, “Hip! Hip! Hip!”; one flung up his cap; one swore gaily.\r\nStrangers told one another that it was a good thing, bravely done! And\r\nwhile the whole of that part of the town seemed to be moving towards\r\nthe Houses, the guns boomed on, proclaiming to all the world that the\r\nunexpected had happened; that the Parliament which had passed the\r\nPeople’s Bill by one—a miserable one in the largest House which had\r\never voted—and having done that, had shelved it by some shift, some\r\nsubterfuge, was meeting the fate which it deserved.\r\n\r\nNo man, be it noted, called the measure the Reform Bill, or anything\r\nbut the Bill, or, affectionately, the People’s Bill. But they called it\r\nthat repeatedly, and in their enthusiasm, exulted in the fall of its\r\nenemies as in a personal gain. And though here and there amid the\r\ngeneral turmoil a man of mature age stood aside and scowled on the\r\ncrowd as it swept vociferating by him, such men were but as straws in a\r\nbackwater of the stream—powerless to arrest the current, and liable at\r\nany moment to be swept within its influence.\r\n\r\nThat generation had seen many a coach start laurel-clad from St.\r\nMartin’s and listened many a time to the salvoes that told of victories\r\nin France or Flanders. But it was no exaggeration to say that even\r\nWaterloo had not flung abroad more general joy, nor sown the dingy\r\nstreets with brighter faces, than this civil gain. For now—now,\r\nsurely—the People’s Bill would pass, and the people be truly\r\nrepresented in Parliament! Now, for certain, the Bill’s ill-wishers\r\nwould get a fall! And if every man—about which some doubts were\r\nwhispered even in the public-houses—did not get a vote which he could\r\nsell for a handful of gold, as his betters had sold their votes time\r\nout of mind, at least there would be beef and beer for all! Or, if not\r\nthat, something indefinite, but vastly pleasant. Few, indeed, knew\r\nprecisely what they wished and what they were going to gain, but\r\n\r\n_Hurrah for Mr. Brougham!_\r\n_Hurrah for Gaffer Grey!_\r\n_Hurrah for Lord John!_\r\n\r\n\r\nHurrah, in a word, for the Ministry, hurrah for the Whigs! And above\r\nall, three cheers for the King, who had stood by Lord Grey and\r\ndissolved this niggling, hypocritical Parliament of landowners.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the young man who has been described resumed his course; but\r\nslowly, and without betraying by any marked sign that he shared the\r\ngeneral feeling. Still, he walked with his head a little higher than\r\nbefore; he seemed to sniff the battle; and there was a light in his\r\neyes as if he saw a wider arena before him. “It is true, then,” he\r\nmuttered. “And for to-day I shall have my errand for my pains. He will\r\nhave other fish to fry, and will not see me. But what of that! Another\r\nday will do as well.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment a ragamuffin in an old jockey-cap attached himself to\r\nhim, and, running beside him, urged him to hasten.\r\n\r\n“Run, your honour,” he croaked in gin-laden accents, “and you’ll ’ave a\r\ngood place! And I’ll drink your honour’s health, and Billy the King’s!\r\nSure he’s the father of his country, and seven besides. Come on, your\r\nhonour, or they’ll be jostling you!”\r\n\r\nVaughan glanced down and shook his head. He waved the man away.\r\n\r\nBut the lout looked only to his market, and was not easily repulsed.\r\n“He’s there, I tell you,” he persisted. “And for threepence I’ll get\r\nyou to see him. Come on, your honour! It’s many a Westminster election\r\nI’ve seen, and beer running, from Mr. Fox, that was the gentleman had\r\nalways a word for the poor man, till now, when maybe it’s your honour’s\r\ngoing to stand! Anyway, it’s, Down with the mongers!”\r\n\r\nA man who was clinging to the wall at the corner of Downing Street\r\nwaved his broken hat round his head. “Ay, down with the\r\nborough-mongers!” he cried. “Down with Peel! Down with the Dook! Down\r\nwith ’em all! Down with everybody!”\r\n\r\n“And long live the Bill!” cried a man of more respectable appearance as\r\nhe hurried by. “And long live the King, God bless him!”\r\n\r\n“They’ll know what it is to balk the people now,” chimed in a fourth.\r\n“Let ’em go back and get elected if they can. Ay, let ’em!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, let ’em! Mr. Brougham’ll see to that!” shouted the other. “Hurrah\r\nfor Mr. Brougham!”\r\n\r\nThe cry was taken up by the crowd, and three cheers were given for the\r\nChancellor, who was so well known to the mob by the style under which\r\nhe had been triumphantly elected for Yorkshire that his peerage was\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nVaughan, however, heard but the echo of these cheers. Like most young\r\nmen of his time, he leant to the popular side. But he had no taste for\r\nthe populace in the mass; and the sight of the crowd, which was fast\r\noccupying the whole of the space before Palace Yard and even surging\r\nback into Parliament Street, determined him to turn aside. He shook off\r\nhis attendant and, crossing into Whitehall Place, walked up and down,\r\nimmersed in his reflections.\r\n\r\nHe was honestly ambitious, and his thoughts turned naturally on the\r\ninfluence which this Bill—which must create a new England, and for many\r\na new world—was likely to have on his own fortunes. The owner of a\r\nsmall estate in South Wales, come early to his inheritance, he had\r\nsickened of the idle life of an officer in peacetime; and after three\r\nyears of service, believing himself fit for something higher, he had\r\nsold his commission and turned his mind to intellectual pursuits. He\r\nhoped that he had a bent that way; and the glory of the immortal three,\r\nwho thirty years before had founded the “Edinburgh Review,” and, by so\r\ndoing, made this day possible, attracted him. Why should not he, as\r\nwell as another, be the man who, in the Commons, the cockpit of the\r\nnation, stood spurred to meet all comers—in an uproar which could\r\nalmost be heard where he walked? Or the man who, in the lists of\r\nThemis, upheld the right of the widow and the poor man’s cause, and to\r\nwhom judges listened with reluctant admiration? Or best of all, highest\r\nof all, might he not vie with that abnormal and remarkable man who wore\r\nat once the three crowns, and whether as Edinburgh Reviewer, as knight\r\nof the shire for York, or as Chancellor of England, played his part\r\nwith equal ease? To be brief, it was prizes such as these, distant but\r\nluminous, that held his eyes, incited him to effort, made him live\r\nlaborious days. He believed that he had ability, and though he came\r\nlate to the strife, he brought his experience. If men living from hand\r\nto mouth and distracted by household cares could achieve so much, why\r\nshould not he who had his independence and his place in the world? Had\r\nnot Erskine been such another? He, too, had sickened of barrack life.\r\nAnd Brougham and the two Scotts, Eldon and Stowell. To say nothing of\r\nthis young Macaulay, whose name was beginning to run through every\r\nmouth; and of a dozen others who had risen to fame from a lower and\r\nless advantageous station.\r\n\r\nThe goal was distant, but it was glorious. Nor had the eighteen months\r\nwhich he had given to the study of the law, to attendance at the\r\nAcademic and at a less ambitious debating society, and to the output of\r\nsome scientific feelers, shaken his faith in himself. He had not yet\r\nthought of a seat at St. Stephen’s; for no nomination had fallen to\r\nhim, nor, save from one quarter, was likely to fall. And his income,\r\nsome six hundred a year, though it was ample for a bachelor, would not\r\nstretch to the price of a seat at five thousand for the Parliament, or\r\nfifteen hundred for the Session—the quotations which had ruled of late.\r\nA seat some time, however, he must have; it was a necessary\r\nstepping-stone to the heights he would gain. And the subject in his\r\nmind as he paced Whitehall Place was the abolition of the close\r\nboroughs and the effect which the transfer of electoral power to the\r\nmiddle-class would have on his chances.\r\n\r\nA small thing—no more than a quantity of straw laid thickly before one\r\nof the houses—brought his thoughts down to the present. By a natural\r\nimpulse he raised his eyes to the house; by a coincidence, less\r\nnatural, a hand, even as he looked, showed itself behind one of the\r\npanes of a window on the first floor, and drew down the blind. Vaughan\r\nstood after that, fascinated, and watched the lowering of blind after\r\nblind. And the solemn contrast between his busy thoughts and that which\r\nhad even then happened in the house—between that which lay behind the\r\ndarkened windows and the bright April sunshine about him, the\r\ntwittering of the sparrows in the green, and the tumult of distant\r\ncheering—went home to him.\r\n\r\nHe thought of the lines, so old and so applicable:\r\n\r\n_Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium_\r\n_Versatur urna, serius, ocius_,\r\n\r\n_Sors exitura, et nos in æternum_\r\n\r\n_Exilium impositura cymbæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was still rolling the words on his tongue with that love of the\r\nclassical rhythm which was a mark of his day—and returns no more than\r\nthe taste for the prize-ring which was coeval with it—when the door of\r\nthe house opened and a man came clumsily and heavily out, closed the\r\ndoor behind him, and, with his head bent low and the ungainly movements\r\nof an automaton, made off down the street.\r\n\r\nThe man was very stout as well as tall, his dress slovenly and\r\ndisordered. His hat was pulled awry over his eyes, and his hands were\r\nplunged deep in his breeches pockets. Vaughan saw so much. Then the\r\ndoor opened again, and a face, unmistakably that of a butler, looked\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe servant’s eyes met his, and though the man neither spoke nor\r\nbeckoned, his eyes spoke for him. Vaughan crossed the way to him. “What\r\nis it?” he asked.\r\n\r\nThe man was blubbering. “Oh, Lord; oh, Lord!” he said. “My lady’s gone\r\nnot five minutes, and he’ll not be let nor hindered! He’s to the House,\r\nand if the crowd set upon him he’ll be murdered. For God’s sake, follow\r\nhim, sir! He’s Sir Charles Wetherell, and a better master never walked,\r\nlet them say what they like. If there’s anybody with him, maybe they’ll\r\nnot touch him.”\r\n\r\n“I will follow him,” Vaughan answered. And he hastened after the stout\r\nman, who had by this time reached the corner of the street.\r\n\r\nVaughan was surprised that he had not recognised Wetherell. For in\r\nevery bookseller’s window caricatures of the “Last of the\r\nBoroughbridges,” as the wits called him, after the pocket borough for\r\nwhich he sat, were plentiful as blackberries. Not only was he the\r\nhighest of Tories, but he was a martyr in their cause; for,\r\nAttorney-General in the last Government, he had been dismissed for\r\nresisting the Catholic Claims. Since then he had proved himself, of all\r\nthe opponents of the Bill, the most violent, the most witty, and, with\r\nthe exception of Croker perhaps, the most rancorous. At this date he\r\npassed for the best hated man in England; and representative to the\r\npublic mind of all that was old-fashioned and illiberal and exclusive.\r\nVaughan knew, therefore, that the servant’s fears were not unfounded,\r\nand with a heart full of pity—for he remembered the darkened house—he\r\nmade after him.\r\n\r\nBy this time Sir Charles was some way ahead and already involved in the\r\ncrowd. Fortunately the throng was densest opposite Old Palace Yard,\r\nwhence the King was in the act of departing; and the space before the\r\nHall and before St. Stephen’s Court—the buildings about which abutted\r\non the river—though occupied by a loosely moving multitude, and\r\npresenting a scene of the utmost animation, was not impassable. Sir\r\nCharles was in the heart of the crowd before he was recognised; and\r\nthen his stolid unconsciousness and the general good-humour, born of\r\nvictory, served him well. He was too familiar a figure to pass\r\naltogether unknown; and here and there a man hissed him. One group\r\nturned and hooted after him. But he was within a dozen yards of the\r\nentrance of St. Stephen’s Court, with Vaughan on his heels, before any\r\nviolence was offered. There a man whom he happened to jostle recognised\r\nhim and, bawling abuse, pushed him rudely; and the act might well have\r\nbeen the beginning of worse things. But Vaughan touched the man on the\r\nshoulder and looked him in the face. “I shall know you,” he said\r\nquietly. “Have a care!” And the fellow, intimidated by his words and\r\nhis six feet of height, shrank into himself and stood back.\r\n\r\nWetherell had barely noticed the rudeness. But he noted the\r\nintervention by a backward glance. “Much obliged,” he grunted. “Know\r\nyou, too, again, young gentleman.” And he went heavily on and passed\r\nout of the crowd into the court, followed by a few scattered hisses.\r\n\r\nBehind the officers of the House who guarded the entrance a group of\r\nexcited talkers were gathered. They were chiefly members who had just\r\nleft the House and had been brought to a stand by the sight of the\r\ncrowd. On seeing Wetherell, surprise altered their looks. “Good G—d!”\r\ncried one, stepping forward. “You’ve come down, Wetherell?”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” the stricken man answered without lifting his eyes or giving the\r\nleast sign of animation. “Is it too late?”\r\n\r\n“By an hour. There’s nothing to be done. Grey and Bruffam have got the\r\nKing body and soul. He was so determined to dissolve, he swore that\r\nhe’d come down in a hackney-coach rather than not come. So they say!”\r\n\r\n“Ay!”\r\n\r\n“But I hope,” a second struck in, in a tone of solicitude, “that as you\r\nare here, Lady Wetherell has rallied.”\r\n\r\n“She died a quarter of an hour ago,” he muttered. “I could do no more.\r\nI came here. But as I am too late, I’ll go back.”\r\n\r\nYet he stood awhile, as if he had no longer anything to draw him one\r\nway more than another; with his double chin and pendulous cheeks\r\nresting on his breast and his leaden eyes sunk to the level of the\r\npavement. And the others stood round him with shocked faces, from which\r\nhis words and manner had driven the flush of the combat. Presently two\r\nmembers, arguing loudly, came up, and were silenced by a glance and a\r\nmuttered word. The ungainly attitude, the ill-fitting clothes, did but\r\naccentuate the tragedy of the central figure. They knew—none better—how\r\nfiercely, how keenly, how doggedly he had struggled against death,\r\nagainst the Bill.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, had they thought of it, the vulgar caricatures that had hurt\r\nher, the abuse that had passed him by to lodge in her bosom, would hurt\r\nher no more!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Vaughan, as soon as he had seen Sir Charles within the\r\nentrance reserved for members, had betaken himself to the main door of\r\nthe Hall, a few paces to the westward. He had no hope that he would now\r\nbe able to perform the errand on which he had set forth; for the\r\nChancellor, for certain, would have other fish to fry and other people\r\nto see. But he thought that he would leave a card with the usher, so\r\nthat Lord Brougham might know that he had not failed to come, and might\r\nmake a fresh appointment if he still wished to see him.\r\n\r\nOf the vast congeries of buildings which then encased St. Stephen’s\r\nChapel and its beautiful but degraded cloisters, little more than the\r\nHall is left to us. The Hall we have, and in the main in the condition\r\nin which the men of that generation viewed it; as Canning viewed it,\r\nwhen with death in his face he paced its length on Peel’s arm, and\r\nsuspecting, perhaps, that they two would meet no more, proved to all\r\nmen the good-will he bore his rival. Those among us whose memories go\r\nback a quarter of a century, and who can recall its aspect in\r\nterm-time, with three score barristers parading its length, and thrice\r\nas many suitors and attorneys darting over its pavement—all under the\r\nlofty roof which has no rival in Europe—will be able to picture it as\r\nVaughan saw it when he entered. To the bustle attending the courts of\r\nlaw was added on this occasion the supreme excitement of the day. In\r\nevery corner, on the steps of every court, eager groups wrangled and\r\ndebated; while above the hubbub of argument and the trampling of feet,\r\nthe voices of ushers rose monotonously, calling a witness or enjoining\r\norder.\r\n\r\nVaughan paused beside the cake-stall at the door and surveyed the\r\nscene. As he stood, one of two men who were pacing near saw him, and\r\nwith a whispered word left his companion and came towards him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Vaughan,” he said, extending his hand with bland courtesy, “I hope\r\nyou are well. Can I do anything for you? We are dissolved, but a frank\r\nis a frank for all that—to-day.”\r\n\r\n“No, I thank you,” Vaughan answered. “The truth is, I had an\r\nappointment with the Chancellor for this afternoon. But I suppose he\r\nwill not see me now.”\r\n\r\nThe other’s eyebrows met, with the result that his face looked less\r\nbland. He was a small man, with keen dark eyes and bushy grey whiskers,\r\nand an air of hawk-like energy which sixty years had not tamed. He wore\r\nthe laced coat of a sergeant at law, powdered on the shoulders, as if\r\nhe had but lately and hurriedly cast off his wig. “Good G—d!” he said.\r\n“With the Chancellor!” And then, pulling himself up, “But I\r\ncongratulate you. A student at the Bar, as I believe you are, Mr.\r\nVaughan, who has appointments with the Chancellor, has fortune indeed\r\nwithin his grasp.”\r\n\r\nVaughan laughed. “I fear not,” he said. “There are appointments and\r\nappointments, Sergeant Wathen. Mine is not of a professional nature.”\r\n\r\nStill the sergeant’s face, do what he would, looked grim. He had his\r\nreasons for disliking what he heard. “Indeed!” he said drily. “Indeed!\r\nBut I must not detain you. Your time,” with a faint note of sarcasm,\r\n“is valuable.” And with a civil salutation the two parted.\r\n\r\nWathen went back to his companion. “Talk of the Old One!” he said. “Do\r\nyou know who that is?”\r\n\r\n“No,” the other answered. They had been discussing the coming election.\r\n“Who is it?”\r\n\r\n“One of my constituents.”\r\n\r\nHis friend laughed. “Oh, come,” he said. “I thought you had but one,\r\nsergeant—old Vermuyden.”\r\n\r\n“Only one,” Wathen answered, his eyes travelling from group to group,\r\n“who counts; or rather, who did count. But thirteen who poll. And\r\nthat’s one of them.” He glanced frowning in the direction which Vaughan\r\nhad taken. “And what do you think his business is here, confound him?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“An appointment with old Wicked Shifts.”\r\n\r\n“With the Chancellor? Pheugh!”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” the sergeant answered morosely, “you may whistle. There’s some\r\nblack business on foot, you may depend upon it. And ten to one it’s\r\nabout my seat. He’s a broom,” he continued, tugging at the whiskers\r\nwhich the late King had stamped with the imprimatur of fashion, “that\r\nwill make a clean sweep of us if we don’t take care. Whatever he does,\r\nthere’s something behind it. Some bedchamber plot, or some intrigue to\r\nget A. out and put B. in. If it was a charwoman’s place he wanted, he’d\r\nnot ask for it and get it. That wouldn’t please him. But he’d tunnel\r\nand tunnel and tunnel—and so he’d get it.”\r\n\r\n“Still,” the other replied, with secret amusement—for he had no seat,\r\nand the woes of our friends, especially our better-placed friends, have\r\ntheir comic side—“I thought that you had a safe thing, Wathen? That old\r\nVermuyden’s nomination at Chippinge was as good as an order on the Bank\r\nof England?”\r\n\r\n“It was,” Wathen answered drily. “But with the country wild for the\r\nBill, there’s no saying what may happen anywhere. Safe!” he continued,\r\nwith a snarl. “Was there ever a safer seat than Westbury? Or a man who\r\nhad a place in better order than old Lopes, who owned it, and died last\r\nmonth; taken from the evil to come, Jekyll said, for he never could\r\nhave existed in a world without rotten boroughs! It’s not far from\r\nChippinge, so I know—know it well. And I tell you his system was\r\nbeautiful—beautiful! Yet when Peel was there—after he had rattled on\r\nthe Catholic Claims and been thrown out at Oxford, Lopes made way for\r\nhim, you remember?—he would not have got in, no, by G—d, he wouldn’t\r\nhave got in if there had been a man against him. And the state in which\r\nthe country was then, though there was a bit of a Protestant cry, too,\r\nwasn’t to compare with what it will be now. That man”—he shook his fist\r\nstealthily in the direction of the Chancellor’s Court—“has lighted a\r\nfire in England that will never be put out till it has consumed King,\r\nLords, and Commons—ay, every stick and stone of the old Constitution.\r\nYou take my word for it. And to think—to think,” he added still more\r\nsavagely, “that it is the Whigs have done this. The Whigs! who own more\r\nthan half the land in the country; who are prouder and stiffer than old\r\nGeorge the Third himself; who wouldn’t let you nor me into their\r\nCabinet to save our lives. By the Lord,” he concluded with gusto,\r\n“they’ll soon learn the difference!”\r\n\r\n“In the meantime—there’ll be dead cats and bad eggs flying, you think?”\r\n\r\nWathen groaned. “If that were the end of it,” he said, “I’d not mind.”\r\n\r\n“Still, with it all, you are pretty safe, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“With that fellow closeted with the Chancellor? No, no!”\r\n\r\n“Who is the young spark!” the other asked carelessly. “He looked a\r\ndecentish kind of fellow. A little of the prig, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“He’s that!” Wathen answered. “A d——d prig. What’s more, a cousin of\r\nold Vermuyden’s. And what’s worse, his heir. That’s why they put him in\r\nthe corporation and made him one of the thirteen. Thought the vote safe\r\nin the family, you see? And cheaper?” He winked. “But there’s no love\r\nlost between him and old Sir Robert. A bed for a night once a year, and\r\none day in the season among the turnips, and glad to see your back, my\r\nlad! That’s about the position. Now I wonder if Brougham is going to\r\ntry—but Lord! there’s no guessing what is in that man’s head! He’s\r\nfuller of mischief than an egg of meat!”\r\n\r\nThe other was about to answer when one of the courts, in which a case\r\nof some difficulty had caused a late sitting, discharged its noisy,\r\nwrangling, perspiring crowd. The two stepped aside to avoid the\r\nevasion, and did not resume their talk. Wathen’s friend made his way\r\nout by the main door near which they had been standing; while the\r\nsergeant, with looks which mirrored the gloom that a hundred Tory faces\r\nwore on that day, betook himself to the robing-room. There he happened\r\nupon another unfortunate. They fell to talking, and their talk ran\r\nnaturally upon the Chancellor, upon old Grey’s folly in letting himself\r\nbe led by the nose by such a rogue; finally, upon the mistakes of their\r\nown party. They differed on the last topic, and in that natural and\r\ncustomary state we may leave them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\nTHE SPIRIT OF THE STORM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Chancery, the preserve for nearly a quarter of a century\r\nof Eldon and Delay, was the farthest from the entrance on the\r\nright-hand side of the Hall—a situation which enabled the Chancellor to\r\npass easily to that other seat of his labours, the Woolsack. Two steps\r\nraised the Tribunals of the Common Law above the level of the Hall. But\r\nas if to indicate that this court was not the seat of anything so\r\ncommon as law, but was the shrine of that more august conception,\r\nPatronage, and the altar to which countless divines of the Church of\r\nEngland looked with unwinking devotion, a flight of six or eight steps\r\nled up to the door.\r\n\r\nThe privacy thus secured had been much to the taste of Lord Eldon.\r\nDoubt and delay flourish best in a close and dusty atmosphere; and if\r\never there was a man to whom that which was was right, it was “Old\r\nBags.” Nor had Lord Lyndhurst, his immediate successor, quarrelled with\r\nan arrangement which left him at liberty to devote his time to society\r\nand his beautiful wife. But the man who now sat in the marble chair was\r\nof another kind from either of these. His worst enemy could not lay\r\ndulness to his charge; nor could he who lectured the Whitbreads on\r\nbrewing, who explained their art to opticians, who vied with Talleyrand\r\nin the knowledge of French literature, who wrote eighty articles for\r\nthe first twenty numbers of the “Edinburgh Review,” be called a\r\nsluggard. Confident of his powers, Brougham loved to display them; and\r\nthe wider the arena the better he was pleased. His first sitting had\r\nbeen graced by the presence of three royal dukes, a whole Cabinet, and\r\na score of peers in full dress. Having begun thus auspiciously, he was\r\nnot the man to vegetate in the gloom of a dry-as-dust court, or to be\r\ncontent with an audience of suitors, whom equity, blessed word, had\r\nlong stripped of their votes.\r\n\r\nAgain and again during the last six months, by brilliant declamations\r\nor by astounding statement, he had filled his court to the last inch.\r\nThe lions in the Tower, the tombs in the Abbey, the New Police—all were\r\ndeserted; and countryfolk flocked to Westminster, not to hear the\r\njudgments of the highest legal authority in the land, but to see with\r\ntheir own eyes the fugleman of reform—the great orator, whose voice,\r\nraised at the Yorkshire election, had found an echo that still\r\nthundered in the ears and the hearts of England.\r\n\r\n“I am for Reform!” he had said in the castle yard of York; and the\r\npeople of England had answered: “So are we; and we will have it, or——”\r\n\r\nThe lacuna they had filled, not with words, but with facts stronger\r\nthan words—with the flames of Kentish farmhouses and Wiltshire\r\nfactories; with political unions counting their numbers by scores of\r\nthousands; with midnight drillings and vague and sullen murmurings;\r\nabove all, with the mysterious terror of some great change which was to\r\ncome—a terror that shook the most thoughtless and affected even the\r\nDuke, as men called the Duke of Wellington in that day. For was not\r\nevery crown on the Continent toppling?\r\n\r\nVaughan did not suppose that, in view of the startling event of the\r\nday, he would be admitted. But the usher, who occupied a high stool\r\noutside the great man’s door, no sooner read his card than he slid to\r\nthe ground. “I think his lordship will see you, sir,” he murmured\r\nblandly; and he disappeared.\r\n\r\nHe was back on the instant, and, beckoning to Vaughan to follow him, he\r\nproceeded some paces along a murky corridor, which the venerable form\r\nof Eldon seemed still to haunt. Opening a door, he stood aside.\r\n\r\nThe room which Vaughan saw before him was stately and spacious, and\r\nfurnished with quiet richness. A deep silence, intensified by the fact\r\nthat the room had no windows, but was lighted from above, reigned in\r\nit—and a smell of law-calf. Here and there on a bookcase or a pedestal\r\nstood a marble bust of Bacon, of Selden, of Blackstone. And for a\r\nmoment Vaughan fancied that these were its only occupants. On advancing\r\nfurther, however, he discovered two persons, who were writing busily at\r\nseparate side-tables; and one of them looked up and spoke.\r\n\r\n“Your pardon, Mr. Vaughan!” he said. “One moment, if you please!”\r\n\r\nHe was almost as good as his word, for less than a minute later he\r\nthrew down the pen, and rose—a gaunt figure in a black frockcoat, and\r\nwith a black stock about his scraggy neck—and came to meet his visitor.\r\n\r\n“I fear that I have come at an untimely moment, my lord,” Vaughan said,\r\na little awed in spite of himself by what he knew of the man.\r\n\r\nBut the other’s frank address put him at once at his ease. “Politics\r\npass, Mr. Vaughan,” the Chancellor answered lightly, “but science\r\nremains.” He did not explain, as he pointed to a seat, that he loved,\r\nabove all things, to produce startling effects; to dazzle by the ease\r\nwith which he flung off one part and assumed another.\r\n\r\nHenry Brougham—so, for some time after his elevation to the peerage, he\r\npersisted in signing himself—was at this time at the zenith of his\r\nlife, as of his fame. Tall, but lean and ungainly, with a long neck and\r\nsloping shoulders, he had one of the strangest faces which genius has\r\never worn. His clownish features, his high cheek-bones, and queer\r\nbulbous nose are familiar to us; for, something exaggerated by the\r\ncaricaturist, they form week by week the trailing mask which mars the\r\ncover of “Punch.” Yet was the face, with all its ugliness, singularly\r\nmobile; and the eyes, the windows of that restless and insatiable soul,\r\nshone, sparkled, laughed, wept, with incredible brilliance. That which\r\nhe did not know, that which his mind could not perform—save sit still\r\nand be discreet—no man had ever discovered. And it was the knowledge of\r\nthis, the sense of the strange and almost uncanny versatility of the\r\nman, which for a moment overpowered Vaughan.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor seated himself opposite his visitor, and placed a hand\r\non each of his wide-spread knees. He smiled.\r\n\r\n“My friend,” he said, “I envy you.”\r\n\r\nVaughan coloured shyly. “Your lordship has little cause,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Great cause,” was the reply, “great cause! For as you are I was—and,”\r\nhe chuckled, as he rocked himself to and fro, “I have not found life\r\nvery empty or very unpleasant. But it was not to tell you this that I\r\nasked you to wait on me, Mr. Vaughan, as you may suppose. Light! It is\r\na singular thing that you at the outset of your career—even as I thirty\r\nyears ago at the same point of mine—should take up such a parergon, and\r\nalight upon the same discovery.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think I understand.”\r\n\r\n“In your article on the possibility of the permanence of reflection—to\r\nwhich I referred in my letter, I think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my lord, you did.”\r\n\r\n“You have restated a fact which I maintained for the first time more\r\nthan thirty years ago! In my paper on colours, read before the Royal\r\nSociety in—I think it was ’96.”\r\n\r\nVaughan stared. His colour rose slowly. “Indeed?” he said, in a tone\r\nfrom which he vainly strove to banish incredulity.\r\n\r\n“You have perhaps read the paper?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I have.”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor chuckled. “And found nothing of the kind in it?” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nVaughan coloured still more deeply. He felt that the position was\r\nunpleasant. “Frankly, my lord, if you ask me, no.”\r\n\r\n“And you think yourself,” with a grin, “the first discoverer?”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\nBrougham sprang like a boy to his feet, and whisked his long, lank body\r\nto a distant bookshelf. Thence he took down a much-rubbed manuscript\r\nbook. As he returned he opened this at a place already marked, and,\r\nlaying it on the table, beckoned to the young man to approach. “Read\r\nthat,” he said waggishly, “and confess, young sir, that there were\r\nchiefs before Agamemnon.”\r\n\r\nVaughan stooped over the book, and having read looked up in perplexity.\r\n“But this passage,” he said, “was not in the paper read before the\r\nRoyal Society in ’96?”\r\n\r\n“In the paper read? No. Nor yet in the paper printed? There, too, you\r\nare right. And why? Because a sapient dunder-head who was in authority\r\nrequested me to omit this passage. He did not believe that light\r\npassing through a small hole in the window-shutter of a darkened room\r\nimpresses a view of external objects on white paper; nor that, as I\r\nsuggested, the view might be made permanent if cast instead on ivory\r\nrubbed with nitrate of silver!”\r\n\r\nVaughan was dumbfounded, and perhaps a little chagrined. “It is most\r\nsingular!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Do you wonder now that I could not refrain from sending for you?”\r\n\r\n“I do not, indeed.”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor patted him kindly on the shoulder, and by a gesture made\r\nhim resume his seat. “No, I could not refrain,” he continued; “the\r\ncoincidence was too remarkable. If you come to sit where I sit, the\r\nchance will be still more singular.”\r\n\r\nVaughan coloured with pleasure. “Alas!” he said, smiling, “one swallow,\r\nmy lord, does not made a summer.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my friend,” with a benevolent look. “But I know more of you than\r\nyou think. You were in the service, I hear, and left it. _Cedant arma\r\ntogæ_, eh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I, too, after a fashion. Thirty years ago I served a gun with\r\nProfessor Playfair in the Volunteer Artillery of Edinburgh. God knows,”\r\nhe continued complacently, “if I had gone on with it, where I should\r\nhave landed! Where the Duke is, perhaps! More surprising things have\r\nhappened.”\r\n\r\nVaughan did not know whether to take this, which was gravely and even\r\nsentimentally spoken, for jest or earnest. He did not speak. And\r\nBrougham, seated in his favourite posture, with a hand on either knee,\r\nhis lean body upright, and the skirts of his black coat falling to the\r\nfloor on either side of him, resumed. “I hear, too, that you have done\r\nwell at the Academic,” he said, “and on the right side, Mr. Vaughan.\r\nLight? Ay, always light, my friend, always light! Let that be our\r\nmotto. For myself,” he continued earnestly, “I have taken it in hand\r\nthat this poor country shall never lack light again; and by God’s help\r\nand Johnny Russell’s Bill I’ll bring it about! And not the\r\nphosphorescent light of rotten boroughs and corrupt corporations, Mr.\r\nVaughan. No, nor the blaze of burning stacks, kindled by wretched,\r\nstarving, ignorant—ay, above all, Mr. Vaughan, ignorant men! But the\r\nlight of education, the light of a free Press, the light of good\r\ngovernment and honest representation; so that, whatever they lack,\r\nhenceforth they shall have voices and means and ways to make their\r\nwants known. You agree with me? But I know you do, for I hear how well\r\nyou have spoken on that side. Mr. Cornelius,” turning and addressing\r\nthe gentleman who still continued to write at his table, “who was it\r\ntold us of Mr. Vaughan’s speech at the Academic?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” Mr. Cornelius answered gruffly.\r\n\r\n“No?” the Chancellor said, not a whit put out. “He never knows\r\nanything!” And then, throwing one knee over the other, he regarded\r\nVaughan with closer attention. “Mr. Vaughan,” he said, “have you ever\r\nthought of entering Parliament?”\r\n\r\nVaughan’s heart bounded, and his face betrayed his emotions. Good\r\nheavens, was the Chancellor about to offer him a Government seat? He\r\nscarcely knew what to expect or what to say. The prospect, suddenly\r\nopened, blinded him. He muttered that he had not as yet thought of it.\r\n\r\n“You have no connection,” Brougham continued, “who could help you to a\r\nseat? For if so, now is the time. Presently there will be a Reformed\r\nParliament and a crowd of new men, and the road will be blocked by the\r\nthrong of aspirants. You are not too young. Palmerston was not so old\r\nwhen Perceval offered him a seat in the Cabinet.”\r\n\r\nThe words, the tone, the assumption that such things were for him—that\r\nhe had but to hold out his hand and they would fall into it—dropped\r\nlike balm into the young man’s soul. Yet he was not sure that the other\r\nwas serious, and he made a tremendous effort to hide the emotion he\r\nfelt. “I am afraid,” he said, with a forced smile, “that I, my lord, am\r\nnot Lord Palmerston.”\r\n\r\n“No?” Brougham answered with a faint sneer. “But not much the worse for\r\nthat, perhaps. So that if you have any connection who commands a seat,\r\nnow is the time.”\r\n\r\nVaughan shook his head. “I have none,” he said, “except my cousin, Sir\r\nRobert Vermuyden.”\r\n\r\n“Vermuyden of Chippinge?” the Chancellor exclaimed, in a voice of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n“The same, my lord.”\r\n\r\n“Good G—d!” Brougham cried. It was not a mealy-mouthed age. And he\r\nleant back and stared at the young man. “You don’t mean to say that he\r\nis your cousin?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor laughed grimly. “Oh, dear, dear!” he said. “I am afraid\r\nthat he won’t help us much. I remember him in the House—an old high and\r\ndry Tory. I am afraid that, with your opinions, you’ve not much to\r\nexpect of him. Still—Mr. Cornelius,” to the gentleman at the table,\r\n“oblige me with Oldfield’s ‘House of Commons,’ the Wiltshire volume,\r\nand the private Borough List. Thank you. Let me see—ah, here it is!”\r\n\r\nHe proceeded to read in a low tone, skipping from heading to heading:\r\n“Chippinge, in the county of Wilts, has returned two members since the\r\ntwenty-third of Edward III. Right of election in the Alderman and the\r\ntwelve capital burgesses, who hold their places for life. Number of\r\nvoters, thirteen. Patron, Sir Robert Vermuyden, Bart., of Stapylton\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\n“Umph, as I thought,” he continued, laying down the book. “Now what\r\ndoes the list say?” And, taking it in turn from his knee, he read:\r\n\r\n“In Schedule A for total disfranchisement, the population under 2000.\r\nPresent members, Sergeant Wathen and Mr. Cooke, on nomination of Sir\r\nRobert Vermuyden; the former to oblige Lord Eldon, the latter by\r\npurchase. Both opponents of Bill; nothing to be hoped from them. The\r\nBowood interest divides the corporation in the proportion of four to\r\nnine, but has not succeeded in returning a member since the election of\r\n1741—on petition. The heir to the Vermuyden interest is——” He broke off\r\nsharply, but continued to study the page. Presently he looked over it.\r\n\r\n“Are you the Mr. Vaughan who inherits?” he asked gravely.\r\n\r\n“The greater part of the estates—yes.”\r\n\r\nBrougham laid down the book and rubbed his chin. “Under those\r\ncircumstances,” he said, after musing a while, “don’t you think that\r\nyour cousin could be persuaded to return you as an independent member?”\r\n\r\nVaughan shook his head with decision.\r\n\r\n“The matter is important,” the Chancellor continued slowly, and as if\r\nhe weighed his words. “I cannot precisely make a promise, Mr. Vaughan;\r\nbut if your cousin could see the question of the Bill in another light,\r\nI have little doubt that any object in reason could be secured for him.\r\nIf, for instance, it should be necessary in passing the Bill through\r\nthe Upper House to create new—eh?”\r\n\r\nHe paused, looking at Vaughan, who laughed outright. “Sir Robert would\r\nnot cross the park to save my life, my lord,” he said. “And I am sure\r\nhe would rather hang outside the White Lion in Chippinge marketplace\r\nthan resign his opinions or his borough!”\r\n\r\n“He’ll lose the latter, whether or no,” Brougham answered, with a touch\r\nof irritation. “Was there not some trouble about his wife? I think I\r\nremember something.”\r\n\r\n“They were separated many years ago.”\r\n\r\n“She is alive, is she not?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nBrougham saw, perhaps, that the subject was not palatable, and he\r\nabandoned it. With an abrupt change of manner he flung the books from\r\nhim with the recklessness of a boy, and raised his sombre figure to its\r\nheight. “Well, well,” he said, “I hoped for better things; but I fear,\r\nas Tommy Moore sings—\r\n\r\n“_He’s pledged himself, though sore bereft_\r\n\r\n_Of ways and means of ruling ill_,\r\n\r\n_To make the most of what are left_\r\n\r\n_And stick to all that’s rotten still!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd by the Lord, I don’t say that I don’t respect him. I respect every\r\nman who votes honestly as he thinks.” And grandly, with appropriate\r\ngestures, he spouted:\r\n\r\n“_Who spurns the expedient for the right_\r\n\r\n_Scorns money’s all-attractive charms,_\r\n\r\n_And through mean crowds that clogged his flight_\r\n\r\n_Has nobly cleared his conquering arms_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s the Attorney-General’s. He turns old Horace well, doesn’t he?”\r\n\r\nVaughan coloured. Young and candid, he could not bear the thought of\r\ntaking credit where he did not deserve it. “I fear,” he said awkwardly,\r\n“that would bear rather hardly on me if we had a contest at Chippinge,\r\nmy lord. Fortunately it is unlikely.”\r\n\r\n“How would it bear hardly on you?” Brougham asked, with interest.\r\n\r\n“I have a vote.”\r\n\r\n“You are one of the twelve burgesses?” in a tone of surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes, by favour of Sir Robert.”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor, smiling gaily, shook his head. “No,” he said, “no; I do\r\nnot believe you. You do yourself an injustice. Leave that sort of thing\r\nto older men, to Lyndhurst, if you will, d——d Jacobin as he is,\r\npreening himself in Tory feathers, and determined whoever’s in he’ll\r\nnot be out; or to Peel. Leave it! And believe me you’ll not repent it.\r\nI,” he continued loftily, “have seen fifty years of life, Mr. Vaughan,\r\nand lived every year of them and every day of them, and I tell you that\r\nthe thing is too dearly bought at that price.”\r\n\r\nVaughan felt himself rebuked; but he made a fight. “And yet,” he said,\r\n“are there no circumstances, my lord, in which such a vote may be\r\njustified?”\r\n\r\n“A vote against your conscience—to oblige someone?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes.”\r\n\r\n“A Jesuit might justify it. There is nothing which a Jesuit could not\r\njustify, I suppose. But though no man was stronger for the Catholic\r\nClaims than I was, I do not hold a Jesuit to be a man of honour. And\r\nthat is where the difference lies. There! But,” he continued, with an\r\nabrupt change from the lofty to the confidential, “let me tell you a\r\nfact, Mr. Vaughan. In ’29—was it in April or May of ’29, Mr.\r\nCornelius?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know to what you refer,” Mr. Cornelius grunted.\r\n\r\n“To be sure you don’t,” the Chancellor replied, without any loss of\r\ngood-humour; “but in April or May of ’29, Mr. Vaughan, the Duke offered\r\nme the Rolls, which is £7000 a year clear for life, and compatible with\r\na seat in the Commons. It would have suited me better in every way than\r\nthe Seals and the House of Lords. It was the prize, to be frank with\r\nyou, at which I was aiming; and as at that time the Duke was making his\r\nright-about-face on the Catholic question, and was being supported by\r\nour side, I might have accepted it with an appearance of honour and\r\nconsistency. But I did not accept it. I did not, though my refusal\r\ninjured myself, and did no one any good. But there, I am chattering.”\r\nHe broke off, with a smile, and held out his hand. “However,\r\n\r\n“_Est et fideli tuta silentio\r\nMerces!_\r\n\r\n\r\nYou won’t forget that, I am certain. And you may be sure I shall\r\nremember you. I am pleased to have made your acquaintance, Mr. Vaughan.\r\nDecide on the direction, politics or the law, in which you mean to\r\npush, and some day let me know. In the meantime follow the light!\r\nLight, more light! Don’t let them lure you back into old Giant\r\nDespair’s cave, or choke you with all the dead bones and rottenness and\r\nfoulness they keep there, and that, by God’s help, I’ll sweep out of\r\nthe world before it’s a year older!”\r\n\r\nAnd still talking, he saw Vaughan, who was murmuring his\r\nacknowledgments, to the door.\r\n\r\nWhen that had closed on the young man Brougham came back, and, throwing\r\nwide his arms, yawned prodigiously. “Now,” he said, “if Lansdowne\r\ndoesn’t effect something in that borough, I am mistaken.”\r\n\r\n“Why,” Cornelius muttered curtly, “do you trouble about the borough?\r\nWhy don’t you leave those things to the managers?”\r\n\r\n“Why? Why, first because the Duke did that last year, and you see the\r\nresult—he’s out and we’re in. Secondly, Corny, because I am like the\r\nelephant’s trunk, that can tear down a tree or pick up a pin.”\r\n\r\n“But in picking up a pin,” the other grunted, “it picks up a deal of\r\nsomething else.”\r\n\r\n“Of what?”\r\n\r\n“Dirt!”\r\n\r\n“Old Pharisee!” the Chancellor cried.\r\n\r\nMr. Cornelius threw down his pen, and, turning in his seat, opened fire\r\non his companion. “Dirt!” he reiterated sternly. “And for what? What\r\nwill be the end of it when you have done all for them, clean and dirty?\r\nThey’ll not keep you. They use you now, but you’re a new man. What,\r\nyou—_you_ think to deal on equal terms with the Devonshires and the\r\nHollands, the Lansdownes and the Russells! Who used Burke, and when\r\nthey had squeezed him tossed him aside? Who used Tierney till they wore\r\nhim and his fortune out? Who would have used Canning, but he did not\r\ntrust them, and so they worried him—though they were all dumb dogs\r\nbefore him—to his death. Ay, and presently, when you have served their\r\nturn, they will cast you aside.”\r\n\r\n“They will not dare!” Brougham cried.\r\n\r\n“Pshaw! You are Samson, but you are shorn of your strength. They have\r\nbeen too clever for you. While you were in the Commons they did not\r\ndare. Harry Brougham was their master. So they lured you, poor fool,\r\ninto the trap, into the Lords, where you may spout, and spout, and\r\nspout, and it will have as much effect as the beating of a bird’s wings\r\nagainst the bars of its cage!”\r\n\r\n“They will not dare!” Brougham reiterated.\r\n\r\n“You will see. They will throw you aside.”\r\n\r\nBrougham walked up and down the room, his eyes glittering, his quaint,\r\nmisshapen features working passionately.\r\n\r\n“They will throw you aside,” Mr. Cornelius repeated, watching him\r\nkeenly. “You are a man of the people. You are in earnest. You are\r\nhonestly in favour of retrenchment, of education, of reform. But to\r\nthese Whigs—save and except to Althorp, who is that _lusus naturæ_, an\r\nhonest man, and to Johnny Russell, who is a fanatic—these are but\r\ncatchwords, stalking-horses, the means by which, after the dull old\r\nfashion of their fathers and their grandfathers and their\r\ngreat-grandfathers, they think to creep into power. Reform, if reform\r\nmeans the representation of the people by the people, the rule of the\r\npeople by the people, or by any but the old landed families—why, the\r\nvery thought would make them sick!”\r\n\r\nBrougham stopped in his pacing to and fro. “You are right,” he said\r\nsombrely.\r\n\r\n“You acknowledge it?”\r\n\r\n“I have known it—here!” And, drawing himself to his full height, he\r\nclapped his hand to his breast. “I have known it here for months. Ay,\r\nand though I have sworn to myself that they would not dare to treat me\r\nas they treated Burke, and Sheridan, and Tierney, and as they would\r\nhave treated Canning, I knew it was a lie, my lad; I knew they would.\r\nMy mother—ay, my old mother, sitting by the chimneyside, out of the\r\nworld there, knew it, and warned me.”\r\n\r\n“Then why did you go into the Lords?” Cornelius asked. “Why be lured\r\ninto the gilded cage, where you are helpless?”\r\n\r\n“Because, mark you,” Brougham replied sternly, “if I had not, they had\r\nnot brought in this Bill. And we had waited, and the people had waited,\r\nanother twenty years, maybe!”\r\n\r\n“And so you went into the prison-house shorn of your strength?”\r\n\r\nBrougham looked at him with a gleam of ferocity in his brilliant eyes.\r\n“Ay,” he said, “I did. And by that act,” he continued, stretching his\r\nlong arms to their farthest extent, “mark you, mark you, never forget\r\nit, I avenged all—not only all I may suffer at their hands, but all\r\nthat every slave who ever ground in their mill has suffered, the\r\nslights, the grudged meticulous office, the one finger lent to\r\nshake—all, all! I went into the prison-house, but when I did so I laid\r\nmy hands upon the pillars. And their house falls, falls. I hear it—I\r\nhear it falling even now about their ears. They may throw me aside. But\r\nthe house is falling, and the great Whig families—pouf!—they are not in\r\nthe heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water that is\r\nunder the earth. You call Reform their stalking-horse? Ay, but it is\r\ninto their own Troy that they have dragged it; and the clatter of\r\nstrife which you hear is the death-knell of their power. They have let\r\nin the waves of the sea, and dream fondly that they can say where they\r\nshall stop and what they shall not touch. They may as well speak to the\r\ntide when it flows; they may as well command the North Sea in its rage;\r\nthey may as well bid Hume be silent, or Wetherell be sane. You say I am\r\nspent, Cornelius; and so I am, it may be. I know not. But this I know.\r\nNever again will the families say ‘Go!’ and he goeth, and ‘Do!’ and he\r\ndoeth, as in the old world that is passing—passing even at this minute,\r\npassing with the Bill. No,” he continued, flinging out his arms with\r\npassion; “for when they thought to fool me, and to shut me dumb among\r\ndumb things behind the gilded wires, I knew—I knew that I was dragging\r\ndown their house upon their heads.”\r\n\r\nMr. Cornelius stared at him. “By G—d!” he said, “I believe you are\r\nright. I believe that you are a cleverer man than I thought you were.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\nTWO LETTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hall was empty when Vaughan came forth; and as the young man strode\r\ndown its echoing length there was nothing save his own footsteps on the\r\npavement to distract his mind from the scene in which he had taken\r\npart. He was excited and a little uplifted, as was natural. The\r\npromises made, if they were to be counted as promises, were of the\r\nvague and indefinite character which it is as easy to evade as to\r\nfulfil. But the Chancellor had spoken to him as to an equal and treated\r\nhim as one who had but to choose a career to succeed in it, and to win\r\nthe highest prizes which it could bestow. This was flattering; nor was\r\nit to a young man who had little experience of the world, less\r\nflattering to be deemed the owner of a stake in the country, and a\r\nperson through whom offers of the most confidential and important\r\ncharacter might be properly made.\r\n\r\nHe walked to his rooms in Bury Street with a pleasant warmth at his\r\nheart. And at the Academic that evening, where owing to the events of\r\nthe day there was a fuller house than had ever been known, and a\r\nfiercer debate, he championed the Government and upheld the dissolution\r\nin a speech which not only excelled his previous efforts, but was a\r\nsurprise to those who knew him best. Afterwards he recognised that his\r\nperoration had been only a paraphrase of Brougham’s impassioned “Light!\r\nMore Light!” and that the whole owed more than he cared to remember to\r\nthe same source. But, after all, why not? It was not to be expected\r\nthat he could at once rise to the heights of the greatest of living\r\norators. And it was much that he had made a hit; that as he left the\r\nroom he was followed by all eyes.\r\n\r\nNor did a qualm worthy of the name trouble him until the morning of the\r\n27th, five days later—a Wednesday. Then he found beside his breakfast\r\nplate two letters bearing the postmark of Chippinge.\r\n\r\n“What’s afoot?” he muttered. But he had a prevision before he broke the\r\nseal of the first. And the contents bore out his fears. The letter ran\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n“Stapylton, Chippinge.\r\n\r\n“Dear Sir—I make no apology for troubling you in a matter in which your\r\ninterest is second only to mine and which is also of a character to\r\nmake apology beside the mark. It has not been necessary to require your\r\npresence at Chippinge upon the occasion of former elections. But the\r\nunwholesome ferment into which the public mind has been cast by the\r\nmonstrous proposals of Ministers has nowhere been more strongly\r\nexemplified than here, by the fact that, for the first time in half a\r\ncentury, the right of our family to nominate the members for the\r\nBorough is challenged. Since the year 1783 no serious attempt has been\r\nmade to disturb the Vermuyden interest. And I have yet to learn\r\nthat—short of this anarchical Bill, which will sweep away all the\r\nprivileges attaching to property—such an attempt can be made with any\r\nchance of success.\r\n\r\n“I am informed nevertheless that Lord Lansdowne, presuming on a small\r\nconnection in the Corporation, intends to send at least one candidate\r\nto the poll. Our superiority is so great that I should not, even so,\r\ntrouble you to be present, were it not an object to discourage these\r\nattempts by the exhibition of our full strength, and were it not still\r\nmore important to do so at a time when the existence of the Borough\r\nitself is at stake.\r\n\r\n“Isaac White will apprise you of the arrangements to be made and will\r\nkeep you informed of all matters which you should know. Be good enough\r\nto let Mapp learn the day and hour of your arrival, and he will see\r\nthat the carriage and servants meet the coach at Chippenham. Probably\r\nyou will come by the York House. It is the most convenient.\r\n\r\n“I have the honour to be\r\n\r\n“Your sincere kinsman,\r\n\r\n“Robert Vermuyden.\r\n\r\n“To Arthur Vermuyden Vaughan, Esquire,\r\n“17 Bury Street, St. James’s.”\r\n\r\nVaughan’s face grew long, and his fork hung suspended above his plate,\r\nas he perused the old gentleman’s epistle. When all was read he laid it\r\ndown, and whistled. “Here’s a fix!” he muttered. And he thought of his\r\nspeech at the Academic; and for the first time he was sorry that he had\r\nmade it. “Here’s a fix!” he repeated. “What’s to be done?”\r\n\r\nHe was too much disturbed to go on with his breakfast, and he tore open\r\nthe other letter. It was from Isaac White, his cousin’s attorney and\r\nagent. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n“High Street, Chippinge,\r\n\r\n“April 25, 1831.\r\n\r\n“_Chippinge Parliamentary Election_.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir.—I have the honour to inform you, as upon former occasions, that\r\nthe writ in the above is expected and that Tuesday the 3rd day of May\r\nwill be appointed for the nomination. It has not been needful to\r\ntrouble you heretofore, but on this occasion I have reason to believe\r\nthat Sir Robert Vermuyden’s candidates will be opposed by nominees in\r\nthe Bowood Interest, and I have therefore, honoured Sir, to intimate\r\nthat your attendance will oblige.\r\n\r\n“The Vermuyden dinner will take place at the White Lion on Monday the\r\n2nd, when the voters and their friends will sit down at 5 P. M. The\r\nAlderman will preside, and Sir Robert hopes that you will be present.\r\nThe procession to the Hustings will leave the White Lion at ten on\r\nTuesday the 3d, and a poll, if demanded, will be taken after the usual\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\n“Any change in the order of the arrangements will be punctually\r\ncommunicated to you.\r\n\r\n“I have the honour to be, Sir,\r\n\r\n“Your humble obedient servant,\r\n\r\n“Isaac White.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Arthur V. Vaughan, Esq.,\r\n(late H.M.’s 14th Dragoons),\r\n\r\n“17 Bury Street, London.”\r\n\r\n\r\nVaughan flung the letter down and resumed his breakfast moodily. It was\r\na piece of shocking ill-fortune, that was all there was to be said.\r\n\r\nNot that he really regretted his speech! It had committed him a little\r\nmore deeply, but morally he had been committed before. It is a poor\r\nconscience that is not scrupulous in youth; and he was convinced, or\r\nalmost convinced, that if he had never seen the Chancellor he would\r\nstill have found it impossible to support Sir Robert’s candidates.\r\n\r\nFor he was sincere in his support of the Bill; a little because it\r\nflattered his intellect to show himself above the prejudices of the\r\nclass to which he belonged; more, because he was of an age to view with\r\nresentment the abuses which the Bill promised to sweep away. A\r\nGovernment truly representative of the people, such as this Bill must\r\ncreate, would not tolerate the severities which still disgraced the\r\ncriminal law. It would not suffer the heartless delays which made the\r\nname of Chancery synonymous with ruin. Under it spring-guns and\r\nman-traps would no longer scare the owner from his own coverts. The\r\npoor would be taught, the slave would be freed. Above all, whole\r\nclasses of the well-to-do would no longer be deprived of a voice in the\r\nState. No longer would the rights of one small class override the\r\nrights of all other classes.\r\n\r\nHe was at an age, in a word, when hope invites to change; and he was\r\nfor the Bill. “Ay, by Jove, I am!” he muttered, casting the die in\r\nfancy, “and I’ll not be set down! It will be awkward! It will be\r\nodious! But I must go through with it!”\r\n\r\nStill, he was sorry. He sprang from the class which had profited by the\r\nold system—that system under which some eight-score men returned a\r\nmajority of the House of Commons. He had himself the prospect of\r\nreturning two members. He could, therefore enter, to a degree—at times\r\nto a greater degree than he liked,—into the feelings with which the\r\nold-fashioned and the interested, the prudent and the timid, viewed a\r\nchange so great and so radical. But his main objection was personal. He\r\nhated the necessity which forced him to cross the wishes and to trample\r\non the prejudices of an old man whom he regarded with respect, and even\r\nwith reverence: a solitary old man, the head of his family, to whom he\r\nowed the very vote he must withhold; and who would hardly, even by the\r\nlogic of facts, be brought to believe that one of his race and breeding\r\ncould turn against him.\r\n\r\nStill it must be done; the die was cast. The sooner, therefore, it was\r\ndone, the better. He would go down to Stapylton at once, while his\r\ncourage was high; and he would tell Sir Robert. Then, whatever came of\r\nit, he would have nothing with which to reproach himself. In the heat\r\nof resolve he felt very brave and very virtuous; and the moment he rose\r\nfrom breakfast he went to the coach office, and finding that the York\r\nHouse, the fashionable Bath, coach was full for the following day, he\r\nbooked an outside seat on the Bristol White Lion Coach, which also\r\npassed through Chippenham. From Chippenham, Chippinge is distant a\r\nshort nine miles.\r\n\r\nThat evening proved to be memorable; for the greater part of London was\r\nilluminated by the Reformers in honour of the Dissolution; not without\r\nrioting and drunkenness, violence on the part of the mob, and rage on\r\nthe side of the minority. When Vaughan passed through the streets\r\nbefore six next morning, on his way to the White Horse Cellars, traces\r\nof the night’s work still remained; and where the early sun fell on\r\nthem showed ugly and grisly and menacing enough. A moderate reformer\r\nmight well have blenched at the sight, and questioned—as many did\r\nquestion—whither this was tending. But Vaughan was late; the coach, one\r\nout of three which were waiting to start, was horsed. He had only eyes,\r\nas he came hurriedly up, for the seat he had reserved behind the\r\ncoachman.\r\n\r\nIt was empty, and so far his fears were vain. But it annoyed him to\r\nfind that his next-door neighbour was a young lady travelling alone.\r\nShe had the seat on the near side.\r\n\r\nHe climbed up quickly, and to reach his place had to pass before her.\r\nThe space between the seat and the coachman’s box was narrow, and as\r\nshe rose to allow him to pass she glanced up. Their eyes met; Vaughan\r\nraised his hat in mute apology, and took his seat. He said no word. But\r\na miracle had happened, as miracles do happen, when the world is young.\r\nIn his mind, as he sat down, he was not repeating, “What a nuisance!”\r\nbut was saying, “What eyes! What a face! And, oh, heaven, what beauty!\r\nWhat blush-rose cheeks! What a lovely mouth!”\r\n\r\n_For ’twas from eyes of liquid blue_\r\n\r\n_A host of quivered Cupids flew_,\r\n\r\n_And now his heart all bleeding lies_\r\n\r\n_Beneath the army of the eyes_.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe gazed gravely at the group of watermen and night-birds who stood in\r\nthe roadway below waiting to see the coach start. And apparently he was\r\nunmoved. Apparently he was the same Arthur Vermuyden Vaughan who had\r\npassed round the boot of the coach to reach the ladder and his place.\r\nBut he was not the same. His thoughts were no longer querulous, full of\r\nthe haste he had made, and the breakfast he had to make; but of a pair\r\nof gentle eyes which had looked for one instant into his, of a modest\r\nface, sweet and shy, of a Quaker-like bonnet that ravished as no other\r\nbonnet had ever ravished the most susceptible!\r\n\r\nHe was still gazing at the group of loiterers, without seeing them,\r\nwhen he became aware that an elderly woman plainly but respectably\r\ndressed, who was standing by the forewheel of the coach, was looking up\r\nat him, and trying to attract his attention. Seeing that she had caught\r\nhis eye she spoke:\r\n\r\n“Gentleman! Gentleman!” she said—but in a restrained voice, as if she\r\ndid not wish to be generally heard. “The young lady’s address! Please\r\nsay that she’s not left it! For the laundress!”\r\n\r\nHe turned and made sure that there was only one of the sex on the\r\ncoach. Then—to be honest, not without a tiny flutter at his heart—he\r\naddressed his neighbour. “Pardon me,” he said “but there is someone\r\nbelow who wants your address.”\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes on him and his heart gave a perceptible jump. “My\r\naddress?” she echoed in a voice as sweet as her face. “I think that\r\nthere must be some mistake.” And then for a moment she looked at him as\r\nif she doubted his intentions.\r\n\r\nThe doubt was intolerable. “It’s for the laundress,” he said. “See,\r\nthere she is!”\r\n\r\nThe girl rose to look over the side of the coach and perforce leant\r\nacross him. He saw that she had the slenderest waist and the prettiest\r\nfigure—he had every opportunity of seeing. Then the coach started with\r\na jerk, and if she had not steadied herself by laying her hand on his\r\nshoulder, she must have relapsed on his knees. As it was she fell back\r\nsafely into her seat. She blushed.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” she said.\r\n\r\nBut he was looking back. He had his eye on the woman, who remained in\r\nthe roadway, pointing after the coach and apparently asking a bystander\r\nsome question respecting it—perhaps where it stopped. “There she is!”\r\nhe exclaimed. “The woman with the umbrella! She is pointing after us.”\r\n\r\nHis neighbour looked back but made nothing of it. “I know no one in\r\nLondon,” she said a little primly—but with sweet primness—“except the\r\nlady at whose house I stayed last night. And she is not able to leave\r\nthe house. It must be a mistake.” And with a gentle reserve which had\r\nin it nothing of coquetry, she turned her face from him.\r\n\r\nTantivy! Tantivy! Tantivy! They were away, bowling down the slope of\r\nbroad empty Piccadilly with the four nags trotting merrily, and the\r\nApril sun gilding the roofs of the houses, and falling aslant on the\r\nverdure of the Green Park. Then merrily up the rise to Hyde Park\r\nCorner, where the new Grecian Gates looked across at the equally new\r\narch on Constitution Hill; and where Apsley House, the residence of\r\n“the Duke,” hiding with its new coat of Bath stone the old brick walls,\r\npeeped through the trees at the statue of Achilles, erected ten years\r\nback in the Duke’s honour.\r\n\r\nBut, alas! what was this? Wherefore the crowd that even at this early\r\nhour was large enough to fill the roadway and engage the attention of\r\nthe New Police? Vaughan looked and saw that every blind in Apsley House\r\nwas lowered, and that more than half of the windows were shattered. And\r\nthe little French gentleman who, to the coachman’s disgust, had taken\r\nthe box-seat, saw it too; nay, had seen it before, for he had come that\r\nway to the coach office. He pointed to the silent, frowning mansion,\r\nand snapped his fingers.\r\n\r\n“That is your reward for your Vellington!” he cried, turning in his\r\nexcitement to the two behind him. “And his lady, I am told, she lie\r\ndead behind the broken vindows! They did that last night, your\r\n_canaille!_ But he vill not forget! And when the refolution come—bah—he\r\nvill have the iron hand! He vill be the Emperor and he vill repay!”\r\n\r\nNo one answered; they treated him with silent British scorn. But they\r\none and all stared back at the scene, at the grim blind house in the\r\nearly sunshine, and the gaping crowd—as long as it remained in sight.\r\nAnd some, no doubt, pondered the sight. But who, with a pretty face\r\nbeside him and a long day’s drive before him, a drive by mead and\r\nshining river, over hill and down, under the walls of grey churches and\r\nby many a marketplace and cheery inn-yard—who would long dwell on\r\nchanges past or to come? Or fret because in the womb of time might lie\r\nthat “refolution” of which the little Frenchman spoke?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\nTANTIVY! TANTIVY! TANTIVY!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Lion coach was a light coach carrying only five passengers\r\noutside, and merrily it swept by Kensington Church, whence the\r\ntravellers had a peep of Holland House—home of the Whigs—on their\r\nright. And then in a twinkling they were swinging through Hammersmith,\r\nwhere the ale-houses were opening and lusty girls were beginning to\r\ndeliver the milk. They passed through Turnham, through Brentford,\r\nawakening everywhere the lazy with the music of their horn. They saw\r\nSion House on their left, and on their right had a glimpse of the\r\ndistant lawns of Osterley—the seat of Lady Jersey, queen of Almack’s,\r\nand the Holland’s rival. Thence they travelled over Hounslow Heath, and\r\nby an endless succession of mansions and lawns and orchards rich at\r\nthis season with apple blossom, and framing here and there a view of\r\nthe sparkling Thames.\r\n\r\nVaughan breathed the air of spring and let his eyes dwell on scene\r\nafter scene; and he felt that it was good to be young and to sit behind\r\nfast horses. He stole a glance at his neighbour and judged by the\r\nbrightness of her eyes, her parted lips and rapt expression, that she\r\nfelt with him. And he would have said something to her, but he could\r\nthink of nothing worthy of her. At last:\r\n\r\n“It’s a beautiful morning,” he ventured, and cursed his vapidity.\r\n\r\nBut she did not seem to find bathos in the words. “It is, indeed!” she\r\nanswered with an enthusiasm which showed that she had forgotten her\r\ndoubts of him. “And,” she added simply, “I have not been on a coach\r\nsince I was a child!”\r\n\r\n“Not on a coach?” he cried in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“No. Except on the Clapham Stage. And that is not a coach like this!”\r\n\r\n“No, perhaps it is not,” he said. And he thought of her, and—oh,\r\nLord!—of Clapham! And yet after all there was something about her,\r\nabout her grey, dove-like dress and her gentleness, which smacked of\r\nClapham. He wondered who she was and what she was; and he was still\r\nwondering when she turned her eyes on him, and, herself serenely\r\nunconscious, sent a tiny shock through him.\r\n\r\n“I enjoy it the more,” she said, “because I—I am not usually free in\r\nthe morning.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!”\r\n\r\nHe could say no more; not another word. It was the stupidest thing in\r\nthe world, but he was tongue-tied. Seeing, however, that she had turned\r\nfrom him and was absorbed in the view of Windsor rising stately amid\r\nits trees, he had the cleverness to steal a glance at the neat little\r\nbasket which nestled at her feet. Surreptitiously he read the name on\r\nthe label.\r\n\r\nMary Smith\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson’s\r\n\r\nQueen’s Square, Bristol.\r\n\r\nMary Smith! Just Mary Smith! For the moment—it is not to be denied—he\r\nwas sobered by the name. It was not a romantic name. It was anything\r\nbut high-sounding. The author of “Tremayne” or “De Vere,” nay, the\r\nauthor of “Vivian Grey”—to complete the trio of novels which were in\r\nfashion at the time—would have turned up his nose at it. But what did\r\nit matter? He desired no more than to make himself agreeable for the\r\nfew hours which he and this beautiful creature must pass together—in\r\nsunshine and with the fair English landscape gliding by them. And that\r\nbeing so, what need he reck what she called herself or whence she came.\r\nIt was enough that under her modest bonnet her ears were shells and her\r\neyes pure cornflowers, and that a few pleasant words, a little April\r\ndalliance—if only that Frenchman would cease to peep behind him and\r\ngrin—would harm neither the one nor the other.\r\n\r\nBut opportunities let slip do not always recur. As he turned to address\r\nher they rose the ascent of Maidenhead Bridge, had on either hand a\r\nglimpse of the river framed in pale green willows, and halted with\r\nsweating horses before the King’s Arms. The boots advanced, amid a\r\ngroup of gazers, and reared a ladder against the coach. “Half an hour\r\nfor breakfast, gentlemen!” he cried briskly. And through the windows of\r\nthe inn the travellers had a view of a long table whereat the\r\npassengers on the up night-coach were already feasting.\r\n\r\nOur friends hastened to descend, but not so fast that Vaughan failed to\r\nnote the girl’s look of uncertainty, almost of distress. He guessed\r\nthat she was not at ease in a scene so bustling and so new to her. And\r\nthe thought gave him the courage that he needed.\r\n\r\n“Will you allow me to find you a place at the table?” he said. “I know\r\nthis inn and they know me. Guard, the ladder here!” And he took her\r\nhand—oh, such a little, little hand!—and aided her in her descent.\r\n\r\n“Will you follow me?” he said. And he made way for her through the knot\r\nof starers who cumbered the doorway. But once in the coffee-room he\r\nhad, cunning fellow, an inspiration. “Find this lady a seat!” he\r\ncommanded one of the attendant damsels. And when he had seen her seated\r\nand the coffee set before her, he took himself deliberately to the\r\nother end of the room. But whether he did so out of pure respect for\r\nher feelings, or because he thought—and hugged himself on the\r\nthought—that he would be missed, he did not himself know. Nor was he so\r\nmuch a captive, though he counted how many rolls she ate, and looked a\r\ndozen times to see if she looked at him, as to be unable to make an\r\nexcellent breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe cheery, noisy throng at the tables, the brisk coming and going of\r\nthe servants, the smell of hot coffee, the open windows, and the\r\nsunshine outside—where the fresh team of the up night-coach were\r\nalready tossing their heads impatiently—he wondered how it all struck\r\nher, new to such scenes and to this side of life. And then while he\r\nwondered he saw that she had risen from the table and was going out\r\nwith one of the waiting-maids. To reach the door she had to pass near\r\nhim; and, oh bliss, her eyes found him—and she blushed. She blushed, ye\r\nheavens! He saw it clearly, and he sat thinking about it until, though\r\nthe coach was not due to start for another five minutes and he might\r\ncount on the guard summoning him, he was taken with fear lest some one\r\nshould steal his seat. And he hurried out.\r\n\r\nShe was alone on the top of the coach, and a youthful waterman, one of\r\nthe crowd of loiterers below, was making eyes at her to the delight of\r\nhis companions. When Vaughan came forth, “I’d like to be him,” the wag\r\nsaid, winking with vulgar gusto. And the bystanders grinned at the\r\ngood-looking young man who stood in the doorway buttoning up his\r\nbox-coat. The position might soon have become embarrassing to her if\r\nnot to him; but in the nick of time the eye of an inside passenger, who\r\nhad followed him through the doorway, alighted on a huge placard which\r\nhung behind the coach.\r\n\r\n“Take that down!” the stranger cried loudly and pompously. And in a\r\nmoment all eyes were upon him. He prodded with his umbrella at the\r\noffending bill. “Do you hear me? Take it down, sir,” he repeated,\r\nturning to the guard. He was a portly man, reddish about the gills.\r\n“Take it down, sir, or I will! It is disgraceful! I shall report this\r\nconduct to your employers.”\r\n\r\nThe guard hesitated. “It don’t harm you, sir,” he pleaded, anxious, it\r\nwas clear, to propitiate a man who would presently be good for half a\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\n“Don’t harm me?” the choleric gentleman retorted. “Don’t harm me?\r\nWhat’s that to do with it? What right—what right have you, man, to put\r\nparty filth like that on a public vehicle in which I pay to ride? ‘The\r\nBill, the whole Bill, and nothing but the Bill!’ D—n the Bill, sir!”\r\nwith violence. “Take it down! Take it down at once!” he repeated, as if\r\nhis order closed the matter.\r\n\r\nThe guard frowned at the placard, which bore, largely printed, the\r\nlegend which the gentleman found so little to his taste. He rubbed his\r\nhead. “Well, I don’t know, sir,” he said. And then—the crowd about the\r\ncoach was growing—he looked at the driver. “What do you say, Sammy?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch it,” growled the driver, without deigning to turn his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“You see, sir, it is this way,” the guard ventured civilly. “Mr. Palmer\r\nhas a Whig meeting at Reading to-day and the town will be full. And if\r\nwe don’t want rotten eggs and broken windows—we’ll carry that!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll not travel with it!” the stout gentleman answered positively. “Do\r\nyou hear me, man? If you don’t take it down I will!”\r\n\r\n“Best not!” cried a voice from the little crowd about the coach. And\r\nwhen the angry gentleman turned to see who spoke, “Best not!” cried\r\nanother behind him. And he wheeled about again, so quickly that the\r\ncrowd laughed. This raised his wrath to a white heat.\r\n\r\nHe grew purple. “I shall have it taken down!” he said. “Guard, remove\r\nit!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t touch it,” growled the driver—one of a class noted in that day\r\nfor independence and surly manners. “If the gent don’t choose to travel\r\nwith it, let him stop here and be d—d!”\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” the insulted passenger cried, “that I am a Member of\r\nParliament?”\r\n\r\n“I’m hanged if you are!” coachee retorted. “Nor won’t be again!”\r\n\r\nThe crowd roared at this repartee. The guard was in despair. “Anyway,\r\nwe must go on, sir,” he said. And he seized his horn. “Take your seats,\r\ngents! Take your seats!” he cried. “All for Reading! I’m sorry, sir,\r\nbut I’ve to think of the coach.”\r\n\r\n“And the horses!” grumbled the driver. “Where’s the gent’s sense?”\r\n\r\nThey all scrambled to their seats except the ex-member. He stood,\r\nbursting with rage and chagrin. But at the last moment, when he saw\r\nthat the coach would really go without him, he swallowed his pride,\r\nplucked open the coach-door, and amid the loud jeers of the crowd,\r\nclimbed in. The driver, with a chuckle, bade the helpers let go, and\r\nthe coach swung cheerily away through the streets of Maidenhead, the\r\nmerry notes of the horn and the rattle of the pole-chains drowning the\r\ncries of the gutter-boys.\r\n\r\nThe little Frenchman turned round. “You vill have a refolution,” he\r\nsaid solemnly. “And the gentleman inside he vill lose his head.”\r\n\r\nThe coachman, who had hitherto looked askance at Froggy, as if he\r\ndisdained his neighbourhood, now squinted at him as if he could not\r\nquite make him out. “Think so?” he said gruffly. “Why, Mounseer?”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt,” the Frenchman answered glibly. “The people vill\r\nhave, and the nobles vill not give! Or they vill give a leetle—a\r\nleetle! And that is the worst of all. I have seen two refolutions!” he\r\ncontinued with energy. “The first when I was a child—it is forty years!\r\nMy bonne held me up and I saw heads fall into the basket—heads as young\r\nand as lofly as the young Mees there! And why? Because the people would\r\nhave, and the King, he give that which is the worst of all—a leetle!\r\nAnd the trouble began. And then the refolution of last year—it was\r\nworth to me all that I had! The people would have, and the Polignac,\r\nour Minister—who is the friend of your Vellington—he would not give at\r\nall! And the trouble began.”\r\n\r\nThe driver squinted at him anew. “D’you mean to say,” he asked, “that\r\nyou’ve seen heads cut off?”\r\n\r\n“I have seen the white necks, as white and as small as the Mees there;\r\nI have seen the blood spout from them; bah! like what you call pump!\r\nAh, it was ogly, it was very ogly!”\r\n\r\nThe coachman turned his head slowly and with difficulty, until he\r\ncommanded a full view of Vaughan’s pretty neighbour; at whom he gazed\r\nfor some seconds as if fascinated. Then he turned to his horses and\r\nrelieved his feelings by hitting one of the wheelers below the trace;\r\nwhile Vaughan, willing to hear what the Frenchman had to say, took up\r\nthe talk.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps here,” he said, “those who have will give, and give enough,\r\nand all will go well.”\r\n\r\n“Nefer! Nefer!” the Frenchman answered positively. “By example, the\r\nDuke whose château we pass—what you call it—Jerusalem House?”\r\n\r\n“Sion House,” Vaughan answered, smiling. “The Duke of Northumberland.”\r\n\r\n“By example he return four members to your Commons House. Is it not so?\r\nAnd they do what he tell them. He have this for his nefew, and that for\r\nhis niece, and the other thing for his _maître d’hôtel!_ And it is he\r\nand the others like him who rule the country! Gives he up all that? To\r\nthe _bourgeoisie?_ Nefer! Nefer!” he continued with emphasis. “He will\r\nbe the Polignac! They will all be the Polignacs! And you will have a\r\nrefolution. And by-and-by, when the _bourgeoisie_ is frightened of the\r\n_canaille_ and tired of the blood-letting, your Vellington he will be\r\nthe Emperor. It is as plain as the two eyes in the face! So plain for\r\nme, I shall not take off my clothes the nights!”\r\n\r\n“Well, King Billy for me!” said the driver. “But if he’s willing,\r\nMounseer, why shouldn’t the people manage their own affairs?”\r\n\r\n“The people! The people! They cannot! Your horses, will they govern\r\nthemselves? Will you throw down the reins and leave it to them, up\r\nhill, down hill? The people govern themselves Bah!” And to express his\r\nextreme disgust at the proposition, the Frenchman, who had lost his all\r\nwith Polignac, bent over the side and spat into the road. “It is no\r\ngovernment at all!”\r\n\r\nThe driver looked darkly at his horses as if he would like to see them\r\ntry it on. “I am afraid,” said Vaughan, “that you think we are in\r\ntrouble either way then, whether the Tories give or withhold?”\r\n\r\n“Eizer way! Eizer way!” the Frenchman answered _con amore_. “It is\r\nfate! You are on the edge of the what you call it—_chute!_ And you must\r\ngo over! We have gone over. We have bumped once, twice! We shall bump\r\nonce, twice more, _et voilà_—Anarchy! Now it is your turn, sir. The\r\ngovernment has to be—shifted—from the one class to the other!”\r\n\r\n“But it may be peacefully shifted?”\r\n\r\nThe little Frenchman shrugged his shoulders impatiently. “I have nefer\r\nseen the government shifted without all that that I have told you.\r\nThere will be the guillotine, or the barricades. For me, I shall not\r\ntake off my clothes the nights!”\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a sincerity so real and a persuasion so clear that even\r\nVaughan was a little shaken, and wondered if those who watched the game\r\nfrom the outside saw more than the players. As for the coachman:\r\n\r\n“Dang me,” he said that evening to his cronies in the tap of the White\r\nLion at Bristol, “if I feel so sure about this here Reform! We want\r\nnone of that nasty neck-cutting here! And if I thought Froggy was right\r\nI’m blest if I wouldn’t turn Tory!”\r\n\r\nAnd for certain the Frenchman voiced what a large section of the timid\r\nand the well-to-do were thinking. For something like a hundred and\r\nfifty years a small class, the nobility and the greater gentry, turning\r\nto advantage the growing defects in the representation—the rotten\r\nboroughs and the close corporations—had ruled the country through the\r\nHouse of Commons. Was it to be expected that the basis of power could\r\nbe shifted in a moment? Or that all these boroughs and corporations, in\r\nwhich the governing class were so deeply interested, could be swept\r\naway without a convulsion; without opening the floodgates of change,\r\nand admitting forces which no man could measure? Or, on the other side,\r\nwas it likely that, these defects once seen and the appetite of the\r\nmiddle class for power once whetted, their claims could be refused\r\nwithout a struggle from which the boldest must flinch? No man could say\r\nfor certain, and hence these fears in the air. The very winds carried\r\nthem. They were being discussed in that month of April not only on the\r\nWhite Lion coach, not on the Bath road only, but on a hundred coaches,\r\nand a hundred roads over the length and breadth of England. Wherever\r\nthe sway of Macadam and Telford extended, wherever the gigs of “riders”\r\nmet, or farmers’ carts stayed to parley, at fair and market, sessions\r\nand church, men shook their heads or raised their voices in high\r\ndebate; and the word _Reform_ rolled down the wind!\r\n\r\nVaughan soon overcame his qualms; for his opinions were fixed. But he\r\nthought that the subject might serve him with his neighbour, and he\r\naddressed her.\r\n\r\n“You must not let them alarm you,” he said. “We are still a long way, I\r\nfancy, from guillotines or barricades.”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” she answered. “In any case I am not afraid.”\r\n\r\n“Why, if I may ask?”\r\n\r\nShe glanced at him with a gleam of humour in her eyes. “Little shrubs\r\nfeel little wind,” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“But also little sun, I fear,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“That does not follow,” she said, without raising her eyes again.\r\n“Though it is true that I—I am so seldom free in a morning that a\r\njourney such as this, with the sunshine, is like heaven to me.”\r\n\r\n“The morning is a delightful time,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she cried, as if she now knew that he felt with her. “That is it!\r\nThe afternoon is different.”\r\n\r\n“Well, fortunately, you and I have—much of the morning left.”\r\n\r\nShe made no reply to that, and he wondered in silence what was the\r\nemployment which filled her mornings and fitted her to enjoy with so\r\nkeen a zest this early ride. The Gloucester up-coach was coming to meet\r\nthem, the guard tootling merrily on his horn, and a blue and yellow\r\nflag—the Whig colours—flying on the roof of the coach, which was\r\ncrowded with smiling passengers. Vaughan saw the girl’s eyes sparkle as\r\nthe two coaches passed one another amid a volley of badinage; and\r\ndemure as she was, he was sure that she had a store of fun within. He\r\nwished that she would remove her cheap thread gloves that he might see\r\nif her hands were as white as they were small. She was no common\r\nperson, he was sure of that; her speech was correct, though formal, and\r\nher manner was quiet and refined. And her eyes—he must make her look at\r\nhim again!\r\n\r\n“You are going to Bristol?” he said. “To stay there?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps he threw too much feeling into his voice. At any rate the tone\r\nof her answer was colder. “Yes,” she said, “I am.”\r\n\r\n“I am going as far as Chippenham,” he volunteered.\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\nThere! He had lost all the ground he had gained. She thought him a\r\npossible libertine, who aimed at putting himself on a footing of\r\nintimacy with her. And that was the last thing—confound it, he meant\r\nthat to do her harm was the last thing he had in his mind.\r\n\r\nIt annoyed him that she should think anything of that kind. And he\r\ncudgelled his brain for a subject at once safe and sympathetic, without\r\nfinding one. But either she was not so deeply offended as he fancied,\r\nor she thought him sufficiently punished. For presently she addressed\r\nhim; and he saw that she was ever so little embarrassed.\r\n\r\n“Would you please to tell me,” she said, in a low voice, “how much I\r\nought to give the coachman?”\r\n\r\nOh. bless her! She did not think him a horrid libertine. “You?” he said\r\naudaciously. “Why nothing, of course.”\r\n\r\n“But—but I thought it was usual?”\r\n\r\n“Not on this road,” he answered, lying resolutely. “Gentlemen are\r\nexpected to give half a crown, others a shilling. Ladies nothing at\r\nall. Sam,” he continued, rising to giddy heights of invention, “would\r\ngive it back to you, if you offered it.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” He fancied a note of relief in her tone, and judged that\r\nshillings were not very plentiful. Then, “Thank you,” she added. “You\r\nmust think me very ignorant. But I have never travelled.”\r\n\r\n“You must not say that,” he returned. “Remember the Clapham Stage!”\r\n\r\nShe laughed at the jest, small as it was; and her laugh gave him the\r\nmost delicious feeling—a sort of lightness within, half exhilaration,\r\nhalf excitement. And of a sudden, emboldened by it, he was grown so\r\nfoolhardy that there is no knowing what he would not have said, if the\r\nstreets of Reading had not begun to open before them and display a\r\nroadway abnormally thronged.\r\n\r\nFor Mr. Palmer’s procession, with its carriages, riders, and flags, was\r\nentering ahead of them; and the train of tipsy rabble which accompanied\r\nit blocked King Street, and presently brought the coach to a stand. The\r\ncandidate, lifting his cocked hat from time to time, was a hundred\r\npaces before them and barely visible through a forest of flags and\r\nbanners. But a troop of mounted gentry in dusty black, and smiling\r\ndames in carriages—who hardly masked the disgust with which they viewed\r\nthe forest of grimy hands extended to them to shake—were under the\r\ntravellers’ eyes, and showed in the sunlight both tawdry and false. Our\r\nparty, however, were not long at ease to enjoy the spectacle. The crowd\r\nsurrounded the coach, leapt on the steps, and hung on to the boot. And\r\npresently the noise scared the horses, which at the entrance to the\r\nmarketplace began to plunge.\r\n\r\n“The Bill! The Bill!” cried the rabble. And with truculence called on\r\nthe passengers to assent. “You lubbers,” they bawled, “shout for the\r\nBill! Or we’ll have you over!”\r\n\r\n“All right! All right!” replied Sammy, controlling his horses as well\r\nas he could. “We’re all for the Bill here! Hurrah!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Palmer for ever, Tories in the river!” cried the mob.\r\n“Hurrah!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah!” echoed the guard, willing to echo anything. “The Bill for\r\never! But let us pass, lads! Let us pass! We’re for the Bear, and we’ve\r\nno votes.”\r\n\r\n“Britons never will be slaves!” shrieked a drunken butcher as the\r\nmarketplace opened before them. The space was alive with flags and gay\r\nwith cockades, and thronged by a multitude, through which the\r\ncandidate’s procession clove its way slowly. “We’ll have votes now!\r\nThree cheers for Lord John!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Hurrah!”\r\n\r\n“And down with Orange Peel!” squeaked a small tailor in a high\r\nfalsetto.\r\n\r\nThe roar of laughter which greeted the sally startled the horses\r\nafresh. But the guard had dropped down by this time and fought his way\r\nto the head of one of the leaders; and two or three good-humoured\r\nfellows seconded his efforts. Between them the coach was piloted slowly\r\nbut safely through the press; which, to do it justice, meant only to\r\nexercise the privileges which the Election season brought with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\nROSY-FINGERED DAWN\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Beaucoup de bruit, pas de mal!_” Vaughan muttered in his neighbour’s\r\near; and saw with as much surprise as pleasure that she understood.\r\n\r\nAnd all would have gone well but for the imprudence of the inside\r\npassenger who had distinguished himself by his protest against the\r\nplacard. The coach was within a dozen paces of the Bear, the crowd was\r\nfalling back from it, the peril, if it had been real, seemed past, the\r\nmost timid was breathing again, when he thrust out his foolish head,\r\nand flung a taunt—which those on the roof could not hear—at the rabble.\r\n\r\nWhatever the words, their effect was disastrous. A bystander caught\r\nthem up and repeated them, and in a trice half-a-dozen louts flung\r\nthemselves on the door and strove to drag it open, and get at the man;\r\nwhile others, leaning over their shoulders, aimed missiles at the\r\ninside passengers.\r\n\r\nThe guard saw that more than the glass of his windows was at stake; but\r\nhe could do nothing. He was at the leaders’ heads. And the passengers\r\non the roof, who had risen to their feet to see the fray, were as\r\nhelpless. Luckily the coachman kept his head and his reins. “Turn ’em\r\ninto the yard!” he yelled. “Turn ’em in!”\r\n\r\nThe guard did so, almost too quickly. The frightened horses wheeled\r\nround, and, faster than was prudent, dashed under the low arch,\r\ndragging the swaying coach after them.\r\n\r\nThere was a cry of “Heads! Heads!” and then, more imperatively, “Heads!\r\nStoop! Stoop!”\r\n\r\nThe warning was needed. The outsides were on their feet engrossed in\r\nthe struggle at the coach door. And so quickly did the coach turn\r\nthat—though a score of spectators in the street and on the balcony of\r\nthe inn saw the peril—it was only at the last moment that Vaughan and\r\nthe two passengers at the back, men well used to the road, caught the\r\nwarning, and dropped down. And it was only at the very last moment that\r\nVaughan felt rather than saw that the girl was still standing. He had\r\njust time, by a desperate effort, and amid a cry of horror—for to the\r\nspectators she seemed to be already jammed between the arch and the\r\nseat—to drag her down. Instinctively, as he did so, he shielded her\r\nface with his arm; but the horror was so near that, as they swept under\r\nthe low brow, he was not sure that she was safe.\r\n\r\nHe was as white as she was, when they emerged into the light again. But\r\nhe saw that she was safe, though her bonnet was dragged from her head;\r\nand he cried unconsciously, “Thank God! Thank God!” Then, with that\r\nhatred of a scene which is part of the English character, he put her\r\nquickly back into her seat again, and rose to his feet, as if he wished\r\nto separate himself from her.\r\n\r\nBut a score of eyes had seen the act; and however much he might wish to\r\nspare her feelings, concealment was impossible.\r\n\r\n“Christ!” cried the coachman, whose copper cheeks were perceptibly\r\npaler. “If your head’s on your shoulders, Miss, it is to that young\r\ngentleman you owe it. Don’t you ever go to sleep on the roof of a coach\r\nagain! Never! Never!”\r\n\r\n“Here, get a drop of brandy!” cried the landlady, who, from one of the\r\ndoors flanking the archway, had seen all. “Do you stay where you are,\r\nMiss,” she continued, “and I’ll send it up to you.”\r\n\r\nThen amid a babel of exclamations and a chorus of blame and praise, the\r\nladder was brought, and Vaughan made haste to descend. A waiter tripped\r\nout with the brown brandy and water on a tray; and the young lady, who\r\nhad not spoken, but had remained, sitting white and still, where\r\nVaughan had placed her, sipped it obediently. Unfortunately the\r\nlandlady’s eyes were sharp; and as Vaughan passed her to go into the\r\nhouse—for the coach must be driven up the yard and turned before they\r\ncould set off again—she let fall a cry.\r\n\r\n“Lord, sir!” she said, “your hand is torn dreadful! You’ve grazed every\r\nbit of skin off it!”\r\n\r\nHe tried to silence her; and failing, hurried into the house. She\r\nfussed after him to attend to him; and Sammy, who was not a man of the\r\nmost delicate perceptions, seized the opportunity to drive home his\r\nformer lesson. “There, Miss,” he said solemnly, “I hope that’ll teach\r\nyou to look out another time! But better his hand than your head. You’d\r\nha’ been surely scalped!”\r\n\r\nThe girl, a shade whiter than before, did not answer. And he thought\r\nher, for so pretty a wench, “a right unfeelin’ un!”\r\n\r\nNot so the Frenchman. “I count him a very locky man!” he said\r\nobscurely. “A very locky man.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” the coachman answered with a grunt, “if you call that lucky——”\r\n\r\n“_Vraiment! Vraiment!_ But I—alas!” the Frenchman answered with an\r\neloquent gesture, “I have lost my all, and the good fortunes are no\r\nlonger for me!”\r\n\r\n“Fortunes!” the coachman muttered, looking askance at him. “A fine\r\nfortune, to have your hand flayed! But where’s”—recollecting\r\nhimself—“where’s that there fool that caused the trouble! D—n me, if he\r\nshall go any further on my coach. I’d like to double-thong him, and\r\nit’d serve him right!”\r\n\r\nSo when the ex-M.P. presently appeared, Sammy let go his tongue to such\r\npurpose that the political gentleman; finding himself in a minority of\r\none, retired into the house and, with many threats of what he would do\r\nwhen he saw the management, declined to go on.\r\n\r\n“And a good riddance of a d—d Tory!” the coachman muttered. “Think all\r\nthe world’s made for them! Fifteen minutes he’s cost us already! Take\r\nyour seats, gents, take your seats! I’m off!”\r\n\r\nVaughan, with his hand hastily bandaged, was the last to come out. He\r\nclimbed as quickly as he could to his place, and, without looking at\r\nhis neighbour, he said some common-place word. She did not reply, and\r\nthey swept under the arch. For a moment the sight of the thronged\r\nmarketplace diverted him. Then he looked at her, and he saw that she\r\nwas trembling.\r\n\r\nIf he was not quite so wise as the Frenchman, having had no _bonnes\r\nfortunes_ to speak of, he had, nevertheless, keen perceptions. And he\r\nguessed that the girl, between her maiden shyness and her womanly\r\ngratitude, was painfully placed. It could not be otherwise. A girl who\r\nhad spent her years, since childhood, within the walls of a school at\r\nClapham, first as genteel apprentice, and then as assistant; who had\r\nbeen taught to consider young men as roaring lions with whom her own\r\nlife could have nothing in common, and from whom it was her duty to\r\nguard the more giddy of her flock; who had to struggle at once with the\r\nshyness of youth, the modesty of her sex, and her inexperience—above\r\nall, perhaps with that dread of insult which becomes the instinct of\r\nlowly beauty—how was she to carry herself in circumstances so different\r\nfrom any which she had ever imagined? How was she to express a tithe of\r\nthe feelings with which her heart was bursting, and which overwhelmed\r\nher as often as she thought of the hideous death from which he had\r\nsnatched her?\r\n\r\nShe could not; and with inborn good taste she refrained from the\r\ncommonplace word, the bald acknowledgment, in which a shallow nature\r\nmight have taken refuge. On his side, he guessed some part of this, and\r\ndiscerned that if he would relieve her he must himself speak.\r\nAccordingly, when they had left the streets behind them and were\r\nswinging merrily along the Newbury Road, he leant towards her.\r\n\r\n“May I beg,” he said in a low voice, “that you won’t think of what has\r\nhappened? The coachman would have done as much, and scolded you! I\r\nhappened to be next you. That was all.”\r\n\r\nIn a strangled voice, “But your hand,” she faltered. “I fear—I——” She\r\nshuddered, unable to go on.\r\n\r\n“It is nothing!” he protested. “Nothing! In three days it will be\r\nwell!”\r\n\r\nShe turned her eves on him, eyes which possessed an eloquence of which\r\ntheir owner was unconscious. “I will pray for you,” she murmured. “I\r\ncan do no more.”\r\n\r\nThe pathos of her simple gratitude was such that Vaughan could not\r\nlaugh it off. “Thank you,” he said quietly. “We shall then be more than\r\nquits.” And having given her a few moments in which to recover herself,\r\n“We are nearly at Speenhamland,” he resumed cheerfully. “There is the\r\nGeorge and Pelican! It’s a great baiting-house for coaches. I am afraid\r\nto say how much corn and hay they give out in a day. They have a man\r\nwho does nothing else but weigh it out.” And so he chattered on, doing\r\nhis utmost to talk of indifferent matters in an indifferent tone.\r\n\r\nShe could not repulse him after what had passed. And now and then, by a\r\ntimid word, she gave him leave to talk. Presently he began to speak of\r\nthings other than those under their eyes, and when he thought that he\r\nhad put her at her ease, “You understand French?” he said looking at\r\nher suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I spoke it as a child,” she answered. “I was born abroad. I did not\r\ncome to England until I was nine.”\r\n\r\n“To Clapham?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. I have been employed in a school there.”\r\n\r\nPrudently he hastened to bring the talk back to the road again. And she\r\ntook courage to steal a look at him when his eyes were elsewhere. He\r\nseemed so strong and gentle and courteous; this unknown creature which\r\nshe had been taught to fear. And he was so thoughtful of her! He could\r\nthrow so tender a note into his voice. Beside d’Orsay or Alvanley—but\r\nshe had never heard of them—he might have passed muster but tolerably;\r\nbut to her he seemed a very fine gentleman. She had a woman’s eye for\r\nthe fineness of his linen, and the smartness of his waistcoat—had not\r\nSir James Graham, with his chest of Palermo stuffs, set the seal of\r\nCabinet approval on fancy waistcoats? Nor was she blind to the easy\r\ncarriage of his head, and his air of command.\r\n\r\nAnd there she caught herself up: reflecting with a blush that it was by\r\nthe easy path of thoughts such as these that the precipice was\r\napproached; that so it was the poor and pretty let themselves be led\r\nfrom the right road. Whither was she travelling? In what was this to\r\nend? She trembled. And if they had not at that moment swung out of\r\nSavernake Forest and sighted the red roofs of Marlborough, lying warm\r\nand sung at the foot of the steep London Hill, she did not know what\r\nshe should have done, since she could not repulse him.\r\n\r\nThey rattled in merry style through the town, the leaders cantering,\r\nthe bars swinging, the guard tootling, the sun shining; past a score of\r\ninn signs before which the heavy stages were baiting; past the two\r\nchurches, while all the brisk pleasantness of this new, this living\r\nworld, appealed to her to go its way. Ta-ra-ra! Ta-ra-ra! Swerving to\r\nthe right they pulled up bravely, with steaming horses, before the door\r\nof the far-famed Castle Inn. Ta-ra-ra! Ta-ra-ra! “Half an hour for\r\ndinner, gentlemen!”\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Vaughan, thinking that all was well, or rather declining to\r\nthink of anything but her shy glances and the delightful present. “You\r\nmust cut my meat for me!”\r\n\r\nShe did not reply, and he saw that her eyes went to the basket at her\r\nfeet. He guessed that she wished to avoid the expense of dining. “Or,\r\nperhaps, you are not coming in?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I did not intend to do so,” she replied. “I suppose,” she continued\r\ntimidly, “that I may stay here?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly. You have something with you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded pleasantly and left her; and she remained in her seat. As she\r\nate, the target for many a sly glance of admiration, she was divided\r\nbetween gratitude and self-reproach; now thinking of him with a\r\nquickened heart, now taking herself to task for her weakness. The\r\nresult was that when he strode out, confident and at ease, and looked\r\nup at her with laughing eyes, she blushed furiously—to her own\r\nunspeakable mortification.\r\n\r\nVaughan was no Lothario, and for a moment the telltale colour took him\r\naback. Then he told himself that at Chippenham, less than twenty miles\r\ndown the road, he was leaving her. It was absurd to suppose that, in\r\nthe short space which remained, either could be harmed. And he mounted\r\ngaily, and masking his knowledge of her emotion with a skill which\r\nsurprised himself, he chatted pleasantly, unaware that with every word\r\nhe was stamping the impression of her face, her long eyelashes, her\r\ngraceful head, her trick of this and that, more deeply upon his memory.\r\nWhile she, reassured by the same thought that they would part in an\r\nhour—and in an hour what harm could happen?—closed her eyes and drank\r\nthe sweet draught—the sweeter for its novelty, and for the bitter which\r\nlurked at the bottom of the cup. Meantime Sammy winked sagely at his\r\nhorses, and the Frenchman cast envious glances over his shoulders, and\r\nSilbury Hill, Fyfield, and the soft folds of the downs swept by, and on\r\nwarm commons and southern slopes the early bees hummed above the gorse.\r\n\r\nHere was Chippenham at last; and the end was come. He must descend. A\r\nhasty touch, a murmured word, a pang half-felt; she veiled her eyes. If\r\nher colour fluttered and she trembled, why not? She had cause to be\r\ngrateful to him. And if he felt as his foot touched the ground that the\r\nworld was cold, and the prospect cheerless, why not, when he had to\r\nface Sir Robert, and when his political embarrassments, forgotten for a\r\ntime, rose nearer and larger?\r\n\r\nIt had often fallen to him to alight before the Angel at Chippenhan.\r\nFrom boyhood he had known the wide street, in which the fairs were\r\nheld, the red Georgian houses, and the stone bridge of many arches over\r\nthe Avon. But he had never seen these things, he had never alighted\r\nthere, with less satisfaction than on this day.\r\n\r\nStill this was the end. He raised his hat, saluted silently, and turned\r\nto speak to the guard. In the act he jostled a person who was\r\napproaching to accost him. Vaughan stared. “Hallo, White!” he said. “I\r\nwas coming to see you.”\r\n\r\nWhite’s hat was in his hand. “Your servant, sir,” he said. “Your\r\nservant, sir. I am glad to be here to meet you, Mr. Vaughan.”\r\n\r\n“But you didn’t expect me?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, no; I came to meet Mr. Cooke, who was to arrive by this\r\ncoach. But I do not see him.”\r\n\r\nA light broke in upon Vaughan. “Gad! he must be the man we left behind\r\nat Reading,” he said. “Is he a peppery chap?”\r\n\r\n“He might be so called, sir,” the agent answered with a smile. “I\r\nfancied that you knew him.”\r\n\r\n“No. Sergeant Wathen I know; not Mr. Cooke. Any way, he’s not come,\r\nWhite.”\r\n\r\n“All the better, sir, if I can get a message to him by the up-coach.\r\nFor he’s not needed. I am glad to say that the trouble is at an end. My\r\nLord Lansdowne has given up the idea of contesting the borough, and I\r\ncame over to tell Mr. Cooke, thinking that he might prefer to go on to\r\nBristol. He has a house at Bristol.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean,” Vaughan said, “that there will be no contest?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, no. Not now. And a good thing, too. Upset the town for\r\nnothing! My lord has no chance, and Pybus, who is his lordship’s man\r\nhere, he told me himself——”\r\n\r\nHe paused with his mouth open, and his eyes on a tall lady wearing a\r\nveil, who, after standing a couple of minutes on the further side of\r\nthe street, was approaching the coach. To enter it she had to pass by\r\nhim, and he stared, as if he saw a ghost. “By Gosh!” he muttered under\r\nhis breath. And when, with the aid of the guard, she had taken her seat\r\ninside, “By Gosh!” he muttered again, “if that’s not my lady—though\r\nI’ve not seen her for ten years—I’ve the horrors!”\r\n\r\nHe turned to Vaughan to see if he had noticed anything. But Vaughan,\r\nwithout waiting for the end of his sentence, had stepped aside to tell\r\na helper to replace his valise on the coach. In the bustle he had noted\r\nneither White’s emotion nor the lady.\r\n\r\nAt this moment he returned. “I shall go on to Bristol for the night,\r\nWhite,” he said. “Sir Robert is quite well?”\r\n\r\n“Quite well, sir, and I shall be happy to tell him of your promptness\r\nin coming.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t tell him anything,” the young man said, with a flash of\r\nperemptoriness. “I don’t want to be kept here. Do you understand,\r\nWhite? I shall probably return to town to-morrow. Anyway, say nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” White answered. “But I am sure Sir Robert would be\r\npleased to know that you had come down so promptly.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, you can let him know later. Good-bye, White.”\r\n\r\nThe agent, with one eye on the young squire and one on the lady, whose\r\nfigure was visible through the small coach-window, seemed to be about\r\nto refer to her. But he checked himself. “Good-bye, sir,” he said. “And\r\na pleasant journey! I’m glad to have been of service, Mr. Vaughan.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, White, thank you,” the young man answered. And he swung\r\nhimself up, as the coach moved. A good-natured nod, and—Tantivy!\r\nTantivy! Tantivy! The helpers sprang aside, and away they went down the\r\nhill, and over the long stone bridge, and so along the Bristol road;\r\nbut now with the shades of evening beginning to spread on the pastures\r\nabout them, and the cawing rooks, that had been abroad all day on the\r\nuplands, streaming across the pale sky to the elms beside the river.\r\n\r\nBut _varium et mutabile femina_. When he turned, eager to take up the\r\nfallen thread, Clotho could not have been more cold than his neighbour,\r\nnor Atropos with her shears more decisive. “I’ve had good news,” he\r\nsaid, as he settled his coat about him. “I came down with a very\r\nunpleasant task before me. And it is lifted from me.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed!”\r\n\r\n“So I am going on to Bristol instead of staying at Chippenham.”\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n“It is a great relief to me,” he continued cheerfully.\r\n\r\n“Indeed!” She spoke in the most distant of voices.\r\n\r\nHe raised his brows in perplexity. What had happened to her? She had\r\nbeen so grateful, so much moved, a few minutes before. The colour had\r\nfluttered in her cheek, the tear had been visible in her eye, she had\r\nleft her hand the fifth of a second in his. And now!\r\n\r\nNow she was determined that she would blush and smile and be kind no\r\nmore. She was grateful—God knew she was grateful, let him think what he\r\nwould. But there were limits. Her weakness, as long as she believed\r\nthat Chippenham must part them, had been pardonable. But if he had it\r\nin his mind to attend her to Bristol, to follow her or haunt her—as she\r\nhad known foolish young cits at Clapham to haunt the more giddy of her\r\nflock—then her mistake was clear; and his conduct, now merely\r\nsuspicious, would appear in its black reality. She hoped that he was\r\ninnocent. She hoped that his change of plan at Chippenham had been no\r\nsubterfuge; that he was not a roaring lion. But appearances were\r\ndeceitful and her own course was plain.\r\n\r\nIt was the plainer, as she had not been blind to the respect with which\r\nall at the Angel had greeted her companion; even White, a man of\r\nsubstance, with a gold chain and seals hanging from his fob, had stood\r\nbareheaded while he talked to him. It was plain that he was a fine\r\ngentleman; one of those whom young persons in her rank of life must\r\nshun.\r\n\r\nSo he drew scarcely five words out of her in as many miles. At last,\r\nthrice rebuffed, “I am afraid you are tired,” he said. Was it for this\r\nthat he had chosen to go on to Bristol?\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered. “I am rather tired. If you please I would prefer\r\nnot to talk.”\r\n\r\nHe was a little huffed then, and let her be; nor did he guess, though\r\nhe was full of conjectures about her, how she hated her seeming\r\ningratitude. But there was nought else for it; better seem thankless\r\nnow than be worse hereafter. For she was growing frightened. She was\r\nbeginning to have more than an inkling of the road by which young\r\nthings were led to be foolish. Her ear retained the sound of his voice\r\nthough he was silent. The fashion in which he had stooped to her—though\r\nhe was looking another way now—clung to her memory. His laugh, though\r\nhe was grave now, rang for her, full of glee and good-fellowship. She\r\ncould have burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThey stayed at Marshfield to take on the last team. And she tried to\r\ndivert her mind by watching a woman in a veil who walked up and down\r\nbeside the coach, and seemed to return her curiosity. But she tried to\r\nlittle purpose, for she felt strained and weary, and more than ever\r\ninclined to cry. Doubtless the peril through which she had passed had\r\nshaken her.\r\n\r\nSo that she was thankful when, after descending perilous Tog Hill, they\r\nsaw from Kingswood heights the lights of Bristol shining through the\r\ndusk; and she knew that she was at her journey’s end. To arrive in a\r\nstrange place on the edge of night is trying to anyone. But to alight\r\nfriendless and alone, amid the bustle of a city, and to know that new\r\nrelations must be created and a new life built up—this may well raise\r\nin the most humble and contented bosom a feeling of loneliness and\r\ndepression. And doubtless that was why Mary Smith, after evading\r\nVaughan with a success beyond her hopes, felt as she followed her\r\nmodest trunk through the streets that—but she bent her head to hide the\r\nunaccustomed tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\nTHE PATRON OF CHIPPINGE\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch about the time that the “Spectator” was painting in Sir Roger the\r\nmost lovable picture of an old English squire which our gallery\r\ncontains, Cornelius Vermuyden, of a younger branch of the Vermuydens\r\nwho drained the fens, was making a fortune in the Jamaica trade. Having\r\nmade it in a dark office at Bristol, and being, like all Dutchmen, of a\r\nsedentary turn, he proceeded to found a family, purchase a borough,\r\nand, by steady support of Whig principles and the Protestant\r\nsuccession, to earn a baronetcy in the neighbouring county of Wilts.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the first Vermuyden had things to contend with, and at assize\r\nball and sessions got but two fingers from the De Coverleys and their\r\nlong-descended dames. But he went his way stolidly, married his son\r\ninto a family of like origin—the Beckfords—and, having seen little\r\nGeorge II. firmly on the throne, made way for his son.\r\n\r\nThis second Sir Cornelius rebuilt Stapylton, the house which his father\r\nhad bought from the decayed family of that name, and after living for\r\nsome ten years into the reign of Farmer George, vanished in his turn,\r\nleaving Cornelius Robert to succeed him, Cornelius George, the elder\r\nson, having died in his father’s lifetime.\r\n\r\nSir Cornelius Robert was something after the pattern of the famous Mr.\r\nOnslow—\r\n\r\n_What can Tommy Onslow do?\r\nHe can drive a chaise and two.\r\nWhat can Tommy Onslow more?\r\nHe can drive a chaise and four._\r\n\r\n\r\nYet he fitted the time, and, improving his father’s pack of\r\ntrencher-fed hounds by a strain of Mr. Warde’s blood, he hunted the\r\ncountry so conscientiously that at his death a Dutch bottle might have\r\nbeen set upon his table without giving rise to the slightest\r\nreflection. He came to an end, much lamented, with the century, and Sir\r\nRobert, fourth and present baronet, took over the estates.\r\n\r\nBy that time, rid of the foreign prenomen, well allied by three good\r\nmarriages, and since the American war of true blue Tory leanings, and\r\nthorough Church and King principles, the family was able to hold up its\r\nhead among the best in the south of England. There might be some who\r\nstill remembered that—\r\n\r\n_Saltash was a borough town\r\nWhen Plymouth was a breezy down_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the property was good, the borough safe, and any time these twenty\r\nyears their owner might have franked his letters “Chippinge” had he\r\nwilled it. As it was, he passed, almost as much as Mr. Western in the\r\neast or Sir Thomas Acland in the west, for the type of a country\r\ngentleman. The most powerful Minister gave him his whole hand; and at\r\ncounty meetings, at Salisbury or Devizes, no voice was held more\r\npowerful, nor any man’s hint more quickly taken than Sir Robert\r\nVermuyden’s.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall and very thin man, of almost noble aspect, with a nose\r\nafter the fashion of the Duke’s, and a slight stoop. In early days he\r\nhad been something of a beau, though never of the Prince’s following,\r\nand he still dressed finely and with taste. With a smaller sense of\r\npersonal dignity, or with wider sympathies, he might have been a\r\nhappier man. But he had married too late—at forty-five; and the four\r\nyears which followed, and their sequel, had darkened the rest of his\r\nlife, drawn crow’s-feet about his eyes and peevish lines about his\r\nmouth. Henceforth he had lived alone, nursing his pride; and the\r\nsolitude of this life—which was not without its dignity, since no word\r\nof scandal touched it—had left him narrow and vindictive, a man just\r\nbut not over-generous, and pompous without complacency.\r\n\r\nThe neighbourhood knew that he and Lady Sybil—he had married the\r\nbeautiful daughter of the last Earl of Portrush—had parted under\r\ncircumstances which came near to justifying divorce. Some held that he\r\nhad divorced her; but in those days an Act of Parliament was necessary,\r\nand no such Act stood on the Statute-book. Many thought that he ought\r\nto have divorced her. And while the people who knew that she still\r\nlived and still plagued him were numerous, few save Isaac White were\r\naware that it was because his marriage had been made and marred at\r\nBowood—and not purely out of principle—that Sir Robert opposed the very\r\nname of Lansdowne, and would have wasted a half of his fortune to wreck\r\nhis great neighbour’s political power.\r\n\r\nNot that his Tory principles were not strong. During five Parliaments\r\nhe had filled one of his own seats, and had spoken from time to time\r\nafter a dignified fashion, with formal gestures and a copious\r\nsprinkling of classical allusions. The Liberal Toryism of Canning had\r\nfallen below his ideal, but he had continued to sit until the betrayal\r\nof the party by Peel and the Duke—on the Catholic Claims—drove him from\r\nthe House in disgust, and thenceforth Warren’s Hotel, his residence\r\nwhen in town, saw him but seldom. He had fancied then that nothing\r\nworse could happen; that the depths were plumbed, and that he and those\r\nwho thought with him might punish the traitor and take no harm. With\r\nthe Duke of Cumberland, the best hated man in England—which was never\r\ntired of ridiculing his moustachios—Eldon, Wetherell, and the\r\nultra-Tories, he had not rested until he had seen the hated pair flung\r\nfrom office; nor was any man more surprised and confounded when the\r\nresult of the work began to show itself. The Whigs, admitted to power\r\nby this factious movement, and after an exile so long that Byron could\r\nwrite of them—\r\n\r\n_Naught’s permanent among the human race\r\nExcept the Whigs not getting into place_\r\n\r\n\r\n—brought in no mild and harmless measure of reform, promising little\r\nand giving nothing, such as foe and friend had alike expected; but a\r\nmeasure of reform so radical that O’Connell blessed it, and Cobbett\r\nmight have fathered it: a measure which, if it passed, would sweep away\r\nSir Robert’s power and the power of his class, destroy his borough, and\r\nrelegate him to the common order of country squires.\r\n\r\nHe was at first incredulous, then furious, then aghast. To him the Bill\r\nwas not only the doom of his own influence but the knell of the\r\nConstitution. Behind it he saw red revolution and the crash of things.\r\nLord Grey was to him Mirabeau, Lord John was Lafayette, Brougham was\r\nDanton; and of them and of their kind, when they had roused the\r\nmany-headed, he was sure that the end would be as the end of the\r\nGironde.\r\n\r\nHe was not the less furious, not the less aghast, when the moderates of\r\nhis party pointed out that he had himself to thank for the catastrophe.\r\nFrom the refusal to grant the smallest reform, from the refusal to\r\ntransfer the franchise of the rotten borough of Retford to the\r\nunrepresented city of Birmingham—a refusal which he had urged his\r\nmembers to support—the chain was complete; for in consequence of that\r\nrefusal Mr. Huskisson had left the Duke’s Cabinet. The appointment of\r\nMr. Fitzgerald to fill his seat had rendered the Clare election\r\nnecessary. O’Connell’s victory at the Clare election had converted Peel\r\nand the Duke to the necessity of granting the Catholic Claims. That\r\nconversion had alienated the ultra-Tories, and among these Sir Robert.\r\nThe opposition of the ultra-Tories had expelled Peel and the Duke from\r\npower—which had brought in the Whigs—who had brought in the Reform\r\nBill.\r\n\r\n_Hinc illæ lacrimæ!_ For, in place of the transfer of the franchise of\r\none rotten borough to one large city—a reform which now to the most\r\nbigoted seemed absurdly reasonable—here were sixty boroughs to be swept\r\naway, and nearly fifty more to be shorn of half their strength, a\r\nConstitution to be altered, an aristocracy to be dethroned!\r\n\r\nAnd Calne, Lord Lansdowne’s pocket borough, was spared!\r\n\r\nSir Robert firmly believed that the limit had been fixed with an eye to\r\nCalne. They who framed the Bill, sitting in wicked, detestable\r\nconfabulation, had fixed the limit of Schedule B so as to spare Calne\r\nand Tavistock—_Arcades ambo_, Whig boroughs both. Or why did they just\r\nescape? In the whole matter it was this, strangely enough, which\r\ntroubled him most sorely. For the loss of his own borough—if the worst\r\ncame to the worst—he could put up with it. He had no children, he had\r\nno one to come after him except Arthur Vaughan, the great-grandson of\r\nhis grandmother. But the escape of Calne, this clear proof of the\r\nhypocrisy of the righteous Grey, the blatant Durham, the whey-faced\r\nLord John, the demagogue Brougham—this injustice kept him in a state of\r\ncontinual irritation.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of this as he paced slowly up and down the broad walk\r\nbeside the Garden Pool, at Stapylton—a solitary figure dwarfed by the\r\ngreat elms. The placid surface of the pool, which mirrored the shaven\r\nlawns beyond it and the hoary church set amidst the lawns, the silence\r\nabout him, broken only by the notes of song-birds or a faint yelp from\r\nthe distant kennels, the view over the green undulations of park and\r\ncovert—all vainly appealed to him to-day, though on summer evenings his\r\nheart took sad and frequent leave of them. For that which threatened\r\nhim every day jostled aside for the present that which must happen one\r\nday. The home of his fathers might be his for some years yet, but shorn\r\nof its chief dignity, of its pride, its mastery; while Calne—Calne\r\nwould survive, to lift still higher the fortunes of those who had sold\r\ntheir king and country, and betrayed their order.\r\n\r\nDaily a man and horse awaited the mail-coach at Chippenham that he\r\nmight have the latest news; and, seeing a footman hurrying towards him\r\nfrom the house, he supposed that the mail was in. But when the man,\r\nafter crossing the long wooden bridge which spanned the pool,\r\napproached with no diminution of speed, he remembered that it was too\r\nearly for the post; and hating to be disturbed in his solitary\r\nreveries, he awaited the servant impatiently.\r\n\r\n“What it is?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“If you please, Sir Robert, Lady Lansdowne’s carriage is at the door.”\r\n\r\nOnly Sir Robert’s darkening colour betrayed his astonishment. He had\r\nmade his feelings so well known that none but the most formal\r\ncivilities now passed between Stapylton and Bowood.\r\n\r\n“Who is it?”\r\n\r\n“Lady Lansdowne, Sir Robert. Her ladyship bade us say that she wishes\r\nto see you urgently, sir.” The man, as well as the master, knew that\r\nthe visit was unusual.\r\n\r\nThe baronet was a proud man, and he bethought him that the\r\ndrawing-rooms, seldom used and something neglected, were not in the\r\nstate in which he would wish his enemy’s wife to see them. “Where have\r\nyou put her ladyship?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“In the hall, Sir Robert.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. I will come.”\r\n\r\nThe man hastened away over the bridge, and Sir Robert followed, more at\r\nleisure, but still quickly. When he had passed the angle of the church\r\nwhich stood in a line with the three blocks of building, connected by\r\nporticos, which formed the house, and which, placed on a gentle\r\neminence, looked handsomely over the park, he saw that a carriage with\r\nfour greys ridden by postillions and attended by two outriders stood\r\nbefore the main door. In the carriage, her face shaded by the large\r\nTuscan hat of the period, sat a young lady reading. She heard Sir\r\nRobert’s footstep, and looked up, and in some embarrassment met his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe removed his hat. “It is Lady Louisa, is it not?” he said, looking\r\ngravely at her.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said; and she smiled prettily at him.\r\n\r\n“Will you not go into the house?”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” she replied, with a faint blush; “I think my mother wishes\r\nto see you alone, Sir Robert.”\r\n\r\n“Very good.” And with a bow, cold but perfectly courteous, he turned\r\nand passed up the broad, shallow steps, which were of the same\r\ntime-tinted lichen-covered stone as the rest of the building. Mapp, the\r\nbutler, who had been looking out for him, opened the door, and he\r\nentered the hall.\r\n\r\nIn his heart, which was secretly perturbed, was room for the wish that\r\nhe had been found in other than the high-buttoned gaiters and breeches\r\nof his country life. But he suffered no sign of that or of his more\r\nserious misgivings to appear, as he advanced to greet the still\r\nbeautiful woman, who sat daintily warming one sandalled foot at the red\r\nembers on the hearth. She was far from being at ease herself. Warnings\r\nwhich her husband had addressed to her at parting recurred and\r\ndisturbed her. But it is seldom that a woman of the world betrays her\r\nfeelings, and her manner was perfect as he bent low over her hand.\r\n\r\n“It is long,” she said gently, “much longer than I like to remember,\r\nSir Robert, since we met.”\r\n\r\n“It is a long time,” he answered gravely; and when she had reseated\r\nherself he sat down opposite her.\r\n\r\n“It is an age,” she said slowly; and she looked round the hall, with\r\nits panelled walls, its deep window-seats, and its panoply of fox-masks\r\nand antlers, as if she recalled the past, “It is an age,” she repeated.\r\n“Politics are sad dividers of friends.”\r\n\r\n“I fear,” he replied, in a tone as cold as courtesy permitted, “that\r\nthey are about to be greater dividers.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him quickly, with appeal in her eyes. “And yet,” she\r\nsaid, “we saw more of you once.”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” He was wondering much, behind the mask of his civility, what had\r\ndrawn her hither. He knew that it could be no light, no passing matter\r\nwhich had brought her over thirteen miles of Wiltshire roads to call\r\nupon a man with whom intercourse had been limited, for years past, to a\r\nfew annual words, a formal invitation as formally declined, a measured\r\nsalutation at race or ball. She must have a motive, and a strong one.\r\nIt was only the day before that he had learned that Lord Lansdowne\r\nmeant to drop his foolish opposition at Chippinge; was it possible that\r\nshe was here to make a favour of this? And perhaps a bargain? If that\r\nwere her errand, and my lord had sent her, thinking to make refusal\r\nless easy, Sir Robert felt that he would know how to answer. He waited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\nTHE WINDS OF AUTUMN\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne looked pensively at the tapering sandal which she held\r\nforward to catch the heat. “Time passes so very, very quickly,” she\r\nsaid with a sigh.\r\n\r\n“With some,” Sir Robert answered. “With others,” he bowed, “it stands\r\nstill.”\r\n\r\nHis gallantry did not deceive her. She knew it for the salute which\r\nduellists exchange before the fray, and she saw that if she would do\r\nanything she must place herself within his guard. She looked at him\r\nwith sudden frankness. “I want you to bear with me for a few minutes,\r\nSir Robert,” she said in a tone of appeal. “I want you to remember that\r\nwe were once friends, and, for the sake of old days, to believe that I\r\nam here to play a friend’s part. You won’t answer me? Very well. I do\r\nnot ask you to answer me.” She pointed to the space above the mantel.\r\n“The portrait which used to hang there?” she said. “Where is it? What\r\nhave you done with it? But there, I said I would not ask, and I am\r\nasking!”\r\n\r\n“And I will answer!” he replied. This was the last, the very last thing\r\nfor which he had looked; but he would show her that he was not to be\r\noverridden. “I will tell you,” he repeated. “Lady Lansdowne, I have\r\ndestroyed it.”\r\n\r\n“I do not blame you,” she rejoined. “It was yours to do with as you\r\nwould. But the original—no, Sir Robert,” she said, staying him\r\nintrepidly—she had taken the water now, and must swim—“you shall not\r\nfrighten me! She was, she is your wife. But not yours, not your\r\nproperty to do with as you will, in the sense in which that picture—but\r\nthere, I am blaming where I should entreat. I——”\r\n\r\nHe stayed her by a peremptory gesture. “Are you here—from her?” he\r\nasked huskily.\r\n\r\n“I am not.”\r\n\r\n“She knows?”\r\n\r\n“No, Sir Robert, she does not.”\r\n\r\n“Then why,”—there was pain, real pain mingled with the indignation in\r\nhis tone—“why, in God’s name, Madam, have you come?”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with pitying eyes. “Because,” she said, “so many\r\nyears have passed, and if I do not say a word now I shall never say it.\r\nAnd because—there is still time, but no more than time.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her fixedly. “You have another reason,” he said. “What is\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“I saw her yesterday. I was in Chippenham when the Bristol coach\r\npassed, and I saw her face for an instant at the window.”\r\n\r\nHe breathed more quickly; it was evident that the news touched him\r\nhome. But he would not blench nor lower his eyes. “Well?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I saw her for a few seconds only, and she did not see me. And of\r\ncourse—I did not speak to her. But I knew her face, though she was\r\nchanged.”\r\n\r\n“And because”—his voice was harsh—“you saw her for a few minutes at a\r\nwindow, you come to me?”\r\n\r\n“No, but because her face called up the old times. And because we are\r\nall growing older. And because she was—not guilty.”\r\n\r\nHe started. This was getting within his guard with a vengeance. “Not\r\nguilty?” he cried in a tone of extreme anger. And he rose. But as she\r\ndid not move he sat down again.\r\n\r\n“No,” she replied firmly. “She was not guilty.”\r\n\r\nHis face was deeply red. For a moment he looked at her as if he would\r\nnot answer her, or, if he answered, would bid her leave his house.\r\nThen, “If she had been,” he said grimly, “guilty, Madam, in the sense\r\nin which you use the word, guilty of the worst, she had ceased to be my\r\nwife these fifteen years, she had ceased to bear my name, ceased to be\r\nthe curse of my life!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no!”\r\n\r\n“It is yes, yes!” And his face was dark. “But as it was, she was guilty\r\nenough! For years”—he spoke more rapidly as his passion grew—“she made\r\nher name a byword and dragged mine in the dirt. She made me a\r\nlaughing-stock and herself a scandal. She disobeyed me—but what was her\r\nwhole life with me, Lady Lansdowne, but one long disobedience? When she\r\npublished that light, that foolish book, and dedicated it to—to that\r\nperson—a book which no modest wife should have written, was not her\r\nmain motive to harass and degrade me? Me, her husband? While we were\r\ntogether was not her conduct from the first one long defiance, one long\r\nharassment of me? Did a day pass in which she did not humiliate me by a\r\nhundred tricks, belittle me by a hundred slights, ape me before those\r\nwhom she should not have stooped to know, invite in a thousand ways the\r\napplause of the fops she drew round her? And when”—he rose, and paced\r\nthe room—“when, tried beyond patience by what I heard, I sent to her at\r\nFlorence and bade her return to me, and cease to make herself a scandal\r\nwith that person, or my house should no longer be her home, she\r\ndisobeyed me flagrantly, wilfully, and at a price she knew! She went\r\nout of her way to follow him to Rome, she flaunted herself in his\r\ncompany, ay, and flaunted herself in such guise as no Englishwoman had\r\nbeen known to wear before! And after that—after that——”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, proud as he was, mastered by his feelings; she had got\r\nwithin his guard indeed. For a while he could not go on. And she,\r\npicturing the old days which his passionate words brought back, days\r\nwhen her children had been infants, saw, as it had been yesterday, the\r\nyoung bride, beautiful as a rosebud and wild and skittish as an Irish\r\ncolt—and the husband staid, dignified, middle-aged, as little in\r\nsympathy with his captive’s random acts and flighty words as if he had\r\nspoken another tongue.\r\n\r\nThus yoked, and resisting the lightest rein, the young wife had shown\r\nherself capable of an infinity of folly. Egged on by the plaudits of a\r\ncircle of admirers, she had now made her husband ridiculous by childish\r\nfamiliarities: and again, when he found fault with these, by airs of\r\npublic offence, which covered him with derision. But beauty’s sins are\r\nsoon forgiven; and fretting and fuming, and leading a wretched life, he\r\nhad yet borne with her, until something which she chose to call a\r\npassion took possession of her. “The Giaour” and “The Corsair” were all\r\nthe rage that year; and with the publicity with which she did\r\neverything she flung herself at the head of her soul’s affinity; a\r\nfamous person, half poet, half dandy, who was staying at Bowood.\r\n\r\nThe world which knew her decided that the affair was more worthy of\r\nlaughter than of censure, and laughed immoderately. But to the\r\nhusband—the humour of husbands is undeveloped—it was terrible. She\r\nwrote verses to the gentleman, and he to her; and she published, with\r\ningenuous pride, the one and the other. Possibly this or the laughter\r\ndetermined the admirer. He fled, playing the innocent Æneas; and her\r\nlamentations, crystallising in the shape of a silly romance which made\r\nshop-girls weep and great ladies laugh, caused a separation between the\r\nhusband and wife. Before this had lasted many months the illness of\r\ntheir only child brought them together again; and when, a little later,\r\nthe doctors advised a southern climate, Sir Robert reluctantly\r\nentrusted the girl to her. She went abroad with the child, and the\r\nparents never met again.\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne, recalling the story, could have laughed with her mind\r\nand wept with her heart; scenes so absurd under the leafy shades of\r\nBowood or Lacock jostled the tragedy; and the ludicrous—with the\r\nhusband an unwilling actor in it—so completely relieved the pathetic!\r\nBut her bent towards laughter was short. Sir Robert, unable to bear her\r\neyes, had turned away; and she must say something.\r\n\r\n“Think,” she said gently, “how young she was!”\r\n\r\n“I have thought of it a thousand times!” he retorted. “Do you suppose,”\r\nturning on her with harshness, “that there is a day on which I do not\r\nthink of it!”\r\n\r\n“So young!”\r\n\r\n“She had been three years a mother!”\r\n\r\n“For the dead child’s sake, then,” she pleaded with him, “if not for\r\nhers.”\r\n\r\n“Lady Lansdowne!” There were both anger and pain in his voice as he\r\nhalted and stood before her. “Why do you come to me? Why do you trouble\r\nme? Why? Is it because you feel yourself—responsible? Because you know,\r\nbecause you feel, that but for you my home had not been left to me\r\ndesolate? Nor a foolish life been ruined?”\r\n\r\n“God forbid!” she said solemnly. And in her turn she rose in agitation;\r\nmoved for once out of the gracious ease and self-possession of her\r\nlife, so that in the contrast there was something unexpected and\r\ntouching. “God forbid!” she repeated. “But because I feel that I might\r\nhave done more. Because I feel that a word from me might have checked\r\nher, and it was not spoken. True, I was young, and it might have made\r\nthings worse—I do not know. But when I saw her face at the window\r\nyesterday—and she was changed, Sir Robert—I felt that I might have been\r\nin her place, and she in mine!” Her voice trembled. “I might have been\r\nlonely, childless, growing old; and alone! Or again, if I had done\r\nsomething, if I had spoken as I would have another speak, were the case\r\nmy girl’s, she might have been as I am! Now,” she added tremulously,\r\n“you know why I came. Why I plead for her! In our world we grow hard,\r\nvery hard; but there are things which touch us still, and her face\r\ntouched me yesterday—I remembered what she was.” She paused a moment,\r\nand then, “After long years,” she continued softly, “it cannot be hard\r\nto forgive; and there is still time. She did nothing that need close\r\nyour door, and what she did is forgotten. Grant that she was foolish,\r\ngrant that she was wild, indiscreet, what you will—she is alone now,\r\nalone and growing old, Sir Robert, and if not for her sake, for the\r\nsake of your dead child——”\r\n\r\nHe stopped her by a peremptory gesture, but for the moment he seemed\r\nunable to speak. At length, “You touch the wrong chord,” he said\r\nhoarsely. “It is for the sake of my dead child I shall never, never\r\nforgive her! She knew that I loved it. She knew that it was all to me.\r\nIt grew worse! Did she tell me? It was in danger; did she warn me? No!\r\nBut when I heard of her disobedience, of her folly, of things which\r\nmade her a byword, and I bade her return, or my house should no longer\r\nbe her home, then, then she flung the news of the child’s death at me,\r\nand rejoiced that she had it to fling. Had I gone out then and found\r\nher in the midst of her wicked gaiety, God knows what I should have\r\ndone! I did try to go. But the Hundred Days had begun, I had to return.\r\nHad I gone, and learned that in her mad infatuation she had neglected\r\nthe child, left it to servants, let it fade, I think—I think, Madam, I\r\nshould have killed her!”\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne raised her hands. “Hush! Hush!” she said.\r\n\r\n“I loved the child. Therefore she was glad when it died, glad that she\r\nhad the power to wound me. Its death was no more to her than a weapon\r\nwith which to punish me! There was a tone in her letter—I have it\r\nstill—which betrayed that. And, therefore—therefore, for the child’s\r\nsake, I will never forgive her!”\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” she murmured in a voice which acknowledged defeat. “I am\r\nvery sorry.”\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment gazing at the blank space above the fireplace;\r\nhis head sunk, his shoulders brought forward. He looked years older\r\nthan the man who had walked under the elms. At length he made an effort\r\nto speak in his usual tone. “Yes,” he said, “it is a sorry business.”\r\n\r\n“And I,” she said slowly, “can do nothing.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” he replied. “Time will cure this, and all things.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure that there is no mistake?” she pleaded. “That you are not\r\njudging her harshly?”\r\n\r\n“There is no mistake.”\r\n\r\nThen she saw the hopelessness of argument and held out her hand.\r\n\r\n“Forgive me,” she said simply. “I have given you pain, and for nothing.\r\nBut the old days were so strong upon me—after I saw her—that I could\r\nnot but come. Think of me at least as a friend, and forgive me.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed low over her hand, but he gave her no assurance. And seeing\r\nthat he was mastering his agitation, and fearing that if he had leisure\r\nto think he might resent her interference, she wasted no time in\r\nadieux. She glanced round the well-remembered hall—the hall once smart,\r\nnow shabby—in which she had seen the flighty girl play many a mad\r\nprank. Then she turned sorrowfully to the door, more than suspecting\r\nthat she would never pass through it again.\r\n\r\nHe had rung the bell, and Mapp, the butler, and the two men were in\r\nattendance. But he handed her to the carriage himself, and placed her\r\nin it with old-fashioned courtesy, and with the same scrupulous\r\nobservance stood bareheaded until it moved away. None the less, his\r\nface by its set expression betrayed the nature of the interview; and\r\nthe carriage had scarcely swept clear of the grounds and entered the\r\npark when Lady Louisa turned to her mother.\r\n\r\n“Was he very angry?” she asked, eager to be instructed in the mysteries\r\nof that life which she was entering.\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne essayed to snub her. “My dear,” she said, “it is not a\r\nfit subject for you.”\r\n\r\n“Still, mother dear, you might tell me. You told me something, and it\r\nis not fair to turn yourself into Mrs. Fairchild in a moment. Besides,\r\nwhile you were with him I came on a passage so beautiful, and so pat,\r\nit almost made me cry.”\r\n\r\n“My dear, don’t say ‘pat,’ say ‘apposite.’”\r\n\r\n“Then apposite, mother,” Lady Louisa answered. “Do you read it. There\r\nit is.”\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne sniffed, but suffered the book to be put into her hand.\r\nLady Louisa pointed with enthusiasm to a line. “Is it a case like that,\r\nmother?” she asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n_But never either found another\r\nTo free the hollow heart from paining.\r\nThey stood aloof, the scars remaining,\r\nLike cliffs which had been rent asunder.\r\nA dreary sea now flows between,\r\nBut neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,\r\nShall wholly do away, I ween,\r\nThe marks of that which once hath been_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother handed the book back to the daughter without looking at her.\r\n“No,” she said; “I don’t think it is a case like that.”\r\n\r\nBut a moment later she wiped her eyes furtively, and then she told her\r\ndaughter more, it is to be feared, than Mrs. Fairchild would have\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSir Robert, when they were gone, went heavily to the library, a\r\npanelled room looking to the back, in which it was his custom to sit.\r\nFor many years he had passed some hours of every day, when he was at\r\nhome, in that room; and until now it had never occurred to his mind\r\nthat it was dull or shabby. But it was old Mapp’s habit to lower the\r\nblinds for his master’s after-luncheon nap, and they were still down;\r\nand the half light which filtered in was like the sheet which rather\r\naccentuates than hides the sharp features of the dead. The faded\r\nengravings and the calf-bound books which masked the walls, the\r\nescritoire, handsome and massive, but stained with ink and strewn with\r\ndog’s eared accounts, the leathern-covered chair long worn out of shape\r\nby his weight, the table beside it with yesterday’s “Standard,” two or\r\nthree volumes of the “Anti-Jacobin,” and the “Quarterly,” a month old\r\nand dusty—all to his opened eyes wore a changed aspect. They spoke of\r\nthe slow decay of years, unchecked by a woman’s eye, a woman’s hand.\r\nThey told of the slow degradation of his lonely life. They indicated a\r\nlike change in himself.\r\n\r\nHe stood a few moments on the hearth, looking about him with a shocked,\r\npained face. The months and the years had passed irrevocably, while he\r\nsat in that chair, poring in a kind of lethargy over those books,\r\nworking industriously at those accounts. Asked, he had answered that he\r\nwas growing old, and grown old. But he had never for a moment\r\ncomprehended, as he comprehended now, that he was old. He had never\r\nmeasured the difference between this and that; between those days\r\ntroubled by a hundred annoyances, vexations, cares, when in spite of\r\nall he had lived, and these days of sullen stagnancy and mere\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nHe found the room, he found the reflection, intolerable. And he went\r\nout, took with an unsteady hand his garden hat and returned to that\r\nbroad walk under the elms beside the pool which was his favourite\r\nlounge. Perhaps he fancied that the wonted scene would deaden the pain\r\nof memory and restore him to his wonted placidity. But his thoughts had\r\nbeen too violently broken. His hands shook, hid lip trembled with the\r\ntearless passion of later life. And when his agitation began to die\r\ndown and something like calmness supervened, this did but enable him to\r\nfeel more keenly the pangs, not of remorse, but of regret; of bitter,\r\nunavailing regret for all the things of which the woman who had lain on\r\nhis bosom had robbed his life.\r\n\r\nStapylton stood in a side valley projected among the low green hills\r\nwhich fringe the vale of the Wiltshire Avon. From where he stood all\r\nwithin sight, the gentle downs above the house, the arable land which\r\nfringed them, the rich pastures below—all, mill and smithy and inn,\r\nsnug farm and thatched cottage, called him lord. Nay, from the south\r\nend of the pool, where a wicket gave entrance to the park—whence also a\r\nside view of the treble front of the house could be obtained—the spire\r\nof Chippinge church was visible, rising from its ridge in the Avon\r\nalley; and to the base of that spire all was his, all had been his\r\nfather’s and his grandfather’s. But not an acre, not a rood, would be\r\nhis child’s.\r\n\r\nThis was no new thought. It was a thought that had saddened him on many\r\nand many a summer evening when the shadow of the elms lay far across\r\nthe sward, and the silence of the stately house, the pale water, the\r\nfar-stretching farms whispered of the passing of the generations, of\r\nthe passage of time, of the inevitable end. Where he walked his father\r\nhad walked; and soon he would go whither his father had gone. And the\r\nheir would walk where he walked, listen to the same twilight\r\ncarollings, hear the first hoot of the distant owl.\r\n\r\n_Cedes coemptis saltibus, el domo\r\nVillaque, flavus quam Tiberis lavit_,\r\n\r\n_Cedes, et exstructis in altum_\r\n\r\n_Divitiis potietur heres_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut no heir of his blood. No son of his. No man of the Vermuyden name.\r\nAnd for that he had to thank her.\r\n\r\nIt was this which to-day gave the old thought new poignancy. For that\r\nhe had to thank her. Truly, in the words wrung from him by the\r\nbitterness of his feelings, she had left his house unto him desolate.\r\nIf even the little girl had lived, the child would have succeeded; and\r\nthat had been something, that had been much. But the child was dead;\r\nand in his heart he laid her death at his wife’s door. And a stranger,\r\nor one in essentials a stranger, the descendant by a second marriage of\r\nhis grandmother, Katherine Beckford, was the heir.\r\n\r\nPresently the young man would succeed and the old chattels would be\r\nswept away to cottage or lumber-room. The old horses would be shot, the\r\nold dogs would be hanged, the old servants discharged, perhaps the very\r\ntrees under which he walked and which he loved would be cut down. The\r\nhouse, the stables, the kennels, all but the cellars would be\r\nrefurnished; and in the bustle and glitter of the new _régime_, begun\r\nin the sunshine, the twilight of his own latter days would be forgotten\r\nin a month.\r\n\r\n_We die and are forgotten, ’tis Heaven’s decree,\r\nAnd thus the lot of others will be the lot of me!_\r\n\r\n\r\nSunday by Sunday he had read those lines on the grave of a kinsman, a\r\nman whom he had known. He had often repeated them, he could as soon\r\nforget them as his prayers. To-day the old memories and the old times,\r\nwhich Lady Lansdowne had made to rise from the dead, gave them a new\r\nmeaning and a new bitterness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\nA SAD MISADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Vaughan was not a little relieved by the tidings which Isaac\r\nWhite had conveyed to him at Chippenham. The news freed him from a duty\r\nwhich did not appear the less distasteful because it was no longer\r\ninevitable. To cast against Sir Robert the vote which he owed to Sir\r\nRobert must have exposed him to odium, whatever the matter at stake.\r\nBut at this election, at which the issue was, aye or no, was the\r\nborough to be swept away or not, to vote “aye” was an act from which\r\nthe least sensitive must have shrunk, and which the most honest must\r\nhave performed with reluctance. Add the extreme exasperation of public\r\nfeeling, of which every day and every hour brought to light the most\r\nglaring proofs, and he had been fortunate indeed if he had not incurred\r\nsome general blame as well as the utmost weight of Sir Robert’s\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nHe was spared all this, and he was thankful. Yet, when he rose on the\r\nmorning after his arrival at Bristol, his heart was not as light as a\r\nfeather. On the contrary, as he looked from the window of the White\r\nLion into the bustle of Broad Street, he yawned dolefully; admitting\r\nthat life, and particularly the prospect before him, of an immediate\r\nreturn to London, was dull. Why go back? Why stay here? Why do\r\nanything? The Woolsack? Bah! The Cabinet? Pooh! They were but gaudy\r\nbaits for the shallow and the hard-hearted. Moreover, they were so\r\ndistant, so unattainable, that pursuit of them seemed the merest\r\nmoonshine; more especially on this fine April morning, made for nothing\r\nbut a coach ride through an enchanted country, by the side of the\r\nsweetest face, the brightest eyes, the most ravishing figure, the\r\nprettiest bonnet that ever tamed the gruffest of coachmen.\r\n\r\nHeigh-ho! If it were all to do over again how happy would he be! How\r\nhappy had he been, and not known it, the previous morning! It was\r\npitiful to think of him in his ignorance, with that day, that blissful\r\nday, before him.\r\n\r\nWell, it was over. And he must return to town. For he would play no\r\nfoolish tricks. The girl was not in his rank in life, and he could not\r\nfollow her without injury to her. He was no preacher, and he had lived\r\nfor years among men whose lives, if not worse than the lives of their\r\ndescendants, wore no disguise; who, if they did not sin more, sinned\r\nmore openly. But he had a heart, and to mar an innocent life for his\r\npleasure had shocked him; even if the girl’s modesty and self-respect,\r\ndisclosed by a hundred small things, had not made the notion of\r\nwronging her abhorrent. None the less he took his breakfast in a kind\r\nof dream, whispered “Mary!” three times in different tones, and, being\r\nsuddenly accosted by the waiter, was irritable.\r\n\r\nWith all this he was wise enough to know his own weakness, and that the\r\nsooner he was out of Bristol the better. He sent to the Bush office to\r\nbook a place by the midday coach to town; and then only, when he had\r\ntaken the irrevocable step, he put on his hat to kill the intervening\r\ntime in Bristol.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as he crossed the hall, intending to walk towards\r\nClifton, he heard himself named; and turning, he saw that the speaker\r\nwas the lady in black, and wearing a veil, whom he had remarked walking\r\nup and down beside the coach, while the horses were changing at\r\nMarshfield.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Vaughan?” she said.\r\n\r\nHe raised his hat, much surprised. “Yes,” he answered. He fancied that\r\nshe was inspecting him very closely through her veil. “I am Mr.\r\nVaughan.”\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” she continued—her voice was refined and low—“but they gave\r\nme your name at the office. I have something which belongs to the lady\r\nwho travelled with you yesterday, and I am anxious to restore it.”\r\n\r\nHe blushed; nor could he have repressed the blush if his life had hung\r\nupon it. “Indeed?” he murmured. His confusion did not permit him to add\r\nanother word.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless it was left in the coach,” the lady explained, “and was\r\ntaken to my room with my luggage. Unfortunately I am leaving Bristol at\r\nonce, within a few minutes, and I cannot myself return it. I shall be\r\nmuch obliged if you will see that she has it safely.”\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if the thing were a matter of course. But Vaughan had now\r\nrecovered himself. “I would with pleasure,” he said; “but I am myself\r\nleaving Bristol at midday, and I really do not know how—how I can do\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Then perhaps you will arrange the matter,” the lady replied in a tone\r\nof displeasure. “I have sent the parcel to your room and I have not\r\ntime to regain it. I must go at once. There is my maid! Good morning!”\r\nAnd with a distant bow she glided from him, and disappeared through the\r\nnearest doorway.\r\n\r\nHe stood where she had left him, looking after her in bewilderment. For\r\none thing he was sure that she was a stranger, and yet she had\r\naddressed him in the tone of one who had a right to be obeyed. Then how\r\nodd it was! What a coincidence! He had made up his mind to end the\r\nmatter, to go and walk the Hot Wells like a good boy; and this happened\r\nand tempted him!\r\n\r\nYes, tempted him.\r\n\r\nHe would—— But he could not tell what he would do until he had seen if\r\nthe parcel were really in his room. The parcel! The mere thought that\r\nit was hers sent a foolish thrill through him. He would go and see, and\r\nthen——\r\n\r\nBut he was interrupted. There were people standing or sitting round the\r\nhall, a low-ceiled, dark wainscoted room, with sheaves of way-bills\r\nhung against the square pillars, and theatre notices flanking the bar\r\nwindow. As he turned to seek his rooms a hand gripped his arm and\r\ntwitched him round, and he met the grinning face of a man in his old\r\nregiment, Bob Flixton, commonly called the Honourable Bob.\r\n\r\n“So I’ve caught you, my lad,” said he. “This is mighty fine. Veiled\r\nladies, eh? Oh, fie! fie!”\r\n\r\nVaughan, innocent as he was, was a little put out. But he answered\r\ngood-humouredly, “What brought you here, Flixton?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, just so! Very unlucky, ain’t it?” grinning. “Fear I’ll cut you\r\nout, eh? You’re a neat artist, I must say.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know the good lady from Eve!”\r\n\r\n“Tell that to—— But here, let me make you known to Brereton,” hauling\r\nhim towards a gentleman who was seated in one of the window recesses.\r\n“Old West Indian man, in charge of the recruiting district, and a good\r\nfellow, but a bit of a saint! Colonel,” he rattled on, as they joined\r\nthe gentleman, “here’s Vaughan, once of ours, become a counsellor, and\r\ngoing to be Lord Chancellor. As to the veiled lady, mum, sir, mum!”\r\nwith an exaggerated wink.\r\n\r\nVaughan laughed. It was impossible to resist Bob’s impudent\r\ngood-humour. He was a fair young man, short, stout, and inclining to\r\nbaldness, with a loud, hearty voice, and a manner which made those who\r\ndid not know him for a peer’s son, think of a domestic fowl with a high\r\nopinion of itself. He was for ever damning this and praising that with\r\nunflagging decision; a man with whom it was impossible to be\r\ndispleased, and in whom it was next to impossible not to believe. Yet\r\nat the mess-table it was whispered that he did not play his best when\r\nthe pool was large; nor had he ever seen service, save in the lists of\r\nlove, where his reputation stood high.\r\n\r\nHis companion, Vaughan saw, was of a different stamp. He was tall and\r\nlean, with the air and carriage of a soldier, but with features of a\r\nrefined and melancholy cast, and with a brooding sadness in his eyes\r\nwhich could not escape the most casual observer. He was somewhat\r\nsallow, the result of the West Indian climate, and counted twenty years\r\nmore than Flixton, for whom his gentle and quiet manner formed an\r\nadmirable foil. He greeted Vaughan courteously, and the Honourable Bob\r\nforced our hero into a seat beside them.\r\n\r\n“That’s snug!” he said. “And now mum’s the word, Vaughan. We’ll not ask\r\nyou what you’re doing here among the nigger-nabobs. It’s clear enough.”\r\n\r\nVaughan explained that the veiled lady was a stranger who had come down\r\nin the coach with him, and that, for himself, it was election business\r\nwhich had brought him.\r\n\r\n“Old Vermuyden?” returned the Honourable Bob. “To be sure! Man you’ve\r\nexpectations from! Good old fellow, too. I know him. Go and see him one\r\nof these days. Gad, Colonel, if old Sir Robert heard your views he’d\r\ndie on the spot! D——n the Bill, he’d say! And I say it too!”\r\n\r\n“But afterwards?” Brereton returned, drawing Vaughan into the argument\r\nby a courteous gesture. “Consider the consequences, my dear fellow, if\r\nthe Bill does not pass.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, hang the consequences!”\r\n\r\n“You can’t,” drily. “You can hang men—we’ve been too fond of hanging\r\nthem—but not consequences! Look at the state of the country; everywhere\r\nyou will find excitement, and dangerous excitement. Cobbett’s writings\r\nhave roused the South; the papers are full of rioters and special\r\ncommission to try them! Not a farmer can sleep for thinking of his\r\nstacks, nor a farmer’s wife for thinking of her husband. Then for the\r\nNorth; look at Birmingham and Manchester and Glasgow, with their\r\nPolitical Unions preaching no taxation without representation. Or,\r\nnearer home, look at Bristol here, ready to drown the Corporation, and\r\nWetherell in particular, in the Float! Then, if that is the state of\r\nthings while they still expect the Bill to pass, what will be the\r\nposition if they learn it is not to pass? No, no! You may shrug your\r\nshoulders, but the three days in Paris will be nothing to it.”\r\n\r\n“What I say is, shoot!” Flixton answered hotly. “Shoot! Shoot! Put ’em\r\ndown! Put an end to it! Show ’em their places! What do a lot of d——d\r\nshopkeepers and peasants know about the Bill? Ride ’em down! Give ’em a\r\ntaste of the Float themselves! I’ll answer for it a troop of the 14th\r\nwould soon bring the Bristol rabble to their senses!”\r\n\r\n“I should be sorry to see it tried,” Brereton answered, shaking his\r\nhead. “They took that line in France last July, and you know the\r\nresult. You’ll agree with me, Mr. Vaughan, that where Marmont failed we\r\nare not likely to succeed. The more as his failure is known. The three\r\ndays of July are known.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, by the Lord,” the Honourable Bob cried. “The revolution in France\r\nbred the whole of this trouble!”\r\n\r\n“The mob there won, and the mob here know it. In my opinion,” Brereton\r\ncontinued, “conciliation is our only card, if we do not want to see a\r\nrevolution.”\r\n\r\n“Hang your conciliation! Shoot, I say!”\r\n\r\n“What do you think, Mr. Vaughan?”\r\n\r\n“I think with you, Colonel Brereton,” Vaughan answered, “that the only\r\nway to avoid such a crisis as has befallen France is to pass the Bill,\r\nand to set the Constitution on a wider basis by enlisting as large a\r\nnumber as possible in its defence.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord! Oh, Lord!” from Flixton.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand,” Vaughan continued, “I would put down the\r\nbeginnings of disorder with a strong hand. I would allow no\r\nintimidation, no violence. The Bill should be passed by argument.”\r\n\r\n“Argument? Why, d——n me, intimidation is your argument!” the Honourable\r\nBob struck in, with more acuteness than he commonly evinced. “Pass the\r\nBill or we’ll loose the dog! At ’em, Mob, good dog! At ’em! That’s your\r\nargument!” triumphantly. “But I’ll be back in a minute.” And he left\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nVaughan laughed. Brereton, however, seemed to be unable to take the\r\nmatter lightly. “Do you really mean, Mr. Vaughan,” he said, “that if\r\nthere were trouble, here, for instance, you would not hesitate to give\r\nthe order to fire?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, sir, if it could not be put down with the cold steel.”\r\n\r\nThe Colonel shook his head despondently. “I don’t think I could,” he\r\nsaid. “I don’t think I could. You have not seen war, and I have. And it\r\nis a fearful thing. Bad enough abroad, infinitely worse here. The first\r\nshot—think, Mr. Vaughan, of what it might be the beginning! What\r\nhundreds and thousands of lives might hang upon it! How many scores of\r\ninnocent men shot down, of daughters made fatherless!” He shuddered.\r\n“And to give such an order on your own responsibility, when the first\r\nvolley might be the signal for a civil war, and twenty-four hours might\r\nsee a dozen counties in a blaze! It is horrible to think of! Too\r\nhorrible! It’s too much for one man’s shoulders! Flixton would do it—he\r\nsees no farther than his nose! But you and I, Mr. Vaughan—and on one’s\r\nown judgment, which might be utterly, fatally wrong! My God, no!”\r\n\r\n“Yet there must be a point,” Vaughan replied, “at which such an order\r\nbecomes necessary; becomes mercy!”\r\n\r\n“Ay,” Brereton answered eagerly; “but who is to say when that point is\r\nreached; and that peaceful methods can do no more? Or, granted that\r\nthey can do no more, that provocation once given, your force is\r\nsufficient to prevent a massacre! A massacre in such a place as this!”\r\n\r\nVaughan saw that the idea had taken possession of the other’s mind,\r\nand, aware that he had distinguished himself more than once on foreign\r\nservice, he wondered. It was not his affair, however; and “Let us hope\r\nthat the occasion may not arise,” he said politely.\r\n\r\n“God grant it!” Brereton replied. And then again, to himself and more\r\nfervently, “God grant it!” he muttered. The shadow lay darker on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nVaughan might have wondered more, if Flixton had not returned at that\r\nmoment and overwhelmed him with importunities to dine with him the next\r\nevening. “Gage and Congreve of the 14th are coming from Gloucester,” he\r\nsaid, “and Codrington and two or three yeomanry chaps. You must come.\r\nIf you don’t, I’ll quarrel with you and call you out! It’ll do you good\r\nafter the musty, fusty, goody-goody life you’ve been leading.\r\nBrereton’s coming, and we’ll drink King Billy till we’re blind!”\r\n\r\nVaughan hesitated. He had taken his place on the coach, but—but after\r\nall there was that parcel. He must do something about it. It seemed to\r\nbe his fate to be tempted, yet—what nonsense that was! Why should he\r\nnot stay in Bristol if he pleased?\r\n\r\n“You’re very good,” he said at last. “I’ll stay.”\r\n\r\nYet on his way to his room he paused, half-minded to go. But he was\r\nashamed to change his mind again, and he strode on, opened his door,\r\nand saw the parcel, a neat little affair, laid on the table.\r\n\r\nIt bore in a clear handwriting the address which he had seen on the\r\nbasket at Mary Smith’s feet. But, possibly because an hour of the\r\nHonourable Bob’s company had brushed the bloom from his fancy, it moved\r\nhim little. He looked at it with something like indifference, felt no\r\ninclination to kiss it, and smiled at his past folly as he took it up\r\nand set off to return it to its owner. He had exaggerated the affair\r\nand his feelings; he had made much out of little, and a romance out of\r\na chance encounter. He could smile now at that which had moved him\r\nyesterday. Certainly:\r\n\r\n_Man’s love is of man’s life a thing apart_,\r\n\r\n_’Tis woman’s whole existence; man may range_\r\n\r\n_The Court, camp, Church, the vessel and the mart_,\r\n\r\n_Sword, gown, gain, glory, offer in exchange_\r\n\r\n_Pride, fame, ambition to fill up his heart_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the Honourable Bob, with his breezy self-assertion, had brought\r\nthis home to him and, with a puff of everyday life, had blown the\r\nfantasy away.\r\n\r\nHe was still under this impression when he reached Queen’s Square, once\r\nthe pride of Bristol, and still, in 1831, a place handsome and well\r\ninhabited. Uniformly and substantially built, on a site surrounded on\r\nthree sides by deep water, it lay, indeed, rather over-near the quays,\r\nof which, and of the basins, it enjoyed a view through several\r\nopenings. But in the reign of William IV. merchants were less averse\r\nfrom living beside their work than they are now. The master’s eye was\r\nstill in repute, and though many of the richest citizens had migrated\r\nto Clifton, and the neighbouring Assembly Rooms in Prince’s Street had\r\nbeen turned into a theatre, the spacious square, with its wide lawn,\r\nits lofty and umbrageous elms, its colony of rooks, and, last of all,\r\nits fine statue of the Glorious and Immortal Memory, was still the\r\nabode of many respectable people. In one corner stood the Mansion\r\nHouse; a little further along the same side the Custom House; and a\r\nthird public department, the Excise, also had offices here.\r\n\r\nThe Cathedral and the Bishop’s Palace, on College Green, stood, as the\r\ncrow flies, scarce a bow-shot from the Square; on which they looked\r\ndown from the westward, as the heights of Redcliffe looked down on it\r\nfrom the east. But marsh as well as water divided the Square from these\r\nrespectable neighbours; nor, it must be owned, was this the only\r\ndrawback. The centre of the city’s life, but isolated on three sides by\r\nwater, the Square was as easily reached from the worse as from the\r\nbetter quarters, and owing to the proximity of the Welsh Back, a\r\ncoasting quay frequented by the roughest class, it was liable in times\r\nof excitement to abrupt and boisterous inroads.\r\n\r\nVaughan entered the Square by Queen Charlotte Street, and had traversed\r\none half of its width when his nonchalance failed him. Under the elms,\r\nin the corner which he was approaching, were a dozen children. They\r\nwere at play, and overlooking them from a bench, with their backs to\r\nhim, sat two young persons, the one in that mid-stage between childhood\r\nand womanhood when the eyes are at their sharpest and the waist at its\r\nthickest, the other, Mary Smith.\r\n\r\nThe colour rose to his brow, and to his surprise he found that he was\r\nnot indifferent. Nor was the discovery that the back of her head and an\r\ninch of the nape of her neck had this effect upon him the worst. He had\r\nto ask himself what, if he was not indifferent, he was doing there,\r\nsneaking on the skirts of a ladies’ school. What were his intentions,\r\nand what his aim? For to healthy minds there is something distasteful\r\nin the notion of an intrigue connected, ever so remotely, with a girls’\r\nschool. Nor are conquests gained on that scene laurels of which even a\r\nLothario is over-proud. If Flixton saw him, or some others of the\r\ngallant Fourteenth!\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in the teeth of all this, and under the eyes of all Queen’s\r\nSquare, he must do his errand. And sheepish within, brazen without, he\r\nadvanced and stood beside her. She heard his step, and, unsuspicious as\r\nthe youngest of her flock, looked up to see who came—looked, and saw\r\nhim standing within a yard of her, with the sunshine falling through\r\nthe leaves on his wavy, fair hair. For the twentieth part of a second\r\nhe fancied a glint of glad surprise in her eyes. Then, if anything\r\ncould have punished him, it was the sight of her confusion; it was the\r\nblush of distress which covered her face as she rose to her feet.\r\n\r\nOh, cruel! He had pursued her, when to pursue was an insult! He had\r\nfollowed her when he should have known that in her position a breath of\r\nscandal was ruin! And oh, the round eyes of the round-faced child\r\nbeside her!\r\n\r\n“I must apologise,” he murmured humbly, “but I am not trespassing upon\r\nyou without a cause. I—I think that this is yours.” And rather lamely,\r\nfor the distress in her face troubled him, he held out the parcel.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand behind her, and as stiffly as Miss Sibson—of the\r\nQueen’s Square Academy for Young Ladies of the Genteel and Professional\r\nClasses—could have desired. “I do not understand, sir,” she said. She\r\nwas pale and red by turns, as the round eyes saw.\r\n\r\n“You left this in the coach.”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon?”\r\n\r\n“You left this in the coach,” he repeated, turning very red himself.\r\nWas it possible that she meant to repudiate her own property because he\r\nbrought it? “It is yours, is it not?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“It is not!” in incredulous astonishment.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“But I am sure it is,” he persisted. Confound it, this was a little\r\noverdoing modesty! He had no desire to eat the girl! “You left it\r\ninside the coach, and it has your address upon it. See!” And he tried\r\nto place it in her hands.\r\n\r\nBut she drew back with a look of reprobation of which he would not have\r\nbelieved her eyes capable. “It is not mine, sir,” she said. “Be good\r\nenough to leave us!” And then, drawing herself up, mild creature as she\r\nwas, “You are intruding, sir,” she said.\r\n\r\nNow, if Vaughan had really been guilty of approaching her upon a\r\nfeigned pretext, he had certainly retired on that with his tail between\r\nhis legs. But being innocent, and both incredulous and angry, he stood\r\nhis ground, and his eyes gave back some of the reproach which hers\r\ndarted.\r\n\r\n“I am either mad or it is yours,” he said stubbornly, heedless of the\r\nring of staring children who, ceasing to play, had gathered round them.\r\n“It bears your name and address, and it was left in the coach by which\r\nyou travelled yesterday. I think, Miss Smith, you will be sorry\r\nafterwards if you do not take it.”\r\n\r\nShe fancied that his words imported a bribe; and in despair of ridding\r\nherself of him, or in terror of the tale which the children would tell,\r\nshe took her courage in both hands. “You say that it is mine?” she\r\nsaid, trembling visibly.\r\n\r\n“Certainly I do,” he answered. And again he held it out to her.\r\n\r\nBut she did not take it. Instead, “Then be good enough to follow me,”\r\nshe replied, with something of the prim dignity of the school-mistress.\r\n“Miss Cooke, will you collect the children and bring them into the\r\nhouse?”\r\n\r\nAnd, avoiding his eyes, she led the way across the road to the door of\r\none of the houses. He followed, but reluctantly, and after a moment of\r\nhesitation. He detested the scene which he now foresaw, and bitterly\r\nregretted that he had ever set foot inside Queen’s Square. To be\r\nsuspected of thrusting an intrigue upon a little schoolmistress, to be\r\ndragged, with a pack of staring, chattering children in his train,\r\nbefore some grim-faced duenna—he, a man of years and affairs, with whom\r\nthe Chancellor of England did not scorn to speak on equal terms! It was\r\nhateful; it was an intolerable position. Yet to turn back, to say that\r\nhe would not go, was to acknowledge himself guilty. He wished—he wished\r\nto heaven that he had never seen the girl. Or at least that he had had\r\nthe courage, when she first denied the thing, to throw the parcel on\r\nthe seat and go.\r\n\r\nIt was not an heroic frame of mind; but neither was the position\r\nheroic. And something may be forgiven him in the circumstances.\r\n\r\nFortunately the trial was short. She opened the door of the house, and\r\non the threshold he found himself face to face with a tall, bulky\r\nwoman, with a double chin, and an absurdly powdered nose, who wore a\r\ncameo of the late Queen Charlotte on her ample bosom. Miss Sibson had\r\nviewed the encounter from an upper window, and her face was a picture\r\nof displeasure, slightly tempered by powder.\r\n\r\n“What is this?” she asked, in an intimidating voice. “Miss Smith, what\r\nis this, if you please?”\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mary, aware that her place was at stake, was desperate. At any\r\nrate she behaved with a dignity which astonished Vaughan. “This\r\ngentleman, Madam,” she explained, speaking with firmness though her\r\nface was on fire, “travelled with me on the coach yesterday. A few\r\nminutes ago he appeared and addressed me, and insisted that the—the\r\nparcel he carries is mine, and that I left it in the coach. It is not\r\nmine, and I have not seen it before.”\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson folded her arms upon her ample person. The position was not\r\naltogether new to her.\r\n\r\n“Sir,” she said, eying the offender majestically, “have you any\r\nexplanation to offer—of this extraordinary conduct?”\r\n\r\nHe had, indeed. As clearly as his temper permitted he told his tale,\r\nhis tone half ironical, half furious.\r\n\r\nWhen he paused, “Who do you say gave it to you?” Miss Sibson asked in a\r\ndeep voice.\r\n\r\n“I do not know her name. A lady who travelled in the coach.”\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson’s frown grew even deeper. “Thank you,” she replied, “that\r\nwill do. I have heard enough, and I understand. I understand, sir. Be\r\ngood enough to leave the house.”\r\n\r\n“But, Madam——”\r\n\r\n“Be good enough to leave the house,” she repeated. “That is the door,”\r\npointing to it. “That is the door, sir! Any apology you may wish to\r\nmake, you can make by letter to me. To me, you understand! I think one\r\nwere not ill-fitting!”\r\n\r\nHe lost his temper altogether at that, and he flung the parcel with\r\nviolence, and with a violent word, on a chair. “Then at any rate I\r\nshall not take that, for it’s not mine!” he cried. “You may keep it,\r\nMadam!”\r\n\r\nAnd he flung out, his retreat hampered and made humiliating by the\r\nentrance of the pupils, who, marshalled by the round-eyed one, and all\r\nround-eyed themselves, blocked the doorway at that unlucky moment. He\r\nbroke through them without ceremony, though they represented the most\r\nrespectable families in Bristol, and with his head bent he strode\r\nwrathfully across the Square.\r\n\r\nTo be turned out of a girls’ boarding-school! To be shown the door like\r\nsome wretched philandering schoolboy, or a subaltern in his first\r\nfolly! He, the man of the world, of experience, of ambition! The man\r\nwith a career! He was furious.\r\n\r\n“The little cat!” he cried as he went. “I wish I had never seen her\r\nface! What a fool, what a fool I was to come!”\r\n\r\nUnheroic words and an unheroic mood. But though there were heroes\r\nbefore Agamemnon, it is not certain that there were any after George\r\nthe Fourth. At any rate, any who, like that great man, were heroic\r\nalways and in all circumstances.\r\n\r\nProbably Vaughan would have forgiven the little cat had he known that\r\nshe was at that moment weeping very bitterly, with her face plunged\r\ninto the pillow of her not over-luxurious bed. For she was young, and a\r\nwoman. And because, in her position, the name of love was taboo;\r\nbecause to her the admiring look, which to a more fortunate sister was\r\nhomage, was an insult; because the _petits soins_, the flower, the\r\nnote, the trifle that to another were more precious than jewels, were\r\nnot for her, it did not follow that she was not flesh and blood, that\r\nshe had not feeling, affection, passion. True, the pang was soon\r\ndeadened, for habit is strong. True, the bitter tears were soon dried,\r\nfor employers like not gloomy looks. True, she soon cried shame on her\r\nown discontent, for she was good as gold. And yet to be debarred, in\r\nthe tender springtime, from the sweet scents, the budding blooms, the\r\ngay carols, to have but one April coach-ride in a desert of days, is\r\nhard—is very hard. Mary Smith, weeping on her hopeless pillow—not\r\nwithout thought of the cruel arch stooping to crush her, the cruel fate\r\nfrom which he had snatched her, not without thought of her own\r\ningratitude, her black ingratitude—felt that it was hard, very hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\nTHE BILL FOR GIVING EVERYBODY EVERYTHING!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to describe and impossible to exaggerate the heat of\r\npublic feeling which preceded the elections of ’31. Four-fifths of the\r\npeople of this country believed that the Bill—from which they expected\r\nso much that a satirist has aptly given it the title at the head of\r\nthis chapter—had been defeated in the late House by a trick. That trick\r\nthe King, God bless him, had punished by dissolving the House. It\r\nremained for the people to show their sense of the trick by returning a\r\nvery different House; such a House as would not only pass the Bill, but\r\npass it by a majority so decisive that the Lords, and particularly the\r\nBench of Bishops, whose hostility was known, would not dare to oppose\r\nthe public will.\r\n\r\nBut as no more than a small proportion of these four-fifths had votes,\r\nthey were forced to act, if they would make their will obeyed,\r\nindirectly; in one place by the legitimate pressure of public opinion,\r\nin another by bribery, in a third by intimidation, in a fourth, and a\r\nfifth, and a sixth by open violence; everywhere by the unspoken threat\r\nof revolution. And hence arose the one good, sound, and firm argument\r\nagainst the Bill which the Tory party enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOne or two of their other arguments are not without interest, if only\r\nas the defence set up for a system so anomalous as to seem to us\r\nincredible—a system under which Gatton, with no inhabitants, returned\r\ntwo members, and Sheffield, with something like a hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants, returned none; under which Dunwich, long drowned under the\r\nNorth Sea, returned two members, and Birmingham returned none; under\r\nwhich the City of London returned four and Lord Lonsdale returned nine;\r\nunder which Cornwall, with one-fourth of the population of Lancashire,\r\nreturned thrice as many representatives; under which the South vastly\r\noutweighed the North, and land mightily outweighed all other property.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in no two boroughs was the franchise the same. One man lived\r\nin a hovel and had a vote; his neighbour lived in a mansion and had no\r\nvote. Frequently the whole of the well-to-do townsfolk were voteless.\r\nThen, while any man with five thousand pounds might buy a seat, nor see\r\nthe face of a single elector, on the other hand, the poll might be kept\r\nopen for fifteen days, and a single county election might cost two\r\nhundred thousand pounds. Bribery, forbidden in theory, was permitted in\r\npractice. The very Government bribed under the rose, and it was\r\nhumorously said that all that a man’s constituents required was to be\r\nsatisfied of the _impurity_ of his intentions!\r\n\r\nAn anomalous system; yet its defenders had something to say for it.\r\n\r\nFirst, that narrow as the franchise seemed, every class found somewhere\r\nin England its mouthpiece. At Preston, where all could vote who slept\r\nin the borough the previous night, the poorest class; in the\r\npotwalloping boroughs where a fireplace gave a vote, the next class; in\r\na city like Westminster, the ratepayers; in the counties, the\r\nfreeholders; in the universities, the clergy. And so on, the argument\r\nbeing that the very anomalies of the system provided a mixed\r\nrepresentation without giving the masses a preponderant voice.\r\n\r\nSecondly, they said that it insured a House of ability, by enabling\r\nyoung men of parts, but small means, to obtain seats. Those who put\r\nthis forward flourished a long list of statesmen who had come in for\r\nnomination boroughs. It began with Pitt and ended with Macaulay—a\r\nfeather plucked from the enemy’s wing; and Burke stood for much in it.\r\nIt became one of the commonplaces of the struggle.\r\n\r\nThe third contention was of greater weight. It was that, with all its\r\nabuses, the old system had worked well. This argument, too, had its\r\ncommonplace. The proverb, _stare super antiquas vias_, was thundered\r\nfrom a thousand platforms, coupled with copious references to the\r\nFrench wars, and to the pilot who had weathered the storm. This was the\r\nargument of the old, and the rich, and the timid—of those who clung to\r\ntop-boots in the daytime and to pantaloons in the evening. But as the\r\nstruggle progressed it came to be merged in the one sound argument to\r\nwhich reference has been made.\r\n\r\n“If you do not pass the Bill,” said the Whigs, “there will be a\r\nrevolution.”\r\n\r\n“Possibly,” the Tories rejoined. “And whom have we to thank for that?\r\nWho, using the French Revolution of last July as a fulcrum, have\r\nunsettled the whole country? And now, having disturbed everything, tell\r\nus that we must grant to force what is not due to reason? You! But if\r\nthe Bill is to pass, not because it is a good Bill, but because the mob\r\ndesire it, where will this end? Pass Bills out of fear, and where will\r\nyou end? Presently there will arise a ranting adventurer, more violent\r\nthan Brougham, a hoary schemer more unscrupulous than Grey, an angry\r\nboy, outscolding Durham, a pedant more bloodless than Lord John, an\r\nhonest fanatic blinder than Althorp! And when _they_ threaten _you_\r\nwith the terrors of the mob, what will you say?”\r\n\r\nTo which the Whigs could only reply that the people must be trusted;\r\nand—and that the Bill must pass, or not only coronets but crowns would\r\nbe flying.\r\n\r\nDry arguments nowadays; but in those days alive, and to the party on\r\nits defence—the party which found itself thrust against the wall, that\r\nits pockets might be emptied—of vital interest. From scores of\r\nplatforms candidates, leaning forward, bland and smiling, with one hand\r\nunder the coat-tails and the other gently pumping, pumping, pumping,\r\nenunciated them—old hands these; or, red in the face, thundered them,\r\nstriking fist into palm and overawing opposition; or, hopeless amid the\r\nrain of dead cats and stale eggs, muttered them in a reporter’s ear,\r\nsince the hootings of the crowd made other utterance impossible. But\r\never as the contest went on, the smiling candidate grew rarer; for day\r\nby day the Tories, seeing their cause hopeless, seeing even Whigs, such\r\nas Sir Thomas Acland in Devonshire and Mr. Wilson Patten in Lancashire,\r\ncast out if they were lukewarm, grew more desperate, cried more loudly\r\non high heaven, asserted more frantically that justice was dead on the\r\nearth. All this, while those who believed that the Bill was going to\r\ngive everything to everybody pushed their advantage without mercy. Many\r\na borough which had not known a contest for a generation, many a\r\ncounty, was fought and captured. No Tory felt safe; no bargain, though\r\nsigned and sealed, held good; no patron, though he had held his income\r\nfrom his borough as secure as any part of his property, could say that\r\nhis voters would dare to go to the poll.\r\n\r\nThis last was the apprehension in the mind of Isaac White, Sir Robert\r\nVermuyden’s agent, as on the day after Lady Lansdowne’s visit he drove\r\nhis gig and fast-trotting cob up the avenue. The treble front of the\r\nhouse looked down on him from its gentle eminence; its windows blinked\r\nin the afternoon sunshine, and the mellow tints of the stone harmonised\r\nwith the russet bloom which in April garbs the poplar and the\r\nlater-bursting trees. Tradition said that the second baronet had built\r\na wing for each of his two sons. After the death of the elder, however,\r\nthe east wing had been devoted to kitchens and offices, and the west to\r\na splendid hospitality. In these days the latter wing was so seldom\r\nused that it had almost fallen into decay. Laurels grew up before the\r\nside windows and darkened them, and bats lived in the dry chimneys. The\r\nrooms above stairs were packed with the lumber of the last century,\r\nwith the old wig-boxes, the old travelling-trunks, the old\r\nharpsichords, even an old sedan chair; while the lower rooms, swept and\r\nbare, and hung with flat, hard portraits, enjoyed an evil reputation in\r\nthe servants’ quarters, where many a one could tell of skirts that\r\nrustled unseen, and dead feet that trod the polished floors.\r\n\r\nBut to Isaac White all this was nought. He had seen the house in every\r\naspect; and to-day his mind was filled with other things—with votes and\r\nvoters, with some anxiety on his own account and more on his patron’s.\r\nWhat would Sir Robert say if aught went wrong at Chippinge? True, the\r\nloss of the borough seemed barely possible; it had been held securely\r\nfor many years. But the times were so stormy, public feeling ran so\r\nhigh, the mob was so rough, that nothing seemed impossible, in view of\r\nthe stress to which the soundest candidates were exposed. If Mr. Bankes\r\nstood to fail in Dorset, if Mr. Duncombe had small chance in Yorkshire,\r\nif Sir Edward Knatchbull was a lost man in Kent, if Mr. Hart Davies was\r\nno better in Bristol, if no man but an out-and-out Reformer could count\r\non success, who was safe?\r\n\r\nWhite’s grandfather, his father, he himself had lived and thriven by\r\nthe system which he saw tottering to its fall. He belonged to it, he\r\nwas part of it; did he not mark his allegiance to it by wearing\r\ntop-boots in the daytime and shorts in full dress? And he was\r\nprepared—were it only out of gratitude to the ladder by which he had\r\nrisen—to stand by it and by his patron to the last. But, strange\r\nanomaly, White was at heart a Cobbett man. His sneaking sympathies\r\nwere, in his own despite, with the class from which he sprang. He saw\r\ncommons filched from the poor, while the labourers fell on the rates.\r\nHe saw large taxes wrung from the country to be spent in the town. He\r\nsaw the severity of the laws, and especially the game laws. He saw\r\nabsentee rectors and starving curates. He saw the dumb impotence of\r\nnine-tenths of the people; and he felt that the system under which\r\nthese things had grown up was wrong. But wrong or right, he was part of\r\nit, he was pledged to it; and all the theories in the world, and all\r\nthe “Political Registers” which he digested of an evening, would not\r\ninduce him to betray it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, he feared that in the matter of the borough he had not\r\nbeen quite so wide-awake as became him; or Pybus, the Bowood man, would\r\nnot have stolen a march upon him. His misgivings grew as he came in\r\nsight of the door, and saw Sir Robert on the flight of steps which led\r\nto it. Apparently the baronet had seen him, for as White drove up a\r\nservant appeared to lead the mare to the stables.\r\n\r\nSir Robert looked her over as she was led away. “The grey looks well,\r\nWhite,” he said. She was of his breeding.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Robert. Give me a good horse and they may have the\r\nnew-fangled railroads that like them. But I am afraid, sir——”\r\n\r\n“One moment!” The servant was out of hearing, and the baronet’s tone,\r\nas he caught White up, betrayed agitation. “Who is that looking over\r\nthe Lower Wicket, White?” he continued. “She has been there a quarter\r\nof an hour, and—and I can’t make her out.”\r\n\r\nHis tone surprised White, who looked and saw at a distance of a hundred\r\npaces the figure of a woman leaning on the wicket-gate nearest the\r\nstables. She was motionless, and he had not looked many seconds before\r\nhe caught the thought in Sir Robert’s mind. “He’s heard,” he reflected,\r\n“that her ladyship is in the neighbourhood, and it has alarmed him.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot see at this distance, sir,” he answered prudently, “who it\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n“Then go and ask her her business,” Sir Robert said, as indifferently\r\nas he could. “She has been there a long time.”\r\n\r\nWhite went, a little excited himself; but half-way to the woman, who\r\ncontinued to gaze at the house as if unconscious of his approach, he\r\ndiscovered that, whoever she was, she was not Lady Sybil. She was\r\nstout, middle-aged, plain; and he took a curt tone with her when he\r\ncame within earshot. “What are you doing here?” he said. “That’s the\r\nway to the servants’ hall.”\r\n\r\nThe woman looked at him. “You don’t know me, Mr. White?” she said.\r\n\r\nHe looked hard in return. “No,” he answered bluntly, “I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, I know you,” she replied. “More by token——”\r\n\r\nHe cut her short. “Have you any message?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“If I have, I’ll give it myself,” she retorted drily. “Truth is, I’m in\r\ntwo minds about it. What you have, you have, d’you see, Mr. White; but\r\nwhat you’ve given ain’t yours any more. Anyway——”\r\n\r\n“Anyway,” impatiently, “you can’t stay here!”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” she replied, “very good. As you are so kind, I’ll take a\r\nday to think of it.” And with a cool nod she turned her back on the\r\npuzzled White, and went off down the park towards the town.\r\n\r\nHe went back to Sir Robert. “She’s a stranger, sir,” he said; “and, I\r\nthink, a bit gone in the head. I could make nothing of her.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert drew a deep breath. “You’re sure she was a stranger?” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“She’s no one I know, sir. After one of the men, perhaps.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert straightened himself. He had spent a bad ten minutes gazing\r\nat the distant figure. “Just so,” he said. “Very likely. And now what\r\nis it, White?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve bad news, sir, I’m afraid,” the agent said, in an altered tone.\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“It’s that d——d Pybus, sir! I’m afraid that, after all——”\r\n\r\n“They’re going to fight?”\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid, Sir Robert, they are.”\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman’s eyes gleamed. “Afraid, sir, afraid?” he cried. “On\r\nthe contrary, so much the better. It will cost me some money, but I can\r\nspare it; and it will cost them more, and nothing for it. Afraid? I\r\ndon’t understand you.”\r\n\r\nThe agent, standing on the step below him, coughed dubiously. “Well,\r\nsir,” he said, “what you say is reasonable. But——”\r\n\r\n“But! But what?”\r\n\r\n“There is so much excitement in the country at this time——”\r\n\r\n“So much greediness in the country,” Sir Robert retorted, striking his\r\nstick upon the stone steps. “So much unscrupulousness, sir; so many\r\nliars promising, and so many fools listening; so much to get, and so\r\nmany who would like it! There’s all that, if you please; but for\r\nexcitement, I don’t know”—with a severe look—“what you mean, or what it\r\nhas to do with us.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, sir, there is bad news from Devon, where it is said our\r\ncandidate is retiring.”\r\n\r\n“A good man, but weak; neither one side nor the other.”\r\n\r\n“And from Dorset, sir, where they say Mr. Bankes will be beaten.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll not believe it,” Sir Robert answered positively. “I’ll never\r\nbelieve it. Mr. Bankes beaten in Dorset! Absurd! Why do you listen to\r\nsuch tales? Why do you listen? By G—d, White, what is the matter with\r\nyou? Or how does it touch us if Mr. Bankes is beaten? Nine votes to\r\nfour! Nine will still be nine, and four four, if he be beaten. When you\r\ncan make four to be more than nine you may come whining to me!”\r\n\r\nWhite coughed. “Dyas, the butcher——”\r\n\r\n“What of him?”\r\n\r\n“Well, Sir Robert, I am afraid he has been getting some queer notions.”\r\n\r\n“Notions?” the baronet echoed in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“He has been listening to someone, and—and thinks he has views on the\r\nBill.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert exploded. “Views!” he cried. “Views! The butcher with views!\r\nWhy, damme, White, you must be mad! Mad! Since when have butchers taken\r\nto politics, or had views?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about that, sir,” White mumbled.\r\n\r\nSir Robert struck his stick fiercely on a step. “But I do! I do! And I\r\nknow this,” he continued, “that for twenty years he’s had thirty pounds\r\na year to vote as I tell him. By gad, I never heard such a thing in my\r\nlife! Never! You don’t mean to tell me that the man thinks the vote’s\r\nhis own to do what he likes with?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid,” the agent admitted reluctantly, “that that is what he’s\r\nsaying, sir.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert’s thin face turned a dull red. “I never heard of such\r\nimpudence in all my life,” he said, “never! A butcher with views! And\r\ngoing to vote for them! Why, damme,” he continued, with angry sarcasm,\r\n“we’ll have the tailors, the bakers, and the candlestickmakers voting\r\ntheir own way next. Good G—d! What does the man think he’s had thirty\r\npounds a year for for all these years, if not to do as he is bid?”\r\n\r\n“He’s behaving very ill, sir,” White said, severely, “very ill.”\r\n\r\n“Ill!” Sir Robert cried; “I should think he was, the scoundrel!” And he\r\nfoamed over afresh, though we need not follow him. When he had cooled\r\nsomewhat, “Well,” he said, “I can turn him out, and that I’ll do, neck\r\nand crop! By G—d, I will! I’ll ruin him. But there, it’s the big rats\r\nset the fashion and the little ones follow it. This is Spinning Jenny’s\r\nwork. I wish I had cut off my hand before I voted for him. Well, well,\r\nwell!” And he stood a moment in bitter contemplation of Sir Robert\r\nPeel’s depravity. It was nothing that Sir Robert was sound on reform.\r\nBy adopting the Catholic side on the claims he—he, whose very nickname\r\nwas Orange Peel—had rent the party. And all these evils were the\r\nresult!\r\n\r\nThe agent coughed.\r\n\r\nSir Robert, who was no fool, looked sharply at him. “What!” he said\r\ngrimly. “Not another renegade?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” White answered timidly. “But Thrush, the pig-killer—he’s one\r\nof the old lot, the Cripples, that your father put into the\r\ncorporation——”\r\n\r\n“Ay, and I wish I had kept them cripples.” Sir Robert growled. “All\r\ncripples! My father was right, and I was a fool to think better men\r\nwould do as well, and do us credit. In his time there were but two of\r\nthe thirteen could read and write; but they did as they were bid. They\r\ndid as they were bid. And now—well, man, what of Thrush?”\r\n\r\n“He was gaoled yesterday by Mr. Forward, of Steynsham, for assault.”\r\n\r\n“For how long?”\r\n\r\n“For a fortnight, sir.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert nearly had a fit. He reared himself to his full height, and\r\nglared at White. “The infernal rascal!” he cried. “He did it on\r\npurpose!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve no doubt, sir, that it determined them to fight,” the agent\r\nanswered. “With Dyas they are five. And five to seven is not such—such\r\nodds that they may not have some hope of winning.”\r\n\r\n“Five to seven!” Sir Robert repeated; and at an end of words, at an end\r\nof oaths, could only stare aghast. “Five to seven!” he muttered.\r\n“You’re not going to tell me—there’s something more.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, no; that’s the worst,” White answered, relieved that his tale\r\nwas told. “That’s the worst, and may be bettered. I’ve thought it well\r\nto postpone the nomination until Wednesday the 4th, to give Sergeant\r\nWathen a better chance of dealing with Dyas.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” Sir Robert muttered. “It has come to that. It has come to\r\ndealing with such men as butchers, to treating them as if they had\r\nminds to alter and views to change. Well, well!”\r\n\r\nAnd that was all Sir Robert could say. And so it was settled; the\r\nVermuyden dinner for the 2nd, the nomination and polling for the 4th.\r\n“You’ll let Mr. Vaughan know,” Sir Robert concluded. “It’s well we can\r\ncount on somebody.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\nTHE QUEEN’S SQUARE ACADEMY FOR YOUNG LADIES\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson sat in state in her parlour in Queen’s Square. Rather more\r\ndignified of mien than usual, and more highly powdered of nose, the\r\nschoolmistress was dividing her attention between the culprit in the\r\ncorner, the elms outside—between which fledgeling rooks were making\r\nadventurous voyages—and the longcloth which she was preparing for the\r\nyoung ladies’ plain-sewing; for in those days plain-sewing was still\r\ntaught in the most select academies. Nor, while she was thus engaged in\r\nproviding for the domestic training of her charges, was she without\r\nassurance that their minds were under care. The double doors which\r\nseparated the schoolroom from the parlour were ajar, and through the\r\naperture one shrill voice after another could be heard, raised in\r\nmonotonous perusal of Mrs. Chapone’s “Letters to a Young Lady upon the\r\nImprovement of the Mind.”\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson wore her best dress, of black silk, secured half-way down\r\nthe bodice by the large cameo brooch. But neither this nor the reading\r\nin the next room could divert her attention from her duties.\r\n\r\n“The tongue,” she enunciated with great clearness, as she raised the\r\nlongcloth in both hands and carefully inspected it over her glasses,\r\n“is an unruly member. Ill-nature,” she continued, slowly meting off a\r\nportion, and measuring a second portion against it, “is the fruit of a\r\nbad heart. Our opinions of others”—this with a stern look at Miss\r\nHilhouse, fourteen years old, and in disgrace—“are the reflections of\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\nThe young lady, who was paying with the backboard for a too ready wit,\r\nput out the unruly member, and, narrowly escaping detection, looked\r\ninconceivably sullen.\r\n\r\n“The face is the mirror to the mind,” Miss Sibson continued\r\nthoughtfully, as she threaded a needle against the light. “I hope, Miss\r\nHilhouse, that you are now sorry for your fault.”\r\n\r\nMiss Hilhouse maintained a stolid silence. Her shoulders ached, but she\r\nwas proud.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said Miss Sibson placidly; “very good! With time comes\r\nreflection.”\r\n\r\nTime, a mere minute, brought more than reflection. A gentleman walked\r\nquickly across the fore-court to the door, the knocker fell sharply,\r\nand Miss Hilhouse’s sullenness dropped from her. She looked first\r\nuncomfortable, then alarmed. “Please, may I go now?” she muttered.\r\n\r\nWise Miss Sibson paid no heed. “A gentleman?” she said to the maid who\r\nhad entered. “Will I see him? Procure his name.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Miss Sibson,” came from the corner in an agonised whisper, “please\r\nmay I go?” Fourteen standing on a stool with a backboard could not bear\r\nto be seen by the other sex.\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson looked grave. “Are you sincerely sorry for your fault?” she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And will you apologise to Miss Smith for your—your gross rudeness?”\r\n\r\n“Ye-es.”\r\n\r\n“Then go and do so,” Miss Sibson replied; “and close the doors after\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nThe girl fled. And simultaneously Miss Sibson rose, with a mixture of\r\ndignity and blandness, to receive Arthur Vaughan. The schoolmistress of\r\nthat day who had not manner at command had nothing; for deportment\r\nranked among the essentials. And she was quite at her ease. The same\r\ncould not be said of the gentleman. But that his pride still smarted,\r\nbut that the outrage of yesterday was fresh, but that he drew a savage\r\nsatisfaction from the prospect of the apologies he was here to receive,\r\nhe had not come. Even so, he had told himself more than once that he\r\nwas a fool to come; a fool to set foot in the house. He was almost sure\r\nthat he had done more wisely had he burned the letter in which the\r\nschoolmistress informed him that she had an explanation to offer—and so\r\nhad made an end.\r\n\r\nBut if in place of meeting him with humble apologies, this confounded\r\nwoman were going to bear herself as if no amends were due, he had\r\nindeed made a mistake.\r\n\r\nYet her manner said almost as much as that. “Pray be seated, sir,” she\r\nsaid; and she indicated a chair.\r\n\r\nHe sat down stiffly, and glowered at her. “I received your note,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nShe smoothed her ample lap, and looked at him more graciously. “Yes,”\r\nshe said, “I was relieved to find that the unfortunate occurrence of\r\nyesterday was open to another explanation.”\r\n\r\n“I have yet,” he said curtly, “to hear the explanation.” Confound the\r\nwoman’s impudence!\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” she said slowly. “Exactly. Well, it turns out that the\r\nparcel you left behind you when you”—for an instant a smile broke the\r\nrubicund placidity of her face—“when you retired so hurriedly contained\r\na pelisse.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” he said drily.\r\n\r\n“Yes; and a letter.”\r\n\r\n“Oh?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; a letter from a lady who has for some years taken an interest in\r\nMiss Smith. The pelisse proved to be a gift from her.”\r\n\r\n“Then I fail to see——”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” Miss Sibson interposed blandly, indeed too blandly. “You\r\nfail to see why you came to be selected as the bearer? So do I. Perhaps\r\nyou can explain that.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered shortly. “Nor is that my affair. What I fail to see,\r\nMadam, is why Miss Smith did not at once suspect that the present came\r\nfrom the lady in question.”\r\n\r\n“Because,” Miss Sibson replied, “the lady was not known to be in this\r\npart of England; and because you, sir, maintained that Miss Smith had\r\nleft the parcel in the coach.”\r\n\r\n“I maintained what I was told.”\r\n\r\n“But it was not the fact. However, let that pass.”\r\n\r\n“No,” Vaughan retorted, with some warmth. “For it seems to me, Madam,\r\nvery extraordinary that in a matter which was capable of so simple an\r\nexplanation you should have elected to insult a stranger—a stranger\r\nwho——”\r\n\r\n“Who was performing no more than an office of civility, you would say?”\r\n\r\n“Precisely.”\r\n\r\n“Well—yes.” Miss Sibson spoke slowly, and was silent for a moment after\r\nshe had spoken. Then, somewhat abruptly, “You are an usher, I think,”\r\nshe said, “at Mr. Bengough’s?”\r\n\r\nVaughan almost jumped in his chair. “I, Madam?” he cried. “Certainly\r\nnot!”\r\n\r\n“Not at Mr. Bengough’s?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly not!” he repeated, with indignation. Was the woman mad? An\r\nusher? Good heavens!\r\n\r\n“I know your name,” she said slowly. “But——”\r\n\r\n“I came from London the day before yesterday. I am staying at the White\r\nLion, and I am late of the 14th Dragoons.”\r\n\r\nShe raised her eyebrows. “Oh, indeed,” she said. “Is that so? Well,”\r\nrubbing a little of the powder from her nose with a needlecase, and\r\nlooking at him very shrewdly, “I think,” she continued, “that that is\r\nthe answer to your question.”\r\n\r\nVaughan stared.\r\n\r\n“I do not understand you,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Then I must speak more plainly. Were you an usher at Mr. Bengough’s\r\nyour civility—civility, I think you called it?—to my assistant had\r\npassed very well, Mr. Vaughan. But the civility of a gentleman, late of\r\nthe 14th Dragoons, fresh from London, and staying at the White Lion, to\r\na young person in Miss Smith’s position is apt, as in this case—eh?—to\r\nlead to misconstruction.”\r\n\r\n“You do me an injustice!” he said, reddening to the roots of his hair.\r\n\r\n“Possibly, possibly,” Miss Sibson said. But on that, without warning,\r\nshe gave way to a fit of silent laughter, which caused her portly form\r\nto shake like a jelly. It was a habit with her, attributed by some to\r\nher private view of Mrs. Chapone’s famous letters on the improvement of\r\nthe mind; by others, to that knowledge of the tricks and turns of her\r\nsex with which thirty years of schoolkeeping had endowed her.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the face of rueful resentment with which Arthur Vaughan\r\nregarded her did not shorten the fit. But at last, “Young gentleman,”\r\nshe said, “you do not deceive me! You did not come here to-day merely\r\nto hear an old woman make an apology.”\r\n\r\nHe tried to maintain an attitude of dignified surprise. But her jolly\r\nlaugh, her shrewd red face were too much for him. His eyes fell. “Upon\r\nmy honour,” he said, “I meant nothing.”\r\n\r\nShe shook with fresh laughter. “It is just of that I complain, sir,”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\n“You can trust me.”\r\n\r\n“I can trust Miss Smith,” she retorted, shaking her head. “Her I know,\r\nthough our acquaintance is of the shortest. Still, I know her from top\r\nto toe. You, young gentleman, I don’t know. Mind,” she continued, with\r\ngood-nature, “I don’t say that you meant any harm when you came to-day.\r\nBut I’ll wager you thought that you’d see her.”\r\n\r\nVaughan laughed out frankly. Her humour had conquered him. “Well,” he\r\nsaid audaciously, “and am I not to see her?”\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson looked at him, and rubbed a little more powder from her\r\nnose. “Umph!” she said doubtfully. “If I knew you I’d know what to say\r\nto that. A pretty girl, eh?” she added with her head on one side.\r\n\r\nHe smiled.\r\n\r\n“And a good one! And if you were the usher at Mr. Bengough’s I’d ask no\r\nmore, but I’d send for her. But——”\r\n\r\nShe stopped. Vaughan said nothing, but a little out of countenance\r\nlooked at the floor.\r\n\r\n“Just so, just so,” Miss Sibson said, as quietly as if he had answered\r\nher. “Well, I am afraid I must not send for her.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at the carpet. “I have seen so little of her,” he said.\r\n\r\n“And I daresay you are a man of property?”\r\n\r\n“I am independent.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well, there it is.” Miss Sibson smoothed out the lap of her silk\r\ndress.\r\n\r\n“I do not think,” he said, in some embarrassment, “that five minutes’\r\ntalk would hurt her.”\r\n\r\n“Umph!”\r\n\r\nHe laughed—an awkward laugh. “Come, Miss Sibson,” he said. “Let us have\r\nthe five minutes, and let us both have the chance.”\r\n\r\nShe looked out of the window, and rubbed her glasses reflectively.\r\n“Well,” she said at length, as if she had not quite made up her mind,\r\n“I will be quite frank with you, Mr. Vaughan. I did not intend to be\r\nso, but you have met me half-way, and I believe you to be a gentleman.\r\nThe truth is, I should not have gone as far with you as I have\r\nunless”—she looked at him suddenly—“I had had a character of you.”\r\n\r\n“Of me?” he cried in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“From Miss Smith?”\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson smiled at his simplicity. “Oh, no,” she said; “you are\r\ngoing to see the character.” And with that the schoolmistress drew from\r\nher workbox a small slip of paper, which she unfolded and gave to him.\r\n“It is from the lady,” she said, “who made use of you yesterday.”\r\n\r\nHe took it in much astonishment. On the inner side of the paper, which\r\nwas faintly scented, he read a dozen words in a fine handwriting:\r\n\r\n“Mary Smith, from her fairy godmother. The bearer may be trusted.”\r\n\r\nVaughan stared at the paper in undiminished surprise. “I don’t\r\nunderstand,” he said. “Who is the lady, and what does she know of me?”\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you, nor can Miss Smith,” Miss Sibson replied. “Who,\r\nindeed, has seen her only twice or thrice, at long intervals, and has\r\nnot heard her name. But Miss Smith’s education—she has never known her\r\nparents—was defrayed, I presume, by this godmother. And once a year\r\nMiss Smith has been in the habit of receiving a gift, of some value to\r\na young person in her position, accompanied by a few words in that\r\nhandwriting.”\r\n\r\nVaughan stared. “And,” he said, “you draw the inference that—that——”\r\n\r\n“I draw no inference,” Miss Sibson replied drily, “save that I have\r\nauthority from—shall I say her godmother—to trust you farther than I\r\nshould have trusted you. That is the only inference I draw. But I have\r\none thing to add,” she continued. “Miss Smith did not enter my\r\nemployment in an ordinary way. My late assistant left me abruptly.\r\nWhile I was at a loss an attorney of character in this city called on\r\nme and said that a client desired to place a young person in safe\r\nhands; that she was a trained teacher, and must live by teaching, but\r\nthat care was necessary, since she was very young, and had more than\r\nher share of good looks. He hinted, Mr. Vaughan, at the inference which\r\nyou, I believe, have already drawn. And—and that is all.”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked thoughtfully at the carpet.\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson waited awhile. At last: “The point is,” she said shrewdly,\r\n“do you still wish to have the five minutes?”\r\n\r\nArthur Vaughan hesitated. He knew that he ought, that it was his duty,\r\nto say “No.” But something in the woman’s humorous eye challenged him,\r\nand recklessly—for the gratification of a moment—he said: “Yes, if you\r\nplease, I will see her.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, very good,” Miss Sibson answered slowly. She had not been\r\nblind to the momentary hesitation. “Then I will send her to you to make\r\nher apologies. Only be kind enough to remember that she does not know\r\nthat you have seen that slip of paper.”\r\n\r\nHe assented, and with a good-natured nod Miss Sibson rose and went\r\nheavily from the room. Not for nothing was she held in Bristol a woman\r\nof sagacity, whose game of whist it was a pleasure to watch; nor\r\nwithout reason had that attorney of character, of whom we have heard,\r\nchosen her _in custodiam puellæ_.\r\n\r\nVaughan waited, and to be frank, his heart beat more quickly than\r\nusual. He knew that he was doing a foolish thing, though he had refused\r\nto commit himself; and an unworthy thing, though Miss Sibson, perhaps\r\nfor her own reasons, had winked at it. He knew that he had no right to\r\nsee the girl if he did not mean her well; and how could he mean her\r\nwell when he had no intention of marrying her? For, for a man with his\r\ncareer in prospect to marry a girl in her position—to say nothing of\r\nthe stigma which no doubt lay upon her birth—was a folly of which none\r\nbut boys and old men were capable.\r\n\r\nHe listened, ill at ease, already repenting. The voices in the next\r\nroom, reduced to a faint murmur by the closed doors, ceased. She was\r\nbeing told. She was being sent to him. He coloured. Yes, he was ashamed\r\nof himself. He rose and went to the window, and wished that he had said\r\n“No”; that he had taken himself off. What was he doing here at his time\r\nof life—the most sane and best balanced time of life—in this girls’\r\nschool? It was unworthy of him.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and he forgot his unworthiness, he forgot all. The\r\nabnormal attraction, allurement, charm, call it what you will, which\r\nhad overcome him when she turned her eyes on him on the coach overcame\r\nhim again—and tenfold. He thought that it must lie in her eyes, gentle\r\nas a dove’s. And yet he did not know. He had not seen her indoors\r\nbefore, and her hair gathered in a knot at the back of her head was a\r\nGreek surprise to him; while her blushes, the quivering of her mouth,\r\nher figure slender but full of grace, and high-girdled after the mode\r\nof the day—all, all were so perfect, so enticing, that he knew not\r\nwhere the magic lay.\r\n\r\nBut magic there was. And such magic that though he had prepared\r\nhimself, and though the last thing in his thoughts was to insult her,\r\nhe forgot himself. As she paused, her hand still resting on the door,\r\nher face downcast and distressed, “Good G—d,” he cried, “how beautiful\r\nyou are!”\r\n\r\nAnd she saw that he meant no insult, that the words burst from him\r\nspontaneously. But not the less for that was their effect on her. She\r\nturned white, her very heart seeming to stop, she appeared to be about\r\nto swoon. While he, forgetting all but her shrinking beauty, devoured\r\nher with his eyes.\r\n\r\nUntil he remembered himself. Then he turned from her to the window.\r\n“Forgive me!” he cried. “I did not know what I said. You came on me so\r\nsuddenly; you looked so beautiful——”\r\n\r\nHe stopped; he could not go on.\r\n\r\nAnd she was trembling from head to foot; but she made an effort to\r\nescape back to the commonplace. “I came,” she stammered—it was clear\r\nthat she hardly knew what she was saying—“Miss Sibson told me to come\r\nto say that I—I was sorry, sir, that I—I misjudged you yesterday.”\r\n\r\n“Yesterday? Yesterday?” he cried, almost angrily. “Bah, it is an age\r\nsince yesterday!”\r\n\r\nShe could make no answer to that, though she knew well what he meant.\r\nIf she answered him it was only by suffering him to gaze at her in an\r\neloquent silence—a silence in which his eyes cried again and again,\r\n“How beautiful you are!” While her eyes, downcast, under trembling\r\nlashes, her heart beaten down, defenceless, cried only for “Quarter,\r\nquarter!”\r\n\r\nThey were yards apart. The table, and on it Miss Sibson’s squat workbox\r\nand a pile of longcloth, was between them. Miss Sibson herself could\r\nhave desired nothing more proper. And yet—\r\n\r\n_Farewell, farewell, my faithless shield,\r\nThy lord at length is forced to yield.\r\nVain, vain is every outward care,\r\nThe foe’s within and triumphs there!_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was all over. In her ears would ring for ever his words of\r\nworship—the cry of the man to the woman, “How beautiful you are!” She\r\nwould thrill with pleasure when she thought of them, and burn with\r\nshame, and never, never, never be the same again! And for him, with\r\nthat cry forced from him, love had become present, palpable, real, and\r\nthe idea of marriage real also; an idea to be withstood, to be\r\ncombated, to be treated as foolish, Byronic, impossible. But an idea\r\nwhich would not leave him any more than the image of her gentle beauty,\r\nindelibly stamped on his brain, would leave him. He might spend some\r\ndays or some weeks in doubt and wretchedness. But from that moment the\r\nodds were against him—he was young, and passion had never had her way\r\nwith him—as seriously against him as against the army that with spies\r\nand traitors in its midst moves against an united foe.\r\n\r\nNot a word that was _convenant_ had passed between them, though so much\r\nhad passed, when a hasty footstep crossed the forecourt, and stopped at\r\nthe door. The knocker fell sharply twice, and recalled them to\r\nrealities.\r\n\r\n“I—I must go,” she faltered, wresting herself from the spell of his\r\neyes. “I have said what I—I hope you understand, and I—it is time I\r\nwent.” How her heart was beating!\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I must go!”\r\n\r\nToo late! A loud voice in the passage, a heavy step, announced a\r\nvisitor. The door flew open, and there entered, pushing the startled\r\nmaid aside, the Honourable Bob Flixton, at the height of his glory,\r\nloud, impudent, and unabashed.\r\n\r\n“Run to earth, my lad!” he cried boisterously. “Run to earth! Run——”\r\n\r\nHe broke off, gaping, as his eyes fell upon poor Mary, who, in making\r\nway for him, had partly hidden herself behind the door. He whistled\r\nsoftly, in great amazement, and “Hope I don’t intrude,” he continued.\r\nAnd he grinned; while Vaughan, looking blackest thunder at him, could\r\nfind no words that were adequate. To think that this loud-voiced,\r\nconfident fool, the Don Giovanni of the regiment, had stumbled on his\r\npearl!\r\n\r\n“Well, well, well!” the Honourable Bob resumed, casting down his eyes\r\nas if he were shocked. And again: “I hope I don’t intrude,” he\r\ncontinued—it was the parrot cry of that year. “I didn’t know. I’ll take\r\nmyself off again”—he whistled low—“as fast as I can.”\r\n\r\nBut Vaughan felt that to let him go thus, to spread the tale with a\r\nthousand additions and innuendoes, was worst of all. “Wait, if you\r\nplease,” he said, with a note of sternness in his tone. “I am coming\r\nwith you, Flixton. Good-morning, Miss Smith.”\r\n\r\n“See here, won’t you introduce me?” cried the irrepressible Bob.\r\n\r\n“No!” Vaughan answered curtly, and without staying to reflect. “You\r\nwill kindly tell Miss Sibson, Miss Smith, that I am obliged, greatly\r\nobliged to her. Now come, Flixton! I have done my business, and we are\r\nnot wanted here.”\r\n\r\n“I come reluctantly,” said Bob, allowing himself to be dragged out, but\r\nnot until he had cast a last languishing look at the beauty. And on the\r\ndoorstep, “Sly dog, sly dog!” he said. “To think that in Bristol, where\r\npretty girls are as scarce as mushrooms in March, there should be such\r\nan angel! Damme, an angel! And you the discoverer. It beats all!”\r\n\r\n“Shut up,” Vaughan answered angrily. “You know nothing about it!” And\r\nthen, still more sourly, “See here, Flixton, I take it ill of you\r\nfollowing me here. It was too cool, I say.”\r\n\r\nBut the Honourable Bob was not quick to quarrel. “I saw you go in, dear\r\nchap,” he cried heartily. “I wanted to tell you that the hour of dinner\r\nwas changed. See? Did my own errand, and coming back thought I’d—truth\r\nwas, I fancied you’d some little game on hand.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing of the kind!”\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Bob stopped. “Honour bright? Honour bright?” he repeated\r\neagerly. “Mean to say, Vaughan, you’re not on the track of that little\r\nfilly?”\r\n\r\nVaughan scowled. “Not in the way you mean,” he said sternly. “You make\r\na mistake. She’s a good girl.”\r\n\r\nFlixton winked. “Heard that before, my lad,” he said, “more than once.\r\nFrom my grandmother. I’ll take my chance of that.”\r\n\r\nVaughan in his heart would have been glad to fall upon him and pommel\r\nhim. But there were objections to that course. On the other hand, his\r\nfeelings had cooled in the last few minutes, and he was far from\r\nprepared to announce offhand that he was going to marry the beauty. So\r\n“No, you will not, Flixton,” he said. “Let it go! Do you hear? The fact\r\nis,” he continued, in some embarrassment, “I’m in a sort of fiduciary\r\nrelation to the young lady, and—and I am not going to see her played\r\nwith. That’s the fact.”\r\n\r\n“Fiduciary relation?” the Honourable Bob retorted, in perplexity. “What\r\nthe deuce is that? Never heard of it! D’you mean, man, that you\r\nare—eh?—related to her? Of course, if so——”\r\n\r\n“No, I am not related to her.”\r\n\r\n“Then——”\r\n\r\n“But I’m not going to see her made a fool of, that’s all!”\r\n\r\nAn idea struck the Honourable Bob. He stared. “See here,” he said in a\r\ntone of horror, “you ain’t—you ain’t thinking of marrying her?”\r\n\r\nVaughan’s cheeks burned. “May be, and may be not,” he said curtly. “But\r\neither way, it is my business!”\r\n\r\n“But surely you’re not! Man alive!”\r\n\r\n“It is my business, I say!”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course, if it is as bad as that,” Flixton answered with\r\na grin. “But—hope I don’t intrude, Vaughan, but ain’t you making a bit\r\nof a fool of yourself? What’ll old Vermuyden say, eh?”\r\n\r\n“That’s my business too!” Vaughan answered haughtily.\r\n\r\n“Just so, just so; and quite enough for me. All I say is—if you are not\r\nin earnest yourself, don’t play the dog in the manger!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\nDON GIOVANNI FLIXTON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the political world the last week of April and the first week of May\r\nof that year were fraught with surprises. It is probable that they saw\r\nmore astonished people than are to be found in England in an ordinary\r\ntwelvemonth. The party which had monopolised power for half a century,\r\nand to that end and the advancement of themselves, their influence,\r\ntheir friends, and their dependants, had spent the public money,\r\nstrained the law, and supported the mob, were incredibly, nay, were\r\nbitterly surprised when they saw all these engines turned against them;\r\nwhen they found dependants falling off and friends growing cold; above\r\nall, when they found that rabble, which they had so often directed,\r\naiming its yells and brickbats against their windows.\r\n\r\nBut it is unlikely that any Tory of them all was more surprised by the\r\nchange in the political aspect than Arthur Vaughan—when he came to\r\nthink of it—by the position in which he had put himself. Certainly he\r\nhad taken no step that was not revocable. He had said nothing positive;\r\nhis honour was not engaged. But he had said a good deal. On the spur of\r\nthe moment, moved by the strange attraction which the girl had for him,\r\nhe had spoken after a fashion which only farther speech could justify.\r\nAnd then, not content with that, as if fortune were determined to make\r\nsport of his discretion, he had been led by another impulse—call it\r\ngenerosity, call it jealousy, call it what you will—to say more to Bob\r\nFlixton than he had said to her.\r\n\r\nHe had done this who had hitherto held himself a little above the\r\ncommon run of men. Who had chalked out his career and never doubted\r\nthat he had the strength to follow it. Who had not been content to\r\nwait, idle and dissipated, for a dead man’s shoes, but in the pride of\r\na mind which he believed to be the master of his passions had set his\r\nface towards the high prizes of the senate and the forum. He, who if he\r\ncould not be Fox, would be Erskine. Who would be anything, in a word,\r\nexcept the empty-headed man of pleasure, or the plain dullard satisfied\r\nto sit in a corner with a little.\r\n\r\nHe, who had planned such a future, now found himself on the brink—ay,\r\non the very point—of committing as foolish an act as the most\r\nthoughtless could commit. He was proposing to marry a girl below him in\r\nstation, still farther below him in birth, whom he had only known three\r\ndays, whom he had only seen three times! And all because she had\r\nbeautiful eyes, and looked at him—Heavens, how she had looked at him!\r\n\r\nHe went hot as he pictured her with her melting eyes, hanging towards\r\nhim a little as the ivy inclines to the oak. And then he turned cold.\r\nAnd cold, he considered what he was going to do!\r\n\r\nOf course he was not going to marry her.\r\n\r\nNo doubt he had said to her more than he had the right to say. But his\r\nhonour was not engaged. The girl was not the worse for him; even if\r\nthat which he had read in her eyes were true, she would get over it as\r\nquickly as he would. But marry her, give way to a feeling doubtless\r\nevanescent, let himself be swayed by a fancy at which he would laugh a\r\nyear later—no! No! He was not so weak. He had not only his career to\r\nthink of, but the family honours which would be his one day. What would\r\nold Vermuyden say if he impaled a baton sinister with the family arms,\r\nadded a Smith to the family alliances, married the nameless, penniless\r\nteacher in a girls’ school?\r\n\r\nNo, of course, he was not going to marry her. He had said what he had\r\nsaid to the Honourable Bob merely to shield her from a Don Juan. He had\r\nnot meant it. He would go for a long fatiguing walk and put the notion\r\nand the girl out of his head, and come back cured of his folly, and\r\nmake a merry night of it with the old set. And to-morrow—no, the morrow\r\nwas Sunday—on Monday he would return to London and to all the chances\r\nwhich the changing political situation must open to an ambitious man.\r\nHe regretted that he had not taken the Chancellor’s hint and sought for\r\na seat in the House.\r\n\r\nBut the solitary ramble in the valley of the Avon, which was a\r\nhundredfold more beautiful in those days than in these, because less\r\nspoiled by the hand of man, a ramble by the Logwood Mills, with their\r\nclear-running weedy stream, by King’s Weston and Leigh Woods—such a\r\nramble, tuneful with the songs of birds and laden with the scents of\r\nspring, may not be the surest cure for that passion, which\r\n\r\n_is not to be reasoned down or lost_\r\n\r\n_In high ambition or a thirst for greatness!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt any rate he returned uncured, and for the first part of the\r\nHonourable Bob’s dinner was wildly merry. After that, and suddenly, he\r\nfell into a moody silence which his host was not the last to note.\r\n\r\nFortunately with the removal of the cloth and the first brisk journey\r\nof the decanters came news. A waiter brought it. Hart Davies, the Tory\r\ncandidate for Bristol, and for twenty years its popular member, had\r\nwithdrawn, seeing his chance hopeless. The retirement was unexpected,\r\nand it caused so much surprise that the party could think of nothing\r\nelse. Nine-tenths of those present were Tories, and Flixton proposed\r\nthat they should sally forth and vent their feelings by smashing the\r\nwindows of the Bush, the Radical headquarters; a feat performed many a\r\ntime before with no worse consequences than a broken head or two. But\r\nColonel Brereton set his foot sharply on the proposal.\r\n\r\n“I’ll put you under arrest if you do,” he said. “I’m senior officer of\r\nthe district, and I’ll not have it, Flixton! Do you think that this is\r\nthe time, you madmen,” he continued, looking round the table and\r\nspeaking with indignation, “to provoke the rabble, and get the throats\r\nof half Bristol cut?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come, Colonel, it is not as bad as that!” Flixton remonstrated.\r\n\r\n“You don’t know how bad it is,” Brereton answered, his brooding eyes\r\nkindling. And he developed anew his fixed idea that the forces of\r\ndisorder, once provoked, were irresistible; that the country was at\r\ntheir mercy, and that only by humouring them, a course suggested also\r\nby humanity, could the storm be weathered.\r\n\r\nThe company consisted, for the most part, of reckless young subalterns\r\nflushed with wine. They listened out of respect to his rank, but they\r\nwinked and grinned behind his back; until, half conscious of ridicule,\r\nhe grew angry. On ordinary occasions Flixton would have been the worst\r\noffender. But he had the grace to remember that the Colonel was his\r\nguest, and he sought to turn the subject.\r\n\r\n“Come, come!” he cried, hammering the table and pushing the bottle.\r\n“Let the Colonel alone. For Heaven’s sake shelve the cursed Bill! I’m\r\nsick of it! It’s the death of all fun and jollity. I’ll give you a\r\nsentiment: ‘The Fair when they are Kind, and the Kind when they are\r\nFair.’ Fill up! Fill up, all, and drink it!”\r\n\r\nThey echoed the toast in various tones, sober or fuddled. And some\r\nbegan to grow excited. A glass was shattered and flung noisily into the\r\nfire. A new one was called for, also noisily.\r\n\r\n“Now, Bill,” Flixton continued to his right-hand neighbour, “it’s your\r\nturn! Give us something spicy!” And he hammered the table. “Captain\r\nCodrington’s sentiment.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s have a minute!” pleaded the gentleman assailed.\r\n\r\n“Not a minute,” boisterously. “See, the table’s waiting for you!\r\nCaptain Codrington’s sentiment!”\r\n\r\nMen of small genius kept a written list, and committed some lines to\r\nmemory before dinner. The Captain was one of these. But the call on him\r\nwas sudden, and he sought, with an agonised mind, for one which would\r\nseem in the least degree novel. At last, with a sigh of relief, “_Maids\r\nand Missuses!_” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, Maids and Missuses!” the Honourable Bob echoed, raising his\r\nglass. “And especially,” he whispered, calling his neighbour’s\r\nattention to Vaughan by a shove, “schoolmissuses! Schoolmissuses, my\r\nlad! Here, Vaughan,” he continued aloud, “you must drink this, and no\r\nheeltaps!”\r\n\r\nVaughan caught his name and awoke from a reverie. “Very good,” he said,\r\nraising his glass. “What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Maids and Missuses!” the Honourable Bob replied, with a wink at his\r\nneighbour. And then, incited by the fumes of the wine he had taken, he\r\nrose to his feet and raised his glass. “Gentlemen,” he said,\r\n“gentlemen!”\r\n\r\n“Silence,” they cried. “Silence! Silence for Bob’s speech.”\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he resumed, a spark of malice in his eyes, “I’ve a piece\r\nof news to give you! It’s news that—that’s been mighty slyly kept by a\r\ngentleman here present. Devilish close he’s kept it, I’ll say that for\r\nhim! But he’s a neat hand that can bamboozle Bob Flixton, and I’ve run\r\nhim to earth, run him to earth this morning and got it out of him.”\r\n\r\n“Hear! Hear! Bob! Go on, Bob; what is it?” from the company.\r\n\r\n“You are going to hear, my Trojans! And no flam! Gentlemen, charge your\r\nglasses! I’ve the honour to inform you that our old friend and\r\ntiptopper, Arthur Vaughan, otherwise the Counsellor, has got himself\r\nregularly put up, knocked down, and sold to as pretty a piece of the\r\nfeminine as you’ll see in a twelvemonth! Prettiest in Bristol, ’pon\r\nhonour,” with feeling, “be the other who she may! Regular case of—” and\r\nin irresistibly comic accents, with his head and glass alike tilted, he\r\ndrolled,\r\n\r\n“_There first for thee my passion grew_,\r\n\r\n_Sweet, sweet Matilda Pottingen;_\r\n\r\n_Thou wast the daughter of my tu_-\r\n\r\n_tor, law professor at the U_-\r\n\r\n_niversity of Göttingen!_\r\n\r\n\r\n’Niversity of Göttingen! Don’t laugh, gentlemen! It’s so! He’s entered\r\non the waybill, book through to matrimony, and”—the Honourable Bob was\r\nundoubtedly a little tipsy—“and it only remains for us to give him a\r\ngood send-off. So charge your glasses, and——”\r\n\r\nBrereton laid his hand on his arm. He was sober and he did not like the\r\nlook on Vaughan’s disgusted face. “One moment, Flixton,” he said; “is\r\nthis true, Mr. Vaughan?”\r\n\r\nVaughan’s brow was as black as thunder. He had never dreamt that, drunk\r\nor sober, Flixton would be guilty of such a breach of confidence. He\r\nhesitated. Then, “No!” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s not true?” Codrington struck in. “You are not going to be\r\nmarried, old chap?”\r\n\r\n“No!”\r\n\r\n“But, man,” Flixton hiccoughed, “you told me so—or something like\r\nit—-only this morning.”\r\n\r\n“You either misunderstood me,” Vaughan answered, in a tone so distinct\r\nas to be menacing, “for you have said far more than I said. Or, if you\r\nprefer it, I’ve changed my mind. In either case it is my business! And\r\nI’ll trouble you to leave it alone!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you put it—that way, old chap?”\r\n\r\n“I do put it that way!”\r\n\r\n“And any way,” Brereton said, interposing hurriedly, “this is no time\r\nfor marrying! I’ve told you boys before, and I tell you again——”\r\n\r\nAnd he plunged into a fresh argument on the old point. Two or three\r\njoined issue, grinning. And Vaughan, as soon as attention was diverted\r\nfrom him, slipped away.\r\n\r\nHe was horribly disgusted, and sunk very low in his own eyes. He\r\nloathed what he had done. He had not, indeed, been false to the girl,\r\nfor he had given her no promise. He had not denied her, for her name\r\nhad not been mentioned. And he had not gone back on his resolution, for\r\nhe had never formed one seriously. Yet in a degree he had done all\r\nthese things. He had played a shabby part by himself and by the girl.\r\nHe had been meanly ashamed of her. And though his conduct had followed\r\nthe lines which he had marked out for himself, he hoped that he might\r\nnever again feel so unhappy, and so poor a thing, as he felt as he\r\nwalked the streets and cursed his discretion.\r\n\r\nDiscretion! Cowardice was the right name for it. Because the girl, the\r\nmost beautiful, pure, and gentle creature on whom his eyes had ever\r\nrested, was called Mary Smith, and taught in a school, he disavowed her\r\nand turned his back on her.\r\n\r\nHe did not know that he was suffering what a man, whose mind has so far\r\ngoverned his heart, must suffer when the latter rebels. In planning his\r\nlife he had ignored his heart; now he must pay the penalty. He went to\r\nbed at last, but not to sleep. Instead he lived the scene over and over\r\nagain, now wondering what he ought to have done; now brooding on what\r\nFlixton must think of him; now on what she, whose nature, he was sure,\r\nwas as perfect as her face, would think of him, if she knew. How she\r\nwould despise him!\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday, and he spent it, in accordance with a previous\r\npromise, with Brereton, at his pleasant home at Newchurch, a mile from\r\nthe city. Though the most recent of his Bristol acquaintances, Brereton\r\nwas the most congenial; and a dozen times Vaughan was on the point of\r\nconfiding his trouble to him. He was deterred by the melancholy cast of\r\nBrereton’s character, which gave promise of no decisive advice. And\r\nearly in the evening he took leave of his host and strolled towards the\r\nDowns, balancing _I would_ against _I will not_; now facing the bleak\r\nof a prudent decision, now thrilling with foolish rapture, as he\r\npondered another event. Lord Eldon had married young and with as little\r\nprudence; it had not impeded his rise, nor Erskine’s. Doubtless Sir\r\nRobert Vermuyden would say that he had disgraced himself; but he cared\r\nlittle for that. What he had to combat was the more personal pride of\r\nthe man who, holding himself a little wiser than his fellows, cannot\r\nbear to do a thing that in the eyes of the foolish may set him below\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nOf course he came to no decision; though he wandered on Brandon Hill\r\nuntil the Float at his feet ceased to mirror the lights, and Bristol\r\nlay dark below him. And Monday found him still hesitating. Thrice he\r\nstarted to take his place on the coach. And thrice he turned back,\r\nhating himself for his weakness. If he could not overcome a foolish\r\nfancy, how could he hope to scale the heights of the Western Circuit,\r\nor hurl Coleridge and Follett from their pride of place? Or, still\r\nharder task, how would he dare to confront in the House the cold eye of\r\nCroker or of Goulburn? No, he could not hope to do either. He had been\r\nwrong in his estimate of himself. He was a poor creature, unable to\r\nhold his own amongst his fellows, impotent to guide his own life!\r\n\r\nHe was still contesting the matter when, a little before noon, he\r\nespied Flixton in the act of threading his way through the busy crowd\r\nof Broad Street. The Honourable Bob was wearing hessians, and a\r\nhigh-collared green riding-coat, with an orange vest and a soft\r\nmany-folded cravat. In fine, he was so smart that suspicion entered\r\nVaughan’s head; and on its heels—jealousy.\r\n\r\nIn a twinkling he was on Flixton’s track. Broad Street, the heart of\r\nBristol, was thronged, for Hart Davies’s withdrawal was in the air and\r\nan election crowd was abroad. Newsboys with their sheets, tipsy\r\nward-leaders, and gossiping merchants jostled one another. The beau’s\r\ngreen coat, however, shone conspicuous,\r\n\r\n_Glorious was his course_,\r\n\r\n_And long the track of light he left behind him!_\r\n\r\n\r\nand before Vaughan had asked himself if he were justified in following,\r\npursued and pursuer were over Bristol Bridge, and making, by way of the\r\nWelsh Back—a maze of coal-hoys and dangling cranes—for Queen’s Square.\r\n\r\nVaughan doubted no longer, weighed the propriety of his course no\r\nlonger. For a cool-headed man of the world, who asked nothing better\r\nthan to master a silly fancy, he was foolishly perturbed. He made on\r\nwith a grim face; but a dray loading at a Newport coal-hulk drew across\r\nhis path, and Flixton was pacing under the pleasant elms and amid the\r\ngroups that loitered up and down the sunlit Square, before Vaughan came\r\nwithin hail, and called him by name.\r\n\r\nFlixton turned then, saw who it was, and grinned—nothing abashed.\r\n“Well,” he said, tipping his hat a little to one side, “well, old chap!\r\nAre you let out of school too?”\r\n\r\nVaughan had already discovered Mary Smith and her little troop under\r\nthe trees in the farthest corner. But he tried to smile—and did so, a\r\nlittle awry. “This is not fair play, Flixton,” he said.\r\n\r\n“That is just what I think it is,” the Honourable Bob answered\r\ncheerfully. “Eh, old chap? Neat trick of yours the other day, but not\r\nneat enough! Thought to bamboozle me and win a clear field! Neat! But\r\nno go, I found you out and now it is my turn. That’s what I call fair\r\nplay.”\r\n\r\n“Look here, Flixton,” Vaughan replied—he was fast losing his\r\ncomposure—“I’m not going to have it. That’s plain.”\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Bob stared. “Oh!” he answered. “Let’s understand one\r\nanother. Are you going to marry the girl after all?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve told you——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you’ve told me, yes, and you’ve told me, no. The question is,\r\nwhich is it?”\r\n\r\nVaughan controlled himself. He could see Mary out of the corner of his\r\neye, and knew that she had not yet taken the alarm. But the least\r\nviolence might attract her attention. “Whichever it be,” he said\r\nfirmly, “is no business of yours.”\r\n\r\n“If you claim the girl——”\r\n\r\n“I do not claim her, Flixton. I have told you that. But——”\r\n\r\n“But you mean to play the dog in the manger?”\r\n\r\n“I mean to see,” Vaughan replied sternly, “that you don’t do her any\r\nharm.”\r\n\r\nFlixton hesitated. Secretly he held Vaughan in respect; and he would\r\nhave postponed his visit to Queen’s Square had he foreseen that that\r\ngentleman would detect him. But to retreat now was another matter. The\r\nduel was still in vogue; barely two years before the Prime Minister had\r\ngone out with a brother peer in Battersea Fields; barely twenty years\r\nbefore one Cabinet Minister had shot another on Wimbledon Common. He\r\ncould not, therefore, afford to show the white feather, and though he\r\nhesitated, it was not for long. “You mean to see to that, do you?” he\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“Then come and see,” he returned flippantly. “I’m going to have a chat\r\nwith the young lady now. That’s not murder, I suppose?” And he turned\r\non his heel and strolled across the turf towards the group of which\r\nMary was the centre.\r\n\r\nVaughan followed with black looks; and when Mary Smith, informed of\r\ntheir approach by one of the children, turned a startled face towards\r\nthem, he was at Flixton’s shoulder, and pressing before him.\r\n\r\nBut the Honourable Bob had the largest share of presence of mind, and\r\nhe was the first to speak. “Miss Smith,” he said, raising his hat with\r\n_aplomb_, “I—you remember me, I am sure?”\r\n\r\nVaughan pushed before him; and before the girl could speak—for jealousy\r\nis a fine spoiler of manners, “This gentleman,” he said, “wishes to\r\nsee——”\r\n\r\n“To see——” said Flixton, with a lower bow.\r\n\r\n“Miss Sibson!” Vaughan exclaimed.\r\n\r\nThe children stared; gazing up into the men’s faces with the\r\nundisguised curiosity of childhood. Fortunately the Mary Smith who had\r\nto confront these two was no longer the Mary Smith whom Vaughan’s\r\nappearance had stricken with panic three days before. For one thing,\r\nshe knew Miss Sibson better, and feared her less. For another, her\r\nfairy godmother—the gleam of whose gifts never failed to leave a hope\r\nof change, a prospect of something other than the plodding, endless\r\nround—had shown a fresh sign. And last, not least, a more potent fairy,\r\na fairy whose wand had power to turn Miss Sibson’s house into a Palace\r\nBeautiful, and Queen’s Square, with its cawing rooks and ordered elms,\r\ninto an enchanted forest, had visited her.\r\n\r\nTrue, Vaughan had left her abruptly—to cool her burning cheeks and\r\nstill her heart as she best might! But he had said what she would never\r\nforget, and though he had left her doubting, he had left her loving.\r\nAnd so the Mary who found herself addressed by two gallants was much\r\nless abashed than she who on Friday had had to do with one.\r\n\r\nStill she was astonished by their address; and she showed this,\r\nmodestly and quietly. “If you wish to see Miss Sibson,” she\r\nsaid—instinctively she looked at Vaughan’s companion—“I will send for\r\nher.” And she was in the act of turning, with comparative ease, to\r\ndespatch one of the children on the errand, when the Honourable Bob\r\ninterposed.\r\n\r\n“But we don’t want Miss Sibson—now,” he said. “A man may change his\r\nmind as well as a woman! Eh, old chap?” turning to his friend with\r\nsimulated good-humour. “I’m sure you will say so, Miss Smith.”\r\n\r\nShe wondered what their odd manner to one another meant. And, to add to\r\nher dignity, she laid her hand on the shoulder of one of her charges\r\nand drew her closer.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, I’m sure,” Flixton continued—for Vaughan after his first\r\nhasty intervention, stood sulkily silent—“I’m sure Mr. Vaughan will\r\nagree with me——”\r\n\r\n“I?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes he will, Miss Smith, because he is the most changeable of men\r\nhimself! A weathercock, upon my honour!” And he pointed to the tower of\r\nSt. Mary, which from the high ground of Redcliffe Parade on the farther\r\nside of the water, looks down on the Square. “Never of the same mind\r\ntwo days together!”\r\n\r\nVaughan snubbed him savagely. “Be good enough to leave me out!” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“There!” the Honourable Bob answered, laughing, “he wants to stop my\r\nmouth! But I’m not to be stopped. Of all men he’s the least right to\r\nsay that I mustn’t change my mind. Why, if you’ll believe me, Miss\r\nSmith, no farther back than Saturday morning he was all for being\r\nmarried! ’Pon honour! Went away from here talking of nothing else! In\r\nthe evening he was just as dead the other way! Nothing was farther from\r\nhis thoughts. Shuddered at the very idea! Come, old chap, don’t look\r\nfierce!” And he grinned at Vaughan. “You can’t deny it!”\r\n\r\nVaughan could have struck him; the trick was so neat and so malicious.\r\nFortunately a man who had approached the group touched Vaughan’s elbow\r\nat this critical moment, and diverted his wrath. “Express for you,\r\nsir,” he said. “Brought by chaise, been looking for you everywhere,\r\nsir!”\r\n\r\nVaughan smothered the execration which rose to his lips, snatched the\r\nletter from the man, and waved him aside. Then, swelling with rage, he\r\nturned upon Flixton. But before he could speak the matter was taken out\r\nof his hands.\r\n\r\n“Children,” said Mary Smith in a clear, steady voice, “it is time we\r\nwent in. The hour is up, collect your hoops. I think,” she continued,\r\nlooking stiffly at the Honourable Bob, “you have addressed me under a\r\nmisapprehension, sir, intending to address yourself to Miss Sibson.\r\nGood-morning! Good-morning!” with a slight and significant bow which\r\nincluded both gentlemen. And taking a child by either hand, she turned\r\nher back on them, and with her little flock clustering about her, and\r\nher pretty head held high, she went slowly across the road to the\r\nschool. Her lips were trembling, but the men could not see that. And\r\nher heart was bursting, but only she knew that.\r\n\r\nWithout that knowledge Vaughan was furiously angry. It was not only\r\nthat the other had got the better of him by a sly trick; but he was\r\nconscious that he had shown himself at his worst—stupid when\r\ntongue-tied, and rude when he spoke. Still, he controlled himself until\r\nMary was out of earshot, and then he turned upon Flixton.\r\n\r\n“What right—what right,” he snarled, “had you to say what I would do!\r\nAnd what I would not do? I consider your conduct——”\r\n\r\n“Steady, man!” Flixton, who was much the cooler of the two, said. He\r\nwas a little pale. “Think before you speak. You would interfere. What\r\ndid you expect? That I was going to play up to you?”\r\n\r\n“I expected at least——”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, you can tell me another time what you expected. I have an\r\nengagement now and must be going,” the Honourable Bob said. “See you\r\nagain!” And with a cool nod he turned on his heel, and assured that,\r\nwhatever came of the affair, he had had the best of that bout, he\r\nstrode off.\r\n\r\nVaughan was only too well aware of the same fact; and but that he held\r\nhimself in habitual control, he would have followed and struck his\r\nrival. As it was, he stood a moment looking blackly after him. Then,\r\nsobered somewhat, though still bitterly chagrined, he took his way\r\ntowards his hotel, carrying in his oblivious hand the letter which had\r\nbeen given him. Once he halted, half-minded to return to Miss Sibson’s\r\nand to see Mary and explain. He took, indeed, some steps in the\r\nbackward direction. But he reflected that if he went he must speak, and\r\nplainly. And, angry as he was, furiously in love as he was, was he\r\nprepared to speak?\r\n\r\nHe was not prepared. And while he stood doubting between that eternal\r\nwould, and would not, his eyes fell on the letter in his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\nA ROTTEN BOROUGH\r\n\r\n\r\nChippinge, Sir Robert Vermuyden’s borough, was in no worse case than\r\ntwo-thirds of the small boroughs of that day. Still, of its great men\r\nCowley might have written:\r\n\r\n_Nothing they but dust can show,\r\nOr bones that hasten to be so._\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd of its greatness he might have said the same. The one and the other\r\nbelonged to the past.\r\n\r\nThe town occupies a low, green hill, dividing two branches of the Avon\r\nwhich join their waters a furlong below. Built on the ridge and\r\nclinging to the slopes of this eminence the stone-tiled houses look\r\npleasantly over the gentle undulations of the Wiltshire pastures—no\r\npastures more green; and at a distance are pleasantly seen from them.\r\nBut viewed more closely—at the date of which we write—the picturesque\r\nin the scene became mean or incongruous. Of the Mitred Abbey that\r\ncrowned the hill and had once owned these fertile slopes there remained\r\nbut the maimed hulk, patched and botched, and long degraded to the uses\r\nof that parish church its neighbour, of which nothing but the steeple\r\nsurvived. The crown-shaped market cross, once a dream of beauty in\r\nstone, still stood, but battered and defaced; while the Abbot’s\r\ngateway, under which sovereigns had walked, was sunk to a vile lock-up,\r\nthe due corrective of the tavern which stood cheek by jowl with it.\r\n\r\nStill, to these relics, grouped as they were upon an open triangular\r\ngreen, the hub of the town, there clung in spite of all some shadow of\r\ngreatness. The stranger whose eye fell on the doorway of the Abbey\r\nChurch, with its whorls of sculptured images, gazed and gazed again\r\nwith a sense of wondering awe. But let him turn his back on these\r\nbuildings, and his eye met, in cramped street and blind alley, a lower\r\ndepth. Everywhere were things once fine, sunk to base uses; old stone\r\nmansions converted into tenements; the solid houses of mediæval\r\nburghers into crazy taverns; fretted cloisters into pigsties and\r\nhovels; a Gothic arch propped the sagging flank of a lath-and-plaster\r\nstable. Or if anything of the beauty of a building survived, it was\r\nmasked by climbing penthouses; or, like the White Lion, the old inn\r\nwhich had been the Abbot’s guesthouse, it was altered out of all\r\nlikeness to its former self. For the England of ’31, gross and\r\nmatter-of-fact, was not awake to the value of those relics of a noble\r\npast which generations of intolerance had hurried to decay.\r\n\r\nDoubtless in this mouldering, dusty shell was snug, warm living.\r\nGeorgian comfort had outlived the wig and the laced coat, and though\r\nthe influence of the Church was at its lowest ebb, and morals were not\r\nmuch higher, inns were plenty and flourished, and in the panelled\r\nparlours of the White Lion or the Heart and Hand was much good eating,\r\nfollowed by deep drinking. The London road no longer passed through the\r\ntown; the great fair had fallen into disuse. But the cloth trade, by\r\nwhich Chippinge had once thriven, had been revived, and the town was\r\nnot quite fallen. Still, of all its former glories, it retained but one\r\nintact. It returned two members to Parliament. That which Birmingham\r\nand Sheffield had not, this little borough of eighteen hundred souls\r\nenjoyed. Fallen in all other points, it retained, or rather its High\r\nSteward, Sir Robert Vermuyden, retained the right of returning, by the\r\nvotes of its Alderman and twelve capital burgesses, two members to the\r\nCommons’ House.\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Robert could not by any stretch of fancy bring himself to\r\nbelieve that the town would willingly part with this privilege. Why\r\nshould it strip itself? he argued. It enjoyed the honour vicariously,\r\nindeed. But did he not year by year pay the Alderman and eight of the\r\ncapital burgesses thirty pounds apiece for their interest, a sum which\r\nquickly filtered through their pockets and enriched the town, besides\r\ntaking several of the voters off the rates? Did he not also at election\r\ntimes set the taps running and distribute a moderate largesse among the\r\ncommonalty, and—and in fact do everything which it behoved a liberal\r\nand enlightened patron to do? Nay, had he not, since his accession,\r\nraised the status of the voters, long and vulgarly known as “The\r\nCripples,” so that they, who in his father’s time had been, almost\r\nwithout exception, drunken illiterates, were now to the extent of at\r\nleast one half, men of respectable position?\r\n\r\nNo, Sir Robert wholly declined to believe that Chippinge had any wish\r\nfor a change so adverse to its interests. The most he would admit was\r\nthat there might be some slight disaffection in the place, due to that\r\nconfounded Bowood, which was for ever sapping and mining and seeking to\r\nrob its neighbours.\r\n\r\nBut even he was presently to be convinced that there was a very odd\r\nspirit abroad in this year ’31. The new police and the new steam\r\nrailways and this cholera of which people were beginning to talk, were\r\nnot the only new things. There were new ideas in the air; and the birds\r\nseemed to carry them. They took possession not only of the troublesome\r\nand discontented—poachers whom Sir Robert had gaoled, or the sons of\r\nmen whom his father had pressed—but of the most unlikely people. Backs\r\nthat had never been aught but pliant grew stiff. Men who had put up\r\nwith the old system for more years than they could remember grew\r\nrestive. Others, who had all their lives stood by while their inferiors\r\nruled the roost, discovered that they had rights. Nay—and this was the\r\nstrangest thing of all—some who had thriven by the old management and\r\ncould not hope to gain by a change revolted, after the fashion of Dyas\r\nthe butcher, and proved the mastery of mind over matter. Not many,\r\nindeed, these; martyrs for ideas are rare. But their action went for\r\nmuch, and when later the great mass of the voteless began to move,\r\nthere were rats in plenty of the kind that desert sinking ships. By\r\nthat time he was a bold man who in tavern or workshop spoke for the\r\nrule of the few, to which Sir Robert fondly believed his borough to be\r\nloyal.\r\n\r\nHis agent had never shared that belief, fortunately for him; or he had\r\nhad a rude awakening on the first Monday in May. It was customary for\r\nthe Vermuyden interest to meet the candidates on the Chippenham road,\r\nhalf an hour before the dinner hour, and to attend them in procession\r\nthrough the town to the White Lion. Often this was all that the\r\ncommonalty saw of an election, and a little horseplay was both expected\r\nand allowed. In old days, when the “Cripples” had belonged to the very\r\nlowest class, their grotesque appearance in the van of the gentlemanly\r\ninterest had given rise to many a home-jest. The crowd would follow\r\nthem, jeering and laughing, and there would be some pushing, and a\r\ndrunken man or two would fall. But all had passed in good humour; the\r\ntaps had been running in one interest, the ale was Sir Robert’s, and\r\nthe crowd envied while they laughed.\r\n\r\nWhite, as he stood on the bridge reviewing the first comers, wished he\r\nmight have no worse to expect to-day. But he did not hope as much. The\r\ntown was crowded, and the streets down to the bridge were so cumbered\r\nwith moving groups that it was plain the procession would have to push\r\nits way. For certain, too, many of the people did not belong to\r\nChippinge. With the townsfolk White knew he could deal. He did not\r\nbelieve that there was a Chippinge man who, eye to eye with him, would\r\ncast a stone. But here were yokels from Calne and Bowood, who knew not\r\nSir Robert; with Bristol lambs and men as dangerous, and not a few\r\nRadicals from a distance, rabid with zeal and overflowing with\r\npromises. Made up of such elements the crowd hooted from time to time,\r\nand there was a threat in the sound that filled White with misgivings.\r\n\r\nNor was this the worst. The cloth factory stood close to the bridge.\r\nThe procession must pass it. And the hands employed in it, hostile to a\r\nman, were gathered before the doorway, in their aprons and paper caps,\r\nwaiting to give the show a reception. They had much to say already,\r\ntheir jeers and taunts filling the air; but White had a shrewd\r\nsuspicion that they had worse missiles in their pockets.\r\n\r\nStill, he had secured the attendance of a score of sturdy fellows, sons\r\nof Sir Robert’s farmers, and these, with a proportion of the tagrag and\r\nbobtail of the town, gave a fairly solid aspect to his party. Nor was\r\nthe jeering all on one side, though that deep and unpleasant groaning\r\nwhich now and again rolled down the street was wholly Whiggish.\r\n\r\nAlas, it was when the agent came to analyse his men that he had most\r\nneed of the smile that deceives. True, the rector was there and the\r\ncurate of Eastport, and the clerk and the sexton—the two last-named\r\nwere voters. And there were also four or five squires arrayed in\r\nsupport of the gentlemanly interest, and as many young bucks come to\r\nsee the fun. Then there were three other voters: the Alderman, who was\r\na small grocer, and Annibal the basketmaker—these two were\r\nstalwarts—and Dewell the barber, also staunch, but a timid man. There\r\nwas no Dyas, however, Sir Robert’s burliest supporter in old days, and\r\nhis absence was marked. Nor any Thrush the pig-killer—the jaws of a\r\nRadical gaol held him. Nor, last and heaviest blow of all—for it had\r\nfallen without warning—was there any Pillinger of the Blue Duck.\r\nPillinger, his wife said, was ill. What was worse he was in the hands\r\nof a Radical doctor capable, the agent believed, of hocussing him until\r\nthe polling was over. The truth about Pillinger—whether he lay ill or\r\nwhether he lay shamming, whether he was at the mercy of the apothecary\r\nor under the thumb of his wife—White could not learn. He hoped to learn\r\nit before it was too late. But for the present Pillinger was not here.\r\n\r\nThe Alderman, Annibal, Dewell, the clerk, the sexton, and Arthur\r\nVaughan. White totted them up again and again and made them six. The\r\nBowood voters he made five—four stalwarts and Dyas the butcher.\r\n\r\nCertainly he might still poll Pillinger. But, on the other hand, Mr.\r\nVaughan might arrive too late. White had written to his address in\r\ntown, and receiving no answer had sent an express to Bristol on the\r\nchance that the young gentleman was still there. Probably he would be\r\nin time. But when things are so very close—and when there were alarm\r\nand defeat in the air—men grow nervous. White smiled as he chatted with\r\nthe pompous Rector and the country squires, but he was very anxious. He\r\nthought of old Sir Robert at Stapylton, and he sweated at the notion of\r\ndefeat. Cobbett had reached his mind, but Sir Robert had his heart!\r\n\r\n“Boo!” moaned the crowd higher up the street. The sound sank and the\r\nharsh voice of a speaker came fitfully over the heads of the people.\r\n\r\n“Who’s that?” asked old Squire Rowley, one of the country gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“Some spouter from Bristol, sir, I fancy,” the agent replied\r\ncontemptuously. And with his eye he whipped in a couple of hobbledehoys\r\nwho seemed inclined to stray towards the enemy.\r\n\r\n“I suppose,” the Squire continued, lowering his voice, “you can depend\r\non your men, White?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Lord, yes, sir,” White answered; like a good election agent he\r\ntook no one into his confidence. “We’ve enough here to do the trick.\r\nBesides, young Mr. Vaughan will be here to-morrow, and the landlord of\r\nthe Blue Duck, who is not well enough to walk to-day, will poll. He’d\r\nbreak his heart, bless you,” White continued, with a brow of brass, “if\r\nhe could not vote for Sir Robert!”\r\n\r\n“Seven to five.”\r\n\r\n“Seven to four, sir.”\r\n\r\n“But Dyas, I hear, the d——d rogue, will vote against you?”\r\n\r\nWhite winked.\r\n\r\n“Bad,” he said cryptically, “but not as bad as that, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! oh!” quoth the other, nodding, “I see.” And then, glancing at the\r\ngang before the cloth works, whose taunts of “Flunkies!” and “Sell your\r\nbirthright, will you?” were constant and vicious, “You’ve no fear\r\nthere’ll be violence, White?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Lord, no, sir,” White answered; “you know what election rows are, all\r\nbark and no bite!”\r\n\r\n“Still I hear that at Bath, where I’m told Lord Brecknock stands a poor\r\nchance, they are afraid of a riot.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay, sir,” White answered indifferently, “this isn’t Bath.”\r\n\r\n“Precisely,” the Rector struck in, in pompous tones. “I should like to\r\nsee anything of that kind here! They would soon,” he continued with an\r\nair, “find that I am not on the commission of the peace for nothing! I\r\nshall make, and I am sure you will make,” he went on, turning to his\r\nbrother justice, “very short work of them! I should like to see\r\nanything of that kind tried here!”\r\n\r\nWhite nodded, but in his heart he thought that his reverence was likely\r\nto have his wish gratified. However, no more was said, for the approach\r\nof the Stapylton carriages, with their postillions, outriders and\r\nfavours, was signalled by persons who had been placed to watch for\r\nthem, and the party on the bridge, falling into violent commotion,\r\nraised their flags and banners and hastened to form an escort on either\r\nside of the roadway. As the gaily-decked carriages halted on the crest\r\nof the bridge, loud greetings were exchanged. The five voters took up a\r\nposition of honour, seats in the carriages were found for three or four\r\nof the more important gentry, and seven or eight others got to horse.\r\nMeanwhile those of the smaller folk, who thought that they had a claim\r\nto the recognition of the candidates, were gratified, and stood back\r\nblushing, or being disappointed stood back glowering; all this amid\r\nconfusion and cheering on the bridge and shrill jeers on the part of\r\nthe cloth hands. Then the flags were waved aloft, the band of five, of\r\nwhich the drummer could truly say “_Pars magna fui_,” struck up “See,\r\nthe Conquering Hero Comes!” and White stood back for a last look.\r\n\r\nThen, “Shout, lads, shout!” he cried, waving his hat. “Don’t let ’em\r\nhave it all their own way!” And with a roar of defiance, not quite so\r\nloud or full as the gentlemanly interest had raised of old, the\r\nprocession got under way, and, led by a banner bearing “Our Ancient\r\nConstitution!” in blue letters on a red ground, swayed spasmodically up\r\nthe street. The candidates for the suffrages of the electors of\r\nChippinge had passed the threshold of the borough. “Hurrah! Yah!\r\nHurrah! Yah! Yah! Yah! Down with the Borough-mongers. Our Ancient\r\nConstitution! Hurrah! Boo! Boo!”\r\n\r\nWhite had his eye on the clothmen, and under its spell they did not go\r\nbeyond hooting and an egg or two, spared from the polling day, and\r\nflung at long range when the Tories had passed. No one was struck, and\r\nthe carriages moved onward, more or less triumphantly. Sergeant Wathen,\r\nwho was in the first, and whose sharp black eyes moved hither and\r\nthither in search of friends, rose repeatedly to bow. But Mr. Cooke,\r\nwho did not forget that he was paying two thousand five hundred pounds\r\nfor his seat, and thought that it should be a soft one, scarcely\r\ndeigned to move. For as the procession advanced into the town the\r\nclamour of the crowd which lined the narrow High Street and continually\r\nshouted “The Bill! The Bill!” drowned the utmost efforts of Sir\r\nRobert’s friends, and left no doubt of the popular feeling.\r\n\r\nThere was some good-humoured pushing and thrusting, the drum beating\r\nand the church bells jangling bravely above the hubbub. And once or\r\ntwice the rabble came near to cutting the procession in two. But there\r\nwas no real attempt at mischief, and all went well until the foremost\r\ncarriage was abreast of the Cross, which stands at the head of the High\r\nStreet, where the latter debouches into the space before the Abbey.\r\n\r\nThen some foolish person gave the word to halt before Dyas the\r\nbutcher’s. And a voice—it was not White’s—cried, “Three groans for the\r\nRadical Rat! Rat! Rat!”\r\n\r\nThe groans were given before the crowd fully understood their meaning\r\nor the motive for the stoppage. The drummer beat out something which he\r\nmeant for the Rogues’ March, and an unseen hand raising a large dead\r\nrat, tied to a stick, waved it before the butcher’s first-floor\r\nwindows.\r\n\r\nThe effect was surprising—to old-fashioned folk. In a twinkling, with a\r\nshout of “Down with the Borough-mongers!” a gang of white-aproned\r\nclothmen rushed the rear of the procession, drove it in upon the main\r\nbody, and amid screams and uproar forced the whole line out of the\r\nnarrow street into the space before the Abbey. Fortunately the White\r\nLion, which faced the Abbey, stood only a score of paces to the left of\r\nthe Cross, and the carriages were able to reach it; but in disorder,\r\npressed on by such a fighting, swaying, shouting crowd as Chippinge had\r\nnot seen for many a year.\r\n\r\nIt was no time to stand on dignity. The candidates tumbled out as best\r\nthey could, their chief supporters followed them, and while half a\r\ndozen single combats proceeded at their elbows, they hastened across\r\nthe pavement into the house. The Rector alone disdained to flee. Once\r\non the threshold of the inn, he turned and raised his hat above his\r\nhead:\r\n\r\n“Order!” he cried, “Order! Do you hear me!”\r\n\r\nBut “Yah! Borough-monger!” the rabble answered, and before he could say\r\nmore a young farmer was hurled against him, and a whip, of which a\r\npostillion had just been despoiled, whizzed past his head. He, too,\r\nturned tail at that, with his face a shade paler than usual; and with\r\nhis retreat resistance ceased. The carriages were hustled somehow and\r\nanyhow into the yard, and there the greater part of the procession also\r\ntook refuge. A few, sad to say, sneaked off and got rid of their\r\nbadges, and a few more escaped through a neighbouring alley. No one was\r\nmuch hurt; a few black eyes were the worst of the mischief, nor could\r\nit be said that any vindictive feeling was shown. But the town was\r\nswept clear, and the victory of the Radicals was complete. Left in\r\npossession of the open space before the Abbey, they paraded for some\r\ntime under the windows of the White Lion, waving a captured flag, and\r\ncheering and groaning by turns.\r\n\r\nMeantime in the hall of the inn the grandees were smoothing their\r\nruffled plumes, in a state of mind in which it was hard to say whether\r\nindignation or astonishment had larger place. Oaths flew thick as hail,\r\nunrebuked by the Church, the most outspoken perhaps being by the\r\nlandlord, who met them with a pale face.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord, good Lord, gentlemen!” he said, “what violence! What\r\nviolence! What are we coming to next? What’s took the people,\r\ngentlemen? Isn’t Sir Robert here?”\r\n\r\nFor to this simple person it seemed impossible that people should\r\nbehave badly in that presence.\r\n\r\n“No, he’s not!” Mr. Cooke answered with choler. “I’d like to know why\r\nhe’s not! I wish to Heaven”—only he did not say “Heaven”—“that he were\r\nhere, and he’d see what sort of thing he has let us into!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, ah, well!” returned the more discreet and philosophic\r\nSergeant, “shouting breaks no bones. We are all here, I hope? And after\r\nall, this shows up the Bill in a pretty strong light, eh, Rector? If it\r\nis to be carried by methods such as these—these—”\r\n\r\n“D——d barefaced intimidation!” Squire Rowley growled.\r\n\r\n“Or if it is to give votes to such persons as these——”\r\n\r\n“D——d Jacobins! Republicans every one!” interposed the Squire.\r\n\r\n“It will soon be plain to all,” the Sergeant concluded, in his House of\r\nCommons manner, “that it is a most revolutionary, dangerous, and—and\r\nunconstitutional measure, gentlemen.”\r\n\r\n“By G—d!” Mr. Cooke cried—he was thinking that if this was the kind of\r\nthing he was to suffer he might as well have fought Taunton or Preston,\r\nor any other open borough, and kept his money in his pocket—“by G—d, I\r\nwish Lord John were stifled in the mud he’s stirred up, and Gaffer Grey\r\nwith him!”\r\n\r\n“You can add Bruffam, if you like,” Wathen answered good-humouredly—he\r\nwas not paying two thousand five hundred guineas for his seat. “And rid\r\nme of a rival and the country of a pest, Cooke! But come, gentlemen,\r\nnow we’re here and no bones broken, shall we sit down? We are all safe,\r\nI trust, Mr. White? And especially—my future constituents?” with a\r\nglance of his shrewd Jewish-looking eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, no harm done,” White replied as cheerfully as he could;\r\nwhich was not overcheerfully, for in all his experience of Chippinge he\r\nhad known nothing like this; and he was a trifle scared. “Yes, sir,” he\r\ncontinued, looking round, “all here, I think! And—and by Jove,” in a\r\ntone of relief, “one more than I expected! Mr. Vaughan! I am glad, sir,\r\nvery glad, sir,” he added heartily, “to see you. Very glad!”\r\n\r\nThe young man who had alighted from his postchaise a few minutes before\r\ndid not, in appearance at least, reciprocate the feeling. He looked\r\nsulky and bored. But he shook the outstretched hand; he could do no\r\nless. Then, saying scarcely a word, he stood back again. He had\r\nhastened to Chippinge on receiving White’s belated express, but rather\r\nbecause, irritated by the collision with Flixton, he welcomed any\r\nchange, than because he was sure what he would do. In the chaise he had\r\nthought more of Mary than of politics, more of the Honourable Bob than\r\nof his cousin. And though, as far as Sir Robert was concerned, he was\r\nresolved to be frank and to play the man, his mind had travelled no\r\nfarther.\r\n\r\nNow, thrown suddenly among these people, he was, in a churlish way,\r\ntaken somewhat aback. But, in a thoroughly bad temper, he told himself\r\nit did not matter. If they did not like the line he was going to take,\r\nthat was their business. He was not responsible to them. In fine, he\r\nwas in a savage mood, with half his mind here and the other half\r\ndwelling on the events of the morning. For the moment politics seemed\r\nto him a poor game, and what he did or did not do of little\r\nconsequence!\r\n\r\nWhite and the others were not blind to his manner, and might have\r\nresented it in another. But Sir Robert’s heir was a great man and had a\r\nright to moods if any man had; doubtless he was become a fine gentleman\r\nand thought it a nuisance to vote in his own borough. They were all\r\npoliteness to him, therefore, and while his eyes passed haughtily\r\nbeyond them, seeking Sir Robert, they presented to him those whom he\r\ndid not know.\r\n\r\n“Very kind of you to come, Mr. Vaughan,” said the Sergeant, who, like\r\nmany browbeaters, could be a sycophant at need. “Very kind indeed! I\r\ndon’t know whether you know Mr. Cooke? He, equally with me, is obliged\r\nto you for your attendance.”\r\n\r\n“Greatly obliged, sir,” Mr. Cooke muttered. “Certainly, certainly.”\r\n\r\nVaughan bowed coldly.\r\n\r\n“Is not Sir Robert here?” he asked.\r\n\r\nHe was still looking beyond those to whom he spoke.\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Vaughan.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, “This way to dinner,” White cried loudly. “Come, gentlemen!\r\nDinner, gentlemen, dinner!”\r\n\r\nAnd Vaughan, heedless what he did or where he dined, but inclined in a\r\nsardonic way to amuse himself, went in with them. What did it matter?\r\nHe was not going to vote for them. But that was his business, and Sir\r\nRobert’s. He was not responsible to them.\r\n\r\nCertainly he was in a very bad temper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\nTHE VERMUYDEN DINNER\r\n\r\n\r\nVaughan began to think more soberly of his position when he found\r\nhimself set down at the table. He had White, who took one end, on his\r\nright; and the Sergeant was opposite him. At the other end the Alderman\r\npresided, supported by Mr. Cooke and the Rector.\r\n\r\nThe young man looked down the board, at the vast tureens that smoked on\r\nit, and at the faces, smug or jolly, hungry or expectant, that\r\nsurrounded them; and amid the flood of talk which burst forth the\r\nmoment his reverence had said a short grace, he began to feel the\r\nsituation uncomfortable. True, he had a sort of right to be there, as\r\nthe heir, and a Vermuyden. True, too, he owed nothing to anyone there;\r\nnothing to the Sergeant, whom he secretly disliked, nothing to Mr.\r\nCooke, whom he despised—in his heart he was as exclusive as Sir Robert\r\nhimself—nothing to White, who would one day be his paid dependant. He\r\nowed them no explanation. Why then should he expose himself to their\r\nanger and surprise? He would be silent and speak only when the time\r\ncame, and he could state his views to Sir Robert with a fair chance of\r\na fair hearing.\r\n\r\nStill he saw that the position in which he had placed himself was a\r\nfalse one: and might become ridiculous. And it crossed his mind to\r\nfeign illness and to go out and incontinently walk over to Stapylton\r\nand see Sir Robert. Or he might tell White quietly that he did not find\r\nhimself able to support his cousin’s nominations: and before the news\r\ngot abroad he might withdraw and let them think what they would. But he\r\nwas too proud to do the one, and in too sulky a mood to do the other.\r\nAnd he sat still.\r\n\r\n“Where is Sir Robert?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“He left home on a sudden call, this morning, sir,” White explained;\r\nwondering what made the young squire—who was wont to be affable—so\r\ndistant. “On unexpected business.”\r\n\r\n“It must have been important as well as unexpected,” Wathen said, with\r\na smile, “to take Sir Robert away today, Mr. White.”\r\n\r\n“It was both, sir, as I understood,” White answered, “for Sir Robert\r\ndid not make me acquainted with it. He seemed somewhat put out—more put\r\nout than I have often seen him. But he said that whatever happened he\r\nwould be back before the nomination.” And then, turning to Vaughan,\r\n“You must have passed him, sir?” he added.\r\n\r\n“Well, now I think of it,” Vaughan answered, his spoon suspended, “I\r\ndid. I met a travelling carriage and four with jackets like his. But, I\r\nthought it was empty.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, that was Sir Robert. He will not be best pleased,” White\r\ncontinued, turning to the Sergeant, “when he hears what a reception we\r\nhad!”\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, ah, well!” the Sergeant replied—pleasantness was his cue\r\nto-day. “Things are worse in Bath I’ll be sworn, Mr. White.”\r\n\r\n“No doubt, sir, no doubt! I think,” White added, forgetting his study\r\nof Cobbett, “the nation has gone mad.”\r\n\r\nAfter that Vaughan’s other neighbour, Squire Rowley, who met him\r\nannually at Stapylton, claimed his ear. The old fellow, hearty and\r\ngood-natured, but a bigoted Tory, who would have given Orator Hunt four\r\ndozen and thought Lord Grey’s proper reward a block on Tower Hill, was\r\nthe last person whom Vaughan would have chosen for a confidant; since\r\nonly to hear of a Vermuyden turned Whig would have gone near to giving\r\nhim a fit. Perforce, nevertheless, Vaughan had to listen to him and\r\nanswer him; he could not without rudeness cut him short. But all the\r\ntime as they talked, Vaughan’s uneasiness increased. With every minute\r\nhis eyes wandered more longingly to the door. Improved in temper by the\r\nfare and by the politeness of his neighbours, he began to see that he\r\nhad been foolish to thrust himself among people with whom he did not\r\nagree. Still he was there; and he must see the dinner to an end. After\r\nall a little more or a little less would not add to Sir Robert’s anger.\r\nHe could explain that he thought it more delicate to avoid an open\r\nscandal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the collision with the crowd had loosened the guests’ tongues\r\nand never had a Vermuyden dinner gone more freely. Even the “Cripples,”\r\nwhose wont it was to begin the evening with odious obsequiousness and\r\nclose it with a freedom as unpleasant, found speech early, and were\r\nloudest in denunciation of a Bill which threatened to deprive them of\r\ntheir annuities. By the time huge joints had taken the place of the\r\ntureens, and bowls of potatoes and mounds of asparagus dotted the\r\ntable, the noise was incessant. There was claret for those who cared\r\nfor it, and strong ale for all. And while some discussed the effect\r\nwhich a Bill that disfranchised Chippinge would have on their pockets\r\nand interests, others driving their arguments home with blows on the\r\ntable recalled, almost with tears, the sacred name of Pitt—the pilot\r\nwho weathered the storm; or held up to execration a cabinet of Whigs\r\ndead to every Whig principle, and alive only to the chance of power\r\nwhich a revolution might afford.\r\n\r\n“But what was to be expected? What was to be expected?” old Rowley\r\ninsisted. “We’ve only ourselves to thank! When Peel and the Duke took\r\nup the Catholic Claims they stepped into the Whigs’ shoes—and\r\ndevilishly may they pinch them! The Whigs had to find another pair, you\r\nsee, sir, and stepped into the Radicals’! And the only people left at a\r\nloss are the honest part of us; who are likely to end not only barefoot\r\nbut barebacked! Ay, by G—d, we are!”\r\n\r\nAnd so on, and so on; even White, who was vastly relieved by Vaughan’s\r\narrival, which made his majority safe, talked freely, and gave Dyas and\r\nPillinger of the Blue Duck the rough side of his tongue. While Vaughan,\r\nused to a freer atmosphere, listened to their one-sided arguments,\r\ntheir trite prophecies, their incredible prejudices—such they seemed to\r\nhim—and now turned up his nose, now pitied them, as an effete, a\r\ndoomed, a dying race.\r\n\r\nWhile he thought of this the dinner wore on, the joints vanished, and\r\nhuge steaming puddings made their appearance on the board; those who\r\ncared not for plum puddings could have marrow-puddings. Then cheese and\r\nspring onions, and some special old ale, light coloured, heady, and\r\nserved in tall, spare glasses, went round. At length the rector, a\r\ntrifle flushed, rose to say grace, and Vaughan saw that the cloth was\r\nabout to be removed. Bottles of strong port and tawny Madeira were at\r\nhand. Some called already for their favourite punch, or for hot grog.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he thought, “I can escape with a good grace. And I will!”\r\n\r\nBut as he made a movement to rise, the Sergeant rose opposite him,\r\nlifted his glass, and fixed him with his eye. And Vaughan felt that he\r\ncould not leave at that moment without rudeness. “Gentlemen, on your\r\nfeet, if you please,” he cried blandly. “The King! The King, God bless\r\nhim! The King, gentlemen, and may he never suffer for the faults of his\r\nservants! May the Grey mare never run away with him. May William the\r\nGood ne’er be ruined by a—bad Bill! Gentlemen, the King, God bless him,\r\nand deliver him from the Whigs!”\r\n\r\nThey drank the toast amid a roar of laughter and applause. And once\r\nmore as they sat down Vaughan thought that he would escape. Again he\r\nwas hindered. This time the interruption came from behind.\r\n\r\n“Hallo, Vaughan!” someone muttered in his ear. “You’re the last person\r\nI expected to see here!”\r\n\r\nHe turned and disgust filled him. The speaker, who had just entered,\r\nwas the son of a clergyman in the neighbourhood and had gone to the\r\nbar. He was a shifty, flattering fellow, at once a toady and a\r\nbackbiter; who had wormed himself into society too good for him, and in\r\nLondon was Vaughan’s _bête noir_. But had that been all! Alas, he was\r\nalso a member of the Academic. He had been present at Vaughan’s triumph\r\nten days before, and had heard him proclaim himself a Reformer of the\r\nReformers.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Vaughan could find not a word. He could only mutter “Oh!”\r\nin a tone of dismay. He feared that his face betrayed the chagrin he\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\n“I thought you were quite the other way?” Mowatt said. And he grinned.\r\nHe was a weedy, pale young man, with thin lips and a false smile.\r\n\r\nVaughan hesitated. “So I am!” he said curtly.\r\n\r\n“But—but I thought——”\r\n\r\n“Order! Order!” cried the Alderman, a trifle uplifted by wine and his\r\nposition. “Silence, if you please, gentlemen, for the Senior Candidate!\r\nAnd charge your glasses!”\r\n\r\nVaughan turned to the table, a frown on his brow. Wathen was on his\r\nfeet, holding his wine glass before his breast with one hand, while the\r\nother rested on the table. His attitude was that of a man confident of\r\nhis powers and pleased to exert them. Nevertheless, as he prepared to\r\nspeak, he lowered his eyes to the table as if he thought that a little\r\nmock-modesty became him.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, “it is my privilege to propose a toast, that at\r\nthis time and in this place—this time, gentlemen, when to an extent\r\nunknown within living memory, all is at stake, and this place which has\r\nso much to lose—it is my privilege, I say, to propose a toast that must\r\ngo straight to the heart of every man in this room, nay, of every\r\ntrue-born Englishman, and every lover of his country! It is _Our\r\nAncient Constitution, our Chartered Rights, our Vested Interests!_\r\n[Loud and continued applause.] Yes, gentlemen, our ancient\r\nConstitution, the security of every man, woman, and child in this\r\nrealm! And coupled with it our Chartered Rights, our Vested Interests,\r\nwhich, unassailed for generations, are to-day called in question by the\r\nweakness of many, by the madness of some, by the wicked ambition of a\r\nfew. [Loud cheering]. Gentlemen, to one Cromwell this town owes the\r\ndestruction of your famous Abbey, once the pride of this county! To\r\nanother Cromwell it owes the destruction of the walls that in troublous\r\ntimes secured the hearths of your forefathers! It lies with us—but we\r\nmust be instant and diligent—it lies with us, I say, to see that those\r\ncivil bulwarks which protect us and ours in the enjoyment of all we\r\nhave and all we hope for——”\r\n\r\n“In this world!” the Rector murmured in a deep bass voice.\r\n\r\n“In this world,” the Sergeant continued, accepting the amendment with a\r\ncomplimentary bow, “are not laid low by a third Cromwell! I care not\r\nwhether he mask himself under the name of Grey, or of Russell, or of\r\nBrougham, or of Lansdowne!”\r\n\r\nHe paused amid such a roar of applause as shook the room.\r\n\r\n“For think not”—the Sergeant resumed when it died down—“think not,\r\ngentlemen, whatever the easily led vulgar may think, that sacrilegious\r\nhands can be laid on the Ark of the Constitution without injury to many\r\nother interests; without the shock being felt through all the various\r\nmembers of the State down to the lowest: without endangering all those\r\nmultiform rights and privileges for which the Constitution is our\r\nguarantee! Let the advocates of this pernicious, this revolutionary\r\nBill say what they will, they cannot deny that its effect will be to\r\ndeprive you in Chippinge who, for nearly five centuries, have enjoyed\r\nthe privilege of returning members to Parliament—of that privilege,\r\nwith all”—here he glanced at the rich array of bottles that covered the\r\nboard—“the amenities which it brings with it! And for whose benefit?\r\nFor that of men no better qualified—nay, by practice and heredity less\r\nqualified—than yourselves. But, gentlemen, mark me, that is not all!\r\nThat is but the beginning, and it may be the least part. That loss they\r\ncannot hide from you. That loss they do not attempt to hide from you.\r\nBut they do hide from you,” he continued in his deepest and most tragic\r\ntone, “a fact to which the whole course of history is witness—that a\r\npolicy of robbery once begun is rarely stayed, if it be stayed, until\r\nthe victim is bare! Bare, gentlemen! Gentlemen, the freemen of this\r\nborough have of ancient right, conferred by an ancient sovereign——”\r\n\r\n“God bless him!” from Annibal, now somewhat drunk. “God bless him!\r\nHere’s his health!”\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant paused an instant and looked round the table. Then more\r\nslowly, “Ay, God bless him!” he said. “God bless King Canute! But\r\nwhat—what if those grants of land—-I care not whether you call them\r\nchartered rights or vested interests—which you freemen enjoy of\r\nhim—what if they do not enure? You have them,” with a penetrating\r\nglance from face to face, “but for how long, gentlemen, if this Bill\r\npass? You are too clear-sighted to be blind to the peril! Too shrewd to\r\nthink that you can part with one right, as old, as well vested, as\r\nperfectly secured—and keep the others undiminished? Gentlemen, if you\r\nare so blind, take warning! For wherever this anarchical, this\r\ndangerous, this revolutionary Bill——”\r\n\r\n“Hear! Hear! Hear!” from Vaughan’s neighbour, the Squire.\r\n\r\n“Wherever, I say, this Bill finds supporters—and I can well believe\r\nthat in Birmingham and Sheffield, where they have all to gain and\r\nnothing to lose, it will find supporters, it should find none in\r\nChippinge! Where we have all to lose and nothing to gain, and where no\r\nman but a fool or a rogue can in reason support it! Gentlemen, you are\r\nneither fools nor rogues——”\r\n\r\n“No! No! No! No!”\r\n\r\n“No, gentlemen, and therefore, though a few silly fellows may shout for\r\nthe Bill in the streets, I am sure that I shall have the whole of this\r\ninfluential company with me when I give you the toast of ‘Our Ancient\r\nConstitution, Our Chartered Rights, Our Vested Interests!’ May the Bill\r\nthat assails them be defeated by the good sense of a sober and united\r\npeople! May those who urge it and those who support it—rogues where\r\nthey are not fools, and fools where they are not rogues—meet with the\r\nfate they deserve! And may we be there to see! Gentlemen,” he\r\ncontinued, raising his hand for silence, “in the absence upon pressing\r\nbusiness of our beloved High Steward, the model of an English gentleman\r\nand the pattern of an English landlord, I beg to couple this\r\ntoast”—here the Sergeant’s sharp black eyes fixed themselves suddenly\r\non his opposite neighbour—“with the name of his kinsman, Mr. Arthur\r\nVaughan!”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!” The room shook with the volume of applause,\r\nthe tables trembled. And through it all Arthur Vaughan’s heart beat\r\nhard, and he swallowed nervously. He was caught. Whether the Sergeant\r\nknew it or not, he was trapped. From the beginning of the speech he had\r\nhad his misgivings. He had listened anxiously; and though he had lost\r\nnothing, though one half of his mind had followed the speaker’s thread,\r\nthe other half had scanned the prospect feverishly, weighed the chances\r\nof escape, and grown chill with the fear of what was coming. If he had\r\nonly withdrawn in time! If he had only——\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!” They were pounding the table with fist and\r\nglass, and looking towards him—two long rows of flushed, excited, tipsy\r\nfaces. Some were drinking to him. Others were scanning him curiously.\r\nAll were waiting.\r\n\r\nHe leant forward. “I don’t wish to speak,” he said, addressing the\r\nSergeant in a troubled voice. “Call on some one else, if you please.”\r\n\r\nBut “Impossible, sir!” White, surprised by his evident nervousness,\r\nanswered. He had thought Vaughan anything but a shy person.\r\n“Impossible, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Get up! Get up!” cried the Squire, his neighbour, laying a jocund hand\r\non him and trying to lift him to his feet.\r\n\r\nBut Vaughan resisted; his throat was so dry that he could hardly frame\r\nhis words. “I don’t wish to speak,” he muttered. “I don’t agree——”\r\n\r\n“Say what you like, my dear sir!” the Sergeant rejoined blandly, but\r\nwith a gleam of amusement in his eyes. He had had his doubts of Master\r\nVaughan ever since he had caught him on his way to the Chancellor: now\r\nhe thought that he had him pinned. He did not suppose that the young\r\nman would dare to revolt openly.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, you must get up,” said White, who had no suspicion that his\r\nhesitation arose from any cause but shyness. “Anything will do.”\r\n\r\nVaughan rose—slowly, and with a beating heart. He rose perforce. For a\r\nmoment he stood, deafened by his reception. For the smaller men saw in\r\nhim one of the old family, the future landlord of two-thirds of them,\r\nthe sometime owner of the very roof under which they were gathered. And\r\nhe, while they greeted his rising and he stood waiting with an unhappy\r\nface for silence, wondered, even at this last moment, what he would\r\nsay. And Heaven knows what he would have said—so hard was it to\r\ndisappoint those cheering men, all looking at him with worship in their\r\neyes—so painful was it to break old ties—if he had not caught behind\r\nhim Mowatt’s whisper, “Eat his words! He’ll have to unsay——”\r\n\r\nNo more than that, a fragment, but enough; enough to show him that he\r\nhad better, far better seem false to these men, to his blood, to the\r\npast, than be false to himself. He straightened his shoulders, and\r\nlifted his head.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, and now his voice though low was steady, “I rise\r\nunwillingly—unwillingly, because I feel too late that I ought not to be\r\nhere. That I have no right to be here. [No! No!] No right to be here,\r\nfor this reason,” he continued, raising his hand for silence, “for this\r\nreason, that in much of what Sergeant Wathen has said, I cannot go with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nThere, it was out! But no more than a stare of perplexity passed from\r\nthe more intelligent faces about him to the duller faces lower down the\r\ntable. They did not understand; it was only clear that he could not\r\nmean what he seemed to mean. But he was going on in a silence so\r\ncomplete that a pin falling to the floor might have been heard!\r\n\r\n“I rise unwillingly, I say again, gentlemen,” he continued, “and I beg\r\nyou to remember this, and that I did not come here of set purpose to\r\nflaunt my opinions before you. For I, too”—here he betrayed his secret\r\nagitation—“thus far I do go with Sergeant Wathen,—I, too, am for Our\r\nAncient Constitution, I give place to no man in love of it. And I, too,\r\nam against revolution, I will stand second to none in abhorrence of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Hear! Hear!” cried the Rector in a tone of unmistakable relief. “Hear,\r\nhear!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, go on,” chimed in the Squire. “Go on, lad, go on! That’s all\r\nright!” And half aside in his neighbour’s ear, “Gad! he frightened me!”\r\nhe muttered.\r\n\r\n“But—but to be plain,” Vaughan resumed, pronouncing every word clearly,\r\n“I do not regard the Bill which the Sergeant has mentioned, the Bill\r\nwhich is in all your minds, as assailing the one, or as being\r\ntantamount to the other! On the contrary, I believe that it restores\r\nthe ancient balance of the Constitution, and will avert, as nothing\r\nelse will avert, a Revolution!”\r\n\r\nAs he paused on that word, the Squire, who was of a free habit, tried\r\nto rise and speak, but choked. The Rector gasped. Only Mr. Cooke found\r\nhis voice. He sprang to his feet, purple in the face. “By G—d!” he\r\nroared, “are we going to listen to this?”\r\n\r\nVaughan sat down, pale but composed. But he found all eyes on him, and\r\nhe rose again.\r\n\r\n“It was against my will I said what I have said,” he resumed. “I did\r\nnot wish to speak. I do not wish you to listen. I rose only because I\r\nwas forced to rise. But being up, I owed it to myself to say enough to\r\nclear myself of—of the appearance of duplicity. That is all.”\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant did not speak, but gazed darkly at him, his mind busy with\r\nthe effect which this would have on the election. White, too, did not\r\nspeak—he sat stricken dumb. The Squire swore, and five or six of the\r\nmore intelligent hissed. But again it was Cooke who found words.\r\n\r\n“That all? But that is not all!” he shouted. “That is not all! What are\r\nyou, sir?” For still, in common with most of those at the table, he\r\ncould not believe that he heard aright. He fancied that this was some\r\ntrope, some nice distinction, which he had not followed. “You may be\r\nSir Robert Vermuyden’s cousin ten times over,” he continued,\r\nvehemently, “but we’ll have it clear what we have to expect. Speak like\r\na man, sir! Say what you mean!”\r\n\r\nVaughan had taken his seat, but he rose again, a gleam of anger in his\r\neyes. “Have I not spoken plainly?” he said. “I thought I had. If you\r\nhave still any doubt, sir, I am for the Constitution, but I think that\r\nit has suffered by the wear and tear of time and needs repair. I think\r\nthat the shifting of population during the last two centuries, the\r\ndecay of one place and the rise of another, call for some change in the\r\nrepresentation! I hold that the spread of education and the creation of\r\na large and wealthy class unconnected with the land, render that change\r\nmore urgent if we would avoid a revolution! I believe that the more we\r\nenlarge the base upon which our institutions rest, the more safely, the\r\nmore steadily, and the longer will they last!”\r\n\r\nThey knew now, they understood, and the storm broke. The smaller men,\r\nor such of them as were sober, stared. But the greater number burst\r\ninto a roar of dissent, of reprobation, of anger, led by the Squire.\r\n\r\n“A Whig, by Heaven!” he cried violently. And he thrust his chair as far\r\nas possible from his neighbour. “A Whig, by Heaven! And here!” While\r\nothers cried, “Renegade!” “Radical!” and “What are you doing here?” and\r\nhissed him. But above all, in some degree stilling all, rose Cooke’s\r\ncrucial question, “Are you for the Bill? Answer me that!” And he\r\nextended his hand for silence. “Are you for the Bill?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” Vaughan answered. The storm steadied him.\r\n\r\n“You are?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Fool or rogue, then! which are you?” shrieked a voice from the lower\r\nend of the table. “Fool or rogue? Which are you?”\r\n\r\nVaughan turned sharply in the direction of the voice. “That reminds\r\nme,” he said with a vigour which seemed after a few seconds to gain him\r\na hearing—for the noise died down—“that reminds me, Sergeant Wathen is\r\nagainst the Bill. But he has addressed himself solely and only to your\r\nprejudices, gentlemen! I am for the Bill—I am for the Bill,” he\r\nrepeated, seeing that their attention was wandering, “I——”\r\n\r\nHe stopped, silenced and taken aback. For some were on their feet,\r\nothers were rising; the faces of nine out of ten were turned from him.\r\nWhat was it? He turned to see; and he saw.\r\n\r\nA few paces within the door stood Sir Robert himself; his fur collared\r\ntravelling cloak hanging loose about him and showing his tall spare\r\nfigure at its best. He stooped, but his high-bred face, cynically\r\nsmiling, was turned full on the speaker; it was certain that he had\r\nheard much, if not all. And Vaughan had been brave indeed, he had been\r\na hero, if taken by surprise and at this disadvantage he had not shown\r\nsome discomfiture.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to smile now! Easy to say that this was but an English\r\ngentleman, bound like others by the law! And Vaughan’s own kinsman! But\r\nfew would have smiled then. He, through whose hands passed a quarter of\r\nthe patronage of a county, who dammed or turned the stream of\r\npromotion, who had made many there and could unmake them, whose mere\r\nhint could have consigned, a few years back, the troublesome to the\r\npress-gang, who belonged almost as definitely, almost as exclusively,\r\nto a caste, as do white men in the India of to-day; who seldom showed\r\nhimself to the vulgar save in his coach and four, or riding with belted\r\ngrooms behind him—about such an one in ’31 there was, if no divinity,\r\nat least the ægis of real power, that habit which unquestioned\r\nauthority confers, that port of Jove to which men bow! Scan the\r\npictured faces of the men who steered this country through the long\r\nwar—the faces of Liverpool and Castlereagh—\r\n\r\n_Daring pilots in extremity_,\r\n\r\n_Scorning the danger when the waves ran high_;\r\n\r\n\r\nor of those men, heirs to their traditions, who, for nearly twenty\r\nyears, confronted the no less formidable forces of discontent and\r\ndisaffection—of Peel and Wellington, Croker and Canning, and he is\r\nblind who does not find there the reflection of that firm rule, the\r\nshadow of that power which still survived, though maimed and weakened\r\nin the early thirties.\r\n\r\nCertainly it was not easy to smile at such men then; at their pride or\r\ntheir prejudices, their selfishness or their eccentricity. For behind\r\nlay solid power. Small blame to Vaughan therefore, if in the face of\r\nthe servile attitude, the obsequious rising of the company about him,\r\nhe felt his countenance change, if he could not quite hide his dismay.\r\nAnd though he told himself that his feelings were out of place, that\r\nthe man did but stand in the shoes which would one day be his, and was\r\nbut now what he would be, _vox faucibus hæsit_—he was dumb. It was Sir\r\nRobert who broke the silence.\r\n\r\n“I fear, Mr. Vaughan,” he said, the gleam in his eyes alone betraying\r\nhis passion—for he would as soon have walked the country lanes in his\r\ndressing robe as given way to rage in that company—“I fear you are\r\nsaying in haste words which you will repent at leisure! Did I hear\r\naright that—that you are in favour of the Bill?”\r\n\r\n“I am,” Vaughan replied a little huskily. “I——”\r\n\r\n“Just so, just so!” Sir Robert replied with a certain lightness. And\r\nraising his walking cane he pointed gravely and courteously to the door\r\na pace or two from him. “That is the door, Mr. Vaughan,” he said. “You\r\nmust be here, I am sure, under an error.”\r\n\r\nVaughan coloured painfully. “Sir Robert,” he said, “I owe you, I\r\nknow——”\r\n\r\n“You will owe me very little by to-morrow evening,” Sir Robert\r\nrejoined, interrupting him suavely. “Much less than you now think! But\r\nthat is not to the point. Will you—kindly withdraw?”\r\n\r\n“I would like at least to say this! That I came here——”\r\n\r\n“Will you kindly withdraw?” Sir Robert persisted. “That is all.” And he\r\npointed again, and still more blandly, to the door. “Any explanation\r\nyou may please to offer—and I do not deny that one may be in place—you\r\ncan give to my agent to-morrow. He, on his part, will have something to\r\nsay. For the present—Annibal,” turning with kindly condescension, “be\r\ngood enough to open the door for this gentleman. Good-evening, Mr.\r\nVaughan. You will not, I am sure, compel me to remove with my friends\r\nto another room?”\r\n\r\nAnd as he continued to point to the door, and would listen to\r\nnothing—and the room was certainly his—Vaughan walked out. And Annibal\r\nclosed the door behind him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\nMISS SIBSON’S MISTAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps fortunate for Miss Hilhouse that she did not hazard any\r\nremarks on that second escapade in the Square. Whether this amendment\r\nin her manners was due to Miss Sibson’s apothegms, or to the general\r\ndesire of the school to see the new teacher’s new pelisse—which could\r\nonly be gratified by favour—or to a threatening rigidity in Mary\r\nSmith’s bearing must remain a question. But children are keen\r\nobservers. Their senses are as sharp as their tongues are cruel. And it\r\nis certain that Miss Smith had not read four lines of the fifth chapter\r\nof The Fairchild Family before a certain sternness in her tone was\r\nnoted by those who had not already marked the danger signal in her\r\neyes. For the gentlest eyes can dart lightnings on occasion. The sheep\r\nwill turn in defence of its lamb. Nor ever walked woman who could not\r\nfight for her secret and her pride.\r\n\r\nSo Miss Hilhouse bit her tongue and kept silence, the girls behaved\r\nbeautifully, and Mary read The Fairchild Family to them in a tone of\r\nmonotony that perfectly reflected the future as she saw it. She had\r\nbeen very foolish, and very weak, but she was not without excuse. He\r\nhad saved her life, she could plead that. True, brought up as she had\r\nbeen at Clapham, shielded from all dealings with the other sex, taught\r\nto regard them as wolves, or at best as a race with which she could\r\nhave no safe parley, she should have known better. She should have\r\nknown that handsome, courteous, masterful-eyed, as they were—and with a\r\nway with them that made poor girls’ hearts throb at one moment and\r\nstand still at another—she should have known that they meant nothing.\r\nThat they were still men, and that she must not trust them, must not\r\nthink of them, must not expect to find them more steadfast to a point\r\nthan the weather-cock on St. Mary’s at Redcliffe.\r\n\r\nThe weather-cock? Ah!\r\n\r\nShe had no sooner framed the thought in the middle of the reading than\r\nshe was aware of a sensation; and a child, one of the youngest, raised\r\nher hand. “Please—”\r\n\r\nMary paused.\r\n\r\n“Yes?” she asked. “What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Please, Miss Smith, did the weather-cock speak?”\r\n\r\nMary reddened violently.\r\n\r\n“Speak? The weather-cock? What do you mean, child?”\r\n\r\n“Please, Miss Smith, you said that the weather-cock told Lucy the\r\ntruth, the truth, and all the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” Mary stammered. “I—I should have said, the coachman.” And\r\nMary resumed the story, but with a hot face; a face that blushed more\r\npainfully and more intolerably because she was conscious that every eye\r\nwas upon it, and that a score of small minds were groping for the cause\r\nof her confusion.\r\n\r\nShe remembered, oh, how well she remembered, that the schoolmistress at\r\nClapham had told her that she had every good quality except strength of\r\nwill. And how thoroughly, how rapidly had she proved the truth of the\r\nexception! Freed from control for only twenty-four hours, left for that\r\ntime to her own devices, she had listened to the first voice that\r\naddressed her, believed the first flattering look that fell on her,\r\ntaken the most ordinary attentions—attentions at which any girl with\r\nknowledge of the world or strength of will would have smiled—for gold,\r\nreal red gold! So that a light look without a spoken word had drawn her\r\nheart from her. How it behoved her to despise herself, loathe herself,\r\ndiscipline herself! How she ought to guard herself in the future! Above\r\nall, how thankful should she be for the dull but safe routine that\r\nfenced, and henceforth would fence, her life from such dangers!\r\n\r\nTrue. Yet how dreary to her young eyes seemed that routine stretched\r\nbefore her! How her courage fainted at the prospect of morning added to\r\nmorning, formal walk to formal walk, lesson to lesson, one generation\r\nof pupils to another! For generation would follow generation, one\r\nchubby face would give place to another, and still she would be there,\r\nplodding through the stale task, listening with an aching head to the\r\nstrumming on the harpsichord, saying the same things, finding the same\r\nfaults, growing slowly into a correcting, scolding, punishing machine.\r\nBy and by she would know The Fairchild Family by heart, and she would\r\nsicken at the “Letters on the Improvement of the Mind.” The children\r\nwould still be young, but grey hairs would come to her, she would grow\r\nstout and dull; and those slender hands, those dainty fingers still\r\nwhite and fine, still meet for love, would be seared by a million\r\nneedle-pricks and roughened by the wear and tear of ten thousand hours\r\nof plain sewing.\r\n\r\nShe was ungrateful, oh, she was ungrateful to think such thoughts! For\r\nin what was her lot worse than the lot of others? Or worse than it had\r\nbeen a week before when, who more humble-minded or contented, more\r\ncheerful or helpful than Mary Smith? When her only fault had been a\r\nweakness of character which her old schoolmistress hoped would be cured\r\nby time? When, though the shadow of an unknown Miss Sibson loomed\r\nformidable before her, she had faced her fate bravely and hopefully,\r\nsupported not a little by the love and good wishes—won by a thousand\r\nkind offices—which went with her into the unknown world.\r\n\r\nWhat had happened in the meantime? A little thing, oh, a very little\r\nthing. But to think of it under the childrens’ eyes made her face burn\r\nagain. She had lost her heart—to a man. To a man! The very word seemed\r\nimproper in that company. How much more improper when the man cared\r\nnothing for her, but tossing her a smile for guerdon, had taken her\r\npeace of mind and gone his way, with a laugh. At the best, if he had\r\never dreamt seriously of her, ever done more than deem her an innocent,\r\neasily flattered and as lightly to be won, he had changed his mind as\r\nquickly as a weather-cock shifts in April. And he had talked—that hurt\r\nher, that hurt her most! He had talked of her freely, boasted of her\r\nsilliness, told his companions what he would do, or what he would not\r\ndo; made her common to them!\r\n\r\nShe got away for a few minutes at tea-time. But twenty pairs of eyes\r\nfollowed her from the room and seized on her as she returned. And “Miss\r\nSmith, ain’t you well?” piped a tiny treble.\r\n\r\nShe was controlling her voice to answer—that she was quite well, when\r\nMiss Sibson intervened. “Miss Fripp,” she said sombrely, “write ‘Are\r\nyou not,’ twenty times on your slate after tea! Miss Hilhouse, if you\r\nstare in that fashion you will be goggle-eyed. Young ladies, elbows,\r\nelbows! Have I not told you a score of times that the art of deportment\r\nconsists in the right use of the elbow? Now, Miss Claxton, in what does\r\nthe art of deportment consist?”\r\n\r\n“In the right use of the elbow, Ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“And what is the right use of the elbow?”\r\n\r\n“To efface it, Ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“That is better,” Miss Sibson replied, somewhat mollified. “Understood\r\nis half done. Miss Smith,” looking about her with benevolence, “had you\r\noccasion to commend any young lady’s needle this afternoon?”\r\n\r\nMiss Smith looked unhappy: conscious that she had not been as attentive\r\nto her duties as became her. “I had no occasion to find fault, Ma’am,”\r\nshe said timidly.\r\n\r\n“Very good. Then every fourth young lady beginning at my right hand may\r\ntake a piece of currant cake. I see that Miss Burges is wearing the\r\nsilver medal for good conduct. She may take a piece, and give a piece\r\nto a friend. When you have eaten your cake you may go to the schoolroom\r\nand play for half an hour at Blind Man’s Buff. But—elbows! Elbows,\r\nyoung ladies,” gazing austerely at them over her glasses. “In all your\r\nfrolics let deportment be your first consideration.”\r\n\r\nThe girls trooped out and Mary Smith rose to go with them. But Miss\r\nSibson bade her remain. “I wish to speak to you,” she said.\r\n\r\nPoor Mary trembled. For Miss Sibson was still in some measure an\r\nunknown quantity, a perplexing mixture of severity and benevolence,\r\nsound sense and Mrs. Chapone.\r\n\r\n“I wish to speak to you,” Miss Sibson continued when they were alone.\r\nAnd then after a pause during which she poured herself out a third cup\r\nof tea, “My dear,” she said soberly, “the sooner a false step is\r\nretraced the better. I took a false step yesterday—I blame myself for\r\nit—when I allowed you—in spite of my rule to the contrary—to see a\r\ngentleman. I made that exception partly out of respect to the note\r\nwhich the parcel contained; the affair was strange and out of the\r\nordinary. And partly because I liked the gentleman’s face. I thought\r\nhim a gentleman; he told me that he had an independence: I had no\r\nreason to think him more than that. But I have heard to-day, my dear—I\r\nthought it right to make some enquiry in view of the possibility of a\r\nsecond visit—that he is a gentleman of large expectations, who will one\r\nday be very rich and a man of standing in the country. That alters the\r\nposition,” Miss Sibson continued gravely. “Had I known it”—she rubbed\r\nher nose thoughtfully with the handle of her teaspoon—“I should not\r\nhave permitted the interview.” And then after a few seconds of silence,\r\n“You understand me, I think, my dear?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Mary said in a low voice. She spoke with perfect composure.\r\n\r\n“Just so, just so,” Miss Sibson answered, pleased to see that the girl\r\nwas too proud to give way before her—though she was sure that she would\r\ncry by and by. “I am glad to think that there is no harm done. As I\r\nhave said, the sooner a false step is retraced, the better; and\r\ntherefore if he calls again I shall not permit him to see you.”\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to see him,” Mary said with dignity.\r\n\r\n“Very good. Then that is understood.”\r\n\r\nBut strangely enough, the words had barely fallen from Miss Sibson’s\r\nlips when there came a knock at the house door, and the same thought\r\nleapt to the mind of each; and to Mary’s cheek a sudden vivid blush\r\nthat, fading as quickly as it came, left her paler than before. Miss\r\nSibson saw the girl’s distress, and she was about to suggest, in words\r\nequivalent to a command, that she should retire, when the door opened\r\nand the neat maidservant announced—with poorly masked excitement—that a\r\ngentleman wished to see Miss Smith.\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson frowned.\r\n\r\n“Where is he?” she asked, with majesty; as if she already scented the\r\nfray.\r\n\r\n“In the parlour, Ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“Very good. Very good. I will see him.” But not until the maid had\r\nretired did the schoolmistress rise to her feet. “You had better stay\r\nhere,” she said, looking at her companion, “until my return. It is of\r\ncourse your wish that I should dismiss him?”\r\n\r\nMary shivered. Those dreams of something brighter, something higher,\r\nsomething fuller than the daily round; of a life in the sunshine, of\r\neyes that looked into hers—this was their end! But she said “Yes,”\r\nbravely.\r\n\r\n“Good girl,” said Miss Sibson, feeling, good, honest creature, more\r\nthan she showed. “I will do so.” And she swam forth.\r\n\r\nPoor Mary! The door was barely shut before her heart whispered that she\r\nhad only to cross the hall and she would see him; that, on the other\r\nhand, if she did not cross the hall, she would never, never, never see\r\nhim again! She would stay here for all time, bound hand and foot to the\r\nunchanging round of petty duties, a blind slave in the mill, no longer\r\na woman—though her woman’s heart hungered for love—but a dull, formal,\r\nold maid, growing more stiff and angular with every year! No farther\r\naway than the other side of the hall were love and freedom. And she\r\ndared not, she dared not open the door!\r\n\r\nAnd then she bethought her, that he was no weathercock, for he had come\r\nagain! He had come! And it must be for something. For what?\r\n\r\nShe heard the door open on the parlour side of the hall, and she knew\r\nthat he was going. And she stood listening, waiting with blanched\r\ncheeks.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and Miss Sibson came in, met her look—and started.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” the schoolmistress exclaimed; and for a moment she stood, looking\r\nstrangely at the girl, as if she did not know what to say to her. Then,\r\n“We were mistaken,” she said, with a serious face. “It is not the\r\ngentleman you were expecting, my dear. On the contrary, it’s a stranger\r\nwho wishes to see you on business.”\r\n\r\nMary tried to gain command of herself. “I had rather not,” she said\r\nfaintly. “I don’t think I can.”\r\n\r\n“I fear—you must,” Miss Sibson rejoined, with unusual gravity. “Still,\r\nthere is no hurry. He can wait a few minutes. He can await your\r\nleisure. Do you sit down and compose yourself. You have no reason to be\r\ndisturbed. The gentleman”—she continued, with an odd inflection in her\r\nvoice—“is old enough to be your father.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\nMR. PYBUS’S OFFER\r\n\r\n\r\n“A note for you, sir.” Vaughan turned moodily to take it. It was the\r\nmorning after the Vermuyden dinner, and he had slept ill, he had risen\r\nlate, he was still sitting before his breakfast, toying with it rather\r\nthan eating it. His first feeling on leaving the dining-room had been\r\nbitter chagrin at the ease with which Sir Robert had dealt with him.\r\nThis had given place a little later to amusement; for he had a sense of\r\nhumour. And he had laughed, though sorely, at the figure he had cut as\r\nhe beat his retreat. Still later, as he lay, excited and wakeful, he\r\nhad fallen a prey to doubt; that horrible three o’clock in the morning\r\ndoubt, which defies reason, which sees all the _cons_ in the strongest\r\nlight and reduces the _pros_ to shadows. However, one thing was\r\ncertain. He had crossed the Rubicon. He had divorced himself by public\r\nact from the party to which his forbears—for the Vaughans as well as\r\nthe Vermuydens had been Tories—had belonged. He had joined the Whigs;\r\nnay, he had joined the Reformers. But though he had done this\r\ndeliberately and from conviction, though his reason approved the step,\r\nand his brain teemed with arguments in its favour, the chance that he\r\nmight be wrong haunted him.\r\n\r\nThat governing class from which he was separating himself, from which\r\nhis policy would snatch power, which in future would dub him traitor,\r\nwhat had it not done for England? With how firm a hand had it not\r\nguided the country through storm and stress, with what success shielded\r\nit not from foreign foes only, but from disruption and revolution? He\r\nscanned the last hundred and fifty years and saw the country, always\r\nunder the steady rule of that class which had the greatest stake in its\r\nprosperity, advancing in strength and riches and comfort, ay, and,\r\nthough slowly in these, in knowledge also and the humanities and\r\ndecencies. And the question forced itself upon him, would that great\r\nmiddle class into whose hands the sway now fell, use it better? Would\r\nthey produce statesmen more able than Walpole or Chatham, generals\r\nbraver than Wolfe or Moore, a higher heart than Nelson’s? Nay, would\r\nthe matter end there? Would not power slip into the hands of a wider\r\nand yet a wider circle? Would Orator Hunt’s dream of Manhood Suffrage,\r\nAnnual Parliaments and the Ballot become a reality? Would government by\r\nthe majority, government by tale of heads, as if three chawbacons must\r\nperforce be wiser than one squire, government by the ill-taught,\r\nuntrained mass, with the least to lose and the most to gain—would that\r\nin the long run plunge the country in fatal misfortunes?\r\n\r\nIt was just possible that those who deemed the balance of power,\r\nestablished in 1688, the one perfect mean between despotism and\r\nanarchy—it was just possible that they were right. And that he was a\r\nfool.\r\n\r\nThen to divert his mind he had allowed himself to think of Mary Smith.\r\nAnd he had tossed and tumbled, ill-satisfied with himself. He was\r\nbrave, he told himself, in the wrong place. He had the courage to break\r\nwith old associations, to defy opinion, to disregard Sir Robert—where\r\nno more than a point of pride was concerned; for it was absurd to fancy\r\nthat the fate of England hung on his voice. But in a matter which went\r\nto the root of his happiness—for he was sure that he loved Mary Smith\r\nand would love no other—he had not the spirit to defy a little gossip,\r\na few smiles, the contempt of the worldly. He flushed from head to foot\r\nat the thought of a life which, however modest—and modesty was not\r\nincompatible with ambition—was shared by her, and would be pervaded by\r\nher. And yet he dared not purchase that life at so trifling a cost! No,\r\nhe was weak where he should be strong, and strong where he should be\r\nweak. And so he had tossed and turned, and now after two or three hours\r\nof feverish sleep, he sat glooming over his tea cup.\r\n\r\nPresently he broke open the note which the waiter had handed to him. He\r\nread it, and “Who brought this?” he asked, with a perplexed face.\r\n\r\n“Don’t know, sir,” Sam replied glibly, beginning to collect the\r\nbreakfast dishes.\r\n\r\n“Will you enquire?”\r\n\r\n“Found it on the hall table, sir,” the man answered, in the same tone.\r\n“Fancy,” with a grin, “it’s a runaway knock, sir. Known a man find a\r\ncabbage at the door and a whole year’s wages under it—at election time,\r\nsir! Yes, sir. Find funny things in funny places—election time, sir.”\r\n\r\nVaughan made no reply, but a few minutes later he took his hat and\r\ndescending the stairs, strolled with an easy air into the street. He\r\npaused as if to contemplate the Abbey Church, beautiful even in its\r\ndisfigurement. Then, but as if he were careless which way he went, he\r\nturned to the right.\r\n\r\nThe main street, with its whitened doorsteps and gleaming knockers, lay\r\nlanguid in the sunshine; perhaps, enervated by the dissipation of the\r\nprevious evening. The candidates who would presently pay formal visits\r\nto the voters were not yet afoot: and though taverns where the tap was\r\nrunning already gave forth maudlin laughter, no other sign of the\r\ncoming event declared itself. A few tradesmen stood at their doors, a\r\nfew dogs lay stretched in the sun; and only Vaughan’s common sense told\r\nhim that he was watched.\r\n\r\nFrom the High Street he presently turned into a narrow alley on the\r\nright which descended between garden walls to the lower level of the\r\ntown. A man who was lounging in the mouth of the alley muttered “second\r\ndoor on the left,” as Vaughan passed, and the latter moved on counting\r\nthe doors. At the one indicated he paused, and, after making certain\r\nthat he was not observed, he knocked. The door opened a little way.\r\n\r\n“For whom are you?” asked someone who kept himself out of sight.\r\n\r\n“Buff and Blue,” Vaughan answered.\r\n\r\n“Right; sir,” the voice rejoined briskly. The door opened wide and\r\nVaughan passed in. He found himself in a small walled garden smothered\r\nin lilac and laburnum, and shaded by two great chestnut trees already\r\nso fully in leaf as to hide the house to which the garden belonged.\r\n\r\nThe person who had admitted him, a very small, very neat gentleman in a\r\nhigh-collared blue coat and nankeen trousers, with a redundant soft\r\ncravat wound about his thin neck, bowed low. “Happy to see you, Mr.\r\nVaughan,” he chirped. “I am Mr. Pybus, his lordship’s man of business.\r\nHappy to be the intermediary in so pleasant a matter.”\r\n\r\n“I hope it may turn out so,” Vaughan replied drily. “You wrote me a\r\nvery mysterious note.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t be too careful, sir,” the little man, who was said to model\r\nhimself upon Lord John Russell, answered with an important frown.\r\n“Can’t be too careful in these matters. You’re watched and I am\r\nwatched, sir.”\r\n\r\n“I dare say,” Vaughan replied.\r\n\r\n“And the responsibility is great, very great. May I——” he continued,\r\npulling out his box, “but I dare say you don’t take snuff?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“No? The younger generation! Just so! Many of the young gentry smoke, I\r\nam told. Other days, other manners! Well—we know of course what\r\nhappened last night. And I’m bound to say, I honour you, Mr. Vaughan! I\r\nhonour you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You can let that pass,” Vaughan replied coldly.\r\n\r\n“Very good! Very good! Of course,” he continued with importance, “the\r\nnews was brought to me at once, and his lordship knew it before he\r\nslept.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed. Yes. And he wrote to me this morning—in his dressing\r\ngown, I don’t doubt. He commanded me to tell you——”\r\n\r\nBut here Vaughan stopped him—somewhat rudely. “One minute, Mr. Pybus,”\r\nhe said, “I don’t wish to know what Lord Lansdowne said or did—because\r\nit will not affect my conduct. I am here because you requested me to\r\ngrant you an interview. But if your purpose be merely to convey to me\r\nLord Lansdowne’s approval—or disapproval,” in a tone a little more\r\ncontemptuous than was necessary, “be good enough to understand that\r\nthey are equally indifferent to me. I have done what I have done\r\nwithout regard to my cousin’s—to Sir Robert Vermuyden’s feelings. You\r\nmay take it for certain,” he added loftily, “that I shall not be led\r\nbeyond my own judgment by any regard for his lordship’s.”\r\n\r\n“But hear me out!” the little man cried, dancing to and fro in his\r\neagerness; so that, in the shifting lights under the great chestnut\r\ntree, he looked like a pert, bright-coloured bird. “Hear me out, and\r\nyou’ll not say that!”\r\n\r\n“I shall say, Mr. Pybus——”\r\n\r\n“I beg you to hear me out!”\r\n\r\nVaughan shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Go on!” he said. “I have said my say, and I suppose you understand\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“I shall hold it unsaid,” Mr. Pybus rejoined warmly, “until I have\r\nspoken!” And he waved an agitated finger in the air. “Observe, Mr.\r\nVaughan—his lordship bade me take you entirely into confidence, and I\r\ndo so. We’ve only one candidate—Mr. Wrench. Colonel Petty is sure of\r\nhis election in Ireland and we’ve no mind to stand a second contest to\r\nfill his seat: in fact we are not going to nominate him. Lord Kerry, my\r\nlord’s eldest son thought of it, but it is not a certainty, and my lord\r\nwishes him to wait a year or two and sit for Calne. I say it’s not a\r\ncertainty. But it’s next door to a certainty since you have declared\r\nyourself. And my lord’s view, Mr. Vaughan, is that he who hits the buck\r\nshould have the haunch. You take me?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, I don’t.”\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll be downright, sir. To the point, sir. Will you be our\r\ncandidate?”\r\n\r\n“What?” Vaughan cried. He turned very red. “What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“What I said, sir. Will you be our candidate? For the Bill, the whole\r\nBill, and nothing but the Bill? If so, we shall not say a word until\r\nto-morrow and then we shall nominate you with Mr. Wrench, and take ’em\r\nby surprise. Eh? Do you see? They’ve got their speeches ready full of\r\nmy lord’s interference and my lord’s dictation, and they will point to\r\nColonel Petty, my lord’s cousin, for proof! And then,” Mr. Pybus\r\nwinked, much after the fashion of a mischievous paroquet, “we’ll knock\r\nthe stool from under ’em by nominating you! And, mind you, Mr. Vaughan,\r\nwe are going to win. We were hopeful before, for we’ve one of their men\r\nin gaol, and another, Pillinger of the Blue Duck, is tied by the leg.\r\nHis wife owes a bit of money and thinks more of fifty guineas in her\r\nown pocket than of thirty pounds a year in her husband’s. And she and\r\nthe doctor have got him in bed and will see that he’s not well enough\r\nto vote! Ha! Ha! So there it is, Mr. Vaughan! There it is! My lord’s\r\noffer, not mine. I believe he’d word from London what you’d be likely\r\nto do. Only he felt a delicacy about moving—until you declared\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” Vaughan replied. And indeed he did see more than he liked.\r\n\r\n“Just so, sir. My lord’s a gentleman if ever there was one!” And Mr.\r\nPybus, pulling down his waistcoat, looked as if he suspected that he\r\nhad imbibed much of his lordship’s gentility.\r\n\r\nVaughan stood, thinking; his eyes gazing into the shimmering depths of\r\ngreen where the branches of the chestnut tree under which he stood\r\nswept the sun-kissed turf. And as he thought he tried to still the\r\nturmoil in his brain. Here within reach of his hand, to take or leave,\r\nwas that which had been his ambition for years! No longer to play at\r\nthe game, no longer to make believe while he addressed the Forum or the\r\nAcademic that he was addressing the Commons of England; but verily and\r\nreally to be one of that august body, and to have all within reach. Had\r\nnot the offer of cabinet honours fallen to Lord Palmerston at\r\ntwenty-five? And what Lord Palmerston had done at twenty-five, he might\r\ndo at thirty-five! And more easily, if he gained a footing before the\r\ncrowd of new members whom the Bill would bring in, took the floor. The\r\nthought set his pulse a-gallop. His chance! His chance at last! But if\r\nhe let it slip now, it might not be his for long years. It is poor work\r\nwaiting for dead men’s shoes.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he hesitated, with a flushed face. For the thing offered\r\nwithout price or preface, by a man who had power to push him, by the\r\nman who even now was pushing Mr. Macaulay at Calne, tempted him sorely.\r\nNor less—nor less because he remembered with bitterness that Sir Robert\r\nhad made him no such offer, and now never would! So that if he refused\r\nthis offer, he could look for no second from either side!\r\n\r\nAnd yet he could not forget that Sir Robert was his kinsman, was the\r\nhead of his family, the donor of his vote. And in the night watches he\r\nhad decided that, his mind delivered, his independence declared, he\r\nwould not vote. Neither for Sir Robert—for conscience’s sake; nor\r\nagainst Sir Robert, for his name’s sake!\r\n\r\nThen how could he not only take an active part against him, but raise\r\nhis fortunes on his fall?\r\n\r\nHe drew a deep breath. And he put the temptation from him. “I am much\r\nobliged to his lordship,” he said quietly. “But I cannot accept his\r\noffer.”\r\n\r\n“Not accept it?” Mr. Pybus cried. “Mr. Vaughan! You don’t mean it, sir!\r\nYou don’t mean it! It’s a safe seat! It’s in your own hands, I tell\r\nyou! And after last night! Besides, it is not as if you had not\r\ndeclared yourself.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot accept it,” Vaughan repeated coldly. “I am obliged to Lord\r\nLansdowne for his kind thought of me. I beg you to convey my thanks to\r\nhim. But I cannot—in the position I occupy—accept the offer.”\r\n\r\nMr. Pybus stared. Was it possible that the scene at the Vermuyden\r\ndinner had been a ruse? A piece of play-acting to gain his secrets? If\r\nso—he was undone! “But,” he quavered with an unhappy eye, “you are in\r\nfavour of the Bill, Mr. Vaughan?”\r\n\r\n“I am.\r\n\r\n“And—and of Reform generally, I understand?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly.”\r\n\r\n“Then—I don’t understand? Why do you refuse?”\r\n\r\nVaughan raised his head and looked at him with a movement which would\r\nhave reminded Isaac White of Sir Robert. “That is my business,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“But you see,” Mr. Pybus remonstrated timidly—he was rather a\r\ncrestfallen bird by this time—“I confess I was never more surprised in\r\nmy life! Never! You see I’ve told you all our secrets.”\r\n\r\n“I shall keep them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but—oh dear! oh dear!” Pybus was thinking of what he had said\r\nabout Mrs. Pillinger of the Blue Duck. “I—I don’t know what to say,” he\r\nadded. “I am afraid I have been too hasty, very hasty! Very\r\nprecipitate! Of course, Mr. Vaughan,” he continued, “the offer would\r\nnot have been made if we had not thought you certain to accept it!”\r\n\r\n“Then,” Vaughan replied with dignity, “you can consider that it has not\r\nbeen made. I shall not name it for certain.”\r\n\r\n“Well! Well!”\r\n\r\n“I can say no more,” Vaughan continued coldly. “Indeed, there is\r\nnothing more to be said, Mr. Pybus?”\r\n\r\n“No,” piteously, “I suppose not. If you really won’t change your mind,\r\nsir?”\r\n\r\n“I shall not do that,” the young man answered. And a minute later with\r\nMr. Pybus’s faint appeals still sounding in his ears he was on the\r\nother side of the garden door, and striding down the alley, towards the\r\nKing’s Wall, whence making a detour he returned to the High Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\nLESS THAN A HERO\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the evening of the day on which the meeting between Arthur\r\nVaughan and Mr. Pybus had taken place, and from the thirty-six windows\r\nin the front of Stapylton lights shone on the dusky glades of the park;\r\nhere, twinkling fairy-like over the long slope of sward that shimmered\r\npale-green as with the ghostly reflection of dead daylight, there,\r\nshining boldly upon the clump of beeches that topped an eminence with\r\nblackness. Vaughan sat beside Isaac White in the carriage which Sir\r\nRobert had sent for him; and looking curiously forth on the demesne\r\nwhich would be his if he lived, he could scarcely believe his eyes. Was\r\nthe old squire so sure of victory that he already illuminated his\r\nwindows? Or was the house, long sparely inhabited, and opened only at\r\nrare intervals and to dull and formal parties, full now from attic to\r\nhall? Election or no election, it seemed unlikely. Yet every window,\r\nyes, every window had its light!\r\n\r\nHe was too proud to question the agent who, his errand done, and his\r\nmessage delivered, showed no desire to talk. More than once, indeed, in\r\nthe course of their short companionship, Vaughan had caught White\r\nlooking at him strangely; with something like pity in his eyes. And\r\nthough the young man was far from letting this distress him—probably\r\nWhite, with his inborn reverence for Sir Robert, despaired of all who\r\nfell under his displeasure—it closed his lips and hardened his heart.\r\nHe was no paid servant; but a kinsman and the heir. And he would have\r\nSir Robert remember this. For his own part, he was not going to forget\r\nwho he was; that a Chancellor had stooped to flatter him and a Cabinet\r\nMinister had offered him a seat. He had refused for a point of honour a\r\nbait which few would have refused; and he was not going to be\r\nbrowbeaten by an old gentleman whom the world had out-paced, and whose\r\nbeliefs, whose prejudices, whose views, were of yesterday. Who, in his\r\nprofound ignorance of present conditions, would plunge England into\r\ncivil war rather than resign a privilege as obsolete as ship-money, and\r\nas illegal as the Dispensing Power.\r\n\r\nWhile he thought of this the carriage stopped at the door. He alighted\r\nand ascended the steps.\r\n\r\nThe hall more than made good the outside promise; it was brilliantly\r\nlighted, and behind Mapp and the servant who received him Vaughan had a\r\npassing glimpse of three or four men in full-dress livery. From the\r\ndining-room on his left issued peals of laughter, and voices, so clear\r\nthat, though he had not the smallest reason to expect to hear them\r\nthere, he was sure that he caught Bob Flixton’s tones. The discovery\r\nwas not pleasing; but Mapp, turning the other way and giving him no\r\ntime to think, went before him to the suite of state-rooms—which he had\r\nnot seen in use more than thrice within his knowledge of the house. It\r\nmust be so then—he thought with a slight shock of surprise. The place\r\nmust be full! For the gilt mirrors in both the large and small\r\ndrawing-rooms reflected the soft light of many candles, wood fires\r\nburned and crackled on the hearths, the “Morning Chronicle,” the\r\n“Quarterly,” and other signs of life lay about on the round tables, and\r\nan air of cheerful _bienséance_ pervaded all. What did it mean?\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert has finished dinner, sir,” Mapp said—even he seemed to wear\r\nan unusual air of solemnity. “He will be with you, sir, immediately.\r\nHope you are well, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Quite well, Mapp, thank you.”\r\n\r\nThen he was left alone—to wonder if a second surprise awaited him. He\r\nhad had one that day. If a second were in store for him what was its\r\nnature? Could Sir Robert on his side be going to offer him one of the\r\nseats—if he would recant? He hoped not. But he had not time to give\r\nmore than a thought to that before he heard footsteps and voices\r\ncrossing the hall. The next moment there entered the outer room—at such\r\na distance from the hearth of the room in which he stood, that he had a\r\nleisurely view of all before they reached him—three persons. The first\r\nwas a tall burly man in slovenly evening clothes, and with an ungainly\r\nrolling walk; after him came Sir Robert himself, and after him again,\r\nIsaac White.\r\n\r\nVaughan advanced a step or two, and Sir Robert passed by the burly man,\r\nwho had a pendulous under lip, and a face at once flabby and\r\nmelancholy. The baronet held out his hand. “We have not quarrelled yet,\r\nMr. Vaughan,” he said, with a cordiality which took Vaughan quite by\r\nsurprise. “I trust and believe that we are not going to quarrel. I bid\r\nyou welcome therefore. This,” he continued with a gesture of courteous\r\ndeference, “is Sir Charles Wetherell, whom you know by reputation, and\r\nwhom, for a reason which you will understand by and by, I have asked to\r\nbe present at our interview.”\r\n\r\nThe stout man eyed Vaughan from under bushy eyebrows. “I think we have\r\nmet before,” he said in a deep voice. “At Westminster, Mr. Vaughan, on\r\nthe 22nd of last month.” He had a habit of blinking as he talked. “I\r\nwas beholden to you on that occasion.”\r\n\r\nVaughan had already recognised him and recalled the incident in Palace\r\nYard. He bowed with an expression of silent sympathy. But he wondered\r\nall the more. The presence of the late attorney-general, a man of mark\r\nin the political world, whose defeat at Norwich was in that morning’s\r\npaper—what did it mean? Did they think to browbeat him? Or—had Sir\r\nCharles Wetherell also an offer to make to him? In any event it seemed\r\nthat he had made himself a personage by his independence. Sought by the\r\none side, sought by the other! A résumé of the answer he would give\r\nflashed before him. However, they were not come to that yet!\r\n\r\n“Will you sit down,” said Sir Robert. The great man’s voice and\r\nmanner—to Vaughan’s surprise—were less autocratic and more friendly\r\nthan he had ever known them. Indeed, in comparison of the lion of last\r\nevening he was but a mouse. “In the first place,” he continued, “I am\r\nobliged to you for your compliance with my wishes.”\r\n\r\nVaughan murmured that he had come at no inconvenience to himself.\r\n\r\n“I hope not,” Sir Robert replied. “In the next place let me say, that\r\nwe have to speak to you on a matter of the first importance; a matter\r\nalso on which we have the advantage of knowledge which you have not. It\r\nis my desire, therefore, to admit you to a parity with us in that\r\nrespect, Mr. Vaughan, before you express yourself on any subject on\r\nwhich we are likely to differ.”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked keenly, almost suspiciously at him; and an observer\r\nwould have noticed that there was a closer likeness between the two men\r\nthan the slender tie of blood warranted. “If it is a question, Sir\r\nRobert,” he said slowly, “of the subject on which we differed last\r\nevening, I would prefer to say at once——”\r\n\r\n“Don’t!” Wetherell, who was seated within a long reach of him, struck\r\nin. “Don’t!” And he laid an elephantine and not over-clean hand on\r\nVaughan’s knee. “You can spill words as easy as water,” he continued,\r\n“and they are as hard to pick up again. Hear what Vermuyden has to say,\r\nand what I’ve to say—’tisn’t much—and then blow your trumpet—if you’ve\r\nany breath left!” he added _sotto voce_, as he threw himself back.\r\n\r\nVaughan hesitated a moment. Then, “Very good,” he said, “if you will\r\nhear me afterwards. But——”\r\n\r\n“But and If are two wenches always raising trouble!” Wetherell cried\r\ncoarsely. “Do you listen, Mr. Vaughan. Do you listen. Now, Vermuyden,\r\ngo on.”\r\n\r\nBut Sir Robert did not seem to have words at command. He took a pinch\r\nof snuff from the gold box with which his fingers trifled: and he\r\nopened his mouth to resume; but he hesitated. At length, “What I have\r\nto tell you, Mr. Vaughan,” he said, in a voice more diffident than\r\nusual, “had perhaps been more properly told by my attorney to yours. I\r\nfully admit that,” dusting the snuff from his frill. “And it would have\r\nbeen so told but for—but for exigencies not immediately connected with\r\nit, which are nevertheless so pressing as to—to induce me to take the\r\none step immediately possible. Less regular, but immediately possible!\r\nIn spite of this, you will believe, I am sure, that I do not wish to\r\ntake any advantage of you other than,” he paused with an embarrassed\r\nlook at Wetherell, “that which my position gives me. For the rest I”—he\r\nlooked again at his snuffbox and hesitated—“I think—I——”\r\n\r\n“You’d better come to the point!” Wetherell growled impatiently,\r\njerking his ungainly person back in his chair, and lurching forward\r\nagain. “To the point, man! Shall I tell him?”\r\n\r\nSir Robert straightened himself—with a sigh of relief. “If you please,”\r\nhe said, “I think you had better. It—it may come better from you, as\r\nyou are not interested.”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked from one to the other, and wondered what on earth they\r\nmeant, and what they would be at. His cordial reception followed by\r\nthis strange exordium, the preparations, the presence of the three men\r\nseated about him and all, it seemed, ill at ease—these things begot\r\ninstinctive misgivings; and an uneasiness, which it was not in the\r\npower of reason to hold futile. What were they meditating? What threat,\r\nwhat inducement? And what meant this strange illumination of the house,\r\nthis air of festivity? It could be nothing to him. And yet—but\r\nWetherell was speaking.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Vaughan,” he said gruffly—and he swayed himself as was his habit\r\nto and fro in his seat, “my friend here, and your kinsman, has made a\r\ndiscovery of—of the utmost possible importance to him; and, speaking\r\ncandidly, of scarcely less importance to you. I don’t know whether you\r\nread the trash they call novels now-a-days—‘The Disowned’” with a snort\r\nof contempt, “and ‘Tremayne’ and the rest? I hope not, I don’t! But\r\nit’s something devilish like the stuff they put in them that I’ve to\r\ntell you. You’ll believe it or not, as you please. You think yourself\r\nheir to the Stapylton estates? Of course you do. Sir Robert has no more\r\nthan a life-interest, and if he has no children, the reversion in fee,\r\nas we lawyers call it, is yours. Just so. But if he has children, son\r\nor daughter, you are ousted, Mr. Vaughan.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going to tell me,” Vaughan said, his face grown suddenly\r\nrigid, “that he has children?” His heart was beating furiously under\r\nhis waistcoat, but, taken aback as he was, he maintained outward\r\ncomposure.\r\n\r\n“That’s it,” Wetherell answered bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Then——”\r\n\r\n“He has a daughter.”\r\n\r\n“It will have to be proved!” Vaughan said slowly and in the tone of a\r\nman who chose his words. And he rose to his feet. He felt, perhaps he\r\nwas justified in feeling, that they had taken him at a disadvantage.\r\nThat they had treated him unfairly in trapping him hither, one to\r\nthree; in order that they might see, perhaps, how he took it! Not—his\r\nthoughts travelled rapidly over the facts known to him—that the thing\r\ncould be true! The punishment for last night’s revolt fell too pat, too\r\n_à propos_, he’d not believe it! And besides, it could not be true. For\r\nLady Vermuyden lived, and there could be no question of a concealed\r\nmarriage, or a low-born family. “It will have to be proved!” he\r\nrepeated firmly. “And is matter rather for my lawyers than for me.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert, too, had risen to his feet. But it was Wetherell who spoke.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so!” he said. “Perhaps so. Indeed I admit it, young sir! It\r\nwill have to be proved. But——”\r\n\r\n“It should have been told to them rather than to me!” Vaughan repeated,\r\nwith a sparkling eye. And he turned as if he were determined to treat\r\nthem as hostile and to have nothing farther to say to them.\r\n\r\nBut Wetherell stopped him. “Stay, young man,” he said, “and be ashamed\r\nof yourself! You forget yourself!” And before Vaughan, stung and angry,\r\ncould retort upon him, “You forget,” he continued, “that this touches\r\nanother as closely as it touches you—and more closely! You are a\r\ngentleman, sir, and Sir Robert’s kinsman. Have you no word then, for\r\nhim!” pointing, with a gesture roughly eloquent, to his host. “You\r\nlose, but have you no word for him who gains! You lose, but is it\r\nnothing to him that he finds himself childless no longer, heirless no\r\nlonger? That his house is no longer lonely, his hearth no longer empty!\r\nMan alive,” he added, dropping with honest indignation to a low note,\r\n“you lose, but what does he not gain? And have you no word, no generous\r\nthought for him? Bah!” throwing himself back in his seat. “Poor human\r\nnature.”\r\n\r\n“Still it must be proved,” said Vaughan sullenly, though in his heart\r\nhe acknowledged the truth of the reproach.\r\n\r\n“Granted! But will you not hear what it is, that is to be proved?”\r\nWetherell retorted. “If so, sit down, sir, sit down, and hear what we\r\nhave to tell you like a man. Will you do that,” in a tone of extreme\r\nexasperation, which did but reflect the slowly hardening expression of\r\nSir Robert’s face, “or are you quite a fool?”\r\n\r\nVaughan hesitated, looking with angry eyes on Wetherell. Then he sat\r\ndown. “Am I to understand,” he said coldly, “that this is news to Sir\r\nRobert?”\r\n\r\n“It was news to him yesterday.”\r\n\r\nVaughan bowed and was silent; aware that a more generous demeanour\r\nwould better become him, but unable to compass it on the spur of the\r\nmoment. He was ignorant—unfortunately—of the spirit in which he had\r\nbeen summoned: consequently he could not guess that every word he\r\nuttered rang churlishly in the ears of more than one of his listeners.\r\nHe was no churl; but he was taken unfairly—as it seemed to him. And to\r\nbe called upon in the first moment of chagrin to congratulate Sir\r\nRobert on an event which ruined his own prospects and changed his\r\nlife—was too much. Too much! But again Wetherell was speaking.\r\n\r\n“You shall know what we know from the beginning,” he said, in his heavy\r\nmelancholy way. “You are aware, I suppose, that Sir Robert married—in\r\nthe year ’10, was it not?—Yes, in the year ’10, and that Lady Vermuyden\r\nbore him one child, a daughter, who died in Italy in the year ’15. It\r\nappears now—we are in a position to prove, I think—that that child did\r\nnot die in that year, nor in any year; but is now alive, is in this\r\ncountry and can be perfectly identified.”\r\n\r\nVaughan coughed. “This is strange news,” he said, “after all these\r\nyears; and somewhat sudden, is it not?”\r\n\r\nSir Robert’s face grew harder, but Wetherell only shrugged his\r\nshoulders. “If you will listen,” he replied, “you will know all that we\r\nknow. It is no secret, at any rate in this room it is no secret, that\r\nin the year ’14 Sir Robert fancied that he had grave reason to be\r\ndispleased with Lady Vermuyden. It was thought by her friends that a\r\nbetter agreement might be produced by a temporary separation, and the\r\nchild’s health afforded a pretext. Accordingly, Sir Robert suffered\r\nLady Vermuyden to take it abroad, her suite consisting of a courier, a\r\nmaid, and a nurse. The nurse she sent back to England not long\r\nafterwards on the plea that an Italian woman from whom the child might\r\nlearn the language would be better. For my part, I believe that she\r\nacted bonâ-fide in this. But in other respects,” puffing out his\r\ncheeks, “her conduct was such as to alarm her husband; and, in terms\r\nperhaps too peremptory, Sir Robert bade her return at once—or cease to\r\nconsider his house as her home. Her answer was the announcement of the\r\nchild’s death.”\r\n\r\n“And that it did not die,” Vaughan murmured, “as Lady Vermuyden said?”\r\n\r\n“We have this evidence. But first let me say, that Sir Robert on the\r\nreceipt of the news set out for Italy overland. The Hundred Days,\r\nhowever, stopped him; he could not cross France, and he returned\r\nwithout certifying the child’s death. He had indeed no suspicion, no\r\nreason for suspicion. Well, then, for evidence that it did not die. The\r\ncourier is dead, and there remains only the maid. She is alive, she is\r\nhere, she is in this house. And it is from her that we have learned the\r\ntruth—that the child did not die.”\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, brooding in his fat, melancholy way on the pattern\r\nof the carpet between his feet. Sir Robert, with a face hard and proud,\r\nsat upright, listening to the tale of his misfortunes—and doubtless\r\nsuffered torments as he listened.\r\n\r\n“Her story,” Wetherell resumed—possibly he had been arranging his\r\nthoughts—“is this. Lady Vermuyden was living a life of the wildest\r\ngaiety. She had no affection for the child; if the woman is to be\r\nbelieved, she hated it. To part with it was nothing to her one way or\r\nthe other, and on receipt of Sir Robert’s order to return, her ladyship\r\nconceived the idea of punishing him by abducting the child and telling\r\nhim it was dead. She set out from Florence with it; on the way she left\r\nit at Orvieto in charge of the Italian nurse, and arriving in Rome she\r\nput about the story of its death. Shortly afterwards she had it carried\r\nto England and bred up in an establishment near London—always with the\r\naid and connivance of her maid.”\r\n\r\n“The maid’s name?” Vaughan asked.\r\n\r\n“Herapath—Martha Herapath. But to proceed. By and by Lady Vermuyden\r\nreturned to England, and settled at Brighton, and the maid left her and\r\nmarried, but continued to draw a pension from her. Lady Vermuyden\r\npersisted here—in the company of Lady Conyng—but I need name no\r\nnames—in the same course of giddiness, if no worse, which she had\r\npursued abroad; and gave little if any heed to the child. But this\r\nwoman Herapath never forgot that the pension she enjoyed was dependent\r\non her power to prove the truth: and when a short time back the girl,\r\nnow well-grown, was withdrawn from her knowledge, she grew restive. She\r\nsought Lady Vermuyden, always a creature of impulse, and when her\r\nladyship, foolish in this as in all things, refused to meet her views\r\nshe—she came to us,” he continued, lifting his head abruptly and\r\nlooking at Vaughan, “and told us the story.”\r\n\r\n“It will have to be proved,” Vaughan said stubbornly.\r\n\r\n“No doubt, strictly proved,” Wetherell replied. “In the meantime if you\r\nwould like to peruse the facts in greater detail, they are here, as\r\ntaken down from the woman’s mouth.” He drew from his capacious\r\nbreast-pocket a manuscript consisting of several sheets which he\r\nunfolded and flattened on his knee. He handed it to Vaughan.\r\n\r\nThe young man took it, without looking at Sir Robert: and with his\r\nthoughts in a whirl—and underlying them a sick feeling of impending\r\nmisfortune—he proceeded to read it, line after line, without taking in\r\na single word. For all the time his brain was at work measuring the\r\nchange. His modest competence would be left to him. He would have\r\nenough to live as he was now living, and to pursue his career; or, in\r\nthe alternative, he might settle down as a small squire in his paternal\r\nhome in South Wales. But the great inheritance which had loomed large\r\nin the background of his life and had been more to him than he had\r\nadmitted, the future dignity which he had undervalued while he thought\r\nit his own, the position more enviable than many a peer’s, and higher\r\nby its traditions than any to which he could attain by his own\r\nexertions, though he reached the Woolsack—these were gone if\r\nWetherell’s tale was true. Gone in a moment, at a word! And though he\r\nmight have lost more, though many a man had lost his all by such a\r\nstroke and smiled, he was no hero, and he could not on the instant\r\nsmile. He could not in a moment oust all bitterness. He knew that he\r\nwas taking the news unworthily; that he was playing a poor part. But he\r\ncould not force himself to play a better—on the instant. When he had\r\nread with unseeing eyes to the bottom of the first page and had turned\r\nit mechanically, he let the papers fall upon his knee.\r\n\r\n“You do not wish me,” he said slowly, “to express an opinion now, I\r\nsuppose?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Wetherell answered. “Certainly not. But I have not quite done. I\r\nhave not quite done,” he repeated ponderously. “I should tell you that\r\nfor opening the matter to you now—we have two reasons, Mr. Vaughan. Two\r\nreasons. First, we think it due to you—as one of the family. And\r\nsecondly, Vermuyden desires that from the beginning, his intentions\r\nshall be clear and—be understood.”\r\n\r\n“I thoroughly understand them,” Vaughan answered drily. No one was more\r\nconscious than he that he was behaving ill.\r\n\r\n“That is just what you do not!” Wetherell retorted stolidly. “You spill\r\nwords, young man, and by and by you will wish to pick them up again.\r\nYou cannot anticipate, at any rate, you have no right to anticipate,\r\nSir Robert’s intentions, of which he has asked me to be the mouthpiece.\r\nThe estate, of course, and the settled funds must go to his daughter.\r\nBut there is, it appears, a large sum arising from the economical\r\nmanagement of the property, which is at his disposal. He feels,”\r\nWetherell continued sombrely, an elbow on each knee and his eyes on the\r\nfloor, “that some injustice has been done to you, and he desires to\r\ncompensate you for that injustice. He proposes, therefore, to secure to\r\nyou the succession to two-thirds of this sum; which amounts—which\r\namounts, in the whole I believe”—here he looked at White—“to little\r\nshort of eighty thousand pounds.”\r\n\r\nVaughan, who had been more than once on the point of interrupting him,\r\ndid so at last. “I could not accept it!” he exclaimed impulsively. And\r\nhe rose, with a hot face, from his seat. “I could not accept it.”\r\n\r\n“As a legacy?” Wetherell, who was fond of money, said with a queer\r\nlook. “As a legacy, eh? Why not?” While Sir Robert, with compressed\r\nlips, almost repented of his generosity. He had looked for some show of\r\ngood-feeling, some word of sympathy, some felicitation from the young\r\nman, who, after all, was his blood relation. But if this was to be his\r\nreturn, if his advances were to be met with suspicion, his benevolence\r\nwith churlishness, then all, all in this young man was of a piece—and\r\ndetestable!\r\n\r\nAnd certainly Vaughan was not showing himself in the best light. He was\r\nconscious that he had taken the news ill; but he could not change his\r\nattitude in a moment. Under no circumstances is it an easy thing to\r\ntake a gift with grace: to take one with grace under these\r\ncircumstances—and when he had already misbehaved—was beyond him, as it\r\nwould have been beyond most men.\r\n\r\nFor a moment drawn this way by his temper, that way by his better\r\nfeelings, he did not know how to answer Wetherell’s last words. At last\r\nand lamely, “May I ask,” he said, “why Sir Robert makes me this offer\r\nwhile the matter lies open?”\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert will prove his case,” Wetherell answered gruffly, “if that\r\nis what you mean.”\r\n\r\n“I mean——”\r\n\r\n“He does not ask you to surrender anything.”\r\n\r\n“I am bound to say, then, that the offer is very generous,” Vaughan\r\nreplied, melting, and speaking with some warmth. “Most generous. But——”\r\n\r\n“He asks you to surrender nothing,” Wetherell repeated stolidly, his\r\nface between his knees.\r\n\r\n“But I still think it is premature,” Vaughan persisted doggedly. “And\r\nhandsome as it is, more than handsome as it is, I think that it would\r\nhave come with greater force, were my position first made clear!”\r\n\r\n“Maybe,” Wetherell said, his face still hidden. “I don’t deny that.”\r\n\r\n“As it is,” with a deep breath, “I am taken by surprise. I do not know\r\nwhat to say. I find it hard to say anything in the first flush of the\r\nmatter.” And Vaughan looked from one to the other. “So, for the\r\npresent, with Sir Robert’s permission,” he continued, “and without any\r\nslight to his generosity, I will take leave. If he is good enough, to\r\nrepeat on some future occasion, this very handsome—this uncalled for\r\nand generous offer, which he has now outlined, I shall know, I hope,\r\nwhat is due to him, without forgetting what is due also to myself. In\r\nthe meantime I have only to thank him and——”\r\n\r\nBut the belated congratulation which was on his lips and which might\r\nhave altered many things, was not to be uttered.\r\n\r\n“One moment!” Sir Robert struck in. “One moment!” He spoke with a\r\nhardness born of long suppressed irritation. “You have taken your\r\nstand, Mr. Vaughan, strictly on the defensive, I see——”\r\n\r\n“But I think you understand——”\r\n\r\n“Strictly on the defensive,” the baronet repeated, requiring silence by\r\na gesture. “You must not be surprised therefore, if I—nay, let me\r\nspeak!—if I also say a word on a point which touches me.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t!” Wetherell growled in his deep voice; and for an instant\r\nhe raised his huge face, and looked stolidly at the wall before him.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Robert was not to be bidden. “I think otherwise,” he said. “Mr.\r\nVaughan, the election to-morrow touches me very nearly—in more ways\r\nthan one. The vote you have, you received at my hands and hold only as\r\nmy heir. I take it for granted, therefore, that under the present\r\ncircumstances, you will use it as I desire.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Vaughan said. And drawing himself up to his full height he passed\r\nhis eyes slowly from one to the other with a singular smile. “Oh!” he\r\nrepeated—and there was a world of meaning in his tone. “Am I to\r\nunderstand then——”\r\n\r\n“I have made myself quite clear,” Sir Robert cried, his manner\r\nbetraying his agitation.\r\n\r\n“Am I to understand,” Vaughan persisted, “that the offer which you made\r\nme a few minutes back, the generous and handsome offer,” he continued\r\nwith a faint note of irony in his voice, “was dependent on my conduct\r\nto-morrow? Am I to understand that?”\r\n\r\n“If you please to put it so,” Sir Robert replied, his voice quivering\r\nwith the resentment he had long and patiently suppressed. “And if your\r\nown sense of honour does not dictate to you how to act.”\r\n\r\n“But do you put it so?”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean——”\r\n\r\n“I mean,” Vaughan said, “does the offer depend on the use I make of my\r\nvote to-morrow? That is the point, Sir Robert!”\r\n\r\n“No,” Wetherell muttered indistinctly.\r\n\r\nBut again Sir Robert would not be bidden. “I will be frank,” he said\r\nhaughtily. “And my answer is, yes! yes! For I do not conceive, Mr.\r\nVaughan, that a gentleman would take so great a benefit, and refuse so\r\nslight a service! A service, too, which, quite apart from this offer,\r\nmost men——”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” Vaughan replied, interrupting him. “That is clear enough.”\r\nAnd he looked from one to the other with a smile of amusement; the\r\nsmile of a man suddenly reinstated in his own opinion—and once more\r\nmaster of his company. “Now I understand,” he continued. “I see now why\r\nthe offer which a few minutes ago seemed so premature, so strangely\r\npremature, was made this evening. To-morrow it had been made too late!\r\nMy vote had been cast and I could no longer be—bribed!”\r\n\r\n“Bribed, sir?” cried Sir Robert, red with anger.\r\n\r\n“Yes, bribed, sir. But let me tell you,” Vaughan went on, allowing the\r\nbitterness which he had been feeling to appear, “let me tell you, Sir\r\nRobert, that if not only my future, but my present, if my all, were at\r\nstake—I should resent such an offer as an insult!”\r\n\r\nSir Robert took a step towards the bell and stopped.\r\n\r\n“An insult!” Vaughan repeated firmly. “As great an insult as I should\r\ninflict upon you, if I were unwise enough to do the errand I was asked\r\nto do a week ago—by a cabinet minister. And offered you, Sir Robert,\r\nhere in your own house, a peerage conditional on your support of the\r\nBill!”\r\n\r\n“A peerage?” Sir Robert’s eyes seemed to be starting from his head. “A\r\npeerage! Conditional on my——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, conditional on your renunciation of those opinions which you\r\nhonestly hold as I honestly hold mine!” Vaughan repeated coolly. “I\r\nwill make the offer if you wish it.”\r\n\r\nWetherell rose ponderously. “See here!” he said. “Listen to me, will\r\nyou, you two! You, Vermuyden, as well as the young man. You will both\r\nbe sorry for what you are saying now! Listen to me! Listen to me, man!”\r\n\r\nBut the baronet was already tugging at the bell-rope. He was no longer\r\nred; he was white with anger. And not without reason. This\r\nwhipper-snapper, this pettifogging lad, just out of his teens, to talk\r\nto him of peerages, to patronise him, to offer him—to—to——\r\n\r\nFor a moment he stammered and could not speak. At last, “Enough!\r\nEnough, sir; leave my house!” he cried, shaking from head to foot with\r\npassion, and losing for the first time in many years his self-control.\r\n“Leave my house,” he repeated furiously, “and never set foot in it\r\nagain! Not a pound, and not a penny will you have of mine! Never!\r\nNever! Never!”\r\n\r\nVaughan smiled, “Very good, sir,” he said, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n“Your fortune is your own. But——”\r\n\r\n“Begone, sir! Not another word, but go!”\r\n\r\nVaughan raised his eyebrows, bowed in a ceremonious fashion to\r\nWetherell, and nodded to White, who stood petrified and gaping. Then he\r\nwalked slowly through that room and the next, and with one backward\r\nsmile—vanished.\r\n\r\nAnd this time, as he passed through the hall, narrowly missing Flixton\r\nwho was leaving the dining-room, there could be no doubt that the\r\nbreach was complete, that the small cordiality which had existed\r\nbetween the two men was at an end. The Bill, which had played so many\r\nmischievous tricks, severed so many old friends, broken the ties of so\r\nmany years, had dealt no one a more spiteful blow than it had dealt\r\nArthur Vaughan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\nTHE CHIPPINGE ELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great day on which the Borough of Chippinge was to give its vote,\r\nAye or No, Reform or No Reform, the Rule of the Few or the Rule of the\r\nMany, was come; and in the large room on the first floor of the White\r\nLion were assembled a score of persons deeply interested in the issue.\r\nThose who had places at the three windows were gazing on what was going\r\nforward in the space below; and it was noticeable that while the two or\r\nthree who remained in the background talked and joked, these were\r\nsilent; possibly because the uproar without made hearing difficult. The\r\nhour was early, the business of the day was to come, but already the\r\nhub-bub was indescribable. Nor was that all; every minute some missile,\r\na much enduring cabbage-stalk, or a dead cat in Tory colours, rose to a\r\nlevel with the windows, hovered, and sank—amid a storm of groans or\r\ncheers. For the most part, indeed, these missiles fell harmless. But\r\nthat the places of honour at the windows were not altogether places of\r\nsafety was proved by a couple of shattered panes, as well as by the\r\nsickly hue of some among the spectators.\r\n\r\nNearly all who had attended the Vermuyden dinner were in the room. But,\r\nfor certain, things which had worn one aspect across the mahogany, wore\r\nanother now. At the table old and young had made light of the shoving\r\nand mauling and drubbing through which they had forced their way to the\r\ngood things before them; they had even made a jest of the bit of a rub\r\nthey were likely to have on the polling day. Now, the sight of the\r\nnoisy crowd which filled the open space, from the head of the High\r\nStreet to the wall of the Abbey, and from the Vineyard east of it,\r\nalmost to the West Port—made their bones ache. They looked, even the\r\nboldest, at one another. The heart of Dewell, the barber, was in his\r\nboots; the rector stared aghast; and Mowatt, the barrister, Arthur\r\nVaughan’s ill-found friend, wished for once that he was on the vulgar\r\nside.\r\n\r\nTrue, the doors of the White Lion were guarded by a sturdy phalanx of\r\nVermuyden lads; mustered with what difficulty and kept together by what\r\narguments, White best knew. But what were two or three score, however\r\nfaithful, and however strong, against the hundreds and thousands who\r\nswayed and cheered and groaned before the Inn? Who swarmed upon the old\r\ntown-cross until they hid every inch of the crumbling stonework; who\r\nclung to every niche and buttress of the Abbey; and from whose mass as\r\nfrom a sea the solitary church spire rose like some lighthouse cut off\r\nby breakers? Who, here, forgetful of their Wiltshire birth cheered the\r\nBirmingham tub-thumper to the echo, and there, roared stern assent to\r\nthe wildest statements of the Political Union?\r\n\r\nTrue, a dozen banners and thrice as many flags gave something of a\r\nfestive air to the scene. But the timid who tried to draw solace from\r\nthese retreated appalled by the daring “Death or Freedom!” inscribed on\r\none banner: or the scarcely less bold “The Sovereign People,” which\r\nbellied above the clothiers. The majority of the placards bore nothing\r\nworse than the watchword of the party: “The Bill, the whole Bill, and\r\nnothing but the Bill!” or “Retrenchment and Reform!” or—in reference to\r\nthe King—“God bless the two Bills!” But for all that, Dewell, the\r\nbarber—and some more who would not have confessed it—wished the day\r\nwell over and no bones broken! A great day for Chippinge, but a day on\r\nwhich many an old score was like to be paid, many a justice to hear the\r\ncommonalty’s opinion of him, many a man who had thriven under the old\r\nrule, to read the writing on the wall!\r\n\r\nCertainly nothing like the spectacle visible from the White Lion\r\nwindows had been seen in Chippinge within living memory. The Abbey,\r\nindeed, which had seen the last of the mitred Abbots pass out—shorn of\r\nhis strength, and with weeping townsfolk about him in lieu of belted\r\nknights—that pile, stately in its ruin, which had witnessed a\r\nrevolution greater even than this which impended, and more tragic,\r\nmight have viewed its pair, might have seen its precincts seethe as\r\nthey seethed now. But no living man. Nor did those who scanned the\r\ncrowd from the White Lion find aught to lessen its terrors. There were,\r\nindeed, plenty of decent, respectable people in the crowd, who, though\r\nthey were set on gaining their rights, had no notion of violence. But\r\nwood burns when it is kindled: and here at the corner of the Heart and\r\nHand, the Whig headquarters, was a spark like to light the fire—Boston,\r\nthe bruiser, and a dozen of his fellows; men who were, one and all, the\r\nidols of the yokels who stood about them and stared. Pybus, who had\r\nbrought them hither, was not to be seen; he was weaving his spells in\r\nthe Heart and Hand. But Mr. Williams, White-Hat Williams, the richest\r\nman in Chippinge, who, voteless, had only lived of late to see this\r\nday—he was here at the head of his clothmen, and as fierce as the\r\npoorest. And half-a-dozen lesser men there were of the same kind;\r\nsallow Blackford, the Methodist, the fugleman of every dissenter within\r\nten miles; and two or three small lawyers whom the landlords did not\r\nemploy, and two or three apothecaries who were in the same case. With\r\nthese were one or two famished curates, with Sydney Smith for their\r\nwarranty, and his saying about Dame Partington’s Mop and the Atlantic\r\non their lips; and a sprinkling of spouters from the big towns—men who\r\nhad the glories of Orator Hunt and William Cobbett before their eyes.\r\nAnd everywhere, working in the mass like yeast, moved a score of bitter\r\nmalcontents—whom the old system had bruised under foot—poachers whom\r\nSir Robert had jailed, or the lovers of maids as frail as fair, or\r\nlabourers whom the Poor Laws had crushed—a score of malcontents whose\r\ngrievances long muttered in pothouses now flared to light and cried for\r\nvengeance. In a word, there were the elements of mischief in the crowd:\r\nand under the surface an ugly spirit. Even the most peaceable were\r\ngrim, knowing it was now or never. So that the faces at the White Lion\r\nwindows grew longer as their owners gazed and listened.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what’s come to the people!” the Rector bawled, turning\r\nabout to make himself heard by his neighbour. “Eh, what?”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to see Lord Grey hung!” answered Squire Rowley, his face\r\npurple. “And Lord Lansdowne with him! What do you say, sir?” to\r\nSergeant Wathen.\r\n\r\n“Fortunate a show of hands don’t carry it!” the Sergeant cried,\r\nshrugging his shoulders with an assumption of easiness.\r\n\r\n“Carry it? Of course we’ll carry it!” the Squire replied wrathfully. “I\r\nsuppose two and two still make four!”\r\n\r\nIsaac White, who was whispering with a man in a corner of the room,\r\nwished that he was sure of that; or, rather, that three and two made\r\nsix. But the Squire was continuing. “Bah!” he cried in disgust. “Give\r\nthese people votes? Look at ’em! Look at ’em, sir! Votes indeed! Votes\r\nindeed! Give ’em oakum, I say!”\r\n\r\nHe forgot that nine-tenths of those below were as good as the voters at\r\nhis elbow, who were presently to return two members for Chippinge. Or\r\nrather, it did not occur to him, good old Tory as he was, and\r\nconvinced,\r\n\r\n_’Twas the Jacobins brought every mischief about_,\r\n\r\n\r\nthat Dewell’s vote was Dewell’s, or Annibal’s Annibal’s.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, “I wish we were safe at the hustings!” young Mowatt shouted\r\nin the ear of the man who stood in front of him.\r\n\r\nThe man chanced to be Cooke, the other candidate. He turned. “At the\r\nhustings?” he said irascibly. “Do you mean, sir, that we are expected\r\nto fight our way through that rabble?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid we must,” Mowatt answered.\r\n\r\n“Then it—has been d——d badly arranged!” retorted the outraged Cooke,\r\nwho never forgot that as he paid well for his seat it ought to be a\r\nsoft one. “Go through this mob, and have our heads broken?”\r\n\r\nThe faces of those who could hear him grew longer. “And it wants only\r\nfive minutes of ten,” complained a third. “We ought to be going now.”\r\n\r\n“D——n me, but suppose they don’t let us go!” cried Cooke. “Badly\r\narranged! I should think it is, sir! D——d badly arranged! The hustings\r\nshould have been on this side.”\r\n\r\nBut hitherto the hustings had been at Chippinge a matter of form, and\r\nit had not occurred to anyone to alter their position—cheek by jowl\r\nwith the Whig headquarters, but divided by seventy yards of seething\r\nmob from the White Lion. However, White, on an appeal being made to\r\nhim, put a better face on the matter. “It’s all right, gentlemen,” he\r\nsaid, “it’s all right! If they have the hustings, we have the returning\r\nofficer, and they can do nothing without us. I’ve seen Mr. Pybus, and I\r\nhave his safe conduct for our party to go to the hustings.”\r\n\r\nBut it is hard to satisfy everybody, and at this there was a fresh\r\noutcry. “A safe conduct?” cried the Squire, redder about the gills than\r\nbefore. “For shame, sir! Are we to be indebted to the other side for a\r\nsafe conduct! I never heard of such a thing!”\r\n\r\n“I quite agree with you,” cried the Rector. “Quite! I protest, Mr.\r\nWhite, against anything of the kind.”\r\n\r\nBut White was unmoved. “We’ve got to get our voters there,” he said.\r\n“Sir Robert will be displeased, I know, but——”\r\n\r\n“Never was such a thing heard of!”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, but never was such an election,” White answered with spirit.\r\n\r\n“Where is Sir Robert?”\r\n\r\n“He’ll be here presently,” White replied. “He’ll be here presently.\r\nAnyway, gentlemen,” he continued, “we had better be going down to the\r\nhall. In a body, gentlemen, if you please, and voters in the middle.\r\nAnd keep together, if you please. A little shouting,” he added\r\ncheerfully, “breaks no bones. We can shout too!”\r\n\r\nThe thing was unsatisfactory, and without precedent; nay, humiliating.\r\nBut there seemed to be nothing else for it. As White said, this\r\nelection was not as other elections; Bath was lost, and Bristol, too,\r\nit was whispered; the country was gone mad. And so, frowning and\r\nill-content, the magnates trooped out, and led by White began to\r\ndescend the stairs. There was much confusion, one asking if the\r\nAlderman was there, another demanding to see Sir Robert, here a man\r\ngrumbling about White’s arrangements, there a man silent over the\r\ndiscovery, made perhaps for the first time, that here was like to be an\r\nend of old Toryism and the loaves and the fishes it had dispensed.\r\n\r\nIn the hall where the party was reinforced by a crowd of their smaller\r\nsupporters a man plucked White’s sleeve and drew him aside. “She’s out\r\nnow!” he whispered. “Pybus has left two with him and they won’t leave\r\nhim for me. But if you went and ordered them out there’s a chance\r\nthey’d go, and——”\r\n\r\n“The doctor’s not there?”\r\n\r\n“No, and Pillinger’s well enough to come, if you put it strong. He’s\r\nafraid of his wife and they’ve got him body and soul, but——”\r\n\r\nWhite cast a despairing eye on the confusion about him. “How can I\r\ncome?” he muttered. “I must get these to the poll first.”\r\n\r\n“Then you’ll never do it!” the man retorted. “There’ll be no coming and\r\ngoing, to-day, Mr. White, you take it from me. Now’s the time while\r\nthey’re waiting for you in front. You can slip out at the back and\r\nbring him in and take him with you. It’s the only way, so help me!\r\nThey’re in that temper we’ll be lucky if we’re all alive to-morrow!”\r\n\r\nThe man was right; and White knew it, yet he hesitated. If he had had\r\nan _aide_ fit for the task, the thing might be done. But to go\r\nhimself—he on whom everything fell! He reflected. Possibly Arthur\r\nVaughan might not vote for the enemy after all. But if he did, Sir\r\nRobert would poll only five to six, and be beaten! Unless he polled\r\nPillinger, when the returning officer’s vote, of which he was sure,\r\nwould give him the election. Pillinger’s vote, therefore, was vital;\r\neverything turned upon it. And he determined to go. His absence would\r\nonly cause a little delay, and he must risk that. He slipped away.\r\n\r\nHe was missed at once, and the discovery redoubled the confusion. One\r\nasked where he was, and another where Sir Robert was; while Cooke in\r\ntones louder and more irritable than was prudent found fresh fault, and\r\nwished to heaven that he had never seen the place. Long accustomed to\r\none-sided contests of which both parties knew the issue, the Tory\r\nmanagers were helpless; they were aware that the hour had struck, and\r\nthat they were expected, but without White they were uncertain how to\r\nact. Some cried that White had gone on, and that they should follow;\r\nsome that Sir Robert was to meet them at the hustings, others that they\r\nmight as well be home as waiting there! While the babel without\r\ndeafened and distracted them. At last, without order given, they found\r\nthemselves moving out.\r\n\r\nTheir reception did not clear their brains. Such a roar of execration\r\nas greeted them had never been heard in Chippinge: the hair on Dewell,\r\nthe barber’s, head stood up, the Alderman’s checks grew pale, Cooke\r\ndropped his cane, the stoutest flinched. Changed indeed were the times\r\nfrom those a year or two past when their exit had been greeted by\r\nsycophantic cheers, or, at worst, by a little good-humoured jesting!\r\nNow the whole multitude in the open, not in one part, but in every\r\npart, knew as by instinct of their setting forth, brandished on the\r\ninstant a thousand arms at them, deafened them with a thousand voices,\r\ndemanded monotonously “The Bill! The Bill!” Nor had the demonstration\r\nstopped there, but for the intervention of a body of a hundred Whig\r\nstalwarts who, posting themselves on the flanks of the derided\r\nprocession, conferred on its slow march an ignoble safety.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that many a one who found himself thus guarded rubbed his\r\neyes. The times were changed indeed! No more despotism of Squire and\r\nParson, no more monopoly of places, no more nominated members, no more\r\nelections that did but mock men who had no share in them, no more\r\n“Cripples,” no more snug jobs! The Tories might agree with Mr. Fudge\r\n\r\n_That this passion for roaring had come in of late\r\nSince the rabble all tried for a voice in the State_,\r\n\r\n\r\nand foretell the ruinous outcome of it. But the thing was, the\r\nmany-headed, the many-handed had them in its grip. They must go meekly,\r\nor not at all; with visions of French fish-fags and guillotines before\r\ntheir eyes, and wondering, most of them—as they tried to show a bold\r\nfront, tried to wave their banners and give some answering shout to the\r\nsea that beat upon them—how they would get home again with whole skins!\r\n\r\nPerhaps there was only one of them who never had that thought; though\r\nhe, alone of them all, was unaware of the precautions taken for his\r\nsafety. That was Sir Robert Vermuyden, the master of all, the patron,\r\nthe Borough-monger! Attended by Bob Flixton, who had come with him from\r\nBristol to see the fun—and whose voice it will be remembered Vaughan\r\nhad overheard at Stapylton the evening before—and by two or three other\r\nguests, he had entered the White Lion from the rear; arriving in time\r\nto fall in—somewhat surprised at his supporters’ precipitation—at the\r\ntail of the procession. The moment he was recognised by the crowd he\r\nwas greeted with a roar of “Down with the Borough-monger!” that fairly\r\nappalled his companions. But he faced it calmly, imperturbably,\r\nquietly; a little paler, a little prouder, and a little sterner perhaps\r\nthan usual, but with a gleam in his eyes that had not been seen in them\r\nfor years. For answer to all he smiled with a curling lip: and it is\r\nprobable that as much as any hour in his life he enjoyed this hour,\r\nwhich put him to the test before those over whom he had ruled so long.\r\nHis caste might be passing, the days of his power might be numbered,\r\nthe waves of democracy might be rising about the system in which he\r\nbelieved the safety of England to lie; but no man should see him\r\nfalter. No veteran of the old noblesse in days which Sir Robert could\r\nremember had gone to his fate more proudly than the English patrician\r\nwas prepared to go to his, ay, and though worse than the guillotine\r\nawaited him.\r\n\r\nHis contemptuous attitude, his fearless bearing, impressed the crowd,\r\nappreciative at bottom, of courage. And presently, where he turned his\r\ncold, smiling eyes they gaped instead of hissing: and one here and\r\nthere under the magic of his look doffed hat or carried hand to\r\nforehead, and henceforth was mute. And so great is the sympathy of all\r\nparts of a mob that this silence spread quickly, mysteriously, at last,\r\nwholly. So that when he, last of his party, stepped on the hustings,\r\nthere was for a moment a complete stillness; a stillness of\r\nexpectation, while he looked round; such a stillness as startled the\r\nleaders of the opposition. It could not be—it could not be, that after\r\nall, the old lion would prove too much for them!\r\n\r\nWhite-Hat Williams roared aloud in his rage. “Up hats and shout, lads,”\r\nhe yelled, “or by G—d the d——d Tories will do us after all! Are you\r\nafraid of them, you lubbers! Shout, lads, shout!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\nTHE CHIPPINGE ELECTION (Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beast that was in the crowd answered to the spur. “Ye’ve robbed us\r\nlong enough, ye old rascal!” a harsh Midland voice shrieked over the\r\nheads of the throng. “We’ll have our rights now, you blood-sucker!” And\r\n“Boo! Boo!” the lower elements of the mob broke forth. And then in\r\nstern cadence, “The Bill! The Bill! The Bill!”\r\n\r\n“Out of Egypt, and out of the House of Bondage!” shrieked a Methodist\r\nabove the hub-bub.\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay!”\r\n\r\n“Slaves no longer!”\r\n\r\n“No! No! No!”\r\n\r\n“Hear that, ye hoary tyrant!” in a woman’s shrill tones. “Who jailed my\r\nman for a hare?”\r\n\r\nA roar of laughter which somewhat cleared the air followed this. Sir\r\nRobert smiled grimly.\r\n\r\nThe hustings, a mere wooden platform, raised four feet above the\r\nground, rested against the Abbey gateway. It was closed at the rear and\r\nat each end; but in front it was guarded only by a stout railing. And\r\nso public was it, and so exposed its dangerous eminence, that the more\r\ntimid of the unpopular party were no sooner upon it than they yearned\r\nfor the safe obscurity of the common level. Of the three booths into\r\nwhich the interior was divided, the midmost was reserved for the\r\nreturning officer and his staff.\r\n\r\nBob Flixton, who kept close to Sir Robert’s elbow, looked down on the\r\nsea of jeering faces. “I tell you what it is,” he said. “We’re going to\r\nhave a confounded row!”\r\n\r\nMowatt, at some distance from him, was of the same opinion, but\r\nregarded the outlook differently. “It’s my belief,” he muttered, “that\r\nwe shall all be murdered.”\r\n\r\nAnd “D——n the Bill!” the old Squire ejaculated. “The people are off\r\ntheir heads! Jack as good as his master, and better too!”\r\n\r\nThese four, with the candidates, were in the front row. The Rector, the\r\nAlderman, and one or two of the neighbouring gentry shared the honour;\r\nand faced as well as they could the hooting and yelling, and the\r\noccasional missile. In the front of the other booth were White-Hat\r\nWilliams and Blackford, the minister, Mr. Wrench, the candidate,\r\nwreathed in smiles, a pair of Whig Squires from the Bowood side, a\r\ncurate of the same colour, Pybus—and Arthur Vaughan!\r\n\r\nA thrill ran through Sir Robert’s supporters when they saw his young\r\nkinsman on the other side; actually on the other side and arrayed\r\nagainst them. Their hearts, already low, sank a peg lower. Of evil\r\nomens this seemed the worst; sunk is the cause the young desert! And\r\nmany were the curious eyes that searched the renegade’s features and\r\nstrove to read his thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut in vain. His head high, his face firmly composed, Vaughan looked\r\nstonily before him. Nor was it possible to say whether he was really\r\nunmoved, was stolidly indifferent, or merely masked agitation. Sir\r\nRobert on his side never looked at him, nor betrayed any sense of his\r\npresence. But he knew. He knew! And with the first bitter presage of\r\ndefeat—for he was not a man to be intimidated by noise—he repeated his\r\nvow: “Not a pound, nor a penny! Never! Never!” This public\r\nrenunciation, this wanton defiance—he would never forgive it!\r\nHenceforth, it must be war to the knife between them. No thousands, no\r\ncompensation, no compromise! As the young man was sowing, so he should\r\nreap. He who, in its darkest hour not only insulted but abandoned his\r\nfamily, what punishment was too severe for him?\r\n\r\nVaughan could make a good guess at the proud autocrat’s feelings: and\r\nhe averted his eyes with care. The proceedings here opened, and he\r\nlistened laughingly; until midway in the reading of some document which\r\nno one heeded—the crowd jeering and flouting merrily—he caught a new\r\nnote in the turmoil. The next moment he was conscious of a swirling\r\nmovement among those below him, there was a rush of the throng to his\r\nright, and he looked quickly to see what it meant.\r\n\r\nA man—one of a group of three or four who appeared to be trying to push\r\ntheir way through the crowd—was being hustled and flung to and fro amid\r\njeers and taunts. He was striving to gain the hustings, but was still\r\nsome way from it; and his chance of reaching it with his clothes on his\r\nback seemed small. Vaughan saw so much; then the man lost his temper,\r\nand struck a blow. It was returned—and then, not till then, Vaughan saw\r\nthat the man was Isaac White. He cried “Shame!”—and had passed one leg\r\nover the barriers to go to the rescue, when he saw that another was\r\nbefore him. Sir Robert’s tall, spare figure was down among the\r\ncrowd—which opened instinctively before his sharp command. His eyes,\r\nhis masterful air still had power; the press opened instinctively\r\nbefore his sharp command. He had reached White, had extricated him, and\r\nturned to make good his retreat, when it seemed to strike the more\r\nbrutal element in the crowd—mostly strangers to him—that here was the\r\nprime enemy of the cause, on foot amongst them, at their mercy! A rush\r\nwas made at his back. He turned undaunted, White and two more at his\r\nside; the rabble recoiled. But when he wheeled again, a second rush was\r\nmade, and they were upon him, and hustled him before he could turn. A\r\nman with a long stick struck off his hat, another—a lout with a cockade\r\nof amber and blue, the Whig colours—tried to trip him up. He stumbled,\r\nat the same moment a third man knocked White down.\r\n\r\n“Yah! Down with him!” roared the crowd, “Down with the Borough-monger!”\r\n\r\nBut Vaughan, who had anticipated rather than seen the stumble, was over\r\nthe rail, and cleaving the crowd, was at his side. He reached him a\r\nlittle in front of Bob Flixton, who had descended to the rescue from\r\nthe other end of the booth. Vaughan hurled back the man who had tripped\r\nSir Robert and who was still trying to throw him down; and the sight of\r\nthe amber and blue which the new champion wore checked the assailants,\r\nand gave White time to rise.\r\n\r\nVaughan was furious. “Back, you cowards!” he cried fiercely. “Would you\r\nmurder an old man? Shame on you! Shame!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, you bullies!” cried Flixton, hitting one on the jaw very\r\nneatly—and completely disposing of that one for the day. “Back with\r\nyou!”\r\n\r\nAs Vaughan spoke, half-a-dozen of his Tory supporters surrounded the\r\nbaronet and bore him back out of danger. Though Sir Robert was\r\nundaunted, he was shaken; and breathing quickly, he let his hand rest\r\nfor support on the nearest shoulder. It was Vaughan’s, and the next\r\ninstant he saw that it was; and he withdrew the hand as if he had let\r\nit rest on a hot iron.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Flixton,” he said—and the words reached a dozen ears at least,\r\n“your arm, if you please? I would rather be without this gentleman’s\r\nassistance.”\r\n\r\nVaughan’s face flamed. But neither the words nor the action took him\r\nunawares. He stepped back with dignity, slightly touched his hat, and\r\nso returned to his side of the hustings.\r\n\r\nBut he was wounded and very angry. Alone of his party he had\r\nintervened—and this was his reward. When Pybus pushed his way to his\r\nside and stooped to his ear, talking quickly and earnestly, he did not\r\nrepel him.\r\n\r\nEpisode as it was, the affray startled Sir Robert’s friends: and White\r\nin particular took it very seriously. If violence of this sort was to\r\nrule, if even Sir Robert’s person was not respected, he saw that he\r\nwould not be able to bring his voters to the poll. They would run some\r\nrisk of losing their lives, and one or two for certain would not dare\r\nto vote. The thing must be stopped, and at once. With this in view he\r\nmade his way to the passage at the back of the hustings, which was\r\ncommon to all three booths, and heated and angry—his lip was cut by the\r\nblow he had received—he called for Pybus. But the press at the back of\r\nthe hustings was great, and one of White-Hat Williams’s foremen, who\r\nblocked the gangway, laughed in his face.\r\n\r\n“I want to speak to Pybus,” said White, glaring at the man, who on\r\nordinary days would have touched his hat to him.\r\n\r\n“Then want’ll be your master,” the other retorted, with a wink. And\r\nwhen White tried to push by him, the man gave him the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Let me pass,” White foamed. No thought of Cobbett now, had the agent!\r\nThese miserable upstarts, their insolence, their certainty of triumph\r\nfired his blood. “Let me pass!” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“See you d——d first!” the other answered bluntly. “Your game’s up, old\r\ncock! Your master has held the pit long enough, but his time’s come.”\r\n\r\n“If you don’t——”\r\n\r\n“If you put your nose in here, we’ll pitch you over the rail!” the\r\nother declared.\r\n\r\nWhite almost had a fit. Fortunately White-Hat Williams himself appeared\r\nat this moment: and White appealed to him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Williams,” he said, “is this your safe conduct?”\r\n\r\n“I gave none,” with a grin.\r\n\r\n“Pybus did.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, for your party! But if you choose to straggle in one by one, we\r\ncan’t be answerable for every single voter,” with a wink. “Nor for any\r\nof you getting back again! No, no, White.\r\n\r\n“_Beneath the ways of Ministers, and it’s the truth I tell, You’ve\r\nbought us very cheap, good White, and you’ve sold us very well!_\r\n\r\nBut that’s over! That’s at an end to-day! But—what’s this?”\r\n\r\nThis, was Sir Robert stepping forward to propose his candidates: or\r\nrather, it was the roar, mocking and defiant, which greeted his attempt\r\nto do so. It was a roar that made speech impossible. No doubt, among\r\nthe crowd which filled the space through which he had driven so often\r\nwith his four horses, the great man, the patron, the master of all,\r\nthere were some who still respected, and more who feared him; and many\r\nwho would not have insulted him. For if he had used his power stiffly,\r\nhe had not used it ill. But there were also in the crowd men whose\r\nhearts were hot against the exclusiveness which had long effaced them;\r\nwho believed that freedom or slavery hung on the issue of this day; who\r\nsaw the prize of a long and bitter effort at stake, and were set on\r\nusing every intimidation, ay, and every violence, if victory could not\r\nbe had without them. And, were the others many or few, these swept them\r\naway, infected them with recklessness, gave that stern and mocking ring\r\nto the roar which continued and thwarted Sir Robert’s every effort to\r\nmake himself heard.\r\n\r\nHe stood long facing them, waiting, and never blenching. But after a\r\nwhile his lip curled and his eyes looked disdain on the mob below him:\r\nsuch disdain as the old Duke in after days hurled at the London rabble,\r\nwhen for answer to their fulsome cheers he pointed to the iron shutters\r\nof Apsley House. Sir Robert Vermuyden had done something, and thought\r\nthat he had done more, for the men who yelped and snarled and snapped\r\nat him. According to his lights, acting on his maxim, all for the\r\npeople and nothing by the people, he had treated them generously,\r\ngranted all he thought good for them, planned for them, wrought for\r\nthem. He had been master, but no task-master. He had indeed illustrated\r\nthe better side of that government of the many by the few, of the unfit\r\nby the fit, with which he honestly believed the safety and the\r\ngreatness of his country to be bound up.\r\n\r\nAnd this was their return! No wonder that, seeing things as he saw\r\nthem, he felt a bitter contempt for them. Freedom? Such freedom as was\r\ngood for them, such freedom as was permanently possible—they had. And\r\nslavery? Was it slavery to be ruled, wisely and firmly, by a class into\r\nwhich they might themselves rise, a class which education and habit had\r\nqualified to rule. In his mind’s eye, as he looked down on this\r\nfretting, seething mass, he saw that which they craved granted, and he\r\nsaw, too, the outcome; that most cruel of all tyrannies, the tyranny of\r\nthe many over the few, of the many who have neither a heart to feel nor\r\na body to harm!\r\n\r\nOnce, twice, thrice one of his supporters thrust himself forward, and\r\nleaning on the rail, appealed with frantic gestures for silence, for a\r\nhearing, for respect. But each in turn retired baffled. Not a word in\r\nthat tempest of sound was audible. And no one on the other side\r\nintervened. For they were pitiless. They in the old days had suffered\r\nthe same thing: and it was their turn now. Even Vaughan stood with\r\nfolded arms and a stern face: feeling the last contempt for the howling\r\nrabble before him, but firmly determined to expose himself to no second\r\nslight. At length Sir Robert saw that it was hopeless, shrugged his\r\nshoulders with quiet scorn, and shouting the names of his candidates in\r\na clerk’s ear, put on his hat, and stood back.\r\n\r\nThe old Squire seconded him in dumb show.\r\n\r\nThen the Sergeant stood forward to state his views. He grasped the rail\r\nwith both hands and waited, smiling blandly. But he might have waited\r\nan hour, he might have waited until night. The leaders for the Bill\r\nwere determined to make their power felt. They were resolved that not a\r\nword on the Tory side should be heard. The Sergeant waited, and after a\r\ntime, still smiling blandly, bowed and stood back.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Cooke’s turn. He advanced. “Shout, and be hanged to you!” he\r\ncried, apoplectic in the face. An egg flew within a yard of him, and\r\nopenly shaking his fist at the crowd he retired amid laughter.\r\n\r\nThen White-Hat Williams, who had looked forward to this as to the\r\ngolden moment of his life and had conned his oration until he knew its\r\nthunderous periods by heart, stepped forward to nominate the Whig\r\ncandidates. He took off his hat; and as if that had been the signal for\r\nsilence, such a stillness fell on all that his voice rang above the\r\nmultitude like a trumpet.\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen,” he said, and smiling looked first to the one side and then\r\nto the other. “Gentlemen——”\r\n\r\nAlas, he smiled too soon. The Tories grasped the situation, and,\r\nfurious at the reception which had fallen to the lot of their leaders,\r\ndetermined that if they were not heard, no one should be heard. Before\r\nhe could utter another word they broke into rabid bellowings, and what\r\ntheir shouts lacked in volume they made up in ill-will. In a twinkling\r\nthey drowned White-Hat Williams’s voice; and now who so indignant as\r\nthe Whigs? In thirty seconds half-a-dozen single combats were\r\nproceeding in front of the Tory booth, blood flowed from as many noses,\r\nand amid a terrific turmoil respectable men and justices of the peace\r\nleant across the barriers and shook their fists and flung frenzied\r\nchallenges broadcast.\r\n\r\nAll to no purpose. The Tories, though so much the weaker party, though\r\nbut one to eight, could not be silenced. After making three or four\r\nattempts to gain a hearing White-Hat Williams saw that he must reserve\r\nhis oration: and with a scowl he shouted his names into the ear of the\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\n“Who? Who did he say?” growled the Squire, panting with rage and hoarse\r\nwith shouting. His face was crimson, his cravat awry, he had lost his\r\nhat. “Who? Who?”\r\n\r\n“Wrench and—one moment, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Eh? Who do you say?”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t hear! One moment, sir! Oh, yes! Wrench and Vaughan!”\r\n\r\n“Vaughan?” old Rowley cried with a profane oath. “Impossible!”\r\n\r\nBut it was not impossible! Though so great was the surprise, so\r\nstriking the effect upon Sir Robert’s supporters that for a few seconds\r\nsomething like silence supervened. The serpent! The serpent! Here was a\r\nblow indeed—in the back!\r\n\r\nThen as Blackford, the Methodist, rose to second the nomination, the\r\nstorm broke out anew and more furiously than before. “What?” foamed the\r\nSquire, “be ruled by a rabble of grinning, yelling monkeys? By gad,\r\nI’ll leave the country first! I—I hope someone will shoot that young\r\nman! I wish I’d never shaken his hand! By G—d, I’m glad my father is in\r\nhis grave! He’d never ha’ believed this! Never! Never!”\r\n\r\nAnd from that time until the poll was declared open—in dumb show—not a\r\nword was audible.\r\n\r\nThen at last the shouting of the rival bands sank to a confused babel\r\nof jeers, abuse, and laughter. Exhausted men mopped their faces,\r\nvoiceless men loosened their neck-cloths, the farthest from the\r\nhustings went off to drink, and there was a lull until the sound of a\r\ndrum and fife announced a new event, and forth from the Heart and Hand\r\nadvanced a procession of five led by the accursed Dyas.\r\n\r\nThey were the Whig voters and they marched proudly to the front of the\r\npolling-booth, the mob falling back on either side to give them place.\r\n\r\nDyas flung his hat into the booth. “Wrench and Vaughan!” he cried in a\r\nvoice which could be heard in the White Lion. “And I care not who knows\r\nit!”\r\n\r\nThey put to him the bribery oath. “I can take it,” he answered.\r\n“Swallow it yourselves, if you can!”\r\n\r\n“You should know the taste, Jack,” cried a sly friend: and for a moment\r\nthe laugh was against him.\r\n\r\nOne by one—the process was slow in those days—they voted. “Five for\r\nWrench and Vaughan.” Wrench rose and bowed to each as he retired.\r\nArthur Vaughan took no notice.\r\n\r\nSir Robert’s voters looked at one another uneasily. They had the day\r\nbefore them, but—and then he saw the look, and, putting White and his\r\nremonstrances on one side, he joined them, bade them follow him, and\r\ndescended before them. He would ask no man to do what he would not do\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut the moment his action was understood, the moment the men were seen\r\nbehind him, there was a yell so fierce and a movement so threatening,\r\nthat on the lowest step of the hustings he stood bareheaded, raised his\r\nhand for silence and for a wonder was obeyed. In a clear, loud voice:\r\n\r\n“Do you expect to terrify me,” he cried, “either by threats or\r\nviolence? Let any man look in my face and see if it change colour? Let\r\nhim come and lay his hand on my heart and feel if it beats the quicker.\r\nKeep my voters from the poll and you stultify your own, for there will\r\nbe no election. Make way then, and let them pass to their duty!”\r\n\r\nAnd the crowd made way; and Arthur Vaughan felt a reluctant pang of\r\nadmiration. The five were polled; the result so far, five for each of\r\nthe candidates.\r\n\r\nThere remained to poll only Arthur Vaughan and Pillinger of the Blue\r\nDuck, if he could be brought up by the Tories. If neither of these\r\nvoted the Returning Officer would certainly give the casting vote for\r\nSir Robert’s candidates—if he dared.\r\n\r\nIsaac White believed that he would not dare, and for some time past the\r\nagent had been in covert talk with Pybus at the back of the hustings,\r\ntwo or three of the friends of each masking the conference. Now he drew\r\naside his employer who had returned in safety to his place; and he\r\nconferred with him. But for a time it was clear that Sir Robert would\r\nnot listen to what he had to say. He looked pale and angry, and\r\nreturned but curt answers. But White persisted, holding him by the\r\nsleeve.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Vaughan—bah, what a noise they make—does not wish to vote,” he\r\nexplained. “But in the end he will, sir, it is my opinion, and that\r\nwill give it to them unless we can bring up Pillinger—which I doubt,\r\nsir. Even if we do, it is a tie——”\r\n\r\n“Well? Well?” Sir Robert struck in, eyeing him sternly. “What more do\r\nwe want? The Returning Officer——”\r\n\r\n“He will not dare,” White whispered, “and if he does, sir, it is my\r\nbelief he will be murdered. More, if we win they will rush the booth\r\nand destroy the books. They have as good as told me they will stick at\r\nnothing. Believe me, sir,” he continued earnestly, “better than one and\r\none we can’t look for now. And better one than none!”\r\n\r\nBut it was long before Sir Robert would be persuaded. No, defeat or\r\nvictory, he would fight to the last! He would be beholden to the other\r\nside for nothing! White, however, was an honest man and less afraid of\r\nhis master than usual: and he held to it. And at length the reflection\r\nthat the bargain would at least shut out his kinsman prevailed with Sir\r\nRobert, and he consented.\r\n\r\nHe was too chivalrous to return on his own side the man whose success\r\nwould fill his pockets. He elected for Wathen and never doubted that\r\nthe Bowood interest would return their first love, Wrench. But when the\r\nlandlord of the Blue Duck was brought up by agreement to vote for a\r\ncandidate on either side, Pillinger voted by order for Wathen and\r\nVaughan.\r\n\r\n“There’s some d——d mistake!” shrieked the Squire, as the words reached\r\nhis ears.\r\n\r\nBut there was no mistake, and to the silent disgust of the Tories and\r\namid the frantic cheering of the Whigs, the return was made in favour\r\nof Sergeant John Wathen, and Arthur Vermuyden Vaughan, esquire. Loud\r\nand long was the cheering: the air was black with caps. But when the\r\ncrowd sought for the two to chair them according to immemorial custom,\r\nonly the Sergeant could be found, and he with great prudence declined\r\nthe honour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\nTHE FRUITS OF VICTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Vaughan could write himself Member of Parliament. The plaudits\r\nof the Academic and the mimic contests of the Debating Club were no\r\nlonger for him. Fortune had placed within his grasp the prize of which\r\nhe had often dreamt; and henceforth all lay open to him. But, as a\r\ncontemporary in a letter written on a like occasion says, he had gone\r\nthrough innumerable horrors to reach the goal. And the moment the\r\nresult was known and certain he slipped away from his place, and from\r\nthe oppressive good-wishes of his new and uncongenial friends—the\r\nWilliamses and the Blackfords; and shutting himself up in his rooms at\r\nthe White Lion, where his entrance was regarded askance, he set himself\r\nto look the future in the face.\r\n\r\nHe could not blame himself for the past, for he had done nothing of\r\nwhich he was ashamed. He had been put by circumstances in a false\r\nposition, but he had freed himself frankly and boldly; and every candid\r\nman must acknowledge that he could not have done otherwise than he had.\r\nYet he was aware that his conduct was open to misconstruction. Some,\r\neven on his own side, would say that he had gone to Chippinge prepared\r\nto support his kinsman; and that then, tempted by the opportunity of\r\ngaining the seat for himself, he had faced about. Few would believe the\r\ntruth—that twenty-four hours before the election he had declined to\r\nstand. Still fewer would believe that in withdrawing his “No,” he had\r\nbeen wholly moved by the offer which Sir Robert had made to him and the\r\nunworthy manner in which he had treated him.\r\n\r\nYet that was the truth; and so entirely the truth, that but for that\r\noffer he would have resigned the seat even now. For he had no mind to\r\nenter the House under a cloud. He knew that to do so was to endanger\r\nthe boat in which his fortunes were embarked. But in face of that offer\r\nhe could not withdraw. Sir Robert, Wetherell, White, all would believe\r\nthat he had resigned, not on the point of honour, but for a bribe, and\r\nbecause the bribe, refused at first, grew larger the longer he eyed it.\r\n\r\nSo, for good or evil, his mind was made up. And for a few minutes,\r\nwhile the roar of the mob applauding him rose to his windows, he was\r\nhappy. He was a member of the Commons’ House. He stood on that\r\nthreshold on which Harley and St. John, Walpole the wise, and the\r\ninspired Cornet, Pitt and Fox, spoiled children of fortune, Castlereagh\r\nthe illogical, and Canning\r\n\r\n_Born with an ancient name of little worth,\r\nAnd disinherited before his birth_,\r\n\r\n\r\nand many another had stood; knowing no more than he knew what fortune\r\nhad in womb for them, what of hushed silence would one day mark their\r\nrising, what homage of loyal hearts and thundering feet would hang upon\r\ntheir words. As their fortunes his might be; to sway to tears or\r\nlaughter, to a nation’s weal or woe, the men who ruled; to know his\r\nwords were fateful, and yet to speak with no uncertain voice; to give\r\nthe thing he did not deign to wear, and make the man whom he must\r\nfollow after, ay,\r\n\r\n_To fall as Walpole and to fail as Pitt!_\r\n\r\n\r\nthis, all this might be his, if he were worthy! If the dust of that\r\narena knew no better man!\r\n\r\nHis heart rose on the wave of thought and he felt himself fit for all,\r\nequipped for all. He owned no task too hard, no enterprise too high.\r\nNor did he fall from the clouds until he remembered the change in his\r\nfortunes, and bethought him that henceforth he must depend upon\r\nhimself. The story would be sifted, of course, and its truth or\r\nfalsehood be made clear. But whatever use Sir Robert might have deigned\r\nto make of it, Vaughan did not believe that he would have stooped to\r\ninvent it. And if it were true, then all the importance which had\r\nattached to himself as the heir to a great property, all the\r\nprivileges, all the sanctity of coming wealth, were gone.\r\n\r\nBut with them the responsibilities of that position were gone also. The\r\nchange might well depress his head and cloud his heart. He had lost\r\nmuch which he could hardly hope to win for himself. Yet—yet there were\r\ncompensations.\r\n\r\nHe had passed through much in the last twenty-four hours; and, perhaps\r\nfor that reason, he was peculiarly open to emotion. In the thought that\r\nhenceforth he might seek a companion where he pleased, in the\r\nremembrance that he had no longer any tastes to consult but his own,\r\nany prejudices to respect save those which he chose to adopt, he found\r\na comfort at which he clutched eagerly and thankfully. The world which\r\nshook him off—he would no longer be guided by its dictates! The race,\r\nstrenuous and to the swift, ay, to the draining of heart and brain, he\r\nwould not run it alone, uncheered, unsolaced—merely because while\r\nthings were different he had walked by a certain standard of conduct!\r\nIf he was now a poor man he was at least free! Free to take the one he\r\nloved into the boat in which his fortunes floated, nor ask too closely\r\nwho were her forbears. Free to pursue his ambition hand in hand with\r\none who would sweeten failure and share success, and who in that life\r\nof scant enjoyment and high emprise to which he must give himself,\r\nwould be a guardian angel, saving him from the spells of folly and\r\npleasure!\r\n\r\nHe might please himself now, and he would. Flixton might laugh, the men\r\nof the 14th might laugh. And in Bury Street he might have winced. But\r\nin Mecklenburgh Square, where he and she would set up their modest\r\ntent, he would not care.\r\n\r\nHe could not go to Bristol until the morrow, for he had to see Pybus,\r\nbut he would write and tell her of his fortunes and ask her to share\r\nthem. The step was no sooner conceived than attempted. He sat down and\r\ntook pen and paper, and with a glow at his heart, in a state of\r\ngenerous agitation, he prepared to write.\r\n\r\nBut he had never written to her, he had never called her by her name.\r\nAnd the difficulty of addressing her overwhelmed him. In the end, after\r\nsitting appalled by the bold and shameless look of “Dear Mary,”\r\n“Dearest Mary,” and of addresses warmer than these, he solved the\r\ndifficulty, after a tame and proper fashion by writing to Miss Sibson.\r\nAnd this is what he wrote:\r\n\r\n“Dear Madame,\r\n\r\n“At the interview which I had with you on Saturday last, you were good\r\nenough to intimate that if I were prepared to give an affirmative\r\nanswer to a question which you did not put into words, you would permit\r\nme to see Miss Smith. I am now in a position to give the assurance as\r\nto my intentions which you desired, and trust that I may see Miss Smith\r\non my arrival in Bristol to-morrow.\r\n\r\n“Believe me to remain, Madame,\r\n\r\n“Truly yours,\r\n\r\n“Arthur V. Vaughan.”\r\n\r\nAnd all his life, he told himself, he would remember the use to which\r\nhe had put his first frank!\r\n\r\nThat night the toasting and singing, drunkenness and revelry of which\r\nthe borough was the scene, kept him long waking. But eleven o’clock on\r\nthe following morning saw him alighting from a chaise at Bristol, and\r\nbefore noon he was in Queen’s Square.\r\n\r\nFor the time at least he had put the world behind him. And it was in\r\npure exultation and the joyous anticipation of what was to come that he\r\napproached the house. He came, a victor from the fight; nor, he\r\nreflected, was it every suitor who had it in his power to lay such\r\nofferings at the feet of his mistress. In the eye of the world, indeed,\r\nhe was no longer what he had been; for the matchmaking mother he had\r\nlost his value. But he had still so much to give which Mary had not, he\r\ncould still so alter the tenor of her life, he could still so lift her\r\nin the social scale, those hopes which she was to share still flew on\r\npinions so ambitious—ay, to the very scattering of garters and\r\nred-ribbons—that his heart was full of the joy of giving. He must not\r\nbe blamed if he felt as King Cophetua when he stooped to the\r\nbeggar-maiden, or as the Lord of Burleigh when he woo’d the farmer’s\r\ndaughter. After all, he did but rejoice that she had so little and he\r\nhad so much; that he could give and she could grace.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the house he paused a moment in wonder that when all\r\nthings were altered, his prospects, views, plans, its face rose\r\nunchanged. Then he knocked boldly; the time for hesitation was past. He\r\nasked for Miss Smith—thinking it likely that he would have to wait\r\nuntil the school rose at noon. The maid, however, received him as if\r\nshe expected him, and ushered him at once into a room on the left of\r\nthe entrance. He stood, holding his hat, waiting, listening; but not\r\nfor long. The door had scarcely closed on the girl before it opened\r\nagain, and Mary Smith came in. She met his eyes, and started, blushed a\r\ndivine rosy-red and stood wide-eyed and uncertain, with her hand on the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n“Did you not expect me?” he said, taken aback on his side. For this was\r\nnot the Mary Smith with whom he travelled on the coach; nor the Mary\r\nSmith with whom he had talked in the Square. This was a Mary Smith, no\r\nless beautiful, but gay and fresh as the morning, in dainty white with\r\na broad blue sash, with something new, something of a franker bearing\r\nin her air. “Did you not expect me?” he repeated gently, advancing a\r\nstep towards her.\r\n\r\n“No,” she murmured, and she stood blushing before him, blushing more\r\ndeeply with every second. For his eyes were beginning to talk, and to\r\ntell the old tale.\r\n\r\n“Did not Miss Sibson get my letter?” he asked gently.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” she murmured.\r\n\r\n“Then I have all—to do,” he said nervously. It was—it was certainly a\r\nharder thing to do than he had expected. “Will you not sit down,\r\nplease,” he pleaded. “I want you to listen to me.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment she looked as if she would flee instead. Then she let him\r\nlead her to a seat.\r\n\r\nHe sat down within reach of her. “And you did not know that it was I?”\r\nhe said, feeling the difficulty increase with every second.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“I hope,” he said, hesitating, “that you are glad that it is?”\r\n\r\n“I am glad to see you again—to thank you,” she murmured. But while her\r\nblushes and her downcast eyes seemed propitious to his suit, there was\r\nsomething—was it, could it be a covert smile hiding at the corners of\r\nher little mouth?—some change in her which oppressed him, and which he\r\ndid not understand. One thing he did understand, however: that she was\r\nmore beautiful, more desirable, more intoxicating than he had pictured\r\nher. And his apprehensions grew upon him, as he paused tongue-tied,\r\nworshipping her with his eyes. If, after all, she would not? What if\r\nshe said, “No”? For what, now he came to measure them beside her, were\r\nthose things he brought her, those things he came to offer, that career\r\nwhich he was going to ask her to share? What were they beside her\r\nadorable beauty and her modesty, the candour of her maiden eyes, the\r\nperfection of her form? He saw their worthlessness; and the bold phrase\r\nwith which he had meant to open his suit, the confident, “Mary, I am\r\ncome for you,” which he had repeated so often to the rhythm of the\r\nchaise-wheels, that he was sure he would never forget it, died on his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nAt last, “You speak of thanks—it is to gain your thanks I am come,” he\r\nsaid nervously. “But I don’t ask for words. I want you to think as—as\r\nhighly as you can of what I did for you—if you please! I want you to\r\nbelieve that I saved your life on the coach. I want you to think that I\r\ndid it at great risk to myself. I want you,” he continued hurriedly,\r\n“to exaggerate a hundredfold—everything I did for you. And then I want\r\nyou to think that you owe all to a miser, who will be content with\r\nnothing short of—of immense interest, of an extortionate return.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think that I understand,” she answered in a low tone, her\r\ncheeks glowing. But beyond that, he could not tell aught of her\r\nfeelings; she kept her eyes lowered so that he could not read them, and\r\nthere were, even in the midst of her shyness, an ease and an aloofness\r\nin her bearing, which were new to him and which frightened him. He\r\nremembered how quickly she had on other occasions put him in his place;\r\nhow coldly she had asserted herself. Perhaps, she had no feeling for\r\nhim. Perhaps, apart from the incident in the coach, she even disliked\r\nhim!\r\n\r\n“You do not understand,” he said unsteadily, “what is the return I\r\nwant?”\r\n\r\n“No-o,” she faltered.\r\n\r\nHe stood up abruptly, and took a pace or two from her. “And I hardly\r\ndare tell you,” he said. “I hardly dare tell you. I came to you, I came\r\nhere as brave as a lion. And now, I don’t know why, I am frightened.”\r\n\r\nShe—astonishing thing!—leapt the gulf for him. Possibly the greater\r\ndistance at which he stood gave her courage. “Are you afraid,” she\r\nmurmured, moving her fingers restlessly, and watching them, “that you\r\nmay change your mind again?”\r\n\r\n“Change my mind?” he ejaculated, not for the moment understanding her.\r\nSo much had happened since his collision with Flixton in the Square.\r\n\r\n“As that gentleman—said you were in the habit of doing.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!”\r\n\r\n“It was not true?”\r\n\r\n“True?” he exclaimed hotly. “True that I—that I——”\r\n\r\n“Changed your mind?” she said with her face averted. “And not—not only\r\nthat, sir?”\r\n\r\n“What else?” he asked bitterly.\r\n\r\n“Talked of me—among your friends?”\r\n\r\n“A lie! A miserable lie!” he cried on impulse, finding his tongue\r\nagain. “But I will tell you all. He saw you—that first morning, you\r\nremember, and never having seen anyone so lovely, he intended to make\r\nyou the object of—of attentions that were unworthy of you. And to\r\nprotect you I told him that I was going—to make you my wife.”\r\n\r\n“Is that what you mean to-day?” she asked faintly.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But you did not mean it then?” she answered—though very gently. “It\r\nwas to shield me you said it?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, astonished at her insight and her boldness. How\r\ndifferent, how very different was this from that to which he had looked\r\nforward! At last, “I think I meant it,” he said gloomily. “God knows I\r\nmean it now! But that evening,” he continued, seeing that she still\r\nwaited with averted face for the rest of his explanation, “he\r\nchallenged me at dinner before them all, and I,” he added jerkily, “I\r\nwas not quite sure what I meant—I had no mind that you should be made\r\nthe talk of the—of my friends——”\r\n\r\n“And so—you denied it?” she said gently.\r\n\r\nHe hung his head. “Yes,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I think I—I understand,” she answered unsteadily. “What I do not\r\nunderstand is why you are here to-day. Why you have changed your mind\r\nagain. Why you are now willing that I should be—the talk of your\r\nfriends, sir.”\r\n\r\nHe stood, the picture of abasement. Must he acknowledge his doubts and\r\nhis hesitation, allow that he had been ashamed of her, admit that he\r\nhad deemed the marriage he now sought, a mésalliance? Must he open to\r\nher eyes those hours of cowardly vacillation during which he had walked\r\nthe Clifton Woods weighing _I would_ against _I dare not?_ And do it in\r\nface of that new dignity, that new aloofness which he recognised in her\r\nand which made him doubt if he had an ally in her heart.\r\n\r\nMore, if he told her, would she understand? How should she, bred so\r\ndifferently, understand how heavily the old name with its burden of\r\nresponsibilities, how heavily the past with its obligations to duty and\r\nsacrifice, had weighed upon him! And if he told her and she did not\r\nunderstand, what mercy had he to expect from her?\r\n\r\nStill, for a moment he was on the point of telling her: and of telling\r\nher also why he was now free to please himself, why, rid of the burden\r\nwith the inheritance, he could follow his heart. But the tale was long\r\nand roundabout, she knew nothing of the Vermuydens, of their\r\nimportance, or his expectations, or what he had lost or what he had\r\ngained. And it seemed simpler to throw himself on her mercy. “Because I\r\nlove you!” he said humbly. “I have nothing else to say.”\r\n\r\n“And you are sure that you will not change your mind again?”\r\n\r\nThere was that in her voice, though he could not see her face, which\r\nbrought him across two squares of the carpet as if she had jerked him\r\nwith a string. In a second he was on his knees beside her, and had laid\r\na feverish hand on hers. “Mary,” he cried, “Mary!” seeking to look up\r\ninto her face, “you will! You will! You will let me take you? You will\r\nlet me take you from here! I cannot offer you what I once thought I\r\ncould, but I have enough, and, you will?” There was a desperate\r\nsupplication in his voice; for close to her, so close that his breath\r\nwas on her cheek, she seemed, with her half-averted face and her\r\nslender figure, so dainty a thing, so delicate and rare, that he could\r\nhardly believe that she could ever be his, that he could be so lucky as\r\nto possess her, that he could ever take her in his arms. “You will? You\r\nwill?” he repeated, empty of all other words.\r\n\r\nShe did not speak, she could not speak. But she bowed her head.\r\n\r\n“You will?”\r\n\r\nShe turned her eyes on him then; eyes so tender and passionate that\r\nthey seemed to draw his heart, his being, his strength out of him.\r\n“Yes,” she whispered shyly. “If I am allowed.”\r\n\r\n“Allowed? Allowed?” he cried. How in a moment was all changed for him!\r\n“I would like to see——” And then breaking off—perhaps it was her fault\r\nfor leaning a little towards him—he did that which he had thought a\r\nmoment before that he would never dare to do. He put his arm round her\r\nand drew her gently and reverently to him until—for she did not\r\nresist—her head lay on his shoulder. “Mine!” he murmured, “Mine! Mine!\r\nMary, I can hardly believe it. I can hardly think I am so blest.”\r\n\r\n“And you will not change?” she whispered.\r\n\r\n“Never! Never!”\r\n\r\nThey were silent. Was she thinking of the dark night, when she had\r\nwalked lonely and despondent to her new and unknown home? Or of many\r\nanother hour of solitary depression, spent in dull and dreary\r\nschoolrooms, while others made holiday? Was he thinking of his doubts\r\nand fears, his cowardly hesitation? Or only of his present monstrous\r\nhappiness? No matter. At any rate, they had forgotten the existence of\r\nanything outside the room, they had forgotten the world and Miss\r\nSibson, they were in a Paradise of their own, such as is given to no\r\nman and to no woman more than once, they were a million miles from\r\nBristol City, when the sound made by the opening door surprised them in\r\nthat posture. Vaughan turned fiercely to see who it was, to see who\r\ndared to trespass on their Eden. He looked, only looked, and he sprang\r\nto his feet, amazed. He thought for a moment that he was dreaming, or\r\nthat he was mad.\r\n\r\nFor on the threshold, gazing at them with a face of indescribable\r\nastonishment, rage and incredulity, was Sir Robert Vermuyden. Sir\r\nRobert Vermuyden, the one last man in the world whom Arthur Vaughan\r\nwould have expected to see there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\nA PLOT UNMASKED\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a few moments the old man and the young man gazed at one another,\r\nalike in this only that neither found words equal to his feelings.\r\nWhile Mary, covered with confusion, blushing for the situation in which\r\nshe had been found, could not hold up her head. It was Sir Robert who\r\nat last broke the silence in a voice which trembled with passion.\r\n\r\n“You viper!” he said. “You viper! You would sting me—here also.”\r\n\r\nVaughan stared at him, aghast. The intrusion was outrageous, but\r\nastonishment rather than anger was the young man’s first feeling. “Here\r\nalso?” he repeated, as if he thought that he must have heard amiss.\r\n“_I_ sting you? What do you mean? Why have you followed me?” And then\r\nmore warmly, “How dare you, sir, spy on me?” And he threw back his head\r\nin wrath.\r\n\r\nThe old man, every nerve and vein in his lean, high forehead swollen\r\nand leaping, raised his cane and shook it at him. “Dare? Dare?” he\r\ncried, and then for very rage his voice failed him.\r\n\r\nVaughan closed his eyes and opened them again. “I am dreaming,” he\r\nsaid. “I must be dreaming. Are you Sir Robert Vermuyden? Is this house\r\nMiss Sibson’s school? Are we in Bristol? Or is it all—but first, sir,”\r\nrecalling abruptly and with indignation the situation in which he had\r\nbeen surprised, and raising his tone, “how come you here? I have a\r\nright to know that!”\r\n\r\n“How come I here?”\r\n\r\n“Yes! How come you here, sir?”\r\n\r\n“You ask me! You ask me!” Sir Robert repeated, as if he could not\r\nbelieve his ears. “How I come here! You scoundrel! You scoundrel!”\r\n\r\nVaughan started under the lash of the word. The insult was gratuitous,\r\nintolerable! No relationship, no family tie could excuse it. No wonder\r\nthat the astonishment and irritation which had been his first feelings,\r\ngave way to pure anger. Sir Robert might be this or that. He might\r\nhave, or rather, he might have had certain rights. But now all that was\r\nover, the relationship was a thing of the past. And to suppose that he\r\nwas still to suffer the old gentleman’s interference, to put up with\r\nhis insults, to permit him in the presence of a young girl, his\r\npromised wife, to use such language as he was using, was out of the\r\nquestion. Vaughan’s face grew dark.\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert,” he said, “you are too old to be called to account. You\r\nmay say, therefore, what you please. But not—not if you are a\r\ngentleman—until this young lady has left the room.”\r\n\r\n“This—young—lady!” Sir Robert gasped in an indescribable tone: and with\r\nthe cane quivering in his grasp he looked from Vaughan to the girl.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Vaughan answered sternly. “That young lady! And do not let me\r\nhear you call her anything else, sir, for she has promised to be my\r\nwife.”\r\n\r\n“You lie!” the baronet cried, the words leaping from his lips.\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert!”\r\n\r\n“My daughter—promised to be your wife! My—my——”\r\n\r\n“Your daughter!”\r\n\r\n“Hypocrite!” Sir Robert retorted, flinging the word at him. “You knew\r\nit! You knew it!”\r\n\r\n“Your daughter?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, that she was my daughter!”\r\n\r\n“Your daughter!”\r\n\r\nThis time the words fell from Arthur Vaughan in a whisper. And he\r\nstood, turned to stone. His daughter? Sir Robert’s daughter? The\r\ngirl—he tried desperately to clear his mind—of whom Wetherell had told\r\nthe story, the girl whom her mother had hidden away, while in Italy,\r\nthe girl whose reappearance in life had ousted him or was to oust him\r\nfrom his inheritance? Mary Smith—was that girl! His daughter!\r\n\r\nBut no! The blood leapt back to his heart. It was impossible, it was\r\nincredible! The coincidence was too great, too amazing. His reason\r\nrevolted against it. And “Impossible!” he cried in a louder, a bolder\r\ntone—though fear underlay its confidence. “You are playing with me! You\r\nmust be jesting!” he repeated angrily.\r\n\r\nBut the elder man, though his hand still trembled on his cane and his\r\nface was sallow with rage, had regained some control of himself.\r\nInstead of retorting on Vaughan—except by a single glance of withering\r\ncontempt—he turned to Mary. “You had better go to your room,” he said,\r\ncoldly but not ungently. For how could he blame her, bred amid such\r\nsurroundings, for conduct that in other circumstances had irritated him\r\nindeed? For conduct that had been unseemly, unmaidenly, improper. “You\r\nhad better go to your room,” he repeated. “This is no fit place for you\r\nand no fit discussion for your ears. I am not—the fault is not with\r\nyou, but it will be better if you leave us.”\r\n\r\nShe was rising, too completely overwhelmed to dream of refusing, when\r\nVaughan interposed. “No,” he said with a gleam of defiance in his eyes.\r\n“By your leave, sir, no! This young lady is my affianced wife. If it be\r\nher own wish to retire, be it so. But if not, there is no one who has\r\nthe right to bid her go or stay. You”—checking Sir Robert’s wrathful\r\nrejoinder by a gesture—“you may be her father, but before you can\r\nexercise a father’s rights you must make good your case.”\r\n\r\n“Make good my case!” Sir Robert ejaculated.\r\n\r\n“And when you have made it good, it will still be for her to choose\r\nbetween us,” Vaughan continued with determination. “You, who have never\r\nplayed a father’s part, who have never guided or guarded, fostered or\r\ncherished her—do not think, sir, that you can in a moment arrogate to\r\nyourself a father’s authority.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert gasped. But the next moment he took up the glove so boldly\r\nflung down. He pointed to the door, and with less courtesy than the\r\noccasion demanded—but he was sore pressed by his anger, “Leave the\r\nroom, girl,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Do as you please, Mary,” Vaughan said.\r\n\r\n“Go!” cried the baronet, stung by the use of her name. “Stay!” said\r\nVaughan.\r\n\r\nInfinitely distressed, infinitely distracted by this appeal from the\r\none, from the other, from this side, from that, she turned her swimming\r\neyes on her lover. “Oh, what,” she cried, “what am I to do?”\r\n\r\nHe did not speak, but he looked at her, not doubting what she would do,\r\nnor conceiving it possible that she could prefer to him, her lover,\r\nwhose sweet professions were still honey in her ears, whose arm was\r\nstill warm from the pressure of her form—that she could prefer to him,\r\na father who was no more than the shadow of a name.\r\n\r\nBut he did not know Mary yet, either in her strength or her weakness.\r\nNor did he consider that her father was already more than a name to\r\nher. She hung a moment undecided and wretched, drooping as the white\r\nrose that hangs its head in the first shower. Then she turned to the\r\nelder man, and throwing her arms about his neck hung in tears on his\r\nbreast. “You will be good to him, sir,” she whispered passionately.\r\n“Oh, forgive him! Forgive him, sir!”\r\n\r\n“My dear——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, forgive him, sir!”\r\n\r\nSir Robert smoothed her hair with a caressing hand, and with pinched\r\nlips and bright eyes looked at his adversary over her head. “I would\r\nforgive him,” he said, “I could forgive him—all but this! All but this,\r\nmy dear! I could forgive him had he not tricked you and deceived you,\r\ncozened you and flattered you—into this! Into the belief that he loves\r\nyou, while he loves only your inheritance! Or that part,” he added\r\nbitterly, “of which he has not already robbed you!”\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert,” Vaughan said, “you have stooped very low. But it will not\r\navail you.”\r\n\r\n“It has availed me so far,” the baronet retorted. With confidence he\r\nwas regaining also command of himself.\r\n\r\nVaughan winced. In proportion as the other recovered his temper, he\r\nlost his.\r\n\r\n“It will avail me still farther,” Sir Robert continued exultantly,\r\n“when my daughter understands, as she shall understand, sir, that when\r\nyou came here to-day, when you stole a march on me, as you thought, and\r\nproposed marriage to her behind my back, you knew all that I knew!\r\nKnew, sir, that she was my daughter, knew that she was my heiress, knew\r\nthat she ousted you, knew that by a marriage with her, and by that\r\nonly, you could regain all that you had lost!”\r\n\r\n“It is a lie!” Vaughan cried, stung beyond endurance. He was pale with\r\nanger.\r\n\r\n“Then refute it!” Sir Robert said, clasping the girl, who had\r\ninvoluntarily winced at the word, more closely to him. “Refute it, sir!\r\nRefute it!”\r\n\r\n“It is absurd! It—it needs no refutation!” Vaughan cried.\r\n\r\n“Why?” Sir Robert retorted. “I state it. I am prepared to prove it! I\r\nhave three witnesses to the fact!”\r\n\r\n“To the fact that I——”\r\n\r\n“That you knew,” Sir Robert replied. “Knew this lady to be my daughter\r\nwhen you came here this morning—as well as I knew it myself.”\r\n\r\nVaughan returned his look in speechless indignation. Did the man really\r\nbelieve in a charge, which at first had seemed to be mere vulgar abuse.\r\nIt was not possible! “Sir Robert,” he said, speaking slowly and with\r\ndignity, “I never did you harm by word or deed until a day or two ago.\r\nAnd then, God knows, perforce and reluctantly. How then can you lower\r\nyourself to—to such a charge as this?”\r\n\r\n“Do you deny then,” the baronet replied with contemptuous force, “do\r\nyou dare to deny—to my face, that you knew?”\r\n\r\nVaughan stared. “You will say presently,” he replied, “that I knew her\r\nto be your daughter when I made her acquaintance on the coach a week\r\nago. At a time when you knew nothing yourself.”\r\n\r\n“As to that I cannot say one way or the other,” Sir Robert rejoined. “I\r\ndo not know how nor where you made her acquaintance. But I do know that\r\nan acquaintance so convenient, so coincident, could hardly be the work\r\nof chance!”\r\n\r\n“Good G—d! Then you will say also that I knew who she was when I called\r\non her the day after, and again two days after that—while you were\r\nstill in ignorance?”\r\n\r\n“I have said,” the baronet answered with cold decision, “that I do not\r\nknow how you made, nor why you followed up your acquaintance with her.\r\nBut I have, I cannot but have my suspicions.”\r\n\r\n“Suspicions? Suspicions?” Vaughan cried bitterly. “And on suspicion,\r\nthe base issue of prejudice and dislike——”\r\n\r\n“No, sir, no!” Sir Robert struck in. “Though it may be that if I knew\r\nwho introduced you to her, who opened this house to you, and the rest,\r\nI might find ground for more than suspicion! The schoolmistress might\r\ntell me somewhat, and—you wince, sir! Ay,” he continued in a tone of\r\ntriumph. “I see there is something to be learned! But it is not upon\r\nsuspicion that I charge you to-day! It is upon the best of grounds. Did\r\nyou not before my eyes and in the presence of two other witnesses,\r\nread, no farther back than the day before yesterday, in the\r\ndrawing-room of my house, the whole story of my daughter’s movements up\r\nto her departure from London for Bristol! With the name of the school\r\nto which she was consigned? Did you not, sir? Did you not?”\r\n\r\n“Never! Never!”\r\n\r\n“What?” The astonishment in Sir Robert’s voice was so real, so\r\nunfeigned, that it must have carried conviction to any listener.\r\n\r\nVaughan passed his hand across his brow; and Mary, who had hitherto\r\nkept her face hidden, shivering under the stroke of each harsh word—for\r\nto a tender heart what could be more distressing than this strife\r\nbetween the two beings she most cherished?—raised her head\r\nimperceptibly. What would he answer? Only she knew how her heart beat;\r\nhow sick she was with fear; how she shrank from that which the next\r\nminute might unfold!\r\n\r\nAnd yet she listened.\r\n\r\n“I—I remember now,” Vaughan said—and the consternation he felt made\r\nitself heard in his voice. “I remember that I looked at a paper——”\r\n\r\n“At a paper!” Sir Robert cried in a tone of withering contempt. “At a\r\ndetailed account, sir, of my daughter’s movements down to her arrival\r\nat Bristol! Do you deny that?” he continued grimly. “Do you deny that\r\nyou perused that account?”\r\n\r\nVaughan stood for a moment with his hand pressed to his brow. He\r\nhesitated. “I remember taking a paper in my hands,” he said slowly, his\r\nface flushing, as the probable inference from his words occurred to\r\nhim. “But I was thinking so much of the disclosure you had made to me,\r\nand of the change it involved—-to me, that——”\r\n\r\n“That you took no interest in the written details!” Sir Robert cried in\r\na tone of bitter irony.\r\n\r\n“I did not.”\r\n\r\n“You did not read a word, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“I did not.”\r\n\r\nBefore the baronet could utter the sneer which was on his lips, Mary\r\ninterposed. “I—I would like to go,” she murmured. “I feel rather\r\nfaint!”\r\n\r\nShe detached herself from her father’s arm as she spoke, and with her\r\nface averted from her lover, she moved uncertainly towards the door.\r\nShe had no wish to look on him. She shrank from meeting his shamed\r\neyes. But something, either the feeling that she would never see him\r\nagain, and that this was the end of her maiden love, or the desperate\r\nhope that even at this last moment he might explain his admission—and\r\nthose facts, “confirmation strong as hell” which she knew, but which\r\nSir Robert did not know—one or other of these feelings made her falter\r\non the threshold, made her turn. Their eyes met.\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward impulsively. He was white with pain, his face rigid.\r\nFor what pain is stronger than the pang of innocence accused?\r\n\r\n“One moment!” he said, in an unsteady voice. “If we part so, Mary, we\r\npart indeed! We part forever! I said awhile ago that you must choose\r\nbetween us. And you have chosen—it seems,” he continued unsteadily.\r\n“Yet think! Give yourself, give me a chance. Will you not believe my\r\nword?” And he held out his arms to her. “Will you not believe that when\r\nI came to you this morning I thought you penniless? I thought you the\r\nunknown schoolmistress you thought yourself a week ago! Will you not\r\ntrust me when I say that I never connected you with the missing\r\ndaughter? Never dreamed of a connection? Why should I?” he added, in\r\ngrowing agitation as the words of his appeal wrought on himself. “Why\r\nshould I? Or why do you in a moment think me guilty of the meanest, the\r\nmost despicable, the most mercenary of acts?”\r\n\r\nHe was going to take her hand, but Sir Robert stepped between them,\r\ngrim as fate and as vindictive. “No!” he said. “No! No more! You have\r\ngiven her pain enough, sir! Take your dismissal and go! She has\r\nchosen—you have said it yourself!”\r\n\r\nHe cast one look at Sir Robert, and then, “Mary,” he asked, “am I to\r\ngo?”\r\n\r\nShe was leaning, almost beside herself, against the door. And oh, how\r\nmuch of joy and sorrow she had known since she crossed the threshold. A\r\nman’s embrace, and a man’s treachery. The sweetness of love and the\r\nbitterness of—reality!\r\n\r\n“Mary!” Vaughan repeated.\r\n\r\nBut the baronet could not endure this. “By G—d, no!” he cried,\r\ninfuriated by the other’s persistence, and perhaps a little by fear\r\nthat the girl would give way. “You shall not soil her name with your\r\nlips, sir! You shall torture her no longer! You have your dismissal!\r\nTake it and go!”\r\n\r\n“When she tells me with her own lips to go,” Vaughan answered doggedly,\r\n“I will go. Not before!” For never had she seemed more desirable to\r\nhim. Never, though contempt of her weakness wrestled with his love, had\r\nhe wanted her more. Except that seat in the House which had cost him so\r\ndearly, she was all he had left. And it did not seem possible that she\r\nwhom he had held so lately in his arms, she who had confessed her love\r\nfor him, with whom he had vowed to share his life and his success, his\r\nlot good or bad—it did not seem possible that she could really believe\r\nthis miserable, this incredible, this impossible thing of him! She\r\ncould not! Or, if she could, he was indeed mistaken in her. “I shall\r\ngo,” he repeated coldly, “and I shall not return.”\r\n\r\nAnd Mary had not believed it of him, had she known him longer or\r\nbetter; had she known him as girls commonly know their lovers. But his\r\nwooing had been short, we know: and we know, too, the distrust of men\r\nin which she had been trained. He had taken her by storm, stooping to\r\nher from the height of his position, having on his side her poverty and\r\nloneliness, her inexperience and youth. Now all these things, and her\r\nignorance of his world weighed against him. Was it to be supposed,\r\ncould it be credited that he, who had come to her bearing her mother’s\r\ncommendation, knew nothing, though he was her kinsman? That he, who\r\nafter plain hesitation and avowed doubt, laid all at her feet as soon\r\nas her father was prepared to acknowledge her—still sought her in\r\nignorance? That he, who had read her story in black and white, still\r\nknew nothing?\r\n\r\nNo, she could not believe it. But it was a bitter thing to know that he\r\ndid not love her, that he had not loved her! That he had come to her\r\nfor gain! She must speak if it were only to escape, only to save\r\nherself from—from collapse. She yearned for nothing now so much as to\r\nbe alone in her room.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye,” she muttered, with averted eyes and pallid lips. “I—I\r\nforgive you. Good-bye.”\r\n\r\nAnd she opened the door with groping fingers; and still, still looking\r\naway from him lest she should break down, she went out.\r\n\r\nHe drew a deep breath as she passed the threshold; and his eyes did not\r\nleave her. But he did not speak. Nor did Sir Robert Vermuyden until his\r\ndaughter’s step, light as thistledown that morning, and now uncertain\r\nand lagging, passed out of hearing, and—and at last a door closed on\r\nthe floor above.\r\n\r\nThen the elder man looked at the other. “Are you not going?” he said\r\nwith stern meaning. “You have robbed me of my borough, sir—I give you\r\njoy of your cleverness. But you shall not rob me of my daughter!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder which you love the better!” Vaughan snarled. And with the\r\nvicious gibe he took his hat and went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI\r\nA MEETING OF OLD FRIENDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was September. The House elected in those first days of May was four\r\nmonths old, and already it had fulfilled the hopes of the country.\r\nWithout a division it had decreed the first reading, and by a majority\r\nof one hundred and thirty-six, the second reading of the People’s Bill;\r\nthat Bill by which the preceding House slaying, had been slain. New\r\nmembers were beginning to lose the first gloss of their enthusiasm; the\r\nyoungest no longer ogled the M.P. on their letters, nor franked for the\r\nmere joy of franking. But the ministry still rode the flood tide of\r\nfavour, Lord Grey was still his country’s pride, and Brougham a hero.\r\nIt only remained to frighten the House of Lords, and in particular\r\nthose plaguy out-of-date fellows, the Bishops, into passing the Bill;\r\nand the battle would be won,\r\n\r\n_The streets be paved with mutton pies_,\r\n\r\n_Potatoes eat like pine!_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, in fine, everyone would live happily ever afterwards.\r\n\r\nTo old Tories of the stamp of Sir Robert Vermuyden, the outlook was\r\nwholly dark. But it is not often that public care clouds private joy;\r\nand had Eldon been prime minister, with Wetherell for his Chancellor,\r\nthe grounds of Stapylton could hardly have worn a more smiling aspect\r\nthan they presented on the fine day in early September, which Sir\r\nRobert had chosen for his daughter’s first party. The abrupt addition\r\nof a well-grown girl to a family of one is a delicate process. It is\r\napt to open the door to scandal. And a little out of discretion, and\r\nmore that she, who was now the apple of his eye, might not wear her\r\nwealth with a difference, nor lack anything of the mode, he had not\r\nhastened the occasion. A word had been dropped here and there—with\r\ncare; the truth had been told to some, the prepossessions of others had\r\nbeen consulted. But at length the day was come on which she must stand\r\nby his side and receive the world of Wiltshire.\r\n\r\nAnd she had so stood for more than an hour of this autumn afternoon;\r\nwith such pride on his side as was fitting, and such blushes on hers as\r\nwere fitting also. Now, the prime duty of reception over, and his\r\ncompany dispersed through the gardens, Sir Robert lingered with one or\r\ntwo of his intimates on the lawn before the house. In the hollow of the\r\npark hard by, stood the ample marquee in which his poorer neighbours\r\nwere presently to feed; gossip had it that Sir Robert was already at\r\nwork rebuilding his political influence. Near the tent, Hunt the\r\nSlipper and Kiss in the Ring were in progress, and Moneymusk was being\r\ndanced to the strains of the Chippinge church band; the shrill voices\r\nof the rustic youth proving that their first shyness was wearing off.\r\nWithin the gardens, a famous band from Bath played the new-fashioned\r\nquadrilles turn about with Moore’s Irish Melodies; and a score of the\r\nfair, gorgeous as the dragon-flies which darted above the water,\r\nmeandered delicately up and down the sward; or escorted by gentlemen in\r\ntightly strapped white trousers and blue coats—or in Wellington frocks,\r\nthe latest mode—appeared and again disappeared among the elms beside\r\nthe Garden Pool. In the background, the house, adorned and refurnished,\r\nwinked with all its windows at the sunshine, gave forth from all its\r\ndoors the sweet scent of flowers, throbbed to the very recesses of the\r\nhaunted wing with small talk and light laughter, the tap of sandalled\r\nfeet and the flirt of fans.\r\n\r\nSir Robert thanked his God as he looked upon it all. And five years\r\nyounger in face and more like the Duke than ever, he listened, almost\r\npurring, to the praises of his new-found darling. The odds had been\r\ngreat that with such a breeding, she had been coarse or sly, common or\r\nskittish. And she was none of these things, but fair as a flower,\r\nslender as Psyche, sweet-eyed as a loving woman, dainty and virginal as\r\nthe buds of May! And withal gentle and kind and obedient—above all,\r\nobedient. He could not thank God enough, as he read in the eyes of\r\nyoung men and old women, what they thought of her. And he was thanking\r\nHim, though in outward seeming he was attentive to an old friend’s\r\nprattle, when his eyes fell on a carriage and four which, followed by\r\ntwo outriders, was sweeping past the marquee and breasting the gentle\r\nascent to the house. All who were likely to arrive in such state, the\r\nBeauforts, Suffolks, Methuens, were come; the old Duke of Beaufort,\r\nindeed, and his daughter-in-law were gone again. So Sir Robert stared\r\nat the approaching carriage, wondering whom it might contain.\r\n\r\n“They are the Bowood liveries,” said his friend, who had longer sight.\r\n“I thought they had gone to town for the Coronation.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert too had thought so. Indeed, though he had invited the\r\nLansdownes upon the principle, which even the heats attending the\r\nReform Bill did not wholly abrogate, that family friendships were above\r\nparty—he had been glad to think that he would not see the spoliators.\r\nThe trespass was too recent, the robbery too gross! Ay, and the times\r\ntoo serious.\r\n\r\nHere they were, however; Lady Lansdowne, her daughter, and a small\r\ngentleman with a merry eye and curling locks. And Sir Robert repressed\r\na sigh, and advanced four or five paces to meet them. But though he\r\nsighed, no one knew better what became a host; and his greeting was\r\nperfect. One of his bitterest flings at Bowood painted it as the common\r\nhaunt of fiddlers and poets, actors and the like. But he received her\r\nladyship’s escort, who was no other than Mr. Moore of Sloperton, and of\r\nthe Irish Melodies, with the courtesy which he would have extended to\r\nan equal; nor when Lady Lansdowne sent her girl to take tea under the\r\npoet’s care did he let any sign of his reprobation appear. Those with\r\nwhom he had been talking had withdrawn to leave him at liberty, and he\r\nfound himself alone with Lady Lansdowne.\r\n\r\n“We leave for Berkeley Square to-morrow, for the Coronation on the\r\n8th,” she said, playing with her fan in a way which would have betrayed\r\nto her intimates that she was not at ease. “I had many things to do\r\nthis morning in view of our departure and I could not start early. You\r\nmust accept our apologies, Sir Robert.”\r\n\r\n“It was gracious of your ladyship to come at all,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It was brave,” she replied, with a gleam of laughter in her eyes. “In\r\nfact, though I bear my lord’s warmest felicitations on this happy\r\nevent, and wreathe them with mine, Sir Robert——”\r\n\r\n“I thank your ladyship and Lord Lansdowne,” he said formally.\r\n\r\n“I do not think that I should have ventured,” she continued with\r\nanother glint of laughter, “did I not bear also an olive branch.”\r\n\r\nHe bowed, but waited in silence for her explanation.\r\n\r\n“One of a—a rather delicate nature,” she said. “Am I permitted, Sir\r\nRobert, to—to speak in confidence?”\r\n\r\nHe did not understand and he sought refuge in compliments. “Permitted?”\r\nhe said, with the gallant bow of an old beau. “All things are permitted\r\nto so much——”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” she said. “But there! I will take you at your word. You know\r\nthat the Bill—there is but one Bill now-a-days—is in Committee?”\r\n\r\nHe frowned, disliking the subject. “I don’t think,” he said, “that any\r\ngood can come of discussing it, Lady Lansdowne.”\r\n\r\n“I think it may,” she replied, with a confidence which she did not\r\nfeel, “if you will hear me. It is whispered that there is a question in\r\nCommittee of one of the doomed boroughs. One, I am told, Sir Robert,\r\nhangs between schedule A and schedule B; and that borough is Chippinge.\r\nThose who know whisper Lord Lansdowne that ultimately it will be\r\nplucked from the burning, and will be found in schedule B. Consequently\r\nit will retain one member.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert’s thin face turned a dull red. So the wicked Whigs, who had\r\ndrawn the line of disfranchisement at such a point as to spare their\r\npet preserves, their Calne and Bedford and the like, had not been able\r\nwith all their craft to net every fish. One had evaded the mesh, and by\r\nHeavens, it was Chippinge! Chippinge, though shorn of its full glory,\r\nwould still return one member. He had not hoped, he had not expected\r\nthis. Now\r\n\r\n_Non omnis moriar, multaque pars mei\r\nVitabit Libitinam!_\r\n\r\n\r\nhe thought with jubilation. And then another thought darted through his\r\nmind and changed his joy to chagrin. A seat had been left to Chippinge.\r\nBut why? That Arthur Vaughan, that his renegade cousin, might continue\r\nto fill it, might continue to hold it, under his nose and to his daily,\r\nhourly, his constant mortification. By Heaven, it was too much! They\r\nhad said well, who said that an enemy’s gift was to be dreaded. But he\r\nwould fight the seat, at the next election and at every election,\r\nrather than suffer that miserable person, miserable on so many\r\naccounts, to fill it at his will. And after all the seat was saved; and\r\nno one could tell the future. The lasting gain might outlive the\r\ntemporary vexation.\r\n\r\nSo, after frowning a moment, he tried to smooth his brow. “And your\r\nmission, Lady Lansdowne,” he said politely, “is to tell me this?”\r\n\r\n“In part,” she said, with hesitation, for the course, of his feelings\r\nhad been visible in his countenance. “But also——”\r\n\r\n“But also—and in the main,” he answered with a smile, “to make a\r\nproposition, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe thought of the most obvious proposition, and he spoke in pursuance\r\nof his thought. “Then forgive me if I speak plainly,” he said. “Whether\r\nthe borough lose one member or both, whether it figure in schedule B,\r\nor in schedule A, cannot affect my opposition to the Bill! If you have\r\nit in commission, therefore, to make any proposal, based on a contrary\r\nnotion, I cannot listen even to your ladyship.”\r\n\r\n“I have not,” she answered with a smile. “Sir Robert Vermuyden’s\r\nmalignancy is too well known. Yet I am the bearer of a proposition.\r\nSuppose the Bill to become law, and I am told that it will surely\r\nbecome law, can we not avoid future conflict, and—I will not say future\r\nill-will, for God knows there is none on our side, Sir Robert—but\r\nfuture friction, by an agreement? Of course it will not be possible to\r\nnominate members in the future as in the past. But for some time to\r\ncome whoever is returned for Chippinge must be returned by your\r\ninfluence, or by my lord’s.”\r\n\r\nHe coughed drily. “Possibly,” he said.\r\n\r\n“In view of that,” she continued, flirting her fan, as she watched his\r\nface—his manner was not encouraging, “and for the sake of peace between\r\nfamilies, and a little, perhaps, because I do not wish Kerry to be\r\nbeggared by contested elections, can we not now, while the future is on\r\nthe lap of the gods——”\r\n\r\n“In Committee,” Sir Robert corrected with a grave bow.\r\n\r\nShe laughed pleasantly. “Well,” she allowed, “perhaps it is not quite\r\nthe same thing. But no matter! Whoever the Fates in charge, can we\r\nnot,” with her head on one side and a charming smile, “make a treaty of\r\npeace?”\r\n\r\n“And what,” Sir Robert asked with urbane sarcasm, “becomes of the\r\nrights of the people in that case, Lady Lansdowne? And of the purity of\r\nelections? And of the new and independent electors whom my lord has\r\nbrought into being? Must we not think of these things?”\r\n\r\nShe looked for an instant rather foolish. Then she rallied, and with a\r\nslightly heightened colour, “In good time, we must,” she replied. “But\r\nfor the present it is plain that they will not be able to walk without\r\nassistance.”\r\n\r\n“What?” it was on the tip of his tongue to answer. “The new and\r\nindependent electors? Not walk without assistance? Oh, what a change is\r\nhere!” But he forbore. He said instead—but with the faintest shade of\r\nirony, “Without _our_ assistance, I think you mean, Lady Lansdowne?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. And that being so, why should we not agree, my lord and you—to\r\nsave Kerry’s pocket shall I say—to bring forward a candidate\r\nalternately?”\r\n\r\nSir Robert shook his head gravely. He would fight.\r\n\r\n“Allowing to you, Sir Robert, as the owner of the influence hitherto\r\ndominant in the borough, the first return.”\r\n\r\n“The first return—after the Bill passes?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nThat was a different thing. That was another thing altogether. A gleam\r\nof satisfaction shone for an instant under the baronet’s bushy\r\neyebrows. The object he had most at heart was to oust his treacherous\r\ncousin. And here was a method, sure and safe: more safe by far than any\r\ncontest under the new Bill?\r\n\r\n“Well I—I cannot say anything at this moment,” he said, at last, trying\r\nto hide his satisfaction. “These heats once over I do not see—your\r\nladyship will pardon me—why my influence should not still predominate.”\r\n\r\nIt was Lady Lansdowne’s turn. “And things be as before?” she answered.\r\n“No, Sir Robert, no. You forget those rights of the people which you\r\nwere so kind as to support a moment ago. Things will not be as before.\r\nBut—but perhaps I shall hear from you? Of course it is not a matter\r\nthat can be settled, as in the old days, by our people.”\r\n\r\n“You shall certainly hear,” he said, with something more than courtesy.\r\n“In the meantime——”\r\n\r\n“I am dying to see your daughter,” she answered. “I am told that she is\r\nvery lovely. Where is she?”\r\n\r\n“A few minutes ago she was in the Elm Walk,” Sir Robert answered, a\r\nslight flush betraying his gratification. “I will send for her.”\r\n\r\nBut her ladyship would not hear of this; nor would she suffer him to\r\nleave his post to escort her. “Here’s la belle Suffolk coming to take\r\nleave of you,” she said. “And I know my way.”\r\n\r\n“But you will not know her,” Sir Robert answered.\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne let her parasol sink over her shoulder. “I think I\r\nshall,” she said with a glance of meaning, “if she is like her mother.”\r\n\r\nAnd without waiting to see the effect of her words, she moved away. It\r\nwas said of old time of Juno, that she walked a Goddess confessed. And\r\nof Lady Lansdowne as she moved slowly across the sunny lawn before the\r\nchurch, her dainty skirts trailing and her parasol inclined, it might\r\nwith equal justice have been said, that she walked a great lady, of\r\nthat day when great ladies still were,\r\n\r\n_Nor mill nor mart had mocked the guinea’s stamp_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether she smiled on this person or bowed to that, or with a slighter\r\nmovement acknowledged the courtesy of those who, without claiming\r\nrecognition made respectful way for her, a gracious ease and a quiet\r\nnonchalance were in all her actions. The deeper emotions seemed as far\r\nfrom her as were Hodge and Joan playing Kiss in the Ring. But her last\r\nwords to Sir Robert had reacted on herself, and as she crossed the\r\nrustic bridge, she paused a moment to gaze on the water. The band was\r\nplaying the air of “She is far from the Land,” and tears rose to her\r\neyes as she recalled the past and pictured scene after scene, absurd or\r\npathetic in the career of the proud beauty who had once queened it\r\nhere, whose mad pranks and madder sayings had once filled these\r\nshrubberies with mirth or chagrin, and whose child she was about to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nShe sighed, as she resumed her course, unable even now to blame Lady\r\nSybil as her conduct to her child deserved. But where was the child?\r\nNot on the walk under the elms, which was deserted in favour of the\r\nmore lively attractions of the park. Lady Lansdowne looked this way and\r\nthat; at length availing herself of the solitude, she paced the walk to\r\nits end. Thence a short path which she well remembered, led to the\r\nkennels; and rather to indulge her sentiment and recall the days when\r\nshe was herself young, and had been intimate here, than because she\r\nexpected to meet Mary, she took this path. She had not followed it a\r\ndozen steps, and was hesitating whether to go on or return, the strains\r\nof Moore’s melody were scarcely blurred by the intervening laurels,\r\nwhen a tall dark-robed figure stepped with startling abruptness from\r\nthe shrubbery, and stood before her.\r\n\r\n“Louisa,” said the stranger. And she raised her veil. “Don’t you know\r\nme?”\r\n\r\n“Sybil!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sybil!” the other answered curtly. And then as if something in\r\nLady Lansdowne’s tone had wounded her, “Why not?” she continued,\r\nraising her head proudly. “My name came easily enough to your\r\nladyship’s lips once! And I am not aware that I have done anything to\r\ndeprive me of the right to call my friends by their names, be they whom\r\nthey may!”\r\n\r\n“No, no! But——”\r\n\r\n“But you meant it, Louisa!” the other retorted with energy. “Or is it\r\nthat you find me so changed, so old, so worn, so altered from her you\r\nonce knew, that it astonishes you to trace in this face the features of\r\nSybil Matching!”\r\n\r\n“You are changed,” the other answered kindly. “I fear you have been\r\nill?”\r\n\r\n“I am ill. I am more, I am dying. Not here, nor to-day, nor\r\nto-morrow——”\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne interrupted her. “In that sense,” she said gently, “we\r\nare all dying.” But though she said it, the change in Lady Sybil’s\r\nappearance did indeed shock her; almost as much as her presence in that\r\nplace amazed her.\r\n\r\n“I have but three months to live,” Lady Sybil answered feverishly; and\r\nher sunken cheeks and bright eyes, which told of some hidden disease,\r\nconfirmed her words. “I am dying in that sense! Do you hear? But I dare\r\nsay,” with a flash of her old levity, “it is my presence here that\r\nshocks you? You are thinking what Vermuyden would say if he turned the\r\ncorner behind you, and found us together!” And, as Lady Lansdowne, with\r\na nervous start, looked over her shoulder, with the old recklessness,\r\n“I’d like—I’d like to see his face, my dear, and yours, too, if he\r\nfound us. But,” she continued, with an abrupt change to impassioned\r\nearnestness, “it’s not to see you that I came to-day! Don’t think it!\r\nIt’s not to see you that I’ve been waiting for two hours past. I want\r\nto see my girl! I am going to see her, do you hear! You must bring her\r\nto me!”\r\n\r\n“Sybil!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t contradict me, Louisa,” she cried peremptorily. “Haven’t I told\r\nyou that I am dying? Don’t you hear what I say! Am I to die and not see\r\nmy child? Cruel woman! Heartless creature! But you always were! And\r\ncold as an icicle!”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, I am not! And I think you should see her,” Lady Lansdowne\r\nanswered, in no little distress. How could she not be distressed by the\r\ncontrast between this woman plainly and almost shabbily dressed—for the\r\npurpose perhaps of evading notice—and with illness stamped on her face,\r\nand the brilliant, harum-scarum Lady Sybil, with whom her thoughts had\r\nbeen busy a few minutes before? “I think you ought to see her,” she\r\nrepeated in a soothing tone. “But you should take the proper steps to\r\ndo so. You——”\r\n\r\n“You think—yes, you do!” Lady Vermuyden retorted with fierce\r\nenergy—“you think that I have treated her so ill that I have no right\r\nto see her! That I cannot care to see her! But you do not know how I\r\nwas tried! How I was suspected, how I was watched! What wrongs I\r\nsuffered! And—and I never meant to hide her for good. When I died, she\r\nwould have come home. And I had a plan too—but never mind that—to right\r\nher without Vermuyden’s knowledge and in his teeth. I saw her on a\r\ncoach one day along with—what is it?”\r\n\r\n“There is someone coming,” Lady Lansdowne said hurriedly. Her ladyship\r\nindeed was in a state of great apprehension. She knew that at any\r\nmoment she might be found, perhaps by Sir Robert: and the thought of\r\nthe scene which would follow—aware as she was of the exasperation of\r\nhis feelings—appalled her. She tried to temporise. “Another time,” she\r\nsaid. “I think someone is coming now. See me another time and I will do\r\nwhat I can.”\r\n\r\n“No!” the other broke in, her face flushing with sudden anger. “See\r\nyou, Louisa? What do I care for seeing you? It is my girl I wish to\r\nsee, that I’m come to see, that I’m going to see! I’m her mother, fetch\r\nher to me! I have a right to see her, and I will see her! I demand her!\r\nIf you do not go for her——”\r\n\r\n“Sybil! Sybil!” Lady Lansdowne cried, thoroughly alarmed by her\r\nfriend’s violence. “For Heaven’s sake be calm!”\r\n\r\n“Calm?” Lady Vermuyden answered. “Do you cease to dictate to me, and do\r\nas I bid you! Go, and fetch her, or I will go myself and claim her\r\nbefore all his friends. He has no heart. He never had a heart! It’s\r\nsawdust,” with a hysterical laugh. “But he has pride and I’ll trample\r\non it! I’ll tread it in the mud—if you don’t fetch her! Are you going,\r\nMiss Gravity? We used to call you Miss Gravity, I remember. You were\r\nalways,” with a faint sneer, “a bit of a prude, my dear!”\r\n\r\nMiss Gravity! What long-forgotten trifles, what thoughts of youth the\r\nnickname brought back to Lady Lansdowne’s recollection. What wars of\r\nmaidens’ wits, and half-owned jealousies, and light resentments, and\r\nsunny days of pique and pleasure! Her heart, never anything but soft,\r\nunder the mask of her great-lady’s manner, waxed sore and pitiful. Yet\r\nhow was she to do the other’s bidding? How could she betray Sir\r\nRobert’s confidence? How——\r\n\r\nSomeone was coming—really coming this time. She looked round.\r\n\r\n“I’ll give you five minutes!” Lady Sybil whispered. “Five minutes,\r\nLouisa! Remember!”\r\n\r\nAnd when Lady Lansdowne turned again to her, she had vanished among the\r\nlaurels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII\r\nWOMEN’S HEARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne walked slowly away in a state of perplexity, from which\r\nthe monotonous lilt of the band which was now playing quadrille music\r\ndid nothing to free her. Whether Sybil Vermuyden were dying or not, it\r\nwas certain that she was ill. Disease had laid its hand beyond\r\nmistaking on that once beautiful face; the levity and wit which had\r\nformerly dazzled beholders now gleamed but fitfully and with such a\r\nghastly light as the corpse candle gives forth. The change was great\r\nsince Lady Lansdowne had seen her in the coach at Chippenham; and it\r\nmight well be that if words of forgiveness were to be spoken, no time\r\nwas to be lost. Old associations, a mother’s feelings for a mother,\r\npity, all urged Lady Lansdowne to compliance with her request; nor did\r\nthe knowledge that the woman, who had once queened it so brilliantly in\r\nthis place, was now lurking on the fringe of the gay crowd, athirst for\r\na sight of her child, fail to move a heart which all the jealousies of\r\na Whig coterie had not hardened or embittered.\r\n\r\nUnluckily the owner of that heart felt that she was the last person who\r\nought to interfere. It behoved her, more than it behoved anyone, to\r\navoid fresh ground of quarrel with Sir Robert. Courteously as he had\r\nborne himself on her arrival, civilly as he had veiled the surprise\r\nwhich her presence caused him, she knew that he was sore hurt by his\r\ndefeat in the borough. And if those who had thwarted him publicly were\r\nto intervene in his private concerns, if those who had suborned his\r\nkinsman were now to tamper with his daughter, ay, or were to incur a\r\nsuspicion of tampering, she knew that his anger would know no bounds.\r\nShe felt, indeed, that it would be justified.\r\n\r\nShe had to think, too, of her husband, who had sent her with the\r\nolive-branch. He was a politic, long-sighted man; who, content with the\r\nsolid advantage he had gained, had no mind to push to extremity a\r\nstruggle which must needs take place at his own door. He would be\r\ndispleased, seriously displeased, if her mission, in place of closing,\r\nwidened the breach.\r\n\r\nAnd yet—and yet her heart ached for the woman, who had never wholly\r\nlost a place in her affections. And there was this. If Lady Sybil were\r\nthwarted no one was more capable of carrying out her threat and of\r\ntaking some violent step, which would make matters a hundred times\r\nworse, alike for Sir Robert and his daughter.\r\n\r\nWhile she weighed the matter, Lady Lansdowne found herself back at the\r\nrustic bridge. She was in the act of stepping upon it—still deep in\r\nthought—when her eyes encountered those of a young couple who were\r\nwaiting at the farther end to give her passage. She looked a second\r\ntime; and she stood. Then, smiling, she beckoned to the girl to come to\r\nher. Meanwhile, a side-thought, born of the conjunction of the two\r\nyoung people, took form in her mind. “I hope that may come to nothing,”\r\nshe reflected.\r\n\r\nPossibly it was for this reason, that when the man would have come\r\nalso, she made it clear that the smile was not for him. “No, Mr.\r\nFlixton,” she said, the faintest possible distance in her tone. “I do\r\nnot want you. I will relieve you of your charge.”\r\n\r\nAnd when Mary, timid and blushing, had advanced to her, “My dear,” she\r\nsaid, holding out both her hands, and looking charmingly at her, “I\r\nshould have known you anywhere.” And she drew her to her and kissed\r\nher. “I am Lady Lansdowne. I knew your mother, and I hope that you and\r\nmy daughter will be friends.”\r\n\r\nThe mention of her mother increased Mary’s shyness. “Your ladyship is\r\nvery kind,” she murmured. She did not know that her embarrassment was\r\nso far from hurting her, that the appeal in her eyes went straight to\r\nthe elder woman’s heart.\r\n\r\n“I mean to be kind at any rate,” Lady Lansdowne answered, smiling on\r\nthe lovely face before her. And then, “My dear,” she said, “have they\r\ntold you that you are very beautiful? More beautiful, I think, than\r\nyour mother was: I hope”—and she did not try to hide the depth of her\r\nfeelings—“that you may be more happy.”\r\n\r\nThe girl’s colour faded at this second reference to her mother; made,\r\nshe could not doubt, with intention. Her father, even while he had\r\noverwhelmed her with benefits, even while he had opened this new life\r\nto her with a hand full of gifts, had taught her—tacitly or by a word\r\nat most—that that name was the key to a Bluebeard’s chamber; that it\r\nmust not be used. She knew that her mother lived; she guessed that she\r\nhad sinned against her husband; she understood that she had wronged her\r\nchild. But she knew no more: and with this, since this at the least she\r\nmust know, Sir Robert would have had her content.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, to speak correctly, she did know more. She knew that the\r\nveiled lady who had intervened at long intervals in her life must have\r\nbeen her mother. But she felt no impulse of affection towards that\r\nwoman—whom she had not seen. Her heart went out instead to a shadowy\r\nmother who walked the silent house at sunset, whose skirts trailed in\r\nthe lonely passages, of whose career of wild and reckless gaiety she\r\nhad vague hints here and there. It was to this mother, radiant and\r\nyoung, with the sheen of pearls in her hair, and the haunting smile,\r\nthat she yearned. She had learned in some subtle way that the vacant\r\nplace over the mantel in the hall which her own portrait by Maclise was\r\nto fill, had been occupied by her mother’s picture. And dreaming of the\r\npast, as what young girl alone in that stately house would not, she had\r\nseen her come and go in the half lights, a beautiful, spoilt child of\r\nfashion. She had traced her up and down the wide polished stairway,\r\nheard the tap of her slender sandal on the shining floors, perceived in\r\nlong-closed chambers the fading odours of her favourite scent. And in a\r\ntimid, frightened way she had longed to know her and to love her, to\r\nfeel her touch on her hair and give her pity in return.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that she might have dwelt more intimately on Lady\r\nSybil’s fate, possible that she might have ventured on some line of her\r\nown in regard to her, if her new life had been free from preoccupation;\r\nif there had not been with her an abiding regret, which clouded the\r\nsunniest prospects. But love, man’s love, woman’s love, is the most\r\ncruel of monopolists: it tramples on the claims of the present, much\r\nmore of the absent. And if the novelty of Mary’s new life, the many\r\nmarvels to which she must accustom herself, the new pleasures, the new\r\nduties, the strange new feeling of wealth—if, in fine, the necessity of\r\norientating herself afresh in relation to every person and\r\neverything—was not able to put thoughts of her lover from her mind, the\r\nclaims of an unknown mother had an infinitely smaller chance of\r\nasserting themselves.\r\n\r\nBut now at that word, twice pronounced by Lady Lansdowne, the girl\r\nstood ashamed and conscience-stricken. “You knew my mother?” she\r\nfaltered.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear,” the elder woman answered gravely. “I knew her very\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nThe gravity of the speaker’s tone presented a new idea to Mary’s mind.\r\n“She is not happy?” she said slowly.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\nWith that word Lady Lansdowne looked over her shoulder; conscience\r\nmakes cowards, and her nervousness communicated itself to Mary. A\r\npossibility, at which the girl had never glanced, presented itself, and\r\nso abruptly that all the colour left her face. “She is not here?” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Yes, she is here. And—don’t be frightened, my dear!” Lady Lansdowne\r\ncontinued earnestly. “But listen to me! A moment ago I thought of\r\nthrowing you in her way without your knowledge. But, since I have seen\r\nyou, I have your welfare at heart, as well as hers. And I must, I ought\r\nto tell you, that I do not think your father would wish you to see her.\r\nI think that you should know this; and that you should decide for\r\nyourself—whether you will see her. Indeed, you must decide for\r\nyourself,” she repeated, her eyes fixed anxiously on the girl’s face.\r\n“I cannot take the responsibility.”\r\n\r\n“She is unhappy?” Mary asked, looking most unhappy herself.\r\n\r\n“She is unhappy, and she is ill.”\r\n\r\n“I ought to go to her? You think so? Please—your ladyship, will you\r\nadvise me?”\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne hesitated. “I cannot,” she said.\r\n\r\n“But—there is no reason,” Mary asked faintly, “why I should not go to\r\nher?”\r\n\r\n“There is no reason. I honestly believe,” Lady Lansdowne repeated\r\nsolemnly, “that there is no reason—except your father’s wish. It is for\r\nyou to say how far that, which should weigh with you in all other\r\nthings, shall weigh with you in this.”\r\n\r\nSuddenly a burning colour dyed Mary’s face. “I will go to her,” she\r\ncried impulsively. She had been weak once, she had been weak! And how\r\nshe had suffered for that weakness! But she would be strong now. “Where\r\nis she, if you please?” she continued bravely. “Can I see her at once?”\r\n\r\n“She is in the path leading to the kennels. You know it? No, you need\r\nnot take leave of me, child! Go, and,” Lady Lansdowne added with\r\nfeeling, “God forgive me if I have done wrong in sending you!”\r\n\r\n“You have not done wrong!” Mary cried, an unwonted spirit in her tone.\r\nAnd, without taking other leave, she turned and went—though her limbs\r\ntrembled under her. She was going to her mother! To her mother! Oh,\r\nstrange, oh, impossible thought!\r\n\r\nYet, engrossing as was that thought, it could not quite oust fear of\r\nher father and of his anger. And the blush soon died; so that the\r\nwhiteness of her cheeks when she reached the Kennel Path was a poor set\r\noff for the ribbons that decked her muslin robe. What she expected,\r\nwhat she wished or feared or hoped she could never remember. What she\r\nsaw, that which awaited her, was a woman, ill, and plainly clad, with\r\nonly the remains of beauty in her wasted features; but withal cynical\r\nand hard-eyed, and very, very far from the mother of her day-dreams.\r\n\r\nSuch as she was the unknown scanned Mary with a kind of scornful\r\namusement. “Oh,” she said, “so this is what they have made of Miss\r\nVermuyden? Let me look at you, girl?” And laying her hands on Mary’s\r\nshoulders she looked long into the tearful, agitated face. “Why, you\r\nare like a sheet of paper!” she continued, raising the girl’s chin with\r\nher finger. “I wonder you dared to come with Sir Robert saying no! And,\r\nyou little fool,” she continued in a swift spirit of irritation, “as\r\nsoon not come at all, as look at me like that! You’ve got my chin and\r\nmy nose, and more of me than I thought. But God knows where you got\r\nyour hare’s eyes! Are you always frightened?”\r\n\r\n“No, Ma’am, no!” she stammered.\r\n\r\n“No, Ma’am? No, goose!” Lady Sybil retorted, mimicking her. “Why, ten\r\nkings on ten thrones had never made me shake as you are shaking! Nor\r\ntwenty Sir Roberts in twenty passions! What is it you are afraid of?\r\nBeing found with me?”\r\n\r\n“No!” Mary cried. And, to do her justice, the emotion with which Lady\r\nSybil found fault was as much a natural agitation, on seeing her\r\nmother, as fear on her own account.\r\n\r\n“Then you are afraid of me?” Lady Sybil rejoined. And again she\r\ntwitched the girl’s face to the light.\r\n\r\nMary was amazed rather than afraid: but she could not say that. And she\r\nkept silence.\r\n\r\n“Or is it dislike of me?” the mother continued—a slight grimace, as of\r\npain, distorting her face. “You hate me, I suppose? You hate me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no!” the girl cried in distress.\r\n\r\n“You do, Miss!” And with no little violence she pushed Mary from her.\r\n“You set down all to me, I suppose! I’ve kept you from your own, that’s\r\nit! I am the wicked mother, worse than a step-mother, who robbed you of\r\nyour rights! And made a beggar of you and would have kept you a beggar!\r\nI am she who wronged you and robbed you—the unnatural mother! And you\r\nnever ask,” she went on with fierce, impulsive energy, “what I\r\nsuffered? How I was wronged! What I bore! No, nor what I meant to\r\ndo—with you!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, indeed——”\r\n\r\n“What I meant to do, I say!” Lady Sybil repeated violently. “At my\r\ndeath—and I am dying, but what is that to you?—all would have been\r\ntold, girl! And you would have got your own. Do you believe me?” she\r\nadded passionately, advancing a step in a manner almost menacing. “Do\r\nyou believe me, girl?”\r\n\r\n“I do, I do!” Mary cried, inexpressibly pained by the other’s\r\nvehemence.\r\n\r\n“I’ll swear it, if you like! But I hoped that he—your father—would die\r\nfirst and never know! He deserved no better! He deserved nothing of me!\r\nAnd then you’d have stepped into all! Or better still—do you remember\r\nthe day you travelled to Bristol? It’s not so long ago that you need\r\nforget it, Miss Vermuyden! I was in the coach, and I saw you, and I saw\r\nthe young man who was with you. I knew him, and I told myself that\r\nthere was a God after all, though I’d often doubted it, or you two\r\nwould not have been brought together! I saw another way then, but you’d\r\nhave parted and known nothing, if,” she continued, laughing recklessly,\r\n“I had not helped Providence, and sent him with a present to your\r\nschool! But—why, you’re red enough now, girl! What is it?”\r\n\r\n“He knew?” Mary murmured, with an effort. “You told him who I was,\r\nMa’am?”\r\n\r\n“He knew no more than a doll!” Lady Sybil answered. “I told him\r\nnothing, or he’d have told again! I know his kind. No, I thought to get\r\nall for you and thwart Vermuyden, too! I thought to marry his heir to\r\nthe little schoolmistress—it was an opera touch, my dear, and beyond\r\nall the Tremaynes and Vivian Greys in the world! But there, when all\r\npromised well, that slut of a maid went to my husband, and trumped my\r\ntrick!”\r\n\r\n“And Mr.—Mr. Vaughan,” Mary stammered, “had no knowledge—who I was?”\r\n\r\n“Mr.—Mr. Vaughan!” Lady Sybil repeated, mocking her, “had no knowledge?\r\nNo! Not a jot, not a tittle! But what?” she went on, in a tone of\r\nderision, “Sits the wind there, Miss Meek? You’re not all milk and\r\nwater, bread and butter and backboard, then, but have a spice of your\r\nmother, after all? Mr.—Mr. Vaughan!” again she mimicked her. “Why, if\r\nyou were fond of the man, didn’t you say so?”\r\n\r\nMary, under the fire of those sharp, hard eyes, could not restrain her\r\ntears. But, overcome as she was, she managed in broken words to explain\r\nthat her father had forbidden it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, your father, was it?” Lady Sybil rejoined. “He said ‘No,’ and no\r\nit was! And the lord of my heart and the Man of Feeling is dismissed in\r\ndisgrace! And now we weep in secret and the worm feeds on our damask\r\ncheek!” she ran on in a tone of raillery, assumed perhaps to hide a\r\ndeeper feeling. “I suppose,” she added shrewdly, “Sir Robert would have\r\nyou think that Vaughan knew who you were, and was practising on you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“And you dismissed him at papa’s command, eh? That was it, was it?”\r\n\r\nMary could only confess the fact with tears, her distress in as strange\r\ncontrast with the gaiety of her dress as with the strains of the\r\nneighbouring band, which told of festivity and pleasure. Perhaps some\r\nthought of this nature forced itself upon Lady Sybil’s light and\r\nevasive mind: for as she looked, the cynical expression of her eyes\r\ngave place to one of feeling and emotion, better fitted to those wasted\r\nfeatures as well as to the relation in which the two stood to one\r\nanother. She looked down the path, as if for the first time she feared\r\nan intrusive eye. Then her glance reverted to her daughter’s slender\r\nform and drooping head: and again it changed, it grew soft, it grew\r\npitiful. The laurels shut all in, the path was empty. The maternal\r\nfeeling, long repressed, long denied, long buried under a mountain of\r\npique and resentment, of fancied wrongs and real neglect, broke forth\r\nirresistibly. In a step she was at the girl’s side, and snatching her\r\nto her bosom in a fierce embrace, was covering her face, her neck, her\r\nhair with hungry kisses.\r\n\r\nThe action was so sudden, so unexpected, that crushed and even hurt by\r\nthe other’s grasp, and frightened by her vehemence, Mary would have\r\nresisted, would have tried to free herself. Then she understood. And a\r\nrush of pent-up affection, of love and pity, carried away the barriers\r\nof constraint and timidity. She clung to Lady Sybil with tears of joy,\r\nmurmuring low broken words, calling her “Mother, Mother,” burying her\r\nface on her shoulder, pressing herself against her. In a moment her\r\nbeing was stirred to its depths. In all her life no one had caressed\r\nher after this fashion, no one had embraced her with passion, no one\r\nhad kissed her with more than the placid affection which gentleness and\r\ngoodness earn, and which kind offices kindly performed warrant. Even\r\nSir Robert, even her father, proud as he was of her, much as he loved\r\nher, had awakened in her respect and gratitude—mingled with fear—rather\r\nthan love.\r\n\r\nAfter a time, warned by approaching voices, Lady Sybil put her from\r\nher; but with a low and exultant laugh. “You are mine, now!” she said,\r\n“Mine! Mine! You will come to me when I want you. And I shall want you\r\nsoon! Very soon!”\r\n\r\nMary laid hold of her again. “Let me come now!” she cried with passion,\r\nforgetting all but the mother she had gained, the clinging arms which\r\nhad cherished her, the kisses that had rained on her. “Let me come to\r\nyou! You are ill!”\r\n\r\n“No, not now! Not now! I will send for you when I want you,” Lady Sybil\r\nanswered. “I will promise to send for you. And you will come,” she\r\nadded with the same ring of triumph in her voice. “You will come!” For\r\nit was joy to her, even amid the satisfaction of her mother-love, to\r\nknow that she had tricked her husband; it was joy to her to know that\r\nthough she had taken all from the child and he had given all, the child\r\nwas hers—hers, and could never be taken from her! “You will come! For\r\nyou will not have me long. But,” she whispered, as the voices came\r\nnearer, “go now! Go now! And not a word! Not a word, child, as you love\r\nme. I will send for you when—when my time comes.”\r\n\r\nAnd with a last look, strangely made up of love and pain and triumph,\r\nLady Sybil moved out of sight among the laurels. And Mary, drying her\r\ntears and composing her countenance as well as she could, turned to\r\nmeet the intruders’ eyes.\r\n\r\nFortunately—for she was far from being herself—the two persons who had\r\nwandered that way, did but pause at the end of the Kennel Path, and,\r\nmurmuring small talk, turn again to retrace their steps. She gained a\r\nminute or two, in which to collect her thoughts and smooth her hair;\r\nbut more than a minute or two she dared not linger lest her continued\r\nabsence should arouse curiosity. As sedately as she could, she emerged\r\nfrom the shrubbery and made her way—though her breast heaved with a\r\nhundred emotions—towards the rustic bridge on which she saw that Lady\r\nLansdowne was standing, keeping Sir Robert in talk.\r\n\r\nIn talk, indeed, of her. For as she approached he placed the\r\ncoping-stone on the edifice of her praises which her ladyship had\r\ncraftily led him to build. “The most docile,” he said, “I assure you,\r\nthe most docile child you can imagine! A beautiful disposition. She is\r\ndocility itself!”\r\n\r\n“I hope she may always remain so,” Lady Lansdowne answered slily.\r\n\r\n“I’ve no doubt she will,” Sir Robert replied with fond assurance, his\r\neye on the Honourable Bob, who was approaching the bridge from the\r\nlawns.\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne followed the look with her eyes and smiled. But she said\r\nnothing. She turned to Mary, who was now near at hand, and reading in\r\nthe girl’s looks plain traces of trouble, and agitation, she contented\r\nherself with sending for Lady Louisa, and asking that her carriage\r\nmight be called. In this way she cloaked under a little bustle the\r\ngirl’s embarrassment as she came up to them and joined them. Five\r\nminutes later Lady Lansdowne was gone.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter that, Mary would have had only too much food for thought, had her\r\nmother alone filled her mind; had those kisses which had so stirred her\r\nbeing, those clinging arms, and that face which bore the deep imprint\r\nof illness, alone burdened her memory. Years afterwards the beat of the\r\nmusic which played in the gardens that evening, while the party within\r\nsat at dinner, haunted her; bringing back, as such things will, the\r\nscene and her aching heart, the outward glitter and the inward care,\r\nthe Honourable Bob’s gallantries and her father’s stately figure as he\r\nrose and drank wine with her; ay, and the hip, hip, hurrah which shook\r\nthe glasses when an old Squire, a privileged person, rose, before she\r\ncould leave, and toasted her.\r\n\r\nBurdened only with the sacred memories of the afternoon, and the\r\nanxiety, the pity, the love which they engendered, she had been far\r\nfrom happy, far from free. But in truth, with all her feeling for her\r\nmother, Mary bore about with her a keener and more bitter regret. The\r\ndull pain which had troubled her of late when thoughts of Arthur\r\nVaughan would beset her was grown to a pang of shame, almost\r\nintolerable. She had told herself a hundred times before this that it\r\nwas her weakness, her fear of her father, her mean compliance that had\r\nled her to give him up—rather than any real belief in his baseness. For\r\nshe had never, she was sure now, believed in that baseness. But now,\r\nnow when her mother, whose word it never struck her to doubt, had\r\naffirmed his innocence, now that she knew, now since a phrase of that\r\nmother’s had brought to her mind every incident of the\r\nnever-to-be-forgotten coach-drive, the May morning, the sunshine and\r\nthe budding trees, the birth of love—pain gnawed at her heart. She was\r\nsick with misery.\r\n\r\nFor, oh, how vile, how thankless, how poor and small a thing he must\r\nthink her! He would have given her all, and she had robbed him of all.\r\nAnd then when she had robbed him and he could give her little she had\r\nturned her back on him, abandoned him, believed evil of him, heard him\r\ninsulted, and joined in the outrage! Over that thought, over that\r\nmemory, she shed many and many a bitter tear. Romance had come to her\r\nin her lowliness, and a noble lover, stooping to her; and she had\r\nkilled the one and denied the other. And now, now there was nothing she\r\ncould do, nothing she would dare to do.\r\n\r\nFor that she had for a moment believed in his baseness—if she had\r\nindeed believed—was not the worst. In that she had been the sport of\r\ncircumstances; appearances had deceived her, and the phase had been\r\nbrief. But that she had been weak, that she had been swayed, that she\r\nhad given him up at a word, that she had shown herself wholly unworthy\r\nof him—there was the rub. Now, how happy had she been could she have\r\ngone back to Miss Sibson’s, and the dull schoolroom and the old stuff\r\ndress and the children’s prattle—and heard his step as he came across\r\nthe forecourt to the door!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII\r\nIN THE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn truth Mary’s notion of the opinion which Arthur Vaughan had of her\r\nwas above, rather than below, the reality. In her most despondent\r\nmoments she scarcely exaggerated the things he thought of her, the\r\ncontempt in which he held her, or the resentment which set his blood\r\nboiling when he remembered how she had treated him. He had gone to her\r\nand laid all that was left to him at her feet; and she, who had already\r\ndealt his fortunes so terrible a blow, had paid him for his unselfish\r\noffer, for his sacrifice of much that was dear to him, with suspicion,\r\nwith contumely, with mistrust! Instead of clinging to him, to whom she\r\nhad that moment plighted her troth, she had deserted him at a word. In\r\nplace of trusting the man who had woo’d her in her poverty, she had\r\nbelieved the first whisper against him. She had shown herself\r\nheartless, faithless, inconstant as the wind—a very woman! And\r\n\r\n_Away, away—your smile’s a curse\r\nOh, blot me from the race of men,\r\nKind pitying Heaven! by death or worse_\r\n\r\n_Before I love such things again!_\r\n\r\n\r\nhe might have murmured with a bitterness of which the author of the\r\nlines had been incapable. But then, Mr. Moore, though his poetry and\r\nhis singing brought tears to the eyes of hardened women of fashion, had\r\nnever lost at a blow a great estate, a high position, and his love.\r\n\r\nCertainly Vaughan had, if man ever had, grounds for a quarrel with\r\nfate. He had left London heart-whole and happy, the heir to a large\r\nfortune. He returned a fortnight later, a member of the Commons House\r\nindeed, but heart-sick and soured, beggared of his expectations and\r\ntortured by the thought of what might have been—if his love had proved\r\ntrue as she was fair, and constant as she was sweet. Fond dreams of her\r\nbeauty still tormented him. Visions of the modest home in which he\r\nwould have found consolation in failure, and smiles in success, rose up\r\nbefore him and derided him. He hated Sir Robert. He hated, or tried to\r\nhate, the weakest and the most despicable of women. He saw all things\r\nand all men with a jaundiced eye, the sound of his voice and the look\r\nof his face were altered. Men who knew him and who passed him in the\r\nstreet, or who saw him eating his chop in solitary churlishness, nudged\r\none another and said that he took his reverses ill; while others,\r\nwounded by his curtness or his ill-humour, added that he did not go the\r\nright way to make the most of what was left.\r\n\r\nFor a certainty he was become a man unpleasant to handle. But within,\r\nunder the thorns, was a very human soul, wounded, sore, and miserable,\r\nseeking every way for an outlet from its pains, and finding hope of\r\nescape at one point only. Men were right, when they said that he did\r\nnot go the way to make the most of his chances. For he laid himself out\r\nto please no one at this time; it was not in him. But he worked late\r\nand early, and with a furious energy to fit himself for a political\r\ncareer; believing that success in that career was all that was left to\r\nhim, and that by the necessary labour he could best put the past behind\r\nhim. Love and pleasure, and those sweets of home life of which he had\r\ndreamed, were gone from him. But the stern prizes of ambition, the\r\ncrown of those who live laborious days, might still be his—if the\r\nMirror of Parliament were never out of his hands, and if Mr. Hume\r\nhimself were not more constant to his favourite pillar under the\r\ngallery than he to such chance seat as might fall to him on the same\r\nside of the House.\r\n\r\nAlas, he had not taken the oaths an hour—with a sore heart, in a ruck\r\nof undistinguished new Members—before he saw that success was not so\r\nnear or so clearly within reach, as hope, with her flattering tale, had\r\nargued. The times were propitious, certainly. The debates were close\r\nand fiery, and were scanned out of doors with an interest unknown\r\nbefore. The strife between Croker and Macaulay in the Commons, the duel\r\nbetween Brougham and Lyndhurst in the Lords, were followed in the\r\ncountry with as much attention as a battle between Belcher and Tom\r\nCribb; and by the same classes. Everywhere men talked politics, talked\r\nof Reform, and of little else. The clubs, the ’Change, the taverns,\r\nnay, the drawing-rooms and the schools rang with the Bill, the whole\r\nBill, and nothing but the Bill; with Schedule A, cruel as Herod, and\r\nSchedule B, which spared one of twins. Before the window in the\r\nHaymarket which weekly displayed H.B.’s Political Caricatures, crowds\r\nstood gazing all day long, whatever the weather.\r\n\r\nThese things were in his favour. He remembered, too, the stress which\r\nthe Chancellor had laid on the advantage of entering the House in\r\nadvance of the crowd of new men whom the first Reformed Parliament must\r\ncontain.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it seemed to him that he was one of just such a mob of\r\nnew men, as it was. Nearly a fourth of his colleagues were strange to\r\nSt. Stephen’s; and the greater part of these, owing to the\r\ncircumstances of the election, were Whigs and sat on his side of the\r\nHouse. To raise his head above the level of a hundred competitors,\r\nnumbering not a few men of wit and ability, and to do so within the\r\nshort life of the present Parliament—-for he saw no certain prospect of\r\nbeing returned again—was no mean task. Little wonder that he was as\r\nregular in his attendance as Mr. Speaker, and grew pale of nights over\r\nWoodfall’s Important Debates.\r\n\r\nIn the pride of his first return he had dreamed of a reputation to be\r\ngained by his maiden speech; of burning periods that would astonish all\r\nwho heard them, of flights of fancy to live forever in the mouths of\r\nmen, of a marshalling of facts so masterly, and an exposition of\r\nfigures so clear, as to obscure the fame of Single-speech Hamilton, or\r\nof that modern phenomenon, Mr. Sadler. But whatever the effect of the\r\npresent chamber on the minds of novices, there was that in the\r\nold,—mean and dingy as was its wainscotted interior, and cumbered by\r\noverhanging galleries—there was a something, were it but the memory\r\nthat those walls had echoed the diatribes of Chatham and given back the\r\nvoice of Burke, had heard the laugh of Walpole and the snore of North,\r\nwhich cooled the spirit of a new member; which shook his knees as\r\neffectually as if the panelling of the room had vanished at a touch,\r\nand revealed the glories of the Gothic Chapel which lay behind it. For\r\nbehind that panelling and those galleries, the ancient Chapel, with its\r\nsumptuous tracery and statues, its frescoed walls and stained glass,\r\nstill existed; no unfit image of the stately principles which lie\r\nbehind the dull everyday working of our Constitution.\r\n\r\nTo Arthur Vaughan, a student of the history of the House, this effect\r\nof the Chamber upon a new member was a commonplace. But he was a\r\npractised speaker in the mimic arena; and he thought that he might rise\r\nabove this feeling in his own case. He fancied that he understood the\r\n_Genius Loci_; its hatred of affectation, and almost of eloquence, its\r\ndislike to be bored, its preference for the easy, the conversational,\r\nand the personal. And when he had waited three weeks—so much he gave to\r\nprudence—his time came.\r\n\r\nHe rose in a moderately thin house in the middle of the dinner-hour;\r\nand rose as he thought fully prepared. Indeed he started well. He\r\nbrought out two or three sentences with ease and aplomb; and he fancied\r\nthe difficulty over, the threshold passed. But then—he knew not why,\r\nnor could he overcome the feeling—the silence, kindly meant, in which\r\nas a new Member, he was received, had a terrifying effect upon him. A\r\nmist rose before his eyes, his voice sounded strange to him—and\r\ndistant. He dropped the thread of what he was saying, repeated himself,\r\nlost his nerve. For some seconds, standing there with all faces turned\r\nto him—they seemed numberless seconds to him, though in truth they were\r\nfew—he could see nothing but the Speaker’s wig, grown to an immense\r\nwhite cauliflower, which swelled and swelled and swelled until it\r\nfilled the whole House. He stammered, repeated himself again—and was\r\nsilent. And then, seeing that he was embarrassed, they cheered him—and\r\nthe mist cleared; and he went on—hurriedly and nervously. But he was\r\naware that he had dropped a link in his argument—which he had not now\r\nthe coolness to supply. And when he had murmured a few sentences, more\r\nor less inept and incoherent, he sat down.\r\n\r\nIn fact, though he had made no mark, he had also incurred no discredit.\r\nBut he felt that the eyes of all were on him, that they were gloating\r\nover his failure, and comparing what he had done with what he had hoped\r\nto do, his achievement with those secret hopes, those cherished\r\naspirations, he felt all the shame of open and disgraceful defeat. His\r\nface burned; he sat looking before him, not daring for a while to\r\ndivert his gaze, or to learn in others’ eyes how great had been his\r\nmishap.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when he ventured to change his posture, and to put on\r\nhis hat, which he discovered he had been holding in his hand, he\r\nencountered Sergeant Wathen’s eyes; and he read in them a look of\r\namusement, which wounded his pride more than the open ridicule of a\r\ncrowd. That was the finishing stroke. He walked out soon afterwards,\r\nbearing himself as indifferently as he could. But no man ever carried\r\nout of the House a lower heart or a sense of more utter failure. He had\r\nmistaken his talents, he had no aptitude for debate. Success as a\r\nspeaker was not within his reach.\r\n\r\nHe thought something better of it next day, but not much. Nor could he\r\nput off a sneaking, hang-dog air as he entered the lobby. A number of\r\nmembers were gathered inside the double doors, where the stairs from\r\nthe cloisters came up by a third door; and one or two whom he knew\r\nspoke to him—but not of his attempt. He fancied that he read in their\r\nlooks a knowledge that he had failed, that he was no longer a man to be\r\nreckoned with. He imagined that they used a different tone to him. And\r\nat last one of them spoke of it.\r\n\r\n“Well, Vaughan,” he said pleasantly, “you got through yesterday. But if\r\nyou’ll take my advice you’ll wait a bit. It’s only one here and there\r\ncan make much of it to begin.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly cannot,” Vaughan said, smiling frankly, the better to hide\r\nhis mortification.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, you’re not alone,” the other answered, shrugging his\r\nshoulders. “You’ll pick it up by and by, I dare say.” And he turned to\r\nspeak to another member.\r\n\r\nVaughan turned on his side to the paper for the day winch hung against\r\neach of the four pillars of the lobby; and he pretended to be absorbed\r\nin it. The employment helped him to keep his countenance. But he was\r\nsore wounded. He had held his head so high in imagination, he had given\r\nso loose a rein to his ambition; he had dreamt of making such an\r\nimpression on the House as Mr. Macaulay, though new to it, had made in\r\nhis speech on the second reading of the former Bill, and had deepened\r\nby his speech at the like stage of the present Bill. Now he was told\r\nthat he was no worse than the common run of country members, who twice\r\nin three sessions rose and blundered through half a dozen sentences! He\r\nwas consoled with the reflection that only “one here and there”\r\nsucceeded! Only one here and there! When to him it was everything to\r\nsucceed, and to succeed quickly. When it was all he had left.\r\n\r\nThe stream of members, entering the House, was large; for the motion to\r\ncommit the Bill was down for that afternoon, and if carried, would\r\nvirtually put an end to opposition in the Commons. Out of the corner of\r\nhis eye Vaughan scanned them, as they passed, and envied them. Peel,\r\ncold, proud and unapproachable, went by on the arm of Goulburn. Croker,\r\npale and saturnine, casting frowning glances here and there, went in\r\nalone. The handsome, portly form of Sir James Graham passed, in talk\r\nwith the Rupert of Debate. After these a rush of members; and at the\r\ntail of all slouched in the unwieldy, slovenly form of Sir Charles\r\nWetherell, followed by a couple of his satellites.\r\n\r\nVaughan, glancing on one side of the paper which he appeared to be\r\nstudying, caught Sir Charles’s eye, and reddened. Seated on opposite\r\nsides of the House—and no man on either side was more bitter, virulent,\r\nand pugnacious than the late Attorney-General—the two had not\r\nencountered one another since that evening at Stapylton, when the\r\nexistence of Sir Robert’s daughter had been disclosed to Vaughan. They\r\nhad not spoken, much less had there been any friendly passage between\r\nthem. But now Sir Charles paused, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n“How do you do, Mr. Vaughan?” he said, in his deep bass voice. “Your\r\nmaiden essay yesterday, eh?”\r\n\r\nVaughan winced. “Yes,” he said stiffly, fancying that he read amusement\r\nin the other’s moist eye.\r\n\r\nTo his surprise, “You’ll do,” Sir Charles rejoined, looking at the\r\nfloor and speaking in a despondent tone. “The House would rather you\r\nbegan in that way, than like some d——d peacock on a lady’s terrace.\r\nTake the opportunity of saying three or four sentences some fine day,\r\nand repeat it a week later. And I’ll wager you’ll do.”\r\n\r\n“But little, I am afraid,” Vaughan said. None the less was his heart\r\nfull of gratitude to the fat, ungainly man.\r\n\r\n“All, may be,” Wetherell answered. “I shouldn’t wonder. I’ve been told,\r\nby one who heard him, that Canning hesitated in his first speech, very\r\nmuch as you did. It was on the Sardinian Subsidy. The men who don’t\r\nfeel the House never know the House. They dazzle it, Mr. Vaughan, but\r\nthey don’t guide it. And that’s what we’ve got to do.”\r\n\r\nHe passed on then, with a melancholy nod and averted eyes, but Vaughan\r\ncould have blest him for that “we.” “There’s one man at least believes\r\nin me,” he told himself. And when a few hours later, in the midst of a\r\nscene as turbulent as any which the House of Commons had ever\r\nwitnessed—nine times without a pause it divided on the motion that\r\n“this House do now adjourn”—he watched the man who had commended him,\r\nriding the storm and directing the whirlwind, now lashing the Whigs to\r\nfury by his sarcasm, and now, carrying the whole House away in a\r\nhurricane of laughter, if he did not approve—and with his views he\r\ncould not approve—he learnt, and learnt much. He saw that the fat,\r\nslovenly man, with the heavy face and that hiatus between his breeches\r\nand his waistcoat which had made him famous, was allowed to do things,\r\nand to say things, and to look things, for which a less honest man had\r\nbeen hurried long ago to the Clock Tower. And this, because the House\r\nbelieved in him; because it knew that he was fighting for a principle\r\nreally dear to him; because it knew that he honestly put faith in those\r\npredictions of woe, which he scattered so freely, and in that ruin of\r\nthe Constitution, with which he twitted his opponents.\r\n\r\nA week later Vaughan acted upon his advice. He seized an opportunity\r\nand, catching the Chairman’s eye—the Bill was in Committee—delivered\r\nhimself of a dozen sentences, with so much spirit and propriety, that\r\nSir Robert Peel, speaking an hour later, referred to the “plausible\r\ndefence raised by the Honourable Member for Chippinge.” The reference\r\ndrew all eyes to Vaughan: and though nothing was said to him and he\r\ntook care to bear himself as if he had done no better than before, he\r\nleft the House with a lighter step and a comfortable warmth about the\r\nheart. He was more at ease that evening, if not more happy, than he had\r\nbeen for weeks past. Love, pleasure, and the rest were gone; and faith\r\nin woman. But if he could be sure of gaining a seat in the next\r\nParliament, the way might be longer than he had hoped, it might be more\r\ntoilsome and more dusty: but in the end he would arrive at the Treasury\r\nBench.\r\n\r\nHe little thought, alas, that the effort on which he hugged himself was\r\nto prove a source of misfortunes. But so it was. His maiden speech had\r\nattracted neither notice nor envy. But those few sentences, short and\r\nsimple as they were, by drawing an answer from the leader of the\r\nOpposition, had gained both for him. Within five minutes a score of\r\nmembers had asked “Who is he?” and another score had detailed the\r\ncircumstances of his election for Chippinge. He had gone down to vote\r\nfor his cousin, in his cousin’s borough, family vote and the rest; so\r\nthe story ran. Then, finding on the morning of the polling that if he\r\nthrew over his cousin, he might gain the seat for himself, he had\r\nturned his coat in a—well, in a very dubious manner, snatched the seat,\r\nand—here he was!\r\n\r\nIn a word, it was the version of the facts which he had once dreaded,\r\nand about which he had afterwards ceased to trouble himself.\r\n\r\nThere were, perhaps, half a dozen persons in the House who knew the\r\nfacts, and knew that the young man had professed from the first the\r\nopinions which he was now supporting. But there was just so much truth\r\nin the version, garbled as it was, just so much _vraisemblance_ in the\r\ntale that even those who knew the facts, could not wholly contradict\r\nit. The story did not come to Wetherell’s ears; or he, for certain,\r\nwould have gainsaid it. But it did come to Wathen’s. Now the Sergeant\r\nwas capable of spite, and he had not forgotten the manner after which\r\nVaughan had flouted him at Chippinge; his defence—if a defence it could\r\nbe called—was accompanied by so many nods and shrugs, that persons less\r\nprejudiced than Tories, embittered by defeat, and wounded by\r\npersonalities, might have been forgiven, if they went from the Sergeant\r\nwith a lower opinion of our friend than before.\r\n\r\nFrom that day Vaughan, though he knew nothing of it, and though no one\r\nspoke to him of it, was a marked man in the eyes of the opposite party.\r\nThey regarded him as a renegade; while his own side were not\r\noveranxious to make his cause their own. The May elections had been\r\ncontested with more spirit and less scruple than any elections within\r\nliving memory; and many things had been done and many said, of which\r\nhonourable men were not proud. Still it was acknowledged that such\r\nthings must be done—here and there—and even that the doers must not be\r\nrepudiated. But it was felt that the party was not required to grapple\r\nthe latter to its breast with hooks of steel. Rumour had it that Lord\r\nLansdowne felt himself to blame; and that the offender had been\r\ndisinherited by his cousin was asserted. The man would be of no great\r\nimportance, therefore, in the future; and if he did not make a second\r\nappearance in Parliament, the loss in the end would be small. Not a few\r\nsummed up the matter in that way.\r\n\r\nIf Vaughan had been intimate with anyone in the House he would have\r\nlearned what was afoot; and he might have taken steps to set himself\r\nright. But he had lived little of his life in London, he had but made\r\nhis bow to Society; of late, also, he had been too sore to make new\r\nfriends. Of course he had acquaintances, every man has acquaintances.\r\nBut no one in political circles knew him well enough to think it worth\r\nwhile to put him on his guard.\r\n\r\nUnluckily, the next occasion which brought him to his feet, was of a\r\nkind to give point to the feeling against him. On a certain Thursday,\r\nSergeant Wathen moved that the Borough of Chippinge be removed from\r\nSchedule A, to Schedule B—his object being that it might retain one\r\nmember; and Vaughan, thinking the opening favourable, rose, intending\r\nto make a few remarks in a strain to which the House, proverbially fond\r\nof a personal explanation, is prone to listen with indulgence. For the\r\nmotion itself, he had not much hope that it would be carried: in a\r\ndozen other cases, a similar motion had failed.\r\n\r\n“It can only be,” he began—and this time the sound of his voice did not\r\nperturb him—“from a strict sense of duty, Mr. Bernal, it cannot be\r\nwithout pain that any Member—and I say this not on my account only, but\r\non behalf of many Honourable Members of this House——”\r\n\r\n“No! No! Leave us out.”\r\n\r\nThe words were uttered so loudly and so rudely that they silenced him;\r\nand he looked in the direction whence they came. At once cries of “No,\r\nno! Divide! No! No!” poured on him from all parts of the House,\r\naccompanied by a dropping fire of catcalls and cockcrows. He lost the\r\nthread of his remarks, and for a moment stood abashed and confounded.\r\nThe Chairman did not interfere and for an instant it looked as if the\r\nyoung speaker would be compelled to sit down.\r\n\r\nBut he recovered himself, gaining courage from the very vigour with\r\nwhich he was attacked; and which seemed out of proportion to his\r\nimportance. The moment a lull in the fire of interruption occurred, he\r\nspoke in a louder voice.\r\n\r\n“I say, sir,” he proceeded, looking about him courageously, “that it is\r\nonly with pain, only under the _force majeure_ of a love of their\r\ncountry, that any Member can support the deletion from the Borough Roll\r\nof this House, of that Constituency which has honoured him with its\r\nconfidence.”\r\n\r\n“Divide! Divide!” roared many on both sides of the House. For the\r\nTories were uncertain on which side he was speaking.\r\n“Cock-a-doodle-doo-doo-doo!”\r\n\r\nBut this fresh burst of disapproval found him better prepared. Firmly,\r\nthough the beads of perspiration stood on his brow, he persisted. “And\r\nif,” he continued, “in the case which appeals so nearly to himself an\r\nHonourable Member sees that the standard which justifies the survival\r\nof a representative can be reached, with what gratification, sir,\r\nwhether he sits on this side of the House or on that——”\r\n\r\n“No! No! Leave us out!” in a roar of sound. And “Divide! Divide!”\r\n\r\n“Or on that,” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“Divide! Divide!”\r\n\r\n“Must he not press its claims and support its interests?” he persisted\r\ngallantly. “Ay, sir, welcome in the event of success a decision at once\r\njust, and of so much advantage, I will not say to himself——”\r\n\r\n“It never will be to you!” shrieked a voice from the darker corner\r\nunder the opposite gallery.\r\n\r\nThe shaft went home. He faltered. A roar of laughter drowned his last\r\nwords, and he sat down with a burning face; in some confusion, but in\r\ngreater perplexity. Had he transgressed, he wondered ruefully, some\r\nunwritten law of the House! Had he offended in ignorance, and persisted\r\nin his offence? Should he not, though Wathen had spoken, have spoken in\r\nhis own case? In a matter so nearly touching himself?\r\n\r\nHe spoke to the Member who chanced to sit next him. “What was it?” he\r\nasked humbly. “Did I do something wrong?”\r\n\r\nThe man glanced at him coldly. “Oh, no,” he said. And he shrugged his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“But——”\r\n\r\n“On the contrary, I fancy you’ve to congratulate yourself,” with a\r\nsneer so faint that Vaughan did not perceive it. “I understand that\r\nwe’re to do as we like on this—and they know it on the other side. Eh?\r\nYes, there’s the division. I think,” he added with the same faint\r\nsneer, “you’ll save your seat.”\r\n\r\n“By Jove!” Vaughan exclaimed. “You don’t say so!”\r\n\r\nHe could hardly believe it. But so it turned out. And so great was the\r\nboon—the greater as no other borough was transferred in Committee—that\r\nit swept away for the time the memory of what had happened. His eyes\r\nsparkled. The seat saved, it was odd if with the wider electorate\r\ncreated by the Bill, he was not sure of return! Still more odd, if he\r\nwas not sure of beating Wathen—he, who had opened the borough and been\r\nreturned by the Whig interest even while it was closed! No longer need\r\nhe feel so anxious and despondent when the Dissolution, which must\r\nfollow the passage of the Bill, rose to his mind. No longer need he be\r\nin so great a hurry to make his mark, so envious of Mr. Macaulay, so\r\njealous of Mr. Sadler.\r\n\r\nCertainly as far as his political career was in question the horizon\r\nwas clearing. If only other things had been as favourable! If only\r\nthere had been someone, were it in a cottage at Hammersmith or in a\r\ndull street off Bloomsbury Square, to whom he might take home this\r\npiece of news; certain that other eyes would sparkle more brightly than\r\nhis, and another heart beat quick with joy!\r\n\r\nThat could not be. There was an end of that. And his face settled back\r\ninto its gloom. Still he was less unhappy. The certainty of a seat in\r\nthe next Parliament was a great point gained! A great point to the\r\ngood!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV\r\nA RIGHT AND LEFT\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anything was certain in a political world so changed, it was certain\r\nthat if the Reform Bill passed the Lords—in the teeth of those plaguy\r\nBishops of whose opposition so much was heard—a Dissolution would\r\nimmediately follow. To not a few of the members this contingency was a\r\nspectre, ever present, seated at bed and board, and able to defy the\r\nrules even of Almack’s and Crockford’s. For how could a gentleman, who\r\nhad just given five thousand pounds for his seat, contemplate with\r\nequanimity a notice to quit, so rude and so premature? And worse, a\r\nnotice to quit which meant extrusion into a world in which seats at\r\nfive thousand for a Parliament would be few and far between; and fair\r\nagreements to pay a thousand a year while the privilege lasted, would\r\nbe unknown!\r\n\r\nMany a member asked loudly and querulously, “What will happen to the\r\ncountry if the Bill pass?” But more asked themselves in their hearts,\r\nand more often and more querulously, “What will happen to me if the\r\nBill pass? How shall I fare at the hands of these new constituencies,\r\nwhich, unwelcome as a gipsy’s brats, I am forced to bring into the\r\nworld?”\r\n\r\nHitherto few on his own side of the House, and not many on the Tory\r\nside, had regarded a Dissolution with more misgiving than Arthur\r\nVaughan. The borough for which he sat lay under doom; and he saw no\r\nopening elsewhere. He had no longer the germs of influence nor great\r\nprospects: nor yet such a fortune as justified him in an appeal to one\r\nof the new and populous boroughs. It was a pleasant thing to go in and\r\nout by the door of the privileged, to take his chop at Bellamy’s, to\r\nlounge in the dignified seclusion of the library, or to air his new\r\nhonours in Westminster Hall; pleasant also to have that sensation of\r\nliving at the hub of things, to receive whips, to give franks, to feel\r\nthat the ladder of ambition was open to him. But he knew that an\r\nexperience of the House counted by months did no man good; and the\r\nprospect of losing his plumes and going forth again a common biped, was\r\nthe more painful to him because his all was embarked in the venture. He\r\nmight, indeed, fall back on the bar; but with half a heart and the\r\nreputation of a man who had tried to fly before he could walk.\r\n\r\nHis relief, therefore, when Chippinge, alone of all the Boroughs in\r\nSchedule A, was removed in Committee to Schedule B, may be imagined.\r\nThe road before him was once more open, while the exceptional nature of\r\nhis luck almost persuaded him that he was reserved for greatness. True,\r\nSergeant Wathen might pride himself on the same fact; but at the\r\nthought Vaughan smiled. The Sergeant and Sir Robert would find it a\r\ntrifle harder, he thought, to deal with the hundred-and-odd voters whom\r\nthe Act enfranchised, than with the old Cripples! And very, very\r\nungrateful would those hundred-and-odd be, if they did not vote for the\r\nman who had made their cause his own!\r\n\r\nA load, indeed, was lifted from his mind, and for some days his relief\r\ncould be read in the lightness of his step, and the returning gaiety of\r\nhis eyes. He knew nothing of the things which were being whispered\r\nabout him. And though he had cause to fancy that he was not _persona\r\ngrata_ on his own benches, he thought sufficiently well of himself to\r\nset this down to jealousy. There is a stage in the life of a rising man\r\nwhen many hands are against him; and those most cruelly which will\r\npresently applaud him most loudly. He flattered himself that he had set\r\na foot on the ladder: and while he waited for an opportunity to raise\r\nhimself another step, he came as near to a kind of feverish happiness\r\nas thoughts of Mary, ever recurring when he was alone, would permit.\r\nFor the time the loss of his prospects ceased to trouble him seriously.\r\nHe lived less in his rooms, more among men. He was less crabbed, less\r\nmoody. And so the weeks wore away in Committee, and a day or two after\r\nthe Coronation, the Bill came on for the third reading.\r\n\r\nThe House was utterly weary. The leaders on both sides were reserving\r\ntheir strength for the final debate, and Vaughan had some hope that he\r\nmight find an opening to speak with effect. With this in his mind he\r\nwas on his way across the Park about three in the afternoon, conning\r\nhis peroration, when a hand was clapped on his shoulder, and he turned\r\nto find himself face to face with Flixton.\r\n\r\nSo much had happened since they stood together on the hustings at\r\nChippinge, Vaughan’s fortunes had changed so greatly since they had\r\nparted in anger in Queen’s Square, that he, at any rate, had no thought\r\nof bearing malice. To Flixton’s “Well, my hearty, you’re a neat artist,\r\nain’t you? Going to the House, I take it?” he gave a cordial answer.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said. “That’s it.”\r\n\r\n“Bringing ruination on the country, eh?” Flixton continued. And he\r\npassed his arm through Vaughan’s, and walked on with him. “That’s the\r\nticket?”\r\n\r\n“Some say so, but I hope not.”\r\n\r\n“Hope’s a cock that won’t fight, my boy!” the Honourable Bob rejoined.\r\n“Fact is, you’re doing your best, only the House of Lords is in the\r\nway, and won’t let you! They’ll pull you up sweetly by and by, see if\r\nthey don’t!”\r\n\r\n“And what will the country say to that?” Vaughan rejoined\r\ngood-humouredly.\r\n\r\n“Country be d——d! That’s what all your chaps are saying. And I tell you\r\nwhat! That book-in-breeches man—what do you call him—Macaulay?—ought to\r\nbe pulled up! He ought indeed! I read one of his farragoes the other\r\nday and it was full of nothing but ‘Think long, I beg, before you\r\nthwart the public will!’ and ‘The might of an angered people!’ and ‘Let\r\nus beware of rousing!’ and all that rubbish! Meaning, my boy, only he\r\ndidn’t dare to say it straight out, that if the Lords did not give way\r\nto you chaps, there’d be a revolution; and the deuce to pay! And I say\r\nhe ought to be in the dock. He’s as bad as old Brereton down in\r\nBristol, predicting fire and flames and all the rest of it.”\r\n\r\n“But you cannot deny, Flixton,” Vaughan answered soberly, “that the\r\ncountry is excited as we have never known it excited before? And that a\r\nrising is not impossible!”\r\n\r\n“A rising! I wish we could see one! That’s just what we want,” the\r\nHonourable Bob answered, stopping and bringing his companion to a\r\nsudden stand also. “Eh? Who was that old Roman—Poppæa, or some name\r\nlike that, who said he wished the people had all one head that he might\r\ncut it off?” suiting the action to the word with his cane. “A rising,\r\nbegad? The sooner the better! The old Fourteenth would know how to deal\r\nwith it!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” Vaughan answered, “that you would be so confident if\r\nyou were once face to face with it!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, come! Don’t talk nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“Well, but——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know all that! But I say, old chap,” he continued, changing his\r\ntone, and descending abruptly from the political to the personal\r\nsituation, “You’ve played your cards badly, haven’t you? Eh?”\r\n\r\nVaughan fancied that he referred to Mary; or at best to his quarrel\r\nwith Sir Robert. And he froze visibly, “I won’t discuss that,” he said\r\nin a different tone. And he moved on again.\r\n\r\n“But I was there the evening you had the row!”\r\n\r\n“At Stapylton?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Well?” stiffly.\r\n\r\n“And, lord, man, why didn’t you sing a bit small? And the old gentleman\r\nwould have come round in no time!”\r\n\r\nVaughan halted, with anger in his face. “I won’t discuss it!” he said\r\nwith something of violence in his tone.\r\n\r\n“Very well, very well!” Flixton answered with the superabundant\r\npatience of the man whose withers are not wrung. “But when you did get\r\nyour seat—why didn’t you come to terms with someone?” with a wink. “As\r\nit is, what’s the good of being in the House three months, or six\r\nmonths—and out again?”\r\n\r\nVaughan wished most heartily that he had not met the Honourable Bob;\r\nwho, he remembered, had always possessed, hearty and jovial as he\r\nseemed, a most remarkable knack of rubbing him the wrong way. “How do\r\nyou know?” he asked with a touch of contempt—was he, a rising Member of\r\nParliament to be scolded after this fashion?—“How do you know that I\r\nshall be out?”\r\n\r\n“You’ll be out, if it’s Chippinge you are looking to!”\r\n\r\n“Why, if you please, my friend? Why so sure?”\r\n\r\nFlixton winked with deeper meaning than before. “Ah, that’s telling,”\r\nhe said. “Still—why not? If you don’t hear it from me, old chap, you’ll\r\nsoon hear it from someone. Why, you ask? Well, because a little bird\r\nwhispered to me that Chippinge was—arranged! That Sir Robert and the\r\nWhigs understood one another, and whichever way it went it would not\r\ncome your way!”\r\n\r\nVaughan reddened deeply. “I don’t believe it,” he said bluntly.\r\n\r\n“Did you know that Chippinge was going to be spared?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“They didn’t tell you?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” shrugging his shoulders, with a world of meaning, and preparing\r\nto turn away. “Well, other people did, and there it is. I may be wrong,\r\nI hope I am, old chap. Hope I am! But anyway—I must be going. I turn\r\nhere. See you soon, I hope!”\r\n\r\nAnd with a wave of the hand the Honourable Bob marched off through\r\nWhitehall, his face breaking into a mischievous grin as soon as he was\r\nout of Vaughan’s sight. “Return hit for your snub, Miss Mary!” he\r\nmuttered. “If you prick me, at least I can prick him! And do him good,\r\ntoo! He was always a most confounded prig.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Vaughan, freed from his companion, was striding on past\r\nDowning Street; the old street, long swept away, in which Walpole\r\nlived, and to which the dying Chatham was carried. And unconsciously,\r\nunder the spur of his angry thoughts, he quickened his pace. It was\r\nincredible, it was inconceivable that so monstrous an injustice had\r\nbeen planned, or could be perpetrated. He, who had stepped into the\r\nbreach, well-nigh in his own despite, he, who had refused, so\r\nscrupulous had he been, to stand on a first invitation, he, who had\r\nbeen elected almost against his will, was, for all thanks, to be set\r\naside, and by his friends! By those whose unsolicited act it had been\r\nto return him and to put him into this position! It was impossible, he\r\ntold himself. It was unthinkable! Were this true, were this a fact, the\r\nmeanness of political life had reached its apogee! The faithlessness of\r\nthe Whigs, their incredible treachery to their dependants, could need\r\nno other exemplar!\r\n\r\n“I’ll not bear it! By Heaven, I’ll not bear it!” he muttered. And as he\r\nspoke, striding along in the hurry of his spirits as if he carried a\r\nbroom and swept the whole Whig party before him, he overtook no less a\r\nperson than Sergeant Wathen, who had been lunching at the Athenæum.\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant heard his voice and turning, saw who it was. He fancied\r\nthat Vaughan had addressed him. “I beg your pardon,” he said politely.\r\n“I did not catch what you said, Mr. Vaughan.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Vaughan glowered at him, as if he would sweep him from his\r\npath, along with the Whigs. Then out of the fullness of the heart the\r\nmouth spoke. “Mr. Sergeant,” he said, in a not very friendly tone, “do\r\nyou know anything of an agreement disposing of the future\r\nrepresentation of Chippinge?”\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant who knew all under the rose, looked shrewdly at his\r\ncompanion to see, if possible, what he knew. And, to gain time, “I beg\r\nyour pardon,” he said. “I don’t think I—quite understand you.”\r\n\r\n“I am told,” Vaughan said haughtily, “that an agreement has been made\r\nto avoid a contest at Chippinge.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean,” the Sergeant asked blandly, “at the next election, Mr.\r\nVaughan?”\r\n\r\n“At future elections!”\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant shrugged his shoulders. “As a member,” he said primly, “I\r\ntake care to know nothing of such agreements. And I would recommend\r\nyou, Mr. Vaughan, to adopt that rule. For the rest,” he added, with a\r\ncandid smile, “I give you fair warning that I shall contest the seat.\r\nMay I ask who was your informant?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Flixton.”\r\n\r\n“Flixton? Flixton? Ah! The gentleman who is to marry Miss Vermuyden!\r\nWell, I can only repeat that I, at any rate, am no party to such an\r\nagreement.”\r\n\r\nHis sly look which seemed to deride his companion’s inexperience, said\r\nas plainly as a look could say, “You find the game of politics less\r\nsimple than you thought?” And at another time it would have increased\r\nVaughan’s ire. But as one pellet drives out another, the Sergeant’s\r\nreference to Miss Vermuyden had in a second driven the prime subject\r\nfrom his mind. He did not speak for a moment. Then with his face\r\naverted, “Is Mr. Flixton—going to marry Miss Vermuyden?” he asked, in a\r\nmuffled tone. “I had not heard of it.”\r\n\r\n“I only heard it yesterday,” the Sergeant answered, not unwilling to\r\nshelve the other topic. “But it is rumoured, and I believe it is true.\r\nQuite a romance, wasn’t it?” he continued airily. “Quite a nine days’\r\nwonder! But”—he pulled himself up—“I beg your pardon! I was forgetting\r\nhow nearly it concerned you. Dear me, dear me! It is a fair wind indeed\r\nthat blows no one any harm!”\r\n\r\nVaughan made no reply. He could not speak for the hard beating of his\r\nheart. Wathen saw that there was something wrong and looked at him\r\ninquisitively. But the Sergeant had not the clue, and could only\r\nsuspect that the marriage touched the other, because issue of it would\r\nentirely bar his succession. And no more was said. As they crossed New\r\nPalace Yard, a member drew the Sergeant aside, and Vaughan went up\r\nalone to the lobby.\r\n\r\nBut all thought of speaking was flown from his mind; nor did the\r\nthinness of the House when he entered tempt him. There were hardly more\r\nthan a hundred present; and these were lolling here and there with\r\ntheir hats on, half asleep it seemed, in the dull light of a September\r\nafternoon. A dozen others looked sleepily from the galleries, their\r\narms flattened on the rail, their chins on their arms. There were a\r\ncouple of ministers on the Treasury Bench, and Lord John Russell was\r\nmoving the third reading. No one seemed to take much interest in the\r\nmatter; a stranger entering at the moment would have learned with\r\namazement that this was the mother of parliaments, the renowned House\r\nof Commons; and with still greater amazement would he have learned that\r\nthe small, boyish-looking gentleman in the high-collared coat, and with\r\nlips moulded on Cupid’s bow, who appeared to be making some perfunctory\r\nremarks upon the weather, or the state of the crops, was really\r\nadvancing by an important stage the famous Bill, which had convulsed\r\nthree kingdoms and was destined to change the political face of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nLord John sat down presently, thrusting his head at once into a packet\r\nof papers, which the gloom hardly permitted him to read. A clerk at the\r\ntable mumbled something; and a gentleman on the other side of the House\r\nrose and began to speak. He had not uttered many sentences, however,\r\nbefore the members on the Reform benches awoke, not only to life, but\r\nto fury. Stentorian shouts of “Divide! Divide!” rendered the speaker\r\ninaudible; and after looking towards the door of the House more than\r\nonce he sat down, and the House went to a division. In a few minutes it\r\nwas known that the Bill had been read a third time, by 113 to 58.\r\n\r\nBut the foreign gentleman would have made a great mistake had he gone\r\naway, supposing that Lord John’s few placid words—and not those\r\nspiteful shouts—represented the feelings of the House. In truth the\r\nfiercest passions were at work under the surface. Among the fifty-eight\r\nwho shrugged their shoulders and accepted the verdict in gloomy silence\r\nwere some primed with the fiercest invective; and others, tongue-tied\r\nmen, who nevertheless honestly believed that Lord John Russell was a\r\nrepublican, and Althorp a fool; who were certain that the Whigs\r\nwittingly or unwittingly were working the destruction of the country,\r\nwere dragging her from the pride of place to which a nicely-balanced\r\nConstitution had raised her, and laying her choicest traditions at the\r\nfeet of the rabble. Men who believed such things, and saw the deed done\r\nbefore their eyes, might accept their doom in silence—even as the King\r\nof old went silently to the Banquet Hall hard by—but not with joy or\r\neasy hearts!\r\n\r\nVaughan, therefore, was not the only one who walked into the lobby that\r\nevening, brooding darkly on his revenge. Yet, even he behaved himself\r\nas men, so bred, so trained do behave themselves. He held his peace.\r\nAnd no one dreamed, not even Orator Hunt, who sat not far from him\r\nunder the shadow of his White Hat, that this well-conducted young\r\ngentleman was revolving thoughts of the Social Order, and of the Party\r\nSystem, and of most things which the Church Catechism commends, beside\r\nwhich that terrible Radical’s own opinions were mere Tory prejudices.\r\nThe fickleness of women! The treachery of men! Oh, Aetna bury them! Oh,\r\nOcean overwhelm them! Let all cease together and be no more! But give\r\nme sweet, oh, sweet, oh, sweet Revenge!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV\r\nAT STAPYLTON\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about a week before his encounter with Vaughan in the park—and\r\non a fine autumn day—that the Honourable Bob, walking with Sir Robert\r\nby the Garden Pool, allowed his eyes to travel over the prospect. The\r\nsmooth-shaven lawns, the stately, lichened house, the far-stretching\r\npark, with its beech-knolls and slopes of verdure, he found all fair;\r\nand when to these, when to the picture on which his bodily eyes rested,\r\nthat portrait of Mary—Mary, in white muslin and blue ribbons, bowing\r\nher graceful head while Sir Robert read prayers—which he carried in his\r\nmemory, he told himself that he was an uncommonly happy fellow.\r\n\r\nBeauty he might have had, wealth he might have had, family too. But to\r\nalight on all in such perfection, to lose his heart where his head\r\napproved the step, was a gift of fortune so rare, that as he strutted\r\nand talked by the side of his host, his face beamed with ineffable\r\ngood-humour.\r\n\r\nNevertheless for a few moments silence had fallen between the two; and\r\ngradually Sir Robert’s face had assumed a grave and melancholy look. He\r\nsighed more than once, and when he spoke, it was to repeat in different\r\nwords what he had already said.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, you may speak,” he said, in a tone of some formality. “And\r\nI have little doubt, Mr. Flixton, that your overtures will be received\r\nas they deserve.”\r\n\r\n“Yes? Yes? You think so?” Flixton answered with manifest delight. “You\r\nreally think so, Sir Robert, do you?”\r\n\r\n“I think so,” his host replied. “Not only because your suit is in every\r\nway eligible, and one which does us honour.” He bowed courteously as he\r\nuttered the compliment. “But because, Mr. Flixton, for docility—and I\r\nthink a husband may congratulate himself on the fact——”\r\n\r\n“To be sure! To be sure!” Flixton cried, not permitting him to finish.\r\n“Yes, Sir Robert, capital! You mean that if I am not a happy man——”\r\n\r\n“It will not be the fault of your wife,” Sir Robert said; remembering\r\nwith a faint twinge of conscience that the Honourable Bob’s past had\r\nnot been without its histories.\r\n\r\n“No! By gad, Sir Robert, no! You’re quite right! She’s got an ank——” He\r\nstopped abruptly, his mouth open; bethinking himself, when it was\r\nalmost too late, that her father was not the person to whom to detail\r\nher personal charms.\r\n\r\nBut Sir Robert had not divined the end of the sentence. He was a trifle\r\ndeaf. “Yes?” he said.\r\n\r\n“She’s an—an—animated manner, I was going to say,” Flixton answered\r\nwith more readiness than fervour. And he blessed himself for his\r\npresence of mind.\r\n\r\n“Animated? Yes, but gentle also,” Sir Robert replied, well-nigh purring\r\nas he did so. “I should say that gentleness, and—and indeed, my dear\r\nfellow, goodness, were the—but perhaps I am saying more than I should.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all!” Flixton answered with heartiness. “Gad, I could listen to\r\nyou all day, Sir Robert.”\r\n\r\nHe had listened, indeed, during a large part of the last week; and with\r\nso much effect, that those histories to which reference has been made,\r\nhad almost faded from the elder man’s mind. Flixton seemed to him a\r\nhearty, manly young fellow, a little boastful and self-assertive\r\nperhaps—but remarkably sound. A soldier, who asked nothing better than\r\nto put down the rabble rout which was troubling the country; a Tory, of\r\nprecisely his, Sir Robert’s opinions; the younger son of a peer, and a\r\nWest Country peer to boot. In fine, a staunch, open-air patrician, with\r\ngood old-fashioned instincts, and none of that intellectual conceit,\r\nnone of those cranks, and fads, and follies, which had ruined a man who\r\nalso might have been Sir Robert’s son-in-law.\r\n\r\nWell that man, Sir Robert, perhaps because his conscience pricked him\r\nat times by suggesting impossible doubts, was still bitterly angry. So\r\nangry that, had the Baronet been candid, he must have acknowledged that\r\nthe Honourable Bob’s main virtue was his unlikeness to Arthur Vaughan;\r\nit was in proportion as he differed from the young fellow who had so\r\nmeanly intrigued to gain his daughter’s affections, that Flixton\r\nappeared desirable to the father. Even those histories proved that at\r\nany rate he had blood in him; while his loud good-nature, his\r\npositiveness, as long as it marched with Sir Robert’s positiveness, his\r\nshort views, all gained by contrast. “I am glad he is a younger son,”\r\nthe Baronet thought. “He shall take the old Vermuyden name!” And he\r\nlifted his handsome old chin a little higher as he pictured the\r\nhonours, that even in a changed and worsened England, might cluster\r\nabout his house. At the worst, and if the Bill passed, he had a seat\r\nalternately with the Lansdownes; and in a future, which would know\r\nnothing of Lord Lonsdale’s cat-o’-nine-tails, when pocket boroughs\r\nwould be rare, and great peers and landowners would be left with scarce\r\na representative, much might be done with half a seat.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, “Damme, Sir Robert,” Flixton cried, “there is the little\r\nbeauty—hem!—there she is, I think. With your permission I think I’ll\r\njoin her.”\r\n\r\n“By all means, by all means,” Sir Robert answered indulgently. “You\r\nneed not stand on ceremony.”\r\n\r\nFlixton waited for no more. Perhaps he had no mind to be bored, now\r\nthat he had gained what he wanted. He hurried after the slim figure\r\nwith the white floating skirts and the Leghorn hat, which had descended\r\nthe steps of the house, moved lightly across the lawns—and vanished. He\r\nguessed, however, whither she was bound. He knew that she had a liking\r\nfor walking in the wilderness behind the house; a beech wood which was\r\nalready beginning to put on its autumn glory. And sure enough,\r\nhastening to a point among the smooth grey trunks where three paths\r\nmet, he discerned her a hundred paces away, walking slowly from him\r\nwith her eyes raised.\r\n\r\n“Squirrels!” Flixton thought. And he made up his mind to bring the\r\nterriers and have a hunt on the following Sunday afternoon. In the\r\nmeantime he had another quarry in view, and he made after the\r\nwhite-gowned figure.\r\n\r\nShe heard his tread on the carpet of dry beech leaves, and she turned\r\nand saw him. She had come out on purpose that she might be alone, at\r\nliberty to think at her ease and orientate herself, in relation to her\r\nnew environment, and the fresh and astonishing views which were\r\ncontinually opening before her. Or, perhaps, that was but her pretext:\r\nan easy explanation of silence and solitude, which might suffice for\r\nher father and possibly for Miss Sibson. For, for certain, amid sombre\r\nthoughts of her mother, she thought more often and more sombrely in\r\nthese days of another; of happiness which had been forfeited by her own\r\nact; of weakness, and cowardice, and ingratitude; of a man’s head that\r\nstooped to her adorably, and then again of a man’s eyes that burned her\r\nwith contempt.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, therefore, that she was not overjoyed when she saw Mr.\r\nFlixton. But Sir Robert was so far right in his estimate of her nature\r\nthat she hated to give pain. It was there, perhaps, that she was weak.\r\nAnd so, seeing the Honourable Bob, she smiled pleasantly on him.\r\n\r\n“You have discovered a favourite haunt of mine,” she said. She did not\r\nadd that she spent a few minutes of every day there: that the smooth\r\nbeech-trunks knew the touch of her burning cheeks, and the rustle of\r\nthe falling leaves the whisper of her penitence. Daily she returned by\r\nway of the Kennel Path and there breathed a prayer for her mother,\r\nwhere a mother’s arms had first enfolded her, and a mother’s kisses won\r\nher love. What she did add was, “I often come here.”\r\n\r\n“I know you do,” the Honourable Bob answered, with a look of\r\nadmiration. “I assure you, Miss Mary, I could astonish you with the\r\nthings I know about you!”\r\n\r\n“Really!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes. Really.”\r\n\r\nThere was a significant chuckle in his voice which brought the blood to\r\nher check. But she was determined to ignore its meaning. “You are\r\nobservant?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Of those—yes, by Jove, I am—of those, I—admire,” he rejoined. He had\r\nit on his tongue to say “those I love,” but she turned her eyes on him\r\nat the critical moment, and though he was doing a thing he had often\r\ndone, and he had impudence enough, his tongue failed him. There are\r\nwomen so naturally modest that until the one man who awakens the heart\r\nappears, it seems an outrage to speak to them of love. Mary Vermuyden,\r\nperhaps by reason of her bringing up, was one of these; and though\r\nFlixton had had little to do with women of her kind, he recognised the\r\nfact and bowed to it. He came, having her father’s leave to speak to\r\nher; yet he found himself less at his ease, than on many a less\r\nlegitimate occasion. “Yes, by Jove,” he repeated. “I observe them, I\r\ncan tell you.”\r\n\r\nMary laughed. “Some are more quick to notice than others,” she said.\r\n\r\n“And to notice some than others!” he rejoined, gallantly. “That is what\r\nI mean. Now that old girl who is with you——”\r\n\r\n“Miss Sibson?” Mary said, setting him right with some stiffness.\r\n\r\n“Yes! Well, she isn’t young! Anyway, you don’t suppose I could say what\r\nshe wore yesterday! But what you wore, Miss Mary”—trying to catch her\r\neye and ogle her—“ah, couldn’t I! But then you don’t wear powder on\r\nyour nose, nor need it!”\r\n\r\n“I don’t wear it,” she said, laughing in spite of herself. “But you\r\ndon’t know what I may do some day! And for Miss Sibson, it does not\r\nmatter, Mr. Flixton, what she wears. She has one of the kindest hearts,\r\nand was one of the kindest friends I had—or could have had—when things\r\nwere different with me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, good old girl,” he rejoined, “but snubby! Bitten my nose off\r\ntwo or three times, I know. And, come now, not quite an angel, you\r\nknow, Miss Mary!”\r\n\r\n“Well,” she replied, smiling, “she is not, perhaps, an angel to look\r\nat. But——”\r\n\r\n“She can’t be! For she is not like you!” he cried. “And you are one,\r\nMiss Mary! You are the angel for me!” looking at her with impassioned\r\neyes. “I’ll never want another nor ask to see one!”\r\n\r\nHis look frightened her; she began to think he meant—something. And she\r\ntook a new way with him. “How singular it is,” she said, thoughtfully,\r\n“that people say those things in society! Because they sound so very\r\nsilly to one who has not lived in your world!”\r\n\r\n“Silly!” Flixton replied, in a tone of mortification; and for a moment\r\nhe felt the check. He was really in love, to a moderate extent; and on\r\nthe way to be more deeply in love were he thwarted. Therefore he was,\r\nto a moderate extent, afraid of her. And, “Silly?” he repeated. “Oh,\r\nbut I mean it, so help me! I do, indeed! It’s not silly to call you an\r\nangel, for I swear you are as beautiful as one! That’s true, anyway!”\r\n\r\n“How many have you seen?” she asked, ridiculing him. “And what coloured\r\nwings had they?” But her cheek was hot. “Don’t say, if you please,” she\r\ncontinued, before he could speak, “that you’ve seen me. Because that is\r\nonly saying over again what you’ve said, Mr. Flixton. And that is worse\r\nthan silly. It is dull.”\r\n\r\n“Miss Mary,” he cried, pathetically, “you don’t understand me! I want\r\nto assure you—I want to make you understand——”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” she said, cutting him short, in an earnest whisper. And,\r\nhalting, she extended a hand behind her to stay him. “Please don’t\r\nspeak!” she continued. “Do you see them, the beauties? Flying round and\r\nround the tree after one another faster than your eyes can follow them.\r\nOne, two, three—three squirrels! I never saw one, do you know, until I\r\ncame here,” she went on, in a tone of hushed rapture. “And until now I\r\nnever saw them at play. Oh, who could harm them?”\r\n\r\nHe stood behind her, biting his lip with vexation; and wholly untouched\r\nby the scene, which, whether her raptures were feigned or not, was\r\nwarrant for them. Hitherto he had had to do with women who met him\r\nhalfway; who bridled at a compliment, were alive to an _équivoque_, and\r\nknew how to simulate, if they did not feel, a soft confusion under his\r\ngaze. For this reason Mary’s backwardness, her apparent unconsciousness\r\nthat they were not friends of the same sex, puzzled him, nay, angered\r\nhim. As she stood before him, a hand still extended to check his\r\nadvance, the sunshine which filtered through the beech leaves cast a\r\nsoft radiance on her figure. She seemed more dainty, more graceful,\r\nmore virginal than aught that he had ever conceived. It was in vain\r\nthat he told himself, with irritation, that she was but a girl after\r\nall. That, under her aloofness, she was a woman like the others, as\r\nvain, passionate, flighty, as jealous as other women. He knew that he\r\nstood in awe of her. He knew that the words which he had uttered so\r\nlightly many a time—ay, and to those to whom he had no right to address\r\nthem—stuck in his throat now. He wanted to say “I love you!” and he had\r\nthe right to say it, he was commissioned to say it. Yet he was dumb.\r\nAll the boldness which he had exhibited in her presence in Queen’s\r\nSquare—where another had stood tongue-tied—was gone.\r\n\r\nHe took at last a desperate step. The girl was within arm’s reach of\r\nhim; her delicate waist, the creamy white of her slender neck, invited\r\nhim. Be she never so innocent, never so maidenly, a kiss, he told\r\nhimself, would awaken her. It was his experience, it was a scrap drawn\r\nfrom his store of worldly wisdom, that a woman kissed was a woman won.\r\n\r\nTrue, as he thought of it, his heart began to riot, as it had not\r\nrioted from that cause since he had kissed the tobacconist’s daughter\r\nat Exeter, his first essay in gallantry. But only the bold deserve the\r\nfair! And how often had he boasted that, where women were concerned,\r\nlips were made for other things than talking!\r\n\r\nAnd—in a moment it was done.\r\n\r\nTwice! Then she slipped from his grasp, and stood at bay, with flaming\r\nchecks and eyes that—that had certainly not ceased to be virginal.\r\n“You! You!” she cried, barely able to articulate. “Don’t touch me!”\r\n\r\nShe had been taken utterly, wholly by surprise; and the shock was\r\nimmensely increased by the facts of her bringing up and the restraints\r\nand conditions of school-life. In his grasp, with his breath on her\r\ncheek, all those notions about ravening wolves and the danger which\r\nattached to beauty in low places—notions no longer applicable, had she\r\ntaken time to reason—returned upon her in force. The man had kissed\r\nher!\r\n\r\n“How—-how dare you?” she continued, trembling with rage and\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n“But your father——”\r\n\r\n“How dare you——”\r\n\r\n“Your father sent me,” he pleaded, quite crestfallen. “He gave me\r\nleave——”\r\n\r\nShe stared at him, as at a madman. “To insult me?” she cried.\r\n\r\n“No, but—but you won’t understand!” he answered, almost querulously. He\r\nwas quite chapfallen. “You don’t listen to me. I want to marry you. I\r\nwant you to be my wife. Your father said I might come to you, and—and\r\nask you. And—and you’ll say ‘Yes,’ won’t you? That’s a good girl!”\r\n\r\n“Never!” she answered.\r\n\r\nHe stared at her, turning red. “Oh, nonsense!” he stammered. And he\r\nmade as if he would go nearer. “You don’t mean it. My dear girl! Listen\r\nto me! I do love you! I do indeed! And I—I tell you what it is, I never\r\nloved any woman——”\r\n\r\nBut she looked at him in such a way that he could not go on. “Do not\r\nsay those things!” she said. And her austerity was terrible to him.\r\n“And go, if you please. My father, if he sent you to me——”\r\n\r\n“He did!”\r\n\r\n“Then he did not,” she replied with dignity, “understand my feelings.”\r\n\r\n“But—but you must marry someone,” he complained. “You know—you’re\r\nmaking a great fuss about nothing!”\r\n\r\n“Nothing!” she cried, her eyes sparkling. “You insult me, Mr. Flixton,\r\nand——”\r\n\r\n“If a man may not kiss the girl he wants to marry——”\r\n\r\n“If she does not want to marry him?”\r\n\r\n“But it’s not as bad as that,” he pleaded. “No, by Jove, it’s not.\r\nYou’ll not be so cruel. Come, Miss Mary, listen to me a minute. You\r\nmust marry someone, you know. You are young, and I’m sure you have the\r\nright to choose——”\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard enough,” she struck in, interrupting him with something of\r\nSir Robert’s hauteur. “I understand now what you meant, and I forgive\r\nyou. But I can never be anything to you, Mr. Flixton——”\r\n\r\n“You can be everything to me,” he declared. It couldn’t, it really\r\ncouldn’t be that she meant to refuse him! Finally and altogether!\r\n\r\n“But you can be nothing to me!” she answered, cruelly—very cruelly for\r\nher, but her cheek was tingling. “Nothing! Nothing! And that being so,\r\nI beg that you will leave me now.”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with a mixture of supplication, resentment, chagrin.\r\n\r\nBut she showed no sign of relenting. “You really—you really do mean\r\nit?” he muttered, with a sickly smile. “Come, Miss Mary!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t! Don’t!” she cried, as if his words pained her. And that was\r\nall. “Please go! Or I shall go.”\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Bob’s conceit had been so far taken out of him that he\r\nfelt that he could make no farther fight. He could see no sign of\r\nrelenting, and feeling that, with all his experience, he had played his\r\ncards ill, he turned away sullenly. “Oh, I will go,” he said. And he\r\nlonged to add something witty and careless. But he could not add\r\nanything. He, Bob Flixton, the hero of so many _bonnes fortunes_, to be\r\nrefused! He had laid his all, and _pour le bon motif_ at the feet of a\r\ngirl who but yesterday was a little schoolmistress. And she had refused\r\nhim! It was incredible! But, alas, it was also fact.\r\n\r\nMary, the moment his back was turned, hurried with downcast face\r\ntowards the Kennels; to hide her hot cheeks and calm her feelings in\r\nthe depths of the shrubbery. Oddly enough, her first thoughts were less\r\nof that which had just happened to her than of that suit which had been\r\npaid to her months before. This man might love her or not; she could\r\nnot tell. But Arthur Vaughan had loved her: the fashion of this love\r\ntaught her to prize the fashion of that.\r\n\r\nHe had loved her. And if he had treated her as Mr. Flixton had treated\r\nher? Would she have held to him, she wondered. She believed that she\r\nwould. But the mere thought set her knees trembling, made her cheeks\r\nflame afresh, filled her with rapture. So that, shamefaced, frightened,\r\nglancing this way and that, as one hunted, she longed to be safe in her\r\nroom, there to cry at her ease.\r\n\r\nDoubtless it was natural that the incident should turn her thoughts to\r\nthat other love-making; and presently to her father’s furious dislike\r\nof that other lover. She could not understand that dislike; for the\r\nBill and the Borough, Franchise or No Franchise, were nothing to her.\r\nAnd the grievance, when Sir Robert had essayed to explain it, had been\r\nnothing. To her mind, Trafalgar and Waterloo and the greatness of\r\nEngland were the work of Nelson and Wellington—at the remotest,\r\nperhaps, of Mr. Pitt and Lord Castlereagh. She could not enter into the\r\nreasoning which attributed these and all other blessings of her country\r\nto a System! To a System which it seemed her lover was pledged to\r\noverthrow.\r\n\r\nShe walked until the tumult of her thoughts had somewhat abated; and\r\nthen, still yearning for the security of her own chamber, she made for\r\nthe house. She saw nothing of Flixton, no one was stirring. Already she\r\nthought herself safe; and it was the very spirit of mischief which\r\nbrought her, at the corner of the church, face to face with her father.\r\nSir Robert’s brow was clouded, and the “My dear, one moment,” with\r\nwhich he stayed her, was pitched in a more decisive tone than he\r\ncommonly used to her.\r\n\r\n“I wish to speak to you, Mary,” he continued. “Will you come with me to\r\nthe library?”\r\n\r\nShe would fain have postponed the discussion of Mr. Flixton’s proposal,\r\nwhich she foresaw. But her father, affectionate and gentle as he was,\r\nwas still unfamiliar; and she had not the courage to make her petition.\r\nSo she accompanied him, with a sinking heart, to the library. And, when\r\nhe pointed to a seat, she was glad to sit down.\r\n\r\nHe took up his own position on the hearth rug; whence he looked at her\r\ngravely before he spoke. At length:\r\n\r\n“My dear,” he said, “I’m sorry for this! Though I do not blame you. I\r\nthink that you do not understand, owing to those drawbacks of your\r\nearly life, which have otherwise, thank God, left so slight a mark upon\r\nyou, that there are things which at your time of life you must leave\r\nto—to the decision of your elders.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him. And there was not that complete docility in her look\r\nwhich he expected to find. “I don’t think I understand, sir,” she\r\nmurmured.\r\n\r\n“But you can easily understand this, Mary,” he replied. “That young\r\ngirls of your age, without experience of life or of—of the darker side\r\nof things, cannot be allowed to judge for themselves on all occasions.\r\nThere are sometimes circumstances to be weighed which it is not\r\npossible to detail to them.”\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes for an instant, to collect her thoughts.\r\n\r\n“But—but, sir,” she said, “you cannot wish me to have no will—no\r\nchoice—in a matter which affects me so nearly.”\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, speaking seriously and with something approaching\r\nsternness. “But that will and that choice must be guided. They should\r\nbe guided. Your feelings are natural—God forbid that I should think\r\nthem otherwise! But you must leave the decision to me.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, aghast. She had heard, but had never believed, that\r\nin the upper classes matches were arranged after this fashion. But to\r\nhave no will and no choice in such a thing as marriage! She must be\r\ndreaming.\r\n\r\n“You cannot,” he continued, looking at her firmly but not unkindly,\r\n“have either the knowledge of the past,” with a slight grimace, as of\r\npain, “or the experience needful to enable you to measure the result of\r\nthe step you take. You must, therefore, let your seniors decide for\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“But I could never—never,” she answered, with a deep blush, “marry a\r\nman without—liking him, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Marry?” Sir Robert repeated. He stared at her.\r\n\r\nShe returned the look. “I thought, sir,” she faltered, with a still\r\ndeeper blush, “that you were talking of that.”\r\n\r\n“My dear,” he said, gravely, “I am referring to the subject on which I\r\nunderstood that you requested Miss Sibson to speak to me.”\r\n\r\n“My mother?” she whispered, the colour fading quickly from her face.\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment. Then, “You would oblige me,” he said, slowly and\r\nformally, “by calling her Lady Sybil Vermuyden. And not—that.”\r\n\r\n“But she is—my mother,” she persisted.\r\n\r\nHe looked at her, his head slightly bowed, his lower lip thrust out.\r\n“Listen,” he said, with decision. “What you propose—to go to her, I\r\nmean—is impossible. Impossible, you understand. There must be an end of\r\nany thought of it!” His tone was cold, but not unkind. “The thing must\r\nnot be mentioned again, if you please,” he added.\r\n\r\nShe was silent a while. Then, “Why, sir?” she asked. She spoke\r\ntremulously, and with an effort. But he had not expected her to speak\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nYet he merely continued, as he stood on the hearth rug, to look at her\r\naskance. “That is for me,” he said, “to decide.”\r\n\r\n“But——”\r\n\r\n“But I will tell you,” he said, stiffly. “Because she has already\r\nruined part of your life!”\r\n\r\n“I forgive her, from my heart!” Mary cried.\r\n\r\n“And ruined, also,” he continued, putting the interruption aside, “a\r\ngreat part of mine. At your age I do not think fit to tell you—all. It\r\nis enough, that she has robbed me of you, and deceived me. Deceived\r\nme,” he repeated, more bitterly, “through long years when you, my\r\ndaughter, might have been my comfort and—” he ended, almost inaudibly,\r\n“my joy.”\r\n\r\nHe turned his back on her with the word and began to walk the room, his\r\nchin sunk on his breast, his hands clasped. It was clear to Mary,\r\nwatching him with loving, pitying eyes, that his thoughts were with the\r\nunhappy past, with the short fever, the ignoble contentions of his\r\nmarried life, or with the lonely, soured years which had followed. She\r\nfelt that he was laying to his wife’s charge the wreck of his life, and\r\nthe slow dry-rot which had sapped hope, and strength, and development.\r\n\r\nMary waited until his step trod the carpet less hurriedly. Then, as he\r\npaused to turn, she stepped forward.\r\n\r\n“Yet, sir—forgive her!” she cried. And there were warm tears in her\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nHe turned and looked at her. Possibly he was astonished at her\r\npersistence.\r\n\r\n“Never!” he said in a tone of finality. “Never! Let that be the end.”\r\n\r\nBut Mary had been dreaming of this moment for days. And she had\r\nresolved that, come what might, though he frown, though his tone grow\r\nhard and his eye angry, though he bring to bear on her the stern\r\ncommand of his eagle visage, she would not be found lacking a second\r\ntime. She would not again give way to her besetting weakness, and spend\r\nsleepless nights in futile remorse. Diffidence in the lonely\r\nschoolmistress had been pardonable, had been natural. But now, if she\r\nwere indeed sprung from those who had a right to hold their heads above\r\nthe crowd, if the doffed hats which greeted her when she went abroad,\r\nin the streets of Chippinge as well as in the lanes and roads,—if these\r\nmeant anything—shame on her if she proved craven.\r\n\r\n“It cannot be the end, sir,” she said, in a low voice. “For she\r\nis—still my mother. And she is alone and ill—and she needs me.”\r\n\r\nHe had begun to pace the room anew, this time with an impatient, angry\r\nstep. But at that he stood and faced her, and she needed all her\r\ncourage to support the gloom of his look. “How do you know?” he said.\r\nFor Miss Sibson, discharging an ungrateful task, had not entered into\r\ndetails. “Have you seen her?”\r\n\r\nShe felt that she must judge for herself; and though her mother had\r\nsaid something to the contrary, and hitherto she had obeyed her, she\r\nthought it best to tell all. “Yes, sir,” she said.\r\n\r\n“When?”\r\n\r\n“A fortnight ago?” She trembled under the growing darkness of his look.\r\n\r\n“Here?”\r\n\r\n“In the grounds, sir.”\r\n\r\n“And you never told me!” he cried. “You never told me!” he repeated,\r\nwith a strange glance, a glance which strove with terror to discern the\r\nmother’s features in the daughter’s face. “You, too—you, too, have\r\nbegun to deceive me!”\r\n\r\nAnd he threw up his hands in despair.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! no!” Mary cried, infinitely distressed.\r\n\r\n“But you have!” he rejoined. “You have kept this from me.”\r\n\r\n“Only, believe me, sir,” she cried, eagerly, “until I could find a\r\nfitting time.”\r\n\r\n“And now you want to go to her!” he answered, unheeding. “She has\r\nsuborned you! She, who has done the greatest wrong to you, has now done\r\nthe last wrong to me!”\r\n\r\nHe began again to pace up and down the room.\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! no!” she sobbed.\r\n\r\n“It is so!” he answered, darting an angry glance at her. “It is so! But\r\nI shall not let you go! Do you hear, girl? I shall not let you go! I\r\nhave suffered enough,” he continued, with a gesture which called those\r\nwalls to witness to the humiliations, the sorrows, the loneliness, from\r\nwhich he had sought refuge within them. “I will not—suffer again! You\r\nshall not go!”\r\n\r\nShe was full of love for him, and of pity. She understood even that\r\ngesture, and the past wretchedness to which it bore witness. And she\r\nyearned to comfort him, and to convince him that nothing that had gone\r\nbefore, nothing that could happen in the future, would set her against\r\nhim. Had he been seated, she would have knelt and kissed his hand, or\r\ncast herself on his breast and his love, and won him to her. But as he\r\nwalked she could not approach him, she did not know how to soften him.\r\nYet her duty was clear. It lay beside her dying mother. Nevertheless,\r\nif he forbade her to go, if he withstood her, how was she to perform\r\nit?\r\n\r\nAt length, “But if she be dying, sir,” she murmured. “Will you not then\r\nlet me see her?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her from under his heavy eyebrows. “I tell you, I will not\r\nlet you go!” he said stubbornly. “She has forfeited her right to you.\r\nWhen she made you die to me—you died to her! That is my decision. You\r\nhear me? And now—now,” he continued, returning in a measure to\r\ncomposure, “let there be an end!”\r\n\r\nShe stood silenced, but not conquered; knowing him more intimately than\r\nshe had known him before; and loving him not less, but more, since pity\r\nand sympathy entered into her love and drove out fear; but assured that\r\nhe was wrong. It could not be her duty to forsake: it must be his duty\r\nto forgive. But for the present she saw that in spite of all his\r\nefforts he was cruelly agitated, that she had stirred pangs long lulled\r\nto rest, that he had borne as much as he could bear. And she would not\r\npress him farther for the time.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he, as he stood fingering his trembling lips, was trying to\r\nbring the cunning of age to bear. He was silently forming his plan. She\r\nhad been too much alone, he reflected; that was it. He had forgotten\r\nthat she was young, and that change and movement and life and gaiety\r\nwere needful for her. This about—that woman—was an obsession, an\r\nunwholesome fancy, which a few days in a new place, and amid lively\r\nscenes, would weaken and perhaps remove. And by and by, when he thought\r\nthat he could trust his voice, he spoke.\r\n\r\n“I said, let there be an end! But—you are all I have,” he continued,\r\nwith emotion, “and I will say instead, let this be for a time. I must\r\nhave time to think. You want—there are many things you want that you\r\nought to have—frocks, laces, and gew-gaws,” he added, with a sickly\r\nsmile, “and I know not what, that you cannot get here, nor I choose for\r\nyou. Lady Worcester has offered to take you with her to town—she goes\r\nthe day after to-morrow. I was uncertain this morning whether to send\r\nyou or not, whether I could spare you or not. Now, I say, go. Go, and\r\nwhen you return, Mary, we will talk again.”\r\n\r\n“And then,” she said, pleading softly, “you will let me go!”\r\n\r\n“Never!” he cried, lifting his head in a sudden, uncontrollable\r\nrecurrence of rage. “But there, there! There! there! I shall have\r\nthought it over—more at leisure. Perhaps! I don’t know! I will tell you\r\nthen. I will think it over.”\r\n\r\nShe saw with clear eyes that this was an evasion, that he was deceiving\r\nher. But she felt no resentment, only pity. She had no reason to think\r\nthat her mother needed her on the instant. And much was gained by the\r\nmere discussion of the subject. At least he promised to consider it:\r\nand though he meant nothing now, perhaps when he was alone he would\r\nthink of it, and more pitifully. Yes, she was sure he would.\r\n\r\n“I will go, if you wish it,” she said, submissively. She would show\r\nherself obedient in all things lawful.\r\n\r\n“I do wish it,” he answered. “My daughter must know her way about. Go,\r\nand Lady Worcester will take care of you. And when—when you come back\r\nwe will talk. You will have things to prepare, my dear,” he continued,\r\navoiding her eyes, “a good deal to prepare, I dare say, since this is\r\nsudden, and you had better go now. I think that is all.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI\r\nTHE SCENE IN THE HALL\r\n\r\n\r\nArthur Vaughan had been quick to see that he could not step at once\r\ninto place and fame; that success in political life could not in these\r\ndays be attained at a bound. But had he been less quick, the great\r\ndebate which preceded the passage of the Bill through the Commons must\r\nhave availed to persuade him. That their last words of warning to the\r\ncountry, their solemn remonstrances, might have more effect, the\r\nmanagers of the Opposition had permitted the third reading to be\r\ncarried in the manner which has been described. But, that done, they\r\nunmasked all their forces, bent on proving that if in the time to come\r\nthe peers threw out the Bill they would do so with a respectable\r\nweight, not only of argument, but of public feeling behind them; and\r\nthat, not only in the country, but in the popular House. All that the\r\nbitter invective of Croker, the mingled gibes and predictions of\r\nWetherell, the close and weighty reasoning of Peel, the precedents of\r\nSugden could do to warn the timid and arouse the prudent was done. That\r\nancient Chamber, which was never again to echo the accents of a debate\r\nso great, which stood indeed already doomed, as if it could not long\r\nsurvive the order of things of which it had been for centuries the\r\ncentre, had heard, it may be, speeches more lofty, men more\r\neloquent—for whom had it not heard?—but never men more in earnest, or\r\nwords more keenly barbed by the prejudices of the passing, or the\r\naspirations of the coming, age. Of the one party were those who could\r\nsee naught but glory in the bygone, naught but peril in change, of the\r\nother, those whose strenuous aim it was to make the future redress the\r\nwrongs of the past. The former were like children, viewing the Armada\r\nhangings which tapestried the neighbouring Chamber, and seeing only the\r\nfair front: the latter like the same children, picking with soiled\r\nfingers at the backing, coarse, dusty and cobwebbed, which for two\r\nhundred years had clung to the roughened masonry.\r\n\r\nVaughan sat through the three nights, brooding darkly on the feats\r\nperformed before him. If they who fought in the arena were not giants,\r\nif the House no longer held a match for Canning and Brougham, the\r\ncombatants seemed giants to him; for a man’s opinion of himself is\r\nnever far from the opinion which others hold of him. And he soon\r\nperceived that a common soldier might as easily step from the ranks and\r\nset the battle in order as he, Arthur Vaughan, rise up, without farther\r\ntraining, and lead the attack or cover the defence. He sat soured and\r\ngloomy, a mere spectator; dwelling, even while he listened to the\r\nflowery periods of Macaulay, or the trenchant arguments of Peel, on the\r\nwrong done to himself by the disposal of his seat.\r\n\r\nIt was so like the Whigs, he told himself. Here on the floor of the\r\nHouse who so loud as they in defence of the purity of elections, of the\r\npeople’s right to be represented, of the unbiassed vote of the\r\nelectors? But behind the scenes they were as keenly bent on jobbing a\r\nseat here, or neutralising a seat there, and as careless of the\r\npeople’s rights as they had ever been! It was atrocious, it was\r\nshameful! If this were political life, if this were political honesty,\r\nhe had had enough of it!\r\n\r\nBut alas, though he said it in his anger, there was the rub! He had not\r\nhad, and now he was not likely to have, enough of it. The hostility to\r\nhimself, of which he had come slowly to be conscious, as a man grows\r\nslowly to perceive a frostiness in the air, had insensibly sapped his\r\nself-confidence and lowered his claims. He no longer dreamt of rising\r\nand outshining the chiefs of his party. But he still believed that he\r\nhad it in him to succeed—were time given him. And all through the long\r\nhours of the three nights’ debates his thoughts were as often on his\r\nwrongs as on the momentous struggle which was passing before his eyes,\r\nand for the issue of which the clubs of London were keeping vigil.\r\n\r\nBut enthusiasm is infectious. And when the tellers for the last time\r\nwalked up to the table, at five o’clock on the morning of the 22nd of\r\nSeptember, with the grey light of daybreak stealing in to shame the\r\ncandles and betray the jaded faces—when he and all men knew that for\r\nthem the end of the great struggle was come—Vaughan waited breathless\r\nwith the rest and strained his ears to catch the result. And when, a\r\nmoment later, peal upon peal of fierce cheering shook the old panels in\r\ntheir frames, and being taken up by waiting crowds without, carried the\r\nnews through the dawn to the very skirts of London—the news that Reform\r\nhad passed the People’s House, and that only the peers now stood\r\nbetween the country and its desire—he shared the triumph and shouted\r\nwith the rest, shook hands with exultant neighbours, and waved his hat,\r\nperspiring.\r\n\r\nBut in his case the feeling of exultation was short-lived; perhaps in\r\nthe case of many another, who roared himself hoarse and showed a\r\ngleeful face to the daylight. Certainly it was something to have taken\r\npart in such a scene, the memory of which must survive for generations.\r\nIt was something to have voted in such a division. He might talk of it\r\nin days to come to his grandchildren. But for him personally it meant\r\nthat all was over; that here, if the Lords passed the Bill, was the\r\nend. A Dissolution must follow, and when the House met again, his place\r\nwould know him no more. He would be gone, and no man would feel the\r\nblank.\r\n\r\nNor were less selfish doubts wanting. As he stood, caught in the press\r\nand awaiting his turn to leave the crowded House, his eyes rested on\r\nthe pale, scowling faces which dotted the opposite benches; the faces\r\nof men who, honestly believing that here and now the old Constitution\r\nof England had got its deathblow, could not hide their bitter chagrin,\r\nor their scorn of the foe. Nor could he, at any rate, view those men\r\nwithout sympathy; without the possibility that they were right weighing\r\non his spirits; without a faint apprehension that this might indeed be\r\nthe beginning of decay, the starting point of that decadence which\r\nevery generation since Queen Anne’s had foreseen. For if many on that\r\nside represented no one but themselves, they still represented vast\r\ninterests, huge incomes, immense taxation. They were those who, if\r\nEngland sank, had most to lose. He, in the past, had given up almost\r\nhis all that he might stand aloof from them; and that, because he\r\nthought them prejudiced, wrong-headed, unreasonable. But he respected\r\nthem. And—what if they were right?\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the persistent cheering of his friends began to jar on his\r\ntired nerves. He seemed to see in this a beginning of disorder, of\r\nlicense, of revolution, of all those evils which the other party\r\nforetold. And then he had little liking for the statistics of Hume: and\r\nHume with his arm about his favourite pillar, was high among the\r\ntriumphant. Hard by him again was the tall, thin form of Orator Hunt,\r\nfor whom the Bill was too moderate; and the taller, thinner form of\r\nBurdett. They, crimson with shouting, were his partners in this; the\r\nbedfellows among whom his opinions had cast him.\r\n\r\nThinking such thoughts, he was among the last to leave the House, which\r\nhe did by way of Westminster Hall. The scene as he descended to the\r\nHall was so striking that he stood an instant on the steps to view it.\r\nThe hither half of the great space was comparatively bare, but the\r\nfarther half was occupied by a throng of people held back by a line of\r\nthe New Police, who were doing all they could to keep a passage for the\r\ndeparting Members. As groups of the latter, after chatting awhile at\r\nthe upper end, passed, conscious of the greatness of the occasion, down\r\nthe lane thus formed, bursts of loud cheering greeted the better-known\r\nReformers. Some of the more forward of those who waited shook hands\r\nwith them, or patted them on the back; while others cried “God bless\r\nyou, sir! Long life to you, sir!” On the other hand, an angry moan, or\r\na spirit of hissing, marked the passage of a known Tory; or a voice was\r\nraised calling to these to bid the Lords beware. A few lamps, which had\r\nburned through the night, contended pallidly with the growing daylight,\r\nand gave to the scene that touch of obscurity, that mingling of light\r\nand shadow—under the dusky, far-receding roof—which is necessary to the\r\npicturesque.\r\n\r\nVaughan did not suspect that, as he paused, looking down on the Hall,\r\nhe was himself watched, and by some sore enough that moment to be glad\r\nto wreak their feelings in any direction. As he set his foot on the\r\nstone pavement a group near at hand raised a cry of “Turncoat!\r\nTurncoat!” and that so loudly that he could not but hear it. An\r\nunmistakable hiss followed; and then, “Who stole a seat?” cried one of\r\nthe men.\r\n\r\n“And isn’t going to keep it?” cried another.\r\n\r\nVaughan turned short at the last words—he had not felt sure that the\r\nfirst were addressed to him. With a hot face, and every fibre in his\r\nbody tingling with defiance, he stepped up to the group. “Did you speak\r\nto me?” he said.\r\n\r\nA man with a bullying air put himself before the others. He was a\r\nruined Irish Member, who had sat for years for a close borough, and for\r\nwhom the Bill meant duns, bailiffs, a sponging-house, in a word, the\r\nloss of all those thing’s which made life tolerable. He was full of\r\nspite and spoiling for a fight with someone, no matter with whom.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he replied, confronting our friend with a sneer. “I have\r\nnot the pleasure of your acquaintance, sir!”\r\n\r\nVaughan was about to answer him in kind, when he espied in the middle\r\nof the group the pale, keen face and greyish whiskers of Sergeant\r\nWathen. And, “Perhaps you have not,” he retorted, “but that gentleman\r\nhas.” He pointed to Wathen. “And, if what was said a moment ago,” he\r\ncontinued, “was meant for me, I have the honour to ask for an\r\nexplanation.”\r\n\r\n“Explanation?” a Member in the background cried, in a jeering tone. “Is\r\nthere need of one?”\r\n\r\nVaughan was no longer red, he was white with anger. “Who spoke?” he\r\nasked, his voice ringing.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman looked over his shoulder and laughed. “Right you are,\r\nJerry!” he said: “I’ll not give you up!” And then to Vaughan, “I did\r\nnot,” he said rudely. “For the rest, sir, the Hall is large enough. And\r\nwe have no need of your heroics here!”\r\n\r\n“Your pleasure, however,” Vaughan replied, haughtily, “is not my law.\r\nSome one of you used words a moment ago which seemed to imply——”\r\n\r\n“What, sir?”\r\n\r\n“That I obtained my seat by unfair means! And the truth being perfectly\r\nwell known to that gentleman”—again he pointed to the Sergeant in a way\r\nwhich left Wathen anything but comfortable. “I am sure that he will\r\ntell you that the statement——”\r\n\r\n“Statement?”\r\n\r\n“Statement or imputation, or whatever you please to call it,” Vaughan\r\nanswered, sticking to his point in spite of interruptions, “is\r\nabsolutely unfounded—and false. And false! And, therefore, must be\r\nretracted.”\r\n\r\n“Must, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, must!” Vaughan replied—he was no coward. “Must, if you call\r\nyourselves gentlemen. But first, Mr. Sergeant,” he continued, fixing\r\nWathen with his eye, “I will ask you to tell these friends of yours\r\nthat I did not turn my coat at Chippinge. And that there was nothing in\r\nmy election which in any degree touched my honour.”\r\n\r\nThe Sergeant looked flurried. He was of those who love to wound, but do\r\nnot love to fight. And at this moment he wished from the crown of his\r\nhead to the soles of his feet, that he had held his tongue. But\r\nunluckily, whether the cloud upon Vaughan’s reputation had been his\r\nwork or not, he had certainly said more than he liked to remember; and,\r\nworse still, had said some part of it within the last five minutes, in\r\nthe hearing of those about him. To retract, therefore, was to dub\r\nhimself a liar; and he sought refuge, the perspiration standing on his\r\nbrow, in that half-truth which is at once worse than a lie—and safer.\r\n\r\n“I must say, Mr. Vaughan,” he said, “that the—the circumstances in\r\nwhich you used the vote given to you by your cousin, and—and the way in\r\nwhich you turned against him after attending a dinner of his\r\nsupporters——”\r\n\r\n“Openly, fairly, and after warning, I turned against him,” Vaughan\r\ncried, enraged at the show of justice which the accusation wore. “And\r\nthat, sir, in pursuance of opinions which I had publicly professed.\r\nMore, I allowed myself to be elected only after I had once refused Lord\r\nLansdowne’s offer of the seat! And after, only after, Sir Robert\r\nVermuyden had so treated me that all ties were broken. Sergeant Wathen,\r\nI appeal to you again! Was that not so?”\r\n\r\n“I know nothing of that,” Wathen answered, sullenly.\r\n\r\n“Nothing? You know nothing of that?” Vaughan cried.\r\n\r\n“No,” the Sergeant answered, still more sullenly. “I know nothing of\r\nwhat passed between you and your cousin. I know only that you were\r\npresent, as I have said, at a dinner of his supporters on the eve of\r\nthe election, and that on a sudden, at that dinner, you declared\r\nyourself against him—with the result that you were elected by the other\r\nside!”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Vaughan stood glowering at him, struck dumb by his denial\r\nand by the unexpected plausibility, nay, the unexpected strength of the\r\ncase against him. He was sure that Wathen knew more, he was sure that\r\nif he would he could say more! He was sure that the man was dishonest.\r\nBut he did not see how he could prove it, and——\r\n\r\nThe Irish Member laughed. “Well, sir,” he said, derisively, “is the\r\nexplanation, now you’ve got it, to your mind?”\r\n\r\nThe taunt stung Vaughan. He took a step forward. The next moment would\r\nhave seen him commit himself to a foolish action, that could only have\r\nled him to Wimbledon Common or Primrose Hill. But in the nick of time a\r\nvoice stayed him.\r\n\r\n“What’s this, eh?” it asked, its tone more lugubrious than usual. And\r\nSir Charles Wetherell, who had just descended the stairs from the\r\nlobby, turned a dull eye from one disputant to the other. “Can’t you do\r\nenough damage with your tongues?” he rumbled. “Brawl upstairs as much\r\nas you like! That’s the way to the Woolsack! But you mustn’t brawl\r\nhere!” And the heavy-visaged man, whose humour had again and again\r\nconciliated a House which his coarse invective had offended, once more\r\nturned from one to the other. “What is it?” he repeated. “Eh?”\r\n\r\nVaughan hastened to appeal to him. “Sir Charles,” he said, “I will\r\nabide by your decision! Though I do not know, indeed, that I ought to\r\ntake any man’s decision on a point which touches my honour!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” Wetherell said in an inimitable tone. “Court of Honour, is it?”\r\nAnd he cast a queer look round the circle. “That’s it, is it? Well, I\r\ndare say I’m eligible. I dare swear I know as much about honour as\r\nBrougham about equity! Or the Sergeant there”—Wathen reddened\r\nangrily—“about law! Or Captain McShane here about his beloved country!\r\nYes,” he continued, amid the unconcealed grins of those of the party\r\nwhose weak points had escaped, “you may proceed, I think.”\r\n\r\n“You are a friend, Sir Charles,” Vaughan said, in a voice which\r\nquivered with anxiety, “you are a friend of Sir Robert Vermuyden’s?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I won’t deny him until I know more!” Wetherell answered\r\nquaintly. “What of it?”\r\n\r\n“You know what occurred at Chippinge before the election?”\r\n\r\n“None better. I was there.”\r\n\r\n“And what passed between Sir Robert Vermuyden and me?” Vaughan\r\ncontinued, eagerly.\r\n\r\n“I think I do,” Wetherell answered. “In the main I do.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Sir Charles. Then I appeal to you. You are opposed to me in\r\npolitics, but you will do me justice. These gentlemen have thought fit\r\nto brand me here and now as a turncoat; and, worse, as one who was—who\r\nwas elected”—he could scarcely speak for passion—“in opposition to Sir\r\nRobert’s, to my relative’s candidates, under circumstances\r\ndishonourable to me!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed? Indeed? That is serious.”\r\n\r\n“And I ask you, sir, is there a word of truth in that charge?”\r\n\r\nWetherell had his eyes fixed gloomily on the pavement. He appeared to\r\nweigh the matter a moment or two. Then he shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Not a word,” he said, ponderously.\r\n\r\n“You—you bear me out, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Quite, quite,” the other answered slowly, as he took out his snuffbox.\r\n“To tell the truth, gentlemen,” he continued, in the same melancholy\r\ntone, “Mr. Vaughan was fool enough to quarrel with his bread and butter\r\nfor the sake of the most worthless, damnable and mistaken convictions\r\nany man ever held! That’s the truth. He showed himself a very perfect\r\nfool, but an honourable and an honest fool—and that’s a rare thing. I\r\nsee none here.”\r\n\r\nNo one laughed at the gibe, and he turned to Vaughan, who stood,\r\nrelieved indeed, but stiff and uncomfortable, uncertain what to do\r\nnext. “I’ll take your arm,” he said. “I’ve saved you,” coolly, “from\r\nthe ragged regiment on my side. Do you take me safe,” he continued,\r\nwith a look towards the lower end of the Hall, “through your ragged\r\nregiment outside, my lad!”\r\n\r\nVaughan understood only too well the generous motive which underlay the\r\ninvitation. But for a moment he hung back.\r\n\r\n“I am your debtor, Sir Charles,” he said, deeply moved, “as long as I\r\nlive. But I would like to know before I go,” and he raised his head,\r\nwith a look worthy of Sir Robert, “whether these gentlemen are\r\nsatisfied. If not——”\r\n\r\n“Oh, perfectly,” the Sergeant cried, hurriedly. “Perfectly!” And he\r\nmuttered something about being glad—hear explanation—satisfactory.\r\n\r\nBut the Irish Member stepped up and held out his hand. “Faith,” he\r\nsaid, “there’s no man whose word I’d take before Sir Charles’s! There’s\r\nno hiatus in his honour, whatever may be said of his breeches! That’s\r\none for you,” he added, addressing Wetherell. “I owed you one, my good\r\nsir!” And then he turned to Vaughan. “There’s my hand, sir! I\r\napologise,” he said. “You’re a man of honour, and it’s mistaken we\r\nwere!”\r\n\r\n“I am obliged to you for your candour,” Vaughan said, gratefully.\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen others raised their hats to him, or shook hands with him\r\nfrankly. The Sergeant did the same less frankly. But Vaughan saw that\r\nhe was cowed. Wetherell was Sir Robert Vermuyden’s friend, and the\r\nSergeant was Sir Robert’s nominee. So he pushed his triumph no farther.\r\nWith a feeling of gratitude too deep for words, he offered his arm to\r\nSir Charles, and went down the Hall in his company.\r\n\r\nBy this time the crowd at the lower end had carried their joy and their\r\nhorseplay elsewhere; and no attempt was made—Vaughan only wished an\r\nattempt had been made—to molest Wetherell. They walked across the yard\r\nto Parliament Street, as the first sunshine of the day fell on the\r\nbridge and the river. Flocks of gulls were swinging to and fro in the\r\nclear air above the water, and dumb barges were floating up with the\r\ntide. The hub-bub in that part was past and over; at that moment a\r\nscore of coaches were speeding through the suburbs, bearing to\r\nmarket-town and busy city, ay, and to village greens, where the news\r\nwas awaited eagerly, the tidings that the Bill had passed the Lower\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nSir Charles walked a short distance in silence. Then, “I thought some\r\nnotion of the kind was abroad,” he said. “It’s as well this happened.\r\nWhat are you going to do about your seat if the Bill pass, young man?”\r\n\r\n“I am told that it is pre-empted,” Vaughan answered, in a tone between\r\njest and earnest.\r\n\r\n“It is. But——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir Charles?”\r\n\r\n“You should see your own side about it,” Wetherell answered gruffly. “I\r\ncan’t say more than that.”\r\n\r\n“I am obliged to you for that.”\r\n\r\n“You should be!” Wetherell retorted in a peculiar tone. And with an\r\noath and a strange gesture he disengaged his arm. Halting and wheeling\r\nabout, he pointed with a shaking hand to the towers of the Abbey, which\r\nrose against the blue, beatified by the morning sunshine. “If I said\r\n‘batter down those walls, undig the dead, away with every hoary thing\r\nof time, the present and the future are enough, and we, the generation\r\nthat burns the mummies, which three thousand years have spared—we are\r\nwiser than all our forbears—’ what would you say? You would call me\r\nmad. Yet what are you doing? Ay, you, you among the rest! The building\r\nthat our fathers built, patiently through many hundred years, adding a\r\nlittle here and strengthening there, the building that Hampden and\r\nShrewsbury and Walpole, Chatham and his son, and Canning, and many\r\nothers tended reverently, repairing here and there, as time required,\r\nyou, you, who think you know more than all who have gone before you,\r\nhurry in ruin to the ground! That you may build your own building,\r\nbuilt in a day, to suit the day, and to perish with the day! Oh, mad,\r\nmad, mad! Ay,\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Hostis habet muros; ruit alta a culmine Troja.\r\nSat patriæ Priamoque datum; si Pergama linquâ.\r\nDefendi possent, etiam, hoc defensa fuissent!_”\r\n\r\n\r\nHis voice quavered on the last accent, his chin sank on his breast. He\r\nturned wearily and resumed his course. When Vaughan, who did not\r\nventure to address him again, parted from him in silence at the door of\r\nhis house, the fat man’s pendulous lip quivered, and a single tear ran\r\ndown his cheek.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII\r\nWICKED SHIFTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with a lighter heart that Vaughan walked on to Bury Street.\r\nThere were still, it seemed, faith and honour in the world, and some\r\nmen who could be trusted. But if he expected much to come of this, if\r\nhe expected to be received with an ovation on his next appearance at\r\nWestminster, he was doomed to disappointment. Wetherell’s defence\r\nconvinced those who heard it; and in time, no doubt, passing from mouth\r\nto mouth, would improve the young Member’s relations, not only on the\r\nfloor of the House, but in the lobbies and at Bellamy’s. But the\r\nEnglish are not dramatic. They have no love for scenes. And no one of\r\nthose whose silence or whose catcalls had wronged him thought fit to\r\ntake his hand in cold blood and ask his pardon; nor did any Don Quixote\r\ncast down his glove in Westminster Hall and offer to do battle with his\r\ntraducers. The manner of one man became a shade more cordial; another\r\nspoke where he would have nodded. And if Vaughan had risen at this time\r\nto speak on any question which he understood he would have been heard\r\nupon his merits.\r\n\r\nBut the change, slow though genial, like the breaking up of an English\r\nfrost, came too late to do him much service. With the transfer of the\r\nBill to the House of Lords public interest deserted the Commons. They\r\nsat, indeed, through the month of September, to the horror of many a\r\ncountry gentleman, who saw in this the herald of evil days; and they\r\ndebated after a fashion. But the attendance was sparse, and the\r\nthoughts and hopes of all men were in another place. Vaughan saw that\r\nfor all the reputation he could now make the Dissolution might be come\r\nalready. And with this, and the emptiness of his heart, from which he\r\ncould no more put the craving for Mary Vermuyden than he could dismiss\r\nher image from the retina of his mind, he was very miserable. The void\r\nleft by love, indeed, was rendered worse by the void left unsatisfied\r\nby ambition. Mary’s haunting face was with him at his rising, went with\r\nhim to his pillow, her little hand was often on his sleeve, her eyes\r\noften pleaded to his. In his lonely rooms he would pace the floor\r\nfeverishly, savagely, pestering himself with what might have been;\r\nkicking the furniture from his path and—and hating her! For the idea of\r\nmarriage, once closely presented to man or woman, leaves neither\r\nunchanged, leaves neither as it found them, however quickly it be put\r\naside.\r\n\r\nStill it was not possible for one who sprang from the governing\r\nclasses, and was gifted with political instincts, to witness the\r\nexcitement which moved the whole country during those weeks of\r\nSeptember and the early days of October, without feeling his own blood\r\nstirred; without sharing to some extent the exhilaration with which the\r\nadventurous view the approach of adventures. What would the peers do?\r\nAll England was asking that question. At Crockford’s, in the little\r\nsupper-room, or at the French Hazard table itself, men turned to put it\r\nand to hear the answer. At White’s and Boodle’s, in the hall of the\r\nAthenæum, as they walked before Apsley House, or under the gas-lamps of\r\nPall Mall, men asked that question again and again. It shared with\r\nPasta and the slow-coming cholera—which none the less was coming—the\r\nchit-chat of drawing-rooms; and with the next prize fight or with\r\nridicule of the New Police, the wrangling debates of every tavern and\r\nposthouse. Would the peers throw out the Bill? Would they—would those\r\ndoting old Bishops in particular—dare to thwart the People’s will?\r\nWould they dare to withhold the franchise from Birmingham and\r\nManchester, Leeds and Sheffield? On this husbands took one side, wives\r\nthe other, families quarrelled. What Croker thought, what Lord Grey\r\nthreatened, what the Duke had let drop, what Brougham had boasted, how\r\nLady Lyndhurst had sneered, or her husband retorted, what the Queen\r\nwished—scraps such as these were tossed from mouth to mouth, greedily\r\nreceived, carried far into the country, and eventually, changed beyond\r\nrecognition, were repeated in awestruck ears, in county ballrooms and\r\nat Sessions.\r\n\r\nOne member of the Privy Council, who had left his party on the Bill,\r\nand whose vote, it was thought, had turned a division, shot himself.\r\nAnd many another, it was whispered, never recovered wholly from the\r\nstrain of those days.\r\n\r\nFor far more hung upon the Lords’ decision than the mere fate of the\r\nBill. If they threw it out, what would the Ministry do? And—more\r\nmomentous still, and looming larger in the minds of men—what would the\r\ncountry do? What would Birmingham and Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds\r\ndo? What would they do?\r\n\r\nLord Grey, strong in the King’s support, would persevere, said some. He\r\nwould bring in the Bill again, and create peers in number sufficient to\r\ncarry it. And Macaulay’s squib was flung from club to club, from\r\nmeeting to meeting, until it reached the streets:\r\n\r\n_What, though new opposed I be_,\r\n\r\n_Twenty peers shall carry me!_\r\n\r\n_If twenty won’t, thirty will_,\r\n\r\n_For I am his Majesty’s bouncing Bill_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAy, his Majesty’s Bill, God bless him! His Majesty’s own Bill! Hurrah\r\nfor Lord Grey! Hurrah for Brougham! Hurrah for Lord John, and down with\r\nthe Bishops! So the word flew from mouth to mouth, so errand boys\r\nyelled it under the windows of London House, in St. James’s Square, and\r\nwherever aproned legs might be supposed to meet under the mahogany.\r\n\r\nBut others maintained that Lord Grey would simply resign, and let the\r\nconsequences fall on the heads of those who opposed the People’s will.\r\nThose consequences, it was whispered everywhere—and not by the timid\r\nand the rich only—spelled Revolution! Revolution, red and anarchical,\r\nwas coming, said many. Was not Scotland ready to rise? Was not the\r\nPolitical Union of Birmingham threatening to pay no taxes? Were not the\r\nPolitical Unions everywhere growling and lashing their sides? The\r\nwinter was coming, and there would be fires by night and drillings by\r\nday, as there had been during the previous autumn. Through the long\r\ndark nights there would be fear and trembling, and barring of doors,\r\nand waiting for the judgment to come. And then some morning the\r\ncrackling sound of musketry would awaken Pall Mall and Mayfair, the mob\r\nwould seize the Tower and Newgate, the streets would run blood and the\r\nguillotine would rise in Leicester Square or Finsbury Fields.\r\n\r\nSo widely were these fears spread—fostered as they were by both\r\nparties, by the Tories for the purpose of proving whither Reform was\r\nleading the country, by the Whigs to show to what the obstinacy of the\r\nborough-mongers was driving it—that few were proof against them. So\r\nfew, that when the Bill was rejected in the early morning of Saturday,\r\nthe 8th of October, the Tory peers, from Lord Eldon downwards, though\r\nthey had not shrunk from doing their duty, could hardly be made to\r\nbelieve that they were at liberty to go to their homes unscathed.\r\n\r\nThey did so, however. But the first mutterings of the storm soon made\r\nthemselves heard. Within twenty-four hours the hearts of many failed\r\nthem for fear. The Funds fell at once. The journals appeared in\r\nmourning borders. In many towns the bells were tolled and the shops\r\nwere shut. The mob of Nottingham rose and burned the Castle and fired\r\nthe house of an unpopular squire. The mob of Derby besieged the gaol\r\nand released the prisoners. At Darlington, Lord Tankerville narrowly\r\nescaped with his life; Lord Londonderry was left for dead; no Bishop\r\ndared to wear his apron in public. Everywhere rose the cry of “No\r\nTaxes!” Finally, the rabble rose in immense numbers, paraded the West\r\nEnd of London, broke the windows of many peers, assaulted others, and\r\nwere only driven from Apsley House by the timely arrival of the Life\r\nGuards. The country, amazed and shaken from end to end, seemed to be\r\nalready in the grip of rebellion; so that within the week the very\r\nTories hastened to beg Lord Grey to retain office. Even the King, it\r\nwas supposed, was shaken; and his famous distich—his one contribution\r\nto the poetry of the country,\r\n\r\n_I consider Dissolution\r\nTantamount to Revolution_,\r\n\r\n\r\nfound admirers for its truth, if not for its beauty.\r\n\r\nSuch a ferment could not but occupy Vaughan’s mind and divert his\r\nthoughts from his own troubles, even from thoughts of Mary. Every day\r\nthere was news: every day, in the opinion of many, the sky grew darker.\r\nBut though the rejection of the Bill promised him a second short\r\nsession, and many who sat for close boroughs chuckled privately over\r\nthe respite, he was ill-content with a hand-to-mouth life. He saw that\r\nthe Bill must pass eventually. He did not believe that there would be a\r\nrevolution. It was clear that his only chance lay in following\r\nWetherell’s advice, and laying his case before one of his chiefs.\r\n\r\nSome days after the division he happened on an opportunity. He was\r\nwalking down Parliament Street when he came on a scene, much of a piece\r\nof the unrest of the time. A crowd was pouring out of Downing Street,\r\nand in the van of the rabble he espied the tall, ungainly figure of no\r\nless a man than Lord Brougham. Abreast of the Chancellor, but keeping\r\nhimself to the wall as if he desired to dissociate himself from the\r\ndemonstration, walked another tall figure, also in black, with\r\nshepherd’s plaid trousers. A second glance informed Vaughan that this\r\nwas no other than Mr. Cornelius, who had been present at his interview\r\nwith Brougham; and accepting the omen, he made up to the Chancellor\r\njust as the latter halted to rid himself of the ragged tail, which had,\r\nperhaps, been more pleasing to his vanity in the smaller streets.\r\n\r\n“My friends,” Brougham cried, checking with his hand the ragamuffins’\r\nshrill attempt at a cheer, “I am obliged to you for your approval; but\r\nI beg to bid you good-day! Assemblages such as these are——”\r\n\r\n“Disgusting!” Cornelius muttered audibly, wrinkling his nose as he eyed\r\nthem over his high collar.\r\n\r\n“Are apt to cause disorder!” the Chancellor continued, smiling. “Rest\r\nassured that your friends, of whom, if I am the highest in office I am\r\nnot the least in good-will, will not desert you.”\r\n\r\n“Hurrah! God bless you, my lord! Hurrah!” cried the tatterdemalions in\r\nvarious tones more or less drunken. And some held out their caps.\r\n“Hurrah! If your lordship would have the kindness to——”\r\n\r\n“Disgusting!” Cornelius repeated, wheeling about.\r\n\r\nVaughan seized the opportunity to intervene. “May I,” he said, raising\r\nhis hat and addressing the Chancellor as he turned, “consult you, my\r\nlord, for two minutes as you walk?”\r\n\r\nBrougham started on finding a gentleman of his appearance at his elbow;\r\nand looked as if he were somewhat ashamed of the guise in which he had\r\nbeen detected. “Ah!” he said. “Mr.—Mr. Vaughan? To be sure! Oh, yes,\r\nyou can speak to me, what can I do for you? It is,” he added, with\r\naffected humility, “my business to serve.”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked doubtfully at Mr. Cornelius, who raised his hat. “I have\r\nno secrets from Mr. Cornelius,” said the Chancellor pleasantly. And\r\nthen with a backward nod and a tinge of colour in his cheek,\r\n“Gratifying, but troublesome,” he continued. “Eh? Very troublesome,\r\nthese demonstrations! I often long for the old days when I could walk\r\nout of Westminster Hall, with my bag and my umbrella, and no one the\r\nwiser!”\r\n\r\n“Those days are far back, my lord,” Vaughan said politely.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well! Ah, well! Perhaps so.” They were walking on by this time. “I\r\ncan’t say that since the Queen’s trial I’ve known much privacy.\r\nHowever, it is something that those whom one serves are grateful.\r\nThey——”\r\n\r\n“Cry ‘Hosanna’ to-day,” Cornelius said gruffly, with his eyes fixed\r\nsteadily before him, “and ‘Crucify him’ tomorrow!”\r\n\r\n“Cynic!” said the Chancellor, with unabated good-humour. “But even you\r\ncannot deny that they are better employed in cheering their friends\r\nthan in breaches of the peace? Not that”—cocking his eye at Vaughan\r\nwith a whimsical expression of confidence—“a little disorder here and\r\nthere, eh, Mr. Vaughan—though to be deplored, and by no one more than\r\nby one in my position—has not its uses? Were there no apprehension of\r\nmob-rule, how many borough-mongers, think you, would vote with us? How\r\nmany waverers, like Harrowby and Wharncliffe, would waver? And how, if\r\nwe have no little ebullitions here and there, are we to know that the\r\npeople are in earnest? That they are not grown lukewarm? That Wetherell\r\nis not right in his statement—of which he’ll hear more than he will\r\nlike at Bristol, or I am mistaken—that there is a Tory re-action, an\r\nebb in the tide which so far has carried us bravely? But of course,” he\r\nadded, with a faint smile, “God forbid that we should encourage\r\nviolence!”\r\n\r\n“Amen!” said Mr. Cornelius. And sniffed in a very peculiar manner.\r\n\r\n“But to discern that camomile,” the Chancellor continued gaily, “though\r\nbitter to-day makes us better tomorrow, is a different thing from——”\r\n\r\n“Administering a dose!” Vaughan laughed, falling into the great man’s\r\nhumour.\r\n\r\n“To be sure. But enough of that. Now I think of it, Mr. Vaughan,” he\r\ncontinued, looking at his companion, “I have not had the pleasure of\r\nseeing you since—but I need not remind you of the occasion. You’ve had\r\ngood cause to remember it! Yes, yes,” he went on with voluble\r\ncomplacency—he was walking as well as talking very fast—“I seldom speak\r\nwithout meaning, or interfere without result. I knew well what would\r\ncome of it. It was not for nothing, Mr. Vaughan, that I got down our\r\nBorough List and asked you if you had no thought of entering the House.\r\nThe spark—and tinder! For there you are in the House!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Vaughan replied, astonished at the coolness with which the other\r\nunveiled, and even took credit for, the petty intrigue of six months\r\nback. “But——”\r\n\r\n“But,” Brougham said, taking him up with a quick, laughing glance, “you\r\nare not yet on the Treasury Bench? That’s it?”\r\n\r\n“No, not yet,” Vaughan answered, good-humouredly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, time and patience and Bellamy’s chops, Mr. Vaughan, will\r\ncarry you far, I am sure.”\r\n\r\n“It is on that subject—the subject of time—I venture to trouble your\r\nlordship.”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor’s lumpish but singularly mobile features underwent a\r\nchange. Caught in a complacent, vain humour, he had forgotten a thing\r\nwhich, with Vaughan’s last words, recurred to him. “Yes?” he said,\r\n“yes, Mr. Vaughan?” But the timbre of that marvellously flexible voice\r\nwith which he boasted that he could whisper so as to be heard to the\r\nvery door of the House of Commons, was changed. “Yes, what is it,\r\npray?”\r\n\r\n“It is time I require,” Vaughan answered. “And, in fine, I have done\r\nsome service, yeoman service, my lord, and I think that I ought not to\r\nbe cast aside by the party in whose interest I was returned, and with\r\nwhose objects I am in sympathy.”\r\n\r\n“Cast aside? Tut, tut! What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“I am told that though the borough for which I sit will continue to\r\nreturn one member, I shall not have the support of the party in\r\nretaining my seat.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! Indeed!” Brougham answered, “Is it so? I am sorry to hear\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“But——”\r\n\r\n“Very sorry, Mr. Vaughan.”\r\n\r\n“But, with submission, my lord, it is something more than sorrow I\r\nseek,” Vaughan answered, too sore to hide his feelings. “You have owned\r\nvery candidly that I derived from you the impulse which has carried me\r\nso far. Is it unreasonable if I venture to turn to you, when advised to\r\nsee one of the chiefs of my party?”\r\n\r\n“Who,” Brougham asked with a quick look, “gave you that advice, Mr.\r\nVaughan?”\r\n\r\n“Sir Charles Wetherell.”\r\n\r\n“Um!” the Chancellor replied through pinched lips. And he stood, “they\r\nhad crossed Piccadilly and Berkeley Square, and had reached the corner\r\nof Hill Street, where at No. 5, Brougham lived.\r\n\r\n“I repeat, my lord,” Vaughan continued, “is it unreasonable if I apply\r\nto you in these circumstances, rather——”\r\n\r\n“Rather than to one of the whips?” Brougham said drily.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“But I know nothing of the matter, Mr. Vaughan.”\r\n\r\nBut Vaughan was in no mood to put up with subterfuges. If the other did\r\nnot know, he should know. He had been all-powerful, it seemed, to bring\r\nhim in: was he powerless to keep him in? “There is a compact, I am\r\ntold,” he said, “under which the seat is to be surrendered—for this\r\nturn, at any rate—to my cousin’s nominee.”\r\n\r\nBrougham shrugged his shoulders, and looked at Mr. Cornelius. “Dear me,\r\ndear me,” he said. “That’s not a thing of which I can approve. Far from\r\nit! Far from it! But you must see, Mr. Vaughan, that I cannot meddle in\r\nmy position with arrangements of that kind. Impossible, my dear sir, it\r\nis clearly impossible!”\r\n\r\nVaughan stared; and with some spirit and more temper, “But the spark,\r\nmy lord! I’m sure you won’t forget the spark?” he said.\r\n\r\nFor an instant a gleam of fun shone in the other’s eyes. Then he was\r\nfunereal again. “Before the Bill, and after the Bill, are two things,”\r\nhe said drily. “Before the Bill all is, all was impure. And in an\r\nimpure medium—you understand me, I am sure? You are scientific, I\r\nremember. But after the Bill—to ask me, who in my humble measure, Mr.\r\nVaughan, may call myself its prime cause—to ask me to infringe its\r\nfirst principles by interposing between the Electors and their rights,\r\nto ask me to use an influence which cannot be held legitimate—no, Mr.\r\nVaughan, no!” He shook his head solemnly and finally. And then to Mr.\r\nCornelius, “Yes, I am coming, Mr. Cornelius,” he said. “I know I am\r\nlate.”\r\n\r\n“I can wait,” said Mr. Cornelius.\r\n\r\n“But I cannot. Good-day, Mr. Vaughan. Good-day,” he repeated, refusing\r\nto see the young man’s ill-humour. “I am sorry that I cannot help you.\r\nOr, stay!” he continued, halting in the act of turning away. “One\r\nminute. I gather that you are a friend of Sir Charles Wetherell’s?”\r\n\r\n“He has been a friend to me,” Vaughan answered sullenly.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, he is going to Bristol to hold his sessions—on the 29th, I\r\nthink. Go with him. Our fat friend hates me like poison, but I would\r\nnot have a hair of his head injured. We have been warned that there\r\nwill be trouble, and we are taking steps to protect him. But an\r\nable-bodied young soldier by his side will be no bad thing. And upon my\r\nhonour,” he continued, eyeing Vaughan with impudent frankness—impudent\r\nin view of all that had gone before—“upon my honour, I am beginning to\r\nthink that we spoiled a good soldier when we—eh!”\r\n\r\n“The spark!” Mr. Cornelius muttered grimly.\r\n\r\n“Good-day, my lord,” said Vaughan with scant ceremony; his blood was\r\nboiling. And he turned and strode away, scarcely smothering an\r\nexecration. The two, who did not appear to be in a hurry after all,\r\nremained looking after him. And presently Mr. Cornelius smiled.\r\n\r\n“What amuses you?” Brougham asked, with a certain petulence. For at\r\nbottom, and in cases where no rivalry existed, he was good-natured; and\r\nin his heart he was sorry for the young man. But then, if one began to\r\nthink of the pawn’s feelings, the game he was playing would be spoiled.\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking,” Mr. Cornelius answered slowly, “of purity.” He\r\nsniffed. “And the Whigs!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Arthur Vaughan was striding down Bruton Street with every\r\nangry passion up in arms. He was too clever to be tricked twice, and he\r\nsaw precisely what had happened. Brougham—well, well was he called\r\nWicked Shifts!—reviewing the Borough List before the General Election,\r\nhad let his eyes fall on Sir Robert’s seats at Chippinge; and looking\r\nabout, with his customary audacity, for a means of snatching them, had\r\nalighted on him—and used him for a tool! Now, he was of no farther use.\r\nAnd, as the loss of his expectations rendered it needless to temporise\r\nwith him, he was contemptuously tossed aside.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the game of politics which he had yearned to play! This\r\nwas the party whose zeal for the purity of elections and the\r\nimprovement of all classes he had shared, and out of loyalty to which\r\nhe had sacrificed a fortune! He strode along the crowded pavement of\r\nParliament Street—it was the fashionable hour of the afternoon and the\r\npolitical excitement kept London full—his head high, his face flushed.\r\nAnd unconsciously as he shouldered the people to right and left, he\r\nswore aloud.\r\n\r\nAs he uttered the word, regardless in his anger of the scene about him,\r\nhis fixed gaze pierced for an instant the medley of gay bonnets and\r\nsmiling faces, moving chariots and waiting footmen, which even in those\r\ndays filled Parliament Street—and met another pair of eyes.\r\n\r\nThe encounter lasted for a second only. Then half a dozen heads and a\r\nparasol intervened. And then—in another second—he was abreast of the\r\ncarriage in which Mary Vermuyden sat, her face the prettiest and her\r\nbonnet the daintiest—Lady Worcester had seen to that—of all the faces\r\nand all the bonnets in Parliament Street that day. The landau in which\r\nshe sat was stationary at the edge of the pavement; and on the farther\r\nside of her reposed a lady of kind face and ample figure.\r\n\r\nFor an instant their eyes met again; and Mary’s colour, which had fled,\r\nreturned in a flood of crimson, covering brow and cheeks. She leaned\r\nfrom the carriage and held out her white-gloved hand. “Mr. Vaughan!”\r\nshe said. And he might have read in her face, had he chosen, the\r\nsweetest and frankest appeal. “Mr. Vaughan!”\r\n\r\nBut the moment was unlucky. The devil had possession of him. He raised\r\nhis hat and passed on, passed on wilfully. He fancied—afterwards, that\r\nis, he fancied—that she had risen to her feet after he had gone by and\r\ncalled him a third time in a voice at which the convenances of\r\nParliament Street could only wink. But he went on. He heard, but he\r\nwent on. He told himself that all was of a piece. Men and women, all\r\nwere alike. He was a fool who trusted any, believed in any, loved any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII\r\nONCE MORE, TANTIVY!\r\n\r\n\r\nVaughan had been sore at heart before the meeting in Parliament Street.\r\nAfter that meeting he was in a mood to take any step which promised to\r\nsalve his self-esteem. The Chancellor, Lord Lansdowne, Sir Robert,\r\nand—and Mary, all, he told himself, were against him. But they should\r\nnot crush him. He would prove to them that he was no negligible\r\nquantity. Parliament was prorogued; the Long Vacation was far advanced;\r\nthe world, detained beyond its time, was hurrying out of town. He, too,\r\nwould go out of town; and he would go to Chippinge. There, in defiance\r\nalike of his cousin and the Bowood interest, he would throw himself\r\nupon the people. He would address himself to those whom the Bill\r\nenfranchised, he would appeal to the future electors of Chippinge, he\r\nwould ask them whether the will of their great neighbours was to\r\nprevail, and the claims of service and of gratitude were to go for\r\nnothing. Surely at this time of day the answer could not be adverse!\r\n\r\nTrue, the course he proposed matched ill with the party notions which\r\nstill prevailed. It was a complete breach with the family traditions in\r\nwhich he had been reared. But in his present mood Vaughan liked his\r\nplan the better for this. Henceforth he would be iron, he would be\r\nadamant! And only by a little thing did he betray that under the iron\r\nand under the adamant he carried an aching heart. When he came to book\r\nhis place, deliberately, wilfully, he chose to travel by the Bath road\r\nand the White Lion coach, though he could have gone at least as\r\nconveniently by another coach and another route. Thus have men ever,\r\nsince they first felt the pangs of love, rejoiced to press the dart\r\nmore deeply in the wound.\r\n\r\nA dark October morning was brooding over the West End when he crossed\r\nPiccadilly to take his place outside the White Horse Cellar. Now, as on\r\nthat distant day in April, when the car of rosy-fingered love had\r\nawaited him ignorant, the coaches stood one behind the other in a long\r\nline before the low-blind windows of the office. But how different was\r\nall else! To-day the lamps were lighted and flickered on wet pavements,\r\nthe streets were windy and desolate, the day had barely broken above\r\nthe wet roofs, and on all a steady rain was falling. The watermen went\r\nto and fro with sacks about their shoulders, and the guards, bustling\r\nfrom the office with their waybills and the late parcels, were short of\r\ntemper and curt of tongue. The shivering passengers, cloaked to the\r\neyes in boxcoats and wrap-rascals, climbed silently and sullenly to the\r\nroof, and there sat shrugging their shoulders to their ears. Vaughan,\r\nwho had secured a place beside the driver, cast an eye on all, on the\r\nlong dark vista of the street, on the few shivering passers; and he\r\nfound the change fitting. Let it rain, let it blow, let the sun rise\r\nniggardly behind a mask of clouds! Let the world wear its true face! He\r\ncared not how discordantly the guard’s horn sounded, nor how the\r\ncoachman swore at his cattle, nor how the mud splashed up, as two\r\nminutes after time they jostled and rattled and bumped down the slope\r\nand through the dingy narrows of Knightsbridge.\r\n\r\nPerhaps to please him, the rain fell more heavily as the light\r\nbroadened and the coach passed through Kensington turnpike. The\r\npassengers, crouching inside their wraps, looked miserably from under\r\ndripping umbrellas on a wet Hammersmith, and a wetter Brentford. Now\r\nthe coach ploughed through deep mud, now it rolled silently over a bed\r\nof chestnut or sycamore leaves which the first frost of autumn had\r\nbrought down. Swish, swash, it splashed through a rivulet. It was full\r\ndaylight now; it had been daylight an hour. And, at last, joyous sight,\r\npleasant even to the misanthrope on the box-seat, not far in front,\r\nthrough a curtain of mist and rain, loomed Maidenhead—and breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe up night-coach, retarded twenty minutes by the weather, rattled up\r\nto the door at the same moment. Vaughan foresaw that there would be a\r\ncontest for seats at the table, and, without waiting for the ladder, he\r\nswung himself to the ground, and entered the house. Hastily doffing his\r\nstreaming overcoats, he made for the coffee-room, where roaring fires\r\nand a plentiful table awaited the travellers. In two minutes he was\r\nserved, and isolated by his gloomy thoughts and almost unconscious of\r\nthe crowded room and the clatter of plates, he was eating his breakfast\r\nwhen his next-door neighbour accosted him.\r\n\r\n“Beg your pardon, sir,” he said in a meek voice. “Are you going to\r\nBristol, sir?”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked at the speaker, a decent, clean-shaven person in a black\r\nhigh-collared coat, and a limp white neck-cloth. The man’s face seemed\r\nfamiliar to him, and instead of answering the question, Vaughan asked\r\nif he knew him.\r\n\r\n“You’ve seen me in the Lobby, sir,” the other answered, fidgeting in\r\nhis humility. “I’m Sir Charles Wetherell’s clerk, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! To be sure!” Vaughan replied. “I thought I knew your face. Sir\r\nCharles opens the Assizes to-morrow, I understand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, if they will let him. Do you think that there is much\r\ndanger, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Danger?” Vaughan answered with a smile. “No serious danger.”\r\n\r\n“The Government did not wish him to go, sir,” the other rejoined with\r\nan air of mystery.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t believe that,” Vaughan said.\r\n\r\n“Well, the Corporation didn’t, for certain, sir,” the man persisted in\r\na low voice. “They wanted him to postpone the Assizes. But he doesn’t\r\nknow what fear is, sir. And now the Government’s ordered troops to\r\nBristol, and I’m afraid that’ll make ’em worse. They’re so set against\r\nhim for saying that Bristol was no longer for the Bill. And they’re a\r\ndesperate rough lot, sir, down by the Docks!”\r\n\r\n“So I’ve heard,” Vaughan said. “But you may be sure that the\r\nauthorities will see that Sir Charles is well guarded!”\r\n\r\nThe clerk said nothing to that, although it was clear that he was far\r\nfrom convinced, or easy. And Vaughan returned to his thoughts. But by\r\nand by it chanced that as he raised his eyes he met those of a girl who\r\nwas passing his table on her way from the room; and he remembered with\r\na sharp pang how Mary had passed his table and looked at him, and\r\nblushed; and how his heart had jumped at the sight. Why, there was the\r\nvery waiting-maid who had gone out with her! And there, where the April\r\nsun had shone on her through the window, she had sat! And there, three\r\nplaces only from his present seat, he had sat himself. Three seats\r\nonly—and yet how changed was all! The unmanly tears rose very near to\r\nhis eyes as he thought of it.\r\n\r\nHe sat so long brooding over this, in that mood in which a man recks\r\nlittle of time, or of what befalls him, that the guard had to summon\r\nhim. And even then, as he donned his coats, with the “boots” fussing\r\nabout him, and the coachman grumbling at the delay, his memory was busy\r\nwith that morning. There, in the porch, he had stood and heard the\r\nyoung waterman praise her looks! And there Cooke had stood and\r\ndenounced the Reform placard! And there——\r\n\r\n“Let go!” growled the coachman, losing patience a last. “The\r\ngentleman’s not coming!”\r\n\r\n“I’m coming,” he answered curtly. And crossing the pavement in two\r\nstrides, he swung himself up hand over hand, as the stableman released\r\nthe horses. The coach started as his foot left the box of the wheel.\r\nAnd something else started—furiously.\r\n\r\nHis heart. For in the place behind the coachman, in the very seat which\r\nMary Smith had occupied on that far-off April morning, sat Mary\r\nVermuyden! For an infinitely small fraction of a second, as he turned\r\nhimself to drop into his seat, his eyes swept her face. The rain had\r\nceased to fall, the umbrellas were furled; for that infinitely short\r\nspace his eyes rested on her features. Then his back was turned to her.\r\n\r\nHer eyes had been fixed elsewhere, her face had been cold—she had not\r\nseen him. So much, in the confused pounding rush of his thoughts, as he\r\nsat tingling in every inch of his frame, he could remember; but nothing\r\nelse except that in lieu of the plain Quaker-like dress which Mary\r\nSmith had worn—oh, dress to be ever remembered!—she was wearing rich\r\nfurs, with a great muff and a small hat of sable, and was Mary Smith no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nProbably she had been there from the start, seated behind him under\r\ncover of the rain and the umbrellas. If so—and he remembered that that\r\nseat had been occupied when he got to his place—she had perceived his\r\ncoming, had seen him mount, had been aware of him from the first. She\r\ncould see him now, watch every movement, read his self-consciousness in\r\nthe stiff pose of his head, perceive the rush of colour which dyed his\r\nears and neck.\r\n\r\nAnd he was planted there, he could not escape. And he suffered. Asked\r\nbeforehand, he would have said that his uppermost feeling in such\r\ncircumstances would be resentment. But, in fact, he could think of\r\nnothing except that meeting in Parliament Street, and the rudeness with\r\nwhich he had treated her. If he had not refused to speak to her, if he\r\nhad not passed her by, rejecting her hand with disdain, he might have\r\nbeen his own master now; he would have been free to speak, or free to\r\nbe silent, as he pleased. And she who had treated him so ill would have\r\nbeen the one to suffer. But, as it was, he was hot all over. The\r\nintolerable _gêne_ of the situation rested on him and weighed him down.\r\n\r\nUntil the coachman called his attention to a passing waggon, and\r\npointed out a something unusual in its make; which broke the spell and\r\nfreed his thoughts. After that he began to feel a little of the wonder\r\nwhich the coincidence demanded. How came she in the same seat, on the\r\nsame coach on which she had travelled before. He could not bring\r\nhimself to look round and meet her eyes. But he remembered that a\r\nman-servant, doubtless in attendance on her, shared the hind seat with\r\nthe clerk who had spoken to him; and the middle-aged woman who sat with\r\nher was doubtless her maid. Still, he knew Sir Robert well enough to be\r\nsure that he would not countenance her journeying, even with this\r\nattendance, on a public vehicle; and therefore, he argued, she must be\r\ndoing it without Sir Robert’s knowledge, and probably in pursuance of\r\nsome whim of her own. Could it be that she, too, wished to revive the\r\nbitter-sweet of recollection, the memory of that April day? And, to do\r\nso, had gone out of her way to travel on this cold wet morning on the\r\nsame coach, which six months before had brought them together?\r\n\r\nIf so, she must love him in spite of all. And in that case, what must\r\nher feelings have been when she saw him take his place? What, when she\r\nknew that she would not taste the bitter-sweet alone, but in his\r\ncompany? What, when she foresaw that, through the day she would not\r\npass a single thing of all those well-remembered things, that milestone\r\nwhich he had pointed out to her, that baiting-house of which she had\r\nasked the name, that stone bridge with the hundred balustrades which\r\nthey had crossed in the gloaming—her eyes would not alight on one of\r\nthese, without another heart answering to every throb of hers, and\r\nanother breast aching as hers ached.\r\n\r\nAt that thought a subtle attraction, almost irresistible, drew him to\r\nher, and he could have cried to her, under the pain of separation. For\r\nit was all true. Before his eyes those things were passing. There was\r\nthe milestone which he had pointed out to her. And there the ruined\r\ninn. And here were the streets of Reading opening before them, and the\r\nMarket Place, and the Bear Inn, where he had saved her from injury,\r\nperhaps from death.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThey were out of the town, they were clear of the houses, and he had\r\nnot looked, he had not been able to look at her. Her weakness, her\r\ninconstancy deserved their punishment: but for all her fortune, to\r\nrecover all that he had lost and she had gained, he would not have\r\nlooked at her there. Yet, while the coach changed horses in the Square\r\nbefore the Bear, he had had a glimpse of her—reflected in the window of\r\na shop; and he had marked with greedy eyes each line of her figure and\r\nseen that she had wound a veil round her face and hat, so that,\r\nwhatever her emotions, she might defy curious eyes. And yet, as far as\r\nhe was concerned, she had done it in vain. The veil could not hide the\r\nagitation, could not hide the strained rigidity of her pose, or the\r\nconvulsive force with which one hand gripped the other in her lap.\r\n\r\nWell, that was over, thank God! For he had as soon seen a woman beaten.\r\nThe town was behind them; Newbury was not far in front. And now with\r\nshame he began to savour a weak pleasure in her presence, in her\r\nnearness to him, in the thought that her eyes were on him and her\r\nthoughts full of him, and that if he stretched out his hand he could\r\ntouch her; that there was that between them, that there must always be\r\nthat between them, which time could not destroy. The coach was loaded,\r\nbut for him it carried her only: and for Mary he was sure that he\r\nfilled the landscape were it as wide as that which, west of Newbury,\r\nreveals to the admiring traveller the whole wide vale of the Kennet. He\r\nthrilled at the thought; and the coachman asked him if he were cold.\r\nBut he was far from cold; he knew that she too trembled, she, too,\r\nthrilled. And a foolish exultation possessed him. He had hungry\r\nthoughts of her nearness, and her beauty; and insane plans of snatching\r\nher to his breast when she left the coach, and covering her with kisses\r\nthough a hundred looked on. He might suffer for it, he would deserve to\r\nsuffer for it, it would be an intolerable outrage. But he would have\r\nkissed her, he would have held her to his heart. Nothing could undo\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nYet it was only in fancy that he was reckless, for still he did not\r\ndare to look at her. And when they came at last to Marlborough, and\r\ndrew up at the door of the Castle Inn, where west-bound travellers\r\ndined, he descended hurriedly and went into the coffee-room to secure a\r\nplace in a corner, whence he might see her enter without meeting her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nBut she did not enter the house, soon or late. And a vain man might\r\nhave thought that she was not only bent on doing everything which she\r\nhad done on the former journey, but that it was not without intention\r\nthat she remained alone on the coach, exposed to his daring—if he chose\r\nto dare. Not a few indeed, of his fellow-passengers, wandered out\r\nbefore the time, and on the pretence of examining the façade of the\r\nhandsome old house, shot sidelong glances at the young lady, who,\r\nwrapped in her furs and veiled to the throat, sat motionless in the\r\nkeen October air. But Vaughan was not of these; nor was he vain. When\r\nhe found that she did not come in, he decided that she would not meet\r\nhim, that she remained on the coach rather than sit in his company; and\r\nforgetting the overture in Parliament Street, he remembered only her\r\nfickleness and weakness. He fell to the depths. She had never loved\r\nhim, never, never!\r\n\r\nOn that he almost made up his mind to stay there; and to go on by the\r\nnext coach. His presence must be hateful to her, a misery, a torment,\r\nhe told himself. It was bad enough to force her to remain exposed to\r\nthe weather while others dined; it would be monstrous to go on and\r\ncontinue to make her wretched.\r\n\r\nBut, before the time for leaving came, he changed his mind, and he went\r\nout, feeling cowed and looking hard. He could not mount without seeing\r\nher out of the corner of his eye; but the veil masked all, and left him\r\nno wiser. The sun had burst through the clouds, and the sky above the\r\ncurving line of the downs was blue. But the October air was still\r\nchilly, and he heard the maid fussing about her, and wrapping her up\r\nmore warmly. Well, it mattered little. At Chippenham, the carriage with\r\nits pomp of postillions and outriders—Sir Robert was particular about\r\nsuch things—would meet her; and he would see her no more.\r\n\r\nHis pride weakened at that thought. She could never be anything to him\r\nnow; he had no longer the least notion of kissing her. But at\r\nChippenham, before she passed out of his life, he would speak to her.\r\nYes, he would speak. He did not know what he would say, but he would\r\nnot part from her in anger. He would tell her that, and bid her\r\ngood-bye. Later, he would be glad to remember that they had parted in\r\nthat way, and that he had forgiven!\r\n\r\nWhile he thought of it they fell swiftly from the lip of the downs, and\r\nrattling over the narrow bridge and through the stone-built streets of\r\nCalne, were out again on the Bath road. After that, though they took\r\nBlack Dog hill at a slow pace, they seemed to be at Chippenham in a\r\ntwinkling. Before he could calm his thoughts the coach was rattling\r\nbetween houses, and the wide straggling street was opening before them,\r\nand the group assembled in front of the Angel to see the coach arrive\r\nwas scattering to right and left.\r\n\r\nA glance told him that there was no carriage-and-four in waiting. And\r\nbecause his heart was jumping so foolishly he was glad to put off the\r\nmoment of speaking to her. She would go into the house to wait for the\r\ncarriage, and when the coach, with its bustle and its many eyes, had\r\ngone its way, he would be able to speak to her.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the moment the coach stopped he descended and hastened\r\ninto the house. He sent out the “boots” for his valise and betook\r\nhimself to the bar-parlour, where he called for something and jested\r\ncheerily with the smiling landlady, who came herself to attend upon\r\nhim. He kept his back to the door which Mary must pass to ascend the\r\nstairs, for well he knew the parlour of honour to which she would be\r\nushered. But though he listened keenly for the rustle of her skirts, a\r\ncouple of minutes passed and he heard nothing.\r\n\r\n“You are not going on, sir?” the landlady asked. She knew too much of\r\nthe family politics to ask point-blank if he were going to Chippinge.\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied; “no, I”—his attention wandered—“I am not.”\r\n\r\n“I hope we may have the honour of keeping you tonight, sir?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I”—was that the coach starting?—“I think I shall stay the night.”\r\nAnd then, “Sir Robert’s carriage is not here?” he asked, setting down\r\nhis glass.\r\n\r\n“No, sir. But two gentlemen have just driven in from Sir Robert’s in a\r\nchaise. They are posting to Bath. One’s Colonel Brereton, sir. The\r\nother’s a young gentleman, short and stout. Quite the gentleman, sir,\r\nbut that positive, the postboy told me, and talkative, you’d think he\r\nwas the Emperor of China! That’s their chaise coming out of the yard\r\nnow, sir.”\r\n\r\nA thought, keen as a knife-stab, darted through Vaughan’s mind. In\r\nthree strides he was out of the bar-parlour, in three more he was at\r\nthe door of the Angel.\r\n\r\nThe coach was in the act of starting, the ostlers were falling back,\r\nthe guard was swinging himself up; and Mary Vermuyden was where he had\r\nleft her, in the place behind the coachman. And in the box-seat, the\r\nvery seat which he had vacated, was Bob Flixton, settling himself in\r\nhis wraps and turning to talk to her.\r\n\r\nVaughan let fall a word which we will not chronicle. It was true, then!\r\nThey were engaged! Doubtless Flixton had come to meet her, and all was\r\nover. Fan-fa-ra! Fan-fa-ra! The coach was growing small in the\r\ndistance. It veered a little, a block of houses hid it, Vaughan saw it\r\nagain. Then in the dusk of the October evening the descent to the\r\nbridge swallowed it, and he turned away miserable.\r\n\r\nHe walked a little distance from the door that his face might not be\r\nseen. He did not tell himself that, because the view grew misty before\r\nhis eyes, he was taking the blow contemptibly; he told himself only\r\nthat he was very wretched, and that she was gone. It seemed as if so\r\nmuch had gone with her; so much of the hope and youth and fortune, and\r\nthe homage of men, which had been his when he and she first saw the\r\nstreets of Chippenham together and he alighted to talk to Isaac White,\r\nand mounted again to ride on by her side.\r\n\r\nHe was standing with his back to the inn thinking of this—and not\r\nbitterly, but in a broken fashion—when he heard his name called, and he\r\nturned and saw Colonel Brereton striding after him.\r\n\r\n“I thought it was you,” Brereton said. But though he had not met\r\nVaughan for some months, and the two had liked one another, he spoke\r\nwith little cordiality, and there was a vague look in his face. “I was\r\nnot sure,” he added.\r\n\r\n“You came with Flixton?” Vaughan said, speaking, on his side also,\r\nrather dully.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and meant to go on with him. But there’s no counting on men in\r\nlove,” Brereton continued with more irritation than the occasion seemed\r\nto warrant. “He saw his charmer on the coach, and a vacant seat—and I\r\nmay find my way to Bath as I can.”\r\n\r\n“They are to be married, I hear?” Vaughan said in the same dull tone\r\nand with his face averted.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” Brereton answered sourly. “What I do know is that I’m\r\nnot best pleased that he has left me. I heard Sir Charles Wetherell was\r\nsleeping at your cousin’s last evening, and I posted there to see him\r\nabout the arrangements for his entry. But I missed him. He’s gone to\r\nBath for this evening. Well, I took Flixton with me because I didn’t\r\nknow Sir Robert and he did, and he’s supposed to be playing\r\naide-de-camp to me. But a fine aide-de-camp he’s like to prove, if this\r\nis the way he treats me. You know Wetherell opens the Assizes at\r\nBristol tomorrow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I saw his clerk on my way here.”\r\n\r\n“There’ll be trouble, Vaughan!”\r\n\r\n“Really?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, really! And bad trouble! I wish it was over.” He passed his hand\r\nacross his brow.\r\n\r\n“I heard something of it in London,” Vaughan answered.\r\n\r\n“Not much, I’ll wager,” Brereton rejoined, with a brusqueness which\r\nbetrayed his irritation. “They don’t know much, or they wouldn’t be\r\nsending me eighty sabres to keep order in a city of a hundred thousand\r\npeople! Enough, you see, to anger, and not enough to intimidate! It’s\r\njust plain madness. It’s madness. But I’ve made up my mind! I’ve made\r\nup my mind!” he repeated, speaking in a tone which betrayed the\r\ntenseness of his nerves. “Not a man will I show if I can help it! Not a\r\nman! And not a shot will I fire, whatever comes of it! I’ll be no\r\nbutcherer of innocent folk.”\r\n\r\n“I hope nothing will come of it,” Vaughan answered, interested in spite\r\nof himself. “You’re in command, sir, of course?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I wish to heaven I were not! But there, there!” he continued,\r\npulling himself up as if he kept a watch on himself and feared that he\r\nhad said too much. “Enough of my business. What are you doing here?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I was going to Chippinge.”\r\n\r\n“Come to Bath with me! I shall see Wetherell, and you know him. You may\r\nbe of use to me. There’s half the chaise at your service, and I will\r\ntell you about it, as we go.”\r\n\r\nVaughan at that moment cared little where he went, and after the\r\nbriefest hesitation, he consented. A few minutes later they started\r\ntogether. It happened that as they drove in the last of the twilight\r\nover the long stone bridge, an open car drawn by four horses and\r\ncontaining a dozen rough-looking men overtook them and raced them for a\r\nhundred yards.\r\n\r\n“There’s another!” Brereton said, rising with an oath and looking after\r\nit. “I was told that two had gone through!”\r\n\r\n“What is it? Who are they?” Vaughan asked, leaning out on his side to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\n“Midland Union men, come to stir up the Bristol lambs!” Brereton\r\nanswered. “They may spare themselves the trouble,” he continued\r\nbitterly. “The fire will need no poking, I’ll be sworn!”\r\n\r\nAnd brought back to the subject, he never ceased from that moment to\r\ntalk of it. It was plain to anyone who knew him that a nervous\r\nexcitability had taken the place of his usual thoughtfulness. Long\r\nbefore they reached Bath, Vaughan was sure that, whatever his own\r\ntroubles, there was one man in the world more unhappy than himself,\r\nmore troubled, less at ease; and that that man sat beside him in the\r\nchaise.\r\n\r\nHe believed that Brereton exaggerated the peril. But if his fears were\r\nwell-based, then he agreed that the soldiers sent were too few.\r\n\r\n“Still a bold front will do much!” he argued.\r\n\r\n“A bold front!” Brereton replied feverishly. “No, but management may!\r\nManagement may. They give me eighty swords to control eighty thousand\r\npeople! Why, it’s my belief”—and he dropped his voice and laid his hand\r\non his companion’s arm,—“that the Government wants a riot! Ay, by G—d,\r\nit is! To give the lie to Wetherell and prove that the country, and\r\nBristol in particular, is firm for the Bill!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but that’s absurd!” Vaughan answered; though he recalled what\r\nBrougham had said.\r\n\r\n“Absurd or not, nine-tenths of Bristol believe it,” Brereton retorted.\r\n“And I believe it! But I’ll be no butcher. Besides, do you see how I am\r\nplaced? If in putting down this riot which is in the Government\r\ninterest, and is believed to be fostered by them, I exceed my duty by a\r\njot, I am a lost man! A lost man! Now do you see?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t think it’s as bad as that,” Vaughan said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX\r\nAUTUMN LEAVES\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson paused to listen, but heard nothing. And disappointed, and\r\nwith a sigh, she spread a clean handkerchief over the lap of her gown\r\nand helped herself to part of a round of buttered toast.\r\n\r\n“She’ll not come,” she muttered. “I was a fool to think it! An old fool\r\nto think it!” And she bit viciously into the toast.\r\n\r\nIt was long past her usual tea-time, yet she paused a second time to\r\nlisten, before she raised her first cup of tea to her lips. A covered\r\ndish which stood on a brass trivet before the bright coal fire gave\r\nforth a savoury smell, and the lamplight which twinkled on sparkling\r\nsilver and old Nantgarw, discovered more than the tea-equipage. The red\r\nmoreen curtains were drawn before the windows, a tabby cat purred\r\nsleepily on the hearth; in all Bristol was no more cosy or more\r\ncheerful scene. Yet Miss Sibson left the savoury dish untouched, and\r\nate the toast with less than her customary appetite.\r\n\r\n“I shall set,” she murmured, “‘The Deceitfulness of Riches’ for the\r\nfirst copy when the children return. And for the second ‘Fine Feathers\r\nMake Fine Birds!’ And”—she continued with determination, though there\r\nwas no one to be intimidated—“for the third, ‘There’s No Fool Like an\r\nOld Fool!’”\r\n\r\nShe had barely uttered the words when she set down her cup. The roll of\r\ndistant wheels had fallen on her ears. She listened for a few seconds,\r\nthen she rose in haste and rang the bell. “Martha,” she said when the\r\nmaid appeared, “are the two warming-pans in the bed?”\r\n\r\n“To be sure, Ma’am.”\r\n\r\n“And well filled?” Miss Sibson spoke suspiciously.\r\n\r\n“The sheets are as nigh singeing as you’d like, Ma’am,” the maid\r\nanswered. “You can smell ’em here! I only hope,” she continued, with a\r\nquaver in her voice, “as we mayn’t smell fire before long!”\r\n\r\n“Smell fiddlesticks!” Miss Sibson retorted. Then “That will do,” she\r\ncontinued. “I will open the door myself.”\r\n\r\nWhen she did so the lights of the hackney-coach which had stopped\r\nbefore the house disclosed first Mary Vermuyden in her furs, standing\r\non the step; secondly, Mr. Flixton, who had placed himself as near her\r\nas he dared; and thirdly and fourthly, flanking them at a distance of a\r\npace or two, a tall footman and a maid.\r\n\r\n“Good gracious!” Miss Sibson exclaimed, dismay in her tone.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Mary answered, almost crying. “They would come! I said I wished\r\nto come alone. Good-night, Mr. Flixton!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I—I couldn’t think of leaving you like this!” the Honourable\r\nBob answered. He had derived a minimum of satisfaction from his ride on\r\nthe coach, for Mary had shown herself of the coldest. And if he was to\r\npart from her here he might as well have travelled with Brereton.\r\nBesides, what the deuce was afoot? What was she doing here?\r\n\r\n“And Baxter is as bad,” Mary said plaintively. “As for Thomas——”\r\n\r\n“Beg pardon, Ma’am,” the man said, touching his hat, “but it is as much\r\nas my place is worth.”\r\n\r\nThe maid, a woman of mature years, said nothing, but held her ground,\r\nthe image of stolid disapproval. She knew Miss Sibson. But Bristol was\r\nstrange to her; and the dark windy square, with its flickering lights,\r\nits glimpses of gleaming water and skeleton masts, and its unseen but\r\ncreaking windlasses, seemed to her, fresh from Lady Worcester’s, a most\r\nunfitting place for her young lady.\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson cut the knot after her own fashion. “Well, I can’t take you\r\nin,” she said bluffly. “This gentleman,” pointing to Mr. Flixton, “will\r\nfind quarters for you at the White Lion or the Bush. And your mistress\r\nwill see you to-morrow. Thomas, bring in your young lady’s trunk.\r\nGood-night, sir,” she added, addressing the Honourable Bob. “Miss\r\nVermuyden will be quite safe with me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but I say, Miss Sibson!” he remonstrated. “You can’t mean to take\r\nthe moon out of the sky like this, and leave us in the dark? Miss\r\nVermuyden——”\r\n\r\n“Good-night,” Mary said, not a whit placated by the compliment. And she\r\nslipped past Miss Sibson into the passage.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but it’s not safe, you know!” he cried. “You’re not a hundred\r\nyards from the Mansion House here. And if those beggars make trouble\r\nto-morrow—positively there’s no knowing what will happen!”\r\n\r\n“We can take care of ourselves, sir,” Miss Sibson replied curtly.\r\n“Good-night, sir!” And she shut the door in his face.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Bob glared at it for a time, but it remained closed and\r\ndark. There was nothing to be done save to go. “D——n the woman!” he\r\ncried. And he turned about.\r\n\r\nIt was something of a shock to him to find the two servants still at\r\nhis elbow, patiently regarding him. “Where are we to go, sir?” the maid\r\nasked, as stolid as before.\r\n\r\n“Go?” cried he, staring. “Go? Eh? What? What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Where are we to go, sir, for the night? If you’ll please to show us,\r\nsir. I’m a stranger here.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! This is too much!” the Honourable Bob cried, finding himself on a\r\nsudden a family man. “Go? I don’t care if you go to——” But there he\r\npaused. He put the temptation to tell them to go to blazes from him.\r\nAfter all, they were Mary’s servants. “Oh, very well! Very well!” he\r\nresumed, fuming. “There, get in! Get in!” indicating the hackney-coach.\r\n“And do you,” he continued, turning to Thomas, “tell him to drive to\r\nthe White Lion. Was there ever? That old woman’s a neat artist, if ever\r\nI saw one!”\r\n\r\nAnd a moment later Flixton trundled off, boxed in with the mature maid,\r\nand vowing to himself that in all his life he had never been so diddled\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, within doors—for farce and tragedy are never far apart—Mary,\r\nwith her furs loosened, but not removed, was resisting all Miss\r\nSibson’s efforts to restrain her. “I must go to her!” she said with\r\npainful persistence. “I must go to her at once, if you please, Miss\r\nSibson. Where is she?”\r\n\r\n“She is not here,” Miss Sibson said, plump and plain.\r\n\r\n“Not here!” Mary cried, springing from the chair into which Miss Sibson\r\nhad compelled her. “Not here!”\r\n\r\n“No. Not in this house.”\r\n\r\n“Then why—why did she tell me to come here?” Mary cried dumbfounded.\r\n\r\n“Her ladyship is next door. No, my dear!” And Miss Sibson interposed\r\nher ample form between Mary and the door. “You cannot go to her until\r\nyou have eaten and drunk. She does not expect you, and there is no need\r\nof such haste. She may live a fortnight, three weeks, a month even! And\r\nshe must not, my dear, see you with that sad face.”\r\n\r\nMary gave way at that. She sat down and burst into tears.\r\n\r\nThe schoolmistress knew nothing of the encounter in Parliament Street,\r\nnothing of the meeting on the coach. But she was a sagacious woman, and\r\nshe discerned something more than the fatigue of the journey, something\r\nmore than grief for her mother, in the girl’s depression. She said\r\nnothing, however, contenting herself with patting her guest on the\r\nshoulder and gently removing her wraps and shoes. Then she set a\r\nfootstool for her in front of the fire and poured out her tea, and\r\nplaced hot sweetbread before her, and toast, and Sally Lunn. And when\r\nMary, touched by her kindness, flung her arms round her neck and kissed\r\nher, she said only, “That’s better, my dear, drink your tea, and then I\r\nwill tell you all I know.”\r\n\r\n“I cannot eat anything.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, you can! After that you are going to see your mother, and\r\nthen you will come back and take a good night’s rest. To-morrow you\r\nwill do as you like. Her ladyship is with an old servant next door,\r\nthrough whom she first heard of me.”\r\n\r\n“Why did she not remain in Bath?” Mary asked.\r\n\r\n“I cannot tell you,” Miss Sibson answered. “She has whims. If you ask\r\nme, I should say that she thought Sir Robert would not find her here,\r\nand so could not take you from her.”\r\n\r\n“But the servants?” Mary said in dismay. “They will tell my father. And\r\nindeed——”\r\n\r\n“Indeed what, my dear?”\r\n\r\n“I do not wish to hide from him.”\r\n\r\n“Quite right!” Miss Sibson said. “Quite right, my dear. But I fancy\r\nthat that was her ladyship’s reason. Perhaps she thought also that when\r\nshe—that afterwards I should be at hand to take care of you. As a\r\nfact,” Miss Sibson continued, rubbing her cheek with the handle of a\r\nteaspoon, a sure sign that she was troubled, “I wish that your mother\r\nhad chosen another place. You don’t ask, my dear, where the children\r\nare.”\r\n\r\nMary looked at her hostess. “Oh, Miss Sibson!” she exclaimed,\r\nconscience-stricken. “You cannot have sent them away for my sake?”\r\n\r\n“No, my dear,” Miss Sibson answered, noting with satisfaction that Mary\r\nwas making a meal. “No, their parents have removed them. The Recorder\r\nis coming to-morrow, and he is so unpopular on account of this nasty\r\nBill—which is setting everyone on horseback whether they can ride or\r\nnot—and there is so much talk of trouble when he enters, that all the\r\nfoolish people have taken fright and removed their children for the\r\nweek. It’s pure nonsense, my dear,” Miss Sibson continued comfortably.\r\n“I’ve seen the windows of the Mansion House broken a score of times at\r\nelections, and not another house in the Square a penny the worse! Just\r\nan old custom. And so it will be to-morrow. But the noise may disturb\r\nher ladyship, and that’s why I wish her elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nMary did not answer, and the schoolmistress, noting her spiritless\r\nattitude and the dark shadows under her eyes, was confirmed in her\r\nnotion that here was something beyond grief for the mother whom the\r\ngirl had scarcely known. And Miss Sibson felt a tug at her own\r\nheartstrings. She was well-to-do and well considered in Bristol, and\r\nshe was not conscious that her life was monotonous. But the gay scrap\r\nof romance which Mary’s coming had wrought into the dull patchwork of\r\ndays, long toned to the note of Mrs. Chapone, was welcome to her. Her\r\nlittle relaxations, her cosy whist-parties, her hot suppers to follow,\r\nthese she had: but here was something brighter and higher. It stirred a\r\nlong-forgotten youth, old memories, the ashes of romance. She loved\r\nMary for it.\r\n\r\nTo rouse the girl, she rose from her chair. “Now, my dear,” she said,\r\n“you can go to your room, if you will. And in ten minutes we will step\r\nnext door.”\r\n\r\nMary looked at her with grateful eyes. “I am glad now,” she said, “I am\r\nglad that she came here.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!” the schoolmistress answered, pursing up her lips. And she looked\r\nat the girl uncertainly. “It’s odd,” she said, “I sometimes think that\r\nyou are just—Mary Smith.”\r\n\r\n“I am!” the other answered warmly. “Always Mary Smith to you!” And the\r\nold woman took the young one to her arms.\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour later Mary came down, and she was Mary Smith in\r\ntruth. For she had put on the grey Quaker-like dress in which she had\r\nfollowed her trunk from the coach-office six months before. “I\r\nthought,” she said, “that I could nurse her better in this than in my\r\nnew clothes!” But she blushed deeply as she spoke: for if she had this\r\nthought she had others also in her mind. She might not often wear that\r\ndress, but she would never part with it. Arthur Vaughan’s eyes had\r\nworshipped it; his hands had touched it. And in the days to come it\r\nwould lie, until she died, in some locked coffer, perfumed with\r\nlavender, and sweet with the dried rose-leaves of her dead romance. And\r\non one day in the year she would visit it, and bury her face in its\r\nsoft faded folds, and dream the old dreams.\r\n\r\nIt was but a step to the door of the neighbouring house. But the\r\ndistance, though short, steadied the girl’s mind and enabled her to\r\ntaste that infinity of the night, that immensity of nature, which, like\r\na fathomless ocean, islands the littleness of our lighted homes. The\r\ngroaning of strained cordage, the creaking of timbers, the far-off\r\nrattle of a boom came off the dark water that lipped the wharves which\r\nstill fringe three sides of the Square. Here and there a rare gas-lamp,\r\nlately set up, disclosed the half-bare arms of trees, or some vague\r\nopening leading to the Welsh Back. But for all the two could see, as\r\nthey glided from the one door to the other, the busy city about them,\r\nseething with so many passions, pregnant with so much danger, hiding in\r\nits entrails the love, the fear, the secrets of a myriad lives, might\r\nhave been in another planet.\r\n\r\nMary owned the calming influence of the night and the stars, and before\r\nthe door opened to Miss Sibson’s knock, the blush had faded from her\r\ncheek. It was with solemn thoughts that she went up the wide oaken\r\nstaircase, still handsome, though dusty and fallen from its high\r\nestate. The task before her, the scene on the threshold of which she\r\ntrod, brought the purest instincts of her nature into play. But her\r\nguide knocked, someone within the room bade them enter, and Mary\r\nadvanced. She saw lights and a bed—a four-poster, heavily curtained.\r\nAnd half blinded by her tears, she glided towards the bed—or was\r\ngliding, when a querulous voice arrested her midway.\r\n\r\n“So you are come!” it said. And Lady Sybil, who, robed in a silken\r\ndressing-gown, was lying on a small couch in a different part of the\r\nroom, tossed a book, not too gently, to the floor. “What stuff! What\r\nstuff!” she ejaculated wearily. “A schoolgirl might write as good!\r\nWell, you are come,” she continued. “There,” as Mary, flung back on\r\nherself, bent timidly and kissed her, “that will do! That will do! I\r\ncan’t bear anyone near me! Don’t come too near me! Sit on that chair,\r\nwhere I can see you!”\r\n\r\nMary beat back her tears and obeyed with a quivering lip. “I hope you\r\nare better,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Better!” her mother retorted in the same peevish tone. “No, and shall\r\nnot be!” Then, with a shrill scream, “Heavens, child, what have you got\r\non?” she continued. “What have you done to yourself? You look like a\r\n_sœur de Charité!_”\r\n\r\n“I thought that I could nurse you better in this,” Mary faltered.\r\n\r\n“Nurse me!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I——”\r\n\r\n“Rubbish!” Lady Sybil exclaimed with petulant impatience. “You nurse?\r\nDon’t be silly! Who wants you to nurse me? I want you to amuse me. And\r\nyou won’t do that by dressing yourself like a dingy death’s-head moth!\r\nThere, for Heaven’s sake,” with a catch in her voice which went to\r\nMary’s heart, “don’t cry! I’m not strong enough to bear it. Tell me\r\nsomething! Tell me anything to make me laugh. How did you trick Sir\r\nRobert, child? How did you escape? That will amuse me,” with a\r\nmirthless laugh. “I wish I could see his solemn face when he hears that\r\nyou are gone!”\r\n\r\nMary explained that the summons had found her in London; that her\r\nfather was not there, but that still she had had to beat down Lady\r\nWorcester’s resistance before she could have her way and leave.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know her,” Lady Sybil said shortly.\r\n\r\n“She was very kind to me,” Mary answered.\r\n\r\n“I dare say,” in the same tone.\r\n\r\n“But she would not let me go until I gave her my address.”\r\n\r\nLady Sybil sat up sharply. “And you did that?” she shrieked. “You gave\r\nit her?”\r\n\r\n“I was obliged to give it,” Mary stammered, “or I could not have left\r\nLondon.”\r\n\r\n“Obliged? Obliged?” Lady Sybil retorted, in the same passionate tone.\r\n“Why, you fool, you might have given her fifty addresses! Any address!\r\nAny address but this! There!” Lady Sybil continued sullenly, as she\r\nsank back and pressed her handkerchief to her lips. “You’ve done it\r\nnow. You’ve excited me. Give me those drops! There! Are you blind?\r\nThose! Those! And—and sit farther from me! I can’t breathe with you\r\nclose to me!”\r\n\r\nAfter which, when Mary, almost heartbroken, had given her the medicine,\r\nand seated herself in the appointed place, she turned her face to the\r\nwall and lay silent and morose, uttering no sound but an occasional\r\nsigh of pain.\r\n\r\nMeantime, to eyes that could read, the room told her story, and told it\r\neloquently. The table beside the couch was strewn with rose-bound\r\nAnnuals and Keepsakes, and a dozen volumes bearing the labels of more\r\nthan one library; books opened only to be cast aside. Costly toys and\r\nembroidered nothings, vinaigrettes and scent-bottles, lay scattered\r\neverywhere; and on other tables, on the mantelpiece, on the floor, a\r\nlitter of similar trifles elbowed and jostled the gloomy tokens of\r\nillness. Near the invalid’s hand lay a miniature in a jewelled frame,\r\nwhile a packet of letters tied with a fragment of gold lace, and a buhl\r\ndesk half-closed upon a broken fan told the same tale of ennui, and of\r\na vanity which survived the charms on which it had rested. The lesson\r\nwas not lost on the daughter’s heart. It moved her to purest pity; and\r\npresently, wrung by a sigh more painful than usual, she crept to the\r\ncouch, sank on her knees, and pressed her cool lips to the wasted hand\r\nwhich hung from it. Even then for a time her mother did not move or\r\ntake notice. But slowly the weary sighs grew more frequent, grew to\r\nsobs—how much less poignant!—and her weak arm drew Mary’s head to her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\nAnd by-and-by the arm tightened its hold and gripped her convulsively,\r\nthe sobs grew deeper and shook the worn form at each respiration; and\r\npresently, “Ah, God, what will become of me?” burst from the depths of\r\nthe poor quaking heart, too proud hitherto to make its fear known.\r\n“What will become of me?”\r\n\r\nThat cry pierced Mary like a knife, but its confession of weakness made\r\nmother and daughter one. Her feeble arms could not avert the approach\r\nof the dark shadow, whose coming terrified though it could not change.\r\nBut what human love could do, what patient self-forgetfulness might\r\nteach, she vowed that she would do and teach; and what clinging hands\r\nmight compass to delay the end, her hands should compass. When Miss\r\nSibson’s message, informing her that it was time to return, was brought\r\nto her, she shook her head, smiling, and locked the door. “I shall be\r\nyour nurse, after all!” she said. “I shall not leave you.” And before\r\nmidnight, with a brave contentment, for which Lady Sybil’s following\r\neyes were warrant, she had taken possession of the room and all its\r\ncontents; she had tidied as much as it was good to tidy, she had knelt\r\nto heat the milk or brush the hearth, she had smoothed the pillow, and\r\nsworn a score of times that nothing, no Sir Robert, no father, no force\r\nshould tear her from this her duty, this her joy—until the end.\r\n\r\nNo memory of her dull childhood, or of the days of labour and servitude\r\nwhich she owed to the dying woman, no thought of the joys of wealth and\r\nyouth which she had lost through her, rose to mar the sincerity of her\r\nlove. Much less did such reflections trouble her on whose flighty mind\r\nthey should have rested so heavily. So far indeed was this from being\r\nthe case, that when Mary stooped to some office which the mother’s\r\nfastidiousness deemed beneath her, “How can you do that?” Lady Sybil\r\ncried peevishly. “I’ll not have you do it! Do you hear me, girl? Let\r\nsome servant see to it! What else are they for!”\r\n\r\n“But I used to do it every day at Clapham,” Mary answered cheerfully.\r\nShe had not spoken before, aware of the reproach which her words\r\nconveyed, she could have bitten her tongue.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Sybil did not wince. “Then why did you do it?” she retorted,\r\n“Why did you do it? Why were you so foolish as to stoop to such things?\r\nI’m sure you didn’t get your poor spirit from me! And Vermuyden was as\r\nstiff as a poker! But there! I remember the prince saying once that\r\nladies went out of fashion with hoops, and gentlemen with snuffboxes.\r\nYou make me think he was right. Oh, clumsy!” she continued, raising her\r\nvoice, “now you are turning the light on my face! Do you wish to see me\r\nhideous?”\r\n\r\nMary moved it. “Is that better, mother?” she asked.\r\n\r\nLady Sybil cast a resentful glance at her. “There, there, let it be!”\r\nshe said. “You can’t help it. You’re like your father. He could never\r\ndo anything right! I suppose I am doomed to have none but helpless\r\npeople about me.”\r\n\r\nAnd so on, and so on. Like many invalids, she was most lively at night,\r\nand she continued to complain through long restless hours, with the\r\ncandles burning lower and lower, and the snuffers coming into more\r\nfrequent request. Until with the chill before the dawn she fell at last\r\ninto a fitful sleep; and Mary, creeping to the close-curtained windows\r\nto cool her weary eyes, peeped out and saw the grey of the morning.\r\nOutside, the Square was beginning to discover its half-bare trees and\r\nlong straight rows of houses. Through openings, here and there, the\r\nwater glimmered mistily; and on the height facing her, the tall tower\r\nof St. Mary Redcliffe rose above the roofs and pointed skywards. Little\r\ndid Mary think what the day would bring forth in that grey deserted\r\nplace on which she looked; or in what changed conditions, under what\r\nstress of mind and heart, she would, before the sun set twice, view\r\nthat Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX\r\nTHE MAYOR’S RECEPTION IN QUEEN’S SQUARE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day, of which Mary watched the cloudy opening from her mother’s\r\nwindow, was drawing to a close; and from a house in the same Square—but\r\non the north side, whereas Miss Sibson’s was on the west—another pair\r\nof eyes looked out, while a heart, which a few hours before had been as\r\nsore as hers, rose a little at the prospect. Arthur Vaughan, ignorant\r\nof her proximity—to love’s shame be it said—sat in a window on the\r\nfirst floor of the Mansion House, and, undismayed by the occasional\r\ncrash of glass, watched the movements of the swaying, shouting, mocking\r\ncrowd; a crowd, numbering some thousands, which occupied the middle\r\nspace of the Square, as well as the roadways, clustered upon the\r\nImmortal Memory, overflowed into the side streets, and now joined in\r\none mighty roar of “Reform! Reform!” now groaned thunderously at the\r\nname of Wetherell. Behind Vaughan in the same room, the drawing-room of\r\nthe official residence, some twenty or thirty persons argued and\r\ngesticulated; at one time approaching a window to settle a debated\r\npoint, at another scattering with exclamations of anger as a stone fell\r\nor some other missile alighted among them.\r\n\r\n“Boo! Boo!” yelled the mob below. “Throw him out! Reform! Reform!”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked down on the welter of moving faces. He saw that the\r\nstone-throwers were few, and the daredevils, who at times adventured to\r\npull up the railings which guarded the forecourt, were fewer. But he\r\nsaw also that the mass sympathised with them, egged them on, and\r\napplauded their exploits. And he wondered what would happen when night\r\nfell, and wondered again why the peaceable citizens who wrangled behind\r\nhim made light of the position. The glass was flying, here and there an\r\niron bar had vanished from the railings, night was approaching. For him\r\nit was very well. He had accompanied Brereton to Bristol to see what\r\nwould happen, and for his part, if the adventure proved to be of the\r\nfirst class, so much the better. But the good pursy citizens behind\r\nhim, who, when they were not deafening the little Mayor with their\r\ncounsels, were making a jest of the turmoil, had wives and daughters,\r\ngoods and houses within reach. And in their place he felt that he would\r\nhave been far from easy.\r\n\r\nBy and by it appeared that some of them shared his feelings. For\r\npresently, in a momentary lull of the babel outside, a voice he knew\r\nrose above those in the room.\r\n\r\n“Nothing? You call it nothing?” Mr. Cooke—for his was the voice—cried.\r\n“Nothing, that his Majesty’s Judge has been hooted and pelted from\r\nTotterdown to the Guildhall? Nothing, that the Recorder of Bristol has\r\nbeen hunted like a criminal from the Guildhall to this place! You call\r\nit nothing, sir, that his Majesty’s Commission has been flouted for six\r\nhours past by all the riffraff of the Docks? And with half of decent\r\nBristol looking on and applauding!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, no!” the little Mayor remonstrated. “Not applauding, Mr.\r\nCooke!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, applauding!” Cooke retorted with vigour.\r\n\r\n“And teach Wetherell a lesson!” someone in the background muttered.\r\n\r\nThe man spoke low, but Cooke heard the words and wheeled about. “There,\r\nsir, there!” he cried, stuttering in his indignation. “What do you say\r\nto that? Here, in your presence, the King’s Judge is insulted. But I\r\nwarn you,” he continued, “I warn you all! You are playing with fire!\r\nYou are laughing in your sleeves, but you’ll cry in your shirts! You,\r\nMr. Mayor, I call upon you to do your duty! I call upon you to summon\r\nthe military and give the order to clear the streets before worse comes\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t—I really don’t—think that it is necessary,” the Mayor answered\r\npacifically. “I have seen as bad as this at half a dozen elections, Mr.\r\nCooke.”\r\n\r\nThe Town-clerk, a tall, thin man, who still wore his gown though he had\r\nlaid aside his wig, struck in. “Quite true, Mr. Mayor!” he said. “The\r\nfact is, the crowd thinks itself hardly used on these occasions if it\r\nis not allowed to break the windows and do a little mischief on the\r\nlower floor.”\r\n\r\n“By G—d, I’d teach it a lesson then!” Cooke retorted. “It seems to me\r\nit is time someone did!”\r\n\r\nTwo or three expressed the same opinion, though they did so with less\r\ndecision. But the main part smiled at Cooke’s heat as at a foolish\r\ndisplay of temper. “I’ve seen as much half a dozen times,” said one,\r\nshrugging his shoulders. “And no harm done!”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen worse!” another answered. “And after all,” the speaker added\r\nwith a wink, “it is good for the glaziers.”\r\n\r\nFortunately, Cooke did not hear this last. But Vaughan heard it, and he\r\njudged that the rioters had their backers within as well as without;\r\nand that within, as without, the notion prevailed that the Government\r\nwould not be best pleased if the movement were too roughly checked. An\r\nold proverb about the wisdom of dealing with the beginnings of mischief\r\noccurred to him. But he supposed that the authorities knew their\r\nbusiness and Bristol, and, more correctly than he, could gauge the mob\r\nand the danger, of both of which they made so light.\r\n\r\nStill he wondered. And he wondered more three minutes later. Two\r\nservants brought in lights. Unfortunately the effect of these was to\r\nreveal the interior of the room to the mob, and the change was the\r\nsignal for a fusillade of stones so much more serious and violent than\r\nanything which had gone before that a quick _sauve qui peut_ took\r\nplace. Vaughan was dislodged with the others—he could do no good by\r\nremaining; and in two minutes the room was empty, and the mob were\r\ncelebrating their victory with peals of titanic laughter, accompanied\r\nby fierce cries of “Throw him out! Throw out the d——d Recorder!\r\nReform!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the company, with one broken head and one or two pale faces,\r\nhad taken refuge on the landing behind the drawing-room, the stairs\r\nascending to which were guarded by a reserve of constables. Vaughan saw\r\nthat the Mayor and his satellites were beginning to look at one\r\nanother, and leaning, quietly observant, against the wall, he noticed\r\nthat more than one was shaken. Still the little Mayor retained his\r\ngood-humour. “Oh, dear, dear!” he said indulgently. “This is too bad!\r\nReally too bad!”\r\n\r\n“We’d better go upstairs,” Sergeant Ludlow, the Town-clerk, suggested.\r\n“We can see what passes as well from that floor as from this, and with\r\nless risk!”\r\n\r\n“No, but really this is growing serious,” a third said timidly. “It’s\r\ntoo bad, this.”\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken, and the Mayor was still standing undecided, as\r\nif he did not quite like the idea of retreat, when two persons, one\r\nwith his head bandaged, came quickly up the stairs. “Where’s the\r\nMayor?” cried the first. And then, “Mr. Mayor, they are pushing us too\r\nhard,” said the second, an officer of special constables. “We must have\r\nhelp, or they will pull the house about our ears.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, nonsense!”\r\n\r\n“But it’s not nonsense, sir,” the man answered angrily.\r\n\r\n“But——”\r\n\r\n“You must read the Riot Act, sir,” the other, who was the\r\nUnder-Sheriff, chimed in. “And the sooner the better, Mr. Mayor,” he\r\nadded with decision. “We’ve half a dozen men badly hurt. In my opinion\r\nyou should send for the military.”\r\n\r\nThe group on the landing looked aghast at one another. What, danger?\r\nReally—danger? Half a dozen men badly hurt? Then one made an effort to\r\ncarry it off. “Send for the military?” he gasped. “Oh, but that is\r\nabsurd! That would only make matters worse!”\r\n\r\nThe others did not speak, and the Mayor in particular looked upset.\r\nPerhaps for the first time he appreciated the responsibility which lay\r\non his shoulders. Meanwhile Vaughan saw all; and Cooke also, and the\r\nlatter laughed maliciously. “Perhaps you will listen now,” he said with\r\nan ill-natured chuckle. “You would not listen to me!”\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear,” the Mayor quavered. “Is it really as serious as that, Mr.\r\nHare?” He turned to the Town-clerk. “What do you advise?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I think with Mr. Hare that you had better read the Riot Act, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, I’ll come down! I’ll come down at once,” the Mayor assented\r\nwith spirit. “Only,” he continued, looking round him, “I beg that some\r\ngentleman known to be on the side of Reform, will come with me. Who has\r\nthe Riot Act?”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Burges. Where is he?”\r\n\r\n“I am here, sir,” replied the gentleman named. “I am quite ready, Mr.\r\nMayor. If you will say a few words to the crowd; I am sure they will\r\nlisten. Let us go down!”\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes later the same group, but with disordered clothes and\r\nsickly faces—and as to Mr. Burges, with a broken head—were gathered\r\nagain on the landing. In those twenty minutes, despite the magic of the\r\nRiot Act, the violence of the mob had grown rather than diminished.\r\nThey were beginning to talk of burning the Mansion House, they were\r\ncalling for straw, they were demanding lights. Darkness had fallen,\r\ntoo, and there could be no question now that the position was serious.\r\nThe Mayor, who, below stairs, had shown no lack of courage, turned to\r\nthe Town-clerk. “Ought I to call out the military?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I think that we should take Sir Charles Wetherell’s opinion,” the\r\ntall, thin man answered, deftly shifting the burden from his own\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“The sooner Sir Charles is gone the better, I should say!” Cooke said\r\nbluntly. “If we don’t want to have his blood on our heads.”\r\n\r\n“I am with Mr. Cooke there,” the Under-Sheriff struck in. He was\r\nresponsible for the Judge’s safety, and he spoke strongly. “Sir Charles\r\nshould be got away,” he continued. “That’s the first thing to be done.\r\nHe cannot hold the Assizes, and I say frankly that I will not be\r\nresponsible if he stays.”\r\n\r\n“Jonah!” someone muttered with a sneering laugh.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor turned about. “That’s very improper!” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s very improper to send a Judge who is a politician!” the voice\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“And against the Bill!” a second jeered.\r\n\r\n“For shame! For shame!” the Mayor cried.\r\n\r\n“And I fancy, sir,” the Under-Sheriff struck in with heat, “that the\r\ngentlemen who have just spoken—I think I can guess their names—will be\r\nsorry before morning! They will find that it is easier to kindle a fire\r\nthan to put it out! But—silence, gentlemen! Silence! Here is Sir\r\nCharles!”\r\n\r\nWetherell had that moment opened the door of his private room, of which\r\nthe window looked to the back. His face betrayed his surprise on\r\nfinding twenty or thirty persons huddled in disorder at the head of the\r\nstairs. The two lights which had survived the flight from the\r\ndrawing-room flared in the draught of the shattered windows, and the\r\nwavering illumination gave a sinister cast to the scene. The dull\r\nrattle of stones on the floor of the rooms exposed to the Square—varied\r\nat times by a roar of voices or a rush of feet in the hall\r\nbelow—suggested that the danger was near at hand, and that the\r\nassailants might at any moment break into the building.\r\n\r\nNevertheless Sir Charles showed no signs of fear. After letting his\r\neyes travel over the group, “How long is this going on, Mr.\r\nUnder-Sheriff?” he asked, plunging his hands deep in his breeches\r\npockets.\r\n\r\n“Well, Sir Charles——”\r\n\r\n“They seem,” with a touch of sternness, “to be carrying the jest rather\r\ntoo far.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Cooke,” the Mayor said, “wishes me to call out the military.”\r\n\r\nWetherell shook his head. “No, no,” he said. “The occasion is not so\r\nserious as to justify that. You cannot say that life is in danger?”\r\n\r\nThe Under-Sheriff put himself forward. “I can say, sir,” he answered\r\nfirmly, “that yours is in danger. And in serious danger!”\r\n\r\nWetherell planted his feet further apart, and thrust his hands lower\r\ninto his pockets. “Oh, no, no,” he said.\r\n\r\n“It is yes, yes, sir,” the Under-Sheriff replied bluntly. “Unless you\r\nleave the house I cannot be responsible! I cannot, indeed, Sir\r\nCharles.”\r\n\r\n“But——”\r\n\r\n“Listen, sir! If you don’t wish a very terrible catastrophe to happen,\r\nyou must go! By G—d you must!” the Under-Sheriff repeated, forgetting\r\nhis manners.\r\n\r\nThe noise below had swollen suddenly. Cries, blows, and shrieks rose up\r\nthe staircase, and announced that at any moment the party above might\r\nhave to defend their lives. At the prospect suddenly presented, respect\r\nfor dignities took flight; panic seized the majority. Constables,\r\nthrusting aldermen and magistrates aside, raced up the stairs, and\r\nbundled down again laden with beds with which to block the windows:\r\nwhile the picked men who had hitherto guarded the foot of the staircase\r\nleft their posts in charge of two or three of the wounded, who groaned\r\ndismally. Apparently the mob had broken into part of the ground floor,\r\nand were with difficulty held at bay.\r\n\r\nOne of the party struck his hand on the balusters—it was Mr. Cooke. “By\r\nHeavens!” he said, “this is what comes of your d——d Reform! Your d——d\r\nReform! We shall all be murdered, every man of us! Murdered!”\r\n\r\n“For God’s sake, Mr. Mayor,” cried a quavering voice, “send for the\r\nmilitary.”\r\n\r\n“Ay, ay! the soldiers. Send for the soldiers, sir!” echoed two or\r\nthree.\r\n\r\n“Certainly I will,” said the Mayor, who was cooler than most. “Who will\r\ngo?”\r\n\r\nA man volunteered. On which Vaughan, who had so far remained silent,\r\nstepped forward. “Sir Charles,” he said, “you must retire. Your duties\r\nare at an end, and your presence hampers the defence. Permit me to\r\nescort you. I am unknown here, and can pass through the streets.”\r\n\r\nWetherell, as brave, stout and as solid a man as any in England,\r\nhesitated. But he saw that it would soon be everyone for himself; and\r\nin that event he was doomed. The din was waxing louder and more\r\nmenacing; the group on the stairs was melting away. In terror on their\r\nown account, the officials were beginning to forget his presence.\r\nSeveral had already disappeared, seeking to save themselves, this way\r\nand that. Others were going. Every moment the confusion increased, and\r\nthe panic. He gave way. “You think I ought to go, Vaughan?” he asked in\r\na low voice.\r\n\r\n“I do, sir,” Vaughan answered. And, entering the Recorder’s room, he\r\nbrought out Sir Charles’s hat and cloak and hastily thrust them on him,\r\nscarcely anyone else attending to them. As he did this his eye alighted\r\non a constable’s staff which lay on the floor where its owner had\r\ndropped it. Thinking that, as he was without arms, he might as well\r\npossess himself of it, Vaughan left Wetherell’s side and went to pick\r\nit up. At that moment a roar of sound, as sudden as the explosion of a\r\ngun, burst up the staircase. Two or three cried in a frenzied way that\r\nthe mob were coming; some fled this way, some that, a few to windows at\r\nthe back, more to the upper story, while a handful obeyed Vaughan’s\r\ncall to stand and hold the head of the stairs. For a brief space all\r\nwas disorder and—save in his neighbourhood—panic. Then a voice below\r\nshouted that the soldiers were come, and a general “Thank God! Not a\r\nmoment too soon!” was heard on all sides. Vaughan made sure that it was\r\ntrue, and then he turned to rejoin Sir Charles.\r\n\r\nBut Wetherell had vanished, and no one could say in which direction.\r\nVaughan hurried upstairs and along the passages in anxious search; but\r\nin vain. One told him that Sir Charles had left by a window at the\r\nback; another, that he had been seen going upstairs with the\r\nUnder-Sheriff. He could learn nothing certain; and he was asking\r\nhimself what he should do next, when the sound of cheering reached his\r\near.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” he asked a man who met him as he descended the stairs\r\nfrom the second floor.\r\n\r\n“They are cheering the soldiers,” the man replied.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to hear it!” Vaughan exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I’d say so too,” the other rejoined glumly, “if I was certain on which\r\nside the soldiers were! But you’re wanted, sir, in the drawing-room.\r\nThe Mayor asked me to find you.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” Vaughan said, and without delay he followed the messenger\r\nto the room he had named. Here, with the relics of the fray about them,\r\nhe found the Mayor and four or five officials who looked woefully\r\nshaken and flustered. With them were Brereton and the Honourable Bob,\r\nboth in uniform. The stone-throwing had ceased, for the front of the\r\nhouse was now guarded by a double line of troopers in red cloaks.\r\nLights, too, had been brought, and in the main the danger seemed to be\r\nover. But about this council there was none of that lightheartedness,\r\nnone of that easy contempt which had characterised the one held in the\r\nsame room an hour or two before. The lesson had been learnt in a\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor looked at Vaughan as he entered. “Is this the gentleman?” he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that is the gentleman who got us together at the head of the\r\nstairs,” a person, a stranger to Vaughan, answered. “If he,” the man\r\ncontinued, “were put in charge of the constables, who are at present at\r\nsixes and sevens, we might manage something.”\r\n\r\nA voice in the background mentioned that it was Mr. Vaughan, the Member\r\nfor Chippinge. “I shall be glad to do anything I can,” Vaughan said.\r\n\r\n“In support of the military,” the tall, thin Town-clerk interposed, in\r\na decided tone. “That must be understood. Eh, Mr. Burges?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” the City Solicitor answered. And they both looked at\r\nColonel Brereton, who, somewhat to Vaughan’s surprise, had not\r\nacknowledged his presence.\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course,” said the Mayor pacifically. “That is\r\nunderstood. I am quite sure that Colonel Brereton will use his utmost\r\nforce to clear the streets and quiet the city.”\r\n\r\n“I shall do what I think right,” Brereton replied, standing up\r\nstraight, with his hand on his sword-hilt, and looking, among the\r\ndisordered citizens, like a Spanish hidalgo among a troop of peasants.\r\n“I shall do what is right,” he repeated stubbornly; and Vaughan,\r\nknowing the man well, perceived that, quiet as he seemed, he was\r\nlabouring under strong excitement. “I shall walk my horses about. The\r\ncrowd are perfectly good-humoured, and only need to be kept moving.”\r\n\r\nThe Town-clerk exchanged a glance with a neighbour. “But do you think,\r\nsir,” he said, “that that will be sufficient? You are aware, I suppose,\r\nthat great damage has been done already, and that had your troop not\r\narrived when it did many lives might have been sacrificed?”\r\n\r\n“That is all I shall do,” Brereton answered. “Unless,” with a faint\r\nring of contempt in his tone, “the Mayor gives me an express and\r\nwritten order to attack the people.”\r\n\r\nThe Mayor’s face was a picture. “I?” he gasped.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“But I—I could not take that responsibility on myself,” the Mayor\r\ncried. “I couldn’t, I really couldn’t!” he repeated, taken aback by the\r\nburden it was proposed to put on him. “I can’t judge, Colonel\r\nBrereton—I am not a military man—whether it is necessary or not.”\r\n\r\n“I should consider it unwise,” Brereton replied formally.\r\n\r\n“Very good! Then—then you must use your discretion.”\r\n\r\n“Just so. That’s what I supposed,” Brereton replied, not masking his\r\ncontempt for the vacillation of those about him. “In that case I shall\r\npursue the line of action I have indicated. I shall walk my horses up\r\nand down. The crowd are perfectly good-humoured. What is it, pray?”\r\n\r\nHe turned, frowning. A man had entered the room and was whispering in\r\nthe Town-clerk’s ear. The latter straightened himself with a heated\r\nface. “You call them good-humoured, sir?” he said. “I hear that two of\r\nyour men, Colonel Brereton, have just been brought in severely wounded.\r\nI do not know whether you call that good-humour?”\r\n\r\nBrereton looked a little discomposed. “They must have brought it on\r\nthemselves,” he said, “by some rashness. Your constables have no\r\ndiscretion.”\r\n\r\n“I think you should at least clear the Square and the neighbouring\r\nstreets,” the Town-clerk persisted.\r\n\r\n“I have indicated what I shall do,” Brereton replied, with a gloomy\r\nlook. “And I am prepared to be responsible for the safety of the city.\r\nIf you wish me to act beyond my judgment, the civil power must give me\r\nan express and written order.”\r\n\r\nStill the Mayor and those about him looked uneasy, though they did not\r\ndare to do what Brereton suggested. The howls of the rabble still rang\r\nin their ears, and before their eyes they had the black, gaping\r\ncasements, through which an ominous murmur entered. They had waited\r\nlong before calling in the Military, they had hesitated long; for\r\nPeterloo had erased Waterloo from the memory of an ungrateful\r\ngeneration, and men, secure abroad and straining after Reform at home,\r\nheld a red-coat in small favour, if not in suspicion. But having called\r\nthe red-coats in, they looked for something more than this, for some\r\nvindication of the law and the civil power, some stroke which would\r\ncast terror into the hearts of misdoers. The Town-clerk, in particular,\r\nhad his doubts, and when no one else spoke he put them into words.\r\n\r\n“May I ask,” he said formally, “if you have any orders, Colonel\r\nBrereton, from the Secretary of State or the Horse Guards, which\r\nprevent you from obeying the directions of the magistrates?”\r\n\r\nBrereton looked at him sternly.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, “I am prepared to obey your orders, stated in the manner\r\nI have laid down. Then the responsibility will not lie with me.”\r\n\r\nBut the Mayor stepped back. “I couldn’t take it on myself, sir. I—God\r\nknows what the consequences might be!” He looked round piteously. “We\r\ndon’t want another Manchester massacre.”\r\n\r\n“I fancy,” Brereton answered grimly, “that if we have another\r\nManchester business, it will go ill with those who sign the order!\r\nTimes are changed since ’19, gentlemen—and governments! And I think we\r\nunderstand that. You leave it to me, then, gentlemen?”\r\n\r\nNo one spoke.\r\n\r\n“Very good,” he continued. “If your constables will do their duty with\r\ndiscretion—and you could not have a better man to command them than Mr.\r\nVaughan, but he ought to be going about it now—I will answer for the\r\npeace of the city.”\r\n\r\n“But—but we shall see you again, Colonel Brereton,” the Mayor cried in\r\nsome agitation.\r\n\r\n“See me, sir?” Brereton answered contemptuously.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, you can see me, if you wish to! But——” He shrugged his\r\nshoulders, and turned away without finishing the sentence.\r\n\r\nVaughan, when he heard that, knew that, cool as Brereton seemed, he was\r\nnot himself. A moody stubbornness had taken the place of last night’s\r\nexcitement; but that was all. And as the party trooped downstairs—he\r\nhad requested the Mayor to say a few words, placing the constables\r\nunder his control—he swallowed his private feelings and approached\r\nFlixton.\r\n\r\n“Flixton,” he whispered, throwing what friendliness he could into his\r\nvoice. “Do you think Brereton’s right?”\r\n\r\nFlixton turned an ill-humoured face towards him, and dragged at his\r\nsword-belt. “Oh, I don’t know,” he said irritably. “It’s his business,\r\nand I suppose he can judge. There’s a deuce of a crowd, I know, and if\r\nwe go charging into it we shall be swallowed up in a twinkling!”\r\n\r\n“But it has been whispered to me,” Vaughan replied, “that he told the\r\npeople on his way here that he’s for Reform. Isn’t it unwise to let\r\nthem think that the soldiers may side with them?”\r\n\r\n“Fine talking,” Flixton answered with a sneer. “And God knows if we had\r\nfive hundred men, or three hundred, I’d agree. But what can sixty or\r\neighty men do galloping over slippery pavements in the dark? And if we\r\nfire and kill a dozen, the Government will hang us to clear themselves!\r\nAnd these d——d nigger-drivers and sugar-boilers behind us would be the\r\nfirst to swear against us!”\r\n\r\nVaughan had his own opinion. But they had to part then. Flixton, in his\r\nblue uniform—there were two troops present, one of the 3rd Dragoon\r\nGuards in red, and one of the 14th Dragoons in blue—went out by\r\nBrereton’s side with his spurs ringing on the stone pavement and his\r\nsword clanking. He was not acting with his troop, but as the Colonel’s\r\naide-de-camp. Meanwhile Vaughan, who could not see the old blue uniform\r\nwithout a pang, went with the Mayor to marshal the constables.\r\n\r\nOf these no more than eighty remained, and with little stomach for the\r\ntask before them. This task, indeed, notwithstanding the check which\r\nthe arrival of the troopers had given the mob, was far from easy. The\r\nground-floor of the Mansion House looked like a place taken by storm\r\nand sacked. The railings which guarded the forecourt were gone, and\r\neven the wall on which they stood had been demolished to furnish\r\nmissiles. The doorways and windows, where they were not clumsily\r\nbarricaded, were apertures inviting entrance. In one room lay a pile of\r\nstraw ready for lighting. In another lay half a dozen wounded men.\r\nEverywhere the cold wind, blowing off the water of the Welsh Back,\r\nentered a dozen openings and extinguished the flares as quickly as they\r\ncould be lighted, casting now one room and now another into black\r\nshadow.\r\n\r\nBut if the men had little heart for further exertions, Vaughan’s\r\nmanhood rose the higher to meet the call. Bringing his soldier’s\r\ntraining into play, in a few minutes he had his force divided into four\r\ncompanies, each under a leader. Two he held in reserve, bidding them\r\nget what rest they could; with the other two he manned the forecourt,\r\nand guarded the flank which lay open to the Welsh Back. And as long as\r\nthe troopers rode up and down within a stone’s-throw all was well. But\r\nwhen the soldiers passed to the other side of the Square a rush was\r\nmade on the house—mainly by a gang of the low Irish of the\r\nneighbourhood—and many a stout blow was struck before the rabble, who\r\nthirsted for the strong ale and wine in the cellars, could be dislodged\r\nfrom the forecourt and driven to a distance. The danger to life was not\r\ngreat, though the tale of wounded grew steadily; nor could the post of\r\nChief Constable be held to confer much honour on one who so short a\r\ntime before had dreamt of Cabinets and portfolios, and of a Senate\r\nhanging on his words. But the joy of conflict was something to a stout\r\nheart, and the sense of success. Something, too, it was to feel that\r\nwhere he stood his men stood also; and that where he was not, the\r\nIrish, with their brickbats and iron bars, made a way. There was a big\r\nlout, believed by some to be a Brummagem man and a tool of the\r\nPolitical Union, who more than once led on the assailants; and when\r\nVaughan found that this man shunned him and chose the side where he was\r\nnot, that too was a joy.\r\n\r\n“After all, this is what I am good for,” he told himself as he stood to\r\ntake breath after a _mêlée_ which was at once the most serious and the\r\nlast. “I was a fool to leave the regiment,” he continued, staunching a\r\ntrickle of blood which ran from a cut on his cheek bone. “For, after\r\nall, better a good blow than a bad speech! Better, perhaps, a good blow\r\nthan all the speeches, good and bad!” And in the heat of the moment he\r\nswung his staff. Then—then he thought of Mary and of Flixton, and his\r\nheart sank, and his joy was at an end.\r\n\r\n“Don’t think they’ll try us again, sir,” said an old pensioner, who had\r\nconstituted himself his orderly, and who had known the neigh of the\r\nwar-horse in the Peninsula. “If we had had you at the beginning we’d\r\nhave had no need of the old Blues, nor the Third either!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that’s rubbish!” Vaughan replied. But he owned the flattery, and\r\nhis heart warmed to the pensioner, whose prediction proved to be\r\ncorrect. The crowd melted slowly but certainly after that. By eleven\r\no’clock there were but a couple of hundred in the Square. By twelve,\r\neven these were gone. A half-dozen troopers, and as many\r\ntatterdemalions, slinking about the dark corners, were all that\r\nremained of the combatants; and the Mayor, with many words, presented\r\nVaughan with the thanks of the city for his services.\r\n\r\n“It is gratifying, Mr. Vaughan,” he added, “to find that Colonel\r\nBrereton was right.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” Vaughan agreed. And he took his leave, carrying off his staff\r\nfor a memento.\r\n\r\nHe was very weary, and it was not the shortest way to the White Lion,\r\nyet his feet carried him across the dark Square and past the Immortal\r\nMemory to the front of Miss Sibson’s house. It showed no lights to the\r\nSquare, but in a first-floor window of the next house he marked a faint\r\nradiance as of a shaded taper, and the outline of a head—doubtless the\r\nhead of someone looking out to make sure that the disorder was at an\r\nend. He saw, but love was at fault. No inner voice told him that the\r\nhead was Mary’s! No thrill revealed to him that at that very moment,\r\nwith her brow pressed to the cold pane, she was thinking of him! None!\r\nWith a sigh, and a farther fall from the lightheartedness of an hour\r\nbefore, he went his way.\r\n\r\nBroad Street was quiet, but half a dozen persons were gathered outside\r\nthe White Lion. They were listening: and one of them told him, as he\r\npassed in, that the Blues, in beating back a party from the Council\r\nHouse, a short time before, had shot one of the rioters. In the hall he\r\nfound several groups debating some point with heat, but they fell\r\nsilent when they saw him, one nudging another; and he fancied that they\r\npaid especial attention to him. As he moved towards the office, a man\r\ndetached himself from them and approached him with a formal air.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Vaughan, I think?” he said.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Mr. Arthur Vaughan?” the man, who was a complete stranger to Vaughan,\r\nrepeated. “Member of Parliament for Chippinge, I believe?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Reform Member?”\r\n\r\nVaughan eyed him narrowly. “If you are one of my constituents,” he said\r\ndrily, “I will answer that question.”\r\n\r\n“I am not one,” the man rejoined, with a little less confidence. “But\r\nit’s my business, nevertheless, to warn you, Mr. Vaughan, in your own\r\ninterests, that the part you have been taking here will not commend you\r\nto them! You have been handling the people very roughly, I am told.\r\nVery roughly! Now, I am Mr. Here——”\r\n\r\n“You may be Mr. Here or Mr. There,” Vaughan said, cutting him short—but\r\nvery quietly. “But if you say another word to me, I will throw you\r\nthrough that door for your impudence! That is all. Now—have you any\r\nmore to say?”\r\n\r\nThe man tried to carry it off. For there was sniggering behind him. But\r\nVaughan’s blood was up, the agitator read it in the young man’s eye,\r\nand being a man of words, not deeds, he fell back. Vaughan went up to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI\r\nSUNDAY IN BRISTOL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was far from Vaughan’s humour to play the bully, and before he had\r\neven reached his bedroom, which looked to the back, he repented of his\r\nvehemence. Between that and the natural turmoil of his feelings he lay\r\nlong waking; and twice, in a stillness which proclaimed that all was\r\nwell, he heard the Bristol clocks tell the hour. After all, then,\r\nBrereton had been right! For himself, had the command been his, he\r\nwould have adopted more strenuous measures. He would have tried to put\r\nfear into the mob before the riot reached its height. And had he done\r\nso, how dire might have been the consequences! How many homes might at\r\nthis moment be mourning his action, how many innocent persons be\r\nsuffering pain and misery!\r\n\r\nWhereas Brereton, the strong, quiet man, resisting importunity,\r\nshunning haste, keeping his head where others wavered, had carried the\r\ncity through its trouble, with scarce the loss of a single life. Truly\r\nhe was one whom\r\n\r\n_Non civium ardor prava jubentium_,\r\n\r\n_Non vultus instantis tyranni_\r\n\r\n_Mente quatit solida!_\r\n\r\n\r\nVaughan thought of him with a new respect, and of himself with a new\r\nhumility. He was forced to acknowledge that even in that field of\r\naction which he had quitted, and to which he was now inclined to\r\nreturn, he was not likely to pick up a marshal’s bâton.\r\n\r\nHe slept at length, and long and heavily, awaking towards ten o’clock\r\nwith aching limbs and a cheek so sore that it brought all that had\r\npassed to instant recollection. He found his hot water at his door, and\r\nhe dressed slowly and despondently, feeling the reaction and thinking\r\nof Mary, and of that sunny morning, six months back, when he had looked\r\ninto Broad Street from a window of this very house, and dreamed of a\r\nmodest bonnet and a sweet blushing face. An hour after that, he\r\nremembered, he had happened on the Honourable—oh, d—— Flixton! All his\r\ntroubles had started from that unlucky meeting with him.\r\n\r\nHe found his breakfast laid in the next room, the coffee and bacon in a\r\nJapan cat by the fire. He ate and drank in an atmosphere of gloomy\r\nretrospect. If he had never met Flixton! If he had not gone to that\r\nunlucky dinner at Chippinge! If he had spoken to her in Parliament\r\nStreet! If—if—if! The bells of half a dozen churches were ringing,\r\ndrumming his regrets into him; and he stood awhile irresolute, looking\r\nthrough the window. The inn-yard, which was all the prospect the window\r\ncommanded, was empty; an old liver-and-white pointer, scratching itself\r\nin a corner, was the only living thing in it. But while he looked,\r\nwondering if the dog had been a good dog in its time, two men came\r\nrunning into the yard with every sign of haste and pressure. One, in a\r\nyellow jacket, flung himself against a stable door and vanished within,\r\nleaving the door open. The other pounced on a chaise, one of half a\r\ndozen ranged under a shed, and by main force dragged it into the open.\r\n\r\nThe men’s actions impressed Vaughan with a vague uneasiness. He\r\nlistened. Was it fancy, or did he catch the sound of a distant shot?\r\nAnd—there seemed to be an odd murmur in the air. He seized his hat, put\r\non his caped coat—for a cold drizzle was falling—and went downstairs.\r\n\r\nThe hall was empty, but through the open doorway he could see a knot of\r\npeople, standing outside, looking up the street. He made for the\r\nthreshold, and asked the rearmost of the starers what it was.\r\n\r\n“Eh, what is it?” the man answered volubly. “Oh, they’re gone! It’s\r\ntrue enough! And such a crowd as was never seen, I’m told—stoning them,\r\nand shouting ‘Bloody Blues!’ after them. They’re gone right away to\r\nKeynsham, and glad to be there with whole bones!”\r\n\r\n“But what is it?” Vaughan asked impatiently. “What has happened, my\r\nman? Who’re gone?”\r\n\r\nThe man turned for the first time, and saw who it was. “You have not\r\nheard, sir?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Not a word.”\r\n\r\n“Not that the people have risen? And most part pulled down the Mansion\r\nHouse? Ay, first thing this morning, sir! They say old Pinney, the\r\nMayor, got out at the back just in time or he’d have been murdered!\r\nHe’s had to send the military away—anyways, the Blues who killed the\r\nlad last night on the Pithay.”\r\n\r\n“Impossible!” Vaughan exclaimed, turning red with anger. “You cannot\r\nhave heard aright.”\r\n\r\n“It’s as true as true!” the man replied, rubbing his hands in\r\nexcitement. “As for me,” he continued, “I was always for Reform! And\r\nthis will teach the Lords a lesson! They’ll know our mind now, and that\r\nWetherell’s a liar, begging your pardon, sir. And the old Corporation’s\r\nnot much better. A set of Tories mostly! If the Welsh Back drinks their\r\ncellars dry it won’t hurt me, nor Bristol.”\r\n\r\nVaughan was too sharply surprised to rebuke the man. Could the story be\r\ntrue! And if it were, what was Brereton doing? He could not have been\r\nso foolish as to halve his force in obedience to the people he was sent\r\nto check! But the murmur in the air was a fact, and past the end of the\r\nstreet men were running in anything but a Sunday fashion.\r\n\r\nHe went back to his room and pocketed his staff. Then he descended\r\nagain and was on his way out, when a person belonging to the house\r\nstopped him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Vaughan,” she said earnestly, “don’t go, sir. You are known after\r\nlast night and will come to harm. You will indeed, sir. And you can do\r\nno good. My father says that nothing can be done until to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n“I will take care of myself,” he replied, lightly. But his eyes thanked\r\nher. He pushed his way through the gazers at the door, and set off\r\ntowards Queen’s Square.\r\n\r\nAt every door men and women were standing looking out. In the distance\r\nhe could hear cheering, which waxed louder and more insistent as,\r\nprudently avoiding the narrower lanes, he passed down Clare Street to\r\nBroad Quay, from which there was an entrance to the northwest corner of\r\nthe Square. Alongside the quay, which was fringed with warehouses and\r\nsheds, and from which the huge city crane towered up, lay a line of\r\nbrigs and schooners; the masts of the more distant of these tapering to\r\nvanishing points in the mist which lay upon the water. At the moment,\r\nhowever, Vaughan had no eye for them. He saw them, but his thoughts\r\nwere with the rioters, and in a twinkling he was within the Square, and\r\nseeing what was to be seen.\r\n\r\nHe judged that there were not more than fifteen hundred persons\r\npresent. Of the whole about one-half belonged to the lowest class.\r\nThese were gathered about the Mansion House, some drinking before it,\r\nothers bearing up liquor from the cellars, while others again were\r\ntearing out the woodwork of the casements, or wantonly flinging the\r\nlast remnants of furniture from the windows. The second moiety of the\r\ncrowd, less reckless or of higher position, looked on as at a show; or\r\nnow and again, at the bidding of some active rioter, raised a cheer for\r\nReform, “The King and Reform! Reform!”\r\n\r\nThere was nothing dreadful, nothing awe-inspiring in the sight. Yet it\r\nwas such a sight, for an English city on a Sunday morning, that\r\nVaughan’s gorge rose at it. A hundred resolute men might have put the\r\nmob to flight. And meantime, on every point of vantage, on Redcliffe\r\nParade, eastward of the Square, on College Green, and Brandon Hill, to\r\nthe westward of it, thousands stood looking in silence on the scene,\r\nand by their supineness encouraging the work of destruction.\r\n\r\nHe thought for a moment of pushing to the front and trying what a few\r\nreasonable words would effect. But as he advanced, his eye caught a\r\ngleam of colour, and in the corner of the Square, most remote from the\r\ndisorder, he discovered a handful of dragoons, seated motionless in\r\ntheir saddles, watching the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe folly of this struck him dumb. And he hurried, at a white heat,\r\nacross the Square to remonstrate. He was about to speak to the sergeant\r\nin charge, when Flixton, with a civilian cloak masking his uniform,\r\nrode up to the men at a foot-pace. Vaughan turned to him instead.\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens, man!” he cried, too hot to mince his words or remember\r\nat the moment what there was between him and Flixton, “What’s Brereton\r\ndoing? What has happened! It is not true that he has sent the\r\nFourteenth away?”\r\n\r\nFlixton looked down at him sulkily. “He’s sent ’em to Keynsham,” he\r\nsaid, shortly. “If he hadn’t, the crowd would have been out of hand!”\r\n\r\n“But what do you call them now?” Vaughan retorted, with angry sarcasm.\r\n“They are destroying a public building in broad daylight! Aren’t they\r\nsufficiently out of hand?”\r\n\r\nFlixton shrugged his shoulders, but did not answer. He was flushed and\r\nhas manner was surly.\r\n\r\n“And your squad here, looking on and doing nothing? They’re worse than\r\nuseless!” Vaughan continued. “They encourage the beggars! They’d be\r\nbetter in their quarters than here! Better at Keynsham,” he added\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n“So I’ve told him,” Flixton answered, taking the last words literally.\r\n“He sent me to see how things are looking. And a d——d pleasant way this\r\nis of spending a wet Sunday!” On which, without more, having seen,\r\napparently, what he came to see, he turned his horse to go out of the\r\nSquare by the Broad Quay.\r\n\r\nVaughan walked a few paces beside the horse. “But, Flixton, press him,”\r\nhe said urgently; “press him, man, to act! To do something!”\r\n\r\n“That’s all very fine,” the Honourable Bob answered churlishly, “but\r\nBrereton’s in command. And you don’t catch me interfering. I am not\r\ngoing to take the responsibility off his shoulders.”\r\n\r\n“But think what may happen to-night!” Vaughan urged. Already he saw\r\nthat the throng was growing denser and its movements less random.\r\nSomewhere in the heart of it a man was speaking. “Think what may happen\r\nafter dark, if they are as bad as this in daylight?”\r\n\r\nFlixton looked askance at him. “Ten to one, only what happened last\r\nnight,” he answered. “You all croaked then; but Brereton was right.”\r\n\r\nVaughan saw that he argued to no purpose. For Flixton, forward and\r\npositive in small things and on the surface, was discovered by the\r\nemergency; all that now remained of his usual self-assertion was a\r\nsense of injury. Vaughan inquired, instead, where he would find\r\nBrereton, and as by this time the crowd had clearly outgrown the\r\ncontrol of a single man, he contented himself with walking round the\r\nSquare, and learning, by mingling with the fringe, what manner of\r\nspirit moved it.\r\n\r\nThat spirit, though he heard some ugly threats against Wetherell and\r\nthe Bishops and the Lords, was rather a reckless and mischievous than a\r\nbloodthirsty one. To obtain drink, to destroy this or that gaol, and by\r\nand by to destroy all gaols seemed to the crowd the first principles of\r\nReform.\r\n\r\nPresently a cry of “To the Bridewell! Come on! To the Bridewell!” was\r\nraised, and led by a dozen hobbledehoys, armed with iron bars plucked\r\nfrom the railings, a body of some hundreds trooped off, helter-skelter,\r\nin the direction of the prison of that name.\r\n\r\nVaughan saw that someone must be induced to act; and to him the\r\nfollowing hours of that wet, dismal Sunday were a waking nightmare. He\r\nhurried hither and thither, from Guildhall to Council House, from\r\nBrereton’s lodgings to the dragoons’ quarters, striving to effect\r\nsomething and always failing; seeking some cohesion, some decision,\r\nsome action, and finding none. Always there had just been a meeting, or\r\nwas going to be a meeting, or would be a meeting by and by. The civil\r\npower would not act without the military; and the military did not\r\nthink itself strong enough to act, but would act if the civil power\r\nwould do something which the civil power had made up its mind not to\r\ndo. And meantime the supineness of the mass of the citizens was\r\nmarvellous. He seemed to be moving endlessly between lines of men who\r\nlounged at their doors, and joked, or waited for the crowd to pass that\r\nway. Nothing, it seemed to him, would rouse these men to a sense of the\r\nposition. It would be a lesson to Wetherell, they said. It would be a\r\nlesson to the Peers. It would be a lesson to the Tories. The Bridewell\r\nwas sacked and fired, the great gaol across the New Cut was firing, the\r\nGloucester gaol in the north of the city was threatened. And still it\r\ndid not occur to these householders, as they looked down the wet, misty\r\nstreets, that presently it would be a lesson to them.\r\n\r\nBut at half-past three, with the dusk on that rainy day scarce an hour\r\noff, there was a meeting at the Guildhall. Still no cohesion, no\r\naction. On the other hand, much recrimination, many opinions. One was\r\nfor casting all firearms into the float. Another for arming all, fit or\r\nunfit. One was for fetching the Fourteenth back, another for sending\r\nthe Third to join them at Keynsham. One was for appeasing the people by\r\nparading a dummy figure of their own Recorder through the city and\r\nburning it on College Green. Another for relying on the Political\r\nUnion. In vain Vaughan warned them that the mob would presently attack\r\nprivate property; in vain he offered, in a few spirited words, to lead\r\nthe Special Constables to the rescue of the gaol. The meeting, small to\r\nbegin and always divided, dwindled fast. The handful who were ready to\r\nfollow him made the support of the military a condition. Everybody\r\nsaid, “To-morrow!” To-morrow the _posse comitatus_ might be called out;\r\nto-morrow the yeomanry, summoned by the man in the yellow jacket, would\r\nbe here! To-morrow the soldiers might act. And in fine—To-morrow!\r\n\r\nThere was over the door of the Council House of those days a statue of\r\nJustice, lacking the sword and the bandage. Vaughan, passing out in\r\ndisgust from the meeting, pointed to it. “There is Bristol, gentlemen,”\r\nhe said bitterly. “Your authorities have dropped the sword, and until\r\nthey regain it we are helpless. I have done my best.” And, shrugging\r\nhis shoulders, he started for Brereton’s lodgings to try a last appeal.\r\n\r\nHe might well think it necessary. For a night which Bristol was long to\r\nremember was closing down upon the city. Though it was Sunday, the\r\nchurches were empty; in few was a second service held. The streets, on\r\nthe contrary, were full, in spite of the cold; full of noise and\r\nturmoil and disorder; of bands of men hastening up and down with\r\nreckless cries and flaring lights, at the bidding of leaders as\r\nunwitting. In Queen’s Square the rioters were drinking themselves drunk\r\nas at a fair, while amid the falling rain, through which the last\r\nstormy gleams of daylight strove to pass, amid the thickening dusk,\r\nthose who all day long had jested at their doors began to turn doubtful\r\nlooks on one another. From three points the smoke of fired prisons rose\r\nto the clouds and floated in a dense pall over the city; and men\r\nwhispered that a hundred, two hundred, five hundred criminals had been\r\nset free. On Clifton Downs, on Brandon Hill, on College Green, on\r\nRedcliffe the thousand gazers of the morning were doubled and\r\nredoubled. But they no longer wore the cynical faces of the morning. On\r\nthe contrary there were some who, following with their eyes the network\r\nof waterways laden with inflammable shipping, which pierced the city in\r\nevery direction—who, tracing these and the cutthroat alleys and lanes\r\nabout them, predicted that the morning would find Bristol a heap of\r\nruins. And not a few, taking fright at the last moment, precipitately\r\nremoved their families to Clifton, and locked up their houses.\r\n\r\nVaughan, as he walked through the dusk, had those waterways, those\r\nlanes, those alleys, the congested heart of the old city, in his mind.\r\nHe doubted, even he, if the hour for action was not past. Nor was he\r\nsurprised when Brereton met his appeal with a flat _non possumus_. He\r\nwas more struck with the change which twenty-four hours had wrought in\r\nthe man. He looked worn and haggard. The shadows under his eyes were\r\ndeeper, the eyes shone with a more feverish light. His dress, too, was\r\ncareless and disordered, and while he was not still for a moment, he\r\nrepeated what he said over and over again as if to persuade himself of\r\nits truth.\r\n\r\nNaturally Vaughan laid stress on the damage already done. “But, I tell\r\nyou,” Brereton replied angrily, “we are well clear for that! It’s not a\r\ntithe of the harm which would have befallen if I had given way! I tell\r\nyou, we’re well clear for that. No, I’ve done, thank God, I’ve done the\r\nonly thing it was possible to do. A little too much, and if I’d\r\nsucceeded I’d have been hung—for they’re all against me, they’re all\r\nagainst me, above and below! And if I’d failed, a thousand lives would\r\nhave paid the bill! And do you ever consider, man,” he continued,\r\nstriking the table, “what a massacre in this crowded place would be!\r\nThink of the shipyards, the dockyards, the quays! The water pits and\r\nthe sunk alleys! How could I clear them with ninety swords? How could I\r\nclear them? Eh, with ninety swords? I tell you they never meant me to\r\nclear them.”\r\n\r\n“But why not clear the wider streets, sir?” Vaughan persisted, “and\r\nkeep a grip on those?”\r\n\r\n“No! I say, no!”\r\n\r\n“Yet even now, if you were to move your full force to Queen’s Square,\r\nsir, you might clear it. And driven from their headquarters, and taught\r\nthat they are not going to have it all their own way, the more prudent\r\nwould fall off and go home.”\r\n\r\n“I know,” Brereton answered. “I know the argument. I know it. But who’s\r\nto thank for the whole trouble? Your Blues, who went beyond their\r\norders last night. The Fourteenth, sir! The Fourteenth! But I’ll have\r\nno more of it. Flixton is of my opinion, too.”\r\n\r\n“Flixton is an ass!” Vaughan cried incautiously.\r\n\r\n“And you think me one too!” Brereton retorted, with so strange a look\r\nthat for the first time Vaughan was sure that his mind was tottering.\r\n“Well, think what you like! Think what you like! But I’ll trouble you\r\nnot to take that tone here.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII\r\nTHE AFFRAY AT THE PALACE\r\n\r\n\r\nA little before the hour at which Vaughan interviewed Brereton, Sir\r\nRobert Vermuyden, the arrival of whose travelling carriage at the White\r\nLion about the middle of the afternoon had caused some excitement,\r\nwalked back to the inn. He was followed by Thomas, the servant who had\r\nattended Mary to Bristol, and by another servant. As he passed through\r\nthe streets the signs of the times were not lost upon him; far from it.\r\nBut the pride of caste was strong upon him, and he hid his anxiety.\r\n\r\nOn the threshold of the inn he turned to the servants. “Are you sure,”\r\nhe asked for the fourth time, “that that was the house at which you\r\nleft her?”\r\n\r\n“Certain sure, Sir Robert,” Thomas answered earnestly.\r\n\r\n“And sure—but, ah!” the baronet broke off abruptly, his tone one of\r\nrelief. “Here’s Mr. Cooke! Go now, but be within call. Mr. Cooke,”—he\r\nstepped, as he spoke, in front of that gentleman, who was about to\r\nenter the house—“well met!”\r\n\r\nCooke was hot with haste and ire, but at the unexpected sight of Sir\r\nRobert he stood still. “God bless my soul!” he cried. “You here, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes. And you know Bristol well. You can help me.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could help myself!” Cooke cried, forgetting himself in his\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“My daughter is in Bristol.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” the angry merchant replied. “Then she could not be in a worse\r\nplace. That is all I can say.”\r\n\r\n“I am inclined to agree with you.”\r\n\r\n“This is your Reform!”\r\n\r\nSir Robert stared. “Not my Reform, Mr. Cooke,” he said in a tone of\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, Sir Robert,” Cooke rejoined, speaking more coolly.\r\n“I beg your pardon. But what I have suffered to-day is beyond telling.\r\nBy G—d, it’s my opinion that there’s only one man worthy of the name in\r\nBristol! And that’s your cousin, Vaughan!”\r\n\r\nSir Robert struck his stick on the pavement. “Mr. Vaughan?” he\r\nexclaimed. “He is here, then? I feared so!”\r\n\r\n“Here? You feared? I tell you he’s the only man to be called a man, who\r\nis here! If it had not been for him and the way he handled the\r\nconstables last night we should have been burnt out then instead of\r\nto-night! I don’t know that the gain’s much, but for what it’s worth we\r\nhave him to thank!”\r\n\r\nSir Robert frowned. “I am surprised. He behaved well? Indeed!” he said.\r\n\r\n“D——d well! D——d well! If there had been half a dozen like him, we’d be\r\nout of the wood!”\r\n\r\n“Where is he staying?” Sir Robert asked after a moment’s hesitation.\r\n“I’ve lost my daughter in the confusion, and I think it possible that\r\nhe may know where she is.”\r\n\r\n“He is staying here at the Lion,” Cooke answered. “But he’s been up and\r\ndown all day trying to put heart into poltroons.” And he ran over the\r\nchief events of the last few hours.\r\n\r\nHe punctuated the story with oaths and bitter complaints, and perhaps\r\nit was for this reason that Sir Robert, after he had heard the main\r\nfacts, broke away. He went through the hall to the bar where the\r\nlandlord, who knew him well, came forward and greeted him respectfully.\r\nBut to Sir Robert’s inquiry as to Mr. Vaughan’s whereabouts he shook\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\n“I wish he was in the house, Sir Robert,” he said in a low voice. “For\r\nhe’s a marked man in Bristol since last night. I was in the Square\r\nmyself, and it was wonderful what spirit he put into his men. But the\r\nscum and the riffraff who are uppermost to-day say he handled them\r\ncruelly, and my daughter tried to persuade him from going out to-day.\r\nBut he would go, sir.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert reflected with a gloomy face. “Where are Mr. Flixton’s\r\nquarters?” he asked at last. He might possibly learn something from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe man told him, and Sir Robert summoned his servants and went out. It\r\nwas dark by this time, but a faint glare shone overhead and there was a\r\nmurmur in the air, as if, in the gloom beneath, the heart of the city\r\nwas palpitating, in dread of it knew not what. Sir Robert had not far\r\nto go. He had barely passed into College Green when he met Flixton\r\nunder a lamp. And so it happened that two minutes later, Vaughan, on\r\nhis way from Brereton’s lodgings in Unity Street, came plump upon the\r\ntwo. He might have gone by in ignorance, but as he passed the taller\r\nman looked up, and Vaughan with a shock of surprise recognised Sir\r\nRobert Vermuyden.\r\n\r\nFlixton caught sight of Vaughan at the same moment, and “Here’s your\r\nman, Sir Robert,” he cried with a little malice in his tone. “Here,\r\nVaughan,” he continued, “Here’s Sir Robert Vermuyden! He’s looking for\r\nyou. He wants to know——”\r\n\r\nSir Robert stopped him. “I will speak for myself, Mr. Flixton, if you\r\nplease,” he said with the dignity which seldom deserted him. “Mr.\r\nVaughan,” he continued, with a piercing glance, “where is my daughter?”\r\n\r\nVaughan returned his look, frowning. Since the parting in Miss Sibson’s\r\nparlour, the remembrance of which still set his blood in a flame, Sir\r\nRobert and he had not met. Now, in the wet gloom of College Green,\r\nunder a rare gaslamp, with turmoil about them, and the murmur of fresh\r\ntrouble drawing near through the streets, Sir Robert asked him for his\r\ndaughter! He could have laughed. As it was, “I know nothing, sir, of\r\nyour daughter,” he replied, in a tone between contempt and anger.\r\n\r\n“But,” Sir Robert retorted, “you travelled with her, from London!”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that I did?”\r\n\r\n“The servants, sir, have told me that you did.”\r\n\r\n“Then they must also have told you,” Vaughan rejoined keenly, “that I\r\ndid not take the liberty of speaking to Miss Vermuyden. And that I left\r\nthe coach at Chippenham. That being so, I can only refer you,” he\r\ncontinued with a sneer, raising his hat and preparing to move on, “to\r\nMr. Flixton, who went with her the rest of the way to Bristol.”\r\n\r\nHe turned away. But he had not taken two paces before Sir Robert\r\ntouched his shoulder, and with that habit of command which few\r\nquestioned. “Wait, sir,” he said, “Wait, if you please. You do not\r\nescape me so easily. You will attend to me one moment, if you please.\r\nMr. Flixton accompanied Miss Vermuyden, as did her man and maid, to\r\nMiss Sibson’s house. She gave that address to Lady Worcester, in whose\r\ncare she was; and I sought her there this afternoon. But she is not\r\nthere.” Sir Robert continued, striving to read Vaughan’s face. “The\r\nhouse is empty. So is the house on either side. I can make no one\r\nhear.”\r\n\r\n“And you come to me for news of her?” Vaughan asked in the tone he had\r\nused throughout. He was very sore.\r\n\r\n“I do.”\r\n\r\n“You do not think that I am the last person of whom you should ask\r\ntidings of your daughter?”\r\n\r\n“She came here,” Sir Robert answered sternly, “to see Lady Sybil.”\r\n\r\nVaughan stared. The answer seemed to be irrelevant. Then he understood.\r\n“Oh,” he said, “I see. You are still under the impression that your\r\nwife and I are in a conspiracy to delude you? Your daughter also? You\r\nthink that she is in the plot? And that she gave the schoolmistress’s\r\naddress to deceive you?”\r\n\r\n“No!” Sir Robert cried. But, after all, that was what he did think. Had\r\nhe not told himself, more than once, that she was her mother’s\r\ndaughter? Had he not told himself that it could not have been by chance\r\nthat Vaughan and she met a second time on the coach? He knew that she\r\nhad left London and gone to her mother in defiance of him. He knew\r\nthat. And though she had entwined herself about his heart, though she\r\nhad seemed to him all gentleness, goodness, truth—she was still her\r\nmother’s daughter! Nevertheless, he said “No!”—and said it angrily.\r\n\r\n“Then I do not know what you mean!” Vaughan retorted.\r\n\r\n“I believe that you can tell me something, if you will.”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked at him. “I have nothing to tell you,” he said.\r\n\r\n“You mean, sir, that you will tell me nothing!”\r\n\r\n“That, if you like.”\r\n\r\nFor nearly half a century the old man had found few to oppose him; and\r\nnow by good luck he had not time to reply. A man running out of the\r\ndarkness in the direction of Unity Street—the open space was full of\r\nmoving groups, of alarms and confusion—caught sight of Vaughan’s face,\r\nchecked himself and addressed him.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Vaughan!” he said. “They are coming! They are making for the\r\nPalace! The Bishop must be got away, if he’s not gone! I am fetching\r\nthe Colonel! The Mayor is following with all he can get together. If\r\nyou will give warning at the Palace, there will be time for his\r\nlordship to escape.”\r\n\r\n“Right!” Vaughan cried, glad to leave his company. And he started\r\nwithout the loss of a moment. Even so, he had not gone twenty paces\r\ndown the Green before the head of the mob entered it from St.\r\nAugustine’s, and passed, with hoarse shouts, along the south side,\r\ntowards the ancient Archway which led to the Lower Green. It was a\r\nquestion whether he or they reached the Archway first; but he won the\r\nrace by a score of yards.\r\n\r\nThe view from the Lower Green, which embraced the burning gaol, as well\r\nas all Queen’s Square and the Floating Basin that islanded it, had\r\ndrawn together a number of gazers. These impeded Vaughan’s progress,\r\nbut he got through them at last, and as the mob burst into the Lower\r\nGreen he entered the paved passage leading to the Precincts, hurried\r\nalong it, turned the dark elbow near the inner end, and halted before\r\nthe high gates which shut off the Cloisters. The Palace door was in the\r\ninnermost or southeast corner of the Cloisters.\r\n\r\nIt was very dark at the end of the passage; and fortunately! For the\r\ngates were fast closed, and before he could, groping, find the knocker,\r\nthe rabble had entered the passage behind him and cut off his retreat.\r\nThe high wall which rose on either side made escape impossible. Nor was\r\nthis all. As he awoke to the trap in which he had placed himself, a\r\nvoice at his elbow muttered, “My God, we shall be murdered!” And he\r\nlearned that Sir Robert had followed him.\r\n\r\nHe had no time to remonstrate, nor thought of remonstrance. “Stand flat\r\nagainst the wall!” he muttered, his fingers closing upon the staff in\r\nhis pocket. “It is our only chance!”\r\n\r\nHe had basely spoken before the leaders of the mob swept round the\r\nelbow. They had one light, a flare borne above them, which shone on\r\ntheir tarpaulins and white smocks, and on the huge ship-hammers they\r\ncarried. There was a single moment of great peril, and instinctively\r\nVaughan stepped before the older man. He could not have made a happier\r\nmovement, for it seemed—to the crowd who caught a glimpse of the two\r\nand took them for some of their own party—as if he advanced against the\r\ngates along with their leaders.\r\n\r\nThe peril indeed, or the worst of it, was over the moment they fell\r\ninto the ranks. “Hammers to the front!” was the cry. And Sir Robert and\r\nVaughan were thrust back into the second line, that those who wielded\r\nthe hammers might have room. Vaughan tipped his hat over his face, and\r\nthe villains who pressed upon the two and jostled them, and whose cries\r\nof “Burn him out! Burn the old devil out!” were dictated by greed\r\nrather than by hate, were too full of the work in hand to regard their\r\nneighbours closely. In three or four minutes—long minutes they seemed\r\nto the two inclosed in that unsavoury company—the bars gave way, the\r\ngates were thrown open, and Vaughan and Sir Robert, hardly keeping\r\ntheir feet in the rush, were borne into the Cloisters.\r\n\r\nThe rabble, with cries of triumph, raced across the dark court to the\r\nPalace door and began to use their hammers on that. Vaughan hoped that\r\nthe Bishop had had warning—as a fact he had escaped some hours earlier.\r\nAt any rate he and his companion could do no more, and under cover of\r\nthe darkness they retreated to the porch of a smaller house which\r\nopened on the Cloisters. Here they were safe for the time; and, his\r\nheart opened and his tongue loosed by the danger through which they had\r\npassed, he turned to his companion and remonstrated with him.\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert,” he said, “this is no place for a man of your years.”\r\n\r\n“England will soon be no place for any man of my years,” the Baronet\r\nanswered bitterly. “I would your leaders, sir, were here to see their\r\nwork! I would Lord Grey were here to see how well his friends carry out\r\nhis hints!”\r\n\r\n“I doubt if he would be more pleased than you or I!” Vaughan answered.\r\n“In the meantime——”\r\n\r\n“The soldiers! Have a care!” The alarm came from the gate by which they\r\nhad entered, and Vaughan broke off, with an exclamation of joy. “We\r\nhave them now!” he said. “And red-handed! Brereton has only to close\r\nthe passage, and he must take them all!”\r\n\r\nBut the rioters took that view also, and the alarm. And they streamed\r\nout panic-stricken. When the soldiers rode in, Brereton at their head,\r\nnot more than twenty or thirty remained in the Precincts. And on that\r\nfollowed the most remarkable of all the scenes that disgraced Bristol\r\nthat night; the scene which beyond others convinced many of the\r\ncomplicity of the troops, if not of the Government, in the outrage.\r\n\r\nNot a man could leave the Palace except with the troops’ good-will. Yet\r\nthey let the rascals pass. In vain a handful of constables—who had\r\narrived on the heels of the military—exerted themselves to seize the\r\nworst offenders, and such as passed with plunder in their hands. The\r\nsoldiers discouraged the attempt, and even beat back the constables.\r\n“Let them go! Let them go!” was the cry. And the nimbleness of the\r\nscamps in effecting their escape was greeted with laughter and\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nVaughan and the companion whom fate had so strangely joined saw it with\r\nindignation. But Vaughan had made up his mind that he would not\r\napproach Brereton again; and he controlled himself, until a blackguard\r\nbolting from the Palace with his arms full of spoil was seized, close\r\nto him, by an elderly man, who seemed to be one of the Bishop’s\r\nservants. The two wrestled fiercely, the servant calling for help, the\r\nsoldiers looking on and laughing. A moment and the two fell to the\r\nground, the servant undermost. He uttered a cry of pain.\r\n\r\nThat was too much for Vaughan. He sprang forward, dragged the ruffian\r\nfrom his prey, and with his other hand he drew his staff. He was about\r\nto strike his prisoner—for the man continued to struggle\r\ndesperately—when a voice above them shouted “Put that up! Put that up!”\r\nAnd a trooper urged his horse almost on the top of them, at the same\r\ntime threatening him with his naked sword.\r\n\r\nVaughan lost his temper at that. “You blackguard!” he cried. “Stand\r\nback. The man is my prisoner!”\r\n\r\nFor answer the soldier struck at him. Fortunately the blade was turned\r\nby his hat and only the flat alighted on his head. But the man, drunk\r\nor reckless, repeated the blow, and this time would certainly have cut\r\nhim down if Sir Robert, with a quickness beyond his years, had not\r\nturned aside the stroke with his walking-cane. At the same time “Are\r\nyou mad?” he shouted peremptorily. “Where is your Colonel?”\r\n\r\nThe tone, rather than the words, sobered the trooper. He swore sulkily,\r\nreined in his horse, and moved back to his fellows. Sir Robert turned\r\nto Vaughan, who, dazed by the blow, was leaning against the porch of\r\nthe house. “I hope you are not wounded?” he said.\r\n\r\n“It’s thanks to you, sir, he’s not killed!” the man whom Vaughan had\r\nrescued, replied; and he hung about him solicitously. “He’d have cut\r\nhim to the chin! Ay, to the chin he would!” with quavering gusto.\r\n\r\nVaughan was regaining his coolness. He tried to smile. “I hardly\r\nsaw—what happened,” he said. “I am only sure I am not hurt. Just—a rap\r\non the head!”\r\n\r\n“I am glad that it is no worse,” Sir Robert said gravely. “Very glad!”\r\nNow it was over he had to bite his lower lip to repress its trembling.\r\n\r\n“You feel better, sir, now?” the servant asked, addressing Vaughan.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes,” Vaughan said. But after that he was silent, thinking. And\r\nSir Robert was silent, too. The soldiers were withdrawing; the\r\nconstables, outraged and indignant, were following them, declaring\r\naloud that they were betrayed. And for certain the walls of the\r\nCathedral had looked down on few stranger scenes, even in those\r\ntroubled days when the crosslets of the Berkeleys first shone from\r\ntheir casements.\r\n\r\nVaughan thought of the thing which had happened; and what was he to\r\nsay? The position was turned upside down. The obligation was on the\r\nwrong person; the boot was on the wrong foot. If he, the young, the\r\nstrong, and the injured, had saved Sir Robert, that had been well\r\nenough. But this? It required some magnanimity to take it gracefully,\r\nto bear it with dignity.\r\n\r\n“I owe you sincere thanks,” he said at last, but awkwardly and with\r\nconstraint.\r\n\r\n“The blackguard!” Sir Robert cried.\r\n\r\n“You saved me, sir, from a very serious injury.”\r\n\r\n“It was as much threat as blow!” Sir Robert rejoined.\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” Vaughan answered. And then he was silent, finding\r\nit hard to say more. But after a pause, “I can only make you one\r\nreturn,” he said with an effort. “Perhaps you will believe me when I\r\nsay, that upon my honour I do not know where your daughter is. I have\r\nneither spoken to her nor communicated with her since I saw her in\r\nQueen’s Square in May. And I know nothing of Lady Sybil.”\r\n\r\n“I am obliged to you,” Sir Robert said.\r\n\r\n“If you believe me,” Vaughan said. “Not otherwise!”\r\n\r\n“I do believe you, Mr. Vaughan.” And Sir Robert said it as if he meant\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Then that is something gained,” Vaughan answered, “besides the\r\nsoundness of my head.” Try as he might he felt the position irksome,\r\nand was glad to seek refuge in flippancy.\r\n\r\nSir Robert removed his hat, and stood in perplexity. “But where can she\r\nbe then?” he asked. “If you know nothing of her.”\r\n\r\nVaughan paused before he answered. Then “I think I should look for her\r\nin Queen’s Square,” he suggested. “In that neighbourhood neither life\r\nnor property will be safe until Bristol comes to its senses. She should\r\nbe removed, therefore, if she be there.”\r\n\r\n“I will take your advice and try the house again,” Sir Robert answered.\r\n“I think you are right, and I am much obliged to you.”\r\n\r\nHe put his hat on his head, but removed it to salute his cousin. “Thank\r\nyou,” he repeated, “I am much obliged to you.” And he departed slowly\r\nacross the court.\r\n\r\nHalfway to the entrance, he paused, and fingered his chin. He went on\r\nagain—again he paused. He took a step or two, turned, hesitated. At\r\nlast he came slowly back.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you will go with me?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“You are very good,” Vaughan answered, his voice shaking a little. Was\r\nit possible that Sir Robert meant more than he said? It did seem\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nBut after all they did not go out that way. For, as they approached the\r\nbroken gates, shouts of “Reform!” and “Down with the Lords!” warned\r\nthem that the rioters were returning. And the Bishop’s servant,\r\napproaching them anew, insisted on taking them through the Palace, and\r\nby way of the garden and a low wall conducted them into Trinity Street.\r\nHere they were close to the Drawbridge which crossed the water to the\r\nfoot of Clare Street; and they passed over it, one of them walking with\r\na lighter heart, notwithstanding Mary’s possible danger, than he had\r\nborne for weeks. Soon they were in Queen’s Square, and, avoiding as far\r\nas possible the notice of the mob, were knocking doggedly at Miss\r\nSibson’s door. But by that time the Palace, high above them on College\r\nGreen, had burst into flames, and, a mark for all the countryside, had\r\nflung the red banner of Reform to the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII\r\nFIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Robert and his companion might have knocked longer and more loudly,\r\nand still to no purpose. For the schoolmistress, prepared to witness a\r\ncertain amount of disorder on the Saturday, had been taken aback by the\r\nsight which met her eyes when she rose on Sunday morning. And long\r\nbefore noon she had sent her servants to their friends, locked up her\r\nhouse, and gone next door, to dispel by her cheerful face and her\r\ncomfortable common sense the fears which she knew would prevail there.\r\nThe sick lady was not in a state to withstand alarm; Mary was a young\r\ngirl and timid; and neither the landlady nor Lady Sybil’s maid were\r\npersons of strong mind. Miss Sibson felt that here was an excellent\r\noccasion for the display of that sturdy indifference with which firm\r\nnerves and a long experience of Bristol elections had endowed her.\r\n\r\n“La, my dear,” was her first remark, “it’s all noise and nonsense! They\r\nlook fierce, but there’s not a man of them all, that if I took him\r\nsoundly by the ear and said, ‘John Thomas Gaisford, I know you well and\r\nyour wife! You live in the Pithay, and if you don’t go straight home\r\nthis minute I’ll tell her of your goings on!’—there’s not one of them,\r\nmy dear,” with a jolly laugh, “wouldn’t sneak off with his tail between\r\nhis legs! Hurt us, my lady? I’d like to see them doing it. Still, it\r\nwill be no harm if we lock the door downstairs, and answer no knocks.\r\nWe shall be cosy upstairs, and see all that’s to be seen besides!”\r\n\r\nThese were Miss Sibson’s opinions, a little after noon on the Sunday.\r\nNor, when the day began to draw in, without abating the turmoil, did\r\nshe recant them aloud. But when the servant of the house, who found\r\namusement in listening at the locked door to the talk of those who\r\npassed, came open-eyed to announce that the people had fired the\r\nBridewell, and were attacking the gaol, Miss Sibson did rub her nose\r\nreflectively. And privately she began to wonder whether the prophecies\r\nof evil, which both parties had sown broadcast, were to be fulfilled.\r\n\r\n“It’s that nasty Brougham!” she said. “Alderman Daniel told me that he\r\nwas stirring up the devil; and we’re going to get the dust. But la,\r\nbless your ladyship,” she continued comfortably, “I know the Bristol\r\nlads, and they’ll not hurt us. Just a gaol or two, for the sake of the\r\nfrolic. My dear, your mother’ll have her tea, and will feel the better\r\nfor it. And we’ll draw the curtains and light the lamps and take no\r\nheed. Maybe there’ll be bones broken, but they’ll not be ours!”\r\n\r\nLady Sybil, with her face turned away, muttered something about Paris.\r\n\r\n“Well, your ladyship knows Paris and I don’t,” the schoolmistress\r\nreplied respectfully. “I can fancy anything there. But you may depend\r\nupon it, my lady, England is different. I know old Alderman Daniel\r\ncalls Lord John Russell ‘Lord John Robespierre,’ and says he’s worse\r\nthan a Jacobin. But I’ll never believe he’d cut the King’s head off!\r\nNever! And don’t you believe it, either, my lady. No, English are\r\nEnglish! There’s none like them, and never will be. All the same,” she\r\nconcluded, “I shall set ‘Honour the King!’ for a copy when the young\r\nladies come back.”\r\n\r\nHer views might not have convinced by themselves. But taken with tea\r\nand buttered toast, a good fire and a singing kettle, they availed.\r\nLady Sybil was a shade easier that afternoon; and, naturally of a high\r\ncourage, found a certain alleviation in the exciting doings under her\r\nwindows. She was gracious to Miss Sibson, whose outpourings she\r\nreceived with languid amusement; and when Mary was not looking, she\r\nfollowed her daughter’s movements with mournful eyes. Uncertain as the\r\nwind, she was this evening in her best mood; as patient as she could be\r\nfractious, and as gentle as she was sometimes violent. She scouted the\r\nnotion of danger with all Miss Sibson’s decision; and after tea she\r\ninsisted that the lights should be shaded, and her couch be wheeled to\r\nthe window, in order that, propped high with pillows, she might amuse\r\nherself with the hurly-burly in the Square below.\r\n\r\n“To be sure,” Miss Sibson commented, “it will do no good to anyone,\r\nthis; and many a poor chap will suffer for it by and by. That’s the\r\nworst of these Broughams and Besoms, my lady. It’s the low down that\r\nswallow the dust. It’s very fine to cry ‘King and Reform!’ and drink\r\nthe Corporation wine! But it will be ‘Between our sovereign lord the\r\nKing and the prisoner at the bar!’ one of these days! And their throats\r\nwill be dry enough then!”\r\n\r\n“Poor misguided people!” Mary murmured.\r\n\r\n“They’ve all learned the Church Catechism,” the schoolmistress replied\r\nshrewdly. “Or they should have; it’s lucky for them—ay, you may shout,\r\nmy lads—that there’s many a slip between the neck and the rope—Lord ha’\r\nmercy!”\r\n\r\nThe last words fitted the context well enough; but they fell so\r\nabruptly from her lips that Mary, who was bending over her mother,\r\nlooked up in alarm. “What is it?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Only,” Miss Sibson answered with composure, “what I ought to have said\r\nlong ago—that nothing can be worse for her ladyship than the cold air\r\nthat comes in at the cracks of this window!”\r\n\r\n“It’s not that,” Lady Sybil replied, smiling. “They have set fire to\r\nthe Mansion House, Mary. You can see the flames in the room on the\r\nfarther side of the door.”\r\n\r\nMary uttered an exclamation of horror, and they all looked out. The\r\nMansion House was the most distant house on the north, or left-hand,\r\nside of the Square, viewed from the window at which they stood; the\r\nhouse next Miss Sibson’s being about the middle of the west side.\r\nNearer them, on the same side as the Mansion House, stood another\r\npublic building—the Custom House. And nearer again, being the most\r\nnortherly house on their own side of the Square, stood a third—the\r\nExcise Office.\r\n\r\nThey had thus a fair, though a side view, of the front of the Mansion\r\nHouse, and were able to watch, with what calmness they might, the\r\nflames shoot from one window after another; until, presently, meeting\r\nin a waving veil of fire, they hid—save when the wind blew them\r\naside—all the upper part of the house from their eyes.\r\n\r\nA great fire in the night, the savage, uncontrollable revolt of man’s\r\ntamed servant—is at all times a terrible sight. Nor on this occasion\r\nwas it only the horror of the flames, roaring and crackling and pouring\r\nforth a million of sparks, which chained their eyes. For as these rose,\r\nthey shed an intense light, not only on the heights of Redcliffe,\r\nvisible above the east side of the Square, and on the stately tower\r\nwhich rose from them, but on the multitude below; on the hurrying forms\r\nthat, monkey-like, played before the flames and seemed to feed them,\r\nand on a still stranger sight, the expanse of up-turned faces that, in\r\nthe rear of the active rioters, extended to the farthest limit of the\r\nSquare.\r\n\r\nFor it was the quiescence, it was the inertness of the gazing crowd\r\nwhich most appalled the spectators at the window. To see that great\r\nhouse burn and to see no man stretch forth a hand to quench it, this\r\nterrified. “Oh, but it is frightful! It is horrible!” Mary exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I should like to knock their heads together!” Miss Sibson cried\r\nsternly. “What are the soldiers doing? What is anyone doing?”\r\n\r\n“They have hounded on the dogs,” Lady Sybil said slowly—she alone\r\nseemed to view the sight with a dispassionate eye, “and they are biting\r\ninstead of barking! That is all.”\r\n\r\n“Dogs?” Miss Sibson echoed.\r\n\r\n“Ay, the dogs of Reform!” Lady Sybil replied cynically. “Brougham’s\r\ndogs! Grey’s dogs! Russell’s dogs! I could wish Sir Robert were here,\r\nit would so please him to see his words fulfilled!” And then, as in\r\nsurprise at the thing she had uttered, “I wonder when I wished to\r\nplease him before?” she muttered.\r\n\r\n“Oh, but it is frightful!” Mary repeated, unable to remove her eyes\r\nfrom the flames.\r\n\r\nIt was frightful; even while they were all sane people in the room,\r\nand, whatever their fears, restrained them. What then was it a moment\r\nlater, when the woman of the house burst in upon them, with a maid in\r\nwild hysterics clinging to her, and another on the threshold screaming\r\n“Fire! Fire!”\r\n\r\n“It’s all on fire at the back!” the woman panted. “It’s on fire, it’s\r\nall on fire, my lady, at the back!”\r\n\r\n“It’s all—what?” Miss Sibson rejoined, in a tone which had been known\r\nto quell the pertest of seventeen-year-old rebels. “It is what, woman?\r\nOn fire at the back? And if it is, is that a ground for forgetting your\r\nmanners? Where is your deportment? Fire, indeed! Are you aware whose\r\nroom this is? For shame! And you, silly,” she continued, addressing\r\nherself to the maid, “be silent, and go outside, as becomes you.”\r\n\r\nBut the maid, though she retreated to the door, continued to scream,\r\nand the woman of the house to wring her hands. “You had better go and\r\nsee what it is,” Lady Sybil said, turning to the schoolmistress. For,\r\nstrange to say, she who a few hours before had groaned if a coal fell\r\non the hearth, and complained if her book slid from the couch, was now\r\nquite calm.\r\n\r\n“They are afraid of their own shadows,” Miss Sibson cried\r\ncontemptuously. “It is the reflection they have seen.”\r\n\r\nBut she went. And as it was but a step to a window overlooking the\r\nrear, Mary went with her.\r\n\r\nThey looked. And for a moment something like panic seized them. The\r\nback of the house was not immediately upon the quay, but through an\r\nopening in the warehouses which fringed the latter it commanded a view\r\nof the water and the masts, and of the sloping ground which rose to\r\nCollege Green. And high above, dyeing the Floating Basin crimson, the\r\nPalace showed in a glow of fire; fire which seemed to be on the point\r\nof attacking the Cathedral, of which every pinnacle and buttress, with\r\nevery chimney of the old houses clustered about it, stood out in the\r\nhot glare. It was clear that the building had been burning some time,\r\nfor the roar of the flames could be heard, and almost the hiss of the\r\nwater as innumerable sparks floated down to it.\r\n\r\nHorror-struck, Mary grasped her companion’s arm. And “Good Heavens!”\r\nMiss Sibson muttered. “The whole city will be burned!”\r\n\r\n“And we are between the two fires,” Mary faltered. An involuntary\r\nshudder might be pardoned her.\r\n\r\n“Ay, but far enough from them,” the schoolmistress answered, recovering\r\nherself. “On this side, the water makes us safe.”\r\n\r\n“And on the other?”\r\n\r\n“La, my dear,” Miss Sibson replied confidently. “The folks are not\r\ngoing to burn their own houses. They are angry with the Corporation.\r\nThey hold them all one with Wetherell. And for the Bishop, they’ve so\r\nabused him the last six months that he’s hardly dared to show his wig\r\non the streets, and it’s no wonder the poor ignorants think him fair\r\ngame. But we’re just ordinary folk, and they’ll no more harm us than\r\nfly. But we must go back to your mother.”\r\n\r\nThey went back, and wisely Miss Sibson made no mystery of the truth;\r\nrepeating, however, those arguments against giving way to alarm which\r\nshe had used to Mary.\r\n\r\n“The poor dear gentleman has lost his house,” she concluded piously.\r\n“But we should be thankful he has another.”\r\n\r\nLady Sybil took the news with calmness; her eyes indeed seemed\r\nbrighter, as if she enjoyed the excitement. But the frightened woman at\r\nthe door refused to be comforted, and underlying the courage of the two\r\nwho stood by Lady Sybil’s couch was a secret uneasiness, which every\r\ncheer of the crowd below the windows, every “huzza” which rose from the\r\nrevellers, every wild rush from one part of the Square to another\r\ntended to strengthen. In her heart Miss Sibson owned that in all her\r\nexperience she had known nothing like this; no disorder so flagrant, so\r\nunbridled, so daring. She could carry her mind back to the days when\r\nthe cheek of England had paled at the Massacres of September in Paris.\r\nThe deeds of ’98 in Ireland, she had read morning by morning in the\r\njournals. The Three Days of July, with their street fighting, were\r\nfresh in all men’s minds—it was impossible to ignore their bearing on\r\nthe present conflagration. And if here was not the dawn of Revolution,\r\nif here were not signs of the crash of things, appearances deceived\r\nher. But even so, she was not to be dismayed. She believed that even in\r\nrevolutions a comfortable courage, sound sense, and a good appetite\r\nwent far. And “I’d like to hear John Thomas Gaisford talk to me of\r\nguillotines!” she thought. “I’d make his ears burn!”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mary was thinking that, whatever the emergency, her mother\r\nwas too ill to be moved. Miss Sibson might be right, the danger might\r\nbe remote. But it was barely midnight; and long hours of suspense must\r\nbe lived through before morning came. Meanwhile there were only women\r\nin the house, and, bravely as the girl controlled herself, a cry more\r\nreckless than usual, an outburst of cheering more savage, a rush below\r\nthe windows, drove the blood to her heart. And presently, while she\r\ngazed with shrinking eyes on the crowd, now blood-red in the glow of\r\nthe burning timbers, now lost for a moment in darkness, a groan broke\r\nfrom it, and she saw pale flames appear at the windows of the house\r\nnext the Mansion House. They shot up rapidly, licking the front of the\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson saw them at the same moment, and “The villains!” she\r\nexclaimed. “God grant it be an accident!”\r\n\r\nMary’s lips moved, but no sound came from them.\r\n\r\nLady Sybil laughed her shrill laugh. “The curs are biting bravely!” she\r\nsaid. “What will Bristol say to this?”\r\n\r\n“Show them that they have gone too far!” Miss Sibson answered stoutly.\r\n“The soldiers will act now, and put them in their places, as they did\r\nin Wiltshire in the winter! And high time too!”\r\n\r\nBut though they watched in tense anxiety for the first sign of action\r\non the part of the troops, for the first movement of the authorities,\r\nthey gazed in vain. The miscreants, who fed the flames and spread them,\r\nwere few; and in the Square were thousands who had property to lose,\r\nand friends and interests in jeopardy. If a tithe only of those who\r\nlooked on, quiescent and despairing, had raised their hands, they could\r\nhave beaten the rabble from the place. But no man moved. The fear of\r\ncoming trouble, which had been long in the air, paralysed even the\r\ncourageous, while the ignorant and the timid believed that they saw a\r\nrevolution in progress, and that henceforth the mob would rule—and woe\r\nbetide the man who set himself against it! As it had been in Paris, so\r\nit would be here. And so the flames spread, before the eyes of the\r\nterrified women at the window, before the eyes of the inert multitude,\r\nfrom the house first attacked to its neighbour, and from that to the\r\nnext and the next. Until the noise of the conflagration, the crash of\r\nsinking walls, the crackling of beams were as the roar of falling\r\nwaters, and the Square in that hideous red light, which every moment\r\ndeepened, resembled an inferno, in which the devils of hell played\r\nawful pranks, and wherein, most terrible sight of all, thousands who in\r\nordinary times held the salvation of property to be the first of\r\nduties, stood with scared eyes, passive and cowed.\r\n\r\nIt was such a scene—and they were only women, and alone in the house—as\r\nthe mind cannot imagine and the eye views but once in a generation, nor\r\never forgets. In quiet Clifton, and on St. Michael’s Hill, children\r\nwere snatched from their midnight slumbers and borne into the open,\r\nthat they might see the city stretched below them in a pit of flame,\r\nwith the overarching fog at once confining and reflecting the glare.\r\nDundry Tower, five miles from the scene, shone a red portent visible\r\nfor leagues; and in Chepstow and South Monmouth, beyond the wide\r\nestuary of the Severn, the light was such that men could see to read.\r\nFrom all the distant Mendips, and from the Forest of Dean, miners and\r\ncharcoal-burners gazed southward with scared faces, and told one\r\nanother that the revolution was begun; while Lansdowne Chase sent\r\nriders galloping up the London Road with the news that all the West was\r\nup. Long before dawn on the Monday horsemen and yellow chaises were\r\ncarrying the news through the night to Gloucester, to Southampton, to\r\nSalisbury, to Exeter, to every place where scanty companies of foot\r\nlay, or yeomanry had their headquarters. And where these passed,\r\nalarming the sleeping inns and posthouses, panic sprang up upon their\r\nheels, and the travellers on the down nightcoaches marvelled at the\r\ntales which met them with the daylight.\r\n\r\nIf the sight viewed from a distance was so terrible as to appal a whole\r\ncountryside, if, on those who gazed at it from vantage spots of safety,\r\nand did not guess at the dreadful details, it left an impression of\r\nterror never to be effaced, what was it to the three women who, in the\r\nSquare itself, watched the onward march of the flames towards them,\r\nwere blinded by the glare, choked by the smoke, deafened by the roar?\r\nWhom distance saved from no feature of the scene played under their\r\nwindows: who could shun neither the savage cries of the drunken rabble,\r\ndancing before the doomed houses, nor the sight, scarce less amazing,\r\nof the insensibility which watched the march of the flames and\r\nstretched forth not a finger to stay them! Who, chained by Lady Sybil’s\r\nweakness to the place where they stood, saw house after house go up in\r\nflames, until all the side of the Square adjoining their own was a wall\r\nof fire; and who then were left to guess the progress, swift or slow,\r\nwhich the element was making towards them! For whom the copper-hued fog\r\nabove them must have seemed, indeed, the roof of a furnace, from which\r\nescape grew moment by moment less likely?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV\r\nHOURS OF DARKNESS\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before this the women of the house had fled, taking Lady Sybil’s\r\nmaid with them. And dreadful as was the situation of those who\r\nremained, appalling as were the fears of two of them, they were able to\r\ncontrol themselves; the better because they knew that they had no aid\r\nbut their own to look to, and that their companion was helpless.\r\nFortunately Lady Sybil, who had watched the earlier phases of the riot\r\nwith the detachment which is one of the marks of extreme weakness, had\r\nat a certain point turned faint, and demanded to be removed from the\r\nwindow. She was ignorant, therefore, of the approach of the flames and\r\nof the imminence of the peril. She had even, in spite of the uproar,\r\ndozed off, after a few minutes of trying irritation, into an uneasy\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nMary and Miss Sibson were thus left free. But for what? Compelled to\r\nwatch in suspense the progress of the flames, driven at times to fancy\r\nthat they could feel the heat of the fire, assailed more than once by\r\ngusts of fear, as one or the other imagined that they were already cut\r\noff, they could not have held their ground but for their unselfishness;\r\nbut for their possession of those qualities of love and heroism which\r\nraise women to the height of occasion, and nerve them to a pitch of\r\nendurance of which men are rarely capable. In the schoolmistress, with\r\nher powdered nose and her portly figure, and her dull past of samplers\r\nand backboards and Mrs. Chapone, there dwelt as sturdy a spirit as in\r\nany of the rough Bristol shipmasters from whom she sprang. She might be\r\nfond of a sweetbread, and a glass of port might not come amiss to her.\r\nBut the heart in her was stout and large, and she had as soon dreamed\r\nof forsaking her forlorn companions as those bluff sailormen would have\r\ndreamed of striking their flag to a codfish Don, or to a shipload of\r\nmutinous slaves.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary? Perchance the gentlest and the mildest are also the bravest,\r\nwhen the stress is real. Or perhaps those who have never known a\r\nmother’s love cling to the veriest shred and tatter of it, if it fall\r\nin their way. Or perhaps—but why explain that which all history has\r\nproved a hundred times over—-that love casts out fear. Mary quailed,\r\ndeafened by the thunder of the fire, with the walls of the room turning\r\nblood-red round her, and the smoke beginning to drift before the\r\nwindow. But she stood; and only once, assailed by every form of fear,\r\ndid her courage fail her, or sink below the stronger nerve of the elder\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThat was when Miss Sibson, after watching that latest and most pregnant\r\nsign, the eddying of smoke past the window, spoke out. “I’m going next\r\ndoor,” she cried in Mary’s ear. “There are papers I must save; they are\r\nall I have for my old age. The rest may go, but I can’t see them burn\r\nwhen five minutes may save them.”\r\n\r\nBut Mary clung to her desperately. “Oh!” she cried, “don’t leave me!”\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson patted her shoulder. “I shall come back,” she said. “I\r\nshall come back, my dear, never fear. And then we must move your\r\nmother—into the Square if no better can be. Do you come down and let me\r\nin when I knock three times.”\r\n\r\nLady Sybil was still dozing, with a woollen wrap about her head to\r\ndeaden the noise; and giving way to the cooler brain Mary went down\r\nwith the schoolmistress. In the hall the roar of the fire was less, for\r\nthe only window was shuttered. But the raucous voices of the mob,\r\nmoving to and fro outside, were more clearly heard.\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson, however, remained undaunted. “Put up the chain the moment\r\nI am outside,” she said.\r\n\r\n“But are you not afraid?” Mary cried, holding her back.\r\n\r\n“Of those scamps?” Miss Sibson replied truculently. “They had better\r\nnot touch me!” And she turned the key and slipped out. Nor did she\r\nleave the step until Mary had put up the chain and re-locked the door.\r\n\r\nMary waited—oh, many, many minutes it seemed—in the gloom of the hall,\r\npierced here and there by a lurid ray; with half her mind on her mother\r\nupstairs, and the other half on the ribald laughter, the drunken oaths\r\nand threats and curses which penetrated from the Square. It was plain\r\nthat Miss Sibson had not gone too soon, for twice or thrice the door\r\nwas struck with some heavy instrument, and harsh voices called on the\r\ninmates to open if they did not wish to be burned. Uncertain how the\r\nfire advanced, Mary heard them with a sick heart. But she held her\r\nground, until, oh, joy! she heard voices raised in altercation, and\r\namong them the schoolmistress’s. A hand knocked thrice, she turned the\r\nkey and let down the chain. The door opened upon her, and on the steps,\r\nwith her hand on a man’s shoulder, appeared Miss Sibson. Behind her and\r\nher captive, between them and that background of flame and confusion,\r\nstood a group of four or five men—dock labourers, in tarpaulins and\r\nfrocks, who laughed tipsily.\r\n\r\n“This lad will help to carry your mother out,” Miss Sibson said with\r\nthe utmost coolness. “Come, my lad, and no nonsense! You don’t want to\r\nburn a sick lady in her bed!”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t, Missis,” the man grumbled sheepishly. “But I’m none here\r\nfor that! I’m none here for that, and——”\r\n\r\n“You’ll do it, all the same,” the schoolmistress replied. “And I want\r\none more. Here, you,” she continued, addressing a grinning hobbledehoy\r\nin a sealskin cap. “I know your face, and you’ll want someone to speak\r\nfor you at the Assizes. Come in, you two, and the rest must wait until\r\nthe lady’s carried out!”\r\n\r\nAnd thereon, with that strange mixture of humanity and unreasoning fury\r\nof which the night left many examples, the men complied. The two whom\r\nshe had chosen entered, the others suffered her to shut the door in\r\ntheir faces. Only, “You’ll be quick!” one bawled after her. “She’s\r\nafire next door!”\r\n\r\nThat was the warning that went with them upstairs, and it nerved them\r\nfor the task before them. Over that task it were well to draw a veil.\r\nThe poor sick woman, roused anew and abruptly to a sense of her\r\nsurroundings, to the flickering lights, the smell of smoke, the strange\r\nfaces, to all the horrors of that scene rarely equalled in our modern\r\nEngland, shrieked aloud. The courage, which had before upheld her,\r\ndeserted her. She refused to be moved, refused to believe that they\r\nwere there to save her; she failed even to recognise her daughter, she\r\nresisted their efforts, and whatever Mary could say or do, she added to\r\nthe peril of the moment all the misery which frantic terror and\r\nunavailing shrieks could add. They did not know, while they reasoned\r\nwith her, and tried to lift her, and strove to cloak her against the\r\nouter air, the minute at which the house might be entered; nor even\r\nthat it was not already entered, already in some part on fire. The\r\ngirl, though her hands were steady, though she never wavered, though\r\nshe persisted, was white as paper. And even Miss Sibson was almost\r\nunnerved, when at last nature came to their aid, and with a frantic\r\nprotest, a last attempt to thrust them from her, the poor woman\r\nswooned; and the men who had looked on, as unhappy as those engaged,\r\nlifted the couch and bore her down the stairs. Odd are the windings of\r\nchance and fate. These men, in whom every good instinct was awakened by\r\nthe sight before them, might, had the schoolmistress’s eye alighted on\r\nothers, have plundered on with their fellows; and with the more\r\nluckless of those fellows have stood on the scaffold a month later!\r\n\r\nStill, time had been lost. And perforce the men descended slowly, so\r\nthat as they reached the hall the door gave way, and admitted a dozen\r\nrascals, who tumbled over one another in their greed. The moment was\r\ncritical, the inrush of horrid sounds and sights appalling. But Mary\r\nrose to the occasion. With a courage which from this time remained with\r\nher to the end, she put herself forward.\r\n\r\n“Will you let us pass out?” she said. “My mother is ill. You do not\r\nwish to harm her?”\r\n\r\nNow Lady Sybil had made Mary put off the Quaker-like costume in which\r\nshe had wished to nurse her, and she had had no time to cover the light\r\nmuslin dress she wore. The men saw before them a beautiful creature,\r\nwhite-robed, bareheaded, barenecked—even the schoolmistress had not\r\nsnatched up so much as a cloak—a Una with sweet shining eyes, before\r\nwhom they fell aside abashed.\r\n\r\n“Lord love you, Miss!” one cried heartily. “Take her out! And God bless\r\nyou!” while the others grinned fatuously.\r\n\r\nSo down the steps and into the turmoil of the seething Square, walled\r\non two sides by fire, and full of a drunken, frenzied rabble—for all\r\ndecent onlookers had fled, awake at last to the result of their\r\nquiescence—the strange procession moved, the girl going first. Tipsy\r\ngroups, singing and dancing delirious jigs to the music of falling\r\nwalls, pillagers hurrying in ruthless haste from house to house, or\r\nquarrelling over their spoils, householders striving to save a remnant\r\nof their goods from dwellings past saving—all made way for it. Men who\r\nswayed on their feet, brandishing their arms and shouting obscene\r\nsongs, being touched on the shoulder by others, stared, and gave place\r\nwith mouths agape. Even boys, whom the madness of that night made worse\r\nthan men, and unsexed women, shrank at sight of it, and were\r\nsilent—nay, followed with a strange homage the slender white figure,\r\nthe shining eyes, the pure sweet face.\r\n\r\nIn the worst horrors of the French Revolution it is said that the\r\ndevotion of a daughter stayed the hands which were raised to slay her\r\nfather. Even so, on this night in Bristol, amid surroundings less\r\nbloody, but almost as appalling, the wildest and the most furious made\r\nway for the daughter and the mother.\r\n\r\nLed by instinct rather than by calculation, Mary did not pause, or look\r\naside, but moved onward, until she reached the middle of the Square;\r\nuntil some sixty or seventy yards divided her charge from the nearest\r\nof the burning houses. The heat was less scorching here, the crowd less\r\ncompact. A fixed seat afforded shelter on one side, and by it she\r\nsigned to the bearers to set the couch down. The statue stood not far\r\naway on the other side, and secured them against the ugly rushes which\r\nwere caused from time to time by the fall of a roof or a rain of\r\nsparks.\r\n\r\nMary gazed round her in stupor. And no wonder. The whole of the north\r\nside of the great Square, and a half of the west side—thirty lofty\r\nhouses in all—were in flames, or were sinking in red-hot ruin. The long\r\nwall of fire, the canopy of glowing smoke, the ceaseless roar of the\r\nelement, the random movements of the forms which, pigmy-like, played\r\nbetween her and the conflagration, the doom which threatened the whole\r\ncity, held her awestruck, spellbound, fascinated.\r\n\r\nBut even the feelings which she experienced, confronted by that sight,\r\nwere exceeded by the emotions of one who had seen her advance, and, at\r\nfirst with horror, then as he recognised her, with incredulity, had\r\nwatched the white figure which threaded its way through this rout of\r\nsatyrs, this orgy of recklessness. She had not succeeded in wresting\r\nher eyes from the spectacle before a trembling hand fell on her arm,\r\nand the last voice she expected to hear called her by name.\r\n\r\n“Mary!” Sir Robert cried. “Mary! My God! What are you doing here?” For,\r\ntaken up with staring at her, he had seen neither who accompanied her\r\nnor what they bore.\r\n\r\nA sob of relief and joy broke from her, as she recognised him and flung\r\nherself into his arms and clung to him.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she cried. “Oh!” She could say no more at that moment. But the\r\njoy of it! To have at last a man to turn to, a man to lean upon, a man\r\nto look to!\r\n\r\nAnd still he could not grasp the position. “My God!” he repeated in\r\nwonder. “What, child, what are you doing here?”\r\n\r\nBut before she could answer him, his eyes sank to the level of the\r\ncouch, which the figures about it shaded from the scorching light. And\r\nhe started—and stepped back. In a lower voice and a quavering tone he\r\ncalled upon his Maker. He was beginning to understand.\r\n\r\n“We had to bring her out,” she sobbed. “We had to bring her out. The\r\nhouse is on fire. See!” She pointed to the house beside Miss Sibson’s,\r\nfrom the upper windows of which smoke was beginning to curl and eddy.\r\nMen were pouring from the door below, carrying their booty and jostling\r\nothers who sought to enter.\r\n\r\n“You have been here all day?” he asked, passing his hand over his brow.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“All day? All day?” he repeated.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe covered his eyes with his hand, while Mary, recalled by a touch from\r\nMiss Sibson, knelt beside her mother, to feel her pulse, to rub her\r\nhands, to make sure that life still lingered in the inanimate frame. He\r\nhad not asked, he did not ask who it was over whom his daughter hung\r\nwith so tender a solicitude. He did not even look at the cloaked\r\nfigure. But the sidelong glance which at once sought and shunned, the\r\nquivering of his mouth, which his shaking fingers did not avail to\r\nhide, the agitation which unnerved a frame, erect but feeble, all\r\nbetrayed his knowledge. And what must have been his thoughts, how\r\npoignant his reflections as he considered that there, there, enveloped\r\nin those shapeless wraps, there lay the bride whom he had wedded with\r\nhopes so high a score of years before! The mother of his child, the\r\nwife whom he had last seen in the pride of her beauty, the woman from\r\nwhom he had been parted for sixteen years, and who through all those\r\nsixteen years had never been absent from his thoughts for an hour, nor\r\never been aught in them but an abiding, clinging, embittering\r\nmemory—she lay there!\r\n\r\nWhat wonder, if the scene about them rolled away and he saw her again\r\nin the stately gardens at Stapylton, walking, smiling, talking,\r\nflirting, the gayest of the gay, the lightest of the butterflies, the\r\nadmired of all? Or if his heart bled at the remembrance—at that\r\nremembrance and many another? Or again, what wonder if his mind went\r\nback to long hours of brooding in his sombre library, hours given up to\r\nthe rehearsal of grave remonstrances, vain reproofs, bitter complaints,\r\nall destined to meet with defiance? And if his head sank lower, his\r\nhands trembled more senilely, his breast heaved at this picture of the\r\nirrevocable past?\r\n\r\nOf all the strange things wrought in Bristol that night, of all the\r\nstrangely begotten brood of riot and fire, and Reform, none were\r\nstranger than this meeting, if meeting that could be called where one\r\nwas ignorant of the other’s presence, and he would not look upon her\r\nface. For he would not, perhaps he dared not. He stood with bent head,\r\npondering and absorbed, until an uprush of sparks, more fiery than\r\nusual, and the movement of the crowd to avoid them, awoke him from his\r\nthoughts. Then his eyes fell on Mary’s uncovered head and neck, and he\r\ntook the cloak from his own shoulders and put it on her, with a touch\r\nas if he blessed her. She was kneeling beside the couch at the moment,\r\nher head bent to her mother’s, her hair mingling with her mother’s, but\r\nhe contrived to close his eyes and would not see his wife’s face.\r\n\r\nAfter that he moved to the farther side of the couch, where some\r\nsneaking hobbledehoys showed a disposition to break in upon them. And\r\nold as he was, and shaken and weary, he stood sentry there, a gaunt\r\nstooping figure, for long hours, until the prayed-for day began to\r\nbreak above Redcliffe and to discover the grim relics of the night’s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV\r\nTHE MORNING OF MONDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been said that midnight of that Sunday saw the alarm speeding\r\nalong every road by which the forces of order could hope to be\r\nrecruited; nevertheless in Bristol itself nothing was done to stay the\r\nwork of havoc. A change had indeed come over the feeling in the city;\r\nfor to acquiescence had succeeded the most lively alarm, and to\r\napproval, rage and boundless indignation. But the handful of officials\r\nwho all day long had striven, honestly if not very capably, to restore\r\norder, were exhausted; and the public without cohesion or leaders were\r\nin no state to make head against the rioters. So great, indeed, was the\r\nconfusion that a troop of Gloucestershire Yeomanry which rode in soon\r\nafter dark received neither orders nor billets; and being poorly led,\r\nwithdrew within the hour. This, with the tumult at Bath, where the\r\nquarters of the Yeomanry were beset by a mob of Reformers, who would\r\nnot let them go to the rescue, completed the isolation of the city.\r\n\r\nOne man only, indeed, in the midst of that welter, had it in his power\r\nto intervene with effect. And he could not be found. From Queen’s\r\nSquare to Leigh’s Bazaar, where the Third Dragoons stood inactive by\r\ntheir horses; from Leigh’s to the Recruiting Office on College Green,\r\nwhere a couple of non-commissioned officers stood inactive; from the\r\nRecruiting Office to his lodgings in Unity Street, men, panting and\r\nprotesting, in terror for their property, hurried in vain nightmare\r\npursuit of that man. For to such men it seemed impossible that in face\r\nof the damage already done, of thirty houses in flames, of a mob which\r\nhad broken all bounds, of a city disturbed to its entrails, he could\r\nstill refuse to act.\r\n\r\nBut to go to Unity Street was one thing, and to gain speech with\r\nBrereton was another. He had gone to bed. He was asleep. He was not\r\nwell. He was worn out and was resting. The seekers, with the roar of\r\nthe fire in their ears and ruin staring them in the face, heard these\r\nincredible things, and went away, swearing profanely. Nor did anyone,\r\nit would seem, gain speech with him, until the small hours were well\r\nadvanced. Then Arthur Vaughan, unable to abide by the vow he had taken\r\nnot to importune him, arrived, he, too, furious, at the door, and found\r\na knot of gentlemen clamouring for admission.\r\n\r\nVaughan had parted from Sir Robert Vermuyden some hours earlier,\r\nbelieving that, bad as things were, he might make head against the\r\nrioters, if he could rally his constables. But he had found no one\r\nwilling to act without the soldiery; and he was here in the last\r\nresort, determined to compel Colonel Brereton to move, if it were by\r\nmain force. For Vaughan had the law-keeping instincts of an Englishman\r\nand his blood boiled at the sights he had seen in the streets, at the\r\nwanton destruction of property, at the jeopardy of life, at the women\r\nmade homeless, at the men made paupers. Nor was it quite out of his\r\nthoughts that if anything could harm the cause of Reform it was these\r\ndeeds done in its name, these outrages fulfilling to the letter the\r\nworst which its enemies had predicted of it!\r\n\r\nHe spoke a few words to the persons who, angry and nonplussed, were\r\nwrangling at the door, then he pushed his way in, deaf to the\r\nremonstrances of the woman of the house. He did not believe, he could\r\nnot believe the excuse given—that Brereton was in bed. Nero, fiddling\r\nwhile Rome burned, seemed nought beside that! And his surprise was\r\ngreat when, opening the sitting-room door, he saw before him only the\r\nHonourable Bob; who, standing on the hearth-rug, met his indignant look\r\nwith one of forced and sickly amusement.\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens!” Vaughan cried, staring at him. “What are you doing\r\nhere? Where’s the Chief?”\r\n\r\nFlixton shrugged his shoulders. “There,” he said irritably, “it’s no\r\nuse blaming me! Man alive, if he won’t, he won’t! And it’s his\r\nbusiness, not mine!”\r\n\r\n“Then I’d make it mine!” Vaughan retorted. “Where is he?”\r\n\r\nFlixton flicked his thumb in the direction of an inner door. “He’s\r\nthere,” he said. “He’s there safe enough! For the rest, it is easy to\r\nfind fault! Very easy for you, my lad! You’re no longer in the\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\n“There are a good many will leave the service for this!” Vaughan\r\nreplied; and he saw on the instant that the shot told. Flixton’s face\r\nfell, he opened his mouth to reply. But disdaining to listen to\r\nexcuses, of which the speaker’s manner betrayed the shallowness,\r\nVaughan opened the bedroom door and passed in.\r\n\r\nTo his boundless astonishment Brereton was really in bed, with a light\r\nbeside him. Asleep he probably was not, for he rose at once to a\r\nsitting posture and, with wild and dishevelled hair, confronted the\r\nintruder with a mingling of wrath and discomfiture in his looks. His\r\nsword and an undress cap, blue with a silver band, lay beside the\r\ncandle on the table, and Vaughan saw that though in his shirt-sleeves\r\nhe was not otherwise undressed.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Vaughan!” he cried. “What, if you please, does this mean?”\r\n\r\n“That is what I am here to ask you!” Vaughan answered, his face flushed\r\nwith indignation. He was too angry to pick his words. “Are you, can you\r\nbe aware, sir, what is done while you sleep?”\r\n\r\n“Sleep?” Brereton rejoined, with a sombre gleam in his eyes. “Sleep,\r\nman? God knows it is the last thing I do!” He clapped his hand to his\r\nbrow and for a moment remained silent, holding it there. Then, “Sleep\r\nhas been a stranger to me these three nights!” he said.\r\n\r\n“Then what do you do here?” Vaughan answered, in astonishment. And\r\nlooked round the room as if he might find his answer there.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” Brereton rejoined, with a look half suspicious, half cunning.\r\n“That is another matter. But never mind! Never mind! I know what I am\r\ndoing.”\r\n\r\n“Know——”\r\n\r\n“Yes, well!” the soldier replied, bringing his feet to the floor, but\r\ncontinuing to keep his seat on the bed. “Very well, sir, I assure you.”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked aghast at him. “But, Colonel Brereton,” he rejoined, “do\r\nyou consider that you are the only person in this city able to act?\r\nThat without you nothing can be done and nothing can be ventured?”\r\n\r\n“That,” Brereton returned, with the same shrewd look, “is just what I\r\ndo consider! Without me they cannot act! They cannot venture. And I—go\r\nto bed!”\r\n\r\nHe chuckled at it, as at a jest; and Vaughan, checked by the oddity of\r\nhis manner, and with a growing suspicion in his mind, knew not what to\r\nthink. For answer, at last, “I fear that you will not be able to go to\r\nbed, Colonel Brereton,” he said gravely, “when the moment comes to face\r\nthe consequences.”\r\n\r\n“The consequences?”\r\n\r\n“You cannot think that a city such as this can be destroyed, and no one\r\nbe called to account?”\r\n\r\n“But the civil power——”\r\n\r\n“Is impotent!” Vaughan answered, with returning indignation, “in the\r\nface of the disorder now prevailing! I warn you! A little more delay, a\r\nlittle more license, let the people’s passions be fanned by farther\r\nimpunity, and nothing, nothing, I warn you, Colonel Brereton,” he\r\ncontinued with emphasis, “can save the major part of the city from\r\ndestruction!”\r\n\r\nBrereton rose to his feet, a certain wildness in his aspect. “Good\r\nGod!” he exclaimed. “You don’t mean it! Do you really mean it, Vaughan?\r\nBut—but what can I do?” He sank down on the bed again, and stared at\r\nhis companion. “Eh? What can I do? Nothing!”\r\n\r\n“Everything!”\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet. “Everything! You say everything?” he cried, and\r\nhis tone rose shrill and excited. “But you don’t know!” he continued,\r\nlowering his voice as quickly as he had raised it and laying his hand\r\non Vaughan’s sleeve—“you don’t know! You don’t know! But I know! Man, I\r\nwas set in command here on purpose. If I acted they counted on putting\r\nthe blame on me. And if I didn’t act—they would still put the blame on\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nHis cunning look shocked Vaughan.\r\n\r\n“But even so, sir,” he answered, “you can do your duty.”\r\n\r\n“My duty?” Brereton repeated, raising his voice again. “And do you\r\nthink it is my duty to precipitate a useless struggle? To begin a civil\r\nwar? To throw away the lives of my own men and cut down innocent folk?\r\nTo fill the streets with blood and slaughter? And the end the same?”\r\n\r\n“Ay, sir, I do,” Vaughan answered sternly. “If by so doing a worse\r\ncalamity may be averted! And, for your men’s lives, are they not\r\nsoldiers? For your own life, are you not a soldier? And will you shun a\r\nsoldier’s duty?”\r\n\r\nBrereton clapped his hand to his brow, and, holding it there, paced the\r\nroom in his shirt and breeches.\r\n\r\n“My God! My God!” he cried, as he went. “I do not know what to do! But\r\nif—if it be as bad as you say——”\r\n\r\n“It is as bad, and worse!”\r\n\r\n“I might try once more,” looking at Vaughan with a troubled, undecided\r\neye, “what showing my men might do? What do you think?”\r\n\r\nVaughan thought that if he were once on the spot, if he saw with his\r\nown eyes the lawlessness of the mob, he might act. And he assented.\r\n“Shall I pass on the order, sir,” he added, “while you dress?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think you may. Yes, certainly. Tell the officer commanding to\r\nmarch his men to the Square and I’ll meet him there.”\r\n\r\nVaughan waited for no more. He suspected that the burden of\r\nresponsibility had proved too heavy for Brereton’s mind. He suspected\r\nthat the Colonel had brooded upon his position between a Whig\r\nGovernment and a Whig mob until the notion that he was sent there to be\r\na scapegoat had become a fixed idea; and with it the determination that\r\nhe would not be forced into strong measures, had become also a fixed\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nSuch a man, if he was to be blamed, was to be pitied also. And Vaughan,\r\neven in the heat of his indignation, did pity him. But he entertained\r\nno such feeling for the Honourable Bob, and in delivering the order to\r\nhim he wasted no words. After Flixton had left the room, however, he\r\nremembered that he had noted a shade of indecision in the aide’s\r\nmanner. And warned by it, he followed him. “I will come with you to\r\nLeigh’s,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Better come all the way,” Flixton replied, with covert insolence.\r\n“We’ve half a dozen spare horses.”\r\n\r\nThe next moment he was sorry he had spoken. For, “Done with you!”\r\nVaughan cried. “There’s nothing I’d like better!”\r\n\r\nFlixton grunted. He had overreached himself, but he could not withdraw\r\nthe offer.\r\n\r\nVaughan was by his side, and plainly meant to accompany him.\r\n\r\nLet no man think that the past is done with, though he sever it as he\r\nwill. The life from which he has cut himself off in disgust has none\r\nthe less cast the tendrils of custom about his heart, which shoot and\r\nbud when he least expects it. Vaughan stood in the doorway of the\r\nstable while the men bridled. He viewed the long line of tossing heads,\r\nand the smoky lanthorns fixed to the stall-posts; he sniffed the old\r\nfamiliar smell of “Stables.” And he felt his heart leap to the past.\r\nAy, even as it leapt a few minutes later, when he rode down College\r\nGreen, now in darkness, now in glare, and heard beside him the familiar\r\nclank of spur and scabbard, the rattle of the bridle-chains, and the\r\ntramp of the shod hoofs. On the men’s left, as they descended the slope\r\nat a walk, the tall houses stood up in bright light; below them on the\r\nright the Float gleamed darkly; above them, the mist glowed red. Wild\r\nhurrahing and an indescribable babel of shouts, mingled with the\r\nrushing roar of the flames, rose from the Square. When the troop rode\r\ninto it with the first dawn, they saw that two whole sides—with the\r\nexception of a pair of houses—were burnt or burning. In addition a\r\nmonster warehouse was on fire in the rear, a menace to every building\r\nto windward of it.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel, with Flixton attending him, fell in on the flank, as the\r\ntroop entered the Square. But apparently—since he gave no orders—he did\r\nnot share the tingling indignation which Vaughan experienced as he\r\nviewed the scene. A few persons were still engaged in removing their\r\ngoods from houses on the south side; but save for these, the decent and\r\nrespectable had long since fled the place, and left it a prey to all\r\nthat was most vile and dangerous in the population of a rough seaport.\r\nThe rabble, left to themselves, and constantly recruited as the news\r\nflew abroad, had cast off the fear of reprisals, and believed that at\r\nlast the city was their own. Vaughan saw that if the dragoons were to\r\nact with effect they must act at once. Nor was he alone in this\r\nopinion. The troop had not ridden far into the open before he was\r\nshocked, as well as astonished, by the appearance of Sir Robert\r\nVermuyden, who stumbled across the Square towards them. He was\r\nbareheaded—for in an encounter with a prowler who had approached too\r\nnear he had lost his hat; he was without his cloak, though the morning\r\nwas cold. His face, too, unshorn and haggard, added to the tragedy of\r\nhis appearance; yet in a sense he was himself, and he tried to steady\r\nhis voice, as, unaware of Vaughan’s presence, he accosted the nearest\r\ntrooper.\r\n\r\n“Who is in command, my man?” he said.\r\n\r\nFlixton, who had also recognised him, thrust his horse forward. “Good\r\nHeavens, Sir Robert!” he cried. “What are you doing here? And in this\r\nstate?”\r\n\r\n“Never mind me,” the Baronet replied. “Are you in command?”\r\n\r\nColonel Brereton had halted his men. He came forward. “No, Sir Robert,”\r\nhe said. “I am. And very sorry to see you in this plight.”\r\n\r\n“Take no heed of me, sir,” Sir Robert replied sternly. Through how many\r\nhours, hours long as days, had he not watched for the soldiers’ coming!\r\n“Take no heed of me, sir,” he repeated. “Unless you have orders to\r\nabandon the loyal people of Bristol to their fate—act! Act, sir! If you\r\nhave eyes, you can see that the mob are beginning to fire the south\r\nside on which the shipping abuts. Let that take fire and you cannot\r\nsave Bristol!”\r\n\r\nBrereton looked in the direction indicated, but he did not answer.\r\nFlixton did. “We understand all that,” he said, somewhat cavalierly.\r\n“We see all that, Sir Robert, believe me. But the Colonel has to think\r\nof many things; of more than the immediate moment. We are the only\r\nforce in Bristol, and——”\r\n\r\n“Apparently Bristol is no better for you!” Sir Robert replied with\r\ntremulous passion.\r\n\r\nSo far Vaughan, a horse’s length behind Brereton and his aide, heard\r\nwhat passed; but with half his mind. For his eyes, roving in the\r\ndirection whence Sir Robert had come, had discerned, amid a medley of\r\ngoods and persons huddled about the statue, in the middle of the\r\nSquare, a single figure, slender, erect, in black and white, which\r\nappeared to be gazing towards him. At first he resisted as incredible\r\nthe notion which besieged him—at sight of that figure. But the longer\r\nhe looked the more sure he became that it was, it was Mary! Mary,\r\ngazing towards him out of that welter of miserable and shivering\r\nfigures, as if she looked to him for help!\r\n\r\nPerhaps he should have asked Sir Robert’s leave, to go to her. Perhaps\r\nColonel Brereton’s to quit the troop, which he had volunteered to\r\naccompany. But he gave no thought to either. He slipped from his\r\nsaddle, flung the reins to the nearest man, and, crossing the roadway\r\nin three strides, he made towards her through the skulking groups who\r\nwarily watched the dragoons, or hailed them tipsily, and in the name of\r\nReform invited them to drink.\r\n\r\nAnd Mary, who had risen in alarm to her feet, and was gazing after her\r\nfather, her only hope, her one protection through the night, saw\r\nVaughan coming, tall and stern, through the prowling night-birds about\r\nher, as if she had seen an angel! She said not a word, when he came\r\nnear and she was sure. Nor did he say more than “Mary!” But he threw\r\ninto that word so much of love, of joy, of relief, of forgiveness—and\r\nof the appeal for forgiveness—that it brought her to his arms, it left\r\nher clinging to his breast. All his coldness in Parliament Street, his\r\ncruelty on the coach, her father’s opposition, all were forgotten by\r\nher, as if they had not been!\r\n\r\nAnd for him, she might have been the weakest of the weak, and fickle\r\nand changeable as the weather, she might have been all that she was\r\nnot—though he had yet to learn that and how she had carried herself\r\nthat night—but he knew that in spite of all he loved her. She had the\r\nold charm for him! She was still the one woman in the world for him!\r\nAnd she was in peril. But for that there is no knowing how long he\r\nmight have held her. That thought, however, presently overcame all\r\nothers, made him insensible even to the sweetness of that embrace, ay,\r\neven put words in his mouth.\r\n\r\n“How come you here?” he cried. “How come you here, Mary?”\r\n\r\nShe freed herself and pointed to her mother. “I am with her,” she said.\r\n“We had to bring her here. It was all we could do.”\r\n\r\nHe lowered his eyes and saw what she was guarding; and he understood\r\nsomething of the tragedy of that night. From the couch came a low\r\ncontinuous moaning which made the hair rise on his head. He looked at\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n“She is insensible,” she said quietly. “She does not know anything.”\r\n\r\n“We must remove her!” he said.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, and from him to that part of the Square where the\r\nrioters wrought still at their fiendish work. And she shuddered. “Where\r\ncan we take her?” she answered. “They are beginning to burn that side\r\nalso.”\r\n\r\n“Then we must remove them!” he answered sternly.\r\n\r\n“That’s sense!” a hearty voice cried at his elbow. “And the first I’ve\r\nheard this night!” On which he became aware of Miss Sibson, or rather\r\nof a stout body swathed in queer wrappings, who spoke in the\r\nschoolmistress’s tones, and though pale with fatigue continued to show\r\na brave face to the mischief about her. “That’s talking!” she\r\ncontinued. “Do that, and you’ll do a man’s work!”\r\n\r\n“Will you have courage if I leave you?” he asked. And when Mary,\r\nbravely but with inward terror, answered “Yes,” he told her in brief\r\nsentences—with his eyes on the movements in the Square—what to do, if\r\nthe rabble made a rush in that direction, and what to do, if the troops\r\ncharged too near them, and how, by lying down, to avoid danger if the\r\ncrowd resorted to firearms, since untrained men fired high. Then he\r\ntouched Miss Sibson on the arm. “You’ll not leave her?” he said.\r\n\r\n“God bless the man, no!” the schoolmistress replied. “Though, for the\r\nmatter of that, she’s as well able to take care of me as I of her!”\r\n\r\nWhich was not quite true. Or why in after-days did Miss Sibson, at many\r\na cosy whist-party and over many a glass of hot negus, tell of a\r\nparticular box on the ear with which she routed a young rascal, more\r\nforward than civil? Ay, and dilate with boasting on the way his teeth\r\nhad rattled, and the gibes with which his fellows had seen him driven\r\nfrom the field?\r\n\r\nBut, if not quite true, it satisfied Vaughan. He went from them in a\r\ncold heat, and finding Sir Robert, still at words and almost at blows\r\nwith the officers, was going to strike in, when another did so.\r\nDaylight was slowly overcoming the glare of the fire and dispelling the\r\nshadows which had lain the deeper and more confusing for that glare. It\r\nlaid the grey of reality upon the scene, showing all things in their\r\ntrue colours, the ruins more ghastly, the pale licking flames more\r\ndevilish. The fire, which had swept two sides of the Square, leaving\r\nonly charred skeletons of houses, with vacant sockets gaping to the\r\nsky, was now attacking the third side, of which the two most westerly\r\nhouses were in flames. It was this, and the knowledge of its meaning,\r\nthat, before Vaughan could interpose, flung at Colonel Brereton a man\r\nwhite with passion, and stuttering under the pressure of feelings too\r\nviolent for utterance.\r\n\r\n“Do you see? Do you see?” he cried brandishing his fist in Brereton’s\r\nface—it was Cooke. “You traitor! If the fire catches the fourth house\r\non that side, it’ll get the shipping! The shipping, d’you hear, you\r\nRadical? Then the Lord knows what’ll escape? But, thank God, you’ll\r\nhang! You’ll—if it gets to the fourth house, I tell you, it’ll catch\r\nthe rigging by the Great Crane! Are you going to move?”\r\n\r\nVaughan did not wait for Brereton’s answer. “We must charge, Colonel\r\nBrereton!” he cried, in a voice which burst the bonds of discipline,\r\nand showed that he was determined that others should burst them also.\r\n“Colonel Brereton,” he repeated, setting his horse in motion, “we must\r\ncharge without a moment’s delay!”\r\n\r\n“Wait!” Brereton answered hoarsely. “Wait! Let me——”\r\n\r\n“We must charge!” Vaughan replied, his face pale, his mind made up. And\r\nturning in his saddle he waved his hand to the men. “Forward!” he\r\ncried, raising his voice to its utmost. “Trot! Charge, men, and charge\r\nhome!”\r\n\r\nHe spurred his horse to the front, and the whole troop, some thirty\r\nstrong, set in motion by the magic of his voice, followed him. Even\r\nBrereton, after a moment’s hesitation, fell in a length behind him. The\r\nhorses broke into a trot, then into a canter. As they bore down along\r\nthe south side upon the southwest corner, a roar of rage and alarm rose\r\nfrom the rioters collected there; and scores and hundreds fled,\r\nscreaming, and sought safety to right and left.\r\n\r\nVaughan had time to turn to Brereton, and cry, “I beg your pardon, sir;\r\nI could not help it!” The next moment he and the leading troopers were\r\nupon the fleeing, dodging, ducking crowd; were upon them and among\r\nthem. Half a dozen swords gleamed high and fell, the horses did the\r\nrest. The rabble, taken by surprise, made no resistance. In a trice the\r\ndragoons were through the mob, and the roadway showed clear behind\r\nthem. Save where here and there a man rose slowly and limped away,\r\nleaving a track of blood at his heels.\r\n\r\n“Steady! Steady!” Vaughan cried. “Halt! Halt! Right about!” and then,\r\n“Charge!”\r\n\r\nHe led the men back over the same ground, chasing from it such as had\r\ndared to return, or to gather upon the skirts of the troop. Then he led\r\nhis men along the east side, clearing that also and driving the rioters\r\nin a panic into the side streets. Resistance worthy of the name there\r\nwas none, until, having led the troop back across the open Square and\r\ncleared that of the skulkers, he came back again to the southwest\r\ncorner. There the rabble, rallying from their surprise, had taken up a\r\nposition in the forecourts of the houses, where they were protected by\r\nthe railings. They met the soldiers with a volley of stones, and half a\r\ndozen pistol-shots. A horse fell, two or three of the men were hit; for\r\nan instant there was confusion. Then Vaughan spurred his horse into one\r\nof the forecourts, and, followed by half a dozen troopers, cleared it,\r\nand the next and the next; on which, volunteers who sprang up, as by\r\nmagic, at the first act of authority, entered the houses, killed one\r\nrioter, flung out the rest, and extinguished the flames. Still the more\r\ndetermined of the rascals, seeing the small number against them, clung\r\nto the place and the forecourts; and, driven from one court, retreated\r\nto another, and still protected by the railings, kept the troopers at\r\nbay with missiles.\r\n\r\nVaughan, panting with his exertions, took in the position, and looked\r\nround for Brereton.\r\n\r\n“We must send for the Fourteenth, sir!” he said. “We are not enough to\r\ndo more than hold them in check.”\r\n\r\n“There is nothing else for it now,” Brereton replied, with a gloomy\r\nface and in such a tone that the very men shrank from looking at him;\r\nunderstanding, the very dullest of them, what his feelings must be, and\r\nhow great his shame, who, thus superseded, saw another successful in\r\nthat which it had been his duty to attempt.\r\n\r\nAnd what were Vaughan’s feelings? He dared not allow himself the luxury\r\nof a glance towards the middle of the Square. Much less—but for a\r\ndifferent reason—had he the heart to meet Brereton’s eyes. “I’m not in\r\nuniform, sir,” he said. “I can pass through the crowd. If you think\r\nfit, and will give me the order, I’ll fetch them, sir?”\r\n\r\nBrereton nodded without a word, and Vaughan wheeled his horse to start.\r\nAs he pushed it clear of the troop he passed Flixton.\r\n\r\n“That was capital!” the Honourable Bob cried heartily. “Capital! We’ll\r\nhandle ’em easily now, till you come back!”\r\n\r\nVaughan did not answer, nor did he look at Flixton; his look would have\r\nconveyed too much. Instead, he put his horse into a trot along the east\r\nside of the Square, and, regardless of a dropping fire of stones, made\r\nfor the opening beside the ruins of the Mansion House. At the last\r\nmoment, he looked back, to see Mary if it were possible. But he had\r\nwaited too long, he could distinguish only confused forms about the\r\nbase of the statue; and he must look to himself. His road to Keynsham\r\nlay through the lowest and most dangerous part of the city.\r\n\r\nBut though the streets were full of rough men, navigators and seamen,\r\nwhose faces were set towards the Square, and who eyed him suspiciously\r\nas he rode by them, none made any attempt to stop him. And when he had\r\ncrossed Bristol Bridge and had gained the more open outskirts towards\r\nTotterdown, where he could urge his horse to a gallop, the pale faces\r\nof men and women at door and window announced that it was not only the\r\nupper or the middle class which had taken fright, and longed for help\r\nand order. Through Brislington and up Durley Hill he pounded; and it\r\nmust be confessed that his heart was light. Whatever came of it, though\r\nthey court-martialled him, were that possible, though they tried him,\r\nhe had done something, he had done right, and he had succeeded.\r\nWhatever the consequences, whatever the results to himself, he had\r\ndared; and his daring, it might be, had saved a city! Of the charge,\r\nindeed, he thought nothing, though she had seen it. It was nothing, for\r\nthe danger had been of the slightest, the defence contemptible. But in\r\nsetting discipline at defiance, in superseding the officer commanding\r\nthe troops, in taking the whole responsibility on his own shoulders—a\r\nresponsibility which few would have dreamed of taking—there he had\r\ndared, there he had played the man, there he had risen to the occasion!\r\nIf he had been a failure in the House, here, by good fortune, he had\r\nnot been a failure. And she would know it. Oh, happy thought! And happy\r\nman, riding out of Bristol with the murk and smoke and fog at his back,\r\nand the sunshine on his face!\r\n\r\nFor the sun was above the horizon as, with full heart, he rode down the\r\nhill into Keynsham, and heard the bugle sound “Boots and saddles!” and\r\npoured into sympathetic ears—-and to an accompaniment of strong\r\nwords—the tale of the night’s doings.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAn hour later he rode in with the Fourteenth and heard the Blues\r\nwelcomed with thanksgiving, in the very streets which had stoned them\r\nfrom the city twenty-four hours before. By that time the officer in\r\ncommand of the main body of the Fourteenth at Gloucester had posted\r\nover, followed by another troop, and, seeing the state of things, had\r\ntaken his own line and assumed, though junior to Colonel Brereton, the\r\ncommand of the forces.\r\n\r\nAfter that the thing became a military evolution. One hour, two hours\r\nat most, and twenty charges along the quays and through the streets\r\nsufficed—at the cost of a dozen lives—to convince the most obstinate of\r\nthe rabble of several things. _Imprimis_, that the reign of terror was\r\nnot come. On the contrary, that law and order, and also Red Judges,\r\nsurvived. That Reform did not spell fire and pillage, and that at these\r\nthings even a Reforming Government could not wink. In a word, by noon\r\nof that day, Monday, and many and many an hour before the ruins had\r\nceased to smoke, the bubble which might have been easily burst before\r\nwas pricked. Order reigned in Bristol, patrols were everywhere, two\r\nthousand zealous constables guarded the streets. And though troops\r\nstill continued to hasten by every road to the scene, though all\r\nEngland trembled with alarm, and distant Woolwich sent its guns, and\r\nGreenwich horsed them, and the Yeomanry of six counties mustered on\r\nClifton Down, or were quartered on the public buildings, the thing was\r\nnought by that time. Arthur Vaughan had pricked it in the early morning\r\nlight when he cried “Charge!” in Queen’s Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI\r\nFORGIVENESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first wave of thankfulness for crowning blessings or vital escapes\r\nhas a softening quality against which the hearts of few are wholly\r\nproof. Old things, old hopes, old ties, old memories return on that\r\ngentle flood tide to eyes and mind. The barriers raised by time, the\r\nfurrows of ancient wrong are levelled with the plain, and the generous\r\nbreast cries “_Non nobis!_ Not to us only be the benefit!”\r\n\r\nLady Lansdowne, with something of this kind in her thoughts and pity in\r\nher heart, sat eying Miss Sibson in a silence which disclosed nothing,\r\nand which the schoolmistress found irksome. Miss Sibson could beard Sir\r\nRobert at need; but of the great of her own sex—and she knew Lady\r\nLansdowne for a very great lady, indeed—her sturdy nature went a little\r\nin awe. Had her ladyship encroached indeed, Miss Sibson would have\r\nknown how to put her in her place. But a Lady Lansdowne perfectly\r\npolite and wholly silent imposed on her. She rubbed her nose and was\r\nglad when the visitor spoke.\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert has not seen her, then?”\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson smoothed out the lap of her dress. “No, my lady, not since\r\nshe was brought into the house. Indeed, I can’t say that he saw her\r\nbefore, for he never looked at her.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think that I could see her?”\r\n\r\nThe schoolmistress hesitated. “Well, my lady,” she said, “I am afraid\r\nthat she will hardly live through the day.”\r\n\r\n“Then he must see her,” Lady Lansdowne replied quickly. And Miss Sibson\r\nobserved with surprise that there were tears in the great lady’s eyes.\r\n“He must see her. Is she conscious?”\r\n\r\n“She’s so-so,” Miss Sibson answered more at her ease. After all, the\r\ngreat lady was human, it seemed. “She wanders, and thinks that she is\r\nin France, my lady; believes there’s a revolution, and that they are\r\ncome to take her to prison. Her mind harps continually on things of\r\nthat kind. And not much wonder either! But, then again she’s herself.\r\nSo that you don’t know from one minute to another whether she’s\r\nsensible or not.”\r\n\r\n“Poor thing!” Lady Lansdowne murmured. “Poor woman!” Her lips moved\r\nwithout sound. Presently, “Her daughter is with her?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“She has scarcely left her for a minute since she was carried in,” Miss\r\nSibson answered warmly. And to her eyes, too, there rose something like\r\na tear. “Only with difficulty have I made her take the most necessary\r\nrest. But if your ladyship pleases, I will ask whether she will see\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\n“Do so, if you please.”\r\n\r\nMiss Sibson retired for this purpose, and Lady Lansdowne, left to\r\nherself, rose and looked from the window. As soon as it had been\r\npossible to move her, the dying woman had been carried into the nearest\r\nhouse which had escaped the flames, and Lady Lansdowne, gazing out,\r\nlooked on the scene of conflict, saw lines of ruins, still asmoke in\r\nparts, and discerned between the scorched limbs of trees, from which\r\nthe last foliage had fallen, the blackened skeletons of houses. A\r\ngaping crowd was moving round the Square, under the eyes of special\r\nconstables, who, distinguished by white bands on their arms, guarded\r\nthe various entrances. Hundreds, doubtless, who would fain have robbed\r\nwere there to stare; but for the most part the guilty shunned the\r\nscene, and the gazers consisted mainly of sightseers from the country,\r\nor from Bath, or of knots of merchants and traders and the like who\r\nargued, some that this was what came of Reform, others that not Reform\r\nbut the refusal of Reform was to blame for it.\r\n\r\nPresently she saw Sir Robert’s stately figure threading its way through\r\nthe crowd. He walked erect, but with effort; yet though her heart\r\nswelled with pity, it was not with pity for him. He would have his\r\ndaughter and in a few days, in a few weeks, in a few months at most,\r\nthe clouds would pass and leave him to enjoy the clear evening of his\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nBut for her whom he had taken to his house twenty years before in the\r\nbloom of her beauty, the envied, petted, spoiled child of fortune, who\r\nhad sinned so lightly and paid so dearly, and who now lay distraught at\r\nthe close of all, what evening remained? What gleam of light? What\r\ncomfort at the last?\r\n\r\nIn her behalf, the heart which Whig pride, and family prejudice, and\r\nthe cares of riches had failed to harden, swelled to bursting. “He must\r\nforgive her!” she ejaculated. “He shall forgive her!” And gliding to\r\nthe door she stayed Mary, who was in the act of entering.\r\n\r\n“I must see your father,” she said. “He is mounting the stairs now. Go\r\nto your mother, my dear, and when I ring, do you come!”\r\n\r\nWhat Mary read in her face, of feminine pity and generous purpose, need\r\nnot be told. Whatever it was, the girl seized the woman’s hand, kissed\r\nit with wet eyes, and fled. And when Sir Robert, ushered upstairs by\r\nMiss Sibson, entered the room and looked round for his daughter, he\r\nfound in her stead the wife of his enemy.\r\n\r\nOn the instant he remembered the errand on which she had sought him six\r\nmonths before, and he was quick to construe her presence by its light,\r\nand to feel resentment. The wrong of years, the daily, hourly wrong,\r\ncommitted not against him only but against the innocent and the\r\nhelpless, this woman would have him forgive at a word; merely because\r\nthe doer, who had had no ruth, no pity, no scruples, hung on the verge\r\nof that step which all, just and unjust, must take! And some, he knew,\r\nstanding where he stood, would forgive; would forgive with their lips,\r\nusing words which meant nought to the sayer, though they soothed the\r\nhearers. But he was no hypocrite; he would not forgive. Forgive? Great\r\nHeaven, that any should think that the wrongs of a lifetime could be\r\nforgiven in an hour! At a word! Beside a bed! As soon might the\r\ngrinding wear of years be erased from the heart, the wrinkles of care\r\nfrom the brow, the snows of age from the head! As easily might a word\r\ngive back to the old the spring and flame and vigour of their youth!\r\n\r\nSomething of what he thought impressed itself on his face. Lady\r\nLansdowne marked the sullen drop of his eyebrows, and the firm set of\r\nthe lower face; but she did not flinch. “I came upon your name,” she\r\nsaid, “in the report of the dreadful doings here—in the ‘Mercury,’ this\r\nmorning. I hope, Sir Robert, I shall be pardoned for intruding.”\r\n\r\nHe murmured something, as much no as yes, and with a manner as frigid\r\nas his breeding permitted. And standing—she had reseated herself—he\r\ncontinued to look at her, his lips drawn down.\r\n\r\n“I grieve,” she continued, “to find the truth more sad than the\r\nreport.”\r\n\r\n“I do not know that you can help us,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Because,” she rejoined, looking at him softly, “you will not let me\r\nhelp you. Sir Robert——”\r\n\r\n“Lady Lansdowne!” He broke in abruptly, using her name with emphasis,\r\nusing it with intention. “Once before you came to me. Doubtless you\r\nremember. Now, let me say at once, that if your errand to-day be the\r\nsame, and I think it likely that it is the same——”\r\n\r\n“It is not the same,” she replied with emotion which she did not try to\r\nhide. “It is not the same! For then there was time. And now there is no\r\ntime. Let a day, it may be an hour, pass, and at the cost of all you\r\npossess you will not be able to buy that which you can still have for\r\nnothing!”\r\n\r\n“And what is that?” he asked, frowning.\r\n\r\n“An easy heart.” He had not looked for that answer, and he started.\r\n“Sir Robert,” she continued, rising from her seat, and speaking with\r\neven deeper feeling, “forgive her! Forgive her, I implore you. The\r\nwrong is past, is done, is over! Your daughter is restored——”\r\n\r\n“But not by her!” he cried, taking her up quickly. “Not by her act!” he\r\nrepeated sternly, “or with her will! And what has she done that I\r\nshould forgive? I, whose life she blighted, whose pride she stabbed,\r\nwhose hopes she crushed? Whom she left solitary, wifeless, childless\r\nthrough the years of my strength, the years that she cannot, that no\r\none can give back to me? Through the long summer days that were a\r\nweariness, and the dark winter days that were a torpor? Yet—yet I could\r\nforgive her, Lady Lansdowne, I could forgive her, I do forgive her\r\nthat!”\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert!”\r\n\r\n“That, all that!” he continued, with a gesture and in a tone of\r\nbitterness which harmonised but ill with the words he uttered. “All\r\nthat she ever did amiss to me I forgive her. But—but the child’s wrong,\r\nnever! Had she relented indeed, at the last, had she of her own motion,\r\nof her own free will given me back my daughter, had she repented and\r\nundone the wrong, then—but no matter! she did not! She did not one,” he\r\nrepeated with agitation, “she did not any of these things. And I ask,\r\nwhat has she done that I should forgive her?”\r\n\r\nShe did not answer him at once, and when she did it was in a tone so\r\nlow as to be barely audible.\r\n\r\n“I cannot answer that,” she said. “But is it the only question? Is\r\nthere not another question, Sir Robert—not what she has done, or left\r\nundone, but what you—forgive me and bear with me—have left undone, or\r\ndone amiss? Are you—you clear of all spot or trespass, innocent of all\r\nblame or erring? When she came to you a young girl, a young bride—and,\r\noh, I remember her, the sunshine was not brighter, she was a child of\r\nair rather than of earth, so fair and heedless, so capricious, and yet\r\nso innocent!—did you in the first days never lose patience? Never fail\r\nto make allowance? Never preach when wisdom would have smiled, never\r\nlook grave when she longed for lightness, never scold when it had been\r\nbetter to laugh? Did you never forget that she was a score of years\r\nyounger than you, and a hundred years more frivolous? Or”—Lady\r\nLansdowne’s tone was a mere whisper now—“if you are clear of all\r\noffence against her, are you clear of all offence against any, of all\r\ntrespass? Have you no need to be forgiven, no need, no——”\r\n\r\nHer voice died away into silence. She left the appeal unfinished.\r\n\r\nSir Robert paced the room. And other scenes than those on which he had\r\ntaught himself to brood, other days than those later days of wasted\r\nsummers and solitary winters, of dulness and decay, rose to his memory.\r\nSombre moods by which it had pleased him—at what a cost!—to make his\r\ndispleasure known. Sarcastic words, warrant for the facile retort that\r\nfollowed, curt judgments and ill-timed reproofs; and always the sense\r\nof outraged dignity to freeze the manner and embitter the tone.\r\n\r\nSo much, so much which he had forgotten came back to him as he walked\r\nthe room with averted face! While Lady Lansdowne waited with her hand\r\non the bell. Minutes were passing, minutes; who knew how precious they\r\nmight be? And with them was passing his opportunity.\r\n\r\nHe spoke at last. “I will see her,” he said huskily.\r\n\r\nAnd on that Lady Lansdowne performed a last act of kindness. She said\r\nnothing, bestowed no thanks. But when Mary entered—pale, yet with that\r\ncomposure which love teaches the least experienced—she was gone. Nor as\r\nshe drove in all the pomp of her liveries and outriders through Bath,\r\nthrough Corsham, through Chippenham, did those who ran out to watch my\r\nlady’s four greys go by, see her face as the face of an angel. But Lady\r\nLouisa, flying down the steps to meet her—four at a time and\r\nhoidenishly—was taken to her arms, unscolded; and knew by instinct that\r\nthis was the time to pet and be petted, to confess and be forgiven, and\r\nto learn in the stillness of her mother’s room those thrilling lessons\r\nof life, which her governess had not imparted, nor Mrs. Fairchild\r\napproved.\r\n\r\n_But more than wisdom sees, love knows.\r\nWhat eye has scanned the perfume of the rose?\r\nHas any grasped the low grey mist which stands\r\nGhost-like at eve above the sheeted lands?_\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sir Robert paused on the threshold of the room—_her_ room,\r\nwhich he had first entered two-and-twenty years before. And as the then\r\nand the now, the contrast between the past and the present, forced\r\nthemselves upon him, what could he do but pause and bow his head? In\r\nthe room a voice, her voice, yet unlike her voice, high, weak, never\r\nceasing, was talking as from a great distance, from another world;\r\ntalking, talking, never ceasing. It filled the room. Yet it did not\r\ncome from a world so distant as he at first fancied, hearing it; a\r\nworld that was quite aloof. For when, after he had listened for a time\r\nin the shadow by the door, his daughter led him forward, Lady Sybil’s\r\neyes took note of their approach, though she recognised neither of\r\nthem. Her mind was still busy amid the scenes of the riot; twisting and\r\nweaving them, it seemed, into a piece with old impressions of the\r\nFrench Terror, made on her mind in childhood by talk heard at her\r\nnurse’s knee.\r\n\r\n“They are coming! They are coming now,” she muttered, her bright eyes\r\nfixed on his. “But they shall not take her. They shall not take her,”\r\nshe repeated. “Hide behind me, Mary. Hide, child! Don’t tremble! They\r\nshan’t take you. One neck’s enough and mine is growing thin. It used\r\nnot to be thin. But that’s right. Hide, and they’ll not see you, and\r\nwhen I am gone you’ll escape. Hush! Here they are!” And then in a\r\nlouder tone, “I am ready,” she said, “I am quite ready.”\r\n\r\nMary leant over her.\r\n\r\n“Mother!” she cried, unable to bear the scene in silence. “Mother!\r\nDon’t you know me?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” the dying woman answered, a look of terror crossing her face.\r\n“Hush, child! Don’t speak! I’m ready, gentlemen; I will go with you. I\r\nam not afraid. My neck is small, and it will be but a squeeze.” And she\r\ntried to raise herself in the bed.\r\n\r\nMary laid gentle hands on her, and restrained her. “Mother,” she said.\r\n“Mother! Don’t you know me? I am Mary.”\r\n\r\nBut Lady Sybil, heedless of her, looked beyond her, with fear and\r\nsuspicion in her eyes. “Yes,” she said. “I know you. I know you. I know\r\nyou. But who is—that? Who is that?”\r\n\r\n“My father. It is my father. Don’t you know him?”\r\n\r\nBut still, “Who is it? Who is it?” Lady Sybil continued to ask. “Who is\r\nit?”\r\n\r\nMary burst into tears.\r\n\r\n“What does he want? What does he want? What does he want?” the dying\r\nwoman asked in endless, unreasoning repetition.\r\n\r\nSir Robert had entered the room in the full belief that with the best\r\nof wills it would be hard, it would be well-nigh impossible to forgive;\r\nto forgive his wife with more than the lips. But when he heard her,\r\nweak and helpless as she was, thinking of another; when he understood\r\nthat she who had done so great a wrong to the child was willing to give\r\nup her own life for the child; when he felt the sudden drag at his\r\nheart-strings of many an old and sacred recollection, shared only by\r\nher, and which that voice, that face, that form brought back, he fell\r\non his knees by the bed.\r\n\r\nShe shrank from him, terrified. “What does he want?” she repeated.\r\n\r\n“Sybil,” he said, in a husky voice, “I want your forgiveness, Sybil,\r\nwife! Do you hear me? Will you forgive me? Can you forgive me, late as\r\nit is?”\r\n\r\nStrange to say, his voice pierced the confusion which filled the sick\r\nbrain. She looked at him steadily and long; and she sighed, but she did\r\nnot answer.\r\n\r\n“Sybil,” he repeated in a quavering voice. “Do you not know me? Don’t\r\nyou remember me? I am your husband.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know,” she muttered.\r\n\r\n“This is your daughter.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled.\r\n\r\n“Our daughter,” he repeated. “Our daughter!”\r\n\r\n“Mary?” she murmured. “Mary?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Mary.”\r\n\r\nShe smiled faintly on him. Mary’s head was touching his, but she did\r\nnot answer. She remained looking at them. They could not tell whether\r\nshe understood, or was slipping away again. He took her hand and\r\npressed it gently. “Do you hear me?” he said. “If I was harsh to you in\r\nthe old days, if I made mistakes, if I wronged you, I want you—wife,\r\nsay that you forgive me.”\r\n\r\n“I—forgive you,” she murmured. A faint gleam of mischief, of laughter,\r\nof the old Lady Sybil, shone for an instant in her eyes, as if she knew\r\nthat she had the upper hand. “I forgive you—everything,” she murmured.\r\nYes, for certain now, she was slipping away.\r\n\r\nMary took her other hand. But she did not speak again. And before the\r\nwatch on the table beside her had ticked many times she had slipped\r\naway for good, with that gleam of triumph in her eyes—forgiving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII\r\nIN THE MOURNING COACH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a platitude that the flood is followed by the ebb. In the heat of\r\naction, and while its warmth cheered his spirits, Arthur Vaughan felt\r\nthat he had done something. True, what he had done brought him no\r\nnearer to making his political dream a reality. Not for him the\r\npromise,\r\n\r\n_It shall be thine in danger’s hour\r\nTo guide the helm of Britain’s power\r\nAnd midst thy country’s laurelled crown\r\nTo twine a garland all thy own_.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet he had done something. He had played the man when some others had\r\nnot played the man.\r\n\r\nBut now that the crisis was over, and he had made his last round, now\r\nthat he had inspected for the last time the patrols over whom he was\r\nset, seen order restored on the Welsh Back, and panic driven from\r\nQueen’s Square, he owned the reaction. There is a fatigue which one\r\nnight’s rest fails to banish; and low in mind and tired in body, he\r\nfelt, when he rose late on Tuesday afternoon, that he had done nothing\r\nworth doing; nothing that altered his position in essentials.\r\n\r\nFor a time, indeed, he had fancied that things were changed. Sir Robert\r\nhad requested his assistance, and allowed him to share his search; and\r\nthough it was possible that the merest stranger, cast by fortune into\r\nthe same adventure, had been as welcome, it was also possible that the\r\nBaronet viewed him with a more benevolent eye. And Mary—Mary, too, had\r\nflown to his arms as to a haven; but in such a position, amid\r\nsurroundings so hideous, was that wonderful? Was it not certain that\r\nshe would have behaved in the same way to the merest acquaintance if he\r\nbrought her aid and protection?\r\n\r\nThe answer might be yes or no! What was certain was that it could not\r\navail him. For between him and her there stood more than her father’s\r\naversion, more than the doubt of her affection, more than the unlucky\r\nborough, of which he had despoiled Sir Robert. There were her\r\npossessions, there was the suspicion which Sir Robert had founded on\r\nthem—on Mary’s gain and his loss—there was the independence, which he\r\nmust surrender, and which pride and principle alike forbade him to\r\nrelinquish.\r\n\r\nIn the confusion of the night Vaughan had almost forgotten and quite\r\nforgiven. Now he saw that the thing, though forgotten, though forgiven,\r\nwas there. He could not owe all to a man who had so misconstrued him,\r\nand who might misconstrue him again. He could not be dependent on one\r\nwhose views, thoughts, prejudices, were opposed to his own. No, the\r\nnight and its doing must stand apart. He and she had met, they had\r\nparted. He had one memory more, and nothing was changed.\r\n\r\nIn this mood the fact that the White Lion regarded him as a hero\r\nbrought him no comfort. Neither the worshipping eyes of the young lady\r\nwho had tried to dissuade him from going forth on the Sunday, nor the\r\nrespectful homage which dogged his movements, uplifted him. He had\r\nsmall appetite for his solitary dinner, and was languidly reading the\r\n“Bristol Mercury,” when a name was brought up to him, and a letter.\r\n\r\n“Gentleman will wait your pleasure, sir,” the man said.\r\n\r\nHe broke open the letter, and felt the blood rise to his face as his\r\neyes fell on the signature. The few lines were from his cousin, and ran\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“Dear Sir,—I feel it my duty to inform you, as a connection of the\r\nfamily, that Lady Sybil Vermuyden died at five minutes past three\r\no’clock this afternoon. Her death, which I am led to believe could in\r\nno event have been long delayed, was doubtless hastened by the\r\nmiserable occurrences of the last few days.\r\n\r\n“I have directed Isaac White to convey this intimation to your hands,\r\nand to inform you from time to time of the arrangements made for her\r\nladyship’s funeral, which will take place at Stapylton. I have the\r\nhonour to be, sir,\r\n\r\n“Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n“Robert Vermuyden.”\r\n\r\nVaughan laid the letter down with a groan. As he did so he became aware\r\nthat Isaac White was in the room. “Halloa, White,” he said. “Is that\r\nyou?”\r\n\r\nWhite looked at him with unconcealed respect. “Yes, sir,” he said. “Sir\r\nRobert bade me wait on you in person without delay. If I may venture,”\r\nhe continued, “to compliment you on my own account, sir—a very great\r\nhonour to the family, Mr. Vaughan—in all the west country, I may say——”\r\n\r\nVaughan stopped him, and said something of Lady Sybil’s death; adding\r\nthat he had never seen her but once.\r\n\r\n“Twice, begging your pardon,” White answered, smiling. “Do you remember\r\nI met you at Chippenham before the election, Mr. Vaughan? Well, sir,\r\nshe came up to the coach, and as good as touched your sleeve, poor\r\nlady, while I was talking to you. Of course, she knew that her daughter\r\nwas on the coach.”\r\n\r\n“I learned afterwards that Lady Sybil travelled by it that day,”\r\nVaughan replied. Then with a frown he took up the letter. “Of course,”\r\nhe continued, “I have no intention of attending the funeral.”\r\n\r\n“But I think his honour wishes much——”\r\n\r\n“There is no possible reason,” Vaughan said doggedly.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me, sir,” White answered anxiously. “You are not aware, I am\r\nsure, how highly Sir Robert appreciates your gallant conduct yesterday.\r\nNo one in Bristol can view it in a stronger light. It is a happy thing\r\nhe witnessed it. He thinks, indeed, that but for you her ladyship would\r\nhave died in the crowd. Moreover——”\r\n\r\n“That’s enough, White,” Vaughan said coldly. “It is not so much what\r\nSir Robert thinks now, too, as what he thought formerly.”\r\n\r\n“But indeed, sir, his honour’s opinion of that matter, too——”\r\n\r\n“That’s enough, White,” the young gentleman repeated, rising from his\r\nseat. He was telling himself that he was not a dog to be kicked away\r\nand called to heel again. He would forgive, but he would not return. “I\r\ndon’t wish to discuss the matter,” he added with an air of finality.\r\n\r\nAnd White did not venture to say more.\r\n\r\nHe did wisely. For Vaughan, left to himself, had not reflected two\r\nminutes before he felt that he had played the churl. To make amends, he\r\ncalled at the house to inquire after the ladies at an hour next morning\r\nwhen they could not be stirring. Having performed that duty, and having\r\nlearned that no inquiry into the riots would be opened for some\r\ndays—and also that a proposal to give him a piece of gold plate was\r\nunder debate at the Commercial Rooms, he fled, pride and love at odds\r\nin his breast.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that in Sir Robert’s heart, also, there was a battle\r\ngoing on. On the eve of the funeral he sat alone in the library at\r\nStapylton, that room in which he had passed so many unhappy hours, and\r\nwith which the later part of his life seemed bound up. Doubtless, as he\r\nsat, he gave solemn thought to the past and the future. The room was no\r\nlonger dusty, the furniture was no longer shabby; there were fresh\r\nflowers on his table; and by his great leather chair, a smaller chair,\r\nfilled within the last few minutes, had its place. Yet he could not\r\nforget what he had suffered there; how he had brooded there. And\r\nperhaps he thanked God, amid his more solemn thoughts, that he was not\r\nglad that she who had plagued him would plague him no more. All that\r\nher friend had urged in her behalf, all that was brightest and best in\r\nhis memories of her, this generous whim, that quixotic act rose, it may\r\nbe supposed, before him. And the picture of her fair young beauty, of\r\nher laughing face in the bridal veil or under the Leghorn, of her first\r\nwords to him, of her first acts in her new home! And but that the tears\r\nof age flow hardly, it is possible that he would have wept.\r\n\r\nPresently—perhaps he was not sorry for it—a knock came at the door and\r\nIsaac White entered. He came to take the last instructions for the\r\nmorrow. A few words settled what remained to be settled, and then,\r\nafter a little hesitation, “I promised to name it to you, sir,” White\r\nsaid. “I don’t know what you’ll say to it. Dyas wishes to walk with the\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert winced. “Dyas?” he muttered.\r\n\r\n“He says he’s anxious to show his respect for the family, in every way\r\nconsistent with his opinions.”\r\n\r\n“Opinions?” Sir Robert echoed. “Opinions? Good Lord! A butcher’s\r\nopinions! Who knows but some day he’ll have a butcher to represent him?\r\nOr a baker or a candlestick-maker! If ever they have the ballot,\r\nthat’ll come with it, White.”\r\n\r\nWhite waited, but as the other said no more, “You won’t forbid him,\r\nsir?” he said, a note of appeal in his voice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, let him come,” Sir Robert answered wearily. “I suppose,” he\r\ncontinued, striving to speak in the same tone, “you’ve heard nothing\r\nfrom his—Member?”\r\n\r\n“From—oh, from Mr. Vaughan, sir? No, sir. But Mr. Flixton is coming.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert muttered something under his breath, and it was not\r\nflattering to the Honourable Bob. Then he turned his chair and held his\r\nhands over the blaze. “That will do, White,” he said. “That will do.”\r\nAnd he did not look round until the agent had left the room.\r\n\r\nBut White was certain that even on this day of sad memories, with the\r\nordeal of the morrow before him, Arthur Vaughan’s attitude troubled his\r\npatron. And when, twenty-four hours later, the agent’s eyes travelling\r\nround the vast assemblage which regard for the family had gathered\r\nabout the grave, fell upon Arthur Vaughan, and he knew that he had\r\nrepented and come, he was glad.\r\n\r\nThe young Member held himself a little apart from the small group of\r\nfamily mourners; a little apart also from the larger company whom\r\nrespect or social ties had brought thither. Among these last, who were\r\nmostly Tories, many were surprised to see Lord Lansdowne and his son.\r\nBut more, aware of the breach between Mr. Vaughan and his cousin, and\r\nof the former’s peculiar position in the borough, were surprised to see\r\nhim. And these, while their thoughts should have been elsewhere, stole\r\nfurtive glances at the sombre figure; and when Vaughan left, still\r\nalone and without speaking to any, followed his departure with\r\ninterest. In those days of mutes and crape-coloured staves, mourning\r\ncloaks and trailing palls, it was not the custom for women to bury\r\ntheir dead. And Vaughan, when he had made up his mind to come, knew\r\nthat he ran no risk of seeing Mary.\r\n\r\nThat he might escape with greater case, he had left his post-chaise at\r\na side-gate of the park. The moment the ceremony was over, he made his\r\nway to it, now traversing beds of fallen chestnut and sycamore leaves,\r\nnow striding across the sodden turf. The solemn words which he had\r\nheard, emphasised as they were by the scene, the grey autumn day, the\r\nlonely park, and the dark groups threading their way across it, could\r\nnot hold his thoughts from Mary. She would be glad that he had come.\r\nPerhaps it was for that reason that he had come.\r\n\r\nHe had passed through the gate of the park and his foot was on the step\r\nof the chaise, when he heard White’s voice, calling after him. He\r\nturned and saw the agent hurrying desperately after him. White’s\r\nmourning suit was tight and new and ill made for haste; and he was hot\r\nand breathless. For a moment, “Mr. Vaughan! Mr. Vaughan!” was all he\r\ncould say.\r\n\r\nVaughan turned a reluctant, almost a stern face to him. Not that he\r\ndisliked the agent, but he thought that he had got clear.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he asked, without removing his foot from the step.\r\n\r\nWhite looked behind him. “Sir Robert, sir,” he said, “has something to\r\nsay to you. The carriage is following. If you’ll be good enough,” he\r\ncontinued, mopping his face, “to wait a moment!”\r\n\r\n“Sir Robert cannot wish to see me at such a time,” Vaughan answered,\r\nbetween wonder and impatience. “He will write, doubtless.”\r\n\r\n“The carriage should be in sight,” was White’s answer. As he spoke it\r\ncame into view; rounding the curve of a small coppice of beech trees,\r\nit rolled rapidly down a declivity, and ascended towards them as\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nA moment and it would be here. Vaughan looked uncertainly at his\r\npost-boy. He wished to catch the York House coach at Chippenham, and he\r\nhad little time to spare.\r\n\r\nIt was not the loss of time, however, that he really had in his mind.\r\nBut he could guess, he fancied, what Sir Robert wished to say; and he\r\ndid not deny that the old man was generous in saying it at such a\r\nmoment, if that were his intention. But his own mind was made up; he\r\ncould only repeat what he had said to White. It was not a question of\r\nwhat Sir Robert had thought, or now thought, but of what _he_ thought.\r\nAnd the upshot of all his thoughts was that he would not be dependent\r\nupon any man. He had differed from Sir Robert once, and the elder had\r\ntreated the younger man with injustice, and contumely; that might occur\r\nagain. Indeed, taking into account the difference in their political\r\nviews in an age when politics counted for much, it was sure to occur\r\nagain. But his mind was made up that it should not occur to him.\r\nUnhappy as the resolution made him, he would be free. He would be his\r\nown man. He would remember nothing except that that night had changed\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nIt was with a set face, therefore, that he watched the carriage draw\r\nnear. Apparently it was a carriage which had conveyed guests to the\r\nfuneral, for the blinds were drawn.\r\n\r\n“It will save time, if it takes you a mile on your way,” White said,\r\nwith some nervousness. “I will tell your chaise to follow.” And he\r\nopened the door.\r\n\r\nVaughan raised his hat, and stepped in. It was only when the door was\r\nclosing behind him and the carriage starting anew at a word from White,\r\nthat he saw that it contained, not Sir Robert Vermuyden, but a lady.\r\n\r\n“Mary!” he cried. The name broke from him in his astonishment.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with self-possession, and a gentle, unsmiling\r\ngravity. She indicated the front seat, and “Will you sit there?” she\r\nsaid. “I can talk to you better, Mr. Vaughan, if you sit there.”\r\n\r\nHe obeyed her, marvelling. The blind on the side on which she sat was\r\nraised a few inches, and in the subdued light her graceful head showed\r\nlike some fair flower rising from the depth of her mourning. For she\r\nwore no covering on her head, and he might have guessed, had he had any\r\ncommand of his thoughts, that she had sprung as she was into the\r\nnearest carriage. Amazement, however, put him beyond thinking.\r\n\r\nHer eyes met his seriously. “Mr. Vaughan,” she said, “my presence must\r\nseem extraordinary to you. But I am come to ask you a question. Why did\r\nyou tell me six months ago that you loved me if you did not?”\r\n\r\nHe was as deeply agitated as she was quiet on the surface. “I told you\r\nnothing but the truth,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said.\r\n\r\n“But yes! A hundred times, yes!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Then you are altered? That is it?”\r\n\r\n“Never!” he cried. “Never!”\r\n\r\n“And yet—things are changed? My father wrote to you, did he not, three\r\ndays ago? And said as much as you could look to him to say?”\r\n\r\n“He said——”\r\n\r\n“He withdrew what he had uttered in an unfortunate moment. He withdrew\r\nthat which, I think, he had never believed in his heart. He said as\r\nmuch as you could expect him to say?” she repeated, her colour mounting\r\na little, her eyes challenging him with courageous firmness.\r\n\r\n“He said,” Vaughan answered in a low voice, “what I think it became him\r\nto say.”\r\n\r\n“You understood that his feelings were changed towards you?”\r\n\r\n“To some extent.”\r\n\r\nShe drew a deep breath and sat back. “Then it is for you to speak,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBut before, agitated as he was, he could speak, she leant forward\r\nagain. “No,” she said, “I had forgotten. I had forgotten.” And the\r\nslight quivering of her lips, a something piteous in her eyes, reminded\r\nhim once more, once again—and the likeness tugged at his heart—of the\r\nMary Smith who had paused on the threshold of the inn at Maidenhead,\r\nalarmed and abashed by the bustle of the coffee-room. “I had forgotten!\r\nIt is not my father you cannot forgive—it is I, who am unworthy of your\r\nforgiveness? You cannot make allowance,” she continued, stopping him by\r\na gesture, as he opened his mouth to speak, “for the weakness of one\r\nwho had always been dependent, who had lived all her life under the\r\ndominion of others, who had been taught by experience that, if she\r\nwould eat, she must first obey. You can make no allowance, Mr. Vaughan,\r\nfor such an one placed between a father, whom it was her duty to\r\nhonour, and a lover to whom she had indeed given her heart, she knew\r\nnot why—but whom she barely knew, with whose life she had no real\r\nacquaintance, whose honesty she must take on trust, because she loved\r\nhim? You cannot forgive her because, taught all her life to bend, she\r\ncould not, she did not stand upright under the first trial of her\r\nfaith?”\r\n\r\n“No!” he cried violently. “No! No! It is not that!”\r\n\r\n“No?” she said. “You do forgive her then? You have forgiven her? The\r\nmore as to-day she is not weak. The earth is not level over my mother’s\r\ngrave, some may say hard things of me—but I have come to you to-day.”\r\n\r\n“God bless you!” he cried.\r\n\r\nShe drew a deep breath and sat back. “Then,” she said, with a sigh as\r\nof relief, “it is for you to speak.”\r\n\r\nThere was a gravity in her tone, and so complete an absence of all\r\nself-consciousness, all littleness, that he owned that he had never\r\nknown her as she was, had never measured her true worth, had never\r\nloved her as she deserved to be loved. Yet—perhaps because it was all\r\nthat was left to him—he clung desperately to the resolution he had\r\nformed, to the position which pride and prudence alike had bidden him\r\nto take up.\r\n\r\n“What am I to say?” he asked hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“Why, if you love me, if you forgive me,” she answered softly, “do you\r\nleave me?”\r\n\r\n“Can you not understand?”\r\n\r\n“In part, I can. But not altogether. Will you explain? I—I think,” she\r\ncontinued with a movement of her flower-like head, that for gentle\r\ndignity he had never seen excelled, “I have a right to an explanation.”\r\n\r\n“You know of what Sir Robert accused me?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Am I to justify him? You know what was the difference which came\r\nbetween us, which first divided us? And what I thought right then, I\r\nstill think right. Am I to abandon it? You know what I bore. Am I to\r\nlive on the bounty of one who once thought so ill of me, and may think\r\nas ill again? Of one who, differing from me, punished me so cruelly? Am\r\nI to sink into dependence, to sacrifice my judgment, to surrender my\r\npolitical liberty into the hands of one who——”\r\n\r\n“Of my father!” she said gravely.\r\n\r\nHe could not, so reminded, say what he had been going to say, but he\r\nassented by a movement of the head. And after an interval of silence,\r\n“I cannot,” he cried passionately, “I cannot, even to secure my\r\nhappiness, run that risk!”\r\n\r\nShe looked from the window of the carriage, and in a voice which shook\r\na little, “No,” she said, “I suppose not.”\r\n\r\nHe was silent and he suffered. He dared not meet her eyes. Why had she\r\nsought this interview? Why had she chosen to torment him? Ah, if she\r\nknew, if she only knew what pain she was inflicting upon him!\r\n\r\nBut apparently she did not know. For by and by she spoke again. “No,”\r\nshe said. “I suppose not. Yet have you thought”—and now there was a\r\nmore decided tremor in her voice—“that that which you surrender is not\r\nall there is at stake? Your independence is precious to you, and you\r\nhave a right, Mr. Vaughan, to purchase it even at the cost of your\r\nhappiness. But have you a right to purchase it at the cost of\r\nanother’s? At the cost of mine? Have you thought of my happiness?” she\r\ncontinued, “or only of yours—and of yourself? To save your\r\nindependence—shall I say, to save your pride?—you are willing to set\r\nyour love aside. But have you asked me whether I am willing to pay my\r\nhalf of the price? My heavier half? Whether I am willing to set my\r\nhappiness aside? Have you thought of—me at all?”\r\n\r\nIf he had not, then, when he saw how she looked at him, with what eyes,\r\nwith what love, as she laid her hand on his arm, he had been more than\r\nman if he had resisted her long! But he still fought with himself, and\r\nwith her; staring with hard, flushed face straight before him, telling\r\nhimself that by all that was left to him he must hold.\r\n\r\n“I think, I think,” she said gently, yet with dignity, “you have not\r\nthought of me.”\r\n\r\n“But your father—Sir Robert——”\r\n\r\n“He is an ogre, of course,” she cried in a tone suddenly changed. “But\r\nyou should have thought of that before, sir,” she continued, tears and\r\nlaughter in her voice. “Before you travelled with me on the coach!\r\nBefore you saved my life! Before you—looked at me! For you can never\r\ntake it back. You can never give me myself again. I think that you must\r\ntake me!”\r\n\r\nAnd then he did not resist her any longer. And the carriage was stayed;\r\nand orders were given. And, empty and hugely overpaid, the yellow\r\npost-chaise ambled on to Chippenham; and bearing two inside, and a\r\nvalise on the roof, the mourning coach drove slowly and solemnly back\r\nto Stapylton. As it wound its way over the green undulations of the\r\npark, the rabbits that ran, and then stopped, cocking their scuts, to\r\nlook at it, saw nothing strange in it. Nor the fallow-deer of the true\r\nSavernake breed, who, before they fled through the dying bracken, eyed\r\nit with poised heads. Nay, the heron which watched its approach from\r\nthe edge of the Garden Pool, and did not even deign to drop a second\r\nleg, saw nothing strange in it. Yet it bore for all that the strangest\r\nof all earthly passengers, and the strongest, and the bravest, and the\r\nfairest—and withal, thank God, the most familiar. For it carried Love.\r\nAnd love the same yet different, love gaunt and grey-haired, yet kind\r\nand warm of heart, met it at the door and gave it welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII\r\nTHREADS AND PATCHES\r\n\r\n\r\nThough England had not known for fifty years an outbreak so formidable\r\nor so destructive as that of which the news was laid on men’s\r\nbreakfast-tables on the Tuesday morning, it had less effect on the\r\npolitical situation than might have been expected. It sent, indeed, a\r\nthrill of horror through the nation. And had it occurred at an earlier\r\nstage of the Reform struggle, before the middle class had fully\r\ncommitted itself to a trial of strength with the aristocracy, it must\r\nhave detached many more of the timid and conservative of the Reformers.\r\nBut it came too late. The die was cast; men’s minds were made up on the\r\none side and the other. Each saw events coloured to his wish. And\r\nthough Wetherell and Croker, and the devoted band who still fought\r\nmanfully round those chieftains, called heaven and earth to witness the\r\nfirst-fruits of the tree of Reform, the majority of the nation\r\npreferred to see in these troubles the alternative to the Bill—the\r\nabyss into which the whole country would be hurled if that heaven-sent\r\nmeasure were not passed.\r\n\r\nOn one thing, however, all were agreed. The outrage was too great to be\r\noverlooked. The law must be vindicated, the lawbreakers must be\r\npunished. To this end the Government, anxious to clear themselves of\r\nthe suspicion of collusion, appointed a special Commission, and sent it\r\nto Bristol to try the rioters; and four poor wretches were hanged, a\r\ndozen were transported, and many received minor sentences. Having thus,\r\na little late in the day, taught the ignorant that Reform did not spell\r\nRevolution after the French pattern, the Cabinet turned their minds to\r\nthe measure again. And in December they brought in the Third Reform\r\nBill, with the fortunes and passage of which this story is not at pains\r\nto deal.\r\n\r\nBut of necessity the misguided creatures who kindled the fires in\r\nQueen’s Square on that fatal Sunday, and swore that they would not\r\nleave a gaol standing in England, were not the only men who suffered.\r\nSad as their plight was, there was one whose plight—if pain be measured\r\nby the capacity to feel—was sadder. While they were being tried in one\r\npart of Bristol, there was proceeding in another part an inquiry\r\ncharged with deeper tragedy. Not those only who had done the deed, but\r\nthose who had suffered them to do it, must answer for it. And the\r\nfingers of all pointed to one man. The magistrates might escape—the\r\nMayor indeed had done his duty creditably, if to little purpose; for\r\nwar was not their trade, and the thing at its crisis had become an\r\naffair of war. But Colonel Brereton could not shield himself behind\r\nthat plea: so many had behaved poorly that the need to bring one to\r\nbook was the greater.\r\n\r\nHe was tried by court-martial, and among the witnesses was Arthur\r\nVaughan. By reason of his position, as well as of the creditable part\r\nhe had played, the Member for Chippinge was heard by the Court with\r\nmore than common attention; and he moved all who listened to him by his\r\npainful anxiety to set the accused’s conduct in the best light; to show\r\nthat what was possible by daylight on the Monday morning might not have\r\nbeen possible on the Sunday night, and that the choice from first to\r\nlast was between two risks. No question of Colonel Brereton’s\r\ncourage—for he had served abroad with credit, nay, with honour—entered\r\ninto the inquiry; and it was proved that a soldier’s duty in such a\r\ncase was not well defined. But afterwards Vaughan much regretted that\r\nhe had not laid before the Court the opinion he had formed at the\r\ntime—that during the crisis of the riots Brereton, obsessed by one\r\nidea, was not responsible for his actions. For, sad to say, on the\r\nfifth day of the inquiry, sinking under a weight of mental agony which\r\na man of his reserved and melancholy temper was unable to support, the\r\nunfortunate officer put an end to his life. Few have paid so dearly for\r\nan error of judgment and the lack of that coarser fibre which has\r\nenabled many an inferior man to do his duty. The page darkens with his\r\nfate, too tragical for such a theme as this. And if by chance these\r\nwords reach the eye of any of his descendants, theirs be the homage due\r\nto the memory of a signal misfortune and an honourable but hapless man.\r\n\r\nOf another and greater personage whose life touched Arthur Vaughan’s\r\nonce and twice, and of whom, with all his faults, it was never said by\r\nhis worst enemy that he feared responsibility or shunned the post of\r\ndanger, a brief word must suffice. If Lord Brougham did not live to see\r\nthat complete downfall of the great Whig houses which he had predicted,\r\nhe lived to see their power ruinously curtailed. He lived to see their\r\ninfluence totter under the blow which the Repeal of the Corn Laws dealt\r\nthe landed interest, he lived to see the Reform Bill of 1867, he lived\r\nalmost to see the _coup de grâce_ given to their leadership by the\r\nBallot Act. And in another point his prophecy came true. As it had been\r\nwith Burke and Sheridan and Tierney, it was with him. His faults were\r\ngreat, as his merits were transcendent; and presently in the time of\r\nhis need his highborn associates remembered only the former. They took\r\nadvantage of them to push him from power; and he spent nearly forty\r\nyears, the remnant of his long life, in the cold shade of Opposition.\r\nThe most brilliant, the most versatile, and the most remarkable figure\r\nof the early days of the century, whose trumpet voice once roused\r\nEngland as it has never been roused from that day to this, and whose\r\nservices to education and progress are acknowledged but slightly even\r\nnow, paid for the phenomenal splendour of his youth by long years spent\r\nin a changed and changing world, jostled by a generation forgetful or\r\nheedless of his fame. To us he is but the name of a carriage;\r\nremembered otherwise, if at all, for his part in Queen Caroline’s\r\ntrial. While Wetherell, that stout fighter, Tory of the Tories, witty,\r\nslovenly, honest man, whose fame was once in all mouths, whose\r\ncaricature was once in all portfolios, and whose breeches made the\r\nfortune of many a charade, is but the shadow of a name.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe year had waned and waxed, and it was June again. At Stapylton the\r\noaks were coming to their full green; the bracken was lifting its\r\nmillion heads above the sod, and by the edge of the Garden Pool the\r\nwater voles sat on the leaves of the lilies and clean their fur. Arthur\r\nVaughan—strolling up and down with his father-in-law, not without an\r\noccasional glance at Mary, recumbent on a seat on the lawn—looked\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\n“I fancy,” he said presently, “that we shall learn the fate of the Bill\r\nto-day.”\r\n\r\n“Very like, very like,” Sir Robert answered, in an offhand fashion, as\r\nif the subject were not to his taste. And he turned about and by the\r\naid of his stick expounded his plan for enlarging the flower garden.\r\n\r\nBut Vaughan returned to the subject. “If not to-day, to-morrow,” he\r\nsaid. “And that being so, I’ve wanted for some time, sir, to ask you\r\nwhat you wish me to do.”\r\n\r\n“To do?”\r\n\r\n“As to the seat at Chippinge.”\r\n\r\nSir Robert’s face expressed his annoyance. “I told you—I told you long\r\nago,” he replied, “that I should never interfere with your political\r\nmovements.”\r\n\r\n“And you have kept your word, sir. But as Lord Lansdowne cedes the seat\r\nto you for this time, I assume——”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know why you assume anything!” Sir Robert retorted irritably.\r\n\r\n“I assume only that you will wish me to seek another seat.”\r\n\r\n“I certainly don’t wish you to lead an idle life,” Sir Robert answered.\r\n“When the younger men of our class do that, when they cease to take an\r\ninterest in political life, on the one side or the other, our power\r\nwill, indeed, be ended. Nothing is more certain than that. But for\r\nChippinge, I don’t choose that a stranger should hold a seat close to\r\nmy own door. You might have known that! For the party, I have taken\r\nsteps to furnish Mr. Cooke, a man whose opinions I thoroughly approve,\r\nwith a seat elsewhere; and I have therefore done my duty in that\r\ndirection. For the rest, the mischief is done. I suppose,” he continued\r\nin his driest tones, “you won’t want to bring in another Reform Bill\r\nimmediately?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” Vaughan answered gratefully. “Nor do I think that we are so\r\nfar apart as you assume. The truth is, Sir Robert, that we all fear one\r\nof two things, and according as we fear the one or the other we are\r\ndubbed Whigs or Tories.”\r\n\r\n“What are your two things?”\r\n\r\n“Despotism, or anarchy,” Vaughan replied modestly.\r\n\r\nSir Robert sniffed. “You don’t refine enough,” he said, pleased with\r\nhis triumph. “We all fear despotism; you, the despotism of the one: I,\r\na worse, a more cruel, a more hopeless despotism, the despotism of the\r\nmany! That’s the real difference between us.”\r\n\r\nVaughan looked thoughtful. “Perhaps you are right,” he said. “But—what\r\nis that, sir?” He raised his hand. The deep note of a distant gun\r\nrolled up the valley from the town.\r\n\r\n“The Lords have passed the Bill,” Sir Robert replied. “They are\r\ncelebrating the news in Chippinge. Well, I am not sorry that my day is\r\ndone. I give you the command. See only, my boy,” he continued, with a\r\nloving glance at Mary, who had risen, and, joined by Miss Sibson, was\r\ncoming to the end of the bridge to meet them, “see only that you hand\r\nit on to others—I do not say as I give it to you, but as little\r\nimpaired as may be.”\r\n\r\nAnd again, as Mary called to them to know what it was, the sound of the\r\ngun rolled up the valley—the knell of the system, good or bad, under\r\nwhich England had been ruled so long. The battle of which Brougham had\r\nfired the first shot in the Castle Yard at York was past and won.\r\n\r\n_Boom!_\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
