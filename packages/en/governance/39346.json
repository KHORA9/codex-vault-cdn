The narrative, to be complete,\r\nmust give some account of both cause and consequence, and to do this\r\nbriefly and with a proper regard to historical proportion is no easy\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is not pleasant to disturb the ashes of a great\r\nconflagration, which, although they have grown cold on the surface,\r\ncover embers still capable of emitting both smoke and heat; and\r\nespecially is it not pleasant when the disturber of the ashes was\r\nhimself an actor in the scenes which he is asked to describe.\r\n\r\nBut more than twenty-five years have passed, and with them have passed\r\naway most of the generation then living; and, as one of the rapidly\r\ndiminishing survivors, I am admonished by the lengthening shadows that\r\nanything I may have to say should be said speedily. The nation has\r\nlearned many lessons of wisdom from its civil war, and not the least\r\namong them is that every truthful contribution to its annals or to its\r\nteachings is not without some value.\r\n\r\nI have accordingly undertaken the task, but not without reluctance,\r\nbecause it necessarily revives recollections of the most trying and\r\npainful experiences of my life--experiences which for a long time I\r\nhave not unwillingly permitted to fade in the dim distance.\r\n\r\nThere was another 19th of April--that of Lexington in 1775--which has\r\nbecome memorable in history for a battle between the Minute Men of\r\nMassachusetts and a column of British troops, in which the first blood\r\nwas shed in the war of the Revolution. It was the heroic beginning of\r\nthat contest.\r\n\r\nThe fight which occurred in the streets of Baltimore on the 19th of\r\nApril, 1861, between the 6th Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers and\r\na mob of citizens, was also memorable, because then was shed the first\r\nblood in a conflict between the North and the South; then a step was\r\ntaken which made compromise or retreat almost impossible; then\r\npassions on both sides were aroused which could not be controlled.[1]\r\nIn each case the outbreak was an explosion of conflicting forces long\r\nsuppressed, but certain, sooner or later, to occur. Here the\r\ncoincidence ends. The Minute Men of Massachusetts were so called\r\nbecause they were prepared to rise on a minute's notice. They had\r\nanticipated and had prepared for the strife. The attack by the mob in\r\nBaltimore was a sudden uprising of popular fury. The events themselves\r\nwere magnified as the tidings flashed over the whole country, and the\r\nconsequences were immediate. The North became wild with astonishment\r\nand rage, and the South rose to fever-heat from the conviction that\r\nMaryland was about to fall into line as the advance guard of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At Fort Sumter, it is true, one week earlier, the first\r\ncollision of arms had taken place; but strangely, that bombardment was\r\nunattended with loss of life. And it did not necessarily mean war\r\nbetween North and South: accommodation still seemed possible.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn February, 1861, when Mr. Lincoln was on his way to Washington to\r\nprepare for his inauguration as President of the United States, an\r\nunfortunate incident occurred which had a sinister influence on the\r\nState of Maryland, and especially on the city of Baltimore. Some\r\nsuperserviceable persons, carried away, honestly no doubt, by their\r\nown frightened imaginations, and perhaps in part stimulated by the\r\ntemptation of getting up a sensation of the first class, succeeded in\r\npersuading Mr. Lincoln that a formidable conspiracy existed to\r\nassassinate him on his way through Maryland.\r\n\r\nIt was announced publicly that he was to come from Philadelphia, not\r\nby the usual route through Wilmington, but by a circuitous journey\r\nthrough Harrisburg, and thence by the Northern Central Railroad to\r\nBaltimore. Misled by this statement, I, as Mayor of the city,\r\naccompanied by the Police Commissioners and supported by a strong\r\nforce of police, was at the Calvert-street station on Saturday\r\nmorning, February 23d, at half-past eleven o'clock, the appointed time\r\nof arrival, ready to receive with due respect the incoming President.\r\nAn open carriage was in waiting, in which I was to have the honor of\r\nescorting Mr. Lincoln through the city to the Washington station, and\r\nof sharing in any danger which he might encounter. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to say that I apprehended none. When the train came it\r\nappeared, to my great astonishment, that Mrs. Lincoln and her three\r\nsons had arrived safely and without hindrance or molestation of any\r\nkind, but that Mr. Lincoln could not be found. It was then announced\r\nthat he had passed through the city _incognito_ in the night train by\r\nthe Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, and had reached\r\nWashington in safety at the usual hour in the morning. For this signal\r\ndeliverance from an imaginary peril, those who devised the ingenious\r\nplan of escape were of course devoutly thankful, and they accordingly\r\ntook to themselves no little amount of credit for its success.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Lincoln had arrived in Baltimore at the time expected, and had\r\nspoken a few words to the people who had gathered to hear him,\r\nexpressing the kind feelings which were in his heart with the simple\r\neloquence of which he was so great a master, he could not have failed\r\nto make a very different impression from that which was produced not\r\nonly by the want of confidence and respect manifested towards the city\r\nof Baltimore by the plan pursued, but still more by the manner in\r\nwhich it was carried out. On such an occasion as this even trifles are\r\nof importance, and this incident was not a trifle. The emotional part\r\nof human nature is its strongest side and soonest leads to action. It\r\nwas so with the people of Baltimore. Fearful accounts of the\r\nconspiracy flew all over the country, creating a hostile feeling\r\nagainst the city, from which it soon afterwards suffered. A single\r\nspecimen of the news thus spread will suffice. A dispatch from\r\nHarrisburg, Pennsylvania, to the New York _Times_, dated February\r\n23d, 8 A. M., says: \"Abraham Lincoln, the President-elect of the\r\nUnited States, is safe in the capital of the nation.\" Then, after\r\ndescribing the dreadful nature of the conspiracy, it adds: \"The list\r\nof the names of the conspirators presented a most astonishing array of\r\npersons high in Southern confidence, and some whose fame is not\r\nconfined to this country alone.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the list of names was never furnished, and all the men in\r\nbuckram vanished in air. This is all the notice which this matter\r\nwould require except for the extraordinary narrative contributed by\r\nMr. Samuel M. Felton, at that time President of the Philadelphia,\r\nWilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, to the volume entitled \"A\r\nHistory of Massachusetts in the Civil War,\" published in 1868.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1861, Mr. Felton had made, as he supposed, a remarkable\r\ndiscovery of \"a deep-laid conspiracy to capture Washington and break\r\nup the Government.\"\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards Miss Dix, the philanthropist, opportunely came to his\r\noffice on a Saturday afternoon, stating that she had an important\r\ncommunication to make to him personally, and then, with closed doors\r\nand for more than an hour, she poured into his ears a thrilling tale,\r\nto which he attentively listened. \"The sum of all was (I quote the\r\nlanguage of Mr. Felton) that there was then an extensive and organized\r\nconspiracy throughout the South to seize upon Washington, with its\r\narchives and records, and then declare the Southern conspirators _de\r\nfacto_ the Government of the United States. The whole was to be a\r\n_coup d'etat_. At the same time they were to cut off all modes of\r\ncommunication between Washington and the North, East or West, and thus\r\nprevent the transportation of troops to wrest the capital from the\r\nhands of the insurgents. Mr. Lincoln's inauguration was thus to be\r\nprevented, or his life was to fall a sacrifice to the attempt at\r\ninauguration. In fact, troops were then drilling on the line of our\r\nown road, and the Washington and Annapolis line and other lines.\"\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the knowledge of a treasonable conspiracy of such\r\nvast proportions, which had already begun its operations, ought not to\r\nbe confined solely to the keeping of Mr. Felton and Miss Dix. Mr. N.\r\nP. Trist, an officer of the road, was accordingly admitted into the\r\nsecret, and was dispatched in haste to Washington, to lay all the\r\nfacts before General Scott, the Commander-in-Chief. The General,\r\nhowever, would give no assurances except that he would do all he could\r\nto bring sufficient troops to Washington to make it secure. Matters\r\nstood in this unsatisfactory condition for some time, until a new\r\nrumor reached the ears of Mr. Felton.\r\n\r\nA gentleman from Baltimore, he says, came out to Back River Bridge,\r\nabout five miles east of the city, and told the bridgekeeper that he\r\nhad information which had come to his knowledge, of vital importance\r\nto the road, which he wished communicated to Mr. Felton. The nature of\r\nthis communication was that a party was then organized in Baltimore to\r\nburn the bridges in case Mr. Lincoln came over the road, or in case an\r\nattempt was made to carry troops for the defense of Washington. The\r\nparty at that time had combustible materials prepared to pour over the\r\nbridges, and were to disguise themselves as negroes and be at the\r\nbridge just before the train in which Mr. Lincoln travelled had\r\narrived. The bridge was then to be burned, the train attacked, and Mr.\r\nLincoln to be put out of the way. The man appeared several times,\r\nalways, it seems, to the bridgekeeper, and he always communicated new\r\ninformation about the conspirators, but he would never give his name\r\nnor place of abode, and both still remain a mystery. Mr. Felton\r\nhimself then went to Washington, where he succeeded in obtaining from\r\na prominent gentleman from Baltimore whom he there saw, the judicious\r\nadvice to apply to Marshal Kane, the Chief of Police in Baltimore,\r\nwith the assurance that he was a perfectly reliable person. Marshal\r\nKane was accordingly seen, but he scouted the idea that there was any\r\nsuch thing on foot as a conspiracy to burn the bridges and cut off\r\nWashington, and said he had thoroughly investigated the whole matter,\r\nand there was not the slightest foundation for such rumors. Mr. Felton\r\nwas not satisfied, but he would have nothing more to do with Marshal\r\nKane. He next sent for a celebrated detective in the West, whose name\r\nis not given, and through this chief and his subordinates every nook\r\nand corner of the road and its vicinity was explored. They reported\r\nthat they had joined the societies of the conspirators in Baltimore\r\nand got into their secrets, and that the secret working of secession\r\nand treason was laid bare, with all its midnight plottings and daily\r\nconsultations. The conspiracy being thus proved to Mr. Felton's\r\nsatisfaction, he at once organized and armed a force of two hundred\r\nmen and scattered them along the line of the railroad between the\r\nSusquehanna and Baltimore, principally at the bridges. But, strange to\r\nsay, all that was accomplished by this formidable body was an enormous\r\njob of whitewashing.\r\n\r\nThe narrative proceeds: \"These men were drilled secretly and regularly\r\nby drill-masters, and were apparently employed in whitewashing the\r\nbridges, patting on some six or seven coats of whitewash saturated\r\nwith salt and alum, to make the outside of the bridges as nearly\r\nfireproof as possible. This whitewashing, so extensive in its\r\napplication, became (continues Mr. Felton) the nine days' wonder of\r\nthe neighborhood.\" And well it might. After the lapse of twenty-five\r\nyears the wonder over this feat of strategy can hardly yet have ceased\r\nin that rural and peaceful neighborhood. But, unfortunately for Mr.\r\nFelton's peace of mind, the programme of Mr. Lincoln's journey was\r\nsuddenly changed. He had selected a different route. He had decided to\r\ngo to Harrisburg from Philadelphia, and thence by day to Baltimore,\r\nover another and a rival road, known as the Northern Central. Then the\r\nchief detective discovered that the attention of the conspirators was\r\nsuddenly turned to the Northern Central road. The mysterious unknown\r\ngentleman from Baltimore appeared again on the scene and confirmed\r\nthis statement. He gave warning that Mr. Lincoln was to be waylaid and\r\nhis life sacrificed on that road, on which no whitewash had been used,\r\nand where there were no armed men to protect him.\r\n\r\nMr. Felton hurried to Philadelphia, and there, in a hotel, joined his\r\nchief detective, who was registered under a feigned name. Mr. Lincoln,\r\ncheered by a dense crowd, was, at that moment, passing through the\r\nstreets of Philadelphia. A sub-detective was sent to bring Mr. Judd,\r\nMr. Lincoln's intimate friend, to the hotel to hold a consultation.\r\nMr. Judd was in the procession with Mr. Lincoln, but the emergency\r\nadmitted no delay. The eagerness of the sub-detective was so great\r\nthat he was three times arrested and carried out of the crowd by the\r\npolice before he could reach Mr. Judd. The fourth attempt succeeded,\r\nand Mr. Judd was at last brought to the hotel, where he met both Mr.\r\nFelton and the chief detective. The narrative then proceeds in the\r\nwords of Mr. Felton: \"We lost no time in making known to him (Mr.\r\nJudd) all the facts which had come to our knowledge in reference to\r\nthe conspiracy, and I most earnestly advised sleeping-car. Mr. Judd\r\nfully entered into the plan, and said he would urge Mr. Lincoln to\r\nadopt it. On his communicating with Mr. Lincoln, after the services of\r\nthe evening were over, he answered that he had engaged to go to\r\nHarrisburg and speak the next day, and that he would not break his\r\nengagement, even in the face of such peril, but that after he had\r\nfulfilled his engagement he would follow such advice as we might give\r\nhim in reference to his journey to Washington.\" Mr. Lincoln\r\naccordingly went to Harrisburg the next day and made an address. After\r\nthat the arrangements for the journey were shrouded in the profoundest\r\nmystery. It was given out that he was to go to Governor Curtin's house\r\nfor the night, but he was, instead, conducted to a point about two\r\nmiles out of Harrisburg, where an extra car and engine waited to take\r\nhim to Philadelphia. The telegraph lines east, west, north and south\r\nfrom Harrisburg were cut, so that no message as to his movements could\r\nbe sent off in any direction. But all this caused a detention, and the\r\nnight train from Philadelphia to Baltimore had to be held back until\r\nthe arrival of Mr. Lincoln at the former place. If, however, the delay\r\nproved to be considerable, when Mr. Lincoln reached Baltimore the\r\nconnecting train to Washington might leave without him. But Mr. Felton\r\nwas equal to the occasion. He devised a plan which was communicated to\r\nonly three or four on the road. A messenger was sent to Baltimore by\r\nan earlier train to say to the officials of the Washington road that a\r\nvery important package must be delivered in Washington early in the\r\nmorning, and to request them to wait for the night train from\r\nPhiladelphia. To give color to this statement, a package of old\r\nrailroad reports, done up with great care, and with a large seal\r\nattached, marked by Mr. Felton's own hand, \"Very Important,\" was sent\r\nin the train which carried Mr. Lincoln on his famous night ride from\r\nPhiladelphia through Maryland and Baltimore to the city of\r\nWashington. The only remarkable incident of the journey was the\r\nmysterious behavior of the few officials who were entrusted with the\r\nportentous secret.\r\n\r\nI do not know how others may be affected by this narrative, but I\r\nconfess even now to a feeling of indignation that Mr. Lincoln, who was\r\nno coward, but proved himself on many an occasion to be a brave man,\r\nwas thus prevented from carrying out his original intention of\r\njourneying to Baltimore in the light of day, in company with his wife\r\nand children, relying as he always did on the honor and manhood of the\r\nAmerican people. It is true we have, to our sorrow, learned by the\r\nmanner of his death, as well as by the fate of still another\r\nPresident, that no one occupying so high a place can be absolutely\r\nsafe, even in this country, from the danger of assassination, but it\r\nis still true that as a rule the best way to meet such danger is\r\nboldly to defy it.\r\n\r\nMr. C. C. Felton, son of Mr. Samuel M. Felton, in an article entitled\r\n\"The Baltimore Plot,\" published in December, 1885, in the _Harvard\r\nMonthly_, has attempted to revive this absurd story. He repeats the\r\naccount of whitewashing the bridges, and of the astonishment created\r\namong the good people of the neighborhood. He has faith in \"the\r\nunknown Baltimorean\" who visited the bridgekeeper, but would never\r\ngive his name, and in the spies employed, who, he tells us, were \"the\r\nwell-known detective Pinkerton and eight assistants,\" and he leaves\r\nhis readers to infer that Mr. Lincoln's life was saved by the\r\nextraordinary vigilance which had been exercised and the ingenious\r\nplan which had been devised by his worthy father, but alas!--\r\n\r\n  \"The earth hath bubbles as the water has,\"\r\n\r\nand this was of them.\r\n\r\nColonel Lamon, a close friend of President Lincoln, and the only\r\nperson who accompanied him on his night ride to Washington, has\r\nwritten his biography, a very careful and conscientious work, which\r\nunfortunately was left unfinished, and he of course had the strongest\r\nreasons for carefully examining the subject. After a full examination\r\nof all the documents, Colonel Lamon pronounces the conspiracy to be a\r\nmere fiction, and adds in confirmation the mature opinion of Mr.\r\nLincoln himself.\r\n\r\nColonel Lamon says:[2] \"Mr. Lincoln soon learned to regret the\r\nmidnight ride. His friends reproached him, his enemies taunted him. He\r\nwas convinced that he had committed a grave mistake in yielding to the\r\nsolicitations of a professional spy and of friends too easily alarmed.\r\nHe saw that he had fled from a danger purely imaginary, and felt the\r\nshame and mortification natural to a brave man under such\r\ncircumstances. But he was not disposed to take all the responsibility\r\nto himself, and frequently upbraided the writer for having aided and\r\nassisted him to demean himself at the very moment in all his life when\r\nhis behavior should have exhibited the utmost dignity and composure.\"\r\n\r\nAs Colonel Lamon's biography, a work of absorbing interest, is now out\r\nof print, and as his account of the ride and of the results of the\r\ninvestigation of the conspiracy is too long to be inserted here, it is\r\nadded in an Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe account above given has its appropriateness here, for the midnight\r\nride through Baltimore, and the charge that its citizens were plotting\r\nthe President's assassination, helped to feed the flame of excitement\r\nwhich, in the stirring events of that time, was already burning too\r\nhigh all over the land, and especially in a border city with divided\r\nsympathies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Life of Abraham Lincoln, p. 526; and see Appendix I.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n     THE COMPROMISES OF THE CONSTITUTION IN REGARD TO SLAVERY. -- A\r\n     DIVIDED HOUSE. -- THE BROKEN COMPACT. -- THE RIGHT OF REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a period the broad provisions of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, as expounded by the wise and broad decisions of the Supreme\r\nCourt, had proved to be equal to every emergency. The thirteen feeble\r\ncolonies had grown to be a great Republic, and no external obstacle\r\nthreatened its majestic progress; foreign wars had been waged and vast\r\nterritories had been annexed, but every strain on the Constitution\r\nonly served to make it stronger. Yet there was a canker in a vital\r\npart which nothing could heal, which from day to day became more\r\nmalignant, and which those who looked beneath the surface could\r\nperceive was surely leading, and at no distant day, to dissolution or\r\nwar, or perhaps to both. The canker was the existence of negro\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nIn colonial days, kings, lords spiritual and temporal, and commons,\r\nall united in favoring the slave trade. In Massachusetts the Puritan\r\nminister might be seen on the Sabbath going to meeting in family\r\nprocession, with his negro slave bringing up the rear. Boston was\r\nlargely engaged in building ships and manufacturing rum, and a portion\r\nof the ships and much of the rum were sent to Africa, the rum to buy\r\nslaves, and the ships to bring them to a market in America. Newport\r\nwas more largely, and until a more recent time, engaged in the same\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\nIn Maryland, even the Friends were sometimes owners of slaves; and it\r\nis charged, and apparently with reason, that Wenlock Christison, the\r\nQuaker preacher, after being driven from Massachusetts by persecution\r\nand coming to Maryland by way of Barbadoes, sent or brought in with\r\nhim a number of slaves, who cultivated his plantation until his death.\r\nIn Georgia, the Calvinist Whitefield blessed God for his negro\r\nplantation, which was generously given to him to establish his\r\n\"Bethesda\" as a refuge for orphan children.\r\n\r\nIn the Dred Scott case, Chief Justice Taney truly described the\r\nopinion, which he deplored, prevailing at the time of the adoption of\r\nthe Constitution, as being that the colored man had no rights which\r\nthe white man was bound to respect.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Judge Taney's utterance on this subject has been\r\nfrequently and grossly misrepresented. In Appendix II. will be found\r\nwhat he really did say.]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution had endeavored to settle the question of slavery by a\r\ncompromise. As the difficulty in regard to it arose far more from\r\npolitical than moral grounds, so in the settlement the former were\r\nalmost exclusively considered. It was, however, the best that could be\r\nmade at that time. It is certain that without such a compromise the\r\nConstitution would not have been adopted. The existence of slavery in\r\na State was left in the discretion of the State itself. If a slave\r\nescaped to another State, he was to be returned to his master. Laws\r\nwere passed by Congress to carry out this provision, and the Supreme\r\nCourt decided that they were constitutional.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the best people at the North stood firmly by the\r\ncompromise. It was a national compact, and must be respected. But\r\nideas, and especially moral ideas, cannot be forever fettered by a\r\ncompact, no matter how solemn may be its sanctions. The change of\r\nopinion at the North was first slow, then rapid, and then so powerful\r\nas to overwhelm all opposition. John Brown, who was executed for\r\nraising a negro insurrection in Virginia, in which men were wounded\r\nand killed, was reverenced by many at the North as a hero, a martyr\r\nand a saint. It had long been a fixed fact that no fugitive slave\r\ncould by process of law be returned from the North into slavery. With\r\nthe advent to power of the Republican party--a party based on\r\nopposition to slavery--another breach in the outworks of the\r\nConstitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, had been made.\r\nSooner or later the same hands would capture the citadel. Sooner or\r\nlater it was plain that slavery was doomed.\r\n\r\nIn the memorable Senatorial campaign in Illinois between Stephen A.\r\nDouglas and Abraham Lincoln, the latter, in his speech before the\r\nRepublican State Convention at Springfield, June 17, 1858, struck the\r\nkeynote of his party by the bold declaration on the subject of slavery\r\nwhich he then made and never recalled.\r\n\r\nThis utterance was the more remarkable because on the previous day the\r\nconvention had passed unanimously a resolution declaring that Mr.\r\nLincoln was their first and only choice for United States Senator, to\r\nfill the vacancy about to be created by the expiration of Mr.\r\nDouglas's term of office, but the convention had done nothing which\r\ncalled for the advanced ground on which Mr. Lincoln planted himself in\r\nthat speech. It was carefully prepared.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of Colonel Lamon in his biography of Lincoln is\r\nintensely interesting and dramatic.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Lamon's Life of Lincoln, p. 808.]\r\n\r\nAbout a dozen gentlemen, he says, were called to meet in the library\r\nof the State House. After seating them at the round table, Mr. Lincoln\r\nread his entire speech, dwelling slowly on that part which speaks of a\r\ndivided house, so that every man fully understood it. After he had\r\nfinished, he asked for the opinion of his friends. All but William H.\r\nHerndon, the law partner of Mr. Lincoln, declared that the whole\r\nspeech was too far in advance of the times, and they especially\r\ncondemned that part which referred to a divided house. Mr. Herndon sat\r\nstill while they were giving their respective opinions; then he sprang\r\nto his feet and said: \"Lincoln, deliver it just as it reads. If it is\r\nin advance of the times, let us--you and I, if no one else--lift the\r\npeople to the level of this speech now, higher hereafter. The speech\r\nis true, wise and politic, and will succeed now, or in the future.\r\nNay, it will aid you, if it will not make you President of the United\r\nStates.\"...\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln sat still a short moment, rose from his chair, walked\r\nbackward and forward in the hall, stopped and said: 'Friends, I have\r\nthought about this matter a great deal, have weighed the question well\r\nfrom all corners, and am thoroughly convinced the time has come when\r\nit should be uttered; and if it must be that I must go down because of\r\nthis speech, then let me go down linked to truth--die in the advocacy\r\nof what is right and just. This nation cannot live on injustice. A\r\nhouse divided against itself cannot stand, I say again and again.'\"\r\n\r\nThe opening paragraph of the speech is as follows: \"If we could first\r\nknow where we are and whither we are tending, we could then better\r\njudge what to do and how to do it. We are now far on into the fifth\r\nyear since a policy was initiated with the avowed object and confident\r\npromise of putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the operation of\r\nthat policy that agitation has not only not ceased, but is constantly\r\naugmented. In my opinion, it will not cease until a crisis shall have\r\nbeen reached and passed. A house divided against itself cannot stand.\r\nI believe this Government can not endure permanently half slave and\r\nhalf free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved. I do not expect\r\nthe house to fall; but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It\r\nwill become all one thing, or all the other. Either the opponents of\r\nslavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the\r\npublic mind shall rest in the belief that it is in the course of\r\nultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it forward till it\r\nshall become alike lawful in all the States, old as well as new, North\r\nas well as South.\"\r\n\r\nThe blast of the trumpet gave no uncertain sound. The far-seeing\r\nsuggestion of Mr. Herndon came true to the letter. I believe this\r\nspeech made Abraham Lincoln President of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut the founders of the Constitution of the United States had built a\r\nhouse which was divided against itself from the beginning. They had\r\nframed a union of States which was part free and part slave, and that\r\nunion was intended to last forever. Here was an irreconcilable\r\nconflict between the Constitution and the future President of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhen the Republican Convention assembled at Chicago in May, 1860, in\r\nthe heat of the contest, which soon became narrowed down to a choice\r\nbetween Mr. Seward and Mr. Lincoln, the latter dispatched a friend to\r\nChicago with a message in writing, which was handed either to Judge\r\nDavis or Judge Logan, both members of the convention, which runs as\r\nfollows: \"Lincoln agrees with Seward in his irrepressible-conflict\r\nidea, and in negro equality; but he is opposed to Seward's higher\r\nlaw.\" But there was no substantial difference between the position of\r\nthe two: Lincoln's \"divided house\" and Seward's \"higher law\" placed\r\nthem really in the same attitude.\r\n\r\nThe seventh resolution in the Chicago platform condemned what it\r\ndescribed as the \"new dogma that the Constitution, of its own force,\r\ncarries slavery into any or all of the Territories of the United\r\nStates.\" This resolution was a direct repudiation by a National\r\nConvention of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th of November, 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected President of\r\nthe United States. Of the actual votes cast there was a majority\r\nagainst him of 930,170. Next came Mr. Douglas, who lost the support of\r\nthe Southern Democrats by his advocacy of the doctrine of \"squatter\r\nsovereignty,\" as it was called, which was in effect, although not in\r\nform, as hostile to the decision of the Supreme Court in the Dred\r\nScott case as the seventh resolution of the Chicago Convention itself.\r\nMr. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, the candidate of the Southern\r\nDemocracy, fell very far, and Mr. Bell, of Tennessee, the candidate of\r\nthe Union party, as it was called, a short-lived successor of the old\r\nWhig party, fell still farther in the rear of the two Northern\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nThe great crisis had come at last. The Abolition party had become a\r\nportion of the victorious Republican party. The South, politically,\r\nwas overwhelmed. Separated now from its only ally, the Northern\r\nDemocracy, it stood at last alone.\r\n\r\nIt matters not that Mr. Lincoln, after his election, in sincerity of\r\nheart held out the olive branch to the nation, and that during his\r\nterm of office the South, so far as his influence could avail, would\r\nhave been comparatively safe from direct aggressions. Mr. Lincoln was\r\nnot known then as he is known now, and, moreover, his term of office\r\nwould be but four years.\r\n\r\nWhat course, then, was left to the South if it was determined to\r\nmaintain its rights under the Constitution? What but the right of\r\nself-defense?\r\n\r\nThe house of every man is his castle, and he may defend it to the\r\ndeath against all aggressors. When a hostile hand is raised to strike\r\na blow, he who is assaulted need not wait until the blow falls, but on\r\nthe instant may protect himself as best he can. These are the rights\r\nof self-defense known, approved and acted on by all freemen. And where\r\nconstitutional rights of a people are in jeopardy, a kindred right of\r\nself-defense belongs to them. Although revolutionary in its character,\r\nit is not the less a right.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips, abolitionist as he was, in a speech made at New\r\nBedford on the 9th of April, 1861, three days before the bombardment\r\nof Fort Sumter, fully recognized this right. He said: \"Here are a\r\nseries of States girding the Gulf, who think that their peculiar\r\ninstitutions require that they should have a separate government. They\r\nhave a right to decide that question without appealing to you or me. A\r\nlarge body of the people, sufficient to make a nation, have come to\r\nthe conclusion that they will have a government of a certain form. Who\r\ndenies them the right? Standing with the principles of '76 behind us,\r\nwho can deny them the right? What is a matter of a few millions of\r\ndollars or a few forts? It is a mere drop in the bucket of the great\r\nnational question. It is theirs just as much as ours. I maintain, on\r\nthe principles of '76, that Abraham Lincoln has no right to a soldier\r\nin Fort Sumter.\"\r\n\r\nAnd such was the honest belief of the people who united in\r\nestablishing the Southern Confederacy.\r\n\r\nWendell Phillips was not wrong in declaring the principles of '76 to\r\nbe kindred to those of '61. The men of '76 did not fight to get rid of\r\nthe petty tax of three pence a pound on tea, which was the only tax\r\nleft to quarrel about. They were determined to pay no taxes, large or\r\nsmall, then or thereafter. Whether the tax was lawful or not was a\r\ndoubtful question, about which there was a wide difference of opinion,\r\nbut they did not care for that. Nothing would satisfy them but the\r\nrelinquishment of any claim of right to tax the colonies, and this\r\nthey could not obtain. They maintained that their rights were\r\nviolated. They were, moreover, embittered by a long series of disputes\r\nwith the mother country, and they wanted to be independent and to have\r\na country of their own. They thought they were strong enough to\r\nmaintain that position.\r\n\r\nNeither were the Southern men of '61 fighting for money. And they too\r\nwere deeply embittered, not against a mother country, but against a\r\nbrother country. The Northern people had published invectives of the\r\nmost exasperating character broadcast against the South in their\r\nspeeches, sermons, newspapers and books. The abolitionists had\r\nproceeded from words to deeds and were unwearied in tampering with the\r\nslaves and carrying them off. The Southern people, on their part, were\r\nnot less violent in denunciation of the North. The slavery question\r\nhad divided the political parties throughout the nation, and on this\r\nquestion the South was practically a unit. They could get no security\r\nthat the provisions of the Constitution would be kept either in letter\r\nor in spirit, and this they demanded as their right.\r\n\r\nThe Southern men thought that they also were strong enough to wage\r\nsuccessfully a defensive war. Like the men of '76, they in great part\r\nwere of British stock; they lived in a thinly settled country, led\r\nsimple lives, were accustomed to the use of arms, and knew how to\r\nprotect themselves. Such men make good soldiers, and when their armies\r\nwere enrolled the ranks were filled with men of all classes, the rich\r\nas well as the poor, the educated as well as the ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that they were inveigled into secession by\r\nambitious leaders. On the contrary, it is probable that they were not\r\nas much under the influence of leaders as the men of '76, and that\r\nthere were fewer disaffected among them. At times the scales trembled\r\nin the balance. There are always mistakes in war. It is an easy and\r\nungrateful task to point them out afterward. We can now see that grave\r\nerrors, both financial and military, were made, and that opportunities\r\nwere thrown away. How far these went to settle the contest, we can\r\nnever certainly know, but it does not need great boldness to assert\r\nthat the belief which the Southern people entertained that they were\r\nstrong enough to defend themselves, was not unreasonable.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the South to maintain slavery was undoubtedly the\r\nmain cause of secession, but another deep and underlying cause was the\r\nfirm belief of the Southern people in the doctrine of States' rights,\r\nand their jealousy of any attack upon those rights. Devotion to their\r\nState first of all, a conviction that paramount obligation--in case of\r\nany conflict of allegiance--was due not to the Union but to the State,\r\nhad been part of the political creed of very many in the South ever\r\nsince the adoption of the Constitution. An ignoble love of slavery was\r\nnot the general and impelling motive. The slaveholders, who were\r\nlargely in the minority, acted as a privileged class always does act.\r\nThey were determined to maintain their privileges at all hazards. But\r\nthey, as well as the great mass of the people who had no personal\r\ninterest in slavery, fought the battles of the war with the passionate\r\nearnestness of men who believed with an undoubting conviction that\r\nthey were the defenders not only of home rule and of their firesides,\r\nbut also of their constitutional rights.\r\n\r\nAnd behind the money question, the constitutional question and the\r\nmoral question, there was still another of the gravest import. Was it\r\npossible for two races nearly equal in number, but widely different in\r\ncharacter and civilization, to live together in a republic in peace\r\nand equality of rights without mingling in blood? The answer of the\r\nSouthern man was, \"It is not possible.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n     MARYLAND'S DESIRE FOR PEACE. -- EVENTS WHICH FOLLOWED THE\r\n     ELECTION OF PRESIDENT LINCOLN. -- HIS PROCLAMATION CALLING FOR\r\n     TROOPS. -- THE CITY AUTHORITIES AND POLICE OF BALTIMORE. --\r\n     INCREASING EXCITEMENT IN BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now come to consider the condition of affairs in Maryland. As yet\r\nthe Republican party had obtained a very slight foothold. Only 2,294\r\nvotes had in the whole State been cast for Mr. Lincoln. Her sympathies\r\nwere divided between the North and the South, with a decided\r\npreponderance on the Southern side. For many years her conscience had\r\nbeen neither dead nor asleep on the subject of slavery. Families had\r\nimpoverished themselves to free their slaves. In 1860 there were\r\n83,942 free colored people in Maryland and 87,189 slaves, the white\r\npopulation being 515,918. Thus there were nearly as many free as\r\nslaves of the colored race. Emancipation, in spite of harsh laws\r\npassed to discountenance it, had rapidly gone on. In the northern part\r\nof the State and in the city of Baltimore there were but few\r\nslaveholders, and the slavery was hardly more than nominal. The\r\npatriarchal institution, as it has been derisively called, had a real\r\nexistence in many a household. Not a few excellent people have I known\r\nand respected who were born and bred in slavery and had been freed by\r\ntheir masters. In 1831 the State incorporated the Maryland\r\nColonization Society, which founded on the west coast of Africa a\r\nsuccessful republican colony of colored people, now known as the State\r\nof Maryland in Liberia, and for twenty-six years, and until the war\r\nbroke out, the State contributed $10,000 a year to its support. This\r\namount was increased by the contributions of individuals. The board,\r\nof which Mr. John H. B. Latrobe was for many years president, was\r\ncomposed of our best citizens. A code of laws for the government of\r\nthe colony was prepared by the excellent and learned lawyer, Hugh\r\nDavey Evans.\r\n\r\nWhile there was on the part of a large portion of the people a\r\ndeep-rooted and growing dislike to slavery, agitation on the subject\r\nhad not commenced. It was in fact suppressed by reason of the violence\r\nof Northern abolitionists with whom the friends of emancipation were\r\nnot able to unite.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Maryland was in no mood for war, but that\r\nher voice was for compromise and peace--compromise and peace at any\r\nprice consistent with honor.\r\n\r\nThe period immediately following the election of Mr. Lincoln in\r\nNovember, 1860, was throughout the country one of intense agitation\r\nand of important events. A large party at the North preferred\r\ncompromise to war, even at the cost of dissolution of the Union. If\r\ndissolution began, no one could tell where it would stop. South\r\nCarolina seceded on the 17th of December, 1860. Georgia and the five\r\nGulf States soon followed. On the 6th of January, 1861, Fernando Wood,\r\nmayor of the city of New York, sent a message to the common council\r\nadvising that New York should secede and become a free city.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: John P. Kennedy, of Baltimore, the well-known author, who\r\nhad been member of Congress and Secretary of the Navy, published early\r\nin 1861 a pamphlet entitled \"The Border States, Their Power and Duty\r\nin the Present Disordered Condition of the Country.\" His idea was that\r\nif concert of action could be had between the Border States and\r\nconcurring States of the South which had not seceded, stipulations\r\nmight be obtained from the Free States, with the aid of Congress, and,\r\nif necessary, an amendment of the Constitution, which would protect\r\nthe rights of the South; but if this failed, that the Border States\r\nand their allies of the South would then be forced to consider the\r\nUnion impracticable and to organize a separate confederacy of the\r\nBorder States, with the association of such of the Southern and Free\r\nStates as might be willing to accede to the proposed conditions. He\r\nhoped that the Union would thus be \"reconstructed by the healthy\r\naction of the Border States.\" The necessary result, however, would\r\nhave been that in the meantime three confederacies would have been in\r\nexistence. And yet Mr. Kennedy had always been a Union man, and when\r\nthe war broke out was its consistent advocate.\r\n\r\nThese proposals, from such different sources as Fernando Wood and John\r\nP. Kennedy, tend to show the uncertainty and bewilderment which had\r\ntaken possession of the minds of men, and in which few did not share\r\nto a greater or less degree.]\r\n\r\nOn February the 9th, Jefferson Davis was elected President of the\r\nSouthern Confederacy, a Confederacy to which other States would\r\nperhaps soon be added. But the Border States were as yet debatable\r\nground; they might be retained by conciliation and compromise or\r\nalienated by hostile measures, whether directed against them or\r\nagainst the seceded States. In Virginia a convention had been called\r\nto consider the momentous question of union or secession, and an\r\noverwhelming majority of the delegates chosen were in favor of\r\nremaining in the Union. Other States were watching Virginia's course,\r\nin order to decide whether to stay in the Union or go out of it with\r\nher.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th and 13th of April occurred the memorable bombardment and\r\nsurrender of Fort Sumter. On the 15th of April, President Lincoln\r\nissued his celebrated proclamation calling out seventy-five thousand\r\nmilitia, and appealing \"to all loyal citizens to favor, facilitate and\r\naid this effort to maintain the honor, the integrity and existence of\r\nour National Union, and the perpetuity of popular government, and to\r\nredress wrongs already long enough endured.\" What these wrongs were\r\nis not stated. \"The first service assigned to the forces hereby called\r\nforth,\" said the proclamation, \"will probably be to re-possess the\r\nforts, places and property which have been seized from the Union.\" On\r\nthe same day there was issued from the War Department a request\r\naddressed to the Governors of the different States, announcing what\r\nthe quota of each State would be, and that the troops were to serve\r\nfor three months unless sooner discharged. Maryland's quota was four\r\nregiments.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation was received with exultation at the North--many\r\ndissentient voices being silenced in the general acclaim--with\r\ndefiance at the South, and in Maryland with mingled feelings in which\r\nastonishment, dismay and disapprobation were predominant. On all sides\r\nit was agreed that the result must be war, or a dissolution of the\r\nUnion, and I may safely say that a large majority of our people then\r\npreferred the latter.\r\n\r\nAn immediate effect of the proclamation was to intensify the feeling\r\nof hostility in the wavering States, and to drive four of them into\r\nsecession. Virginia acted promptly. On April 17th her convention\r\npassed an ordinance of secession--subject to ratification by a vote of\r\nthe people--and Virginia became the head and front of the Confederacy.\r\nNorth Carolina, Tennessee and Arkansas soon followed her lead.\r\nMeanwhile, and before the formal acts of secession, the Governors of\r\nVirginia, North Carolina and Tennessee sent prompt and defiant answers\r\nto the requisition, emphatically refusing to furnish troops, as did\r\nalso the Governors of Kentucky and Missouri.\r\n\r\nThe position of Maryland was most critical. This State was especially\r\nimportant, because the capital of the nation lay within her borders,\r\nand all the roads from the North leading to it passed through her\r\nterritory. After the President's proclamation was issued, no doubt a\r\nlarge majority of her people sympathized with the South; but even had\r\nthat sentiment been far more preponderating, there was an underlying\r\nfeeling that by a sort of geographical necessity her lot was cast with\r\nthe North, that the larger and stronger half of the nation would not\r\nallow its capital to be quietly disintegrated away by her secession.\r\nDelaware and Maryland were the only Border States which did not\r\nattempt to secede. Kentucky at first took the impossible stand of an\r\narmed neutrality. When this failed, a portion of her people passed an\r\nordinance of secession, and a portion of the people of Missouri passed\r\na similar ordinance.\r\n\r\nIt is now proper to give some explanation of the condition of affairs\r\nin Baltimore, at that time a city of 215,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThomas Holliday Hicks, who had been elected by the American, or\r\nKnow-Nothing party, three years before, was the Governor of the State.\r\nThe city authorities, consisting of the mayor and city council, had\r\nbeen elected in October, 1860, a few weeks before the Presidential\r\nelection, not as representatives of any of the national parties, but\r\nas the candidates of an independent reform party, and in opposition to\r\nthe Know-Nothing party. This party, which then received its quietus,\r\nhad been in power for some years, and had maintained itself by methods\r\nwhich made its rule little better than a reign of terror.[6] No one\r\nacquainted with the history of that period can doubt that the reform\r\nwas greatly needed. A large number of the best men of the American\r\nparty united in the movement, and with their aid it became\r\ntriumphantly successful, carrying every ward in the city. The city\r\ncouncil was composed of men of unusually high character. \"Taken as a\r\nwhole\" (Scharf's \"History of Maryland,\" Vol. III., p. 284), \"a better\r\nticket has seldom, if ever, been brought out. In the selection of\r\ncandidates all party tests were discarded, and all thought of\r\nrewarding partisan services repudiated.\" Four police commissioners,\r\nappointed by the Legislature--Charles Howard, William H. Gatchell,\r\nCharles D. Hinks and John W. Davis--men of marked ability and worth,\r\nhad, with the mayor, who was _ex officio_ a member of the board, the\r\nappointment and control of the police force. Mr. S. Teackle Wallis was\r\nthe legal adviser of the board. The entire police force consisted of\r\n398 men, and had been raised to a high degree of discipline and\r\nefficiency under the command of Marshal Kane. They were armed with\r\nrevolvers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The culmination of this period of misrule was at the\r\nelection in November, 1859, when the fraud and violence were so\r\nflagrant that the Legislature of the State unseated the whole\r\nBaltimore delegation--ten members. The city being thus without\r\nrepresentation, it became necessary, when a special session of the\r\nLegislature was called in April, 1861, that a new delegation from\r\nBaltimore should be chosen. It was this same Legislature (elected in\r\n1859), which took away from the mayor of the city the control of its\r\npolice, and entrusted that force to a board of police commissioners.\r\nThis change, a most fortunate one for the city at that crisis,\r\nresulted in the immediate establishment of good order, and made\r\npossible the reform movement of the next autumn.]\r\n\r\nImmediately after the call of the President for troops, including four\r\nregiments from Maryland, a marked division among the people manifested\r\nitself. Two large and excited crowds, eager for news, and nearly\r\ntouching each other, stood from morning until late at night before two\r\nnewspaper offices on Baltimore street which advocated contrary views\r\nand opinions. Strife was in the air. It was difficult for the police\r\nto keep the peace. Business was almost suspended. Was there indeed to\r\nbe war between the sections, or could it yet, by some unlooked-for\r\ninterposition, be averted? Would the Border States interfere and\r\ndemand peace? There was a deep and pervading impression of impending\r\nevil. And now an immediate fear was as to the effect on the citizens\r\nof the passage of Northern troops through the city. Should they be\r\npermitted to cross the soil of Maryland, to make war on sister States\r\nof the South, allied to her by so many ties of affection, as well as\r\nof kindred institutions? On the other hand, when the capital of the\r\nnation was in danger, should not the kindest greeting and welcome be\r\nextended to those who were first to come to the rescue? Widely\r\ndifferent were the answers given to these questions. The Palmetto flag\r\nhad several times been raised by some audacious hands in street and\r\nharbor, but it was soon torn down. The National flag and the flag of\r\nthe State, with its black and orange, the colors of Lord Baltimore,\r\nwaved unmolested, but not side by side, for they had become symbols of\r\ndifferent ideas, although the difference was, as yet, not clearly\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of April, the state of affairs became so serious that I,\r\nas mayor, issued a proclamation earnestly invoking all good citizens\r\nto refrain from every act which could lead to outbreak or violence of\r\nany kind; to refrain from harshness of speech, and to render in all\r\ncases prompt and efficient aid, as by law they were required to do, to\r\nthe public authorities, whose constant efforts would be exerted to\r\nmaintain unbroken the peace and order of the city, and to administer\r\nthe laws with fidelity and impartiality. I cannot flatter myself that\r\nthis appeal produced much effect. The excitement was too great for any\r\nwords to allay it.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April, notice was received from Harrisburg that two\r\ncompanies of United States artillery, commanded by Major Pemberton,\r\nand also four companies of militia, would arrive by the Northern\r\nCentral Railroad at Bolton Station, in the northern part of the city,\r\nat two o'clock in the afternoon. The militia had neither arms nor\r\nuniforms.\r\n\r\nBefore the troops arrived at the station, where I was waiting to\r\nreceive them, I was suddenly called away by a message from Governor\r\nHicks stating that he desired to see me on business of urgent\r\nimportance, and this prevented my having personal knowledge of what\r\nimmediately afterward occurred. The facts, however, are that a large\r\ncrowd assembled at the station and followed the soldiers in their\r\nmarch to the Washington station with abuse and threats. The regulars\r\nwere not molested, but the wrath of the mob was directed against the\r\nmilitia, and an attack would certainly have been made but for the\r\nvigilance and determination of the police, under the command of\r\nMarshal Kane.\r\n\r\n\"These proceedings,\" says Mr. Scharf, in the third volume of his\r\n\"History of Maryland,\" page 401, \"were an earnest of what might be\r\nexpected on the arrival of other troops, the excitement growing in\r\nintensity with every hour. Numerous outbreaks occurred in the\r\nneighborhood of the newspaper offices during the day, and in the\r\nevening a meeting of the States Rights Convention was held in Taylor's\r\nbuilding, on Fayette street near Calvert, where, it is alleged, very\r\nstrong ground was taken against the passage of any more troops through\r\nBaltimore, and armed resistance to it threatened. On motion of Mr.\r\nRoss Winans, the following resolutions were unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That in the opinion of this convention the\r\n     prosecution of the design announced by the President in his late\r\n     proclamation, of recapturing the forts in the seceded States,\r\n     will inevitably lead to a sanguinary war, the dissolution of the\r\n     Union, and the irreconcilable estrangement of the people of the\r\n     South from the people of the North.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That we protest in the name of the people of\r\n     Maryland against the garrisoning of Southern forts by militia\r\n     drawn from the free States; or the quartering of militia from the\r\n     free States in any of the towns or places of the slaveholding\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That in the opinion of this convention the massing\r\n     of large bodies of militia, exclusively from the free States, in\r\n     the District of Columbia, is uncalled for by any public danger or\r\n     exigency, is a standing menace to the State of Maryland, and an\r\n     insult to her loyalty and good faith, and will, if persisted in,\r\n     alienate her people from a government which thus attempts to\r\n     overawe them by the presence of armed men and treats them with\r\n     contempt and distrust.\r\n\r\n     \"_Resolved_, That the time has arrived when it becomes all good\r\n     citizens to unite in a common effort to obliterate all party\r\n     lines which have heretofore unhappily divided us, and to present\r\n     an unbroken front in the preservation and defense of our\r\n     interests, our homes and our firesides, to avert the horrors of\r\n     civil war, and to repel, if need be, any invader who may come to\r\n     establish a military despotism over us.\r\n\r\n                                         \"A. C. ROBINSON, _Chairman_.\"\r\n     \"G. HARLAN WILLIAMS,\r\n     \"ALBERT RITCHIE,\r\n               \"_Secretaries_.\"\r\n\r\nThe names of the members who composed this convention are not given,\r\nbut the mover of the resolutions and the officers of the meeting were\r\nmen well known and respected in this community.\r\n\r\nThe bold and threatening character of the resolutions did not tend to\r\ncalm the public mind. They did not, however, advocate an attack on the\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\nIn Putnam's \"Record of the Rebellion,\" Volume I, page 29, the\r\nfollowing statement is made of a meeting which was held on the morning\r\nof the 18th of April: \"An excited secession meeting was held at\r\nBaltimore, Maryland. T. Parkin Scott occupied the chair, and speeches\r\ndenunciatory of the Administration and the North were made by Wilson\r\nC. N. Carr, William Byrne [improperly spelled Burns], President of the\r\nNational Volunteer Association, and others.\"\r\n\r\nAn account of the meeting is before me, written by Mr. Carr, lately\r\ndeceased, a gentleman entirely trustworthy. He did not know, he says,\r\nof the existence of such an association, but on his way down town\r\nhaving seen the notice of a town meeting to be held at Taylor's Hall,\r\nto take into consideration the state of affairs, he went to the\r\nmeeting. Mr. Scott was in the chair and was speaking. He was not\r\nmaking an excited speech, but, on the contrary, was urging the\r\naudience to do nothing rashly, but to be moderate and not to interfere\r\nwith any troops that might attempt to pass through the city. As soon\r\nas he had finished, Mr. Carr was urged to go up to the platform and\r\nreply to Mr. Scott. I now give Mr. Carr's words. \"I went up,\" he says,\r\n\"but had no intention of saying anything in opposition to what Mr.\r\nScott had advised the people to do. I was not there as an advocate of\r\nsecession, but was anxious to see some way opened for reconciliation\r\nbetween the North and South. I did not make an excited speech nor did\r\nI denounce the Administration. I saw that I was disappointing the\r\ncrowd. Some expressed their disapprobation pretty plainly and I cut my\r\nspeech short. As soon as I finished speaking the meeting adjourned.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the war was over, Mr. Scott was elected Chief Judge of the\r\nSupreme Bench of Baltimore City. He was a strong sympathizer with the\r\nSouth, and had the courage of his convictions, but he had been also an\r\nopponent of slavery, and I have it from his own lips that years before\r\nthe war, on a Fourth of July, he had persuaded his mother to liberate\r\nall her slaves, although she depended largely on their services for\r\nher support. And yet he lived and died a poor man.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th of April, Marshal Kane addressed a letter to William\r\nCrawford, the Baltimore agent of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and\r\nBaltimore Railroad Company, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     \"_Dear Sir_:--Is it true as stated that an attempt will be made\r\n     to pass the volunteers from New York intended to war upon the\r\n     South over your road to-day? It is important that we have\r\n     explicit understanding on the subject.\r\n\r\n     Your friend,\r\n                                                      GEORGE P. KANE.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was not submitted to me, nor to the board of police. If it\r\nhad been, it would have been couched in very different language. Mr.\r\nCrawford forwarded it to the President of the road, who, on the same\r\nday, sent it to Simon Cameron, the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nMr. Cameron, on April 18th, wrote to Governor Hicks, giving him notice\r\nthat there were unlawful combinations of citizens of Maryland to\r\nimpede the transit of United States troops across Maryland on their\r\nway to the defense of the capital, and that the President thought it\r\nhis duty to make it known to the Governor, so that all loyal and\r\npatriotic citizens might be warned in time, and that he might be\r\nprepared to take immediate and effective measures against it.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the 18th, Governor Hicks arrived in town. He had\r\nprepared a proclamation as Governor of the State, and wished me to\r\nissue another as mayor of the city, which I agreed to do. In it he\r\nsaid, among other things, that the unfortunate state of affairs now\r\nexisting in the country had greatly excited the people of Maryland;\r\nthat the emergency was great, and that the consequences of a rash step\r\nwould be fearful. He therefore counselled the people in all\r\nearnestness to withhold their hands from whatever might tend to\r\nprecipitate us into the gulf of discord and ruin gaping to receive us.\r\nAll powers vested in the Governor of the State would be strenuously\r\nexerted to preserve peace and maintain inviolate the honor and\r\nintegrity of Maryland. He assured the people that no troops would be\r\nsent from Maryland, unless it might be for the defense of the national\r\ncapital. He concluded by saying that the people of this State would\r\nin a short time have the opportunity afforded them, in a special\r\nelection for members of Congress, to express their devotion to the\r\nUnion, or their desire to see it broken up.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation is of importance in several respects. It shows the\r\ngreat excitement of the people and the imminent danger of domestic\r\nstrife. It shows, moreover, that even the Governor of the State had\r\nthen little idea of the course which he himself was soon about to\r\npursue. If this was the case with the Governor, it could not have been\r\ndifferent with thousands of the people. Very soon he became a thorough\r\nand uncompromising upholder of the war.\r\n\r\nIn my proclamation I concurred with the Governor in his determination\r\nto preserve the peace and maintain inviolate the honor and integrity\r\nof Maryland, and added that I could not withhold my expression of\r\nsatisfaction at his resolution that no troops should be sent from\r\nMaryland to the soil of any other State.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the passage of the first Northern regiments on\r\ntheir way to Washington, came the news that Virginia had seceded. Two\r\ndays were crowded with stirring news--a proclamation from the\r\nPresident of the Southern Confederacy offering to issue commissions or\r\nletters of marque to privateers, President Lincoln's proclamation\r\ndeclaring a blockade of Southern ports, the Norfolk Navy Yard\r\nabandoned, Harper's Ferry evacuated and the arsenal in the hands of\r\nVirginia troops. These events, so exciting in themselves, and coming\r\ntogether with the passage of the first troops, greatly increased the\r\ndanger of an explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n     THE SIXTH MASSACHUSETTS REGIMENT IN BALTIMORE. -- THE FIGHT. --\r\n     THE DEPARTURE FOR WASHINGTON. -- CORRESPONDENCE IN REGARD TO THE\r\n     KILLED AND WOUNDED. -- PUBLIC MEETING. -- TELEGRAM TO THE\r\n     PRESIDENT. -- NO REPLY. -- BURNING OF BRIDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sixth Massachusetts Regiment had the honor of being the first to\r\nmarch in obedience to the call of the President, completely equipped\r\nand organized. It had a full band and regimental staff. Mustered at\r\nLowell on the morning of the 16th, the day after the proclamation was\r\nissued, four companies from Lowell presented themselves, and to these\r\nwere added two from Lawrence, one from Groton, one from Acton, and one\r\nfrom Worcester; and when the regiment reached Boston, at one o'clock,\r\nan additional company was added from that city and another from\r\nStoneham, making eleven in all--about seven hundred men.[7] It was\r\naddressed by the Governor of the State in front of the State House. In\r\nthe city and along the line of the railroad, on the 17th, everywhere,\r\novations attended them. In the march down Broadway, in New York, on\r\nthe 18th, the wildest enthusiasm inspired all classes. Similar scenes\r\noccurred in the progress through New Jersey and through the city of\r\nPhiladelphia. At midnight on the 18th, reports reached Philadelphia\r\nthat the passage of the regiment through Baltimore would be disputed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Hanson's Sixth Massachusetts Regiment, p. 14.]\r\n\r\nAn unarmed and un-uniformed Pennsylvania regiment, under Colonel\r\nSmall, was added to the train, either in Philadelphia or when the\r\ntrain reached the Susquehanna--it has been stated both ways, and I am\r\nnot sure which account is correct--and the two regiments made the\r\nforce about seventeen hundred men.\r\n\r\nThe proper course for the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore\r\nRailroad Company was to have given immediate notice to the mayor or\r\nboard of police of the number of the troops, and the time when they\r\nwere expected to arrive in the city, so that preparation might have\r\nbeen made to receive them, but no such notice was given. On the\r\ncontrary, it was purposely withheld, and no information could be\r\nobtained from the office of the company, although the marshal of\r\npolice repeatedly telegraphed to Philadelphia to learn when the troops\r\nwere to be expected. No news was received until from a half hour to an\r\nhour of the time at which they were to arrive. Whatever was the reason\r\nthat no notice of the approach of the troops was given, it was not\r\nbecause they had no apprehensions of trouble. Mr. Felton, the\r\npresident of the railroad company, says that _before_ the troops left\r\nPhiladelphia he called the colonel and principal officers into his\r\noffice, and told them of the dangers they would probably encounter,\r\nand advised that each soldier should load his musket before leaving\r\nand be ready for any emergency. Colonel Jones's official report, which\r\nis dated, \"Capitol, Washington, April 22, 1861,\" says, \"_After_\r\nleaving Philadelphia, I received intimation that the passage through\r\nthe city of Baltimore would be resisted. I caused ammunition to be\r\ndistributed and arms loaded, and went personally through the cars, and\r\nissued the following order--viz.:\r\n\r\n\"'The regiment will march through Baltimore in columns of sections,\r\narms at will. You will undoubtedly be insulted, abused, and perhaps\r\nassaulted, to which you must pay no attention whatever, but march\r\nwith your faces square to the front, and pay no attention to the mob,\r\neven if they throw stones, bricks, or other missiles; but if you are\r\nfired upon, and any of you are hit, your officers will order you to\r\nfire. Do not fire into any promiscuous crowds, but select any man whom\r\nyou may see aiming at you, and be sure you drop him.'\"\r\n\r\nIf due notice had been given, and if this order had been carried out,\r\nthe danger of a serious disturbance would have been greatly\r\ndiminished. The plainest dictates of prudence required the\r\nMassachusetts and Pennsylvania regiments to march through the city in\r\na body. The Massachusetts regiment was armed with muskets, and could\r\nhave defended itself, and would also have had aid from the police; and\r\nalthough the Pennsylvania troops were unarmed, they would have been\r\nprotected by the police just as troops from the same State had been\r\nprotected on the day before. The mayor and police commissioners would\r\nhave been present, adding the sanction and authority of their official\r\npositions. But the plan adopted laid the troops open to be attacked in\r\ndetail when they were least able to defend themselves and were out of\r\nthe reach of assistance from the police. This plan was that when the\r\ntrain reached the President-street or Philadelphia station, in the\r\nsoutheastern part of Baltimore, each car should, according to custom,\r\nbe detached from the engine and be drawn through the city by four\r\nhorses for the distance of more than a mile to the Camden-street or\r\nWashington station, in the southwestern part of the city. Some one had\r\nblundered.\r\n\r\nThe train of thirty-five cars arrived at President-street Station at\r\nabout eleven o'clock. The course which the troops had to take was\r\nfirst northerly on President street, four squares to Pratt street, a\r\ncrowded thoroughfare leading along the heads of the docks, then along\r\nPratt street west for nearly a mile to Howard street, and then south,\r\non Howard street, one square to the Camden-street station.\r\n\r\nDrawn by horses across the city at a rapid pace, about nine[8] cars,\r\ncontaining seven companies of the Massachusetts Sixth, reached the\r\nCamden-street station, the first carloads being assailed only with\r\njeers and hisses; but the last car, containing Company \"K\" and Major\r\nWatson, was delayed on its passage--according to one account was\r\nthrown off the track by obstructions, and had to be replaced with the\r\nhelp of a passing team; paving-stones and other missiles were thrown,\r\nthe windows were broken, and some of the soldiers were struck. Colonel\r\nJones was in one of the cars which passed through. Near Gay street, it\r\nhappened that a number of laborers were at work repaving Pratt street,\r\nand had taken up the cobble-stones for the purpose of relaying them.\r\nAs the troops kept passing, the crowd of bystanders grew larger, the\r\nexcitement and--among many--the feeling of indignation grew more\r\nintense; each new aggressive act was the signal and example for\r\nfurther aggression. A cart coming by with a load of sand, the track\r\nwas blocked by dumping the cartload upon it--I have been told that\r\nthis was the act of some merchants and clerks of the neighborhood--and\r\nthen, as a more effectual means of obstruction, some anchors lying\r\nnear the head of the Gay-street dock were dragged up to and placed\r\nacross the track.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: According to some of the published accounts _seven_ cars\r\ngot through, which would have been one to each company, but I believe\r\nthat the number of the cars and of the companies did not correspond.\r\nProbably the larger companies were divided.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: For participation in placing this obstruction, a wealthy\r\nmerchant of long experience, usually a very peaceful man, was\r\nafterward indicted for treason by the Grand Jury of the Circuit Court\r\nof the United States in Baltimore, but his trial was not pressed.]\r\n\r\nThe next car being stopped by these obstructions, the driver attached\r\nthe horses to the rear end of the car and drove it back, with the\r\nsoldiers, to the President-street station, the rest of the cars also,\r\nof course, having to turn back, or--if any of them had not yet\r\nstarted--to remain where they were at the depot. In the cars thus\r\nstopped and turned back there were four companies, \"C,\" \"D,\" \"I\" and\r\n\"L,\" under Captains Follansbee, Hart, Pickering and Dike; also the\r\nband, which, I believe, did not leave the depot, and which remained\r\nthere with the unarmed Pennsylvania regiment. These four companies, in\r\nall about 220 men, formed on President street, in the midst of a dense\r\nand angry crowd, which threatened and pressed upon the troops,\r\nuttering cheers for Jefferson Davis and the Southern Confederacy, and\r\ngroans for Lincoln and the North, with much abusive language. As the\r\nsoldiers advanced along President street, the commotion increased; one\r\nof the band of rioters appeared bearing a Confederate flag, and it was\r\ncarried a considerable distance before it was torn from its staff by\r\ncitizens. Stones were thrown in great numbers, and at the corner of\r\nFawn street two of the soldiers were knocked down by stones and\r\nseriously injured. In crossing Pratt-street bridge, the troops had to\r\npick their way over joists and scantling, which by this time had been\r\nplaced on the bridge to obstruct their passage.\r\n\r\nColonel Jones's official report, from which I have already quoted,\r\nthus describes what happened after the four companies left the cars.\r\nAs Colonel Jones was not present during the march, but obtained the\r\nparticulars from others, it is not surprising that his account\r\ncontains errors. These will be pointed out and corrected later:\r\n\r\n\"They proceeded to march in accordance with orders, and had proceeded\r\nbut a short distance before they were furiously attacked by a shower\r\nof missiles, which came faster as they advanced. They increased their\r\nstep to double-quick, which seemed to infuriate the mob, as it\r\nevidently impressed the mob with the idea that the soldiers dared not\r\nfire or had no ammunition, and pistol-shots were numerously fired into\r\nthe ranks, and one soldier fell dead. The order \"Fire!\" was given, and\r\nit was executed; in consequence several of the mob fell, and the\r\nsoldiers again advanced hastily. The mayor of Baltimore placed himself\r\nat the head of the column beside Captain Follansbee, and proceeded\r\nwith them a short distance, assuring him that he would protect them,\r\nand begging him not to let the men fire. But the mayor's patience was\r\nsoon exhausted, and he seized a musket from the hands of one of the\r\nmen, and killed a man therewith; and a policeman, who was in advance\r\nof the column, also shot a man with a revolver. They at last reached\r\nthe cars, and they started immediately for Washington. On going\r\nthrough the train I found there were about one hundred and thirty\r\nmissing, including the band and field music. Our baggage was seized,\r\nand we have not as yet been able to recover any of it. I have found it\r\nvery difficult to get reliable information in regard to the killed and\r\nwounded, but believe there were only three killed.\r\n\r\n\"As the men went into the cars\" [meaning the men who had marched\r\nthrough the city to Camden Station], \"I caused the blinds to the cars\r\nto be closed, and took every precaution to prevent any shadow of\r\noffense to the people of Baltimore, but still the stones flew thick\r\nand fast into the train, and it was with the utmost difficulty that I\r\ncould prevent the troops from leaving the cars and revenging the death\r\nof their comrades. After a volley of stones, some one of the soldiers\r\nfired and killed a Mr. Davis, who, I ascertained by reliable\r\nwitnesses, threw a stone into the car.\" This is incorrectly stated, as\r\nwill hereafter appear.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that I should now go back and take up the narration from\r\nmy own point of view.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 19th of April I was at my law office in Saint\r\nPaul street after ten o'clock, when three members of the city council\r\ncame to me with a message from Marshal Kane, informing me that he had\r\njust received intelligence that troops were about to arrive--I did not\r\nlearn how many--and that he apprehended a disturbance, and requesting\r\nme to go to the Camden-street station. I immediately hastened to the\r\noffice of the board of police, and found that they had received a\r\nsimilar notice. The Counsellor of the City, Mr. George M. Gill, and\r\nmyself then drove rapidly in a carriage to the Camden-street station.\r\nThe police commissioners followed, and, on reaching the station, we\r\nfound Marshal Kane on the ground and the police coming in in squads. A\r\nlarge and angry crowd had assembled, but were restrained by the police\r\nfrom committing any serious breach of the peace.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable delay seven of the eleven companies of the\r\nMassachusetts regiment arrived at the station, as already mentioned,\r\nand I saw that the windows of the last car were badly broken. No one\r\nto whom I applied could inform me whether more troops were expected or\r\nnot. At this time an alarm was given that the mob was about to tear up\r\nthe rails in advance of the train on the Washington road, and Marshal\r\nKane ordered some of his men to go out the road as far as necessary to\r\nprotect the track. Soon afterward, and when I was about to leave the\r\nCamden-street station, supposing all danger to be over, news was\r\nbrought to Police Commissioner Davis and myself, who were standing\r\ntogether, that some troops had been left behind, and that the mob was\r\ntearing up the track on Pratt street, so as to obstruct the progress\r\nof the cars, which were coming to the Camden-street station. Mr. Davis\r\nimmediately ran to summon the marshal, who was at the station with a\r\nbody of police, to be sent to the point of danger, while I hastened\r\nalone in the same direction. On arriving at about Smith's Wharf, foot\r\nof Gay street, I found that anchors had been placed on the track, and\r\nthat Sergeant McComas and four policemen who were with him were not\r\nallowed by a group of rioters to remove the obstruction. I at once\r\nordered the anchors to be removed, and my authority was not resisted.\r\nI hurried on, and, approaching Pratt-street bridge, I saw a battalion,\r\nwhich proved to be four companies of the Massachusetts regiment which\r\nhad crossed the bridge, coming towards me in double-quick time.\r\n\r\nThey were firing wildly, sometimes backward, over their shoulders. So\r\nrapid was the march that they could not stop to take aim. The mob,\r\nwhich was not very large, as it seemed to me, was pursuing with shouts\r\nand stones, and, I think, an occasional pistol-shot. The uproar was\r\nfurious. I ran at once to the head of the column, some persons in the\r\ncrowd shouting, \"Here comes the mayor.\" I shook hands with the officer\r\nin command, Captain Follansbee, saying as I did so, \"I am the mayor of\r\nBaltimore.\" The captain greeted me cordially. I at once objected to\r\nthe double-quick, which was immediately stopped. I placed myself by\r\nhis side, and marched with him. He said, \"We have been attacked\r\nwithout provocation,\" or words to that effect. I replied, \"You must\r\ndefend yourselves.\" I expected that he would face his men to the rear,\r\nand, after giving warning, would fire if necessary. But I said no\r\nmore, for I immediately felt that, as mayor of the city, it was not my\r\nprovince to volunteer such advice. Once before in my life I had taken\r\npart in opposing a formidable riot, and had learned by experience\r\nthat the safest and most humane manner of quelling a mob is to meet it\r\nat the beginning with armed resistance.\r\n\r\nThe column continued its march. There was neither concert of action\r\nnor organization among the rioters. They were armed only with such\r\nstones or missiles as they could pick up, and a few pistols. My\r\npresence for a short time had some effect, but very soon the attack\r\nwas renewed with greater violence. The mob grew bolder. Stones flew\r\nthick and fast. Rioters rushed at the soldiers and attempted to snatch\r\ntheir muskets, and at least on two occasions succeeded. With one of\r\nthese muskets a soldier was killed. Men fell on both sides. A young\r\nlawyer, then and now known as a quiet citizen, seized a flag of one of\r\nthe companies and nearly tore it from its staff. He was shot through\r\nthe thigh, and was carried home apparently a dying man, but he\r\nsurvived to enter the army of the Confederacy, where he rose to the\r\nrank of captain, and he afterward returned to Baltimore, where he\r\nstill lives. The soldiers fired at will. There was no firing by\r\nplatoons, and I heard no order given to fire. I remember that at the\r\ncorner of South street several citizens standing in a group fell,\r\neither killed or wounded. It was impossible for the troops to\r\ndiscriminate between the rioters and the by-standers, but the latter\r\nseemed to suffer most, because, as the main attack was from the mob\r\npursuing the soldiers from the rear, they, in their march, could not\r\neasily face backward to fire, but could shoot at those whom they\r\npassed on the street. Near the corner of Light street a soldier was\r\nseverely wounded, who afterward died, and a boy on a vessel lying in\r\nthe dock was killed, and about the same place three soldiers at the\r\nhead of the column leveled their muskets and fired into a group\r\nstanding on the sidewalk, who, as far as I could see, were taking no\r\nactive part. The shots took effect, but I cannot say how many fell. I\r\ncried out, waving my umbrella to emphasize my words, \"For God's sake\r\ndon't shoot!\" but it was too late. The statement that I begged Captain\r\nFollansbee not to let the men fire is incorrect, although on this\r\noccasion I did say, \"Don't shoot.\" It then seemed to me that I was in\r\nthe wrong place, for my presence did not avail to protect either the\r\nsoldiers or the citizens, and I stepped out from the column. Just at\r\nthis moment a boy ran forward and handed to me a discharged musket\r\nwhich had fallen from one of the soldiers. I took it from him and\r\nhastened into the nearest shop, asking the person in charge to keep it\r\nsafely, and returned immediately to the street. This boy was far from\r\nbeing alone in his sympathy for the troops, but their friends were\r\npowerless, except to care for the wounded and remove the dead. The\r\nstatement in Colonel Jones's report that I seized a musket and killed\r\none of the rioters is entirely incorrect. The smoking musket seen in\r\nmy hands was no doubt the foundation for it. There is no foundation\r\nfor the other statement that one of the police shot a man with a\r\nrevolver. At the moment when I returned to the street, Marshal Kane,\r\nwith about fifty policemen (as I then supposed, but I have since\r\nascertained that in fact there were not so many), came at a run from\r\nthe direction of the Camden-street station, and throwing themselves in\r\nthe rear of the troops, they formed a line in front of the mob, and\r\nwith drawn revolvers kept it back. This was between Light and Charles\r\nstreets. Marshal Kane's voice shouted, \"Keep back, men, or I shoot!\"\r\nThis movement, which I saw myself, was gallantly executed, and was\r\nperfectly successful. The mob recoiled like water from a rock. One of\r\nthe leading rioters, then a young man, now a peaceful merchant, tried,\r\nas he has himself told me, to pass the line, but the marshal seized\r\nhim and vowed he would shoot if the attempt was made. This nearly\r\nended the fight, and the column passed on under the protection of the\r\npolice, without serious molestation, to Camden Station.[10] I had\r\naccompanied the troops for more than a third of a mile, and regarded\r\nthe danger as now over. At Camden-street Station there was rioting and\r\nconfusion. Commissioner Davis assisted in placing the soldiers in the\r\ncars for Washington. Some muskets were pointed out of the windows by\r\nthe soldiers. To this he earnestly objected, as likely to bring on a\r\nrenewal of the fight, and he advised the blinds to be closed. The\r\nmuskets were then withdrawn and the blinds closed, by military order,\r\nas stated by Colonel Jones.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The accounts in some of our newspapers describe serious\r\nfighting at a point beyond this, but I am satisfied they are\r\nincorrect.]\r\n\r\nAt last, about a quarter before one o'clock, the train, consisting of\r\nthirteen cars filled with troops, moved out of Camden Station amid the\r\nhisses and groans of the multitude, and passed safely on to\r\nWashington. At the outskirts of the city, half a mile or more beyond\r\nthe station, occurred the unfortunate incident of the killing of\r\nRobert W. Davis. This gentleman, a well-known dry-goods merchant, was\r\nstanding on a vacant lot near the track with two friends, and as the\r\ntrain went by they raised a cheer for Jefferson Davis and the South,\r\nwhen he was immediately shot dead by one of the soldiers from a\r\ncar-window, several firing at once. There were no rioters near them,\r\nand they did not know that the troops had been attacked on their march\r\nthrough the city. There was no \"volley of stones\" thrown just before\r\nMr. Davis was killed, nor did he or his friends throw any.[11] This\r\nwas the last of the casualties of the day, and was by far the most\r\nserious and unfortunate in its consequences, for it was not\r\nunnaturally made the most of to inflame the minds of the people\r\nagainst the Northern troops. Had it not been for this incident, there\r\nwould perhaps have been among many of our people a keener sense of\r\nblame attaching to themselves as the aggressors. Four of the\r\nMassachusetts regiment were killed and thirty-six wounded. Twelve\r\ncitizens were killed, including Mr. Davis. The number of wounded among\r\nthe latter has never been ascertained. As the fighting was at close\r\nquarters, the small number of casualties shows that it was not so\r\nsevere as has generally been supposed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Testimony of witnesses at the coroner's inquest.]\r\n\r\nBut peace even for the day had not come. The unarmed Pennsylvanians\r\nand the band of the Massachusetts regiment were still at the\r\nPresident-street station, where a mob had assembled, and the police at\r\nthat point were not sufficient to protect them. Stones were thrown,\r\nand some few of the Pennsylvania troops were hurt, not seriously, I\r\nbelieve. A good many of them were, not unnaturally, seized with a\r\npanic, and scattered through the city in different directions. Marshal\r\nKane again appeared on the scene with an adequate force, and an\r\narrangement was made with the railroad company by which the troops\r\nwere sent back in the direction of Philadelphia. During the afternoon\r\nand night a number of stragglers sought the aid of the police and were\r\ncared for at one of the station-houses.\r\n\r\nThe following card of Captain Dike, who commanded Company \"C\" of the\r\nSixth Massachusetts Regiment, appeared in the Boston _Courier_:\r\n\r\n                                         \"BALTIMORE, _April 25, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"It is but an act of justice that induces me to say to my friends\r\n     who may feel any interest, and to the community generally, that\r\n     in the affair which occurred in this city on Friday, the 19th\r\n     instant, the mayor and city authorities should be exonerated from\r\n     blame or censure, as they did all in their power, as far as my\r\n     knowledge extends, to quell the riot, and Mayor Brown attested\r\n     the sincerity of his desire to preserve the peace, and pass our\r\n     regiment safely through the city, by marching at the head of its\r\n     column, and remaining there at the risk of his life. Candor could\r\n     not permit me to say less, and a desire to place the conduct of\r\n     the authorities here on the occasion in a right position, as well\r\n     as to allay feelings, urges me to this sheer act of justice.\r\n\r\n                                                         JOHN H.

Governor Hicks was present, and\r\n     concurs in all my views as to the proceedings now necessary for\r\n     our protection. When are these scenes to cease? Are we to have a\r\n     war of sections? God forbid! The bodies of the Massachusetts\r\n     soldiers could not be sent out to Boston, as you requested, all\r\n     communication between this city and Philadelphia by railroad and\r\n     with Boston by steamer having ceased, but they have been placed\r\n     in cemented coffins, and will be placed with proper funeral\r\n     ceremonies in the mausoleum of Greenmount Cemetery, where they\r\n     shall be retained until further directions are received from you.\r\n     The wounded are tenderly cared for.

Through New York the march was triumphal.\r\n\r\n                                                       JOHN A.

It was manifest that no more troops, while the excitement\r\nlasted, could pass through without a bloody conflict. All citizens, no\r\nmatter what were their political opinions, appeared to agree in\r\nthis--the strongest friends of the Union as well as its foes. However\r\nsuch a conflict might terminate, the result would be disastrous. In\r\neach case it might bring down the vengeance of the North upon the\r\ncity. If the mob succeeded, it would probably precipitate the city,\r\nand perhaps the State, into a temporary secession. Such an event all\r\nwho had not lost their reason deprecated. The immediate and pressing\r\nnecessity was that no more troops should arrive.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hicks called out the military for the preservation of the\r\npeace and the protection of the city.\r\n\r\nAn immense public meeting assembled in Monument Square. Governor\r\nHicks, the mayor, Mr. S. Teackle Wallis, and others, addressed it.\r\n\r\nIn my speech I insisted on the maintenance of peace and order in the\r\ncity. I denied that the right of a State to secede from the Union was\r\ngranted by the Constitution. This was received with groans and shouts\r\nof disapproval by a part of the crowd, but I maintained my ground. I\r\ndeprecated war on the seceding States, and strongly expressed the\r\nopinion that the South could not be conquered. I approved of Governor\r\nHicks's determination to send no troops from Maryland to invade the\r\nSouth. I further endeavored to calm the people by informing them of\r\nthe efforts made by Governor Hicks and myself to prevent the passage\r\nof more troops through the city.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hicks said: \"I coincide in the sentiment of your worthy\r\nmayor. After three conferences we have agreed, and I bow in submission\r\nto the people. I am a Marylander; I love my State and I love the\r\nUnion, but I will suffer my right arm to be torn from my body before I\r\nwill raise it to strike a sister State.\"\r\n\r\nA dispatch had previously been sent by Governor Hicks and myself to\r\nthe President of the United States as follows: \"A collision between\r\nthe citizens and the Northern troops has taken place in Baltimore, and\r\nthe excitement is fearful. Send no troops here. We will endeavor to\r\nprevent all bloodshed. A public meeting of citizens has been called,\r\nand the troops of the State have been called out to preserve the\r\npeace. They will be enough.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately afterward, Messrs. H. Lennox Bond, a Republican, then\r\nJudge of the Criminal Court of Baltimore, and now Judge of the Circuit\r\nCourt of the United States; George W. Dobbin, an eminent lawyer, and\r\nJohn C. Brune, President of the Board of Trade, went to Washington at\r\nmy request, bearing the following letter to the President:\r\n\r\n                         \"MAYOR'S OFFICE, BALTIMORE, _April 19, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"_Sir_:--This will be presented to you by the Hon. H. Lennox\r\n     Bond, and George W. Dobbin, and John C. Brune, Esqs., who will\r\n     proceed to Washington by an express train at my request, in order\r\n     to explain fully the fearful condition of affairs in this city.\r\n     The people are exasperated to the highest degree by the passage\r\n     of troops, and the citizens are universally decided in the\r\n     opinion that no more should be ordered to come. The authorities\r\n     of the city did their best to-day to protect both strangers and\r\n     citizens and to prevent a collision, but in vain, and, but for\r\n     their great efforts, a fearful slaughter would have occurred.\r\n     Under these circumstances it is my solemn duty to inform you that\r\n     it is not possible for more soldiers to pass through Baltimore\r\n     unless they fight their way at every step. I therefore hope and\r\n     trust and most earnestly request that no more troops be permitted\r\n     or ordered by the Government to pass through the city. If they\r\n     should attempt it, the responsibility for the blood shed will not\r\n     rest upon me.\r\n\r\n     \"With great respect, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                             \"GEO. WM. BROWN, _Mayor_.\r\n\r\n     \"_To His Excellency Abraham Lincoln, President United States._\"\r\n\r\nTo this Governor Hicks added: \"I have been in Baltimore City since\r\nTuesday evening last, and cooeperated with Mayor G. W. Brown in his\r\nuntiring efforts to allay and prevent the excitement and suppress the\r\nfearful outbreak as indicated above, and I fully concur in all that is\r\nsaid by him in the above communication.\"\r\n\r\nNo reply came from Washington. The city authorities were left to act\r\non their own responsibility. Late at night reports came of troops\r\nbeing on their way both from Harrisburg and Philadelphia. It was\r\nimpossible that they could pass through the city without fighting and\r\nbloodshed. In this emergency, the board of police, including the\r\nmayor, immediately assembled for consultation, and came to the\r\nconclusion that it was necessary to burn or disable the bridges on\r\nboth railroads so far as was required to prevent the ingress of\r\ntroops. This was accordingly done at once, some of the police and a\r\ndetachment of the Maryland Guard being sent out to do the work.\r\nGovernor Hicks was first consulted and urged to give his consent, for\r\nwe desired that he should share with us the responsibility of taking\r\nthis grave step. This consent he distinctly gave in my presence and in\r\nthe presence of several others, and although there was an attempt\r\nafterward to deny the fact that he so consented, there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever about the matter. He was in my house at the time, where, on\r\nmy invitation, he had taken refuge, thinking that he was in some\r\npersonal danger at the hotel where he was staying. Early the next\r\nmorning the Governor returned to Annapolis, and after this the city\r\nauthorities had to bear alone the responsibilities which the anomalous\r\nstate of things in Baltimore had brought upon them.\r\n\r\nOn the Philadelphia Railroad the detachment sent out by special train\r\nfor the purpose of burning the bridges went as far as the Bush River,\r\nand the long bridge there, and the still longer one over the wide\r\nestuary of the Gunpowder, a few miles nearer Baltimore, were\r\npartially burned. It is an interesting fact that just as this party\r\narrived at the Bush River bridge, a volunteer party of five gentlemen\r\nfrom Baltimore reached the same place on the same errand. They had\r\nridden on horseback by night to the river, and had then gone by boat\r\nto the bridge for the purpose of burning it, and in fact they stayed\r\nat the bridge and continued the work of burning until the afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n     APRIL 20th, INCREASING EXCITEMENT. -- APPROPRIATION OF $500,000\r\n     FOR DEFENSE OF THE CITY. -- CORRESPONDENCE WITH PRESIDENT AND\r\n     GOVERNOR. -- MEN ENROLLED. -- APPREHENDED ATTACK ON FORT McHENRY.\r\n     -- MARSHAL KANE. -- INTERVIEW WITH PRESIDENT, CABINET AND GENERAL\r\n     SCOTT. -- GENERAL BUTLER, WITH THE EIGHTH MASSACHUSETTS, PROCEEDS\r\n     TO ANNAPOLIS AND WASHINGTON. -- BALTIMORE IN A STATE OF ARMED\r\n     NEUTRALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday morning, the 20th, the excitement and alarm had greatly\r\nincreased. Up to this time no answer had been received from\r\nWashington. The silence became unbearable. Were more troops to be\r\nforced through the city at any cost? If so, how were they to come, by\r\nland or water? Were the guns of Fort McHenry to be turned upon the\r\ninhabitants? Was Baltimore to be compelled at once to determine\r\nwhether she would side with the North or with the South? Or was she\r\ntemporarily to isolate herself and wait until the frenzy had in some\r\nmeasure spent its force and reason had begun to resume its sway? In\r\nany case it was plain that the authorities must have the power placed\r\nin their hands of controlling any outbreak which might occur. This was\r\nthe general opinion. Union men and disunion men appeared on the\r\nstreets with arms in their hands. A time like that predicted in\r\nScripture seemed to have come, when he who had no sword would sell his\r\ngarment to buy one.\r\n\r\nAbout ten A. M. the city council assembled and immediately\r\nappropriated $500,000, to be expended under my direction as mayor,\r\nfor the purpose of putting the city in a complete state of defense\r\nagainst any description of danger arising or which might arise out of\r\nthe present crisis. The banks of the city promptly held a meeting, and\r\na few hours afterward a committee appointed by them, consisting of\r\nthree bank presidents, Johns Hopkins, John Clark and Columbus\r\nO'Donnell, all wealthy Union men, placed the whole sum in advance at\r\nmy disposal. Mr. Scharf, in his \"History of Maryland,\" Volume 3, page\r\n416, says, in a footnote, that this action of the city authorities was\r\nendorsed by the editors of the _Sun_, _American_, _Exchange_, _German\r\nCorrespondent_, _Clipper_, _South_, etc. Other considerable sums were\r\ncontributed by individuals and firms without respect to party.\r\n\r\nOn the same morning I received a dispatch from Messrs. Bond, Dobbin\r\nand Brune, the committee who had gone to Washington, which said: \"We\r\nhave seen the President and General Scott. We have from the former a\r\nletter to the mayor and Governor declaring that no troops shall be\r\nbrought to Baltimore, if, in a military point of view and without\r\ninterruption from opposition, they can be marched around Baltimore.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Governor had left Baltimore for Annapolis early in the morning,\r\nI telegraphed him as follows:\r\n\r\n                                         \"BALTIMORE, _April 20, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"_To Governor Hicks._\r\n\r\n     \"Letter from President and General Scott.

Do you approve?\r\n\r\n                                                      GEO. WM. BROWN.\"\r\n\r\nThis telegram was based on that from Messrs. Bond, Dobbin and Brune.\r\nThe letter referred to had not been received when my telegram to\r\nGovernor Hicks was dispatched. I was mistaken in supposing that\r\nGeneral Scott had signed the letter as well as the President.\r\n\r\nPresident Lincoln's letter was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                        \"WASHINGTON, _April 20, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"_Governor Hicks and Mayor Brown._\r\n\r\n     \"_Gentlemen_:--Your letter by Messrs. Bond, Dobbin and Brune is\r\n     received. I tender you both my sincere thanks for your efforts to\r\n     keep the peace in the trying situation in which you are placed.\r\n     For the future troops _must_ be brought here, but I make no point\r\n     of bringing them _through_ Baltimore.\r\n\r\n     \"Without any military knowledge myself, of course I must leave\r\n     details to General Scott. He hastily said this morning, in\r\n     presence of these gentlemen, 'March them _around_ Baltimore, and\r\n     not through it.'\r\n\r\n     \"I sincerely hope the General, on fuller reflection, will\r\n     consider this practical and proper, and that you will not object\r\n     to it.\r\n\r\n     \"By this, a collision of the people of Baltimore with the troops\r\n     will be avoided unless they go out of their way to seek it. I\r\n     hope you will exert your influence to prevent this.\r\n\r\n     \"Now and ever I shall do all in my power for peace consistently\r\n     with the maintenance of government.\r\n\r\n     \"Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                          A. LINCOLN.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Hicks replied as follows to my telegram:\r\n\r\n                                         \"ANNAPOLIS, _April 20, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"_To the Mayor of Baltimore._\r\n\r\n     \"Your dispatch received.

I know you will do\r\n     all in your power to preserve the peace.\r\n\r\n                                                      THOS. H. HICKS.\"\r\n\r\nI then telegraphed to the President as follows:\r\n\r\n                               \"BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, _April 20, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"_To President Lincoln._\r\n\r\n     \"Every effort will be made to prevent parties leaving the city to\r\n     molest troops marching to Washington. Baltimore seeks only to\r\n     protect herself. Governor Hicks has gone to Annapolis, but I have\r\n     telegraphed to him.\r\n\r\n                               \"GEO. WM. BROWN, _Mayor of Baltimore_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the receipt of the dispatch from Messrs. Bond, Dobbin and Brune,\r\nanother committee was sent to Washington, consisting of Messrs.\r\nAnthony Kennedy, Senator of the United States, and J. Morrison Harris,\r\nmember of the House of Representatives, both Union men, who sent a\r\ndispatch to me saying that they \"had seen the President, Secretaries\r\nof State, Treasury and War, and also General Scott. The result is the\r\ntransmission of orders that will stop the passage of troops through or\r\naround the city.\"\r\n\r\nPreparations for the defense of the city were nevertheless continued.\r\nWith this object I issued a notice in which I said: \"All citizens\r\nhaving arms suitable for the defense of the city, and which they are\r\nwilling to contribute for the purpose, are requested to deposit them\r\nat the office of the marshal of police.\"\r\n\r\nThe board of police enrolled temporarily a considerable number of men\r\nand placed them under the command of Colonel Isaac R. Trimble. He\r\ninforms me that the number amounted to more than fifteen thousand,\r\nabout three-fourths armed with muskets, shotguns and pistols.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was afterward a Major-General in the Confederate Army,\r\nwhere he distinguished himself. He lost a leg at Gettysburg.\r\n\r\nBy this means not only was the inadequate number of the police\r\nsupplemented, but many who would otherwise have been the disturbers of\r\nthe peace became its defenders. And, indeed, not a few of the men\r\nenrolled, who thought and hoped that their enrollment meant war, were\r\ndisappointed to find that the prevention of war was the object of the\r\ncity authorities, and afterwards found their way into the Confederacy.\r\n\r\nFor some days it looked very much as if Baltimore had taken her stand\r\ndecisively with the South; at all events, the outward expressions of\r\nSouthern feeling were very emphatic, and the Union sentiment\r\ntemporarily disappeared.\r\n\r\nEarly on the morning of Saturday, the 20th, a large Confederate flag\r\nfloated from the headquarters of a States Rights club on Fayette\r\nstreet near Calvert, and on the afternoon of the same day the Minute\r\nMen, a Union club, whose headquarters were on Baltimore street, gave a\r\nmost significant indication of the strength of the wave of feeling\r\nwhich swept over our people by hauling down the National colors and\r\nrunning up in their stead the State flag of Maryland, amid the cheers\r\nof the crowd.[12] Everywhere on the streets men and boys were wearing\r\nbadges which displayed miniature Confederate flags, and were cheering\r\nthe Southern cause. Military companies began to arrive from the\r\ncounties. On Saturday, first came a company of seventy men from\r\nFrederick, under Captain Bradley T. Johnson, afterward General in the\r\nSouthern Army, and next two cavalry companies from Baltimore County,\r\nand one from Anne Arundel County. These last, the Patapsco Dragoons,\r\nsome thirty men, a sturdy-looking body of yeomanry, rode straight to\r\nthe City Hall and drew up, expecting to be received with a speech of\r\nwelcome from the mayor. I made them a very brief address, and informed\r\nthem that dispatches received from Washington had postponed the\r\nnecessity for their services, whereupon they started homeward amid\r\ncheers, their bugler striking up \"Dixie,\" which was the first time I\r\nheard that tune. A few days after, they came into Baltimore again. On\r\nSunday came in the Howard County Dragoons, and by steamboat that\r\nmorning two companies from Talbot County, and soon it was reported\r\nthat from Harford, Cecil, Carroll and Prince George's, companies were\r\non their way. All the city companies of uniformed militia were, of\r\ncourse, under arms. Three batteries of light artillery were in the\r\nstreets, among them the light field-pieces belonging to the military\r\nschool at Catonsville, but these the reverend rector of the school, a\r\nstrong Union man, had thoughtfully spiked.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Baltimore _American_, April 22.]\r\n\r\nThe United States arsenal at Pikesville, at the time unoccupied, was\r\ntaken possession of by some Baltimore County troops.\r\n\r\nFrom the local columns of the _American_ of the 22d, a paper which was\r\nstrongly on the Union side, I take the following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"WAR SPIRIT ON SATURDAY.\r\n\r\n\"The war spirit raged throughout the city and among all classes during\r\nSaturday with an ardor which seemed to gather fresh force each\r\nhour.... All were united in a determination to resist at every hazard\r\nthe passage of troops through Baltimore.... Armed men were marching\r\nthrough the streets, and the military were moving about in every\r\ndirection, and it is evident that Baltimore is to be the battlefield\r\nof the Southern revolution.\"\r\n\r\nAnd from the _American_ of Tuesday, 23d:\r\n\r\n\"At the works of the Messrs. Winans their entire force is engaged in\r\nthe making of pikes, and in casting balls of every description for\r\ncannon, the steam gun,[13] rifles, muskets, etc., which they are\r\nturning out very rapidly.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Winans's steam gun, a recently invented, and, it was\r\nsupposed, very formidable engine, was much talked about at this time.\r\nIt was not very long afterwards seized and confiscated by the military\r\nauthorities.]\r\n\r\nAnd a very significant paragraph from the _Sun_ of the same day:\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday morning between 300 and 400 of our most respectable colored\r\nresidents made a tender of their services to the city authorities.\r\nThe mayor thanked them for their offer, and informed them that their\r\nservices will be called for if they can be made in any way available.\"\r\n\r\nOfficers from Maryland in the United States Army were sending in their\r\nresignations. Colonel (afterward General) Huger, of South Carolina,\r\nwho had recently resigned, and was in Baltimore at the time, was made\r\nColonel of the Fifty-third Regiment, composed of the Independent Greys\r\nand the six companies of the Maryland Guard.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, the 22d, I issued an order directing that all the\r\ndrinking-saloons should be closed that day, and the order was\r\nenforced.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, April 20th, Captain John C. Robinson, now Major-General,\r\nthen in command at Fort McHenry, which stands at the entrance of the\r\nharbor, wrote to Colonel L. Thomas, Adjutant-General of the United\r\nStates Army, that he would probably be attacked that night, but he\r\nbelieved he could hold the fort.\r\n\r\nIn the September number, for the year 1885, of _American History_\r\nthere is an article written by General Robinson, entitled \"Baltimore\r\nin 1861,\" in which he speaks of the apprehended attack on the fort,\r\nand of the conduct of the Baltimore authorities.\r\n\r\nHe says that about nine o'clock on the evening of the 20th, Police\r\nCommissioner Davis called at the fort, bringing a letter, dated eight\r\no'clock P. M. of the same evening, from Charles Howard, the president\r\nof the board, which he quotes at length, and which states that, from\r\nrumors that had reached the board, they were apprehensive that the\r\ncommander of the fort might be annoyed by lawless and disorderly\r\ncharacters approaching the walls of the fort, and they proposed to\r\nsend a guard of perhaps two hundred men to station themselves on\r\nWhetstone Point, of course beyond the outer limits of the fort, with\r\norders to arrest and hand over to the civil authorities any\r\nevil-disposed and disorderly persons who might approach the fort. The\r\nletter further stated that this duty would have been confided to the\r\npolice force, but their services were so imperatively required\r\nelsewhere that it would be impossible to detail a sufficient number,\r\nand this duty had therefore been entrusted to a detachment of the\r\nregular organized militia of the State, then called out pursuant to\r\nlaw, and actually in the service of the State. It was added that the\r\ncommanding officer of the detachment would be ordered to communicate\r\nwith Captain Robinson. The letter closed with repeating the assurance\r\nverbally given to Captain Robinson in the morning that no disturbance\r\nat or near the post should be made with the sanction of any of the\r\nconstituted authorities of the city of Baltimore; but, on the\r\ncontrary, all their powers should be exerted to prevent anything of\r\nthe kind by any parties. A postscript stated that there might perhaps\r\nbe a troop of volunteer cavalry with the detachment.\r\n\r\nGeneral Robinson continues:\r\n\r\n     \"I did not question the good faith of Mr. Howard, but\r\n     Commissioner Davis verbally stated that they proposed to send the\r\n     Maryland Guards to help protect the fort. Having made the\r\n     acquaintance of some of the officers of that organization, and\r\n     heard them freely express their opinions, I declined the offered\r\n     support, and then the following conversation occurred:\r\n\r\n     \"_Commandant._ I am aware, sir, that we are to be attacked\r\n     to-night. I received notice of it before sundown. If you will go\r\n     outside with me you will see we are prepared for it. You will\r\n     find the guns loaded, and men standing by them. As for the\r\n     Maryland Guards, they cannot come here. I am acquainted with some\r\n     of those gentlemen, and know what their sentiments are.\r\n\r\n     \"_Commissioner Davis._ Why, Captain, we are anxious to avoid a\r\n     collision.\r\n\r\n     \"_Commandant._ So am I, sir. If you wish to avoid a collision,\r\n     place your city military anywhere between the city and that\r\n     chapel on the road, but if they come this side of it, I shall\r\n     fire on them.\r\n\r\n     \"_Commissioner Davis._ Would you fire into the city of Baltimore?\r\n\r\n     \"_Commandant._ I should be sorry to do it, sir, but if it becomes\r\n     necessary in order to hold this fort, I shall not hesitate for\r\n     one moment.\r\n\r\n     \"_Commissioner Davis_ (excitedly). I assure you, Captain\r\n     Robinson, if there is a woman or child killed in that city, there\r\n     will not be one of you left alive here, sir.\r\n\r\n     \"_Commandant._ Very well, sir, I will take the chances. Now, I\r\n     assure you, Mr. Davis, if your Baltimore mob comes down here\r\n     to-night, you will not have another mob in Baltimore for ten\r\n     years to come, sir.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Davis is a well-known and respected citizen of Baltimore, who has\r\nfilled various important public offices with credit, and at present\r\nholds a high position in the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.\r\nAccording to his recollection, the interview was more courteous and\r\nless dramatic than would be supposed from the account given by General\r\nRobinson. Mr. Davis says that the people of Baltimore were acquainted\r\nwith the defenseless condition of the fort, and that in the excited\r\nstate of the public mind this fact probably led to the apprehension\r\nand consequent rumor that an attempt would be made to capture it. The\r\npolice authorities believed, and, as it turned out, correctly, that\r\nthe rumor was without foundation; yet, to avoid the danger of any\r\ndisturbance whatever, the precautions were taken which are described\r\nin the letter of Mr. Howard, and Mr. Davis went in person to deliver\r\nit to Captain Robinson.\r\n\r\nHis interview was not, however, confined to Captain Robinson, but\r\nincluded also other officers of the fort, and Mr. Davis was hospitably\r\nreceived. A conversation ensued in regard to the threatened attack,\r\nand, with one exception, was conducted without asperity. A junior\r\nofficer threatened, in case of an attack, to direct the fire of a\r\ncannon on the Washington Monument, which stands in the heart of the\r\ncity, and to this threat Mr. Davis replied with heat, \"If you do\r\nthat, and if a woman or child is killed, there will be nothing left of\r\nyou but your brass buttons to tell who you were.\"\r\n\r\nThe commandant insisted that the military sent by the board should not\r\napproach the fort nearer than the Roman Catholic chapel, a demand to\r\nwhich Mr. Davis readily assented, as that situation commanded the only\r\napproach from the city to the fort. In the midst of the conversation\r\nthe long roll was sounded, and the whole garrison rushed to arms. For\r\na long time, and until the alarm was over, Mr. Davis was left alone.\r\n\r\nGeneral Robinson was mistaken in his conjecture, \"when it seemed to\r\nhim that for hours of the night mounted men from the country were\r\ncrossing the bridges of the Patapsco.\" There was but one bridge over\r\nthe Patapsco, known as the Long Bridge, from which any sound of\r\npassing horsemen or vehicles of any description could possibly have\r\nbeen heard at the fort. The sounds which did reach the fort from the\r\nLong Bridge during the hours of the night were probably the market\r\nwagons of Anne Arundel County passing to and from the city on their\r\nusual errand, and the one or two companies from that county, which\r\ncame to Baltimore during the period of disturbance, no doubt rode in\r\nover the Long Bridge by daylight.\r\n\r\nGeneral Robinson, after describing in his paper the riot of the 19th\r\nof April and the unfortunate event of the killing of Mr. Davis, adds:\r\n\"It is impossible to describe the intense excitement that now\r\nprevailed. Only those who saw and felt it can understand or conceive\r\nany adequate idea of its extent\"; and in this connection he mentions\r\nthe fact that Marshal Kane, chief of the police force, on the evening\r\nof the 19th of April, telegraphed to Bradley T. Johnson, at\r\nFrederick, as follows: \"Streets red with Maryland blood; send\r\nexpresses over the mountains of Maryland and Virginia for the riflemen\r\nto come without delay. Fresh hordes will be down on us to-morrow. We\r\nwill fight them and whip them, or die.\"\r\n\r\nThe sending of this dispatch was indeed a startling event, creating a\r\nnew complication and embarrassing in the highest degree to the city\r\nauthorities. The marshal of police, who had gallantly and successfully\r\nprotected the national troops on the 18th and 19th, was so carried\r\naway by the frenzy of the hour that he had thus on his own\r\nresponsibility summoned volunteers from Virginia and Maryland to\r\ncontest the passage of national troops through the city. Different\r\nviews were taken by members of the board of police. It was considered,\r\non the one hand, that the services of Colonel Kane were, in that\r\ncrisis, indispensable, because no one could control as he could the\r\nsecession element of the city, which was then in the ascendant and\r\nmight get control of the city, and, on the other, that his usefulness\r\nhad ceased, because not only had the gravest offense been given to the\r\nUnion sentiment of the city by this dispatch, but the authorities in\r\nWashington, while he was at the head of the police, could no longer\r\nhave any confidence in the police, or perhaps in the board itself. The\r\nformer consideration prevailed.\r\n\r\nIt is due to Marshal Kane to say that subsequently, and while he\r\nremained in office, he performed his duty to the satisfaction of the\r\nBoard. Some years after the war was over he was elected sheriff, and\r\nstill later mayor of the city, and in both capacities he enjoyed the\r\nrespect and regard of the community.\r\n\r\nIt may with propriety be added that the conservative position and\r\naction of the police board were so unsatisfactory to many of the more\r\nheated Southern partisans, that a scheme was at one time seriously\r\nentertained by them to suppress the board, and transfer the control of\r\nthe police force to other hands. Happily for all parties, better\r\ncounsels prevailed.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 21st of April, with three prominent citizens of\r\nBaltimore, I went to Washington, and we there had an interview with\r\nthe President and Cabinet and General Scott. This interview was of so\r\nmuch importance, that a statement of what occurred was prepared on the\r\nsame day and was immediately published. It is here given at length:\r\n\r\n                                                BALTIMORE, _April 21_.\r\n\r\n     Mayor Brown received a dispatch from the President of the United\r\n     States at three o'clock A. M. (this morning), directed to himself\r\n     and Governor Hicks, requesting them to go to Washington by\r\n     special train, in order to consult with Mr. Lincoln for the\r\n     preservation of the peace of Maryland. The mayor replied that\r\n     Governor Hicks was not in the city, and inquired if he should go\r\n     alone. Receiving an answer by telegraph in the affirmative, his\r\n     Honor, accompanied by George W. Dobbin, John C. Brune and S. T.\r\n     Wallis, Esqs., whom he had summoned to attend him, proceeded at\r\n     once to the station. After a series of delays they were enabled\r\n     to procure a special train about half-past seven o'clock, in\r\n     which they arrived at Washington about ten.\r\n\r\n     They repaired at once to the President's house, where they were\r\n     admitted to an immediate interview, to which the Cabinet and\r\n     General Scott were summoned. A long conversation and discussion\r\n     ensued. The President, upon his part, recognized the good faith\r\n     of the city and State authorities, and insisted upon his own. He\r\n     admitted the excited state of feeling in Baltimore, and his\r\n     desire and duty to avoid the fatal consequences of a collision\r\n     with the people. He urged, on the other hand, the absolute,\r\n     irresistible necessity of having a transit through the State for\r\n     such troops as might be necessary for the protection of the\r\n     Federal capital. The protection of Washington, he asserted with\r\n     great earnestness, was the sole object of concentrating troops\r\n     there, and he protested that none of the troops brought through\r\n     Maryland were intended for any purposes hostile to the State, or\r\n     aggressive as against the Southern States. Being now unable to\r\n     bring them up the Potomac in security, the President must either\r\n     bring them through Maryland or abandon the capital.\r\n\r\n     He called on General Scott for his opinion, which the General\r\n     gave at length, to the effect that troops might be brought\r\n     through Maryland without going through Baltimore, by either\r\n     carrying them from Perryville to Annapolis, and thence by rail to\r\n     Washington, or by bringing them to the Relay House on the\r\n     Northern Central Railroad [about seven miles north of the city],\r\n     and marching them to the Relay House on the Washington Railroad\r\n     [about seven miles south-west of the city], and thence by rail to\r\n     the capital. If the people would permit them to go by either of\r\n     these routes uninterruptedly, the necessity of their passing\r\n     through Baltimore would be avoided. If the people would not\r\n     permit them a transit thus remote from the city, they must select\r\n     their own best route, and, if need be, fight their own way\r\n     through Baltimore--a result which the General earnestly\r\n     deprecated.\r\n\r\n     The President expressed his hearty concurrence in the desire to\r\n     avoid a collision, and said that no more troops should be ordered\r\n     through Baltimore if they were permitted to go uninterrupted by\r\n     either of the other routes suggested. In this disposition the\r\n     Secretary of War expressed his participation.\r\n\r\n     Mayor Brown assured the President that the city authorities would\r\n     use all lawful means to prevent their citizens from leaving\r\n     Baltimore to attack the troops in passing at a distance; but he\r\n     urged, at the same time, the impossibility of their being able to\r\n     promise anything more than their best efforts in that direction.\r\n     The excitement was great, he told the President, the people of\r\n     all classes were fully aroused, and it was impossible for any one\r\n     to answer for the consequences of the presence of Northern troops\r\n     anywhere within our borders. He reminded the President also that\r\n     the jurisdiction of the city authorities was confined to their\r\n     own population, and that he could give no promises for the people\r\n     elsewhere, because he would be unable to keep them if given. The\r\n     President frankly acknowledged this difficulty, and said that the\r\n     Government would only ask the city authorities to use their best\r\n     efforts with respect to those under their jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n     The interview terminated with the distinct assurance on the part\r\n     of the President that no more troops would be sent through\r\n     Baltimore, unless obstructed in their transit in other\r\n     directions, and with the understanding that the city authorities\r\n     should do their best to restrain their own people.\r\n\r\n     The Mayor and his companions availed themselves of the\r\n     President's full discussion of the day to urge upon him\r\n     respectfully, but in the most earnest manner, a course of policy\r\n     which would give peace to the country, and especially the\r\n     withdrawal of all orders contemplating the passage of troops\r\n     through any part of Maryland.\r\n\r\n     On returning to the cars, and when just about to leave, about 2\r\n     P. M., the Mayor received a dispatch from Mr. Garrett (the\r\n     President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad) announcing the\r\n     approach of troops to Cockeysville [about fourteen miles from\r\n     Baltimore on the Northern Central Railroad], and the excitement\r\n     consequent upon it in the city. Mr. Brown and his companions\r\n     returned at once to the President and asked an immediate\r\n     audience, which was promptly given. The Mayor exhibited Mr.\r\n     Garrett's dispatch, which gave the President great surprise. He\r\n     immediately summoned the Secretary of War and General Scott, who\r\n     soon appeared with other members of the Cabinet. The dispatch was\r\n     submitted. The President at once, in the most decided way, urged\r\n     the recall of the troops, saying he had no idea they would be\r\n     there. Lest there should be the slightest suspicion of bad faith\r\n     on his part in summoning the Mayor to Washington and allowing\r\n     troops to march on the city during his absence, he desired that\r\n     the troops should, if it were practicable, be sent back at once\r\n     to York or Harrisburg. General Scott adopted the President's\r\n     views warmly, and an order was accordingly prepared by the\r\n     Lieutenant-General to that effect, and forwarded by Major Belger,\r\n     of the Army, who also accompanied the Mayor to this city. The\r\n     troops at Cockeysville, the Mayor was assured, were not brought\r\n     there for transit through the city, but were intended to be\r\n     marched to the Relay House on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.\r\n     They will proceed to Harrisburg, from there to Philadelphia, and\r\n     thence by the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal or by Perryville, as\r\n     Major-General Patterson may direct.\r\n\r\n     This statement is made by the authority of the Mayor and Messrs.\r\n     George W. Dobbin, John C. Brune and S. T. Wallis, who accompanied\r\n     Mr. Brown, and who concurred with him in all particulars in the\r\n     course adopted by him in the two interviews with Mr. Lincoln.\r\n\r\n                                              GEO. WM. BROWN, _Mayor_.\r\n\r\nThis statement was written by Mr. Wallis, at the request of his\r\nassociates, on the train, and was given to the public immediately on\r\ntheir return to the city.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the first conversation Mr. Simon Cameron called my\r\nattention to the fact that an iron bridge on the Northern Central\r\nRailway, which, he remarked, belonged to the city of Baltimore, had\r\nbeen disabled by a skilled person so as to inflict little injury on\r\nthe bridge, and he desired to know by what authority this had been\r\ndone. Up to this time nothing had been said about the disabling of the\r\nbridges. In reply I addressed myself to the President, and said, with\r\nmuch earnestness, that the disabling of this bridge, and of the other\r\nbridges, had been done by authority, as the reader has already been\r\ntold, and that it was a measure of protection on a sudden emergency,\r\ndesigned to prevent bloodshed in the city of Baltimore, and not an act\r\nof hostility towards the General Government; that the people of\r\nMaryland had always been deeply attached to the Union, which had been\r\nshown on all occasions, but that they, including the citizens of\r\nBaltimore, regarded the proclamation calling for 75,000 troops as an\r\nact of war on the South, and a violation of its constitutional rights,\r\nand that it was not surprising that a high-spirited people, holding\r\nsuch opinions, should resent the passage of Northern troops through\r\ntheir city for such a purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln was greatly moved, and, springing up from his chair,\r\nwalked backward and forward through the apartment. He said, with great\r\nfeeling, \"Mr. Brown, I am not a learned man! I am not a learned man!\"\r\nthat his proclamation had not been correctly understood; that he had\r\nno intention of bringing on war, but that his purpose was to defend\r\nthe capital, which was in danger of being bombarded from the heights\r\nacross the Potomac.\r\n\r\nI am giving here only a part of a frank and full conversation, in\r\nwhich others present participated.\r\n\r\nThe telegram of Mr. Garrett to me referred to in the preceding\r\nstatement is in the following words: \"Three thousand Northern troops\r\nare reported to be at Cockeysville. Intense excitement prevails.\r\nChurches have been dismissed and the people are arming in mass. To\r\nprevent terrific bloodshed, the result of your interview and\r\narrangement is awaited.\"\r\n\r\nTo this the following reply to Mr. Garrett was made by me: \"Your\r\ntelegram received on our return from an interview with the President,\r\nCabinet and General Scott. Be calm and do nothing until you hear from\r\nme again. I return to see the President at once and will telegraph\r\nagain. Wallis, Brune and Dobbin are with me.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after the second interview, the following dispatch was\r\nsent by me to Mr. Garrett: \"We have again seen the President, General\r\nScott, Secretary of War and other members of the Cabinet, and the\r\ntroops are ordered to return forthwith to Harrisburg. A messenger goes\r\nwith us from General Scott. We return immediately.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Garrett's telegram was not exaggerated. It was a fearful day in\r\nBaltimore. Women and children, and men, too, were wild with\r\nexcitement. A certainty of a fight in the streets if Northern troops\r\nshould enter was the pressing danger. Those who were arming in hot\r\nhaste to resist the passage of Northern troops little recked of the\r\nfearful risk to which they were exposing themselves and all they held\r\ndear. It was well for the city and State that the President had\r\ndecided as he did. When the President gave his deliberate decision\r\nthat the troops should pass around Baltimore and not through it,\r\nGeneral Scott, stern soldier as he sometimes was, said with emotion,\r\n\"Mr. President, I thank you for this, and God will bless you for it.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the depth of our hearts my colleagues and myself thanked both the\r\nGeneral and the President.\r\n\r\nThe troops on the line of the Northern Central Railway--some 2400 men,\r\nabout half of them armed--did not receive their orders to return to\r\nPennsylvania until after several days. As they had expected to make\r\nthe journey to Washington by rail, they were naturally not well\r\nequipped or supplied for camp life. I take the following from the\r\n_Sun_ of April 23d: \"By order of Marshal Kane, several wagon-loads of\r\nbread and meat were sent to the camp of the Pennsylvania troops, it\r\nbeing understood that a number were sick and suffering for proper food\r\nand nourishment.... One of the Pennsylvanians died on Sunday and was\r\nburied within the encampment. Two more died yesterday and a number of\r\nothers were on the sick list. The troops were deficient in food,\r\nhaving nothing but crackers to feed upon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Eighth Massachusetts Regiment, under command of General Butler,\r\nwas the next which passed through Maryland. It reached Perryville, on\r\nthe Susquehanna, by rail on the 20th, and there embarked on the\r\nsteamboat _Maryland_, arriving at Annapolis early on the morning of\r\nthe 21st. Governor Hicks addressed the General a note advising that he\r\nshould not land his men, on account of the great excitement there, and\r\nstated that he had telegraphed to that effect to the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe Governor also wrote to the President, advising him to order\r\nelsewhere the troops then off Annapolis, and to send no more through\r\nMaryland, and added the surprising suggestion that Lord Lyons, the\r\nBritish Minister, be requested to act as mediator between the\r\ncontending parties of the country.\r\n\r\nThe troops, however, were landed without opposition. The railway from\r\nAnnapolis leading to the Washington road had, in some places, been\r\ntorn up, but it was promptly repaired by the soldiers, and by the 25th\r\nan unobstructed route was opened through Annapolis to Washington.\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley, in his book called \"The American Conflict,\" denounces\r\nwith characteristic vehemence and severity of language the proceedings\r\nof the city authorities. He scouts \"the demands\" of the Mayor and his\r\nassociates, whom he designates as \"Messrs. Brown & Co.\" He insists\r\nthat practically on the morning of the 20th of April Maryland was a\r\nmember of the Southern Confederacy, and that her Governor spoke and\r\nacted the bidding of a cabal of the ablest and most envenomed\r\ntraitors.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the city then, and for days afterwards, was in an\r\nanomalous condition, which may be best described as one of \"armed\r\nneutrality\"; but it is not true that in any sense it was, on the 20th\r\nof April, or at any other time, a member of the Southern Confederacy.\r\nOn the contrary, while many, especially among the young and reckless,\r\nwere doing their utmost to place it in that position, regardless of\r\nconsequences, and would, if they could, have forced the hands of the\r\ncity authorities, it was their conduct which prevented such a\r\ncatastrophe. Temporizing and delay were necessary. As soon as passions\r\nhad time to cool, a strong reaction set in and the people rapidly\r\ndivided into two parties--one on the side of the North, and the other\r\non the side of the South; but whatever might be their personal or\r\npolitical sympathies, it was clear to all who had not lost their\r\nreason that Maryland, which lay open from the North by both land and\r\nsea, would be kept in the Union for the sake of the national capital,\r\neven if it required the united power of the nation to accomplish the\r\nobject. The telegraph wires on the lines leading to the North had been\r\ncut, and for some days the city was without regular telegraphic\r\nconnection. For a longer time the mails were interrupted and travel\r\nwas stopped. The buoys in the harbor were temporarily removed. The\r\nbusiness interests of the city of course suffered under these\r\ninterruptions, and would be paralyzed if such isolation were to\r\ncontinue, and the merchants soon began to demand that the channels of\r\ntrade should be reopened to the north and east.\r\n\r\nThe immediate duty of the city authorities was to keep the peace and\r\nprotect the city, and, without going into details or discussing the\r\nconduct of individuals, I shall leave others to speak of the manner in\r\nwhich it was performed.\r\n\r\nColonel Scharf, in his \"History of Maryland,\" Volume III, p. 415, sums\r\nup the matter as follows: \"In such a period of intense excitement,\r\nmany foolish and unnecessary acts were undoubtedly done by persons in\r\nthe employment of the city, as well as by private individuals, but it\r\nis undoubtedly true that the Mayor and board of police commissioners\r\nwere inflexibly determined to resist all attempts to force the city\r\ninto secession or into acts of hostility to the Federal Government,\r\nand that they successfully accomplished their purpose. If they had\r\nbeen otherwise disposed, they could easily have effected their\r\nobject.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n     SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY. -- REPORT OF THE BOARD OF\r\n     POLICE. -- SUPPRESSION OF THE FLAGS. -- ON THE 5th OF MAY,\r\n     GENERAL BUTLER TAKES POSITION SEVEN MILES FROM BALTIMORE. -- ON\r\n     THE 13TH OF MAY, HE ENTERS BALTIMORE AND FORTIFIES FEDERAL HILL.\r\n     -- THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WILL TAKE NO STEPS TOWARDS SECESSION. --\r\n     MANY YOUNG MEN JOIN THE ARMY OF THE CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of April, Governor Hicks convened the General Assembly of\r\nthe State, to meet in special session at Annapolis on the 26th, to\r\ndeliberate and consider of the condition of the State, and to take\r\nsuch measures as in their wisdom they might deem fit to maintain peace\r\nand order and security within its limits.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of April, \"in consequence of the extraordinary state of\r\naffairs,\" Governor Hicks changed the meeting of the Assembly to\r\nFrederick. The candidates for the House of Delegates for the city of\r\nBaltimore, who had been returned as elected to the General Assembly in\r\n1859, had been refused their seats, as previously stated, and a new\r\nelection in the city had therefore become necessary to fill the\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\nA special election for that purpose was accordingly held in the city\r\non the 24th instant. Only a States Rights ticket was presented, for\r\nwhich nine thousand two hundred and forty-four votes were cast. The\r\ncandidates elected were: John C. Brune, Ross Winans, Henry M.\r\nWarfield, J. Hanson Thomas, T. Parkin Scott, H. M. Morfit, S. Teackle\r\nWallis, Charles H. Pitts, William G. Harrison and Lawrence Sangston,\r\nwell-known and respected citizens, and the majority of them nominated\r\nbecause of their known conservatism and declared opposition to violent\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThis General Assembly, which contained men of unusual weight and force\r\nof character, will ever remain memorable in Maryland for the courage\r\nand ability with which it maintained the constitutional rights of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nOn the 3d of May, the board of police made a report of its proceedings\r\nto the Legislature of the State, signed by Charles Howard, President.\r\nAfter speaking of the disabling of the railroads, it concludes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"The absolute necessity of the measures thus determined upon by\r\n     the Governor, Mayor and Police Board, is fully illustrated by the\r\n     fact that early on Sunday morning reliable information reached\r\n     the city of the presence of a large body of Pennsylvania troops,\r\n     amounting to about twenty-four hundred men, who had reached\r\n     Ashland, near Cockeysville, by the way of the Northern Central\r\n     Railroad, and was stopped in their progress towards Baltimore by\r\n     the partial destruction of the Ashland bridge. Every intelligent\r\n     citizen at all acquainted with the state of feeling then\r\n     existing, must be satisfied that if these troops had attempted to\r\n     march through the city, an immense loss of life would have ensued\r\n     in the conflict which would necessarily have taken place. The\r\n     bitter feelings already engendered would have been intensely\r\n     increased by such a conflict; all attempts at conciliation would\r\n     have been vain, and terrible destruction would have been the\r\n     consequence, if, as is certain, other bodies of troops had\r\n     insisted on forcing their way through the city.\r\n\r\n     \"The tone of the whole Northern press and the mass of the\r\n     population was violent in the extreme. Incursions upon our city\r\n     were daily threatened, not only by troops in the service of the\r\n     Federal Government, but by the vilest and most reckless\r\n     desperadoes, acting independently, and, as they threatened, in\r\n     despite of the Government, backed by well-known influential\r\n     citizens, and sworn to the commission of all kinds of excesses.\r\n     In short, every possible effort was made to alarm this community.\r\n     In this condition of things the Board felt it to be their solemn\r\n     duty to continue the organization which had already been\r\n     commenced, for the purpose of assuring the people of Baltimore\r\n     that no effort would be spared to protect all within its borders,\r\n     to the extent of their ability. All the means employed were\r\n     devoted to this end, and with no view of producing a collision\r\n     with the General Government, which the Board were particularly\r\n     anxious to avoid, and an arrangement was happily effected by the\r\n     Mayor with the General Government that no troops should be passed\r\n     through the city. As an evidence of the determination of the\r\n     Board to prevent such collision, a sufficient guard was sent in\r\n     the neighborhood of Fort McHenry several nights to arrest all\r\n     parties who might be engaged in a threatened attack upon it, and\r\n     a steam-tug was employed, properly manned, to prevent any hostile\r\n     demonstration upon the receiving-ship _Alleghany_, lying at\r\n     anchor in the harbor, of all which the United States officers in\r\n     command were duly notified.\r\n\r\n     \"Property of various descriptions belonging to the Government and\r\n     individuals was taken possession of by the police force with a\r\n     view to its security. The best care has been taken of it. Every\r\n     effort has been made to discover the rightful owners, and a\r\n     portion of it has already been forwarded to order. Arrangements\r\n     have been made with the Government agents satisfactory to them\r\n     for the portion belonging to it, and the balance is held subject\r\n     to the order of its owners.\r\n\r\n     \"Amidst all the excitement and confusion which has since\r\n     prevailed, the Board take great pleasure in stating that the good\r\n     order and peace of the city have been preserved to an\r\n     extraordinary degree. Indeed, to judge from the accounts given by\r\n     the press of other cities of what has been the state of things in\r\n     their own communities, Baltimore, during the whole of the past\r\n     week and up to this date, will compare favorably, as to the\r\n     protection which persons and property have enjoyed, with any\r\n     other large city in the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMuch has been said in regard to the suppression of the national flag\r\nin Baltimore during the disturbances, and it is proper that the facts\r\nshould here be stated.\r\n\r\nGeneral Robinson, in his description of the occurrences which took\r\nplace after the 19th of April, says that meetings were held under the\r\nflag of the State of Maryland, at which the speeches were inflammatory\r\nsecession harangues, and that the national flag disappeared, and no\r\nman dared to display it. Whether or not this statement exactly\r\nrepresents the condition of things, it at least approximates it, and\r\non the 26th of April, an order was issued by the board of police\r\nreciting that the peace of the city was likely to be disturbed by the\r\ndisplay of various flags, and directing that no flag of any\r\ndescription should be raised or carried through the streets. On April\r\n29th, the city council passed an ordinance, signed by the Mayor,\r\nauthorizing him, when in his opinion the peace of the city required\r\nit, to prohibit by proclamation for a limited period, to be designated\r\nby him, the public display of all flags or banners in the city of\r\nBaltimore, except on buildings or vessels occupied or employed by the\r\nGovernment of the United States. On the same day I, in pursuance of\r\nthe ordinance, issued a proclamation prohibiting the display of flags\r\nfor thirty days, with the exception stated in the ordinance, and on\r\nthe 10th of May, when I was satisfied that all danger was over, I\r\nissued a proclamation removing the prohibition. The only violation of\r\nthe order which came under my notice during the period of suppression\r\nwas on the part of a military company which had the Maryland flag\r\nflying at its headquarters, on Lexington street near the City Hall. On\r\nmy directing this flag to be taken down, the request was at once\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\nGeneral Robinson says that \"the first demonstration of returning\r\nloyalty was on the 28th day of April, when a sailing vessel came down\r\nthe river crowded with men, and covered from stem to stern with\r\nnational flags. She sailed past the fort, cheered and saluted our\r\nflag, which was dipped in return, after which she returned to the\r\ncity.\" He then adds: \"The tide had turned. Union men avowed\r\nthemselves, the stars and stripes were again unfurled, and order was\r\nrestored. Although after this time arrests were made of persons\r\nconspicuous for disloyalty, the return to reason was almost as sudden\r\nas the outbreak of rebellion. The railroads were repaired, trains ran\r\nregularly, and troops poured into Washington without hindrance or\r\nopposition of any sort. Thousands of men volunteered for the Union\r\nArmy. Four regiments of Maryland troops afterwards served with me, and\r\nconstituted the Third Brigade of my division. They fought gallantly\r\nthe battles of the Union, and no braver soldiers ever marched under\r\nthe flag.\"\r\n\r\nThe tide indeed soon turned, but not quite so rapidly as this\r\nstatement seems to indicate. On the 5th of May, General Butler, with\r\ntwo regiments and a battery of artillery, came from Washington and\r\ntook possession of the Relay House on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad\r\nat the junction of the Washington branch, about seven miles from\r\nBaltimore, and fortified the position. One of his first proceedings\r\nwas highly characteristic. He issued a special order declaring that he\r\nhad found well-authenticated evidence that one of his soldiers had\r\n\"been poisoned by means of strychnine administered in the food brought\r\ninto the camp,\" and he warned the people of Maryland that he could\r\n\"put an agent, with a word, into every household armed with this\r\nterrible weapon.\" This statement sent a thrill of horror through the\r\nNorth, and the accompanying threat of course excited the indignation\r\nand disgust of our people. The case was carefully examined by the city\r\nphysician, and it turned out that the man had an ordinary attack of\r\ncholera morbus, the consequence of imprudent diet and camp life, but\r\nthe General never thought proper to correct the slander.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 11th of May, General Butler being then at\r\nAnnapolis, I received a note from Edward G. Parker, his aide-de-camp,\r\nstating that he had received intimations from many sources that an\r\nattack by the Baltimore roughs was intended that night; that these\r\nrumors had been confirmed by a gentleman from Baltimore, who gave his\r\nname and residence; that the attack would be made by more than a\r\nthousand men, every one sworn to kill a man; that they were coming in\r\nwagons, on horses and on foot, and that a considerable force from the\r\nwest, probably the Point of Rocks in Maryland, was also expected, and\r\nI was requested to guard every avenue from the city, so as to prevent\r\nthe Baltimore rioters from leaving town.\r\n\r\nOut of respect to the source from which the application came, I\r\nimmediately sent for the marshal of police, and requested him to throw\r\nout bodies of his men so as to guard every avenue leading to the Relay\r\nHouse. No enemy, however, appeared. The threatened attack proved to be\r\nmerely a groundless alarm, as I knew from the beginning it was.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 13th of May, when the city was as peaceful as it\r\nis to-day, General Butler, in the midst of a thunderstorm of unusual\r\nviolence, entered Baltimore and took possession of Federal Hill, which\r\noverlooks the harbor and commands the city, and which he immediately\r\nproceeded to fortify. There was nobody to oppose him, and nobody\r\nthought of doing so; but, for this exploit, which he regarded as the\r\ncapture of Baltimore, he was made a Major-General. He immediately\r\nissued a proclamation, as if he were in a conquered city subject to\r\nmilitary law.\r\n\r\nMeantime, on the 26th of April, the General Assembly of the State had\r\nmet at Frederick. \"As soon as the General Assembly met\" (Scharf's\r\nHistory of Maryland, Vol. III, p. 444), \"the Hon. James M. Mason,\r\nformerly United States Senator from Virginia, waited on it as\r\ncommissioner from that State, authorized to negotiate a treaty of\r\nalliance offensive and defensive with Maryland on her behalf.\" This\r\nproposition met with no acceptance. On the 27th, the Senate, by a\r\nunanimous vote, issued an address for the purpose of allaying the\r\napprehensions of the people, declaring that it had no constitutional\r\nauthority to take any action leading to secession, and on the next day\r\nthe House of Delegates, by a vote of 53 to 12, made a similar\r\ndeclaration. Early in May, the General Assembly, by a vote in the\r\nHouse of 43 to 12, and in the Senate of 11 to 3, passed a series of\r\nresolutions proclaiming its position in the existing crisis.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions protested against the war as unjust and\r\nunconstitutional, and announced a determination to take no part in its\r\nprosecution. They expressed a desire for the immediate recognition of\r\nthe Confederate States; and while they protested against the military\r\noccupation of the State, and the arbitrary restrictions and\r\nillegalities with which it was attended, they called on all good\r\ncitizens to abstain from violent and unlawful interference with the\r\ntroops, and patiently and peacefully to leave to time and reason the\r\nultimate and certain re-establishment and vindication of the right;\r\nand they declared it to be at that time inexpedient to call a\r\nSovereign Convention of the State, or to take any measures for the\r\nimmediate organization or arming of the militia.\r\n\r\nAfter it became plain that no movement would be made towards\r\nsecession, a large number of young men, including not a few of the\r\nflower of the State, and representing largely the more wealthy and\r\nprominent families, escaped across the border and entered the ranks of\r\nthe Confederacy. The number has been estimated at as many as twenty\r\nthousand, but this, perhaps, is too large a figure, and there are no\r\nmeans of ascertaining the truth. The muster-rolls have perished with\r\nthe Confederacy. The great body of those who sympathized with the\r\nSouth had no disposition to take arms against the Union so long as\r\nMaryland remained a member of it. This was subsequently proved by\r\ntheir failure to enlist in the Southern armies on the different\r\noccasions in 1862, 1863 and 1864 when they crossed the Potomac and\r\ntransferred the seat of war to Maryland and Pennsylvania, under the\r\ncommand twice of General Lee and once of General Early.\r\n\r\nThe first of these campaigns ended in the bloody battle of Antietam.\r\nThe Maryland men, as a tribute to their good conduct, were placed at\r\nthe head of the army, and crossed the river with enthusiasm, the band\r\nplaying and the soldiers singing \"My Maryland.\" Great was their\r\ndisappointment that the recruits did not even suffice to fill the gaps\r\nin their shattered ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n     CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY AND THE WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS. -- A UNION\r\n     CONVENTION. -- CONSEQUENCE OF THE SUSPENSION OF THE WRIT. --\r\n     INCIDENTS OF THE WAR. -- THE WOMEN IN THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe suspension of the writ of _habeas corpus_, by order of the\r\nPresident, without the sanction of an Act of Congress, which had not\r\nthen been given, was one of the memorable events of the war.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of May, 1861, Judge Giles, of the United States District\r\nCourt of Maryland, issued a writ of _habeas corpus_ to Major Morris,\r\nthen in command of Fort McHenry, to discharge a soldier who was under\r\nage. Major Morris refused to obey the writ.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of May the General Assembly adjourned, and Mr. Ross\r\nWinans, of Baltimore, a member of the House of Delegates, while\r\nreturning to his home, was arrested by General Butler on a charge of\r\nhigh treason. He was conveyed to Annapolis, and subsequently to Fort\r\nMcHenry, and was soon afterwards released.\r\n\r\nA case of the highest importance next followed. On the 25th of May,\r\nMr. John Merryman, of Baltimore County, was arrested by order of\r\nGeneral Keim, of Pennsylvania, and confined in Fort McHenry. The next\r\nday (Sunday, May 26th) his counsel, Messrs. George M. Gill and George\r\nH. Williams, presented a petition for the writ of _habeas corpus_ to\r\nChief Justice Taney, who issued the writ immediately, directed to\r\nGeneral Cadwallader, then in command in Maryland, ordering him to\r\nproduce the body of Merryman in court on the following day (Monday,\r\nMay 27th). On that day Colonel Lee, his aide-de-camp, came into court\r\nwith a letter from General Cadwallader, directed to the Chief Justice,\r\nstating that Mr. Merryman had been arrested on charges of high\r\ntreason, and that he (the General) was authorized by the President of\r\nthe United States in such cases to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_\r\nfor the public safety. Judge Taney asked Colonel Lee if he had brought\r\nwith him the body of John Merryman. Colonel Lee replied that he had no\r\ninstructions except to deliver the letter.\r\n\r\n     _Chief Justice._--The commanding officer, then, declines to obey\r\n     the writ?\r\n\r\n     _Colonel Lee._--After making that communication my duty is ended,\r\n     and I have no further power (rising and retiring).\r\n\r\n     _Chief Justice._--The Court orders an attachment to issue against\r\n     George Cadwallader for disobedience to the high writ of the\r\n     Court, returnable at twelve o'clock to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe order was accordingly issued as directed.\r\n\r\nA startling issue was thus presented. The venerable Chief Justice had\r\ncome from Washington to Baltimore for the purpose of issuing a writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_, and the President had thereupon authorized the\r\ncommander of the fort to hold the prisoner and disregard the writ.\r\n\r\nA more important occasion could hardly have occurred. Where did the\r\nPresident of the United States acquire such a power? Was it true that\r\na citizen held his liberty subject to the arbitrary will of any man?\r\nIn what part of the Constitution could such a power be found? Why had\r\nit never been discovered before? What precedent existed for such an\r\nact?\r\n\r\nJudge Taney was greatly venerated in Baltimore, where he had formerly\r\nlived. The case created a profound sensation.\r\n\r\nOn the next morning the Chief Justice, leaning on the arm of his\r\ngrandson, walked slowly through the crowd which had gathered in front\r\nof the court-house, and the crowd silently and with lifted hats opened\r\nthe way for him to pass.\r\n\r\nRoger B. Taney was one of the most self-controlled and courageous of\r\njudges. He took his seat with his usual quiet dignity. He called the\r\ncase of John Merryman and asked the marshal for his return to the writ\r\nof attachment. The return stated that he had gone to Fort McHenry for\r\nthe purpose of serving the writ on General Cadwallader; that he had\r\nsent in his name at the outer gate; that the messenger had returned\r\nwith the reply that there was no answer to send; that he was not\r\npermitted to enter the gate, and, therefore, could not serve the writ,\r\nas he was commanded to do.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice then read from his manuscript as follows:\r\n\r\n     I ordered the attachment of yesterday because upon the face of\r\n     the return the detention of the prisoner was unlawful upon two\r\n     grounds:\r\n\r\n     1st. The President, under the Constitution and laws of the United\r\n     States, cannot suspend the privilege of the writ of _habeas\r\n     corpus_, nor authorize any military officer to do so.\r\n\r\n     2d. A military officer has no right to arrest and detain a person\r\n     not subject to the rules and articles of war, for an offense\r\n     against the laws of the United States, except in aid of the\r\n     judicial authority and subject to its control; and if the party\r\n     is arrested by the military, it is the duty of the officer to\r\n     deliver him over immediately to the civil authority, to be dealt\r\n     with according to law.\r\n\r\n     I forbore yesterday to state the provisions of the Constitution\r\n     of the United States which make these principles the fundamental\r\n     law of the Union, because an oral statement might be\r\n     misunderstood in some portions of it, and I shall therefore put\r\n     my opinion in writing, and file it in the office of the clerk of\r\n     this court, in the course of this week.\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice then orally remarked:\r\n\r\n     In relation to the present return, it is proper to say that of\r\n     course the marshal has legally the power to summon the _posse\r\n     comitatus_ to seize and bring into court the party named in the\r\n     attachment; but it is apparent he will be resisted in the\r\n     discharge of that duty by a force notoriously superior to the\r\n     _posse_, and, this being the case, such a proceeding can result\r\n     in no good, and is useless. I will not, therefore, require the\r\n     marshal to perform this duty. If, however, General Cadwallader\r\n     were before me, I should impose on him the punishment which it is\r\n     my province to inflict--that of fine and imprisonment. I shall\r\n     merely say, to-day, that I shall reduce to writing the reasons\r\n     under which I have acted, and which have led me to the\r\n     conclusions expressed in my opinion, and shall direct the clerk\r\n     to forward them with these proceedings to the President, so that\r\n     he may discharge his constitutional duty \"to take care that the\r\n     laws are faithfully executed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is due to my readers that they should have an opportunity of\r\nreading this opinion, and it is accordingly inserted in an Appendix.\r\n\r\nAfter the court had adjourned, I went up to the bench and thanked\r\nJudge Taney for thus upholding, in its integrity, the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_. He replied, \"Mr. Brown, I am an old man, a very old man\" (he\r\nhad completed his eighty-fourth year), \"but perhaps I was preserved\r\nfor this occasion.\" I replied, \"Sir, I thank God that you were.\"\r\n\r\nHe then told me that he knew that his own imprisonment had been a\r\nmatter of consultation, but that the danger had passed, and he warned\r\nme, from information he had received, that my time would come.\r\n\r\nThe charges against Merryman were discovered to be unfounded and he\r\nwas soon discharged by military authority.\r\n\r\nThe nation is now tired of war, and rests in the enjoyment of a\r\nharmony which has not been equalled since the days of James Monroe.\r\nWhen Judge Taney rendered this decision the Constitution was only\r\nseventy-two years old--twelve years younger than himself. It is now\r\nless than one hundred years old--a short period in a nation's\r\nlife--and yet during that period there have been serious\r\ncommotions--two foreign wars and a civil war. In the future, as in the\r\npast, offenses will come, and hostile parties and factions will arise,\r\nand the men who wield power will, if they dare, shut up in fort or\r\nprison, without reach of relief, those whom they regard as dangerous\r\nenemies. When that period arrives, then will those who wisely love\r\ntheir country thank the great Chief Justice, as I did, for his\r\nunflinching defense of _habeas corpus_, the supreme writ of right, and\r\nthe corner-stone of personal liberty among all English-speaking\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nIn the Life of Benjamin R. Curtis, Vol. I, p. 240, his biographer\r\nsays, speaking of Chief Justice Taney, with reference to the case of\r\nMerryman, \"If he had never done anything else that was high, heroic\r\nand important, his noble vindication of the writ of _habeas corpus_\r\nand the dignity and authority of his office against a rash minister of\r\nState, who, in the pride of a fancied executive power, came near to\r\nthe commission of a great crime, will command the admiration and\r\ngratitude of every lover of constitutional liberty so long as our\r\ninstitutions shall endure.\" The crime referred to was the intended\r\nimprisonment of the Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nAlthough this crime was not committed, a criminal precedent had been\r\nset and was ruthlessly followed. \"My lord,\" said Mr. Seward to Lord\r\nLyons, \"I can touch a bell on my right hand and order the imprisonment\r\nof a citizen of Ohio; I can touch a bell again and order the\r\nimprisonment of a citizen of New York; and no power on earth, except\r\nthat of the President, can release them. Can the Queen of England do\r\nso much?\" When such a power is wielded by any man, or set of men,\r\nnothing is left to protect the liberty of the citizen.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of May, a Union Convention, consisting of fourteen\r\ncounties of the State, including the city of Baltimore, and leaving\r\neight unrepresented, met in the city. The counties not represented\r\nwere Washington, Montgomery, Prince George, Charles, St. Mary's,\r\nDorchester, Somerset, and Worcester. The number of members does not\r\nappear to have been large, but it included the names of gentlemen well\r\nknown and highly respected. The Convention adopted Resolutions which\r\ndeclared, among other things, that the revolution on the part of\r\neleven States was without excuse or palliation, and that the redress\r\nof actual or supposed wrongs in connection with the slavery question\r\nformed no part of their views or purposes; that the people of this\r\nState were unalterably determined to defend the Government of the\r\nUnited States, and would support the Government in all legal and\r\nconstitutional measures which might be necessary to resist the\r\nrevolutionists; that the intimations made by the majority of the\r\nLegislature at its late session--that the people were humiliated or\r\nsubjugated by the action of the Government--were gratuitous insults to\r\nthat people; that the dignity of the State of Maryland, involved in a\r\nprecise, persistent and effective recognition of all her rights,\r\nprivileges and immunities under the Constitution of the United States,\r\nwill be vindicated at all times and under all circumstances by those\r\nof her sons who are sincere in their fealty to her and the Government\r\nof the Union of which she is part, and to popular constitutional\r\nliberty; that while they concurred with the present Executive of the\r\nUnited States that the unity and integrity of the National Union must\r\nbe preserved, their view of the nature and true principles of the\r\nConstitution, of the powers which it confers, and of the duties which\r\nit enjoins, and the rights which it secures, as it relates to and\r\naffects the question of slavery in many of the essential bearings, is\r\ndirectly opposed to the views of the Executive; that they are fixed in\r\ntheir conviction, amongst others, that a just comprehension of the\r\ntrue principles of the Constitution forbid utterly the formation of\r\npolitical parties on the foundation of the slavery question, and that\r\nthe Union men will oppose to the utmost of their ability all attempts\r\nof the Federal Executive to commingle in any manner its peculiar views\r\non the slavery question with that of maintaining the just powers of\r\nthe Government.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions are important as showing the stand taken by a large\r\nportion of the Union party of the State in regard to any interference,\r\nas the result of the war or otherwise, by the General Government with\r\nthe provisions of the Constitution with regard to slavery.\r\n\r\nAfter the writ of _habeas corpus_ had been thus suspended, martial\r\nlaw, as a consequence, rapidly became all-powerful, and it continued\r\nin force during the war. That law is by Judge Black, in his argument\r\nbefore the Supreme Court in the case of _ex parte_ Milligan,[14] shown\r\nto be simply the rule of irresponsible force. Law becomes helpless\r\nbefore it. _Inter arma silent leges._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: 4 Wallace Sup. Court R. 2.]\r\n\r\nOn May 25, 1862, Judge Carmichael, an honored magistrate, while\r\nsitting in his court in Easton, was, by the provost marshal and his\r\ndeputies, assisted by a body of military sent from Baltimore, beaten,\r\nand dragged bleeding from the bench, and then imprisoned, because he\r\nhad on a previous occasion delivered a charge to the grand jury\r\ndirecting them to inquire into certain illegal acts and to indict the\r\noffenders. His imprisonment in Forts McHenry, Lafayette, and Delaware,\r\nlasted more than six months. On December 4, 1862, he was\r\nunconditionally released, no trial having been granted him, nor any\r\ncharges made against him. On June 28, 1862, Judge Bartol, of the Court\r\nof Appeals of Maryland, was arrested and confined in Fort McHenry. He\r\nwas released after a few days, without any charge being preferred\r\nagainst him, or any explanation given.\r\n\r\nSpies and informers abounded. A rigid supervision was established.\r\nDisloyalty, so called, of any kind was a punishable offense. Rebel\r\ncolors, the red and white, were prohibited. They were not allowed to\r\nappear in shop-windows or on children's garments, or anywhere that\r\nmight offend the Union sentiment. If a newspaper promulgated disloyal\r\nsentiments, the paper was suppressed and the editor imprisoned. If a\r\nclergyman was disloyal in prayer or sermon, or if he failed to utter a\r\nprescribed prayer, he was liable to be treated in the same manner, and\r\nwas sometimes so treated. A learned and eloquent Lutheran clergyman\r\ncame to me for advice because he had been summoned before the provost\r\nmarshal for saying that a nation which incurred a heavy debt in the\r\nprosecution of war laid violent hands on the harvests of the future;\r\nbut his offense was condoned, because it appeared that he had referred\r\nto the \"Thirty Years' War\" and had made no direct reference to the\r\ndebt of the United States, and perhaps for a better reason--that he\r\nhad strong Republican friends among his congregation.\r\n\r\nIf horses and fodder, fences and timber, or houses and land, were\r\ntaken for the use of the Army, the owner was not entitled to\r\ncompensation unless he could prove that he was a loyal man; and the\r\nproof was required to be furnished through some well-known loyal\r\nperson, who, of course, was usually paid for his services. Very soon\r\nno one was allowed to vote unless he was a loyal man, and soldiers at\r\nthe polls assisted in settling the question of loyalty.\r\n\r\nNearly all who approved of the war regarded these things as an\r\ninevitable military necessity; but those who disapproved deeply\r\nresented them as unwarrantable violations of sacred constitutional\r\nrights. The consequence was that friendships were dissolved, the ties\r\nof blood severed, and an invisible but well-understood line divided\r\nthe people. The bitterness and even the common mention of these acts\r\nhave long since ceased, but the tradition survives and still continues\r\nto be a factor, silent, but not without influence, in the politics of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nHistory repeats itself. There were deeds done on both sides which\r\nbring to mind the wars of England and Scotland and the border strife\r\nbetween those countries. There were flittings to and fro, and\r\nadventures and hairbreadth escapes innumerable. Soldiers returned to\r\nvisit their homes at the risk of their necks. Contraband of every\r\ndescription, and letters and newspapers, found their way across the\r\nborder. The military lines were long and tortuous, and vulnerable\r\npoints were not hard to find, and trusty carriers were ready to go\r\nanywhere for the love of adventure or the love of gain.\r\n\r\nThe women were as deeply interested as the men, and were less\r\napprehensive of personal consequences. In different parts of the city,\r\nnot excepting its stateliest square, where stands the marble column\r\nfrom which the father of his country looked down, sadly as it were, on\r\na divided people, there might have been found, by the initiated,\r\ngroups of women who, with swift and skillful fingers, were fashioning\r\nand making garments strangely various in shape and kind--some for\r\nNorthern prisons where captives were confined, some for destitute\r\nhomes beyond the Southern border, in which only women and children\r\nwere left, and some for Southern camps where ragged soldiers were\r\nwaiting to be clad. The work was carried on not without its risks;\r\nbut little cared the workers for that. Perhaps the sensation of danger\r\nitself, and a spirit of resistance to an authority which they refused\r\nto recognize, gave zest to their toil; nor did they always think it\r\nnecessary to inform the good man of the house in which they were\r\nassembled either of their presence or of what was going on beneath his\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nThe women who stood by the cause of the Union were not compelled to\r\nhide their charitable deeds from the light of day. No need for them to\r\nfeed and clothe the soldiers of the Union, whose wants were amply\r\nsupplied by a bountiful Government; but with untiring zeal they\r\nvisited the military hospitals on missions of mercy, and when the\r\nbloody fields of Antietam and Gettysburg were fought, both they and\r\ntheir Southern sisters hastened, though not with a common purpose, to\r\nthe aid of the wounded and dying, the victims of civil strife and\r\nchildren of a common country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n     GENERAL BANKS IN COMMAND. -- MARSHAL KANE ARRESTED. -- POLICE\r\n     COMMISSIONERS SUPERSEDED. -- RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE GENERAL\r\n     ASSEMBLY. -- POLICE COMMISSIONERS ARRESTED. -- MEMORIAL ADDRESSED\r\n     BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL TO CONGRESS. -- GENERAL DIX IN\r\n     COMMAND. -- ARREST OF MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY, THE MAYOR\r\n     AND OTHERS. -- RELEASE OF PRISONERS. -- COLONEL DIMICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of June, 1861, Major-General Nathaniel P. Banks, of\r\nMassachusetts, was appointed in the place of General Cadwallader to\r\nthe command of the Department of Annapolis, with headquarters at\r\nBaltimore. On the 27th of June, General Banks arrested Marshal Kane\r\nand confined him in Fort McHenry. He then issued a proclamation\r\nannouncing that he had superseded Marshal Kane and the commissioners\r\nof police, and that he had appointed Colonel John R. Kenly, of the\r\nFirst Regiment of Maryland Volunteers, provost marshal, with the aid\r\nand assistance of the subordinate officers of the police department.\r\n\r\nThe police commissioners, including the mayor, offered no resistance,\r\nbut adopted and published a resolution declaring that, in the opinion\r\nof the board, the forcible suspension of their functions suspended at\r\nthe same time the active operation of the police law and put the\r\nofficers and men off duty for the present, leaving them subject,\r\nhowever, to the rules and regulations of the service as to their\r\npersonal conduct and deportment, and to the orders which the board\r\nmight see fit thereafter to issue, when the present illegal\r\nsuspension of their functions should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Maryland, at its adjourned session on the 22d of\r\nJune, passed a series of resolutions declaring that the\r\nunconstitutional and arbitrary proceedings of the Federal Executive\r\nhad not been confined to the violation of the personal rights and\r\nliberties of the citizens of Maryland, but had been so extended that\r\nthe property of no man was safe, the sanctity of no dwelling was\r\nrespected, and that the sacredness of private correspondence no longer\r\nexisted; that the Senate and House of Delegates of Maryland felt it\r\ndue to her dignity and independence that history should not record the\r\noverthrow of public freedom for an instant within her borders, without\r\nrecording likewise the indignant expression of her resentment and\r\nremonstrance, and they accordingly protested against the oppressive\r\nand tyrannical assertion and exercise of military jurisdiction within\r\nthe limits of Maryland over the persons and property of her citizens\r\nby the Government of the United States, and solemnly declared the same\r\nto be subversive of the most sacred guarantees of the Constitution,\r\nand in flagrant violation of the fundamental and most cherished\r\nprinciples of American free government.\r\n\r\nOn the first of July, the police commissioners were arrested and\r\nimprisoned by order of General Banks, on the ground, as he alleged in\r\na proclamation, that the commissioners had refused to obey his\r\ndecrees, or to recognize his appointees, and that they continued to\r\nhold the police force for some purpose not known to the Government.\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks does not say what authority he had to make decrees, or\r\nwhat the decrees were which the commissioners had refused to obey; and\r\nas on the 27th of June he had imprisoned the marshal of police, and\r\nhad put a provost marshal in his place, retaining only the subordinate\r\nofficers of the police department, and had appointed instead of the\r\nmen another body of police, all under the control of the provost\r\nmarshal; and as the commissioners had no right to discharge the police\r\nforce established by a law of the State, and were left with no duties\r\nin relation to the police which they could perform, it is very plain\r\nthat, whatever motive General Banks may have had for the arrest and\r\nimprisonment of the commissioners, it is not stated in his\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nOne of the commissioners, Charles D. Hinks, was soon released in\r\nconsequence of failing health.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the arrest of the police commissioners the city was\r\noccupied by troops, who in large detachments, infantry and artillery,\r\ntook up positions in Monument Square, Exchange Place, at Camden-street\r\nStation and other points, and they mounted guard and bivouacked in the\r\nstreets for more than a week.\r\n\r\nOn July 18th, the police commissioners presented to Congress a\r\nmemorial in which they protested very vigorously against their\r\nunlawful arrest and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d day of July, 1861, the mayor and city council of Baltimore\r\naddressed a memorial to the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\nUnited States, in which, after describing the condition of affairs in\r\nBaltimore, they respectfully, yet most earnestly, demanded, as matter\r\nof right, that their city might be governed according to the\r\nConstitution and laws of the United States and of the State of\r\nMaryland, that the citizens might be secure in their persons, houses,\r\npapers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures; that\r\nthey should not be deprived of life, liberty or property without due\r\nprocess of law; that the military should render obedience to the\r\ncivil authority; that the municipal laws should be respected, the\r\nofficers released from imprisonment and restored to the lawful\r\nexercise of their functions, and that the police government\r\nestablished by law should be no longer impeded by armed force to the\r\ninjury of peace and order. It is perhaps needless to add that the\r\nmemorial met with no favor.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of August, 1861, the Legislature of the State, in a series\r\nof resolutions, denounced these proceedings in all their parts,\r\npronouncing them, so far as they affected individuals, a gross and\r\nunconstitutional abuse of power which nothing could palliate or\r\nexcuse, and, in their bearing upon the authority and constitutional\r\npowers and privileges of the State herself, a revolutionary subversion\r\nof the Federal compact.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature then adjourned, to meet on the 17th of September.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of July, 1861, General Dix had been placed in command of\r\nthe Department, with his headquarters in Baltimore. On that day he\r\nwrote from Fort McHenry to the Assistant Adjutant-General for\r\nre-enforcement of the troops under his command. He said that there\r\nought to be ten thousand men at Baltimore and Annapolis, and that he\r\ncould not venture to respond for the quietude of the Department with a\r\nsmaller number. At Fort McHenry, as told by his biographer, he\r\nexhibited to some ladies of secession proclivities an immense\r\ncolumbiad, and informed them that it was pointed to Monument Square,\r\nand if there was an uprising that this piece would be the first he\r\nwould fire. But the guns of Fort McHenry were not sufficient. He built\r\non the east of the city a very strong work, which he called Fort\r\nMarshall, and he strengthened the earthwork on Federal Hill, in the\r\nsouthern part, so that the city lay under the guns of three powerful\r\nforts, with several smaller ones. Not satisfied with this, on the 15th\r\nof September, 1862, General Dix, after he had been transferred to\r\nanother department, wrote to Major-General Halleck, then\r\nCommander-in-Chief, advising that the ground on which the earthwork on\r\nFederal Hill had been erected should be purchased at a cost of one\r\nhundred thousand dollars, and that it should be permanently fortified\r\nat an additional expense of $250,000. He was of opinion that although\r\nthe great body of the people were, as he described them, eminently\r\ndistinguished for their moral virtues, Baltimore had always contained\r\na mass of inflammable material, which would ignite on the slightest\r\nprovocation. He added that \"Fort Federal Hill completely commanded the\r\ncity, and is capable, from its proximity to the principal business\r\nquarters, of assailing any one without injury to the others. The hill\r\nseems to have been placed there by Nature as a site for a permanent\r\ncitadel, and I beg to suggest whether a neglect to appropriate it to\r\nits obvious design would not be an unpardonable dereliction of duty.\"\r\n\r\nThese views were perhaps extreme even for a major-general commanding\r\nin Baltimore, especially as by this time the disorderly element which\r\ninfests all cities had gone over to the stronger side, and was engaged\r\nin the pious work of persecuting rebels. General Halleck, even after\r\nthis solemn warning, left Federal Hill to the protection of its\r\nearthwork.\r\n\r\nThe opinion which General Dix had of Baltimore extended, though in a\r\nless degree, to a large portion of the State, and was shared, in part\r\nat least, not only by the other military commanders, but by the\r\nGovernment at Washington.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of September, 1861, Simon Cameron, Secretary of War,\r\nwrote the following letter to Major-General Banks, who was at this\r\ntime in command of a division in Maryland:\r\n\r\n                                \"WAR DEPARTMENT, _September 11, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"_General._--The passage of any act of secession by the\r\n     Legislature of Maryland must be prevented. If necessary, all or\r\n     any part of the members must be arrested. Exercise your own\r\n     judgment as to the time and manner, but do the work effectively.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of September, Major-General McClellan, Commander-in-Chief\r\nof the Army of the Potomac, wrote a confidential letter to General\r\nBanks reciting that \"after full consultation with the President,\r\nSecretary of State, War, etc., it has been decided to effect the\r\noperation proposed for the 17th.\" The 17th was the day fixed for the\r\nmeeting of the General Assembly, and the operation to be performed was\r\nthe arrest of some thirty members of that body, and other persons\r\nbesides. Arrangements had been made to have a Government steamer at\r\nAnnapolis to receive the prisoners and convey them to their\r\ndestination. The plan was to be arranged with General Dix and Governor\r\nSeward, and the letter closes with leaving this exceedingly important\r\naffair to the tact and discretion of General Banks, and impressing on\r\nhim the absolute necessity of secrecy and success.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, a number of the most prominent members of the\r\nLegislature, myself, as mayor of Baltimore, and editors of newspapers,\r\nand other citizens, were arrested at midnight. I was arrested at my\r\ncountry home, near the Relay House on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,\r\nby four policemen and a guard of soldiers. The soldiers were placed in\r\nboth front and rear of the house, while the police rapped violently on\r\nthe front door. I had gone to bed, but was still awake, for I had some\r\napprehension of danger. I immediately arose, and opening my bed-room\r\nwindow, asked the intruders what they wanted. They replied that they\r\nwanted Mayor Brown. I asked who wanted him, and they answered, the\r\nGovernment of the United States. I then inquired for their warrant,\r\nbut they had none. After a short time spent in preparation I took\r\nleave of my wife and children, and closely guarded, walked down the\r\nhigh hill on which the house stands to the foot, where a carriage was\r\nwaiting for me. The soldiers went no farther, but I was driven in\r\ncharge of the police seven miles to Baltimore and through the city to\r\nFort McHenry, where to my surprise I found myself a fellow-prisoner in\r\na company of friends and well-known citizens. We were imprisoned for\r\none night in Fort McHenry, next in Fort Monroe for about two weeks,\r\nnext in Fort Lafayette for about six weeks, and finally in Fort\r\nWarren. Henry May, member of Congress from Baltimore, was arrested at\r\nthe same time, but was soon released.\r\n\r\nCol. Scharf, in his \"History of Maryland,\" Volume III, says: \"It was\r\noriginally intended that they (the prisoners) should be confined in\r\nthe fort at the Dry Tortugas, but as there was no fit steamer in\r\nHampton Roads to make the voyage, the programme was changed.\"[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: See also the \"Chronicles of Baltimore\" by the same\r\nauthor.]\r\n\r\nThe apprehension that the Legislature intended to pass an act of\r\nsecession, as intimated by Secretary Cameron, was, in view of the\r\nposition in which the State was placed, and the whole condition of\r\naffairs, so absurd that it is difficult to believe that he seriously\r\nentertained it. The blow was no doubt, however, intended to strike\r\nwith terror the opponents of the war, and was one of the effective\r\nmeans resorted to by the Government to obtain, as it soon did, entire\r\ncontrol of the State.\r\n\r\nAs the events of the 19th of April had occurred nearly five months\r\npreviously, and I was endeavoring to perform my duties as mayor, in\r\nobedience to law, without giving offense to either the civil or\r\nmilitary authorities of the Government, the only apparent reason for\r\nmy arrest grew out of a difficulty in regard to the payment of the\r\npolice appointed by General Banks. In July a law had been passed by\r\nCongress appropriating one hundred thousand dollars for the purpose of\r\nsuch payment, but it was plain that a similar expenditure would not\r\nlong be tolerated by Congress. In this emergency an intimation came to\r\nme indirectly from Secretary Seward, through a common acquaintance,\r\nthat I was expected to pay the Government police out of the funds\r\nappropriated by law for the city police. I replied that any such\r\npayment would be illegal and was not within my power.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards I received the following letter from General Dix,\r\nwhich I insert, together with the correspondence which followed:\r\n\r\n               \"HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF PENNSYLVANIA,\r\n                                 \"BALTIMORE, MD., _September 8, 1861_.\r\n\r\n     \"TO HON. GEO. WM. BROWN, _Mayor of the City of Baltimore_.\r\n\r\n     \"_Sir_:--Reasons of state, which I deem imperative, demand that\r\n     the payment of compensation to the members of the old city\r\n     police, who were, by a resolution of the Board of Police\r\n     Commissioners, dated the 27th of Jane last, declared 'off duty,'\r\n     and whose places were filled in pursuance of an order of\r\n     Major-General Banks of the same date, should cease. I therefore\r\n     direct, by virtue of the authority vested in me as commanding\r\n     officer of the military forces of the United States in Baltimore\r\n     and its vicinity, that no further payment be made to them.\r\n\r\n     \"Independently of all other considerations, the continued\r\n     compensation of a body of men who have been suspended in their\r\n     functions by the order of the Government, is calculated to bring\r\n     its authority into disrespect; and the extraction from the\r\n     citizens of Baltimore by taxation, in a time of general\r\n     depression and embarrassment, of a sum amounting to several\r\n     hundred thousand dollars a year for the payment of nominal\r\n     officials who render it no service, cannot fail by creating\r\n     widespread dissatisfaction to disturb the quietude of the city,\r\n     which I am most anxious to preserve.\r\n\r\n     \"I feel assured that the payment would have been voluntarily\r\n     discontinued by yourself, as a violation of the principle on\r\n     which all compensation is bestowed--as a remuneration for an\r\n     equivalent service actually performed--had you not considered\r\n     yourself bound by existing laws to make it.\r\n\r\n     \"This order will relieve you from the embarrassment, and I do not\r\n     doubt that it will be complied with.\r\n\r\n     \"I am, very respectfully,\r\n                            \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                         \"JOHN A.

It had been left at the mayor's office yesterday morning.\r\n\r\n     \"Before leaving the mayor's office, about three o'clock P. M. on\r\n     the 9th instant, and not having received any reply from you, I\r\n     had signed a check for the payment of arrears due the police, and\r\n     the money was on the same day drawn out of the bank and handed\r\n     over to the proper officers, and nearly the entire amount was by\r\n     them paid to the police force before the receipt of your letter.\r\n\r\n     \"The suggestion in your letter as to the 'violation of a\r\n     principle' requires me to add that I recognize in the action of\r\n     the Government of the United States in the matter in question\r\n     nothing but the assertion of superior force.\r\n\r\n     \"Out of regard to the great interests committed to my charge as\r\n     chief magistrate of the city, I have yielded to that force, and\r\n     do not feel it necessary to enter into any discussion of the\r\n     principles upon which the Government sees fit to exercise it.\r\n\r\n     \"Very respectfully,\r\n                       \"Your obedient servant,\r\n                                                      \"GEO. WM. BROWN,\r\n                                                            \"_Mayor_.\"\r\n\r\nThe reasons which General Dix assigned for prohibiting me from paying\r\nthe arrearages due the police present a curious combination. First,\r\nthere were reasons of State; next, the respect due to the Government;\r\nthird, his concern for the taxpayers of Baltimore; fourth, the danger\r\nto the quiet of the city which he apprehended might arise from the\r\npayment; and, finally, there was a principle which he must protect\r\nfrom violation, but what that principle was he did not state.\r\n\r\nA striking commentary on these reasons was furnished on the 11th of\r\nDecember, 1863, by a decision of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in\r\nthe case of the Mayor, etc., of Baltimore _vs._ Charles Howard and\r\nothers, reported in 20th Maryland Rep., p. 335. The question was\r\nwhether the interference by the Government of the United States with\r\nthe Board of Police and police force established by law in the city of\r\nBaltimore was without authority of law and did in any manner affect or\r\nimpair the rights or invalidate the acts of the board. The court held\r\nthat, though the board was displaced by a force to which they yielded\r\nand could not resist, their power and rights under their organization\r\nwere still preserved, and that they were amenable for any dereliction\r\nof official duty, except in so far as they were excused by\r\nuncontrollable events. And the court decided that Mr. Hinks, one of\r\nthe police commissioners, whose case was alone before the court, was\r\nentitled to his salary, which had accrued after the board was so\r\ndisplaced.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, after the close of the war, the Legislature of the State\r\npassed an act for the payment of all arrearages due to the men of the\r\npolice subsequent to their displacement by the Government of the\r\nUnited States and until their discharge by the Government of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that General Dix delayed replying to my letter of\r\nthe 5th of September until the 9th; that his reply was not left at the\r\nmayor's office until the tenth, and that in the meantime, on the\r\nafternoon of the 9th, after waiting for his reply for four days, I\r\npaid the arrears due the police, as I had good reason to suppose he\r\nintended I should.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, a lawyer of Baltimore, and a pronounced Union man,\r\nhas, since then, informed me that General Dix showed him my letter of\r\nthe 5th before my arrest; that my friend asked him whether he had\r\nreplied to it, and the General replied he had not. My friend answered\r\nthat he thought a reply was due to me. From all this it does not seem\r\nuncharitable to believe that the purpose of General Dix was to put me\r\nin the false position of appearing to disobey his order and thus to\r\nfurnish an excuse for my imprisonment. This lasted until the 27th of\r\nNovember, 1862, a short time after my term of office had expired, when\r\nthere was a sudden and unexpected release of all the State prisoners\r\nin Fort Warren, where we were then confined.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November, 1862, Colonel Justin Dimick, commanding at\r\nFort Warren, received the following telegraphic order from the\r\nAdjutant-General's Office, Washington: \"The Secretary of War directs\r\nthat you release all the Maryland State prisoners, also any other\r\nState prisoners that may be in your custody, and report to this\r\noffice.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this order, Colonel Dimick on the following day\r\nreleased from Fort Warren the following State prisoners, without\r\nimposing any condition upon them whatever: Severn Teackle Wallis,\r\nHenry M. Warfield, William G. Harrison, T. Parkin Scott, ex-members of\r\nthe Maryland Legislature from Baltimore; George William Brown,\r\nex-Mayor of Baltimore; Charles Howard and William H. Gatchell,\r\nex-Police Commissioners; George P. Kane, ex-Marshal of Police; Frank\r\nKey Howard, one of the editors of the Baltimore _Exchange_; Thomas W.\r\nHall, editor of the Baltimore _South_; Robert Hull, merchant, of\r\nBaltimore; Dr. Charles Macgill, of Hagerstown; William H. Winder, of\r\nPhiladelphia; and B. L. Cutter, of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wool, then in command in Baltimore, issued an order declaring\r\nthat thereafter no person should be arrested within the limits of the\r\nDepartment except by his order, and in all such cases the charges\r\nagainst the accused party were to be sworn to before a justice of the\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nAs it was intimated that these gentlemen had entered into some\r\nengagement as the condition of their release, Mr. Wallis, while in New\r\nYork on his return home, took occasion to address a letter on the\r\nsubject to the editor of the New York _World_, in which he said: \"No\r\ncondition whatever was sought to be imposed, and none would have been\r\naccepted, as the Secretary of War well knew. Speaking of my\r\nfellow-prisoners from Maryland, I have a right to say that they\r\nmaintained to the last the principle which they asserted from the\r\nfirst--namely, that, if charged with crime, they were entitled to be\r\ncharged, held and tried in due form of law and not otherwise; and\r\nthat, in the absence of lawful accusation and process, it was their\r\nright to be discharged without terms or conditions of any sort, and\r\nthey would submit to none.\"\r\n\r\nMany of our fellow-prisoners were from necessity not able to take this\r\nstand. There were no charges against them, but there were imperative\r\nduties which required their presence at home, and when the Government\r\nat Washington adopted the policy of offering liberty to those who\r\nwould consent to take an oath of allegiance prepared for the occasion,\r\nthey had been compelled to accept it.\r\n\r\nBefore this, in December, 1861, the Government at Washington, on\r\napplication of friends, had granted me a parole for thirty days, that\r\nI might attend to some important private business, and for that time I\r\nstayed with kind relatives, under the terms of the parole, in Boston.\r\n\r\nThe following correspondence, which then took place, will show the\r\nposition which I maintained:\r\n\r\n                                           \"BOSTON, _January 4, 1862_.\r\n\r\n     \"MARSHAL KEYS, _Boston_.\r\n\r\n     \"_Sir_:--I called twice to see you during this week, and in your\r\n     absence had an understanding with your deputy that I was to\r\n     surrender myself to you this morning, on the expiration of my\r\n     parole, in time to be conveyed to Fort Warren, and I have\r\n     accordingly done so.\r\n\r\n     \"As you have not received any instructions from Washington in\r\n     regard to the course to be pursued with me, I shall consider\r\n     myself in your custody until you have had ample time to write to\r\n     Washington and obtain a reply.\r\n\r\n     \"I desire it, however, to be expressly understood that no further\r\n     extension of my parole is asked for, or would be accepted at this\r\n     time.\r\n\r\n     \"It is my right and my wish to return to Baltimore, to resume the\r\n     performance of my official and private duties.\r\n\r\n     Respectfully,\r\n                                                     \"GEO.

This offer\r\nI declined. My term of office expired on the 12th of November, 1862,\r\nand soon afterwards I was released, as I have just stated.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose to enter into an account of the trials and\r\nhardships of prison-life in the crowded forts in which we were\r\nsuccessively confined under strict and sometimes very harsh military\r\nrule, but it is due to the memory of the commander at Fort Warren,\r\nColonel Justin Dimick, that I should leave on record the warm feelings\r\nof respect and friendship with which he was regarded by the prisoners\r\nwho knew him best, for the unvarying kindness and humanity with which\r\nhe performed the difficult and painful duties of his office. As far as\r\nhe was permitted to do so, he promoted the comfort and convenience of\r\nall, and after the war was over and he had been advanced to the rank\r\nof General, he came to Baltimore as the honored guest of one of his\r\nformer prisoners, and while there received the warm and hearty\r\ngreeting of others of his prisoners who still survived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA PERSONAL CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now completed my task; but perhaps it will be expected that I\r\nshould clearly define my own position. I have no objection to do so.\r\n\r\nBoth from feeling and on principle I had always been opposed to\r\nslavery--the result in part of the teaching and example of my parents,\r\nand confirmed by my own reading and observation. In early manhood I\r\nbecame prominent in defending the rights of the free colored people of\r\nMaryland. In the year 1846 I was associated with a small number of\r\npersons, of whom the Rev. William F. Brand, author of the \"Life of\r\nBishop Whittingham,\" and myself, are the only survivors. The other\r\nmembers of the association were Dr. Richard S. Steuart, for many years\r\nPresident of the Maryland Hospital for the Insane, and himself a\r\nslaveholder; Galloway Cheston, a merchant and afterwards President of\r\nthe Board of Trustees of the Johns Hopkins University; Frederick W.\r\nBrune, my brother-in-law and law-partner; and Ramsay McHenry, planter.\r\nWe were preparing to initiate a movement tending to a gradual\r\nemancipation within the State, but the growing hostility between the\r\nNorth and the South rendered the plan wholly impracticable, and it was\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nMy opinions, however, did not lead me into sympathy with the abolition\r\nparty. I knew that slavery had existed almost everywhere in the world,\r\nand still existed in some places, and that, whatever might be its\r\ncharacter elsewhere, it was not in the Southern States \"the sum of all\r\nvillainy.\" On the contrary, it had assisted materially in the\r\ndevelopment of the race. Nowhere else, I believe, had negro slaves\r\nbeen so well treated, on the whole, and had advanced so far in\r\ncivilization. They had learned the necessity, as well as the habit, of\r\nlabor; the importance--to some extent at least--of thrift; the\r\nessential distinctions between right and wrong, and the inevitable\r\ndifference to the individual between right-doing and wrong-doing; the\r\nduty of obedience to law; and--not least--some conception, dim though\r\nit might be, of the inspiring teachings of the Christian religion.\r\nThey had learned also to cherish a feeling of respect and good will\r\ntowards the best portion of the white race, to whom they looked up,\r\nand whom they imitated.\r\n\r\nI refused to enlist in a crusade against slavery, not only on\r\nconstitutional grounds, but for other reasons. If the slaves were\r\nfreed and clothed with the right of suffrage, they would be incapable\r\nof using it properly. If the suffrage were withheld, they would be\r\nsubjected to the oppression of the white race without the protection\r\nafforded by their masters. Thus I could see no prospect of maintaining\r\nharmony without a disastrous change in our form of government such as\r\nprevailed after the war, in what is called the period of\r\nreconstruction. If there were entire equality, and an intermingling of\r\nthe two races, it would not, as it seemed to me, be for the benefit of\r\neither. I knew how strong are race prejudices, especially when\r\nstimulated by competition and interest; how cruelly the foreigners, as\r\nthey were called, had been treated by the people in California, and\r\nthe Indians by our people everywhere; and how, in my own city,\r\ncitizens were for years ruthlessly deprived by the Know-Nothing party\r\nof the right of suffrage, some because they were of foreign birth,\r\nand some because they were Catholics. The problem of slavery was to me\r\na Gordian knot which I knew not how to untie, and which I dared not\r\nattempt to cut with the sword. Such a severance involved the horrors\r\nof civil war, with the wickedness and demoralization which were sure\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\nI was deeply attached to the Union from a feeling imbibed in early\r\nchildhood and constantly strengthened by knowledge and personal\r\nexperience. I did not believe in secession as a constitutional right,\r\nand in Maryland there was no sufficient ground for revolution. It was\r\nclearly for her interest to remain in the Union and to free her\r\nslaves. An attempt to secede or to revolt would have been an act of\r\nfolly which I deprecated, although I did believe that she, in common\r\nwith the rest of the South, had constitutional rights in regard to\r\nslavery which the North was not willing to respect.\r\n\r\nIt was my opinion that the Confederacy would prove to be a rope of\r\nsand. I thought that the seceding States should have been allowed to\r\ndepart in peace, as General Scott advised, and I believed that\r\nafterwards the necessities of the situation and their own interest\r\nwould induce them to return, severally, perhaps, to the old Union, but\r\nwith slavery peacefully abolished; for, in the nature of things, I\r\nknew that slavery could not last forever.\r\n\r\nWhether or not my opinions were sound and my hopes well founded, is\r\nnow a matter of little importance, even to myself, but they were at\r\nleast sincere and were not concealed.\r\n\r\nThere can be no true union in a Republic unless the parts are held\r\ntogether by a feeling of common interest, and also of mutual respect.\r\n\r\nThat there is a common interest no reasonable person can doubt; but\r\nthis is not sufficient; and, happily, there is a solid basis for\r\nmutual respect also.\r\n\r\nI have already stated the grounds on which, from their point of view,\r\nthe Southern people were justified in their revolt, and even in the\r\nmidst of the war I recognized what the South is gradually coming to\r\nrecognize--that the grounds on which the Northern people waged\r\nwar--love of the Union and hatred of slavery--were also entitled to\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nI believe that the results achieved--namely, the preservation of the\r\nUnion and the abolition of slavery--are worth all they have cost.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I feel that I am living in a different land from that in which\r\nI was born, and under a different Constitution, and that new perils\r\nhave arisen sufficient to cause great anxiety. Some of these are the\r\nconsequences of the war, and some are due to other causes. But every\r\ngeneration must encounter its own trials, and should extract benefit\r\nfrom them if it can. The grave problems growing out of emancipation\r\nseem to have found a solution in an improving education of the whole\r\npeople. Perhaps education is the true means of escape from the other\r\nperils to which I have alluded.\r\n\r\nLet me state them as they appear to me to exist.\r\n\r\nVast fortunes, which astonish the world, have suddenly been acquired,\r\nvery many by methods of more than doubtful honesty, while the fortunes\r\nthemselves are so used as to benefit neither the possessors nor the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nRepublican simplicity has ceased to be a reality, except where it\r\nexists as a survival in rural districts, and is hardly now mentioned\r\neven as a phrase. It has been superseded by republican luxury and\r\nostentation. The mass of the people, who cannot afford to indulge in\r\neither, are sorely tempted to covet both.\r\n\r\nThe individual man does not rely, as he formerly did, on his own\r\nstrength and manhood. Organization for a common purpose is resorted to\r\nwherever organization is possible. Combinations of capital or of\r\nlabor, ruled by a few individuals, bestride the land with immense\r\npower both for good and evil. In these combinations the individual\r\ncounts for little, and is but little concerned about his own moral\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWhen De Tocqueville, in 1838, wrote his remarkable book on Democracy\r\nin America, he expressed his surprise to observe how every public\r\nquestion was submitted to the decision of the people, and that, when\r\nthe people had decided, the question was settled. Now politicians care\r\nlittle about the opinions of the people, because the people care\r\nlittle about opinions. Bosses have come into existence to ply their\r\nvile trade of office-brokerage. Rings are formed in which the bosses\r\nare masters and the voters their henchmen. Formerly decent people\r\ncould not be bought either with money or offices. Political parties\r\nhave always some honest foundation, but rings are factions like those\r\nof Rome in her decline, having no foundation but public plunder.\r\n\r\nCommunism, socialism, and labor strikes have taken the place of\r\nslavery agitation. Many people have come to believe that this is a\r\npaternal Government from which they have a right to ask for favors,\r\nand not a Republic in which all are equal. Hence States, cities,\r\ncorporations, individuals, and especially certain favored classes,\r\nhave no scruple in getting money somehow or other, directly or\r\nindirectly, out of the purse of the Nation, as if the Nation had\r\neither purse or property which does not belong to the people, for the\r\nbenefit of the whole people, without favor or partiality towards any.\r\n\r\nIn many ways there is a dangerous tendency towards the centralization\r\nof power in the National Government, with little opposition on the\r\npart of the people.\r\n\r\nPaper money is held by the Supreme Court to be a lawful substitute for\r\ngold and silver coin, partly on the ground that this is the\r\nprerogative of European governments.[16] This is strange\r\nconstitutional doctrine to those who were brought up in the school of\r\nMarshall, Story, and Chancellor Kent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Legal Tender Case, Vol. 110 U. S. Reports, p. 421.]\r\n\r\nThe administration of cities has grown more and more extravagant and\r\ncorrupt, thus leading to the creation of immense debts which oppress\r\nthe people and threaten to become unmanageable.\r\n\r\nThe national Congress, instead of faithfully administering its trust,\r\nhas become reckless and wasteful of the public money.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding all this, I rejoice to believe that there is a\r\nreserve of power in the American people which has never yet failed to\r\nredress great wrongs when they have come to be fully recognized and\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nA striking instance of this is to be found in the temperance movement,\r\nwhich, extreme as it may be in some respects, shows that the\r\nconscience of the entire country is aroused on a subject of vast\r\ndifficulty and importance.\r\n\r\nAnd other auspicious signs exist, the chief of which I think are that\r\na new zeal is manifested in the cause of education; that people of all\r\ncreeds come together as they never did before to help in good works;\r\nthat an independent press, bent on enlightening, not deceiving, the\r\npeople, is making itself heard and respected; and that younger men,\r\nwho represent the best hopes and aspirations of the time, are pressing\r\nforward to take the place of the politicians of a different school,\r\nwho represent chiefly their own selfish interests, or else a period of\r\nhate and discord which has passed away forever.\r\n\r\nThese considerations give me hope and confidence in the country as it\r\nexists to-day.\r\n\r\nBaltimore is the place of my birth, of my home, and of my affections.\r\nNo one could be bound to his native city by ties stronger than mine.\r\nPerhaps, in view of the incidents of the past, as detailed in this\r\nvolume, I may be permitted to express to the good people of Baltimore\r\nmy sincere and profound gratitude for the generous and unsolicited\r\nconfidence which, on different occasions, they have reposed in me, and\r\nfor their good will and kind feeling, which have never been withdrawn\r\nduring the years, now not a few, which I have spent in their service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following account of the alleged conspiracy to assassinate Abraham\r\nLincoln on his journey to Baltimore is taken from the \"Life of Abraham\r\nLincoln,\" by Ward H. Lamon, pp. 511-526:\r\n\r\n\"Whilst Mr. Lincoln, in the midst of his suite and attendants, was\r\nbeing borne in triumph through the streets of Philadelphia, and a\r\ncountless multitude of people were shouting themselves hoarse, and\r\njostling and crushing each other around his carriage-wheels, Mr.\r\nFelton, the President of the Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore\r\nRailway, was engaged with a private detective discussing the details\r\nof an alleged conspiracy to murder him at Baltimore. Some months\r\nbefore, Mr. Felton, apprehending danger to the bridges along his line,\r\nhad taken this man into his pay and sent him to Baltimore to spy out\r\nand report any plot that might be found for their destruction. Taking\r\nwith him a couple of other men and a woman, the detective went about\r\nhis business with the zeal which necessarily marks his peculiar\r\nprofession. He set up as a stock-broker, under an assumed name, opened\r\nan office, and became a vehement secessionist. His agents were\r\ninstructed to act with the duplicity which such men generally use; to\r\nbe rabid on the subject of 'Southern Rights'; to suggest all manner of\r\ncrimes in vindication of them; and if, by these arts, corresponding\r\nsentiments should be elicited from their victims, the 'job' might be\r\nconsidered as prospering. Of course they readily found out what\r\neverybody else knew--that Maryland was in a state of great alarm; that\r\nher people were forming military associations, and that Governor Hicks\r\nwas doing his utmost to furnish them with arms, on condition that the\r\narms, in case of need, should be turned against the Federal\r\nGovernment. Whether they detected any plan to burn bridges or not, the\r\nchief detective does not relate; but it appears that he soon deserted\r\nthat inquiry and got, or pretended to get, upon a scent that promised\r\na heavier reward. Being intensely ambitious to shine in the\r\nprofessional way, and something of a politician besides, it struck him\r\nthat it would be a particularly fine thing to discover a dreadful plot\r\nto assassinate the President-elect, and he discovered it accordingly.\r\nIt was easy to get that far; to furnish tangible proofs of an\r\nimaginary conspiracy was a more difficult matter. But Baltimore was\r\nseething with political excitement; numerous strangers from the far\r\nSouth crowded its hotels and boarding-houses; great numbers of\r\nmechanics and laborers out of employment encumbered its streets; and\r\neverywhere politicians, merchants, mechanics, laborers and loafers\r\nwere engaged in heated discussions about the anticipated war, and the\r\nprobability of Northern troops being marched through Maryland to\r\nslaughter and pillage beyond the Potomac. It would seem like an easy\r\nthing to beguile a few individuals of this angry and excited multitude\r\ninto the expression of some criminal desire; and the opportunity was\r\nnot wholly lost, although the limited success of the detective under\r\nsuch favorable circumstances is absolutely wonderful. He put his\r\n'shadows' upon several persons whom it suited his pleasure to suspect,\r\nand the 'shadows' pursued their work with the keen zest and the cool\r\ntreachery of their kind. They reported daily to their chief in\r\nwriting, as he reported in turn to his employer. These documents are\r\nneither edifying nor useful: they prove nothing but the baseness of\r\nthe vocation which gave them existence. They were furnished to Mr.\r\nHerndon in full, under the impression that partisan feeling had\r\nextinguished in him the love of truth and the obligations of candor,\r\nas it had in many writers who preceded him on the same subject-matter.\r\nThey have been carefully and thoroughly read, analyzed, examined and\r\ncompared, with an earnest and conscientious desire to discover the\r\ntruth, if, perchance, any trace of truth might be in them. The process\r\nof investigation began with a strong bias in favor of the conclusion\r\nat which the detective had arrived. For ten years the author\r\nimplicitly believed in the reality of the atrocious plot which these\r\nspies were supposed to have detected and thwarted; and for ten years\r\nhe had pleased himself with the reflection that he also had done\r\nsomething to defeat the bloody purpose of the assassins. It was a\r\nconviction which could scarcely have been overthrown by evidence less\r\npowerful than the detective's weak and contradictory account of his\r\nown case. In that account there is literally nothing to sustain the\r\naccusation, and much to rebut it. It is perfectly manifest that there\r\nwas no conspiracy--no conspiracy of a hundred, of fifty, of twenty, of\r\nthree--no definite purpose in the heart of even one man to murder Mr.\r\nLincoln at Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\"The reports are all in the form of personal narratives, and for the\r\nmost relate when the spies went to bed, when they rose, where they\r\nate, what saloons and brothels they visited, and what blackguards they\r\nmet and 'drinked' with. One of them shadowed a loud-mouthed drinking\r\nfellow named Luckett, and another, a poor scapegrace and braggart\r\nnamed Hilliard. These wretches 'drinked' and talked a great deal, hung\r\nabout bars, haunted disreputable houses, were constantly half drunk,\r\nand easily excited to use big and threatening words by the faithless\r\nprotestations and cunning management of the spies. Thus Hilliard was\r\nmade to say that he thought a man who should act the part of Brutus in\r\nthese times would deserve well of his country; and Luckett was induced\r\nto declare that he knew a man who would kill Lincoln. At length the\r\ngreat arch-conspirator--the Brutus, the Orsini of the New World, to\r\nwhom Luckett and Hilliard, the 'national volunteers,' and all such,\r\nwere as mere puppets--condescended to reveal himself in the most\r\nobliging and confiding manner. He made no mystery of his cruel and\r\ndesperate scheme. He did not guard it as a dangerous secret, or choose\r\nhis confidants with the circumspection which political criminals, and\r\nespecially assassins, have generally thought proper to observe. Very\r\nmany persons knew what he was about, and levied on their friends for\r\nsmall sums--five, ten and twenty dollars--to further the Captain's\r\nplan. Even Luckett was deep enough in the awful plot to raise money\r\nfor it; and when he took one of the spies to a public bar-room and\r\nintroduced him to the 'Captain,' the latter sat down and talked it all\r\nover without the slightest reserve. When was there ever before such a\r\nloud-mouthed conspirator, such a trustful and innocent assassin! His\r\nname was Ferrandini, his occupation that of a barber, his place of\r\nbusiness beneath Barnum's Hotel, where the sign of the bloodthirsty\r\nvillain still invites the unsuspecting public to come in for a shave.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Luckett,' so the spy relates, 'said that he was not going home\r\nthis evening; and if I would meet him at Barr's saloon, on South\r\nstreet, he would introduce me to Ferrandini. This was unexpected to\r\nme; but I determined to take the chances, and agreed to meet Mr.\r\nLuckett at the place named at 7 P. M. Mr. Luckett left about 2.30 P.\r\nM., and I went to dinner.\r\n\r\n\"'I was at the office in the afternoon in hopes that Mr. Felton might\r\ncall, but he did not; and at 6.15 P. M. I went to supper. After supper\r\nI went to Barr's saloon, and found Mr. Luckett and several other\r\ngentlemen there. He asked me to drink, and introduced me to Captain\r\nFerrandini and Captain Turner. He eulogized me very highly as a\r\nneighbor of his, and told Ferrandini that I was the gentleman who had\r\ngiven the twenty-five dollars he (Luckett) had given to Ferrandini.\r\n\r\n\"'The conversation at once got into politics; and Ferrandini, who is a\r\nfine-looking, intelligent-appearing person, became very excited. He\r\nshows the Italian in, I think, a very marked degree; and, although\r\nexcited, yet was cooler than what I had believed was the general\r\ncharacteristic of Italians. He has lived South for many years, and is\r\nthoroughly imbued with the idea that the South must rule; that they\r\n(Southerners) have been outraged in their rights by the election of\r\nLincoln, and freely justified resorting to any means to prevent\r\nLincoln from taking his seat; and, as he spoke, his eyes fairly glared\r\nand glistened, and his whole frame quivered; but he was fully\r\nconscious of all he was doing. He is a man well calculated for\r\ncontrolling and directing the ardent-minded; he is an enthusiast, and\r\nbelieves that, to use his own words, \"murder of any kind is\r\njustifiable and right to save the rights of the Southern people.\" In\r\nall his views he was ably seconded by Captain Turner.\r\n\r\n\"'Captain Turner is an American; but although very much of a\r\ngentleman, and possessing warm Southern feelings, he is not by any\r\nmeans so dangerous a man as Ferrandini, as his ability for exciting\r\nothers is less powerful; but that he is a bold and proud man there is\r\nno doubt, as also that he is entirely under the control of Ferrandini.\r\nIn fact, he could not be otherwise, for even I myself felt the\r\ninfluence of this man's strange power; and, wrong though I knew him to\r\nbe, I felt strangely unable to keep my mind balanced against him.\r\n\r\n\"'Ferrandini said, \"Never, never, shall Lincoln be President!\" His\r\nlife (Ferrandini's) was of no consequence; he was willing to give it\r\nup for Lincoln's; he would sell it for that abolitionist's; and as\r\nOrsini had given his life for Italy, so was he (Ferrandini) ready to\r\ndie for his country and the rights of the South; and said Ferrandini,\r\nturning to Captain Turner, \"We shall all die together: we shall show\r\nthe North that we fear them not. Every man, Captain,\" said he, \"will\r\non that day prove himself a hero. The first shot fired, the main\r\ntraitor (Lincoln) dead, and all Maryland will be with us, and the\r\nSouth shall be free; and the North must then be ours. Mr. Hutchins,\"\r\nsaid Ferrandini, \"if I alone must do it, I shall: Lincoln shall die in\r\nthis city.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Whilst we were thus talking, we (Mr. Luckett, Turner, Ferrandini and\r\nmyself) were alone in one corner of the bar-room, and, while talking,\r\ntwo strangers had got pretty near us. Mr. Luckett called Ferrandini's\r\nattention to this, and intimated that they were listening; and we went\r\nup to the bar, drinked again at my expense, and again retired to\r\nanother part of the room, at Ferrandini's request, to see if the\r\nstrangers would again follow us. Whether by accident or design, they\r\nagain got near us; but of course we were not talking of any matter of\r\nconsequence. Ferrandini said he suspected they were spies, and\r\nsuggested that he had to attend a secret meeting, and was apprehensive\r\nthat the two strangers might follow him; and, at Mr. Luckett's\r\nrequest, I remained with him (Luckett) to watch the movements of the\r\nstrangers. I assured Ferrandini that if they would attempt to follow\r\nhim, we would whip them.\r\n\r\n\"'Ferrandini and Turner left to attend the meeting, and, anxious as I\r\nwas to follow them myself, I was obliged to remain with Mr. Luckett to\r\nwatch the strangers, which we did for about fifteen minutes, when Mr.\r\nLuckett said that he should go to a friend's to stay over night, and I\r\nleft for my hotel, arriving there at about 9 P. M., and soon retired.'\r\n\r\n\"It is in a secret communication between hireling spies and paid\r\ninformers that these ferocious sentiments are attributed to the poor\r\nknight of the soap-pot. No disinterested person would believe the\r\nstory upon such evidence; and it will appear hereafter that even the\r\ndetective felt that it was too weak to mention among his strong\r\npoints, at that decisive moment when he revealed all he knew to the\r\nPresident and his friends. It is probably a mere fiction. If it had\r\nhad any foundation in fact, we are inclined to believe that the\r\nsprightly and eloquent barber would have dangled at a rope's end long\r\nsince. He would hardly have been left to shave and plot in peace,\r\nwhile the members of the Legislature, the Police Marshal, and numerous\r\nprivate gentlemen, were locked up in Federal prisons. When Mr. Lincoln\r\nwas actually slain, four years later, and the cupidity of the\r\ndetectives was excited by enormous rewards, Ferrandini was totally\r\nunmolested. But even if Ferrandini really said all that is here\r\nimputed to him, he did no more than many others around him were doing\r\nat the same time. He drank and talked, and made swelling speeches; but\r\nhe never took, nor seriously thought of taking, the first step toward\r\nthe frightful tragedy he is said to have contemplated.\r\n\r\n\"The detectives are cautious not to include in the supposed plot to\r\nmurder any person of eminence, power, or influence. Their game is all\r\nof the smaller sort, and, as they conceived, easily taken--witless\r\nvagabonds like Hilliard and Luckett, and a barber, whose calling\r\nindicates his character and associations.[17] They had no fault to\r\nfind with the Governor of the State; he was rather a lively trimmer,\r\nto be sure, and very anxious to turn up at last on the winning side;\r\nbut it was manifestly impossible that one in such an exalted station\r\ncould meditate murder. Yet, if they had pushed their inquiries with an\r\nhonest desire to get at the truth, they might have found much stronger\r\nevidence against the Governor than that which they pretend to have\r\nfound against the barber. In the Governor's case the evidence is\r\ndocumentary, written, authentic--over his own hand, clear and\r\nconclusive as pen and ink could make it. As early as the previous\r\nNovember, Governor Hicks had written the following letter; and,\r\nnotwithstanding its treasonable and murderous import, the writer\r\nbecame conspicuously loyal before spring, and lived to reap splendid\r\nrewards and high honors, under the auspices of the Federal Government,\r\nas the most patriotic and devoted Union man in Maryland. The person to\r\nwhom the letter was addressed was equally fortunate; and, instead of\r\ndrawing out his comrades in the field to 'kill Lincoln and his men,'\r\nhe was sent to Congress by power exerted from Washington at a time\r\nwhen the administration selected the representatives of Maryland, and\r\nperformed all his duties right loyally and acceptably. Shall one be\r\ntaken and another left? Shall Hicks go to the Senate and Webster to\r\nCongress, while the poor barber is held to the silly words which he\r\nis alleged to have sputtered out between drinks in a low groggery,\r\nunder the blandishments and encouragements of an eager spy, itching\r\nfor his reward?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Mr. Ferrandini, now in advanced years, still lives in\r\nBaltimore, and declares the charge of conspiracy to be wholly absurd\r\nand fictitious, and those who know him will, I think, believe that he\r\nis an unlikely person to be engaged in such a plot.]\r\n\r\n                \"'STATE OF MARYLAND,\r\n                          \"'EXECUTIVE CHAMBER,\r\n                                      \"'ANNAPOLIS, _November 9, 1860_.\r\n     \"'Hon.

HICKS.'\r\n\r\n\"With the Presidential party was Hon. Norman B. Judd; he was supposed\r\nto exercise unbounded influence over the new President; and with him,\r\ntherefore, the detective opened communications. At various places\r\nalong the route Mr. Judd was given vague hints of the impending\r\ndanger, accompanied by the usual assurances of the skill and activity\r\nof the patriots who were perilling their lives in a rebel city to save\r\nthat of the Chief Magistrate. When he reached New York, he was met by\r\nthe woman who had originally gone with the other spies to Baltimore.\r\nShe had urgent messages from her chief--messages that disturbed Mr.\r\nJudd exceedingly. The detective was anxious to meet Mr. Judd and the\r\nPresident, and a meeting was accordingly arranged to take place at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln reached Philadelphia on the afternoon of the 21st. The\r\ndetective had arrived in the morning, and improved the interval to\r\nimpress and enlist Mr. Felton. In the evening he got Mr. Judd and Mr.\r\nFelton into his room at the St. Louis Hotel, and told them all he had\r\nlearned. He dwelt at large on the fierce temper of the Baltimore\r\nsecessionists; on the loose talk he had heard about 'fireballs or\r\nhand-grenades'; on a 'privateer' said to be moored somewhere in the\r\nbay; on the organization called National Volunteers; on the fact that,\r\neavesdropping at Barnum's Hotel, he had overheard Marshal Kane\r\nintimate that he would not supply a police force on some undefined\r\noccasion, but what the occasion was he did not know. He made much of\r\nhis miserable victim, Hilliard, whom he held up as a perfect type of\r\nthe class from which danger was to be apprehended; but concerning\r\n\"Captain\" Ferrandini and his threats, he said, according to his own\r\naccount, not a single word. He had opened his case, his whole case,\r\nand stated it as strongly as he could. Mr. Judd was very much\r\nstartled, and was sure that it would be extremely imprudent for Mr.\r\nLincoln to pass through Baltimore in open daylight, according to the\r\npublished programme. But he thought the detective ought to see the\r\nPresident himself; and, as it was wearing toward nine o'clock, there\r\nwas no time to lose. It was agreed that the part taken by the\r\ndetective and Mr. Felton should be kept secret from every one but the\r\nPresident. Mr. Sanford, President of the American Telegraph Company,\r\nhad also been co-operating in the business, and the same stipulation\r\nwas made with regard to him.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Judd went to his own room at the Continental, and the detective\r\nfollowed. The crowd in the hotel was very dense, and it took some time\r\nto get a message to Mr. Lincoln. But it finally reached him, and he\r\nresponded in person. Mr. Judd introduced the detective, and the latter\r\ntold his story over again, with a single variation: this time he\r\nmentioned the name of Ferrandini along with Hilliard's, but gave no\r\nmore prominence to one than to the other.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Judd and the detective wanted Lincoln to leave for Washington\r\nthat night. This he flatly refused to do. He had engagements with the\r\npeople, he said, to raise a flag over Independence Hall in the\r\nmorning, and to exhibit himself at Harrisburg in the afternoon, and\r\nthese engagements he would not break in any event. But he would raise\r\nthe flag, go to Harrisburg, 'get away quietly' in the evening, and\r\npermit himself to be carried to Washington in the way they thought\r\nbest. Even this, however, he conceded with great reluctance. He\r\ncondescended to cross-examine the detective on some parts of his\r\nnarrative, but at no time did he seem in the least degree alarmed. He\r\nwas earnestly requested not to communicate the change of plan to any\r\nmember of his party except Mr. Judd, nor permit even a suspicion of it\r\nto cross the mind of another. To this he replied that he would be\r\ncompelled to tell Mrs. Lincoln, 'and he thought it likely that she\r\nwould insist upon W. H. Lamon going with him; but, aside from that, no\r\none should know.'\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime, Mr. Seward had also discovered the conspiracy. He\r\ndispatched his son to Philadelphia to warn the President-elect of the\r\nterrible plot into whose meshes he was about to run. Mr. Lincoln\r\nturned him over to Judd, and Judd told him they already knew all about\r\nit. He went away with just enough information to enable his father to\r\nanticipate the exact moment of Mr. Lincoln's surreptitious arrival in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n\"Early on the morning of the 22d, Mr. Lincoln raised the flag over\r\nIndependence Hall, and departed for Harrisburg. On the way Mr. Judd\r\n'gave him a full and precise detail of the arrangements that had been\r\nmade' the previous night. After the conference with the detective, Mr.\r\nSanford, Colonel Scott, Mr. Felton, railroad and telegraph officials,\r\nhad been sent for, and came to Mr. Judd's room. They occupied nearly\r\nthe whole of the night in perfecting the plan. It was finally\r\nunderstood that about six o'clock the next evening Mr. Lincoln should\r\nslip away from the Jones Hotel, at Harrisburg, in company with a\r\nsingle member of his party. A special car and engine would be provided\r\nfor him on the track outside the depot. All other trains on the road\r\nwould be 'side-tracked' until this one had passed. Mr. Sanford would\r\nforward skilled 'telegraph-climbers,' and see that all the wires\r\nleading out of Harrisburg were cut at six o'clock, and kept down until\r\nit was known that Mr. Lincoln had reached Washington in safety. The\r\ndetective would meet Mr. Lincoln at the West Philadelphia Depot with a\r\ncarriage, and conduct him by a circuitous route to the Philadelphia,\r\nWilmington and Baltimore Depot. Berths for four would be pre-engaged\r\nin the sleeping-car attached to the regular midnight train for\r\nBaltimore. This train Mr. Felton would cause to be detained until the\r\nconductor should receive a package, containing important 'Government\r\ndispatches,' addressed to 'E. J. Allen, Willard's Hotel, Washington.'\r\nThis package was made up of old newspapers, carefully wrapped and\r\nsealed, and delivered to the detective to be used as soon as Mr.\r\nLincoln was lodged in the car. Mr. Lincoln approved of the plan, and\r\nsignified his readiness to acquiesce. Then Mr. Judd, forgetting the\r\nsecrecy which the spy had so impressively enjoined, told Mr. Lincoln\r\nthat the step he was about to take was one of such transcendent\r\nimportance that he thought 'it should be communicated to the other\r\ngentlemen of the party.' Mr. Lincoln said, 'You can do as you like\r\nabout that.' Mr. Judd now changed his seat; and Mr. Nicolay, whose\r\nsuspicions seem to have been aroused by this mysterious conference,\r\nsat down beside him and said: 'Judd, there is something _up_. What is\r\nit, if it is proper that I should know?' 'George,' answered Judd,\r\n'there is no necessity for your knowing it. One man can keep a matter\r\nbetter than two.'\r\n\r\n\"Arrived at Harrisburg, and the public ceremonies and speechmaking\r\nover, Mr. Lincoln retired to a private parlor in the Jones House, and\r\nMr. Judd summoned to meet him Judge Davis, Colonel Lamon, Colonel\r\nSumner, Major Hunter and Captain Pope. The three latter were officers\r\nof the regular army, and had joined the party after it had left\r\nSpringfield. Judd began the conference by stating the alleged fact of\r\nthe Baltimore conspiracy, how it was detected, and how it was proposed\r\nto thwart it by a midnight expedition to Washington by way of\r\nPhiladelphia. It was a great surprise to most of those assembled.\r\nColonel Sumner was the first to break silence. 'That proceeding,' said\r\nhe, 'will be a damned piece of cowardice.' Mr. Judd considered this a\r\n'pointed hit,' but replied that 'that view of the case had already\r\nbeen presented to Mr. Lincoln.' Then there was a general interchange\r\nof opinions, which Sumner interrupted by saying, 'I'll get a squad of\r\ncavalry, sir, and _cut_ our way to Washington, sir!' 'Probably before\r\nthat day comes,' said Mr. Judd, 'the inauguration-day will have\r\npassed. It is important that Mr. Lincoln should be in Washington that\r\nday.' Thus far Judge Davis had expressed no opinion, but 'had put\r\nvarious questions to test the truthfulness of the story.' He now\r\nturned to Mr. Lincoln and said, 'You personally heard the detective's\r\nstory. You have heard this discussion. What is your judgment in the\r\nmatter?' 'I have listened,' answered Mr. Lincoln, 'to this discussion\r\nwith interest. I see no reason, no good reason, to change the\r\nprogramme, and I am for carrying it out as arranged by Judd.' There\r\nwas no longer any dissent as to the plan itself; but one question\r\nstill remained to be disposed of. Who should accompany the President\r\non his perilous ride? Mr. Judd again took the lead, declaring that he\r\nand Mr. Lincoln had previously determined that but one man ought to\r\ngo, and that Colonel Lamon had been selected as the proper person. To\r\nthis Sumner violently demurred. '_I_ have undertaken,' he exclaimed,\r\n'to see Mr. Lincoln to Washington.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln was hastily dining when a close carriage was brought to\r\nthe side door of the hotel. He was called, hurried to his room,\r\nchanged his coat and hat, and passed rapidly through the hall and out\r\nof the door. As he was stepping into the carriage, it became manifest\r\nthat Sumner was determined to get in also. 'Hurry with him,' whispered\r\nJudd to Lamon, and at the same time, placing his hand on Sumner's\r\nshoulder, said aloud, 'One moment, Colonel!' Sumner turned around, and\r\nin that moment the carriage drove rapidly away. 'A madder man,' says\r\nMr. Judd, 'you never saw.'\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln and Colonel Lamon got on board the car without discovery\r\nor mishap. Besides themselves, there was no one in or about the car\r\nbut Mr. Lewis, General Superintendent of the Pennsylvania Central\r\nRailroad, and Mr. Franciscus, superintendent of the division over\r\nwhich they were about to pass. As Mr. Lincoln's dress on this occasion\r\nhas been much discussed, it may be as well to state that he wore a\r\nsoft, light felt hat, drawn down over his face when it seemed\r\nnecessary or convenient, and a shawl thrown over his shoulders, and\r\npulled up to assist in disguising his features when passing to and\r\nfrom the carriage. This was all there was of the 'Scotch cap and\r\ncloak,' so widely celebrated in the political literature of the day.\r\n\r\n\"At ten o'clock they reached Philadelphia, and were met by the\r\ndetective and one Mr. Kinney, an under official of the Philadelphia,\r\nWilmington and Baltimore Railroad. Lewis and Franciscus bade Mr.\r\nLincoln adieu. Mr. Lincoln, Colonel Lamon and the detective seated\r\nthemselves in a carriage which stood in waiting, and Mr. Kinney got\r\nupon the box with the driver. It was a full hour and a half before the\r\nBaltimore train was to start, and Mr. Kinney found it necessary 'to\r\nconsume the time by driving northward in search of some imaginary\r\nperson.'\r\n\r\n\"On the way through Philadelphia, Mr. Lincoln told his companions\r\nabout the message he had received from Mr. Seward. This new discovery\r\nwas infinitely more appalling than the other. Mr. Seward had been\r\ninformed 'that about _fifteen thousand men_ were organized to prevent\r\nhis (Lincoln's) passage through Baltimore, and that arrangements were\r\nmade by these parties to _blow up the railroad track, fire the\r\ntrain_,' etc. In view of these unpleasant circumstances, Mr. Seward\r\nrecommended a change of route. Here was a plot big enough to swallow\r\nup the little one, which we are to regard as the peculiar property of\r\nMr. Felton's detective. Hilliard, Ferrandini and Luckett disappear\r\namong the 'fifteen thousand,' and their maudlin and impotent twaddle\r\nabout the 'abolition tyrant' looks very insignificant beside the\r\nbloody massacre, conflagration and explosion now foreshadowed.\r\n\r\n\"As the moment for the departure of the Baltimore train drew near,\r\nthe carriage paused in the dark shadows of the depot building. It was\r\nnot considered prudent to approach the entrance. The spy passed in\r\nfirst and was followed by Mr. Lincoln and Colonel Lamon. An agent of\r\nthe former directed them to the sleeping-car, which they entered by\r\nthe rear door. Mr. Kinney ran forward and delivered to the conductor\r\nthe important package prepared for the purpose; and in three minutes\r\nthe train was in motion. The tickets for the whole party had been\r\nprocured beforehand. Their berths were ready, but had only been\r\npreserved from invasion by the statement that they were retained for a\r\nsick man and his attendants. The business had been managed very\r\nadroitly by the female spy, who had accompanied her employer from\r\nBaltimore to Philadelphia to assist him in this, the most delicate and\r\nimportant affair of his life. Mr. Lincoln got into his bed\r\nimmediately, and the curtains were drawn together. When the conductor\r\ncame around, the detective handed him the 'sick man's' ticket, and the\r\nrest of the party lay down also. None of 'our party appeared to be\r\nsleepy,' says the detective, 'but we all lay quiet, and nothing of\r\nimportance transpired.'... During the night Mr. Lincoln indulged in a\r\njoke or two in an undertone; but, with that exception, the two\r\nsections occupied by them were perfectly silent. The detective said he\r\nhad men stationed at various places along the road to let him know 'if\r\nall was right,' and he rose and went to the platform occasionally to\r\nobserve their signals, but returned each time with a favorable report.\r\n\r\n\"At thirty minutes after three the train reached Baltimore. One of the\r\nspy's assistants came on board and informed him in a whisper that all\r\nwas right. The woman [the female detective] got out of the car. Mr.\r\nLincoln lay close in his berth, and in a few moments the car was\r\nbeing slowly drawn through the quiet streets of the city toward the\r\nWashington Depot. There again there was another pause, but no sound\r\nmore alarming than the noise of shifting cars and engines. The\r\npassengers, tucked away on their narrow shelves, dozed on as\r\npeacefully as if Mr. Lincoln had never been born....\r\n\r\n\"In due time the train sped out of the suburbs of Baltimore, and the\r\napprehensions of the President and his friends diminished with each\r\nwelcome revolution of the wheels. At six o'clock the dome of the\r\nCapitol came in sight, and a moment later they rolled into the long,\r\nunsightly building which forms the Washington Depot. They passed out\r\nof the car unobstructed, and pushed along with the living stream of\r\nmen and women towards the outer door. One man alone in the great crowd\r\nseemed to watch Mr. Lincoln with special attention. Standing a little\r\non one side, he 'looked very sharp at him,' and, as he passed, seized\r\nhold of his hand and said in a loud tone of voice, 'Abe, you can't\r\nplay that on me.' The detective and Col. Lamon were instantly alarmed.\r\nOne of them raised his fist to strike the stranger; but Mr. Lincoln\r\ncaught his arm and said, 'Don't strike him! don't strike him! It is\r\nWashburne. Don't you know him?' Mr. Seward had given to Mr. Washburne\r\na hint of the information received through his son, and Mr. Washburne\r\nknew its value as well as another. For the present the detective\r\nadmonished him to keep quiet, and they passed on together. Taking a\r\nhack, they drove towards Willard's Hotel. Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Washburne\r\nand the detective got out into the street and approached the ladies'\r\nentrance, while Col. Lamon drove on to the main entrance, and sent the\r\nproprietor to meet his distinguished guest at the side door. A few\r\nminutes later Mr. Seward arrived, and was introduced to the company\r\nby Mr. Washburne. He spoke in very strong terms of the great danger\r\nwhich Mr. Lincoln had so narrowly escaped, and most heartily applauded\r\nthe wisdom of the 'secret passage.' 'I informed Gov. Seward of the\r\nnature of the information I had,' says the detective, 'and that I had\r\nno information of any large organization in Baltimore; but the\r\nGovernor reiterated that he had conclusive evidence of this.'...\r\n\r\n\"That same day Mr. Lincoln's family and suite passed through Baltimore\r\non the special train intended for him. They saw no sign of any\r\ndisposition to burn them alive, or to blow them up with gunpowder, but\r\nwent their way unmolested and very happy.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lincoln soon learned to regret the midnight ride. His friends\r\nreproached him; his enemies taunted him. He was convinced that he had\r\ncommitted a grave mistake in yielding to the solicitations of a\r\nprofessional spy and of friends too easily alarmed. He saw that he had\r\nfled from a danger purely imaginary, and felt the shame and\r\nmortification natural to a brave man under such circumstances. But he\r\nwas not disposed to take all the responsibility to himself, and\r\nfrequently upbraided the writer for having aided and assisted him to\r\ndemean himself at the very moment in all his life when his behavior\r\nshould have exhibited the utmost dignity and composure.\r\n\r\n\"The news of his surreptitious entry into Washington occasioned much\r\nand varied comment throughout the country; but important events\r\nfollowed it in such rapid succession that its real significance was\r\nsoon lost sight of; enough that Mr. Lincoln was safely at the Capital,\r\nand in a few days would in all probability assume the power confided\r\nto his hands.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II.\r\n\r\n     EXTRACT FROM THE OPINION OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED\r\n     STATES, DELIVERED BY CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY IN THE CASE OF DRED\r\n     SCOTT _vs._ SANDFORD, 19 HOW. 407.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It is difficult at this day to realize the state of public opinion in\r\nrelation to that unfortunate race\" (the African) \"which prevailed in\r\nthe civilized and enlightened portions of the world at the time of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, and when the Constitution of the United\r\nStates was framed and adopted.\r\n\r\n\"But the public history of every European nation displays it in a\r\nmanner too plain to be mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"They had for more than a century before been regarded as beings of an\r\ninferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race,\r\neither in social or political relations; and so far inferior, that\r\nthey had no rights which the white man was bound to respect; and that\r\nthe negro might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery for his\r\nbenefit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III.\r\n\r\n     THE HABEAS CORPUS CASE EX PARTE JOHN MERRYMAN, CAMPBELL'S\r\n     REPORTS, P. 246. -- OPINION OF THE CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED\r\n     STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Ex parte_     }      Before the Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\n    JOHN MERRYMAN. }      Court of the United States, at Chambers.\r\n\r\nThe application in this case for a writ of _habeas corpus_ is made to\r\nme under the fourteenth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which\r\nrenders effectual for the citizen the constitutional privilege of the\r\nwrit of _habeas corpus_. That act gives to the courts of the United\r\nStates, as well as to each justice of the Supreme Court and to every\r\ndistrict judge, power to grant writs of _habeas corpus_ for the\r\npurpose of an inquiry into the cause of commitment. The petition was\r\npresented to me at Washington, under the impression that I would order\r\nthe prisoner to be brought before me there; but as he was confined in\r\nFort McHenry, in the city of Baltimore, which is in my circuit, I\r\nresolved to hear it in the latter city, as obedience to the writ under\r\nsuch circumstances would not withdraw General Cadwallader, who had him\r\nin charge, from the limits of his military command.\r\n\r\nThe petition presents the following case:\r\n\r\nThe petitioner resides in Maryland, in Baltimore County. While\r\npeaceably in his own house, with his family, it was, at two o'clock on\r\nthe morning of the 25th of May, 1861, entered by an armed force\r\nprofessing to act under military orders. He was then compelled to\r\nrise from his bed, taken into custody and conveyed to Fort McHenry,\r\nwhere he is imprisoned by the commanding officer, without warrant from\r\nany lawful authority.\r\n\r\nThe commander of the fort, General George Cadwallader, by whom he is\r\ndetained in confinement, in his return to the writ, does not deny any\r\nof the facts alleged in the petition. He states that the prisoner was\r\narrested by order of General Keim, of Pennsylvania, and conducted as\r\naforesaid to Fort McHenry by his order, and placed in his (General\r\nCadwallader's) custody, to be there detained by him as a prisoner.\r\n\r\nA copy of the warrant or order under which the prisoner was arrested\r\nwas demanded by his counsel and refused. And it is not alleged in the\r\nreturn that any specific act, constituting any offense against the\r\nlaws of the United States, has been charged against him upon oath; but\r\nhe appears to have been arrested upon general charges of treason and\r\nrebellion, without proof, and without giving the names of the\r\nwitnesses, or specifying the acts which, in the judgment of the\r\nmilitary officer, constituted these crimes. Having the prisoner thus\r\nin custody upon these vague and unsupported accusations, he refuses to\r\nobey the writ of _habeas corpus_, upon the ground that he is duly\r\nauthorized by the President to suspend it.\r\n\r\nThe case, then, is simply this: A military officer, residing in\r\nPennsylvania, issues an order to arrest a citizen of Maryland upon\r\nvague and indefinite charges, without any proof, so far as appears.\r\nUnder this order his house is entered in the night, he is seized as a\r\nprisoner and conveyed to Fort McHenry, and there kept in close\r\nconfinement. And when a _habeas corpus_ is served on the commanding\r\nofficer, requiring him to produce the prisoner before a justice of the\r\nSupreme Court, in order that he may examine into the legality of the\r\nimprisonment, the answer of the officer is that he is authorized by\r\nthe President to suspend the writ of _habeas corpus_ at his\r\ndiscretion, and, in the exercise of that discretion, suspends it in\r\nthis case, and on that ground refuses obedience to the writ.\r\n\r\nAs the case comes before me, therefore, I understand that the\r\nPresident not only claims the right to suspend the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_ himself at his discretion, but to delegate that discretionary\r\npower to a military officer, and to leave it to him to determine\r\nwhether he will or will not obey judicial process that may be served\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nNo official notice has been given to the courts of justice, or to the\r\npublic, by proclamation or otherwise, that the President claimed this\r\npower, and had exercised it in the manner stated in the return. And I\r\ncertainly listened to it with some surprise; for I had supposed it to\r\nbe one of those points of constitutional law upon which there was no\r\ndifference of opinion, and that it was admitted on all hands that the\r\nprivilege of the writ could not be suspended except by act of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nWhen the conspiracy of which Aaron Burr was the head became so\r\nformidable and was so extensively ramified as to justify, in Mr.\r\nJefferson's opinion, the suspension of the writ, he claimed on his\r\npart no power to suspend it, but communicated his opinion to Congress,\r\nwith all the proofs in his possession, in order that Congress might\r\nexercise its discretion upon the subject, and determine whether the\r\npublic safety required it. And in the debate which took place upon the\r\nsubject, no one suggested that Mr. Jefferson might exercise the power\r\nhimself, if, in his opinion, the public safety demanded it.\r\n\r\nHaving therefore regarded the question as too plain and too well\r\nsettled to be open to dispute, if the commanding officer had stated\r\nthat upon his own responsibility, and in the exercise of his own\r\ndiscretion, he refused obedience to the writ, I should have contented\r\nmyself with referring to the clause in the Constitution, and to the\r\nconstruction it received from every jurist and statesman of that day,\r\nwhen the case of Burr was before them. But being thus officially\r\nnotified that the privilege of the writ has been suspended under the\r\norders and by the authority of the President, and believing, as I do,\r\nthat the President has exercised a power which he does not possess\r\nunder the Constitution, a proper respect for the high office he fills\r\nrequires me to state plainly and fully the grounds of my opinion, in\r\norder to show that I have not ventured to question the legality of his\r\nact without a careful and deliberate examination of the whole subject.\r\n\r\nThe clause of the Constitution which authorizes the suspension of the\r\nprivilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ is in the ninth section of\r\nthe first article.\r\n\r\nThis article is devoted to the legislative department of the United\r\nStates, and has not the slightest reference to the Executive\r\nDepartment. It begins by providing \"that all legislative powers\r\ntherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,\r\nwhich shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives\"; and\r\nafter prescribing the manner in which these two branches of the\r\nlegislative department shall be chosen, it proceeds to enumerate\r\nspecifically the legislative powers which it thereby grants, and at\r\nthe conclusion of this specification a clause is inserted giving\r\nCongress \"the power to make all laws which shall be necessary and\r\nproper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other\r\npowers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United\r\nStates, or in any department or office thereof.\"\r\n\r\nThe power of legislation granted by this latter clause is by its words\r\ncarefully confined to the specific objects before enumerated. But as\r\nthis limitation was unavoidably somewhat indefinite, it was deemed\r\nnecessary to guard more effectually certain great cardinal principles\r\nessential to the liberty of the citizen, and to the rights and\r\nequality of the States, by denying to Congress, in express terms, any\r\npower of legislation over them. It was apprehended, it seems, that\r\nsuch legislation might be attempted under the pretext that it was\r\nnecessary and proper to carry into execution the powers granted; and\r\nit was determined that there should be no room to doubt, where rights\r\nof such vital importance were concerned, and accordingly this clause\r\nis immediately followed by an enumeration of certain subjects to which\r\nthe powers of legislation shall not extend. The great importance which\r\nthe framers of the Constitution attached to the privilege of the writ\r\nof _habeas corpus_ to protect the liberty of the citizen, is proved by\r\nthe fact that its suspension, except in cases of invasion or\r\nrebellion, is first in the list of prohibited powers--and even in\r\nthese cases the power is denied and its exercise prohibited, unless\r\nthe public safety shall require it. It is true that in the cases\r\nmentioned, Congress is of necessity the judge of whether the public\r\nsafety does, or does not, require it; and its judgment is conclusive.\r\nBut the introduction of these words is a standing admonition to the\r\nlegislative body of the danger of suspending it, and of the extreme\r\ncaution they should exercise before they give the Government of the\r\nUnited States such power over the liberty of a citizen.\r\n\r\nIt is the second article of the Constitution that provides for the\r\norganization of the Executive Department, and enumerates the powers\r\nconferred on it, and prescribes its duties. And if the high power over\r\nthe liberty of the citizen now claimed was intended to be conferred\r\non the President, it would undoubtedly be found in plain words in this\r\narticle. But there is not a word in it that can furnish the slightest\r\nground to justify the exercise of the power.\r\n\r\nThe article begins by declaring that the executive power shall be\r\nvested in a President of the United States of America, to hold his\r\noffice during the term of four years, and then proceeds to prescribe\r\nthe mode of election, and to specify in precise and plain words the\r\npowers delegated to him, and the duties imposed upon him. The short\r\nterm for which he is elected, and the narrow limits to which his power\r\nis confined, show the jealousy and apprehensions of future danger\r\nwhich the framers of the Constitution felt in relation to that\r\ndepartment of the Government, and how carefully they withheld from it\r\nmany of the powers belonging to the Executive Branch of the English\r\nGovernment which were considered as dangerous to the liberty of the\r\nsubject, and conferred (and that in clear and specific terms) those\r\npowers only which were deemed essential to secure the successful\r\noperation of the Government.\r\n\r\nHe is elected, as I have already said, for the brief term of four\r\nyears, and is made personally responsible by impeachment for\r\nmalfeasance in office. He is from necessity and the nature of his\r\nduties the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia\r\nwhen called into actual service. But no appropriation for the support\r\nof the Army can be made by Congress for a longer term than two years,\r\nso that it is in the power of the succeeding House of Representatives\r\nto withhold the appropriation for its support, and thus disband it,\r\nif, in their judgment, the President used or designed to use it for\r\nimproper purposes. And although the militia, when in actual service,\r\nis under his command, yet the appointment of the officers is reserved\r\nto the States, as a security against the use of the military power for\r\npurposes dangerous to the liberties of the people or the rights of the\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nSo, too, his powers in relation to the civil duties and authority\r\nnecessarily conferred on him are carefully restricted, as well as\r\nthose belonging to his military character. He cannot appoint the\r\nordinary officers of Government, nor make a treaty with a foreign\r\nnation or Indian tribe, without the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nand cannot appoint even inferior officers unless he is authorized by\r\nan Act of Congress to do so. He is not empowered to arrest any one\r\ncharged with an offense against the United States, and whom he may,\r\nfrom the evidence before him, believe to be guilty; nor can he\r\nauthorize any officer, civil or military, to exercise this power; for\r\nthe fifth article of the Amendments to the Constitution expressly\r\nprovides that no person \"shall be deprived of life, liberty or\r\nproperty without due process of law\"--that is, judicial process. Even\r\nif the privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ were suspended by Act\r\nof Congress, and a party not subject to the rules and articles of war\r\nwere afterwards arrested and imprisoned by regular judicial process,\r\nhe could not be detained in prison or brought to trial before a\r\nmilitary tribunal; for the article in the Amendments to the\r\nConstitution immediately following the one above referred to--that is,\r\nthe sixth article--provides that \"in all criminal prosecutions the\r\naccused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial by an\r\nimpartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have\r\nbeen committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained\r\nby law; and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation;\r\nto be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory\r\nprocess for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the\r\nassistance of counsel for his defense.\"\r\n\r\nThe only power, therefore, which the President possesses, where the\r\n\"life, liberty, or property\" of a private citizen is concerned, is the\r\npower and duty prescribed in the third section of the second article,\r\nwhich requires \"that he shall take care that the laws be faithfully\r\nexecuted.\" He is not authorized to execute them himself, or through\r\nagents or officers, civil or military, appointed by himself, but he is\r\nto take care that they be faithfully carried into execution as they\r\nare expounded and adjudged by the co-ordinate branch of the Government\r\nto which that duty is assigned by the Constitution. It is thus made\r\nhis duty to come in aid of the judicial authority, if it shall be\r\nresisted by a force too strong to be overcome without the assistance\r\nof the executive arm. But in exercising this power he acts in\r\nsubordination to judicial authority, assisting it to execute its\r\nprocess and enforce its judgments.\r\n\r\nWith such provisions in the Constitution, expressed in language too\r\nclear to be misunderstood by any one, I can see no ground whatever for\r\nsupposing that the President, in any emergency or in any state of\r\nthings, can authorize the suspension of the privilege of the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_, or the arrest of a citizen, except in aid of the\r\njudicial power. He certainly does not faithfully execute the laws if\r\nhe takes upon himself legislative power by suspending the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_, and the judicial power also, by arresting and\r\nimprisoning a person without due process of law. Nor can any argument\r\nbe drawn from the nature of sovereignty, or the necessity of\r\nGovernment for self-defense in times of tumult and danger. The\r\nGovernment of the United States is one of delegated and limited\r\npowers. It derives its existence and authority altogether from the\r\nConstitution, and neither of its branches, executive, legislative or\r\njudicial, can exercise any of the powers of Government beyond those\r\nspecified and granted. For the tenth article of the Amendments to the\r\nConstitution in express terms provides that \"the powers not delegated\r\nto the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the\r\nStates, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the security against imprisonment by executive authority,\r\nprovided for in the fifth article of the Amendments to the\r\nConstitution, which I have before quoted, is nothing more than a copy\r\nof a like provision in the English Constitution, which had been firmly\r\nestablished before the Declaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nBlackstone states it in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"To make imprisonment lawful, it must be either by process of law from\r\nthe courts of judicature or by warrant from some legal officer having\r\nauthority to commit to prison\" (1 Bl. Com. 137).\r\n\r\nThe people of the United Colonies, who had themselves lived under its\r\nprotection while they were British subjects, were well aware of the\r\nnecessity of this safeguard for their personal liberty. And no one can\r\nbelieve that, in framing a government intended to guard still more\r\nefficiently the rights and liberties of the citizen against executive\r\nencroachments and oppression, they would have conferred on the\r\nPresident a power which the history of England had proved to be\r\ndangerous and oppressive in the hands of the Crown, and which the\r\npeople of England had compelled it to surrender after a long and\r\nobstinate struggle on the part of the English Executive to usurp and\r\nretain it.\r\n\r\nThe right of the subject to the benefit of the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, it must be recollected, was one of the great points in\r\ncontroversy during the long struggle in England between arbitrary\r\ngovernment and free institutions, and must therefore have strongly\r\nattracted the attention of the statesmen engaged in framing a new,\r\nand, as they supposed, a freer government than the one which they had\r\nthrown off by the Revolution. From the earliest history of the common\r\nlaw, if a person were imprisoned, no matter by what authority, he had\r\na right to the writ of _habeas corpus_ to bring his case before the\r\nKing's Bench; if no specific offense were charged against him in the\r\nwarrant of commitment, he was entitled to be forthwith discharged; and\r\nif an offense were charged which was bailable in its character, the\r\nCourt was bound to set him at liberty on bail. The most exciting\r\ncontests between the Crown and the people of England from the time of\r\n_Magna Charta_ were in relation to the privilege of this writ, and\r\nthey continued until the passage of the statute of 31st Charles II,\r\ncommonly known as the Great _Habeas Corpus_ Act. This statute put an\r\nend to the struggle, and finally and firmly secured the liberty of the\r\nsubject against the usurpation and oppression of the executive branch\r\nof the Government. It nevertheless conferred no new right upon the\r\nsubject, but only secured a right already existing. For, although the\r\nright could not justly be denied, there was often no effectual remedy\r\nagainst its violation. Until the statute of 13 William III, the judges\r\nheld their offices at the pleasure of the King, and the influence\r\nwhich he exercised over timid, time-serving and partisan judges often\r\ninduced them, upon some pretext or other, to refuse to discharge the\r\nparty, although entitled by law to his discharge, or delayed their\r\ndecision from time to time, so as to prolong the imprisonment of\r\npersons who were obnoxious to the King for their political opinions,\r\nor had incurred his resentment in any other way.\r\n\r\nThe great and inestimable value of the _habeas corpus_ act of the 31st\r\nCharles II. is that it contains provisions which compel courts and\r\njudges, and all parties concerned, to perform their duties promptly in\r\nthe manner specified in the statute.\r\n\r\nA passage in Blackstone's Commentaries, showing the ancient state of\r\nthe law on this subject, and the abuses which were practised through\r\nthe power and influence of the Crown, and a short extract from\r\nHallam's \"Constitutional History,\" stating the circumstances which\r\ngave rise to the passage of this statute, explain briefly, but fully,\r\nall that is material to this subject.\r\n\r\nBlackstone says: \"To assert an absolute exemption from imprisonment in\r\nall cases is inconsistent with every idea of law and political\r\nsociety, and, in the end, would destroy all civil liberty by rendering\r\nits protection impossible.\r\n\r\n\"But the glory of the English law consists in clearly defining the\r\ntimes, the causes and the extent, when, wherefore and to what degree\r\nthe imprisonment of the subject may be lawful. This it is which\r\ninduces the absolute necessity of expressing upon every commitment the\r\nreason for which it is made, \"that the court upon a _habeas corpus_\r\nmay examine into its validity, and, according to the circumstances of\r\nthe case, may discharge, admit to bail, or remand the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"And yet, early in the reign of Charles I, the Court of King's Bench,\r\nrelying on some arbitrary precedents (and those, perhaps,\r\nmisunderstood), determined that they would not, upon a _habeas\r\ncorpus_, either bail or deliver a prisoner, though committed without\r\nany cause assigned, in case he was committed by the special command of\r\nthe King, or by the Lords of the Privy Council. This drew on a\r\nParliamentary inquiry and produced the Petition of Right--3 Charles\r\nI.--which recites this illegal judgment, and enacts that no freeman\r\nhereafter shall be so imprisoned or detained. But when, in the\r\nfollowing year, Mr. Selden and others were committed by the Lords of\r\nthe Council, in pursuance of His Majesty's special command, under a\r\ngeneral charge of 'notable contempts, and stirring up sedition against\r\nthe King and the Government,' the judges delayed for two terms\r\n(including also the long vacation) to deliver an opinion how far such\r\na charge was bailable. And when at length they agreed that it was,\r\nthey, however, annexed a condition of finding sureties for their good\r\nbehavior, which still protracted their imprisonment, the Chief\r\nJustice, Sir Nicholas Hyde, at the same time declaring that 'if they\r\nwere again remanded for that cause, perhaps the court would not\r\nafterwards grant a _habeas corpus_, being already made acquainted with\r\nthe cause of the imprisonment.' But this was heard with indignation\r\nand astonishment by every lawyer present, according to Mr. Selden's\r\nown account of the matter, whose resentment was not cooled at the\r\ndistance of four-and-twenty years\" (3 Bl. Com. 133, 134).\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that the offenses charged against the prisoner\r\nin this case, and relied on as a justification for his arrest and\r\nimprisonment, in their nature and character, and in the loose and\r\nvague manner in which they are stated, bear a striking resemblance to\r\nthose assigned in the warrant for the arrest of Mr. Selden. And yet,\r\neven at that day, the warrant was regarded as such a flagrant\r\nviolation of the rights of the subject, that the delay of the\r\ntime-serving judges to set him at liberty upon the _habeas corpus_\r\nissued in his behalf excited universal indignation of the bar. The\r\nextract from Hallam's \"Constitutional History\" is equally impressive\r\nand equally in point:\r\n\r\n\"It is a very common mistake, and that not only among foreigners, but\r\nmany from whom some knowledge of our constitutional laws might be\r\nexpected, to suppose that this statute of Charles II. enlarged in a\r\ngreat degree our liberties, and forms a sort of epoch in their\r\nhistory. But though a very beneficial enactment, and eminently\r\nremedial in many cases of illegal imprisonment, it introduced no new\r\nprinciple, nor conferred any right upon the subject. From the earliest\r\nrecords of the English law, no freeman could be detained in prison,\r\nexcept upon a criminal charge, or conviction, or for a civil debt. In\r\nthe former case it was always in his power to demand of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench a writ of _habeas corpus ad subjiciendum_, directed to\r\nthe person detaining him in custody, by which he was enjoined to bring\r\nup the body of the prisoner with the warrant of commitment, that the\r\ncourt might judge of its sufficiency, and remand the party, admit him\r\nto bail, or discharge him, according to the nature of the charge. This\r\nwrit issued of right, and could not be refused by the court. It was\r\nnot to bestow an immunity from arbitrary imprisonment--which is\r\nabundantly provided for in _Magna Charta_ (if, indeed, it is not more\r\nancient)--that the statute of Charles II. was enacted, but to cut off\r\nthe abuses by which the Government's lust of power, and the servile\r\nsubtlety of the Crown lawyers, had impaired so fundamental a\r\nprivilege\" (3 Hallam's \"Const. Hist.,\" 19).\r\n\r\nWhile the value set upon this writ in England has been so great that\r\nthe removal of the abuses which embarrassed its employment has been\r\nlooked upon as almost a new grant of liberty to the subject, it is not\r\nto be wondered at that the continuance of the writ thus made effective\r\nshould have been the object of the most jealous care. Accordingly, no\r\npower in England short of that of Parliament can suspend or authorize\r\nthe suspension of the writ of _habeas corpus_. I quote again from\r\nBlackstone (1 Bl. Com. 136): \"But the happiness of our Constitution is\r\nthat it is not left to the executive power to determine when the\r\ndanger of the State is so great as to render this measure expedient.\r\nIt is the Parliament only, or legislative power, that, whenever it\r\nsees proper, can authorize the Crown, by suspending the _habeas\r\ncorpus_ for a short and limited time, to imprison suspected persons\r\nwithout giving any reason for so doing.\" If the President of the\r\nUnited States may suspend the writ, then the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States has conferred upon him more regal and absolute power\r\nover the liberty of the citizen than the people of England have\r\nthought it safe to entrust to the Crown--a power which the Queen of\r\nEngland cannot exercise at this day, and which could not have been\r\nlawfully exercised by the sovereign even in the reign of Charles I.\r\n\r\nBut I am not left to form my judgment upon this great question from\r\nanalogies between the English Government and our own, or the\r\ncommentaries of English jurists, or the decisions of English courts,\r\nalthough upon this subject they are entitled to the highest respect,\r\nand are justly regarded and received as authoritative by our courts of\r\njustice. To guide me to a right conclusion, I have the Commentaries on\r\nthe Constitution of the United States of the late Mr. Justice Story,\r\nnot only one of the most eminent jurists of the age, but for a long\r\ntime one of the brightest ornaments of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, and also the clear and authoritative decision of that court\r\nitself, given more than half a century since, and conclusively\r\nestablishing the principles I have above stated.\r\n\r\nMr. Justice Story, speaking in his Commentaries of the _habeas corpus_\r\nclause in the Constitution, says: \"It is obvious that cases of a\r\npeculiar emergency may arise which may justify, nay, even require, the\r\ntemporary suspension of any right to the writ. But as it has\r\nfrequently happened in foreign countries, and even in England, that\r\nthe writ has, upon various pretexts and occasions, been suspended,\r\nwhereby persons apprehended upon suspicion have suffered a long\r\nimprisonment, sometimes from design, and sometimes because they were\r\nforgotten, the right to suspend it is expressly confined to cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, where the public safety may require it. A very\r\njust and wholesome restraint, which cuts down at a blow a fruitful\r\nmeans of oppression, capable of being abused in bad times to the worst\r\nof purposes. Hitherto no suspension of the writ has ever been\r\nauthorized by Congress since the establishment of the Constitution. It\r\nwould seem, as the power is given to Congress to suspend the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_ in cases of rebellion or invasion, that the right to\r\njudge whether the exigency had arisen must exclusively belong to that\r\nbody\" (3 Story's Com. on the Constitution, Section 1836).\r\n\r\nAnd Chief Justice Marshall, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme\r\nCourt in the case of _ex parte_ Bollman and Swartwout, uses this\r\ndecisive language in 4 Cranch 95: \"It may be worthy of remark that\r\nthis Act (speaking of the one under which I am proceeding) was passed\r\nby the first Congress of the United States, sitting under a\r\nConstitution which had declared 'that the privilege of the writ of\r\n_habeas corpus_ should not be suspended unless when, in cases of\r\nrebellion or invasion, the public safety might require it.' Acting\r\nunder the immediate influence of this injunction, they must have felt\r\nwith peculiar force the obligation of providing efficient means by\r\nwhich this great constitutional privilege should receive life and\r\nactivity; for if the means be not in existence, the privilege itself\r\nwould be lost, although no law for its suspension should be enacted.\r\nUnder the impression of this obligation, they give to all the courts\r\nthe power of awarding writs of _habeas corpus_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again, on page 101: \"If at any time the public safety should\r\nrequire the suspension of the powers vested by this Act in the courts\r\nof the United States, it is for the Legislature to say so. That\r\nquestion depends on political considerations, on which the Legislature\r\nis to decide. Until the legislative will be expressed, this court can\r\nonly see its duty, and must obey the laws.\"\r\n\r\nI can add nothing to these clear and emphatic words of my great\r\npredecessor. But the documents before me show that the military\r\nauthority in this case has gone far beyond the mere suspension of the\r\nprivilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_. It has, by force of arms,\r\nthrust aside the judicial authorities and officers to whom the\r\nConstitution has confided the power and duty of interpreting and\r\nadministering the laws, and substituted a military government in its\r\nplace, to be administered and executed by military officers. For, at\r\nthe time these proceedings were had against John Merryman, the\r\ndistrict judge of Maryland, the commissioner appointed under the Act\r\nof Congress, the district attorney and the marshal, all resided in the\r\ncity of Baltimore, a few miles only from the home of the prisoner. Up\r\nto that time there had never been the slightest resistance or\r\nobstruction to the process of any court or judicial officer of the\r\nUnited States in Maryland, except by the military authority. And if a\r\nmilitary officer, or any other person, had reason to believe that the\r\nprisoner had committed any offense against the laws of the United\r\nStates, it was his duty to give information of the fact, and the\r\nevidence to support it, to the district attorney; it would then have\r\nbecome the duty of that officer to bring the matter before the\r\ndistrict judge or commissioner, and if there was sufficient legal\r\nevidence to justify his arrest, the judge or commissioner would have\r\nissued his warrant to the marshal to arrest him, and upon the hearing\r\nof the case would have held him to bail, or committed him for trial,\r\naccording to the character of the offense as it appeared in the\r\ntestimony, or would have discharged him immediately, if there was not\r\nsufficient evidence to support the accusation. There was no danger of\r\nany obstruction or resistance to the action of the civil authorities,\r\nand therefore no reason whatever for the interposition of the\r\nmilitary. Yet, under these circumstances, a military officer stationed\r\nin Pennsylvania, without giving any information to the district\r\nattorney, and without any application to the judicial authorities,\r\nassumes to himself the judicial power in the District of Maryland;\r\nundertakes to decide what constitutes the crime of treason or\r\nrebellion; what evidence (if, indeed, he required any) is sufficient\r\nto support the accusation and justify the commitment; and commits the\r\nparty without a hearing, even before himself, to close custody in a\r\nstrongly garrisoned fort, to be there held, it would seem, during the\r\npleasure of those who committed him.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution provides, as I have before said, that \"no person\r\nshall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of\r\nlaw.\" It declares that \"the right of the people to be secure in their\r\npersons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and\r\nseizures shall not be violated, and no warrant shall issue, but upon\r\nprobable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly\r\ndescribing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\r\nseized.\" It provides that the party accused shall be entitled to a\r\nspeedy trial in a court of justice.\r\n\r\nThese great and fundamental laws, which Congress itself could not\r\nsuspend, have been disregarded and suspended, like the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, by a military order, supported by force of arms. Such is the\r\ncase now before me, and I can only say that if the authority which the\r\nConstitution has confided to the judiciary department and judicial\r\nofficers may thus upon any pretext or under any circumstances be\r\nusurped by the military power at its discretion, the people of the\r\nUnited States are no longer living under a government of laws, but\r\nevery citizen holds life, liberty and property at the will and\r\npleasure of the army officer in whose military district he may happen\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\nIn such a case my duty was too plain to be mistaken. I have exercised\r\nall the power which the Constitution and laws confer upon me, but that\r\npower has been resisted by a force too strong for me to overcome. It\r\nis possible that the officer who has incurred this grave\r\nresponsibility may have misunderstood his instructions and exceeded\r\nthe authority intended to be given him. I shall therefore order all\r\nthe proceedings in this case, with my opinion, to be filed and\r\nrecorded in the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of\r\nMaryland, and direct the clerk to transmit a copy, under seal, to the\r\nPresident of the United States. It will then remain for that high\r\nofficer, in fulfilment of his constitutional obligation, to \"take care\r\nthat the laws be faithfully executed,\" to determine what measures he\r\nwill take to cause the civil process of the United States to be\r\nrespected and enforced.\r\n\r\n                                                          R.

The first paragraph and the concluding\r\nparagraphs of this document are here inserted:\r\n\r\n                    \"THE MAYOR'S MESSAGE.\r\n\r\n     \"TO THE HONORABLE THE MEMBERS OF THE\r\n      FIRST AND SECOND BRANCHES OF THE CITY COUNCIL.\r\n\r\n     \"_Gentlemen_:--A great object of the reform movement was to\r\n     separate municipal affairs entirely from national politics, and\r\n     in accordance with this principle I have heretofore, in all my\r\n     communications to the city council, carefully refrained from any\r\n     allusion to national affairs. I shall not now depart from this\r\n     rule further than is rendered absolutely necessary by the\r\n     unprecedented condition of things at present existing in this\r\n     city....\r\n\r\n     \"After the board of police had been superseded, and its members\r\n     arrested by the order of General Banks, I proposed, in order to\r\n     relieve the serious complication which had arisen, to proceed, as\r\n     the only member left free to act, to exercise the power of the\r\n     board as far as an individual member could do so. Marshal Kane,\r\n     while he objected to the propriety of this course, was prepared\r\n     to place his resignation in my hands whenever I should request\r\n     it, and the majority of the board interposed no objection to my\r\n     pursuing such course as I might deem it right and proper to\r\n     adopt in view of the existing circumstances, and upon my own\r\n     responsibility, until the board should be enabled to resume the\r\n     exercise of its functions.\r\n\r\n     \"If this arrangement could have been effected, it would have\r\n     continued in the exercise of their duties the police force which\r\n     is lawfully enrolled, and which has won the confidence and\r\n     applause of all good citizens by its fidelity and impartiality at\r\n     all times and under all circumstances. But the arrangement was\r\n     not satisfactory to the Federal authorities.\r\n\r\n     \"As the men of the police force, through no fault of theirs, are\r\n     now prevented from discharging their duty, their pay constitutes\r\n     a legal claim on the city from which, in my opinion, it cannot be\r\n     relieved.\r\n\r\n     \"The force which has been enrolled is in direct violation of the\r\n     law of the State, and no money can be appropriated by the city\r\n     for its support without incurring the heavy penalties provided by\r\n     the Act of Assembly.\r\n\r\n     \"Officers in the Fire Alarm and Police Telegraph Department who\r\n     are appointed by the mayor and city council, and not by the board\r\n     of police, have been discharged and others have been substituted\r\n     in their place.\r\n\r\n     \"I mention these facts with profound sorrow, and with no purpose\r\n     whatever of increasing the difficulties unfortunately existing in\r\n     this city, but because it is your right to be acquainted with the\r\n     true condition of affairs, and because I cannot help entertaining\r\n     the hope that redress will yet be afforded by the authorities of\r\n     the United States upon a proper representation made by you. I am\r\n     entirely satisfied that the suspicion entertained of any\r\n     meditated hostility on the part of the city authorities against\r\n     the General Government is wholly unfounded, and with the best\r\n     means of knowledge express the confident belief and conviction\r\n     that there is no organization of any kind among the people for\r\n     such a purpose. I have no doubt that the officers of the United\r\n     States have acted on information which they deemed reliable,\r\n     obtained from our own citizens, some of whom may be deluded by\r\n     their fears, while others are actuated by baser motives; but\r\n     suspicions thus derived can, in my judgment, form no sufficient\r\n     justification for what I deem to be grave and alarming violations\r\n     of the rights of individual citizens of the city of Baltimore and\r\n     of the State of Maryland.\r\n\r\n     \"Very respectfully,\r\n                                            \"GEO.

BROWN, _Mayor_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX V.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a part of the history of the times, it may not be inappropriate to\r\nreproduce an account, taken from the Baltimore American of December 5,\r\n1860, of the reception of the Putnam Phalanx of Hartford, Connecticut,\r\nin the city of Baltimore. At this time it still seemed to most men of\r\nmoderate views that the impending troubles might be averted through\r\nconcessions and compromise. In the tone of the two speeches, both of\r\nwhich were, of course, meant to be friendly and conciliatory, there is\r\na difference to be noted which was, I think, characteristic of the\r\nattitude of the two sections; in the one speech some prominence is\r\ngiven to the Constitution and constitutional rights; in the other,\r\nloyalty to the Union is the theme enforced:\r\n\r\n\"The Putnam Phalanx of Hartford, Connecticut, under the command of\r\nMajor Horace Goodwin, yesterday afternoon reached here, at four\r\no'clock, by the Philadelphia train, _en route_ for a visit to the tomb\r\nof Washington. A detachment of the Eagle Artillery gave them a\r\nnational salute.\r\n\r\n\"The Battalion Baltimore City Guards, consisting of four companies,\r\nunder the command of Major Joseph P. Warner, were drawn up on\r\nBroadway, and after passing in salute, the column moved by way of\r\nBroadway and Baltimore and Calvert streets to the old Universalist\r\nchurch-building.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the military entered the edifice and were seated, the\r\ngalleries were thrown open to the public, and in a few minutes they\r\nwere crowded to overflowing.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Parks introduced Major Goodwin to Mayor Brown, who was in\r\nturn introduced to the commissioned officers of the Phalanx. Major\r\nGoodwin then turned to his command and said: 'Gentlemen of the\r\nPhalanx, I have the honor of introducing you to the Mayor of the city\r\nof Baltimore.' Mayor Brown arose, and after bowing to the Battalion,\r\naddressed them as follows:\r\n\r\n\"MAYOR BROWN'S SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\"'_Mr. Commander and Gentlemen_:--In the name and on behalf of the\r\npeople of Baltimore, I extend to the Putnam Phalanx a sincere and\r\nhearty welcome to the hospitalities of our city. The citizens of\r\nBaltimore are always glad to receive visits from the citizen-soldiers\r\nof sister States, because they come as friends, and more than\r\nfriends--as the defenders of a common country.\r\n\r\n\"'These sister States, as we love to call them, live somewhat far\r\napart, and gradually become more and more separated by distance, just\r\nas sisters will be as the children marry and one by one leave the\r\nparent homestead.\r\n\r\n\"'But, gentlemen, far or near, on the Connecticut or Potomac, on the\r\nGulf of Mexico or the great lakes, on the Atlantic or Pacific, they\r\nare sisters still, united by blood and affection, and the holy tie\r\nshould never be severed. (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\"'Let me carry the figure a step further, and add what I know will\r\nmeet with a response from the Putnam Phalanx, with whose history and\r\nhigh character I am somewhat acquainted--that a sisterhood of States,\r\nlike separate families of sisters living in the same neighborhood, can\r\nnever dwell together in peace unless each is permitted to manage her\r\nown domestic affairs in her own way (applause); not only without\r\nactive interference from the rest, but even without much fault-finding\r\nor advice, however well intended it may be.\r\n\r\n\"'Maryland has sometimes been called the Heart State, because she lies\r\nvery close to the great heart of the Union; and she might also be\r\ncalled the Heart State because her heart beats with true and warm love\r\nfor the Union. (Loud applause.) Nor, as I trust, does Connecticut fall\r\nshort of her in this respect. And when the questions now before the\r\ncountry come to be fairly understood, and the people look into them\r\nwith their own eyes, and take matters into their own hands, I believe\r\nthat we shall see a sight of which politicians, North and South,\r\nlittle dream. (Applause.) We shall see whether there is a love for the\r\nUnion or not.\r\n\r\n\"'But there are great national questions agitating the land which must\r\nnow be finally settled. One is, Will the States of the North keep on\r\ntheir statute-books laws which violate a right of the States of the\r\nSouth, guaranteed to them by the Constitution of the United States? No\r\nindividuals, no families, no States, can live in peace together when\r\nany right of a part is persistently and deliberately violated by the\r\nrest. Another question is, What shall be done with the national\r\nterritory? Shall it belong exclusively to the North or the South, or\r\nshall it be shared by both, as it was gained by the blood and treasure\r\nof both? Are there not wisdom and patriotism enough in the land to\r\nsettle these questions?\r\n\r\n\"'Gentlemen, your presence here to-day proves that you are animated by\r\na higher and larger sentiment than that of State pride--the sentiment\r\nof American nationality. The most sacred spot in America is the tomb\r\nof Washington, and to that shrine you are about to make a pilgrimage.\r\nYou come from a State celebrated above all others for the most\r\nextensive diffusion of the great blessing of education; which has a\r\ncolonial and Revolutionary history abounding in honorable memorials;\r\nwhich has heretofore done her full share in founding the institutions\r\nof this country--the land of Washington--and which can now do as much\r\nas any other in preserving that land one and undivided, as it was left\r\nby the Father of his Country. I will not permit myself to doubt that\r\nyour State and our State, that Connecticut and Maryland, will both be\r\non the same side, as they have often been in times past, and that they\r\nwill both respect and obey and uphold the sacred Constitution of the\r\ncountry.' (Shouts of applause.)\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the Mayor concluded, Major Goodwin arose; but it was some\r\ntime before he could be heard, such was the tremendous applause with\r\nwhich he was greeted. The Major is nearly ninety years of age, and is\r\none of the most venerable-looking men in the country. Dressed in the\r\nold Revolutionary uniform, a _fac-simile_ of that worn by General\r\nPutnam, and with his locks silvered with age, we may say that his\r\nappearance electrified the multitude, and shout after shout shook the\r\nvery building. Major Goodwin expressed himself as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Mayor and gentlemen of the Baltimore City Guards, permit me to\r\nintroduce to you our Judge Advocate, Captain Stuart.'\r\n\r\n\"Captain Stuart arose and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"SPEECH OF CAPTAIN STUART.\r\n\r\n\"'Your Honor, Mayor Brown: For your kind words of welcome, and for\r\nyour patriotic sentiments in favor of the Union, the Putnam Phalanx\r\nreturns you its most cordial thanks. I can assure you, sir, that when\r\nyou spoke in such eloquent terms of the value and importance of a\r\nunited country, you but echoed the sentiments of the whole of our\r\norganization; and let me say, it is with great pleasure, upon a\r\njourney, as we are, to the tomb of the illustrious Washington; that we\r\npause for a while within a city so famed for its intelligence, its\r\nindustry, its general opulence and its courtesy, as is this your own\r\nbeautiful Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\"'We opine, nay, we know from what you have yourself, in such fitting\r\nterms, just expressed, that you heartily appreciate the purpose which\r\nlies at the foundation of our organization, that purpose being the\r\nlofty one of commemorating, by our military attire and discipline, the\r\nimposing foundation-period of the American Republic, of attracting our\r\nown patriotic feeling, and that of all who may honor us with their\r\nobservation, to the exalted virtues of those heroic men who laid the\r\nfoundations of our present national prosperity and glory--men of whom\r\nyour city and State furnished, as it pleasantly happens, a large and\r\nmost honorable share.\r\n\r\n\"'We come, sir, from that portion of the United States in which the\r\nmomentous struggle for American freedom took its rise, and where the\r\nblood of its earliest martyrs was shed; from the region where odious\r\nwrits of assistance, infamous Courts of Admiralty, intolerable\r\ntaxation, immolated charters of government and prohibited commerce\r\nwere once fast paving the way for the slavery of our institutions;\r\nfrom the region of a happy and God-fearing people--from the region,\r\nsir, of Lexington and Concord and Bunker Hill and Croton Heights, of\r\nravaged New London and fired Fairfield and Norwalk and devastated\r\nDanbury and sacked New Haven. And we come, Mr. Mayor, to a city and\r\nState, we are proudly aware, which to all these trials and perils of\r\nassaulted New England, and to the trials and perils of our whole\r\ncommon country, during \"the times that tried men's souls,\" gave ever\r\nthe meed of its heartfelt sympathy, and the unstinted tribute of its\r\npatriotic blood and treasure; which, with a full and clear\r\ncomprehension of all the great principles of American freedom, and a\r\ndevotion to those principles that was ever ardent and exalted,\r\nsignalized themselves by their wisdom in council and their prowess on\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\n\"'When the devoted metropolis of New England began to feel the awful\r\nscourge of the Writ Bill, Maryland it was that then contributed most\r\nliberal supplies for its suffering people, and with these supplies\r\nthose cheering, ever-to-be-remembered, talismanic words: \"The Supreme\r\nDirector of all events will terminate this severe trial of your\r\npatriotism in the happy confirmation of American freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"'When this same metropolis soon after became the seat of war,\r\nMaryland it was that at once sent to the camp around Boston her own\r\ncompanies of \"dauntless riflemen,\" under her brave Michael Cresap and\r\nthe gallant Price, to mingle in the defense of New England firesides\r\nand New England homes. She saw and felt, and bravely uttered at the\r\ntime, the fact that in the then existing state of public affairs there\r\nwas no alternative left for her, or for the country at large, but\r\n\"base submission or manly resistance\"; and, Mr. Mayor, at the\r\nmemorable battle of Long Island she made this manly resistance, for\r\nthere she poured out the life-blood of no less than two hundred and\r\nfifty-nine of her gallant sons, who fought in her own Smallwood's\r\nimmortal regiment; and elsewhere, from the St. Lawrence to the banks\r\nof the Savannah, through Pennsylvania, Virginia and both the\r\nCarolinas--devoted the best blood within her borders, and the flower\r\nof her soldiery, to the battlefields of the Union.\r\n\r\n\"'Sir, we of this Phalanx recall these and other Revolutionary\r\nmemories belonging to your city and State with pride and satisfaction.\r\nThey unite Connecticut and Maryland in strong and pleasant bonds. And\r\nwe are highly gratified to be here in the midst of them, and to\r\nreceive at your hands so grateful a welcome as that which you have\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n\"'Be assured, Mr. Mayor, that in the sentiments of devotion to our\r\ncommon country which you so eloquently express, this Phalanx\r\nsympathizes heart and soul. You may plant the flag of the Union\r\nanywhere and we shall warm to it. And now, renewedly thanking you for\r\nthe present manifestation of courtesy, we shall leave to enjoy the\r\nhospitality which awaits us in pleasant quarters at our hotel.'\r\n\r\n\"Captain Stuart was frequently interrupted by applause.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of April, 1880, a portion of the members of the Sixth\r\nMassachusetts Regiment again visited Baltimore, and an account of its\r\nreception, taken from the Baltimore Sun and the Baltimore _American_,\r\nseems to be a fitting close to this paper:\r\n\r\n\"Thirty-nine members of the Association of Survivors of the Sixth\r\nMassachusetts Union Regiment came to Baltimore yesterday afternoon, to\r\ncelebrate the nineteenth anniversary of their march through Baltimore,\r\nApril 19, 1861, which gave rise to the riot of that day. The visitors\r\nwere met, on landing from the cars at President-street Depot, by\r\nWilson, Dushane and Harry Howard Posts, Grand Army of the Republic, in\r\nfull uniform, with band and drum corps. The line was up Broadway to\r\nBaltimore street, to Barnum's Hotel. A file of policemen, with\r\nMarshals Gray and Frey, kept the street open for the parade. The\r\nstreets were crowded with people. The Massachusetts men wore citizen's\r\ndress and badges.\"\r\n\r\nWilson Post No. 1, of the Grand Army of the Republic, received the\r\nvisitors in their hall, Rialto Building, at two o'clock. Commander\r\nDukehart, of Wilson Post, welcomed the guests in a brief speech, and\r\nthen introduced Comrade Crowley, of the old Sixth, who said:\r\n\r\n\"'Nineteen years ago I was but a boy. A few days before the 19th of\r\nApril, the militia of Middlesex County were summoned for the defense\r\nof the National Capital. We left workshops, desk and family, to come\r\nto the defense of the capital. We thought we were coming to a picnic;\r\nthat the people of South Carolina were a little off their balance,\r\nand would be all right on sober second thought. A few miles out from\r\nBaltimore the Quartermaster gave us each ten rounds of ammunition. We\r\nhad been singing songs. The Colonel told us he expected trouble in\r\nBaltimore, and impressed on each man not to fire until he was\r\ncompelled to. The singing ceased, and we then thought we had serious\r\nbusiness before us, and that others besides South Carolina had lost\r\ntheir balance. When we reached the Baltimore Depot some of the cars\r\nhad gone ahead, and four companies--young men--were in the cars\r\nunconscious of what was going on outside. We thought the people of\r\nBaltimore and Maryland were of the same Government, and if not they\r\nought to be. (Cheers and applause.) That they had the same interest in\r\nthe Government, the best ever devised; that Maryland at least was\r\nloyal. A man knocked on the car-door and told us they were tearing up\r\nthe track. Our Captain said, \"Men, file out!\" The order was given and\r\nwe marched out. The Captain said, \"March as close as you possibly can.\r\nFire on no man unless compelled.\" We marched through railroad iron,\r\nbricks and other missiles. We proved ourselves brave soldiers--proved\r\nthat we could wait, at least, for the word of command. We were pelted\r\nin Baltimore nineteen years ago. We lost some of our comrades, and\r\nothers were disabled for life. But we went to Washington. We don't\r\nclaim to be the saviors of the capital; we take no great credit for\r\nwhat we did; but we did the best we could, and the result is shown.\r\nThe success of our march through Baltimore to-day is as indelibly\r\nfixed and will ever be as fresh as that of nineteen years ago, and our\r\nreception will remain in our hearts and minds as long as life lasts.\r\nMy father had six sons, and five were at the front at the same time.\r\nI had learned to think that if Maryland, South Carolina or Virginia\r\nwas to declare independence the Government would be broken up, and\r\nthat we would have no country, no home, no flag. We were not fighting\r\nfor Massachusetts, for Maryland or for Virginia, but for our\r\ncountry--the United States (cheers and applause)--remembering the\r\ndeclaration of the great statesman, \"Liberty and Union, now and\r\nforever, one and inseparable.\" This country went through four years of\r\ncarnage and blood. Few families, North or South, but have mourning at\r\ntheir firesides; but it was not in vain, for it has established the\r\nfact that we are one people, and are an all-powerful people.\r\n(Prolonged cheers.) Our reception to-day has convinced us that the war\r\nhas ended, and that there are Union men in Maryland as in\r\nMassachusetts; that we are brothers, and will be so to the end of\r\ntime; that this is one great country; and that the people are marching\r\non in amity and power, second to none on the face of the globe.'\r\n(Cheers.)\r\n\r\n\"In the evening there was a banquet at the Eutaw House, and Judge Geo.\r\nWilliam Brown, who was Mayor of Baltimore in 1861, presided. Nearly\r\ntwo hundred persons were at table. After the dinner was over, Judge\r\nBrown said:\r\n\r\n\"'This is the 19th of April, a day memorable in the annals of this\r\ncity, and in the annals of the country. It is filled in my mind with\r\nthe most painful recollections of my life, and I doubt not that many\r\nwho are here present share with me those feelings. I shall make but\r\nbrief allusions to the events of that day. The city authorities of\r\nBaltimore of that time have mostly passed away, and I believe I am the\r\nonly one here present to-night. In justice to the living and the dead\r\nI have to say that the authorities of Baltimore faithfully endeavored\r\nto do their duty. It is not necessary for me, perhaps, to say so in\r\nthis presence. (Applause.) It was not their fault that the\r\nMassachusetts Sixth Regiment met a bloody reception in the streets of\r\nBaltimore. The visit of that regiment on both occasions has a great\r\nand important significance. What did it mean in 1861? It meant civil\r\nwar; that the irrepressible conflict which Mr. Seward predicted had\r\nbroken out at last, and that, as Mr. Lincoln said, a house divided\r\nagainst itself cannot stand. A great question then presented itself to\r\nthe country. When war virtually began in Baltimore, by bloodshed on\r\nboth sides, it meant that the question must be settled by force\r\nwhether or not the house should stand. It took four years of war,\r\nwaged with indomitable perseverance, to decide it, because the\r\ncombatants on both sides were sustained by deep and honest\r\nconvictions. It is not surprising, looking back coolly and calmly on\r\nthe feelings of that day, that they found vent as they did. I am not\r\nhere to excuse or to apologize, but to acknowledge facts. That was the\r\nsignificance of the first visit of the Massachusetts Sixth Regiment,\r\nin response to the call of the President of the United States. After\r\nthe war there was peace. But enforced peace is not sufficient in a\r\nfamily of States any more than in a household. There must be among\r\nbrothers respect, confidence, mutual help and forbearance, and, above\r\neverything, justice and right. After nineteen years the visit of\r\nsurvivors of the Sixth Massachusetts is, I hope, significant of more\r\nthan peace. It is, I hope, significant of the fact that there is a\r\ntrue bond of union between the North and the South (applause), and\r\nthat we are a family of States, all equal, all friends; and if it be,\r\nthere is no one in the country who can more fervently thank God than\r\nmyself that the old house still stands.' (Applause.)\r\n\r\n\"Judge Brown offered as a toast: 'The Sixth Regiment of Massachusetts:\r\nBaltimore extends to her fraternal greeting.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n   A\r\n\r\n  Acton, regiment mustered in, 42.\r\n\r\n  Allen, E.

ALLINSON, A. M., AND BOIES PENROSE, A. B., OF THE\r\nPHILADELPHIA BAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile several general histories of Philadelphia have been written,\r\nthere is no history of that city as a municipal corporation. Such a\r\nwork is now offered, based upon the Acts of Assembly, the City\r\nOrdinances, the State Reports, and many other authorities. Numerous\r\nmanuscripts in the Pennsylvania Historical Society, in Public\r\nLibraries, and in the Departments at Philadelphia and Harrisburg have\r\nalso been consulted, and important facts found therein are now for the\r\nfirst time published.\r\n\r\nThe development of the government of Philadelphia affords a peculiarly\r\ninteresting study, and is full of instruction to the student of\r\nmunicipal questions. The first charter granted by the original\r\nproprietor, William Penn, created a close, self-elected corporation,\r\nconsisting of the \"Mayor, Recorder and Common Council,\" holding office\r\nfor life. Such corporations survived in England from medieval times to\r\nthe passage of the Reform Act of 1835. The corporation of Philadelphia\r\npossessed practically no power of taxation, and few and extremely\r\nlimited powers of any kind. As a rapidly growing city required greater\r\nmunicipal powers, the legislature instead of increasing the powers of\r\nthe corporation which, being self-elected, was held in distrust by\r\nthe citizens, established from time to time various independent\r\nboards, commissions, and trusts for the control of taxation, streets,\r\npoor, etc. These boards were subsequently transformed into the city\r\ndepartments as they exist to-day. The State and municipal legislation,\r\nextending over two centuries, is extremely varied and frequently\r\nexperimental. It affords instruction illustrative of almost every form\r\nof municipal expedient and constitution.\r\n\r\nThe development of the city government of Philadelphia has been\r\ncarefully traced through many changes in the powers and duties of the\r\nmayor, in the election and powers of the subordinate executive\r\nofficers, in the position and relation of the various departments, in\r\nthe legislative and executive powers of councils, in the frequently\r\nshifting distribution of executive power between the mayor and\r\ncouncils, and in the procedure of councils. _In 1885 an Act of\r\nAssembly was passed providing for a new government for Philadelphia\r\nwhich embodies the latest ideas upon municipal questions._\r\n\r\nThe history of the government of the city thus begins with the\r\nmedieval charter of most contracted character, and ends with _the\r\nliberal provisions of the Reform Act of 1885_. It furnishes\r\nillustrations of almost every phase of municipal development. The\r\nstory cannot fail to interest all those who believe that the question\r\nof better government for our great cities is one of critical\r\nimportance, and who are aware of the fact that this question is\r\nalready receiving widespread attention. The subject had become so\r\nserious in 1876 that Governor Hartranft, in his message of that year,\r\ncalled the attention of the Legislature to it in the following\r\nsuccinct and forcible statement: \"_There is no political problem that\r\nat the present moment occasions so much just alarm and is obtaining\r\nmore anxious thought than the government of cities._\"\r\n\r\nThe consideration of the subject naturally resolves itself into five\r\nsharply-defined periods, to each of which a chapter has been devoted,\r\nas indicated by the following summary, which, while not exhaustive,\r\nwill suggest the general scope.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I. FIRST PERIOD, 1681-1701. -- Founding of the city. --\r\n     Functions of the Provincial Council. -- Slight but certain\r\n     evidence of some organized city government prior to Penn's\r\n     Charter.\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.
