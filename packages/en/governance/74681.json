THE NEW WILLARD, WASHINGTON, D. C., APRIL 7, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt is always a pleasure to a man in public life to meet the real\r\ngoverning classes. I wish to bid you welcome to Washington this\r\nevening, and to say but one word of greeting to you, and that word\r\nshall take the form of a warning. I did not speak in jest when I\r\nalluded to you as representatives of the governing classes. I think\r\nthat we of the United States can not keep too fresh in our minds the\r\nfact that the men ultimately responsible for the Government are not\r\nthe representatives of the people, but the people themselves, and that\r\ntherefore heavy is the responsibility that lies upon the people and\r\nabove all upon those who do the most toward shaping the thought of\r\nthe people. In the days of my youth I was a literary man myself. In\r\nreading a book recently, a series of essays, I was immensely struck by\r\none thought developed in it. The writer, one of our greatest scholars,\r\nwas speaking of the fact that freedom could not exist unless there\r\nwent with it a thorough appreciation of responsibility, and he used\r\na phrase somewhat like this—that among all peoples there must be\r\nrestraint; if there is no restraint the result is inevitably anarchy.\r\nThat means the negation of all government, and the negation of all\r\ngovernment of course means the negation of popular government; and that\r\ntherefore there must be restraint, and that therefore a free people\r\nhad merely substituted self-restraint for external restraint; and the\r\npermanence of our freedom as a people, the permanence of our liberties,\r\ndepends upon the way in which we show and exercise that self-restraint.\r\n\r\nThere must be much more than good laws to make a good people. The man\r\nwhose morality is expressed simply in the non-infringement of the law\r\nis a pretty poor creature. Unless our average citizenship is based upon\r\na good deal more than the mere observance of the laws on the statute\r\nbooks—that, of course, is the preliminary—that, of course, is the\r\nbeginning—but unless it is based on more than that then our average\r\ncitizenship can never produce the kind of government which it must\r\nand will produce. So far from liberty, from freedom, from responsible\r\nself-government, being things that come easily and to any peoples,\r\nthey are peculiarly things that can come only to the highly developed\r\npeoples. Only peoples capable, not merely of mastering others, but\r\nof mastering themselves, can achieve real liberty, can achieve real\r\nself-government; and for that self-mastery, for the cultivation of the\r\nspirit of self-restraint which is but another side of the spirit of\r\nself-reliance, we must rely to no small degree upon those who furnish\r\nus much of the thought of the great bulk of our people who think most.\r\nTherefore, gentlemen, in greeting you here to-night I wish not merely\r\nto welcome you, but to say that I trust every man of you feels the\r\nweight of the responsibility that rests upon him. The man who writes,\r\nthe man who month in and month out, week in and week out, day in and\r\nday out, furnishes the material which is to do its part in shaping the\r\nthoughts of our people is fundamentally the man who, more than any\r\nother, determines what kind of character, and therefore ultimately what\r\nkind of government, this people shall possess. I believe in the future\r\nof this people; I believe in the growth and greatness of this country,\r\nbecause I believe that fundamentally you and those like you approach\r\nyour task in the proper spirit. It seems to me that because of the\r\nvery fact that we are so confident in the greatness of our country and\r\nin our country’s future, we should beware of any undue levity, of any\r\nspirit of mere boastfulness, of that most irritating of all qualities,\r\nnot the most noxious, but the most irritating of all qualities—the\r\ntendency to depreciate others and thereby exalt ourselves.\r\n\r\nCourtesy among individuals is a good thing, but international courtesy\r\nis quite as good a thing. If there is any one quality to be deprecated\r\nin a public man and in a public writer alike, it is the using of\r\nlanguage which without any corresponding gain to ourselves tends to\r\nproduce irritation among nations with whom we ought to be on friendly\r\nterms. Nations are now brought much nearer together than they formerly\r\nwere. Steam, electricity, the immense spread of the newspaper press\r\nin all countries, the way in which so much of what is written in any\r\ncountry is translated into the language of another country, all of\r\nthese facts have tended to bring peoples closer together now. That\r\nought to and I think in the future will tell predominantly for good;\r\nbut it does not help us in the least to be brought closer together with\r\nother peoples if they merely find our unamiable traits more strongly\r\nmarked than they thought. We can rest assured that no man ever thinks\r\nbetter of us because we point out his salient defects; and no nation is\r\never won to a kindlier feeling toward us if we adopt toward it a tone\r\nwhich we would resent if adopted toward us.\r\n\r\nWe have a very large field for warring against evil here at home.\r\nWhen we have made things all as they should be in Nation, State, and\r\nmunicipality here at home, then we can talk about reforming the rest of\r\nmankind; but meanwhile let us begin at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE PRIZE DAY EXERCISES AT GROTON SCHOOL, GROTON, MASS., MAY\r\n24, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Rector, and Boys, and Fellow-Parents_:\r\n\r\nAll I shall have to say to you to-day will be simply in the line of\r\nillustrating what the Rector has said, for it seems to me that he has\r\npreached just about the right gospel of life as we ought to learn it;\r\nand let me at the beginning thank the Rector for what I shall hope was\r\na personal allusion to me, because it is the only time in my life that\r\nI have been even indirectly compared to Apollo. When the comparison was\r\nmade I saw the Bishop look self-conscious, so I wish to put in my claim\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nI want to speak to you first of all as regards your duties as boys; and\r\nin the next place as regards your duties as men; and the two things\r\nhang together. The same qualities that make a decent boy make a decent\r\nman. They have different manifestations, but fundamentally they are the\r\nsame. If a boy has not got pluck and honesty and common-sense he is a\r\npretty poor creature; and he is a worse creature if he is a man and\r\nlacks any one of those three traits.\r\n\r\nI was struck, Mr. Peabody, by what you said as to the attitude these\r\nboys should have in college. The boys from a school like this—from\r\nGroton, from St. Mark’s, from St. Paul’s, from any of these schools—if\r\nthey are worth their salt, if they have real loyalty and not merely\r\nlip-loyalty to their schools, ought to go to Columbia, Princeton, Yale,\r\nHarvard, with the firm intention of so carrying themselves that Groton,\r\nSt. Mark’s, St. Paul’s, and the other schools shall not be sneered at\r\nbecause of anything they do. You are not entitled, either in college\r\nor in after life, to an ounce of privilege because you have been at\r\nGroton—not an ounce; but we are entitled to hold you to an exceptional\r\naccountability because you have been at Groton. Because much has been\r\ngiven to you, therefore we have a right to expect much from you; and\r\nwe have a right to expect that you shall begin to give that much just\r\nas soon as you leave school and go to college, so that you shall count\r\nwhen you are there.\r\n\r\nI read the other day in a very bright college book a sentence that\r\ngrated on me because of a sneer it contained at the “shoals of freshmen\r\nfrom church schools,” which implied that they did not so conduct\r\nthemselves as to add weight for what was best in college life. I do not\r\nthink such sneers are justified; but you are peculiarly liable to such\r\nsneers, and therefore you should be peculiarly careful to walk so as\r\nnot to be suspected of deserving them. We have a right to expect that\r\nyou will, from the outset, and without showing yourselves varieties of\r\nthat most obnoxious of creatures, the prig, handle yourselves decently,\r\nso as to be a force for what is decent and right in college.\r\n\r\nAnother thing: I was glad to hear the Rector, in describing one pitfall\r\nthat you are to avoid, use just exactly the right word when he asked\r\nyou to be careful not to turn out snobs. Now, there are in our civic\r\nand social life very much worse creatures than snobs, but none more\r\ncontemptible. (By the way—this is not speaking to the boys, but to\r\nthe parents—I have had the good luck to have my boys go to the public\r\nschools before they came here.) If you have any stuff in you at all,\r\nand try to amount to anything in after life, you will not remain snobs\r\neven if you start as such. It will be taken out of you very soon and\r\nvery roughly if you go into any real work. Go into politics—go to your\r\ndistrict convention, and try to carry it on the snob basis and see\r\nhow far you will get. The thing that will strike you in just about a\r\nweek is that there are a whole lot of able people sliding around this\r\nplanet. The fact that the individual opposed to you does not wear a\r\ncravat, and does wear a saw-edge collar, does not imply that you are\r\ngoing to carry the convention against him! You will soon find that it\r\nis not his clothes but his political sense and energy that control.\r\nYou will find that if you expect to do anything there will be mighty\r\nlittle temptation to try to treat the men with whom you are working on\r\nany basis save the fundamental democratic basis of what they amount\r\nto, and what you can show you amount to as compared to them. So that\r\nif you go into life to do anything, it is perfectly useless for me to\r\ntell you to get rid of snobbery, because you will have to. It is just\r\nas true in every other field as in politics. Every man who works in\r\nphilanthropy—and he can do nothing in philanthropy unless he combines a\r\nvery earnest desire to accomplish what is decent with the determination\r\nto accomplish it in practical fashion (I shall speak of that later)—if\r\nhe goes into philanthropy and tries to do something in a college\r\nsettlement, tries to do his part in working to disentangle the tangled\r\nknot of our social and civic life, he will find just as soon as he gets\r\ninterested in his work he won’t care and won’t know who the people are\r\nwho are with him except as he judges them by their fruits. The interest\r\nthat you take in him is, can a given man accomplish something? If he\r\ncan not, then let him give place to the man who can.\r\n\r\nYou see, all I am doing is to amplify here and there the Rector’s\r\nspeech. Take what was said about scholarship. I came here intending to\r\nspeak to you along that same line, although in a slightly different\r\nway, approaching it from a slightly different aspect. I believe with\r\nall my heart in athletics, in sport, and have always done as much\r\nthereof as my limited capacity and my numerous duties would permit; but\r\nI believe in bodily vigor chiefly because I believe in the spirit that\r\nlies back of it. If a boy can not go into athletics because he is not\r\nphysically able to, that does not count in the least against him. He\r\nmay be just as much of a man in after life as if he could, because it\r\nis not physical address but the moral quality behind it which really\r\ncounts. But if he has the physical ability and keeps out because he is\r\nafraid, because he is lazy, because he is a mollycoddle, then I haven’t\r\nany use for him. If he has not the right spirit, the spirit which makes\r\nhim scorn self-indulgence, timidity and mere ease, that is if he has\r\nnot the spirit which normally stands at the base of physical hardihood,\r\nphysical prowess, then that boy does not amount to much, and he is\r\nnot ordinarily going to amount to much in after life. Of course, there\r\nare people with special abilities so great as to outweigh even defects\r\nlike timidity and laziness, but the man who makes the Republic what it\r\nis, if he has not courage, the capacity to show prowess, the desire for\r\nhardihood; if he has not the scorn of mere ease, the scorn of pain,\r\nthe scorn of discomfort (all of them qualities that go to make a man’s\r\nworth on an eleven or a nine or an eight); if he has not something of\r\nthat sort in him then the lack is so great that it must be amply atoned\r\nfor, more than amply atoned for, in other ways, or his usefulness to\r\nthe community will be small. So I believe heartily in physical prowess,\r\nin the sports that go to make physical prowess. I believe in them not\r\nonly because of the amusement and pleasure they bring, but because I\r\nthink they are useful. Yet I think you had a great deal better never\r\ngo into them than to go into them with the idea that they are the\r\nchief end even of school or college; still more of life. There was an\r\narticle in one of the “Atlantic” monthlies last year which all parents\r\n(even those of the most limited intellectual home development, Mr.\r\nPeabody!) should read, by Lawrence Lowell, on the careers in after life\r\nof those who have distinguished themselves as scholars and as athletes\r\nin college; and the showing for the athletes was not as good, either,\r\nas I had hoped or as I had expected that it would have been. I believe\r\nthat to have been in athletics is an advantage to a man only if he\r\nrealizes that even when he is in college it is not his chief end,\r\nand if he realizes that once out of college it can not be his end at\r\nall. It is a mighty good thing to be a halfback on a varsity eleven;\r\nbut it is a mighty poor thing, when a man reaches the age of forty,\r\nonly to be able to say that he was once halfback on an eleven. Do not\r\nlose the sense of proportion. Remember that in life, and above all in\r\nthe very active, practical, workaday life on this continent, the man\r\nwho wins out must be the man who works. He can not play all the time.\r\nHe can not have play as his principal occupation and win out. Let him\r\nplay; let him have as good a time as he can have. I have a pity that\r\nis akin to contempt for the man who does not have as good a time as he\r\ncan out of life. But let him work. Let him count in the world. When\r\nhe comes to the end of his life let him feel he has pulled his weight\r\nand a little more. A sound body is good; a sound mind is better; but a\r\nstrong and clean character is better than either. In college it is not\r\nnecessary to get into Phi Beta Kappa, though that is desirable; but\r\nit is necessary to work hard at your studies. It is necessary to have\r\nthe habit of application, the habit of subordinating mere pleasure to\r\nserious duty, if you are going to do really good work once you are out\r\nof school and out of college. And while I would be very sorry to see\r\nthose who are in control here in Groton lose that personal touch with\r\ntheir students which has made them again and again keep a poor scholar\r\nand thereby make in the end a good citizen; while I should be very\r\nsorry to see that policy reversed, still I am glad—I do not know that\r\nthe boys will share my joy on this point—I am glad that the standard of\r\nscholarship is to be raised.\r\n\r\nNow, what I have to say to you yourselves, boys, as to what you will\r\namount to when you are men, is in substance but a repetition of what I\r\nhave already said. If you leave Groton, and the college to which you\r\nafterward go, if you go to any—if you leave simply with the feeling\r\nthat you have had ten delightful years; that you have _just_ barely\r\ngot through your examinations; that you have graduated; that you are\r\nnot positively disgraced; that you have met decent people, and that\r\nlife has been easy and it won’t be your fault if it does not continue\r\nas easy—if that is the feeling with which you have left school and\r\ncollege, then you are poor creatures, and there is small good that\r\nwill ever come out of you. Of course, the worst of all lives is the\r\nvicious life; the life of a man who becomes a positive addition\r\nto the forces of evil in a community. Next to that—and when I am\r\nspeaking to people who, by birth and training and standing, ought to\r\namount to a great deal, I have a right to say only second to it in\r\ncriminality—comes the life of mere vapid ease, the ignoble life of a\r\nman who desires nothing from his years but that they shall be led with\r\nthe least effort, the least trouble, the greatest amount of physical\r\nenjoyment—or intellectual enjoyment of a mere dilettante type. The life\r\nthat is worth living, and the only life that is worth living, is the\r\nlife of effort, the life of effort to attain what is worth striving\r\nfor. Incidentally, of all the miserable people that I know I should\r\nput high in the top rank those who reach middle age having steadfastly\r\nstriven only to amuse themselves as they went through life. If there\r\never was a pursuit which stultified itself by its very conditions, it\r\nis the pursuit of pleasure as the all-sufficing end of life. Happiness\r\ncan not come to any man capable of enjoying true happiness unless it\r\ncomes as the sequel to duty well and honestly done. To do that duty you\r\nneed to have more than one trait. You will meet plenty of well-meaning\r\npeople who speak to you as if one trait were enough. That is not so.\r\nYou might just as well in any rough sport in any game, think that a man\r\ncould win by mere strength if he was clumsy; or by mere agility and\r\nprecision of movement without strength; or by strength and agility if\r\nhe had no heart. You need a great many qualities to make a successful\r\nman on a nine or an eleven; and just so you need a great many different\r\nqualities to make a good citizen. In the first place, of course it is\r\nalmost tautological to say that to make a good citizen the prime need\r\nis to be decent, clean in thought, clean in mind, clean in action; to\r\nhave an ideal and not to keep that ideal purely for the study—to have\r\nan ideal which you will in good faith strive to live up to when you\r\nare out in life. If you have an ideal only good while you sit at home,\r\nan ideal that nobody can live up to in outside life, then I advise you\r\nstrongly to take that ideal, examine it closely, and then cast it\r\naway. It is not a good one. The ideal that it is impossible for a man\r\nto strive after in practical life is not the type of ideal that you\r\nwish to hold up and follow. Be practical as well as generous in your\r\nideals. Keep your eyes on the stars, but remember to keep your feet on\r\nthe ground. Be truthful; a lie implies fear, vanity or malevolence;\r\nand be frank; furtiveness and insincerity are faults incompatible with\r\ntrue manliness. Be honest, and remember that honesty counts for nothing\r\nunless back of it lie courage and efficiency. If in this country we\r\never have to face a state of things in which on one side stand the men\r\nof high ideals who are honest, good, well-meaning, pleasant people,\r\nutterly unable to put those ideals into shape in the rough field\r\nof practical life, while on the other side are grouped the strong,\r\npowerful, efficient men with no ideals: then the end of the Republic\r\nwill be near. The salvation of the Republic depends—the salvation of\r\nour whole social system depends—upon the production year by year of a\r\nsufficient number of citizens who possess high ideals combined with the\r\npractical power to realize them in actual life.\r\n\r\nYou often hear people speaking as if life was like striving upward\r\ntoward a mountain peak. That is not so. Life is as if you were\r\ntraveling a ridge crest. You have the gulf of inefficiency on one side\r\nand the gulf of wickedness on the other, and it helps not to have\r\navoided one gulf if you fall into the other. It shall profit us nothing\r\nif our people are decent and ineffective. It shall profit us nothing\r\nif they are efficient and wicked. In every walk of life, in business,\r\npolitics; if the need comes, in war; in literature, science, art, in\r\neverything, what we need is a sufficient number of men who can work\r\nwell and who will work with a high ideal. The work can be done in a\r\nthousand different ways. Our public life depends primarily not upon the\r\nmen who occupy public positions for the moment, because they are but\r\nan infinitesimal fraction of the whole. Our public life depends upon\r\nmen who take an active interest in that public life; who are bound to\r\nsee public affairs honestly and competently managed; but who have the\r\ngood sense to know what honesty and competency actually mean. And any\r\nsuch man, if he is both sane and high-minded, can be a greater help and\r\nstrength to any one in public life than you can easily imagine without\r\nhaving had yourselves the experience. It is an immense strength to a\r\npublic man to know a certain number of people to whom he can appeal\r\nfor advice and for backing; whose character is so high that baseness\r\nwould shrink ashamed before them; and who have such good sense that\r\nany decent public servant is entirely willing to lay before them every\r\ndetail of his actions, asking only that they know the facts before\r\nthey pass final judgment. And now, gentlemen and ladies, I must be\r\npardoned for one personal allusion. We have here to-day one man whom\r\nI have found exactly to answer to that need, who stands as a strong\r\npillar for decency because he has high ideals combined with practical\r\ncommon-sense; and that is Bishop Lawrence.\r\n\r\nWell, I guess I have said about all I have to say. Success does not\r\nlie entirely in the hands of any one of us. From the day the tower of\r\nSiloam fell, misfortune has fallen sometimes upon the just as well as\r\nthe unjust. We sometimes see the good man, the honest man, the strong\r\nman, broken down by forces over which he had no control. If the hand of\r\nthe Lord is heavy upon us the strength and wisdom of man shall avail\r\nnothing. But as a rule in the long run each of us comes pretty near\r\nto getting what he deserves. Each of us can, as a rule—there are, of\r\ncourse, exceptions—finally achieve the success best worth having, the\r\nsuccess of having played his part honestly and manfully; of having\r\nlived so as to feel at the end he has done his duty; of having been a\r\ngood husband, a good father; of having tried to make the world a little\r\nbetter off rather than worse off because he has lived; of having been a\r\ndoer of the word and not a hearer only—still less a mere critic of the\r\ndoers. Every man has it in him, unless fate is indeed hard upon him, to\r\nwin out that measure of success if he will honestly try.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of success to be won. In the first place, there is\r\nsuccess in doing the thing that can only be done by the exceptional\r\nman. Therefore most of us can not achieve this kind of success. It\r\ncomes only to the man who has very exceptional qualities. The other\r\nkind, a very, very high kind, is the ordinary kind of success, the\r\nsuccess that comes to the man who does the things which most men could\r\ndo, but which they do not do; which comes to the man who develops or\r\npossesses to a higher degree the qualities that all of us have to\r\na greater or less extent. In the history of the world some of the\r\nmen who stand high—who stand in all but the very highest places—are\r\nthose who have not possessed any wonderful genius in statecraft, war,\r\nart, literature—in whatever calling; but who have developed within\r\nthemselves, by long, patient effort, resolutely maintained in spite of\r\nrepeated failure, the ordinary, everyday, humdrum qualities of courage,\r\nof resolution, of proper appreciation of the relative importance\r\nof things; of honesty, of truth, of good sense, of unyielding\r\nperseverance. We can each one of us develop to a very high degree these\r\nqualities; and if we do so develop them, each one of us is sure of a\r\nmeasure of success; and I greet you here on this twentieth anniversary\r\nof the founding of Groton School because I feel that Groton School is\r\none of those institutions which pre-eminently stand for the development\r\nof precisely those qualities among the boys whom it sends forth to be\r\nAmerican men, American citizens, to do honor to themselves and their\r\nschool by honoring the commonwealth to which we all belong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT GETTYSBURG, PA., MEMORIAL DAY, MAY 30, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Governor, and You, my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nIt is indeed a pleasure to greet you to-day. In greeting all I, of\r\ncourse, greet above all others the men to whom we owe it that we are\r\nhere to-day, or that we have a country of which to be proud—the men\r\nwho fought to a finish the great Civil War. And, having greeted first\r\nthose at one end of the line, I want to speak of the others and say I\r\nwas exceedingly pleased to see the children. Also let me say a word\r\nof greeting in your behalf, my comrades of the Civil War, to the\r\nregulars who were here to-day as an escort—to the men who now wear the\r\nuniform of “Uncle Sam,” and wear it honorably to defend the flag as\r\nyou defended it in your youth and early manhood. The memories of this\r\nfield are inextricably entwined in our hearts with the great deeds of\r\nthe leaders of the past, as one by one the men who here signalized\r\nthemselves have passed away.\r\n\r\nGovernor Pennypacker alluded to the fact that to-day Pennsylvania\r\nmourns its senior Senator. The regiment which Senator Quay was\r\ninstrumental in raising took part in the battle of Gettysburg—the\r\nbattle in which Governor Pennypacker shared. Senator Quay was not with\r\nit here; he had gone with another regiment, and it is appropriate at\r\nthis time to recall the fact that when the term of service of that\r\nregiment expired, just before the battle of Fredericksburg, Senator\r\nQuay declined to accept the discharge and continued as a volunteer with\r\nthe army that fought at Fredericksburg and won the medal of honor on\r\nthat bloody day.\r\n\r\nThe place where we now are has won a double distinction. Here was\r\nfought one of the great battles of all time, and here was spoken one\r\nof the few speeches which shall last through the ages. As long as this\r\nRepublic endures or its history is known, so long shall the memory of\r\nthe Battle of Gettysburg likewise endure and be known; and as long\r\nas the English tongue is understood, so long shall Abraham Lincoln’s\r\nGettysburg speech thrill the hearts of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War was a great war for righteousness; a war waged for the\r\nnoblest ideals, but waged also in thoroughgoing, practical fashion.\r\nThat is why you won then—because you had the ideals, because you had\r\nthe lift of soul in you, and because also you had the right stuff in\r\nyou to make those ideals count in actual life. You had to have the\r\nideals, but if you had not been able to march and shoot you could not\r\nhave put them into practice. It was one of the few wars which mean, in\r\ntheir successful outcome, a lift toward better things for the nations\r\nof mankind. Some wars have meant the triumph of order over anarchy\r\nand licentiousness masquerading as liberty; some wars have meant\r\nthe triumph of liberty over tyranny masquerading as order; but this\r\nvictorious war of ours meant the triumph of both liberty and order,\r\nthe triumph of orderly liberty, the bestowal of civil rights upon\r\nthe freed slaves, and at the same time the stern insistence on the\r\nsupremacy of the national law throughout the length and breadth of the\r\nland. Moreover, this was one of those rare contests in which it was\r\nto the immeasurable interest of the vanquished that they should lose,\r\nwhile at the same time the victors acquired the precious privilege\r\nof transmitting to those who came after them, as a heritage of honor\r\nforever, not only the memory of their own valiant deeds, but the memory\r\nof the deeds of those who, no less valiantly and with equal sincerity\r\nof purpose, fought against the stars in their courses. The war left to\r\nus all, as fellow-countrymen, as brothers, the right to rejoice that\r\nthe Union has been restored in indestructible shape in a country where\r\nslavery no longer mocks the boast of freedom, and also the right to\r\nrejoice with exultant pride in the courage, the self-sacrifice, and the\r\ndevotion, alike of the men who wore the blue and the men who wore the\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nHe is but a poor American who, looking at this field, does not feel\r\nwithin himself a deeper reverence for the Nation’s past and a higher\r\npurpose to make the Nation’s future rise level to her past. Here fought\r\nthe chosen sons of the North and the South, the East and the West.\r\nThe armies which on this field contended for the mastery were veteran\r\narmies, hardened by long campaigning and desperate fighting into such\r\ninstruments of war as no other nation then possessed. The severity of\r\nthe fighting is attested by the proportionate loss—a loss unrivaled\r\nin any battle of similar size since the close of the Napoleonic\r\nstruggles; a loss which in certain regiments was from three-fourths to\r\nfour-fifths of the men engaged. Every spot on this field has its own\r\nassociations of soldierly duty nobly done, of supreme self-sacrifice\r\nfreely rendered. The names of the chiefs who served in the two armies\r\nform a long honor roll; and the enlisted men were worthy, and even more\r\nthan worthy, of those who led them. Every acre of this ground has its\r\nown associations. We see where the fight thundered through and around\r\nthe village of Gettysburg; where the artillery formed on the ridges;\r\nwhere the cavalry fought; where the hills were attacked and defended;\r\nand where, finally, the great charge surged up the slope only to break\r\non the summit in the bloody spray of gallant failure.\r\n\r\nBut the soldiers who won at Gettysburg, the soldiers who fought to a\r\nfinish the Civil War and thereby made their countrymen forever their\r\ndebtors, have left us far more even than the memories of the war\r\nitself. They fought for four years in order that on this Continent\r\nthose who came after them, their children and their children’s\r\nchildren, might enjoy a lasting peace. They took arms not to destroy,\r\nbut to save liberty; not to overthrow, but to establish the supremacy\r\nof the law. The crisis which they faced was to determine whether or\r\nnot this people was fit for self-government and, therefore, fit for\r\nliberty. Freedom is not a gift which can be enjoyed save by those\r\nwho show themselves worthy of it. In this world no privilege can\r\nbe permanently appropriated by men who have not the power and the\r\nwill successfully to assume the responsibility of using it aright.\r\nIn his recent admirable little volume on freedom and responsibility\r\nin democratic government, President Hadley of Yale has pointed\r\nout that the freedom which is worth anything is the freedom which\r\nmeans self-government and not anarchy. Freedom thus conceived is a\r\nconstructive force, which enables an intelligent and good man to do\r\nbetter things than he could do without it; which is in its essence the\r\nsubstitution of self-restraint for external restraint—the substitution\r\nof a form of restraint which promotes progress for the form which\r\nretards it. This is the right view to take of freedom; but it can only\r\nbe taken if there is a full recognition of the close connection between\r\nliberty and responsibility in every domain of human thought and action.\r\nIt was essentially the view taken by Abraham Lincoln, and by all those\r\nwho, when the Civil War broke out, realized that in a self-governing\r\ndemocracy those who desire to be considered fit to enjoy liberty must\r\nshow that they know how to use it with moderation and justice in peace,\r\nand how to fight for it when it is jeoparded by malice domestic or\r\nforeign levy.\r\n\r\nThe lessons they taught us are lessons as applicable in our everyday\r\nlives now as in the rare times of great stress. The men who made this\r\nfield forever memorable did so because they combined the power of\r\nfealty to a lofty ideal with the power of showing that fealty in hard,\r\npractical, common-sense fashion. They stood for the life of effort, not\r\nthe life of ease. They had that love of country, that love of justice,\r\nthat love of their fellow-men, without which power and resourceful\r\nefficiency but make a man a danger to his fellows. Yet, in addition\r\nthereto, they likewise possessed the power and the efficiency; for\r\notherwise their high purpose would have been barren of result. They\r\nknew each how to act for himself, and yet each how to act with his\r\nfellows. They learned, as all the generation of the Civil War learned,\r\nthat rare indeed is the chance to do anything worth doing by one sudden\r\nand violent effort. The men who believed that the Civil War would be\r\nended in ninety days, the men who cried loudest “On to Richmond,” if\r\nthey had the right stuff in them speedily learned their error; and the\r\nwar was actually won by those who settled themselves steadfastly down\r\nto fight for three years, or for as much longer as the war might last,\r\nand who gradually grew to understand that the triumph would come, not\r\nby a single brilliant victory, but by a hundred painful and tedious\r\ncampaigns. In the East and the West the columns advanced and recoiled,\r\nswayed from side to side, and again advanced; along the coasts the\r\nblack ships stood endlessly off and on before the hostile forts;\r\ngenerals and admirals emerged into the light, each to face his crowded\r\nhour of success or failure; the men in front fought; the men behind\r\nsupplied and pushed forward those in front; and the final victory was\r\ndue to the deeds of all who played their parts well and manfully, in\r\nthe scores of battles, in the countless skirmishes, in march, in camp,\r\nor in reserve, as commissioned officers, or in the ranks—wherever and\r\nwhenever duty called them. That is why the title that most appeals to\r\nyou now is the title of comrade, by which the private in the ranks\r\nand the lieutenant-general address one another, because each did his\r\nduty and asks no more than recognition of that fact. Just so it must\r\nbe for us in civil life. We can make and keep this country worthy of\r\nthe men who gave their lives to save it, only on condition that the\r\naverage man among us on the whole does his duty bravely, loyally, and\r\nwith common-sense, in whatever position life allots to him. Exactly\r\nas in time of war courage is the cardinal virtue of the soldier, so\r\nin time of peace honesty, using the word in its deepest and broadest\r\nsignificance, is the essential basic virtue, without which all else\r\navails nothing. National greatness is of slow growth. It can not be\r\nforced and yet be stable and enduring; for it is based fundamentally\r\nupon national character, and national character is stamped deep in a\r\npeople by the lives of many generations. The men who went into the army\r\nhad to submit to discipline, had to submit to restraint through the\r\ngovernment of the leaders they had chosen, as the price of winning.\r\nSo we, the people, can preserve our liberty and our greatness in\r\ntime of peace only by ourselves exercising the virtues of honesty, of\r\nself-restraint, and of fair dealing between man and man. In all the\r\nages of the past men have seen countries lose their liberty, because\r\ntheir people could not restrain and order themselves, and therefore\r\nforfeited the right to what they were unable to use with wisdom.\r\n\r\nIt was because you men of the Civil War both knew how to use liberty\r\ntemperately and how to defend it at need that we and our children\r\nand our children’s children shall hold you in honor forever. Here,\r\non Memorial Day, on this great battlefield, we commemorate not only\r\nthe chiefs who actually won this battle; not only Meade, and his\r\nlieutenants, Hancock and Reynolds and Howard and Sickles, and the\r\nmany others whose names flame in our annals; but also the chiefs\r\nwho had made the Army of the Potomac what it was, and those who\r\nafterward led it in the campaigns which were crowned at Appomattox;\r\nand furthermore those who made and used its sister armies: McClellan,\r\nwith his extraordinary genius for organization; Rosecrans; Buell;\r\nThomas, the unyielding, the steadfast; and that great trio, Sherman,\r\nSheridan, and last and greatest of all, Grant himself, the silent\r\nsoldier whose hammer-like blows finally beat down even the prowess of\r\nthe men who fought against him. Above all we meet here to pay homage to\r\nthe officers and enlisted men who served and fought and died, without\r\nhaving, as their chiefs had, the chance to write their names on the\r\ntablets of fame; to the men who marched and fought in the ranks, who\r\nwere buried in long trenches on the field of battle, who died in cots\r\nmarked only by numbers in the hospitals; who, if they lived, when the\r\nwar was over, went back each to his task on the farm or in the town, to\r\ndo his duty in peace as he had done it in war; to take up the threads\r\nof his working life where he had dropped them when the trumpets of the\r\nNation pealed to arms. To-day, all over this land our people meet to\r\npay reverent homage to the dead who died that the Nation might live;\r\nand we pay homage also to their comrades who are still with us.\r\n\r\nAll are at one now, the sons of those who wore the blue and the sons\r\nof those who wore the gray, and all can unite in paying respect to the\r\nmemory of those who fell, each of them giving his life for his duty\r\nas he saw it; and all should be at one in learning from the deaths of\r\nthese men how to live usefully while the times call for the performance\r\nof the countless necessary duties of everyday life, and how to hold\r\nourselves ready to die nobly should the Nation ever again demand of her\r\nsons the splendid ultimate proof of loyalty to her and to the flag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT THE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL CHAPEL, VALLEY FORGE, PA., JUNE 19,\r\n1904\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a great pleasure to come here this afternoon and say a word\r\non behalf of the project to erect a memorial chapel on this great\r\nhistoric site. Three weeks ago I was at the field where the bloodiest\r\nand most decisive battle of the Civil War was fought, and it is a\r\nnoteworthy thing that this State of Pennsylvania should have within\r\nits borders the places which mark the two turning points in our\r\nhistory—Gettysburg, which saw the high-tide of the Rebellion—Valley\r\nForge, which saw the getting beyond the danger point of the Revolution.\r\n\r\nThere have been two great crises in our national history—two crises\r\nwhere failure meant the absolute breaking asunder of the Nation—one\r\nthe Revolutionary War, one the Civil War. If the men who took to arms\r\nin ’76 for national independence had failed, then not merely would\r\nthere never have been a national growth on this Continent, but the\r\nwhole spirit of nationality for the younger lands of the world would\r\nhave perished still-born. If the men of ’61 had failed in the great\r\nstruggle for national unity it would have meant that the work done by\r\nWashington and his associates might almost or quite as well have been\r\nleft undone. There would have been no point in commemorating what was\r\ndone at Valley Forge if Gettysburg had not given us the national right\r\nto commemorate it. If we were now split up into a dozen wrangling\r\nlittle communities, if we lacked the power to keep away here on our own\r\nContinent, within our own lines, or to show ourselves a unit as against\r\nforeign aggression, then, indeed, the Declaration of Independence would\r\nread like empty sound, and the Constitution would not be worth the\r\npaper upon which it was written, save as a study for antiquarians.\r\n\r\nThere have been other crises than those that culminated during the War\r\nfor Independence and the great Civil War, there have been great deeds\r\nand great men at other periods of our national history, but there never\r\nhas been another deed vital to the welfare of the Nation save the\r\ntwo—the deed of those who founded and the deed of those who saved the\r\nRepublic. There never has been another man whose life has been vital to\r\nthe Republic save Washington and Lincoln. I am not here to say anything\r\nabout Lincoln, but I do not see how any American can think of either of\r\nthem without thinking of the other too, because they represent the same\r\nwork. Think how fortunate we are as a Nation. Think what it means to\r\nus as a people that our young men should have as their ideals two men,\r\nnot conquerors, not men who have won glory by wrongdoing; not men whose\r\nlives were spent in their own advancement, but men who lived, one of\r\nwhom died, that the Nation might grow steadily greater and better—the\r\nman who founded the Republic and took no glory from it himself save\r\nwhat was freely given him by his fellow-citizens, and that only in the\r\nshape of a chance of rendering them service, and the man who afterward\r\nsaved the Republic, who saved the state, without striking down\r\nliberty. Often in history a state has been saved and liberty struck\r\ndown at the same time. Lincoln saved the Union and lifted the cause of\r\nliberty higher than before. Washington created the Republic, rose by\r\nstatecraft to the highest position, and used that position only for the\r\nwelfare of his fellows and for so long as his fellows wished him to\r\nkeep it.\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing that of these great landmarks of our\r\nhistory—Gettysburg and Valley Forge—one should commemorate a single\r\ntremendous effort and the other what we need, on the whole, much more\r\ncommonly, and what I think is, on the whole, rather more difficult to\r\ndo—long-sustained effort. Only men with a touch of the heroic in them\r\ncould have lasted out that three days’ struggle at Gettysburg. Only\r\nmen fit to rank with the great men of all time could have beaten back\r\nthe mighty onslaught of that gallant and wonderful army of Northern\r\nVirginia, whose final supreme effort faded at the stone wall on\r\nCemetery Ridge on that July day forty-one years ago.\r\n\r\nBut after all, hard though it is to rise to the supreme height of\r\nself-sacrifice and of effort at a time of crisis that is short, to\r\nrise to it for a single great effort—it is harder yet to rise to the\r\nlevel of a crisis when that crisis takes the form of needing constant,\r\npatient, steady work, month after month, year after year, when, too, it\r\ndoes not end after a terrible struggle in a glorious day—when it means\r\nmonths of gloom and effort steadfastly endured, and triumph wrested\r\nonly at the very end.\r\n\r\nHere at Valley Forge Washington and his Continentals warred not\r\nagainst the foreign soldiery, but against themselves, against all\r\nthe appeals of our nature that are most difficult to resist—against\r\ndiscouragement, discontent, the mean envies and jealousies, and\r\nheart-burnings sure to arise at any time in large bodies of men, but\r\nespecially sure to arise when defeat and disaster have come to large\r\nbodies of men. Here the soldiers who carried our national flag had to\r\nsuffer from cold, from privation, from hardship, knowing that their\r\nfoes were well housed, knowing that things went easier for the others\r\nthan it did for them. And they conquered, because they had in them the\r\nspirit that made them steadfast, not merely on an occasional great day,\r\nbut day after day in the life of daily endeavor to do duty well.\r\n\r\nWhen two lessons are both indispensable, it seems hardly worth while\r\nto dwell more on one than on the other. Yet I think that as a people\r\nwe need more to learn the lesson of Valley Forge even than that of\r\nGettysburg. I have not the slightest anxiety but that this people, if\r\nthe need should come in the future, will be able to show the heroism,\r\nthe supreme effort that was shown at Gettysburg, though it may well\r\nbe that it would mean a similar two years of effort, checkered by\r\ndisaster, to lead up to it. But the vital thing for this Nation to do\r\nis steadily to cultivate the quality which Washington and those under\r\nhim so pre-eminently showed during the winter at Valley Forge—the\r\nquality of steady adherence to duty in the teeth of difficulty, in the\r\nteeth of discouragement, and even disaster, the quality that makes a\r\nman do what is straight and decent, not one day when a great crisis\r\ncomes, but every day, day in and day out, until success comes at the\r\nend.\r\n\r\nOf course, all of us are agreed that a prime national need is the need\r\nof commemorating the memories of the men who did greatly, thought\r\nhighly, who fought, suffered, endured, for the Nation. It is a great\r\nthing to commemorate their lives; but, after all, the worthy way to do\r\nso is to try to show by our lives that we have profited by them. If\r\nwe show that the lives of the great men of the past have been to us\r\nincitements to do well in the present, then we have paid to them the\r\nonly homage which is really worthy of them. If we treat their great\r\ndeeds as matters merely for idle boasting, not as spurring us on to\r\neffort, but as excusing us from effort, then we show that we are not\r\nworthy of our sires, of the people who went before us in the history of\r\nour land. What we as a people need more than aught else is the steady\r\nperformance of the everyday duties of life, not with hope of reward,\r\nbut because they are duties.\r\n\r\nI spoke of how we felt that we had in Washington and Lincoln national\r\nideals. I contrasted their names with the names of many others in\r\nhistory, names which will shine as brightly, but oh! with how much less\r\npower and light. I think you will find that the fundamental difference\r\nbetween our two great national heroes and almost any other men of equal\r\nnote in the world’s history, is that when you think of our two men you\r\nthink inevitably not of glory, but of duty, not of what the man did\r\nfor himself in achieving name, or fame, or position, but of what he\r\ndid for his fellows. They set the right ideal and also they lived up to\r\nit in practical fashion. Had either of them possessed that fantastic\r\nquality of mind which sets an impossible, and, perhaps, an undesirable\r\nideal, or which declines to do the actual work of the present because\r\nforsooth the implements with which it is necessary to work are not to\r\nthat man’s choice, his fame would have been missed, his achievement\r\nwould have crumbled into dust, and he would not have left one stroke on\r\nthe book which tells of effort accomplished for the good of mankind.\r\n\r\nA man, to amount to anything, must be practical. He must actually do\r\nthings, not talk about doing them, least of all cavil at how they are\r\naccomplished by those who actually go down into the arena, and actually\r\nface the dust and the blood and the sweat, who actually triumphed in\r\nthe struggle. The man must have the force, the power, the will to\r\naccomplish results, but he must have also the lift toward lofty things\r\nwhich shall make him incapable of striving for aught unless that for\r\nwhich he strives is something honorable and high—something well worth\r\nstriving for.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you that it is your good fortune to be engaged in\r\nerecting a memorial to the great man who was equal to the great days—to\r\nthe man and the men who showed by their lives that they were indeed\r\ndoers of the word and not hearers only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT OYSTER BAY, N. Y., JULY 27, 1904, IN RESPONSE TO THE\r\nCOMMITTEE APPOINTED TO NOTIFY HIM OF HIS NOMINATION FOR THE PRESIDENCY\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Speaker and Gentlemen of the Notification Committee_:\r\n\r\nI am deeply sensible of the high honor conferred upon me by the\r\nrepresentatives of the Republican party assembled in convention, and I\r\naccept the nomination for the Presidency with solemn realization of the\r\nobligations I assume. I heartily approve the declaration of principles\r\nwhich the Republican National Convention has adopted, and at some\r\nfuture day I shall communicate to you, Mr. Chairman, more at length and\r\nin detail a formal written acceptance of the nomination.\r\n\r\nThree years ago I became President because of the death of my lamented\r\npredecessor. I then stated that it was my purpose to carry out his\r\nprinciples and policies for the honor and the interest of the country.\r\nTo the best of my ability I have kept the promise thus made. If\r\nnext November my countrymen confirm at the polls the action of the\r\nconvention you represent, I shall, under Providence, continue to work\r\nwith an eye single to the welfare of all our people.\r\n\r\nA party is of worth only in so far as it promotes the national\r\ninterest, and every official, high or low, can serve his party\r\nbest by rendering to the people the best service of which he is\r\ncapable. Effective government comes only as the result of the\r\nloyal co-operation of many different persons. The members of a\r\nlegislative majority, the officers in the various departments of the\r\nAdministration, and the Legislative and Executive branches as toward\r\neach other, must work together with subordination of self to the common\r\nend of successful government. We who have been intrusted with power\r\nas public servants during the past seven years of administration and\r\nlegislation now come before the people content to be judged by our\r\nrecord of achievement. In the years that have gone by we have made the\r\ndeed square with the word; and if we are continued in power we shall\r\nunswervingly follow out the great lines of public policy which the\r\nRepublican party has already laid down; a public policy to which we are\r\ngiving, and shall give, a united, and therefore an efficient, support.\r\n\r\nIn all of this we are more fortunate than our opponents, who now appeal\r\nfor confidence on the ground, which some express and some seek to have\r\nconfidentially understood, that if triumphant they may be trusted to\r\nprove false to every principle which in the last eight years they have\r\nlaid down as vital, and to leave undisturbed those very acts of the\r\nAdministration because of which they ask that the Administration itself\r\nbe driven from power. Seemingly their present attitude as to their past\r\nrecord is that some of them were mistaken and others insincere. We\r\nmake our appeal in a wholly different spirit. We are not constrained\r\nto keep silent on any vital question; we are divided on no vital\r\nquestion; our policy is continuous, and is the same for all sections\r\nand localities. There is nothing experimental about the Government we\r\nask the people to continue in power, for our performance in the past,\r\nour proved governmental efficiency, is a guarantee as to our promises\r\nfor the future. Our opponents, either openly or secretly, according to\r\ntheir several temperaments, now ask the people to trust their present\r\npromises in consideration of the fact that they intend to treat their\r\npast promises as null and void. We know our own minds and we have kept\r\nof the same mind for a sufficient length of time to give to our policy\r\ncoherence and sanity. In such a fundamental matter as the enforcement\r\nof the law we do not have to depend upon promises, but merely to ask\r\nthat our record be taken as an earnest of what we shall continue to\r\ndo. In dealing with the great organizations known as trusts, we do not\r\nhave to explain why the laws were not enforced, but to point out that\r\nthey actually have been enforced, and that legislation has been enacted\r\nto increase the effectiveness of their enforcement. We do not have to\r\npropose to “turn the rascals out,” for we have shown in very deed that\r\nwhenever by diligent investigation a public official can be found who\r\nhas betrayed his trust he will be punished to the full extent of the\r\nlaw without regard to whether he was appointed under a Republican or\r\na Democratic Administration. This is the efficient way to turn the\r\nrascals out and to keep them out, and it has the merit of sincerity.\r\nMoreover, the betrayals of trust in the last seven years have been\r\ninsignificant in number when compared with the extent of the public\r\nservice. Never has the administration of the Government been on a\r\ncleaner and higher level; never has the public work of the Nation been\r\ndone more honestly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nAssuredly it is unwise to change the policies which have worked so well\r\nand which are now working so well. Prosperity has come at home. The\r\nnational honor and interest have been upheld abroad. We have placed the\r\nfinances of the Nation upon a sound gold basis. We have done this with\r\nthe aid of many who were formerly our opponents, but who would neither\r\nopenly support nor silently acquiesce in the heresy of unsound finance;\r\nand we have done it against the convinced and violent opposition of the\r\nmass of our present opponents who still refuse to recant the unsound\r\nopinions which for the moment they think it inexpedient to assert. We\r\nknow what we mean when we speak of an honest and stable currency. We\r\nmean the same thing from year to year. We do not have to avoid definite\r\nand conclusive committal on the most important issue which has recently\r\nbeen before the people, and which may at any time in the near future be\r\nbefore them again. Upon the principles which underlie this issue the\r\nconvictions of half of our number do not clash with those of the other\r\nhalf. So long as the Republican party is in power the gold standard is\r\nsettled, not as a matter of temporary political expediency, not because\r\nof shifting conditions in the production of gold in certain mining\r\ncentres, but in accordance with what we regard as the fundamental\r\nprinciples of national morality and wisdom.\r\n\r\nUnder the financial legislation which we have enacted there is now\r\nample circulation for every business need; and every dollar of\r\nthis circulation is worth a dollar in gold. We have reduced the\r\ninterest-bearing debt, and in still larger measure the interest on\r\nthat debt. All of the war taxes imposed during the Spanish War have\r\nbeen removed with a view to relieve the people and to prevent the\r\naccumulation of an unnecessary surplus. The result is that hardly ever\r\nbefore have the expenditures and income of the Government so closely\r\ncorresponded. In the fiscal year that has just closed the excess of\r\nincome over the ordinary expenditures was nine millions of dollars.\r\nThis does not take account of the fifty millions expended out of the\r\naccumulated surplus for the purchase of the Isthmian Canal. It is an\r\nextraordinary proof of the sound financial condition of the Nation that\r\ninstead of following the usual course in such matters and throwing the\r\nburden upon posterity by an issue of bonds, we were able to make the\r\npayment outright and yet after it to have in the treasury a surplus of\r\none hundred and sixty-one millions. Moreover, we were able to pay this\r\nfifty millions of dollars out of hand without causing the slightest\r\ndisturbance to business conditions.\r\n\r\nWe have enacted a tariff law under which during the past few years\r\nthe country has attained a height of material well-being never before\r\nreached. Wages are higher than ever before. That whenever the need\r\narises there should be a readjustment of the tariff schedules is\r\nundoubted; but such changes can with safety be made only by those whose\r\ndevotion to the principle of a protective tariff is beyond question;\r\nfor otherwise the changes would amount not to readjustment, but to\r\nrepeal. The readjustment when made must maintain and not destroy the\r\nprotective principle. To the farmer, the merchant, the manufacturer\r\nthis is vital; but perhaps no other man is so much interested as the\r\nwage-worker in the maintenance of our present economic system, both\r\nas regards the finances and the tariff. The standard of living of our\r\nwage-workers is higher than that of any other country, and it can not\r\nso remain unless we have a protective tariff which shall always keep as\r\na minimum a rate of duty sufficient to cover the difference between the\r\nlabor cost here and abroad. Those who, like our opponents, “denounce\r\nprotection as a robbery” thereby explicitly commit themselves to the\r\nproposition that if they were to revise the tariff no heed would be\r\npaid to the necessity of meeting this difference between the standards\r\nof living for wage-workers here and in other countries; and therefore\r\non this point their antagonism to our position is fundamental. Here\r\nagain we ask that their promises and ours be judged by what has been\r\ndone in the immediate past. We ask that sober and sensible men compare\r\nthe workings of the present tariff law, and the conditions which obtain\r\nunder it, with the workings of the preceding tariff law of 1894 and the\r\nconditions which that tariff of 1894 helped to bring about.\r\n\r\nWe believe in reciprocity with foreign nations on the terms outlined\r\nin President McKinley’s last speech, which urged the extension of\r\nour foreign markets by reciprocal agreements whenever they could be\r\nmade without injury to American industry and labor. It is a singular\r\nfact that the only great reciprocity treaty recently adopted—that\r\nwith Cuba—was finally opposed almost alone by the representatives of\r\nthe very party which now states that it favors reciprocity. And here\r\nagain we ask that the worth of our words be judged by comparing their\r\ndeeds with ours. On this Cuban reciprocity treaty there were at the\r\noutset grave differences of opinion among ourselves; and the notable\r\nthing in the negotiation and ratification of the treaty, and in the\r\nlegislation which carried it into effect, was the highly practical\r\nmanner in which without sacrifice of principle these differences of\r\nopinion were reconciled. There was no rupture of a great party, but an\r\nexcellent practical outcome, the result of the harmonious co-operation\r\nof two successive Presidents and two successive Congresses. This is\r\nan illustration of the governing capacity which entitles us to the\r\nconfidence of the people not only in our purposes but in our practical\r\nability to achieve those purposes. Judging by the history of the last\r\ntwelve years, down to this very month, is there justification for\r\nbelieving that under similar circumstances and with similar initial\r\ndifferences of opinion, our opponents would have achieved any practical\r\nresult?\r\n\r\nWe have already shown in actual fact that our policy is to do fair and\r\nequal justice to all men, paying no heed to whether a man is rich or\r\npoor; paying no heed to his race, his creed, or his birthplace.\r\n\r\nWe recognize the organization of capital and the organization of\r\nlabor as natural outcomes of our industrial system. Each kind of\r\norganization is to be favored so long as it acts in a spirit of justice\r\nand of regard for the rights of others. Each is to be granted the full\r\nprotection of the law, and each in turn is to be held to a strict\r\nobedience to the law; for no man is above it and no man below it. The\r\nhumblest individual is to have his rights safeguarded as scrupulously\r\nas those of the strongest organization, for each is to receive justice,\r\nno more and no less. The problems with which we have to deal in our\r\nmodern industrial and social life are manifold; but the spirit in which\r\nit is necessary to approach their solution is simply the spirit of\r\nhonesty, of courage, and of common-sense.\r\n\r\nIn inaugurating the great work of irrigation in the West the\r\nAdministration has been enabled by Congress to take one of the longest\r\nstrides ever taken under our Government toward utilizing our vast\r\nnational domain for the settler, the actual homemaker.\r\n\r\nEver since this Continent was discovered the need of an Isthmian Canal\r\nto connect the Pacific and the Atlantic has been recognized; and ever\r\nsince the birth of our Nation such a canal has been planned. At last\r\nthe dream has become a reality. The Isthmian Canal is now being built\r\nby the Government of the United States. We conducted the negotiation\r\nfor its construction with the nicest and most scrupulous honor, and in\r\na spirit of the largest generosity toward those through whose territory\r\nit was to run. Every sinister effort which could be devised by the\r\nspirit of faction or the spirit of self-interest was made in order to\r\ndefeat the treaty with Panama and thereby prevent the consummation of\r\nthis work. The construction of the canal is now an assured fact; but\r\nmost certainly it is unwise to intrust the carrying out of so momentous\r\na policy to those who have endeavored to defeat the whole undertaking.\r\n\r\nOur foreign policy has been so conducted that, while not one of our\r\njust claims has been sacrificed, our relations with all foreign nations\r\nare now of the most peaceful kind; there is not a cloud on the horizon.\r\nThe last cause of irritation between us and any other nation was\r\nremoved by the settlement of the Alaskan boundary.\r\n\r\nIn the Caribbean Sea we have made good our promises of independence to\r\nCuba, and have proved our assertion that our mission in the island was\r\none of justice and not of self-aggrandizement; and thereby no less than\r\nby our action in Venezuela and Panama we have shown that the Monroe\r\nDoctrine is a living reality, designed for the hurt of no nation, but\r\nfor the protection of civilization on the Western Continent, and for\r\nthe peace of the world. Our steady growth in power has gone hand in\r\nhand with a strengthening disposition to use this power with strict\r\nregard for the rights of others, and for the cause of international\r\njustice and goodwill.\r\n\r\nWe earnestly desire friendship with all the nations of the New and\r\nOld Worlds; and we endeavor to place our relations with them upon\r\na basis of reciprocal advantage instead of hostility. We hold that\r\nthe prosperity of each nation is an aid and not a hindrance to the\r\nprosperity of other nations. We seek international amity for the same\r\nreasons that make us believe in peace within our own borders; and we\r\nseek this peace not because we are afraid or unready, but because we\r\nthink that peace is right as well as advantageous.\r\n\r\nAmerican interests in the Pacific have rapidly grown. American\r\nenterprise has laid a cable across this, the greatest of oceans. We\r\nhave proved in effective fashion that we wish the Chinese Empire well\r\nand desire its integrity and independence.\r\n\r\nOur foothold in the Philippines greatly strengthens our position in\r\nthe competition for the trade of the East; but we are governing the\r\nPhilippines in the interest of the Philippine people themselves. We\r\nhave already given them a large share in their government, and our\r\npurpose is to increase this share as rapidly as they give evidence of\r\nincreasing fitness for the task. The great majority of the officials\r\nof the islands, whether elective or appointive, are already native\r\nFilipinos. We are now providing for a legislative assembly. This is the\r\nfirst step to be taken in the future; and it would be eminently unwise\r\nto declare what our next step will be until this first step has been\r\ntaken and the results are manifest. To have gone faster than we have\r\nalready gone in giving the islanders a constantly increasing measure\r\nof self-government would have been disastrous. At the present moment\r\nto give political independence to the islands would result in the\r\nimmediate loss of civil rights, personal liberty, and public order, as\r\nregards the mass of the Filipinos, for the majority of the islanders\r\nhave been given these great boons by us, and only keep them because we\r\nvigilantly safeguard and guarantee them. To withdraw our Government\r\nfrom the islands at this time would mean to the average native the loss\r\nof his barely won civil freedom. We have established in the islands a\r\nGovernment by Americans assisted by Filipinos. We are steadily striving\r\nto transform this into self-government by the Filipinos assisted by\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nThe principles which we uphold should appeal to all our countrymen, in\r\nall portions of our country. Above all they should give us strength\r\nwith the men and women who are the spiritual heirs of those who upheld\r\nthe hands of Abraham Lincoln; for we are striving to do our work in the\r\nspirit with which Lincoln approached his. During the seven years that\r\nhave just passed there is no duty, domestic or foreign, which we have\r\nshirked; no necessary task which we have feared to undertake, or which\r\nwe have not performed with reasonable efficiency. We have never pleaded\r\nimpotence. We have never sought refuge in criticism and complaint\r\ninstead of action. We face the future with our past and our present as\r\nguarantors of our promises; and we are content to stand or to fall by\r\nthe record which we have made and are making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER ACCEPTING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES\r\n\r\n\r\n                        OYSTER BAY, N. Y., _Sept. 12, 1904_\r\n\r\n  HON. J. G. CANNON, _Chairman of the Notification Committee_,\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nI accept the nomination for the Presidency tendered me by the\r\nRepublican National Convention, and cordially approve the platform\r\nadopted by it. In writing this letter there are certain points upon\r\nwhich I desire to lay especial stress.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find out from the utterances of our opponents what\r\nare the real issues upon which they propose to wage this campaign. It\r\nis not unfair to say that, having abandoned most of the principles\r\nupon which they have insisted during the last eight years, they now\r\nseem at a loss, both as to what it is that they really believe, and\r\nas to how firmly they shall assert their belief in anything. In fact,\r\nit is doubtful if they venture resolutely to press a single issue; as\r\nsoon as they raise one they shrink from it and seek to explain it away.\r\nSuch an attitude is the probably inevitable result of the effort to\r\nimprovise convictions; for when thus improvised, it is natural that\r\nthey should be held in a tentative manner.\r\n\r\nThe party now in control of the Government is troubled by no such\r\ndifficulties. We do not have to guess at our own convictions, and\r\nthen correct the guess if it seems unpopular. The principles which we\r\nprofess are those in which we believe with heart and soul and strength.\r\nMen may differ from us; but they can not accuse us of shiftiness or\r\ninsincerity. The policies we have pursued are those which we earnestly\r\nhold as essential to the national welfare and repute. Our actions\r\nspeak even louder than our words for the faith that is in us. We base\r\nour appeal upon what we have done and are doing, upon our record of\r\nadministration and legislation during the last seven years, in which we\r\nhave had complete control of the Government. We intend in the future to\r\ncarry on the Government in the same way that we have carried it on in\r\nthe past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA party whose members are radically at variance on most vital issues,\r\nand if united at all, are only united on issues where their attitude\r\nthreatens widespread disaster to the whole country, can not be trusted\r\nto govern in any matter. A party which, with facile ease, changes all\r\nits convictions before election can not be trusted to adhere with\r\ntenacity to any principle after election. A party fit to govern must\r\nhave convictions. In 1896 the Republican party came into power, and\r\nin 1900 it retained power on certain definite pledges, each of which\r\nwas scrupulously fulfilled. But in addition to meeting and solving the\r\nproblems which were issues in these campaigns, it also became necessary\r\nto meet other problems which arose after election; and it is no small\r\npart of our claim to public confidence that these were solved with the\r\nsame success that had attended the solution of those concerning which\r\nthe battles at the polls were fought. In other words, our governmental\r\nefficiency proved equal not only to the tasks that were anticipated,\r\nbut to doing each unanticipated task as it arose.\r\n\r\nWhen the contest of 1896 was decided, the question of the war with\r\nSpain was not an issue. When the contest of 1900 was decided, the shape\r\nwhich the Isthmian Canal question ultimately took could not have been\r\nforeseen. But the same qualities which enabled those responsible for\r\nmaking and administering the laws at Washington to deal successfully\r\nwith the tariff and the currency, enabled them also to deal with the\r\nSpanish War; and the same qualities which enabled them to act wisely\r\nin the Philippines, and in Cuba, also enabled them to do their duty\r\nas regards the problems connected with the trusts, and to secure the\r\nbuilding of the Isthmian Canal. We are content to rest our case before\r\nthe American people upon the fact that to adherence to a lofty ideal we\r\nhave added proved governmental efficiency. Therefore, our promises may\r\nsurely be trusted as regards any issue that is now before the people;\r\nand we may equally be trusted to deal with any problem which may\r\nhereafter arise.\r\n\r\nSo well has the work been done that our opponents do not venture to\r\nrecite the facts about our policies or acts and then oppose them.\r\nThey attack them only when they have first misrepresented them; for a\r\ntruthful recital would leave no room for adverse comment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPanama offers an instance in point. Our opponents can criticise what\r\nwe did in Panama only on condition of misstating what was done. The\r\nAdministration behaved throughout not only with good faith, but with\r\nextraordinary patience and large generosity toward those with whom\r\nit dealt. It was also mindful of American interests. It acted in\r\nstrict compliance with the law passed by Congress. Had not Panama been\r\npromptly recognized, and the transit across the Isthmus kept open, in\r\naccordance with our treaty rights and obligations, there would have\r\nensued endless guerilla warfare and possibly foreign complications;\r\nwhile all chance of building the canal would have been deferred,\r\ncertainly for years, perhaps for a generation or more. Criticism of\r\nthe action in this matter is simply criticism of the only possible\r\naction which could have secured the building of the canal; as well\r\nas the peace and quiet which we were, by treaty, bound to preserve\r\nalong the line of transit across the Isthmus. The service rendered\r\nthis country in securing the perpetual right to construct, maintain,\r\noperate, and defend the canal was so great that our opponents do not\r\nventure to raise the issue in straightforward fashion; for if so raised\r\nthere would be no issue. The decisive action which brought about this\r\nbeneficent result was the exercise by the President of the powers\r\nvested in him, and in him alone, by the Constitution; the power to\r\nrecognize foreign Governments by entering into diplomatic relations\r\nwith them, and the power to make treaties which, when ratified by\r\nthe Senate, become under the Constitution part of the supreme law of\r\nthe land. Neither in this nor in any other matter has there been the\r\nslightest failure to live up to the Constitution in letter and in\r\nspirit. But the Constitution must be observed positively as well as\r\nnegatively. The President’s duty is to serve the country in accordance\r\nwith the Constitution; and I should be derelict in my duty if I used\r\na false construction of the Constitution as a shield for weakness and\r\ntimidity, or as an excuse for governmental impotence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSimilar misrepresentation is the one weapon of our opponents in regard\r\nto our foreign policy, and the way the Navy has been made useful in\r\ncarrying out this policy. Here again all that we ask is that they\r\ntruthfully state what has been done, and then say whether or not\r\nthey object to it; for if continued in power we shall continue our\r\nforeign policy and our handling of the Navy on exactly the same lines\r\nin the future as in the past. To what phase of our foreign policy,\r\nand to what use of the Navy, do our opponents object? Do they object\r\nto the way in which the Monroe Doctrine has been strengthened and\r\nupheld? Never before has this doctrine been acquiesced in abroad as\r\nit is now; and yet, while upholding the rights of the weaker American\r\nrepublics against foreign aggression, the Administration has lost no\r\nopportunity to point out to these republics that those who seek equity\r\nshould come with clean hands, and that whoever claims liberty as a\r\nright must accept the responsibilities that go with the exercise of the\r\nright. Do our opponents object to what was done in reference to the\r\npetition of American citizens against the Kishineff massacre? or to\r\nthe protest against the treatment of the Jews in Roumania? or to the\r\nefforts that have been made in behalf of the Armenians in Turkey? No\r\nother Administration in our history, no other Government in the world,\r\nhas more consistently stood for the broadest spirit of brotherhood in\r\nour common humanity, or has held a more resolute attitude of protest\r\nagainst every wrong that outraged the civilization of the age at home\r\nor abroad. Do our opponents object to the fact that the international\r\ntribunal at The Hague was rescued from impotence, and turned into a\r\npotent instrument for peace among the nations? This Government has\r\nused that tribunal, and advocated its use by others, in pursuance of\r\nits policy to promote the cause of international peace and goodwill\r\nby all honorable methods. In carrying out this policy, it has settled\r\ndispute after dispute by arbitration or by friendly agreement. It has\r\nbehaved toward all nations, strong or weak, with courtesy, dignity, and\r\njustice; and it is now on excellent terms with all.\r\n\r\nDo our opponents object to the settlement of the Alaska boundary\r\nline? Do they object to the fact that after freeing Cuba we gave her\r\nreciprocal trade advantages with the United States, while at the same\r\ntime keeping naval stations in the island and providing against its\r\nsinking into chaos, or being conquered by any foreign Power? Do they\r\nobject to the fact that our flag now flies over Porto Rico? Do they\r\nobject to the acquisition of Hawaii? Once they “hauled down” our flag\r\nthere; we have hoisted it again; do they intend once more to haul it\r\ndown? Do they object to the part we played in China? Do they not know\r\nthat the voice of the United States would now count for nothing in the\r\nFar East if we had abandoned the Philippines and refused to do what\r\nwas done in China? Do they object to the fact that this Government\r\nsecured a peaceful settlement of the troubles in Venezuela two years\r\nago? Do they object to the presence of the ship-of-war off Colon when\r\nthe revolution broke out in Panama, and when only the presence of\r\nthis ship saved the lives of American citizens, and prevented insult\r\nto the flag? Do they object to the fact that American warships\r\nappeared promptly at the port of Beirut when an effort had been made\r\nto assassinate an American official, and in the port of Tangier when\r\nan American citizen had been abducted? and that in each case the wrong\r\ncomplained of was righted and expiated? and that within the last few\r\ndays the visit of an American squadron to Smyrna was followed by\r\nthe long-delayed concession of their just rights to those Americans\r\nconcerned in educational work in Turkey? Do they object to the trade\r\ntreaty with China, so full of advantage for the American people in the\r\nfuture? Do they object to the fact that the ships carrying the national\r\nflag now have a higher standard than ever before in marksmanship\r\nand in seamanship, as individual units and as component parts of\r\nsquadrons and fleets? If they object to any or all of these things,\r\nwe join issue with them. Our foreign policy has been not only highly\r\nadvantageous to the United States, but hardly less advantageous to the\r\nworld as a whole. Peace and goodwill have followed in its footsteps.\r\nThe Government has shown itself no less anxious to respect the rights\r\nof others than insistent that the rights of Americans be respected\r\nin return. As for the Navy, it has been and is now the most potent\r\nguarantee of peace; and it is such chiefly because it is formidable,\r\nand ready for use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen our opponents speak of “encroachments” by the Executive upon\r\nthe authority of Congress or the Judiciary, apparently the act they\r\nordinarily have in view is Pension Order No. 78, issued under the\r\nauthority of existing law. This order directed that hereafter any\r\nveteran of the Civil War who had reached the age of sixty-two should\r\nbe presumptively entitled to the pension of six dollars a month, given\r\nunder the dependent pension law to those whose capacity to earn their\r\nlivelihood by manual labor has been decreased fifty per cent, and that\r\nby the time the age of seventy was reached the presumption should be\r\nthat the physical disability was complete; the age being treated as an\r\nevidential fact in each case. This order was made in the performance\r\nof a duty imposed upon the President by an act of Congress, which\r\nrequires the Executive to make regulations to govern the subordinates\r\nof the Pension Office in determining who are entitled to pensions.\r\nPresident Cleveland had already exercised this power by a regulation\r\nwhich declared that seventy-five should be set as the age at which\r\ntotal disability should be conclusively presumed. Similarly, President\r\nMcKinley established sixty-five as the age at which half disability\r\nshould be conclusively presumed. The regulation now in question, in the\r\nexercise of the same power, supplemented these regulations made under\r\nPresidents Cleveland and McKinley.\r\n\r\nThe men who fought for union and for liberty in the years from 1861 to\r\n1865 not only saved this Nation from ruin, but rendered an inestimable\r\nservice to all mankind. We of the United States owe the fact that\r\nto-day we have a country to what they did; and the Nation has decreed\r\nby law that no one of them, if disabled from earning his own living,\r\nshall lack the pension to which he is entitled, not only as a matter\r\nof gratitude, but as a matter of justice. It is the policy of the\r\nRepublican party, steadily continued through many years, to treat the\r\nveterans of the Civil War in a spirit of broad liberality. The order\r\nin question carried out this policy, and is justified not merely on\r\nlegal grounds, but also on grounds of public morality. It is a matter\r\nof common knowledge that when the average man who depends for his\r\nwages upon bodily labor has reached the age of sixty-two his earning\r\nability is in all probability less by half than it was when he was in\r\nhis prime; and that by the time he has reached the age of seventy he\r\nhas probably lost all earning ability. If there is doubt upon this\r\npoint let the doubter examine the employees doing manual labor in any\r\ngreat manufactory or any great railroad, and find out how large is\r\nthe proportion of men between the ages of sixty-two and seventy, and\r\nwhether these men are still employed at the highly paid tasks which\r\nthey did in their prime. As a matter of fact, many railroads pension\r\ntheir employees when they have reached these ages, and in nations where\r\nold-age pensions prevail they always begin somewhere between the two\r\nlimits thus set. It is easy to test our opponents’ sincerity in this\r\nmatter. The order in question is revocable at the pleasure of the\r\nExecutive. If our opponents come into power they can revoke this order\r\nand announce that they will treat the veterans of sixty-two to seventy\r\nas presumably in full bodily vigor and not entitled to pensions. Will\r\nthey now authoritatively state that they intend to do this? If so, we\r\naccept the issue. If not, then we have the right to ask why they raise\r\nan issue which, when raised, they do not venture to meet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn addition to those acts of the Administration which they venture to\r\nassail only after misrepresenting them, there are others which they\r\ndare not overtly or officially attack, and yet which they covertly\r\nbring forward as reasons for the overthrow of the party. In certain\r\ngreat centres and with certain great interests our opponents make\r\nevery effort to show that the settlement of the Anthracite Coal Strike\r\nby the individual act of the President, and the successful suit\r\nagainst the Northern Securities Company—the Merger suit—undertaken\r\nby the Department of Justice, were acts because of which the present\r\nAdministration should be thrown from power. Yet they dare not openly\r\ncondemn either act. They dare not in any authoritative or formal manner\r\nsay that in either case wrong was done or error committed in the method\r\nof action, or in the choice of instruments for putting that action into\r\neffect. But what they dare not manfully assert in open day, they seek\r\nto use furtively and through special agents. It is perhaps natural that\r\nan attack so conducted should be made sometimes on the ground that too\r\nmuch, sometimes on the ground that too little, has been done. Some\r\nof our opponents complain because under the anti-trust and interstate\r\ncommerce laws suits were undertaken which have been successful; others,\r\nbecause suits were not undertaken which would have been unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic State Convention in New York dealt with the Anthracite\r\nCoal Strike by demanding in deliberate and formal fashion that the\r\nNational Government should take possession of the coal fields; yet\r\nchampions of that convention’s cause now condemn the fact that there\r\nwas any action by the President at all—though they must know that it\r\nwas only this action by the President which prevented the movement for\r\nnational ownership of the coal fields from gaining what might well have\r\nbeen an irresistible impetus. Such mutually destructive criticisms\r\nfurnish an adequate measure of the chance for coherent action or\r\nconstructive legislation if our opponents should be given power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo much for what our opponents openly or covertly advance in the\r\nway of an attack on the acts of the Administration. When we come to\r\nconsider the policies for which they profess to stand we are met with\r\nthe difficulty always arising when statements of policy are so made\r\nthat they can be interpreted in different ways. On some of the vital\r\nquestions that have confronted the American people in the last decade,\r\nour opponents take the position that silence is the best possible\r\nway to convey their views. They contend that their lukewarm attitude\r\nof partial acquiescence in what others have accomplished entitles\r\nthem to be made the custodians of the financial honor and commercial\r\ninterests which they have but recently sought to ruin. Being unable to\r\nagree among themselves as to whether the gold standard is a curse or\r\na blessing, and as to whether we ought or ought not to have free and\r\nunlimited coinage of silver, they have apparently thought it expedient\r\nto avoid any committal on these subjects, and individually each to\r\nfollow his particular bent. Their nearest approach to a majority\r\njudgment seems to be that it is now inexpedient to assert their\r\nconvictions one way or the other, and that the establishment of the\r\ngold standard by the Republican party should not be disturbed unless\r\nthere is an alteration in the relative quantity of production of silver\r\nand gold. Men who hold sincere convictions on vital questions can\r\nrespect equally sincere men with whose views they radically differ; and\r\nmen may confess a change of faith without compromising their honor or\r\ntheir self-respect. But it is difficult to respect an attitude of mind\r\nsuch as has been fairly described above; and where there is no respect\r\nthere can be no trust. A policy with so slender a basis of principle\r\nwould not stand the strain of a single year of business adversity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe, on the contrary, believe in the gold standard as fixed by the usage\r\nand verdict of the business world, and in a sound monetary system, as\r\nmatters of principle; as matters not of momentary political expediency,\r\nbut of permanent organic policy. In 1896 and again in 1900 farsighted\r\nmen, without regard to their party fealty in the past, joined to\r\nwork against what they regarded as a debased monetary system. The\r\npolicies which they championed have been steadfastly adhered to by the\r\nAdministration; and by the act of March 14, 1900, Congress established\r\nthe single gold standard as the measure of our monetary value. This act\r\nreceived the support of every Republican in the House, and of every\r\nRepublican except one in the Senate. Of our opponents, eleven supported\r\nit in the House and two in the Senate; and one hundred and fifty\r\nopposed it in the House and twenty-eight in the Senate. The record of\r\nthe last seven years proves that the party now in power can be trusted\r\nto take the additional action necessary to improve and strengthen our\r\nmonetary system, and that our opponents can not be so trusted. The\r\nfundamental fact is that in a popular government such as ours no policy\r\nis irrevocably settled by law unless the people keep in control of the\r\nGovernment men who believe in that policy as a matter of deep-rooted\r\nconviction. Laws can always be revoked; it is the spirit and the\r\npurpose of those responsible for their enactment and administration\r\nwhich must be fixed and unchangeable. It is idle to say that the\r\nmonetary standard of the Nation is irrevocably fixed so long as the\r\nparty which at the last election cast approximately forty-six per cent\r\nof the total vote refuses to put in its platform any statement that\r\nthe question is settled. A determination to remain silent can not be\r\naccepted as equivalent to a recantation. Until our opponents as a party\r\nexplicitly adopt the views which we hold and upon which we have acted\r\nand are acting, in the matter of sound currency, the only real way to\r\nkeep the question from becoming unsettled is to keep the Republican\r\nparty in power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs for what our opponents say in reference to capital and labor,\r\nindividual or corporate, here again all we need by way of answer is to\r\npoint to what we have actually done, and to say that if continued in\r\npower we shall continue to carry out the policy we have been pursuing,\r\nand to execute the laws as resolutely and fearlessly in the future as\r\nwe have executed them in the past. In my speech of acceptance I said:\r\n\r\n“We recognize the organization of capital and the organization of\r\nlabor as natural outcomes of our industrial system. Each kind of\r\norganization is to be favored so long as it acts in a spirit of justice\r\nand of regard for the rights of others. Each is to be granted the full\r\nprotection of the law, and each in turn is to be held to a strict\r\nobedience to the law; for no man is above it and no man below it. The\r\nhumblest individual is to have his rights safeguarded as scrupulously\r\nas those of the strongest organization, for each is to receive justice,\r\nno more and no less. The problems with which we have to deal in our\r\nmodern industrial and social life are manifold; but the spirit in which\r\nit is necessary to approach their solution is simply the spirit of\r\nhonesty, of courage, and of common-sense.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe action of the Attorney-General in enforcing the anti-trust and\r\ninterstate commerce laws, and the action of the last Congress in\r\nenlarging the scope of the interstate commerce law, and in creating\r\nthe Department of Commerce and Labor, with a Bureau of Corporations,\r\nhave for the first time opened a chance for the National Government\r\nto deal intelligently and adequately with the questions affecting\r\nsociety, whether for good or for evil, because of the accumulation of\r\ncapital in great corporations, and because of the new relations caused\r\nthereby. These laws are now being administered with entire efficiency;\r\nand as, in their working, need is shown for amendment or addition\r\nto them—whether better to secure the proper publicity, or better to\r\nguarantee the rights of shippers, or in any other direction—this need\r\nwill be met. It is now asserted “that the common law, as developed,\r\naffords a complete legal remedy against monopolies.” But there is no\r\ncommon law of the United States. Its rules can be enforced only by\r\nthe State courts and officers. No Federal court or officer could take\r\nany action whatever under them. It was this fact, coupled with the\r\ninability of the States to control trusts and monopolies, which led to\r\nthe passage of the Federal statutes known as the Sherman Anti-Trust Act\r\nand the Interstate Commerce Act; and it is only through the exercise\r\nof the powers conferred by these acts, and by the statutes of the last\r\nCongress supplementing them, that the National Government acquires any\r\njurisdiction over the subject. To say that action against trusts and\r\nmonopolies should be limited to the application of the common law is\r\nequivalent to saying that the National Government should take no action\r\nwhatever to regulate them.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly, the multiplication of trusts and their increase in power\r\nhas been largely due to the “failure of officials charged with the duty\r\nof enforcing the law to take the necessary procedure.” Such stricture\r\nupon the failure of the officials of the National Government to do\r\ntheir duty in this matter is certainly not wholly undeserved as far as\r\nthe Administration preceding President McKinley’s is concerned; but\r\nit has no application at all to Republican administration. It is also\r\nundoubtedly true that what is most needed is “officials having both the\r\ndisposition and the courage to enforce existing law.” This is precisely\r\nthe need that has been met by the consistent and steadily continued\r\naction of the Department of Justice under the present Administration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far as the rights of the individual wage-worker and the individual\r\ncapitalist are concerned, both as regards one another, as regards\r\nthe public, and as regards organized capital and labor, the position\r\nof the Administration has been so clear that there is no excuse\r\nfor misrepresenting it, and no ground for opposing it unless\r\nmisrepresented. Within the limits defined by the National Constitution\r\nthe National Administration has sought to secure to each man the full\r\nenjoyment of his right to live his life and dispose of his property\r\nand his labor as he deems best, so long as he wrongs no one else. It\r\nhas shown in effective fashion that in endeavoring to make good this\r\nguarantee, it treats all men, rich or poor, whatever their creed, their\r\ncolor, or their birthplace, as standing alike before the law. Under our\r\nform of government the sphere in which the Nation as distinguished from\r\nthe State can act is narrowly circumscribed; but within that sphere\r\nall that could be done has been done. All thinking men are aware of\r\nthe restrictions upon the power of action of the National Government\r\nin such matters. Being ourselves mindful of them, we have been\r\nscrupulously careful on the one hand to be moderate in our promises,\r\nand on the other hand to keep these promises in letter and in spirit.\r\nOur opponents have been hampered by no such considerations. They\r\nhave promised, and many of them now promise, action which they could\r\nby no possibility take in the exercise of constitutional power, and\r\nwhich, if attempted, would bring business to a standstill; they have\r\nused, and often now use, language of wild invective and appeal to all\r\nthe baser passions which tend to excite one set of Americans against\r\ntheir fellow-Americans; and yet whenever they have had power they\r\nhave fittingly supplemented this extravagance of promise by absolute\r\nnullity in performance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis Government is based upon the fundamental idea that each man, no\r\nmatter what his occupation, his race, or his religious belief, is\r\nentitled to be treated on his worth as a man, and neither favored nor\r\ndiscriminated against because of any accident in his position. Even\r\nhere at home there is painful difficulty in the effort to realize this\r\nideal; and the attempt to secure from other nations acknowledgment\r\nof it sometimes encounters obstacles that are wellnigh insuperable;\r\nfor there are many nations which in the slow procession of the ages\r\nhave not yet reached that point where the principles which Americans\r\nregard as axiomatic obtain any recognition whatever. One of the chief\r\ndifficulties arises in connection with certain American citizens of\r\nforeign birth, or of particular creed, who desire to travel abroad.\r\nRussia, for instance, refuses to admit and protect Jews. Turkey refuses\r\nto admit and protect certain sects of Christians. This Government\r\nhas consistently demanded equal protection abroad for all American\r\ncitizens, whether native or naturalized. On March 27, 1899, Secretary\r\nHay sent a letter of instructions to all the diplomatic and consular\r\nofficers of the United States, in which he said: “This Department\r\ndoes not discriminate between native-born and naturalized citizens in\r\naccording them protection while they are abroad, equality of treatment\r\nbeing required by the laws of the United States.” These orders to\r\nour agents abroad have been repeated again and again, and are treated\r\nas the fundamental rule of conduct laid down for them, proceeding\r\nupon the theory “that all naturalized citizens of the United States\r\nwhile in foreign countries are entitled to and shall receive from this\r\nGovernment the same protection of person and property which is accorded\r\nto native-born citizens.” In issuing passports the State Department\r\nnever discriminates, or alludes to any man’s religion; and in granting\r\nto every American citizen, native or naturalized, Christian or Jew,\r\nthe same passport, so far as it has power it insists that all foreign\r\nGovernments shall accept the passport as prima facie proof that the\r\nperson therein described is a citizen of the United States and entitled\r\nto protection as such. It is a standing order to every American\r\ndiplomatic and consular officer to protect every American citizen, of\r\nwhatever faith, from unjust molestation; and our officers abroad have\r\nbeen stringently required to comply with this order.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, the demand of our opponents that negotiations\r\nbe begun to secure equal treatment of all Americans from those\r\nGovernments which do not now accord it, shows either ignorance of the\r\nfacts or insincerity. No change of policy in the method or manner\r\nof negotiation would add effectiveness to what the State Department\r\nhas done and is doing. The steady pressure which the Department has\r\nbeen keeping up in the past will be continued in the future. This\r\nAdministration has on all proper occasions given clear expression to\r\nthe belief of the American people that discrimination and oppression\r\nbecause of religion, wherever practiced, are acts of injustice before\r\nGod and man; and in making evident to the world the depth of American\r\nconvictions in this regard we have gone to the very limit of diplomatic\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking evidence of our opponents’ insincerity in this matter\r\nthat with their demand for radical action by the State Department they\r\ncouple a demand for a reduction in our small military establishment.\r\nYet they must know that the heed paid to our protests against\r\nill-treatment of our citizens will be exactly proportionate to the\r\nbelief in our ability to make these protests effective should the need\r\narise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur opponents have now declared themselves in favor of the Civil\r\nService law, the repeal of which they demanded in 1900 and in 1896. If\r\nconsistent, they should have gone one step further and congratulated\r\nthe country upon the way in which the Civil Service law is now\r\nadministered, and the way in which the classified service has been\r\nextended. The exceptions from examinations are fewer by far than ever\r\nbefore, and are confined to individual cases, where the application of\r\nthe rules would be impracticable, unwise, unjust, or unnecessary. The\r\nadministration of the great body of the classified civil service is\r\nfree from politics, and appointments and removals have been put upon\r\na business basis. Statistics show that there is little difference\r\nbetween the tenure of the Federal classified employees and that of the\r\nemployees of private business corporations. Less than one per cent of\r\nthe classified employees are over seventy years of age, and in the main\r\nthe service rendered is vigorous and efficient. Where the merit system\r\nwas of course most needed was in the Philippine Islands; and a civil\r\nservice law of very advanced type has there been put into operation and\r\nscrupulously observed. Without one exception every appointment in the\r\nPhilippines has been made in accordance with the strictest standard of\r\nfitness, and without heed to any other consideration.\r\n\r\nFinally, we come to certain matters upon which our opponents do in\r\ntheir platform of principles definitely take issue with us, and where,\r\nif they are sincere, their triumph would mean disaster to the country.\r\nBut exactly as it is impossible to call attention to the present\r\npromises and past record of our opponents without seeming offensive,\r\nso it is impossible to compare their platform with their other and\r\nlater official utterances and not create doubt as to their sincerity.\r\nIn their private or unofficial utterances many of them frankly advance\r\nthis insincerity as a merit, taking the position that as regards the\r\npoints on which I am about to speak they have no intention of keeping\r\ntheir promises or of departing from the policies now established, and\r\nthat therefore they can be trusted not to abuse the power they seek.\r\n\r\nWhen we take up the great question of the tariff we are at once\r\nconfronted by the doubt as to whether our opponents do or do not mean\r\nwhat they say. They say that “protection is robbery,” and promise to\r\ncarry themselves accordingly if they are given power. Yet prominent\r\npersons among them assert that they do not really mean this and that\r\nif they come into power they will adopt our policy as regards the\r\ntariff; while others seem anxious to prove that it is safe to give them\r\npartial power, because the power would be only partial, and therefore\r\nthey would not be able to do mischief. The last is certainly a curious\r\nplea to advance on behalf of a party seeking to obtain control of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it is worth while to say a word as to the attempt to\r\nidentify the question of tariff revision or tariff reduction with a\r\nsolution of the trust question. This is always a sign of desire to\r\navoid any real effort to deal adequately with the trust question. In\r\nspeaking on this point at Minneapolis, on April 4, 1903, I said:\r\n\r\n  “The question of tariff revision, speaking broadly, stands wholly\r\n  apart from the question of dealing with the trusts. No change\r\n  in tariff duties can have any substantial effect in solving the\r\n  so-called trust problem. Certain great trusts or great corporations\r\n  are wholly unaffected by the tariff. Almost all the others that\r\n  are of any importance have as a matter of fact numbers of smaller\r\n  American competitors; and of course a change in the tariff which\r\n  would work injury to the large corporation would work not merely\r\n  injury but destruction to its smaller competitors; and equally of\r\n  course such a change would mean disaster to all the wage-workers\r\n  connected with either the large or the small corporations. From the\r\n  standpoint of those interested in the solution of the trust problem\r\n  such a change would therefore merely mean that the trust was relieved\r\n  of the competition of its weaker American competitors, and thrown\r\n  only into competition with foreign competitors; and that the first\r\n  effort to meet this new competition would be made by cutting down\r\n  wages, and would therefore be primarily at the cost of labor. In\r\n  the case of some of our greatest trusts such a change might confer\r\n  upon them a positive benefit. Speaking broadly, it is evident that\r\n  the changes in the tariff will affect the trusts for weal or for woe\r\n  simply as they affect the whole country. The tariff affects trusts\r\n  only as it affects all other interests. It makes all these interests,\r\n  large or small, profitable; and its benefits can be taken from the\r\n  large only under penalty of taking them from the small also.”\r\n\r\nThere is little for me to add to this. It is but ten years since the\r\nlast attempt was made, by means of lowering the tariff, to prevent some\r\npeople from prospering too much. The attempt was entirely successful.\r\nThe tariff law of that year was among the causes which in that year and\r\nfor some time afterward effectually prevented anybody from prospering\r\ntoo much, and labor from prospering at all. Undoubtedly it would\r\nbe possible at the present time to prevent any of the trusts from\r\nremaining prosperous by the simple expedient of making such a sweeping\r\nchange in the tariff as to paralyze the industries of the country. The\r\ntrusts would cease to prosper; but their smaller competitors would be\r\nruined, and the wage-workers would starve, while it would not pay the\r\nfarmer to haul his produce to market. The evils connected with the\r\ntrusts can be reached only by rational effort, step by step, along\r\nthe lines taken by Congress and the Executive during the past three\r\nyears. If a tariff law is passed under which the country prospers,\r\nas the country has prospered under the present tariff law, then all\r\nclasses will share in the prosperity. If a tariff law is passed aimed\r\nat preventing the prosperity of some of our people, it is as certain as\r\nanything can be that this aim will be achieved only by cutting down the\r\nprosperity of all of our people.\r\n\r\nOf course, if our opponents are not sincere in their proposal to\r\nabolish the system of a protective tariff, there is no use in arguing\r\nthe matter at all, save by pointing out again that if on one great\r\nissue they do not mean what they say, it is hardly safe to trust\r\nthem on any other issue. But if they are sincere in this matter,\r\nthen their advent to power would mean domestic misfortune and misery\r\nas widespread and far-reaching as that which we saw ten years ago.\r\nWhen they speak of protection as “robbery,” they of course must mean\r\nthat it is immoral to enact a tariff designed (as is the present\r\nprotective tariff) to secure to the American wage-worker the benefit\r\nof the high standard of living which we desire to see kept up in\r\nthis country. Now to speak of the tariff in this sense as “robbery,”\r\nthereby giving it a moral relation, is not merely rhetorical; it is on\r\nits face false. The question of what tariff is best for our people is\r\nprimarily one of expediency, to be determined not on abstract academic\r\ngrounds, but in the light of experience. It is a matter of business;\r\nfor fundamentally ours is a business people—manufacturers, merchants,\r\nfarmers, wage-workers, professional men, all alike. Our experience as a\r\npeople in the past has certainly not shown us that we could afford in\r\nthis matter to follow those professional counselors who have confined\r\nthemselves to study in the closet; for the actual working of the\r\ntariff has emphatically contradicted their theories. From time to time\r\nschedules must undoubtedly be rearranged and readjusted to meet the\r\nshifting needs of the country; but this can with safety be done only\r\nby those who are committed to the cause of the protective system. To\r\nuproot and destroy that system would be to ensure the prostration of\r\nbusiness, the closing of factories, the impoverishment of the farmer,\r\nthe ruin of the capitalist, and the starvation of the wage-worker.\r\nYet, if protection is indeed “robbery,” and if our opponents really\r\nbelieve what they say, then it is precisely to the destruction and\r\nuprooting of the tariff, and therefore of our business and industry,\r\nthat they are pledged. When our opponents last obtained power it was\r\non a platform declaring a protective tariff “unconstitutional”; and\r\nthe effort to put this declaration into practice was one of the causes\r\nof the general national prostration lasting from 1893 to 1897. If a\r\nprotective tariff is either “unconstitutional” or “robbery,” then it\r\nis just as unconstitutional, just as much robbery, to revise it down,\r\nstill leaving it protective, as it would be to enact it. In other\r\nwords, our opponents have committed themselves to the destruction of\r\nthe protective principle in the tariff, using words which if honestly\r\nused forbid them from permitting this principle to obtain in even the\r\nsmallest degree.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur opponents assert that they believe in reciprocity. Their action\r\non the most important reciprocity treaty recently negotiated—that\r\nwith Cuba—does not bear out this assertion. Moreover, there can be\r\nno reciprocity unless there is a substantial tariff; free trade\r\nand reciprocity are not compatible. We are on record as favoring\r\narrangements for reciprocal trade relations with other countries,\r\nthese arrangements to be on an equitable basis of benefit to both the\r\ncontracting parties. The Republican party stands pledged to every\r\nwise and consistent method of increasing the foreign commerce of the\r\ncountry. That it has kept its pledge is proven by the fact that while\r\nthe domestic trade of this country exceeds in volume the entire export\r\nand import trade of all the nations of the world, the United States\r\nhas in addition secured more than an eighth of the export trade of the\r\nworld, standing first among the nations in this respect. The United\r\nStates has exported during the last seven years nearly ten billions of\r\ndollars’ worth of goods—on an average half as much again annually as\r\nduring the previous four years, when many of our people were consuming\r\nnothing but necessaries, and some of them a scanty supply even of these.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, in speaking at Logansport, Indiana, I said:\r\n\r\n“The one consideration which must never be omitted in a tariff change\r\nis the imperative need of preserving the American standard of living\r\nfor the American workingman. The tariff-rate must never fall below\r\nthat which will protect the American workingman by allowing for the\r\ndifference between the general labor cost here and abroad, so as at\r\nleast to equalize the conditions arising from the difference in the\r\nstandard of labor here and abroad—a difference which it should be our\r\naim to foster in so far as it represents the needs of better educated,\r\nbetter paid, better fed, and better clothed workingmen of a higher\r\ntype than any to be found in a foreign country. At all hazards, and\r\nno matter what else is sought for or accomplished by changes of the\r\ntariff, the American workingman must be protected in his standard of\r\nwages, that is, in his standard of living, and must be secured the\r\nfullest opportunity of employment. Our laws should in no event afford\r\nadvantage to foreign industries over American industries. They should\r\nin no event do less than equalize the difference in conditions at home\r\nand abroad.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of regret that the protective tariff policy, which,\r\nduring the last forty-odd years, has become part of the very fibre of\r\nthe country, is not now accepted as definitely established. Surely we\r\nhave a right to say that it has passed beyond the domain of theory, and\r\na right to expect that not only its original advocates but those who\r\nat one time distrusted it on theoretic grounds should now acquiesce\r\nin the results that have been proved over and over again by actual\r\nexperience. These forty-odd years have been the most prosperous years\r\nthis Nation has ever seen; more prosperous years than any other nation\r\nhas ever seen. Beyond question this prosperity could not have come if\r\nthe American people had not possessed the necessary thrift, energy, and\r\nbusiness intelligence to turn their vast material resources to account.\r\nBut it is no less true that it is our economic policy as regards the\r\ntariff and finance which has enabled us as a nation to make such good\r\nuse of the individual capacities of our citizens, and the natural\r\nresources of our country. Every class of our people is benefited by\r\nthe protective tariff. During the last few years the merchant has seen\r\nthe export trade of this country grow faster than ever in our previous\r\nhistory. The manufacturer could not keep his factory running if it\r\nwere not for the protective tariff. The wage-worker would do well\r\nto remember that if protection is “robbery,” and is to be punished\r\naccordingly, he will be the first to pay the penalty; for either he\r\nwill be turned adrift entirely, or his wages will be cut down to the\r\nstarvation point. As conclusively shown by the bulletins of the Bureau\r\nof Labor, the purchasing power of the average wage received by the\r\nwage-worker has grown faster than the cost of living, and this in\r\nspite of the continual shortening of working hours. The accumulated\r\nsavings of the workingmen of the country, as shown by the deposits\r\nin the savings banks, have increased by leaps and bounds. At no time\r\nin the history of this or any other country has there been an era so\r\nproductive of material benefit alike to workingman and employer as\r\nduring the seven years that have just passed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe farmer has benefited quite as much as the manufacturer, the\r\nmerchant, and the wage-worker. The most welcome and impressive fact\r\nestablished by the last census is the wide and even distribution\r\nof wealth among all classes of our countrymen. The chief agencies\r\nin producing this distribution are shown by the census to be the\r\ndevelopment of manufactures, and the application of new inventions\r\nto universal use. The result has been an increasing interdependence\r\nof agriculture and manufactures. Agriculture is now, as it always\r\nhas been, the basis of civilization. The six million farms of the\r\nUnited States, operated by men who, as a class, are steadfast,\r\nsingle-minded, and industrious, form the basis of all the other\r\nachievements of the American people and are more fruitful than all\r\ntheir other resources. The men on those six million farms receive\r\nfrom the protective tariff what they most need, and that is the best\r\nof all possible markets. All other classes depend upon the farmer,\r\nbut the farmer in turn depends upon the market they furnish him for\r\nhis produce. The annual output of our agricultural products is nearly\r\nfour billions of dollars. Their increase in value has been prodigious,\r\nalthough agriculture has languished in most other countries; and the\r\nmain factor in this increase is the corresponding increase of our\r\nmanufacturing industries. American farmers have prospered because the\r\ngrowth of their market has kept pace with the growth of their farms.\r\nThe additional market continually furnished for agricultural products\r\nby domestic manufacturers has been far in excess of the outlet to\r\nother lands. An export trade in farm products is necessary to dispose\r\nof our surplus; and the export trade of our farmers, both in animal\r\nproducts and in plant products, has very largely increased. Without\r\nthe enlarged home market to keep this surplus down, we should have\r\nto reduce production or else feed the world at less than the cost\r\nof production. In the forty years ending in 1900 the total value of\r\nfarm property increased twelve and a half billions of dollars; the\r\nfarmer gaining even more during this period than the manufacturer.\r\nLong ago overproduction would have checked the marvelous development\r\nof our national agriculture, but for the steadily increasing demand\r\nof American manufacturers for farm products required as raw materials\r\nfor steadily expanding industries. The farmer has become dependent\r\nupon the manufacturer to utilize that portion of his produce which\r\ndoes not go directly to food supply. In 1900 fifty-two per cent, or\r\na little over half, of the total value of the farm products of the\r\nNation was consumed in manufacturing industries as the raw materials\r\nof the factories. Evidently the manufacturer is the farmer’s best and\r\nmost direct customer. Moreover, the American manufacturer purchases\r\nhis farm supplies almost exclusively in his own country. Nine-tenths\r\nof all the raw materials of every kind and description consumed in\r\nAmerican manufactories are of American production. The manufacturing\r\nestablishments tend steadily to migrate into the heart of the great\r\nagricultural districts. The centre of the manufacturing industry in\r\n1900 was near the middle of Ohio, and it is moving westward at the rate\r\nof about thirty miles in every decade; and this movement is invariably\r\naccompanied by a marked increase in the value of farm lands. Local\r\ncauses, notably the competition between new farm lands and old farm\r\nlands, tend here and there to obscure what is happening; but it is as\r\ncertain as the operation of any economic law that in the country as a\r\nwhole farm values will continue to increase as the partnership between\r\nmanufacturer and farmer grows more intimate through further advance of\r\nindustrial science. The American manufacturer never could have placed\r\nthis Nation at the head of the manufacturing nations of the world if\r\nhe had not had behind him, securing him every variety of raw material,\r\nthe exhaustless resources of the American farm, developed by the skill\r\nand the enterprise of intelligent and educated American farmers. On the\r\nother hand, the debt of the farmers to the manufacturers is equally\r\nheavy, and the future of American agriculture is bound up in the future\r\nof American manufactures. The two industries have become, under the\r\neconomic policy of our Government, so closely interwoven, so mutually\r\ninterdependent, that neither can hope to maintain itself at the\r\nhigh-water mark of progress without the other. Whatever makes to the\r\nadvantage of one is equally to the advantage of the other.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo it is as between the capitalist and the wage-worker. Here and there\r\nthere may be an unequal sharing as between the two in the benefits that\r\nhave come by protection; but benefits have come to both; and a reversal\r\nin policy would mean damage to both; and while the damage would be\r\nheavy to all, it would be heaviest, and it would fall soonest, upon\r\nthose who are paid in the form of wages each week or each month for\r\nthat week’s or that month’s work.\r\n\r\nConditions change and the laws must be modified from time to time\r\nto fit new exigencies. But the genuine underlying principle of\r\nprotection, as it has been embodied in all but one of the American\r\ntariff laws for the last forty years, has worked out results so\r\nbeneficent, so evenly and widely spread, so advantageous alike to\r\nfarmers and capitalists and workingmen, to commerce and trade of every\r\nkind, that the American people, if they show their usual practical\r\nbusiness sense, will insist that when these laws are modified they\r\nshall be modified with the utmost care and conservatism, and by the\r\nfriends and not the enemies of the protective system. They can not\r\nafford to trust the modification to those who treat protection and\r\nrobbery as synonymous terms.\r\n\r\nIn closing what I have to say about the system of promoting American\r\nindustry let me add a word of cordial agreement with the policy of in\r\nsome way including within its benefits, by appropriate legislation, the\r\nAmerican merchant marine. It is not creditable to us as a nation that\r\nour great export and import trade should be wellnigh exclusively in the\r\nhands of foreigners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to know if our opponents are really sincere in their\r\ndemand for the reduction of the Army. If insincere, there is no need\r\nfor comment, and if sincere, what shall we say in speaking to rational\r\npersons of an appeal to reduce an Army of sixty thousand men which is\r\ntaking care of the interests of over eighty million people? The Army\r\nis now relatively smaller than it was in the days of Washington, when\r\non the peace establishment there were thirty-six hundred soldiers,\r\nwhile there were a little less than four millions of population;\r\nsmaller than it was in the peaceful days of Jefferson, when there were\r\nfifty-one hundred soldiers to five million three hundred thousand\r\npopulation. There is now one soldier to every fourteen hundred people\r\nin this country—less than one-tenth of one per cent. We can not be\r\nasked seriously to argue as to the amount of possible tyranny contained\r\nin these figures. The Army as it is now is as small as it can possibly\r\nbe and serve its purpose as an effective nucleus for the organization,\r\nequipment, and supply of a volunteer army in time of need. It is now\r\nused, as never before, for aiding in the upbuilding of the organized\r\nmilitia of the country. The War Department is engaged in a systematic\r\neffort to strengthen and develop the National Guard in the several\r\nStates; as witness, among many other instances, the great field\r\nmanœuvres at Manassas, which have just closed. If our opponents should\r\ncome into power they could not reduce our Army below its present size\r\nwithout greatly impairing its efficiency and abandoning part of the\r\nnational duty. In short, in this matter, if our opponents should come\r\ninto power they would either have to treat this particular promise of\r\nthe year 1904 as they now treat the promises they made in 1896 and\r\n1900, that is, as possessing no binding force; or else they would have\r\nto embark on a policy which would be ludicrous at the moment, and\r\nfraught with grave danger to the national honor in the future.\r\n\r\nOur opponents contend that the Government is now administered\r\nextravagantly, and that whereas there was “a surplus of $80,000,000 in\r\n1900” there is “a deficit of more than $40,000,000” in the year that\r\nhas just closed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis deficit is imaginary, and is obtained by including in the ordinary\r\ncurrent expenses the sum of fifty millions, which was paid for the\r\nright of way of the Panama Canal out of the accumulated surplus in\r\nthe Treasury. Comparing the current or ordinary expenditures for the\r\ntwo years, there was a surplus of nearly eighty millions for the year\r\n1900, and of only a little more than eight millions for the year\r\nthat has just closed. But this diminution of the annual surplus was\r\nbrought about designedly by the abolition of the war taxes in the\r\ninterval between the two dates. The acts of March 2, 1901, and April\r\n12, 1902, cut down the internal revenue taxes to an amount estimated\r\nat one hundred and five millions a year. In other words, the reduction\r\nof taxation has been considerably greater than the reduction in the\r\nannual surplus. Since the close of the war with Spain there has been\r\nno substantial change in the rate of annual expenditures. As compared\r\nwith the fiscal year ending in June, 1901, for example, the fiscal year\r\nthat has just closed showed a relatively small increase in expenditure\r\n(excluding the canal payment already referred to), while the year\r\nprevious showed a relatively small decrease.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the Nation have been managed in a spirit of economy\r\nas far removed from waste as from niggardliness; and in the future\r\nevery effort will be continued to secure an economy as strict as is\r\nconsistent with efficiency. Once more our opponents have promised what\r\nthey can not or should not perform. The prime reason why the expenses\r\nof the Government have increased of recent years is to be found in the\r\nfact that the people, after mature thought, have deemed it wise to have\r\ncertain new forms of work for the public undertaken by the public.\r\nThis necessitates such expenditures, for instance, as those for rural\r\nfree delivery, or for the inspection of meats under the Department\r\nof Agriculture, or for irrigation. But these new expenditures are\r\nnecessary; no one would seriously propose to abandon them; and yet it\r\nis idle to declaim against the increased expense of the Government\r\nunless it is intended to cut down the very expenditures which cause the\r\nincrease. The pensions to the veterans of the Civil War are demanded\r\nby every sentiment of regard and gratitude. The rural free-delivery\r\nis of the greatest use and convenience to the farmers, a body of men\r\nwho live under conditions which make them ordinarily receive little\r\ndirect return for what they pay toward the support of the Government.\r\nThe irrigation policy in the arid and semi-arid regions of the West\r\nis one fraught with the most beneficent and far-reaching good to the\r\nactual settlers, the homemakers, whose encouragement is a traditional\r\nfeature in America’s National policy. Do our opponents grudge the fifty\r\nmillions paid for the Panama Canal? Do they intend to cut down on the\r\npensions to the veterans of the Civil War? Do they intend to put a stop\r\nto the irrigation policy? or to the permanent census bureau? or to\r\nimmigration inspection? Do they intend to abolish rural free-delivery?\r\nDo they intend to cut down the Navy? or the Alaskan telegraph system?\r\nDo they intend to dismantle our coast fortifications? If there is to\r\nbe a real and substantial cutting down in national expenditures it\r\nmust be in such matters as these. The Department of Agriculture has\r\ndone service of incalculable value to the farmers of this country in\r\nmany different lines. Do our opponents wish to cut down the money for\r\nthis service? They can do it only by destroying the usefulness of the\r\nservice itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe public work of the United States has never been conducted with a\r\nhigher degree of honesty and efficiency than at the present time; and a\r\nspecial meed of praise belongs to those officials responsible for the\r\nPhilippines and Porto Rico, where the administrations have been models\r\nof their kind. Of course, wrong has occasionally occurred, but it has\r\nbeen relentlessly stamped out. We have known no party in dealing with\r\noffenders, and have hunted down without mercy every wrong-doer in the\r\nservice of the Nation whom it was possible by the utmost vigilance to\r\ndetect; for the public servant who betrays his trust and the private\r\nindividual who debauches him stand as the worst of criminals, because\r\ntheir crimes are crimes against the entire community, and not only\r\nagainst this generation, but against the generations that are yet to be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur opponents promise independence to the Philippine Islands. Here\r\nagain we are confronted by the fact that their irreconcilable\r\ndifferences of opinion among themselves, their proved inability to\r\ncreate a constructive policy when in power, and their readiness, for\r\nthe sake of momentary political expediency, to abandon the principles\r\nupon which they have insisted as essential, conspire to puzzle us\r\nas to whether they do or do not intend in good faith to carry out\r\nthis promise if they are given control of the Government. In their\r\nplatform they declare for independence, apparently—for their language\r\nis a little obscure—without qualification as to time; and indeed a\r\nqualification as to time is an absurdity, for we have neither right\r\nnor power to bind our successors when it is impossible to foretell the\r\nconditions which may confront them; while if there is any principle\r\ninvolved in the matter, it is just as wrong to deny independence for\r\na few years as to deny it for an indefinite period. But in later and\r\nequally official utterances by our opponents the term self-government\r\nwas substituted for independence; the words used being so chosen that\r\nin their natural construction they described precisely the policy now\r\nbeing carried on. The language of the platform indicated a radical\r\nchange of policy; the later utterances indicated a continuance of the\r\npresent policy. But this caused trouble in their own ranks; and in\r\na still later, although less formal, utterance, the self-government\r\npromise was recanted, and independence at some future time was promised\r\nin its place. They have occupied three entirely different positions\r\nwithin fifty days. Which is the promise they really intend to keep?\r\nThey do not know their own minds; and no one can tell how long they\r\nwould keep of the same mind, should they by any chance come to a\r\nworking agreement among themselves. If such ambiguity affected only\r\nthe American people it would not so greatly matter; for the American\r\npeople can take care of themselves. But the Filipinos are in no such\r\ncondition. Confidence is with them a plant of slow growth. They\r\nhave been taught to trust the word of this Government because this\r\nGovernment has promised nothing which it did not perform. If promised\r\nindependence they will expect independence; not in the remote future,\r\nfor their descendants, but immediately, for themselves. If the promise\r\nthus made is not immediately fulfilled they will regard it as broken,\r\nand will not again trust to American faith; and it would be indeed\r\na wicked thing to deceive them in such fashion. Moreover, even if\r\nthe promise were made to take effect only in the distant future, the\r\nFilipinos would be thrown into confusion thereby. Instead of continuing\r\nto endeavor to fit themselves for moral and material advancement in the\r\npresent, they would abandon all effort at progress and begin factional\r\nintrigues for future power.\r\n\r\nTo promise to give them independence when it is “prudent” to do so, or\r\nwhen they are “fit” for it, of course implies that they are not fit\r\nfor it now, and that it would be imprudent to give it to them now. But\r\nas we must ourselves be the judges as to when they become “fit,” and\r\nwhen it would be “prudent” to keep such a promise if it were made, it\r\nnecessarily follows that to make such a promise now would amount to a\r\ndeception upon the Filipinos.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt may well be that our opponents have no real intention of putting\r\ntheir promise into effect. If this is the case, if, in other words,\r\nthey are insincere in the promise they make, it is only necessary to\r\nsay again that it is unwise to trust men who are false in one thing to\r\ndeal with anything. The mere consciousness of broken faith would hamper\r\nthem in continuing our policy in the islands; and only by continuing\r\nunchanged this policy can the honor of the country be maintained, or\r\nthe interests of the islands subserved. If, on the other hand, our\r\nopponents came into power and attempted to carry out their promises to\r\nthe Filipinos by giving them independence, and withdrawing American\r\ncontrol from the islands, the result would be a frightful calamity to\r\nthe Filipinos themselves, and in its larger aspect would amount to\r\nan international crime. Anarchy would follow; and the most violent\r\nanarchic forces would be directed partly against the civil government,\r\npartly against all forms of religious and educational civilization.\r\nBloody conflicts would inevitably ensue in the archipelago, and just as\r\ninevitably the islands would become the prey of the first Power which\r\nin its own selfish interest took up the task we had cravenly abandoned.\r\nOf course, the practical difficulty in adopting any such course of\r\naction—such a “policy of scuttle,” as President McKinley called\r\nit—would be found wellnigh insuperable. If it is morally indefensible\r\nto hold the archipelago as a whole under our tutelage in the interest\r\nof its own people, then it is morally indefensible to hold any part of\r\nit. In such case, what right have we to keep a coaling station? What\r\nright to keep control over the Moro peoples? What right to protect the\r\nIgorrotes from their oppressors? What right to protect the law-abiding\r\nfriends of America in the islands from treachery, robbery, and murder?\r\nYet, to abandon the islands completely, without even retaining a\r\ncoaling station, would mean to abandon the position in the competition\r\nfor the trade of the Orient which we have acquired during the last\r\nsix years; and what is far more important, it would mean irreparable\r\ndamage to those who have become the wards of the Nation. To abandon\r\nall control over the Moros would amount to releasing these Moros to\r\nprey upon the Christian Filipinos, civilized or semi-civilized, as well\r\nas upon the commerce of other peoples. The Moros are in large part\r\nstill in the stage of culture where the occupations of the bandit and\r\nthe pirate are those most highly regarded; and it has not been found\r\npractical to give them self-government in the sense that we have been\r\ngiving it to the Christian inhabitants. To abandon the Moro country\r\nas our opponents propose in their platform, would be precisely as if\r\ntwenty-five years ago we had withdrawn the Army and the civil agents\r\nfrom within and around the Indian reservations in the West, at a time\r\nwhen the Sioux and the Apache were still the terror of our settlers.\r\nIt would be a criminal absurdity; and yet our opponents have pledged\r\nthemselves thereto. If successful in the coming election they would\r\neither have to break faith, or else to do an act which would leave\r\nan indelible stain upon our national reputation for courage, and for\r\ngood sense. During the last five years more has been done for the\r\nmaterial and moral well-being of the Filipinos than ever before since\r\nthe islands first came within the ken of civilized man. We have opened\r\nbefore them a vista of orderly development in their own interest, and\r\nnot a policy of exploitation. Every effort is being made to fit the\r\nislanders for self-government, and they have already in large measure\r\nreceived it, while for the first time in their history their personal\r\nrights and civil liberties have been guaranteed. They are being\r\neducated; they have been given schools; they have been given libraries;\r\nroads are being built for their use; their health is being cared for;\r\nthey have been given courts in which they receive justice as absolute\r\nas it is in our power to guarantee. Their individual rights to life,\r\nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness are now by act of Congress\r\njealously safeguarded under the American flag; and if the protection\r\nof the flag were withdrawn their rights would be lost, and the islands\r\nwould be plunged back under some form of vicious tyranny. We have given\r\nthem more self-government than they have ever before had; we are taking\r\nsteps to increase it still further by providing them with an elected\r\nlegislative assembly; and surely we had better await the results of\r\nthis experiment—for it is a wholly new experiment in Asia—before we\r\nmake promises which as a Nation we might be forced to break, or which\r\nthey might interpret one way and we another. It may be asserted without\r\nfear of successful contradiction that nowhere else in recent years has\r\nthere been as fine an example of constructive statesmanship and wise\r\nand upright Administration as has been given by the civil authorities,\r\naided by the Army, in the Philippine Islands. We have administered them\r\nin the interest of their own people; and the Filipinos themselves have\r\nprofited most by our presence in the islands; but they have also been\r\nof very great advantage to us as a nation.\r\n\r\nSo far from having “sapped the foundations” of free popular government\r\nat home by the course taken in the Philippines, we have been spreading\r\nits knowledge, and teaching its practice, among peoples to whom it\r\nhad never before been more than an empty name. Our action represents\r\na great stride forward in spreading the principles of orderly liberty\r\nthroughout the world. “Our flag has not lost its gift of benediction\r\nin its world-wide journey to their shores.” We have treated the power\r\nwe have gained as a solemn obligation, and have used it in the interest\r\nof mankind; and the peoples of the world, and especially the weaker\r\npeoples of the world, are better off because of the position we have\r\nassumed. To retrace our steps would be to give proof of an infirm and\r\nunstable national purpose.\r\n\r\nFour years ago, in his speech of acceptance, President McKinley said:\r\n\r\n“We have been moving in untried paths, but our steps have been guided\r\nby honor and duty. There will be no turning aside, no wavering, no\r\nretreat. No blow has been struck except for liberty and humanity,\r\nand none will be. We will perform without fear every national and\r\ninternational obligation. The Republican party was dedicated to freedom\r\nforty-four years ago. It has been the party of liberty and emancipation\r\nfrom that hour; not of profession, but of performance. It broke the\r\nshackles of four million slaves, and made them free, and to the party\r\nof Lincoln has come another supreme opportunity which it has bravely\r\nmet in the liberation of ten millions of the human family from the yoke\r\nof imperialism. In its solution of great problems, in its performance\r\nof high duties, it has had the support of members of all parties in the\r\npast, and it confidently invokes their co-operation in the future.”\r\n\r\nThis is as true now as four years ago. We did not take the Philippines\r\nat will, and we can not put them aside at will. Any abandonment of the\r\npolicy which we have steadily pursued in the islands would be fraught\r\nwith dishonor and disaster; and to such dishonor and disaster I do not\r\nbelieve that the American people will consent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlarm has been professed lest the Filipinos should not receive all the\r\nbenefits guaranteed to our people at home by the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution. As a matter of fact, the Filipinos have already\r\nsecured the substance of these benefits. This Government has been true\r\nto the spirit of the Fourteenth Amendment in the Philippines. Can our\r\nopponents deny that here at home the principles of the Fourteenth and\r\nFifteenth Amendments have been in effect nullified? In this, as in\r\nmany other matters, we at home can well profit by the example of those\r\nresponsible for the actual management of affairs in the Philippines. In\r\nour several commonwealths here in the United States we, as a people,\r\nnow face the complex problem of securing fair treatment to each man\r\nregardless of his race or color. We can do so only if we approach\r\nthe problem in the spirit of courage, common-sense, and high-minded\r\ndevotion to the right, which has enabled Governor Taft, Governor\r\nWright, and their associates, to do so noble a work in giving to the\r\nPhilippine people the benefit of the true principles of American\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur appeal is made to all good citizens who hold the honor and the\r\ninterest of the Nation close to their hearts. The great issues\r\nwhich are at stake, and upon which I have touched, are more than\r\nmere partisan issues, for they involve much that comes home to the\r\nindividual pride and individual well-being of our people. Under\r\nconditions as they actually are, good Americans should refuse, for\r\nthe sake of the welfare of the Nation, to change the national policy.\r\nWe, who are responsible for the administration and legislation under\r\nwhich this country, during the last seven years, has grown so greatly\r\nin well-being at home and in honorable repute among the nations of the\r\nearth abroad, do not stand inertly upon this record, do not use this\r\nrecord as an excuse for failure of effort to meet new conditions. On\r\nthe contrary, we treat the record of what we have done in the past\r\nas incitement to do even better in the future. We believe that the\r\nprogress that we have made may be taken as a measure of the progress\r\nwe shall continue to make if the people again intrust the Government\r\nof the Nation to our hands. We do not stand still. We press steadily\r\nforward toward the goal of moral and material well-being for our own\r\npeople, of just and fearless dealing toward all other peoples, in the\r\ninterest not merely of this country, but of mankind. There is not a\r\npolicy, foreign or domestic, which we are now carrying out, which it\r\nwould not be disastrous to reverse or abandon. If our opponents should\r\ncome in and should not reverse our policies, then they would be branded\r\nwith the brand of broken faith, of false promise, of insincerity in\r\nword and deed; and no man can work to the advantage of the Nation with\r\nsuch a brand clinging to him. If, on the other hand, they should come\r\nin and reverse any or all of our policies, by just so much would the\r\nNation as a whole be damaged. Alike as lawmakers and as administrators\r\nof the law we have endeavored to do our duty in the interest of the\r\npeople as a whole. We make our appeal to no class and to no section,\r\nbut to all good citizens, in whatever part of the land they dwell, and\r\nwhatever may be their occupation or worldly condition. We have striven\r\nboth for civic righteousness and for national greatness; and we have\r\nfaith to believe that our hands will be upheld by all who feel love of\r\ncountry and trust in the uplifting of mankind. We stand for enforcement\r\nof the law and for obedience to the law; our Government is a government\r\nof orderly liberty equally alien to tyranny and to anarchy; and its\r\nfoundation-stone is the observance of the law, alike by the people and\r\nby the public servants. We hold ever before us as the all-important end\r\nof policy and administration the reign of peace at home and throughout\r\nthe world; of peace, which comes only by doing justice.\r\n\r\n                                                       Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT THE WHITE HOUSE, SEPT. 24, 1904, ON THE OCCASION OF THE\r\nRECEPTION OF THE INTERPARLIAMENTARY UNION\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Interparliamentary Union_:\r\n\r\nI greet you with profound pleasure as representatives in a special\r\nsense of the great international movement for peace and goodwill\r\namong the nations of the earth. It is a matter of gratification to\r\nall Americans that we have had the honor of receiving you here as\r\nthe Nation’s guests. You are men skilled in the practical work of\r\ngovernment in your several countries; and this fact adds weight to\r\nyour championship of the cause of international justice. I thank you\r\nfor your kind allusions to what the Government of the United States\r\nhas accomplished for the policies you have at heart, and I assure you\r\nthat this Government’s attitude will continue unchanged in reference\r\nthereto. We are even now taking steps to secure arbitration treaties\r\nwith all other Governments which are willing to enter into them with us.\r\n\r\nIn response to your resolutions I shall at an early date ask the\r\nother nations to join in a second Congress at The Hague. I feel, as\r\nI am sure you do, that our efforts should take the shape of pushing\r\nforward toward completion the work already begun at The Hague, and\r\nthat whatever is now done should appear not as something divergent\r\ntherefrom, but as a continuance thereof. At the first conference at\r\nThe Hague several questions were left unsettled, and it was expressly\r\nprovided that there should be a second conference. A reasonable time\r\nhas elapsed, and I feel that your body has shown sound judgment in\r\nconcluding that a second conference should now be called to carry some\r\nsteps further toward completion the work of the first. It would be\r\nvisionary to expect too immediate success for the great cause you are\r\nchampioning; but very substantial progress can be made if we strive\r\nwith resolution and good sense toward the goal of securing among the\r\nnations of the earth, as among the individuals of each nation, a just\r\nsense of responsibility in each toward others, and a just recognition\r\nin each of the rights of others. The right and the responsibility must\r\ngo hand in hand. Our effort must be unceasing both to secure in each\r\nnation full acknowledgment of the rights of others, and to bring about\r\nin each nation an ever growing sense of its own responsibilities.\r\n\r\nAt an early date I shall issue the call for the conference you request.\r\n\r\nI again greet you and bid you welcome in the name of the American\r\npeople, and wish you Godspeed in your efforts for the common good of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n                                                      _November 4, 1904_\r\n\r\n\r\nCertain slanderous accusations as to Mr. Cortelyou and myself have\r\nbeen repeated time and again by Judge Parker, the candidate of his\r\nparty for the office of President. He neither has produced nor can\r\nproduce any proof of their truth; yet he has not withdrawn them;\r\nand as his position gives them wide currency, I speak now lest the\r\nsilence of self-respect be misunderstood. Mr. Parker’s charges are\r\nin effect that the President of the United States and Mr. Cortelyou,\r\nformerly Mr. Cleveland’s executive clerk, then Mr. McKinley’s and my\r\nsecretary, then Secretary of Commerce and Labor, and now Chairman\r\nof the Republican National Committee, have been in a conspiracy to\r\nblackmail corporations, Mr. Cortelyou using his knowledge gained while\r\nhe was Secretary of the Department of Commerce and Labor to extort\r\nmoney from the corporations, and I, the President, having appointed\r\nhim for this especial purpose. The gravamen of these charges lies\r\nin the assertion that the corporations have been blackmailed into\r\ncontributing, and in the implication, which in one or two of Mr.\r\nParker’s speeches has taken the form practically of an assertion, that\r\nthey have been promised certain immunities or favors, or have been\r\nassured that they would receive some kind of improper consideration\r\nin view of their contributions. That contributions have been made to\r\nthe Republican Committee, as contributions have been made to the\r\nDemocratic Committee, is not the question at issue. Mr. Parker’s\r\nassertion is in effect that such contributions have been made for\r\nimproper motives, either in consequence of threats or in consequence of\r\nimproper promises, direct or indirect, on the part of the recipients.\r\nMr. Parker knows best whether this is true of the contributions to his\r\ncampaign fund which have come through his trusted friends and advisers\r\nwho represent the great corporate interests that stand behind him.\r\nBut there is not one particle of truth in the statement as regards\r\nanything that has gone on in the management of the Republican campaign.\r\nMr. Parker’s accusations against Mr. Cortelyou and me are monstrous.\r\nIf true they would brand both of us forever with infamy; and inasmuch\r\nas they are false, heavy must be the condemnation of the man making\r\nthem. I chose Mr. Cortelyou as Chairman of the National Committee\r\nafter having failed successively to persuade Mr. Elihu Root, Mr. W.\r\nMurray Crane, and Mr. Cornelius N. Bliss to accept the position. I\r\nchose him with extreme reluctance, because I could ill spare him from\r\nthe Cabinet. But I felt that he possessed the high integrity which I\r\ndemanded in the man who was to manage my campaign. I am content that\r\nMr. Parker and I should be judged by the public on the characters of\r\nthe two men whom we chose to manage our campaigns; he by the character\r\nof his nominee, Mr. Thomas Taggart, and I by the character of Mr.\r\nCortelyou. The assertion that Mr. Cortelyou had any knowledge, gained\r\nwhile in an official position, whereby he was enabled to secure and\r\ndid secure any contributions from any corporation is a falsehood.\r\nThe assertion that there has been any blackmail, direct or indirect,\r\nby Mr. Cortelyou or by me is a falsehood. The assertion that there\r\nhas been made in my behalf and by my authority, by Mr. Cortelyou or\r\nby any one else, any pledge or promise, or that there has been any\r\nunderstanding as to future immunities or benefits, in recognition of\r\nany contributions from any source, is a wicked falsehood.\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Parker should desire to avoid the discussion of principles I\r\ncan well understand; for it is but the bare truth to say that he has\r\nnot attacked us on any matter of principle or upon any action of the\r\nGovernment save after first misstating that principle or that action.\r\nBut I can not understand how any honorable man, a candidate for the\r\nhighest office in the gift of the people, can take refuge not merely in\r\npersonalities, but in such base and unworthy personalities. If I deemed\r\nit necessary to support my flat denial by any evidence, I would ask all\r\nmen of common-sense to ponder well what has been done in this campaign\r\nby Mr. Cortelyou, and to compare it with what Mr. Parker himself did\r\nwhen he was managing Mr. Hill’s campaign for Governor; and to compare\r\nwhat has been done as regards the great corporations and moneyed\r\ninterests under this Administration with what was done under the last\r\nDemocratic Administration while Mr. Olney was Attorney-General; I\r\nwould ask all honest men whether they seriously deem it possible that\r\nthe course this Administration has taken in every matter, from the\r\nNorthern Securities suit to the settlement of the anthracite coal\r\nstrike, is compatible with any theory of public behavior save the\r\ntheory of doing exact justice to all men without fear and without\r\nfavoritism; I would ask all honest and fair-minded men to remember that\r\nthe agents through whom I have worked are Mr. Knox and Mr. Moody in the\r\nDepartment of Justice, Mr. Cortelyou in the Department of Commerce and\r\nLabor, and Mr. Garfield in the Bureau of Corporations, and that no such\r\nact of infamy as Mr. Parker charges could have been done without all\r\nthese men being parties to it.\r\n\r\nThe statements made by Mr. Parker are unqualifiedly and atrociously\r\nfalse. As Mr. Cortelyou has said to me more than once during the\r\ncampaign, if elected I shall go into the Presidency unhampered by any\r\npledge, promise, or understanding of any kind, sort or description,\r\nsave my promise, made openly to the American people, that so far as in\r\nmy power lies I shall see to it that every man has a square deal, no\r\nless and no more.\r\n\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE UNVEILING OF THE STATUE OF FREDERICK THE GREAT, AT\r\nWASHINGTON, NOV. 19, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ambassador_:\r\n\r\nThrough you I wish on behalf of the people of the United States to\r\nthank his Majesty, the German Emperor, and the people of Germany for\r\nthe gift to the Nation which you have just formally delivered to\r\nme. I accept it with deep appreciation of the friendly regard which\r\nit typifies for the people of this Republic both on the part of the\r\nEmperor and on the part of the German people. I accept it not merely as\r\nthe statue of one of the half-dozen greatest soldiers of all time, and\r\ntherefore peculiarly appropriate for placing in this War College, but I\r\naccept it as the statue of a great man, whose life was devoted to the\r\nservice of a great people, and whose deeds hastened the approach of the\r\nday when a united Germany should spring into being.\r\n\r\nAs a soldier Frederick the Great ranks in that very, very small\r\ngroup which includes Alexander, Cæsar, and Hannibal in antiquity,\r\nand Napoleon, and possibly Gustavus Adolphus, in modern times. He\r\nbelonged to the ancient and illustrious house of Hohenzollern, which,\r\nafter playing a strong and virile part in the Middle Ages, and after\r\nproducing some men, like the great Elector, who were among the most\r\nfamous princes of their time, founded the royal house of Prussia two\r\ncenturies ago, and at last in our own day established the mighty\r\nGerman Empire as among the foremost of world powers. We receive this\r\ngift now at the hands of the present Emperor, himself a man who has\r\nmarkedly added to the lustre of his great house and his great nation,\r\na man who has devoted his life to the welfare of his people, and who,\r\nwhile keeping ever ready to defend the rights of that people, has also\r\nmade it evident in emphatic fashion that he and they desire peace and\r\nfriendship with the other nations of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt is not my purpose here to discuss at length the career of the\r\nmighty King and mighty General whose statue we have just received.\r\nIn all history no other great commander save only Hannibal fought so\r\nlong against such terrible odds, and while Hannibal finally failed,\r\nFrederick finally triumphed. In almost every battle he fought against\r\ngreat odds, and he almost always won the victory. When defeated he\r\nrose to an even greater altitude than when victorious. The memory of\r\nthe Seven Years’ War will last as long as there lives in mankind the\r\nlove of heroism, and its operations will be studied to the minutest\r\ndetail as long as the world sees a soldier worthy of the name. It is\r\ndifficult to know whether to admire most the victories of Leuthen\r\nand Prague, Rossbach and Zorndorf, or the heartbreaking campaigns\r\nafter Kunersdorf, when the great King, after having been beaten to\r\nthe ground by the banded might of Europe, yet rose again and by an\r\nexhibition of skill, tenacity, energy, and daring such as had never\r\nbefore been seen united in one person, finally wrested triumph from\r\ndefeat. Not only must the military scholar always turn to the career of\r\nFrederick the Great for lessons in strategy and tactics; not only must\r\nthe military administrator always turn to his career for lessons in\r\norganizing success; not only will the lover of heroism read the tales\r\nof his mighty feats as long as mankind cares for heroic deeds; but even\r\nthose who are not attracted by the valor of the soldier must yet, for\r\nthe sake of the greatness of the man, ponder and admire the lessons\r\ntaught by his undaunted resolution, his inflexible tenacity of purpose,\r\nhis farsighted grasp of lofty possibilities, and his unflinching,\r\nunyielding determination in following the path he had marked out.\r\nIt is eminently fitting that the statue of this iron soldier, this\r\nborn leader of men, should find a place in this War College; for when\r\nsoldierly genius and soldierly heroism reach the highest point of\r\nachievement the man in whom they are displayed grows to belong not\r\nmerely to the nation from which he sprang, but to all nations capable\r\nof showing, and therefore capable of appreciating, the virile and\r\nmasterful virtues which alone make victors in those dread struggles\r\nwhere resort is at last had to the arbitrament of arms.\r\n\r\nBut, Mr. Ambassador, in accepting the statue given us to-day through\r\nyou from the German Emperor, I accept it not merely because it is the\r\nstatue of a mighty and terrible soldier, but I accept it as a symbol\r\nof the ties of friendship and goodwill which I trust as the years go\r\non will bind ever closer together the American and the German peoples.\r\nThere is kinship of blood between the two nations. We of the United\r\nStates are of mixed stock. In our veins runs the blood of almost all\r\nthe peoples of middle, northern, and western Europe. We already have\r\na history of which we feel that we have the right to be legitimately\r\nproud, and yet our nationality is still in the formative period. Nearly\r\nthree centuries have elapsed since the landing of the English at\r\nJamestown marked the beginning of what has since grown into the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nDuring these three centuries streams of newcomers from many different\r\ncountries abroad have in each generation contributed to swell the\r\nincrease of our people. Soon after the English settled in Virginia and\r\nNew England, the Hollander settled at the mouth of the Hudson and the\r\nSwede at the mouth of the Delaware. Even in Colonial days the German\r\nelement had become very strong among our people in various parts of\r\nthis country; the Irish element was predominant in the foothills of\r\nthe Alleghenies; French Huguenots were numerous. By the time of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence that process of fusion which has gone on\r\never since was well under way. From the beginning of our national\r\nhistory men of German origin or German parentage played a distinguished\r\npart in the affairs both of peace and of war. In the Revolutionary War\r\none of the leading generals was Muhlenberg, an American of German\r\ndescent, just as among the soldiers from abroad who came to aid us one\r\nof the most prominent was the German, Steuben. Muhlenberg was the first\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives; and the battle which in the\r\nRevolution saved the valley of the Mohawk to the American cause was\r\nfought under the lead of the German, Herkimer. As all the different\r\nraces here tend rapidly to fuse together, it is rarely possible after\r\none or two generations to draw a sharp line between the various\r\nelements; but there is no student of our national conditions who has\r\nfailed to appreciate what an invaluable element in our composite stock\r\nthe German is. Here, on this platform, Mr. Ambassador, among those\r\npresent to-day are many men partly or wholly of German blood, and\r\namong the officers of the Army and Navy who have listened to you and\r\nwho now join with me in greeting you there are many whose fathers or\r\ngrandfathers were born in Germany, and not a few who themselves first\r\nsaw the light there.\r\n\r\nEach nation has its allotted tasks to do; each nation has its peculiar\r\ndifficulties to encounter; and as the peoples of the world tend to\r\nbecome more closely knit together alike for good and for evil, it\r\nbecomes ever more important to all that each should prosper; for\r\nthe prosperity of one is normally not a sign of menace but a sign\r\nof hope for the rest. Here on this Continent where it is absolutely\r\nessential that the different peoples coming to our shores should\r\nnot remain separate, but should fuse into one, our unceasing effort\r\nis to strive to keep and profit by the good that each race brings\r\nto our shores, and at the same time to do away with all racial and\r\nreligious animosities among the various stocks. In both efforts we\r\nhave met with an astonishing measure of success. As the years go by\r\nit becomes not harder but easier to live in peace and goodwill among\r\nourselves; and I firmly believe that it will also become not harder\r\nbut easier to dwell in peace and friendship with the other nations\r\nof the earth. A young people, a people of composite stock, we have\r\nkinship with many different nations, but we are identical with none of\r\nthem, and are developing a separate national stock as we have already\r\ndeveloped a separate national life. We have in our veins the blood of\r\nthe Englishman, the Irishman, and the Welshman, the German and the\r\nFrenchman, the Scotchman, the Dutchman, the Scandinavian, the Italian,\r\nthe Magyar, the Finn, the Slav, so that to each of the great powers of\r\nthe Old World we can claim a more or less distant kinship by blood; and\r\nto each strain of blood we owe some peculiar quality in our national\r\nlife or national character. As such is the case it is natural that we\r\nshould have a peculiar feeling of nearness to each of many peoples\r\nacross the water. We most earnestly wish not only to keep unbroken our\r\nfriendship for each, but so far as we can without giving offence by an\r\nappearance of meddling, to seek to bring about a better understanding\r\nand a broader spirit of fair dealing and toleration among all nations.\r\nIt has been my great pleasure, Mr. Ambassador, in pursuance of this\r\nobject, recently to take with you the first steps in the negotiation of\r\na treaty of friendly arbitration between Germany and the United States.\r\n\r\nIn closing, let me thank you, and through you the German Emperor and\r\nthe German people, for this statue, which I accept in the name of the\r\nAmerican people; a people claiming blood kinship with your own; a\r\npeople owing much to Germany; a people which, though with a national\r\nhistory far shorter than that of your people, nevertheless, like your\r\npeople, is proud of the great deeds of its past, and is confident in\r\nthe majesty of its future. I most earnestly pray that in the coming\r\nyears these two great nations shall move on toward their several\r\ndestinies knit together by ties of the heartiest friendship and\r\ngoodwill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS AT ST. PATRICK’S CHURCH, WASHINGTON, D. C., NOV. 20, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Cardinal Gibbons, Father Stafford, and you, my Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nIt is a great pleasure to me to be present with you to-day to assist\r\nat the dedication of the school, hall, and rectory of this Parish, a\r\nParish whose one hundred and tenth anniversary we also now celebrate;\r\nfor this Parish was founded six years before the national capital was\r\nplaced in the present District of Columbia. I am glad indeed to have\r\nbeen introduced, Cardinal Gibbons, by you, the spiritual representative\r\nin a peculiar sense of that Bishop Carroll who played so illustrious\r\na part in the affairs of the Church, and whose kinsfolk played as\r\nillustrious a part in the affairs of the Nation at the dawning of this\r\nGovernment. In greeting all of you I wish to say that I am especially\r\nglad to see the children present. You know I believe in children. I\r\nwant to see enough of them and of the right kind.\r\n\r\nI wish to-day, in the very brief remarks that I have to make, to\r\ndwell upon this thought—the thought that ought to be in the mind of\r\nevery man and woman here, the thought that while in this country we\r\nneed wise laws honestly and fearlessly executed, and while we can not\r\nafford to tolerate anything but the highest standard in the public\r\nservice of the Government, yet that in the last analysis the future of\r\nthe country must depend upon the quality of the individual home, of\r\nthe individual man or woman in that home. The future of this country\r\ndepends upon the way in which the average man and the average woman in\r\nit does his or her duty, and that very largely depends upon the way\r\nin which the average boy or girl is brought up. Therefore, a peculiar\r\nresponsibility rests upon those whose lifework it is to see to the\r\nspiritual welfare of our people and upon those who make it their\r\nlifework to try to train the citizens of the future so that they shall\r\nbe worthy of that future. In wishing you well to-day, I wish you well\r\nin doing the most important work which is allotted to any of our people\r\nto do. The rules of good citizenship are tolerably simple. The trouble\r\nis not in finding them out; the trouble is in living up to them after\r\nthey have been found out. I think we all of us know fairly well what\r\nqualities they are which in their sum make up the type of character\r\nwe like to see in man or wife, son or daughter; but I am afraid we do\r\nnot always see them as well developed as we would like to. I wish to\r\nsee in the average American citizen the development of the two sets of\r\nqualities which we can roughly indicate as sweetness and strength—the\r\nqualities on the one hand which make the man able to hold his own,\r\nand those which on the other hand make him jealous for the rights of\r\nothers just as much as for his own rights. We must have both sets of\r\nqualities. In the first place, the man must have the power to hold his\r\nown. You probably know that I do not care very much for the coward\r\nor the moral weakling. I want each of you boys, and the girls just as\r\nmuch, and each of you young men and young women, to have the qualities\r\nwithout which people may be amiable and pleasant while things go well,\r\nbut without which they can not succeed in times of stern trial. I wish\r\nto see in the man manliness, in the woman womanliness. I wish to see\r\ncourage, perseverance, the willingness to face work, to face, you men,\r\nif it is necessary, danger, the determination not to shrink back when\r\ntemporarily beaten in life, as each one will be now and then, but to\r\ncome up again and wrest triumph from defeat. I want to see you men\r\nstrong men and brave men, and in addition I wish to see each man of you\r\nfeel that his strength and his courage but make him the worse unless to\r\nthat strength and courage are joined the qualities of tenderness toward\r\nthose he loves, who are dependent upon him, and of right dealing with\r\nall his neighbors.\r\n\r\nFinally, I want to congratulate all of us here on certain successes\r\nthat we have achieved in the century and a quarter that has gone by\r\nof our American life. We have difficulties enough, and we are a long\r\nways short of perfection. I do not see any immediate danger of our\r\ngrowing too good; there is ample room for effort yet left. But we have\r\nachieved certain results, we have succeeded in measurably realizing\r\ncertain ideals. We have grown to accept it as an axiomatic truth of\r\nour American life that the man is to be treated on his worth as a\r\nman, without regard to the accidents of his position; that this is not\r\na Government designed to favor the rich man as such, or the poor man\r\nas such, but that it is designed to favor every man, rich or poor, if\r\nhe is a decent man who acts fairly by his fellows. We have grown to\r\nrealize that part of the foundations upon which our liberty rests is\r\nthe right of each man to worship his Creator according to the dictates\r\nof his conscience, and the duty of each man to respect his fellow who\r\nso worships Him. And, oh! my countrymen, one of the best auguries for\r\nthe future of this country, for the future of this mighty and majestic\r\nNation of ours, lies in the fact that we have grown to regard one\r\nanother, that we brothers have grown to regard one another, with a\r\nbroad and kindly charity, and to realize the field for human endeavor\r\nis wide, that the field for charitable, philanthropic, religious\r\nwork is wide, and that while a corner of it remains untilled we do a\r\ndreadful wrong if we fail to welcome the work done in that field by\r\nevery man, no matter what his creed, provided only he works with a\r\nlofty sense of his duty to God and his duty to his neighbor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS INTRODUCING REV. CHARLES WAGNER, AT THE LAFAYETTE OPERA HOUSE,\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., NOV. 22, 1904\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Macfarland, Mr. Wagner, Men and Women of Washington_:\r\n\r\nThis is the first and will be the only time during my Presidency that\r\nI shall ever introduce a speaker to an audience; and I am more than\r\nglad to do it in this instance, because if there is one book which I\r\nshould like to have read as a tract, and also, what is not invariably\r\ntrue of tracts, as an interesting tract, by all our people, it is “The\r\nSimple Life,” written by Mr. Wagner. There are other books which he\r\nhas written from which we can gain great good, but I know of no other\r\nbook written of recent years anywhere, here or abroad, which contains\r\nso much that we of America ought to take to our hearts as is contained\r\nin “The Simple Life.” I like the book because it does not merely preach\r\nto the rich, and does not merely preach to the poor. It is a very easy\r\nthing to address a section of the community in reprobation of the forms\r\nof vice to which it is not prone. What we need to have impressed upon\r\nus is that it is not usually the root principle of the vice that varies\r\nwith variation in social conditions, but that it is the manifestation\r\nof the vice that varies; and Mr. Wagner has well brought out the great\r\nfundamental truth that the brutal arrogance of a rich man who looks\r\ndown upon a poor man because he is poor, and the brutal envy and\r\nhatred felt by a poor man toward a rich man merely because he is rich,\r\nare at bottom twin manifestations of the same vice. They are simply\r\ndifferent sides of the same shield. The arrogance that looks down in\r\nthe one case, the envy that hates in the other, are really exhibitions\r\nof the same mean, base, and unlovely spirit which happens in one case\r\nto be in different surroundings from what it is in the other case. The\r\nkind of man who would be arrogant in one case is precisely the kind\r\nof man who would be envious and filled with hatred in the other. The\r\nideal should be the just, the generous, the broad-minded man who is as\r\nincapable of arrogance if rich as he is of malignant envy and hatred if\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nNo republic can permanently exist when it becomes a republic of\r\nclasses, where the man feels not the interest of the whole people, but\r\nthe interest of the particular class to which he belongs, or fancies\r\nthat he belongs, as being of prime importance. In antiquity, republics\r\nfailed as they did because they tended to become either a republic of\r\nthe few who exploited the many, or a republic of the many who plundered\r\nthe few, and in either case the end of the republic was inevitable;\r\njust as much so in one case as in the other, and no more so in one case\r\nthan in the other. We can keep this Republic true to the principles of\r\nthose who founded, and of those who afterward preserved it, we can keep\r\nit a Republic at all, only by remembering that we must live up to the\r\ntheory of its founders, to the theory, of treating each man on his\r\nworth as a man; neither holding it for nor against him that he occupies\r\nany particular station in life, so long as he does his duty fairly and\r\nwell by his fellows and by the Nation as a whole.\r\n\r\nSo much for the general philosophy taught so admirably in Mr.\r\nWagner’s book—I might say books, but I am thinking especially of “The\r\nSimple Life,” because that has been the book that has appealed to me\r\nparticularly. Now, a word with special reference to his address to\r\nthis audience, to the Young Men’s Christian Association: The profound\r\nregard which I have always felt for those responsible for the work of\r\nthe Young Men’s Christian Association and the Young Women’s Christian\r\nAssociation, is largely because they have practically realized, or at\r\nleast have striven practically to realize, the ideal of adherence to\r\nthe text which reads, “Be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only.”\r\nIf you here to-day came here only with the idea of passing a pleasant\r\nafternoon and then go home and do not actually practice somewhat of\r\nwhat Mr. Wagner preaches and practices, then small will be the use of\r\nyour coming. It is not of the slightest use to hear the word if you\r\ndo not try to put it into effect afterward. The Young Men’s Christian\r\nAssociations have accomplished so much because those who have managed\r\nthem have tried practically to do their part in bringing about what is\r\nexpressed in the phrase “the fatherhood of God, and the brotherhood\r\nof men.” We can act individually or we can act by associations. I\r\nintend this afternoon to illustrate by a couple of examples what I\r\nmean by a man acting individually, and what I mean by a man acting in\r\nassociations with his fellows. I hesitated whether I would use, as I\r\nshall use, the names of the people whom I meant, but I came to the\r\nconclusion that I would, because the worth of an example consists very\r\nlargely in the knowledge that the example is a real one.\r\n\r\nI have been immensely interested for a number of years in the working\r\nof the Civic Club in New York, which has been started and superintended\r\nby Mr. Norton Goddard. It is a club on the East Side of New York City,\r\nthe range of whose membership includes a big district of the city,\r\nextending from about Lexington Avenue to the East River. Mr. Goddard\r\nrealized that such work can be done to best advantage only upon\r\ncondition of there being genuine and hearty sympathy among those doing\r\nit. There are a great many people so made in this world (I think most\r\nof us come under the category) that they would resent being patronized\r\nabout as much as being wronged. Great good can never be done if it\r\nis attempted in a patronizing spirit. Mr. Goddard realized that the\r\nwork could be done efficiently only on condition of getting into close\r\nand hearty touch with the people through whom and with whom he was to\r\nwork. In consequence, this Civic Club was founded, and it has gradually\r\nextended its operations until now the entire club membership of three\r\nor four thousand men practically form a committee of betterment in\r\nsocial and civic life; a committee spread throughout that district,\r\neach member keeping a sharp lookout over the fortunes of all his\r\nimmediate neighbors, of all of those of his neighborhood who do not\r\ncome within the ken of some other member of the club. Therefore, any\r\ncase of great destitution, of great suffering, in the district, almost\r\ninevitably comes to the attention of some member of the club, who then\r\nreports it at headquarters, so that steps can be taken to alleviate the\r\nmisery; and I have reason to believe that there has been in consequence\r\na very sensible general uplifting, a general increase of happiness,\r\nthroughout the district. If we had a sufficient number of clubs of this\r\nkind throughout our great cities, while we would not by any means have\r\nsolved all of the terrible problems that press upon us for solution\r\nin connection with municipal misgovernment and with the overcrowding,\r\nmisery, vice, disease, and poverty of great cities, yet we would\r\nhave taken a long stride forward in the right direction toward their\r\nsolution. So much for the example that I use to illustrate what I mean\r\nby work in combination.\r\n\r\nAs an example of what can be done, and should be done, by the\r\nindividual citizen, I shall mention something that recently occurred\r\nin this city of Washington, a thing that doubtless many of you know\r\nabout, but which was unknown to me until recently. A few weeks ago\r\nwhen I was walking back from church one Sunday I noticed a great fire\r\nand found that it was Downey’s livery stable—you recollect it, three\r\nor four weeks ago when the livery stable burned. Through a train of\r\ncircumstances that I need not mention, my attention was particularly\r\ncalled to the case, and I looked into it. I had long known of the very\r\nadmirable work done with singular modesty and self-effacement by Mr.\r\nDowney in trying to give homes to the homeless, and to be himself a\r\nfriend of those in a peculiar sense friendless in this community; and\r\nI now by accident found out what had happened in connection with this\r\nparticular incident. It appears that last spring Mr. Downey started\r\nto build a new livery stable; his stable is next door to a colored\r\nBaptist church. Mr. Downey is a white man and a Catholic and these\r\nneighbors of his are colored men and Baptists, and their kinship was\r\nsimply the kinship of that broad humanity that should underlie all our\r\nfeelings toward one another. Mr. Downey started to build his stable,\r\nand naturally wanted to have it as big a stable as possible and build\r\nit right up to the limits of his land. That brought the wall close up\r\nagainst the back of the colored Baptists’ church, cutting out the light\r\nand air. The preacher called upon him and told him that they would like\r\nto purchase a strip six feet broad of the ground of Mr. Downey, upon\r\nwhich he was intending to build, as it would be a great inconvenience\r\nto them to lose the light and the air; that they were aware that it\r\nwas asking a good deal of him to cramp the building out of which he\r\nintended to make his livelihood, but that they hoped he would do it\r\nbecause of their need. After a good deal of thought, Mr. Downey\r\ncame to the conclusion that he ought to grant the request, and so he\r\nnotified them that he would change his plans, make a somewhat smaller\r\nbuilding, and sell them the six feet of land in the strip adjoining\r\ntheir church. After a little while the preacher came around with the\r\ntrustees of his church and said that they very much appreciated Mr.\r\nDowney’s courtesy, and were sorry they had bothered him as they had,\r\nbecause, on looking into the affairs of the church, they found that\r\nas they were already in debt they did not feel warranted in incurring\r\nany further financial obligations, and so they had to withdraw their\r\nrequest. They thanked him for his kindly purpose, and said good-by. But\r\nMr. Downey found he could not get to sleep that night until finally\r\nhe made up his mind that as they could not buy it he would give it\r\nto them anyway; which he did. But, unfortunately, we know that the\r\ntower of Siloam often falls upon the just and the unjust alike, and\r\nMr. Downey’s livery stable caught fire, and burned down. It was Sunday\r\nmorning, and the Baptist church was in session next door to him; and\r\nthe clergyman stopped and said, “Now, you women stay here and pray,\r\nand you men go straight out and help our benefactor, Mr. Downey”; and\r\ngo out they did, and got his horses all out, so that none of them was\r\nburned, although he suffered otherwise a total loss. Now, I call that a\r\npractical application of Mr. Wagner’s teachings. Here in Washington we\r\nhave a right to be proud of a citizen like Mr. Downey; and if only we\r\ncan develop enough such citizens, we shall turn out just the kind of\r\ncommunity that does not need to, but will always be glad to, study “The\r\nSimple Life,” the author of which I now introduce to you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, COMMUNICATED TO THE\r\nTWO HOUSES OF CONGRESS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD SESSION OF THE\r\nFIFTY-EIGHTH CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nThe Nation continues to enjoy noteworthy prosperity. Such prosperity\r\nis of course primarily due to the high individual average of our\r\ncitizenship, taken together with our great natural resources; but\r\nan important factor therein is the working of our long-continued\r\ngovernmental policies. The people have emphatically expressed their\r\napproval of the principles underlying these policies, and their desire\r\nthat these principles be kept substantially unchanged, although of\r\ncourse applied in a progressive spirit to meet changing conditions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of scope of the functions of the National Government\r\nrequired by our development as a nation involves, of course, increase\r\nof expense; and the period of prosperity through which the country is\r\npassing justifies expenditures for permanent improvements far greater\r\nthan would be wise in hard times. Battleships and forts, public\r\nbuildings, and improved waterways are investments which should be made\r\nwhen we have the money; but abundant revenues and a large surplus\r\nalways invite extravagance, and constant care should be taken to guard\r\nagainst unnecessary increase of the ordinary expenses of government.\r\nThe cost of doing Government business should be regulated with the same\r\nrigid scrutiny as the cost of doing a private business.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the vast and complicated mechanism of our modern civilized life\r\nthe dominant note is the note of industrialism; and the relations of\r\ncapital and labor, and especially of organized capital and organized\r\nlabor, to each other and to the public at large come second in\r\nimportance only to the intimate questions of family life. Our peculiar\r\nform of government, with its sharp division of authority between\r\nthe Nation and the several States, has been on the whole far more\r\nadvantageous to our development than a more strongly centralized\r\ngovernment. But it is undoubtedly responsible for much of the\r\ndifficulty of meeting with adequate legislation the new problems\r\npresented by the total change in industrial conditions on this\r\ncontinent during the last half century. In actual practice it has\r\nproved exceedingly difficult, and in many cases impossible, to get\r\nunanimity of wise action among the various States on these subjects.\r\nFrom the very nature of the case this is especially true of the laws\r\naffecting the employment of capital in huge masses.\r\n\r\nWith regard to labor the problem is no less important, but it is\r\nsimpler. As long as the States retain the primary control of the\r\npolice power the circumstances must be altogether extreme which\r\nrequire interference by the Federal authorities, whether in the way of\r\nsafeguarding the rights of labor or in the way of seeing that wrong is\r\nnot done by unruly persons who shield themselves behind the name of\r\nlabor. If there is resistance to the Federal courts, interference with\r\nthe mails or interstate commerce, or molestation of Federal property,\r\nor if the State authorities in some crisis which they are unable to\r\nface call for help, then the Federal Government may interfere; but\r\nthough such interference may be caused by a condition of things arising\r\nout of trouble connected with some question of labor, the interference\r\nitself simply takes the form of restoring order without regard to the\r\nquestions which have caused the breach of order—for to keep order is a\r\nprimary duty and in a time of disorder and violence all other questions\r\nsink into abeyance until order has been restored. In the District of\r\nColumbia and in the Territories the Federal law covers the entire\r\nfield of government; but the labor question is only acute in populous\r\ncentres of commerce, manufactures, or mining. Nevertheless, both in the\r\nenactment and in the enforcement of law the Federal Government within\r\nits restricted sphere should set an example to the State Governments,\r\nespecially in a matter so vital as this affecting labor. I believe\r\nthat under modern industrial conditions it is often necessary, and\r\neven where not necessary it is yet often wise, that there should be\r\norganization of labor in order better to secure the rights of the\r\nindividual wage-worker. All encouragement should be given to any such\r\norganization, so long as it is conducted with a due and decent regard\r\nfor the rights of others. There are in this country some labor unions\r\nwhich have habitually, and other labor unions which have often, been\r\namong the most effective agents in working for good citizenship and\r\nfor uplifting the condition of those whose welfare should be closest\r\nto our hearts. But when any labor union seeks improper ends, or seeks\r\nto achieve proper ends by improper means, all good citizens and more\r\nespecially all honorable public servants must oppose the wrongdoing\r\nas resolutely as they would oppose the wrongdoing of any great\r\ncorporation. Of course any violence, brutality, or corruption should\r\nnot for one moment be tolerated. Wage-workers have an entire right\r\nto organize and by all peaceful and honorable means to endeavor to\r\npersuade their fellows to join with them in organizations. They have\r\na legal right, which, according to circumstances, may or may not be a\r\nmoral right, to refuse to work in company with men who decline to join\r\ntheir organizations. They have under no circumstances the right to\r\ncommit violence upon those, whether capitalists or wage-workers, who\r\nrefuse to support their organizations, or who side with those with whom\r\nthey are at odds; for mob rule is intolerable in any form.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe wage-workers are peculiarly entitled to the protection and the\r\nencouragement of the law. From the very nature of their occupation\r\nrailroad men, for instance, are liable to be maimed in doing the\r\nlegitimate work of their profession, unless the railroad companies\r\nare required by law to make ample provision for their safety. The\r\nAdministration has been zealous in enforcing the existing law for this\r\npurpose. That law should be amended and strengthened. Wherever the\r\nNational Government has power there should be a stringent employers’\r\nliability law, which should apply to the Government itself where the\r\nGovernment is an employer of labor.\r\n\r\nIn my Message to the Fifty-seventh Congress, at its second session,\r\nI urged the passage of an employers’ liability law for the District\r\nof Columbia. I now renew that recommendation, and further recommend\r\nthat the Congress appoint a commission to make a comprehensive study\r\nof employers’ liability with the view of extending the provisions of\r\na great and constitutional law to all employments within the scope of\r\nFederal power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Government has recognized heroism upon the water, and bestows\r\nmedals of honor upon those persons who by extreme and heroic daring\r\nhave endangered their lives in saving, or endeavoring to save, lives\r\nfrom the perils of the sea in the waters over which the United States\r\nhas jurisdiction, or upon an American vessel. This recognition should\r\nbe extended to cover cases of conspicuous bravery and self-sacrifice in\r\nthe saving of life in private employments under the jurisdiction of the\r\nUnited States, and particularly in the land commerce of the Nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ever-increasing casualty list upon our railroads is a matter of\r\ngrave public concern, and urgently calls for action by the Congress.\r\nIn the matter of speed and comfort of railway travel our railroads\r\ngive at least as good service as those of any other nation, and there\r\nis no reason why this service should not also be as safe as human\r\ningenuity can make it. Many of our leading roads have been foremost\r\nin the adoption of the most approved safeguards for the protection\r\nof travelers and employees, yet the list of clearly avoidable\r\naccidents continues unduly large. The passage of a law requiring the\r\nadoption of a block-signal system has been proposed to the Congress.\r\nI earnestly concur in that recommendation, and would also point out\r\nto the Congress the urgent need of legislation in the interest of\r\nthe public safety limiting the hours of labor for railroad employees\r\nin train service upon railroads engaged in interstate commerce, and\r\nproviding that only trained and experienced persons be employed in\r\npositions of responsibility connected with the operation of trains. Of\r\ncourse, nothing can ever prevent accidents caused by human weakness or\r\nmisconduct; and there should be drastic punishment for any railroad\r\nemployee, whether officer or man, who by issuance of wrong orders or\r\nby disobedience of orders causes disaster. The law of 1901, requiring\r\ninterstate railroads to make monthly reports of all accidents to\r\npassengers and employees on duty, should also be amended so as to\r\nempower the Government to make a personal investigation, through\r\nproper officers, of all accidents involving loss of life which seem\r\nto require investigation, with a requirement that the results of such\r\ninvestigation be made public.\r\n\r\nThe safety-appliance law, as amended by the Act of March 2, 1903,\r\nhas proved beneficial to railway employees, and in order that its\r\nprovisions may be properly carried out, the force of inspectors\r\nprovided for by appropriation should be largely increased. This service\r\nis analogous to the Steamboat-Inspection Service, and deals with even\r\nmore important interests. It has passed the experimental stage and\r\ndemonstrated its utility, and should receive generous recognition by\r\nthe Congress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is no objection to employees of the Government forming or\r\nbelonging to unions; but the Government can neither discriminate for\r\nnor discriminate against non-union men who are in its employment,\r\nor who seek to be employed under it. Moreover, it is a very grave\r\nimpropriety for Government employees to band themselves together for\r\nthe purpose of extorting improperly high salaries from the Government.\r\nEspecially is this true of those within the classified service. The\r\nletter carriers, both municipal and rural, are as a whole an excellent\r\nbody of public servants. They should be amply paid. But their payment\r\nmust be obtained by arguing their claims fairly and honorably\r\nbefore the Congress, and not by banding together for the defeat of\r\nthose Congressmen who refuse to give promises which they can not in\r\nconscience give. The Administration has already taken steps to prevent\r\nand punish abuses of this nature; but it will be wise for the Congress\r\nto supplement this action by legislation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMuch can be done by the Government in labor matters merely by giving\r\npublicity to certain conditions. The Bureau of Labor has done excellent\r\nwork of this kind in many different directions. I shall shortly lay\r\nbefore you in a special message the full report of the investigation\r\nof the Bureau of Labor into the Colorado mining strike, as this is a\r\nstrike in which certain very evil forces, which are more or less at\r\nwork everywhere under the conditions of modern industrialism, became\r\nstartlingly prominent. It is greatly to be wished that the Department\r\nof Commerce and Labor, through the Labor Bureau, should compile and\r\narrange for the Congress a list of the labor laws of the various\r\nStates, and should be given the means to investigate and report to the\r\nCongress upon the labor conditions in the manufacturing and mining\r\nregions throughout the country, both as to wages, as to hours of labor,\r\nas to the labor of women and children, and as to the effect in the\r\nvarious labor centres of immigration from abroad. In this investigation\r\nespecial attention should be paid to the conditions of child labor and\r\nchild-labor legislation in the several States. Such an investigation\r\nmust necessarily take into account many of the problems with which this\r\nquestion of child labor is connected. These problems can be actually\r\nmet, in most cases, only by the States themselves; but the lack of\r\nproper legislation in one State in such a matter as child labor often\r\nrenders it excessively difficult to establish protective restriction\r\nupon the work in another State having the same industries, so that the\r\nworst tends to drag down the better. For this reason, it would be well\r\nfor the Nation at least to endeavor to secure comprehensive information\r\nas to the conditions of labor of children in the different States. Such\r\ninvestigation and publication by the National Government would tend\r\ntoward the securing of approximately uniform legislation of the proper\r\ncharacter among the several States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we come to deal with great corporations the need for the\r\nGovernment to act directly is far greater than in the case of labor,\r\nbecause great corporations can become such only by engaging in\r\ninterstate commerce, and interstate commerce is peculiarly the field\r\nof the General Government. It is an absurdity to expect to eliminate\r\nthe abuses in great corporations by State action. It is difficult to\r\nbe patient with an argument that such matters should be left to the\r\nStates, because more than one State pursues the policy of creating on\r\neasy terms corporations which are never operated within that State\r\nat all, but in other States whose laws they ignore. The National\r\nGovernment alone can deal adequately with these great corporations.\r\nTo try to deal with them in an intemperate, destructive, or demagogic\r\nspirit would, in all probability, mean that nothing whatever would\r\nbe accomplished, and, with absolute certainty, that if anything were\r\naccomplished it would be of a harmful nature. The American people need\r\nto continue to show the very qualities that they have shown—that is,\r\nmoderation, good sense, the earnest desire to avoid doing any damage,\r\nand yet the quiet determination to proceed, step by step, without halt\r\nand without hurry, in eliminating or at least in minimizing whatever\r\nof mischief or of evil there is to interstate commerce in the conduct\r\nof great corporations. They are acting in no spirit of hostility to\r\nwealth, either individual or corporate. They are not against the rich\r\nman any more than against the poor man. On the contrary, they are\r\nfriendly alike toward rich man and toward poor man, provided only that\r\neach acts in a spirit of justice and decency toward his fellows. Great\r\ncorporations are necessary, and only men of great and singular mental\r\npower can manage such corporations successfully, and such men must have\r\ngreat rewards. But these corporations should be managed with due regard\r\nto the interests of the public as a whole. Where this can be done under\r\nthe present laws it must be done. Where these laws come short others\r\nshould be enacted to supplement them.\r\n\r\nYet we must never forget the determining factor in every kind of\r\nwork, of head or hand, must be the man’s own good sense, courage, and\r\nkindliness. More important than any legislation is the gradual growth\r\nof a feeling of responsibility and forbearance among capitalists and\r\nwage-workers alike; a feeling of respect on the part of each man for\r\nthe rights of others; a feeling of broad community of interest, not\r\nmerely of capitalists among themselves, and of wage-workers among\r\nthemselves, but of capitalists and wage-workers in their relations to\r\neach other, and of both in their relations to their fellows who with\r\nthem make up the body politic. There are many captains of industry,\r\nmany labor leaders, who realize this. A recent speech by the president\r\nof one of our great railroad systems to the employees of that system\r\ncontains sound common-sense. It runs in part as follows:\r\n\r\n“It is my belief we can better serve each other, better understand the\r\nman as well as his business, when meeting face to face, exchanging\r\nviews, and realizing from personal contact we serve but one interest,\r\nthat of our mutual prosperity.\r\n\r\n“Serious misunderstandings can not occur where personal goodwill exists\r\nand opportunity for personal explanation is present.\r\n\r\n“In my early business life I had experience with men of affairs of\r\na character to make me desire to avoid creating a like feeling of\r\nresentment to myself and the interests in my charge, should fortune\r\never place me in authority, and I am solicitous of a measure of\r\nconfidence on the part of the public and our employees that I shall\r\nhope may be warranted by the fairness and good-fellowship I intend\r\nshall prevail in our relationship.\r\n\r\n“But do not feel I am disposed to grant unreasonable requests, spend\r\nthe money of our company unnecessarily or without value received,\r\nnor expect the days of mistakes are disappearing, or that cause for\r\ncomplaint will not continually occur; simply to correct such abuses\r\nas may be discovered, to better conditions as fast as reasonably\r\nmay be expected, constantly striving, with varying success, for\r\nthat improvement we all desire, to convince you there is a force at\r\nwork in the right direction, all the time making progress—is the\r\ndisposition with which I have come among you, asking your goodwill and\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\n“The day has gone by when a corporation can be handled successfully in\r\ndefiance of the public will, even though that will be unreasonable and\r\nwrong. A public may be led, but not driven, and I prefer to go with it\r\nand shape or modify, in a measure, its opinion, rather than be swept\r\nfrom my bearings, with loss to myself and the interests in my charge.\r\n\r\n“Violent prejudice exists toward corporate activity and capital to-day,\r\nmuch of it founded in reason, more in apprehension, and a large measure\r\nis due to the personal traits of arbitrary, unreasonable, incompetent,\r\nand offensive men in positions of authority. The accomplishment of\r\nresults by indirection, the endeavor to thwart the intention, if not\r\nthe expressed letter of the law (the will of the people), a disregard\r\nof the rights of others, a disposition to withhold what is due, to\r\nforce by main strength or inactivity a result not justified, depending\r\nupon the weakness of the claimant and his indisposition to become\r\ninvolved in litigation, has created a sentiment harmful in the extreme\r\nand a disposition to consider anything fair that gives gain to the\r\nindividual at the expense of the company.\r\n\r\n“If corporations are to continue to do the world’s work, as they are\r\nbest fitted to, these qualities in their representatives that have\r\nresulted in the present prejudice against them must be relegated to the\r\nbackground. The corporations must come out into the open and see and be\r\nseen. They must take the public into their confidence and ask for what\r\nthey want, and no more, and be prepared to explain satisfactorily what\r\nadvantage will accrue to the public if they are given their desires;\r\nfor they are permitted to exist not that they may make money solely,\r\nbut that they may effectively serve those from whom they derive their\r\npower.\r\n\r\n“Publicity, and not secrecy, will win hereafter, and laws be construed\r\nby their intent and not by their letter, otherwise public utilities\r\nwill be owned and operated by the public which created them, even\r\nthough the service be less efficient and the result less satisfactory\r\nfrom a financial standpoint.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Corporations has made careful preliminary investigation\r\nof many important corporations. It will make a special report on the\r\nbeef industry.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Bureau is to accomplish the purposes of its creation\r\nby co-operation, not antagonism; by making constructive legislation,\r\nnot destructive prosecution, the immediate object of its inquiries;\r\nby conservative investigation of law and fact, and by refusal to\r\nissue incomplete and hence necessarily inaccurate reports. Its policy\r\nbeing thus one of open inquiry into, and not attack upon, business,\r\nthe Bureau has been able to gain not only the confidence, but, better\r\nstill, the co-operation of men engaged in legitimate business.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau offers to the Congress the means of getting at the cost of\r\nproduction of our various great staples of commerce.\r\n\r\nOf necessity the careful investigation of special corporations will\r\nafford the Commissioner knowledge of certain business facts, the\r\npublication of which might be an improper infringement of private\r\nrights. The method of making public the results of these investigations\r\naffords, under the law, a means for the protection of private rights.\r\nThe Congress will have all facts except such as would give to another\r\ncorporation information which would injure the legitimate business of\r\na competitor and destroy the incentive for individual superiority and\r\nthrift.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau has also made exhaustive examinations into the legal\r\ncondition under which corporate business is carried on in the various\r\nStates; into all judicial decisions on the subject; and into the\r\nvarious systems of corporate taxation in use. I call special attention\r\nto the report of the chief of the Bureau; and I earnestly ask that\r\nthe Congress carefully consider the report and recommendations of the\r\nCommissioner on this subject.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe business of insurance vitally affects the great mass of the\r\npeople of the United States and is national and not local in its\r\napplication. It involves a multitude of transactions among the people\r\nof the different States and between American companies and foreign\r\nGovernments. I urge that the Congress carefully consider whether\r\nthe power of the Bureau of Corporations can not constitutionally be\r\nextended to cover interstate transactions in insurance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAbove all else, we must strive to keep the highways of commerce open to\r\nall on equal terms; and to do this it is necessary to put a complete\r\nstop to all rebates. Whether the shipper or the railroad is to blame\r\nmakes no difference; the rebate must be stopped, the abuses of the\r\nprivate car and private terminal-track and side-track systems must\r\nbe stopped, and the legislation of the Fifty-eighth Congress which\r\ndeclares it to be unlawful for any person or corporation to offer,\r\ngrant, give, solicit, accept, or receive any rebate, concession, or\r\ndiscrimination in respect of the transportation of any property in\r\ninterstate or foreign commerce whereby such property shall by any\r\ndevice whatever be transported at a less rate than that named in the\r\ntariffs published by the carrier must be enforced. For some time after\r\nthe enactment of the Act to Regulate Commerce it remained a mooted\r\nquestion whether that act conferred upon the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission the power, after it had found a challenged rate to be\r\nunreasonable, to declare what thereafter should, prima facie, be the\r\nreasonable maximum rate for the transportation in dispute. The Supreme\r\nCourt finally resolved that question in the negative, so that as the\r\nlaw now stands the Commission simply possess the bare power to denounce\r\na particular rate as unreasonable. While I am of the opinion that at\r\npresent it would be undesirable, if it were not impracticable, finally\r\nto clothe the Commission with general authority to fix railroad rates,\r\nI do believe that, as a fair security to shippers, the Commission\r\nshould be vested with the power, where a given rate has been challenged\r\nand after full hearing found to be unreasonable, to decide, subject to\r\njudicial review, what shall be a reasonable rate to take its place;\r\nthe ruling of the Commission to take effect immediately, and to obtain\r\nunless and until it is reversed by the court of review. The Government\r\nmust in increasing degree supervise and regulate the workings of the\r\nrailways engaged in interstate commerce; and such increased supervision\r\nis the only alternative to an increase of the present evils on the one\r\nhand or a still more radical policy on the other. In my judgment the\r\nmost important legislative act now needed as regards the regulation\r\nof corporations is this act to confer on the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission the power to revise rates and regulations, the revised rate\r\nto at once go into effect, and to stay in effect unless and until the\r\ncourt of review reverses it.\r\n\r\nSteamship companies engaged in interstate commerce and protected in\r\nour coastwise trade, should be held to a strict observance of the\r\ninterstate commerce act.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the set plan to make the city of Washington an example to\r\nother American municipalities several points should be kept in mind\r\nby the legislators. In the first place, the people of this country\r\nshould clearly understand that no amount of industrial prosperity,\r\nand above all no leadership in international industrial competition,\r\ncan in any way atone for the sapping of the vitality of those who are\r\nusually spoken of as the working classes. The farmers, the mechanics,\r\nthe skilled and unskilled laborers, the small shopkeepers, make up\r\nthe bulk of the population of any country; and upon their well-being,\r\ngeneration after generation, the well-being of the country and the\r\nrace depends. Rapid development in wealth and industrial leadership\r\nis a good thing, but only if it goes hand in hand with improvement,\r\nand not deterioration, physical and moral. The overcrowding of cities\r\nand the draining of country districts are unhealthy and even dangerous\r\nsymptoms in our modern life. We should not permit overcrowding in\r\ncities. In certain European cities it is provided by law that the\r\npopulation of towns shall not be allowed to exceed a very limited\r\ndensity for a given area, so that the increase in density must be\r\ncontinually pushed back into a broad zone around the centre of the\r\ntown, this zone having great avenues or parks within it. The death-rate\r\nstatistics show a terrible increase in mortality, and especially in\r\ninfant mortality, in overcrowded tenements. The poorest families\r\nin tenement houses live in one room, and it appears that in these\r\none-room tenements the average death-rate for a number of given cities\r\nat home and abroad is about twice what it is in a two-room tenement,\r\nfour times what it is in a three-room tenement, and eight times what\r\nit is in a tenement consisting of four rooms or over. These figures\r\nvary somewhat for different cities, but they approximate in each\r\ncity those given above; and in all cases the increase of mortality,\r\nand especially of infant mortality, with the decrease in the number\r\nof rooms used by the family and with the consequent overcrowding is\r\nstartling. The slum exacts a heavy total of deaths from those who dwell\r\ntherein; and this is the case not merely in the great crowded slums\r\nof high buildings in New York and Chicago, but in the alley slums of\r\nWashington. In Washington people can not afford to ignore the harm that\r\nthis causes. No Christian and civilized community can afford to show a\r\nhappy-go-lucky lack of concern for the youth of to-day; for, if so, the\r\ncommunity will have to pay a terrible penalty of financial burden and\r\nsocial degradation in the to-morrow. There should be severe child-labor\r\nand factory-inspection laws. It is very desirable that married women\r\nshould not work in factories. The prime duty of the man is to work, to\r\nbe the breadwinner; the prime duty of the woman is to be the mother,\r\nthe housewife. All questions of tariff and finance sink into utter\r\ninsignificance when compared with the tremendous, the vital importance\r\nof trying to shape conditions so that these two duties of the man and\r\nof the woman can be fulfilled under reasonably favorable circumstances.\r\nIf a race does not have plenty of children, or if the children do not\r\ngrow up, or if when they grow up they are unhealthy in body and stunted\r\nor vicious in mind, then that race is decadent, and no heaping up of\r\nwealth, no splendor of momentary material prosperity, can avail in any\r\ndegree as offsets.\r\n\r\nThe Congress has the same power of legislation for the District of\r\nColumbia which the State Legislatures have for the various States. The\r\nproblems incident to our highly complex modern industrial civilization,\r\nwith its manifold and perplexing tendencies both for good and for\r\nevil, are far less sharply accentuated in the city of Washington than\r\nin most other cities. For this very reason it is easier to deal with\r\nthe various phases of these problems in Washington, and the District\r\nof Columbia government should be a model for the other municipal\r\ngovernments of the Nation, in all such matters as supervision of the\r\nhousing of the poor, the creation of small parks in the districts\r\ninhabited by the poor, in laws affecting labor, in laws providing for\r\nthe taking care of the children, in truant laws, and in providing\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nIn the vital matter of taking care of children, much advantage could\r\nbe gained by a careful study of what has been accomplished in such\r\nStates as Illinois and Colorado by the juvenile courts. The work\r\nof the juvenile court is really a work of character building. It\r\nis now generally recognized that young boys and young girls who go\r\nwrong should not be treated as criminals, not even necessarily as\r\nneeding reformation, but rather as needing to have their characters\r\nformed, and for this end to have them tested and developed by a\r\nsystem of probation. Much admirable work has been done in many of our\r\nCommonwealths by earnest men and women who have made a special study\r\nof the needs of those classes of children which furnish the greatest\r\nnumber of juvenile offenders, and therefore the greatest number of\r\nadult offenders; and by their aid, and by profiting by the experiences\r\nof the different States and cities in these matters, it would be easy\r\nto provide a good code for the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nSeveral considerations suggest the need for a systematic investigation\r\ninto and improvement of housing conditions in Washington. The hidden\r\nresidential alleys are breeding grounds of vice and disease, and\r\nshould be opened into minor streets. For a number of years influential\r\ncitizens have joined with the District Commissioners in the vain\r\nendeavor to secure laws permitting the condemnation of unsanitary\r\ndwellings. The local death-rates, especially from preventable diseases,\r\nare so unduly high as to suggest that the exceptional wholesomeness of\r\nWashington’s better sections is offset by bad conditions in her poorer\r\nneighborhoods. A special “Commission on Housing and Health Conditions\r\nin the National Capital” would not only bring about the reformation\r\nof existing evils, but would also formulate an appropriate building\r\ncode to protect the city from mammoth brick tenements and other evils\r\nwhich threaten to develop here as they have in other cities. That the\r\nNation’s Capital should be made a model for other municipalities is\r\nan ideal which appeals to all patriotic citizens everywhere, and such\r\na special Commission might map out and organize the city’s future\r\ndevelopment in lines of civic social service, just as Major L’Enfant\r\nand the recent Park Commission planned the arrangement of her streets\r\nand parks.\r\n\r\nIt is mortifying to remember that Washington has no compulsory school\r\nattendance law and that careful inquiries indicate the habitual absence\r\nfrom school of some twenty per cent of all children between the ages of\r\neight and fourteen. It must be evident to all who consider the problems\r\nof neglected child life, or the benefits of compulsory education in\r\nother cities, that one of the most urgent needs of the National Capital\r\nis a law requiring the school attendance of all children, this law to\r\nbe enforced by attendance agents directed by the Board of Education.\r\n\r\nPublic playgrounds are necessary means for the development of wholesome\r\ncitizenship in modern cities. It is important that the work inaugurated\r\nhere through voluntary efforts should be taken up and extended through\r\nCongressional appropriation of funds sufficient to equip and maintain\r\nnumerous convenient small playgrounds upon land which can be secured\r\nwithout purchase or rental. It is also desirable that small vacant\r\nplaces be purchased and reserved as small-park playgrounds in densely\r\nsettled sections of the city which now have no public open spaces and\r\nare destined soon to be built up solidly. All these needs should be met\r\nimmediately. To meet them would entail expenses; but a corresponding\r\nsaving could be made by stopping the building of streets and leveling\r\nof ground for purposes largely speculative in outlying parts of the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThere are certain offenders, whose criminality takes the shape of\r\nbrutality and cruelty toward the weak, who need a special type of\r\npunishment. The wife-beater, for example, is inadequately punished by\r\nimprisonment; for imprisonment may often mean nothing to him, while it\r\nmay cause hunger and want to the wife and children who have been the\r\nvictims of his brutality. Probably some form of corporal punishment\r\nwould be the most adequate way of meeting this kind of crime.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has grown into an educational institution\r\nwith a faculty of two thousand specialists making research into all\r\nthe sciences of production. The Congress appropriates, directly and\r\nindirectly, six millions of dollars annually to carry on this work.\r\nIt reaches every State and Territory in the Union and the islands of\r\nthe sea lately come under our flag. Co-operation is had with the State\r\nexperiment stations, and with many other institutions and individuals.\r\nThe world is carefully searched for new varieties of grains, fruits,\r\ngrasses, vegetables, trees, and shrubs, suitable to various localities\r\nin our country; and marked benefit to our producers has resulted.\r\n\r\nThe activities of our age in lines of research have reached the tillers\r\nof the soil and inspired them with ambition to know more of the\r\nprinciples that govern the forces of nature with which they have to\r\ndeal. Nearly half of the people of this country devote their energies\r\nto growing things from the soil. Until a recent date little has been\r\ndone to prepare these millions for their life work. In most lines of\r\nhuman activity college-trained men are the leaders. The farmer had no\r\nopportunity for special training until the Congress made provision\r\nfor it forty years ago. During these years progress has been made\r\nand teachers have been prepared. Over five thousand students are in\r\nattendance at our State agricultural colleges. The Federal Government\r\nexpends ten millions of dollars annually toward this education and for\r\nresearch in Washington and in the several States and Territories.\r\nThe Department of Agriculture has given facilities for post-graduate\r\nwork to five hundred young men during the last seven years, preparing\r\nthem for advanced lines of work in the Department and in the State\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe facts concerning meteorology and its relations to plant and animal\r\nlife are being systematically inquired into. Temperature and moisture\r\nare controlling factors in all agricultural operations. The seasons of\r\nthe cyclones of the Caribbean Sea and their paths are being forecasted\r\nwith increasing accuracy. The cold winds that come from the north are\r\nanticipated and their times and intensity told to farmers, gardeners,\r\nand fruiterers in all southern localities.\r\n\r\nWe sell two hundred and fifty million dollars’ worth of animals and\r\nanimal products to foreign countries every year, in addition to\r\nsupplying our own people more cheaply and abundantly than any other\r\nnation is able to provide for its people. Successful manufacturing\r\ndepends primarily on cheap food, which accounts to a considerable\r\nextent for our growth in this direction. The Department of Agriculture,\r\nby careful inspection of meats, guards the health of our people and\r\ngives clean bills of health to deserving exports; it is prepared to\r\ndeal promptly with imported diseases of animals, and maintain the\r\nexcellence of our flocks and herds in this respect. There should be an\r\nannual census of the live stock of the nation.\r\n\r\nWe sell abroad about six hundred million dollars’ worth of plants and\r\ntheir products every year. Strenuous efforts are being made to import\r\nfrom foreign countries such grains as are suitable to our varying\r\nlocalities. Seven years ago we bought three-fourths of our rice;\r\nby helping the rice growers on the Gulf Coast to secure seeds from\r\nthe Orient suited to their conditions, and by giving them adequate\r\nprotection, they now supply home demand and export to the islands\r\nof the Caribbean Sea and to other rice-growing countries. Wheat and\r\nother grains have been imported from light-rainfall countries to our\r\nlands in the West and Southwest that have not grown crops because\r\nof light precipitation, resulting in an extensive addition to our\r\ncropping area and our home-making territory that can not be irrigated.\r\nTen million bushels of first-class macaroni wheat were grown from\r\nthese experimental importations last year. Fruits suitable to our\r\nsoils and climates are being imported from all the countries of the\r\nOld World—the fig from Turkey, the almond from Spain, the date from\r\nAlgeria, the mango from India. We are helping our fruit growers to\r\nget their crops into European markets by studying their methods of\r\npreservation through refrigeration, packing, and handling, which have\r\nbeen quite successful. We are helping our hop growers by importing\r\nvarieties that ripen earlier and later than the kinds they have been\r\nraising, thereby lengthening the harvesting season. The cotton crop of\r\nthe country is threatened with root rot, the bollworm, and the boll\r\nweevil. Our pathologists will find immune varieties that will resist\r\nthe root disease, and the bollworm can be dealt with, but the boll\r\nweevil is a serious menace to the cotton crop. It is a Central American\r\ninsect that has become acclimated in Texas and has done great damage. A\r\nscientist of the Department of Agriculture has found the weevil at home\r\nin Guatemala being kept in check by an ant, which has been brought to\r\nour cotton fields for observation. It is hoped that it may serve a good\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe soils of the country are getting attention from the farmer’s\r\nstandpoint, and interesting results are following. We have duplicates\r\nof the soils that grow the wrapper tobacco in Sumatra and the filler\r\ntobacco in Cuba. It will be only a question of time when the large\r\namounts paid to these countries will be paid to our own people. The\r\nreclamation of alkali lands is progressing, to give object lessons to\r\nour people in methods by which worthless lands may be made productive.\r\n\r\nThe insect friends and enemies of the farmer are getting attention. The\r\nenemy of the San Jose scale was found near the Great Wall of China,\r\nand is now cleaning up all our orchards. The fig-fertilizing insect\r\nimported from Turkey has helped to establish an industry in California\r\nthat amounts to from fifty to one hundred tons of dried figs annually,\r\nand is extending over the Pacific Coast. A parasitic fly from South\r\nAfrica is keeping in subjection the black scale, the worst pest of the\r\norange and lemon industry in California.\r\n\r\nCareful preliminary work is being done toward producing our own silk.\r\nThe mulberry is being distributed in large numbers, eggs are being\r\nimported and distributed, improved reels were imported from Europe last\r\nyear, and two expert reelers were brought to Washington to reel the\r\ncrop of cocoons and teach the art to our own people.\r\n\r\nThe crop-reporting system of the Department of Agriculture is being\r\nbrought closer to accuracy every year. It has two hundred and fifty\r\nthousand reporters selected from people in eight vocations in life.\r\nIt has arrangements with most European countries for interchange of\r\nestimates, so that our people may know as nearly as possible with what\r\nthey must compete.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the two and a half years that have elapsed since the passage\r\nof the reclamation act, rapid progress has been made in the surveys\r\nand examinations of the opportunities for reclamation in the thirteen\r\nStates and three Territories of the arid West. Construction has\r\nalready been begun on the largest and most important of the irrigation\r\nworks, and plans are being completed for works which will utilize\r\nthe funds now available. The operations are being carried on by the\r\nReclamation Service, a corps of engineers selected through competitive\r\ncivil-service examinations. This corps includes experienced consulting\r\nand constructing engineers, as well as various experts in mechanical\r\nand legal matters, and is composed largely of men who have spent\r\nmost of their lives in practical affairs connected with irrigation.\r\nThe larger problems have been solved, and it now remains to execute\r\nwith care, economy, and thoroughness the work which has been laid\r\nout. All important details are being carefully considered by boards\r\nof consulting engineers, selected for their thorough knowledge and\r\npractical experience. Each project is taken up on the ground by\r\ncompetent men and viewed from the standpoint of the creation of\r\nprosperous homes and of promptly refunding to the Treasury the cost\r\nof construction. The reclamation act has been found to be remarkably\r\ncomplete and effective, and so broad in its provisions that a wide\r\nrange of undertakings has been possible under it. At the same time,\r\neconomy is guaranteed by the fact that the funds must ultimately be\r\nreturned to be used over again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is the cardinal principle of the forest-reserve policy of this\r\nAdministration that the reserves are for use. Whatever interferes\r\nwith the use of their resources is to be avoided by every possible\r\nmeans. But these resources must be used in such a way as to make them\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nThe forest policy of the Government is just now a subject of vivid\r\npublic interest throughout the West and to the people of the United\r\nStates in general. The forest reserves themselves are of extreme value\r\nto the present as well as to the future welfare of all the Western\r\npublic-land States. They powerfully affect the use and disposal of the\r\npublic lands. They are of special importance because they preserve\r\nthe water supply and the supply of timber for domestic purposes, and\r\nso promote settlement under the reclamation act. Indeed, they are\r\nessential to the welfare of every one of the great interests of the\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nForest reserves are created for two principal purposes. The first is\r\nto preserve the water supply. This is their most important use. The\r\nprincipal users of the water thus preserved are irrigation ranchers\r\nand settlers, cities and towns to whom their municipal water supplies\r\nare of the very first importance, users and furnishers of water power,\r\nand the users of water for domestic, manufacturing, mining, and other\r\npurposes. All these are directly dependent upon the forest reserves.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for which forest reserves are created is to preserve\r\nthe timber supply for various classes of wood users. Among the more\r\nimportant of these are settlers under the reclamation act and other\r\nacts, for whom a cheap and accessible supply of timber for domestic\r\nuses is absolutely necessary; miners and prospectors, who are in\r\nserious danger of losing their timber supply by fire or through export\r\nby lumber companies when timber lands adjacent to their mines pass into\r\nprivate ownership; lumbermen, transportation companies, builders, and\r\ncommercial interests in general.\r\n\r\nAlthough the wisdom of creating forest reserves is nearly everywhere\r\nheartily recognized, yet in a few localities there has been\r\nmisunderstanding and complaint. The following statement is therefore\r\ndesirable:\r\n\r\nThe forest-reserve policy can be successful only when it has the full\r\nsupport of the people of the West. It can not safely, and should not\r\nin any case, be imposed upon them against their will. But neither can\r\nwe accept the views of those whose only interest in the forest is\r\ntemporary; who are anxious to reap what they have not sown and then\r\nmove away, leaving desolation behind them. On the contrary, it is\r\neverywhere and always the interest of the permanent settler and the\r\npermanent business man, the man with a stake in the country, which must\r\nbe considered and which must decide.\r\n\r\nThe making of forest reserves within railroad and wagon-road land-grant\r\nlimits will hereafter, as for the past three years, be so managed as to\r\nprevent the issue, under the act of June 4, 1897, of base for exchange\r\nor lieu selection (usually called scrip). In all cases where forest\r\nreserves within areas covered by land grants appear to be essential\r\nto the prosperity of settlers, miners, or others, the Government\r\nlands within such proposed forest reserves will, as in the recent\r\npast, be withdrawn from sale or entry pending the completion of such\r\nnegotiations with the owners of the land grants as will prevent the\r\ncreation of so-called scrip.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the custom to make forest reserves without first\r\ngetting definite and detailed information as to the character of\r\nland and timber within their boundaries. This method of action often\r\nresulted in badly chosen boundaries and consequent injustice to\r\nsettlers and others. Therefore this Administration adopted the present\r\nmethod of first withdrawing the land from disposal, followed by careful\r\nexamination on the ground and the preparation of detailed maps and\r\ndescriptions, before any forest-reserve is created.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly called attention to the confusion which exists\r\nin Government forest matters because the work is scattered among\r\nthree independent organizations. The United States is the only one\r\nof the great nations in which the forest work of the Government\r\nis not concentrated under one department, in consonance with the\r\nplainest dictates of good administration and common-sense. The\r\npresent arrangement is bad from every point of view. Merely to\r\nmention it is to prove that it should be terminated at once. As I\r\nhave repeatedly recommended, all the forest work of the Government\r\nshould be concentrated in the Department of Agriculture, where the\r\nlarger part of that work is already done, where practically all of\r\nthe trained foresters of the Government are employed, where chiefly\r\nin Washington there is comprehensive firsthand knowledge of the\r\nproblems of the reserves acquired on the ground, where all problems\r\nrelating to growth from the soil are already gathered, and where\r\nall the sciences auxiliary to forestry are at hand for prompt and\r\neffective co-operation. These reasons are decisive in themselves, but\r\nit should be added that the great organizations of citizens whose\r\ninterests are affected by the forest reserves, such as the National\r\nLive Stock Association, the National Wool Growers’ Association, the\r\nAmerican Mining Congress, the National Irrigation Congress, and the\r\nNational Board of Trade, have uniformly, emphatically, and most of them\r\nrepeatedly, expressed themselves in favor of placing all Government\r\nforest work in the Department of Agriculture because of the peculiar\r\nadaptation of that Department for it. It is true, also, that the\r\nforest services of nearly all the great nations of the world are under\r\nthe respective departments of agriculture, while in but two of the\r\nsmaller nations and in one colony are they under the department of the\r\ninterior. This is the result of long and varied experience, and it\r\nagrees fully with the requirements of good administration in our own\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe creation of a forest service in the Department of Agriculture will\r\nhave for its important results:\r\n\r\nFirst. A better handling of all forest work, because it will be under\r\na single head, and because the vast and indispensable experience of\r\nthe Department in all matters pertaining to the forest reserves, to\r\nforestry in general, and to other forms of production from the soil,\r\nwill be easily and rapidly accessible.\r\n\r\nSecond. The reserves themselves, being handled from the point of view\r\nof the man in the field, instead of the man in the office, will be more\r\neasily and more widely useful to the people of the West than has been\r\nthe case hitherto.\r\n\r\nThird. Within a comparatively short time the reserves will become\r\nself-supporting. This is important, because continually and rapidly\r\nincreasing appropriations will be necessary for the proper care of\r\nthis exceedingly important interest of the Nation, and they can and\r\nshould be offset by returns from the National forests. Under similar\r\ncircumstances the forest possessions of other great nations form an\r\nimportant source of revenue to their Governments.\r\n\r\nEvery administrative officer concerned is convinced of the necessity\r\nfor the proposed consolidation of forest work in the Department of\r\nAgriculture, and I myself have urged it more than once in former\r\nmessages. Again I commend it to the early and favorable consideration\r\nof the Congress. The interests of the Nation at large and of the West\r\nin particular have suffered greatly because of the delay.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI call the attention of the Congress again to the report and\r\nrecommendation of the Commission on the Public Lands forwarded by me\r\nto the second session of the present Congress. The Commission has\r\nprosecuted its investigations actively during the past season, and a\r\nsecond report is now in an advanced stage of preparation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn connection with the work of the forest reserves I desire again to\r\nurge upon the Congress the importance of authorizing the President to\r\nset aside certain portions of these reserves or other public lands as\r\ngame refuges for the preservation of the bison, the wapiti, and other\r\nlarge beasts once so abundant in our woods and mountains and on our\r\ngreat plains, and now tending toward extinction. Every support should\r\nbe given to the authorities of the Yellowstone Park in their successful\r\nefforts at preserving the large creatures therein; and at very little\r\nexpense portions of the public domain in other regions which are wholly\r\nunsuited to agricultural settlement could be similarly utilized. We\r\nowe it to future generations to keep alive the noble and beautiful\r\ncreatures which by their presence add such distinctive character to\r\nthe American wilderness. The limits of the Yellowstone Park should\r\nbe extended southward. The Canyon of the Colorado should be made a\r\nnational park; and the national park system should include the Yosemite\r\nand as many as possible of the groves of giant trees in California.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe veterans of the Civil War have a claim upon the Nation such as no\r\nother body of our citizens possess. The Pension Bureau has never in\r\nits history been managed in a more satisfactory manner than is now the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe progress of the Indians toward civilization, though not rapid,\r\nis perhaps all that could be hoped for in view of the circumstances.\r\nWithin the past year many tribes have shown, in a degree greater than\r\never before, an appreciation of the necessity of work. This changed\r\nattitude is in part due to the policy recently pursued of reducing the\r\namount of subsistence to the Indians, and thus forcing them, through\r\nsheer necessity, to work for a livelihood. The policy, though severe,\r\nis a useful one, but it is to be exercised only with judgment and with\r\na full understanding of the conditions which exist in each community\r\nfor which it is intended. On or near the Indian reservations there is\r\nusually very little demand for labor, and if the Indians are to earn\r\ntheir living and when work can not be furnished from outside (which\r\nis always preferable), then it must be furnished by the Government.\r\nPractical instruction of this kind would in a few years result in the\r\nforming of habits of regular industry, which would render the Indian\r\na producer, and would effect a great reduction in the cost of his\r\nmaintenance.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly declared that the slow advance of the Indians is due to\r\nthe unsatisfactory character of the men appointed to take immediate\r\ncharge of them, and to some extent this is true. While the standard of\r\nthe employees in the Indian Service shows great improvement over that\r\nof bygone years, and while actual corruption or flagrant dishonesty\r\nis now the rare exception, it is, nevertheless, the fact that the\r\nsalaries paid Indian agents are not large enough to attract the best\r\nmen to that field of work. To achieve satisfactory results the official\r\nin charge of an Indian tribe should possess the high qualifications\r\nwhich are required in the manager of a large business, but only in\r\nexceptional cases is it possible to secure men of such a type for\r\nthese positions. Much better service, however, might be obtained from\r\nthose now holding the places were it practicable to get out of them\r\nthe best that is in them, and this should be done by bringing them\r\nconstantly into closer touch with their superior officers. An agent\r\nwho has been content to draw his salary, giving in return the least\r\npossible equivalent in effort and service, may, by proper treatment, by\r\nsuggestion and encouragement, or persistent urging, be stimulated to\r\ngreater effort and induced to take a more active personal interest in\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\nUnder existing conditions an Indian agent in the distant West may be\r\nwholly out of touch with the office of the Indian Bureau. He may very\r\nwell feel that no one takes a personal interest in him or his efforts.\r\nCertain routine duties in the way of reports and accounts are required\r\nof him, but there is no one with whom he may intelligently consult on\r\nmatters vital to his work, except after long delay. Such a man would be\r\ngreatly encouraged and aided by personal contact with some one whose\r\ninterest in Indian affairs and whose authority in the Indian Bureau\r\nwere greater than his own, and such contact would be certain to arouse\r\nand constantly increase the interest he takes in his work.\r\n\r\nThe distance which separates the agents—the workers in the field—from\r\nthe Indian Office in Washington is a chief obstacle to Indian progress.\r\nWhatever shall more closely unite these two branches of the Indian\r\nService, and shall enable them to co-operate more heartily and more\r\neffectively, will be for the increased efficiency of the work and the\r\nbetterment of the race for whose improvement the Indian Bureau was\r\nestablished. The appointment of a field assistant to the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs would be certain to ensure this good end. Such an\r\nofficial, if possessed of the requisite energy and deep interest in\r\nthe work, would be a most efficient factor in bringing into closer\r\nrelationship and a more direct union of effort the Bureau in Washington\r\nand its agents in the field; and with the co-operation of its branches\r\nthus secured the Indian Bureau would, in measure fuller than ever\r\nbefore, lift up the savage toward that self-help and self-reliance\r\nwhich constitute the man.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1907 there will be held at Hampton Roads the tricentennial\r\ncelebration of the settlement at Jamestown, Va., with which the history\r\nof what has now become the United States really begins. I commend this\r\nto your favorable consideration. It is an event of prime historic\r\nsignificance, in which all the people of the United States should feel,\r\nand should show, great and general interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Post Office Department the service has increased in efficiency,\r\nand conditions as to revenue and expenditure continue satisfactory.\r\nThe increase of revenue during the year was $9,358,181.10, or 6.9\r\nper cent, the total receipts amounting to $143,382,624.34. The\r\nexpenditures were $152,362,116.70, an increase of about 9 per cent over\r\nthe previous year, being thus $8,979,492.36 in excess of the current\r\nrevenue. Included in these expenditures was a total appropriation\r\nof $12,956,637.35 for the continuation and extension of the rural\r\nfree-delivery service, which was an increase of $4,902,237.35 over\r\nthe amount expended for this purpose in the preceding fiscal year.\r\nLarge as this expenditure has been, the beneficent results attained\r\nin extending the free distribution of mails to the residents of rural\r\ndistricts have justified the wisdom of the outlay. Statistics brought\r\ndown to the 1st of October, 1904, show that on that date there were\r\n27,138 rural routes established, serving approximately 12,000,000 of\r\npeople in rural districts remote from post offices, and that there were\r\npending at that time 3,859 petitions for the establishment of new rural\r\nroutes. Unquestionably some part of the general increase in receipts\r\nis due to the increased postal facilities which the rural service has\r\nafforded. The revenues have also been aided greatly by amendments in\r\nthe classification of mail matter, and the curtailment of abuses of the\r\nsecond-class mailing privilege. The average increase in the volume of\r\nmail matter for the period beginning with 1902 and ending June, 1905\r\n(that portion for 1905 being estimated), is 40.47 per cent, as compared\r\nwith 25.46 per cent for the period immediately preceding, and 15.92 for\r\nthe four-year period immediately preceding that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur consular system needs improvement. Salaries should be substituted\r\nfor fees, and the proper classification, grading, and transfer of\r\nconsular officers should be provided. I am not prepared to say that a\r\ncompetitive system of examinations for appointment would work well; but\r\nby law it should be provided that consuls should be familiar, according\r\nto places for which they apply, with the French, German, or Spanish\r\nlanguages, and should possess acquaintance with the resources of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe collection of objects of art contemplated in Section 5586 of the\r\nRevised Statutes should be designated and established as a National\r\nGallery of Art; and the Smithsonian Institution should be authorized to\r\naccept any additions to said collection that may be received by gift,\r\nbequest, or devise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to enact a proper National quarantine law. It is\r\nmost undesirable that a State should on its own initiative enforce\r\nquarantine regulations which are in effect a restriction upon\r\ninterstate and international commerce. The question should properly\r\nbe assumed by the Government alone. The Surgeon-General of the\r\nNational Public Health and Marine-Hospital Service has repeatedly and\r\nconvincingly set forth the need for such legislation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI call your attention to the great extravagance in printing and binding\r\nGovernment publications, and especially to the fact that altogether too\r\nmany of these publications are printed. There is a constant tendency to\r\nincrease their number and their volume. It is an understatement to say\r\nthat no appreciable harm would be caused by, and substantial benefit\r\nwould accrue from, decreasing the amount of printing now done by at\r\nleast one-half. Probably the great majority of the Government reports\r\nand the like now printed are never read at all, and furthermore the\r\nprinting of much of the material contained in many of the remaining\r\nones serves no useful purpose whatever.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Congress should be especially given to the\r\ncurrency question, and that the standing committees on the matter in\r\nthe two Houses charged with the duty take up the matter of our currency\r\nand see whether it is not possible to secure an agreement in the\r\nbusiness world for bettering the system; the committees should consider\r\nthe question of the retirement of the greenbacks and the problem of\r\nsecuring in our currency such elasticity as is consistent with safety.\r\nEvery silver dollar should be made by law redeemable in gold at the\r\noption of the holder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI especially commend to your immediate attention the encouragement of\r\nour merchant marine by appropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe growing importance of the Orient as a field for American exports\r\ndrew from my predecessor, President McKinley, an urgent request for its\r\nspecial consideration by the Congress. In his message of 1898 he stated:\r\n\r\n“In this relation, as showing the peculiar volume and value of our\r\ntrade with China and the peculiarly favorable conditions which exist\r\nfor their expansion in the normal course of trade, I refer to the\r\ncommunication addressed to the Speaker of the House of Representatives\r\nby the Secretary of the Treasury on the 14th of last June, with\r\nits accompanying letter of the Secretary of State, recommending an\r\nappropriation for a commission to study the industrial and commercial\r\nconditions in the Chinese Empire and to report as to the opportunities\r\nfor and the obstacles to the enlargement of markets in China for the\r\nraw products and manufactures of the United States. Action was not\r\ntaken thereon during the last session. I cordially urge that the\r\nrecommendation receive at your hands the consideration which its\r\nimportance and timeliness merit.”\r\n\r\nIn his annual message of 1899 he again called attention to this\r\nrecommendation, quoting it, and stated further:\r\n\r\n“I now renew this recommendation, as the importance of the subject has\r\nsteadily grown since it was first submitted to you, and no time should\r\nbe lost in studying for ourselves the resources of this great field for\r\nAmerican trade and enterprise.”\r\n\r\nThe importance of securing proper information and data with a view to\r\nthe enlargement of our trade with Asia is undiminished. Our consular\r\nrepresentatives in China have strongly urged a place for permanent\r\ndisplay of American products in some prominent trade centre of that\r\nEmpire, under Government control and management, as an effective means\r\nof advancing our export trade therein. I call the attention of the\r\nCongress to the desirability of carrying out these suggestions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the questions of immigration and naturalization it is\r\nindispensable to keep certain facts ever before the minds of those\r\nwho share in enacting the laws. First and foremost, let us remember\r\nthat the question of being a good American has nothing whatever to do\r\nwith a man’s birthplace any more than it has to do with his creed.\r\nIn every generation from the time this Government was founded men of\r\nforeign birth have stood in the very foremost rank of good citizenship,\r\nand that not merely in one, but in every field of American activity;\r\nwhile to try to draw a distinction between the man whose parents\r\ncame to this country and the man whose ancestors came to it several\r\ngenerations back is a mere absurdity. Good Americanism is a matter of\r\nheart, of conscience, of lofty aspiration, of sound common-sense, but\r\nnot of birthplace or of creed. The medal of honor, the highest prize\r\nto be won by those who serve in the Army and the Navy of the United\r\nStates, decorates men born here, and it also decorates men born in\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland, in Germany, in Scandinavia, in France, and\r\ndoubtless in other countries also. In the field of statesmanship, in\r\nthe field of business, in the field of philanthropic endeavor, it is\r\nequally true that among the men of whom we are most proud as Americans\r\nno distinction whatever can be drawn between those who themselves\r\nor whose parents came over in sailing ship or steamer from across\r\nthe water and those whose ancestors stepped ashore into the wooded\r\nwilderness at Plymouth or at the mouth of the Hudson, the Delaware,\r\nor the James nearly three centuries ago. No fellow-citizen of ours is\r\nentitled to any peculiar regard because of the way in which he worships\r\nhis Maker, or because of the birthplace of himself or his parents, nor\r\nshould he be in any way discriminated against therefor. Each must stand\r\non his worth as a man and each is entitled to be judged solely thereby.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of having too many immigrants of the right kind. It\r\nmakes no difference from what country they come. If they are sound in\r\nbody and in mind, and, above all, if they are of good character, so\r\nthat we can rest assured that their children and grandchildren will\r\nbe worthy fellow-citizens of our children and grandchildren, then we\r\nshould welcome them with cordial hospitality.\r\n\r\nBut the citizenship of this country should not be debased. It is\r\nvital that we should keep high the standard of well-being among our\r\nwage-workers, and therefore we should not admit masses of men whose\r\nstandards of living and whose personal customs and habits are such that\r\nthey tend to lower the level of the American wage-worker; and above all\r\nwe should not admit any man of an unworthy type, any man concerning\r\nwhom we can say that he will himself be a bad citizen, or that his\r\nchildren and grandchildren will detract from instead of adding to the\r\nsum of the good citizenship of the country. Similarly we should take\r\nthe greatest care about naturalization. Fraudulent naturalization, the\r\nnaturalization of improper persons, is a curse to our Government; and\r\nit is the affair of every honest voter, wherever born, to see that\r\nno fraudulent voting is allowed, that no fraud in connection with\r\nnaturalization is permitted.\r\n\r\nIn the past year the cases of false, fraudulent, and improper\r\nnaturalization of aliens coming to the attention of the executive\r\nbranches of the Government have increased to an alarming degree.\r\nExtensive sales of forged certificates of naturalization have been\r\ndiscovered, as well as many cases of naturalization secured by perjury\r\nand fraud; and in addition, instances have accumulated showing that\r\nmany courts issue certificates of naturalization carelessly and upon\r\ninsufficient evidence.\r\n\r\nUnder the Constitution it is in the power of the Congress “to establish\r\na uniform rule of naturalization,” and numerous laws have from time\r\nto time been enacted for that purpose, which have been supplemented\r\nin a few States by State laws having special application. The Federal\r\nstatutes permit naturalization by any court of record in the United\r\nStates having common-law jurisdiction and a seal and clerk, except the\r\npolice court of the District of Columbia, and nearly all these courts\r\nexercise this improper function. It results that where so many courts\r\nof such varying grades have jurisdiction, there is lack of uniformity\r\nin the rules applied in conferring naturalization. Some courts\r\nare strict and others lax. An alien who may secure naturalization\r\nin one place might be denied it in another, and the intent of the\r\nconstitutional provision is in fact defeated. Furthermore, the\r\ncertificates of naturalization issued by the courts differ widely in\r\nwording and appearance, and when they are brought into use in foreign\r\ncountries are frequently subject to suspicion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere should be a comprehensive revision of the naturalization laws.\r\nThe courts having power to naturalize should be definitely named by\r\nnational authority; the testimony upon which naturalization may be\r\nconferred should be definitely prescribed; publication of impending\r\nnaturalization applications should be required in advance of their\r\nhearing in court; the form and wording of all certificates issued\r\nshould be uniform throughout the country, and the courts should be\r\nrequired to make returns to the Secretary of State at stated periods\r\nof all naturalizations conferred.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot only are the laws relating to naturalization now defective, but\r\nthose relating to citizenship of the United States ought also to\r\nbe made the subject of scientific inquiry with a view to probable\r\nfurther legislation. By what acts expatriation may be assumed to have\r\nbeen accomplished, how long an American citizen may reside abroad\r\nand receive the protection of our passport, whether any degree of\r\nprotection should be extended to one who has made the declaration of\r\nintention to become a citizen of the United States, but has not secured\r\nnaturalization, are questions of serious import, involving personal\r\nrights and often producing friction between this Government and\r\nforeign Governments. Yet upon these questions our laws are silent. I\r\nrecommend that an examination be made into the subjects of citizenship,\r\nexpatriation, and protection of Americans abroad, with a view to\r\nappropriate legislation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe power of the Government to protect the integrity of the elections\r\nof its own officials is inherent and has been recognized and affirmed\r\nby repeated declarations of the Supreme Court. There is no enemy of\r\nfree government more dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption\r\nof the electorate. No one defends or excuses corruption, and it would\r\nseem to follow that none would oppose vigorous measures to eradicate\r\nit. I recommend the enactment of a law directed against bribery and\r\ncorruption in Federal elections. The details of such a law may be\r\nsafely left to the wise discretion of the Congress, but it should go\r\nas far as under the Constitution it is possible to go, and should\r\ninclude severe penalties against him who gives or receives a bribe\r\nintended to influence his act or opinion as an elector; and provisions\r\nfor the publication not only of the expenditures for nominations and\r\nelections of all candidates, but also of all contributions received and\r\nexpenditures made by political committees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo subject is better worthy the attention of the Congress than that\r\nportion of the report of the Attorney-General dealing with the long\r\ndelays and the great obstruction to justice experienced in the cases\r\nof Beavers, Green and Gaynor, and Benson. Were these isolated and\r\nspecial cases, I should not call your attention to them; but the\r\ndifficulties encountered as regards these men who have been indicted\r\nfor criminal practices are not exceptional; they are precisely similar\r\nin kind to what occurs again and again in the case of criminals who\r\nhave sufficient means to enable them to take advantage of a system of\r\nprocedure which has grown up in the Federal courts and which amounts in\r\neffect to making the law easy of enforcement against the man who has\r\nno money, and difficult of enforcement, even to the point of sometimes\r\nsecuring immunity, as regards the man who has money. In criminal cases\r\nthe writ of the United States should run throughout its borders. The\r\nwheels of justice should not be clogged, as they have been clogged in\r\nthe case above-mentioned, where it has proved absolutely impossible to\r\nbring the accused to the place appointed by the Constitution for his\r\ntrial. Of recent years there has been grave and increasing complaint\r\nof the difficulty of bringing to justice those criminals whose\r\ncriminality, instead of being against one person in the Republic, is\r\nagainst all persons in the Republic, because it is against the Republic\r\nitself. Under any circumstances and from the very nature of the case it\r\nis often exceedingly difficult to secure proper punishment of those who\r\nhave been guilty of wrongdoing against the Government. By the time the\r\noffender can be brought into court the popular wrath against him has\r\ngenerally subsided; and there is in most instances very slight danger\r\nindeed of any prejudice existing in the minds of the jury against him.\r\nAt present the interests of the innocent man are amply safeguarded;\r\nbut the interests of the Government, that is, the interests of honest\r\nadministration, that is the interests of the people, are not recognized\r\nas they should be. No subject better warrants the attention of the\r\nCongress. Indeed, no subject better warrants the attention of the bench\r\nand the bar throughout the United States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlaska, like all our Territorial acquisitions, has proved resourceful\r\nbeyond the expectations of those who made the purchase. It has become\r\nthe home of many hardy, industrious, and thrifty American citizens.\r\nTowns of a permanent character have been built. The extent of its\r\nwealth in minerals, timber, fisheries, and agriculture, while great,\r\nis probably not comprehended yet in any just measure by our people. We\r\ndo know, however, that from a very small beginning its products have\r\ngrown until they are a steady and material contribution to the wealth\r\nof the Nation. Owing to the immensity of Alaska and its location in the\r\nfar north, it is a difficult matter to provide many things essential to\r\nits growth and to the happiness and comfort of its people by private\r\nenterprise alone. It should, therefore, receive reasonable aid from the\r\nGovernment. The Government has already done excellent work for Alaska\r\nin laying cables and building telegraph lines. This work has been done\r\nin the most economical and efficient way by the Signal Corps of the\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nIn some respects it has outgrown its present laws, while in others\r\nthose laws have been found to be inadequate. In order to obtain\r\ninformation upon which I could rely I caused an official of the\r\nDepartment of Justice, in whose judgment I have confidence, to visit\r\nAlaska during the past summer for the purpose of ascertaining how\r\ngovernment is administered there and what legislation is actually\r\nneeded at present. A statement of the conditions found to exist,\r\ntogether with some recommendations and the reasons therefor, in\r\nwhich I strongly concur, will be found in the annual report of the\r\nAttorney-General. In some instances I feel that the legislation\r\nsuggested is so imperatively needed that I am moved briefly to\r\nemphasize the Attorney-General’s proposals.\r\n\r\nUnder the Code of Alaska as it now stands many purely administrative\r\npowers and duties, including by far the most important, devolve upon\r\nthe district judges or upon the clerks of the district court acting\r\nunder the direction of the judges, while the Governor, upon whom these\r\npowers and duties should logically fall, has nothing specific to do\r\nexcept to make annual reports, issue Thanksgiving Day proclamations,\r\nand appoint Indian policemen and notaries public. I believe it\r\nessential to good government in Alaska, and therefore recommend that\r\nthe Congress divest the district judges and the clerks of their courts\r\nof the administrative or executive functions that they now exercise and\r\ncast them upon the Governor. This would not be an innovation; it would\r\nsimply conform the government of Alaska to fundamental principles,\r\nmaking the Governorship a real instead of a merely nominal office,\r\nand leaving the judges free to give their entire attention to their\r\njudicial duties and at the same time removing them from a great deal of\r\nthe strife that now embarrasses the judicial office in Alaska.\r\n\r\nI also recommend that the salaries of the district judges and district\r\nattorneys in Alaska be increased so as to make them equal to those\r\nreceived by corresponding officers in the United States after\r\ndeducting the difference in the cost of living; that the district\r\nattorneys should be prohibited from engaging in private practice;\r\nthat United States commissioners be appointed by the Governor of the\r\nTerritory instead of by the district judges, and that a fixed salary be\r\nprovided for them to take the place of the discredited “fee system,”\r\nwhich should be abolished in all offices; that a mounted constabulary\r\nbe created to police the territory outside the limits of incorporated\r\ntowns—a vast section now wholly without police protection; and that\r\nsome provision be made to at least lessen the oppressive delays and\r\ncosts that now attend the prosecution of appeals from the district\r\ncourt of Alaska. There should be a division of the existing judicial\r\ndistricts, and an increase in the number of judges.\r\n\r\nAlaska should have a Delegate in the Congress. Where possible, the\r\nCongress should aid in the construction of needed wagon roads.\r\nAdditional lighthouses should be provided. In my judgment, it is\r\nespecially important to aid in such manner as seems just and feasible\r\nin the construction of a trunk line of railway to connect the Gulf of\r\nAlaska with the Yukon River through American territory. This would be\r\nmost beneficial to the development of the resources of the Territory,\r\nand to the comfort and welfare of its people.\r\n\r\nSalmon hatcheries should be established in many different streams,\r\nso as to secure the preservation of this valuable food fish. Salmon\r\nfisheries and canneries should be prohibited on certain of the rivers\r\nwhere the mass of those Indians dwell who live almost exclusively on\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nThe Alaskan natives are kindly, intelligent, anxious to learn,\r\nand willing to work. Those who have come under the influence of\r\ncivilization, even for a limited period, have proved their capability\r\nof becoming self-supporting, self-respecting citizens, and ask only\r\nfor the just enforcement of law and intelligent instruction and\r\nsupervision. Others, living in more remote regions, primitive, simple\r\nhunters and fisher folk, who know only the life of the woods and the\r\nwaters, are daily being confronted with twentieth-century civilization\r\nwith all of its complexities. Their country is being overrun by\r\nstrangers, the game slaughtered and driven away, the streams depleted\r\nof fish, and hitherto unknown and fatal diseases brought to them, all\r\nof which combine to produce a state of abject poverty and want which\r\nmust result in their extinction. Action in their interest is demanded\r\nby every consideration of justice and humanity.\r\n\r\nThe needs of these people are:\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the present fee system, whereby the native is\r\ndegraded, imposed upon, and taught the injustice of law.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of hospitals at central points, so that contagious\r\ndiseases that are brought to them continually by incoming whites may\r\nbe localized and not allowed to become epidemic, to spread death and\r\ndestitution over great areas.\r\n\r\nThe development of the educational system in the form of practical\r\ntraining in such industries as will assure the Indians self-support\r\nunder the changed conditions in which they will have to live.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the office of the Governor should be extended to include\r\nthe supervision of Indian affairs, with necessary assistants in\r\ndifferent districts. He should be provided with the means and the power\r\nto protect and advise the native people, to furnish medical treatment\r\nin time of epidemics, and to extend material relief in periods of\r\nfamine and extreme destitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Alaskan natives should be given the right to acquire, hold,\r\nand dispose of property upon the same conditions as given other\r\ninhabitants; and the privilege of citizenship should be given to\r\nsuch as may be able to meet certain definite requirements. In Hawaii\r\nCongress should give the Governor power to remove all the officials\r\nappointed under him. The harbor of Honolulu should be dredged. The\r\nMarine-Hospital Service should be empowered to study leprosy in the\r\nislands. I ask special consideration for the report and recommendations\r\nof the Governor of Porto Rico.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn treating of our foreign policy and of the attitude that this great\r\nNation should assume in the world at large, it is absolutely necessary\r\nto consider the Army and the Navy, and the Congress, through which the\r\nthought of the Nation finds its expression, should keep ever vividly\r\nin mind the fundamental fact that it is impossible to treat our foreign\r\npolicy, whether this policy takes shape in the effort to secure justice\r\nfor others or justice for ourselves, save as conditioned upon the\r\nattitude we are willing to take toward our Army, and especially toward\r\nour Navy. It is not merely unwise, it is contemptible, for a nation,\r\nas for an individual, to use high-sounding language to proclaim its\r\npurposes, or to take positions which are ridiculous if unsupported by\r\npotential force, and then to refuse to provide this force. If there is\r\nno intention of providing and of keeping the force necessary to back up\r\na strong attitude, then it is far better not to assume such an attitude.\r\n\r\nThe steady aim of this Nation, as of all enlightened nations, should\r\nbe to strive to bring ever nearer the day when there shall prevail\r\nthroughout the world the peace of justice. There are kinds of peace\r\nwhich are highly undesirable, which are in the long run as destructive\r\nas any war. Tyrants and oppressors have many times made a wilderness\r\nand called it peace. Many times peoples who were slothful or timid or\r\nshortsighted, who had been enervated by ease or by luxury, or misled by\r\nfalse teachings, have shrunk in unmanly fashion from doing duty that\r\nwas stern and that needed self-sacrifice, and have sought to hide from\r\ntheir own minds their shortcomings, their ignoble motives, by calling\r\nthem love of peace. The peace of tyrannous terror, the peace of craven\r\nweakness, the peace of injustice, all these should be shunned as we\r\nshun unrighteous war. The goal to set before us as a Nation, the goal\r\nwhich should be set before all mankind, is the attainment of the peace\r\nof justice, of the peace which comes when each nation is not merely\r\nsafeguarded in its own rights, but scrupulously recognizes and performs\r\nits duty toward others. Generally peace tells for righteousness; but if\r\nthere is conflict between the two, then our fealty is due first to the\r\ncause of righteousness. Unrighteous wars are common, and unrighteous\r\npeace is rare; but both should be shunned. The right of freedom and the\r\nresponsibility for the exercise of that right can not be divorced. One\r\nof our great poets has well and finely said that freedom is not a gift\r\nthat tarries long in the hands of cowards. Neither does it tarry long\r\nin the hands of those too slothful, too dishonest, or too unintelligent\r\nto exercise it. The eternal vigilance which is the price of liberty\r\nmust be exercised, sometimes to guard against outside foes; although of\r\ncourse far more often to guard against our own selfish or thoughtless\r\nshortcomings.\r\n\r\nIf these self-evident truths are kept before us, and only if they are\r\nso kept before us, we shall have a clear idea of what our foreign\r\npolicy in its larger aspects should be. It is our duty to remember that\r\na nation has no more right to do injustice to another nation, strong\r\nor weak, than an individual has to do injustice to another individual;\r\nthat the same moral law applies in one case as in the other. But we\r\nmust also remember that it is as much the duty of the Nation to\r\nguard its own rights and its own interests as it is the duty of the\r\nindividual so to do. Within the Nation the individual has now delegated\r\nthis right to the State, that is, to the representative of all the\r\nindividuals, and it is a maxim of the law that for every wrong there is\r\na remedy. But in international law we have not advanced by any means as\r\nfar as we have advanced in municipal law. There is as yet no judicial\r\nway of enforcing a right in international law. When one nation wrongs\r\nanother, or wrongs many others, there is no tribunal before which the\r\nwrong-doer can be brought. Either it is necessary supinely to acquiesce\r\nin the wrong, and thus put a premium upon brutality and aggression,\r\nor else it is necessary for the aggrieved nation valiantly to stand\r\nup for its rights. Until some method is devised by which there shall\r\nbe a degree of international control over offending nations, it would\r\nbe a wicked thing for the most civilized powers, for those with most\r\nsense of international obligations and with keenest and most generous\r\nappreciation of the difference between right and wrong, to disarm.\r\nIf the great civilized nations of the present day should completely\r\ndisarm, the result would mean an immediate recrudescence of barbarism\r\nin one form or another. Under any circumstances a sufficient armament\r\nwould have to be kept up to serve the purposes of international police;\r\nand until international cohesion and the sense of international duties\r\nand rights are far more advanced than at present, a nation desirous\r\nboth of securing respect for itself and of doing good to others must\r\nhave a force adequate for the work which it feels is allotted to it\r\nas its part of the general world duty. Therefore it follows that a\r\nself-respecting, just, and far-seeing nation should on the one hand\r\nendeavor by every means to aid in the development of the various\r\nmovements which tend to provide substitutes for war, which tend to\r\nrender nations in their actions toward one another, and indeed toward\r\ntheir own peoples, more responsive to the general sentiment of humane\r\nand civilized mankind; and on the other hand it should keep prepared,\r\nwhile scrupulously avoiding wrongdoing itself, to repel any wrong, and\r\nin exceptional cases to take action which in a more advanced stage of\r\ninternational relations would come under the head of the exercise of\r\nthe international police. A great free people owes it to itself and to\r\nall mankind not to sink into helplessness before the powers of evil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe are in every way endeavoring to help on, with cordial goodwill,\r\nevery movement which will tend to bring us into more friendly relations\r\nwith the rest of mankind. In pursuance of this policy I shall shortly\r\nlay before the Senate treaties of arbitration with all powers which\r\nare willing to enter into these treaties with us. It is not possible\r\nat this period of the world’s development to agree to arbitrate all\r\nmatters, but there are many matters of possible difference between us\r\nand other nations which can be thus arbitrated. Furthermore, at the\r\nrequest of the Interparliamentary Union, an eminent body composed of\r\npractical statesmen from all countries, I have asked the Powers to join\r\nwith this Government in a second Hague conference, at which it is hoped\r\nthat the work already so happily begun at The Hague may be carried some\r\nsteps further toward completion. This carries out the desire expressed\r\nby the first Hague conference itself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not true that the United States feels any land hunger or\r\nentertains any projects as regards the other nations of the Western\r\nHemisphere save such as are for their welfare. All that this country\r\ndesires is to see the neighboring countries stable, orderly, and\r\nprosperous. Any country whose people conduct themselves well can count\r\nupon our hearty friendship. If a nation shows that it knows how to\r\nact with reasonable efficiency and decency in social and political\r\nmatters, if it keeps order and pays its obligations, it need fear\r\nno interference from the United States. Chronic wrongdoing, or an\r\nimpotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized\r\nsociety, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention\r\nby some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere the adherence\r\nof the United States to the Monroe Doctrine may force the United\r\nStates, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or\r\nimpotence, to the exercise of an international police power. If every\r\ncountry washed by the Caribbean Sea would show the progress in stable\r\nand just civilization which with the aid of the Platt amendment Cuba\r\nhas shown since our troops left the island, and which so many of the\r\nrepublics in both Americas are constantly and brilliantly showing,\r\nall question of interference by this Nation with their affairs would\r\nbe at an end. Our interests and those of our southern neighbors are\r\nin reality identical. They have great natural riches, and if within\r\ntheir borders the reign of law and justice obtains, prosperity is sure\r\nto come to them. While they thus obey the primary laws of civilized\r\nsociety they may rest assured that they will be treated by us in a\r\nspirit of cordial and helpful sympathy. We would interfere with them\r\nonly in the last resort, and then only if it became evident that\r\ntheir inability or unwillingness to do justice at home and abroad\r\nhad violated the rights of the United States or had invited foreign\r\naggression to the detriment of the entire body of American nations.\r\nIt is a mere truism to say that every nation, whether in America or\r\nanywhere else, which desires to maintain its freedom, its independence,\r\nmust ultimately realize that the right of such independence can not be\r\nseparated from the responsibility of making good use of it.\r\n\r\nIn asserting the Monroe Doctrine, in taking such steps as we have\r\ntaken in regard to Cuba, Venezuela, and Panama, and in endeavoring to\r\ncircumscribe the theatre of war in the Far East, and to secure the\r\nopen door in China, we have acted in our own interest as well as in\r\nthe interest of humanity at large. There are, however, cases in which,\r\nwhile our own interests are not greatly involved, strong appeal is made\r\nto our sympathies. Ordinarily it is very much wiser and more useful for\r\nus to concern ourselves with striving for our own moral and material\r\nbetterment here at home than to concern ourselves with trying to better\r\nthe condition of things in other nations. We have plenty of sins of our\r\nown to war against, and under ordinary circumstances we can do more for\r\nthe general uplifting of humanity by striving with heart and soul to\r\nput a stop to civic corruption, to brutal lawlessness and violent race\r\nprejudices here at home than by passing resolutions about wrongdoing\r\nelsewhere. Nevertheless there are occasional crimes committed on so\r\nvast a scale and of such peculiar horror as to make us doubt whether it\r\nis not our manifest duty to endeavor at least to show our disapproval\r\nof the deed and our sympathy with those who have suffered by it. The\r\ncases must be extreme in which such a course is justifiable. There\r\nmust be no effort made to remove the mote from our brother’s eye if we\r\nrefuse to remove the beam from our own. But in extreme cases action\r\nmay be justifiable and proper. What form the action shall take must\r\ndepend upon the circumstances of the case; that is, upon the degree\r\nof the atrocity and upon our power to remedy it. The cases in which\r\nwe could interfere by force of arms as we interfered to put a stop\r\nto intolerable conditions in Cuba are necessarily very few. Yet it\r\nis not to be expected that a people like ours, which in spite of\r\ncertain very obvious shortcomings, nevertheless as a whole shows by\r\nits consistent practice its belief in the principles of civil and\r\nreligious liberty and of orderly freedom, a people among whom even the\r\nworst crime, like the crime of lynching, is never more than sporadic,\r\nso that individuals and not classes are molested in their fundamental\r\nrights—it is inevitable that such a nation should desire eagerly to\r\ngive expression to its horror on an occasion like that of the massacre\r\nof the Jews in Kishineff, or when it witnesses such systematic and\r\nlong-extended cruelty and oppression as the cruelty and oppression of\r\nwhich the Armenians have been the victims, and which have won for them\r\nthe indignant pity of the civilized world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEven where it is not possible to secure in other nations the observance\r\nof the principles which we accept as axiomatic, it is necessary for us\r\nfirmly to insist upon the rights of our own citizens without regard\r\nto their creed or race; without regard to whether they were born here\r\nor born abroad. It has proved very difficult to secure from Russia\r\nthe right for our Jewish fellow-citizens to receive passports and\r\ntravel through Russian territory. Such conduct is not only unjust\r\nand irritating toward us, but it is difficult to see its wisdom from\r\nRussia’s standpoint. No conceivable good is accomplished by it. If\r\nan American Jew or an American Christian misbehaves himself in Russia\r\nhe can at once be driven out; but the ordinary American Jew, like the\r\nordinary American Christian, would behave just about as he behaves\r\nhere, that is, behave as any good citizen ought to behave; and where\r\nthis is the case it is a wrong against which we are entitled to protest\r\nto refuse him his passport without regard to his conduct and character,\r\nmerely on racial and religious grounds. In Turkey our difficulties\r\narise less from the way in which our citizens are sometimes treated\r\nthan from the indignation inevitably excited in seeing such fearful\r\nmisrule as has been witnessed both in Armenia and Macedonia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe strong arm of the Government in enforcing respect for its just\r\nrights in international matters is the Navy of the United States.\r\nI most earnestly recommend that there be no halt in the work of\r\nupbuilding the American Navy. There is no more patriotic duty before\r\nus as a people than to keep the Navy adequate to the needs of this\r\ncountry’s position. We have undertaken to build the Isthmian Canal. We\r\nhave undertaken to secure for ourselves our just share in the trade of\r\nthe Orient. We have undertaken to protect our citizens from improper\r\ntreatment in foreign lands. We continue steadily to insist on the\r\napplication of the Monroe Doctrine to the Western Hemisphere. Unless\r\nour attitude in these and all similar matters is to be a mere boastful\r\nsham we can not afford to abandon our naval programme. Our voice is now\r\npotent for peace, and is so potent because we are not afraid of war.\r\nBut our protestations upon behalf of peace would neither receive nor\r\ndeserve the slightest attention if we were impotent to make them good.\r\n\r\nThe war which now unfortunately rages in the Far East has emphasized\r\nin striking fashion the new possibilities of naval warfare. The\r\nlessons taught are both strategic and tactical, and are political as\r\nwell as military. The experiences of the war have shown in conclusive\r\nfashion that while sea-going and sea-keeping torpedo destroyers are\r\nindispensable, and fast lightly armed and armored cruisers very useful,\r\nyet that the main reliance, the main standby, in any navy worthy the\r\nname must be the great battleships, heavily armored and heavily gunned.\r\nNot a Russian or Japanese battleship has been sunk by a torpedo boat,\r\nor by gunfire, while among the less protected ships, cruiser after\r\ncruiser has been destroyed whenever the hostile squadrons have gotten\r\nwithin range of one another’s weapons. There will always be a large\r\nfield of usefulness for cruisers, especially of the more formidable\r\ntype. We need to increase the number of torpedo-boat destroyers, paying\r\nless heed to their having a knot or two extra speed than to their\r\ncapacity to keep the seas for weeks and, if necessary, for months at a\r\ntime. It is wise to build submarine torpedo boats, as under certain\r\ncircumstances they might be very useful. But most of all we need to\r\ncontinue building our fleet of battleships, or ships so powerfully\r\narmed that they can inflict the maximum of damage upon our opponents,\r\nand so well protected that they can suffer a severe hammering in return\r\nwithout fatal impairment of their ability to fight and manœuvre. Of\r\ncourse ample means must be provided for enabling the personnel of\r\nthe Navy to be brought to the highest point of efficiency. Our great\r\nfighting ships and torpedo boats must be ceaselessly trained and\r\nmanœuvred in squadrons. The officers and men can only learn their trade\r\nthoroughly by ceaseless practice on the high seas. In the event of war\r\nit would be far better to have no ships at all than to have ships of\r\na poor and ineffective type, or ships which, however good, were yet\r\nmanned by untrained and unskilful crews. The best officers and men in\r\na poor ship could do nothing against fairly good opponents; and, on\r\nthe other hand, a modern warship is useless unless the officers and\r\nmen aboard her have become adepts in their duties. The marksmanship in\r\nour Navy has improved in an extraordinary degree during the last three\r\nyears, and on the whole the types of our battleships are improving; but\r\nmuch remains to be done. Sooner or later we shall have to provide for\r\nsome method by which there will be promotions for merit as well as for\r\nseniority, or else retirement of all those who after a certain age have\r\nnot advanced beyond a certain grade; while no effort must be spared to\r\nmake the service attractive to the enlisted men in order that they may\r\nbe kept as long as possible in it. Reservation public schools should be\r\nprovided wherever there are navy-yards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWithin the last three years the United States has set an example in\r\ndisarmament where disarmament was proper. By law our Army is fixed at\r\na maximum of one hundred thousand and a minimum of sixty thousand men.\r\nWhen there was insurrection in the Philippines we kept the Army at\r\nthe maximum. Peace came in the Philippines, and now our Army has been\r\nreduced to the minimum at which it is possible to keep it with due\r\nregard to its efficiency. The guns now mounted require twenty-eight\r\nthousand men, if the coast fortifications are to be adequately manned.\r\nRelatively to the Nation, it is not now so large as the police force\r\nof New York or Chicago, relatively to the population of either city.\r\nWe need more officers; there are not enough to perform the regular\r\narmy work. It is very important that the officers of the Army should\r\nbe accustomed to handle their men in masses, as it is also important\r\nthat the National Guard of the several States should be accustomed to\r\nactual field manœuvring, especially in connection with the regulars.\r\nFor this reason we are to be congratulated upon the success of the\r\nfield manœuvres at Manassas last fall, manœuvres in which a larger\r\nnumber of Regulars and National Guard took part than was ever before\r\nassembled together in time of peace. No other civilized nation has,\r\nrelatively to its population, such a diminutive Army as ours; and while\r\nthe Army is so small we are not to be excused if we fail to keep it at\r\na very high grade of proficiency. It must be incessantly practiced;\r\nthe standard for the enlisted men should be kept very high, while at\r\nthe same time the service should be made as attractive as possible;\r\nand the standard for the officers should be kept even higher—which, as\r\nregards the upper ranks, can best be done by introducing some system of\r\nselection and rejection into the promotions. We should be able, in the\r\nevent of some sudden emergency, to put into the field one first-class\r\narmy corps, which should be, as a whole, at least the equal of any body\r\nof troops of like number belonging to any other nation.\r\n\r\nGreat progress has been made in protecting our coasts by adequate\r\nfortifications with sufficient guns. We should, however, pay much more\r\nheed than at present to the development of an extensive system of\r\nfloating mines for use in all our more important harbors. These mines\r\nhave been proved to be a most formidable safeguard against hostile\r\nfleets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI earnestly call the attention of the Congress to the need of amending\r\nthe existing law relating to the award of Congressional medals of honor\r\nin the Navy so as to provide that they may be awarded to commissioned\r\nofficers and warrant officers as well as to enlisted men. These justly\r\nprized medals are given in the Army alike to the officers and the\r\nenlisted men, and it is most unjust that the commissioned officers and\r\nwarrant officers of the Navy should not in this respect have the same\r\nrights as their brethren in the Army and as the enlisted men of the\r\nNavy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Philippine Islands there has been during the past year a\r\ncontinuation of the steady progress which has obtained ever since our\r\ntroops definitely got the upper hand of the insurgents. The Philippine\r\npeople, or, to speak more accurately, the many tribes, and even races,\r\nsundered from one another more or less sharply, who go to make up the\r\npeople of the Philippine Islands, contain many elements of good, and\r\nsome elements which we have a right to hope stand for progress. At\r\npresent they are utterly incapable of existing in independence at all\r\nor of building up a civilization of their own. I firmly believe that we\r\ncan help them to rise higher and higher in the scale of civilization\r\nand of capacity for self-government, and I most earnestly hope that in\r\nthe end they will be able to stand, if not entirely alone, yet in some\r\nsuch relation to the United States as Cuba now stands. This end is not\r\nyet in sight, and it may be indefinitely postponed if our people are\r\nfoolish enough to turn the attention of the Filipinos away from the\r\nproblems of achieving moral and material prosperity, of working for a\r\nstable, orderly, and just government, and toward foolish and dangerous\r\nintrigues for a complete independence for which they are as yet\r\ntotally unfit.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, our people must keep steadily before their minds\r\nthe fact that the justification for our stay in the Philippines must\r\nultimately rest chiefly upon the good we are able to do in the islands.\r\nI do not overlook the fact that in the development of our interests in\r\nthe Pacific Ocean and along its coasts, the Philippines have played\r\nand will play an important part, and that our interests have been\r\nserved in more than one way by the possession of the islands. But our\r\nchief reason for continuing to hold them must be that we ought in good\r\nfaith to try to do our share of the world’s work, and this particular\r\npiece of work has been imposed upon us by the results of the war with\r\nSpain. The problem presented to us in the Philippine Islands is akin\r\nto, but not exactly like, the problems presented to the other great\r\ncivilized powers which have possessions in the Orient. There are points\r\nof resemblance in our work to the work which is being done by the\r\nBritish in India and Egypt, by the French in Algiers, by the Dutch in\r\nJava, by the Russians in Turkestan, by the Japanese in Formosa; but\r\nmore distinctly than any of these Powers we are endeavoring to develop\r\nthe natives themselves so that they shall take an ever-increasing\r\nshare in their own government, and as far as prudent we are already\r\nadmitting their representatives to a governmental equality with our\r\nown. There are commissioners, judges, and governors in the islands who\r\nare Filipinos and who have exactly the same share in the government\r\nof the islands as have their colleagues who are Americans, while in\r\nthe lower ranks, of course, the great majority of the public servants\r\nare Filipinos. Within two years we shall be trying the experiment of\r\nan elective lower house in the Philippine legislature. It may be that\r\nthe Filipinos will misuse this legislature, and they certainly will\r\nmisuse it if they are misled by foolish persons here at home into\r\nstarting an agitation for their own independence or into any factious\r\nor improper action. In such case they will do themselves no good, and\r\nwill stop for the time being all further effort to advance them and\r\ngive them a greater share in their own government. But if they act\r\nwith wisdom and self-restraint, if they show that they are capable\r\nof electing a legislature which in its turn is capable of taking a\r\nsane and efficient part in the actual work of government, they can\r\nrest assured that a full and increasing measure of recognition will\r\nbe given them. Above all they should remember that their prime needs\r\nare moral and industrial, not political. It is a good thing to try the\r\nexperiment of giving them a legislature; but it is a far better thing\r\nto give them schools, good roads, railroads which will enable them to\r\nget their products to market, honest courts, an honest and efficient\r\nconstabulary, and all that tends to produce order, peace, fair dealing\r\nas between man and man, and habits of intelligent industry and thrift.\r\nIf they are safeguarded against oppression, and if their wants,\r\nmaterial and spiritual, are studied intelligently and in a spirit of\r\nfriendly sympathy, much more good will be done them than by any effort\r\nto give them political power, though this effort may in its own proper\r\ntime and place be proper enough.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile our own people should remember that there is need for the\r\nhighest standard of conduct among the Americans sent to the Philippine\r\nIslands, not only among the public servants, but among the private\r\nindividuals who go to them. It is because I feel this so deeply that in\r\nthe administration of these islands I have positively refused to permit\r\nany discrimination whatsoever for political reasons, and have insisted\r\nthat in choosing the public servants consideration should be paid\r\nsolely to the worth of the men chosen and to the needs of the islands.\r\nThere is no higher body of men in our public service than we have\r\nin the Philippine Islands under Governor Wright and his associates.\r\nSo far as possible these men should be given a free hand, and their\r\nsuggestions should receive the hearty backing both of the Executive and\r\nof the Congress. There is need of a vigilant and disinterested support\r\nof our public servants in the Philippines by good citizens here in the\r\nUnited States. Unfortunately hitherto those of our people here at home\r\nwho have specially claimed to be the champions of the Filipinos have in\r\nreality been their worst enemies. This will continue to be the case\r\nas long as they strive to make the Filipinos independent, and stop all\r\nindustrial development of the islands by crying out against the laws\r\nwhich would bring it on the ground that capitalists must not “exploit”\r\nthe islands. Such proceedings are not only unwise, but are most harmful\r\nto the Filipinos, who do not need independence at all, but who do need\r\ngood laws, good public servants, and the industrial development that\r\ncan only come if the investment of American and foreign capital in the\r\nislands is favored in all legitimate ways.\r\n\r\nEvery measure taken concerning the islands should be taken primarily\r\nwith a view to their advantage. We should certainly give them lower\r\ntariff rates on their exports to the United States; if this is not done\r\nit will be a wrong to extend our shipping laws to them. I earnestly\r\nhope for the immediate enactment into law of the legislation now\r\npending to encourage American capital to seek investment in the islands\r\nin railroads, in factories, in plantations, and in lumbering and mining.\r\n\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n  WHITE HOUSE,\r\n  _December 6, 1904_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE FOREST CONGRESS, WASHINGTON, D. C., JAN. 5, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Secretary, Gentlemen and Ladies_:\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasure to greet all of you here this afternoon, but of course\r\nespecially the members of the American Forest Congress. You have made,\r\nby your coming, a meeting which is without parallel in the history of\r\nforestry. And, Mr. Secretary, I must take this opportunity of saying\r\nto you what you so amply deserve, that no man in this country has done\r\nso much as you have done in the last eight years to make it possible\r\nto take a business view from the standpoint of all the country of just\r\nsuch questions as this. It is not many years since such a meeting as\r\nthis would have been regarded as chimerical; the thought of it would\r\nhave been regarded as absolutely chimerical. In the old pioneer days\r\nthe American had but one thought about a tree, and that was to cut it\r\ndown; and the mental attitude of the Nation toward the forests was\r\nlargely conditioned upon the fact that the life work of the earlier\r\ngenerations of our people had been of necessity to hew down the\r\nforests, for they had to make clearings on which to live; and it was\r\nnot until half a century of our national life had passed that any\r\nconsiderable body of American citizens began to live under conditions\r\nwhere the tree ceased to be something to be cleared off the earth.\r\nIt always takes time to get the mind of a people accustomed to any\r\nchange in conditions, and it took a long time to get the mind of our\r\npeople, as a whole, accustomed to the fact that they had to alter their\r\nattitude toward the forests. For the first time the great business\r\nand the forest interests of the Nation have joined together, through\r\ndelegates altogether worthy of the organizations they represent, to\r\nconsider their individual and their common interests in the forest.\r\nThis congress may well be called a meeting of forest users, for that\r\nthe users of the forest come together to consider how best to combine\r\nuse with preservation is the significant fact of the meeting, the fact\r\nfull of powerful promise for the forests of the future.\r\n\r\nThe producers, the manufacturers, and the great common carriers of the\r\nNation had long failed to realize their true and vital relation to the\r\ngreat forests of the United States, and the forests and industries both\r\nsuffered from that failure. The suffering of the industries in such\r\ncase comes after the destruction of the forests, but it is just as\r\ninevitable as that destruction. If the forest is destroyed it is only\r\na question of a relatively short time before the business interests\r\nsuffer in consequence. All of you know that there is opportunity in any\r\nnew country for the development of the type of temporary inhabitant\r\nwhose idea is to skin the country and go somewhere else. You all know,\r\nand especially those of you from the West, the individual whose idea\r\nof developing the country is to cut every stick of timber off of it\r\nand then leave a barren desert for the homemaker who comes in after\r\nhim. That man is a curse and not a blessing to the country. The prop\r\nof the country must be the business man who intends so to run his\r\nbusiness that it will be profitable for his children after him. That\r\nis the type of business that it is worth while to develop. The time\r\nof indifference and misunderstanding has gone by. Your coming is a\r\nvery great step toward the solution of the forest problem—a problem\r\nwhich can not be settled until it is settled right. And it can not\r\nbe settled right until the forces which bring that settlement about\r\ncome, not from the Government, not even from the newspapers and from\r\npublic sentiment in general, but from the active, intelligent, and\r\neffective interest of the men to whom the forest is important from the\r\nbusiness point of view, because they use it and its product and whose\r\ninterest is therefore concrete instead of general and diffuse. I do\r\nnot in the least underrate the power of an awakened public opinion;\r\nbut in the final test it will be the attitude of the industries of the\r\ncountry which more than anything else will determine whether or not\r\nour forests are to be preserved. It is because of their recognition\r\nof that prime material fact that so much has been accomplished, Mr.\r\nWilson, by those interested under you and in the other departments\r\nof the Government in the preservation of the forests. We want the\r\nactive and zealous help of every man farsighted enough to realize the\r\nimportance from the standpoint of the Nation’s welfare in the future\r\nof preserving the forests; but that help by itself will not avail. It\r\nwill not even be the main factor in bringing about the result toward\r\nwhich we are striving; the main factor must come from the intelligence\r\nof the business interests concerned, so that the manufacturer, the\r\nrailway man, the miner, the lumberman, the dealer in lumber, shall\r\nappreciate that it is of direct interest to them to preserve through\r\nuse instead of waste, the great resources upon which they depend for\r\nthe successful development of their business. This is true because by\r\nfar the greater part of all our forests must pass into the hands of\r\nforest users, whether directly or through the Government, which will\r\ncontinue to hold some of them, but only as trustee. The forest is for\r\nuse, and its users will decide its future. It was only a few years\r\nago that the practical lumberman felt that the forest expert was a\r\nman who wished to see the forests preserved as bric-a-brac, and the\r\nAmerican business man was not prepared to do much from the bric-a-brac\r\nstandpoint. Now, I think, we have got a working agreement between the\r\nforester and the business man whose business is the use of the forest.\r\nWe have got them to come together with the understanding that they must\r\nwork for a common end, work to see the forest preserved for use. The\r\ngreat significance of this congress comes from the fact that henceforth\r\nthe movement for the conservative use of the forest is to come mainly\r\nfrom within, not from without; from the men who are actively interested\r\nin the use of the forest in one way or another, even more than from\r\nthose whose interest is philanthropic and general. The difference\r\nmeans, as the difference in such a case always does mean, to a large\r\nextent the difference between mere agitation and actual execution,\r\nbetween the hope of accomplishment and the thing done. We believe that\r\nat last forces have been set in motion which will convert the once\r\ndistant prospect of the conservation of the forest by wise use into the\r\npractical accomplishment of that great end; and of this most hopeful\r\nand significant fact the coming together of this congress is the\r\nsufficient proof.\r\n\r\nI shall not pretend this afternoon to even describe to you the place\r\nof the forest in the life of any nation, and especially of its\r\nplace in the United States. The great industries of agriculture,\r\ntransportation, mining, grazing, and, of course, lumbering, are each\r\none of them vitally and immediately dependent upon wood, water, or\r\ngrass from the forest. The manufacturing industries, whether or not\r\nwood enters directly into their finished product, are scarcely, if at\r\nall, less dependent upon the forest than those whose connection with it\r\nis obvious and direct. Wood is an indispensable part of the material\r\nstructure upon which civilization rests; and it is to be remembered\r\nalways that the immense increase of the use of iron and substitutes\r\nfor wood in many structures, while it has meant a relative decrease in\r\nthe amount of wood used, has been accompanied by an absolute increase\r\nin the amount of wood used. More wood is used than ever before in our\r\nhistory. Thus, the consumption of wood in shipbuilding is far larger\r\nthan it was before the discovery of the art of building iron ships,\r\nbecause vastly more ships are built. Larger supplies of building lumber\r\nare required, directly or indirectly, for use in the construction\r\nof the brick and stone structures of great modern cities than were\r\nconsumed by the comparatively few and comparatively small wooden\r\nbuildings in the earlier stages of these same cities. It is as sure as\r\nanything can be that we will see in the future a steadily increasing\r\ndemand for wood in our manufacturing industries. There is one point I\r\nwant to speak about in addition to the uses of the forest to which I\r\nhave already alluded. Those of us who have lived on the great plains,\r\nwho are acquainted with the conditions in parts of Oklahoma, Nebraska,\r\nKansas, and the Dakotas, know that wood forms an immensely portentous\r\nelement in helping the farmer on these plains battle against his\r\nworst enemy—wind. The use of forests as windbreaks out on the plains,\r\nwhere the tree does not grow unless men help it, is of enormous\r\nimportance, and, Mr. Wilson, among the many services performed by the\r\npublic-spirited statesman who once occupied the position that you now\r\nhold, none was greater than what the late Secretary of Agriculture, Mr.\r\nMorton, did in teaching, by actual example as well as by precept, the\r\npeople of the treeless regions the immense advantage of the cultivation\r\nof trees. When wood, dead or alive, is demanded in so many ways, and\r\nwhen this demand will undoubtedly increase, it is a fair question,\r\nthen, whether the vast demands of the future upon our forests are\r\nlikely to be met. You are mighty poor Americans if your care for the\r\nwell-being of this country is limited to hoping that that well-being\r\nwill last out your own generation. No man, here or elsewhere, is\r\nentitled to call himself a decent citizen if he does not try to do\r\nhis part toward seeing that our national policies are shaped for the\r\nadvantage of our children and our children’s children. Our country, we\r\nhave faith to believe, is only at the beginning of its growth. Unless\r\nthe forests of the United States can be made ready to meet the vast\r\ndemands which this growth will inevitably bring, commercial disaster,\r\nthat means disaster to the whole country, is inevitable. The railroads\r\nmust have ties, and the general opinion is that no efficient substitute\r\nfor wood for this purpose has been devised. The miner must have timber\r\nor he can not operate his mine, and in very many cases the profit\r\nwhich mining yields is directly proportionate to the cost of timber\r\nsupply. The farmer, East and West, must have timber for numberless\r\nuses on his farm, and he must be protected, by forest cover upon the\r\nheadwaters of the streams he uses, against floods in the East, and\r\nthe lack of water for irrigation in the West. The stockman must have\r\nfence posts, and very often he must have summer range for his stock in\r\nthe national forest reserves. In a word, both the production of the\r\ngreat staples upon which our prosperity depends and their movement in\r\ncommerce throughout the United States are inseparably dependent upon\r\nthe existence of permanent and suitable supplies from the forest at a\r\nreasonable cost.\r\n\r\nIf the present rate of forest destruction is allowed to continue, with\r\nnothing to offset it, a timber famine in the future is inevitable.\r\nFire, wasteful and destructive forms of lumbering, and the legitimate\r\nuse, taken together, are destroying our forest resources far more\r\nrapidly than they are being replaced. It is difficult to imagine what\r\nsuch a timber famine would mean to our resources. And the period of\r\nrecovery from the injuries which a timber famine would entail would\r\nbe measured by the slow growth of the trees themselves. Remember that\r\nyou can prevent such a timber famine occurring by wise action taken in\r\ntime, but once the famine occurs there is no possible way of hurrying\r\nthe growth of the trees necessary to relieve it. You have got to act\r\nin time or else the Nation would have to submit to prolonged suffering\r\nafter it had become too late for forethought to avail. Fortunately,\r\nthe remedy is a simple one, and your presence here to-day is a most\r\nencouraging sign that there will be such forethought. It is the great\r\nmerit of the Department of Agriculture in the forest work that its\r\nefforts have been directed to enlist the sympathy and co-operation of\r\nthe users of wood, water, and grass, and to show that forestry will\r\nand does pay, rather than to exhaust itself in the futile attempt\r\nto introduce conservative methods by any other means. I believe\r\nmost emphatically in sentiment, but I want the sentiment to be put\r\ninto co-operation with the business interests, and that is what is\r\nbeing done. The policy is one of helpfulness throughout, and never\r\nof hostility or coercion toward any legitimate interest whatsoever.\r\nIn the very nature of things it can make little progress apart from\r\nyou. Whatever it may be possible for the Government to accomplish,\r\nits work must ultimately fail unless your interest and support give\r\nit permanence and power. It is only as the producing and commercial\r\ninterests of the country come to realize that they need to have trees\r\ngrowing up in the forest not less than they need the product of the\r\ntrees cut down that we may hope to see the permanent prosperity of both\r\nsafely secured.\r\n\r\nThis statement is true not only as to forests in private ownership,\r\nbut as to the national forests as well. Unless the men from the\r\nWest believe in forest preservation the Western forests can not be\r\npreserved. We here at the headquarters of the National Government\r\nrecognize that absolutely. We believe, we know, that it is essential\r\nfor the well-being of the people of the States of the great plains,\r\nthe States of the Rockies, the States of the Pacific Slope, that the\r\nforests shall be preserved, and we know also that our belief will\r\ncount for nothing unless the people of those States themselves wish to\r\npreserve the forests. If they do we can help materially; we can direct\r\ntheir efforts, but we can not save the forests unless they wish them to\r\nbe saved.\r\n\r\nI ask, with all the intensity that I am capable, that the men of the\r\nWest will remember the sharp distinction I have just drawn between\r\nthe man who skins the land and the man who develops the country. I am\r\ngoing to work with, and only with, the man who develops the country.\r\nI am against the land skinner every time. Our policy is consistent\r\nto give to every portion of the public domain its highest possible\r\namount of use, and of course that can be given only through the hearty\r\nco-operation of the Western people. I would like to add one word as\r\nto the creation of a national forest service which I have recommended\r\nrepeatedly in messages to Congress, and especially in my last. I wish\r\nto see all the forest work of the Government concentrated in the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. It is folly to scatter such work, as I have\r\nsaid over and over again, and the policy which this Administration is\r\ntrying to carry out through the creation of such a service is that\r\nof making the national forests more actively and more permanently\r\nuseful to the people of the West, and I am heartily glad to know\r\nthat the Western sentiment supports more and more vigorously the\r\npolicy of setting aside national forests, the creation of a national\r\nforest service, and especially the policy of increasing the permanent\r\nusefulness of these forest lands to all who come in contact with them.\r\nWith what is rapidly getting to be a practically unbroken sentiment\r\nin the West behind such a forest policy, with what is rapidly getting\r\nto be a practically unbroken support by the great stable interests\r\nbehind the general policy of the conservative use of the forests,\r\nwe have a right to feel that we have entered on an era of great and\r\nlasting progress. Only entered upon it; much, very much, remains to be\r\ndone; and as in every other department of human activity our debt of\r\ngratitude will be due, not to the amiable but shortsighted optimist\r\nwho thinks you have made a good beginning and the end may take care\r\nof itself; still less to the man who sits at one side and says how\r\npoorly the work is being done by those who are doing it; but to the\r\nmen who try, each in his own place, practically to forward this great\r\nwork. That is the type of man who is going to do the work, and it is\r\nbecause I believe that we have enlisted the active, practical sympathy\r\nof just that kind of man in this work that I believe the future of\r\nthis policy to be bright and the permanence of our timber supplies\r\nmore nearly assured than at any previous time in our history. To the\r\nmen represented in this congress this great result is primarily due.\r\nIn closing, I wish to thank you who are here, not merely for what you\r\nare doing in this particular movement, but for the fact that you are\r\nillustrating what I hope I may call the typically American method of\r\nmeeting questions of great and vital importance to the Nation—the\r\nmethod of seeing whether the individuals particularly concerned can not\r\nby getting together and co-operating with the Government do infinitely\r\nmore for themselves than it would be possible for any Government under\r\nthe sun to do for them. I believe in the future of this movement,\r\nbecause I think you have the right combination of qualities—the quality\r\nof individual initiative, the quality of individual resourcefulness,\r\ncombined with the quality that enables you to come together for mutual\r\nhelp, and having so come, to work with the Government; and I pledge you\r\nin the fullest measure the support of the Government in what you are\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH AT THE DINNER OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS, AT THE\r\nARLINGTON HOTEL, WASHINGTON, D. C., JAN. 11, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. President, Your Eminence, Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nIt is a great pleasure to have the chance of coming here this evening\r\nand saying a word of greeting to a body of men who are engaged in\r\ndoing work for this Republic which is to count, not merely in the\r\npresent generation, but during the lifetimes of many generations to\r\ncome. We hear a great deal said about true Americanism. Now the real\r\nAmerican, the American whom it is worth while to call such, is the man\r\nwhose belief in and work for America are not merely for the America of\r\nto-day, but for the America of the future.\r\n\r\nIt is a comparatively easy thing to do work when the reward is to\r\ncome in the present; but every great nation that has ever existed on\r\nthis globe has been great because its sons had in them the capacity\r\nto work for the well-being of generations yet unborn. Such a spirit\r\nis peculiarly necessary when the work that we desire to have done\r\nis essentially work of a non-remunerative type, non-remunerative in\r\nmore than one way; non-remunerative in money, and it may be in fame.\r\nWe do not know the names of the architects and builders of the great\r\ncathedrals whose magnificent beauty is an heirloom to civilization.\r\nWe do not know the names of the builders of the great majority of the\r\nworks to which every man with an aspiration after beauty naturally\r\nturns when he thinks of the past. We owe that beauty, we owe the\r\nelevation of thought, of mind and soul, that come with association and\r\nbelief in it, to the fact that there were a sufficient number of men\r\nwho worked in the spirit that Ruskin prayed for—the spirit of doing\r\nwork not for the sake of the fee, but for the sake of the work itself.\r\n\r\nThere are things in a nation’s life more important than beauty; but\r\nbeauty is very important. And in this Nation of ours, while there is\r\nvery much in which we have succeeded marvelously, I do not think that\r\nif we look dispassionately at what we have done we will say that beauty\r\nhas been exactly the strong point of the Nation. It rests largely\r\nwith gatherings such as this, with the note that is set by men such\r\nas those I am addressing to-night, to determine whether or not this\r\nshall be true of the future. A very large percentage of the durable\r\nwork, the work which is lasting, and therefore the beauty of which,\r\nif it exists, is also lasting, must be done by the Government. Many\r\ngreat buildings and beautiful buildings will be created by private\r\neffort; but many of the greatest buildings must necessarily be erected\r\nby the Government, national, State, or municipal. Those in control of\r\nany branch of that Government necessarily have but an ephemeral lease\r\nof power. Administration succeeds administration; Congress succeeds\r\nCongress; Legislature succeeds Legislature; and even if all of the\r\nadministrations, all of the Congresses, are actuated (a not necessarily\r\nprobable supposition) by an artistic spirit, it would still remain true\r\nthat there could not be coherence in their work if they had to rely\r\non themselves alone. The best thing that any administration, that any\r\nexecutive department of the Government, can do—and if I may venture\r\nto make any suggestion to the co-ordinate branch, Senator Cockrell, I\r\nwould say that the best thing that any elective legislative body could\r\ndo—is in these matters to surrender itself, within reasonable limits,\r\nto the guidance of those who really do know what they are talking\r\nabout. The only way in which we can hope to have worthy artistic work\r\ndone for the Nation or for a State or for a municipality, is by having\r\nsuch a growth of popular sentiment as will render it incumbent upon\r\nsuccessive administrations, successive legislative bodies, to carry out\r\nsteadily a plan chosen for them, worked out for them by such a body\r\nof men as that gathered here this evening. What I have said does not\r\nmean that we shall here in Washington, for instance, go into immediate\r\nand extravagant expenditures on public buildings. All that it means is\r\nthat, whenever hereafter a public building is provided for and erected,\r\nit should be erected in accordance with a carefully thought out plan\r\nadopted long before; and that it should be not only beautiful in\r\nitself, but fitting in its relations to the whole scheme of the public\r\nbuildings, the parks, the drives of the District.\r\n\r\nWorking through municipal commissions, very great progress has already\r\nbeen made in rendering more beautiful our cities, from New York to San\r\nFrancisco. An incredible amount remains to be done. But a beginning\r\nhas been made, and now I most earnestly hope that in the National\r\nCapital a better beginning will be made than anywhere else, and that\r\ncan be made only by utilizing to the fullest degree the thought and the\r\ndisinterested effort of the architects, the artists, the men of art,\r\nwho stand foremost in their professions here in the United States, and\r\nwho ask no other reward than the reward of feeling that they have done\r\ntheir full part to make as beautiful as it should be the capital city\r\nof the great Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT LUTHER PLACE MEMORIAL CHURCH, WASHINGTON, D. C., JAN. 29,\r\n1905\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. BUTLER:\r\n\r\nIt is a great pleasure to meet with you this morning and say a word of\r\ngreeting on the occasion of the rededication of this church, coming as\r\nit does almost simultaneously with the entry of your pastor into his\r\neightieth year.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint from which I am obliged so continually to look\r\nat matters, there is a peculiar function to be played by the great\r\nLutheran Church in the United States of America. This is a Church which\r\nhad its rise to power in, and, until it emigrated to this side of the\r\nwater, had always had its fullest development in the two great races of\r\nNorthern and Northern Middle Europe—the German and the Scandinavian.\r\nThe Lutheran Church came to the territory which is now the United\r\nStates very shortly after the first permanent settlements were made\r\nwithin our limits; for when the earliest settlers came to dwell around\r\nthe mouth of the Delaware they brought the Lutheran worship with them,\r\nand so with the earliest German settlers who came to Pennsylvania and\r\nafterward to New York and the mountainous region in the western part of\r\nVirginia and the States south of it. From that day to this the history\r\nof the growth in population of this Nation has consisted largely, in\r\nsome respects mainly, of the arrival of successive waves of newcomers\r\nto our shores; and the prime duty of those already in the land is\r\nto see that their own progress and development are shared by these\r\nnewcomers. It is a serious and dangerous thing for any man to tear\r\nloose from the soil, from the religion in which he and his forbears\r\nhave taken root, and to be transplanted into a new land. He should\r\nreceive all possible aid in the new land; and the aid can be tendered\r\nhim most effectively by those who can appeal to him on the ground of\r\nspiritual kinship. Therefore the Lutheran Church can do most in helping\r\nupward and onward so many of the newcomers to our shores; and it seems\r\nto me that it should be, I am tempted to say, wellnigh the prime duty\r\nof this Church to see that the immigrant, especially the immigrant of\r\nLutheran faith from the Old World, whether he comes from Scandinavia\r\nor Germany, or whether he belonged to one of the Lutheran countries of\r\nFinland, or Hungary, or Austria, may be not suffered to drift off with\r\nno friendly hand extended to him out of all the church communion, away\r\nfrom all the influences that tend toward safeguarding and uplifting\r\nhim, and that he find ready at hand in this country those eager to\r\nbring him into fellowship with the existing bodies. The Lutheran\r\nChurch in this country is of very great power now numerically, and\r\nthrough the intelligence and thrift of its members, but it will grow\r\nsteadily to even greater power. It is destined to be one of the two\r\nor three greatest and most important national churches in the United\r\nStates; one of the two or three churches most distinctively American,\r\nmost distinctively among the forces that are to tell for making this\r\ngreat country even greater in the future. Therefore a peculiar load\r\nof responsibility rests upon the members of this Church. It is an\r\nimportant thing for the people of this Nation to remember their rights,\r\nbut it is an even more important thing for them to remember their\r\nduties. In the last analysis the work of statesmen and soldiers, the\r\nwork of the public men, shall go for nothing if it is not based upon\r\nthe spirit of Christianity working in the millions of homes throughout\r\nthis country, so that there may be that social, that spiritual, that\r\nmoral foundation without which no country can ever rise to permanent\r\ngreatness. For material well-being, material prosperity, success in\r\narts, in letters, great industrial triumphs, all of them and all of the\r\nstructures raised thereon will be as evanescent as a dream if they do\r\nnot rest on “the righteousness that exalteth a nation.”\r\n\r\nLet me congratulate you and congratulate all of us that we live in a\r\nland and at a time when we accept it as natural that there should be\r\nan interdenominational service of thanksgiving, such a ceremony as is\r\nto take place this afternoon, in which the pastors of other churches\r\njoin to congratulate themselves and you upon the rebuilding of this\r\nchurch. One of the constant problems of life is to try to cultivate\r\nbreadth without shallowness, just as we want to try to cultivate depth\r\nwithout narrowness. It seems to me that thanksgiving with the combined\r\nearnestness, the liberty, of the great body of the pastors who, for\r\nour good fortune, are in the various churches of this country can be\r\naccepted as in a peculiar measure typifying the American spirit in\r\nreligious thought; that for our good fortune those men have been able\r\nto combine fervor in doing the Lord’s work with charity toward their\r\nbrethren who do it with certain differences in the non-essentials.\r\nThe forces of evil are strong and mighty in this century and in this\r\ncountry as they are in other countries, as they have been in all the\r\npast centuries; and the people who sincerely wish to do the Lord’s work\r\nwill find ample opportunity for all their labor in fighting the common\r\nenemy and in assuming toward their fellows of a different confession an\r\nattitude of generous rivalry in the effort to see how the most good can\r\nbe done to our people as a whole.\r\n\r\nI thank you for having given me the chance to speak to you this\r\nmorning, to say a word of greeting to you and to wish you Godspeed with\r\nall my heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE GRADUATING CLASS OF THE NAVAL ACADEMY AT ANNAPOLIS,\r\nMARYLAND, JAN. 30, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Captain Brownson, Members of the Graduating Class, Governor\r\n  Warfield, and to the other Midshipmen and their friends and kinsmen\r\n  here gathered together_:\r\n\r\nI fail to see how any good American can be other than a better American\r\nwhen he comes here to Annapolis and sees the Academy as it is and as\r\nit soon will be, thanks to the wise munificence of Congress; and I\r\nam not surprised that you who graduate from this institution should\r\nmake the kind of men that as a rule you do make afterward; should\r\nshow the qualities of courage, of lofty fidelity to duty, of devotion\r\nto the flag, and of farsighted preparedness to meet possible future\r\nemergencies; should show the traits which I think, Captain Brownson, I\r\ncan say without flattery, characterize the service to which you belong.\r\nI am not surprised that you should show those traits, for I should be\r\nheartily ashamed of you if you did not. More than any other people in\r\nthis country, with the sole exception of those in the sister service\r\nwho have had your advantages, you owe a peculiar fealty to the Nation\r\nwhich has trained you, which has given you a career in after life, a\r\ncareer in which, if you do your duty, you are sure to lead honorable\r\nlives, and to deserve well of the Republic; and a career in which\r\nthere is always the chance that you may spring into one of those few\r\nplaces to be occupied by the men of the Nation who win deathless fame\r\nfor themselves by the way in which they serve the Nation in the hour\r\nof the Nation’s need. On the one hand we have the right to expect a\r\npeculiar measure of self-sacrificing service from you. On the other\r\nhand we have the right to expect from the representatives of the people\r\na peculiar care for your interests. It is well that every public man\r\nshould feel under a particular obligation to see to the welfare of the\r\nArmy and the Navy. Governor Warfield, if you will pardon the personal\r\nallusion, I want to thank you for the way in which you have made\r\nevident your feeling toward this institution, for the reception you\r\ngave just the other night to these very men about to graduate. It is\r\nwell that they should understand that because of the position they hold\r\nthe Governor of the great State in which the institution is situated\r\nrecognizes their possibilities of usefulness to the country, the\r\nobligations due them, and the obligations we have a right to feel that\r\nthey will recognize to the whole Nation in return.\r\n\r\nThere are a good many baseless alarms which some worthy people feel\r\nfrom time to time in this country, and which other less worthy people\r\naffect to feel, but of all foolish crimes, of all baseless figments\r\nof a disturbed imagination, the cry of militarism in this country is\r\nthe most foolish and the most baseless. Not only there does not exist\r\nnow, but there never has existed in recent times, any nation so wholly\r\nfree as this is from any danger of excessive militarism, so wholly\r\nfree from any danger of an undue growth of the military spirit. The\r\ndanger is now, will be, and always has been, the exact reverse; the\r\ndanger is lest we do not take sufficient thought in preparing the men\r\nand material which will make our attitude in claiming to be a great\r\nnation respectable. I would be sorry to see us content to assume the\r\nposition of a nation unwilling and unable to play a great part in the\r\nworld, unable to hold its own in the shock of arms, should it be ever\r\nnecessary, which I most earnestly hope that in the lifetime of no man\r\nhere present it will be necessary. Should it ever be necessary, and I\r\nhope it will not be, to appeal to arms, I should be sorry to see us\r\ntake the position of avowed weakness, take the position that we did not\r\nintend to rank ourselves among the great powers of the earth. I should\r\nbe sorry to see that; but I would a great deal rather see that than see\r\nus insist upon taking such a position and refuse to provide the means\r\nwhich would make such a position other than a sham. If this country\r\nbelieves in the Monroe Doctrine; if this country intends to hold the\r\nPhilippines; if it intends, besides building, to police the Isthmian\r\nCanal; if it intends to do its duty on the side of civilization, on the\r\nside of law and order, and that duty can be done only by the just man\r\narmed; if this country intends to do that, then it must see to it that\r\nit is able to make good, if the necessity arises to make good. It is\r\nidle to talk of our faith in the Monroe Doctrine if we are not able\r\nto make that faith evident. It is foolish to remain permanently in the\r\nPhilippines unless we provide a base of military action for our fleets\r\nand army should it be necessary to defend the Philippines in time of\r\nwar. It is foolish to assert our position as entitled to the respect of\r\nother great nations unless we are willing to build the ships, to build\r\nthe guns, and to train the men who are to man the ships and handle\r\nthe guns if the need arises. I should be ashamed to see this Nation\r\nplay the part of a weakling. But I would rather see it play that part\r\nfrankly than see it boast what it was and then so handle itself that\r\nif any one questioned the boast we should have to retreat from the\r\nposition we assumed because we lacked the power to make our words good.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hope that our foreign policy shall be continued absolutely\r\nwithout regard to change of Administration, to change of party, along\r\nthe lines of treating every foreign nation with all possible respect,\r\nof avoiding all provocation for war, for trouble of any kind, of taking\r\nevery step possible to minimize the chance of trouble occurring; and at\r\nthe same time of taking every step possible to see to it that if by any\r\nchance trouble does occur we do not come out second best.\r\n\r\nJust at this moment, to illustrate what I mean, we have negotiated\r\ncertain arbitration treaties with the great foreign Powers. I most\r\nearnestly hope that those arbitration treaties will become part of the\r\nsupreme law of the land. Every friend of peace will join heartily in\r\nseeing that those arbitration treaties do become part of the supreme\r\nlaw of the land. By adopting them we will have taken a step, not a\r\nvery long step, but undoubtedly a step in the direction of minimizing\r\nthe chance for any trouble that might result in war; we will have in\r\nmeasurable degree provided for a method of substituting international\r\ndisputes other than that of war as regards certain subjects, and as\r\nregards the particular nations with whom those treaties are negotiated.\r\nWe can test the sincerity of those people devoted to peace largely\r\nby seeing whether this people does in effective fashion desire to\r\nhave those treaties ratified, to have those treaties adopted. I have\r\nproceeded upon the assumption that this Nation was sincere when it said\r\nthat it desired peace, that all proper steps to provide against the\r\nlikelihood of war ought to be taken; and these arbitration treaties\r\nrepresent precisely those steps. But the adoption of those treaties by\r\nthemselves would not bring peace. We are a good many years short of\r\nthe millennium yet; and for the present and the immediate future we\r\ncan rest assured that the word of the man who is suspected of desiring\r\npeace because he is afraid of war will count for but little. What we\r\ndesire is to have it evident that this Nation seeks peace, not because\r\nit is afraid, but because it believes in the eternal and immutable\r\nlaws of justice and of right living. Therefore, hand in hand with the\r\nnegotiation of treaties of that character, hand in hand with the effort\r\nto put our foreign relations with every nation on a better footing,\r\nmust go the steady upbuilding of the Army and the Navy; above all the\r\nNavy, so that our national honor may be sure of an adequate safeguard\r\nshould our national honor ever be actively menaced.\r\n\r\nI want to say a word to you boys here in particular. I am about to have\r\nthe good fortune to present a sword to the best gunner and certain\r\nmedals also for gunnery. The sword is given by the class of ’71,\r\ngiven annually, so as to put a premium upon markmanship; and, Captain\r\nBrownson, I would like through you to thank the members of that class\r\nfor the patriotic service they have done in making such a gift.\r\n\r\nThe one thing that you graduates here, and all of the others in this\r\nschool, must remember, is that you ought to bend your entire energies\r\nto fitting yourselves as you can only be fitted by the most careful\r\ntraining in advance for the possible supreme day when upon your success\r\nor your failure will depend not only whether your own lives will be\r\ncrowned with triumph or blasted with ruin, but whether the Nation will\r\nor will not write a page of glory or a page of shame on her history.\r\nThere is not one of you who is not derelict in his duty to the whole\r\nNation if he fails to prepare himself with all the strength that in him\r\nlies to do his duty should the occasion arise; and one of your great\r\nduties is to see that shots hit. The result is going to largely depend\r\nupon whether you or your adversary hits. I expect you to be brave. I\r\nrather take that for granted. It is not that you are to be commended\r\nmuch for bravery. You would be condemned forever if you lacked it. If\r\nyou lacked it in the highest form, courage physical and moral, the\r\ncourage that will assume responsibility, no less than the courage that\r\nwithout a thought will face death, that we have a right to expect\r\nfrom every one of you, and I say that you are less to be commended\r\nfor having it than to be condemned for failure to have it. But, in\r\naddition, you have got to prepare yourselves in advance. Every naval\r\naction that has taken place within the last twenty years in which our\r\nown ships have been engaged or in which any foreign ships have been\r\nengaged has shown, as a rule, that the defeated party has suffered not\r\nfrom lack of courage, but because it could not make the best use of\r\nits weapons, or had not been given the right weapons. Occasionally, of\r\ncourse, if the victor happened to be matched against people who did not\r\nshow courage, the courage counted. But I want every one here to proceed\r\nupon the assumption that any foe he may meet will have the courage. Of\r\ncourse, you have got to show the highest degree of courage yourself or\r\nyou will be beaten anyhow, and you will deserve to be; but in addition\r\nto that you must prepare yourselves by careful training so that you may\r\nmake the best possible use of the delicate and formidable mechanism of\r\na modern warship. The reason that you are trained here, the reason that\r\nyou are put through this academy, the reason that your training goes\r\non in the service is because without that training no man can hope to\r\ndo the work that is set before you to do. It is equally true that the\r\ntraining can not be given you only from without unless you actively and\r\nearnestly seek to get the best possible benefit from it yourselves;\r\nthat the best teachers, the best superiors can not supply wholly or\r\nmore than in very small part the lack of that which is within you. No\r\nother body of men of your age in our country owes so much to the United\r\nStates, to the flag that symbolizes this Nation, as you do. No other\r\nbody of young men has on the average as great a chance as each of you\r\nhas to lead a life of honor to himself and of benefit to the country\r\nat large. Deep will be your shame if you fail to rise level to your\r\nopportunities and duties, and great will be the honor that I know you\r\nwill win, because I know that, judging you by those who have gone\r\nbefore you in the service, you will rise level to your opportunities\r\nand keep untarnished the proud fame of the American officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE UNION LEAGUE CLUB, PHILADELPHIA, PA., JAN. 30, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President; and Gentlemen of the Union League_:\r\n\r\nThis club was founded to uphold the hands of Abraham Lincoln when\r\nhe stood as the great leader in the struggle for union and liberty.\r\nWe have a right, therefore, to appeal to this club for aid in every\r\ngovernmental or social effort made along the lines marked out by\r\nLincoln. The great President taught many lessons which we who come\r\nafter him should learn. Among the most important of these was the\r\nlesson that for weal or woe we are indissolubly bound together, in\r\nwhatever part of the country we live, whatever our social standing,\r\nwhatever our wealth or our poverty, whatever form of mental or physical\r\nactivity our life work may assume. Lincoln, who was, more emphatically\r\nthan any other President we have ever had, the President of the plain\r\npeople, was yet as far removed as Washington himself from the slightest\r\ntaint of demagogy. With his usual farsighted clearness of vision he\r\nsaw that in a republic such as ours permanent prosperity of any part\r\nof our people was conditioned upon the prosperity of all; and that on\r\nthe other hand any effort to raise the general level of happiness by\r\nstriking at the well-being of a portion of the people could not be but\r\nin the end disastrous to all.\r\n\r\nThe principles which Lincoln applied to the solution of the problems\r\nof his day are those which we must apply if we expect successfully\r\nto solve the different problems of our own day—problems which are so\r\nlargely industrial. Exactly as it is impossible to develop a high\r\nmorality unless we have as a foundation those qualities which give at\r\nleast a certain minimum of material prosperity, so it is impossible\r\npermanently to keep material prosperity unless there is back of it a\r\nbasis of right living and right thinking. In the last analysis, of\r\ncourse, the dominant factor in obtaining this good conduct must be\r\nthe individual character of the average citizen. If there is not this\r\ncondition of individual character in the average citizenship of the\r\ncountry, all effort to supply its place by the wisest legislation and\r\nadministration will in the end prove futile. But given this average of\r\nindividual character, then wise laws and the honest administration of\r\nthe laws can do much to supplement it. If either the business world or\r\nthe world of labor loses its head, then it has lost something which can\r\nnot be made good by any governmental effort. Our faith in the future of\r\nthe Republic is firm, because we believe that on the whole and in the\r\nlong run our people think clearly and act rightly.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, however, the great development of industrialism means\r\nthat there must be an increase in the supervision exercised by the\r\nGovernment over business enterprises. This supervision should not\r\ntake the form of violent and ill-advised interference; and assuredly\r\nthere is danger lest it take such form if the business leaders of the\r\nbusiness community confine themselves to trying to thwart the effort\r\nat regulation instead of guiding it aright. Such men as the members of\r\nthis club should lead in the effort to secure proper supervision and\r\nregulation of corporate activity by the Government, not only because it\r\nis for the interest of the community as a whole that there should be\r\nthis supervision and regulation, but because in the long run it will be\r\nin the interest above all of the very people who often betray alarm and\r\nanger when the proposition is first made.\r\n\r\nNeither this people nor any other free people will permanently tolerate\r\nthe use of the vast power conferred by vast wealth, and especially\r\nby wealth in its corporate form, without lodging somewhere in the\r\nGovernment the still higher power of seeing that this power, in\r\naddition to being used in the interest of the individual or individuals\r\npossessing it, is also used for and not against the interests of the\r\npeople as a whole. Our peculiar form of government, a Government in\r\nwhich the Nation is supreme throughout the Union in certain respects,\r\nwhile each of nearly half a hundred States is supreme in its part of\r\nthe Union in certain other respects, renders the task of dealing with\r\nthese conditions especially difficult. No finally satisfactory result\r\ncan be expected from merely State action. The action must come through\r\nthe Federal Government. The business of the country is now carried\r\non in a way of which the founders of our Constitution could by no\r\npossibility have had any idea.\r\n\r\nAll great business concerns are engaged in interstate commerce, and it\r\nwas beyond question the intention of the founders of our Government\r\nthat interstate commerce in all its branches and aspects should be\r\nunder national and not State control. If the courts decide that this\r\nintention was not carried out and made effective in the Constitution\r\nas it now stands, then in the end the Constitution, if not construed\r\ndifferently, will have to be amended so that the original undoubted\r\nintention may be made effective. But, of course, a constitutional\r\namendment is only to be used as a last resort, if every effort of\r\nlegislation and administration shall have been proved inadequate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the men in public life and the men who direct the great\r\nbusiness interests of the country should work not in antagonism but in\r\nharmony toward this given end. In entering a field where the progress\r\nmust of necessity be so largely experimental it is essential that the\r\neffort to make progress should be tentative and cautious. We must grow\r\nby evolution, not by revolution. There must be no hurry, but there must\r\nalso be no halt; and those who are anxious that there should be no\r\nsudden and violent changes must remember that precisely these sudden\r\nand violent changes will be rendered likely if we refuse to make the\r\nneeded changes in cautious and moderate manner.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment the greatest need is for an increase in the\r\npower of the National Government to keep the great highways of commerce\r\nopen alike to all on reasonable and equitable terms. Less than a\r\ncentury ago these highways were still, as they had been since the dawn\r\nof history, either waterways, natural or artificial, or else ordinary\r\nroads for wheel vehicles drawn by animal power. The railroad, which\r\nwas utterly unknown when our Government was formed and when the great\r\nprinciples of our jurisprudence were laid down, has now become almost\r\neverywhere the most important, and, in many large regions, the only\r\nform of highway for commerce. The man who controls its use can not be\r\npermitted to control it in his own interest alone.\r\n\r\nIt is not only just, but it is in the interest of the public, that\r\nthis man should receive the amplest payment for the masterful business\r\ncapacity which enables him to benefit himself while benefiting the\r\npublic; but in return he must himself recognize his duty to the public.\r\nHe will not and can not do this if our laws are so defective that in\r\nthe sharp competition of the business world the conscientious man is\r\nput at a disadvantage by his less scrupulous fellows. It is in the\r\ninterest of the conscientious and public-spirited railway man that\r\nthere should be such governmental supervision of the railway traffic\r\nof the country as to require from his less scrupulous competitors,\r\nand from unscrupulous big shippers as well, that heed to the public\r\nwelfare which he himself would willingly give, and which is of vital\r\nconsequence to the small shipper. Every important railroad is engaged\r\nin interstate commerce. Therefore, this control over the railroads must\r\ncome through the National Government.\r\n\r\nThe control must be exercised by some governmental tribunal, and\r\nit must be real and effective. Doubtless there will be risk that\r\noccasionally, if an unfit President is elected, this control will\r\nbe abused; but this is only another way of saying that any adequate\r\ngovernmental power, from the power of taxation down, can and will be\r\nabused if the wrong men get control of it.\r\n\r\nThe details must rest with the lawmakers of the two Houses of Congress;\r\nbut about the principle there can be no doubt. Hasty or vindictive\r\naction would merely work damage; but in temperate, resolute fashion,\r\nthere must be lodged in some tribunal the power over rates, and\r\nespecially over rebates—whether secured by means of private cars, of\r\nprivate tracks, in the form of damages, or commissions, or in any other\r\nmanner—which will protect alike the railroad and the shipper, and put\r\nthe big shipper and the little shipper on an equal footing. Doubtless\r\nno law would accomplish all that enthusiasts hope; there is always\r\ndisappointment over results of such a law among the oversanguine;\r\nbut very real and marked good has come from the legislation and\r\nadministration of the last few years; and now, as part of a coherent\r\nplan, it is entirely possible, and, indeed, necessary to enact an\r\nadditional law which will mean further progress along the same lines\r\nof definite achievement in the direction of securing fair dealing as\r\nbetween man and man.\r\n\r\nIn some such body as the Interstate Commerce Commission there must\r\nbe lodged in effective shape the power to see that every shipper who\r\nuses the railroads and every man who owns or manages a railroad shall\r\non the one hand be given justice and on the other hand be required to\r\ndo justice. Justice—so far as it is humanly possible to give and to\r\nget justice—is the foundation of our Government. We are not trying to\r\nstrike down the rich man; on the contrary, we will not tolerate any\r\nattack upon his rights. We are not trying to give an improper advantage\r\nto the poor man because he is poor, to the man of small means because\r\nhe has not larger means; but we are striving to see that the man of\r\nsmall means has exactly as good a chance, so far as we can obtain it\r\nfor him, as the man of larger means; that there shall be equality of\r\nopportunity for the one as for the other.\r\n\r\nWe do not intend that this Republic shall ever fail as those republics\r\nof olden times failed, in which there finally came to be a government\r\nby classes, which resulted either in the poor plundering the rich or\r\nin the rich exploiting and in one form or another enslaving the poor;\r\nfor either event means the destruction of free institutions and of\r\nindividual liberty. Ours is not a Government which recognizes classes.\r\nIt is based on the recognition of the individual. We are not for the\r\npoor man as such, nor for the rich man as such. We are for every man,\r\nrich or poor, provided he acts justly and fairly by his fellows, and if\r\nhe so acts the Government must do all it can to see that inasmuch as he\r\ndoes no wrong, so he shall suffer no wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE LINCOLN DINNER OF THE REPUBLICAN CLUB OF THE CITY OF NEW\r\nYORK, WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL, FEB. 13, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. President, and you, my Fellow-Members of the Republican Club,\r\n  and you, my Fellow-Guests of the Republican Club_:\r\n\r\nIn his second inaugural, in a speech which will be read as long as the\r\nmemory of this Nation endures, Abraham Lincoln closed by saying:\r\n\r\n  “With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the\r\n  right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish\r\n  the work we are in; ... to do all which may achieve and cherish a\r\n  just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.”\r\n\r\nImmediately after his re-election he had already spoken thus:\r\n\r\n  “The strife of the election is but human nature practically applied\r\n  to the facts of the case. What has occurred in this case must ever\r\n  recur in similar cases. Human nature will not change. In any future\r\n  great national trial, compared with the men of this, we shall have\r\n  as weak and as strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and as good.\r\n  Let us, therefore, study the incidents of this as philosophy to\r\n  learn wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs to be revenged....\r\n  May not all having a common interest reunite in a common effort to\r\n  (serve) our common country? For my own part, I have striven and shall\r\n  strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way. So long as I have\r\n  been here I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man’s bosom.\r\n  While I am deeply sensible to the high compliment of a re-election,\r\n  and duly grateful, as I trust, to Almighty God for having directed\r\n  my countrymen to a right conclusion, as I think, for their own\r\n  good, it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be\r\n  disappointed or pained by the result.\r\n\r\n  “May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in\r\n  this same spirit toward those who have?”\r\n\r\nThis is the spirit in which mighty Lincoln sought to bind up the\r\nNation’s wounds when its soul was yet seething with fierce hatreds,\r\nwith wrath, with rancor, with all the evil and dreadful passions\r\nprovoked by civil war. Surely this is the spirit which all Americans\r\nshould show now, when there is so little excuse for malice or rancor or\r\nhatred, when there is so little of vital consequence to divide brother\r\nfrom brother.\r\n\r\nLincoln, himself a man of Southern birth, did not hesitate to appeal\r\nto the sword when he became satisfied that in no other way could the\r\nUnion be saved, for high though he put peace he put righteousness\r\nstill higher. He warred for the Union; he warred to free the slave;\r\nand when he warred he warred in earnest, for it is a sign of weakness\r\nto be half-hearted when blows must be struck. But he felt only love, a\r\nlove as deep as the tenderness of his great and sad heart, for all his\r\ncountrymen alike in the North and in the South, and he longed above\r\neverything for the day when they should once more be knit together in\r\nthe unbreakable bonds of eternal friendship.\r\n\r\nWe of to-day, in dealing with all our fellow-citizens, white or\r\ncolored, North or South, should strive to show just the qualities that\r\nLincoln showed: His steadfastness in striving after the right, and\r\nhis infinite patience and forbearance with those who saw that right\r\nless clearly than he did; his earnest endeavor to do what was best,\r\nand yet his readiness to accept the best that was practicable when the\r\nideal best was unattainable; his unceasing effort to cure what was\r\nevil, coupled with his refusal to make a bad situation worse by any\r\nill-judged or ill-timed effort to make it better.\r\n\r\nThe great Civil War in which Lincoln towered as the loftiest figure\r\nleft us not only a reunited country, but a country which has the proud\r\nright to claim as its own glory won alike by those who wore the blue\r\nand by those who wore the gray, by those who followed Grant and by\r\nthose who followed Lee; for both fought with equal bravery and with\r\nequal sincerity of conviction, each striving for the light as it was\r\ngiven him to see the light; though it is now clear to all that the\r\ntriumph of the cause of freedom and of the Union was essential to the\r\nwelfare of mankind. We are now one people, a people with failings which\r\nwe must not blink, but a people with great qualities in which we have\r\nthe right to feel just pride.\r\n\r\nAll good Americans who dwell in the North must, because they are good\r\nAmericans, feel the most earnest friendship for their fellow-countrymen\r\nwho dwell in the South, a friendship all the greater because it is\r\nin the South that we find in its most acute phase one of the gravest\r\nproblems before our people: the problem of so dealing with the man of\r\none color as to secure him the rights that no one would grudge him\r\nif he were of another color. To solve this problem it is, of course,\r\nnecessary to educate him to perform the duties a failure to perform\r\nwhich will render him a curse to himself and to all around him.\r\n\r\nMost certainly all clear-sighted and generous men in the North\r\nappreciate the difficulty and perplexity of this problem, sympathize\r\nwith the South in the embarrassment of conditions for which she is\r\nnot alone responsible, feel an honest wish to help her where help is\r\npracticable, and have the heartiest respect for those brave and earnest\r\nmen of the South who, in the face of fearful difficulties, are doing\r\nall that men can do for the betterment alike of white and of black.\r\nThe attitude of the North toward the negro is far from what it should\r\nbe and there is need that the North also should act in good faith upon\r\nthe principle of giving to each man what is justly due him, of treating\r\nhim on his worth as a man, granting him no special favors, but denying\r\nhim no proper opportunity for labor and the reward of labor. But the\r\npeculiar circumstances of the South render the problem there far\r\ngreater and far more acute.\r\n\r\nNeither I nor any other man can say that any given way of approaching\r\nthat problem will present in our time even an approximately perfect\r\nsolution, but we can safely say that there can never be such solution\r\nat all unless we approach it with the effort to do fair and equal\r\njustice among all men; and to demand from them in return just and fair\r\ntreatment for others. Our effort should be to secure to each man,\r\nwhatever his color, equality of opportunity, equality of treatment\r\nbefore the law. As a people striving to shape our actions in accordance\r\nwith the great law of righteousness we can not afford to take part\r\nin or be indifferent to the oppression or maltreatment of any man\r\nwho, against crushing disadvantages, has by his own industry, energy,\r\nself-respect, and perseverance struggled upward to a position which\r\nwould entitle him to the respect of his fellows, if only his skin were\r\nof a different hue.\r\n\r\nEvery generous impulse in us revolts at the thought of thrusting down\r\ninstead of helping up such a man. To deny any man the fair treatment\r\ngranted to others no better than he is to commit a wrong upon him—a\r\nwrong sure to react in the long run upon those guilty of such denial.\r\nThe only safe principle upon which Americans can act is that of “all\r\nmen up,” not that of “some men down.” If in any community the level of\r\nintelligence, morality, and thrift among the colored men can be raised,\r\nit is, humanly speaking, sure that the same level among the whites will\r\nbe raised to an even higher degree; and it is no less sure that the\r\ndebasement of the blacks will in the end carry with it an attendant\r\ndebasement of the whites.\r\n\r\nThe problem is so to adjust the relations between two races of\r\ndifferent ethnic type that the rights of neither be abridged nor\r\njeoparded; that the backward race be trained so that it may enter into\r\nthe possession of true freedom, while the forward race is enabled to\r\npreserve unharmed the high civilization wrought out by its forefathers.\r\nThe working out of this problem must necessarily be slow; it is not\r\npossible in offhand fashion to obtain or to confer the priceless boons\r\nof freedom, industrial efficiency, political capacity, and domestic\r\nmorality. Nor is it only necessary to train the colored man; it is\r\nquite as necessary to train the white man, for on his shoulders rests\r\na wellnigh unparalleled sociological responsibility. It is a problem\r\ndemanding the best thought, the utmost patience, the most earnest\r\neffort, the broadest charity, of the statesman, the student, the\r\nphilanthropist; of the leaders of thought in every department of our\r\nnational life. The Church can be a most important factor in solving\r\nit aright. But above all else we need for its successful solution the\r\nsober, kindly, steadfast, unselfish performance of duty by the average\r\nplain citizen in his everyday dealings with his fellows.\r\n\r\nThe ideal of elemental justice meted out to every man is the ideal we\r\nshould keep ever before us. It will be many a long day before we attain\r\nto it, and unless we show not only devotion to it, but also wisdom and\r\nself-restraint in the exhibition of that devotion, we shall defer the\r\ntime for its realization still further. In striving to attain to so\r\nmuch of it as concerns dealing with men of different colors, we must\r\nremember two things.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is true of the colored man, as it is true of the\r\nwhite man, that in the long run his fate must depend far more upon his\r\nown effort than upon the efforts of any outside friend. Every vicious,\r\nvenal, or ignorant colored man is an even greater foe to his own race\r\nthan to the community as a whole. The colored man’s self-respect\r\nentitles him to do that share in the political work of the country\r\nwhich is warranted by his individual ability and integrity and the\r\nposition he has won for himself. But the prime requisite of the race is\r\nmoral and industrial uplifting.\r\n\r\nLaziness and shiftlessness, these, and above all, vice and criminality\r\nof every kind, are evils more potent for harm to the black race than\r\nall acts of oppression of white men put together. The colored man who\r\nfails to condemn crime in another colored man, who fails to co-operate\r\nin all lawful ways in bringing colored criminals to justice, is the\r\nworst enemy of his own people, as well as an enemy to all the people.\r\nLaw-abiding black men should, for the sake of their race, be foremost\r\nin relentless and unceasing warfare against law-breaking black men.\r\nIf the standards of private morality and industrial efficiency can\r\nbe raised high enough among the black race, then its future on this\r\ncontinent is secure. The stability and purity of the home is vital to\r\nthe welfare of the black race, as it is to the welfare of every race.\r\n\r\nIn the next place the white man who, if only he is willing, can help\r\nthe colored man more than all other white men put together, is the\r\nwhite man who is his neighbor, North or South. Each of us must do his\r\nwhole duty without flinching, and if that duty is national it must\r\nbe done in accordance with the principles above laid down. But in\r\nendeavoring each to be his brother’s keeper it is wise to remember\r\nthat each can normally do most for the brother who is his immediate\r\nneighbor. If we are sincere friends of the negro let us each in his own\r\nlocality show it by his action therein, and let us each show it also\r\nby upholding the hands of the white man, in whatever locality, who is\r\nstriving to do justice to the poor and the helpless, to be a shield to\r\nthose whose need for such a shield is great.\r\n\r\nThe heartiest acknowledgments are due to the ministers, the judges and\r\nlaw officers, the grand juries, the public men, and the great daily\r\nnewspapers in the South, who have recently done such effective work in\r\nleading the crusade against lynching in the South; and I am glad to say\r\nthat during the last three months the returns, as far as they can be\r\ngathered, show a smaller number of lynchings than for any other three\r\nmonths during the last twenty years. Let us uphold in every way the\r\nhands of the men who have led in this work, who are striving to do all\r\ntheir work in this spirit. I am about to quote from the address of the\r\nRight Reverend Robert Strange, Bishop Coadjutor of North Carolina, as\r\ngiven in the “Southern Churchman” of October 8, 1904.\r\n\r\nThe bishop first enters an emphatic plea against any social\r\nintermingling of the races; a question which must, of course, be left\r\nto the people of each community to settle for themselves, as in such\r\na matter no one community—and indeed no one individual—can dictate to\r\nany other; always provided that in each locality men keep in mind the\r\nfact that there must be no confusing of civil privileges with social\r\nintercourse. Civil law can not regulate social practices. Society, as\r\nsuch, is a law unto itself, and will always regulate its own practices\r\nand habits. Full recognition of the fundamental fact that all men\r\nshould stand on an equal footing, as regards civil privileges, in no\r\nway interferes with recognition of the further fact that all reflecting\r\nmen of both races are united in feeling that race purity must be\r\nmaintained. The bishop continues:\r\n\r\n  “What should the white men of the South do for the negro? They\r\n  must give him a free hand, a fair field, and a cordial Godspeed,\r\n  the two races working together for their mutual benefit and for\r\n  the development of our common country. He must have liberty, equal\r\n  opportunity to make his living, to earn his bread, to build his home.\r\n  He must have justice, equal rights, and protection before the law. He\r\n  must have the same political privileges; the suffrage should be based\r\n  on character and intelligence for white and black alike. He must\r\n  have the same public advantages of education; the public schools are\r\n  for all the people, whatever their color or condition. The white men\r\n  of the South should give hearty and respectful consideration to the\r\n  exceptional men of the negro race, to those who have the character,\r\n  the ability and the desire to be lawyers, physicians, teachers,\r\n  preachers, leaders of thought and conduct among their own men and\r\n  women. We should give them cheer and opportunity to gratify every\r\n  laudable ambition, and to seek every innocent satisfaction among\r\n  their own people. Finally, the best white men of the South should\r\n  have frequent conferences with the best colored men, where, in frank,\r\n  earnest, and sympathetic discussion they might understand each other\r\n  better, smooth difficulties, and so guide and encourage the weaker\r\n  race.”\r\n\r\nSurely we can all of us join in expressing our substantial agreement\r\nwith the principles thus laid down by this North Carolina bishop, this\r\nrepresentative of the Christian thought of the South.\r\n\r\nI am speaking on the occasion of the celebration of the birthday of\r\nAbraham Lincoln, and to men who count it their peculiar privilege\r\nthat they have the right to hold Lincoln’s memory dear, and the duty\r\nto strive to work along the lines that he laid down. We can pay most\r\nfitting homage to his memory by doing the tasks allotted to us in the\r\nspirit in which he did infinitely greater and more terrible tasks\r\nallotted to him.\r\n\r\nLet us be steadfast for the right; but let us err on the side of\r\ngenerosity rather than on the side of vindictiveness toward those who\r\ndiffer from us as to the method of attaining the right. Let us never\r\nforget our duty to help in uplifting the lowly, to shield from wrong\r\nthe humble; and let us likewise act in a spirit of the broadest and\r\nfrankest generosity toward all our brothers, all our fellow-countrymen;\r\nin a spirit proceeding not from weakness but from strength, a spirit\r\nwhich takes no more account of locality than it does of class or of\r\ncreed; a spirit which is resolutely bent on seeing that the Union which\r\nWashington founded and which Lincoln saved from destruction shall grow\r\nnobler and greater throughout the ages.\r\n\r\nI believe in this country with all my heart and soul. I believe that\r\nour people will in the end rise level to every need, will in the end\r\ntriumph over every difficulty that rises before them. I could not have\r\nsuch confident faith in the destiny of this mighty people if I had\r\nit merely as regards one portion of that people. Throughout our land\r\nthings on the whole have grown better and not worse, and this is as\r\ntrue of one part of the country as it is of another. I believe in the\r\nSoutherner as I believe in the Northerner. I claim the right to feel\r\npride in his great qualities and in his great deeds exactly as I feel\r\npride in the great qualities and deeds of every other American. For\r\nweal or for woe we are knit together, and we shall go up or go down\r\ntogether; and I believe that we shall go up and not down, that we shall\r\ngo forward instead of halting and falling back, because I have an\r\nabiding faith in the generosity, the courage, the resolution, and the\r\ncommon-sense of all my countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe Southern States face difficult problems; and so do the Northern\r\nStates. Some of the problems are the same for the entire country.\r\nOthers exist in greater intensity in one section; and yet others exist\r\nin greater intensity in another section. But in the end they will all\r\nbe solved; for fundamentally our people are the same throughout this\r\nland; the same in the qualities of heart and brain and hand which have\r\nmade this Republic what it is in the great to-day; which will make it\r\nwhat it is to be in the infinitely greater to-morrow. I admire and\r\nrespect and believe in and have faith in the men and women of the\r\nSouth as I admire and respect and believe in and have faith in the men\r\nand women of the North. All of us alike, Northerners and Southerners,\r\nEasterners and Westerners, can best prove our fealty to the Nation’s\r\npast by the way in which we do the Nation’s work in the present; for\r\nonly thus can we be sure that our children’s children shall inherit\r\nAbraham Lincoln’s single-hearted devotion to the great unchanging creed\r\nthat “righteousness exalteth a nation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE HUNGARIAN CLUB DINNER, NEW YORK CITY, FEB. 14, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. President, and you, my Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar pleasure to me to be with you this evening; and in\r\ngreeting my hosts of the Hungarian Republican Club, I give utterance\r\nto the thought of my fellow-guest, Congressman Sulzer, when I say that\r\nwhatever our differences before election, when once the election has\r\ntaken place, all of us in public life or in private life, President,\r\nCongressmen, judges, legislators, alike are American citizens and\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\nIt is nearly ten years ago that I first took dinner here in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of where I am dining now, and at that time, I\r\nremember perfectly, when I was first brought up here, it was by Mr.\r\nJacob Riis and Mr. Jim Reynolds, and I was told that I would get a\r\nvery good dinner and hear some very good music, and both prophecies\r\nproved true. It was about that time that I grew to be acquainted with\r\nso many of my hosts and fellow-guests of this evening. Others I had\r\nknown before. With one of my fellow-guests, General Grant, I was then\r\nworking, and at different times I spoke at meetings presided over\r\nor held in the clubhouses of various of the gentlemen here present,\r\nsometimes on political subjects, much more often on matters of good\r\ncitizenship affecting us all as good citizens.\r\n\r\nI grew in those years, gentlemen, to have a very close feeling of\r\nsympathy and affection and regard for the men and women of the great\r\nEast Side of this city. I needed no urging when I was invited to come\r\nand be a guest at a club of the East Side this evening. President Braun\r\nhas described how the preliminary invitation took place. It was six\r\nyears ago that this club gave me a dinner after I had been elected\r\nGovernor, and they then said that they “intended to elect me President\r\nand that I must then come and take dinner with them again.” I told them\r\nthat if they would carry out their part of the contract I would carry\r\nout my part. I am not perfectly certain that they anticipated that\r\ntheir offer would be closed with so soon, but you see, gentlemen, I\r\nhave closed with it.\r\n\r\nTo-night I wish to greet you most warmly and to say that I doubt if\r\nwe could find a more typically American gathering than this, for\r\nAmericanism is not a matter of birthplace, of ancestry, of creed, of\r\noccupation. Americanism is a matter of the spirit that is within, of a\r\nman’s soul. From the time when we first became an independent Nation\r\nto the present moment there has never been a generation in which some\r\nof our most distinguished and most useful men were not born on the\r\nother side of the Atlantic. It is peculiarly appropriate, and to me\r\npeculiarly pleasant that, in addressing this club of the men upon whose\r\nefforts so much of the future welfare of this city, of this State, of\r\nthis Nation, depends, I should be addressing men who show by their\r\nactions that they know no difference between Jew and Gentile, Catholic\r\nand Protestant, native-born and foreign-born, provided only that the\r\nman, whatever his creed, whatever his birthplace, strives to live so as\r\nto do his full duty by his neighbor and by the community as a whole.\r\n\r\nWe can not keep too clearly before our minds the fact that for the\r\nsuccess of our civilization what is needed is, not so much brilliant\r\nability, not so much unusual genius, as the possession by the average\r\nman of the plain homely workaday virtues that make that man a good\r\nfather, a good husband, a good friend and neighbor, a decent man\r\nwith whom to deal in all relations of life. We need good laws. We\r\nneed honest administration of the laws. And we can not afford to be\r\ncontented with less. But more than all else we need that the average\r\nman shall have in him the root of righteous living; that the average\r\nman shall have in him the feeling that will make him ashamed to do\r\nwrong or to submit to wrong, and that will make him feel his bounden\r\nduty to help those that are weaker, to help those especially that are\r\nin any way dependent upon him, and while not in any way losing his\r\npower of individual initiative, to cultivate the further power of\r\nacting in combination with his fellows for the common end of social\r\nuplifting and good government.\r\n\r\nI shall not keep you very long this evening. I have come here not to\r\nmake you a set speech, but if you will allow me to say so to speak as\r\nan old friend among his old friends. I have seen a good deal of your\r\nlives. I know the effort, the toil, the sorrow, the happiness, and the\r\nsuccess. I have endeavored when I have been brought in contact with the\r\nEast Side in the course of any work in which I have been engaged so to\r\nhandle myself that the East Side might be a little better for it. I do\r\nnot know whether I succeeded or not, but I do know that I have always\r\nbeen better myself for contact with it.\r\n\r\nIn closing I want to say one word upon success in life, upon the\r\nsuccess that each of us should strive for. It is a great mistake, oh,\r\nsuch a great mistake, to measure success merely by that which glitters\r\nfrom without, or to speak of it in terms which will mislead those about\r\nus, and especially the younger people about us, as to what success\r\nreally is. There must, of course, be for success a certain material\r\nbasis. I should think ill of any man here who did not wish to leave his\r\nchildren a little better off and not a little worse off materially than\r\nhe was. I should not feel that he was doing his duty by them; and if he\r\ncan not do his duty by his own children he is not going to do his duty\r\nby any one else. But after that certain amount of material prosperity\r\nhas been gained then the things that really count most are the things\r\nof the soul rather than the things of the body, and I am sure that\r\neach of you here, if he will really think of what it is that has made\r\nhim most happy, of what it is that has made him most respect his\r\nneighbors, will agree with me. Look back in your own lives; see what\r\nthe things are that you are proudest of as you look back, and you will\r\nin almost every case find that those memories of pride are associated\r\nnot with days of ease but with days of effort, with the day when you\r\nhad to do all that was in you for some worthy end, and the worthiest of\r\nall worthy ends is to make those that are closest and nearest to you,\r\nyour wife and children and those near you, happy and not sorry that\r\nyou are alive; and after that has been done to be able so to handle\r\nyourself that you can feel when the end comes that on the whole your\r\ncountry, your fellow-men are a little better off and not a little worse\r\noff because you have lived. This kind of success is open to every one\r\nof us. The great prizes come more or less by accident, and no human\r\nbeing knows that better than the man who has won any of them. The great\r\nprizes come more or less by accident, but to each man there comes\r\nnormally the chance so to lead his life that at the end of his days his\r\nchildren, his wife, those that are dear to him, shall rise up and call\r\nhim blessed, and so that his neighbors and those brought into intimate\r\nassociation with him may feel that he has done his part as a man in a\r\nworld which sadly needs that each man should play his part well.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, I have to say good-night. This has been such a\r\ndelightful dinner that I already find I am staying pretty nearly as\r\nlate as I can stay and catch the train that is to take me back to\r\nmy regular work at Washington. I thank you for your greeting, and I\r\nassure you that not one meeting which I have attended since I have been\r\nPresident has given me greater pleasure to attend than this dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, TRANSMITTING A\r\nPROTOCOL OF AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE DOMINICAN\r\nREPUBLIC, PROVIDING FOR THE COLLECTION AND DISBURSEMENT BY THE UNITED\r\nSTATES OF THE CUSTOMS REVENUES OF THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, SIGNED ON\r\nFEBRUARY 4, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate_:\r\n\r\nI submit herewith a protocol concluded between the Dominican Republic\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in the Republic of Santo Domingo have been growing\r\nsteadily worse for many years. There have been many disturbances and\r\nrevolutions, and debts have been contracted beyond the power of the\r\nRepublic to pay. Some of these debts were properly contracted and are\r\nheld by those who have a legitimate right to their money. Others are\r\nwithout question improper or exorbitant, constituting claims which\r\nshould never be paid in full and perhaps only to the extent of a very\r\nsmall portion of their nominal value.\r\n\r\nCertain foreign countries have long felt themselves aggrieved\r\nbecause of the non-payment of debts due their citizens. The only\r\nway by which foreign creditors could ever obtain from the Republic\r\nitself any guaranty of payment would be either by the acquisition of\r\nterritory outright or temporarily, or else by taking possession of the\r\ncustom-houses, which would of course in itself, in effect, be taking\r\npossession of a certain amount of territory.\r\n\r\nIt has for some time been obvious that those who profit by the Monroe\r\nDoctrine must accept certain responsibilities along with the rights\r\nwhich it confers; and that the same statement applies to those who\r\nuphold the doctrine. It can not be too often and too emphatically\r\nasserted that the United States has not the slightest desire for\r\nterritorial aggrandizement at the expense of any of its southern\r\nneighbors, and will not treat the Monroe Doctrine as an excuse for\r\nsuch aggrandizement on its part. We do not propose to take any part\r\nof Santo Domingo, or exercise any other control over the island save\r\nwhat is necessary to its financial rehabilitation in connection with\r\nthe collection of revenue, part of which will be turned over to the\r\nGovernment to meet the necessary expense of running it, and part of\r\nwhich will be distributed pro rata among the creditors of the Republic\r\nupon a basis of absolute equity. The justification for the United\r\nStates taking this burden and incurring this responsibility is to be\r\nfound in the fact that it is incompatible with international equity\r\nfor the United States to refuse to allow other powers to take the only\r\nmeans at their disposal of satisfying the claims of their creditors\r\nand yet to refuse, itself, to take any such steps.\r\n\r\nAn aggrieved nation can without interfering with the Monroe Doctrine\r\ntake what action it sees fit in the adjustment of its disputes with\r\nAmerican States, provided that action does not take the shape of\r\ninterference with their form of government or of the despoilment of\r\ntheir territory under any disguise. But, short of this, when the\r\nquestion is one of a money claim, the only way which remains, finally,\r\nto collect it is a blockade, or bombardment, or the seizure of the\r\ncustom-houses, and this means, as has been said above, what is in\r\neffect a possession, even though only a temporary possession, of\r\nterritory. The United States then becomes a party in interest, because\r\nunder the Monroe Doctrine it can not see any European power seize and\r\npermanently occupy the territory of one of these Republics; and yet\r\nsuch seizure of territory, disguised or undisguised, may eventually\r\noffer the only way in which the power in question can collect any\r\ndebts, unless there is interference on the part of the United States.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficult and increasingly complicated problems, which often\r\narise in Santo Domingo, grows out of the violations of contracts and\r\nconcessions, sometimes improvidently granted, with valuable privileges\r\nand exemptions stipulated for upon grossly inadequate considerations\r\nwhich were burdensome to the State, and which are not infrequently\r\ndisregarded and violated by the governing authorities. Citizens of the\r\nUnited States and of other Governments holding these concessions and\r\ncontracts appeal to their respective Governments for active protection\r\nand intervention. Except for arbitrary wrong, done or sanctioned by\r\nsuperior authority, to persons or to vested property rights, the United\r\nStates Government, following its traditional usage in such cases, aims\r\nto go no further than the mere use of its good offices, a measure\r\nwhich frequently proves ineffective. On the other hand, there are\r\nGovernments which do sometimes take energetic action for the protection\r\nof their subjects in the enforcement of merely contractual claims, and\r\nthereupon American concessionaries, supported by powerful influences,\r\nmake loud appeal to the United States Government in similar cases for\r\nsimilar action. They complain that in the actual posture of affairs\r\ntheir valuable properties are practically confiscated, that American\r\nenterprise is paralyzed, and that unless they are fully protected even\r\nby the enforcement of their merely contractual rights, it means the\r\nabandonment to the subjects of other Governments of the interests of\r\nAmerican trade and commerce through the sacrifice of their investments\r\nby excessive taxes imposed in violation of contract, and by other\r\ndevices, and the sacrifice of the output of their mines and other\r\nindustries, and even of their railway and shipping interests, which\r\nthey have established in connection with the exploitation of their\r\nconcessions. Thus the attempted solution of the complex problem by\r\nthe ordinary methods of diplomacy reacts injuriously upon the United\r\nStates Government itself, and in a measure paralyzes the action of the\r\nExecutive in the direction of a sound and consistent policy. The United\r\nStates Government is embarrassed in its efforts to foster American\r\nenterprise and the growth of our commerce through the cultivation of\r\nfriendly relations with Santo Domingo, by the irritating effects on\r\nthose relations, and the consequent injurious influence upon that\r\ncommerce, of frequent interventions. As a method of solution of the\r\ncomplicated problem arbitration has become nugatory, inasmuch as,\r\nin the condition of its finances, an award against the Republic is\r\nworthless unless its payment is secured by the pledge of at least some\r\nportion of the customs revenues. This pledge is ineffectual without\r\nactual delivery over of the custom-houses to secure the appropriation\r\nof the pledged revenues to the payment of the award. This situation\r\nagain reacts injuriously upon the relations of the United States with\r\nother nations. For when an award and such security are thus obtained,\r\nas in the case of the Santo Domingo Improvement Company, some foreign\r\nGovernment complains that the award conflicts with its rights, as a\r\ncreditor, to some portion of these revenues under an alleged prior\r\npledge; and still other Governments complain that an award in any\r\nconsiderable sum, secured by pledges of the customs revenues, is\r\nprejudicial to the payment of their equally meritorious claims out of\r\nthe ordinary revenues; and thus controversies are begotten between\r\nthe United States and other creditor nations because of the apparent\r\nsacrifice of some of their claims, which may be just or may be grossly\r\nexaggerated, but which the United States Government can not inquire\r\ninto without giving grounds of offence to other friendly creditor\r\nnations. Still further illustrations might easily be furnished of\r\nthe hopelessness of the present situation growing out of the social\r\ndisorders and the bankrupt finances of the Dominican Republic, where\r\nfor considerable periods during recent years the bonds of civil society\r\nhave been practically dissolved.\r\n\r\nUnder the accepted law of nations foreign Governments are within\r\ntheir right, if they choose to exercise it, when they actively\r\nintervene in support of the contractual claims of their subjects.\r\nThey sometimes exercise this power, and on account of commercial\r\nrivalries there is a growing tendency on the part of other Governments\r\nmore and more to aid diplomatically in the enforcement of the claims\r\nof their subjects. In view of the dilemma in which the Government\r\nof the United States is thus placed, it must either adhere to its\r\nusual attitude of non-intervention in such cases—an attitude proper\r\nunder normal conditions, but one which in this particular kind of\r\ncase results to the disadvantage of its citizens in comparison with\r\nthose of other States—or else it must, in order to be consistent\r\nin its policy, actively intervene to protect the contracts and con\r\ncessions of its citizens engaged in agriculture, commerce, and\r\ntransportation in competition with the subjects and citizens of other\r\nStates. This course would render the United States the insurer of all\r\nthe speculative risks of its citizens in the public securities and\r\nfranchises of Santo Domingo.\r\n\r\nUnder the plan in the protocol herewith submitted to the Senate,\r\nensuring a faithful collection and application of the revenues to the\r\nspecified objects, we are well assured that this difficult task can be\r\naccomplished with the friendly co-operation and goodwill of all the\r\nparties concerned, and to the great relief of the Dominican Republic.\r\n\r\nThe conditions in the Dominican Republic not only constitute a menace\r\nto our relations with other foreign nations, but they also concern\r\nthe prosperity of the people of the island, as well as the security\r\nof American interests, and they are intimately associated with the\r\ninterests of the South Atlantic and Gulf States, the normal expansion\r\nof whose commerce lies in that direction. At one time, and that only a\r\nyear ago, three revolutions were in progress in the island at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to state with anything like approximate accuracy the\r\npresent population of the Dominican Republic. In the report of the\r\nCommission appointed by President Grant in 1871, the population was\r\nestimated at not over 150,000 souls, but according to the Statesman’s\r\nYearbook for 1904, the estimated population in 1888 is given as\r\n610,000. The Bureau of the American Republics considers this the\r\nbest estimate of the present population of the Republic. As shown by\r\nthe unanimous report of the Grant Commission the public debt of the\r\nDominican Republic, including claims, was $1,565,831.59¼. The total\r\nrevenues were $772,684.75¼. The public indebtedness of the Dominican\r\nRepublic, not including all claims, was on September 12 last, as the\r\nDepartment of State is advised, $32,280,000; the estimated revenues\r\nunder Dominican management of custom-houses were $1,850,000; the\r\nproposed budget for current administration was $1,300,000, leaving\r\nonly $550,000 to pay foreign and liquidated obligations, and payments\r\non these latter will amount during the ensuing year to $1,700,000,\r\nbesides $900,000 of arrearages of payments overdue, amounting in all to\r\n$2,600,000. It is therefore impossible under existing conditions, which\r\nare chronic, and with the estimated yearly revenues of the Republic,\r\nwhich during the last decade have averaged approximately $1,600,000,\r\nto defray the ordinary expenses of the Government and to meet its\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\nThe Dominican debt owed to European creditors is about $22,000,000, and\r\nof this sum over $18,000,000 is more or less formally recognized. The\r\nrepresentatives of European Governments have several times approached\r\nthe Secretary of State setting forth the wrongs and intolerable delays\r\nto which they have been subjected at the hands of the successive\r\nGovernments of Santo Domingo in the collection of their just claims,\r\nand intimating that unless the Dominican Government should receive\r\nsome assistance from the United States in the way of regulating its\r\nfinances, the creditor Governments in Europe would be forced to resort\r\nto more effective measures of compulsion to secure the satisfaction of\r\ntheir claims.\r\n\r\nIf the United States Government declines to take action and other\r\nforeign Governments resort to action to secure payment of their claims,\r\nthe latter would be entitled, according to the decision of The Hague\r\ntribunal in the Venezuelan cases, to the preferential payment of\r\ntheir claims; and this would absorb all the Dominican revenues and\r\nwould be a virtual sacrifice of American claims and interests in the\r\nisland. If moreover, any such action should be taken by them, the only\r\nmethod to enable them to secure the payment of their claims would be\r\nto take possession of the custom-houses, and considering the state of\r\nthe Dominican finances this would mean a definite and very possibly\r\npermanent occupation of Dominican territory, for no period could be\r\nset to the time which would be necessarily required for the payment of\r\ntheir obligations and unliquidated claims. The United States Government\r\ncould not interfere to prevent such seizure and occupation of Dominican\r\nterritory without either itself proposing some feasible alternative in\r\nthe way of action, or else virtually saying to European Governments\r\nthat they would not be allowed to collect their claims. This would be\r\nan unfortunate attitude for the Government of the United States to be\r\nforced to maintain at present. It can not with propriety say that it\r\nwill protect its own citizens and interests, on the one hand, and yet\r\non the other hand refuse to allow other Governments to protect their\r\ncitizens and interests.\r\n\r\nThe actual situation in the Dominican Republic can not, perhaps, be\r\nmore forcibly stated than by giving a brief account of the case of the\r\nSanto Domingo Improvement Company.\r\n\r\nFrom 1869 to 1897 the Dominican Government issued successive series of\r\nbonds, the majority of which were in the hands of European holders.\r\nSuccessive issues bore interest at rates ranging from 2¾ to 6 per cent,\r\nand what with commissions and other deductions and the heavy discount\r\nin the market the Government probably did not receive over 50 to 75 per\r\ncent of their nominal value. Other portions of the debt were created by\r\nloans, for which the Government received only one-half of the amount\r\nit was nominally to repay, and these obligations bore interest at the\r\nrate of 1 to 2 per cent a month on their face, some of them compounded\r\nmonthly.\r\n\r\nThe improvidence of the Government in its financial management was due\r\nto its weakness, to its impaired credit, and to its pecuniary needs\r\noccasioned by frequent insurrections and revolutionary changes, and by\r\nits inability to collect its revenues.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the Government, in order to secure the payment of an issue\r\nof bonds, placed the custom-houses and the collection of its customs\r\nduties, which are substantially the only revenues of the Republic, in\r\nthe hands of the Westendorps, bankers of Amsterdam, Holland. But the\r\nnational debt continued to grow and the Government finally intrusted\r\nthe collection of its revenues to an American corporation, the Santo\r\nDomingo Improvement Company, which was to take over the bonds of the\r\nWestendorps. The Dominican Government finally became dissatisfied\r\nwith this arrangement, and, in 1901, ousted the Improvement Company\r\nfrom its custom-houses and took into its own hands the collection of\r\nits revenues. The company thereupon appealed to the United States\r\nGovernment to maintain them in their position, but their request was\r\nrefused. The Dominican Government then sent its minister of foreign\r\naffairs to Washington to negotiate a settlement. He admitted that the\r\nImprovement Company had equities which ought not to be disregarded,\r\nand the Department of State suggested that the Dominican Government\r\nand the Improvement Company should effect, by private negotiation, a\r\nsatisfactory settlement between them. They accordingly entered into an\r\narrangement for a settlement, which was mutually satisfactory to the\r\nparties. A similar arrangement was likewise made between the Dominican\r\nGovernment and the European bondholders. The latter arrangement was\r\ncarried into execution by the Dominican Government and payments made\r\ntoward the liquidation of the bonds held by the European holders. The\r\nDominican Congress refused to ratify the similar arrangement made with\r\nthe Improvement Company, and the Government refused to provide for the\r\npayment of the American claimants. In this state of the case it was\r\nevident that a continuance of this treatment of the American creditors,\r\nand its repetition in other cases, would, if allowed to run its course,\r\nresult in handing over the island to European creditors, and in time\r\nwould ripen into serious controversies between the United States and\r\nother Governments, unless the United States should deliberately and\r\nfinally abandon its interests in the island.\r\n\r\nThe Improvement Company and its allied companies held, besides bonds,\r\ncertain banking and railway interests in the island. The Dominican\r\nGovernment, desirous to own and possess these properties, agreed\r\nwith the companies that the value of their bonds and properties was\r\n$4,500,000, and they submitted to arbitration the question as to the\r\ninstalments in which this sum should be paid and the security that\r\nshould be given. The Hon. George Gray, judge of the United States\r\nCircuit Court of Appeals, and the Hon. Manuel de J. Galvan, both named\r\nby the Dominican Republic, and the Hon. John G. Carlisle, named by\r\nthe United States, were the arbitrators, and rendered their award\r\non July 14, 1904. By its terms the Dominican Government was to pay\r\nthe above-mentioned sum of $4,500,000, with 4 per cent interest per\r\nannum, in monthly instalments of $37,500 each during two years and\r\nof $41,666.66 each month thereafter, beginning with the month of\r\nSeptember, 1904, said award to be secured by the customs revenues and\r\nport dues of all the ports on the northern coast of Santo Domingo.\r\nThe award further provides for the appointment of a financial agent\r\nof the United States, who was authorized, in case of failure during\r\nany month to receive the sum then due, to enter into possession of\r\nthe custom-house at Puerto Plata in the first instance and assume\r\ncharge of the collection of customs duties and port dues, and to fix\r\nand determine these duties and dues and secure their payment; in case\r\nthe sums collected at Puerto Plata should at any time be insufficient\r\nfor the payment of the amounts due under the award, or in case of any\r\nother manifest necessity, or in case the Dominican Government should\r\nso request, the financial agent of the United States was authorized to\r\nhave and exercise at any and all of the other ports above described\r\nall the rights and powers vested in him by the award in respect of\r\nPuerto Plata. Under the award the financial agent could only apply\r\nthe revenues collected toward its payment after he had first paid the\r\nexpenses of collection and certain other obligations styled “aparods,”\r\nwhich constituted prior charges on the revenues assigned. These prior\r\ncharges are specified in the award. The Dominican Government defaulted\r\nin their payments; and in virtue of the award and the authority\r\nconferred by the Dominican Government, and at its request, possession\r\nwas delivered of the custom-house of Puerto Plata to the fiscal agent\r\nappointed by the United States to collect the revenues assigned by the\r\narbitrators for the payment of the award; and in virtue of the same\r\nauthority possession of the custom-house of Monte Cristi has also\r\nbeen handed over. I submit herewith a report of Mr. John B. Moore,\r\nagent of the United States in this case, and a copy of the award of the\r\narbitrators.\r\n\r\nDuring the past two years the European claimants except the English,\r\nwhose interests were embraced in those of the American companies, have,\r\nwith the support of their respective Governments, been growing more and\r\nmore importunate in pressing their unsatisfied demands. The French and\r\nthe Belgians, in 1901, had entered into a contract with the Dominican\r\nGovernment, but, after a few payments were made on account, it fell\r\ninto neglect. Other Governments also obliged the Dominican Government\r\nto enter into arrangements of various kinds by which the revenues of\r\nthe Republic were in large part sequestrated, and under one of the\r\nagreements, which was concluded with Italy in 1903, the minister of\r\nthat Government was empowered directly to collect from the importers\r\nand exporters that portion of the customs revenues assigned to him as\r\nsecurity. As the result of chronic disorders attended with a constant\r\nincrease of debt, the state of things in Santo Domingo has become\r\nhopeless, unless the United States or some other strong Government\r\nshall interpose to bring order out of the chaos. The custom-houses,\r\nwith the exception of the two in the possession of the financial\r\nagent appointed by the United States, have become unproductive for\r\nthe discharge of indebtedness, except as to persons making emergency\r\nloans to the Government or to its enemies for the purpose of carrying\r\non political contests by force. They have, in fact, become the nuclei\r\nof the various revolutions. The first effort of revolutionists is to\r\ntake possession of a custom-house so as to obtain funds, which are then\r\ndisposed of at the absolute discretion of those who are collecting\r\nthem. The chronic disorders prevailing in Santo Domingo have, moreover,\r\nbecome exceedingly dangerous to the interests of Americans holding\r\nproperty in that country. Constant complaints have been received of\r\nthe injuries and inconveniences to which they have been subjected. As\r\nan evidence of the increasing aggravation of conditions, the fact may\r\nbe mentioned that about a year ago the American railway, which had\r\npreviously been exempt from such attacks, was seized, its tracks torn\r\nup, and a station destroyed by revolutionary bands.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary resources of diplomacy and international arbitration are\r\nabsolutely impotent to deal wisely and effectively with the situation\r\nin the Dominican Republic, which can only be met by organizing its\r\nfinances on a sound basis and by placing the custom-houses beyond the\r\ntemptation of insurgent chieftains. Either we must abandon our duty\r\nunder our traditional policy toward the Dominican people, who aspire to\r\na republican form of government while they are actually drifting into a\r\ncondition of permanent anarchy, in which case we must permit some other\r\nGovernment to adopt its own measures in order to safeguard its own\r\ninterests, or else we must ourselves take seasonable and appropriate\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAgain and again has the Dominican Government invoked on its own behalf\r\nthe aid of the United States. It has repeatedly done so of recent\r\nyears. In 1899 it sought to enter into treaty relations by which it\r\nwould be placed under the protection of the United States Government.\r\nThe request was refused. Again in January, 1904, its minister of\r\nforeign affairs visited Washington and besought the help of the United\r\nStates Government to enable it to escape from its financial and social\r\ndisorders. Compliance with this request was again declined, for this\r\nGovernment has been most reluctant to interfere in any way, and has\r\nfinally concluded to take action only because it has become evident\r\nthat failure to do so may result in a situation fraught with grave\r\ndanger to the cause of international peace.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 a representative of a foreign Government proposed to the\r\nUnited States the joint fiscal control of the Dominican Republic by\r\ncertain creditor nations, and that the latter should take charge of\r\nthe custom-houses and revenues and give to the Dominican Government\r\na certain percentage and apply the residue to the payment ratably of\r\nclaims of foreign creditors. The United States Government declined to\r\napprove or to enter into such an arrangement. But it has now become\r\nevident that decided action of some kind can not be much longer\r\ndelayed. In view of our past experience and our knowledge of the\r\nactual situation of the Dominican Republic, a definite refusal of the\r\nUnited States Government to take any effective action looking to the\r\nrelief of the Dominican Republic and to the discharge of its own duty\r\nunder the Monroe Doctrine can only be considered as an acquiescence in\r\nsome such action by another Government.\r\n\r\nThat most wise measure of international statesmanship, the Platt\r\namendment, has provided a method for preventing such difficulties from\r\narising in the new Republic of Cuba. In accordance with the terms of\r\nthis amendment the Republic of Cuba can not issue any bonds which can\r\nbe collected from Cuba save as a matter of grace, unless with the\r\nconsent of the United States, which is at liberty at all times to take\r\nmeasures to prevent the violation of the letter and spirit of the Platt\r\namendment. If a similar plan could now be entered upon by the Dominican\r\nRepublic, it would undoubtedly be of great advantage to them and to all\r\nother peoples, for under such an arrangement no larger debt would be\r\nincurred than could be honestly paid, and those who took debts not thus\r\nauthorized would, by the mere fact of taking them, put themselves in\r\nthe category of speculators or gamblers, who deserved no consideration\r\nand who would be permitted to receive none; so that the honest creditor\r\nwould on the one hand be safe, while on the other hand the Republic\r\nwould be safeguarded against molestation in the interest of mere\r\nspeculators.\r\n\r\nBut no such plan at present exists; and under existing circumstances,\r\nwhen the condition of affairs becomes such as it has become in Santo\r\nDomingo, either we must submit to the likelihood of infringement of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine or we must ourselves agree to some such arrangement\r\nas that herewith submitted to the Senate. In this case, fortunately,\r\nthe prudent and far-seeing statesmanship of the Dominican Government\r\nhas relieved us of all trouble. At their request we have entered into\r\nthe agreement herewith submitted. Under it the custom-houses will be\r\nadministered peacefully, honestly, and economically, 45 per cent of\r\nthe proceeds being turned over to the Dominican Government and the\r\nremainder being used by the United States to pay what proportion of the\r\ndebts it is possible to pay on an equitable basis. The Republic will\r\nbe secured against over-seas aggression. This in reality entails no\r\nnew obligation upon us, for the Monroe Doctrine means precisely such a\r\nguarantee on our part.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps unnecessary to state that no step of any kind has been\r\ntaken by the Administration under the terms of the protocol which is\r\nherewith submitted.\r\n\r\nThe Republic of Santo Domingo has by this protocol wisely and\r\npatriotically accepted the responsibilities as well as the privileges\r\nof liberty, and is showing with evident good faith its purpose to pay\r\nall that its resources will permit of its obligations. More than this\r\nit can not do, and when it has done this we should not permit it to be\r\nmolested. We on our part are simply performing in peaceful manner,\r\nnot only with the cordial acquiescence, but in accordance with the\r\nearnest request of the Government concerned, part of that international\r\nduty which is necessarily involved in the assertion of the Monroe\r\nDoctrine. We are bound to show that we perform this duty in good faith\r\nand without any intention of aggrandizing ourselves at the expense of\r\nour weaker neighbors or of conducting ourselves otherwise than so as\r\nto benefit both these weaker neighbors and those European Powers which\r\nmay be brought into contact with them. It is in the highest degree\r\nnecessary that we should prove by our action that the world may trust\r\nin our good faith and may understand that this international duty will\r\nbe performed by us within our own sphere, in the interest not merely\r\nof ourselves, but of all other nations, and with strict justice toward\r\nall. If this is done a general acceptance of the Monroe Doctrine\r\nwill in the end surely follow; and this will mean an increase of the\r\nsphere in which peaceful measures for the settlement of international\r\ndifficulties gradually displace those of a warlike character.\r\n\r\nWe can point with just pride to what we have done in Cuba as a guaranty\r\nof our good faith. We stayed in Cuba only so long as to start her\r\naright on the road to self-government, which she has since trod with\r\nsuch marked and distinguished success; and upon leaving the island\r\nwe exacted no conditions save such as would prevent her from ever\r\nbecoming the prey of the stranger. Our purpose in Santo Domingo is as\r\nbeneficent. The good that this country got from its action in Cuba was\r\nindirect rather than direct. So it is as regards Santo Domingo. The\r\nchief material advantage that will come from the action proposed to be\r\ntaken will be to Santo Domingo itself and to Santo Domingo’s creditors.\r\nThe advantages that will come to the United States will be indirect,\r\nbut nevertheless great, for it is supremely to our interest that all\r\nthe communities immediately south of us should be or become prosperous\r\nand stable, and therefore not merely in name but in fact independent\r\nand self-governing.\r\n\r\nI call attention to the urgent need of prompt action on this matter.\r\nWe now have a great opportunity to secure peace and stability in the\r\nisland, without friction or bloodshed, by acting in accordance with\r\nthe cordial invitation of the governmental authorities themselves.\r\nIt will be unfortunate from every standpoint if we fail to grasp\r\nthis opportunity; for such failure will probably mean increasing\r\nrevolutionary violence in Santo Domingo, and very possibly embarrassing\r\nforeign complications in addition. This protocol affords a practical\r\ntest of the efficiency of the United States Government in maintaining\r\nthe Monroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\n                                                    THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\nWHITE HOUSE,\r\n_February 15, 1905_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA, PA., FEB. 22,\r\n1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Provost, Members of the University, and my Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nAs a Nation we have had our full share of great men, but the two men\r\nof pre-eminent greatness who, as the centuries go on, will surely loom\r\nabove all others are Washington and Lincoln; and it is peculiarly\r\nfitting that their birthdays should be celebrated every year and the\r\nmeaning of their lives brought home close to us.\r\n\r\nNo other city in the country is so closely identified with Washington’s\r\ncareer as Philadelphia. He served here in 1775 in the Continental\r\nCongress. He was here as commander of the Army at the time of the\r\nbattles of Brandywine and Germantown; and it was near here that with\r\nthat army he faced the desolate winter at Valley Forge, the winter\r\nwhich marked the turning point of the Revolutionary War. Here he came\r\nagain as President of the Convention which framed the Constitution,\r\nand then as President of the United States, and finally as\r\nLieutenant-General of the Army after he had retired from the Presidency.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and eight years ago, just before he left the Presidency, he\r\nissued his farewell address, and in it he laid down certain principles\r\nwhich he believed should guide the citizens of this Republic for all\r\ntime to come, his own words being “which appear to me all-important to\r\nthe permanency of your felicity as a people.”\r\n\r\nWashington, though in some ways an even greater man than Lincoln, did\r\nnot have Lincoln’s wonderful gift of expression—that gift which makes\r\ncertain speeches of the rail-splitter from Illinois read like the\r\ninspired utterances of the great Hebrew seers and prophets. But he had\r\nall of Lincoln’s sound common-sense, farsightedness, and devotion to a\r\nlofty ideal. Like Lincoln he sought after the noblest objects, and like\r\nLincoln he sought after them by thoroughly practical methods. These two\r\ngreatest Americans can fairly be called the best among the great men of\r\nthe world, and greatest among the good men of the world. Each showed in\r\nactual practice his capacity to secure under our system the priceless\r\nunion of individual liberty with governmental strength. Each was as\r\nfree from the vices of the tyrant as from the vices of the demagogue.\r\nTo each the empty futility of the mere doctrinaire was as alien as the\r\nbaseness of the merely self-seeking politician. Each was incapable\r\nalike of the wickedness which seeks by force of arms to wrong others\r\nand of the no less criminal weakness which fails to provide effectively\r\nagainst being wronged by others.\r\n\r\nAmong Washington’s maxims which he bequeathed to his countrymen were\r\nthe two following: “Observe good faith and justice toward all nations,”\r\nand “To be prepared for war is the most effective means to promote\r\npeace.” These two principles taken together should form the basis of\r\nour whole foreign policy. Neither is sufficient taken by itself. It is\r\nnot merely an idle dream, but a most mischievous dream, to believe that\r\nmere refraining from wrongdoing will ensure us against being wronged.\r\nYet, on the other hand, a nation prepared for war is a menace to\r\nmankind unless the national purpose is to treat other nations with good\r\nfaith and justice. In any community it is neither the conscientious man\r\nwho is a craven at heart, nor yet the bold and strong man without the\r\nmoral sense, who is of real use to the community; it is the man who to\r\nstrength and courage adds a realizing sense of the moral obligation\r\nresting upon him, the man who has not only the desire but the power to\r\ndo his full duty by his neighbor and by the State. So, in the world at\r\nlarge, the nation which is of use in the progress of mankind is that\r\nnation which combines strength of character, force of character, and\r\ninsistence upon its own rights, with a full acknowledgment of its own\r\nduties toward others. Just at present the best way in which we can\r\nshow that our loyalty to the teachings of Washington is a loyalty of\r\nthe heart and not of the lips only is to see to it that the work of\r\nbuilding up our Navy goes steadily on, and that at the same time our\r\nstand for international righteousness is clear and emphatic.\r\n\r\nNever since the beginning of our country’s history has the Navy\r\nbeen used in an unjust war. Never has it failed to render great and\r\nsometimes vital service to the Republic. It has not been too strong\r\nfor our good, though often not strong enough to do all the good it\r\nshould have done. Our possession of the Philippines, our interest\r\nin the trade of the Orient, our building the Isthmian Canal, our\r\ninsistence upon the Monroe Doctrine, all demand that our Navy shall\r\nbe of adequate size and for its size of unsurpassed efficiency. If it\r\nis strong enough I believe it will minimize the chance of our being\r\ndrawn into foreign war. If we let it run down it is as certain as the\r\nday that sooner or later we shall have to choose between a probably\r\ndisastrous foreign war or a peace kept on terms that imply national\r\nhumiliation. Our Navy is the surest guaranty of peace and the cheapest\r\ninsurance against war, and those who, in whatever capacity, have helped\r\nto build it up during the past twenty years have been in good faith\r\nobserving and living up to one of the most important of the principles\r\nwhich Washington laid down for the guidance of his countrymen. Nor was\r\nWashington the only one of our great Presidents who showed farsighted\r\npatriotism by support of the Navy. When Andrew Jackson was in Congress\r\nhe voted for the first warships we ever built as part of our regular\r\nNavy; and he voted against the grant of money to pay our humiliating\r\ntribute to the pirates of the Barbary States. Old Hickory was a patriot\r\nthrough and through, and there was not an ounce of timidity in his\r\nnature, and of course he felt only indignant contempt for a policy\r\nwhich purchased an ignoble peace by cowardice instead of exacting\r\na just peace by showing we were as little willing to submit to as\r\nto inflict aggression. Had a majority of Jackson’s colleagues and\r\nsuccessors felt as he did about the Navy, had it been built up instead\r\nof being brought to a standstill, it would probably never have been\r\nnecessary to fight the War of 1812.\r\n\r\nAgain Washington said: “Give to mankind the example of a people always\r\nguided by an exalted justice and benevolence.” This feeling can be\r\nshown alike by our dealings within and without our own borders. Taft\r\nand Wright in the Philippines and Wood in Cuba have shown us exactly\r\nhow to practice this justice and benevolence in dealing with other\r\npeoples—a justice and benevolence which can be shown, not by shirking\r\nour duty and abandoning to self-destruction those unfit to govern\r\nthemselves, but by doing our duty by staying with them and teaching\r\nthem how to govern themselves, by uplifting them spiritually and\r\nmaterially. Here at home we are obeying this maxim of Washington’s\r\njust so far as we help in every movement, whether undertaken by the\r\nGovernment, or as is, and should be, more often the case, by voluntary\r\naction among private citizens, for the betterment of our own people.\r\nObserve that Washington speaks both of justice and benevolence, and\r\nthat he puts justice first. We must be generous, we must help our\r\npoorer brother, but above all, we must remember to be just; and the\r\nfirst step toward securing justice is to treat every man on his worth\r\nas a man, showing him no special favor, but so far as may be holding\r\nopen for him the door of opportunity so that reward may wait upon\r\nhonest and intelligent endeavor.\r\n\r\nAgain Washington said: “Cherish public credit.” Just at the moment\r\nthere is no attack on public credit, but if ever the temptation arises\r\nagain let our people at the outset remember that the worst because the\r\nmost insidious form of the appeal that would make a man a dishonest\r\ndebtor is that which would persuade him that it is anything but\r\ndishonest for him to repudiate his debts.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is peculiarly appropriate, when I have come to this city\r\nas the guest of the University of Pennsylvania, to quote another of\r\nWashington’s maxims: “Promote, as an object of primary importance,\r\ninstitutions for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as\r\nthe structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is\r\nessential that public opinion should be enlightened.” Education may\r\nnot make a man a good citizen, but most certainly ignorance tends to\r\nprevent his being a good citizen. Washington was far too much of a\r\npatriot, had far too much love for his fellow-citizens, to try to teach\r\nthem that they could govern themselves unless they could develop a\r\nsound and enlightened public opinion. No nation can permanently retain\r\nfree government unless it can retain a high average of citizenship;\r\nand there can be no such high average of citizenship without a high\r\naverage of education, using the word in its broadest and truest\r\nsense to include the things of the soul as well as the things of\r\nthe mind. School education can never supplant or take the place of\r\nself-education, still less can it in any way take the place of those\r\nrugged and manly qualities which we group together under the name\r\nof character; but it can be of enormous use in supplementing both.\r\nIt is a source of just pride to every American that our people have\r\nso consistently acted in accordance with Washington’s principle of\r\npromoting institutions for the diffusion of knowledge. There is nothing\r\ndearer to our hearts than our public school system, by which free\r\nprimary education is provided for every one within our borders. The\r\nhigher education, such as is provided by the University of Pennsylvania\r\nand kindred bodies, not only confers great benefits to those able to\r\ntake advantage of it, but entails upon them corresponding duties.\r\n\r\nThe men who founded this Nation had to deal with theories of government\r\nand the fundamental principles of free institutions. We are now\r\nconcerned with a different set of questions, for the Republic has\r\nbeen firmly established, its principles thoroughly tested and fully\r\napproved. To merely political issues have succeeded those of grave\r\nsocial and economic importance, the solution of which demands the best\r\nefforts of the best men. We have a right to expect that a wise and\r\nleading part in the effort to attain this solution will be taken by\r\nthose who have been exceptionally blessed in the matter of obtaining an\r\neducation. That college graduate is but a poor creature who does not\r\nfeel when he has left college that he has received something for which\r\nhe owes a return. What he thus owes he can, as a rule, only pay by the\r\nway he bears himself throughout life. It is but occasionally that a\r\ncollege graduate can do much outright for his alma mater; he can best\r\nrepay her by living a life that will reflect credit upon her, by so\r\ncarrying himself as a citizen that men shall see that the years spent\r\nin training him have not been wasted. The educated man is entitled\r\nto no special privilege, save the inestimable privilege of trying to\r\nshow that his education enables him to take the lead in striving to\r\nguide his fellows aright in the difficult task which is set to us of\r\nthe twentieth century. The problems before us to-day are very complex,\r\nand are widely different from those which the men of Washington’s\r\ngeneration had to face; but we can overcome them surely, and we can\r\novercome them only, if we approach them in the spirit which Washington\r\nand Washington’s great supporters brought to bear upon the problems\r\nof their day—the spirit of sanity and of courage, the spirit which\r\ncombines hard common-sense with the loftiest idealism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINAUGURAL ADDRESS, MARCH 4, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_My Fellow-Citizens:_\r\n\r\nNo people on earth have more cause to be thankful than ours, and this\r\nis said reverently, in no spirit of boastfulness in our own strength,\r\nbut with gratitude to the Giver of Good, who has blessed us with the\r\nconditions which have enabled us to achieve so large a measure of\r\nwell-being and of happiness. To us as a people it has been granted to\r\nlay the foundations of our national life in a new continent. We are\r\nthe heirs of the ages, and yet we have had to pay few of the penalties\r\nwhich in old countries are exacted by the dead hand of a bygone\r\ncivilization. We have not been obliged to fight for our existence\r\nagainst any alien race; and yet our life has called for the vigor and\r\neffort without which the manlier and hardier virtues wither away. Under\r\nsuch conditions it would be our own fault if we failed; and the success\r\nwhich we have had in the past, the success which we confidently believe\r\nthe future will bring, should cause in us no feeling of vainglory, but\r\nrather a deep and abiding realization of all which life has offered us;\r\na full acknowledgment of the responsibility which is ours, and a fixed\r\ndetermination to show that under a free government a mighty people can\r\nthrive best, alike as regards the things of the body and the things of\r\nthe soul.\r\n\r\nMuch has been given to us, and much will rightfully be expected from\r\nus. We have duties to others and duties to ourselves; and we can shirk\r\nneither. We have become a great Nation, forced by the fact of its\r\ngreatness into relations with the other nations of the earth; and we\r\nmust behave as beseems a people with such responsibilities. Toward all\r\nother nations, large and small, our attitude must be one of cordial and\r\nsincere friendship. We must show not only in our words but in our deeds\r\nthat we are earnestly desirous of securing their goodwill by acting\r\ntoward them in a spirit of just and generous recognition of all their\r\nrights. But justice and generosity in a nation, as in an individual,\r\ncount most when shown not by the weak but by the strong. While ever\r\ncareful to refrain from wronging others, we must be no less insistent\r\nthat we are not wronged ourselves. We wish peace; but we wish the peace\r\nof justice, the peace of righteousness. We wish it because we think\r\nit is right and not because we are afraid. No weak nation that acts\r\nmanfully and justly should ever have cause to fear us, and no strong\r\npower should ever be able to single us out as a subject for insolent\r\naggression.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the other Powers of the world are important; but\r\nstill more important are our relations among ourselves. Such growth in\r\nwealth, in population, and in power as this Nation has seen during the\r\ncentury and a quarter of its national life is inevitably accompanied\r\nby a like growth in the problems which are ever before every nation\r\nthat rises to greatness. Power invariably means both responsibility\r\nand danger. Our forefathers faced certain perils which we have\r\noutgrown. We now face other perils the very existence of which it\r\nwas impossible that they should foresee. Modern life is both complex\r\nand intense, and the tremendous changes wrought by the extraordinary\r\nindustrial development of the last half century are felt in every\r\nfibre of our social and political being. Never before have men tried\r\nso vast and formidable an experiment as that of administering the\r\naffairs of a continent under the forms of a democratic republic. The\r\nconditions which have told for our marvelous material well-being,\r\nwhich have developed to a very high degree our energy, self-reliance,\r\nand individual initiative, have also brought the care and anxiety\r\ninseparable from the accumulation of great wealth in industrial\r\ncentres. Upon the success of our experiment much depends; not only as\r\nregards our own welfare, but as regards the welfare of mankind. If\r\nwe fail, the cause of free self-government throughout the world will\r\nrock to its foundations; and therefore our responsibility is heavy, to\r\nourselves, to the world as it is to-day, and to the generations yet\r\nunborn. There is no good reason why we should fear the future, but\r\nthere is every reason why we should face it seriously, neither hiding\r\nfrom ourselves the gravity of the problems before us nor fearing to\r\napproach these problems with the unbending, unflinching purpose to\r\nsolve them aright.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, though the problems are new, though the tasks set\r\nbefore us differ from the tasks set before our fathers who founded\r\nand preserved this Republic, the spirit in which these tasks must\r\nbe undertaken and these problems faced, if our duty is to be well\r\ndone, remains essentially unchanged. We know that self-government is\r\ndifficult. We know that no people needs such high traits of character\r\nas that people which seeks to govern its affairs aright through the\r\nfreely expressed will of the freemen who compose it. But we have faith\r\nthat we shall not prove false to the memories of the men of the mighty\r\npast. They did their work, they left us the splendid heritage we now\r\nenjoy. We in our turn have an assured confidence that we shall be\r\nable to leave this heritage unwasted and enlarged to our children and\r\nour children’s children. To do so we must show, not merely in great\r\ncrises, but in the everyday affairs of life, the qualities of practical\r\nintelligence, of courage, of hardihood and endurance, and above all\r\nthe power of devotion to a lofty ideal, which made great the men who\r\nfounded this Republic in the days of Washington, which made great the\r\nmen who preserved this Republic in the days of Abraham Lincoln.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                 WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON\r\n                                                 _March 6, 1905_\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Senate:_\r\n\r\nI wish to call the attention of the Senate at this executive session\r\nto the treaty with Santo Domingo. I feel that I ought to state to the\r\nSenate that the condition of affairs in Santo Domingo is such that\r\nit is very much for the interest of that Republic that action on the\r\ntreaty should be had at as early a moment as the Senate, after giving\r\nthe matter full consideration, may find practicable.\r\n\r\nI call attention to the following facts:\r\n\r\n1. This treaty was entered into at the earnest request of Santo Domingo\r\nitself, and is designed to afford Santo Domingo relief and assistance.\r\nIts primary benefit will be to Santo Domingo. It offers the method most\r\nlikely to secure peace and to prevent war in the island.\r\n\r\n2. The benefit to the United States will consist chiefly in the\r\ntendency under the treaty to secure stability, order, and prosperity in\r\nSanto Domingo, and the removal of the apprehension lest foreign powers\r\nmake aggressions on Santo Domingo in the course of collecting claims\r\ndue their citizens; for it is greatly to our interest that all the\r\nislands in the Caribbean Sea should enjoy peace and prosperity and feel\r\ngoodwill toward this country. The benefit to honest creditors will come\r\nfrom the fact that for the first time under this treaty a practicable\r\nmethod of attempting to settle the debts due them will be inaugurated.\r\n\r\n3. Many of the debts alleged to be due from Santo Domingo to outside\r\ncreditors unquestionably on their face represent far more money than\r\never was actually given Santo Domingo. The proposed treaty provides\r\nfor a process by which impartial experts will determine what debts are\r\nvalid and what are in whole or in part invalid, and will apportion\r\naccordingly the surplus revenue available for the payment of the debts.\r\nThis treaty offers the only method for preventing the collection of\r\nfraudulent debts, whether owed to Americans or to citizens of other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n4. This treaty affords the most practicable means of obtaining payment\r\nfor the just claims of American citizens.\r\n\r\n5. If the treaty is ratified creditors belonging to other nations\r\nwill have exactly as good treatment as creditors who are citizens\r\nof the United States, and at the same time Santo Domingo will be\r\nprotected against unjust and exorbitant claims. If it is not ratified\r\nthe chances are that American creditors will fare ill as compared\r\nwith those of other nations; for foreign nations, being denied the\r\nopportunity to get what is rightfully due their citizens under the\r\nproposed arrangement, will be left to collect debts due their citizens\r\nas they see fit, provided, of course, there is not permanent occupancy\r\nof Dominican territory. As in such case the United States will have\r\nnothing to say as to what debts should or should not be collected, and\r\nas Santo Domingo will be left without aid, assistance, or protection,\r\nit is impossible to state that the sums collected from it will not\r\nbe improper in amount. In such event, whatever is collected by means\r\nof forcible intervention will be applied to the creditors of foreign\r\nnations in preference to creditors who are citizens of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n6. The correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Minister\r\nof Haiti, submitted to the Senate several days ago, shows that our\r\nposition is explicitly and unreservedly that under no circumstances\r\ndo we intend to acquire territory in or possession of either Haiti or\r\nSanto Domingo; it being stated in these letters that even if the two\r\nrepublics desired to become a part of the United States the United\r\nStates would certainly refuse its assent.\r\n\r\n7. Santo Domingo grievously needs the aid of a powerful and friendly\r\nnation. This aid we are able, and I trust that we are willing, to\r\nbestow. She has asked for this aid, and the expressions of friendship\r\nrepeatedly sanctioned by the people and the Government of the United\r\nStates warrant her in believing that it will not be withheld in the\r\nhour of her need.\r\n\r\n                                                     THEODORE ROOSEVELT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE MEETING OF THE AMERICAN TRACT SOCIETY, AT GRACE REFORMED\r\nCHURCH, WASHINGTON, D. C., MARCH 12, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Justice, Dr. Schick, and you, my Fellow-Members of this\r\n  Congregation, and our Guests who are with us to-day_:\r\n\r\nI am glad, on behalf of this church, to say amen to the appeal that has\r\nbeen made by Dr. Swift on behalf of the great society to the account of\r\nwhose work you have been listening. Mr. Justice, you quoted the advice\r\nof a poet “to be doers rather than dreamers.” In the Book of all books\r\nthere is a sentence to the same effect, “Be ye doers of the word and\r\nnot hearers only.” Let us show ourselves to-day doers of the word,\r\nupholders in fact of what has been preached to us by Dr. Swift.\r\n\r\nHe has set forth the needs of the society, and he has set forth the\r\ngreat field over which it works. I wish to touch only on a small\r\nportion of that field, but, after all, the portion that most concerns\r\nus—the need here at home, here in this country, of furthering in every\r\nway the work of the society, the work of all kindred societies, both\r\namong the native-born and among the thousands who come to these shores\r\nfrom abroad. And there is a peculiar propriety in such an appeal being\r\nmade to this church, for, as I have said here before, this church more\r\nthan most others should ever keep before it as part of its duty, as\r\none of the chief parts of its duty, that of caring in all ways, but\r\nespecially in spiritual ways, for the people who come to us from abroad.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government does endeavor to do its duty by the\r\nimmigrants who come to these shores; and I was glad, Dr. Swift, to\r\nlisten to what you said as to the work that is being done on Ellis\r\nIsland, for it is a just tribute to that work. But unless people have\r\nhad some experience with the dangers and difficulties surrounding the\r\nnewly arrived immigrant they can hardly realize how great they are.\r\nThe immigrant comes here almost unprotected; he does not, as a rule,\r\nknow our language; he is wholly unfamiliar with our institutions, our\r\ncustoms, our habits of life and ways of thought; and there are, I am\r\nsorry to say, great numbers of evil and wicked people who hope to\r\nmake their livelihood by preying on him. He is exposed to innumerable\r\ntemptations, innumerable petty oppressions, on almost every hand; and\r\nunless some one is on hand to help him he literally has no idea where\r\nto turn. No greater work can be done by a philanthropic or religious\r\nsociety than to stretch out the helping hand to the man and the woman\r\nwho come here to this country to become citizens and the parents of\r\ncitizens, and therefore to do their part in making up for weal or for\r\nwoe the future of our land. If we do not take care of them, if we do\r\nnot try to uplift them, then as sure as fate our own children will pay\r\nthe penalty. If we do not see that the immigrant and the children of\r\nthe immigrant are raised up, most assuredly the result will be that\r\nour own children and children’s children are pulled down. Either they\r\nwill rise or we shall sink. The level of well-being in this country\r\nwill be a level for all of us. We can not keep that level down for\r\na part and not have it sink more or less for the whole. If we raise\r\nit for a part we shall raise it to a certain extent for the whole.\r\nTherefore, it means much, not merely to the immigrants, but to every\r\ngood American, that there should be at Ellis Island the colporteurs\r\nof this society, and the representatives of other religious and\r\nphilanthropic societies to try to care for the immigrant’s body, and\r\nabove all to try to care for the immigrant’s soul.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, unnecessary to say that the things of the body must\r\nbe cared for; that the first duty of any man, especially of the man who\r\nhas others dependent upon him, is to take care of them, and to take\r\ncare of himself. Nobody can help others if he begins by being a burden\r\nupon others. Each man must be able to pull his own weight, to carry his\r\nown weight; and, therefore, each man must show the capacity to earn for\r\nhimself and his family enough to secure a certain amount of material\r\nwell-being. That must be the foundation. But on that foundation he must\r\nbuild as a superstructure the spiritual life.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things done by this society, and by kindred religious\r\nand benevolent societies, is supplying in our American life of to-day\r\nthe proper ideals. It is a good thing to have had the extraordinary\r\nmaterial prosperity which has followed so largely on the extraordinary\r\nscientific discoveries alluded to by Justice Brewer, if we use this\r\nmaterial prosperity aright. It is not a good thing, it is a bad thing,\r\nif we treat it as the be-all and end-all of our life. If we make it the\r\nonly ideal before this Nation, if we permit the people of this Republic\r\nto get before their minds the view that material well-being carried\r\nto an ever higher degree is the one and only thing to be striven\r\nfor, we are laying up for ourselves not merely trouble but ruin. I,\r\ntoo, feel the faith and hope that have been expressed here to-day by\r\nthe vice-president and the secretary of the society; but I so feel\r\nbecause I believe that we shall not permit mere material well-being\r\nto become the only ideal in this Nation, because I believe that more\r\nand more we shall accustom ourselves to looking at the great fortunes\r\naccumulated by certain men as being nothing in themselves, either to\r\nadmire, to envy or to deplore, save as they are used well or ill. If\r\nthe great fortune is used well, if the man who has accumulated it has\r\nthe strength necessary to resist the temptations either to use it\r\nwrongfully, or what is nearly as bad, not to use it aright—for negation\r\nmay be almost as harmful as positive wrongdoing—then he is entitled to\r\nthe praise due to whoever employs great powers for the common good. If\r\nthe man who accumulates that great fortune uses it ill or does not use\r\nit well, then so far from being an object of envy, still less an object\r\nof admiration, he should take his place among those whom we condemn\r\nand pity—for usually, if we have the root of the matter in us, we will\r\npity those we condemn.\r\n\r\nWonderful changes have come in the last half century. It may well\r\nbe as Mr. Justice Brewer has said, that we tremble on the verge of\r\nstill greater changes in the future. The railway, the telegraph, the\r\ntelephone, steam, electricity, all the marvelous mechanical inventions\r\nof these last five decades, have changed much in the superficial aspect\r\nof the world, and have, therefore, produced certain great changes in\r\nthe world itself. But after all, in glorying over and wondering at\r\nthis extraordinary development, I think that we sometimes forget that\r\ncompared to the deeper things it is indeed only superficial in its\r\neffect. The qualities that count most in man and woman now are the\r\nqualities that counted most two thousand years ago; and as a Nation\r\nwe shall achieve success or merit failure accordingly as we do or do\r\nnot display those qualities. Among the members of this congregation\r\nis a man who, in his prime, served as the fleet engineer of Farragut\r\nwhen Farragut went into Mobile Bay. That was forty-one years ago. The\r\nships and the guns with which Farragut did that mighty feat are now\r\nalmost as obsolete as the galleys that fought for the mastery of the\r\nÆgean Sea when Athens waged war on Sparta. They could no more stand\r\nagainst a modern ship than could the ships that fought against the\r\nInvincible Armada in 1588. But if the need ever comes for this Nation\r\nto call on its sons to face a foreign foe, the call will or will not be\r\nmade in vain just exactly according to whether we do or do not still\r\nretain the spirit which drove Farragut and the men under him onward to\r\nvictory. The gun changes, the ship changes; but the qualities needed in\r\nthe man behind the gun, in the man who handles the ship, are just the\r\nsame as they ever were. So it is in our whole material civilization of\r\nto-day. The railroad, the telegraph, all these wonderful inventions,\r\nproduce new problems, confer new benefits, and bring about new\r\ndangers. Cities are built up to enormous size, and, of course, with\r\nthe upbuilding of the cities comes the growth of the terrible problems\r\nwhich confront all of us who have to do with city life. Outward\r\ncircumstances change. New dangers spring up and old dangers vanish. But\r\nthe spirit necessary to meet the new dangers, the spirit necessary to\r\nensure the triumph that we must and shall win, is the same now that it\r\nhas always been. This is the spirit which lies behind this society, and\r\nall kindred societies; and we owe to this society all the help we can\r\nafford to give; for it is itself giving to our people a service beyond\r\nprice, a service of love, a service which no money could buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS BEFORE THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF MOTHERS, WASHINGTON, D. C.,\r\nMARCH 13, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mrs. President_:\r\n\r\nIn our modern industrial civilization there are many and grave dangers\r\nto counterbalance the splendors and the triumphs. It is not a good\r\nthing to see cities grow at disproportionate speed relatively to the\r\ncountry; for the small landowners, the men who own their little homes,\r\nand therefore to a very large extent the men who till farms, the men of\r\nthe soil, have hitherto made the foundation of lasting national life\r\nin every State; and, if the foundation becomes either too weak or too\r\nnarrow, the superstructure, no matter how attractive, is in imminent\r\ndanger of falling.\r\n\r\nBut far more important than the question of the occupation of our\r\ncitizens is the question of how their family life is conducted. No\r\nmatter what that occupation may be, as long as there is a real home and\r\nas long as those who make up that home do their duty to one another, to\r\ntheir neighbors and to the state, it is of minor consequence whether\r\nthe man’s trade is plied in the country or the city, whether it calls\r\nfor the work of the hands or for the work of the head.\r\n\r\nBut the Nation is in a bad way if there is no real home, if the family\r\nis not of the right kind; if the man is not a good husband and father,\r\nif he is brutal or cowardly or selfish, if the woman has lost her\r\nsense of duty, if she is sunk in vapid self-indulgence or has let her\r\nnature be twisted so that she prefers a sterile pseudo-intellectuality\r\nto that great and beautiful development of character which comes only\r\nto those whose lives know the fulness of duty done, of effort made and\r\nself-sacrifice undergone.\r\n\r\nIn the last analysis the welfare of the state depends absolutely upon\r\nwhether or not the average family, the average man and woman and their\r\nchildren, represent the kind of citizenship fit for the foundation of a\r\ngreat nation; and if we fail to appreciate this we fail to appreciate\r\nthe root morality upon which all healthy civilization is based.\r\n\r\nNo piled-up wealth, no splendor of material growth, no brilliance of\r\nartistic development, will permanently avail any people unless its home\r\nlife is healthy, unless the average man possesses honesty, courage,\r\ncommon-sense, and decency, unless he works hard and is willing at need\r\nto fight hard; and unless the average woman is a good wife, a good\r\nmother, able and willing to perform the first and greatest duty of\r\nwomanhood, able and willing to bear, and to bring up as they should be\r\nbrought up, healthy children, sound in body, mind, and character, and\r\nnumerous enough so that the race shall increase and not decrease.\r\n\r\nThere are certain old truths which will be true as long as this world\r\nendures, and which no amount of progress can alter. One of these is the\r\ntruth that the primary duty of the husband is to be the homemaker,\r\nthe breadwinner for his wife and children, and that the primary duty\r\nof the woman is to be the helpmeet, the housewife, and mother. The\r\nwoman should have ample educational advantages; but save in exceptional\r\ncases the man must be, and she need not be, and generally ought not\r\nto be, trained for a lifelong career as the family breadwinner; and,\r\ntherefore, after a certain point the training of the two must normally\r\nbe different because the duties of the two are normally different. This\r\ndoes not mean inequality of function, but it does mean that normally\r\nthere must be dissimilarity of function. On the whole, I think the\r\nduty of the woman the more important, the more difficult, and the more\r\nhonorable of the two; on the whole I respect the woman who does her\r\nduty even more than I respect the man who does his.\r\n\r\nNo ordinary work done by a man is either as hard or as responsible as\r\nthe work of a woman who is bringing up a family of small children; for\r\nupon her time and strength demands are made not only every hour of the\r\nday but often every hour of the night. She may have to get up night\r\nafter night to take care of a sick child, and yet must by day continue\r\nto do all her household duties as well; and if the family means are\r\nscant she must usually enjoy even her rare holidays taking her whole\r\nbrood of children with her. The birth pangs make all men the debtors of\r\nall women. Above all, our sympathy and regard are due to the struggling\r\nwives among those whom Abraham Lincoln called the plain people, and\r\nwhom he so loved and trusted; for the lives of these women are often\r\nled on the lonely heights of quiet, self-sacrificing heroism.\r\n\r\nJust as the happiest and most honorable and most useful task that\r\ncan be set any man is to earn enough for the support of his wife and\r\nfamily, for the bringing up and starting in life of his children, so\r\nthe most important, the most honorable and desirable task which can\r\nbe set any woman is to be a good and wise mother in a home marked by\r\nself-respect and mutual forbearance, by willingness to perform duty,\r\nand by refusal to sink into self-indulgence or avoid that which entails\r\neffort and self-sacrifice. Of course, there are exceptional men and\r\nexceptional women who can do and ought to do much more than this,\r\nwho can lead and ought to lead great careers of outside usefulness\r\nin addition to—not as substitute for—their home work; but I am not\r\nspeaking of exceptions; I am speaking of the primary duties, I am\r\nspeaking of the average citizens, the average men and women who make up\r\nthe Nation.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as I am speaking to an assemblage of mothers I shall have\r\nnothing whatever to say in praise of an easy life. Yours is the work\r\nwhich is never ended. No mother has an easy time, and most mothers have\r\nvery hard times; and yet what true mother would barter her experience\r\nof joy and sorrow in exchange for a life of cold selfishness, which\r\ninsists upon perpetual amusement and the avoidance of care, and which\r\noften finds its fit dwelling-place in some flat designed to furnish\r\nwith the least possible expenditure of effort the maximum of comfort\r\nand of luxury, but in which there is literally no place for children?\r\n\r\nThe woman who is a good wife, a good mother, is entitled to our respect\r\nas is no one else; but she is entitled to it only because, and so long\r\nas, she is worthy of it. Effort and self-sacrifice are the law of\r\nworthy life for the man as for the woman; though neither the effort\r\nnor the self-sacrifice may be the same for the one as for the other. I\r\ndo not in the least believe in the patient Griselda type of woman, in\r\nthe woman who submits to gross and long-continued ill-treatment, any\r\nmore than I believe in a man who tamely submits to wrongful aggression.\r\nNo wrongdoing is so abhorrent as wrongdoing by a man toward the wife\r\nand the children who should arouse every tender feeling in his nature.\r\nSelfishness toward them, lack of tenderness toward them, lack of\r\nconsideration for them, above all, brutality in any form toward them,\r\nshould arouse the heartiest scorn and indignation in every upright soul.\r\n\r\nI believe in the woman’s keeping her self-respect just as I believe in\r\nthe man’s doing so. I believe in her rights just as much as I believe\r\nin the man’s, and indeed a little more; and I regard marriage as a\r\npartnership in which each partner is in honor bound to think of the\r\nrights of the other as well as of his or her own. But I think that the\r\nduties are even more important than the rights; and in the long run I\r\nthink that the reward is ampler and greater for duty well done than for\r\nthe insistence upon individual rights, necessary though this, too, must\r\noften be. Your duty is hard, your responsibility great; but greatest of\r\nall is your reward. I do not pity you in the least. On the contrary, I\r\nfeel respect and admiration for you.\r\n\r\nInto the woman’s keeping is committed the destiny of the generations to\r\ncome after us. In bringing up your children you mothers must remember\r\nthat while it is essential to be loving and tender it is no less\r\nessential to be wise and firm. Foolishness and affection must not be\r\ntreated as interchangeable terms; and besides training your sons and\r\ndaughters in the softer and milder virtues you must seek to give them\r\nthose stern and hardy qualities which in after life they will surely\r\nneed. Some children will go wrong in spite of the best training; and\r\nsome will go right even when their surroundings are most unfortunate;\r\nnevertheless an immense amount depends upon the family training. If\r\nyou mothers through weakness bring up your sons to be selfish and to\r\nthink only of themselves, you will be responsible for much sadness\r\namong the women who are to be their wives in the future. If you let\r\nyour daughters grow up idle, perhaps under the mistaken impression\r\nthat as you yourselves have had to work hard they shall know only\r\nenjoyment, you are preparing them to be useless to others and burdens\r\nto themselves. Teach boys and girls alike that they are not to look\r\nforward to lives spent in avoiding difficulties but to lives spent in\r\novercoming difficulties. Teach them that work, for themselves and also\r\nfor others, is not a curse but a blessing; seek to make them happy, to\r\nmake them enjoy life, but seek also to make them face life with the\r\nsteadfast resolution to wrest success from labor and adversity, and\r\nto do their whole duty before God and to man. Surely she who can thus\r\ntrain her sons and her daughters is thrice fortunate among women.\r\n\r\nThere are many good people who are denied the supreme blessing of\r\nchildren, and for these we have the respect and sympathy always\r\ndue to those who, from no fault of their own, are denied any\r\nof the other great blessings of life. But the man or woman who\r\ndeliberately foregoes these blessings, whether from viciousness,\r\ncoldness, shallow-heartedness, self-indulgence, or mere failure to\r\nappreciate aright the difference between the all-important and the\r\nunimportant—why, such a creature merits contempt as hearty as any\r\nvisited upon the soldier who runs away in battle, or upon the man who\r\nrefuses to work for the support of those dependent upon him, and who\r\nthough able-bodied is yet content to eat in idleness the bread which\r\nothers provide.\r\n\r\nThe existence of women of this type forms one of the most unpleasant\r\nand unwholesome features of modern life. If any one is so dim of\r\nvision as to fail to see what a thoroughly unlovely creature such a\r\nwoman is I wish they would read Judge Robert Grant’s novel “Unleavened\r\nBread,” ponder seriously the character of Selma, and think of the fate\r\nthat would surely overcome any nation which developed its average\r\nand typical woman along such lines. Unfortunately it would be untrue\r\nto say that this type exists only in American novels. That it also\r\nexists in American life is made unpleasantly evident by the statistics\r\nas to the dwindling families in some localities. It is made evident\r\nin equally sinister fashion by the census statistics as to divorce,\r\nwhich are fairly appalling; for easy divorce is now, as it ever has\r\nbeen, a bane to any nation, a curse to society, a menace to the home,\r\nan incitement to married unhappiness and to immorality, an evil thing\r\nfor men and a still more hideous evil for women. These unpleasant\r\ntendencies in our American life are made evident by articles such as\r\nthose which I actually read not long ago in the “Independent,” where\r\na clergyman was quoted, seemingly with approval, as expressing the\r\ngeneral American attitude when he said that the ambition of any save a\r\nvery rich man should be to rear two children only, so as to give his\r\nchildren an opportunity “to taste a few of the good things of life.”\r\nThis man, whose profession and calling should have made him a moral\r\nteacher, writing in what is professedly a religious paper, actually set\r\nbefore others the ideal, not of training children to do their duty,\r\nnot of sending them forth with stout hearts and ready minds to win\r\ntriumphs for themselves and their country, not of allowing them the\r\nopportunity and giving them the privilege of making their own place in\r\nthe world, but, forsooth, of keeping the number of children so limited\r\nthat they might “taste a few good things!” The way to give a child a\r\nfair chance in life is not to bring it up in luxury, but to see that\r\nit has the kind of training that will give it strength of character.\r\nEven apart from the vital question of national life, and regarding\r\nonly the individual interest of the children themselves, happiness in\r\nthe true sense is a hundredfold more apt to come to any given member\r\nof a healthy family of healthy-minded children, well brought up, well\r\neducated, but taught that they must shift for themselves, must win\r\ntheir own way, and by their own exertions make their own positions of\r\nusefulness, than it is apt to come to those whose parents themselves\r\nhave acted on and have trained their children to act on, the selfish\r\nand sordid theory that the whole end of life is “to taste a few good\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nThe intelligence of the remark is on a par with its morality, for the\r\nmost rudimentary mental process would have shown the speaker that\r\nif the average family in which there are children contained but two\r\nchildren the Nation as a whole would decrease in population so rapidly\r\nthat in two or three generations it would very deservedly be on the\r\npoint of extinction, so that the people who had acted on this base and\r\nselfish doctrine would be giving place to others with braver and more\r\nrobust ideals. Nor would such a result be in any way regrettable; for a\r\nrace that practiced such doctrine—that is, a race that practiced race\r\nsuicide—would thereby conclusively show that it was unfit to exist,\r\nand that it had better give place to people who had not forgotten the\r\nprimary laws of their being.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, then, the whole matter is simple enough. If either a race\r\nor an individual prefers the pleasures of mere effortless ease, of\r\nself-indulgence, to the infinitely deeper, the infinitely higher\r\npleasures that come to those who know the toil and the weariness, but\r\nalso the joy, of hard duty well done, why, that race or that individual\r\nmust inevitably in the end pay the penalty of leading a life both vapid\r\nand ignoble. No man and no woman really worthy of the name can care for\r\nthe life spent solely or chiefly in the avoidance of risk and trouble\r\nand labor. Save in exceptional cases the prizes worth having in life\r\nmust be paid for, and the life worth living must be a life of work for\r\na worthy end, and ordinarily of work more for others than for one’s\r\nself.\r\n\r\nThe man is but a poor creature whose effort is not rather for the\r\nbetterment of his wife and children than for himself; and as for\r\nthe mother, her very name stands for loving unselfishness and\r\nself-abnegation, and, in any society fit to exist, is fraught with\r\nassociations which render it holy.\r\n\r\nThe woman’s task is not easy—no task worth doing is easy—but in doing\r\nit, and when she has done it, there shall come to her the highest and\r\nholiest joy known to mankind; and having done it, she shall have the\r\nreward prophesied in Scripture; for her husband and her children, yes,\r\nand all people who realize that her work lies at the foundation of all\r\nnational happiness and greatness, shall rise up and call her blessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE DINNER OF THE SOCIETY OF FRIENDLY SONS OF ST. PATRICK,\r\nDELMONICO’S, NEW YORK CITY, MARCH 17, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, a matter of peculiar pleasure to me to come to my\r\nown city and to meet so many men with whom I have been associated for\r\nthe last quarter of a century—for it was nearly that time ago, Judge,\r\nthat you and I first met when we were both in the New York Legislature\r\ntogether—and to be greeted by you as you have greeted me to-night. I\r\nwish to express at the outset my special sense of obligation—and I\r\nknow that the rest of you will not grudge my expressing it—my special\r\nsense of obligation to Colonel Duffy and the officers and men of the\r\nSixty-ninth, who were my escort to-day. I shall write to Colonel Duffy\r\nlater, to give him formal notice, and to ask him to give the regiment\r\nformal notice, of my appreciation, but I wish to express it thus\r\npublicly to-night.\r\n\r\nAnd now, before I begin my speech proper, I wish to read a telegram\r\nwhich has been handed to me as a sop to certain of my well-known\r\nprejudices. It has been sent up to me by one of the members here\r\nto-night, who when we came into the dining-room was only a father, but\r\nwho at this moment is a grandfather. This telegram runs as follows:\r\n\r\n“Peter McDonnell, Friendly Sons’ Dinner, Delmonico’s. Patrick just\r\narrived. Tired after parade. Sends his regards to the President. He is\r\nthe first on record since the President attended the Friendly Sons’\r\ndinner. He is a fine singer. No race suicide in this family. Weighs\r\neight pounds, looks like the whole family. The mother is doing well.\r\nRobert McDonnell.”\r\n\r\nAnd, gentlemen, I want you to join with me in drinking the health of\r\nPatrick, Peter, Robert, and above all, of the best of the whole outfit,\r\nMrs. McDonnell, the mother.\r\n\r\nNow we will pass from the present to the past. The Judge has spoken to\r\nyou of the formation of the Society of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick\r\nin Philadelphia, in colonial days. It was natural that it should have\r\nstarted in Philadelphia and at the time of which the Judge spoke. For\r\nwe must not forget, in dealing with our history as a Nation, that long\r\nbefore the outbreak of the Revolution there had begun on the soil of\r\nthe colonies, which afterward became the United States, that mixture of\r\nraces which has been and still is one of the most important features in\r\nour history as a people. At the time, early in the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen the immigrants from Ireland first began to come in numbers to this\r\ncountry, the race elements were still imperfectly fused, and for some\r\ntime the then new Irish strain was clearly distinguishable from the\r\nothers. And there was one peculiarity about these immigrants who came\r\nfrom Ireland to the colonies in the eighteenth century which has never\r\nbeen paralleled in the case of any other immigrants whatsoever. In all\r\nother cases since the very first settlements, the pushing westward of\r\nthe frontier, the conquest of the Continent has been due primarily\r\nto the men of native birth. But the immigrants from Ireland in the\r\neighteenth century, and those alone, pushed boldly through the settled\r\ndistricts and planted themselves as the advance guard of the conquering\r\ncivilization on the borders of the Indian-haunted wilderness.\r\n\r\nThis was true in Northern Maine and New Hampshire, in Western\r\nPennsylvania, Virginia, and the Carolinas alike. And, inasmuch as\r\nPhiladelphia was the largest city which was in touch with that extreme\r\nWestern frontier, it was most natural that the Society of the Friendly\r\nSons of St. Patrick should first be formed in that city. We had, I\r\nwish to say, in New York, frequently during colonial days, dinners\r\nof societies of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick, but apparently the\r\nsociety in New York did not take a permanent form; but we frequently\r\nhad dinners on March 17 of the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick here in New\r\nYork City even in colonial days.\r\n\r\nBy the time the Revolution had broken out, the men of different race\r\nstrains had begun to fuse together, and the Irish among those strains\r\nfurnished their full share of leadership in the struggle. Among their\r\nnumber was Commodore John Barry, one of the two or three officers to\r\nwhom our infant Navy owed most. I had the honor in the last session of\r\nCongress to recommend that a monument to Barry should be erected in\r\nWashington. I heartily believe in economy, but I think we can afford to\r\nlet up enough to let that monument through.\r\n\r\nOn land, the men of this strain furnished generals like Montgomery, who\r\nfell so gloriously at Quebec, and like Sullivan, the conqueror of the\r\nIroquois, who came of a New Hampshire family, which furnished governors\r\nto three New England States. In her old age, the mother, Mrs. Sullivan,\r\nused to say that she had known what it was to work hard in the fields\r\ncarrying in her arms the Governor of Massachusetts, with the Governors\r\nof New Hampshire and Vermont tagging on at her skirts.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the generals. Now for the rank and file. The\r\nContinental troops of the hardest fighter among Washington’s generals,\r\nMad Anthony Wayne, were recruited so largely from this stock that\r\nLighthorse Harry Lee of Virginia, the father of the great general,\r\nRobert Lee, always referred to them as “The Line of Ireland.” Nor must\r\nwe forget that of this same stock there was a boy during the days of\r\nthe Revolution who afterward became the chief American general of his\r\ntime, and, as President, one of the public men who left his impress\r\nmost deeply upon our Nation, Andrew Jackson, the victor of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution was the first great crisis of our history. The Civil War\r\nwas the second. And in this second great crisis the part played by the\r\nmen of Irish birth or parentage was no less striking than it had been\r\nin the Revolution. Among the three or four great generals who led the\r\nNorthern Army in the war, stood Phil Sheridan. Some of those whom I am\r\nnow addressing served in that immortal brigade which on the fatal day\r\nof Fredericksburg left its dead closest to the stonewall which marked\r\nthe limit that could not be overpassed even by the highest valor.\r\n\r\nAnd, gentlemen, it was my good fortune when it befell me to serve\r\nas a regimental commander in a very small war—but all the war there\r\nwas—to have under me more than one of the sons of those who served in\r\nMeagher’s brigade. Among them was one of my two best captains, both\r\nof whom were killed, Allen Capron, and this man Bucky O’Neill. Bucky\r\nO’Neill was killed at Santiago, showing the same absolute indifference\r\nto life, the same courage, the same gallant readiness to sacrifice\r\neverything on the altar of an ideal, that his father had shown when he\r\ndied in Meagher’s brigade in the Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe people who have come to this country from Ireland have contributed\r\nto the stock of our common citizenship qualities which are essential\r\nto the welfare of every great nation. They are a masterful race of\r\nrugged character, a race the qualities of whose womanhood have become\r\nproverbial, while its men have the elemental, the indispensable virtues\r\nof working hard in time of peace and fighting hard in time of war.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to say here, as I have said and shall say again elsewhere,\r\nas I shall say again and again, that we must never forget that no\r\namount of material wealth, no amount of intellect, no artistic or\r\nscientific growth can avail anything to the nation which loses the\r\nelemental virtues. If the average man can not work and fight, the race\r\nis in a poor way; and it will not have, because it will not deserve,\r\nthe respect of any one.\r\n\r\nLet us avoid always, either as individuals or as a Nation, brawling,\r\nspeaking discourteously or acting offensively toward others, but let\r\nus make it evident that we wish peace, not because we are weak, but\r\nbecause we think it right; and that while we do not intend to wrong any\r\none, we are perfectly competent to hold our own if any one wrongs us.\r\nThere has never been a time in this country when it has not been true\r\nof the average American of Irish birth or parentage, that he came up to\r\nthis standard, able to work and able to fight at need.\r\n\r\nBut the men of Irish birth or of Irish descent have been far more than\r\nsoldiers—I will not say more than, but much in addition to, soldiers.\r\nIn every walk in life in this country men of this blood have stood and\r\nnow stand pre-eminent, not only as soldiers but as statesmen, on the\r\nbench, at the bar, and in business. They are doing their full share\r\ntoward the artistic and literary development of the country.\r\n\r\nAnd right here let me make a special plea to you, to this society and\r\nkindred societies: We Americans take a just pride in the development\r\nof our great universities, and more and more we are seeking to provide\r\nfor creative and original work in these universities. I hope that an\r\nearnest effort will be made to endow chairs in American universities\r\nfor the study of Celtic literature and for research in Celtic\r\nantiquities. It is only of recent years that the extraordinary wealth\r\nand beauty of the old Celtic Sagas have been fully appreciated, and we\r\nof America, who have so large a Celtic strain in our blood, can not\r\nafford to be behindhand in the work of adding to modern scholarship by\r\nbringing within its ken the great Celtic literature of the past.\r\n\r\nMy fellow-countrymen, I have spoken to-night especially of what has\r\nbeen done for this Nation of ours by men of Irish blood. But, after\r\nall, in speaking to you, or, to any other body of my fellow-citizens,\r\nno matter from what Old World country they themselves or their\r\nforefathers may have come, the great thing is to remember that we are\r\nall of us Americans. Let us keep our pride in the stocks from which\r\nwe have sprung, but let us show that pride, not by holding aloof from\r\none another, least of all by preserving the Old World jealousies and\r\nbitternesses, but by joining in a spirit of generous rivalry to see\r\nwhich can do most for our great common country.\r\n\r\nAmericanism is not a matter of creed or birthplace or descent. That man\r\nis the best American who has in him the American spirit, the American\r\nsoul. Such a man fears not the strong and harms not the weak. He scorns\r\nwhat is base or cruel or dishonest. He looks beyond the accidents of\r\noccupation or social condition and hails each of his fellow-citizens\r\nas his brother, asking nothing save that each shall treat the other on\r\nhis worth as a man, and that they shall all join together to do what in\r\nthem lies for the uplifting of this mighty and vigorous people. In our\r\nveins runs the blood of many an Old World nation. We are kin to each of\r\nthese nations and yet identical with none.\r\n\r\nOur policy should be one of cordial friendship for them all, and yet\r\nwe should keep ever before our eyes the fact that we are ourselves\r\na separate people with our own ideals and standards, and destined,\r\nwhether for better or for worse, to work out a wholly new national\r\ntype. The fate of the twentieth century will in no small degree—I ask\r\nyou to think of this from the standpoint of the world—the fate of the\r\ntwentieth century as it bears on the world will in no small degree\r\ndepend upon the type of citizenship developed on this Continent. Surely\r\nsuch a thought must thrill us with the resolute purpose so to bear\r\nourselves that the name American shall stand as the symbol of just,\r\ngenerous, and fearless treatment of all men and all nations. Let us be\r\ntrue to ourselves, for we can not then be false to any man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS AT THE DINNER OF THE SONS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, HOTEL\r\nASTOR, NEW YORK CITY, MARCH 17, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladies and Gentlemen_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to greet not merely the Sons but the Daughters of the\r\nAmerican Revolution, and it is indeed a pleasure to be with you and say\r\na few words, partly of greeting to you and partly in reference to what\r\nI feel should be the work, the special work, of a society like this,\r\nthe Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. It ought to fulfil\r\nmore than one function. In the first place, it should, of course, keep\r\nup our sense of historic continuity with the past. It is a good thing,\r\npre-eminently a good thing, for this Nation never to lose sight of what\r\nhas been done in the past by those who founded and those who preserved\r\nthe Republic. It is eminently fit that there should be associations\r\nbanded together for the special purpose of keeping fresh in the minds\r\nof all of us the great memories of the men of the past and of what\r\nthese men did. But if we treat that merely as a relaxation, merely as a\r\npleasant mental exercise, I think we come lamentably short of what we\r\nought to do.\r\n\r\nThe way to pay effective homage to the men of the mighty past is to\r\nlive decently and efficiently in the present. We have a right to expect\r\nthat every society like this shall be a nucleus for patriotic endeavor\r\nin the affairs of the day. Now, in studying the past I wish that\r\nsocieties like this would pay heed not only to what is pleasant for us\r\nto read about, but also to what is unpleasant. I do not think that a\r\ndiet of all praise is good for any one, and it is no better for us as a\r\nbody politic than for any one of us individually. Admiral Coghlan will\r\ntell you that the first step necessary in bringing the Navy up to its\r\npresent standard of marksmanship was having the Navy understand that\r\nits marksmanship was not what it ought to be. I think the facts will\r\nbear me out.\r\n\r\nThe thing to do is to remember what Emerson says, that in the long\r\nrun an unpleasant truth is a very much safer companion than even the\r\npleasantest falsehood. Our pride in what was done in the past should\r\nnot permit us to be led away into blindness by failure to appreciate\r\nwhatever was wrong in the past. Read what Washington said about the\r\naverage militia regiment of the Revolutionary War, and you will not\r\nfind he used complimentary language. It was because our people declined\r\nto accept Washington’s judgment on the militia, and persisted in\r\ntrying the experiment of fighting the War of 1812 with militia, that\r\nthe first two years of that war resulted not merely disastrously, but\r\nshamefully, and among other things resulted in the burning of the city\r\nof Washington. We did not begin to win on land until we had evolved\r\nthrough mighty hard knocks a small army under Brown and Scott on the\r\nnorthern frontier, which, when evolved, proved able to do what no\r\nContinental army at that time could do, that is, meet to advantage\r\nthe best troops of Britain. We won at sea because we had a number of\r\nfrigates and sloops which had been built more than fifteen years before\r\nand whose officers had been trained in the school of their profession\r\nat sea and in action. We won these victories because we had the fleet;\r\nand if the fleet had been bigger we would not have had to fight the war\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nNow, I ask that societies like this teach the truth; teach the truth\r\nthat helps, even if it hurts a little in the helping. Take our struggle\r\nin building up our Navy to its present strength. We were hampered in\r\nthat struggle by the ignorant and unspeakably foolish belief that\r\nsomehow or other America was so big and smart a Nation that we did not\r\nneed a Navy, and could improvise one out of hand if the need ever arose.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Coghlan lived through the period which saw the United States\r\nat the close of the Civil War, with Farragut and his fellows as our\r\nadmirals, loom up as one of the great naval Powers of the earth, which\r\nthen saw us about the year 1882 reduced to a condition of effective\r\nsea-strength when it would have been flattery to call us a fifth-rate\r\nPower, and which then saw the building up of our Navy until at present,\r\ntaking into account the ships built and authorized, and, above all,\r\ntaking into account the way those ships are handled, singly and in\r\nsquadrons—taking into the account the ships, the armor, the guns, and,\r\nabove all, the men in the conning towers, in the engine rooms and\r\nbehind the guns—we rank as one of the big naval Powers of the earth.\r\nWe rank as such, we occupy our present position and we are a power\r\npotent for peace because we deliberately faced the fact that we did not\r\nhave a Navy worth anything in 1882.\r\n\r\nI take immense interest in the Navy, because the Navy is the arm upon\r\nwhich this country must most depend for holding its own and upholding\r\nits honor so far as our international relations are concerned. We\r\nhad to educate our people slowly up to the need of a Navy. We began\r\nby building some cruisers. We then built two or three fast vessels\r\ncalled commerce destroyers. We had quite a time for several years in\r\npersuading excellent people of good intentions, but not entirely clear\r\nminds, that it was rather less immoral to destroy commerce than to take\r\nlife in battleships. Then we had to go through the stage of meeting and\r\nby degrees overcoming the arguments of those other excellent people who\r\nsaid we must have fighting ships, but only for defence; that we must\r\nonly have coast defence ships; that is, we must win the fight not by\r\nhitting, but by parrying. If we had carried out that theory, Admiral\r\nCoghlan and his fellow-captains under Dewey would have been cooped up\r\nin coast defence vessels in San Francisco, while the hostile ships\r\nrested unharmed in Manila. That is the theory of coast defence; and\r\nin that case the war would never have had any end. We won because by\r\nthat time our people had at last awakened to the fact that in a navy\r\nyou want the very best type of ship; and that of all foolish things,\r\nthe most foolish is to hit soft. Do not hit at all if you can help it.\r\nAvoid trouble of every kind. Do not hit at all if you can help it,\r\nbut never hit soft. When Dewey and the captains under him went into\r\nManila Bay they went in in ships that had been built, not that year nor\r\nthe year before. Some of them had been built as much as fifteen years\r\nbefore, twelve years, eight years; and the legislators who authorized\r\nthe building of those ships, the men who built them, the captains who\r\nfirst took them out, the captains who trained the men aboard them,\r\nevery man who did his part in bringing up the Navy to the standard of\r\nefficiency which it had reached in 1898 is justly entitled to his share\r\nof the credit in the victory won on that first day of May.\r\n\r\nWhen you cheer for Dewey, when you think of Farragut, when you speak of\r\nthe founders of the American Navy in the days of the Revolution, do not\r\nconfine yourselves to cheers, do not confine yourselves to saying what\r\na great man Washington was and how he was backed up by generals and\r\nstatesmen of that day; but take example from what those men did, take\r\nwarning from what their less wise fellows did, and prepare for victory\r\nin the only way in which victory can be prepared for, by preparing for\r\nit in advance.\r\n\r\nI spoke to you of the difficulties to be met with in getting the Navy\r\nbuilt up. Among these difficulties is the fact that there are some\r\nvery good people who, whenever you say that you want a good Navy, say\r\nthat “this is a lamentable illustration of the jingo spirit, and that\r\nthere is no reason why this country should ever have a war.” I know\r\none excellent gentleman in Congress who said he preferred arbitration\r\nto battleships. So do I. But suppose the other man does not. I want to\r\nhave the battleships as a provocative for arbitration so far as the\r\nother man is concerned.\r\n\r\nWe have now got our Navy up to a good point. We have built and are\r\nbuilding forty armored ships. For a year or two, or two or three\r\nyears, to come, what we need to do is to provide for the personnel of\r\nthose ships, and to secure the very highest standard of efficiency in\r\nhandling them, singly and in squadrons; above all, for handling the\r\ngreat guns. So much for the Navy.\r\n\r\nNow a word for the Army. I was very sorry that this year Congress did\r\nnot provide the means for having field manœuvres such as those General\r\nGrant and General Bell took part in last year. Those manœuvres are\r\nvery useful. It is impossible to take National Guard regiments and put\r\nthem into such manœuvres without causing them great discomfort, and it\r\nmay be better to keep such manœuvres as were carried on last year for\r\nthe Regular Army. But it is a great mistake not to continue them for\r\nthe Regular Army. We have a small Regular Army. It is not advisable\r\nor necessary that we should have a large one. It is advisable, it is\r\nnecessary, that the Army we have should be efficient as a whole as\r\nwell as efficient in its individual parts. I firmly believe that given\r\nan equal chance, the officers and enlisted men of the American Army\r\noffer material quite as good as any to be found in any army of the\r\nworld. Because I believe that I think it not merely an iniquity but a\r\ncrime not to give the officers and the enlisted men that equal chance.\r\nWe have an Army now short of seventy thousand men. Deducting the men\r\nnecessary for the manning of the coast defences, it would give us at\r\nthe very outside figure a possible Army of fifty thousand men—that is,\r\nan Army about one-fourteenth the size of the forces that have been\r\ncontending in the mighty death wrestle around Mukden. Surely we owe\r\nit to this Nation that we should have that Army of fifty thousand men\r\nable to manœuvre as an Army of fifty thousand men and able to render as\r\ngood service as such as any army can render. We can never achieve that\r\nideal unless we are willing as a Nation to spend the money so that the\r\nArmy shall have the chance of being handled in time of peace in great\r\nmasses by the men who will handle it in masses in time of war. If when\r\nwar comes you set thirty thousand men, of whom no more than five or\r\nsix hundred have ever served together, under officers who have never\r\nhandled, any of them, more than five or six hundred men, you can not\r\nexpect anything but disaster; unless perchance you go against a foe\r\neven more foolish than you are.\r\n\r\nSo I ask you of this society, the Sons of the American Revolution, to\r\nstudy the war of the Revolution, to study the War of 1812, to study\r\nthe war with Mexico, and the Civil War, not only from the standpoint\r\nof the victories, but from the standpoint of the defeats, and to try\r\nto see to it that in our policy at the present time we carry out the\r\nold policies that won the victories, and avoid the old policies that\r\nbrought about the defeats.\r\n\r\nI speak in the interest of peace when I ask for an efficient Army\r\nand Navy. This is a high-spirited people. This is a people that will\r\nnot abandon the Monroe Doctrine, will not stop building the Isthmian\r\nCanal, will not surrender its hold upon the islands of the sea. Very\r\ngood; then take such steps as are necessary to make your hold on those\r\npossessions, your backing of this doctrine, effective, and not empty\r\nbluster.\r\n\r\nSo it is in civic affairs. Study not only what Washington and\r\nWashington’s supporters did, but study what was done by those who\r\nbrought the Continental Congress to absolute impotence. Study what was\r\ndone by those who nearly undid the good work of Washington. Study what\r\nhas been done in the past by the men who have made errors no less than\r\nby the men who have won triumphs, and profit alike by the study of the\r\ntriumphs and by the study of the errors.\r\n\r\nTalking among ourselves, man to man, each of us will admit to the other\r\nthat there are things in our life that he does not like; but when one\r\nof us gets on his feet to address the rest he often seems to feel as\r\nif somehow he ought never to speak save in indiscriminate praise of\r\nall. The same man who will take an unwarrantably pessimistic view of\r\nall our governmental matters in private will feel obliged to speak\r\nin unwarrantable praise of all these matters in public. We ought to\r\navoid ignorant praise as much as ignorant blame. It is only by making a\r\ncorrect diagnosis that we can find out how to treat any given disease.\r\nA good physician in making a diagnosis is not either an optimist or\r\na pessimist. He wants to find out the facts; for to take either too\r\ndark or too rosy a view may be fatal to the patient. Just so in our\r\nbody politic. Try to find out what the facts really are, try to find\r\nout what the good qualities, what the defects; what the good side is\r\nin any portion of our Government, what the defect is in any portion of\r\nour Government. State the truth; do not hysterically exaggerate what is\r\ngood; do not hysterically exaggerate what is evil. Find out the facts;\r\nand then with your whole heart set to work to preserve and make better\r\nthe good and to cut out and do away with the evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS TO THE GRADUATES OF THE UNITED STATES NAVAL MEDICAL SCHOOL,\r\nWASHINGTON, D. C., MARCH 25, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Ladies and Gentlemen; and especially the Members of the Graduating\r\n  Class_:\r\n\r\nI am glad to have the chance of saying a word of greeting to you this\r\nmorning. You represent two professions, for you are members of the\r\ngreat medical body and you are also officers of the Navy of the United\r\nStates, and therefore you have a double standard of honor up to which\r\nto live. I think that all of us laymen, men and women, have a peculiar\r\nappreciation of what a doctor means; for I do not suppose there is one\r\nof us who does not feel that the family doctor stands in a position\r\nof close intimacy with each of us, in a position of obligation to him\r\nunder which one is happy to rest to an extent hardly possible with\r\nany one else; and those of us, I think most of us, who are fortunate\r\nenough to have a family doctor who is a beloved and intimate friend,\r\nrealize that there can be few closer ties of intimacy and affection in\r\nthe world. And while, of course, even the greatest and best doctors can\r\nnot assume that very intimate relation with more than a certain number\r\nof people (though it is to be said that more than any other man, the\r\ndoctor does commonly assume such a relation to many people)—while it\r\nis impossible this relation in its closest form shall obtain between\r\na doctor and more than a certain number of people, still with every\r\npatient with whom the doctor is thrown at all intimately he has this\r\npeculiar relation to a greater or less extent. The effect that the\r\ndoctor has upon the body of the patient is in very many cases no\r\ngreater than the effect that he has upon the patient’s mind. Each one\r\nof you here has resting upon him not only a great responsibility for\r\nthe care of the body of the officer or enlisted man who will be under\r\nhis supervision, but a care—which ought not to be too consciously\r\nshown, but which should be unconsciously felt—for the man’s spirit. The\r\nmorale of the entire ship’s company, of the entire body of men with\r\nwhich you are to be thrown, will be sensibly affected by the way in\r\nwhich each of you does his duty.\r\n\r\nJust as the great doctor, the man who stands high in his profession\r\nin any city, counts as one of the most valuable assets in that city’s\r\ncivic work, so in the Navy or the Army the effect of having thoroughly\r\nwell-trained men with a high and sensitive standard of professional\r\nhonor and professional duty is wellnigh incalculable upon the service\r\nitself. I want you now, as you graduate, to feel that on your shoulders\r\nrests a great weight of responsibility; that your position is one of\r\nhigh honor, and that it is impossible to hold a position of high honor\r\nand not hold it under penalty of incurring the severest reprobation if\r\nyou fail to live up to its requirements.\r\n\r\nI am not competent to speak save in the most general terms of your\r\nprofessional duties. I do want, however, to call your attention to one\r\nor two features connected with them. In the first place: In connection\r\nwith the work you do for the service you have certain peculiar\r\nadvantages in doing work that will be felt for the whole profession.\r\nFor instance, it will fall to your lot to deal with certain types of\r\ntropical diseases. You will have to deal with them as no ordinary\r\nAmerican doctor, no matter how great his experience, will have to deal\r\nwith them, and you should fit yourselves by most careful study and\r\npreparation, so that you shall not only be able to grapple with the\r\ncases as they come up, but in grappling with them to make and record\r\nobservations upon them that will be of permanent value to your fellows\r\nin civil life. You can there do what no civilian doctor can possibly\r\ndo. There probably is not a branch of the profession into which, during\r\nyour career, you will not have to go; no type of disease that you will\r\nnot have to treat. But there are certain diseases you will have to\r\ntreat that the ordinary man who stays at home, of course, does not; and\r\nit is of consequence to the entire medical profession that you should\r\nso fit yourself by study, by preparation, that you shall not only be\r\nable to deal with those cases, but to deal with them in a way that will\r\nbe of advantage to your stay-at-home brethren.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point. Every effort should, of course, be made\r\nto provide you with ample means to do your work. Every effort ought\r\nto be made to persuade the National Legislature to take that view\r\nof the situation; to remember that in case of war it is out of the\r\nquestion to improvise a great medical service for the Army and the\r\nNavy. The need of the increase would be more keenly felt in the Army\r\nthan in the Navy, because it is always the Army that undergoes the\r\ngreatest expansion in time of war. But it is felt in both services.\r\nAnd when, as is perfectly certain to be the case if ever a war comes,\r\nand if we have made no greater preparation than at present, there is\r\nfever in the camps, there is sickness among the volunteer forces, it\r\nwill be mere dishonest folly for the public men, and especially for\r\nthe public press, to shriek against the people who happen to be in\r\npower at that time. Let them, if ever such occasion arises, solemnly\r\nthink over and repent of the fact that they have not made their\r\nrepresentatives provide adequately in advance for the medical system\r\nin its personnel and its material, for the organization, and for the\r\nphysical instruments necessary to make that organization effective.\r\nOnly adequate preparation in advance will obviate the trouble which\r\notherwise is certain to come if we have a war. Let critics remember not\r\nto blame the people in power when such a breakdown comes, but to blame\r\nthemselves, the people of the United States, because they have not had\r\nthe forethought to take the steps in advance which would prevent such\r\nbreakdown from occurring.\r\n\r\nMeans ought to be provided in advance. That is part of our duty. If we\r\nfail in it then it is our responsibility, not yours. But now for your\r\nduty. I want to impress, with all the strength that in me lies, upon\r\nevery medical man in either the Army or the Navy, to remember always\r\nthat in any time of crisis the chances are that you will have to work\r\nwith imperfect implements. And your conduct will then afford a pretty\r\ngood test of your worth. If you sit down and do nothing but say you\r\ncould have done excellently if only you had had the right implements\r\nto work with, you will show your unfitness for your position. Your\r\nbusiness will be to do the very best you can do, if you have nothing in\r\nthe world but a jack-knife to do it with. Keep before your minds all\r\nthe time that when the crisis occurs it is almost sure to be the case\r\nthat you will have to do no small part of your work with make-shifts;\r\nto do it, as I myself saw at Santiago the Army physicians do their\r\nwork, roughly and hastily, when worn out with fatigue and having but\r\none-fourth or one-fifth of the appliances that they would expect\r\nnormally to have. Make up your mind that while you will do all you can\r\nto get the best material together in advance, you will not put forward\r\nthe lack of that material as an excuse for not doing the best work\r\npossible with imperfect tools. Make it a matter of pride to do your\r\nutmost, without regard to the inadequacy of your instruments.\r\n\r\nI am sure that all of us outsiders here realize the weight of\r\nresponsibility resting upon those who now join the great and honorable\r\nbody of men who in the Navy and in the Army have by their actions\r\nupheld not only the standard of honor of the medical profession, but\r\nthe standard of honor of the officers of the Army and the Navy of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nI greet you on your entrance into the service. I welcome you as\r\nservants of the Nation, and I wish you every success in the great and\r\nhonorable calling which you have chosen as yours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT OUTDOOR MEETING AT DALLAS, TEX., APRIL 5, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mayor; and you, My Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nIt has been indeed a pleasure for me to come to-day within the limits\r\nof your mighty and beautiful State. This afternoon I have been\r\ntraveling through a veritable garden of the Lord. It is only a few\r\nweeks ago that I did my part in helping on the growth here when I\r\nsigned the bill under which the Trinity River will be improved, which\r\nI was mighty glad to do. For I think that we Americans have learned\r\nthe lesson that whatever is good for some of us is good for all of\r\nus. We are all going to go up, and not down, because we are going to\r\ngo together. I have been impressed even more than by the beauty and\r\nfertility of your State by the character of its people. Surely no\r\nPresident could be more touched by any greeting than by a greeting\r\nsuch as this; and above all (I know the others of you will not mind my\r\nsaying) to be greeted by the men who, when the hour of trial came in\r\n1861, sprang to arms, and whether they wore the blue, or whether they\r\nwore the gray, proved the sincerity of their devotion by the valor\r\nwith which they risked their lives. Oh, my fellow-countrymen, think\r\nwhat a blessed thing it is that now every man in this land can feel the\r\nsame pride in the valor and devotion of those who fought for one side\r\nand of those who fought for the other! I can, in a sense, claim to be,\r\nby blood at least, a typical President, for I am half Southern and half\r\nNorthern; I was born in the East and I have lived much in and learned\r\nmuch from the West.\r\n\r\nThe Civil War has left us as a heritage of honor not merely the memory\r\nof the mighty deeds done in it alike by the men of the North and the\r\nmen of the South; it has left us also as an inspiration and a memory\r\nthe way in which when the war was over those men turned to the works of\r\npeace, and wrought out in peace success exactly as they had wrought it\r\nout in war.\r\n\r\nI come to Texas not for the first time. Seven years ago, again there\r\nwas a call to arms, a call to arms against a foreign foe. It then\r\nfell to my lot to come here to help in raising a regiment, a regiment\r\nin which I think over half of the men had fathers who served in the\r\nConfederate army, and about one-third, perhaps somewhat more, fathers\r\nwho served in the Union army. We were the sons of the men who wore the\r\nblue, the sons of the men who wore the gray, and our only desire was to\r\nshow ourselves not wholly unworthy of the mighty men of the years that\r\nare past.\r\n\r\nYou of this State of Texas have behind you a history containing the\r\ndeeds of which not only you but all of the country must be forever\r\nproud. My regiment was raised under the walls of that historic building\r\nof which it was said that “Thermopylæ had its messengers of death, but\r\nthe Alamo had none.” You, the men of Texas, like the men of Oregon\r\nand California, like the men of Kentucky and Tennessee in a previous\r\ngeneration, did your part in changing this Nation from a string of\r\nAtlantic seaboard commonwealths into a people bounded only by a\r\ncontinent. No people more than the Texans have rendered it impossible\r\nfor this country to be anything but great. It is not open to us to\r\nchoose whether we shall play a small part or a great part. Your fathers\r\nhelped to make that choice impossible. Play a great part we must. All\r\nthat we can decide is whether we shall play it well or ill; and I know\r\ntoo well, oh, my fellow-countrymen, not to know what your decision will\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nThe problems change. One generation faces different difficulties from\r\nthe difficulties faced by its predecessors. But the spirit in which\r\nthose problems must be faced is forever the same. You, the men of the\r\nCivil War, who wrought deeds of deathless fame, who left memories\r\nof honor that will last as long as this Nation endures, fought with\r\nmuzzle-loading, percussion-cap muskets and rifles, with cannon that\r\nyou could afford to put out in the open when you wanted to shoot\r\nat the foe. You fought still in the shoulder-to-shoulder tactics.\r\nNowadays men must fight with different weapons; men must fight with\r\ndifferent tactics; but the spirit in which they must fight if they\r\nare to win must be the spirit that sustained you alike in triumph and\r\ndefeat. The outward problem changes, the outward means of solving that\r\nproblem changes, but the heart of the man who is to solve it can not\r\nbe changed. We must show as a Nation now the same spirit that has been\r\nshown by the mighty men of times past under penalty of failure; show it\r\nin war if the need arises; and we must also show it in peace; show it\r\nin the days that are with us all the time instead of waiting for the\r\nheroic days that may never come.\r\n\r\nJust as in time of war the man who does his duty in camp, on the march,\r\nwho does not throw away his blanket at noon because it is heavy, and\r\nthen wishes that he had two at midnight, is the type of man who makes\r\nthe best soldier in the long run; so it is true that in civil life the\r\nman who does his duty as a citizen in the long run is the man who does\r\nhis ordinary work day by day, doing each day’s duty, great or small,\r\nbehaving as he should toward his wife, toward his children, toward his\r\nneighbor, in his business, in his home; and if he does those duties\r\nwell the sum of the duties performed means that he is a good citizen.\r\n\r\nI want you men of Texas, you men of my age, to see to it that exactly\r\nas you lift your heads higher because of what your fathers have done,\r\nso your children have the right to hold their heads higher because\r\nof the way in which you handle yourselves. A glorious memory is the\r\nbest of all things for a nation if it spurs that nation on to try to\r\nrise level with that memory. It is a poor thing for a nation if it\r\nuses the memory of the past to excuse it for inaction or failure in\r\nthe present. Keep it before yourselves ever that the very fact that\r\nyou are proud of those who have gone before makes it incumbent upon\r\nyou to leave a heritage of honor to those who are to come after you,\r\nand to train up those who are to come after you so that they can do\r\ntheir work in the world. One of the things that has pleased me most in\r\npassing through the part of your State that I have passed through this\r\nafternoon was to see the care that you are giving to the education of\r\nthe children, to see the public schools and the private schools that\r\nyou have built and in which your boys and girls are being trained.\r\nDo not forget that besides the training of the school must come the\r\ntraining in the family. Take care the next generation is able to rise\r\nlevel to its duty. You can not make it rise level if you do not give\r\nit the proper training. Remember always that this life is certain\r\nto contain much that is hard, much that is unpleasant. It is not a\r\nkindness to the children, it is a curse, if you train them so that\r\nthey can not meet any need that arises. I do not believe that we ought\r\never to try to delude ourselves with the thought that we can make life\r\neasy, effortless, and yet keep it worth having. For a nation as for an\r\nindividual the life is the life of effort. You have made this great\r\nState of Texas what it is because your forefathers had in them the\r\nspirit which recognized in a difficulty something not to be flinched\r\nfrom, but to be overcome.\r\n\r\nI can not sufficiently thank you for the way you have greeted me\r\nto-day. I am more touched than I can express by it. I come to the soil\r\nof this State, hallowed by the great deeds of great men, I come knowing\r\nyour people already and believing in them with my heart and soul. A\r\ncouple of years ago I went from the Atlantic to the Pacific. I have\r\nnow come down to this mighty State, this wonderful commonwealth, which\r\nborders on the Gulf, and I shall go away with the feeling that after\r\nall, while there are small differences among us, the fundamental fact\r\nis that wherever you find the average American, the average American\r\nis a pretty good man. It is our unity, not our divergency, that is the\r\ngreat fundamental fact of our national life. I shall go away a stronger\r\nand better American for having been in this State of strong and good\r\nAmericans, this mighty commonwealth of Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET AT DALLAS, TEX., APRIL 5, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Toastmaster, and you, My Hosts_:\r\n\r\nBefore I came to Texas I knew the generous hospitality which is one of\r\nyour chief characteristics, and I anticipated a good reception, but\r\nneither I nor any one else could have anticipated such a reception, and\r\nit has touched me and pleased me more than I can well say. I think I\r\nwas a middling good American before I came here, but I go away an even\r\nbetter one.\r\n\r\nMr. Simpson spoke of the fact that nearly seven years ago I came to\r\nthis State to take part in raising a volunteer regiment. Many among you\r\nwho served on one side or the other in the Civil War will remember the\r\nnumber of things that you did not know at the beginning. If you will\r\ntake that lack of knowledge and multiply it by two you will get a fair\r\nestimate of what I and the regiment did not know when we started. That\r\nwe learned something I hope is true.\r\n\r\nI want to say a word of serious thanks to you, and a word as to my\r\naccountability as a steward to you. No man is fit to hold the position\r\nof President of the United States at all unless as President he feels\r\nthat he represents no party but the people as a whole. So far as in me\r\nlies I have tried and shall try so to handle myself that every decent\r\nAmerican citizen can feel that I have at least made the effort. Each\r\nman has got to carry out his own principles in his own way. If he tries\r\nto model himself on some one else he will make a poor show of it. My\r\nown view has been that if I must choose between taking risks by not\r\ndoing a thing or by doing it, I will take the risks of doing it.\r\n\r\nI have been a very close student of Texan history. The history of\r\nyour State has always held a peculiar fascination for me. I had begun\r\ncertain historic studies connected with the growth of our Western\r\npeople many years ago, before I took much of a part in public life.\r\n\r\nHowever little some of you may now agree with me, when you come to\r\ntake into account what I have done in the Caribbean Sea, in future you\r\nwill find that I have been carrying out the doctrine of the Texans who\r\nmade Texas what it is. Especially as regards what was done in Panama, I\r\nwant to say that while I was most anxious to deserve the approval of my\r\ncountrymen, and while I was very glad to be elected President, I would\r\nwithout one moment’s hesitation have given up the second term in the\r\nPresidency rather than not to have begun the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\nNow in the same way with our internal affairs; take what the\r\ntoastmaster was kind enough to say as to my standing for a square deal.\r\nI want that understood literally. I do not want it exaggerated on one\r\nside or the other. When I say I believe in a square deal I do not mean,\r\nand nobody who speaks the truth can mean, that he believes it possible\r\nto give every man the best hand. If the cards do not come to any man,\r\nor if they do come, and he has not got the power to play them, that is\r\nhis affair. All I mean is that there shall not be any crookedness in\r\nthe dealing. In other words, it is not in the power of any human being\r\nto devise legislation or administration by which each man shall achieve\r\nsuccess and have happiness; it not only is not in the power of any man\r\nto do that, but if any man says that he can do it, distrust him as a\r\nquack. If the hand of the Lord is heavy upon any man, if misfortune\r\ncomes upon him, he may be unable to win; or even if fortune favors him\r\nand he lacks the courage, the nerve, the common-sense, the ability, to\r\ndo the best with the chance given him, then he will fail. All any of us\r\ncan pretend to do is to come as near as our imperfect abilities will\r\nallow to securing through governmental agencies an equal opportunity\r\nfor each man to show the stuff that is in him; and that must be done\r\nwith no more intention of discrimination against the rich man than the\r\npoor man, or against the poor man than the rich man; with the intention\r\nof safeguarding each man, rich or poor, poor or rich, in his rights,\r\nand giving him as nearly as may be a fair chance to do what his powers\r\npermit him to do; always provided he does not wrong his neighbor.\r\n\r\nThis is not in the least a partisan question. It is one of those\r\nquestions that affect all our citizens, a question that goes to the\r\nroot of our citizenship; and when it comes to a question like that you\r\ncitizens of this country have the right to expect your representatives\r\nin public life to join hands and work for the common good and without\r\nregard to any mere party differences. As to the details of carrying out\r\nthose general principles we can not expect everybody to agree. My own\r\nviews are pretty definite, both about foreign and domestic policies.\r\nIn foreign policies, for instance, I have this strong belief, which I\r\nam sure will appeal to every cow-man present—never draw, unless you\r\nmean to shoot; and that implies, of course, that when you draw it shall\r\nnot be an empty gun. Do not speak impolitely, disrespectfully of other\r\nnations. Always treat them with courtesy. Remember that nobody likes\r\nto be insulted. One would rather be wronged than insulted; and this\r\nis just as true internationally as among individuals. Always speak\r\ncourteously; be dead sure you are right before going into trouble;\r\nbeing in, see it through.\r\n\r\nAs a corollary to that, if you need a weapon which you can not possibly\r\nimprovise, get it ready in advance. The individual who gets into\r\ntrouble and then thinks he will go and buy a six-shooter is left. He\r\ndoes not want to get into trouble unless he has the six-shooter. It is\r\njust so with us. We have built up and are building up a pretty good\r\nnavy. If we had not done that and were not doing it, I for one would\r\nnot have recommended going into the Panama business, and I would not\r\nadvocate the Monroe Doctrine, for I do not intend to go into anything\r\nand make a bluff and then have the bluff called and not be able to make\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIn the same way when you come to internal affairs; I have advocated\r\ngiving the Interstate Commerce Commission increased power; power that\r\nwill enable it to work effectively and quickly. I should not do that\r\nfor one moment if I believed that there would be injustice done to the\r\nrailroads by the Interstate Commerce Commission. I wish it understood\r\ndefinitely that if I find any subordinate of mine doing an injustice\r\nagainst a railroad, or doing an injustice for it, I will cinch him just\r\nas quickly in one case as in the other. I shall expect him to do the\r\nsquare thing, both by the railroad and by the public. If the railroad\r\nwants more than it is entitled to have, then he must decide against it;\r\nif the public ignorantly demands that the railroad shall do more than\r\nit can with propriety do, then just as fearlessly he must antagonize\r\npublic sentiment, even if the public sentiment is unanimous.\r\n\r\nThese are the general principles. It is much easier to lay down general\r\nprinciples than it is to work out those principles in detail. But\r\nI have told you substantially what are, as I regard them, the main\r\nfeatures of the platform upon which I stand, and I think that you agree\r\nwith me that it is a pretty straight American platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF TEXAS, AUSTIN, TEX., APRIL 6, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Governor, Mr. Speaker, Mr. President pro tem., Senators, and Members\r\n  of the House of Representatives, and all of you, men and women of\r\n  Texas, those whom I am so proud to call my Fellow-Americans_:\r\n\r\nNo President of the United States, no good American proud of his\r\ncountry, could enter this Capitol and stand in this hall without\r\nfeeling a certain thrill of pride in his citizenship, and in the\r\nhistory of the country’s past. This building in which we are now is\r\nnot only one of the largest but one of the most beautiful of its kind\r\nthroughout the world. It is eminently fitting that so great a State\r\nshould have so fine a capitol building.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two things that I would like particularly to say in\r\nthis chamber, and to the members of the Texas Legislature. I received a\r\ncopy of the resolution passed by your body, introduced, I understand,\r\nby ex-Minister Terrell, in reference to the passage of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Act. I wish to thank you most heartily for what you did.\r\nI think, Governor, Mr. Speaker, and gentlemen, that the longer our\r\nexperience in public office is, the more we realize that at least\r\nninety-five per cent, if not more, in importance, of the work done by\r\nany public officer who is worth his salt has nothing whatever to do\r\nwith partisan politics. The things that concern us all as good citizens\r\nare infinitely larger than the matters concerning which we are divided\r\none from the other along party lines. Fundamentally our attitude in\r\nour foreign affairs and in reference to foreign nations must in the\r\nlong run, if we are to be successful as a people, be based upon certain\r\ncommon-sense rules of conduct, the identical rules upon which every\r\nself-respecting citizen must base his private actions.\r\n\r\nThis is equally true as regards all questions dealing with capital and\r\nlabor; and especially with those dealings with the great aggregates of\r\ncapital usually to be found in corporate form through which so much\r\nof our business at the present day is conducted. It is essential, in\r\ndealing thus by legislative action with corporate wealth, or indeed\r\nwith wealth in any form, that we remember and act upon certain rules\r\nsimple enough and commonplace enough to state, but not always easy to\r\nact upon. Most emphatically we can not as good Americans bear hostility\r\nto any rich man as such any more than to any poor man as such. My\r\nexperience has been that the man who talks over-loudly of his hostility\r\nto corporate wealth can not be trusted even to antagonize corporate\r\nwealth when it is wrong. Let us be moderate in our statements; but let\r\nus make our deeds bear out absolutely our words.\r\n\r\nWith this preliminary I would like to say in brief just what my\r\nposition is as regards the particular question with which I had to deal\r\nand as regards which the Texas Legislature took the action I so much\r\nappreciate.\r\n\r\nOn the whole there have been few instruments in the economic\r\ndevelopment of the country which have done more for the country than\r\nthe railroads. I do not wish in any shape or way to interfere with\r\nthe legitimate gain of any of the big men whose special industrial\r\ncapacity enables them to handle the railroads so as to be of profit to\r\nthemselves and of advantage to all of us. I should be most reluctant—I\r\nwill put it stronger than that—I should absolutely refuse to be a party\r\nto any measure, to any proposition, that interfered with the proper\r\nand legitimate prosperity of those men; and I should feel that such a\r\nmeasure was aimed not only at them, but at all of us, for any attack\r\nupon the legitimate prosperity of any of us is in the long run sure\r\nto turn into an attack upon all. With that proviso (as to which I ask\r\nyou to remember that I mean literally every word) let me further add\r\nthat the public has the right (not a privilege, but in my view a duty)\r\nto see that there is on its behalf exercised such supervisory and\r\nregulatory power over the railroads as will ensure that while they get\r\nfair treatment themselves, they give it in return. The proper exercise\r\nof that power is conditioned upon the securing of proper legislation,\r\nwhich will enable the representatives of the public to see to it that\r\nany unjust or oppressive or discriminating rate is altered, so as to be\r\na just and fair rate, and is altered immediately.\r\n\r\nI know well that when you give that power there is a chance of its\r\nbeing occasionally abused. There is no power that can be given to the\r\nrepresentatives of the people which it is not possible to abuse. As\r\nevery one knows, the power of taxation, which must of course be given\r\nto the representatives of the people, is the power of death, for it is\r\npossible to kill any industry by excessive taxation. There must be a\r\ncertain trust placed in the common-sense and common honesty of those\r\nwho are to enforce the law. If it ever falls, and I think it will, to\r\nmy lot to nominate a board to carry out such a law, I shall nominate\r\nmen, as far as I am able, on whose ability, courage, and integrity\r\nI can count, men who will not be swayed by any influence whatever,\r\ndirect or indirect, social, political, or any other, to show improper\r\nfavoritism to any railroad, and who, on the other hand, if a railroad\r\nis unjustly attacked, no matter if that attack has behind it the\r\nfeeling of prejudice of ninety-nine per cent of the people, will stand\r\nup against that attack. That is my interpretation of the doctrine of\r\nthe square deal.\r\n\r\nI want to say just one word more on an entirely different subject. I\r\nhave always taken a very great interest in the National Guard in this\r\ncountry. It is our pride that we have the smallest possible regular\r\narmy. There is not another first-class power, there is not a second\r\nor third class power in the world that has not got relatively to its\r\npopulation and wealth a very much larger regular army than we have.\r\nWe do not need anything but a small regular army. We need and must\r\nand shall have the very best regular army of its size that is to\r\nbe found anywhere. We do not need a large regular army, because of\r\nthe possibilities of our people in raising volunteer troops. Those\r\npossibilities are largely conditioned upon the excellence of the\r\nNational Guard. Since I have been in Texas, at almost every stopping\r\nplace there have been members of the National Guard, companies of the\r\nNational Guard out to do duty in connection with keeping the crowds\r\nin order, in preventing any trouble of any kind, keeping the whole\r\nproceedings orderly and proper. I have been immensely struck with their\r\nsoldier-like efficiency. It is only what I ought to expect. When I was\r\nlast in Texas I was engaged with certain others in raising a volunteer\r\nregiment, and as I think I know a good thing when I see it, I got just\r\nas many Texans as possible in that regiment.\r\n\r\nYour whole history, from the days of Austin and Houston and Davy\r\nCrockett, right to the present time, shows what fighting material\r\nthe average Texan makes. But I do not care how good the material, it\r\nis not going to amount to much if it is not given a chance. It is a\r\nmost important thing for all of us, if we desire to keep the regular\r\narmy small, that we shall have the militia, the National Guard of the\r\nseveral States, kept up to a proper point. Last year, I am happy to be\r\nable to say, that, at the manœuvres of the regulars, your Texan troops\r\ndid admirably. I have been told again and again how well they did. I\r\nwant to congratulate you upon the excellent law for the administration\r\nof the National Guard that has recently been passed by the Texas\r\nLegislature. With that law backed up by a sufficient appropriation to\r\nmake it available, you can count upon having the Texas National Guard a\r\nmodel for the National Guard of the country.\r\n\r\nI feel very much at home here: I have been Governor, and I have served\r\nin the Legislature, so I have a good deal of fellow-feeling with all of\r\nyou. I have had for a good many years to grapple with just about the\r\nproblems you are grappling with from time to time here; and I know, as\r\nany man who has taken part in active work must know, how easy it is for\r\nthe outsider to say that everything should be managed perfectly, and\r\nhow difficult it is in practice to get even fairly good results. There\r\nis a heap of difference between the critic, the onlooker on one side,\r\nand on the other the doer, the man who does the job.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTSIDE OF CAPITOL BUILDING, AUSTIN, TEX., APRIL 6, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Governor; and you, My Fellow-Citizens_:\r\n\r\nI have been particularly pleased to be greeted wherever I have gone\r\nby the great masses of school children, the children from the public\r\nschools and the children from the higher institutions of learning,\r\nState and private. It is a mere truism to say that the prime work of\r\nany State should be to keep up and raise ever higher its standard\r\nof citizenship. Texas has a right to be proud of its industrial\r\ndevelopment and of its wonderful natural resources, but I tell you the\r\nbest crop for any State to rear after all is the crop of men and women.\r\nI believe in the future of Texas so heartily because I believe that you\r\nare steadily taking measures for the uptraining of the children, for\r\nthe uptraining of the generations that in a very few years will take\r\nour places and rule the destinies of the State.\r\n\r\nNo State can be great without paying the penalty of responsibility\r\nthat comes with greatness. That is true of the Nation; it is true\r\nlikewise of the States that go to make up the Nation. You have here in\r\nTexas a commonwealth which in area and diversification of resources\r\nalready stands unequaled, which in population and wealth will soon be\r\none of the three or four first in the entire land. That means that\r\nbesides feeling exaltation about it you ought to have a very heavy\r\nsense of responsibility entailed upon you thereby. No man can do any\r\nwork worth doing except at the cost of effort, of self-restraint, of\r\nforcing himself to achieve things. No State can do anything except by\r\npossessing just those qualities, because the State is of course simply\r\nthe aggregate of the individuals within it. If Texas fails in any way\r\nthe failure will be felt by the entire country, because its influence\r\nand its power are so great. There is no royal road to good government;\r\nand I think all those interested in managing your public affairs\r\nwill agree with me that what we need in our public officials is not\r\ngenius, not even brilliancy, so much as the exercise of the ordinary\r\nrather commonplace qualities of honesty, courage, and common-sense—the\r\nqualities that make a man a good husband, a good father, a good\r\nneighbor; that make it advantageous to have dealings with him in\r\nbusiness, or make it worth while having him as a friend. These are the\r\nqualities which are fundamental, which should be shown by the man who\r\nhas to do with public life; and do not forget that each one of you\r\nhere has to do his share in governing this commonwealth. It is not a\r\nfigure of speech, it is the literal fact that in the United States\r\nevery man is a sovereign. Remember that the fate of the sovereign who\r\ndoes not do his duty is to get dethroned; and if the average man who is\r\nsovereign does not do his duty he will get ousted from his sovereignty.\r\nIf a man can not govern himself he will find a boss or some one else\r\nwho can govern him, and then do not blame the boss, blame yourself for\r\nnot having the self-control, the resolution, the forethought, and\r\nthe sense of civic duty which would make you do your full part in the\r\nwork of governing this country. We will not lose our birthright of\r\ncitizenship unless by our own fault. If the average man keeps his head\r\nand his wits, and if he takes a little pains, he will be governed just\r\nabout the way he desires to be governed. If he is not governed that\r\nway do not let him sit down and blame the politicians, let him blame\r\nhimself, for it is in his power to get any government that he seriously\r\ndesires to have. My fellow-citizens, together with expressing the\r\nexultation that we have a right to express about our country, we need\r\nto have impressed upon us a sense of our own responsibility, and of the\r\nshortcomings of which we are guilty if we do not rise level to that\r\nresponsibility. It is a very good thing that we should gather together\r\non state occasions, on the 4th of July, and at public festivals, and\r\nhear speakers say how big a country we have. But it is a better thing\r\nif we will go home and think over certain of the shortcomings that all\r\nof us have and make up our minds to remedy them in the future. What I\r\nask of you and what I most firmly believe you will give is a patriotic\r\nperseverance in doing each his average round of duties, in doing the\r\nduties both of private life and as a citizen in public affairs each\r\nday. Do not wait for some special time when heroism will be called for,\r\nbut do unweariedly the humdrum work that comes to every man. If we will\r\ndo that, we will find that the affairs of state will be settled as we\r\ndesire to have them settled. There is no use sitting at home finding\r\nfault with the way in which public affairs are handled, and then every\r\nfour years, in a burst of animosity against some person, voting to\r\nturn him out. What you need to do is, month in and month out, year in\r\nand year out, to do your ordinary political duties as those political\r\nduties come up, and only under such conditions can you get really good\r\npublic servants.\r\n\r\nLet me say one more word of warning. In public life you will sometimes\r\nencounter a man who will endeavor to lead you to do something which\r\ndown at bottom you doubt being right, which he tells you will be to\r\nyour advantage to do, usually something that looks like wronging some\r\none else. But the man who will wrong some one else for your advantage\r\nwill, when the chance comes, be sure to wrong you for his own advantage.\r\n\r\nMy fellow-citizens, my fellow-Americans, I address you here under the\r\nshadow of your beautiful capitol of this great and wonderful State,\r\nwith its heroic memories of Austin, of Sam Houston, of Davy Crockett,\r\nof all the men who in picture or in statue are commemorated on these\r\nwalls; and my strongest feeling is that, proud though you are of Texas,\r\nyou can not be prouder of it than I am. One of the great and splendid\r\nfeatures of our American life is that each American has a right to be\r\nproud of the deeds of every other American, no matter from what part of\r\nthe country his fellow-American may come. Your honor, your glory, are\r\nthe honor and the glory of every man of our great country. All that is\r\nnecessary for our people is that they should get to know one another in\r\norder to appreciate how slight are the divergencies and how vital and\r\nfundamental is the union among them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN FRONT OF THE ALAMO, SAN ANTONIO, TEX., APRIL 7, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. Mayor; Mr. Kirkpatrick; and you, My Fellow-Americans of this\r\n  mighty Commonwealth_:\r\n\r\nI thank you for the way in which I have been greeted to-day. You can\r\nhardly imagine how much it means to me to come back to San Antonio in\r\nthis way, and to be received as you have received me. I know that the\r\nrest of you will not grudge my saying a special word of acknowledgment\r\nto two sets among your citizens; first to the men of the great war,\r\nto the men who wore the blue or wore the gray in the days that tried\r\nmen’s souls. My fellow-citizens, infinitely more important than any\r\nPresident, infinitely more important even than the reception to any\r\nPresident, is what is symbolized by seeing the men who fought in the\r\nUnion army and the men who fought in the Confederate army standing\r\nmingled together, fellow-Americans, one in devotion and honor and\r\nloyalty to the country, shoulder to shoulder as fellow-citizens of the\r\nmightiest republic upon which the sun has ever shone. Indeed the man\r\nwould have a poor heart, a poor spirit, who would not be thrilled by\r\nsuch a meeting as this, by such a sight as you accord me to-day, you\r\nof the gray, you of the blue, all one under the flag of this reunited\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI suppose you must know it, but I want to tell you that it was of\r\ncourse the memory of the valor, the self-sacrifice, the endurance you\r\ndisplayed in the great war, that made us of the younger generation\r\nfeel that when the lesser war came we wished to emulate your course.\r\nThe regiment which I had the honor to command, and which was raised\r\nand organized in this city, took part in what were only skirmishes\r\ncompared with the campaigns in which you did your share; and all that\r\nwe claim is that while it was not given to us to have the chance to\r\ndo great deeds, yet we hope we made you feel that the old spirit was\r\nnot altogether lost. This regiment served under men who had themselves\r\nfought in the Civil War, both under Grant and under Lee. The commander\r\nof the cavalry division was that gallant ex-Confederate soldier,\r\nMajor-General Joseph Wheeler; and our immediate commander, our brigade\r\ncommander, was an ex-Union soldier, who entered the Union army as\r\na private, and to whom for my great good fortune it befell me to\r\nsign the commission as Lieutenant-General of the army of the United\r\nStates—Lieutenant-General Young. Afterward at San Juan the cavalry\r\nserved under General Sumner, from whom I took my orders.\r\n\r\nI can not say how much it meant to me to be able to take part in\r\nraising that regiment under the shadow of the Alamo. My admiration for\r\nTexas and Texans is no new thing. Since I have been a boy and first\r\nstudied the history of this country my veins have thrilled and tingled\r\nas I read of the mighty deeds of Houston, of Bowie, of Crockett, of\r\nTravis, of the men who were victorious at the fight at San Jacinto, of\r\nthe even more glorious men who fell in the fight of the Alamo, of which\r\nit was said, “Thermopylæ had its messengers of death, but the Alamo had\r\nnone.”\r\n\r\nI remember so well seven years ago when we were raising this regiment,\r\nriding in here one day to see the Alamo, and going away feeling that\r\ncome what would I was going to try to handle myself so that there\r\nshould no disgrace come to the memory of the Americans who died there.\r\nI want you to remember that ours was a volunteer regiment and a small\r\nwar, and that we do not claim any credit for what we did more than\r\nfalls to the lot of any number of other people. All we ask of you is to\r\nbelieve that we tried to show the spirit which would have made us do\r\nthe kind of a job that you of the Civil War did, if the need had arisen.\r\n\r\nI wish to express my acknowledgments for the greeting which I have\r\nreceived here in San Antonio and which I have received throughout the\r\nlength and breadth of Texas. This is the third time I have visited\r\nthis beautiful city—and it is such a beautiful city. I wonder if you\r\nyourselves, proud though you are of it, appreciate the charm it has\r\nto an outsider coming here. It is fifteen years ago that I first\r\ncame here, simply passing through as any number of other travelers\r\npass through, and saw it. Seven years ago when I came here I was\r\nhere strictly on business. When we got back that year from Santiago\r\nI said to the officers of the regiment, “Now we have got to have a\r\nreunion of the regiment in San Antonio.” All kinds of things happened\r\nin between. I have led a middling busy life myself since; and now at\r\nlast the chance has come to make good the promise and to have those of\r\nthe regiment who are able to come together here in the city where the\r\nregiment was raised to greet one another and talk over the past. In\r\na sense we can claim that that regiment was a typical American body.\r\nThe men composing it were raised chiefly in the Southwest, but some\r\nfrom the North, some from the East, so that we had the Northerner and\r\nthe Southerner, the Easterner and the Westerner in that regiment; we\r\nhad men in it who worshiped their Creator some according to one creed,\r\nsome according to another, for almost every religious body of any size\r\nin the United States was represented within our ranks. We had men who\r\nhad been born abroad and men who were born here, whose ancestors came\r\nto what is now the United States at the time of the landing of the\r\nfirst colonists at the mouth of the James or at Plymouth. We had men of\r\ninherited wealth and men who all their lives long had earned each day’s\r\nbread by that day’s toil. We had men of every grade socially; men who\r\nworked with their heads; men who worked with their hands; men of all\r\nthe types that our country produces; but each of them glad to get in on\r\nhis worth as a man only, and content to be judged purely by what he\r\ncould show himself to be.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to me that one of the greatest lessons taught by\r\nthe Civil War was the lesson of brotherhood. You, my friends, who wore\r\nthe blue; you, my friends, who wore the gray, what each of you when he\r\nwent forward to battle was concerned with about the man on his right\r\nhand and the man on his left was not what that man’s ancestry was, not\r\nas to how he worshiped his Maker, not as to what his profession was, or\r\nhis means; what you wanted to know was whether he would stay put. If he\r\ndid you were for him, and if he did not you were against him.\r\n\r\nThe same thing that was true in the great war is true in time of peace.\r\nThis Government is emphatically a government by the people, for the\r\npeople, of the people. Now, besides applauding that sentiment, let us\r\nlive up to it. It has two sides to it. In the first place, it applies\r\nin a dozen different directions. It applies, for instance, in reference\r\nto creed. We have a right to ask that our neighbor do his duty toward\r\nGod and man; but we have no business to dictate to him how he shall\r\nworship his Maker, and no business to discriminate for or against him\r\nbecause of the way in which he does it. In the same way, if a man is\r\na decent citizen, he is a decent citizen, whether rich or poor. To\r\njudge from some of the talk you occasionally hear, a man can not be a\r\nsquare man if he is rich. Remember always that you listen at your peril\r\nto any man who would seek to inflame you against your fellow-citizen\r\nbecause he is better off. Again, in the Civil War, come back to the\r\nconsideration about your bunkie. You did not care whether he was a\r\nbanker or bricklayer. If he was a banker he was all right if he was\r\na good fellow, if he did his duty in camp, if he did not straggle on\r\nthe march, if he did not drop his share of the joint provisions on\r\nthe march, and then expect you to share yours with him at the end of\r\nthe day. You wanted him to do his part, and if he did it you were\r\nfor him. Now, apply that in civil life. If the rich man does not his\r\nduty, cinch him, and I will help you just as far as I can. But don’t\r\ncinch him because he is a rich man. If you do you are a mighty mean\r\ncreature yourself; you are not a good American yourself. Give him a\r\nperfectly fair show. If he is a poor man and does his duty, help him,\r\nstand by him. If he whines about his poverty and says that he ought to\r\nbe carried, you may just as well make up your mind to drop him then\r\nand there. Every man of us stumbles at times. Every man of us at times\r\nneeds a helping hand stretched out to him; and shame to any man who\r\nwill not stretch out that helping hand to his brother if that brother\r\nneeds it. But if the brother lies down, you can do mighty little in\r\ncarrying him. You can help him up; but once up he has got to walk\r\nhimself. The only way in which you can ever really help any man is to\r\nhelp him to help himself.\r\n\r\nThat brings me to the second set of people here whom I have been most\r\nespecially glad to see and to greet—the children. In the first place,\r\nI believe in them, as you know, and judging by the showing that San\r\nAntonio has made to-day, San Antonio is all right as regards both\r\nquality and quantity. As I like your stock I am glad that it does not\r\nseem likely to die out. In passing through Texas I have been more\r\nimpressed than by anything else by the evident care you are giving to\r\neducation, the evident care given to training your children, the school\r\nfacilities, both for primary and higher education, and the way in which\r\nthose facilities are being taken advantage of. Of course it is a mere\r\ntruism to say that the care of the children is the most important task\r\nof any generation. You have a wonderful empire here in Texas. It is\r\nliterally larger than most Old World empires. Your diversification\r\nof soil and climate, the marvelous fertility of your soil, your\r\nnatural advantages, ensure you a phenomenal future agriculturally and\r\nindustrially, ensure this State a wonderful growth in population and\r\nwealth. All that is essential. You must have the material basis upon\r\nwhich to build as a foundation, but I need not say to you to remember\r\nthat it is only a foundation. The material counts for nothing if you do\r\nnot build upon it the spiritual, if you do not build upon it the things\r\nof the soul, of the mind.\r\n\r\nLet me again take an example from the war. We need arms and equipment,\r\nbut the best rifle ever made does not make a soldier if it has not got\r\nthe right man behind it. You may take the finest modern weapon, put it\r\nin the hands of a weakling or a coward, and a good man will beat him\r\nwith a club. If the other man is a good man too, you want a mighty good\r\nweapon, or you will get beaten. But the weapon does not in any shape or\r\nway serve as a substitute for the spirit of the soldier. That is what\r\ncounts in the last resort. Tactics change, weapons change, but the soul\r\nthat drives a man forward to victory does not change as the ages go\r\nby. The men of the Civil War, alike the men who wore the gray and the\r\nmen who wore the blue, made a record which remains forever a heritage\r\nof honor and of glory for all this people. They did that because they\r\nhad in them the spirit which from time immemorial has made the soldiers\r\nof whom the world is proud, the spirit for the lack of which no other\r\nquality in man or in nation will atone. We of to-day, we who, if a\r\nwar should come, will have to fight under new conditions, with new\r\narms, will win (as assuredly I believe we shall win) only because our\r\nmen still have in them the spirit that made their forefathers do well\r\nin battle. So you must train your children up so that in addition to\r\nhaving what counts for material prosperity in a State, you must have\r\nthe things that tell most for greatness, the things that make for the\r\nsoul of the Nation.\r\n\r\nHere in San Antonio what is the building you are proudest of?—the\r\nAlamo. It is not exactly up to date. Other buildings are more\r\nuseful. But you are proud of it because it commemorates forever the\r\nspirit of those who made its fame immortal. So in the State itself,\r\nimportant though it is to provide for the industrial welfare of the\r\ncommonwealth, the thing that is most important is to take care of the\r\nreally vital crop—the crop of citizens. The thing which the State most\r\nneeds to care for is the welfare, not merely material, but moral and\r\nintellectual as well, of the children who are going to make up the\r\nState fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five years hence; and that is why I am\r\nso glad to see the care which you of Texas are taking in the training\r\nof the generation that is now coming up.\r\n\r\nA thing that is distressing to me to see is when sometimes the man and\r\nwoman who have done well in life show a curious inability to train\r\ntheir own children in the way that has resulted successfully for\r\nthemselves. I think that all of us know people who, because they have\r\nworked hard and triumphed, feel that somehow or other they will spare\r\ntheir children the acquisition of the very qualities which have made\r\nthe parents triumph. Too often you see the man, and I am sorry to say\r\nthe woman, who says, “I have had to work hard; my sons and my daughters\r\nshall have an easy time.” Such a man or woman is preparing ruin for\r\nthe children about whom this is said. Of course, you want to give your\r\nchildren all the love possible; but it is not right to mistake folly\r\nfor affection. When you spare the child that which alone will enable\r\nit to conquer in after life, you are not giving it a blessing; you\r\nare doing it the greatest wrong in your power. Bring up the boy and\r\ngirl alike with the understanding that life is not generally soft, is\r\nnot generally easy, that there will be plenty of rough times, and\r\nthat what they have to show is not the spirit that avoids difficulties\r\nand flinches from them, but the spirit which overcomes them. Let each\r\nof the older among you look back upon your lives. You men of the\r\nCivil War; what are the times of which you are proudest? What are the\r\nmemories you are most glad to hand down to your children and your\r\nchildren’s children? The times that were easy? No. You are proud to\r\nremember and have them remember the days of toil, of peril, of effort,\r\nthe days when you had to risk life and endure every form of hardship\r\nand of labor, when you had in you the spirit that made you endure it,\r\nthat made you rise level to the great need. Surely you must not rob\r\nyour sons of the right to feel in their turn the same pride that you\r\nnow feel in the power to overcome difficulty, the power to work, the\r\npower of wresting triumph out of danger.\r\n\r\nThere is only one of my fellow-citizens to whom I will touch my hat\r\nquicker than to the soldier; and that is the mother, because I think\r\nshe has a little harder time of it. The mother who has brought up as\r\nthey should be brought up a family of young children is entitled to\r\nsuch respect as no other person in the community is entitled to. When\r\nthe end of her life comes she has endured any amount of hardship, the\r\nsitting up by beds of sick children, the endless taking care of them,\r\nfor a mother is not allowed to know the difference between night and\r\nday as far as the ending of the day’s task is concerned; but, after\r\nall, when her life is done she can look back upon it with a prouder\r\nsense of satisfaction than any one else, if she has done her duty, for\r\nher children and her husband shall rise up and call her blessed. The\r\nworthy life for the Nation, for the individual, for the man, for the\r\nwoman, is the life of effort for the things worth striving for; and\r\nour whole aim should be not to teach those who are to come after us to\r\nshirk difficulties, and to strive to have an easy time in life, but to\r\nstrive to do their duty, whether that duty is hard or not, and to feel\r\nthat no success is so great as the success of duty worth doing which is\r\nwell done.\r\n\r\nOf course, that is my conception of the life for the Nation as well as\r\nfor the individual. I am not going to develop my theory about that;\r\nin the first place, because I want to keep clear of anything that you\r\nmight think touched in the faintest degree upon politics, and in the\r\nnext place because I believe you know pretty well how I feel anyway. I\r\nfeel that this Nation, whether it wishes to or not, can not help being\r\na great Nation. You of Texas by what your forefathers did and what you\r\nhave done have helped in making this Nation so that it is impossible\r\nnot to be great. We can not decide whether we will be great or not. The\r\nonly thing we can decide is whether, being great, we will do well or do\r\nill. We have got our duty in the world. We must do our duty to others,\r\nand we must do our duty to ourselves. We must so handle ourselves that\r\nno weak power which is behaving itself shall have cause to fear us;\r\nand no strong power of any kind shall be able to oppress or wrong us.\r\nWe all believe in the Monroe Doctrine. I have a little difficulty in\r\ngetting some of my friends to accept my interpretation of it; but they\r\nwill in time, because that interpretation has come to stay. We are\r\nbuilding the Panama Canal. While that will be a benefit to all the\r\ncountry, it will be of most benefit to the Gulf States. We have duties\r\nin connection with the great position we have taken. We can not shirk\r\nthese duties. We can do them well or do them ill, but do them we must\r\nThat is one reason why I want to see a good navy; and we have got a\r\ngood navy. I am going to use a simile that I used a couple of nights\r\nago at Dallas. In the old days in Texas I understand that there used to\r\nbe a proverb that while you would not generally want a gun at all, if\r\nyou did want it you wanted it quick and you wanted it awfully bad. That\r\nis just the way I feel about the navy. I feel that if we have it the\r\nchances are that we will not need it; but that if we do not have it, we\r\nmight find that our need for it was vital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CONGREGATION ASSEMBLED AT THE BLUE SCHOOLHOUSE ON UPPER DIVIDE\r\nCREEK, COLO., SUNDAY, APRIL 30, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Friends_:\r\n\r\nIt is hard for me not to call you neighbors, for during a number of\r\nyears my neighbors were just such men and women as those I now see\r\nbefore me, and they were as good friends as I ever had. I do not\r\nintend to say more than a few words to-day, but I do wish to tell you\r\nhow thoroughly at home I feel with you, how much I have enjoyed my stay\r\nhere, and how I have appreciated the kind and thoughtful hospitality\r\nwith which I have been treated.\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere in almost every gathering in the West, I see men\r\nwearing the button which shows that they served in the Grand Army of\r\nthe Republic, and carrying the flag which they more than any other men\r\nin this Nation have the right to carry because it is owing to them\r\nthat this Nation has a flag at all. The few words which I have to say\r\nare to be on success, and I wish to illustrate what I mean by taking\r\nthese veterans of the Civil War as examples; and what I am about to\r\nsay was suggested by a conversation I had with the Dominie here, when\r\nhe was with me the other day on a bear hunt. The Grand Army in its\r\norganization is typically and fundamentally American, because in the\r\nGrand Army every man from lieutenant-general to drummer boy is judged\r\nnot by his position, but by the way he discharges or discharged his\r\nduty while in that position. In other words, to the Grand Army man\r\nsuccess, in the highest and truest acceptation of the word, means the\r\nfull performance of duty in whatever position Providence has assigned\r\nthe man to whom the duty comes. Success from the soldier’s standpoint,\r\nif an army is to rank as one of the great armies of all time, must mean\r\nthat whether the man carries sword or musket, whether he looks after\r\nthe mules or the commissary, he does his duty up to the handle. If the\r\nsoldier feels that he has done that, then he has a right to feel that\r\nhis career has been honorable and successful, and that his children’s\r\nchildren will be proud of him. Success had this meaning from 1861 to\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nSo it is in civil life. Real success consists in doing one’s duty well\r\nin the path where one’s life is led. Of course, you must remember\r\nthat to do your duty you must in the first place do it to yourself\r\nand to those that are nearest you. There is no use whatever in having\r\nlofty ambitions or great schemes for helping mankind if you are not\r\nable in the first place to keep yourself and your own family decently\r\nfed, clothed, and housed. You must pull your own weight first before\r\nyou can do more than be a passenger in the boat. You must do what is\r\nright to your family and your neighbors before you can help the State.\r\nIf, however, you have the ordinary humdrum qualities, the workaday\r\nqualities, you can win real success; for real success in civil life\r\nmeans that the man is able to make a living for himself and his family,\r\nto educate his children, to do his duty by his neighbors, and when the\r\nend of his life comes, to be able to feel that the world has been a\r\nlittle better and not a little worse off because he has lived.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the great prizes of life there must always be more\r\nor less accident in winning. No man who has made what the world at\r\nlarge calls a great success can fail to recognize, if he is sincere\r\nwith himself, that there has been much of chance, of fortune, in his\r\ntriumph; and surely this should prevent arrogance on his part, and\r\nshould also prevent any feeling of mean envy toward him on the part of\r\nothers. Carry yourself so that if accident puts great opportunities in\r\nyour way you will be able to take advantage of them, and so that, at\r\nany rate, even if the exceptional opportunities do not come, you can do\r\nthe things that count most for real happiness in life, the things that\r\nin their sum mean the life that is successful, because they make up a\r\nhappy and healthy home. No amount of skill, perseverance, energy, or\r\ngenius can win either the great or the small prizes of life unless back\r\nof them lie character and the courage of moral convictions. With this\r\ncharacter, whether the great opportunity comes or not, you can count\r\nupon so bearing yourselves that your children will bless you for having\r\ndone all that was in your power to bring them up to an honored name.\r\n\r\nSo much for success in private life. Now for the success from the\r\nnational standpoint. In this country of ours the Government can no more\r\nrise higher than those who make it than a stream can rise higher than\r\nits source. No one leader, no set of leaders, can make the Government.\r\nIt will be made by the average citizen, and whether it stands high or\r\nlow will and must depend upon the character of the average citizenship.\r\nOnly this average citizen can make or unmake it. The right type of\r\nleader can guide and help him—in short, can lead him; but he must\r\nhimself be trusted to see to it that his leadership is right, and if\r\nhe has not the right stuff in him, then no leadership will avail him or\r\nany of us. In the Civil War, Grant and Sherman and Farragut rendered\r\nincalculable service; but in the last analysis it was the average man\r\nin the ranks who made the army. If that man had not had the right stuff\r\nin him not all the generalship of the greatest leaders would have\r\navailed to win victory. So it is now. The man who carries the hod or\r\nthe axe or the coupling-pin; the man who holds the plow or the hammer;\r\nthe average man who does the average work of the Nation, is the man\r\nupon whom our whole political and social fabric rests. If he continues\r\nto have the right stuff in him, then as a Nation we shall continue to\r\ngo up. If he surrenders himself to idleness and ignorance, to mean\r\nenvy and mean hate; if he is not thrifty, industrious, energetic and\r\nintelligent; above all, if his moral fibre weakens—then the Republic\r\nwill be in a bad way. There is no secret about good citizenship. The\r\nqualities that make a good citizen are those that the humblest man or\r\nwoman, girl or boy, can have; but they are the qualities upon which the\r\nfoundations of the State rest. Dishonesty, especially if accompanied by\r\nthat unpleasant type of ability without conscientiousness which some\r\npeople deify under the name of “smartness,” is a curse and a disgrace\r\nto the individual and to the community. Honesty is the first quality\r\nfor the individual and for the Nation; and it must be backed up by\r\ncourage—the courage which does not wait before showing itself until\r\nthe heroic days which may never come, but which unflinchingly does\r\neach day that day’s duty, be it easy or hard; and finally it must be\r\nbacked up by the common-sense without which courage and honesty are\r\nof so little avail. The man who is a good husband; the woman who is a\r\ngood wife and mother; the son who so carries himself that the family\r\nare glad to have him at home instead of earnestly wishing he were away;\r\nthe daughter who as she grows up is a help to her mother instead of\r\nan added burden; the family in which tenderness and consideration are\r\nshown for one another, together with the strong, fearless qualities\r\nabsolutely necessary both for man and for woman in this rough, workaday\r\nworld of ours—such men and women, such families, have won the success\r\nthat most counts, and in their aggregate make up the Nation that is\r\nreally successful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE BANQUET OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND BOARD OF TRADE, DENVER,\r\nCOLO., MAY 9, 1905\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. President; Mr. Toastmaster; and you, Men of Denver; Men of\r\nColorado_:\r\n\r\nI hope I need not say how glad I am to be your guest to-night. Let\r\nme say just one word in reference to the work of this organization\r\nof which I am not only the guest, but to which I owe my most sincere\r\nthanks for having elected me to honorary membership. You have done a\r\ngreat work for the material prosperity of this city, of this State.\r\nI fully appreciate, as every sensible man must, the great, the vital\r\nimportance of that work. We must have a basis of material prosperity\r\nbefore any community, whether State, municipality, or nation, can\r\ndevelop itself, can rise in any degree. There must in the community as\r\nin the individual be first as a basis the material prosperity; but woe\r\nto the community, woe to the individual, that accepts such material\r\nprosperity as the be-all and the end-all of its life. In the world at\r\nlarge, and especially in this Nation, we have been passing through an\r\nera of materialism. It has had its good side, and it has had its poor\r\nside; and we of this country will never rise level to the standard\r\nthat should be set here until we not only understand but apply the\r\ntruth that material prosperity is only the foundation, and that its\r\nworth depends entirely upon the kind of moral superstructure of good\r\ncitizenship that we build upon it. No wealth, no material well-being,\r\nshall avail the Nation where class hatreds flourish, where man looks\r\nupon his brother with envy and hatred or with arrogance and contempt,\r\naccording to his position, where the average man fails to understand\r\nthat the supreme good for any man is the granting him the opportunity\r\nand training him to the power to do service to the community at large.\r\nI believe in material well-being, of course; I should be a fool if\r\nI did not. I believe in material well-being; I believe in those who\r\nhave built it up; but I believe also that it is a curse if it is not\r\naccompanied by the lift toward higher things. We of this country;\r\nwe who have enjoyed the marvelous prosperity that this country has\r\npossessed in a degree pre-eminent above all other nations of earth,\r\nmust in the future show our understanding of this doctrine, or we shall\r\nfail to make of the Republic what it must and shall be made—an example\r\nfor all the nations of mankind.\r\n\r\nBut do not think that I fail to understand the importance of our\r\nmaterial well-being. I congratulate Denver with all my heart that it\r\nis the centre of the great mining and livestock industries. It is of\r\nenormous consequence to all our people that any section of this country\r\nshould do well. Do not forget that. So far from its being a hurt to\r\nany one section to see another section prosper, we can on the contrary\r\ncount it as certain that if a part of this country prospers much the\r\nrest of the country will as a whole feel some good effects from the\r\nresult of the prosperity. As Senator Patterson was just saying to me,\r\nwhen three years ago we succeeded in getting through that law which I\r\nam so very proud should have been enacted during my administration,\r\nthe law by which the Nation undertook to do its share in the great\r\nwork of reclamation of the arid lands of the West; when we got through\r\nthat law there were certain shortsighted people, representing as they\r\nbelieved the interests of the non-arid Eastern lands, who objected\r\nto its passage on the ground that it would help build up their\r\nrivals; whereas, they ought to have seen that whatever built up the\r\ninter-mountain States would add to the prosperity of all the United\r\nStates. There is just one safe motto for Americans to act on; that is,\r\nthe motto of all men up; not some men down.\r\n\r\nIn a very small way I am trying to build up an other industry for\r\nthe benefit of the whole country, which we are starting here in\r\nColorado. Through Secretary Wilson of the Department of Agriculture,\r\nin connection with your Agricultural College, we are starting the\r\ndevelopment of a breed of American horse which may be called the\r\ngeneral utility horse. If I have any influence with this Administration\r\nI am going to have this work continued! Also, incidentally (if any of\r\nyou have come from Vermont you will appreciate this), I think that for\r\nthis end we should develop the old breed of Morgan horse, because we\r\nhave in the Morgan horse a type which is not surpassed in any country\r\nfor the purpose to be served by the breed of horse most important for\r\nus to develop. I do not think that the perpetuation of that fine old\r\nstock should be left to private breeders. I think the Government should\r\ntake part in it. The reason we have started this horse breeding by the\r\nGovernment here in Colorado is that we find, for reasons that I am\r\nnot wholly able to explain, that the stoutest forelegs in horses are\r\ndeveloped here in Colorado; and so I hope the Senators from Colorado\r\nwill help me to develop the Morgan horse in Colorado.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I want to say a word as to a governmental policy in which\r\nI feel that this whole country ought to take a great interest and\r\nwhich is itself but part of a general policy into which I think our\r\nGovernment must go. I speak of the policy of extending the powers of\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission, of giving them the power to fix\r\nrates and to have the rates that they fix go into effect practically\r\nat once. As I say, that represents in my mind part of what should be\r\nthe general policy of this country, the policy of giving not to the\r\nState but to the National Government an increased supervisory and\r\nregulatory power over corporations. The first step and to my mind the\r\nmost important step in this general policy is to give the Nation in\r\neffective form this power over the great transportation corporations\r\nof this country. In the days of the fathers of the older among you the\r\nhighways of commerce for civilized nations were what they had always\r\nbeen—waterways and roads. Therefore they were open to all who chose to\r\ntravel upon them. Within the last two generations we have seen a system\r\ngrow up under which the old methods were completely revolutionized,\r\nand now the typical highway of commerce is the railroad. Compared to\r\nthe railroad the ordinary road for wheeled vehicles, and the waterway,\r\nwhether natural or artificial, have lost their importance. Here in\r\nColorado, for instance, it is the railroads which, of course, are the\r\nonly highways that you need take into account in dealing with the\r\nquestion of commerce in the State or outside of the State. Therefore,\r\nunder this changed system, we see highways of commerce grow up each of\r\nwhich is controlled by a single corporation or individual; sometimes\r\nseveral of them being controlled in combination by corporations or a\r\nfew individuals. When such is the case, in my judgment it is absolutely\r\nnecessary that the Nation (for the separate States can not possibly do\r\nit) should assume a supervisory and regulatory function over the great\r\ncorporations which practically control the highways of commerce.\r\n\r\nNow fix clearly in your minds two facts at the outset. As with\r\neverything else mundane, when you get that supervisory and regulatory\r\npower on behalf of the Nation you will not have cured all the evils\r\nthat existed and you will not equal the expectations of the amiable but\r\nill-regulated enthusiast who thinks that you ought to have cured all\r\nthose evils. A measure of good will come, some good will be done, some\r\ninjustice will have been prevented; but we shall be a long way from the\r\nmillennium. Get that fact clear in your mind or you will be laying up\r\nfor your selves a store of incalculable disappointment in the future.\r\nThat is the first thing.\r\n\r\nNow the second and even more important matter: When you give the Nation\r\nthat power, remember that harm and not good will come unless you give\r\nit with the firm determination not only to get justice for yourselves,\r\nbut to do justice to others. You must be as jealous to do justice to\r\nthe railroads as to exact justice from them. We can not afford in any\r\nshape or way in this country to encourage a feeling which would do\r\ninjustice to a man of property, any more than to submit to injustice\r\nfrom a man of property. Whether the man owns the biggest railroad or\r\nthe greatest outside corporation in the land, or whether he makes each\r\nday’s bread by the sweat of that day’s toil, he is entitled to justice\r\nand fair dealing, to no more and to no less. A spirit of envy on the\r\npart of those less well off against the better off is as bad as and no\r\nworse than a spirit of arrogant disregard for the rights of the man of\r\nsmall means on the part of the man of large means. The arrogance and\r\nthe envy are not two different qualities; they are the same quality\r\nshown by men under different circumstances.\r\n\r\nWe must make up our minds that nothing but harm will come from\r\nany scheme to exercise such supervision as that I advocate over\r\ncorporations, and especially over the common carriers, unless we\r\nhave it clearly fixed in our minds that the scheme is to be one of\r\nsubstantial justice alike to the common carrier and to the public. If\r\nI have the appointment or retention of any commission and power to\r\nadminister a law of such increased powers I shall neither appoint nor\r\nretain the man who would fail to do justice to the railroads any more\r\nthan I would appoint or retain the man who would fail to exact justice\r\nfrom the railroads. I want that understood as a preliminary. If I have\r\nthe appointment of any of those men, or their retention, they will give\r\na square deal all around or else their shrift will be short.\r\n\r\nBut with that statement as a preliminary I wish to urge with all\r\nthe earnestness I possess, not only upon the public, but upon those\r\ninterested in the great railway corporations, the absolute need of\r\nacquiescence in the enactment of such law. As has been well set forth\r\nby the Attorney-General, Mr. Moody, in his recent masterly argument\r\npresented to the committee of the Senate which is investigating the\r\nmatter, the Legislators have the right and as I believe the duty to\r\nconfer these powers upon some executive body. It can not confer them\r\nupon any court, nor can it take away the court’s power to interfere\r\nif the law is administered in a way that amounts to confiscation of\r\nproperty. Of course, it would be possible to come much short of such\r\nconfiscation and yet do great damage, perhaps irreparable damage, to\r\nthe great corporations engaged in interstate commerce. We must remember\r\nalways that most of the men who are responsible for the management of\r\nthese great corporations, and who have profited thereby, have made\r\ntheir fortunes not as incidental to damaging, but to benefiting the\r\ncommunity as a whole. We must be careful that nothing is done that\r\nwould jeopardize their industries and that would therefore work harm of\r\nthe most far-reaching kind not only to all, from the humblest to the\r\nhighest, engaged in these industries, but to the business community\r\nas a whole. We must be careful to see that the law is administered\r\nwith sanity and conservatism. But the power must exist, if justice\r\nis to be done as between the public and the common carrier, in some\r\ngovernmental executive tribunal, not only to fix rates and alter them,\r\nwhen convinced that existing rates do injustice, but to see that the\r\nrate thus fixed goes into effect practically at once.\r\n\r\nI do not ascribe it to any moral culpability of the men engaged in\r\nhandling these great corporations that they can not see some of the bad\r\neffects of certain things they do. It is most natural for a man who is\r\ntrying to carry on his business in competition with some other business\r\nto think that whatever he does that would beat his competitor is a\r\npretty good thing for the community at large; and often I do not blame\r\nhim for what he does; but I intend to prevent his doing it when it is\r\nagainst the public weal.\r\n\r\nI can not attempt to speak in detail of all that should be put into the\r\nlaw as I hope it will be enacted at the next session of the National\r\nCongress. Not only should this power over rates go in, but in my belief\r\nwe should at the same time deal with the private car question, which,\r\nas regards certain industries, offers an even greater menace than is\r\noffered by the present system of fixing rates. I do not think that\r\nthe law will have to deal with many subjects, but I do feel that with\r\nthe two I have mentioned and with perhaps one or two others it should\r\ndeal effectively. There will be the argument made on the other side\r\n(doubtless the argument being made in their own minds by certain of my\r\nhearers) that such power is liable to abuse. Of course it is. The power\r\nof taxation is liable to grave abuse, and yet it must exist in the\r\nappropriate legislative body. You can not give any needed power to the\r\nrepresentatives of the people without exposing yourselves to the danger\r\nof that power being abused. There must be the possibility of abuse or\r\nthere can not be the possibility of effective use.\r\n\r\nIn closing I wish to mention one governmental project which I have been\r\ninstrumental, I think, in having started which will have a certain\r\nbearing upon this question, and that is the Panama Canal. It is perhaps\r\nunnecessary for me to say that I am perfectly aware that many most\r\nadmirable gentlemen disagreed with me in my action toward the Panama\r\nCanal. But I am in a wholly unrepentant frame of mind in reference\r\nthereto. The ethical conception upon which I acted was that I did not\r\nintend that Uncle Sam should be held up while he was doing a great work\r\nfor himself and all mankind. But without regard to that, when the canal\r\ncomes into operation I think it will have a very important regulatory\r\neffect in connection with the transcontinental commerce of the great\r\nrailroads. I think when such is the case those great railroads will\r\nhave to revise their way of looking at the interests of certain inland\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nLet me repeat. I have told you my views as to what I regard to be the\r\nmost important matter of internal national legislation that in the\r\nimmediate future will be before this people. I wish to say again that,\r\nimportant though that legislation is, it is nothing like as important\r\nas the spirit in which we approach it. If we approach it in the spirit\r\nof demagogy, if we permit ourselves as a people to be deluded into\r\nthe belief that permanent good will come to us as a mass, if we attack\r\nunjustly the proper rights of others because they are wealthy, we shall\r\ndo ourselves just as much damage as if we permitted an attack upon\r\nthose who are poor because they are poor. In time past republic after\r\nrepublic has existed in this world and has gone down to destruction,\r\nsometimes because the republic was turned into a government of the\r\npoor who plundered the rich, sometimes because it was turned into a\r\ngovernment of the rich who exploited the poor. It made no difference\r\nwhatever to the fate of the republic which form its fall took. That\r\nfall was just as certain in one case as in the other. It was just as\r\ncertain to follow the triumph of a class which plundered another class,\r\nwhether the class thus given mastery was the class of the poor who\r\nplundered the rich, or the class of the rich who exploited the poor.\r\nThe destruction was as inevitable in one instance as in the other.\r\n\r\nWe have the right to look forward with confident hope to the future of\r\nthis Republic because it will not and shall not become the Republic of\r\nany class, either poor or rich, because it will and shall remain as its\r\nfounders intended it to be, and as its rescuers under Abraham Lincoln\r\nintended it to be, a government where every man, rich or poor, so long\r\nas he does his duty to his neighbor, is given his full rights, is\r\nguaranteed justice and has justice exacted from him in return.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been\r\n  corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within the\r\n  text and consultation of external sources.\r\n\r\n  Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added, when a\r\n  predominant preference was found in the original book.\r\n\r\n  Except for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text,\r\n  and inconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n  Pg  47: “appoached” replaced with “approached”\r\n  Pg  78: “maunfactories” replaced with “manufactories”\r\n  Pg 148: “everwhere” replaced with “everywhere”\r\n  Pg 195: Replaced “that” with “than” in\r\n          “...none was greater than what the late Secretary...”\r\n  Pg 216: Removed duplicate “be” in “Deep will be your shame...”\r\n  Pg 246: “commerical” replaced with “commercial”\r\n  Pg 250: Replaced “if” with “of” in\r\n          “...interest at the rate of 1 to 2...”\r\n  Pg 336: “Amercians” replaced with “Americans”\r\n  Pg 341: “Civl” replaced with “Civil”",
