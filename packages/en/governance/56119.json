S. HUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nFor nearly half a century William Cecil, Lord Burghley, exercised greater\r\ninfluence over the future fortunes of England than ever fell to the share\r\nof a statesman before or since. It was a period when Mediæval Europe was\r\nin the melting-pot, from which, in due season, some of her peoples were\r\nto arise bright and shining, with fresh faiths, higher ideals, and nobler\r\naspirations, to start on a new career of civilisation; whilst others were\r\nstill to cling a while longer to the garb of dross which remained of the\r\nold order, and was to hamper them in the times to come.\r\n\r\nHow England should emerge from the welter of the old tides and the new,\r\ndepended to some extent upon providential circumstances, but more largely\r\nstill upon the personal characteristics of those who guided her national\r\npolicy and that of her competitors. Never was nation more favoured in\r\nthis respect than was England at this crisis of the world’s history. The\r\nconditions of the Queen’s birth compelled her to embrace the cause of\r\nreligious freedom, whilst her intellect, her sex, and her versatility\r\nenabled her during a long course of years successfully to play off one\r\ncontinental rival against another, until she was strong enough openly to\r\ngrasp and hold the balance. But withal, her vanity, her fickleness, the\r\nfolly and greed of her favourites, or the machinations of her enemies,\r\nwould inevitably have dragged her to ruin again and again, but for the\r\nfact that she always had near her, in moments of weakness or danger, a\r\nfixed point to which she could turn, a councillor whose gaze was never\r\ndiverted from the ultimate goal, a man whom flattery did not move, whom\r\nbribery did not buy—wise, steady William Cecil, who, to her honour and\r\nhis, remained her prime adviser from the moment of her accession to the\r\nday of his death.\r\n\r\nIt has happened that most of the historians who have dealt in detail\r\nwith Elizabethan politics, and especially with Cecil’s share in them,\r\nhave dwelt mainly upon the religious and ecclesiastical aspect of the\r\nsubject, and have usually approached it with a strong doctrinal bias on\r\none side or the other. It is true that Cecil’s life was coeval with the\r\nrise and triumph of the great religious schism in the Christian faith\r\nin England, that in his boyhood there was hardly a whisper of revolt\r\nagainst the papal supremacy, and that ere he died the Protestant Church\r\nof England was firmly established, and the country freed from the fears\r\nof Rome. Upon this text most of his biographers have founded their\r\ndiscourse, and have regarded the great minister as first and foremost\r\na religious reformer. That he was at heart, at all events in his later\r\nyears, sincerely attached to the Protestant faith, there is no reason\r\nto doubt; but before all things, he was a statesman who sought to raise\r\nand strengthen England by political means, and used religion, as he used\r\nother instrumentalities, to attain the object he had in view. He was far\r\ntoo prudent to say so, but he probably regarded religious dogma in as\r\nbroad a spirit as Catharine de Medici, Henry IV., and Elizabeth herself.\r\nHis youthful training and early circumstances had associated him with\r\nan advanced school of thinkers, who had naturally adopted the cause of\r\nreligious reform, condemned by their opponents. The current of events\r\nand the blindness of the other side identified that party with the cause\r\nof national independence and prosperity; and for political aims, Cecil\r\nmade the most of the support to be obtained from those who demanded a\r\nsimpler and less rigid form of Christian doctrine than that imposed by\r\nRome. But in the party of reform Cecil was always the most conservative\r\nelement. Other councillors might be, and were, driven hither and thither\r\nby bribery, by passion, by a desire to flatter the Queen’s caprice, by\r\nreligious zeal or mere ineptitude, but Cecil was judicious, well-nigh\r\nincorruptible, prudent, patriotic, and clear-headed; and though he was\r\noften obliged to dissemble and give way, he always returned to his point.\r\nProtestant zeal must not hurry the Government too far, or too fast,\r\nagainst the sworn enemies of Protestantism. England must be kept free\r\nfrom entanglements with Rome, but she must also avoid as long as possible\r\nnational warfare with Rome’s principal supporter; for Spain was England’s\r\nbuckler against French aggression, and the possessor of the rich harbours\r\nof the Netherlands where English commerce found its main outlet.\r\n\r\nThroughout a long life of ceaseless activity, in which he had to deal\r\nwith ever-varying circumstances and problems; hampered by bitter rivals\r\nat home and sleepless enemies abroad, Cecil’s methods shifted so\r\nfrequently, and apparently so contradictorily, as to have bewildered most\r\nof those who have essayed to unravel his devious diplomacy. But shift as\r\nhe might, there was ever the one stable and changeless principle which\r\nunderlay all his policy, and guided all his actions. He had been brought\r\nup in the traditional school of English policy which regarded the House\r\nof Burgundy as a friend, and France as the natural enemy whose designs in\r\nScotland and Flanders must be frustrated, or England must be politically\r\nand commercially ruined. For centuries England’s standing danger had been\r\nher liability to invasion by the French over the Scottish border, and\r\nfor the first forty years of Cecil’s life the main object of English\r\nstatecraft was to break permanently the secular connection between\r\nScotland and France, and to weaken the latter country by favouring her\r\ngreat rival in Flanders.\r\n\r\nWhen Spain, under rigid Philip, assumed the championship of extreme\r\nCatholicism, and pledged herself to root out the reformed doctrines\r\nthroughout Europe, whilst France, on the other hand, was often ruled by\r\nHuguenot counsels, it will be seen that Cecil’s task in endeavouring\r\nto carry out the traditional policy, was a most difficult one, and he\r\nalone of Elizabeth’s ministers was able to preserve his equilibrium in\r\nthe face of it. Some of them went too far; drifted into Spanish pay, or\r\nbecame open Catholics and rebels; others, moved by opposite religious\r\nzeal, lost sight of the political principle, and were for fighting Spain\r\nat all times and at any cost. But Cecil, though sorely perplexed at\r\ntimes, never lost his judgment. The first article in his political creed\r\nwas distrust of the French, and it remained so to the day of his death,\r\nthough France was ruled by the ex-champion of the Huguenots, and Spain\r\nand England were still at daggers drawn. In the first year of Elizabeth’s\r\nreign Cecil wrote:[1] “France, being an ancient enemy of England, seeketh\r\nalways to make Scotland an instrument to exercise thereby their malice\r\nupon England, and to make a footstool thereof to look over England as\r\nthey may;” and forty years afterwards, when the great minister was on the\r\nbrink of the grave, De Beaumont, the French ambassador, spoke of him as\r\nstill leading “all the old councillors of the Queen who have true English\r\nhearts; that is to say, who are enemies of the welfare and repose of\r\nFrance.”[2]\r\n\r\nTo allow the French to become dominant in Scotland would have made\r\nEngland weak, to have stood by idly whilst they overcame the Netherlands\r\nwould have made her poor, and to these national reasons for distrust\r\nof French aims, was added, in Cecil’s case, the personal suspicion and\r\ndislike bred of early associations and tradition. The Queen, on the\r\nother hand, could not be expected to look upon the French in the same\r\nlight as her minister. She was as determined as he was that the French\r\nshould gain no footing in Flanders or Scotland; but through the critical\r\ntimes of her girlhood France had always stood her friend, as Spain had\r\nnaturally been her enemy. Her mother’s sympathies had, of course, been\r\nentirely French, and her own legitimacy and right to rule were as eagerly\r\nrecognised by France as they were sullenly questioned by Spain. But when\r\npassion or persuasion led her into a dangerous course, as they frequently\r\ndid, she knew that Cecil, sagacious, and steady as a rock, would advise\r\nher honestly; and sooner or later she would be brought back to his\r\npolicy of upholding Protestantism, whilst endeavouring to evade an open\r\nwar with the deadly enemy of Protestantism, which could only result in\r\nstrengthening France.\r\n\r\nThe present work will accordingly aim mainly at presenting a panorama of\r\nCecil’s career as a statesman, whose active life was not only coincident\r\nwith the triumph of the Reformation, but also with the making of Modern\r\nEngland, and with the establishment of her naval supremacy. In the\r\nspace available it will be impossible to relate in detail the whole of\r\nthe complicated political transactions of the long and important reign\r\nof Elizabeth, and no attempt will be made to do so. But Cecil, to his\r\nlasting glory, did more than any other man to guide the nation into the\r\ngroove of future greatness; and the primary object of this book is to\r\ntrace his personal and political influence over the events of his time:\r\nto show the effects produced by his clear head and steady hand on the\r\ncouncils of the able and fortunate sovereign, who transformed England\r\nfrom a feeble and distracted, to a powerful and united, nation.\r\n\r\nThe task of writing the life of Lord Burghley has been attempted more\r\nthan once, but in every case with but indifferent success. The failure\r\nhas certainly not been caused by lack of material, for no English\r\nstatesman was ever so indefatigable a correspondent and draftsman as\r\nCecil, and the stupendous masses of manuscript left behind by him\r\nfrightened even the indefatigable Camden from the work of writing an\r\naccount of Cecil’s ministry three centuries ago. “But,” he writes, “at\r\nmy very first entrance upon the task, an intricate difficulty did in a\r\nmanner wholly discourage me, for I lighted upon great files and heaps\r\nof papers and writings of all sorts, … in searching and turning over\r\nwhereof, whilst I laboured till I sweat again, covered all over with\r\ndust, to gather fit matter together, … that noble lord died, and my\r\nindustry began to flag and wax cold.” Strype also, who has reproduced\r\nso many important documents relating to Cecil in his “Annals of the\r\nReformation,” and “Ecclesiastical Memorials,” was preparing materials for\r\na life of the statesman, when death stopped his labour. Besides several\r\nless pretentious works by various authors, and the curious contemporary\r\nmemoirs published in Peck’s _Desiderata Curiosa_, a spirited attempt\r\nwas made seventy years ago by Dr. Nares, Regius Professor of History at\r\nOxford, to produce a book worthy of the subject. After many years of\r\nlaborious plodding through countless thousands of documents, the worthy\r\nprofessor produced one of the most ponderous and unreadable books in\r\nthe English language, of which Lord Macaulay made merciless sport in\r\nhis famous essay on Burghley. “Compared,” he says, “with the labour\r\nof reading through these volumes, all other labour, of thieves on the\r\ntreadmill, of children in factories, of negroes on sugar-plantations, is\r\nan agreeable recreation.… Guicciardini, although certainly not the most\r\namusing of writers, is a Herodotus or a Froissart when compared with Dr.\r\nNares.”\r\n\r\nThe embarrassment of riches in the way of material is, indeed, the rock\r\nupon which most of the serious biographers of Cecil have foundered. In\r\nthe Lansdowne MSS., at the British Museum alone, there are 122 folio\r\nvolumes of Burghley manuscripts, which descended through the minister’s\r\nsecretary, Sir Michael Hicks, besides large numbers in the Cotton\r\nand Harley collections. The Burghley Papers at the Record Office are\r\nalmost innumerable, the foreign documents subsequent to 1577 being\r\nstill uncalendared, whilst the priceless collection in the possession\r\nof Lord Salisbury at Hatfield consists of over 30,000 documents,\r\nbound in 210 large volumes. From comparatively early times many of\r\nthe more interesting of these papers have been in print. The _Scrinia\r\nCeciliana_ in the third edition of Cabala, “The Compleat Ambassador,”\r\nthe “Sadler State Papers,” Haynes’ and Murdin’s selections from the\r\nHatfield archives, Forbes’ “Public Transactions,” Birch’s “Memoirs of\r\nElizabeth,” Burgon’s “Sir Thomas Gresham,” Nicholas’ “Sir Christopher\r\nHatton,” Burnet, Collier, Lodge, Strype, Foxe, Ellis, the Harleian\r\nMiscellany, and Tytler contain a great number of original documents from\r\nCecil’s collections. Above all—since the excellent sketch of Cecil in\r\nthe “Dictionary of National Biography” was written—the Historical MSS.\r\nCommission have completed the six volumes of Calendars of the Hatfield\r\nPapers to 1597, and the Calendars of Spanish State Papers of Elizabeth\r\nhave been published by the Record Office. By the aid of these, and the\r\nDomestic and Foreign Calendars of State Papers, it is now, for the first\r\ntime, possible to obtain a comprehensive view in an accessible form of\r\nthousands of documents which have hitherto been difficult or impossible\r\nto reach; and obstacles which have marred the success of previous labours\r\nin the same field, may, it is hoped, now be more easily surmountable. The\r\nsources above mentioned have all been placed under contribution for the\r\nproduction of the present summary account of Cecil’s political life, as\r\nwell as some uncalendared manuscripts kindly placed at my disposal by the\r\nMarquis of Salisbury.\r\n\r\nI cannot hope to have succeeded entirely where others have failed, but I\r\nhave not spared time or labour in the attempt; and I have endeavoured, at\r\nleast, to prevent my view of the events themselves from being obstructed\r\nby the documents which relate to them; and, so far as is possible in a\r\nshort readable book, to present a general view of the policy of the reign\r\nof Elizabeth, especially with relation to the influence exerted upon it\r\nby her principal minister.\r\n\r\nI have written with no preconceived theory to prove, no religious or\r\npolitical aim to serve, or doctrine to establish. My only desire has\r\nbeen to follow facts whithersoever they may lead me, and to pourtray a\r\nlofty personality who has left an enduring impress on the history of his\r\ncountry. I have not sought to present Cecil as a demigod—or even as a\r\ngenius of the first class—as most of his biographers have done. The ways\r\nand methods of Elizabethan statesmen need not be concealed or apologised\r\nfor because they do not square with the ethics of to-day. At a time when\r\nthe bulk of the English people cheerfully changed their faith four times\r\nin a generation to please their rulers, it would be absurd to hold up to\r\nespecial obloquy a minister for having persecuted at one time a religion\r\nwhich at another time he professed. The final triumph of England in that\r\nstruggle of giants was won by statesmen who, like their mistress, owed\r\nas much to what we should now call their failings as they did to their\r\nvirtues. Their vacillation and tergiversation in the face of rigid and\r\nstolid opponents were main elements of their success. Cecil was by far\r\nthe most honest and patriotic of them; but he, too, was a man of his age,\r\nand must be judged from its standpoint—not from that of to-day. If I have\r\nsucceeded in presenting more clearly than some of my predecessors a view\r\nof the process by which England was made great, the man who, above all\r\nothers, was instrumental under God in making it so, may well be judged\r\nby the splendid results of his lifelong labour; and his reputation for\r\nreligious constancy, moral generosity, and political scrupulousness,\r\nplaced in the opposite scale, will hardly stir the balance.\r\n\r\n                                                        MARTIN A. S. HUME\r\n\r\nLONDON, _September 1898_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT LORD BURGHLEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n1520-1549\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be stated as an historical truism that great organic changes in\r\nthe relationship of human beings towards each other are usually preceded\r\nby periods of quiescence and apparent stability, during which unsuspected\r\nforces of preparation are at work. When the moment of crisis comes, the\r\nunthinking marvel that men are ready, as if by magic, to accept, and,\r\nif need be, to fight and die for, the new order of ideas. Although the\r\noutward manifestation of it may be unexpected, yet, in reality, no vast,\r\nfar-reaching revolution in human institutions is sudden: only that the\r\nshort-sightedness of all but the very wisest fails to see the signs until\r\nthe forces are openly arrayed and the battle set.\r\n\r\nThe period of the struggle for religious reform in Europe was preceded by\r\nsuch a process of unconscious preparation as this. Over a century elapsed\r\nfrom the martyrdom of John Huss before the bold professor of Wittemberg\r\ndared to denounce the Pope’s indulgences. It is true that during that\r\ncentury, and before, satirists and moralists had often pointed the finger\r\nof contumely at the corruption of the clergy and the lax discipline of\r\nthe Church, but no word had been raised against her doctrines. In the\r\nmeanwhile, the subterranean process which was sapping the foundations\r\nof the meek submission of old, was progressing apace with the spread of\r\nprinted books and the revival of the study of Greek and Hebrew. By the\r\ntime that Luther first made his daring stand, the learning of cultivated\r\nlaymen, thanks to Erasmus and others, had far outstripped the cramped\r\nerudition of the friars; and when at last a churchman thundered from the\r\nSaxon pulpit his startling doctrine of papal fallibility, there were\r\nthousands of men throughout Europe who were able to do without monkish\r\ncommentators, and could read the Scriptures in the original tongues,\r\nforming their own judgment of right and wrong by the unobscured light of\r\nthe inspired Word itself.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the cry for radical religious reform in 1517 found\r\na world waiting for it, and in an incredibly few years the champions of\r\nthe old and the new had taken sides ready for the struggle which was to\r\ndecide the fate of civilisation for centuries to come. By an apparently\r\nprovidential concurrence of circumstances, the personal characters and\r\nnational ambitions of rulers at the same period were such as to enlist\r\nthe hardiest and most tenacious of the European peoples on the side of\r\nfreedom from spiritual and intellectual trammels; and eventually to ally\r\nthe idea of political emancipation and personal liberty with that of\r\nreligious reform, to the immense strengthening of both. The fight was to\r\nbe a long and varied one; it can hardly, indeed, be looked upon as ended\r\neven now. Many of the combatants have fainted by the way, and both sides\r\nhave belied their principles again and again; but looking back over the\r\nfield, we can see the ground that has been won, and are assured that\r\nin the long-run the powers of progress must prevail, as we hope and\r\nbelieve, to the greater glory of God and the greater happiness of men.\r\n\r\nThe year 1520 saw the first open marshalling of the powers for the great\r\nstruggle, partly religious and partly political, which was to lead to the\r\ntriumph of the Anglo-Saxon race. In England, as yet, there was no whisper\r\nof revolt against the authority of the papacy. The King had just written\r\nhis book against the new doctrines of Luther, which was to gain for him\r\nthe title of Defender of the Faith; Catharine, the Spanish Queen-Consort,\r\nan obedient child of the Church, as became the daughter of Isabel the\r\nCatholic, lived in yet unruffled happiness with her husband; whilst the\r\nall-ruling Wolsey was plotting and intriguing for the reversion of the\r\ntriple tiara of St. Peter when Pope Leo should die. The first step to\r\nthe political rise of England was the election (June 1519) of young King\r\nCharles of Spain to the imperial crown of Germany, in succession to his\r\ngrandfather, Maximilian of Hapsburg. The marriage of the new Emperor’s\r\nfather, Philip of Hapsburg, the heir of Burgundy, with Jane the Mad, the\r\nheiress of Spain, had joined to her heritage Flanders, Holland, and the\r\nFranche Comté, and had already upset the balance of power. Francis I. had\r\nsought to redress matters by securing his own election to the empire,\r\nbut he had been frustrated, and he saw a Spanish prince in possession\r\nof territory on every side of France, shutting her in. Naples had been\r\nfilched by greedy Ferdinand, and was now firmly Spanish, as Sicily had\r\nbeen for centuries; the Emperor asserted suzerainty over most of Italy,\r\nand, above all, over Milan, which Francis himself claimed and occupied.\r\nIt was clear that the expansion of France was at an end, and her national\r\ndecline must commence, unless the iron bands braced around her by the\r\nHispano-Germanic Empire could be broken through. It was then that the\r\nimportance of England as the potential balancing power between the\r\ntwo great rivals became evident. Henry VIII. was rich in money, able,\r\nambitious, and popular. He had devoted all his great energy to improving\r\nthe resources of his country, and to reconstructing his navy; besides\r\nwhich he held Calais, the key to the frontier battle-ground of Flanders\r\nand France, and was as fully conscious of his rising importance as he was\r\ndetermined to carry it to the best market.\r\n\r\nIt had been for many years the main point of English foreign policy to\r\ncounteract the unification of France by maintaining a close connection\r\nwith the House of Burgundy, as possessors of Flanders and Holland, the\r\nprincipal markets for the English wool and cloth. This policy had drawn\r\nEngland and Spain together when the inheritances of Spain and Burgundy\r\nwere united, and it had also led to the marriage of Catharine of Aragon\r\nin England. But Henry’s desire to hold the balance, and Wolsey’s greed\r\nand ambition, had made them willing to listen to the blandishments of\r\nFrancis, and to consent to the distrustful and pompous comedy of the\r\nField of the Cloth of Gold. Charles, the new Emperor, had shown his\r\nappreciation of the threatened friendship between France and England,\r\nby his Quixotic rush over to England to see Henry earlier in the year\r\n(1520). His stay was a short one, only four days, but it was sufficient\r\nfor his purpose. He could promise more to Wolsey than Francis could, and\r\nHenry’s vanity was flattered at the young Emperor’s chivalrous trust in\r\nhim. When Charles sailed from Dover, he knew full well that, however\r\nsplendid and friendly might be the interviews of the Field of the Cloth\r\nof Gold, Francis would not have the King of England on his side in the\r\ninevitable coming war, even if he did not fight against him.\r\n\r\nThis was the condition of English politics at home and abroad when\r\nWilliam Cecil first saw the light at Bourne, in Lincolnshire, on the 13th\r\nSeptember 1520. He came into the world at the opening of a new epoch both\r\nfor his country and for the general advancement of civilisation, and\r\nbefore he left it the modern dispensation was firmly planted, in England\r\nat least, owing in no small measure to his sagacity and statecraft.\r\n\r\nIn his after life, when he had become famous, Cecil drew up in his\r\nown hand a private journal (now in the British Museum), in which he\r\nendeavoured to set down in chronological order the principal events of\r\nhis life. It will be seen, by the specimen line reproduced under the\r\nportrait, that he was in some confusion as to the year of his birth and\r\nother events of his earlier years. The entry relating to his birth, as\r\nfirst made, is against the year 1521, and reads, “13ᵒ Sep. Ego Gulielm.\r\nCecill natˢ sū, apud Burne in Com̄ Lincoln̄i;” but afterwards the date\r\nwas crossed out and entered above the line, so as to correspond with the\r\nyear 1520, whilst the blank against the year 1521 is filled in with the\r\nmention of the arrival of the Emperor Charles V. in London on the 5th\r\nJune of that year. This also is a mistake, as the Emperor’s second visit\r\nwas in June 1522. The entry with regard to Cecil’s becoming a student\r\nat Gray’s Inn in 1541 mentions that he was at that time twenty-one\r\nyears of age, so that it may be concluded that the year of his birth\r\nwas really 1520, although 1521 has usually been given by his earlier\r\nbiographers. There is at Hatfield a little book which appears not to\r\nhave been noticed or calendared, but which is, nevertheless, interesting\r\nfor purposes of comparison, as I conclude it to have been the foundation\r\nor rough draft of the journal. It is a small perpetual calendar bound\r\nup with a custom-house tariff: “Imprinted at London at the Longe Shop\r\nadjoining St. Mildred’s Church in the Pultrie, London, by John Alde,\r\nanno 1562.” In this calendar the entry relating to his birth runs thus:\r\n“13ᵗʰ Sep. 1521. Ego Gul. Cecill natus sū: 13 Sept. 1521, between 3 and\r\n4 P.M.;” whilst his entering Gray’s Inn is stated as follows: “6ᵗʰ May,\r\n33 Henry VIII. Gul. Cecill veni ad Graye’s Inn.” No age is given in this\r\ncase, so that it may probably be concluded that on copying the entries\r\ninto his permanent journal he recollected the age at which he became a\r\nlaw student, and then saw that he was born a year earlier than he had\r\noriginally thought, and at once corrected the statement he had written.\r\n\r\nThe question of his remote ancestry is of no great importance to the\r\npurpose of the present book, although Cecil himself, who throughout\r\nhis life was a diligent student of heraldry and genealogy, devoted\r\nconsiderable attention to it; and Camden was at the pains to trace\r\nhis descent to a Robert Sitsilt, a gentleman of Wales in the time of\r\nWilliam Rufus (1091). It may be sufficient for our purpose to adhere\r\nto a written pedigree at Hatfield House annotated and continued by\r\nWilliam Cecil, which proves, so far as such documents can, that the\r\nstatements made by his opponents to the end of his life that he was of\r\n“base origin,” were entirely untrue. This pedigree traces the descent\r\nof the statesman’s great-grandfather Richard Sitsilt, who died in 1508\r\npossessing considerable estates in Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, to\r\nthe ancient Welsh family of Sitsilt; but its interest and trustworthiness\r\nreally commences with Cecil’s own continuation of the pedigree from his\r\ngreat-grandfather to himself. At the end of the engrossed genealogy he\r\nhas written, “Here endeth ye old Roole in parchmᵗ,” and “The contynuance\r\nof ye line in ye heyres males untill this yere 1565.” This continuation\r\nshows that his grandfather David, the third son of Richard Sitsilt,\r\ncame across England and settled at Stamford,[3] whilst his elder\r\nbrothers remained in possession of the ancestral acres at Alterennes,\r\nHerefordshire. In the perpetual calendar at Hatfield, this David’s\r\ndeath is recorded by his grandson as follows: “David Cecill avus meus\r\nobiit Oct. 27 Hen. VIII.”[4] (1535). He was an alderman of Stamford,\r\nand appears to have possessed a good estate in Lincolnshire, which he\r\npurchased in 1507; and was appointed in 1512 Water-bailiff of Wittlesea\r\nMere, in Huntingdonshire, and Keeper of the Swans throughout all the fen\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nSoon after the accession of Henry VIII., David Cecil, the substantial\r\nLincolnshire squire, became a courtier, and was made one of the King’s\r\nserjeants-at-arms. Thenceforward royal grants and offices came to him\r\nplentifully, stewardships of crown lands, the escheatorship of Lincoln,\r\nthe shrievalty of Northampton, and the like, which must have added\r\ngreatly both to his wealth and his importance. No indication has ever\r\nbeen given of the reasons for his court favour, but it may be conjectured\r\nto have arisen from the friendship of his powerful neighbour Lord\r\nWilloughby d’Eresby of Grimsthorpe, who married Maria de Sarmiento,\r\nQueen Catharine’s dearest friend and inseparable companion; as the\r\nconnection between Lady Willoughby’s daughter, the Duchess of Suffolk,\r\nand William Cecil, remained almost on a sisterly footing throughout the\r\nlady’s life. In any case, David’s influence at court was sufficient\r\nto obtain for his son Richard, the statesman’s father, a succession of\r\nlucrative offices. He was one of the King’s pages, and is said to have\r\nattended the sovereign to the Field of the Cloth of Gold a few months\r\nbefore William Cecil was born, and he subsequently became Groom of the\r\nWardrobe, and Yeoman of the Robes. He, like the rest of the King’s\r\nfavourites, fattened on the spoils of the monasteries, and stewardships\r\nof royal manors showered upon him. He was Constable of Warwick Castle,\r\nBailiff of Wittlesea Mere, and Keeper of the Swans, like his father, and\r\nSheriff of Rutland; and to add to his prosperity, he married the heiress\r\nof William Heckington of Bourne, who brought to him the fine property of\r\nBurghley adjoining his own estates at Stamford. When, therefore, William\r\nCecil was born in the house of his maternal grandfather at Bourne, he was\r\nprospective heir to broad acres in a half-dozen counties, with almost the\r\ncertainty of advancement through court influence in whatever career he\r\nmight choose.\r\n\r\nLittle is known, or need be told, of Cecil’s early youth. He went to\r\nschool successively at Grantham and Stamford, and in May 1535, when he\r\nwas fifteen years of age, entered St. John’s College, Cambridge, to\r\nembark upon deeper studies. His anonymous biographer, who lived in his\r\nhousehold in his later years, and can only have spoken by hearsay of\r\nhis college days, says[5] that he was so “diligent and paineful as he\r\nhired a bell-ringer to call him up at foure of the clock every morninge;\r\nwith which early rising and late watchinge, and continuall sitting,\r\nthere fell abundance of humours into his leggs, then very hardly cured,\r\nwhich was thought one of the original causes of his gowt.” It is, at\r\nall events, certain that he threw himself with avidity into the studies\r\nwhich were then especially claiming the attention of scholars, and in\r\na very short time became remarkable for his wide knowledge of Greek\r\nespecially, and for his extraordinary general aptitude and application.\r\nIt is said, indeed, that he gratuitously read the Greek lecture at St.\r\nJohn’s before he was nineteen years of age. By good fortune it happened\r\nthat the University was at the time of his residence the centre of a\r\nnew intellectual movement, the young leaders of which at once became\r\nCecil’s chosen friends. Already the new learning had taken fast hold of\r\nthe brighter spirits, and although Luther’s works were openly forbidden,\r\nthey were secretly read by a little company of students who met for the\r\npurpose at a tavern in Cambridge called the White Horse; Erasmus had\r\nleft memories of his teaching behind him at Queen’s, and Melancthon’s\r\nbooks were eagerly studied. A brilliant young King’s scholar, named\r\nThomas Smith, read the Greek lectures at Queen’s College, and assembled\r\nunder him a band of scholars, such as have rarely been united at one\r\ntime. Cheke, Ascham, Matthew Parker, Nicholas Bacon, Bill, Watson, and\r\nHaddon, amongst many others, who afterwards achieved fame, were Cecil’s\r\nintimate companions; and Cheke especially, who belonged to the same\r\ncollege, and was somewhat older, systematically helped him, doubtless for\r\na consideration. Cheke’s capacity was almost as remarkable as that of his\r\nfellow King’s scholar, Smith. He was poor, but of ancient family, the son\r\nof a college-beadle whose widow on his death had to maintain her children\r\nby keeping a wine-shop in the town; although he subsequently became the\r\nRegius Professor of Greek, and tutor to Edward VI., and, by the aid of\r\nSmith, reformed the vicious pronunciation of Latin and Greek upon which\r\nthe Churchmen had insisted. Humble John Cheke was Cecil’s bosom friend,\r\nand to his mother’s wine-shop the rich courtier’s son must often have\r\nbeen a welcome visitor.\r\n\r\nDetails of his daily life are wanting, but he must have been a\r\nwell-conducted youth, for the amount of study he got through was\r\nprodigious. Catharine de Medici, years afterwards (1563), spitefully told\r\nSmith—then Sir Thomas, and an ambassador—that Cecil had had a son at the\r\nage of fifteen or sixteen,[6] to which Smith, who must have known whether\r\nit was true or not, made no reply; but she probably spoke at random, and\r\nreferred to Cecil’s early marriage. He left the University after six\r\nyears’ residence, without taking his degree. Whether his father withdrew\r\nhim because of his close intimacy with the family of the wine-shop\r\nkeeper, is not known, but is probable. In his own hand he states that he\r\nwas entered a student of Gray’s Inn, in May 1541, and that on the 8th\r\nAugust of the same year he married Mary Cheke, of Cambridge, the sister\r\nof his friend.[7] The next entry in the diary records, under date of 5th\r\nMay 1542, the birth of his eldest son, Thomas Cecil, his own age at the\r\ntime being twenty-two (Natus est mihi Thomas Cecil filius; cum essem\r\nnatus annos xxii.). In the Perpetual Calendar at Hatfield it is mentioned\r\nthat the child was born at Cambridge, so that it may be assumed that\r\nCecil’s wife still lived with her own people. The next entry to that\r\nrelating the birth of the future Lord Exeter, records the death of his\r\nyoung mother thus: “22 Feb. 1543, Maria uxor mortua est in Domine, hora\r\n2ᵃ nocte,”[8] and with this bare statement the story of Cecil’s first\r\nmarriage ends, though he never lost touch with or interest in the Cheke\r\nfamily, who appear to have been equally attached to him.\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned whether Cecil went deeply into the study of law at\r\nGray’s Inn. It was usual to enter young gentlemen at one of the inns of\r\ncourt to give them some definite standing or pursuit in London, rather\r\nthan with a view of their becoming practising lawyers. It is almost\r\ncertain from a statement of his household biographer,[9] that such was\r\nthe case with Cecil. “He alwaies praised the study of the common law\r\nabove all other learning: saying ‘that if he shoulde begyene againe he\r\nwould follow that studie.’” He probably passed much of his time about the\r\ncourt; and his domestic tells a story of him in this connection, which\r\nmay well be true, but which rests upon his authority alone. He was, he\r\nsays, in the presence-chamber, where he met two chaplains of O’Neil, who\r\nwas then (1542) on a visit to the King; “and talking long with them in\r\nLattin, he fell in disputation with the priests, wherein he showed so\r\ngreat learning and witt, as he proved the poore priests to have neither,\r\nwho weare so putt down as they had not a word to saie, but flung away no\r\nless discontented than ashamed to be foiled in such a place by so younge\r\na berdless yewth.”[10] The chronicler goes on to say that the King being\r\ntold of this, Cecil was summoned to the royal presence, and delighted\r\nHenry with his answers; Richard Cecil, the father, being directed by the\r\nKing to seek out some office or favour which might be bestowed upon his\r\nclever son. The Yeoman of the Robes, we may be sure, was nothing loath,\r\nand petitioned in William Cecil’s name for the reversion of the office of\r\n_custos brevium_ in the Court of Common Pleas, which was duly granted,\r\nand was the first of the future great statesman’s many offices of profit\r\nreceived from the Crown.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time, or shortly afterwards (1544), Cecil’s connection\r\nwith the court was made closer by the appointment of his brother-in-law,\r\nJohn Cheke, to be tutor to the young Prince Edward, and of his friend,\r\nRoger Ascham, to a similar position to the Princess Elizabeth. A general\r\nsupervision over the studies of Prince Edward was entrusted to his\r\ngovernor, Sir Anthony Cooke, who was one of the pioneers of the new\r\nlearning, and a member of the Protestant party in Henry’s court led by\r\nEdward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, Prince Edward’s uncle. The secular\r\neducational movement, which was now in full swing, had spread to the\r\ntraining of girls of the upper classes. The working of tapestry and the\r\ncares of a household were no longer regarded as the sole ends and aims of\r\na lady’s life, and it was a fashion at court for Greek and Latin, as well\r\nas modern languages, to be imparted to the daughters of gentlemen of the\r\nnewer school. Amongst the first of the ladies to be thus highly educated\r\nwere the four daughters of Sir Anthony Cooke, who were afterwards to be\r\ncelebrated as the most learned women in England, at a time when education\r\nhad become a feminine fad under the learned Elizabeth. To the eldest of\r\nthese paragons of learning, Mildred Cooke, aged twenty, William Cecil was\r\nmarried on the 21st December 1545, and thus bound himself by another\r\nlink to the rising progressive party at court.[11]\r\n\r\nAlready the struggle of the Reformation on the Continent had begun. The\r\nEmperor, alarmed at the firm stand made by the Protestant princes of\r\nthe empire, had hastily made peace with Francis I., and had left his\r\nally the King of England in the lurch. The spectre of Lutheranism had\r\ndrawn together the lifelong rivals with the secret object of crushing\r\nreligious dissent, which struck at the root of their temporal authority.\r\nThe ambition of Maurice of Saxony, and disunion in the Protestant ranks,\r\nenabled Charles to destroy the Smalkaldic league, and in April 1547,\r\nafter the battle of Muhlberg, to impose his will upon the empire. Henry\r\nVIII. had deeply resented the desertion of his ally Charles V., when\r\nin December 1544 he had been left to fight Francis alone, and during\r\nthe closing years of his life the Protestant influence in his Councils\r\ngrew stronger than ever. The old King died on the 28th January 1547.\r\nParliament was sitting at the time, but the King’s death was kept secret\r\nfor nearly three days, and it was Monday, 31st January, before Lord\r\nChancellor Wriothesley, his voice broken by sobs, informed the Houses\r\nof Parliament that King Edward VI. had ascended the throne, under the\r\nregency, during his minority, of the Council nominated in King Henry’s\r\nwill. The star of Seymour and the Protestants had risen, and soon\r\nthose papistically inclined, like Wriothesley, and Gardiner, Bishop of\r\nWinchester, shed tears indeed for the master they had lost, schismatic\r\nthough he was.\r\n\r\nWith such friends in the dominant party as Cooke, Cheke, Cranmer, and\r\nSeymour, it is not surprising that William Cecil’s career emerged from\r\nobscurity and uncertainty almost as soon as the new Government was\r\nestablished. For a young man of twenty-seven he had already not done\r\nbadly. His father was still alive, but in the first year of Edward VI.\r\nthe office of _custos brevium_, of which the old King had given him the\r\nreversion five years before, fell in, and this brought him, in salary and\r\nfees, £240 per annum (£6, 13s. 4d. salary and rest fees at the four law\r\nterms), and in addition to this, according to his household biographer,\r\nthe Lord Protector appointed him his Master of Requests soon after\r\nassuming power. That he held some such office from the summer of 1547 is\r\ncertain, as from that date forward great numbers of letters exist written\r\nto him in relation to suits and petitions addressed to the Protector.\r\nThe office, as then constituted, appears to have been an innovation, as\r\nbeing attached to Somerset’s personal household,[12] and intended to\r\nrelieve him from the trouble of himself examining petitions and suits. In\r\nany case Cecil’s assiduity and patience appear thus early to have been\r\nacknowledged, to judge by the tone of most of his correspondents, many\r\nof whom belonged to a much more exalted social position than himself.\r\nIn June 1547 Sir Thomas Darcy informs him[13] that (evidently by order)\r\nhe had inquired into the love affair between “Mistress Dorothy” and the\r\nyoung Earl of Oxford—who was a ward—and desires to know whether the\r\nProtector wishes the match to be prevented or not; and in the following\r\nmonth Lady Browne wrote to him in terms of intimate friendship, begging\r\nhim to use his influence with Somerset to appoint her brother to the\r\ncoming expedition to Scotland.[14]\r\n\r\nThe master and fellows of his old college, St. John’s, too, were\r\nanxious to propitiate the rising official and to bespeak his interest\r\nin favour of their foundation,[15] and the widowed Duchess of Suffolk\r\n(Lady Willoughby) consulted him in all her difficulties. The war with\r\nFrance was suspended, though the English forces holding Boulogne were\r\nclosely beleaguered, and Somerset’s greed was diverting the money which\r\nshould have been spent in war preparations; but in pursuance of the\r\ntraditional policy of England, it became a question almost of national\r\nexistence when it was seen that the French intrigues for the marriage of\r\nthe child Queen of Scots and the final suppression of the rising reform\r\nparty in Scotland were likely to succeed. Arran had signed the treaty\r\nwith Henry for the marriage of Edward and Mary; but he, and especially\r\nthe Queen-mother, Mary of Lorraine, had resisted the deportation of the\r\ninfant Queen to England. It is possible that some arrangement might\r\nhave been arrived at had not the ill-advised murder of Cardinal Beaton\r\nand the subsequent anarchy given to the new King of France, Henry II.,\r\nan excuse for armed interference in protection of the Catholic party.\r\nThen it became incumbent upon the Protector to fight the Scots at all\r\nhazards, or French influence over the Border threatened to become\r\npermanent; a double danger, now that the religious question tended to\r\nalienate England from her secular alliance with the House of Burgundy.\r\nWhen Somerset made his rapid march upon Scotland with an army of 18,000\r\nmen, supported by a powerful fleet, in September 1547, his trusted\r\nCecil attended him in the capacity apparently of provost-marshal, in\r\nconjunction with the chronicler of the campaign, William Patten.[16] The\r\ndecisive battle of Pinkie was fought on the 10th September 1547, and was\r\nin a great measure won by the dash, at a critical moment, of the Spanish\r\nand Italian auxiliaries whom Somerset had enlisted. According to the\r\n“household” historian so often quoted,[17] Cecil narrowly escaped death\r\nfrom a cannon shot at Pinkie, but no other mention of the fact is to be\r\nfound. It has been doubted whether at this time he held still the office\r\nof Master of Requests, in which he is said to have been succeeded by his\r\nold college friend Sir Thomas Smith,[18] but there was no break in his\r\nclose connection in some capacity with the Protector. About five months\r\nafter Pinkie, in a letter to Lord Cobham, Somerset calls him “my servant\r\nWilliam Cecill,”[19] and refers to letters written to him on his behalf;\r\nand in June 1548 the powerful Earl of Warwick, who was soon to supplant\r\nSomerset, writes to Cecil, almost humbly thanking him for forwarding some\r\nrequest of his to the Protector.[20]\r\n\r\nCecil’s position, however, shortly after this becomes clearly defined,\r\nand his personality emerges into full daylight. Against the year 1548 in\r\nhis journal, the only entry is as follows: “Mes. Sep. _co-optatus sū in\r\nofᵐ Secretarij_.” This has often given rise to confusion as to the date\r\nof his first appointment as Secretary of State, but there is now no room\r\nfor doubt that the office to which this entry refers is that of Secretary\r\nto Somerset; and the appointment, like that of Master of Requests, was\r\npart of the Protector’s system of surrounding himself with a household as\r\nnear as possible modelled on that of the King.\r\n\r\nThenceforward everything that did not strictly appertain to the\r\nofficial Secretaries of State went through the hands of Cecil, who in\r\nthe meanwhile was imbibing the traditions of statecraft which were to\r\nguide him through life. Already the cabal against Somerset had been in\r\nprogress before he went to Scotland, and had caused him to hurry back\r\nbefore he gained the full fruits of his victory at Pinkie. Mary of\r\nLorraine and the Scottish nobles had almost unanimously rallied now to\r\nthe French side, and had agreed to give the young Queen in marriage to\r\nthe Dauphin, whilst strong reinforcements were sent to Scotland from\r\nFrance. Bound though he was to the extreme Protestant party, Somerset\r\nwas therefore obliged to turn to the arch-enemy of Protestantism, the\r\nEmperor, for support and assistance. Charles had his hands full with his\r\nvast new projects of universal domination for his son, and was postponing\r\nthe inevitable war with France as long as possible, and consequently\r\nturned a deaf ear to Somerset’s approaches. Public discontent, artfully\r\nencouraged by the Protector’s enemies, grew daily more dangerous. His\r\nbrother, the Lord Admiral, had sought to depose him, and fell a victim\r\nto his own foolishness and ambition (20th March 1549). The attempt to\r\ninterfere with the religious service in the house of the Princess Mary\r\nmade Somerset even more unpopular, alienated the Emperor still further,\r\nand enraged those who yet clung to the remnants of the old faith. Then\r\ncame the great rising in the West, the revolt of the commons throughout\r\nEastern and Central England against the enclosures carried out by the\r\nland-grabbing crew that surrounded Somerset. In April 1549 Cecil was\r\ntrying to obtain a grant of the rectory and manor of Wimbledon, in which\r\nhe eventually succeeded, and he appears to have purchased at the same\r\ntime some fen lands near Spalding; but although he was in the midst of\r\naffairs, and must have been the Protector’s right hand in most things, he\r\nwas sagacious enough at so dangerous a time to keep to the routine work\r\nof his office, and avoided all responsibility on his own account.\r\n\r\nWhen Warwick came back from his ruthless campaign against the peasants\r\nof Norfolk, flushed with an easy victory, the idol of a discontented and\r\npartly foreign soldiery, the time was ripe for him to strike his blow.\r\nGardiner and Bonner were in the Tower, the Catholic party were being\r\nharried and persecuted throughout the country, the French and Scots in\r\nScotland were now strong and invincible, the French fleet dominated the\r\nChannel, the town of Boulogne was known to be untenable; and, above\r\nall, an unpaid victorious soldiery looked to Warwick as their champion.\r\nWarwick himself laid the blame for all troubles and shortcomings upon\r\nthe Protector, and summoning the officers of his army to Ely Place,\r\nconstituted himself their spokesman for obtaining their pay. Through\r\nWriothesley—now Southampton—Somerset’s enemy, he persuaded the Catholics\r\nthat he disapproved of the religious pressure that was being exercised.\r\nThe first step taken openly for the overthrow of the Protector appears to\r\nbe a letter written by Warwick to Cecil,[21] on the 14th September 1549,\r\nwhich shows, amongst other things, the high esteem in which the secretary\r\nwas held. “To my very loving friend, Mr Cecille,” it runs,—“These shall\r\nbe to desire you to be an intercessor to my Lord’s Grace that this\r\nbearer, Thomas Drury, captain of nine-score footmen, serving the King’s\r\nMajesty in Norfolk, should receive for them his pay for the space of two\r\nmonths.” Warwick knew full well that no money would be forthcoming for\r\nthese men’s pay, and that the Protector was already being deserted by the\r\ncouncillors, who were finding excuses for meeting with Warwick at Ely\r\nPlace rather than with Somerset at Hampton Court. At length the Protector\r\ncould shut his eyes no longer to the desertion. The only councillors\r\nwho were at Hampton Court with him were Cranmer, Sir William Paget, Sir\r\nWilliam Petre, and Sir Thomas Smith, Secretaries of State, and his own\r\nsecretary, William Cecil. The meetings at Ely Place and the growing storm\r\nagainst him found Somerset unprotected and unprepared. On the 1st October\r\nhe issued a proclamation calling upon the lieges to muster and defend\r\nthe King; but most of his advisers near him deprecated the use of force,\r\nwhich they knew would be fruitless against Warwick and the troops, and\r\nhis divided councils only resulted in the dissemination of anonymous\r\nhandbills and circulars stating that the King’s person was in danger from\r\nWarwick, and the summoning of such nobles as were thought most likely\r\nto be favourable to the Protector’s cause. Secretary Petre, who had\r\nadvocated an agreement, was on the 7th October sent to London to confer\r\nwith Warwick, but he betrayed his trust and returned no more. The King\r\nand the Protector had in the meanwhile removed to Windsor for greater\r\nsecurity; but Warwick had gained the Tower and had conciliated the city\r\nof London, and it was clear to all now, that Somerset’s power was gone.\r\nAll fell away from him, except only Sir Thomas Smith. The two principal\r\ngenerals in arms, Lords Russell and Herbert, rallied to Warwick. Cranmer\r\nand Paget, it is true, remained by the side of the Protector, but,\r\nlike Petre, they played him false. No word or sign is given of Cecil,\r\nthough he too remained with his master; but it is significant that all\r\nthe letters to Warwick at the time are in the handwriting of Sir Thomas\r\nSmith, and at this moment of difficulty and danger sagacious Cecil\r\nrecedes into the position of a private secretary, sheltered behind the\r\nresponsibility of his master.\r\n\r\nIn vain Somerset, at the prompting of Cranmer and Paget, sought to\r\nmake terms with Warwick. Finding that Petre did not return to Windsor,\r\nbut that the Lords in London demanded unconditional submission, the\r\nProtector, in the name of the King, sent Sir Philip Hoby on the 8th\r\nOctober with an appeal _ad misericordiam_ to Warwick. “Marry,” says the\r\nletter, “to put himself simply into your hands, having heard as he and\r\nwe have, without knowing upon what conditions, is not reasonable. Life\r\nis sweet, my Lords, and they say you do seek his blood and his death.…\r\nWherefore, good my Lords, we beseech you again and again, if you have\r\nconceived any such determination, to put it out of your heads, and\r\nincline your hearts to kindness and humanity, remembering that he hath\r\nnever been cruel to any of you, and why should you be cruelly minded to\r\nhim.”[22]\r\n\r\nThis appeal was supported by a passionate prayer from Smith to Petre\r\nfor clemency to the Protector. But Hoby also played false, and delayed\r\nhis return until Warwick had secured the formal adhesion of Russell and\r\nHerbert. He then returned to Windsor with Warwick’s secret ultimatum to\r\nCranmer, Smith, and Paget, warning them to desert the Protector, or be\r\nprepared to share his fate. Cranmer and Paget gave way, and washed their\r\nhands of the betrayal; Smith stood firm, and faced the consequence;\r\nwhilst Cecil discreetly retired into the background, and apparently did\r\nnothing, though he was certainly present when Hoby delivered his official\r\nmessage, solemnly promising that no harm was intended, or would be done,\r\nto Somerset or his friends; “upon this all the aforenamed there present\r\nwept for joy, and prayed for the Lords. Mr. Comptroller (Paget) fell down\r\non his knees, and clasped the Duke about the knees, and weeping said,\r\n‘O! my Lord, ye see now what my Lords be.’” Paget’s crocodile tears were\r\nhardly dry before he sent a servant post-haste to London, saying that the\r\nProtector was now off his guard, and might easily be seized. The next\r\nday Somerset was a prisoner, and three days afterwards was in the Tower.\r\nSmith, Cecil, Thynne, and Stanhope were placed under arrest in their own\r\napartments, whilst Cranmer, Paget, and Petre reaped the reward of their\r\napostasy.[23]\r\n\r\nWhen the Protector was sent to the Tower, all of his friends were made\r\nhis fellow-prisoners except Cecil. Smith was dismissed from his offices,\r\nand threatened with the extreme penalty for treason; but Cecil, the\r\nProtector’s right hand, through whom all his patronage had passed,\r\nescaped punishment at the time[24] (13th October 1549). Warwick was\r\napparently an old friend of his father,[25] and had unquestionably a\r\ngreat opinion of Cecil’s own application and sagacity. This may have\r\ninclined him to leniency in his case, but for some reason not disclosed\r\nhe was certainly a prisoner in the Tower in the following month. In a\r\nletter from his friend the Duchess of Suffolk, dated 16th November 1549\r\n(Lansdowne MSS., 2, 24), she condoles with him for “the loss of his\r\nplace in _the Duke of Somerset’s family_,”[26] but says nothing to lead\r\nto the idea that he is in prison. But in the holograph journal already\r\nquoted, there is an entry—although, curiously enough, out of its proper\r\nposition, and opposite the year 1547, saying, “_Mēse Novēb aₒ 3ᵒ E vi.\r\nfui in Turre_;” and his household biographer also records the fact as\r\nfollows: “In the _second_ year of K. Edward VI. he (Cecil) was committed\r\nto the Tower about the Duke of Somerset’s first calling in question,\r\nremaining there a quarter of a year, and was then enlarged;” but, as\r\nhas already been explained, this life was written in the minister’s old\r\nage, and as he certainly was not in the Tower as a prisoner twice, the\r\nimprisonment referred to must have been that of November 1549 (3rd Edward\r\nVI.). There is, in any case, a gap in all known records with regard to\r\nCecil for several months after Somerset’s disgrace, and he evidently\r\nhad no share in public affairs for nearly a year after Warwick’s (now\r\nNorthumberland’s) rise, during which time Sir William Petre and Dr.\r\nWotton—who succeeded Smith—were joint Secretaries of State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n1550-1553\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Catholic party soon found that Northumberland had used them only as\r\na cat’s-paw to satisfy his ambition; and that where mild Somerset had\r\nscourged them with whips, he would scourge them with scorpions. Gardiner\r\nand Bonner were made closer prisoners than ever. Princess Mary, who had\r\npractically defied Somerset about her Mass, was more sternly dealt with\r\nby Northumberland, her chaplains imprisoned, and her household placed\r\nunder strict observation;[27] Latin service was strictly forbidden\r\nthroughout the realm, altars were abolished, and uniformity enforced;\r\nwhilst Southampton, who had been largely instrumental in the overthrow\r\nof Somerset, found, to his dismay, that he had laboured in vain so\r\nfar as he and his co-religionists were concerned. There is no reason\r\nto doubt that, even thus early, Northumberland’s ambitious plans were\r\nalready formed. For their success two things were absolutely necessary:\r\nfirst, the unanimous support of the Protestant party; and next, a close\r\nunderstanding with France, which meant a reversal of the traditional\r\nforeign policy of this country. The attempt to supersede Mary on the\r\ndeath of the King, who was seen to be of short life, would be certain to\r\nmeet with opposition on the part of the Emperor, and would necessitate\r\nthe support of France to be successful. Much as Northumberland had\r\ndenounced the idea of the surrender of Boulogne in the time of Somerset,\r\nhe lost no time in concluding a peace by which the town was given up, the\r\nnecessity for doing so being still laid to the charge of his predecessor;\r\nand the alliance between France and England, which included Scotland, was\r\nnominally made the closer by the betrothal of Elizabeth,[28] the eldest\r\ndaughter of the King of France to Edward VI. Soon Somerset, who still\r\nhad many friends amongst Protestants, was released from prison, and in\r\nmore humble guise readmitted to the Council. On every hand Northumberland\r\ncourted popularity from all but the extreme Catholics, from whom he had\r\nnothing but opposition to expect.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances it was necessary to have by his side an\r\nexperienced Secretary of State of Protestant leanings, as well as of\r\nassiduity and ability. Petre and Wotton were known to be more than\r\ndoubtful with regard to religion; Smith had made himself impossible by\r\nthe active part he took against Northumberland at the time of Somerset’s\r\nimprisonment. No man was more fitted to the post than Cecil, and on the\r\n5th September 1550 he was made for the first time Secretary of State. In\r\nthe “perpetual calendar” at Hatfield the entry runs, “5 Sep. 4 Ed. VI.,\r\napud Oatlands Guil. Cecill admisus secr̄ in loco D. Wotton,” and the\r\nPrivy Council book confirms this, though the King in his journal gives\r\nthe date of the appointment as the 6th September. Again William Cecil\r\nemerges from obscurity, and henceforward his position is unequivocal.\r\nAs before, everything seemed to pass through his hands. No matter was\r\ntoo small or too large to claim his attention. His household biographer\r\nsays of him that he worked incessantly, except at meal times, when he\r\nunbent and chatted wittily to his friends, but never of business. He\r\ncould, he says, never play any sort of game, took no interest in sport\r\nor pastimes, his only exercise being riding round his garden walks on a\r\nlittle mule. “He was rather meanly statured, but well proportioned, very\r\nstraight and upright, active and hardy, until crippled by constant gout.”\r\nHis hair and beard were brown, before they became silver-white, as they\r\ndid early in life; and his carriage and conversation were always grave\r\nand circumspect.\r\n\r\nIf his own conduct was ruled—as some of his actions certainly were—by the\r\nmaxims which in middle age he laid down for his favourite son, he must\r\nhave been a marvel of prudence and wisdom. Like the usual recommendations\r\nof age to youth, many of these precepts simply inculcate moderation,\r\nreligion, virtue, and other obviously good qualities; but here and there\r\nCecil’s own philosophy of life peeps out, and some of the reasons of\r\nhis success are exhibited. “Let thy hospitality be moderate, … rather\r\nplentiful than sparing, for I never knew any man grow poor by keeping\r\nan orderly table.… Beware thou spendest not more than three of four\r\nparts of thy revenue, and not above a third part of that in thy house.”\r\n“That gentleman who sells an acre of land sells an ounce of credit, for\r\ngentility is nothing else but ancient riches.” “Suffer not thy sons to\r\ncross the Alps, for they shall learn nothing there but pride, blasphemy,\r\nand atheism; and if by travel they get a few broken languages, they\r\nshall profit them nothing more than to have one meat served up in divers\r\ndishes. Neither train them up in wars, for he that sets up to live by\r\nthat profession can hardly be an honest man or a good Christian.” “Beware\r\nof being surety for thy best friends; he that payeth another man’s debts\r\nseeketh his own decay.” “Be sure to keep some great man thy friend,\r\nbut trouble him not with trifles; compliment him often with many, yet\r\nsmall, gifts.” “Towards thy superiors be humble, yet generous; with\r\nthine equals familiar, yet respectful; towards thine inferiors show much\r\nhumanity, and some familiarity, as to bow the body, stretch forth the\r\nhand, and to uncover the head.” “Trust not any man with thy life, credit,\r\nor estate, for it is mere folly for a man to enthral himself to his\r\nfriend.” Such maxims as these evidently enshrine much of his own temper,\r\nand throughout his career he rarely seems to have violated them. His was\r\na selfish and ungenerous gospel, but a prudent and circumspect one.\r\n\r\nFrom the first days of his appointment as Secretary of State, the\r\nDuchess of Suffolk was again his constant correspondent. As she was one\r\nof the first to condole with him on his misfortune, she was early to\r\ncongratulate him on “the good exchanges he had made, and on having come\r\nto a good market”;[29] and thenceforward all the Lincolnshire gossip\r\nfrom Grimsthorpe and Tattershall reached the Secretary regularly, with\r\nmany Lincolnshire petitions, and much business in the buying and leasing\r\nof land by Cecil in the county, although his father lived until the\r\nfollowing year, 1552.[30] His erudite wife, of whom he always speaks\r\nwith tender regard, seems to have kept up a correspondence in Greek with\r\ntheir friend, Sir Thomas Morysine, the English Ambassador to the Emperor,\r\nand with the learned Joannes Sturmius, to which several references are\r\nmade in Morysine’s eccentric and affected letters to Cecil in the State\r\nPapers, Foreign.\r\n\r\nThe letters of Morysine and Mason, the Ambassador to France, to Cecil\r\nare of more importance as giving a just idea of Northumberland’s policy\r\nabroad than are their despatches to the Council. The Protestant princes\r\nwere already recovering their spirits after the defeat of Muhlberg,\r\nand the Emperor was again faced by persistent opposition in the Diet.\r\nHenry II., having now made sure of Northumberland’s necessary adhesion\r\nto him, once more launched against the empire the forces of the Turks\r\nin the Mediterranean, whilst French armies invaded Italy and threatened\r\nFlanders. To the old-fashioned English diplomatists, this driving of the\r\nEmperor into a corner was a subject of alarm. Wotton, in a letter to\r\nCecil (2nd January 1551), expresses the opinion that an attack upon the\r\nEnglish at Calais would be the next move of the French King, and that\r\nFrenchmen generally are not to be trusted;[31] and Mason, the Ambassador\r\nin France (November 1550) writes also to Cecil: “The French profess\r\nmuch, but I doubt their sincerity; I fear they know too well our estate,\r\nand thereby think to ride upon our backs.”[32] But, withal, though as\r\nyet they knew it not, Northumberland’s plans depended upon a close\r\nunderstanding with France, and during the rest of his rule this was his\r\nguiding principle. Mason had to be withdrawn from France, and Pickering,\r\nanother friend of Cecil’s, more favourable to the French interest,\r\nwas appointed; whilst Wotton was sent to calm the susceptibilities of\r\nthe Emperor, who was growing fractious at the close alliance between\r\nNorthumberland and the French, which was being cemented by one of the\r\nmost splendid embassies that ever left England (March 1551). Prudent\r\nCecil through it all gives in his correspondence no inkling of his own\r\nfeeling towards Northumberland’s new departure in foreign policy, though\r\nthe letters of his many friends to him are a sure indication that they\r\nknew he was not really in favour of it.\r\n\r\nIn home affairs he was just as discreet. His view of the duty of a\r\nSecretary of State was to carry out the orders of the Council without\r\nseeking to impose his own opinion unduly, and to the last days of his\r\nlife his methods were conciliatory and diplomatic rather than forcible.\r\nHe bent before insistence; but he usually had his way, if indirectly, in\r\nthe end, as will be seen in the course of his career. For instance, one\r\nof the first measures which he had to carry out under Northumberland was\r\nthe debasement of the coinage,[33] though it was one of his favourite\r\nmaxims that “the realm cannot be rich whose coin is base,”[34] and his\r\npersistent efforts to reform the coinage under Elizabeth contributed much\r\nto the renewed prosperity of England. It would appear to have been his\r\nsystem to make his opinion known frankly in the Council, but when it was\r\noverborne by a majority, to carry out the opposite policy loyally. As\r\nwill be seen, this mode of proceeding probably saved his head on the fall\r\nof Northumberland.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, not of the stuff from which martyrs are made, and when\r\nhis first patron and friend, Somerset, finally fell, to the sorrow of all\r\nEngland, and lost his head on Tower Hill, Cecil’s own position remained\r\nunassailed. This is not the place to enter fully upon the vexed question\r\nof the guilt of Somerset in the alleged plan to murder Warwick and his\r\nfriends, but a glance at Cecil’s attitude at the time will be useful.\r\nAccording to the young King’s journal, the first revelation of the\r\nconspiracy was made on the 7th October 1551 by Sir Thomas Palmer, who\r\non the following days amplified his information and implicated many of\r\nSomerset’s friends. On the 14th, Somerset had got wind of the affair, and\r\nsent for his friend Secretary Cecil to tell him he was afraid there was\r\nsome mischief brewing. Cecil answered coldly, “that if he were not guilty\r\nhe might be of good courage; if he were, he had nothing to say but to\r\nlament him.”[35] In two days Somerset and his friends were in the Tower,\r\nand thenceforward through all the shameful trial, until the sacrifice was\r\nfinally consummated, Cecil appeared to be prudently wrapped up in foreign\r\naffairs;[36] for to him had been referred the appeal of the Protestant\r\nprinces brought by his friend A’Lasco, for help against their suzerain\r\nthe Emperor, and to others fell the main task of removing the King’s\r\nuncle from the path of Northumberland.\r\n\r\nCecil’s position as a Protestant Secretary of State was one that\r\nrequired all his tact and discretion. Somerset was his first friend\r\nand “master”; and although it is not well established that the Duke\r\npersonally was guilty of the particular crime for which he suffered, it\r\nis unquestionable that he had been for several months coquetting with\r\nthe Catholic party, had agitated for the release of Gardiner from the\r\nTower, and that his friends were busy, almost certainly with his own\r\nconnivance, to obtain for him in the coming Parliament the renewal of his\r\noffice of Protector. Light is thrown upon Cecil’s share in bringing about\r\nthe Duke’s downfall, by the letters to him of his friend Whalley,[37]\r\nwho had been officiously pushing Somerset’s interests early in 1551,\r\nand had been imprisoned for it. In June he had been released, and was\r\napparently made use of by Cecil to convey letters from the latter in\r\nLondon to Northumberland in the country, complaining of Somerset’s\r\nefforts in favour of Gardiner, and his intrigues with the Catholics.\r\nThat Cecil should resent, as Secretary of State, any movement that\r\nthreatened Northumberland and the Protestant cause at the time was\r\nnatural. It will be recollected that he did not become Northumberland’s\r\nSecretary of State until the former had thrown over the Catholics—but\r\nit was perhaps an ungenerous excess of zeal to be the first to denounce\r\nhis former patron. At all events, Northumberland was delighted with the\r\nSecretary’s action in the matter, and told Whalley so—“He declared in\r\nthe end his good opinion of you in such sort, as I may well say he is\r\nyour very singular good lord, and resolved that he would write at length\r\nhis opinion unto you … for he plainly said ye had shown yourself therein\r\nsuch a faithful servant, and by that, most witty councillor unto the\r\nKing’s Majesty and his proceedings, as was scarce the like within his\r\nrealm.” Whalley concludes his letter by urging Cecil to remonstrate with\r\nSomerset. Whether he did so or not is unknown; but certainly for the next\r\nthree months there is no hint of any serious renewal of the quarrel:\r\nthe interminable proceedings against Gardiner continued, under Cecil’s\r\ndirection, without a word from Somerset, and the measures against the\r\nPrincess Mary’s mass continued unchecked.\r\n\r\nThe French alliance was now in full flush. All through the autumn the\r\nstately embassy from Henry II. confirming the treaty, and bringing the\r\nOrder of St. Michael to Edward, was splendidly entertained at court;\r\nthe Emperor’s troubles were closing in around him; Northumberland could\r\nafford to flout his remonstrance about the treatment of the Princess\r\nMary; and by the beginning of October, Northumberland’s power was at its\r\nheight. On the 4th October he assumed his dukedom, Dorset was made Duke\r\nof Suffolk, the Earl of Wiltshire was created Marquis of Winchester, and\r\nCheke and Cecil were dubbed knights (although several of the latter’s\r\nfriends had insisted upon calling him Sir William months before).[38]\r\nThen it was that the blow fell upon Somerset. We have seen how Cecil\r\nbore himself to his former master at the first hint of danger on the\r\n14th October; and though we have no letters of his own to indicate his\r\nsubsequent attitude, a few words in the confidential letters of his\r\ncorrespondents allow us to surmise what it was.\r\n\r\nSomerset was imprisoned on the 16th October (1551). On the 27th,\r\nPickering, the Ambassador in Paris, writes that “he is glad Cecil\r\nis found to be undefiled with the folly of this unfortunate Duke of\r\nSomerset.” But Morysine, Cecil’s old Lincolnshire friend, the Ambassador\r\nin Germany, reflects, evidently with exactitude, the tone which Cecil\r\nmust have adopted. He speaks of Somerset as the Secretary’s old friend,\r\nand congratulates Cecil that he has not been dragged down with him. “For\r\nit were a way to make an end of amity, if, when men fall, their friends\r\nshould forthwith therefore be troubled.” He plainly sees, he says, that\r\nthe mark Cecil shoots at is their master’s service; “A God’s blessing!\r\nlet the Duke bear his own burden, or cast it where he can.”[39] Morysine\r\nmight have saved his wisdom; Cecil would certainly bear no other man’s\r\nburden if he could help it.\r\n\r\nThrough all this critical time Sir William was indefatigable. His wife\r\nlived usually retired from the court, at their home at Wimbledon; but\r\nCecil’s town house at Cannon Row, Westminster, was the scene of ceaseless\r\nbusiness, for Petre, the joint-Secretary, was ill disposed, and did\r\nlittle. The Duchess of Suffolk, Lord Clinton, and all the Lincolnshire\r\nfolk used Cecil unsparingly in all their suits and troubles, and they\r\nhad many. Cecil’s own properties were now very extensive, and were\r\nconstantly augmented by purchases and grants. He had been appointed\r\nRecorder of Boston in the previous year (May 1551). Northumberland\r\nconsulted and deferred to him at every point; Cranmer sent to him the\r\nhost of Protestant refugees from Germany and France: no matter what\r\nbusiness was in hand, or whose it was, it inevitably found its way\r\ninto Sir William Cecil’s study, and by him was dealt with moderately,\r\npatiently, and wisely.\r\n\r\nIn the war of faiths he was the universal arbitrator, and his task was\r\nnot an easy one. The clergy had sunk to the lowest depth of degradation,\r\nand cures of souls had been given by patrons to domestic servants, and\r\noften to persons unable to read. The returned refugees from Switzerland\r\nhad many of them brought back Calvinistic methods and beliefs, and\r\nbetween their rigidity and the English Catholicism of Henry VIII. all\r\ngrades of ritual were practised. Cranmer was at the head of a commission\r\nto settle a form of liturgy and the Articles for the Church, Cecil, of\r\ncourse, being a member. After immense labour, forty-two Articles were\r\nagreed upon—reduced to thirty-nine ten years afterwards—but before\r\nfinally submitting them to Parliament and Convocation for adoption,\r\nCranmer referred them absolutely to Cecil and Cheke, “the two great\r\npatrons of the Reformation at court.”[40]\r\n\r\nIn foreign affairs, also, Cecil arranged everything but the main line\r\nof policy which Northumberland’s plans dictated. We have seen how the\r\nquestion of aid to the Protestant princes of Germany was referred to his\r\nconsideration, and the help refused. The subject was shortly made a much\r\nlarger one by the utter defeat of the Emperor by his former henchman,\r\nMaurice of Saxony, and the invasion of Luxembourg by the French (July\r\n1552). The tables were now turned indeed. By the peace of Passau the\r\nProtestant princes extorted the religious liberty they had in vain\r\nprayed for, and it was seen that for a time Charles’s power was broken.\r\nA considerable party in England, faithful to old traditions, were in a\r\nfever of alarm at the growth of the power of France, and Stukeley told\r\nthe King that Henry II. had confided to him his intention to capture\r\nCalais.[41]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, ready to snatch at any straw, sent an ambassador to\r\nEngland in September 1552 to claim the aid to which, under the treaty\r\nof 1542, he was entitled from England if France invaded his territory.\r\nThe whole question was referred to Cecil; and, as a specimen of his\r\npatient, judicial style, his report, as given in the King’s Journal, is\r\nreproduced here. It will be seen that he affects impartially to weigh\r\nboth sides, but his fear of French aggression is made as clear as was\r\nprudent, considering Northumberland’s leanings.[42] Throughout the\r\nwhole of his official life this was the way in which he dealt with all\r\nreally important questions referred to him, and his leading principle\r\nwas to strike a middle course, which would allow England to remain\r\nopenly friendly with the House of Burgundy without breaking with France,\r\nand to keep the latter power out of Flanders, while still defending\r\nProtestantism, which the ruler of Flanders was pledged to destroy.\r\n\r\nHow his actions usually squared with his axioms is seen, amongst other\r\nthings, from his constant efforts to extend the commerce and wealth\r\nof England. Amongst the apophthegms which he most affected are the\r\nfollowing:[43] “A realm can never be rich that hath not an intercourse\r\nand trade of merchandise with other nations,” and “A realm must needs be\r\npoor that carryeth not out more (merchandise) than it bringeth in.” In\r\nconsequence of the privileges granted to the Hanse merchants, nearly the\r\nwhole of the export trade of England had been concentrated into the hands\r\nof foreigners, and in the year that Cecil was appointed Secretary of\r\nState, the Steelyard Corporation is said to have exported 44,000 lengths\r\nof English cloth, whereas all the other London merchants together had not\r\nshipped more than 1100 lengths.[44] Cecil was in favour of establishing\r\nprivileged cloth markets at Southampton and Hull, and of placing\r\nimpediments on the exportation of cloths first-hand by foreigners, until\r\nthe new markets had succeeded in attracting customers from abroad, so\r\nthat the merchants’ profits would remain in England as well as the\r\nmoney spent here by the foreign buyers. Although this particular project\r\nultimately fell through, owing to the King’s death and other causes,\r\nCecil throughout his life laboured incessantly to increase English trade\r\nand navigation, by favouring the establishment of foreign weavers in\r\nvarious parts of the country, by laws for the protection of fisheries, by\r\nthe promotion of trading corporations, like the Russian Company, of which\r\nhe was one of the founders, by the rehabilitation of the coinage, and\r\nby a host of other measures, to some of which reference will be made in\r\ntheir chronological order.\r\n\r\nThe position of affairs during the last months of Edward’s life was\r\nbroadly this: Protestant uniformity was being imposed upon the country\r\nwith a severity unknown under the rule of Somerset; Northumberland’s\r\nplans for the elevation of Jane Grey to the throne were maturing;\r\nSouthampton, Paget, Arundel, Beaumont, and the Catholics were in disgrace\r\nor exile; and De Noailles, the new French Ambassador, was working his\r\nhardest to help Northumberland, when the time should come, to exclude\r\nfrom the throne the half-Spanish Princess Mary. But though Sir William\r\nCecil was the channel through which most of the business passed, he\r\navoided as much as possible personal identification with Northumberland’s\r\nplans. It must have needed all his tact, for Northumberland consulted\r\nand deferred to him in everything, and as the time approached for him\r\nto act, was evidently apprehensive, and stayed away from the Council.\r\nThis was resented by his colleagues, as will be seen from his letter to\r\nCecil of 3rd January 1553[45] from Chelsea, saying that “he has never\r\nabsented himself from the King’s service but through ill-health. The\r\nItalian proverb is true: a faithful servant will become a perpetual ass.\r\nHe wishes to retire and end his days in tranquillity, as he fears he is\r\ngoing to be very ill.” When it came to illness, diplomatic or otherwise,\r\nCecil was a match for his master. He had been, according to his diary, in\r\nimminent danger of death in the previous year, at his house at Wimbledon;\r\nand in the spring of 1553 he again fell seriously sick. During May,\r\nSecretary Petre constantly wrote to him hoping he would soon recover and\r\nbe back again at court. Lord Audley comforted him by sending several\r\ncurious remedies for his malady, amongst which is “a stewed sowe pygge of\r\nix dayes olde”;[46] and the Marquis of Winchester was equally solicitous\r\nto see the Secretary back to the Council again. Northumberland evidently\r\ntried to keep him satisfied by grants and favours, for he conferred\r\nupon him a lease of Combe Park, Surrey, part of Somerset’s lands; the\r\nlands in Northampton held for life by Richard Cecil, his father, were\r\nregranted to Sir William on his death, and during the Secretary’s illness\r\nand absence from court he received the office of Chancellor of the Order\r\nof the Garter, with an income of 100 marks a year and fees.[47] But\r\nCecil’s illness, real or feigned,[48] made him in no hurry to return\r\nand take a prominent part in Northumberland’s dangerous game, which was\r\nnow patent. During his absence his brother-in-law, Sir John Cheke, was\r\nappointed as an additional Secretary of State to help Petre (June 1553),\r\nand his fervent Protestantism and weakness of will made him a less wary\r\ninstrument than Sir William in the final stages of the intrigue.\r\n\r\nIt was during Cecil’s absence from court in May that Lady Jane Grey was\r\nmarried to Northumberland’s son Guildford Dudley;[49] but by the time\r\nthe plot was ready for consummation, Sir William could stay away no\r\nlonger, and was at work again in his office. The letter, dated 11th June\r\n1553, addressed to the Lord Chief-Justice and other judges, summoning\r\nthem to the royal presence, was signed by Cecil, as well as by Cheke\r\nand Petre. When the young King handed to the Chief-Justice a memorandum\r\nof his intention to set aside King Henry’s will, and leave the crown\r\nto the descendants of Henry’s youngest sister Mary, to the deprivation\r\nof his daughters, the Chief-Justice told him that such a settlement\r\nwould be illegal. The King insisted that a new deed of settlement must\r\nbe drawn up. The next day at Ely Place, when Northumberland threatened\r\nChief-Justice Montagu as a traitor, Petre was present, but not Cecil;\r\nbut he must have been at the remarkable Council meeting on the 14th\r\nJune, when the Chief-Justice and the other judges with tears in their\r\neyes were hectored into drawing up the fateful will disinheriting Mary\r\nand Elizabeth; for upon Northumberland insisting that every one present\r\nshould sign the document, he, Cecil, like the rest of them—with the\r\nhonourable exception of Sir John Hales—dared not refuse, and appended his\r\nname to it. He was probably sorry that his illness did not delay him a\r\nlittle longer at Wimbledon, for shortly before he had, in a conversation\r\nwith Roger Alford, one of the confidential members of his household,\r\nexpressed an intention to be no party to a change in the order of the\r\nsuccession. Alford relates the story.[50] He was walking in Greenwich\r\nPark with Cecil, when the latter told him that he knew some such plan was\r\nin contemplation, “but that he would never be a partaker in that device.”\r\nIf Alford is to be believed, Northumberland was from the first suspicious\r\nof Cecil’s absence. He says that the Secretary feared assassination,\r\nand went armed, against his usual practice, visiting London secretly at\r\nnight only, and concealed his valuables. His household biographer also\r\nsays that he incurred the particular displeasure of Northumberland “for\r\nmislyking or not consenting to the Duke’s purpose touching the Lady\r\nJane.”[51] And Alford, in his testimony in Cecil’s favour, asserted\r\nthat the latter told him that he had refused to sign the settlement\r\nas a Councillor, but only did so as a witness, which the paper itself\r\ndisproves. The position of Cecil was indeed a most difficult one. He\r\nwas not a brave or heroic man, he hated extreme courses, and this was a\r\njuncture where his usual non-committal _via media_ was of no avail. Of\r\nthe two evils he chose the lesser, and not only signed the settlement\r\nlike the rest of the Councillors, but also the instrument by which\r\ncertain members pledged themselves on oath to carry it out. But though\r\nhe, like others, was terrorised into bending to Northumberland’s will,\r\nit is certain that he disliked the business, made no secret of his\r\nunwillingness to acquiesce in it, and separated himself from it at the\r\nearliest possible moment that he could do so with safety. There is in the\r\nLansdowne MSS.[52] a paper in Cecil’s hand, written after the accession\r\nof Mary, in which is contained his exculpation. As it throws much light\r\non the matter, and upon Cecil’s own character, it will be useful to quote\r\nit at length. It is headed “A briefe note of my submission and of my\r\ndoings.\r\n\r\n    “1. My submission with all lowliness that any heart can\r\n    conceive.\r\n\r\n    “2. My misliking of the matter when I heard it secretly;\r\n    whereupon I made conveyance away of my lands, part of my goods,\r\n    my leases, and my raiment.\r\n\r\n    “3. I determined to suffer for saving my conscience; whereof\r\n    the witnesses, Sir Anthony Cooke, Nicholas Bacon, Esq.,\r\n    Laurence D’Eresby of Louth; two of my suite, Roger Alford and\r\n    William Cawood.\r\n\r\n    “4. Of my purpose to stand against the matter, be also witness\r\n    Mr. Petre and Mr. Cheke.\r\n\r\n    “5. I did refuse to subscribe the book when none of the Council\r\n    did refuse: in what peril I refer it to be considered by them\r\n    who know the Duke.\r\n\r\n    “6. I refused to make a proclamation, and turned the labour\r\n    to Mr. Throckmorton, whose conscience, I saw, was troubled\r\n    therewith, misliking the matter.\r\n\r\n    “7. I eschewed writing the Queen’s highness bastard, and\r\n    therefore the Duke wrote the letter himself, which was sent\r\n    abroad in the realm.[53]\r\n\r\n    “8. I eschewed to be at the drawing of the proclamation for the\r\n    publishing of the usurper’s title, being specially appointed\r\n    thereto.\r\n\r\n    “9. I avoided the answer of the Queen’s highness’ letter.\r\n\r\n    “10. I avoided also the writing of all the public letters of\r\n    the realm.\r\n\r\n    “11. I wrote no letter to Lord La Warr as I was commanded.\r\n\r\n    “12. I dissembled the taking of my horse and the raising of\r\n    Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire, and avowed the pardonable\r\n    lie where it was suspected to my danger.\r\n\r\n    “13. I practised with the Lord Treasurer to win the Lord Privy\r\n    Seal, that I might by Lord Russell’s means cause Windsor Castle\r\n    to serve the Queen, and they two to levy the west parts for the\r\n    Queen’s service. I have the Lord Treasurer’s letter to Lord\r\n    St. John for to keep me safe if I could not prevail in the\r\n    enterprise of Windsor Castle, and my name was feigned to be\r\n    Harding.\r\n\r\n    “14. I did open myself to the Earl of Arundel, whom I found\r\n    thereto disposed; and likewise I did the like to Lord Darcy,\r\n    who heard me with good contentation, whereof I did immediately\r\n    tell Mr. Petre, for both our comfort.\r\n\r\n    “15. I did also determine to flee from them if the consultation\r\n    had not taken effect, as Mr. Petre can tell, who meant the\r\n    like.\r\n\r\n    “16. I purposed to have stolen down to the Queen’s highness, as\r\n    Mr. Gosnold can tell, who offered to lead me thither, as I knew\r\n    not the way.\r\n\r\n    “17. I had my horses ready at Lambeth for the purpose.\r\n\r\n    “18. I procured a letter from the Lords that the Queen’s\r\n    tenants of Wimbledon should not go with Sir Thomas Caverden;\r\n    and yet I never gave one man warning so much as to be in\r\n    readiness, and yet they sent to me for the purpose, and I\r\n    willed them to be quiet. I might as steward there make for the\r\n    Queen’s service a hundred men to serve.\r\n\r\n    “19. When I sent into Lincolnshire for my horses, I sent but\r\n    for five horses and eight servants, and charged that none of my\r\n    tenants should be stirred.\r\n\r\n    “20. I caused my horses, being indeed but four, to be taken up\r\n    in Northamptonshire; and the next day following I countermanded\r\n    them again by my letters, remaining in the country and\r\n    notoriously there known.\r\n\r\n    “21. When this conspiracy was first opened to me, I did fully\r\n    set me to flee the realm, and was dissuaded by Mr. Cheke, who\r\n    willed me for my satisfaction to read a dialogue of Plato where\r\n    Socrates, being in prison, was offered to escape and flee, and\r\n    yet he would not. I read the dialogue, whose reasons, indeed,\r\n    did stay me.\r\n\r\n    “Finally, I beseech her Highness that in her grace I may feel\r\n    some difference from others that have more plainly offended\r\n    and yet be partakers of her Highness’ bountifulness and grace;\r\n    if difference may be made I do differ from them whom I served,\r\n    and also them that had liberty after their enforcement to\r\n    depart, by means whereof they did, both like noblemen and true\r\n    subjects, show their duties to their sovereign lady. The like\r\n    whereof was my devotion to have done if I might have had the\r\n    like liberty, as knoweth God, the searcher of all hearts,\r\n    whose indignation I call upon me if it be not true.\r\n\r\n    “‘Justus adjutorius meus Dominus qui salvos facit rectos\r\n    corde’—‘God save the Queen in all felicity,’\r\n\r\n                                                     “W. CECILL.”[54]\r\n\r\nThe document shows us the real William Cecil. It is probably quite\r\ntrue: he had taken care, whilst remaining a member of Northumberland’s\r\nCouncil, and openly acquiescing in his acts, to make himself safe in\r\neither case. Throgmorton and Cheke might be made scapegoats—as Davison\r\nwas years afterwards—but Jane or Mary, Protestant or Catholic, the first\r\nconsideration for William Cecil was not unnaturally William Cecil’s own\r\nhead. He was probably not worse than the other members of the Council,\r\nfor most of them acted in a similar manner, and when at length they\r\nturned against Northumberland, and openly declared for Mary, Sir William\r\nwas safe to choose the winning side.\r\n\r\nKing Edward died at Greenwich on the 6th July 1553, and on the 10th, Lady\r\nJane was proclaimed Queen by virtue of his settlement by patent.[55] Two\r\ndays afterwards the Council in the Tower learnt that the Lady Mary was\r\nrallying powerful friends about her in Kenninghall Castle, Norfolk, and\r\nit was agreed that Queen Jane’s father, the Duke of Suffolk, should lead\r\na force to capture and bring her to London. But the girl Queen begged so\r\nhard that her father might remain by her side that her tears prevailed;\r\n“whereupon the Councell perswaded the Duke of Northumberland to take that\r\nvoyage upon him, saying that no man was so fit therefor, because he had\r\natchieved the victorie in Norfolk once already, … besides that, he was\r\nthe best man of war in the realm.… ‘Well,’ quoth the Duke then, ‘since ye\r\nthink it good I and mine will goe, not doubting of your fidelity to the\r\nQuene’s Majesty, which I leave in your custody.’”[56]\r\n\r\nNorthumberland hurriedly completed his preparations at Durham Place,\r\nand urged the Council to send powers and directions after him to reach\r\nhim at Newmarket. He insisted upon having the warrant of the Council\r\nfor every step he took in order to pledge them all; but at the farewell\r\ndinner-party with them it is clear that his mind was ill at ease, and his\r\nheart already sinking. He appealed humbly to his colleagues not to betray\r\nhim. “If,” he said, “we thought you wolde through malice, conspiracie, or\r\ndiscentyon, leave us your frendes in the breers (briars) and betray us,\r\nwe could as well sondery (sundry) ways foresee and provide for our own\r\nsafeguards as any of you by betraying us can do for yours.” He reminds\r\nthem of their oath of allegiance to Queen Jane, made freely to her, “who\r\nby your and our enticement is rather of force placed therein than by hir\r\nowne seking;” again points out that they are as deeply pledged on each\r\npoint as he himself. “But if ye meane deceat, though not furthwith, God\r\nwill revenge the same. I can say no more, but in this troblesome tyme\r\nwishe you to use constaunte hartes, abandoning all malice, envy, and\r\nprivat affections.” Some of the Council protested their good faith. “I\r\npray God yt be so,” quod the Duke; “let us go to dyner.”[57]\r\n\r\nCecil must have been present at this scene, and when Northumberland left\r\nLondon on his way to Cambridge, “none,” as he himself remarked, “not\r\none, saying God spede us,” Sir William must have known as well, or\r\nbetter, than any of them that the house of cards was falling, and that\r\nNorthumberland was a doomed man. The moment he was gone, Cecil, like the\r\nrest of them, strove to betray him. The ships on the east coast declared\r\nfor Mary, the people of London were almost in revolt already, the nobles\r\nin the country flocked to the rightful Queen. On the 19th July, Mary was\r\nproclaimed by the Council at Baynard’s Castle, and the joy was general:\r\n“the Earle of Pembroke threwe awaye his cape full of angeletes. I saw\r\nmoney throwne out at windowes for joy, and the bonfires weare without\r\nnomber,” says an eye-witness.[58] Sir John Cheke was present at this\r\nstirring scene, upon which he must have looked with a wry face; but, as\r\nwe have seen by his submission, Cecil had already been busy trimming and\r\nfacing both ways. He first sent his wife’s sister, Lady Bacon, to meet\r\nthe new Queen, whom she knew, and as soon as might be himself started for\r\nthe eastern counties, to greet the rising sun.[59] Lady Bacon had paved\r\nthe way, and, to make quite sure, Cecil sent his henchman Alford ahead to\r\nsee her at Ipswich, and learn what sort of reception her brother-in-law\r\nmight expect. Her message was “that the Queen thought well of her brother\r\nCecil, and said he was a very honest man.” Then Sir William went on, and\r\nmet Mary at Newhall, Essex, where he explained matters as best he could.\r\nWhen he was reproached with arming his four horsemen to oppose Queen\r\nMary, he explained, as we have seen, that he himself had secretly caused\r\nthem to be detained. No doubt the sardonic disillusioned Queen must have\r\nsmiled grimly as she read the shifty, ungenerous “submission,” already\r\nquoted in full; and however “honest” she may have considered Lady Bacon’s\r\nbrother-in-law, she knew he was not a bold man or a thorough partisan of\r\nhers, and when her ministry was formed, Cecil was no longer Secretary—but\r\nhe did not, like poor Sir John Cheke, find himself a prisoner in the\r\nTower.\r\n\r\nSir William’s entry in his journal on the occasion of the King’s death\r\nis a curious one,[60] and seems to indicate his general dislike of his\r\nposition under Northumberland, whose home and foreign policy, as we have\r\nseen, were both diametrically opposite to those dictated by the training\r\nand character of Cecil.[61] The only point upon which there could\r\nhave been a real community of aims between them was that of religion,\r\nand on that point Northumberland, who subsequently avowed himself a\r\nCatholic,[62] was false to his own convictions.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of the reign of Edward, Cecil had continued to enrich\r\nhimself by grants, stewardships, reversions, and offices; not of course\r\nto the same extent as Somerset, Northumberland, Clinton, or Winchester,\r\nfor he was a moderate man and loved safety, but on the accession of\r\nMary he must have been very rich. During his mother’s life, which was\r\na long one, he always looked upon Burghley House as hers, although he\r\nspent large sums of his own money upon buildings and improvements;\r\nbut he inherited from his father large estates in Northamptonshire,\r\nRutland, Lincolnshire, and elsewhere. We have already noticed that he\r\nobtained the Crown manor of Wimbledon and other grants; but, in addition\r\nto those already noted, he obtained, in October 1551, the period of\r\nSomerset’s sacrifice, grants of the manor of Berchamstow and Deeping, in\r\nLincolnshire; the manor and hall of Thetford, in the same county; the\r\nreversion of the manor of Wrangdike, Rutland; the manor of Liddington,\r\nRutland, and a moiety of the rectory of Godstow. He was a large purchaser\r\nof land also in the county of Lincoln; so that although his household\r\nhistorian asserts that his lands never brought him in more than £4000\r\na year, his expenses were on a very lavish scale, and he had, as his\r\nfriend the Duchess of Suffolk says in one of her letters to him, brought\r\nhis wares to a good market. By his embroiderer’s account, already\r\nquoted, we see that at this period of his life he maintained thirty-six\r\nservitors wearing his badge and livery; but in the time of Elizabeth his\r\nestablishments were on a truly princely footing. He had eighty servants\r\nwearing his livery, and we are told that the best gentlemen in England\r\ncompeted to enter his service; “I have nombered in his howse attending at\r\ntable twenty gentlemen of his retayners of £1000 per annum a peece, in\r\npossession or reversion, and of his ordinarie men, as many more, some\r\nworth £1000, some worth 3, 5, 10, yea, £20,000, daily attending his\r\nservice.”\r\n\r\nBut though acquisitive and fond of surrounding himself with the\r\naccessories of wealth and great standing, he had few of the tastes of\r\nthe territorial aristocracy, whom he imitated. Arms, sport, athletic\r\nexercises, did not appeal to him. From his youth he dressed gravely and\r\nsoberly; and at a time, subsequently, when splendour and extravagance in\r\nattire were the rule, he still kept to his fur-trimmed gown and staid\r\nraiment. He was an insatiable book buyer and collector of heraldic and\r\ngenealogical manuscripts. Sir William Pickering in Paris, and Sir John\r\nMason, had orders to buy for him all the attractive new books published\r\nin France; and Chamberlain in Brussels had a similar commission. The\r\nformer mentions in one letter (15th Dec. 1551, State Papers, Foreign)\r\nhaving purchased Euclid with the figures, Machiavelli, Le Long, the New\r\nTestament in Greek, _L’Horloge des Princes_, _Discours de la Guerre_,\r\nNotes on Aristotle in Italian, and others; and the Hatfield Papers\r\ncontain very numerous memoranda of books and genealogies bought by\r\nCecil, or sent to him as presents from his friends and suitors. Wotton,\r\nfor instance, when he was abroad and wished to oblige his friend, says:\r\n“If I knew anye kind of bookes heere (Poissy) which yow like, I wold\r\nbye them for yow, and bring them home with some of myne owne. Here is\r\n_Clemens Alexandrinus_ and _Theodoretus in Epistolas Pauli_, turned into\r\nLatin. But because I heere that yow have _Clemens Alexandrinus_ in Greek\r\nalready, I suppose yow care not for him in Latin.”[63]\r\n\r\nHis love of study, too, extended to interest in others. He was a constant\r\nbenefactor to Cambridge University, and St. John’s particularly, and\r\ninfluenced the King[64] to bequeath £100 per annum to the foundation\r\nin his will. Shortly before the young King’s death, also, he appears to\r\nhave granted to Cecil’s own town of Stamford—almost certainly at his\r\ninstance—funds for the foundation of a grammar school there, of which Sir\r\nWilliam was to be the life governor, and there is ample evidence that the\r\nestablishment of the large number of educational benefactions with which\r\nthe young King signalised his reign—primarily at the instance of Bishop\r\nHooper—was powerfully promoted by Cecil; who seems also, on his own\r\naccount, to have always maintained a certain number of scholars,[65] and\r\nto have been the universal resource of students, teachers, and colleges,\r\nin their troubles and difficulties. The accession of Mary, which threw\r\nCecil out of office, or, as he puts it, gave him his liberty, did not\r\ndeprive him of his large means, or limit his enlightened activity in\r\nother directions. But for a time after the death of Edward, he remained,\r\nso far as so prominent and able a man could do so, simply a private\r\ncitizen. His household biographer asserts “that Mary had a good liking\r\nfor him as a Councillor, and would have appointed him if he had changed\r\nhis religion.” Although he puts a grandiloquent speech in Cecil’s mouth,\r\nrefusing office, saying much about preferring God’s service before that\r\nof the Queen, it is extremely doubtful whether Mary ever offered to call\r\nhim to her Council. Towards the end of her reign, when Elizabeth’s early\r\naccession was inevitable, however, the Council itself was desirous of\r\nconciliating him. Lloyd (“State Worthies”) says of him: “When he was out\r\nof place he was not out of service in Queen Mary’s days, his abilities\r\nbeing as necessary in those times as his inclinations, and that Queen’s\r\nCouncil being as ready to advance him _at last_ as they were to _use_ him\r\nall her reign.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n1553-1558\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the trial and execution of Northumberland and his accomplices,\r\nCecil remained prudently in the background. Gardiner, Norfolk, Courtney,\r\nBonner, and the other prisoners in the Tower were released. Home and\r\nforeign policy changed, the Catholics were buoyed with hope, and the\r\nEmperor’s Ambassador was in full favour, whilst the Protestants were\r\ntimorous and apprehensive, and the French Ambassador ill at ease, for his\r\nKing was at war with the Emperor, and had from the first endeavoured to\r\nminimise the claims of Mary.[66]\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd August the new Queen entered London with her sister near her,\r\nand preparations were at once set afoot for her coronation (1st October).\r\nCecil was no longer in office, and was commanded by the Queen to send\r\nher the seals and register of the Garter on the 21st September;[67] but\r\nhe appears to have gone to the expense of new liveries for his servants\r\nin honour of the occasion. Twelve of his servants were given garments\r\nof the best cloth with badges, eleven received one and a quarter yards\r\nof the best cloth each, with second-class cognisances, and nine more\r\nhad cloth of second quality, one coat being left with Lady Cecil to\r\nbestow as she pleased.[68] On the same document Sir William himself has\r\nmade numerous notes as to the price of these materials, which, if we\r\ndid not already know it by many other testimonies, would prove that,\r\nthough his expenditure was great, he was careful of the items of it. His\r\nfather, the Yeoman of the Robes, had died in the previous year (1552),\r\nand apparently the office had remained in abeyance, being temporarily\r\nadministered by Sir William. His neighbour Sir Edward Dymoke, of\r\nScrivelsby, Lincolnshire, had, in accordance with his tenure, to act as\r\nchampion at the Queen’s coronation, and was entitled to his equipment out\r\nof the office of robes. A few days before the coronation ceremony Dymoke\r\napplied for his outfit. Some of the articles were not on hand and had to\r\nbe bought of one Lenthal; and the champion begged Cecil to vouch for the\r\npurchase, consisting of “a shrowd, a girdle, a scabbard of velvett, two\r\ngilt partizans, a pole axe, a chasing staff and a pair of gilt spurs, the\r\nvalue in all being £6, 2s. 8d.” Apparently Cecil took no notice of the\r\napplication, and in an amusing letter at Hatfield, the champion complains\r\nbitterly, nearly two months after the coronation, that he could never\r\nget his outfit. Cecil insisted upon a warrant from the Queen; but, said\r\nDymoke, he had received all his equipment without warrant at the previous\r\ncoronation, and he prays Cecil not to be “more straytor” than his father\r\nwas. He had his cup of gold, his horse, and trappings, and crimson satin,\r\nwithout warrant then, and why, he asks, should one be required now. “I do\r\nnot pass so much of the value of the allowance as I do for the precedent\r\nto hinder those who do come after me, if I do lose it this time.”\r\n\r\nCecil does not seem to have absented himself from court, though he\r\npassed more of his time than hitherto at Wimbledon. Wyatt rose and fell;\r\nElizabeth and Courtney suffered under the Queen’s displeasure; Cheke\r\nand Cooke went to exile; Cecil’s old friend the Duchess of Suffolk and\r\nher husband Mr. Bertie fled to Germany; Carews, Staffords, Tremaynes,\r\nKilligrews, Fitzwilliams, the ex-Ambassador Pickering, and hundreds\r\nlike them, took refuge abroad from the country over which a Spanish\r\nKing, with his half-Spanish Queen, were soon to be supreme. Cranmer,\r\nCecil’s friend from boyhood, and other Protestant Churchmen, filled\r\nthe rooms in the Tower vacated by those whom Cecil had been active in\r\nprosecuting, but Cecil himself lived rich and influential, if no longer\r\npolitically powerful, and no hand was raised against him. That he was\r\na conforming Catholic is certain, quite apart from Father Persons’\r\nspiteful description of his exaggerated devotion; “frequenting masses,\r\nsaid litanies with the priest, laboured a pair of great beads which\r\nhe continually carried, preached to his parishioners in Stamford, and\r\nasked pardon for his errors in King Edward’s time.” This statement of\r\nitself would not suffice were it not supported by better evidence; but\r\nalthough there is a dearth of such evidence at the beginning of Mary’s\r\nreign, there is abundance of it later. At the Record Office, among\r\nother papers of the same sort, there exists the Easter book for 1556,\r\nheaded, “The names of them that dwelleth in the pariche of Vembletoun\r\nthat was confessed and received the Sacrament of the altar;” the first\r\nentry being, “My master Sir Wilyem Cecell, and my lady Myldread his\r\nwyff;”[69] and Cecil’s accounts for this period contain many entries of\r\nthe cost of his oblations and gifts to the altar. He retained, moreover,\r\nthe benefices of Putney and Mortlake, of which he kept strict account;\r\nand in August 1557 the Dean and Chapter of Worcester addressed a letter\r\nof thanks to him for his annual contribution to his two churches, and\r\nassured him of their willingness to accede to his wishes and increase the\r\nstipends of the curates there.[70] There is therefore no doubt that, like\r\nPrincess Elizabeth and most of those who afterwards became her ministers,\r\nCecil was quite ready, in outward seeming at least, to adopt the ritual\r\ndecreed by the Court and Parliament.\r\n\r\nRenard, the Emperor’s Ambassador, had broached the idea of a marriage\r\nbetween Mary and Philip, the Prince of Spain, less than a week after\r\nthe Queen’s entry into London; and thenceforward the arrangements for\r\nthe match went forward apace. The people generally were in an agony of\r\nfear; Gardiner himself, the Queen’s Chancellor, and most of her wisest\r\nCouncillors, looked coldly upon the idea; they would rather she had\r\nmarried Courtney, and formed a close political alliance with the House\r\nof Spain. But the Queen was a daughter of Catharine of Aragon, and the\r\nexalted religious ideas of her race had caused her to look upon herself\r\nas the divinely-appointed being who was to bring to pass the salvation of\r\nher people, and this she knew could only be done by the power and money\r\nthat Spain could bring to her. The connection would enable her, too, to\r\nbe revenged upon France, which had befriended her mother’s supplanter,\r\nand was still subsidising revolution against her. Those who were\r\nCatholics first and Englishmen afterwards, applauded her determination\r\nto wed her Spanish cousin; and the priests in Rome watched, from the\r\nmoment of her advent, for the possibility of the restoration of England\r\nto the faith, and the disgorging of the plunder of the Church by those\r\nwho had swallowed it. Most of these saw in the Spanish match the probable\r\nrealisation of their hopes.\r\n\r\nImmediately after Mary’s accession the Pope had appointed Cardinal Pole\r\nto negotiate with these ends. He was an Englishman of the blood royal,\r\nwho had no special Spanish ends to serve: his one wish was to bring back\r\nEngland into the fold of the Church. But before he started on his journey\r\nto England, Charles V. took fright. His views were quite different. He\r\nand his son wanted to get political control over England for their own\r\ndynastic interests. So long as the religious element helped them in this,\r\nthey were glad to use it; but if the priests went too fast and too far,\r\nand caused disgust and reaction in England, their plans would fail. So,\r\nas usual when it was a choice between religion and politics by statesmen\r\nof that age, they chose politics. The difficulty was that the Churchmen\r\nhad expected that the return of England to the fold would necessarily\r\nmean the restitution of all ecclesiastical property. Pole himself was\r\nfull of this idea, and his first powers from the Pope gave him little\r\nor no discretion to abate the claim for entire and unconditional\r\nsurrender of the Church plunder. But at the instance of the Emperor,\r\nthe Pope was induced to grant to Pole full discretionary powers. Then\r\nhe was persuaded to send the Legate to France and Brussels on his way\r\nto England, with the ostensible purpose of mediating a peace between\r\nFrance and the Emperor, but really in order that he might be influenced\r\nin the Spanish interest, and his departure for England was thus delayed\r\nuntil it was considered prudent to let him go. It was not until he had\r\npromised that he would only act in accordance with the advice of the new\r\nKing-consort, Philip, that he was permitted to proceed on his mission,\r\nwith the certainty now, that the restitution of the Church property\r\nwould go no further than was dictated by the political interests which\r\nthe Emperor had nearest his heart. This happened in November 1554, four\r\nmonths after the Queen’s marriage, and the somewhat curious choice of\r\nPaget (Lord Privy Seal), Sir Edward Hastings, and Sir William Cecil, was\r\nmade to go and meet the Legate at Brussels, and bring him to England.\r\nTheir instructions,[71] evidently inspired by Philip, who was still in\r\nEngland, entirely confirm the above view of the subject. The envoys are\r\nto seek the Cardinal, and “to declare that the greatest, and almost the\r\nonly, means to procure the agreement of the noblemen and others of our\r\nCouncil (to the re-entry of England into the Church) was our promise\r\nthat the Pope would, at our suit, dispense with all possessors of any\r\nlands or goods of monasteries, colleges, or other ecclesiastical houses,\r\nto hold and enjoy quietly the same, without trouble or scruple.” Herein\r\nthe influence of the politicians is clearly visible; and the Churchmen\r\nfor fifty years afterwards attributed the failure of Catholic attempts\r\nin England to God’s anger at this paltering with the plunder of His\r\nproperty.[72] Cecil’s voyage was a short one. The entry in his journal\r\nruns thus: “_1554. viᵒ Novembris (ii. Mariæ) capi iter cum Domino Paget\r\net Magistro Hastings versus Casarem pro reducendo Cardinale_;” but in the\r\nlittle Perpetual Calendar at Hatfield the voyage is noted in English.\r\nThe journal continues: “_Venimus Bruxelles 11 Novēbris_;” and then,\r\n“_Redivimus 24ᵒ Westmonsterij cū Card. Polo_.”\r\n\r\nNo more is said of the events of the journey, or of Cecil’s negotiations\r\nwith the Cardinal; but it may be surmised that Pole at first would not\r\nlook very favourably upon Sir William, as during the correspondence with\r\nSomerset, in which Pole exhorted the Protector to desist from troubling\r\nCatholics, a somewhat rude communication was sent to him, which in his\r\nreply he attributed, not to the Protector himself, but to Cecil. It is\r\nprobable that Cecil was chosen, because, though outwardly a Catholic,\r\nhis views were known to be extremely moderate, and at the moment it was\r\nthese views which were most in accordance with the interests of England\r\nand Spain from the point of view of the Emperor and his son. It may\r\nbe assumed that a similar reason accounts for Cecil’s appointment in\r\nthe following May, 1555, to accompany the Cardinal to Calais, for the\r\npurpose of negotiating for a peace between France and the Emperor. Pole\r\nhad offered the mediation of England to Noailles some months before, but\r\nthe lukewarmness of the Emperor, the delay in the appointment of his\r\nenvoys, and the French military successes in Piedmont, had dragged the\r\nmatter out whilst an infinity of questions of procedure and personality\r\nwere being slowly settled. The French Ambassador protested against the\r\nappointment of the Earl of Pembroke or the Earl of Arundel, especially\r\nthe latter, a vain, giddy man, and a friend of Spain, to accompany the\r\nembassy. Gardiner, he said, would be sufficient to represent English\r\ninterests, with Pole as Papal Legate; and the addition of either of the\r\nEarls or of Paget was looked upon as an indication of a desire rather to\r\npick a fresh quarrel with France than to negotiate a peace.\r\n\r\nCecil would appear to have occupied quite a secondary position in the\r\nembassy, as he is never mentioned in the correspondence between the\r\nFrench envoys Constable Montmorenci and Cardinal Lorraine and Noailles\r\ndescribing the meetings. In any case, the negotiations, which took place\r\nat Marcq, equidistant from Calais, Ardres, and Gravelines, speedily fell\r\nthrough, and by the 26th June the attempt was abandoned; in consequence\r\nmainly of the insistence of the Emperor in the restoration of the Duke\r\nof Savoy to his dominions then occupied by the French. The apprehensions\r\nof the French Ambassador had not been entirely unfounded. It had been\r\nPhilip’s intention to ask the Parliament of 1554 for England’s armed aid\r\nin favour of the Emperor, but the indiscreet zeal of the Churchmen had\r\nalready brought about reaction, and the Parliament was hastily dissolved.\r\nIn the new Parliament of 1555, Cecil was elected, as he insinuates not by\r\nhis own desire, Knight of the Shire for Lincoln. In the previous year\r\n(February 1554) he had requested the aldermen of the borough of Grantham\r\nto elect a nominee of his their member. What would, no doubt, have been\r\na command when he was Secretary of State in the previous reign, could be\r\ndisregarded under Mary, and the aldermen politely informed him that they\r\nhad already made other arrangements.[73] It is quite understandable that\r\nto so prudent a man as Cecil it would have been much more agreeable to\r\nhave been represented by a nominee than to have sat personally in the\r\nParliament of 1555.\r\n\r\nThe Queen’s pregnancy had turned out a delusion. It was seen by the\r\nSpaniards now that the Queen herself was but a puppet in the hands of the\r\nCouncil, and that Philip would never be allowed to rule England, as had\r\nbeen intended, solely for the benefit of Spanish interests. The imperial\r\nplot had failed; and on the 26th August 1555, the King-consort took leave\r\nof his heartbroken wife, and went to his duties elsewhere. As soon as he\r\nhad gone, as Renard had wisely foretold, all barriers of prudence which\r\nhad hitherto, to some extent, restrained the persecution of Protestants,\r\nwere broken down. Philip left with the Queen strict instructions for the\r\nadministration of affairs, and notes of all Council meetings were sent\r\nto him, in order that he might still keep some control. But Cranmer was\r\narraigned, Ridley and Latimer were martyred, the restitution of alienated\r\ntithes, first-fruits, and tenths was proposed, the Protestant exiles\r\nabroad were recalled, under pain of confiscation of their property, the\r\nbishops were deprived, and throughout England the flames of persecution\r\nsoon spread unchecked.\r\n\r\nWhat King Philip wanted were English arms and money, to aid his father\r\nin the war, not the fires of Smithfield, or the blind zeal of the\r\npriests to set men’s hearts against the cause of Rome, which was his\r\nmain instrument. But the Parliament of 1555 and the Queen’s Council were\r\ndetermined to withhold aid to the Emperor’s war as long as they could.\r\nMoney there was none, the English ships were rotting and unmanned in\r\nport, men-at-arms were sulky at the idea of fighting for the Spaniard;\r\nbut burning Protestants and confiscating recusants’ property cost\r\nnothing, and so the game went on in despite of absent Philip. Amongst the\r\nthreatened exiles in Germany were many of Cecil’s friends, especially\r\nthe Duchess of Suffolk and Sir Anthony Cooke, who kept up a close\r\ncorrespondence with his son-in-law, but refused to conform and return\r\nto England. Whether it was the enactment against these friends,[74] or\r\nsome other of the confiscatory or extreme measures of the Government,\r\nthat Cecil opposed in the Parliament of 1555, is not quite certain; but\r\nan entry in his diary shows that he was in extreme peril as a result of\r\nhis action.[75] The entry is, as usual, in Latin. “On the 21st October,\r\nParliament was celebrated at Westminster, in which, although with danger\r\nto myself, I performed my duty; for although I did not wish it, yet being\r\nelected a Knight of the Shire for Lincoln, I spoke my opinion freely, and\r\nbrought upon me some odium thereby; but it is better to obey God than\r\nman.” The household biographer gives a fuller account of what probably is\r\nthe same matter: “In this Parliament (1555) Sir William Cecil was Knight\r\nfor the County of Lincoln. In the House of Commons little was done to the\r\nliking of the court. The Lords passed a bill for confiscating the estates\r\nof such as had fled for religion. In the Lower House it was rejected with\r\ngreat indignation. Warm speeches were made on this, and other occasions,\r\nparticularly in relation to a money bill, in all of which Sir William\r\nCecil delivered himself frankly.”[76] One day, especially, a measure\r\nwas before the House which the Queen wished to pass, and Sir William\r\nCourtney, Sir John Pollard, Sir Anthony Kingston, with other men from the\r\nwest, opposed. Sir William Cecil sided with them and spoke effectively,\r\nand after the House rose they came to him and invited themselves to dine\r\nwith them. He told them they would be welcome “so long as they did not\r\nspeak of any matter of Parliament.” Some, however, did so, and their host\r\nreminded them of the condition. The matter was conveyed to the Council,\r\nand the whole of the company was sent for and committed to custody. Sir\r\nWilliam himself was brought before his late colleagues and friends, Lord\r\nPaget and Sir William Petre. He said he desired they would not do with\r\nhim as with the rest, which was somewhat hard, namely, to commit him\r\nfirst, and then hear him afterwards, but prayed them first to hear him,\r\nand then commit him if he were guilty; whereupon Paget replied, “You\r\nspake like a man of experience;” and Cecil, as usual, cleared himself\r\nfrom blame.[77]\r\n\r\nDuring this period Cecil divided his time between Cannon Row, Wimbledon,\r\nand Burghley, occupying himself much whilst in the country with farming\r\nand horticulture. His accounts are very voluminous, and are frequently\r\nannotated in his own hand. Every payment is stated under its proper\r\nhead—kitchen, cellar, buttery, garden, and so forth; and the whole of the\r\nhousehold supplies, whether, as was usual, taken from his own farm, or\r\npurchased, are duly accounted for at current prices. The dinner-hour of\r\nthe family was 11 A.M., before which prayer was read in the chapel, and\r\nthe supper was served at 6 P.M.; these rules being observed at all his\r\nhouses, whether he was in residence or not. His charities were always\r\nlarge, and in his later years reached an average of £500 a year; and\r\nwherever he had property there was a regular system of distribution of\r\nrelief to the needy in the neighbourhood. His most intimate friends were\r\nstill some of the first people in England. As a moderate man he had now\r\ncommended himself to Pole; Lord Admiral Clinton, a great Lincolnshire\r\nmagnate, was evidently by his letters on terms of familiarity with him;\r\nthe Earl of Sussex, the Viceroy of Ireland, expressed himself anxious to\r\ndo him service;[78] Sir Philip Hoby and Lord Cobham vied with each other\r\nin inducing him and Lady Cecil to visit them at their respective Kentish\r\nseats; and Lord John Grey, on the occasion of his wife being delivered\r\nof a “gholly boye,” begs Cecil to stand godfather to the infant.[79]\r\nCecil’s wife had already given birth to a daughter, and in the Calendar\r\nDiary at Hatfield an entry against 5th December 1556 records, “Natus\r\nest Anna Cecil,” which event somewhat disappointed both Cecil and his\r\nfather-in-law, Cooke, in his exile, as they had earnestly looked for\r\na son. Cecil must have been a devoted husband, though probably an\r\nundemonstrative one, as the letters of Sir Anthony Cooke always praise\r\nhim for his goodness, both to his daughter and to himself in his poverty\r\nand banishment. Sir Philip Hoby, in one of his hearty letters during Lady\r\nCecil’s confinement, expresses sorrow that Sir William cannot visit him.\r\n“You should have been welcome if my Lady might have spared you, to whom\r\nyou have been as good a nurse as you would have her be to you;”[80] and\r\nseven weeks later he writes again (21st February), advising Cecil “to\r\ncome abroad, and not tarry so long with my Lady, and in such a stinking\r\ncity, the filthiest of the world.” Sir Nicholas Bacon and his wife, Lady\r\nCecil’s sister, were also frequent and kindly correspondents; and the\r\nCountess of Bedford, who with her children were left by her husband to\r\nCecil’s care on the Earl’s departure in command of the English contingent\r\nto aid the Emperor, referred all her business to him.[81] Cecil’s life,\r\nindeed, at this period was that of a noble of great wealth and influence,\r\nsurrounded by friends, occupied with the details of large estates and\r\nwith studious pursuits, in great request as trustee and intermediary\r\nfor other people’s affairs, openly conforming in religion, but of\r\nacknowledged moderate views, and keeping on fairly good terms with\r\nthe party in power, as did Sir Nicholas Bacon, Sir Thomas Smith, Roger\r\nAscham, and others in similar case.\r\n\r\nBut there was one element of Cecil’s activity to which no undue\r\nprominence was given, although it was great and continuous—namely, his\r\ncommunications with the Princess Elizabeth and his prudent efforts in\r\nher favour. From his first official employment at court, he had been\r\nappealed to by the Princess in questions requiring discretion. When he\r\nwas Secretary to the Protector (25th September 1549), Parry, the cofferer\r\nand factotum of Elizabeth, wrote to him the letter which has often been\r\nquoted,[82] in which he gives an account of the visit of the Venetian\r\nAmbassador to Ashridge: “Hereof her Grace hath, with all haste, commanded\r\nme to send unto you, and to advertise you, to the intent forthwith it may\r\nplease you, at her earnest request, either to move my Lord’s Grace, and\r\nto declare unto him yourself, or else forthwith to send word in writing,\r\nthat her Grace may know thereby, whether she shall herself write thereof\r\n… and in case ye shall advise her Grace to write, then so forthwith to\r\nadvertise her Grace.… Herein she desires you to use her trust as in\r\nthe rest.” It will be seen by this that Cecil was then considered by\r\nElizabeth as her friend. Another letter from Parry (September 1551)[83]\r\nis still more cordial: “I have enclosed herein her Grace’s letters, for\r\nso is her Grace’s commandment, which she desires you, according to her\r\ntrust, to deliver from her unto my Lord’s Grace, taking such opportunity\r\ntherein by your wisdom as thereby she may … hear from his Grace.… Her\r\nGrace commanded me to write this. ‘Write my commendations in your letters\r\nto Mr. Cecil that I am well assured, though I send not daily to him, that\r\nhe doth not, for all that, daily forget me; say, indeed, I assure myself\r\nthereof.’… I had forgotten to say to you that her Grace commanded me to\r\nsay to you for the excuse of her hand, that it is not now as good as\r\nshe trusts it shall be; her Grace’s unhealth hath made it weaker and so\r\nunsteady, and that this is the cause.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth, in common with most other people, was also very anxious to put\r\nher business affairs into Cecil’s hands, and in such matters as leases,\r\nsales of timber of her manors, and the like, Sir William’s services and\r\nadvice were often requisitioned by her. In April 1553 she had serious\r\ncomplaints to make of extortion and malversation on the part of the\r\nsteward (Keys) of certain of her manors which had been dedicated to\r\nthe support of the hospital of Ewelme; and she appointed Cecil as the\r\nprincipal member of a committee to examine closely into the whole matter,\r\n“as her Grace is determined to remove the violence and oppression,\r\nand to have the poor thoroughly considered.”[84] At the time that\r\nNorthumberland was casting about for a foreign husband for Elizabeth,\r\nsome prince who, though of Protestant leanings, should not be powerful\r\nenough to force her claims to the crown, Cecil seems to have suggested\r\nthe Duke of Ferrara’s son Francesco, but the proposal came to nothing.\r\nIt may, however, be accepted as certain that the intrigues of Noailles\r\non the one hand to pledge Elizabeth to marry Courtney, as proposed by\r\nPaget, and the persistent attempts of the Spanish party to pledge her to\r\nEmmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, found no support from Cecil, since\r\none marriage would have played into the hands of France, and the other\r\nwould have rendered the Catholics permanently supreme in England; and, as\r\nhas already been seen, Cecil’s great principle was to keep his country\r\nas far as possible free, both from Rome and from France. The consummate\r\ndexterity exhibited by Elizabeth during the troubled reign of Mary was\r\nexactly of a piece with Cecil’s own management of his affairs at the\r\nsame period; and although there is no proof that he in any way guided\r\nher action, it is in evidence that she kept up communication with him on\r\nmany subjects, and it is in the highest degree probable that she asked\r\nhis advice on the vital points, upon which on several occasions her very\r\nlife depended. Camden expressly says that she did so, and he is confirmed\r\nby Cecil’s household biographer; but if it be true, it must have been\r\ndone with great caution and care, for Cecil to have escaped, as he did,\r\nall suspicion when Elizabeth herself was deeply suspected after Wyatt’s\r\nrising. Cecil’s advice to the Princess, if given at all, was probably to\r\ndo as he himself endeavoured to do; namely, to conform as much as might\r\nbe necessary for her safety, and to avoid entanglements or engagements\r\nof every description. This at all events was the course they both\r\nsuccessfully followed.\r\n\r\nPhilip had at last dragged England into war against the wish of the whole\r\nof the Council except Paget, though the King had reluctantly to come and\r\nexert his personal influence on his wife before it could be done. At the\r\nbeginning of July 1557 he left her for the last time, and in a month\r\nthe victory of St. Quentin gave him the great chance of his life. He\r\nhesitated, dallied, and missed it; the English contingent sulky, unpaid,\r\nand discontented—the Spaniards said cowardly—clamoured to go home, and\r\nPhilip, not daring to add to his unpopularity in England, let them go.\r\nCalais and Guînes fell before the vigour of Francis of Guise (January\r\n1558), for the fortresses had been neglected both by Northumberland\r\nand Mary. When it was already too late, the King had urged the English\r\nCouncil to send reinforcements; but his envoy, Feria, crossed the Channel\r\nat the same time as the news that the last foothold of England on the\r\nContinent had gone.\r\n\r\nThenceforward it was evident that Mary’s days were numbered, and eyes\r\nwere already looking towards her successor. The war, never popular in\r\nEngland, became perfectly hateful. The people growled that waggon-loads\r\nof English money were being sent to Philip, and the Council, almost to\r\na man, resisted as much and as long as they dared, Philip’s constant\r\nrequests for English aid. When Parliament and the Council had been\r\ncajoled and squeezed to the utmost, Feria left in July 1558 to join\r\nhis master; but before doing so, he thought it prudent to pay a visit\r\nto Madame Elizabeth at Hatfield, with many significant hints of favour\r\nfrom his King in the time to come; none of which the Princess affected\r\nto understand. A few weeks before the Queen died, peace negotiations\r\nwere opened between England, France, and Spain; the foolish Earl of\r\nArundel, Dr. Thirlby (Bishop of Ely), and Cecil’s friend Dr. Wotton being\r\nsent to represent England. On the 7th November the Queen was known to\r\nbe dying, and the Council prevailed upon her to send a message to her\r\nsister confirming her right to succeed. Feria arrived a few days before\r\nunhappy Mary breathed her last, and already he found that “the people\r\nwere beginning to act disrespectfully towards the images and religious\r\npersons.”[85] From the 7th November until the Queen died, on the 17th,\r\nmatters were in the utmost confusion. All the bonds were breaking, and no\r\nman knew what would come next. The Council had for months been drifting\r\naway from Philip, and during the Queen’s last days were openly turning\r\nto her Protestant successor.\r\n\r\nBut their duty kept them mostly at court; whereas Cecil, being free from\r\noffice, went backwards and forwards between Cannon Row and Hatfield,\r\nmaking arrangements for the formation of a new Government when the\r\nsovereign should die. Feria writes that on the day the new Queen was\r\nproclaimed (17th November 1558), the Council decided that Archbishop\r\nHeath, Lord Admiral Clinton, the Earls of Shrewsbury, Pembroke, and\r\nDerby, and Lord William Howard should proceed to Hatfield, whilst the\r\nrest stayed behind; “but every one wanted to be the first to get out.”\r\nWhen they arrived at the residence of the young Queen, Cecil was already\r\nthere and the appointments decided upon. Cecil was the first Councillor\r\nsworn, and was appointed Secretary of State;[86] the others mentioned\r\nabove, with Paget and Bedford, being subsequently admitted; and the\r\nfaithful Parry, her cofferer, elevated to the post of Controller of the\r\nHousehold; whilst Lord Robert Dudley, the son of Northumberland, Cecil’s\r\nformer patron, was made Master of the Horse.\r\n\r\nThe Catholics, and especially the Spanish party, were in dismay. Changes\r\nmet them at every turn. The Councillors who had fattened on Philip’s\r\nbribes, turned against him openly, although some few, like Lord William\r\nHoward (the Lord Chamberlain), Clinton, and Paget, secretly offered\r\ntheir services for a renewed consideration. But it soon became evident\r\nthat the two men who would have the predominant influence were Cecil and\r\nParry, and they had never yet been bought by Spanish money. Only a week\r\nafter the Queen’s accession, Feria wrote to Philip:[87] “The kingdom is\r\nentirely in the hands of young folks, heretics and traitors, and the\r\nQueen does not favour a single man … who served her sister.… The old\r\npeople and the Catholics are dissatisfied, but dare not open their lips.\r\nShe seems to me incomparably more feared than her sister, and gives her\r\norders, and has her way, as absolutely as her father did. Her present\r\nController, Parry, and Secretary Cecil, govern the kingdom, and they tell\r\nme the Earl of Bedford has a good deal to say.”\r\n\r\nBefore entering London from Hatfield, the Queen stayed for a day or\r\ntwo at the Charterhouse, then in the occupation of Lord North. All\r\nLondon turned out to do her honour, and she immediately made it clear\r\nto onlookers that she meant to bid for popularity and to depend upon\r\nthe good-will of her subjects. On the 26th or 27th November the Spanish\r\nAmbassador went to the Charterhouse to salute her. He had been under Mary\r\npractically the master of the Council; but the new Queen promptly made\r\nhim understand that everything was changed. Instead of, as before, having\r\nright of access to the sovereign when he pleased, he found that in future\r\nhe and his affairs would be relegated to two members of the Council, and\r\nwhen he asked which two, the Queen replied, Parry and Cecil. Feria did\r\nhis best to conciliate her—gave her some jewels he had belonging to the\r\nlate Queen, and so forth; but when he mentioned that a suspension of\r\nhostilities had been arranged between the French and Spanish, she thought\r\nit was a trap to isolate her, and she dismissed the Ambassador coldly.\r\nWhen she had retired, Feria called Cecil and asked him to go in at once\r\nand explain matters to her, “as he is the man who does everything.” The\r\neffects of Cecil’s diplomacy were soon evident. The Queen smiled and\r\nchatted with Feria, took with avidity all the jewels he could give her,\r\ncoyly looked down when marriage was mentioned, but would pledge herself\r\nto nothing. “She was full of fine words, however, and told me that when\r\npeople said she was ‘French,’ I was not to believe it;”[88] but when the\r\nAmbassador treated such a notion as absurd, and endeavoured to lead her\r\non to say that her sympathies were with Spain and against France, she\r\ncleverly changed the subject. Her sister, she said, had been at war with\r\nFrance, but she was not.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, when the deputation of the Council arrived\r\nat Hatfield, Cecil was there before them, and had conveyed the news of\r\nher accession to the Queen. Naunton[89] says that when she heard it she\r\nfell on her knees and uttered the words, “_A Domino factum est illud, et\r\nest mirabile in oculis nostris_.” But whether this be true or not, it\r\nis certain that the intelligence did not come upon her as a surprise;\r\nfor Cecil had already drawn up for her guidance a document which still\r\nexists,[90] providing for the minutest details of her accession. Some of\r\nthese provisions were rendered unnecessary by the universal and peaceful\r\nacceptance of the new sovereign; but they exhibit the care and foresight\r\nwhich we always associate with the writer. The note runs as follows: 1.\r\nTo consider the proclamation and to proclaim it, and to send the same\r\nto all manner of places and sheriffs with speed, and to print it. 2. To\r\nprepare the Tower and to appoint the custody thereof to trusty persons,\r\nand to write to all the keepers of forts and castles in the Queen’s name.\r\n3. To consider for the removing to the Tower, and the Queen there to\r\nsettle her officers and Council. 4. To make a stay of passages to all the\r\nports until a certain day, and to consider the situation of all places\r\ndangerous towards France and Scotland, especially in this change. 5. To\r\nsend special messengers to the Pope, Emperor, Kings of Spain and Denmark,\r\nand the State of Venice. 6. To send new commissioners (commissions?) to\r\nthe Earl of Arundel and Bishop of Ely (the peace envoys), and to send one\r\ninto Ireland with a new commission; the letters under the Queen’s hand\r\nto all ambassadors with foreign princes to authorise them therein. 7. To\r\nappoint commissioners for the interment of the late Queen. 8. To appoint\r\ncommissioners for the coronation and the day. 9. To make continuance\r\nof the term with patents to the Chief-Justice, Justices of each Bench,\r\nBarons, and Masters of the Rolls, with inhibition. _Quod non conferant\r\naliquod officium._ 10. To appoint new sheriffs under the Great Seal.\r\n11. To inhibit by proclamation the making over of any money by exchange\r\nwithout knowledge of the Queen’s Majesty, and to charge all manner of\r\npersons that have made, or been privy to any exchange made, by the space\r\nof one month before the 17th of this month. 12. To consider the preacher\r\nof St. Paul’s Cross, that no occasion be given by him to stir any dispute\r\ntouching the governance of the realm.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that every necessary measure for carrying on peaceably\r\nthe government and business of the country is here provided for. Within\r\na week of the Queen’s accession the religious persecutions all over the\r\ncountry had ceased, and a few days later all persons who were in prison\r\nin London as offenders against religion had been released on their own\r\nrecognisances. The Queen had already foreshadowed her dislike to the\r\nharrying of Protestants by refusing her countenance to Bonner, the Bishop\r\nof London, when, with the other bishops, he met her on her approach to\r\nLondon. The English refugees were flocking back home from Germany and\r\nSwitzerland; and though, for the most part, the religious services were\r\ncontinued without marked change,[91] the Catholics saw that the day of\r\ntheir tribulation was coming, and were filled with indignation and fear.\r\nThe measures suggested by Cecil as to the appointment of the preacher\r\nat Paul’s Cross were doubtless adopted,[92] for there was no violent\r\necclesiastical pronouncement against the tendency of the new Government\r\nuntil the funeral of the late Queen, on the 13th December. White, Bishop\r\nof Winchester, preached the sermon, in which he attacked the Protestants\r\nin the most inflammatory language, quoting the words of Trajan: “If my\r\ncommands are just, use this sword for me; if unjust, use it against me.”\r\nIt was not Elizabeth’s or prudent Cecil’s line, however, to adopt extreme\r\nmeasures at first, and the prelate was only kept secluded for a month in\r\nhis own house. This is a fair specimen of the cautious policy adopted\r\nby Elizabeth. All of Mary’s Council had been Catholics, many of them\r\nbigoted Catholics, and yet eleven of them were admitted to the Council\r\nof the new Queen; the principal change being the addition to them of\r\nseven known Protestants, who had, like Cecil, conformed in the previous\r\nreign—namely, Parr (Marquis of Northampton), Cecil’s friend the Earl\r\nof Bedford, Sir Thomas Parry, Edward Rogers, Sir Ambrose Cave, Francis\r\nKnollys (the Queen’s cousin), and Sir William Cecil; Sir Nicholas Bacon,\r\nCecil’s brother-in-law, another Protestant conformer, being shortly\r\nafterwards also appointed a Councillor and Lord Keeper, but not yet\r\nChancellor, in the place of Heath, Archbishop of York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n1559-1560\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are told by his household biographer that two of Cecil’s favourite\r\naphorisms were: “That war is the curse, and peace the blessing of God\r\nupon a nation,” and “That a realm gaineth more by one year’s peace than\r\nby ten years’ war.” He and his mistress plainly saw that the first task\r\nfor them to perform was to put an end to the disastrous and inglorious\r\nwar into which for his own ends Philip had dragged England. Here, on the\r\nvery threshold of Elizabeth’s reign, Cecil’s influence upon her policy\r\nwas apparent and eminently successful. Cecil came from the Charterhouse\r\nto see Feria at Durham Place on the 24th November, saying that the Queen\r\nwas sending Lord Cobham to inform Philip in Flanders officially of Queen\r\nMary’s death; but two days afterwards, one of Feria’s spies at court,\r\nprobably Lord William Howard, sent him word that this was not Cobham’s\r\nonly mission. He was to turn aside to Cercamp, on the French frontier,\r\nwhere the peace commissioners were assembled, except Arundel, who had\r\nhurried back as soon as he learnt of the Queen’s death, in order to take\r\nfresh commissions from Elizabeth to Dr. Thirlby, Arundel, and Wotton.\r\nFeria, on this news, sent post-haste to Philip’s Secretary of State,\r\ntelling him to advise the Spanish “commissioners to keep their eyes on\r\nthese Englishmen, in case this should be some trick to our detriment,\r\nas I was told nothing about his going to Cercamp till he (Cobham) had\r\ngone.”[93]\r\n\r\nBut no trick was meant which should divide England from the House of\r\nBurgundy. The instructions carried by Cobham[94] were drafted by Cecil,\r\nand made the restitution of Calais the main point of the English demand;\r\nand Wotton was instructed to accompany Cobham to Philip, to persuade\r\nthe latter to support the English in their demand. The commissioners,\r\nmoreover, were instructed to insert in the treaty an article reserving\r\nall former treaties between England and the House of Burgundy. Before\r\nthese instructions reached the hands of the commissioners, the suspension\r\nof hostilities for two months, which had so much disquieted the Queen\r\nwhen Feria told her of it, had been arranged. There is no doubt that the\r\nwillingness of the French to agree to this suspension had been occasioned\r\nby their desire to enter into separate negotiations with the new Queen\r\nand her ministers, with the object of causing distrust between Spain and\r\nEngland; and here it was that Cecil had his first opportunity of proving\r\nhis ability. Lord Grey had been captured by the French at Guînes, and\r\nearly in January 1559 was allowed to return to England on parole, for\r\nthe purpose, ostensibly, of arranging an exchange. He brought with him\r\na message from the Dukes of Guise and Montpessart, proposing a secret\r\narrangement between England and France. This was not the first intimation\r\nof such a desire; for some weeks before, a similar but less authoritative\r\nmessage was brought by the Protestant Florentine, Guido Cavalcanti, from\r\nthe Vidame de Chartres; and Cavalcanti had gone back to France with kind\r\nbut vague expressions of good-will from Elizabeth. When Lord Grey’s\r\nmessage arrived, Cecil considered it in all its bearings, and drew up one\r\nof his judicial reports[95] in which Grey’s answer to Guise is dictated.\r\nWith much circumlocution the Queen’s willingness to make peace is\r\nexpressed, “if all things done in her sister’s time be revoked”; or, in\r\nother words, that Calais should be restored. But what Grey was not told\r\nwas Cecil’s recommendation to the Queen: “It seemeth necessary to allow\r\nthis overture of peace, so as neither so to lyke of it, nor so to follow\r\nit, as thereby any jelusy shall arise in the hart of the King of Spain,\r\nbut that principally that that amyty be preserved and this not refused.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time Dr. Wotton was to be instructed to go to Philip, and\r\nassure him emphatically, that the Queen was determined to remain friendly\r\nwith him, and to let the whole world see it. She had had some hints that\r\nthe French would like to approach her separately, but Philip “shal be\r\nmost assured that nothyng shal be doone that maye in any respect either\r\ndirectly or indirectly prejudice this amyté betwixt their two Majesties,\r\nor anything doone but that his Majesty shal be made privy thereto; and\r\nthereof his Majesty shal be as well assured as he was of his late wyffe’s\r\nproceedings here.” Guido Cavalcanti arrived in France before Lord Grey’s\r\nanswer to Guise, and the Florentine came posting back to England with an\r\naffectionate letter from the King of France to Elizabeth.[96] Cecil’s\r\ndraft answer to this is just as judicious as the previous one. The King\r\nof France suggested that French and English commissioners might be\r\nmutually appointed to meet. This would never do, said Cecil; secrecy was\r\nof the first importance, and a meeting of Englishmen and Frenchmen of\r\nrank would be noticed immediately. The negotiations had better be carried\r\non directly by correspondence, and this was the course accepted by the\r\nFrench. Whilst the matter was thus being drawn out, the disposition\r\nof Philip was being sounded. Later in the reign, Elizabeth and Cecil\r\nhad taken his measure, and could foresee his action, but in these first\r\nnegotiations they were groping their way. Elizabeth had practically\r\nrefused Philip’s own suggestion of marriage made by Feria, and was now\r\nfencing with the proposals of his cousins the Archdukes; but she was\r\ncareful not to drive Philip too far away. Reassuring letters came from\r\nWotton. Much, he said, as Philip wished for peace, he did not believe he\r\nwould make it alone, and leave both England and Scotland at the mercy of\r\nFrance, as “what woulde ensew thereof, a blynde manne can see.”[97]\r\n\r\nIt was well that Cecil’s caution disarmed Philip about the French\r\nadvances; for Cavalcanti’s movements and mission were soon conveyed to\r\nthe Spanish King by his spies, and when, at the expiration of the two\r\nmonths’ truce, the peace commissioners again met at Cateau-Cambresis,\r\nthe King did his best to support the English commissioners in their\r\ndemand for the restitution of Calais. His own agreement with France was\r\neasily made, for Henry II. was seriously alarmed now at the growth of\r\nthe reform party, and gave way to Philip on nearly every point; whilst\r\nPhilip himself was in great want of money, he hated war, and, above\r\nall, was burning to get back to the Spain he loved so much. But when,\r\nweek after week, he saw that the English commissioners stood firm about\r\nCalais, he was obliged to speak out and assure Elizabeth that he could\r\nnot plunge his country into war again for the purpose of restoring to\r\nEngland a fortress she had lost by her own laxity. At length, after\r\ninfinite discussion, the English were forced to conclude a peace based\r\nupon the restitution of Calais in eight years, the demolition of the\r\nfortifications of Eyemouth, and a truce, to be followed by a peace,\r\nbetween England and Scotland.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, before the peace of Cateau-Cambresis was signed,\r\nmatters were growing more acrimonious in tone between England and Spain,\r\nowing to the ecclesiastical measures to which reference will be made\r\npresently, and also to the haughtiness and want of tact displayed by\r\nFeria in England. When, therefore, news came hither that amongst the\r\nconditions of the general peace was one providing for the marriage of\r\nPhilip with Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of the French King, and the\r\nestablishment of a close community of interests between France and\r\nSpain, a gust of apprehension passed over the English that they had been\r\noutwitted, and would have to face a combination of the two great rivals.\r\n\r\nPaget—a thorough Spanish partisan and a Catholic—had foretold such a\r\npossibility as this in February, and had entreated Cecil to cling closely\r\nto Spain and continue the war with France.[98] But Cecil was wiser\r\nthan Paget. He knew that by fighting for Calais we should lose both\r\nfriendships, and he accepted the best terms of peace he could get. But\r\nwhen it was a question of the brotherhood between Spain and France, and\r\nwhispers came from French reformers of the secret international league to\r\ncrush Protestantism, then the only course to pursue was to disarm Philip\r\nand sow discord between Spain and France. When Feria saw the Queen on\r\nthe 7th April 1559, the day on which the news of the signing of peace\r\narrived in London, he found her pouting and coquettish that Philip should\r\nhave married any one but her. “Your Majesty, she said, could not have\r\nbeen so much in love with her as I had represented, if you could not\r\nwait four months for her.” But in the antechamber the Ambassador had\r\na conversation with Cecil, “who is a pestilent knave, as your Majesty\r\nknows. He told me they had heard that your Majesty was very shortly going\r\nto Spain, and, amongst other things, he said that if your Majesty wished\r\nto keep up the war with France, they for their part would be glad of it.\r\nI told him he could tell that to people who did not understand the state\r\nof affairs in England so well as I did. What they wanted was something\r\nvery different from that. They were blind to their own advantage, and\r\nwould now begin to understand that I had advised what was best for the\r\ninterests of the Queen and the welfare of the country; and I left them\r\nthat day as bitter as gall.”[99]\r\n\r\nPaget wailed that the country was ruined; Alba, Ruy Gomez, and young De\r\nGranvelle tried to impress upon the English peace commissioners that\r\nEngland’s only chance of salvation now lay in Philip’s countenance.[100]\r\nFeria tried to frighten the Queen by assuring her that her religious\r\npolicy was hurrying her and her country to perdition, and complained that\r\ncertain comedies insulting to Philip which had been acted at court, had\r\nbeen suggested by Cecil, her chief minister. But she outwitted him at\r\nevery point. “She was,” he said, “a daughter of the devil, and her chief\r\nministers the greatest scoundrels and heretics in the land.” She disarmed\r\nhim and his master by pretending that she would marry one of the Austrian\r\nArchdukes, who would depend entirely upon Spain; and Spanish agents were\r\nstill fain to be civil to her, in hope of bringing that about; though\r\nhot-headed Feria soon found his place intolerable, and relinquished it to\r\na more smooth-tongued successor. The reason why Feria was so especially\r\nbitter against Cecil, was that to him was attributed the principal blame\r\nfor forcing through Parliament, at the same time as the conclusion of\r\nthe treaty of peace, the Act of Supremacy, recognising the Queen as\r\nGovernor of the Anglican Church, and the Act of Uniformity, imposing the\r\nsecond prayer-book of Edward VI., but with some alterations of importance\r\nfor the purpose of conciliating the Catholics. The oath of supremacy,\r\nhowever, was only compulsory on servants of the Crown; and the general\r\ntendency of the Council, and especially of the Queen, was to avoid\r\noffending unnecessarily the Catholic majority in the country. The Queen\r\npersonally preferred a ceremonious worship, and several times assured\r\nthe Spanish Ambassador that her opinions were similar to those of her\r\nfather—that she was practically a Catholic, except for her acknowledgment\r\nof the papal supremacy.\r\n\r\nCecil’s interests at this period were somewhat different from those\r\nof the Queen. Her great object was to consolidate her position by\r\ngaining the good-will of as many of her subjects as possible, apart\r\nfrom the question of religion. It was necessary for her to pass the\r\nAct of Supremacy, in order to establish the legality of her right to\r\nreign, and some sort of uniformity was necessary in the interests of\r\npeace and good government; but beyond that she was not anxious to push\r\nreligious reform, for she disliked the Calvinists much more than she\r\ndid the Catholics. But Cecil saw that if the Protestant Church were not\r\nestablished legally and strongly before Elizabeth died—and of course she\r\nmight die at any time—the accession of Catholic Mary Stuart with French\r\npower at her back would mean the end of his ministry, and probably of\r\nhis life. He and Sir Nicholas Bacon, his brother-in-law, with Bedford,\r\nwere consequently regarded by the Spaniards as the principal promoters\r\nof religious changes. They tried hard to divert him, and in the list\r\nof Councillors who were to receive pensions from Spain he is down for\r\na thousand crowns;[101] but though he treated the Spaniards with great\r\ncourtesy and conciliation, they do not appear to have influenced his\r\npolicy by a hair’s-breadth. Parry, the Controller, now Treasurer of the\r\nHousehold, was a man of inferior talent, and was apparently jealous of\r\nCecil. Feria, despairing of moving Cecil, consequently endeavoured to\r\ninfluence the Queen by fear through Parry. On the 6th March, during the\r\npassage of the ecclesiastical bills through Parliament, the Ambassador,\r\nwith the Queen’s knowledge, arranged to meet Parry in St. James’s\r\nPark; but at the instance of Elizabeth, who did not desire the rest of\r\nher Council to see her confidential man in conference with Feria, the\r\nmeeting-place was changed to Hyde Park, “near the execution place.” The\r\nAmbassador urged upon Parry that the proposed religious measures would\r\ncertainly bring about the Queen’s downfall. Parry promised that the Queen\r\nwould not assume the title of Supreme Head of the Church, but would call\r\nherself Governor. But this was all Feria could get; for a week after,\r\nwhen he saw the Queen, he “found her resolved about what was passed in\r\nParliament yesterday, which Cecil and Vice-Chamberlain Knollys and their\r\nfollowers have managed to bring about for their own ends.” The Queen\r\nwas excited and hysterical. She was a heretic, she said, and could not\r\nmarry a Catholic like Philip. Feria endeavoured to calm and flatter her;\r\nbut he assured her that if she gave her consent to the bills she would\r\nbe utterly ruined. She promised him that she would not assume the title\r\nof Supreme Head; but she said that so much money was taken out of the\r\ncountry for the Pope that she must put an end to it, and the bishops were\r\nlazy poltroons, whereupon Feria retorted angrily, and Knollys purposely\r\nput an end to the conversation by announcing supper. Parry’s influence\r\nwas small and decreasing. “Although,” says Feria, “he is a favourite of\r\nthe Queen, he is not at all discreet, nor is he a good Catholic, but,\r\nstill, he behaves better than the others. Cecil is very clever, but a\r\nmischievous man, and a heretic, and governs the Queen in spite of the\r\nTreasurer (Parry);[102] for they are not at all good friends, and I have\r\ndone what I can to make them worse.”[103] Cecil, of course, had his way,\r\nand the Acts of Supremacy and Uniformity received the royal assent within\r\na few weeks of this time (April 1559).\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile both Cecil and the Queen worked hard to divert or\r\nmollify the irritation of the Spaniards caused by the religious measures.\r\nThe pretence of a desire on the part of the Queen to marry an Austrian\r\nArchduke was elaborately carried on. Envoys from the Emperor went\r\nbackwards and forwards. The sly, silky old Bishop of Aquila, the new\r\nSpanish Ambassador, tried to draw the Queen into a position from which\r\nshe could not recede. She was coy, interesting, unsophisticated, and\r\ncunning by turns, but never compromised herself too far. The object was\r\nsimply to keep the Spaniards from breaking away whilst pursuing her own\r\ncourse, and this object was effected.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of Cateau-Cambresis was ratified with great ceremony in London\r\nat the end of May: François de Montmorenci and a splendid French embassy\r\nwere entertained at Elizabeth’s court,[104] the Emperor’s envoy being\r\npresent at the same time to push the Archduke’s suit. It was Cecil’s cue\r\nto pretend to the Spaniards that the French were now very affectionate,\r\nand one day after some vicarious love-making with the Queen on behalf\r\nof the Archduke, the Bishop had a long conversation with the Secretary.\r\nThe latter hinted that a French match had been offered to the Queen, and\r\nasked his opinion of it. If it had not been for the dispensatory power\r\nof the Pope being necessary, the Queen, said Cecil, would have married\r\nPhilip; “but the proposal involved religious questions which it would be\r\nfruitless now to discuss, as the matter had fallen through.” The object\r\nof this, of course, was to attract the Spaniards, first by jealousy\r\nof the French, and next by a show of sympathy with Spain. For reasons\r\nalready set forth with regard to English succession, Philip was just as\r\nanxious as Cecil to avoid a quarrel. “I was glad,” writes the Bishop, “to\r\nhave the opportunity of talking over these matters with him, to dissipate\r\nthe suspicion which I think he and his friends entertain, that they have\r\nincurred your Majesty’s anger by their change of religion. I therefore\r\nanswered him without any reproach or complaint, and only said that what\r\nhad been done in the kingdom certainly seemed to me very grave, severe,\r\nand ill-timed, but that I hoped in God; and if He would some day give us\r\na council of bishops, or a good Pope, who would reform the customs of the\r\nclergy, and the abuses of the court of Rome, which had scandalised the\r\nprovinces, all the evil would be remedied; and God would not allow so\r\nnoble and Christian a nation as this to be separated in faith from the\r\nrest of Christendom.”[105] Thus the Catholic Bishop met the Protestant\r\nCecil more than half-way; and no more triumphant instance can be found\r\nthan this of the policy of the first few months of Elizabeth’s reign. The\r\nfaith of England had been revolutionised in six months without serious\r\ndiscontent in the country itself. Instead of hectoring Feria flouting\r\nand threatening, the bland Churchman sought to minimise differences of\r\nreligion to the “pestilent knave” who had been principally instrumental\r\nin making the great change. From master of England, Philip had changed\r\nto an equal anxious to avoid its enmity. The altered position had been\r\nbrought about partly by Philip’s dread of half-French Mary Stuart\r\nsucceeding to the English throne if Elizabeth should disappear, partly\r\nby the studious moderation of the English ecclesiastical measures, and\r\npartly by the care taken by Cecil and the Queen to keep alive the idea\r\nthat the French were courting their friendship, whilst they themselves\r\npreferred the old connection with the House of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nHow vital it was for England to conciliate Philip at this juncture was\r\nevident to those who, like Cecil, were behind the scenes, although the\r\nextreme Protestants in the country were somewhat restive about it. Before\r\nthe treaty of peace with France was negotiated, at the very beginning\r\nof the year 1559, Cecil drew up an important state paper for the\r\nconsideration of the Council, discussing the probability of an immediate\r\nFrench attack upon England over the Scottish border in the interests of\r\nMary Stuart. The religious disturbances in Scotland had necessitated the\r\nsending of a considerable French force to the aid of the Queen Regent,\r\nand Cecil says that a large army of French and German mercenaries was\r\nalready collected, which it was doubtful whether the English could\r\nresist. The questions he propounded to the Council were whether it would\r\nbe better to seize the Scottish ports at once before the French fleet\r\narrived, or to place England in a state of defence and await events. The\r\nlatter course was adopted, conjointly with endeavours to draw Philip\r\nto the side of England, and the sending of Sir Nicholas Throgmorton to\r\nFrance to remonstrate with the King.[106] The occasion given for this\r\nalarm is stated in Cecil’s diary as follows: “January 16th, 1559. The\r\nDolphin of France and his wife Queen of Scotts, did, by style of King and\r\nQueen of Scotland, England, and Ireland, graunt unto the Lord Fleming\r\ncertain things.”\r\n\r\nThrogmorton arrived in Paris on the 23rd May, and on the 7th June wrote\r\nto Cecil that the Guises and Mary Stuart were bribing and pensioning\r\nEnglishmen there, and that Cardinal Lorraine was busy intriguing for the\r\nsending of a force to Scotland, and for promoting his niece’s claim to\r\nthe English crown. He was “inquisitive to know of such Englishmen as he\r\nhath offered to interteigne, how many shippes the Queen’s Majesty hath\r\nin redeness, and whether the same be layed up in dock at Gillingham, and\r\nhow many of them be on the narrow seas, and whether the new great ships\r\nbe already made and furnished with takling and ordnance.”[107] On the\r\n21st of the same month the news was still more alarming. Throgmorton\r\ninformed Cecil that a suggestion had been made to him for a marriage\r\nbetween Queen Elizabeth and Guise’s brother, the Duke de Nemours, to\r\nwhich he had replied that he could not say anything about it unless the\r\nKing of France or his Council officially mentioned it. Throgmorton now\r\nheard that Constable Montmorenci had reproached Nemours for making such\r\na suggestion, “adding further these words, ‘What! do yow not know that\r\nthe Queen Dauphin hath right and title to England.’”[108] They only\r\nwaited for an opportunity, said Throgmorton, to say, “Have at you.”\r\nGreat preparations were being made in Paris for the celebration of the\r\npeace with Spain, and the betrothal of the King’s daughter to King\r\nPhilip by proxy, and watchful Throgmorton soon discovered that on all\r\nescutcheons, banners, and trophies in which the Dauphin’s and his wife’s\r\narms were represented, the arms of England were quartered, and almost\r\ndaily thereafter in his letters to Cecil the Ambassador sounds the alarm.\r\nCecil himself in his diary thus marks the progress of events, 28th June\r\n1559: “the justs at Paris, wherein the King-Dolphin’s two heralds were\r\napparelled with the arms of England.”[109] On the 29th June, at the\r\ngreat tournament to celebrate his child’s betrothal to Philip, Henry II.\r\nwas accidentally thrust in the eye by Montgomerie, and in a moment the\r\npolitical crisis became acute.\r\n\r\nMary Stuart was now Queen Consort of France. Her clever, ambitious\r\nuncles, Guise and the Cardinal, were practically rulers of France,\r\nand she herself, as Throgmorton says, “took everything upon her,” and\r\naccording to Cecil’s diary (16th July), “the ushers going before the\r\nQueen of Scotts (now French Queen) to Chappell cry, ‘Place pour la\r\nReine d’Angleterre.’” As soon as the pretensions of Mary were known,\r\nCecil’s counter move was to send help to the reform party in Scotland,\r\nand to revive the talk of a marriage between Elizabeth and the Earl of\r\nArran, the heir-apparent to the Scottish crown. Arran was in France;\r\nand on the first suspicion against him of intriguing with the English,\r\nthe King had ordered his capture, dead or alive. Randolph and Killigrew\r\nwere successively sent by Cecil to Throgmorton with orders to aid the\r\nEarl, and, at any risk, smuggle him to England.[110] In disguise he was\r\nconveyed by Randolph to Zurich, and thence to England, and subsequently\r\ninto Scotland,[111] to head the Protestant party against the French,\r\nfrom his father’s castles of Hamilton and Dumbarton. Whilst Arran was\r\nin hiding in England, Cecil was apparently the only minister who saw\r\nhim, and when he left, it was with full instructions and pecuniary help\r\nfrom the Secretary. Cecil was a man of peace; but the main point of his\r\npolicy was the keeping of the French out of Flanders and Scotland. Now\r\nthat Guise ambition openly struck at England through the northern kingdom\r\nactive measures were needed, and they were taken.\r\n\r\nAs usual, Cecil’s report on the whole question[112] to the Queen\r\njudiciously summed up all the possibilities. The document sets forth\r\nthe desirability of an enduring peace between Scotland and England,\r\nand the impossibility of it whilst the former country is governed by a\r\nforeign nation like the French in the absence of its native sovereign;\r\nthat the land should be “freed from idolatry like as England”; and that\r\nthe nobility should be banded together with the next heir to the crown\r\n(Arran) to remedy all abuses. “If the Queen (Mary) shall be unwilling to\r\nthis, as is likely, … then it is apparent that Almighty God is pleased\r\nto transfer from her the rule of the kingdom for the weale of it. And\r\nin this time great circumspection is to be used to avoid the deceits\r\nand trumperies of the French.” Sir William’s decision, after infinite\r\ndiscussion, is that the cheapest and only possible way will be at once\r\nto send strong reinforcements to the Scottish reformers, and at the same\r\ntime that Sadler and Crofts on the Border should be sleepless, as they\r\nwere, in their efforts in favour of the Protestant Scots.\r\n\r\nThere was no matter which concerned Cecil so much as this, as will be\r\nseen by his many interesting letters about it to Sir Ralph Sadler in the\r\nSadler Papers. He had gone to Burghley in September 1559, and thence\r\nwrote to Sadler his anxiety to hear of Arran’s[113] safe arrival in\r\nScotland. “Th’erle of Arrayn borrowed of me at his being at London 200\r\ncrowns, which he promised should be paid to you, Mr. Sadler, for me.\r\nAfter some tyme passed, I praye you aske it of hym.” The next day Cecil\r\nwrote that he had ordered Sadler “to lende the Protestants money, as of\r\nyour selve, taking secretly the bonds of them to rendre the same; so as\r\nthe Quene should not be partie thereto.” Thenceforward money was secretly\r\nsent in plenty by Sir William to maintain the Scottish reformers who were\r\nbesieging Leith, but Knox and the rigid Calvinists, with their republican\r\nand anti-feminine ideas, were hated by the Queen, and made matters\r\ndifficult. “Knox’s name,” says Cecil, “is the most odious here. I wish no\r\nmention of it hither.” “Surely I like not Knox’s audacitie.… His writings\r\ndo no good here, and therefore I do rather suppress them.”[114]\r\n\r\nBut it became evident that the Lords of the Congregation would be unable\r\nmuch longer to hold their own without powerful armed assistance from\r\nEngland. This would of course mean a renewal of the war with France, and\r\nbefore it could be undertaken it was necessary to make quite sure of the\r\nattitude of Philip, who was about to marry the French Princess. On this\r\noccasion, for the first time, Cecil was met and hampered in his action by\r\na counter intrigue within the English court, such as for the next twenty\r\nyears continually faced him.\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen rode through the city from the Charterhouse to the Tower\r\non her white jennet, she was followed closely by a handsome young man\r\nof her own age, who attracted general attention. She had appointed Lord\r\nRobert Dudley, the son of Cecil’s old patron, Northumberland, Master\r\nof the Horse at Hatfield on the day that Mary died. In less than six\r\nmonths the tongue of scandal was busy with the doings of the Queen and\r\nher favourite, and the Spanish agents were calculating the chances of\r\nhis being made an instrument for their ends. Gradually the English\r\ncompetitors for the Queen’s hand sank into the background, whilst\r\nDudley, a married man, grew in favour daily.[115] He was made a Knight\r\nof the Garter, to the openly expressed annoyance of other older and\r\nworthier nobles; money grants and favours of all sorts were showered\r\nupon him, and the Queen would hardly let him out of her sight. So long\r\nas the talk of the match with the Archduke Charles only dragged on its\r\ninterminable length, Dudley was mildly approving and claiming rewards\r\nand bribes from the Spaniards in consequence; for he knew perfectly\r\nwell that the negotiation was a feint, and that the religious obstacles\r\nwere unsurmountable. But when, as has been seen, national interests led\r\nCecil to play his master-move and checkmate Mary Stuart and the French\r\nconnection in Scotland with Arran and the English marriage, Dudley saw\r\nthat the affair was serious, and at once set about frustrating Cecil’s\r\nnational policy for his personal advantage. In order to obstruct the\r\nmarriage with Arran, the first step was for Dudley to profess himself\r\nhotly in favour of the Austrian match.\r\n\r\nHis sister, Lady Sidney, was sent to the Bishop of Aquila, with the\r\nassurance that the Queen would consent to marry the Archduke at once if\r\nshe were asked (September 1559). Dudley and Parry both came and assured\r\nthe Bishop of their devotion, body and soul, to Spanish interests.[116]\r\nThere was, they said, a plot to kill the Queen, and she had now made up\r\nher mind to concede the religious points at issue and marry the Archduke\r\nat once. The Queen herself avoided going so far as that in words, but\r\nby looks and hints she confirmed what Lady Sidney and Dudley had said.\r\nBetween them they hoodwinked the Churchman, and he urged upon Philip\r\nand the Emperor the coming of the bridegroom. After his long talk at\r\nWhitehall with the Queen at the end of September, the Bishop saw Cecil,\r\nwho by this time was fully aware of what was going on, and adroitly\r\nturned it to the advantage of his policy. War with the French in Scotland\r\nwas practically adopted, if Philip could be depended upon to stand aloof.\r\nWhen, accordingly, the Bishop approached Cecil, the latter, although he\r\navoided pledging himself to the Queen’s marrying the Archduke, spoke\r\nsympathetically about it. But his tone was different from Dudley’s. “I\r\nsaw,” says the Bishop, “that he was beating about the bush, and begged\r\nthat we might speak plainly to one another. I was not blind or deaf,\r\nand could easily perceive that the Queen was not taking this step to\r\nrefuse her consent after all. He swore he did not know, and could not\r\nassure me.” But then Cecil shot _his_ bolt. The French, he said, were\r\nstriving to impede the Archduke’s match, and had offered great things to\r\nthe Swedes if they could bring about the marriage of Elizabeth with the\r\nPrince of Sweden. “They (the English) well understood that this was only\r\nto alienate the Queen from her connection and friendship with Philip,\r\nand thus to enable the French to invade this country more easily.”[117]\r\nCecil then consented, but vaguely, to help forward “our affair,” and was\r\npromised all Philip’s favour if he did so. All Cecil asked for and wanted\r\nwas an assurance of the help or neutrality of Spain, in the event of a\r\nFrench invasion, and this he unhesitatingly got—“if the Queen will marry\r\nthe Archduke,” a condition which Cecil, at least, must have known would\r\nnot be fulfilled.\r\n\r\nFor the next week or two the Queen surpassed herself in vivacity, in\r\npretended anticipation of the coming of her Imperial lover. She became\r\noutwardly more Catholic than ever. Candles and crucifixes were again\r\nput up on the altars of her chapels, priests wore their vestments, and\r\nthe Spanish Bishop was in the best of spirits. All this was going too\r\nfar for Cecil, and was forcing his hand. He wanted to ensure Philip’s\r\ncountenance by arousing jealousy of the French, whilst keeping the\r\nArchduke’s marriage gently simmering. But if Dudley and the Queen carried\r\nit too far, it would either end in mortally offending Philip, or in\r\nintroducing a strong Catholic influence in England, which would have\r\nbeen the end of Cecil as a minister. Feria, in Flanders, saw this clearly\r\nenough, and wrote to the Bishop to tell Dudley that Cecil would really be\r\nagainst the Archduke’s business.[118] Dudley’s intrigue to prevent the\r\nScottish match, not only hampered Cecil, but set the whole court by the\r\nears. The Duke of Norfolk and the thorough-going Spanish Catholic party\r\nformed a plot to kill Dudley, as they knew he was not sincere, and would\r\nprevent the marriage with the Archduke, perhaps, at the last moment;\r\nwhilst Cecil’s own Protestant friends, Bedford especially, who did not\r\nunderstand his cautious manner of dealing with difficulties, quarrelled\r\nwith him about his apparent acquiescence in fresh Popish innovations.\r\n\r\nDudley’s bubble soon burst of itself. The Emperor, not under the sway of\r\nElizabeth’s charm, was cool. The Bishop, as a feeler, fostered the idea\r\nthat the Archduke was already on the way, and then the Queen, Dudley, and\r\nLady Sidney took fright and began to cry off; and the Bishop saw he had\r\nbeen deceived (November 1559). But Arran’s suit had still to be combated,\r\nand Dudley warmly took up the Swedish match; whilst the gossips whispered\r\nthat he had decided to poison his wife, and marry the Queen himself.\r\nMatters had reached this stage, when the Bishop’s agents began plotting\r\nwith the Duke of Norfolk for the open coming of the Archduke, his\r\nmarriage with Catharine Grey, and the murder of Elizabeth and Dudley; but\r\nthis required bolder hands than Norfolk or Philip, and nothing came of\r\nit but open quarrels between Dudley and those who he knew were planning\r\nhis ruin. Gradually prudent Cecil worked the Archduke’s negotiations\r\nback again into the stage in which they had been when Dudley interfered.\r\nThe Bishop was courted, an envoy was sent to Vienna, care was taken to\r\nkeep alive Philip’s jealousy of the French—more than ever to be feared\r\nby the Spanish King, now that his own Netherlands were seething with\r\ndisaffection; and then, at last, Cecil was able to accede to the prayer\r\nof the Scottish reformers,[119] and send an English force to their aid.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd December 1559, Cecil could write to Sadler, saying that the\r\nDuke of Norfolk and Lord Grey were on their way north to take command of\r\nthe army. “Our shippes be on the sea, God spede them! William Winter is\r\nappointed, as he commeth nigh, to learn of you the state of the French\r\nnavy within the Firth. And it is thought good that ye should cause some\r\nsmall vessell to goo to hym with your intelligence before he come very\r\nnigh that towne, lest by tarryeng for your answer his voyage be hindered.\r\nThe French are much amased at this our sodden going to sea, so as the\r\nMarq d’Elbœuf being come to Callise is retorned to Parriss in great hast.\r\nWe lack intelligence from you and be ignorant of what ye do in Scotland.\r\nWe be afrayd of the loss of Edinburgh Castle. God gyve ye both good\r\nnight, for I am almost a slepe. At Westminster, hora 12ᵃ nocte 23 Dec.\r\n1559.”[120]\r\n\r\nThe fleet of thirty-two sail, with 8000 infantry and 2000 cavalry, sailed\r\nup the Forth exactly a month after this letter was written, to the dismay\r\nof the French and the Queen Regent, who shortly afterwards learnt that\r\nElbœuf and his army had been storm-beaten back to France. The French\r\nand Catholic Scots were now cooped up in Leith, with no possibility of\r\nreceiving aid from France; whilst the English on the Border, and the\r\nLords of the Congregation, were organising a strong land force to invade\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing more to be dreaded by Philip—as Cecil well knew—than a\r\nwar between England and France for the cause of the Scottish Protestants.\r\nThe Spanish alliance with France had aroused the distrust of the powerful\r\nreform party in the latter country; and on the accession of Francis II.\r\nand the Guises to power, the Queen-mother, Catharine de Medici, whose\r\nchance had at last come after years of insult and neglect, at once\r\nthrew her influence into the scale of their opponents, the Montmorencis\r\nand the reformers. Throgmorton had been sent to France to form a union\r\nbetween the Protestant and anti-Guisan elements in France and Elizabeth,\r\nand in this he had been entirely successful, to the unfeigned dismay\r\nof Philip and his agents.[121] This combination of Protestants in\r\nEngland, Scotland, and France, and probably also in Germany, was a most\r\nthreatening one for Philip’s objects, especially in view of the condition\r\nof his own Netherlands; and yet his hands were tied. He dared not raise\r\na hand to make French Mary Stuart Queen of Great Britain, although\r\nthe triumph of reform in Scotland and this combination of Protestants\r\nstruck at the very root of his objects and his policy. To the cautious\r\nplanning of Cecil almost exclusively was owing the fact that in one year\r\nPhilip had been disarmed, and rendered impotent to injure a Protestant\r\nEngland. The Spanish Bishop’s only remedy for it all was to plot with\r\nthe extreme English Catholics to kill Elizabeth, Dudley, and Cecil, and\r\nplace Catharine Grey or Darnley on the throne under Spanish tutelage;\r\nand he conspired ceaselessly with that object. But his master knew\r\nbetter than he. The French, he was aware, would fight to prevent such a\r\nresult, as well as the English, and neither he nor his coffers were in a\r\nmood for fighting them then; so he had to stoop to peaceful diplomacy,\r\nand tried to beat Cecil at his own game. The Secretary had continued to\r\nanswer firmly all the Bishop’s remonstrances and veiled threats, for he\r\nknew Philip could not move; and when it was decided to send a special\r\nFlemish envoy to England to dissuade the Queen from aiding the Scottish\r\nProtestants, the Bishop almost scornfully told Feria that, if talking had\r\nbeen of any good, he would have done it already. “They would do more harm\r\nthan good if they were only coming to talk, for the English Catholics\r\nexpect much more than that.” “Cecil,” he says, “is the heart of the\r\nbusiness, and is determined to carry it through, until they are ruined,\r\nas they will be.”[122] In the meanwhile (April 1560) the siege of Leith\r\nwent on, notwithstanding the attempts of the French to settle terms of\r\npeace in London. Elizabeth would have nothing to do with any peace that\r\nleft a French man-at-arms in Scotland.\r\n\r\nPhilip’s Flemish envoy, De Glajon, arrived in London on the 5th April\r\n1560, and was very coolly received by Elizabeth.[123] In Philip’s name\r\nhe exhorted her to abstain from helping the Scottish rebels, and then\r\nthreatened that if she did not come to terms with the French, Spanish\r\ntroops would be sent to reinforce the latter. She was dignified, but\r\nalarmed at this, and sent Cecil on the following day to discuss the\r\nquestion with De Glajon.[124] After a conference, lasting five hours,\r\nin which Cecil recited all the English complaints against France, and\r\npointed out the danger to Philip that would ensue upon the French\r\nbecoming masters of Scotland, he positively assured the envoy that the\r\nEnglish troops would not be withdrawn from Scotland until their objects\r\nwere attained. The French Ambassador tried hard to draw Philip’s envoy\r\ninto a joint hostile protest[125] to Elizabeth; but the Spaniards\r\nknew that their master really did not mean to fight, and declined to\r\ncompromise him. They, indeed, assured Cecil privately, that if Philip\r\nhelped the French, it would only be in the interests of Elizabeth herself.\r\n\r\nThrough all the negotiation Cecil’s management was most masterly. He had\r\ntaken Philip’s measure now, and knew the powerless position in which\r\nEnglish diplomacy, aided by circumstances, had placed him. The Guises\r\nhad taken his measure too. As week followed week, and hope of help from\r\nhim disappeared, they saw that they must make such terms as they might\r\nwith Elizabeth. The French in Leith were heroically holding out, though\r\nstarving and hopeless; no reinforcements could be sent from France, for\r\nEngland held the sea, and the Queen-mother and the reform party would\r\ngive no help to purely Guisan objects. So at last, in May, Monluc, the\r\nBishop of Valence, came humbly to London and sued Elizabeth for peace,\r\nand Cecil and Wotton, with Sir Henry Percy, Sir Ralph Sadler, and Peter\r\nCarew, travelled to Scotland to meet the French commissioners and settle\r\nthe terms. Cecil started on the 30th May, and at the different stages of\r\nhis journey he wrote letters to Sir William Petre.[126] On the 31st he\r\nwrites from Royston: “in no apparent doubt of health, yet by foulness of\r\nweather afraid to ride to Huntingdon till to-morrow.” On the 2nd June his\r\nletter comes from his own house at Burghley, “rubbing on between health\r\nand sickness, yet my heart serveth me to get the mastery.”\r\n\r\nHis energy, his command of detail, and his foresight are remarkably shown\r\nin these letters. He spurs Petre to do as evidently he himself would\r\nhave done—to expedite everything necessary for the prosecution of the\r\nwar, though peace was in prospect; “to quicken the Lord Treasurer for\r\nmoney,” and so forth. From Stamford he went to Doncaster, Boroughbridge,\r\nNorthallerton, Newcastle, and so to Scotland, always vigilant, observant,\r\nsuggestive; but in nearly every letter expressing deep distrust of the\r\nFrench, whom he suspected of treachery at every point. When they met\r\nin Edinburgh his complaints are constant of their “cavilations” and\r\nhairsplitting. “They may contend, however, about a word,” he says, “but I\r\nmean to have the victory.” Before the negotiations commenced, the Queen\r\nRegent, Mary of Lorraine, died (11th June), and this, by perplexing the\r\nFrench, somewhat facilitated an arrangement. The most difficult point was\r\nthe use of the English arms by Mary Stuart, and, on the 1st July, Cecil\r\nwrote to the Queen that the negotiations had been broken off on that\r\npoint alone. After this was written, but before it was despatched, Cecil\r\nproposed a “device,”[127] by the insertion of a “few fair words”; and\r\nan arrangement was the result, which stands a triumphant vindication of\r\nCecil’s policy.\r\n\r\nThe French troops were all to be withdrawn, Leith and Dunbar to be\r\nrazed, Mary abandoned her claim to the English crown, and acknowledged\r\nElizabeth; and, above all, Mary granted a constitution to her subjects,\r\nwhich well-nigh annihilated the prerogative of her throne. A Parliament\r\nwas to be forthwith summoned, which should have the power to declare or\r\nveto war or peace; during the sovereign’s absence the country was to be\r\ngoverned by a council of twelve persons to be chosen out of twenty-four\r\nelected by Parliament, seven of the twelve being chosen by the Queen,\r\nand five by Parliament; no foreigner was to hold any place of trust, nor\r\nwas an ecclesiastic to control the revenues; a complete indemnity was\r\ngiven for all past acts, civil and ecclesiastical, and the question of\r\nreligious toleration was to be finally decided by Parliament.\r\n\r\nThus the Scottish-French question, which had been a standing menace to\r\nEngland for centuries, was settled by the statesmanship of Cecil; and\r\nperhaps through the whole of his great career no achievement shows more\r\nclearly than this the consummate tact, patience, firmness, moderation,\r\nand foresight that characterised his policy. Less than two years before\r\nEngland under the patronage of Philip was forced to accept a humiliating\r\npeace from France, and Spanish and French agents had intrigued against\r\neach other as to which of their two sovereigns should use prostrate,\r\nexhausted England for his own objects. In two short years of dexterous\r\nstatesmanship England had turned the tables. Not only had she with\r\ncomparative ease effected a vast domestic revolution, but she was\r\nconscious of the fact that both of the great Continental rivals were\r\nimpotent to injure her, out of jealousy of each other, whilst her own\r\npower for offence and defence had enormously increased, and the knitting\r\ntogether of the reformers throughout Europe had placed her at the head of\r\na confederacy which she could use as a balance against her enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n1560-1561\r\n\r\n\r\nThe results achieved in so short a time after Elizabeth’s accession\r\nwere due in a large measure to the moderation and prudence of Cecil’s\r\nmethods. The changes which had been made attacked many interests, and\r\nran counter to many prejudices; and the policy of Elizabeth in retaining\r\nmost of her sister’s Councillors had surrounded her with men who still\r\nclung to the old faith and the traditions of the past. From the first\r\nthe Spanish and French Ambassadors had begun to bribe the Councillors,\r\nand had respectively formed their parties amongst those who immediately\r\nsurrounded the Queen. Elizabeth herself was fickle and unstable, yet\r\nobstinate in the opinion of the moment. Her vanity often led her into\r\nfalse and dangerous positions, and already scandal was busy with her\r\ndoings. She was easily swayed by the opinions of others, yet fiercely\r\nresented any attempt at dictation. Her feelings, moreover, towards the\r\nFrench were by no means so antagonistic as those of Cecil, and the cost\r\nof the war in Scotland had caused her great annoyance. It will be seen,\r\ntherefore, that the task of her principal minister in carrying out with\r\nsafety a consistent national policy was an extremely difficult one. More\r\nthan once during the Scotch war the French-Guisan party in Elizabeth’s\r\ncourt had, to Cecil’s dismay, nearly persuaded the Queen to suspend\r\nhostilities, whilst Philip’s paid agents in her Council were for ever\r\nwhispering distrust of Cecil and his religious reforms. Whilst the\r\nHowards, Arundel, Paget, Mason, and the rest of the Philipians—as the\r\npuritan Lord John Grey called them—were denouncing the minister for his\r\nProtestant measures, the hot zealots who had hurried back from Germany\r\nand Switzerland, dreaming of the violent establishment of an Anglican\r\nChurch on the Genevan pattern, were discontented at the slowness and\r\ntentative character of the religious reforms adopted; and Cecil’s own\r\nfriends, like the Earl of Bedford, the Duchess of Suffolk, and the Lord\r\nAdmiral Clinton, were often impatient at his moderation. To this must\r\nbe added the unprincipled influence of Dudley, who was ready to swear\r\nallegiance to any cause, to serve his purpose of dominating the Queen, a\r\npurpose which was naturally opposed by Cecil as being dangerous to the\r\nnational welfare. It will thus be seen that the patient, strong minister\r\nwas surrounded by difficulties on every side; and but for the fact that\r\nnone of his rivals were comparable with him in ability and energy, Cecil\r\nmust have shared the usual fate of ministers, and have fallen before the\r\nattacks of his enemies.\r\n\r\nHe returned from Scotland at the end of July, after an absence\r\nof sixty-three days[128] and from a letter of the Lord Treasurer\r\n(Winchester) to him soon afterwards (24th August 1560), it is evident\r\nthat his detractors had been at work in his absence.[129] The old Marquis\r\nloved to stand well with all men, but his tendencies we know now to have\r\nbeen “Philipian,” and he wrote to the Secretary: “In the meantime all\r\ngood Councillors shall have labor and dolor without reward; wherein your\r\npart is most of all mens; for your charge and paynes be farre above all\r\noder mens, and your thanks and rewards least and worst considered, and\r\nspecially for that you spend wholly of yourself, without your ordinary\r\nfee, land, patent, gift, or ony thing, which must nedes discomfort you.\r\nAnd yett when your counsell is most for her Majesties honour and profitt,\r\nthe same hath got hinderance by her weke creditt of you, and by back\r\ncouncells; and so long as that matter shall continue it must needs be\r\ndangerous service and unthankful.”\r\n\r\nLess than three weeks after this letter was written, the Bishop of Aquila\r\nwent to Greenwich about the Austrian match, which still dragged on, when,\r\nto his surprise, the Queen told him flatly she had altered her mind,\r\nand would not marry at all. The Bishop then sought out Cecil, who, he\r\nknew, was now in semi-disgrace, owing to the efforts of Dudley in his\r\nabsence. The Secretary was not in the habit of wearing his heart upon his\r\nsleeve, and if he did so on this occasion to Philip’s minister, it may be\r\nconcluded that it was from motives of policy, which are not very far to\r\nseek. “After exacting many pledges of strict secrecy, he said that the\r\nQueen was conducting herself in such a way that he thought of retiring.\r\nHe said it was a bad sailor who did not enter port if he could when he\r\nsaw a storm coming on, and he clearly foresaw the ruin of the realm\r\nthrough Robert’s intimacy with the Queen, who surrendered all affairs to\r\nhim and meant to marry him. He said he did not know how the country put\r\nup with it, and he should ask leave to go home, though he thought they\r\nwould cast him into the Tower first. He ended by begging me in God’s\r\nname to point out to the Queen the effect of her misconduct, and persuade\r\nher not to abandon business entirely, but to look to her realm; and then\r\nhe repeated to me twice over that Lord Robert would be better in Paradise\r\nthan here.”[130] After this Cecil told the Ambassador that Dudley “was\r\nthinking of killing his wife,” which on the following day the Queen\r\npartly confirmed by mentioning to the Bishop that she was “dead or nearly\r\nso.” The Bishop’s comment upon this is, that “Cecil’s disgrace must have\r\ngreat effect, as he has many companions in discontent, especially the\r\nDuke of Norfolk.… Their quarrels cannot injure public business, as nobody\r\nworse than Cecil can be at the head of affairs, but the outcome of it all\r\nmight be the imprisonment of the Queen, and the proclamation of the Earl\r\nof Huntingdon[131] as King. He is a great heretic, and the French forces\r\nmight be used for him. Cecil says he is the real heir of England, and all\r\nthe heretics want him. I do not like Cecil’s great friendship with the\r\nBishop of Valence.”\r\n\r\nShortly after this was written, the tragic fate of Amy Robsart was\r\nannounced. For months past there had been rumours of the intention of\r\nDudley to have his wife killed, in order that he might marry the Queen,\r\nand as the date of Cecil’s conversation with the Bishop is not quite\r\ncertain, it is possible that he may have spoken with the knowledge that\r\nshe was already dead. In any case, however, it is certain that, at this\r\ntime, Cecil feared that the Queen’s passion for Dudley would bring about\r\nthe downfall of the edifice he had so laboriously built, and he sought if\r\npossible to lay the foundation for his future action. The friendship with\r\nthe Guisan Bishop, Monluc, was clearly a feint, as was also the idea that\r\nthe French would help Huntingdon to the detriment of their own Queen Mary\r\nStuart, but it would serve to arouse the jealousy of the Spaniards, and\r\nwould incline them to Cecil’s side to prevent it. Dudley had in Cecil’s\r\nabsence gained most of the advanced Protestant party to his side by his\r\nopen championship of their ideas, and the Secretary, finding himself\r\ndistrusted by his friends, was obliged to endeavour to discredit Dudley,\r\nto gain the sympathy of the Spanish Bishop, and, through him, of the\r\n“Philipians,” who were already opposed to Dudley as an upstart and a\r\nfriend of France. Regarded in this light, Cecil’s unwonted frankness to\r\nthe Spanish Ambassador is intelligible enough. If things went well with\r\nthe Queen, the “Philipians” could keep him in office, and if disaster\r\nbefell her, he dissociated himself from her before the catastrophe, and\r\nmade common cause with the party which in such case would certainly be\r\nuppermost.\r\n\r\nThe danger, however, soon blew over, for Amy Robsart’s death caused so\r\nmuch scandal as to cover Dudley with obloquy, and render him powerless\r\nfor a time, during which Cecil regained his influence. How completely\r\nhe did so is seen in Dudley’s enigmatical letter to him at the time\r\nwhen he was first feeling the effect of the odium of his wife’s death.\r\nThe real meaning of the letter is not intelligible. Dudley had retired\r\nfrom court, probably to Wanstead, and had been visited by Cecil, who was\r\nhaving close inquiry made into the death of Lady Robert. He appears to\r\nhave made some friendly promise to Dudley, who is effusively grateful.\r\n“The great frendshipp you have shewyd towards me I shall not forgett. I\r\npray you lett me hear from you what you think best for me to doe; if you\r\ndoubt, I pray you ask the question (of the Queen?), for the sooner you\r\ncan advyse me the more I shall thank you. I am sorry so sodden a chaunce\r\nshuld brede me so great a change, for methinks I am here all this while\r\nas it were in a dream.”[132] Dudley’s retirement and pretended disgrace,\r\nto save appearances, did not last long; and when he came back to court he\r\nfound Cecil in full favour again.[133] Whilst Lord Robert was away Cecil\r\nhad extracted a positive assurance from the Queen direct, that she would\r\nnot marry Dudley. Cecil had thereupon made another attempt to revive\r\nthe Archduke’s negotiation,[134] and at the same time had sounded the\r\nSpanish Ambassador about marrying Catharine Grey to a nominee of Philip;\r\nthis being a prudent attempt to obtain a second connecting link with\r\nSpain, now that the negotiations with the Archduke had been worn nearly\r\nthreadbare.\r\n\r\nBut the Spanish-Austrian family were not responsive. They had been fooled\r\nmore than once, and were determined that Elizabeth should not lead them\r\ninto a position compromising to their dignity; but it was necessary for\r\nthose who had the welfare of England at heart to take some steps which\r\nshould render Dudley’s hopes unrealisable. The Protestant party in the\r\nCouncil, with Cecil’s acquiescence, again brought up the proposal of\r\nthe new King of Sweden, Eric XIV. He was an eager suitor, and had been\r\ntrying to gain a hearing at intervals since before Mary’s death; and in\r\nanswer to private messages from England, intimated his intention of\r\ncoming himself to win his bride. The Protestants were overjoyed; for\r\nthis would have been an ideal solution for them, especially now that the\r\nsituation had been unexpectedly changed by the death of the young King\r\nof France, Mary Stuart’s husband (5th December 1560). This event, which\r\ntook away much of the Guises’ power, and weakened Mary’s connection with\r\nFrance, now governed by her mother-in-law, Catharine de Medici, who hated\r\nher, banished in a large measure Philip’s dread of her accession to the\r\nEnglish throne; and the Catholics in England thought they saw daylight\r\nahead, if the Queen died childless.\r\n\r\nIt was natural, therefore, that the Protestants should make a counter\r\nmove, and actively revive the idea of the Swedish match. It was equally\r\nto be expected that when Dudley thus found himself without any party at\r\nall but his personal friends, he should seek support in a fresh quarter.\r\nHe was without shame, scruple, or conscience. He had betrayed, or was\r\nready to betray, every person or cause that trusted him; his sole object\r\nwas to force or cajole the Queen into marrying him, and he grasped at any\r\naid towards it. In January 1561 his brother-in-law, Sir Henry Sidney,\r\na Catholic, and a friend of Spain, came to the Bishop of Aquila, and\r\nassured him that Dudley was innocent of his wife’s death, though public\r\nopinion was universally against him. Sidney then went on to say that, as\r\nElizabeth’s desire to marry Dudley was evident, it was surprising that\r\nthe Spanish party had not helped him in his object, and thus gained his\r\ngratitude, in return for which “he would hereafter serve and obey your\r\nMajesty like one of your own vassals.” The Bishop was not eager, for\r\nhe had been tricked before when the Sidneys were the intermediaries;\r\nbut when Sidney promised that if Dudley were aided to marry the Queen,\r\nhe would restore the Catholic religion in England, the Churchman\r\nlistened. He could be no party, of course, he said, to a bargain about\r\nreligion; but if Dudley really wished to repent in this way, he should be\r\ndelighted. The Queen acquiesced in the intrigue, and eagerly listened to\r\nthe Spaniard’s advocacy of Dudley’s suit, though doubtless she did not\r\nknow that her English suitor had promised, in the event of his marriage,\r\nto hand over the whole government to the King of Spain, and fully restore\r\nthe Catholic faith.[135]\r\n\r\nAs some earnest of the Queen’s and Dudley’s chastened hearts, the Bishop\r\nhad urged that English plenipotentiaries should be sent to the Council\r\nof Trent, and the English bishops released who were imprisoned for\r\nrefusing the oath of supremacy. Dudley was willing to promise that or\r\nanything else; but in so important a matter of State as the recognition\r\nof the Pope’s Council, the co-operation of Cecil was needed. He was, of\r\ncourse, opposed to Dudley’s suit, but had not interfered openly to stop\r\nthese negotiations, the Bishop says, in consequence of his having been\r\nbribed by the grant of some emoluments enjoyed by Parry, who had recently\r\ndied, but more probably because he may really have been at the bottom\r\nof these negotiations, and he knew that he could checkmate Dudley more\r\neffectually, if necessary, at a later stage.[136] As we have seen, his\r\nopposition to strong forces was rarely direct. He knew in this case that\r\nthe Queen would resent open thwarting from him; and that it would also\r\nhave the effect of offending the Catholics, and renewing the quarrel with\r\nDudley and his friends. So when he was consulted, he feigned to welcome\r\nthe project of sending English representatives to the Council of Trent,\r\nand at once proceeded to kill it with kindness.\r\n\r\nThe situation in England was an extremely critical one. Much public\r\ndissatisfaction existed at the Queen’s questionable behaviour, and the\r\nCatholics, especially, were greatly disturbed in consequence of the\r\nattitude of Mary Stuart. The treaty of Edinburgh, the result of so much\r\nthought and labour, had not been ratified by Mary and her husband when\r\nthe latter died; and in answer to requests on the part of the English\r\nGovernment, through Throgmorton and Sir Peter Mewtys, that she would\r\nratify it, Mary declined until she had by her side some of her Scottish\r\nCouncillors. The Scottish Parliament had been summoned in accordance\r\nwith the treaty, before the latter had been accepted by the sovereign,\r\nand consequently her refusal to ratify the treaty raised a host of\r\ndifficulties on all sides. It was felt universally that Mary might well\r\nexpect now the countenance of Philip in her pretensions to the English\r\ncrown, whilst all that was Catholic in France looked to her uncles,\r\nthe Guises, as leaders. The combination was too strong for Cecil to\r\nface directly, in addition to the Queen’s caprice and the factions\r\nof the English court, and his method of dealing with the matter was\r\ncharacteristically prudent. During the progress of Dudley’s negotiations\r\nwith the Spaniard to bring back England to Catholicism, the puritan Earl\r\nof Bedford was sent to France, ostensibly to ask Mary again to ratify the\r\ntreaty of Edinburgh, and to condole with her for the loss of her husband;\r\nbut his real object was to bring about an understanding with the Duke\r\nof Vendôme,[137] Coligny, and the French Protestants. At the same time\r\nRandolph was entrusted with an important message to the Protestant nobles\r\nof Scotland. He was to tell them that the Protestant princes of Germany\r\nwere firmly united; that the French reformers were now the stronger\r\nparty; that the Queen of England would stand by the Scots; and to exhort\r\nthem to be true to the Protestant faith, no matter what efforts might be\r\nmade to move them. Randolph was also to approach even Scottish Catholics,\r\nand point out what a favourable opportunity now occurred, the Queen of\r\nScots being free of her French connection, to form a close union between\r\nEngland and Scotland.[138]\r\n\r\nBut whilst this seed was germinating it was necessary for Cecil to dally\r\nwith the Catholics and “Philipians” in England. He accordingly went\r\n(March 1561) to the Spanish Ambassador with a message—secretly purporting\r\nto come from the Queen, but ostensibly from himself—to the effect that\r\nit would be a great favour to the Queen “and a help to this business” if\r\nPhilip would write her a letter as soon as possible, “urging her, in the\r\ninterests of her country, to marry at once; and, as she is disinclined\r\nto marry a foreigner, he advises her to choose one of her own subjects,\r\nwho, in such case, would receive Philip’s friendship and support.” Cecil\r\naffected to urge this course very warmly upon the Bishop, who, however,\r\nwas wary, and insisted upon knowing definitely whether the Queen herself\r\nhad sent the message. The only answer that Cecil would give was that it\r\nwas not fair to drive a modest maiden like the Queen up in a corner, and\r\nmake her personally responsible for steps leading to her own marriage.\r\nBut he told the Bishop that the reason Philip’s letter was necessary, was\r\nthat the Queen should submit it to a packed deputation of both Houses of\r\nParliament, so that her marriage with Dudley might, in appearance, have\r\nthe sanction of her people. No course so likely as this to frustrate the\r\nmatch could have been devised, as Dudley himself saw, for he fell ill\r\nof vexation; but, as the Bishop says, he was faint-hearted, and lacked\r\nability and courage to break through the snares that Cecil had spread\r\nfor him. The Bishop divined the plan very soon. “The deputation is being\r\narranged,” he says, “to suit him and the heretics, who have entire\r\ncontrol of the Queen.… She dares not go against Cecil’s advice, because\r\nshe thinks that both sides would then rise up against her.”\r\n\r\nCecil, “who,” he says, “is entirely pledged to these unhappy heresies,\r\nand is the leader of the business,” tried on more than one occasion to\r\ndraw the Spanish Bishop into religious controversy—the Bishop thought,\r\nwith the object of discovering whether Dudley or the Queen had gone\r\nfurther in their pledges than he had been told. He suggested that the\r\nPope should send theologians to England to discuss religion with English\r\ndivines, but the Bishop would not hear of it. Then he proposed that the\r\nBishop himself should secretly meet the Archbishop of Canterbury (Parker)\r\nand endeavour to bring about a religious _modus vivendi_; to which the\r\nSpaniard replied, that if they were sincere in their desire to agree,\r\nthey had better begin with the main points of difference, instead of\r\ndiscussing secondary points of dogma.[139]\r\n\r\nCecil assured him that the Queen would send representatives to the\r\nPope’s Council, on condition that it was held in a place satisfactory\r\nto other princes; that the Pope or his legate should preside over the\r\nCouncil, not so as to infer that he was the ruler of it, but only the\r\npresident of its deliberations; that questions of faith might be decided\r\nby Holy Scripture, the consensus of divines, and the decisions of\r\nearly councils; that the English bishops should be recognised as equals\r\nof the rest; and other conditions of the same sort, which obviously\r\nfrustrated—as they were meant to do—all hope of the religious compact,\r\nupon which Dudley’s hopes were ostensibly built. In the court, we are\r\ntold, Cecil went about saying that the Queen wished to send her envoys\r\nto the Council, but that a Council could not judge questions of faith,\r\nnor could the Pope, as of right, claim to preside.[140] On the one hand,\r\nhe reprehended the Bishop of Winchester (Horn) for preaching against\r\nthe authority of the Councils, and caused a meeting of bishops to be\r\ncalled at Lambeth, to settle a profession of faith to be sent to the\r\nCouncil; whilst, on the other, he told the Spaniard that if when the\r\nPope wrote to the Queen he did not give her her full titles of Queen of\r\nEngland and Defender of the Faith, she would not receive his letters.\r\nWell might Quadra say: “I do not know what to think of it all: these\r\npeople are in such a confusion that they confound me as well. Cecil\r\nis a very great heretic, but he is neither foolish nor false, and he\r\nprofesses to treat me very frankly. He has conceded to me these three\r\npoints, which I consider of the utmost importance, however much he may\r\ntwist them to the other side.” Whoever else may have been confused, we\r\nmay be certain that Cecil knew what he was about, for he completely\r\nhoodwinked and conciliated the Spanish Bishop and the Catholics until his\r\nnew combination was consolidated.[141] The English Catholics were more\r\nleniently treated; and the Queen and court were almost inconveniently\r\nfriendly with Quadra, who was obliged to whisper to his friends that it\r\nwas all make-believe. He said more truly than he thought at the time. At\r\nthe end of April, Cecil’s arrangements were complete, and the mask could\r\nbe dropped safely.\r\n\r\nAt the instance of Randolph the Scottish Lords of the Congregation had\r\ncommissioned James Stuart, Mary’s natural brother, afterwards Earl of\r\nMurray, who was already in English pay, to visit his sister in France,\r\nand influence her to return to Scotland pledged to the treaty of\r\nEdinburgh, and to place herself in the hands of the Protestant party.\r\nFor the moment the Guises in France were in disgrace, and plotting for\r\ntheir own advancement, so that it suited them to appear to acquiesce in\r\nan arrangement which promised that their niece should take possession\r\nof her kingdom without disturbance. James Stuart, carefully coached\r\nby Throgmorton, went back to London with the assurance that all was\r\nwell.[142] Mundt, in Germany, had drawn the league closer between England\r\nand the Princes; Bedford in France had completed a cordial arrangement\r\nwith Vendôme, Coligny, and the Protestants; Philip’s Netherlands were\r\nin seething discontent, his coffers were empty and he was in a death\r\ngrapple with the Turk for the mastery of the Mediterranean. There was\r\nnothing for England to fear, therefore. Circumstances and Cecil’s\r\ndiplomacy had placed once more all the cards into his hands, and again he\r\ncould go forward on a straight course.\r\n\r\nThe pretext for a change was given by the secret presence of a papal\r\nnuncio in Ireland. English Catholics were suddenly proceeded against all\r\nover the country for attending mass. Sir Edward Waldegrave and other\r\nex-members of Mary’s Council were thrown into the Tower; the Pope’s\r\nlegate, who was hurrying with all sorts of concessions, and an invitation\r\nto Elizabeth to send envoys to the Council of Trent, was refused\r\nadmittance into England; and the old Bishop of Aquila found once more\r\nthat Cecil had outwitted him. There were no more conciliatory religious\r\ndiscussions or amiable attentions; on the contrary, the Ambassador, to\r\nhis intense indignation, was accused of taking part in plots against\r\nthe Queen, and found himself slighted on all sides. A great outcry took\r\nplace that a conspiracy of Catholics had been discovered to poison the\r\nQueen, the rumour in all probability being part of the general plan to\r\nweaken and discredit the Catholic party; and Cecil himself drew up a\r\npaper, still extant,[143] urging her Majesty not to place any apparel\r\nnext her skin until it had been carefully examined, that no perfume\r\nshould be inhaled by her which came from a stranger, that no food should\r\nbe consumed by her unless it was dressed by her own cooks, that twice a\r\nweek she should take some _contra pestum_, that the back doors of her\r\napartments should be strictly guarded, and so forth. Whether Cecil was\r\nreally apprehensive of danger to the Queen at the time is uncertain;\r\nbut this general change of attitude towards the Catholics in less than\r\nfour months suspiciously coincided with the successful consolidation of\r\nthe Protestants throughout Europe, and the paralysation for harm both of\r\nSpain and France in the matter of Mary Stuart.\r\n\r\nHow far Dudley was sincere in his approaches to the Catholics on this\r\noccasion may be doubted. He would have been willing, of course, to\r\nhave paid any price—or rather have made his country pay any price—for\r\nhis marriage with the Queen; but there are circumstances which tend to\r\nthe belief that he and Cecil, for once, had joined their forces, Cecil\r\nprobably promising his support to Dudley’s suit in exchange for this\r\nclever “entertaining” of Spain and the Catholics until the Protestant\r\ncoalition was formed. In any case, Dudley was in nowise cast down at the\r\nrupture of the negotiations, but remained on excellent terms with Cecil,\r\nand flirted with the Queen more furiously than ever. In the meanwhile\r\nthe King of Sweden had made all preparations for visiting England. The\r\nextreme Protestant party had continued to encourage him during the\r\ntime that the Queen, Cecil, and Dudley were lulling the Catholics; but\r\nnow that the Catholic mask had been dropped, Eric’s visit was very\r\ninconvenient to the Queen. Mary Stuart was a widow, and every court in\r\nEurope was intriguing for her marriage.[144] Elizabeth knew that if\r\nshe was forced into a marriage with the King of Sweden, Mary would\r\nimmediately be wedded to a nominee of Philip, for which object Cardinal\r\nLorraine was already planning. Eric was therefore refused a passport into\r\nEngland;[145] the Lord Mayor was ordered to suppress the prints which had\r\nbeen scattered by the Protestants, representing Elizabeth and Eric XIV.\r\ntogether (July 1561),[146] and the embarrassment of the Swede’s advances\r\nwas postponed until a more convenient season.\r\n\r\nThe English Catholics were naturally losing heart. They had looked in\r\nvain for help from Philip ever since the Queen’s accession. The war party\r\nin the Spanish King’s councils had ceaselessly urged him to overturn\r\nElizabeth and the “heretics” before their power was consolidated.\r\nFeria and his successor the Bishop had done their best to keep alive\r\nthe hopes of Elizabeth’s enemies in England; but as year followed year\r\nand leaden-footed Philip moved not the English Catholics began to cast\r\ntheir eyes elsewhere. Mary Stuart arrived in Scotland (19th August\r\n1561) surrounded by her Lorraine kinsmen. Elizabeth now thoroughly\r\ndistrusted her, for she saw that she was her match in dissimulation, at\r\nall events, and made some show of intercepting her on the voyage;[147]\r\nbut her Scottish subjects of all faiths were ready to welcome the\r\nyoung half-foreign Queen from whom they hoped so much. The country was\r\npractically in a condition of anarchy; but the administration, such as\r\nit was, was in the hands of the reform party under Maitland and James\r\nStuart. Although herself devoutly following the Catholic faith—to the\r\ndisgust of the predominant party—the Queen soon after her arrival\r\nconfirmed the free exercise of the Protestant worship, and for a time\r\nboth she and her ministers were popular. To the north, therefore, the\r\nEnglish Catholic party now cast their eyes. Catharine Grey had recently\r\ncontracted a doubtful marriage with the eldest son (Hertford) of the\r\nProtector Somerset, and was out of the question as a Catholic candidate;\r\nbut Mary Stuart’s claim to the English throne was in many respects better\r\nthan that of Elizabeth herself. Lady Margaret Lennox, too, was busy in\r\nthe north of England, where the population was mainly Catholic, plotting\r\nfor the marriage of her son and the subsequent raising of the country in\r\nthe interests of Mary and a Catholic England.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Elizabeth was somewhat roughly demanding to know why\r\nMary delayed the ratification of the treaty of Edinburgh, and jealously\r\nwatching for any signs of matrimonial negotiations to her detriment.\r\nThe Earl of Arran, Elizabeth’s candidate for Mary Stuart’s hand, was\r\nextremely unpopular with the Scottish people, and soon became impossible\r\nas a consort for the Queen; and the carefully laid plans of Elizabeth and\r\nCecil in Scotland were seen to be at the mercy of a secret matrimonial\r\nintrigue, which might be sprung upon them at any moment. Maitland of\r\nLethington, Mary’s Secretary of State, ostensibly a Protestant, went\r\nto London[148] and saw Cecil in September, in the hope of arranging\r\nmatters. He professed to be sanguine about the Arran marriage; but\r\nthough bound to the English interest, he protested more than once on his\r\nreturn, in letters to Cecil, upon the pressure exerted upon his mistress\r\nto renounce her English birthright, and even begged the Secretary to\r\nfurnish him with a draft of a reply for Mary to send which he thought\r\nmight satisfy Elizabeth. Whilst Lord James, Maitland, and Cecil were\r\ntrying to conciliate and calm matters, the zealot Knox and his like\r\nwere clamouring for extreme measures and embittering spirits on both\r\nsides. Cecil in vain counselled Knox to be moderate; the reply reproaches\r\nhim for “swimming betwixt two waters,” and throws all the blame for\r\nthe troubles on moderate statesmen like Lord James and Lethington,\r\n“whose mistaken forbearance and gentleness” he denounces. The young\r\nQueen, he says, will never be of “our opinion, and in very deed her\r\nwhole proceedings do declare that the Cardinal’s lessons are so deeply\r\nimprinted on her heart, that they … are like to perish together.… In\r\ncommunication with her I espied such craft as I have not found in such\r\nage.”\r\n\r\nThis opinion must only be accepted as that of a bitterly severe man on\r\none whose position was as difficult as can well be conceived. English\r\nCatholics, Mary knew, now looked to her as their only hope. She was a\r\ndaughter of kings, brought up in a deep school of statecraft, and was\r\ndetermined to resist the demanded renunciation of her birthright in\r\nEngland at the bidding of a rival. Her letter to Elizabeth (5th January\r\n1562)[149] explains why she declined to ratify the treaty of Edinburgh,\r\npathetically pleads that the clause in the treaty renouncing her rights\r\nto the English succession was agreed to without her authority, and she\r\nappeals to the generosity of so near a cousin not to make her a stranger\r\nto her own blood. She will, she says, make a new treaty on Elizabeth’s\r\nown terms, if her rights to succeed, failing Elizabeth’s issue, are not\r\nprejudiced. But on this point Elizabeth would never give way. As we have\r\nseen, it was the keynote of Cecil’s policy all his life to secure England\r\nfrom the presence of a probable enemy on the Scottish border, and this\r\nquestion of Mary’s claim to the English succession, especially with her\r\nmarriage still undecided, touched the heart of the whole matter. It\r\nwas evident, moreover, that at this juncture the great trial of arms\r\nbetween the Catholics and Protestants throughout Europe was at hand.\r\nThe war of religion was already looming near in France and Flanders,\r\npapal emissaries had incited armed revolt in Ireland against the Queen’s\r\nProtestant measures, and English Catholics were in a dangerous state of\r\nferment.[150] It was therefore of the most vital interest, not only to\r\nEngland and Elizabeth, but to the reform party throughout Europe, that no\r\nadvantage should be given in Scotland to vigilant enemies, who, by the\r\ncontrol of that country, would have been enabled to ruin the acknowledged\r\nhead of the Protestant confederacy. It is the fashion to accuse Elizabeth\r\nand Cecil of unprincipled rancour against Mary Stuart. Generosity and\r\nmagnanimity, it may be conceded, were not conspicuous characteristics of\r\neither of them. But before judging too harshly, it should be considered\r\nthat their lives, the freedom and independence of England, and the fate\r\nof the reformed religion depended almost inevitably upon the course of\r\nevents in Scotland, and both Elizabeth and her minister would have been\r\nfalse to their trust if they had not availed themselves of all the means\r\nwhich circumstances and the feeling of the times placed in their hands to\r\nprevent Mary Stuart and her country from precipitating their downfall.\r\n\r\nCecil’s position in London also was surrounded with difficulties. The\r\nCatholics, even those about the Queen, were busy, and reports of plans\r\nfor poisoning Elizabeth continued without cessation. Everything, great\r\nand small, had to be done by Cecil. “He has,” writes the Bishop of\r\nAquila, “absolutely taken possession of the Queen and Council, but he\r\nis so perplexed and unpopular that I do not know how he will be able\r\nto stand if there are any disturbances.”[151] The Queen, moreover,\r\nfell ill: “she is falling away and is extremely thin, and the colour\r\nof a corpse.” The sorely tried Secretary, bearing upon his shoulders\r\neverybody’s burden, frequently sick himself,[152] but working early\r\nand late, endeavouring to keep a middle course whilst holding to his\r\npolicy, naturally aroused no enthusiasm. Extreme men of all parties\r\ncavilled at his methods; only the Queen grew in her trust of him, for\r\nshe at least understood, as perhaps no other person did, that he was\r\nalmost the only person near her who was not bribed. The city and the\r\ntrading classes, however, by this time had seen the good results of his\r\ncommercial and fiscal policy. From the first days of the reign he had\r\nset about reforming the currency, and he enters in his diary for 29th\r\nMay of this year (1561) a statement which shows that his labours at last\r\nbore fruit. “Base monies decried and fine silver coined,” he writes;\r\nand in November a proclamation was issued that Spanish gold and silver\r\nmoney, which during the debasement of English coin had been a favourite\r\nform of currency, should no longer be allowed, but should be taken to\r\nthe Queen’s mint for exchange into English coin. “The Queen,” grumbles\r\nthe Spanish Ambassador, “makes a profit on it, as she did with the other\r\nmoney she called in.” No doubt she did, but the new pure coinage placed\r\nEnglish merchants at an immense advantage in trading abroad, and they\r\nthanked Cecil for it.[153] “There hath,” says Camden, “been better and\r\npurer money in England than was seen in two hundred years before, or hath\r\nbeen elsewhere in use throughout Europe.” Nor was this all. Shipbuilding\r\nunder subsidy had progressed very rapidly, and English commerce was\r\npenetrating into regions hitherto unapproached.[154] The Hawkinses had\r\nalready shown the way to the West Coast of Africa, but the Portuguese\r\nhad so far successfully resisted the establishment of a regular trade.\r\nEnglish ships, however, now found their way down to Elmina, on the Gold\r\nCoast, with frequency distressing to the Portuguese; whilst English and\r\nScotch privateers, and pirates who called themselves such, preyed almost\r\nunchecked upon Spanish and Flemish small craft about the Channel. Against\r\nboth of these grievances the Spanish and Portuguese ministers complained\r\noften and bitterly. Throughout his life Cecil set his face against piracy\r\nin all its forms, as being inimical to legitimate trade, and at his\r\ninstance five of the Queen’s ships were fitted out (1561) for the purpose\r\nof suppressing the corsairs; but to the other complaint he turned a very\r\ndifferent face.\r\n\r\nA syndicate had been formed, in which Dudley, Wynter (Master of the\r\nOrdnance), Gonson (Controller of the Navy), Sir William Garrard, and\r\nprobably the Queen herself, had shares, to send out a strong expedition\r\nto establish a permanent trading-station on the Gold Coast.[155] There\r\nwere to be at least four ships, one of which, the _Mignon_, belonged to\r\nthe Queen. Protests and remonstrances from Portuguese and Spaniards were\r\nfreely made to Cecil, who replied they could not prevent merchants from\r\ngoing to trade where they thought fit. When the Bishop of Aquila pressed\r\nhim further, he answered, “that the Pope had no right to partition the\r\nworld and to give and take kingdoms.… This idea is the real reason\r\nwhich moved them to oppose the legality of our denunciation of these\r\nexpeditions much more than any profit they expect to get.… They think\r\nthis navigation business will be a good pretext for breaking the peace,\r\nas your Majesty must needs uphold the Pope’s authority, against which,\r\nboth here and in Germany, all will join. I feigned not to understand\r\nCecil’s meaning, and treated the matter as concerning the King of\r\nPortugal only” (27th November 1561).[156] A draft reply in Cecil’s hand\r\nto similar remonstrances from the Portuguese Ambassador in April of the\r\nsame year, is still more dignified: “The Queen does not acknowledge the\r\nright of the King of Portugal to forbid the subjects of another prince\r\nfrom trading where they like, and she will take care that her subjects\r\nare not worse treated in the King of Portugal’s dominions than his are in\r\nhers.”[157]\r\n\r\nAmidst his manifold public anxieties Cecil had to bear his share of\r\nprivate trouble. His notes in the Perpetual Calendar at Hatfield record\r\nthe successive births and deaths of two infant William Cecils, one at\r\nCannon Row in 1559, and the other at Wimbledon in 1561; but at this\r\nperiod he had a daughter and a son living, by his second wife. Thomas,\r\nhis only son by his first marriage with Mary Cheke, was now a young man\r\nof twenty, and in order that he might receive the polish fitting to the\r\nheir of a great personage, his father consulted Sir Nicholas Throgmorton,\r\nthe Ambassador in Paris, in the spring of 1561, with regard to sending\r\nhim thither. Cecil’s own idea was to place him in the household of\r\nColigny, the Admiral of France, now one of the acknowledged leaders\r\nof the Protestant party; but Throgmorton, who foresaw, doubtless, the\r\nrapidly approaching civil war, dissuaded him from this. “Though you\r\nhave made the best choice of any man in France, yet for some respects\r\nI think the matter should be deferred.” His advice was that lodgings\r\nshould be taken for young Cecil near the embassy, where he might share\r\nthe Ambassador’s table. The youth, he thought, should be “taught to ride,\r\nplay the lute, dance, play tennis, and use such exercises as are noted\r\nornaments of courtiers.”[158] A subsequent recommendation of Thomas\r\nWindebank, the young man’s governor, to the effect that it would be well\r\nto accept Throgmorton’s offer, although Sir William Cecil was loth to\r\ntrespass on his friend’s hospitality, in order that the youth “might\r\nlearn to behave himself, not only at table, but otherwise, according\r\nto his estate,”[159] leads us to the conclusion that Thomas Cecil had\r\nthitherto not been an apt scholar. Some of the details of Thomas’s\r\njourney are curious. In addition to Windebank he was accompanied by two\r\nservants, and three geldings, which, Throgmorton thought, might as well\r\nbe sold, as he could obtain others in Paris. The lodgings in Paris for\r\nthe party and horses would cost about ten sun-crowns a month, and in\r\naddition to the money they brought they should have a letter of credit\r\nfor three hundred crowns. Young Thomas had been to France before by way\r\nof Calais,[160] and on this occasion, that he might see fresh country, he\r\nwent by Rye, Dieppe, and Rouen; and the intention was that he should stay\r\nin or near Paris for a year, and then proceed to Italy. Windebank appears\r\nto have been unequal to his task, and to have had no control over Thomas.\r\nIn vain Sir William pressed both his son and Windebank to send him an\r\naccount of their expenses, and from the first it is seen that the father\r\nwas misgiving and anxious. Cecil was a reserved man, full of public\r\naffairs; but this correspondence[161] proves that he was also a man of\r\ndeep family affection, and, above all, that he regarded with horror the\r\nidea that any scandal should attach to his honoured name. In his first\r\nletter to his son, 14th July 1561, after the arrival of the latter in\r\nParis, he strikes the note of distrust. “He wishes him God’s blessing,\r\nbut how he inclines himself to deserve it he knows not.” None of his\r\nson’s three letters, he complains, makes any mention of the expense he\r\nis incurring. He urges him at once to begin to translate French; and\r\nthen says, “Fare ye well. Write every time somewhat to my wife.” To\r\nWindebank the anxious father is more outspoken. How are they spending\r\ntheir time, he asks, and heartily prays that Thomas may serve God with\r\nfear and reverence. But Thomas seems to have done nothing of the sort;\r\nfor, in nearly every letter, Windebank urges Sir William to repeat his\r\ninjunctions about prayer to his son. But the scapegrace paid little heed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they arrived in Paris, Thomas sold his horse for forty crowns,\r\nand kept the money for his own spending. Throgmorton was soon tired of\r\nhim, and advised that he should be sent to Orleans or elsewhere, away\r\nfrom the heat and distractions of Paris; but Thomas was well satisfied\r\nwhere he was. “Of study there is little or nothing yet,” he coolly writes\r\nto his father, after he had been in Paris for a month. They were still\r\nsight-seeing, and he grows almost eloquent in his description of a fight\r\nhe had seen at court between a lion and three dogs, in which the latter\r\nwere victorious. They lodged in the house of a gentleman, “a courtier\r\nand learned, but of indifferent good religion,” to whom they paid three\r\nhundred crowns a month for board and lodging; but this was not by any\r\nmeans all the expense. The heir spent £20 for his winter clothes; he must\r\nhave a fashionable footcloth for his riding nag. The horses, too, were\r\nexpensive, and Sir William complained. All gentlemen of estimation here\r\nride, writes Windebank, and if he follow not the manner of the country,\r\nhe will be less considered: “if all gentlemen ride, it is not meet for\r\nMr. Thomas to go afoot.”\r\n\r\nThe father was accompanying the Queen during the autumn on her progress\r\nthrough Essex, and writes from various country-houses to his son and\r\nWindebank, begging the former to study, to pray, to avoid ill company,\r\nto take heed of surfeits, late suppers, prodigality, and the like; but\r\napparently to no effect. Thomas wrote rarely and badly, his French did\r\nnot improve, and he still failed to write to his learned step-mother,\r\ngreatly to his father’s anger. At length he fell seriously ill, and\r\npromised amendment, which for a time seemed hopeful.\r\n\r\nThrough all the father’s anxiety his master passions for books,\r\nheraldry, and gardening are discernible, as well as his pride of race.\r\nHe constantly orders Windebank to send him stated books, and to keep\r\non the look-out for new plants, or good gardeners, that may be sent to\r\nEngland. In September he requests that some booksellers’ catalogues may\r\nbe forwarded, that he may select some books to “garnish” his library.\r\nHe was anxious that his son should study the genealogy and alliances of\r\nnoble French families, and prays that a herald may be engaged to instruct\r\nhim. But Thomas soon relapsed, and rumour of his ill-behaviour reached\r\nSir William, not at first from Windebank. In March 1562 an angry and\r\nindignant letter went from Cecil to his son, reproaching him for his bad\r\nconduct. There was no amendment, he said, and all who came from Paris\r\ngave him the character of “a dissolute, slothful, negligent, and careless\r\nyoung man,” and the letter is signed, “Your father of an unworthy son.” A\r\nweek later, 2nd April, Cecil wrote a characteristic and affecting letter\r\nto Windebank, which deserves to be quoted nearly in full, for it shows us\r\nthe man more clearly than reams of State papers. “Windebank,” it runs,\r\n“I am here used to pains and troubles, but none creep so near my heart\r\nas doth this of my lewd son. I am perplexed what to think. The shame\r\nthat I shall receive to have so unruled a son grieveth me more than if\r\nI had lost him in honest death. Good Windebank, consult my dear friend\r\nSir Nicholas Throgmorton, to whom I have referred the whole. I could be\r\nbest content that he would commit him secretly to some sharp prison.\r\nIf this shall not seem good, yet would I rather have him sent away to\r\nStrasburg if possible, or to Lorraine, for my grief will grow double to\r\nsee him before some sort of amends. If none of these will serve, then\r\nbring him home and I shall receive that which it pleaseth God to lay on\r\nmy shoulders; that is, in the midst of my business, for comfort a daily\r\ntorment. If ye shall come home with him, to cover the shame, let it\r\nappear to be by reason of the troubles there.[162] I rather desire to\r\nhave this summer spent, though it were but to be absent from my sight. I\r\nam so troubled as well, what to write I know not.”\r\n\r\nWindebank had been protesting for some time his own unfitness—which was\r\nobvious—and sending hints of the ill-conduct of his charge, who had\r\nborrowed money on the credit of others, and scandalised his friends by\r\nhis dissoluteness; but at last the long-suffering tutor rebelled, and\r\nwrote, 26th April, to Cecil, “I have forborne to write plainly, but now\r\nI am clean out of hope, and am forced to do so. Sir, I see that Mr.\r\nThomas has utterly no mind nor disposition to apply to any learning;\r\nbeing carried away by other affections that rule him, so that it maketh\r\nhim forget his duty in all things;” and with this Windebank resigns his\r\ncharge, for Thomas had openly defied him; advocates his immediate recall\r\nif the war in France will allow him to come, or otherwise that he should\r\nbe sent to Flanders. But Windebank himself had had enough of Thomas\r\nCecil, and refused to accompany him further.\r\n\r\nThis instructive correspondence helps us to see that, beyond even his\r\nwounded paternal affection, Sir William Cecil’s deepest feeling was\r\nsensitiveness to the opinion of the world about him. That his son should\r\nbe unworthy touched him to the quick; but that the world should see\r\nany shame or reproach resting upon the heir of his house and name, was\r\nunendurable agony to one whose main social aims were to trace an ancient\r\nancestry and head a noble posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n1562-1564\r\n\r\n\r\nThe abortive conspiracy of the Hamiltons in the spring of 1562, and\r\nArran’s madness, finally proved the hopelessness of his suit for Mary’s\r\nhand, and Lord James and Maitland had now abandoned him. Both of those\r\nstatesmen, in union with Cecil, still strove to hold the balance evenly,\r\nand to avoid religious strife in the country, in the hope that if the\r\nScottish Queen married a nominee of England, Elizabeth would eventually\r\nrecognise her as the heiress to the English throne. But the agitation\r\nof the English Catholics, and the attempts of Darnley’s mother to force\r\nmatters, had rendered the position extremely difficult, and Cecil was\r\nbusy unravelling plots real and imaginary. The visit of a Swedish\r\nAmbassador to Scotland on a matrimonial mission had caused a sudden\r\nscare in London; but Mary’s prompt dismissal of him, and her continued\r\namiable letters to Elizabeth, had somewhat disarmed suspicion against her\r\npersonally. Her uncle the Marquis d’Elbœuf was splendidly entertained\r\nin the English court on his way home to France, and negotiations were\r\nset on foot for a visit of Mary to the north of England in the summer,\r\nfor the purpose of an interview with the English Queen. But withal\r\nCecil was ill at ease, for the Guises and the Catholics of France were\r\nnow in arms,[163] and it was impossible to see how the great struggle\r\nof the faith would end. If the Guises finally captured the government\r\nof France, then England must accept Philip’s terms for a Spanish\r\nalliance, or be inevitably ruined. But for the present it was the\r\npolicy of Elizabeth and Cecil to keep a tight rein on the Catholics in\r\nEngland,[164] and encourage Condé and Coligny in France.[165]\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Aquila had been growing more and more discontented in his\r\npalace in the Strand (Durham Place). He had no counsels to give to his\r\nmaster now but those of violence, for he had been outwitted too often\r\nto believe in the interested professions of any party in Elizabeth’s\r\ncourt. But the emissaries of the discontented Catholics, the servants\r\nof turbulent Lady Margaret Lennox, Shan O’Neil, and his train of wild\r\ngallowglasses—all those who hated Elizabeth and Protestantism—found\r\nin the old Bishop an eager listener to their whispered treason. Cecil\r\nknew all this, for his spies were everywhere. That the Bishop was up to\r\nmischief was clear; but yet Cecil did not know whether he was hatching\r\nany plot in connection with Mary Stuart’s marriage; and that was the\r\nmain point of danger for the present. The Queen of Scots, it is true,\r\nhad more than once expressed to Randolph, the English Ambassador, her\r\ndisapproval of the attitude of her uncles in France. If she wished to\r\nkeep friendly with her own ministers and the English Queen, indeed, it\r\nwas necessary for her to do so; but her powers of dissimulation were\r\nknown; the religious struggle had drawn the Guises nearer to Philip;\r\nand the Queen-mother, herself alarmed at the rising power and warlike\r\nattitude of princes of the blood, like Navarre and Condé, was once more\r\nturning to her Spanish son-in-law and the Catholics. A Catholic plot\r\ncombining the Guises, Philip, Mary Stuart, and Catharine de Medici, would\r\nbe threatening indeed, and it behoved Cecil to be watchful.[166]\r\n\r\nAs Durham House had only been lent to the Spanish Ambassador by the\r\nQueen, Cecil had appointed the English gatekeeper at the gate in the\r\nStrand, and from him learnt of those who went in and out, even by the\r\nriver stairs. But this was not enough. At the end of April he contrived\r\nto buy over an Italian secretary of the Bishop, a man named Borghese\r\nVenturini, from whom he obtained particulars of the Ambassador’s\r\nletters.[167] They abounded with treasonable suggestions, dark hints at\r\nconspiracy, and vituperation of the Queen and Cecil, but they disclosed\r\nno deep-laid plot of Spain. Cecil nevertheless was not satisfied, and\r\nkept on the watch.\r\n\r\nThe Prince of Condé and the Protestants were now in array against the\r\nGuises, and Catharine de Medici was in the power of the latter. Both\r\nsides had striven to obtain the help of the German Protestant princes,\r\nbut, in a great measure due to Cecil’s foresight, their sympathies\r\nwere on the side of Condé. Cecil laboured incessantly, but against many\r\ndifficulties, for the Queen was anxious to avoid the cost and risk of\r\npledging herself too deeply. In an important letter to Throgmorton, 16th\r\nJuly 1562, he thus lays bare his plans and his obstacles: “Our thynges\r\nhere depend so upon those matters ther (_i.e._ in France) that yow shall\r\nwell ynough judg thereof without advertisement. This _hardness_ here will\r\nindanger all, I feare. Sir Thomas Wroth, I trust, shall into Germany with\r\nspede: my device is to sollicite them, and to offer a contribution for an\r\narmy to enter France.… Good Mr. Throgmorton, omitt not now to advertise\r\nus from time to time, for this Bishop of Aquila letteth not weekly to\r\nforge new devices.… Continue your wryting to putt the Quene’s Majesty in\r\nremembrance of her peril if the Guisans prosper. And so, being overweryed\r\nwith care, I end.”[168]\r\n\r\nThere is another document of the same period in Cecil’s hand, which also\r\nshows how earnestly he tried to combat the peril, and make the Queen\r\nand Council understand it. It is a memorial setting forth “the perills\r\ngrowing uppon the overthrow of the Prince of Condé’s cause,”[169] and\r\npoints out that if Condé be allowed to fall, the Guises would be supreme\r\nin France, “and to maynteane their faction they will pleasure the King\r\nof Spayne all that they maye. Hereupon shall follow a complott betwixt\r\nthem twoo … the King of Spayne to unhable the house of Navarre for ever\r\nclayming the Kingdom of Navarre; and the house of Guise to promote their\r\nniece the Queen of Scotts to the crown of England. For doing thereof twoo\r\nthyngs principally will be attempted: the marriage of the sayd Queen with\r\nthe Prince of Spayne, and the realme of Ireland to be given in a paye to\r\nthe King of Spayne.” All English Catholics, he continues, will be told to\r\nmake ready, and at a given moment rise; the Council of Trent will condemn\r\nall Protestants; the Guises, Spain, and the Pope will unite England and\r\nScotland under Mary, and Protestantism will be undone. It will be, he\r\nsays, too late then to withstand it, “for it shall be lyke a great rock\r\nof stone that is fallyng downe from the topp of a mountayn, which when it\r\nis comming no force can stey.”\r\n\r\nCecil’s own efforts were unwearied and ubiquitous. Randolph in Scotland,\r\nThrogmorton in France, Mundt with the German princes, and Sir Peter\r\nMewtys, and afterwards Throgmorton with Condé, seconded him manfully.\r\nSpies, and secret agents paid by him, were in every court and every camp;\r\nthe prisons were crammed with recusants; the Earl of Lennox, Darnley’s\r\nfather, was in the Tower; his wife, Lady Margaret, was in durance at\r\nShene; whilst her questionable words and treasonable practices were\r\nbeing slowly unravelled by informers,[170] the English Catholic nobles\r\nwere closely watched, and for a month every line the Spanish Ambassador\r\nwrote was secretly conveyed to Cecil by Borghese. Once, early in May,\r\nthe Bishop’s courier, with important letters for the Duchess of Parma,\r\nwas stopped two miles beyond Gravesend by pretended highwaymen, who were\r\nreally gentlemen (the brothers Cobham) in Cecil’s pay, and the man was\r\ndetained whilst the letters were sent to the Secretary to be deciphered\r\nand copied. At last things came to a crisis, the old Ambassador\r\ndiscovered that Borghese was the traitor,[171] and the latter in fear\r\nof his life, having fought with a fellow-servant, fled to Cecil. The\r\nBishop was in a towering rage, and complained bitterly to the Queen. She\r\ntold him that if she suspected that anything was being written in her\r\ncountry to her detriment, she should stop posts and examine what she\r\npleased; and when he pleaded privilege, she retorted, that he was not\r\nprivileged to plot injury to her in her own realm. In vain the Bishop\r\nprotested that he had not plotted, and railed against Cecil. He only\r\nhad Dudley on his side, and Dudley did not count for much in a great\r\nemergency like this.[172] The next day (23rd May) Cecil wrote a dignified\r\nletter to the Ambassador. He honours him as the King’s Ambassador, he\r\nsays, reverences him as a bishop, and esteems him as a nobleman; and he\r\nwishes to know in which capacity he complains of his acts. He, Cecil, is\r\nready, as a son of no mean ancestry, to justify himself to the Bishop\r\nin either character; but if the Bishop has “any evil opinion of him, he\r\nwill thank him to address him personally, and not complain to others.”\r\nThe Bishop’s reply was equally stiff. He cannot approve of his, Cecil’s,\r\nadvice on public matters, which has great weight with the Queen, but that\r\ndoes not diminish his respect for him in his private capacity.[173] In\r\nvain the Bishop prayed his master to recall him if he could not protect\r\nhim against the insults to which he was exposed; in vain he tried to\r\nmove Elizabeth, by alternate flattery and threats, to restore Borghese\r\nto him; in vain he endeavoured to bribe his servant back again, or to\r\nhave him killed; Cecil was ready for him at every turn, and he could do\r\nno more than plot and pray for vengeance in his private rooms at Durham\r\nPlace, whilst Cecil was examining informers against him and the Queen was\r\nthreatening him with expulsion.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Mary Stuart was still on her good behaviour, in the\r\nhope that the statesmen’s plan for an agreement with Elizabeth on the\r\nbasis of the recognition by the latter of Mary’s claim to the English\r\nsuccession might eventually be adopted. Secretary Maitland of Lethington\r\nwas in London in the summer in the interests of this plan, and for the\r\npurpose of arranging the much talked-of meeting between the Queens.\r\nMary was eager for the interview, from which she expected much, and\r\nElizabeth, supported by Dudley, was also in favour of it. But Cecil from\r\nthe first looked coldly upon it, although, as usual, his opposition to\r\nit was indirect and covert. The whole of his policy at present turned\r\nupon supporting the French Huguenots in arms, and ruining the Guises; and\r\nit is obvious that too close a friendship between the Queens would have\r\nparalysed him in this direction. The matter of the interview was dragged\r\nout and talked about until the season became too late for it to be held\r\nthat year, and, greatly to Mary’s disappointment, it was postponed\r\nnominally until the following summer. The intrigue to marry Mary to\r\nDarnley had unquestionably gone far. It was warmly supported by Catharine\r\nde Medici, who was, of course, against a Spanish marriage; by Lord James,\r\nas offering the best prospect of peace and the English succession to\r\nhis sister; and by Dudley, because it might furnish a precedent for his\r\nown marriage with Elizabeth. The latter affected to approve of it for a\r\ntime; but she dreaded the union of the two strongest claimants to her\r\nsuccession, and was never really in favour of it.\r\n\r\nSlowly, but surely, Cecil’s policy gained ground. To cripple the\r\nCatholic party in France and destroy the influence of the Guises, would\r\nrender impossible that which of all things he dreaded most, namely, a\r\nFrench domination of Scotland in the interest of Catholicism. With the\r\nostensible object of suppressing piracy in the Channel, a considerable\r\nfleet was fitted out in the mouth of the Humber, but with the real aim\r\nof carrying aid to the Huguenots when an opportune moment arrived.\r\nProtestant Germans and Switzers had flocked to Condé, Dandelot and\r\nColigny. Montgomerie held Rouen against the Guises, and the Vidame de\r\nChartres seized Havre de Grace. An emissary came from the Vidame in July,\r\nto offer this important port to the Queen of England as a base from which\r\nto help the reformers. The offer was a tempting one, for it might enable\r\nher to insist later upon the restoration of Calais; but Elizabeth was\r\ndistrustful.[174]\r\n\r\nPhilip’s sister, the Governess of the Netherlands, sent a remonstrance,\r\nshocked at the very idea that a Queen should send aid to rebels against\r\ntheir sovereign; Catharine de Medici despatched Marshal Vielleville to\r\nthreaten Elizabeth with a national war both with France and Spain if\r\nshe sent assistance to Condé and those who were in arms against the\r\nGovernment. But Philip’s Netherlands were now in almost open revolt, and\r\nthough he made a show of sending troops to help the French Catholics, it\r\nwas evident that he could not do much, and for the present Elizabeth and\r\nCecil could disregard him, knowing that if the worst came to the worst,\r\nhe would never allow the French influence in England to become dominant.\r\nOn the 20th September, Elizabeth signed the treaty by which she agreed to\r\nsend a large sum of money and 6000 troops to France to aid Condé; 3000\r\nof which were to hold Havre, and the rest to reinforce the Huguenots in\r\nDieppe and Rouen. Elizabeth, in a proclamation drawn up by Cecil, swore\r\nthat she took this step for the defence of the French King,[175] and\r\nsent all sorts of reassuring messages to Catharine and her son; but the\r\npregnant fact still remained, that civil war in France was to be promoted\r\nby an English army, and that the Queen of England had for the first time\r\nopenly assumed the position of leader of the Protestant faith throughout\r\nthe world, in defiance of the Governments both of France and Spain.\r\n\r\nHow great was the Queen’s hesitation to the last at assuming this vast\r\nresponsibility is seen in a letter from Cecil to his old friend, Sir\r\nThomas Smith, who was sent to replace Throgmorton as Ambassador to France\r\n(Sir Nicholas remaining with Condé) only a week before the English\r\nforce actually sailed (22nd September 1562). “When our men shall goo,”\r\nhe writes, “or whether they shall goo or not, I cannot mak certain.\r\nI mean to send yow as soon as the fact is enterprised.… We begyn to\r\nhear of towardness to accord, and then we shall lose much labour.” The\r\ntroops sailed under Sir Adrian Poynings on the 27th September, and\r\nwere subsequently commanded by the Earl of Warwick, Dudley’s brother.\r\nSuddenly, a few days afterwards, the Queen fell ill of smallpox at\r\nHampton Court, and for a time was like to die. The confusion of the\r\ncourt was great, for the succession was still undecided. Dudley and a\r\nconsiderable party of his friends were openly, almost violently, in\r\nfavour of the Earl of Huntingdon; whilst others headed by Cecil were\r\nstrongly desirous of following the will of Henry VIII., and adopting\r\nCatharine Grey. The Catholics were divided, and advised the examination\r\nof the question from a legal point of view; but whilst the dissensions\r\nwere in progress, the Queen unexpectedly rallied and the danger passed.\r\nDuring her peril she had expressed the most extravagant affection for\r\nDudley, and begged the Council to appoint him Protector; but with her\r\nrecovery affairs assumed their normal course, the only outcome of the\r\nillness being the great strengthening of Dudley’s influence, and his\r\nappointment to the Council with the Duke of Norfolk. The effect of\r\nDudley’s rise, which meant the temporary decline of Cecil, was soon seen.\r\nThe fall of Rouen and Dieppe to the King caused the English contingent\r\nto be concentrated at Havre, where a reinforcement of 2000 more men was\r\nreported to be required to hold the place. The Queen began to look with\r\nalarm at her responsibility, and the Council was prompt in throwing the\r\nblame upon Cecil, who absented himself from the meetings on the pretext\r\nof illness. Secret attempts were made also to bring about a pacification\r\nbetween Condé, the Guises, the Queen-mother and England, greatly to the\r\ndisgust of Throgmorton, who dreaded a close friendship with the French as\r\nmuch as Cecil himself.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations with Catharine de Medici were conducted by Smith, and\r\nwere based upon the restoration of Calais to Elizabeth, the toleration\r\nof Protestantism in France, and the assurance of the Guises that they\r\nwould not interfere in Scotland;[176] but whilst they were in progress\r\nthe war followed its course. The King of Navarre fell fighting before\r\nRouen against his former friends, the Protestants; at the great battle of\r\nDreux (19th December 1562), Condé, the Protestant chief, and Constable\r\nMontmorenci on the Catholic side, were taken prisoners, and Coligny, with\r\na mere remnant of his Protestants, alone kept the field. At the siege of\r\nOrleans (18th February 1563), Guise was assassinated, and a pacification\r\nthen became possible. Condé, away from honest Coligny and La Noue, was\r\nbut a weak vessel, as his brother Navarre had been, and Catharine well\r\nknew how to manage such men. All of Cecil’s distrust of the French was\r\njustified, and the shameful treaty of Amboise was signed (19th March),\r\nleaving Elizabeth and the English in the lurch. The moment that English\r\npolicy escaped from the capable hands of Cecil, to pass temporarily\r\nunder the lamentable influence of Dudley, disaster and failure were the\r\ninevitable result.\r\n\r\nThe Queen could do no more than rail at Condé’s envoy, Briquemault,\r\nand call his master a lying scamp; pestilence and famine decimated the\r\nEnglish garrison at Havre, closely beleaguered by the French; and in the\r\nautumn of 1563 the force had to be withdrawn without glory or material\r\nsatisfaction. Before this happened, however, cautious Cecil was gradually\r\nworking affairs into his own groove again. Dudley had continued to send\r\namiable messages to the Spanish Ambassador, whilst promoting an agreement\r\nwith the French Government, and had exercised his influence in favour of\r\nthe release of Lennox from the Tower; the object being in both cases to\r\ncurry favour with the Catholics, and so to diminish Cecil’s power. As\r\nusual the Secretary’s opposition was an indirect one. His spies had kept\r\nhim informed of the old Spanish Bishop’s continued correspondence with\r\nShan O’Neil; of his having received and encouraged foolish Arthur Pole\r\nin his treason, and having allowed English people, against the law, to\r\nattend the embassy mass; and he watched and waited for an opportunity to\r\ndemonstrate to the Catholics the powerlessness of both the Bishop and\r\nhis master. He had not to wait long. One evening at the beginning of\r\nJanuary 1563, as the light was failing, a knot of idle hangers-on of\r\nthe Bishop’s household were lounging at the great gate of Durham Place\r\nopening to the Strand. An Italian Protestant captain, in the service\r\nof the Vidame de Chartres, swaggered down the street on his way to\r\nWhitehall, and from the Bishop’s gateway a lad shot a harquebuss at him,\r\nand missed him. The captain whipped out his long rapier and pursued the\r\nwould-be murderer to the outer courtyard. The Bishop’s servants closed\r\nthe gates against the pursuers, and the assassin ran up shouting to the\r\ndoor of the chamber where the Ambassador was playing cards with the\r\nFrench Ambassador and a Guisan hostage, Nantouillet, Provost of Paris. A\r\nfew hurried words of explanation at the door—for the Guisan had paid the\r\nboy to do the act—and the assassin was hurried down to the water gate,\r\nwhere a boat was in waiting, and he was allowed to escape, whilst his\r\npursuers were thundering at the solid gates of the inner court.\r\n\r\nThis was enough for Cecil. New locks were put on the house gates, and the\r\nkeys held by the “heretic English gatekeeper.” The Bishop could obtain no\r\ninterview with the Queen, but was obliged to see Cecil instead. Send me\r\nto jail, he indignantly pleaded, if I have offended; but if nothing is\r\nproved against me, as nothing can be, at least let me have free ingress\r\nand egress from my own house. Cecil’s reply was a long indictment of the\r\nBishop’s whole proceedings. The Ambassador, he said, was by the Queen’s\r\nkindness living in one of her houses, which had been turned into a hotbed\r\nof conspiracies against her and a refuge for malefactors. The law of the\r\nland had been openly defied, and the Queen desired the Ambassador to quit\r\nher house. In vain the Bishop protested. One indignity after another was\r\nplaced upon him. The folks going to mass in the embassy were haled off\r\nto prison as they came out; all the most private conversations between\r\nthe Ambassador and the English rebels were repeated to him by Cecil;\r\nhe was confronted with the text of his most secret despatches; he was\r\nturned out of Durham House with ignominy, and all he could do was to weep\r\ntears of rage, and pray Philip to avenge him.[177] But Philip’s hands\r\nwere more than full in the Netherlands now, as Cecil knew, for before\r\nthe writing-table in the Secretary’s room in Cecil House[178] there\r\nstood a portrait of Count Egmont,[179] and Gresham’s agents in Antwerp,\r\nBruges, and Brussels left no event unreported. The blow to the Spanish\r\nAmbassador was cleverly planned by Cecil. That the former had been\r\nfutilely plotting, was known, and it served as a good pretext for his\r\ndisgrace; but the real reason for it was the need to prove to Dudley and\r\nhis friends, and to the discontented Catholics, that they were leaning\r\non a broken reed when they depended upon Spain to help them against the\r\nSecretary. The bankrupt, heartbroken old Bishop was a good object-lesson.\r\nIf his master could not pay his debts or defend him from deliberate\r\nindignity, much less could he help discontented Englishmen who only had\r\ntheir own ends to serve.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the Bishop’s disgrace, and also partly\r\nexplaining it, another important move was made. The second Parliament\r\nof Elizabeth was opened on the 12th January 1563 by the Queen herself,\r\nin great state. The speech of Lord Keeper Bacon dwelt at length on the\r\nwant of order and discipline in the Anglican Church, the incompetency of\r\nmany of the ministers, and the want of uniformity in the services.[180]\r\nCecil himself was offered and refused the Speakership, but to him\r\nhas been attributed the authorship of the harangue which the Speaker\r\n(Williams) addressed to the Queen.[181] The decay of schools and the\r\npoverty of benefices through lay impropriations is dwelt on at length in\r\nthis speech, and the completion of the reform of religion and learning\r\nin the Queen’s dominions advocated. Cecil followed this with a speech\r\ndenouncing the Queen’s enemies, the Guises and the Catholics, supported\r\nby the countenance of Spain. The penalties for refusing the oath of\r\nsupremacy were greatly increased, the oath was rendered obligatory upon\r\nevery person holding any sort of office, and other acts for insuring the\r\nprogress of Protestantism were made,[182] as well as large subsidies\r\ngranted. The Catholic lords, even the Lord Treasurer (Winchester),\r\nwere uneasy and apprehensive; but they dared not move, for Cecil and\r\nthe Protestants had now a firm grasp of affairs, and the Secretary\r\nwas vehement in Parliament in favour of the proposed ecclesiastical\r\nmeasures. The Queen’s embarrassments, he said, arose entirely from her\r\ndetermination to resist the authority of the Pope, who had bribed Spain,\r\nthe Austrian and German princes. She now stood alone, with the Catholic\r\nworld against her, but he exhorted all faithful subjects to defend her\r\nwith laws, life, and property.[183] At the same time, as the Parliament\r\nwas sitting, Convocation assembled to settle the ritual and doctrine of\r\nthe Church. The articles were reformed and altered to thirty-nine, the\r\ncatechism and the homilies were adopted, and other measures tending to\r\nuniformity of doctrine were agreed upon, but in a way which, although it\r\ndid not satisfy the Puritan minority, was intended to include as large a\r\nnumber as possible of those who were not irreconcilably pledged to the\r\nRoman faith.\r\n\r\nCecil’s hand can be traced clearly in all these activities, for they\r\nstruck indirectly at his enemies; but a bolder step in the same direction\r\ntaken by Parliament itself can only be surmised as being prompted by\r\nhim. Dudley had for months been gaining friends for the candidature of\r\nthe Earl of Huntingdon as heir to the crown, whilst the Catholics were\r\ndivided on the claims of Mary Stuart and Darnley. Cecil was determined,\r\nif possible, to prevent the success of either of them, and desired to\r\nadhere to the Parliamentary title of Lady Catharine[184] (Countess of\r\nHertford). The House of Commons was mainly Protestant, and under the\r\ninfluence of Cecil; and it was agreed that deputations of both Houses\r\nshould petition the Queen either to fix the succession or else to marry,\r\nthe latter alternative being probably added out of politeness. The Queen\r\nreceived the deputations very ungraciously. She turned her back on the\r\nCommons, and for a long time sent no answer at all. On an address being\r\npresented to the Council begging them to remind her, she sent an answer\r\nby Cecil and Rogers to the effect that “she doubted not the grave heads\r\nof this House did right well consider that she forgot not the suit of\r\nthis House for the succession, the matter being so weighty; nor could\r\nforget it; but she willed the young heads to take example of their\r\nelders.” To the Lords she was more outspoken. She asked them whether they\r\nthought what they saw on her face were wrinkles. They were nothing of the\r\nsort, but pockmarks, and she was not so old yet that she had lost hope\r\nof having children of her own to succeed her.[185] This was a rebuff to\r\nCecil’s policy; but only what might have been expected from the Queen,\r\nwhose principal care was to sustain herself without concerning herself\r\ngreatly as to what came after her; whereas the Secretary was doubtless\r\nthinking of what would become of himself and the Protestant party if she\r\ndied. For Mary Stuart, and even her Protestant Councillors, he knew,\r\nwere busy intriguing for the succession, and her claims were powerfully\r\nsupported, even in England.\r\n\r\nMaitland of Lethington came to London during the sitting of Parliament to\r\nforward his mistress’s claims. He found Cecil now against the solution\r\nwhich he had formerly favoured, namely, the abandonment of Mary’s\r\npresent claims in exchange for the reversion, failing Elizabeth and her\r\ndescendants. Cecil was more distrustful of the French than ever; for the\r\ndefection of Condé had turned all arms against the English in Havre, and\r\nhe knew that Cardinal Lorraine was still untiring in his planning of the\r\nAustrian match for Mary, whilst the Protestants of France and Germany\r\nwatched unmoved the isolation and embarrassment of England. Maitland\r\ntherefore soon persuaded himself that his mistress had not much more\r\nto hope for now from the dominant party in England than from Elizabeth\r\nherself. Mary was convinced that both Catharine de Medici and the English\r\nQueen wished to force her into an unworthy Protestant marriage with a\r\nsubject, in order to injure her prestige with English Catholics and\r\ndecrease the power of the Guises.[186] Maitland consequently cast his\r\neyes to another quarter. Mary was determined to fight for the English\r\nsuccession, if she could not get it by fair means; and with this end\r\nshe wanted a consort strong enough to force her claims, which her\r\nuncle’s candidate, the Archduke Charles, could not do. She and Maitland\r\naccordingly threw over the Guises, who did not wish their niece to marry\r\na prince strong enough to exclude _them_, and boldly proposed a marriage\r\nwith Philip’s heir, Don Carlos. Maitland went one night secretly to the\r\nBishop of Aquila in London, and cautiously opened the negotiation. The\r\nQueen of Scots, he said, was determined never to marry a Protestant,\r\neven if he owned half the world, nor would she accept a husband from the\r\nhands of the Queen of England. The French and English Queens were almost\r\nequally against her, the Duke of Guise was dead, the Archduke Charles was\r\nnot strong enough to help her; would Philip consent to a marriage with\r\nhis son?\r\n\r\nWhilst this matter was being discussed by Maitland and the Bishop and\r\nthe Spanish partisans in England, the news of the untoward adventure of\r\nMary Stuart with Chastelard arrived in London. Mary said it was a plot\r\nof the Queen-mother to discredit her; but the old Bishop was no less\r\nanxious than before to urge his master to seize such an opportunity as\r\nthat offered by the proposed marriage. But Philip was slow. His hands\r\nwere full and his coffers were empty as usual, and whilst he was asking\r\nfor pledges and guarantees from the Scots and the English Catholics, the\r\nopportunity passed. Philip, in appearance at all events, accepted the\r\nsuggestion, in alarm lest a refusal might lead to a marriage between\r\nMary and the boy-King of France; for, as he says, “I well bear in mind\r\nthe anxiety I underwent from King Francis when he was married to this\r\nQueen, and I am sure that if he had lived we could not have avoided war,\r\non the ground of my protection of the Queen of England, whose country he\r\nwould have invaded.”[187] But whilst Philip was pondering—and it must be\r\nconceded that this time he had much reason for hesitation—others were\r\nacting. When Lethington came back from France, on his way through London\r\nto Scotland, he saw the Spanish Bishop again. He found that matters had\r\nnot progressed, and was disheartened. Elizabeth threatened his mistress\r\nwith her undying enmity if she married a member of the House of Austria,\r\nand Cecil persuaded him that the Queen might yet appoint Mary her heir if\r\nshe married to her liking. Lady Margaret, also, was now ostentatiously\r\nfavoured by the Queen, and Maitland returned to Scotland convinced that\r\nit would be unsafe to look elsewhere than to England for support, and\r\nthat, after all, the best solution of his country’s difficulties would\r\nbe the marriage of Mary and Darnley under Elizabeth’s patronage. This\r\ncertainly was the impression that the English Government wished him to\r\nconvey, for whilst it lasted it would check more ambitious schemes which\r\nwould be dangerous to England.\r\n\r\nSo far Cecil’s policy, though often thwarted by the Queen’s waywardness\r\nand Dudley’s ambition, had been in the main successful. The French had\r\nbeen kept out of Scotland, the Catholics in England had been divided and\r\ndiscouraged, whilst waverers were conciliated; the Anglican Church was\r\nmore firmly established, and Philip had been kept more or less friendly,\r\nout of fear of a league of Protestants on the one hand and of French\r\ninfluence in England on the other. Nor was the indefatigable Secretary’s\r\neffort confined to foreign affairs. The strengthening of the Queen’s\r\nnavy and the building of merchantmen continued without intermission.\r\nCamden says that in consequence of this activity there were now (1562)\r\n20,000 fighting men ready for sea service alone. All the fortresses\r\nwere put into order for defence, and the shortcomings of material and\r\nsystem demonstrated in the Scottish campaign were remedied. The ample\r\ncorrespondence on these points in the Hatfield Papers are all endorsed,\r\nannotated, or drafted in Sir William Cecil’s own hand, and no detail\r\nseems to have escaped him.[188]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his frequent illness, as recorded in his journals, his\r\nwork must have been incessant. In addition to his vast administrative\r\nduties, he had, on Sir Thomas Parry’s death, been appointed to the\r\nimportant post of Master of the Court of Wards, which assumed the\r\nguardianship of the estates of minors; and Camden speaks of him as\r\n“managing this place, as he did all his others, very providentially for\r\nthe service of his prince and the wards, for his own profit moderately,\r\nand for the benefit of his followers and retainers, yet without offence,\r\nand with great commendations for his integrity.” His interest, too, in\r\nthe universities, and particularly that of Cambridge, was constant. He\r\nhad been appointed Chancellor of the University in the first year of\r\nElizabeth’s reign, and had worked manfully to introduce order and reform\r\ninto the institution.[189] In June 1562, Cecil endeavoured to resign his\r\nChancellorship, his pretexts being his unfitness for the post, his want\r\nof leisure, and the serious contentions which existed in the University;\r\nbut the real reason was that which he cited last, namely, the tendency\r\nto laxity with regard to uniform worship manifested by a large number of\r\nthe masters and students. “Lastly,” he says, “which most of all I lament,\r\nI cannot find such care in the heads of houses there to supply my lack\r\nas I hoped for, to the ruling of inordinate youth, to the observation\r\nof good order, and increase of learning and knowledge of God. For I\r\nsee that if the wiser sort that have authority will not join earnestly\r\ntogether to overrule the licentious part of youth in breaking orders, and\r\nthe stubbornness of others that malign and deprave the ecclesiastical\r\norders established by law in this realm, I shall shortly hear no good or\r\ncomfortable report from thence. And to keep an office of authority by\r\nwhich these disorders may be remedied, and not to use it, is to betray\r\nthe safety of the same, whereof I have some conscience.… And so I end,\r\npraying you all to accept this, my perplexed writing and complaint,\r\nto proceed of a careful mind that I bear to that honourable and dear\r\nUniversity; whereof, although I was once but a simple, small, unlearned,\r\nlow member, I love,” &c., &c. Only on the promise of complete amendment\r\non the part of heads of houses, and at the intercession of Archbishop\r\nParker, Sir William withdrew his resignation and continued his labours in\r\nfavour of the University.[190]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of the following year (1564) the Queen in her progress\r\nwas splendidly entertained at the University. Upon Cecil as Chancellor,\r\nas well as Secretary of State, fell the responsibility of making the\r\narrangements; and the letters which relate to the visit, as usual exhibit\r\nhis perfect mastery of detail. From the avoidance of contagion of plague\r\n(which had devastated London in the previous year) to the supply of\r\nlodgings for the visitors, everything seems to have been settled with\r\nhim. He was specially anxious, he said, that the University he loved\r\nshould make a good figure before the Queen; he himself would lodge “with\r\nmy olde nurse in St. John’s College,” but the rest of the University\r\nwas to be turned inside out for the entertainment of the court. The\r\nchoristers’ school was made into a buttery, the pantry and ewery were at\r\nKing’s, Gonville and Caius was sacred to the Maids of Honour, rushes\r\nstrewed the roadways, the houses were hung with arras; the scholars\r\nwere drilled to kneel as the Queen passed and cry _Vivat Regina_, “and\r\nafter that quietly and orderly to depart home to their colleges, and in\r\nno wise to come to the court.” Sir William Cecil with his wife arrived\r\nthe day before the Queen (4th August 1564). “I am in great anxiety,” he\r\nwrote a few days previously, “for the well-doing of things there; and\r\nI find myself much troubled with other business, and with an unhappy\r\ngrief in my foote.” But notwithstanding his gout, he was received with\r\ngreat ceremony and a Latin oration, and was presented with two pairs of\r\ngloves, a marchpain, and two sugar loaves. His great anxiety, expressed\r\nto the authorities, was that “uniformity should be shown in apparel and\r\nreligion, and especially in the setting of the communion table.”\r\n\r\nOf the endless orations, the presents, and pedantry with which the\r\nQueen was received, of her own coyness about her Latin, of the solemn\r\ndisputations and entertainments, this is no place to speak; but the\r\nofficial accounts[191] represent the Queen as being agreeably surprised\r\nat her reception. After the first service at King’s she “thanked God\r\nthat had sent her to this University, where she, altogether against her\r\nexpectation, was so received that she thought could not be better.”\r\nThis was the first day; but a Catholic friend of the new Spanish\r\nAmbassador[192] told him that the Queen’s commendations had so elated the\r\nauthorities that they besought her to witness one more entertainment.\r\nAs she was unable to delay her departure, the actors followed her to\r\nthe first stopping-place, where the proposed comedy was represented\r\nbefore her. “The actors came in,” writes Guzman, “dressed as some of the\r\nimprisoned bishops. First came the Bishop of London (_i.e._ Bonner),\r\ncarrying a lamb in his hands as if he were eating it, … and then others\r\nwith different devices, one being in the figure of a dog with the\r\nHost in his mouth. They write that the Queen was so angry that she at\r\nonce entered her chamber, using strong language, and the men who held\r\nthe torches, it being night, left them in the dark, and so ended this\r\nthoughtless and scandalous representation.”[193]\r\n\r\nAmongst the long list of honorary Masters of Arts made on the occasion,\r\nSir William Cecil was one, and on the journey to Cambridge he was\r\nhonoured for the first of many times with a visit from the Queen to his\r\nhouse at Waltham, Theobalds,[194] which at this time was a small house he\r\nhad recently built as a country retreat, not so remote as Burghley, or so\r\nnear town as Wimbledon. It was his intention, even then, to leave this\r\nestate to his younger son; but, as will be shown later, it was not meant\r\nto be the magnificent place it afterwards became. The Queen’s frequent\r\nvisits, says his household biographer, forced him “to enlarge it, rather\r\nfor the Queen and her great train, and to set the poor in order, than\r\nfor pomp or glory, for he ever said it would be too big for the small\r\nliving he could leave his son. He greatly delighted in making gardens,\r\nfountains, and walks; which at Theobalds were perfected most costly,\r\nbeautifully, and pleasantly, where one might walk two miles in the walk\r\nbefore he came to the end.”[195] We are told that throughout the year at\r\nTheobalds, even in his absence, Cecil kept an establishment of twenty-six\r\nto thirty persons, at a cost of £12 a week. Every day twenty to thirty\r\npoor people were relieved at the gates, and “the weekly charge of setting\r\nthe poor to work there, weeding, labouring in the gardens, &c., was £10”;\r\nwhilst for many years 20s. every week was paid to the Vicar of Cheshunt,\r\nin which parish Theobalds stands, for the succour of the distressed\r\nparishioners.\r\n\r\nCecil was simple and sober in his own living and attire, but by his\r\nevery act he demonstrates his ambition to be well regarded by the world,\r\nand his determination to fulfil what he considered decorous in a great\r\npersonage who owed a duty to his ancestry, to his position, and to\r\nthose who should inherit his honours. His letter of advice to the Earl\r\nof Bedford when the latter was appointed governor of Berwick (1564)\r\nsets forth in a few words his ideal of a _grand seigneur_, which might\r\nrepresent a portrait of himself. “Think of some great nobleman whom you\r\ncan take as your pattern.… Weigh well what comes before you. Let your\r\nhousehold be an example of order. Allow no excess of apparel, no disputes\r\non Princes’ affairs at table. Be hospitable, but avoid excess. Be\r\nimpartial and easy of access. Do not favour lawyers without honesty.… Try\r\nto make country gentlemen agree: take their sons as your servants, and\r\ntrain them in warlike and manly exercises, such as artillery, wrestling,\r\n&c.”\r\n\r\nThe picture which Cecil presents of his own mind in his writings is\r\nconsistently that of a judicious, cautious, acquisitive, and intensely\r\nproud and self-conscious man; a man eminently fair, especially to his\r\ninferiors, to whom it would be undignified to be otherwise; not wanting\r\nin courage, but by temperament more inclined to reduce an enemy’s\r\nstronghold by sap and mine than by a storming attack; determined that\r\nhe would stand, no matter who might fall, and yet not greedy or selfish\r\nfor personal gratification; his mind monopolised by two main ideas, the\r\ngreatness and prosperity of England, and the decorous dignity of his own\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nTo attribute to him modern ideas with regard to liberty, as we now\r\nunderstand it, would be absurd. He was a man of great enlightenment, a\r\nlover of learning; but he was a statesman of his own age, not of ours.\r\nThat England should be governed by nobles, and that he should help the\r\nQueen to guide the governors, was in the divine order of things. He would\r\ndo, and did, according to his lights, the best he could for all men; but\r\nthat the ordinary citizen should claim a voice in deciding what was best\r\nfor himself would have appeared to Cecil Utopian nonsense to be punished\r\nas treason. He would be rigidly just, charitable, and forbearing to\r\nall; but if any but those on the same plane as himself should dream of\r\nclaiming rights of equality, then impious blasphemy could hardly be too\r\nstrong a term to apply to such insolence. With opinions such as those\r\nhe undoubtedly held respecting the exclusive right of an aristocracy\r\nto govern, his own position would have been inconsistent if he had not\r\nclaimed, as he did with almost suspicious vehemence, to belong by birth\r\nand descent to an ancient and noble race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n1564-1566\r\n\r\n\r\nThe efforts that had been made by the English Council to benefit native\r\ncommerce had caused much apprehension amongst the Flemish merchants, who\r\nhad for many years practically monopolised the English export trade.\r\nThe English Company of Merchant-Adventurers had agitated and petitioned\r\nthe Queen and Council to discountenance the foreign merchants; and as a\r\nresult, a series of enactments was passed which gave considerable trade\r\nadvantages to Englishmen. Differential duties, compulsory priority given\r\nto English bottoms for the export trade, the imposition of harassing\r\ndisabilities and penalties on foreign merchants established in London,\r\ntogether with the great increase of piracy owing to the extensive\r\nshipbuilding of recent years in England, had greatly disorganised Flemish\r\ntrade. During 1563 and early in 1564, several envoys had been sent from\r\nSpanish Flanders to endeavour to obtain a reversal of the new commercial\r\npolicy, but without effect. This caused reprisals on the part of the\r\nSpanish Government, which prohibited the introduction of English cloth\r\ninto Flanders and the exportation of raw material from Flanders to\r\nEngland, as well as the employment of English ships for Flemish exports.\r\nIn retaliation, a more stringent order was issued in England forbidding\r\ntrade with Flanders altogether, and the establishment of a new staple at\r\nEmbden. The seizure of English goods and subjects in Spain itself was\r\nthe answer to this. Naturally, people on both sides suffered severely\r\nby this commercial warfare.[196] Emissaries went backwards and forwards\r\nbetween Flanders and England, partial relaxations were temporarily\r\narranged, conferences were held; but the main difficulty continued until\r\nAntwerp was well-nigh ruined, and the Spaniards were obliged to humble\r\nthemselves in order to prevent a commercial catastrophe. The day, indeed,\r\nhad gone by now for hectoring England. The old Bishop of Aquila had died\r\nbankrupt, abandoned, and broken-hearted—Cecil’s object-lesson of the\r\nimpotence of Spain—and a very different Ambassador had been sent, whose\r\nmain duty it was to keep Elizabeth friendly, and to end, at almost any\r\ncost, the commercial war which was ruining Flanders.\r\n\r\nGuzman de Silva arrived in London in June 1564. He was amiable and\r\ncourtly, flattered the Queen to the top of her bent, and was soon a prime\r\nfavourite. At his first interview at Richmond she showed off her Latin\r\nand Italian, coyly led the talk to her personal appearance, blushingly\r\nhinted at love and marriage in general, Cecil being all the while close\r\nto her side.[197] As soon as the compliments and embraces were ended\r\nand Guzman was alone, a great friend of Dudley’s sought him out with\r\na message from the favourite, informing him “of the great enmity that\r\nexists between Cecil and Lord Robert, even before this book about the\r\nsuccession was published; but now very much more, as he believes Cecil\r\nto be the author of the book; and the Queen is extremely angry about it,\r\nalthough she signifies that there are so many accomplices in the offence\r\nthat they must overlook it, and has begun to slacken in the matter.[198]\r\nThe person has asked me with great secrecy to take an opportunity of\r\nspeaking to the Queen (or to make such an opportunity), to urge her\r\nwithout fail to adopt strong measures in this business; because if Cecil\r\nwere out of the way, the affairs of your Majesty would be more favourably\r\ndealt with, and religious questions as well; for this Cecil and his\r\nfriends are those who persecute the Catholics and dislike your Majesty,\r\nwhereas the other man (_i.e._ Dudley) is looked upon as faithful, and\r\nthe rest of the Catholics so consider him, and have adopted him as\r\ntheir weapon. If the Queen would consent to disgrace Cecil, it would\r\nbe a great good to them, and this man tried to persuade me to make use\r\nof Robert.”[199] Guzman was cautious, for he knew what had happened to\r\nhis predecessor; but this will show that Dudley was determined to stick\r\nat nothing to destroy, if possible, the man who, almost alone, was the\r\nobstacle to his ambition. He was liberal in his professions and promises\r\nto the Spaniard, whom he urged to ask for audience as much as possible\r\nthrough him, instead of through Cecil. His friends assured Guzman that\r\nhe still expected to marry the Queen, and had an understanding with the\r\nPope; that the Catholic religion would be restored in England if the\r\nmarriage were brought about, and much more to the same effect.[200]\r\n\r\nThe reason for this new move on the part of Dudley is not very far\r\nto seek. The defection of Condé and the collapse of the Protestants\r\nin France had been seized upon by Cardinal Lorraine and the dominant\r\nCatholics to force Catharine de Medici into a renewal of the negotiations\r\nfor a league with Philip to extirpate Protestantism. Already the meeting\r\nhad been arranged between Catharine and her daughter, the Queen of Spain,\r\nat Bayonne, which was to cement the close alliance. Catholicism was\r\neverywhere in the ascendant, and the clouds appeared to be gathering over\r\nEngland; for there was no combination so threatening for her as this.\r\nHitherto Cecil had always counted upon the jealousy between France and\r\nSpain to prevent the domination of England by either power; but with the\r\nFrench Protestants prostrate and a close union between a Guisan France\r\nand Catholic Spain, all safeguards would disappear, and Mary Stuart would\r\nbe able to count upon the support of the whole Catholic world, in which\r\ncase the position of Elizabeth and the Anglican Church was, indeed, a\r\ncritical one.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Dudley cared nothing for all this, even if he was able\r\nto appreciate its gravity. If he could only force or cajole the Queen\r\nto marry him, the religion of England might be anything his supporters\r\nchose. He knew well that Cecil, with his broad and moderate views,\r\nwould try to conjure away the danger and disarm Catholic Spain, whilst\r\nsafeguarding religion, by again bringing forward the Archduke with some\r\nsort of compact founded on the Lutheran compromise in Germany. But Spain\r\nand the Catholics, though they might have accepted such a solution,\r\nwere not enthusiastic about it; and Dudley, by going the whole length\r\nand promising Spain everything, thought to outbid Cecil and spoil the\r\nArchduke’s chance, whilst diverting Spanish support from Mary Stuart to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1563 the Duke of Wurtemburg, at the prompting of the\r\nEnglish agent, had approached the Emperor to propose a renewal of the\r\nArchduke’s negotiation. Ferdinand was cool: nominally the first monarch\r\nin Christendom, and a son of the proud House of Austria, he did not\r\nrelish being taken up and dropped again as often as suited English\r\npolitics, and he demanded all sorts of assurances before he would act.\r\nThe Duke of Wurtemburg secretly sent an agent to see Cecil early in 1564\r\nwithout the Emperor’s knowledge, and satisfied himself that Elizabeth was\r\nneither a Calvinist nor a Zwinglian, and would accept the confession of\r\nAugsburg. This was satisfactory; but before anything more could be done,\r\nFerdinand died (July 1564). When he conveyed the news to Cecil, Mundt,\r\nthe English agent, proposed that he should be allowed to reopen the\r\nquestion of marriage with the new Emperor Maximilian, through the Duke of\r\nWurtemburg. “He” (Mundt) “knows,” he says, “that the Queen is so modest\r\nand virtuous that she will not do anything that shall seem like seeking\r\na husband. But as the matter is most vital to the whole Christian world,\r\nhe thinks that Cecil should not be restrained by any narrow and untimely\r\nmodesty; for he, holding the administration of the kingdom, ought to\r\nstrive to preserve the tranquillity thereof by insuring a perpetual\r\nsuccession.”\r\n\r\nCecil and Mundt understood each other thoroughly; but the Secretary’s\r\nanswer was intended for the eyes of others, and was cautious. “With\r\nregard to her Majesty’s inclinations on the subject of her marriage,\r\nhe can with certainty say nothing; than that he perceives that she\r\nwould rather marry a foreign than a native prince, and that the more\r\ndistinguished the suitor is by birth, power, and personal attractions,\r\nthe better hope he will have of success. Moreover, he cannot deny that\r\nthe nobleman who, with them, excites considerable expectation, to wit\r\nLord Robert, is worthy to become the husband of the Queen. The fact of\r\nhis being her Majesty’s subject, however, will prove a serious objection\r\nto him in her estimation. Nevertheless, his virtues and his excellent and\r\nheroic gifts of mind and body have so endeared him to the Queen, that\r\nshe could not regard her own brother with greater affection. From which\r\nthey who do not know the Queen intimately, conjecture that he will be\r\nher future husband. He, however, sees and understands that she merely\r\ntakes delight in his virtues and rare qualities, and that nothing is more\r\ndiscussed in their conversation than that which is most consistent with\r\nvirtue, and furthest removed from all unworthy sentiments.” It is not\r\nsurprising that Cecil has endorsed the draft of this letter, “written to\r\nMr. Mundt by the Queen’s command.”\r\n\r\nMundt worked hard, but there were many obstacles in the way. Wurtemburg\r\nwas in no hurry. The mourning for the late Emperor, and the plague which\r\nraged in Germany, delayed matters for months. Once in the interval Cecil\r\nwrote to ask Mundt whether it was true that the Archduke’s neck was awry.\r\nMundt could not deny the impeachment, but softened it like a courtier.\r\n“Alexander the Great had his neck bent towards the left side; would\r\nthat our man may be his imitator in magnanimity and bravery. His body\r\nis elegant and middle size, more well grown and robust than the Spanish\r\nPrince.”[201]\r\n\r\nIn the autumn Elizabeth sent an envoy to condole with the new Emperor\r\non the death of his father, and simultaneously lost no opportunity of\r\ndrawing closer to Spain. She coquetted with Guzman, ostentatiously in\r\nthe face of the French Ambassador. She spoke sentimentally of old times,\r\nwhen her brother-in-law Philip was in England. She was curious to know\r\nwhether Don Carlos was grown, and manly; and then apparently to force\r\nthe Ambassador’s hand, she sighed that every one disdained her, and that\r\nshe heard Don Carlos was to marry the Queen of Scots. Guzman earnestly\r\nsaid that the Prince had been ill, and that such a thing was quite out\r\nof the question; which was perfectly true. The Queen’s real object then\r\ncame out. “Why,” she said, “the gossips in London were saying that the\r\nAmbassador had been sent by the King of Spain to offer his son Don Carlos\r\nto me!” All this rather undignified courting of Spain succeeded very soon\r\nin arousing the jealousy of France, as it was intended to do.\r\n\r\nDe Foix, the French Ambassador, had kept Catharine de Medici well\r\ninformed of affairs in England. Catharine was already getting alarmed at\r\nbeing bound hand and foot to the Guises, the Catholics, and Philip. The\r\nplan of marrying Mary Stuart to Don Carlos, or his cousin, the Archduke,\r\nand the rallying of Leicester to Spain and the Catholics, threatened\r\nto dwarf the influence of France, and make Spain irresistible. So the\r\nQueen-mother began to hint to Sir Thomas Smith, the Ambassador, that a\r\nmarriage would be desirable between her son Charles IX., aged fifteen,\r\nand Queen Elizabeth, aged thirty-one. Some such suggestion had been made\r\nby Condé to Smith during the negotiations which preceded the evacuation\r\nof Havre, but it had not been regarded seriously. It was probably no more\r\nserious now, but it was the trump card of both Queens, and it served its\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the plot of Leicester and the Catholics against Cecil\r\nwent on. The English Catholics came to Guzman, and represented to\r\nhim that it would be better not to come to any arrangement with the\r\nGovernment about the commercial question, in order that public discontent\r\nin England might ripen and an overturn of the present regime be made\r\nthe easier. But the Flemings were suffering even more than the English\r\nfrom the interruption of trade, and Guzman had strict orders to obtain\r\na settlement of the dispute. So he told the Catholics that the Queen\r\nhad been obliged to hold her hand, and refrain from punishing Cecil and\r\nBacon, until she had come to an understanding with Philip, and with the\r\nEnglish Catholics, through him. She would cling to Cecil and his gang,\r\nsaid Guzman, so long as she thought she had anything to fear from Spain.\r\n“All people think that the only remedy for the religious trouble is to\r\nget these people turned out of power, as they are the mainstay of the\r\nheretics, Lord Robert having the Catholics all on his side.”[202] Dudley\r\nwas flattered and encouraged with messages and promises from Philip, and\r\nlaboured incessantly to get rid of Cecil, even for a short time.\r\n\r\nIn order, apparently, to forward Dudley’s chances of success as a suitor\r\nfor the hand of Mary Stuart, for which at this time Elizabeth pretended\r\nto be anxious, she created him Earl of Leicester and Baron Denbeigh, on\r\nMichaelmas day 1564. De Foix, the French Ambassador, intimated two days\r\npreviously his intention of being present at the splendid festivities\r\nwhich accompanied the ceremony. This was a good opportunity for Cecil\r\nto arouse suspicion of the new Earl, and distrust of the French. On\r\nthe 28th September, accordingly, the Secretary called upon Guzman, and\r\ntelling him that the French Ambassador would be present at the feast,\r\nhinted that Dudley was very friendly with the French; to which the\r\nSpaniard replied, that he had always understood that such was the case,\r\nand that Dudley’s father was known to be much attached to them. Then\r\n“Cecil told me that the Queen had commanded him to visit the Emperor with\r\nThrogmorton, and although he had done all in his power to excuse himself\r\nfrom the journey, he had not succeeded. I understand that the artfulness\r\nof his rivals has procured this commission for him, in order, in the\r\nmeantime, to put some one else in his place, which certainly would be a\r\ngood thing. His wife has petitioned the Queen to let her husband stay\r\nat home, as he is weak and delicate. They tell me that this has made\r\nthe business doubtful, and I do not know for certain what will be done;\r\nnor indeed is anything sure here from one hour to another, except the\r\nhatching of falsehoods, which always goes on.” Needless to say, Cecil had\r\nhis way and did not go.\r\n\r\nBefore many days had passed Leicester sent to Guzman disclaiming any\r\nparticular friendship with the French, “and said, after his own Queen,\r\nthere was no prince in the world whom he was so greatly obliged to serve\r\nas your Majesty, whose servant he had been, and to whom he owed his life\r\nand all he had.” De Foix, he said, had only been present at his feast,\r\nbecause he brought him the Order of St. Michael from the King of France,\r\nwhich he (Leicester) did not wish to accept. Guzman was rather tart about\r\nthe business, and reminded Leicester’s friend (Spinola) that on the same\r\nday that the Queen had invited him (Guzman) to supper, De Foix had dined\r\nwith her; and when Spinola hinted that Philip might send Leicester the\r\nGolden Fleece, Guzman was quite scandalised at the idea of conferring\r\nthe order on any one not a “publicly professed Catholic.” Altogether\r\nit is clear that the Queen’s and Cecil’s clever management was already\r\nsetting the French and Spanish by the ears; and when they could do that\r\nand make them rivals for England’s favour, she was safe.\r\n\r\nThe next day Guzman was entertained at dinner by Leicester, the Earl\r\nof Warwick, Cecil, and others being present; and the Secretary in the\r\ncourse of conversation assured the Spaniard that he was taking vigorous\r\nmeasures to suppress the depredations on shipping, and to restore as\r\nmuch as possible of the merchandise stolen. Already, indeed, Cecil’s\r\ndiplomacy was righting matters. An active correspondence was going on\r\nabout the Archduke’s match; the Queen assured Guzman that she had to\r\nconceal her real feelings about religion, but that God knew her heart;\r\nand even Cecil tried to soften the asperity of the Catholics towards\r\nhim. “Cecil,” writes Guzman to his King, “tells these heretical bishops\r\nto look after their clergy, as the Queen is determined to reform them\r\nin their customs, and even in their dress, as the diversity that exists\r\nin everything cannot be tolerated.[203] He directs that they should be\r\ncareful how they treat those of the old faith: to avoid calumniating them\r\nor persecuting or harrying them.” The result of this action was that\r\nin October 1564, Guzman could write: “I have advised previously that\r\nCecil’s favour had been wavering, but he knows how to please, and avoids\r\nsaying things the Queen does not wish to hear; and, above all, as I am\r\ntold, can flatter her, so he has kept his place, and things are now in\r\nthe same condition as formerly. Robert makes the best of it. The outward\r\ndemonstrations are fair, but the inner feelings the same as before. I do\r\nnot know how long they will last. They dissemble; but Cecil has more wit\r\nthan all of them. Their envy of him is very great.”[204]\r\n\r\nSir James Melvil, a Scotsman brought up in France, was directed to go\r\nto London in the autumn of 1564, to watch his mistress’s interests. To\r\nhim Elizabeth again suggested a marriage between Dudley and “her good\r\nsister”; and in reply to his remark that Mary thought that a conference\r\nbetween English and Scottish statesmen should discuss the question first,\r\nat which conference the Earl of Bedford and Lord Robert could represent\r\nEngland, Elizabeth told Melvil that he seemed to make a small account\r\nof Lord Robert. He should, she said, see him made a far greater Earl\r\nthan Bedford before he left court. When Dudley was on his knees, shortly\r\nafterwards, receiving the investiture of his Earldom, the Queen tickled\r\nhis neck, and asked Melvil what he thought of him. Melvil gave a courtly\r\nanswer, whereupon the Queen retorted that he liked that “long lad”\r\n(Darnley) better. Melvil scoffed at such an idea, but his main object in\r\ncoming to England was to intrigue for the “long lad’s” permission to go\r\nto Scotland. A few days after this, Leicester took Melvil in his barge\r\nfrom Hampton Court to London, and on the way asked him what Mary thought\r\nof the marriage with him, which Randolph had proposed to her. Melvil\r\nanswered coldly, as his mistress had instructed him to do. “Then he began\r\nto purge himself of so proud a pretence as to marry so great a Queen,\r\ndeclaring he did not esteem himself worthy to wipe her shoes; declaring\r\nthat the invention of that proposition of marriage proceeded from Mr.\r\nCecil, his secret enemy. For if I, says he, should have appeared desirous\r\nof that marriage, I should have offended both the Queens and lost their\r\nfavour.”[205]\r\n\r\nMelvil went back to Scotland with all manner of kind messages for his\r\nmistress; and Cecil especially was gracious to him, placing a fine gold\r\nchain around his neck as he bade him farewell. But when Mary asked her\r\nenvoy if he thought Elizabeth “meant truly towards her inwardly in\r\nher heart, as she appeared to do outwardly in her speech,” he replied\r\nthat in his judgment “there was neither plain dealing nor upright\r\nmeaning; but great dissimulation, emulation, envy, and fear lest her\r\nprincely qualities should chase her from the kingdom, as having already\r\nhindered her marriage with the Archduke. It appeared likewise to me,\r\nby her offering unto her, with great apparent earnestness, my Lord of\r\nLeicester.” Melvil says that Leicester’s humble and artful letters to\r\nMary, and the consequent kindness of the latter, aroused Elizabeth’s\r\nfear that after all Mary might marry her favourite, and caused her to\r\nconsent to Darnley’s visit to Scotland.[206] “Which licence,” he says,\r\n“was procured by means of Secretary Cecil, not that he was minded that\r\nany of the marriages should take effect, but with such shifts to hold\r\nthe Queen (Mary) unmarried as long as he could, persuading himself\r\nthat Lord Darnley durst not proceed in the marriage without consent of\r\nthe Queen of England first obtained.”[207] Cecil’s task was again an\r\nextremely difficult one. He had to keep up an appearance of leaning\r\nto the Catholics and the House of Austria, and encourage the idea of\r\nElizabeth’s marriage with the Archduke, in order to prevent the alliance\r\nof Mary Stuart with so powerful an interest; he was obliged to keep his\r\nown restive Protestant friends in hand; to counteract at every step the\r\nintrigues of Leicester against him, and to be ready at any moment to\r\ncause a diversion if Leicester’s suit to the Queen looked too serious to\r\nbe safe.\r\n\r\nThe replies and recommendations of the bishops to the Council’s circular,\r\nreferred to in a previous note (page 160), had caused much apprehension\r\namongst Catholics; and the Queen herself, as well as Cecil, assured\r\nGuzman that the bishops should do the Catholics no harm; whilst, on the\r\nother hand, Cecil’s Protestant friends were urging him to adopt strong\r\nmeasures to prevent the growth of the “Papists.” Cecil’s reply to one\r\nsuch recommendation shows that he was just as ready to wound Leicester\r\nunderhand as Leicester was him. “He replied that he was doing what he\r\ncould, but he did not know who was at the Queen’s ear to soften her so,\r\nand render her less zealous in this than she ought to be.”[208]\r\n\r\nCecil’s greatest difficulty, indeed, at this time, was from Leicester,\r\nwho had now quite enlisted Sir Nicholas Throgmorton against his former\r\nfriend. In order to enable Leicester with some decency to accept the\r\nOrder of St. Michael, Throgmorton suggested that the Queen might ask for\r\nanother Cross of the Order to be given to the Duke of Norfolk. When Cecil\r\nlearned this, he was obliged to remonstrate with the Queen, and point out\r\nhow undesirable it was in the present state of affairs to place two of\r\nher most powerful nobles under an obligation to France. At a time when\r\nCecil was straining every nerve to keep on good terms with the House\r\nof Austria, and conciliating the Catholics, in order to checkmate Mary\r\nStuart, Leicester had agents running backwards and forwards to France,\r\nin the hope of bringing forward in an official form the farcical offer\r\nof Charles IX.’s hand for the Queen, which offer he knew would come to\r\nnothing, whilst rendering abortive the Archduke’s suit, upon which Cecil\r\ndepended to so great an extent.\r\n\r\nThe dexterity and cleverness of Cecil under these circumstances is shown\r\nvery markedly in the manner in which he changed in a very few months\r\nthe opinion of the Spanish Ambassador about him, as soon as his policy\r\nrendered it necessary to gain his good opinion. “When I first arrived\r\nhere,” writes Guzman, January 2, 1565, “I imagined Secretary Cecil … to\r\nbe very different from what I have found him in your Majesty’s affairs.\r\nHe is well disposed towards them, truthful, lucid, modest, and just; and\r\nalthough he is zealous in serving his Queen, which is one of his best\r\ntraits, yet he is amenable to reason. He knows the French, and, like an\r\nEnglishman, is their enemy. He assured me on his oath … that the French\r\nhave always made great efforts to attract to their country the Flanders\r\ntrade (_i.e._ with England). With regard to his religion I say nothing,\r\nexcept that I wish he were a Catholic … but he is straightforward, and\r\nshows himself well affected towards your Majesty … for he alone it is who\r\nmakes or mars business here.”[209]\r\n\r\nHaving thus gained the good-will of the Spaniard, Cecil was soon able\r\nto persuade him that the Queen would never really marry Leicester, and\r\nthe relations between the latter and the Spaniards became cooler. The\r\nQueen herself could not do enough to show her kindness to Guzman, and at\r\njoust, tournament, and ball, chatted with him in preference to the French\r\nAmbassador. By January 1565, Leicester, seeing that Cecil’s diplomacy had\r\ngained the good-will of Spain, and that the Catholics were turning to the\r\nside of the Archduke, unblushingly veered round to the French interest.\r\n\r\nGuzman was obliged then to write that he was not at all satisfied with\r\nhim. He wished, he said, to please everybody; but was getting very\r\nfriendly with the French, who were making much of him. But there was more\r\neven than this. The Queen and Cecil were trying their best to please\r\nthe Catholics. The Queen openly and rudely rebuked Dean Nowell at his\r\nsermon on Ash Wednesday for attacking Catholic practices; whilst Cecil\r\nwas pushing the Vestments Order to the very verge of safety. Some of\r\nthe bishops invited him to a conference, and remonstrated with him on\r\nthe severity of the new regulations, which they openly stigmatised as\r\npapistical. He told them sternly that the Queen’s order must be obeyed,\r\nor worse would befall them. The churchmen of the Geneva school railed and\r\nresisted, as far as they might,[210] what they called the Secretary’s\r\nbacksliding; whilst Leicester, ever willing to change sides, if he could\r\nonly checkmate Cecil, vigorously took the part of the Puritans, and did\r\nhis best to hamper the execution of the Vestments Order, and to prevent\r\nthe use of the cross on the altars.[211]\r\n\r\nIn February 1565, De Foix, the French Ambassador, shot the bolt that\r\nhad long been forging. He saw Elizabeth in her presence-chamber, and,\r\nafter much exaggerated compliment, read a letter of Catharine de Medici,\r\nsaying she would be the happiest of mothers if her dearly beloved sister\r\nQueen Elizabeth would marry her son, and become a daughter to her. “She\r\nwould find in the young King,” she said, “both bodily and mentally, that\r\nwhich would please her.” This was very sweet incense to Elizabeth, and\r\nshe sentimentally deplored that she was not ten years younger. De Foix\r\nflattered her, and tranquillised her fears that she would be neglected or\r\nabandoned, and the Queen agreed with him to keep the matter secret for\r\nthe present, and promised him a speedy reply.[212] As usual, Cecil drew\r\nup for the Queen’s guidance a judicial examination of the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages which might be expected from the marriage. He is careful in\r\nthis lucid document not to commit himself to an individual opinion,[213]\r\nbut the formidable list of objections far outweigh the advantages; and\r\nwhen the Queen the next day repeated Cecil’s arguments as her own, De\r\nFoix lost patience, hinted that his mistress had been deceived, and would\r\nwithdraw the offer.[214] Elizabeth petted the ruffled diplomatist into a\r\ngood humour again, and said she would send Cecil to talk the matter over\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nLeicester had been bribed heavily by the French, and pretended to be\r\nstrongly in favour of the match, which he knew would never take place,\r\nbut might choke off the Archduke. But with Cecil it was very different.\r\nHe had no objection to the French suit being talked about: that might\r\nmake Spain and the Austrians more tractable; but if it was allowed to go\r\ntoo far, the Emperor would take umbrage, and the Spaniards would balance\r\nmatters by marrying Mary Stuart to some nominee of their own. When,\r\nconsequently, Cecil saw De Foix, he was cool and argumentative, talked\r\nmuch of the difficulties of the match; and on De Foix suggesting that\r\nsuch a union with France would preserve England from danger, he replied\r\nthat England could defend herself, and had nothing to fear. By these\r\ntactics he avoided a direct negative, delayed and procrastinated, whilst\r\nhis agents were busy in Germany smoothing the way for the Archduke. The\r\nFrench matter was a strict secret, but the Queen could not avoid giving\r\nsome very broad hints about it to her friend Guzman. When he objected\r\nthat the young King would be a very little husband for her, she angled\r\ndexterously but ineffectually to extort an offer of marriage from Don\r\nCarlos. Catharine de Medici was just as eager as Elizabeth[215] that the\r\nnegotiations for the marriage with Charles IX. should not be dropped,\r\nfor she was getting seriously afraid now of the Catholic combination into\r\nwhich she had been drawn, and industriously plied Smith with arguments\r\nin favour of the match. But Smith knew as well as Cecil himself that the\r\nwhole matter was a feint, and dexterously avoided giving a favourable\r\nopinion. The Huguenots, however, were in deadly earnest about it, and\r\nElizabeth and Catharine contrived to carry on the farce intermittently\r\nuntil eventually Charles IX. was betrothed to a daughter of the Emperor.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was barely off with the old love than Adam Swetkowitz, Baron\r\nMitterburg, came on behalf of the new. Ostensibly his mission was to\r\nreturn the late Emperor’s insignia of the Garter, but really every step\r\nto be taken by him had been previously agreed upon through Throgmorton,\r\nRoger Le Strange, Baron Preyner, Mundt, and the Duke of Wurtemburg. The\r\nSpanish Ambassador, however, had been studiously kept in the dark until\r\nshortly before Swetkowitz’s arrival, and was not in a hurry to pledge\r\nhis master in the Archduke’s favour, until he learned what arrangements\r\nhad been made about religion. On the contrary, he first approached\r\nLeicester, who was ill in consequence of an accident, and secretly urged\r\nhim to press his suit before the Emperor’s envoy appeared. Leicester was\r\ndoubtful, but still not quite without hope. When Swetkowitz actually\r\narrived, Leicester understood that the current was too powerful for him\r\nto oppose at first, and he became strongly and ostentatiously in favour\r\nof the Austrian match. Swetkowitz first saw the Queen at the beginning of\r\nJune. Her people, she said, were urging her to marry, and she was anxious\r\nto hear whether the King of Spain would favour the Archduke’s suit for\r\nher hand. This Swetkowitz could not tell her; and he was referred to\r\nCecil for further discussion of details.\r\n\r\nThe conditions as laid down by Cecil[216] were prudent and moderate, but\r\ncertainly not likely to commend themselves to the King of Spain, or even\r\nto the Emperor; for no power was to be given to the Consort, and the\r\nquestion of religion was jealously safeguarded. It is evident that the\r\nGerman thought that Leicester might be made instrumental in modifying\r\nthese conditions. He writes to the Emperor, “Since the principal promoter\r\nof this transaction will be the illustrious Earl of Leicester, who is\r\nmost devoted to the Archduke, and is loved by the Queen with a sincere\r\nand most chaste and honest love, I think your Majesty and the Archduke\r\nwould aid the business by addressing fraternal letters to the Earl.”[217]\r\nBut Leicester’s momentary adhesion to the policy of Cecil, Sussex,\r\nand Norfolk, was only for the purpose of deceiving the Secretary, and\r\nputting him off his guard. Whilst Cecil was proceeding in good faith\r\nwith Swetkowitz, and the latter, a Lutheran, was just as earnest in his\r\nefforts to bring about the marriage, both the Queen and Leicester were\r\nplaying a double game. Probably Elizabeth’s marriage with her favourite\r\nwas never nearer than at this juncture, when she was carrying on a\r\nserious negotiation with the Austrian, and was still making an appearance\r\nof dallying with De Foix. The circumstances, indeed, were for the moment\r\nall in favour of Leicester. Guzman was very cool about the Archduke and\r\nthe Lutheran envoy. The Queen was for ever trying to ascertain Philip’s\r\nfeeling about the Archduke, and at the same time dragging Leicester’s\r\nname into her complicated conversational puzzles with the Spaniard. The\r\nlatter on one occasion, disbelieving her sincerity about the Archduke,\r\nurged her to marry his friend Leicester, if she married a subject; and\r\nonly a day or two afterwards De Foix, who had by this time lost all hope\r\nof success for Charles IX., and wished to checkmate the Austrian, also\r\nwent and pleaded Leicester’s suit. The Earl, thus having the good word\r\nboth of the Spanish and French Ambassadors, could afford to grow cool on\r\nthe Austrian match.[218] Cecil, and Sussex particularly, were scandalised\r\nand apprehensive at this new instance of Leicester’s falseness, and\r\nlaboured desperately to bring the Archduke to England to force the\r\nQueen’s hand. But the Emperor was slow and doubtful about the religious\r\nconditions, and would not risk a loss of dignity.\r\n\r\nMatters thus dragged on month after month, whilst Leicester’s chances\r\nlooked brighter and brighter. Among the principal reasons for the rising\r\nhopes of Leicester were the events which had happened in Scotland during\r\nthe previous few months. After much apparent hesitation, Elizabeth\r\nhad in February granted to Darnley permission to join his father in\r\nScotland for three months. A few weeks later a messenger came from Mary\r\nStuart to the Spanish Ambassador in London, asking him whether he had\r\nany reply to send to her. Guzman was cautious, for he did not quite know\r\nthe meaning of this; but said he would speak to Maitland of Lethington,\r\nwho was then on the way to London from the Border. Simultaneously with\r\nthis, Lady Margaret Lennox also approached Guzman. “She told me the kind\r\ntreatment her son had received at the hands of the Queen of Scots, and\r\nthat the French Ambassador had sent to her secretly offering all his\r\nsupport for the marriage of her son. But she knows the French way of\r\ndealing … and repeats that she and her children have no other refuge\r\nbut your Majesty (Philip), and begs me to address your Majesty in their\r\nfavour, in case the Queen of Scotland should choose to negotiate about\r\nher son, Darnley, or in the event of the death of this Queen, that they\r\nmay look to your Majesty.” When Maitland arrived in London in April,\r\nhe saw Guzman in secret, and after some fencing and feigned ignorance,\r\noffered his mistress’s adhesion and submission to Spain. His mistress,\r\nhe said, had waited for Philip’s answer about Don Carlos for two years,\r\nbut had now listened to some proposals for a marriage with Darnley, as\r\nneither Elizabeth nor her own subjects wished her to marry a foreigner.\r\nBut before concluding the affair she wished to know if there was still\r\nany hope of her obtaining Don Carlos, in which case she still preferred\r\nthat alliance. Guzman replied that, as Cardinal Lorraine had gone so far\r\nin his negotiations for the marriage with the Archduke Charles, Philip\r\nhad abandoned all idea of opposing him by bringing forward his own son\r\nCarlos. Maitland assured him that the negotiations of Cardinal Lorraine\r\nwere carried on against Mary’s wish, and in the interests of France;\r\nbut Guzman knew now that the match with Don Carlos was hopeless, and\r\nsaid so. Maitland then spoke of the Darnley marriage, which, however, he\r\nfeared would be very dangerous if Elizabeth took it badly. All would be\r\nwell, he said, if the King of Spain would take Mary and Darnley under\r\nhis protection; but beyond bland banalities he could get nothing from\r\nGuzman.[219]\r\n\r\nDarnley’s demeanour in Scotland, and Mary’s behaviour towards him,\r\ntogether with the rising hopes of the Catholics there, had alarmed Murray\r\nand his friends; and Elizabeth and her Council were now also alive to\r\ntheir danger. Cecil drew up one of his pro and contra reports with regard\r\nto the influence that such a marriage would have on England,[220] which\r\nwas submitted to the Council, and a unanimous condemnation of the match\r\nwas adopted, and Throgmorton was sent in May post-haste to Scotland to\r\ndissuade Mary from taking a step so threatening to Elizabeth. Randolph’s\r\nletters to Cecil at the time showed that the danger was a real one.\r\nDarnley, he says, is a furious fool, and Mary was infatuated with him.\r\nTo the Pope, to Philip, to Cardinal de Granvelle, and to Guzman, Mary\r\nmade no secret that her object was to unite the Catholics and claim the\r\ncrown of England; and Lady Margaret had from the first admitted that this\r\nwas her aim in promoting the marriage of her son. When Elizabeth’s eyes\r\nwere opened to the imminence of the peril, she did what she could to\r\nstay the match. She, De Foix, and Throgmorton again pressed Leicester’s\r\nmarriage with Mary, Murray and his Protestant friends were encouraged to\r\nresist, Lady Margaret was placed under arrest in the Tower, Darnley was\r\nordered to return to England, and the Queen promised Maitland that if\r\nhis mistress would marry to her liking she would acknowledge her right\r\nof succession to the English crown. Meanwhile rumours came thickly from\r\nScotland that Mary was already married, Philip promised all his support\r\nto Mary and Darnley if they would be his faithful servants, Murray and\r\nLethington were thrust into the background, Rizzio was ever at Mary’s\r\nside, and her foolish young English lover, hated and contemned for his\r\narrogance, urged his infatuated bride to the religious intolerance that\r\nled to her ruin.[221]\r\n\r\nThe remonstrances of Throgmorton and Randolph, and the letters of\r\nthe Queen and Cecil, were as powerless to move Mary now as was the\r\nthreatening attitude of her nobles and people, for she had decided to\r\ndepend entirely upon Philip, and to defy the Queen of England. In July, a\r\nfew days before her marriage, she sent a special messenger to Guzman with\r\nletters for Philip, “begging for help and favour against the Queen of\r\nEngland, who has raised her subjects against her, to force her to forsake\r\nthe Catholic religion.”[222] Murray, Argyll, and the Hamiltons, she says,\r\nare in revolt, and if aid do not come from Spain she will be lost.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary’s marriage was known for certain in London, the Archduke’s\r\nsuit was being laboriously discussed; but almost immediately afterwards,\r\nthe renewed hopes of Leicester already referred to were noticed. It was\r\nfelt that, now that Mary’s marriage to a subject had taken place, one of\r\nElizabeth’s principal reasons for contracting an alliance with a son of\r\nthe House of Austria disappeared, and a precedent had been set for her\r\nmarriage with a man not belonging to a sovereign house.\r\n\r\nSwetkowitz therefore found that he had to encounter all manner of new\r\nconditions and demands from the Queen, which drove him to despair, and\r\nGuzman looked upon the Austrian’s chance as a very poor one indeed. The\r\nEarl of Sussex and Cecil did their best to keep the matter afoot, whilst\r\nLeicester and Throgmorton openly proclaimed the hollowness of the whole\r\nnegotiation. The old Earl of Arundel asked Guzman to dinner at Nonsuch\r\nearly in August, apparently for the purpose of dissociating the English\r\nCatholics from the intrigues of both parties. He assured the Spaniard\r\n“that the men who surrounded the Queen did not wish her to marry. I said\r\nit was quite possible that some of them who thought they might get the\r\nprize for themselves might wish to hinder it; but as for Secretary Cecil,\r\nI thought that his disagreement with Robert (Leicester) might well lead\r\nhim to support the Archduke, if it were not for the question of religion.\r\nHe (Arundel) told me not to believe that Cecil wanted the Queen to marry.\r\nHe was ambitious and fond of ruling, and liked everything to pass through\r\nhis hands, and if the Queen had a husband he would have to obey him.”\r\nThis view of the matter is not improbable; but it is certain that Cecil,\r\nin any case, would resist to the last the marriage of the Queen with\r\nLeicester, under the patronage of either France or Spain. Such a marriage\r\nwould have imperilled the results of his strenuous labour, and would\r\nhave thrown England back into the slough from which the Queen and he had\r\nrescued it.\r\n\r\nWhen Leicester’s star was seen to be in the ascendant, and the Archduke’s\r\nchance waned, Cecil and his friends once more revived the suit of the\r\nKing of Sweden. Splendid presents of sables and valuable plate came to\r\nthe Queen and her court; and Eric’s romantic sister Cecilia, Margravine\r\nof Baden, again made ready for her much-desired visit to England, where\r\nshe arrived early in September. At the water-gate of Durham House, where\r\nshe lodged as the Queen’s guest, Leicester’s opponents were assembled in\r\nforce to bid her welcome. The Countess of Sussex, Lady Bacon, Lady Cecil,\r\nand Cecil himself, all did honour to the Swedish King’s sister, and\r\nElizabeth was overwhelming in her cordiality for the first royal visitor\r\nshe had entertained since her accession; but the Princess wore out her\r\nwelcome, and nothing came of her visit, though it served its purpose of\r\nagain spoiling the appearance of Leicester’s chances for a time.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, English money and men were supporting Murray and the\r\nProtestant Lords against Mary and Darnley, who were sending emissaries\r\nto the Pope, to Cardinal Lorraine, to Flanders, and to Philip, begging\r\nfor help for the faith. When Elizabeth was remonstrated with by Guzman,\r\nDe Foix, and Mauvissière, for helping rebels against their Queen, and\r\nfor her harsh treatment of Lady Margaret, she replied that she had been\r\nshamefully deceived, but what she was doing was to endeavour to rescue\r\nMary from the hands of her enemies, into which she had fallen, and she\r\nblamed Darnley and his Catholic friends more than Mary. The same excuse,\r\nsaid Guzman, which she used when she helped the French rebel Huguenots.\r\nAt the end of September a special meeting of the full Council was held,\r\nat which Cecil set forth the position with regard to Scotland, and the\r\npolicy it was proposed to adopt. He pointed out the many reasons that\r\nexisted for distrusting the French, who were very busy in Scottish\r\naffairs since Mary’s marriage;[223] and he told the Council that Mary had\r\nsent Darnley’s secretary, Yaxley,[224] to beg aid of Philip, in addition\r\nto the letters sent through Guzman, and to the Pope. The interference of\r\nthe Catholic powers in Scotland, he said, was a menace to England; and it\r\nwas decided that all preparations should be made for war upon the Border,\r\nas a measure of precaution, whilst an embassy was sent from England to\r\nendeavour to effect a reconciliation between Mary and the Protestant\r\nLords.\r\n\r\nBefore any decided steps could be taken, however, Murray retired into\r\nEngland, and arrived in London on the 22nd October. The Queen affected\r\nanger, and received him sternly in the presence of her Council and of\r\nthe French Ambassador. Murray was dressed in deep mourning, and entered\r\nhumbly. Kneeling, he addressed the Queen in Scots. She told him to speak\r\nin French, which he said he understood but imperfectly. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, she addressed to him a long harangue in French, for the edification\r\nof De Foix and Mauvissière. “God preserve her,” she said, “from helping\r\nrebels, especially against one whom she had regarded as a sister.” She\r\nunderstood that their rising was in consequence of the Queen’s marriage\r\nwithout the consent of Parliament, and of fear that their religious\r\nliberty would be infringed. But if she thought he, Murray, had planned\r\nanything against his sovereign, she would at once arrest and punish him.\r\nMurray justified himself, and threw himself upon her generosity, and\r\nElizabeth replied that she would refer the whole matter to her Council.\r\nAll this scene was for the purpose of putting herself right with France\r\nand Spain, and had been arranged on the previous night, when Murray was\r\ncloseted with the Queen and Cecil. Cecil’s own minute of the interview\r\nagrees closely with that of Guzman, just quoted. “Her Majesty asked him\r\n(Murray), in the presence of several persons, if he had ever undertaken\r\nanything against the person of his Queen. He denied it firmly and\r\nsolemnly, saying, if it might be proved that he was either consenting\r\nor privy to any such intent, he besought her Majesty to cause his head\r\nto be struck off and sent to Scotland … he testified before God that in\r\nall his counsels he had no other meaning but principally the honour of\r\nAlmighty God, by conserving the state of His religion in Scotland.… And,\r\nto conclude, her Majesty spoke very roundly to him … that she would by\r\nher actions let it appear that she would not for the price of a world\r\nmaintain any subject in disobedience against his prince.”[225]\r\n\r\nCecil’s characteristic policy is plainly seen in the Queen’s treatment\r\nof Murray. He invariably endeavoured to keep Elizabeth legally in the\r\nright, and usually with success. But still Murray and the Scottish\r\nProtestants were now his main instruments for preventing the danger\r\napproaching England over the Scottish Border. The old national lines of\r\ndivision had grown fainter with the international league of Catholics\r\nfacing a league of Protestants. Mary Stuart had definitely thrown in her\r\nlot with the former, in the hope of satisfying her ambition;[226] and the\r\nScottish spectre was perhaps more threatening to England at this moment\r\nthan ever it had been before. The obvious course was that which Cecil\r\nfollowed—namely, to avoid an excuse for a national war or for foreign\r\ninterference, and to encourage the Scottish Protestants to stand for the\r\nliberties they had won; whilst assuming as indisputable that they were\r\nnot in arms against their sovereign, but against their enemies and hers,\r\nwho had interposed between the Queen and her loving subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n1566-1567\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the spring of 1566 the unfortunate Mary Stuart hurried to her\r\ndestruction. Her dislike of her husband increased as Bothwell obtained\r\nmore influence over her; all prudence with regard to the overt favouring\r\nof Catholicism was cast aside, Murray and the “rebels” were sternly\r\nforbidden to return to Scotland, and the breach between Mary and “her\r\ngood sister” grew wider every day. Nor is this to be wondered at.\r\nRandolph was busy in supporting the Protestants, and had been warned away\r\nfrom Mary’s court. His letters to Cecil are full of dread foreboding\r\nof disaster to come, foreboding which most historians interpret as\r\nforeknowledge. Cecil’s enemies have sought industriously to connect him\r\nwith the sanguinary scenes which were shortly afterwards enacted in\r\nScotland; but they have always reasoned from the information contained\r\nin Randolph’s letters to him, which in no case can be considered as\r\nevidence against him. That he was aware before Rizzio’s murder that some\r\nsort of plot existed,[227] and that Murray and his friends were parties\r\nto it, is certain; but that he himself had any share in its concoction,\r\nso far as the killing of Rizzio is concerned, has never been proved, and\r\nis most improbable.[228] As has been seen, his remedy for the Scottish\r\ndanger was not murder; for so far-seeing a man must have known that the\r\nkilling of a favourite secretary could not divert Mary from the league of\r\nCatholic sovereigns, or alter her policy towards England whilst Huntly,\r\nBothwell, and Athol were at her side, and papal emissaries in her close\r\nconfidence. The killing of Rizzio satisfied Darnley’s spite, and served\r\nMurray’s and Argyll’s personal ends, but was more likely to injure than\r\nbenefit English national objects.\r\n\r\nWhat Cecil was personally doing during the first three months of 1566\r\nwas to strengthen the Protestant party in Scotland by money and promises\r\nof support,[229] whilst dividing the Catholic sovereigns upon whom Mary\r\nStuart depended, by working desperately to bring the Archduke’s match to\r\na successful issue. With him now, in addition to the Earl of Sussex, were\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk, the Earl of Arundel, and many others who usually\r\nleant to the Catholic side; for Leicester was openly under French\r\ninfluence, always suspicious in the eyes of old-fashioned Englishmen, and\r\nnow more than ever distrusted, for Cardinal Lorraine’s agents were around\r\nMary, and the Guisan Rambouillet was carrying the Order of St. Michael to\r\nDarnley, with loving messages to the Queen of Scots.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of January 1566, Cecil and other Councillors went to\r\nGuzman’s house to discuss the eternal question of the trade regulations\r\nand the suppression of piracy. When their conference was finished, Cecil\r\ntook the Ambassador aside and urgently besought him to use his great\r\ninfluence with the Queen in favour of the Archduke’s suit. The next day\r\nthe request was pressed even more warmly by Sussex, who told Guzman that\r\nthe majority of the Council had decided to address a joint note on the\r\nsubject to the Queen. The Spaniard was not enthusiastic, for he did not\r\nwish to break entirely with Leicester in view of possibilities; but on\r\nthe 2nd February he broached the subject to the Queen and discussed it\r\nat length. She was, as usual, diplomatic and shifty; but whenever she\r\nwas uncomfortably pressed, began to talk of her marriage with Leicester\r\nas a possibility; and two days afterwards Guzman saw her walking in the\r\ngallery at Whitehall with Leicester, who, she said, was just persuading\r\nher to marry him, “as she would do if he were a king’s son.” People\r\nthought, she continued, that it was Leicester’s fault she was unmarried,\r\nand it had made him so unpopular that he would have to leave court.\r\n\r\nAlmost daily Cecil or Sussex urged the Ambassador to favour the Archduke\r\nwith the Queen, and were untiring in their attempts to induce the\r\nArchduke himself to come to England, in the hope of forcing the Queen’s\r\nhand. As a means to the same end they continued to sow jealousy between\r\nthe Catholic sovereigns. “Cecil tells me,” writes Guzman (2nd March),\r\n“that so great and constant are the attempts of the French to hinder\r\nthis marriage, and to perturb the peace and friendship between your\r\nMajesty and this country, that they leave no stone unturned with that\r\nobject. They are gaining over Lord Robert with gifts and favours, and\r\nare even doing the same with Throgmorton. It is true that Cecil is not\r\nfriendly with them, but I think he tells me the truth with regard to\r\nit.”[230] Again, when Sir Robert Melvil, who had come from Mary to pray\r\nElizabeth to release Lady Margaret, was leaving London on his return,\r\nCecil begged him to see Guzman before his departure, “as no person had\r\ndone so much as he had to bring about concord between the two Queens,\r\nand he (Cecil) thought that if the differences could be referred to him\r\n(Guzman) for arbitration, they might easily be settled.” Guzman thought\r\nso too, and wrote by Melvil to Mary to that effect, advising her to\r\nabandon arrogant pretensions, and accept such honourable terms as should\r\nsatisfy Elizabeth;[231] and, as a preliminary, he exhorted her to live\r\non good terms with her husband. Before Melvil left Cecil, the latter\r\ntold him that they had news of Rizzio’s murder (this was written on the\r\n18th March), and at the same time there came a messenger from Murray,\r\nsaying that he had returned into Scotland (from Newcastle) on a letter\r\nof assurance from Darnley. The Earl of Murray had entered Edinburgh in\r\ntriumph the day after the murder, and the Queen and Darnley had together\r\nstarted for Dunbar.\r\n\r\nAnother opportunity for Cecil to breed dissensions between Spain and\r\nFrance came when the news arrived of Pero Melendez’s massacre of the\r\nFrench settlement in Florida, on the ground that the territory belonged\r\nto the King of Spain. The Queen professed herself to Guzman delighted at\r\nsuch good news; but was surprised that Florida was claimed by Spain, as\r\nshe always thought that the Frenchman Ribault had discovered it; indeed\r\nshe had seriously thought of conquering it herself. Guzman saw Cecil\r\nwhen he left the Queen (30th March), and the Secretary had nothing but\r\nreprobation for Coligny, who had sent out the French Florida expedition.\r\n“He said your Majesty should proclaim your rights with regard to Florida,\r\nthat they might be known everywhere.” Cecil, shortly before this, whilst\r\ndiscussing the question of Hawkins’ voyages to Guinea and South America,\r\nsaid that he himself had been offered a share in the enterprise, but\r\nthat he did not care to have anything to do with such adventures. By\r\nall this it will be seen that Cecil’s strenuous efforts to combat the\r\nCatholic league, which might lend to Mary Stuart a united support against\r\nEngland, took the traditional form of drawing the House of Austria to the\r\nside of England, and causing jealousy between France and Spain. He knew\r\nthat in the long-run national antipathies were stronger than religious\r\naffinities, and that the Catholic league, which had been ineffectual\r\nafter the peace of Cateau-Cambresis (1559), could with time and industry\r\nbe broken again.[232]\r\n\r\nBut while Cecil approached Spain in order to divide her from France, he\r\nnever forgot that Philip was the champion of the Catholics throughout the\r\nworld, and kept his eyes on every movement which might forebode ill to\r\nEngland. His spies in Flanders were daily sending reports of the rumours\r\nthere of King Philip’s attitude towards the resistance of the Flemish\r\nnobles to the Inquisition; indeed, as Guzman writes to his master (29th\r\nApril): “These people have intelligence from everywhere, and are watching\r\nreligious affairs closely; but it is difficult to understand what they\r\nare about, and with whom they correspond, as Cecil does it all himself,\r\nand does not trust even his own secretary.”[233]\r\n\r\nCecil might well be vigilant, for Mary Stuart’s plots went on\r\nunceasingly.[234] Sir Robert Melvil arrived in London in May, again\r\nto discuss the question of the succession, and to ask Elizabeth to\r\nstand sponsor for Mary’s expected child; but, greatly to Elizabeth’s\r\nindignation, he brought amiable letters from the Scottish Queen to the\r\nEarl of Northumberland and other English Catholic nobles; and whilst he\r\nwas in London, an emissary from Mary Stuart to the Pope passed through on\r\nhis return to Scotland with 20,000 crowns from the Pontiff, and a promise\r\nof 4000 crowns a month to pay a thousand soldiers for her (Mary’s)\r\ndefence. An envoy, too, of the rebel Shan O’Neil was at the same time\r\nlurking in Edinburgh, conferring with the Queen.\r\n\r\nAll this was known to Cecil and Elizabeth, and drove them ever nearer\r\nto Spain and to the Archduke’s match, Leicester himself, probably out\r\nof jealousy of Ormonde, who was vigorously flirting with the Queen, now\r\nopenly siding with the Austrian. Even Throgmorton was reconciled with\r\nCecil by the Earls of Pembroke and Leicester, who promised the Secretary\r\nthat Throgmorton should no longer thwart his policy.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd June, Sir James Melvil arrived with breakneck speed in London\r\nfrom Edinburgh, with news of the birth of Mary Stuart’s heir.[235] It was\r\nlate, but Sir Robert Melvil, the Ambassador, lost no time in conveying\r\nthe tidings to Cecil, whose own entry of the event in the Perpetual\r\nCalendar at Hatfield runs thus: “1566, 19 June, was borne James at\r\nEdinburgh inter horæ 10 et 11 matutino.” Cecil promised to keep the\r\nnews secret from the court until Mary’s own messenger could convey it\r\nofficially to the Queen. Elizabeth was at Greenwich at the time, and\r\nwhen Cecil arrived she was “in great mirth dancing after supper.” Cecil\r\napproached the Queen and whispered in her ear, and in a moment the\r\nsecret was out and all joy vanished. With a burst of envy, Elizabeth,\r\nalmost in tears, told her ladies that the Queen of Scots was mother of\r\na fair boy, whilst she, Elizabeth, was but a “barren stock.”[236] When\r\nthe Melvils saw her the next day she had recovered her composure, and\r\npromised to send Cecil to Scotland to be present at the christening,\r\nwhich embassy the Secretary with some difficulty evaded, “as there were\r\nso many suspicions on both sides.”[237]\r\n\r\nThe Queen had suffered a serious illness early in the summer, which, with\r\nthe anxiety of her position, had reduced her to a very low condition.\r\nIt was decided that a progress should be undertaken for her health, in\r\nwhich the University of Oxford could be visited, and Cecil be specially\r\nhonoured by a stay of the Queen at his house of Burghley. She left London\r\nin July, and underwent an ordeal at Oxford similar to that which she had\r\nexperienced two years before at Cambridge. The vestments controversy was\r\nraging with great bitterness, clergymen were deprived and punished for\r\ncontumacy, pulpit and press were silenced, and the Protestants resentful.\r\nCecil was firm, but diplomatic, and the Queen indignant that her laws\r\nshould be called into question. Under the circumstances it required great\r\ntact on both sides to avoid any untoward event during the Queen’s visit\r\nto Oxford, where the Puritan party was very strong. Leicester and Cecil\r\nwere both with the Queen, the former strongly favouring the Puritans, the\r\nlatter taking his stand on the Queen’s order for the discipline of the\r\nChurch. On the Queen’s reception, the Vice-Chancellor, Dr. Humphreys,\r\none of the leaders of the anti-vestment party, approached to kiss the\r\nQueen’s hand. “Mr. Doctor,” said the Queen, smiling, “that loose gown\r\nbecomes you mighty well; I wonder your notions should be so narrow.”\r\nOnce, during the speech of the public orator, tender ground was touched,\r\nbut the visit passed over without further embittering an already bitter\r\ncontroversy, and Leicester and Cecil, Puritan Knollys, Catholic Howard\r\nof Effingham, and many others received the honorary degree of Master of\r\nArts.[238]\r\n\r\nCecil’s own entries in his journal of the period are meagre enough:—\r\n\r\n“1566. June. Fulsharst, a foole, was suborned to speak slanderously of\r\nme at Greenwich to the Queen’s Majesty; for which he was committed to\r\nBridewell.\r\n\r\n“June 16. A discord inter Com. Sussex et Leicester at Greenwych, ther\r\nappeased by Her Majesty.\r\n\r\n“August 3. The Queen’s Majesty was at Colly Weston, in Northamptonshire.\r\n\r\n“August 5. The Queen’s Majesty at my house in Stamford.\r\n\r\n“August 31. The Queen in progress went from Woodstock to Oxford.”\r\n\r\nDuring the progress a disagreement between Cecil and Leicester took\r\nplace, as well as that mentioned between the latter and Sussex. The\r\ncommunications between the Earl and the French were constant, and had\r\ncaused much heart-burning. The existence of a strong and active party\r\nin the English court ostentatiously leaning to the French side, at a\r\ntime when Cecil’s whole policy depended upon keeping the good-will of\r\nSpain, hampered him at every turn, and he wrote a letter to Sir Thomas\r\nHoby, privately instructing him to give out in France that Leicester’s\r\ninfluence over the Queen had decreased, and that the French need not\r\ncourt him so much as they did. When the letter arrived, Hoby, the\r\nAmbassador, was dead, and it fell into other hands. Leicester heard of\r\nit, and taxed Cecil, who retorted angrily.\r\n\r\nEven in Cecil’s own house the intrigues against his policy continued. He\r\nhad sent Danett to the Emperor with the draft clauses of the proposed\r\nmarriage treaty with the Archduke, and the news from Vienna seemed to\r\nconfirm the best hopes of those who favoured the Austrian match. This,\r\nof course, did not suit Leicester. Vulcob, the nephew of the new French\r\nAmbassador, Bôchetel de la Forest, went to Stamford to carry his uncle’s\r\nexcuses for not coming earlier to see the Queen. As he was entering the\r\npresence-chamber at Burghley, Leicester stopped him, and began talking\r\nabout the marriage. He hardly knew what to think, he said, but he was\r\nsure that if the Queen ever did marry, she would choose no one but\r\nhimself for a husband. The Frenchman, no doubt, understood him. The\r\nArchduke’s match was getting too promising, and must be checked by the\r\nusual French move. So Vulcob took care when he saw the Queen to dwell\r\nmainly upon the attractive physical qualities of the young King Charles\r\nIX. Elizabeth was never tired of such a subject, and very soon the French\r\nAmbassador was warmly intriguing to bring forward his master’s suit\r\nagain, as a counterpoise to the Austrian hopes, but really in Leicester’s\r\ninterests, whilst presents and loving messages came thick and fast from\r\nFrance to Leicester and Throgmorton. The Emperor’s reply by Danett was,\r\nafter all, not so encouraging as Cecil and Sussex had been led to expect,\r\nand Leicester’s hopes rose higher than ever. During the Queen’s progress\r\nhe arranged with his friends a scheme which seemed as if it would stop\r\nthe Archduke’s chances for ever. Parliament was to meet in October,\r\nand the plan was to influence both Houses to press the Queen on the\r\nquestions of the succession and her marriage, “so that by this means the\r\nArchduke’s business may be upset … and then he (Leicester) may treat of\r\nhis own affair at his leisure.” It was clear that any attempt on the part\r\nof the Puritans and Leicester to force the Queen’s hands with regard to\r\nthe marriage whilst the delicate religious question was under discussion\r\nwith the Emperor, would put an end to the negotiations, and Cecil and\r\nhis friends strove their utmost to avoid such a result. They urged\r\nGuzman again to persuade the Queen to the match; the Duke of Norfolk\r\ncame purposely to court with the same object, and for once Cecil himself\r\nwas willing, in appearance, to place the religious question in the\r\nbackground. “Cecil,” writes Guzman, “desires this business so greatly,\r\nthat he does not speak about the religious point; but this may be deceit,\r\nas his wife is of a contrary opinion, and thinks that great trouble may\r\nbe caused to the peace of the country through it. She has great influence\r\nwith her husband, and no doubt discusses the matter with him; but she\r\nappears a much more furious heretic than he is.” Well might the Queen and\r\nCecil be apparently more anxious to sink religious differences than Lady\r\nCecil, for they probably knew how imminent the danger was better than she.\r\n\r\nThe Protestants in Flanders and Holland were in open revolt; and slow\r\nPhilip was collecting in Spain and Italy an overwhelming force by land\r\nand sea, with which he himself was to come as the avenger of his injured\r\nkingship, and crush the rising spirit of religious reform. If such an\r\narmy as his swept over and desolated his Netherlands, whither next might\r\nit turn? For six years Elizabeth had kept Spain from harming her, out\r\nof jealousy of France; but France was now more than half Guisan, and in\r\nfavour of Mary Stuart, and the Huguenots themselves had deserted England\r\nwhen she was fighting their battle at Havre. No help, then, could be\r\nexpected from France if Spain attacked Elizabeth for her “heresy”; and\r\nthe Queen and her wise minister were fain to conciliate a foe they\r\nwere not powerful enough to face in the open. Elizabeth went beyond\r\nthe Spaniard himself in her violent denunciation of the insurgents in\r\nthe Netherlands. Their only aim, she said, was liberty against God and\r\nprinces. They had neither reason, virtue, nor religion. She excused\r\nherself for having helped the French Huguenots, which she only did, she\r\nsaid, to recover Calais. If the Netherlands rebels came to her for help,\r\nshe would show them how dearly she held the interests of her good brother\r\nKing Philip; “and she cursed subjects who did not recognise the mercy\r\nthat God had shown them in sending them a prince so clement and humane\r\nas your Majesty.”[239] Cecil was not quite so extravagant as this, but\r\nhe missed no opportunity at so critical a juncture of drawing nearer to\r\nSpain, and was even more compliant than ever before on the vexed subject\r\nof the English right to trade in the Spanish Indies. “Cecil is well\r\ndisposed in this matter,” writes Guzman, “and I am not surprised that\r\nthe others are not, as they are interested. Cecil assures me that he has\r\nalways stood aloof from similar enterprises.”\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Leicester’s persistent efforts to hamper Cecil’s policy\r\nwere bearing fruit. With great difficulty Cecil persuaded the House of\r\nCommons to vote the supplies before the question of the succession was\r\ndealt with, but a free fight on the floor of the House preceded the vote.\r\nThe Queen was irritated beyond measure at the inopportune activity of the\r\nextreme party about the succession. Sussex, the Spanish Ambassador, and\r\nothers of Catholic leanings, pointed out to her that if she married the\r\nArchduke there would be an end of the trouble, and she need not then\r\nthink of any successor other than her own children. At length a joint\r\nmeeting of the two Houses adopted an address to the Queen, urging her\r\nto appoint a successor if she did not intend to marry. When the address\r\nwas presented, her rage passed all decency.[240] The Duke of Norfolk,\r\nher own kinsman, and the first subject of the realm, was insulted with\r\nvulgar abuse, which well-nigh reduced him to tears. Leicester, Pembroke,\r\nNorthampton, and Howard were railed at and scolded in turn; only once did\r\nshe soften somewhat towards Leicester. She had thought, she said, that\r\nif all the world had abandoned her, he would never do so. What do the\r\ndevils want? she asked Guzman. Oh! your Majesty, replied the Ambassador,\r\nwhat they want is liberty, and if monarchs do not combine against it,\r\nit is easy to see how it will all end. She would send the ungrateful\r\nfellow Leicester away, she said, and the Archduke might now be without\r\nsuspicion. Gradually, as she calmed, her diplomacy asserted itself, and\r\ncleverly, by alternations of threats and cajolery, she reduced Parliament\r\nto the required condition of invertebrate dependence upon her will.[241]\r\n\r\nAll this, we may be sure, did not decrease the ill-feeling in the court,\r\nwhich for the next six months became a hotbed of intrigue. On the one\r\nside were Norfolk, Sussex, the Conservatives, and the Catholics, aided\r\nby Guzman, and cautiously supported by Cecil and Bacon; whilst on the\r\nother, Leicester, Throgmorton, Pembroke, Knollys, and the Puritans,\r\nbacked by the French Ambassador, ceaselessly endeavoured to check the\r\nAustrian-Spanish friendship, and if possible, above all, to ruin Sussex\r\nand prevent his embassy to the Emperor. That Leicester would stick at no\r\ninconsistency is seen by the curious fact that, whilst he was nominally\r\nheading the Puritan party, he, according to Melvil, was strenuously\r\nfavouring the claims of the Queen of Scots to the succession. He assured\r\nElizabeth that this would be her best safeguard, or “Cecil would undo\r\nall,” the reason for this being that Cecil was known to be in favour of\r\nCatharine Grey.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th February 1567, Cecil sent word to his friend Guzman that he\r\nhad just received secret advice of the murder of Darnley, of which he\r\ngave some hasty particulars. The intelligence could hardly have come\r\nas a surprise to the Spaniard, for a month previously he had informed\r\nPhilip that some such act was contemplated. Within a few hours of the\r\nreception of the news in London, Leicester sent his brother, the Earl of\r\nWarwick, to Catharine Grey’s husband, to offer him his services in the\r\nmatter of the succession. Five days afterwards Sir James Melvil came with\r\nfull particulars of the foul deed at Kirk o’ Field, and at once rumour\r\nwas busy with the name of Mary Stuart as an accomplice in her husband’s\r\ndeath. Elizabeth expressed sorrow and compassion on the day she heard\r\nthe news, but rather doubtfully told Guzman “that she could not believe\r\nthat the Queen of Scots could be to blame for so dreadful a thing,\r\nnotwithstanding the murmurs of the people.” When Guzman, however, pointed\r\nout to her how dangerous it would be for the opposite party (Catharine\r\nGrey’s friends) to make capital out of the accusation, the Queen agreed\r\nthat it would be wise to discountenance it, and to keep friendly with\r\nMary Stuart, in order to prevent her from falling under French influence\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nIn a letter from Cecil to Norris (20th February) he says: “The Queen\r\nsent yesterday my Lady Howard and my wife to Lady Lennox, in the Tower,\r\nto open this matter to her, who could not by any means be kept from such\r\npassions of mind as the horribleness of the fact did require.… I hope\r\nher Majesty will show some favourable compassion of the said lady, whom\r\nany humane nature must needs pity.… The most suspicion that I can hear\r\nis of Earl Bothwell, yet I would not be thought the author of any such\r\nreport.”[242] Lady Margaret, in her agony of grief, made no scruple at\r\nfirst in accusing her daughter-in-law of complicity in the murder; but\r\nthe bereaved mother left the Tower on the following day, doubtless warned\r\nof the unwisdom of saying what she thought. At least, when she saw Sir\r\nJames Melvil she told him, “She did not believe that Mary had been a\r\nparty to the death of her son, but she could not help complaining of her\r\nbad treatment of him.” But whatever she might say, the spirits of the\r\nCatholic party in England sank to zero at the black cloud which hovered\r\nover their candidate. “Every day it becomes clearer that the Queen of\r\nScotland must take some step to prove that she had no hand in the death\r\nof her husband if she is to prosper in her claims to the succession\r\nhere,”[243] wrote Guzman. Fortunately this book is not the place in\r\nwhich to discuss the vexed question of Mary’s complicity in Darnley’s\r\ndeath, but her contemporaries both in England and Scotland, as well as\r\nabroad, certainly thought her guilty. Cecil, writing to Sir Henry Norris\r\nin March, mentions the suspicions against Bothwell, Balfour, &c., and\r\nsays, “There are words added, which I am loth to report, that touch the\r\nQueen of Scots, which I hold best to be suppressed. Further, such persons\r\nanointed are not to be thought ill of without manifest proof.”[244]\r\nAnd again, a few days afterwards, he says, “The Queen of Scots is not\r\nwell spoken of.” The entry of the event in Cecil’s journal makes no\r\nmention of Mary. It runs thus: “Feb. 9. The L. Darnley, K. of Scots, was\r\nkilled and murdered near Edenburgh;” and on the following day the news\r\nis amplified thus: “Feb. 10. _Hora secunda post mediam noctem Hen. Rex\r\nScotiæ interfectus fuit, per Jac Co. Bothwell, Jac Ormeston de Ormeston,\r\nHob Ormeston patrem dicti Jac Ormeston, Tho Hepbourn._”\r\n\r\nMorette, the Duke of Savoy’s special envoy to Scotland, had left\r\nEdinburgh the day after the murder, and on his way through London saw\r\nGuzman. The Queen of Scots had assured Morette that she would avenge\r\nher husband’s death, and punish the murderers, but he made no secret of\r\nhis belief that she had prior knowledge of the plan. Whilst Morette was\r\ndining with Guzman and the French Ambassador, a French messenger named\r\nClerivault arrived at the house, bringing a letter from Mary to the\r\nQueen of England, claiming her pity, and similar letters for Catharine\r\nde Medici, the Archbishop of Glasgow, and others,[245] denouncing\r\nthe crime.[246] Mary, indeed, lost no time in endeavouring to put\r\nherself right before the world. She offered rewards for the discovery\r\nof the murderers; but when all fingers are pointed at Bothwell and his\r\ncreatures, when public placards were posted in the capital accusing them\r\nand hinting at the Queen’s complicity, Mary still kept the principals\r\nat her side, and made no move against their subaltern instruments. In\r\nvain, for a time, the bereaved father Lennox demanded vengeance; in vain\r\nElizabeth, by Killigrew, sent indignant letters to Mary; in vain the\r\nCatholic Archbishop of Glasgow exhorted her to prove her own innocence by\r\npursuing the offenders without mercy. Bothwell stood ever by her side,\r\nand his clansmen cowed the murmuring citizens who looked with aversion\r\nnow upon their beautiful young Queen. At length, goaded to take some\r\naction by the danger of losing the Catholic support, upon which alone\r\nshe had depended, she held the sham trial in the Edinburgh Tolbooth two\r\nmonths after the crime. Lennox refused to attend the travesty of justice,\r\nand Bothwell was unanimously acquitted. Murray had left the court before\r\nthe murder, and fled to France when the result of the trial was known.\r\nBothwell, loaded with favours, insolent with success, seemed to hold\r\nScotland and the Queen in the hollow of his hand. The nobles were mostly\r\nbought or threatened into shameful compliance, and only the “preachers”\r\nand the townsfolk kept alive the growing horror of the Queen. No longer,\r\neven, did the humble peasant women hesitate, before Mary’s face, to make\r\ntheir loyal blessing conditional upon her innocence.[247] What was\r\nhorrified doubt before became indignant reprobation when, only three\r\nmonths after Darnley’s death, Mary married the hastily divorced Bothwell.\r\nThen came the hurried flight in disguise towards Dunbar, the gathering of\r\nthe nobles, the flight of Bothwell at Carbery Hill, and the conveyance of\r\nthe disgraced Queen to Edinburgh. When nothing but vows of defiance and\r\nvengeance against Bothwell’s enemies could be obtained from her, and it\r\nwas clear that the unfortunate woman was deaf to reason and decency, came\r\nthe crowning degradation of Lochleven, and Mary Stuart’s sun set to rise\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nTo a short life of turbulent pleasure succeeded twenty years of plotting\r\nagainst the peace and independence of England and the cause of religious\r\nliberty. During that twenty years Cecil and his mistress were pitted\r\nagainst one of the cleverest women in Europe, supported by all that was\r\ndiscontented in England and Scotland, and all that was distinctively\r\nCatholic abroad. In the critical position caused by the rising of the\r\nProtestant Lords against Bothwell and the Queen, Cecil’s view diverged\r\nsomewhat from that of Elizabeth. The latter was naturally first concerned\r\nat the want of respect shown on all sides to an anointed sovereign, which\r\nsubject was always a tender one with her; whereas the Secretary was still\r\nanxious, before all else, to exclude French influence from Scotland.\r\nWriting to Norris in France (26th June), he conveys the news of Mary’s\r\nrestraint, and at the same time encloses letters from Scotland recalling\r\nMurray (then at Lyons), “the sending of which letters requireth great\r\nhaste, whereof you must not make the Scottish Ambassador privy.[248]… The\r\nbest part of the (Scots) nobility hath confederated themselves to follow,\r\nby way of justice, the condemnation of Bothwell and his complices in the\r\nmurder of the King. Bothwell defends himself by the Queen’s maintenance\r\nand the Hamiltons, so he hath some party, though it be not great. The\r\n15th of this month he brought the Queen into the field with her power,\r\nwhich was so small, as he escaped himself without fighting and left\r\nthe Queen in the field; and she yielded herself to the Lords, flatly\r\ndenying to grant justice against Bothwell, so as they have restrained\r\nher in Lochleven until they come unto the end of their pursuit against\r\nBothwell.… Murray’s return into Scotland is much desired by them, and for\r\nthe weal both of England and Scotland I wish he were here. For his manner\r\nof returning and safety, I pray require Mr. Stewart to have good care.…\r\nThe French Ambassador, and Villeroy, who is there (in Scotland), pretend\r\nfavour to the Lords, with great offers; and it may be that they may do\r\nas much on the other side” (_i.e._ in France).[249] It was this last\r\npossibility which so much disturbed Cecil, and it was to avert it that\r\nMurray’s return was so ardently desired, for he was known always to be\r\nopposed to the French influence in his country. In August, after Murray\r\nhad returned to Scotland (visiting Elizabeth at Windsor on his way home\r\nat the end of July), Cecil wrote again to Norris: “You shall perceive\r\nby the Queen’s letter to you herewith how earnestly she is bent in the\r\nfavour of the Queen of Scots; and truly since the beginning she hath been\r\ngreatly offended with the Lords in this action;[250] yet no counsel\r\ncan stay her Majesty from manifesting of her misliking of them; _so as,\r\nindeed, I think thereby the French may, and will, easily catch them_,\r\nand make their present profit of them, to the damage of England. In this\r\nbehalf her Majesty had no small misliking of that book which you sent me\r\nwritten in French, whose (author’s) name yet I know not; but, howsoever,\r\nI think him of great wit and acquaintance in the affairs of the world. It\r\nis not in my power to procure any reward, and therefore you must so use\r\nthe matter as he neither be discouraged nor think unkindness in me.”[251]\r\n\r\nHow much Cecil dreaded renewed French interference in Scotland is seen at\r\nthis time by his ever-growing cordiality towards Spain. An acrimonious\r\ndiscussion was going on, both in London and in Paris, with regard to\r\nthe restoration of Calais to England, which was now due by the treaty\r\nof Cateau-Cambresis. Cecil and the Queen were both emphatic in their\r\ncondemnation of the Protestant risings in the Spanish Netherlands, though\r\nFrench agents kept whispering to Guzman that help was being sent thither\r\nby England. The union between Cecil and the Spaniard was nevertheless\r\ncloser than ever. The latter, in March, secretly told Cecil that the King\r\nof France was sending De Croc to Scotland,[252] and that there seemed to\r\nbe some mystery brewing in that quarter. The Secretary replied that he\r\nknew it; they had a plot to steal the Prince of Scotland and take him to\r\nFrance, but that steps had been taken to prevent such a thing. Guzman\r\nthereupon urged the Queen of England to have the infant Prince brought to\r\nEngland, Mary having told Killigrew that she was willing that this should\r\nbe done.[253] Indeed, at this time Cecil’s perseverance had quite won\r\nSpanish sympathy, and had widened the rift in the Catholic league, as was\r\nnecessary for England’s safety, Guzman being if anything more eager than\r\nCecil to checkmate the intrigues of the French in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe efforts on the other side were just as incessant to divide Spain from\r\nEngland, and more than once at this period caused temporary estrangement\r\nbetween them. In June a somewhat unexpected embassy came from the\r\nEmperor, with the object of asking Elizabeth for monetary aid against\r\nthe Turk. The principal Ambassador, Stolberg, was a Protestant, and the\r\nQueen immediately jumped at the incorrect conclusion that he had come\r\nto arrange for the wedding of the Archduke. Before even he arrived in\r\nLondon, Stolberg had been persuaded that a great Catholic league had\r\nbeen formed, including his own sovereign the Emperor, with the object\r\nof crushing Elizabeth and rooting out Protestantism from Europe; and\r\nwhen, at his formal reception at Richmond,[254] the Queen gave Stolberg\r\nan unfavourable reply to his request for aid against the Turk, Cecil\r\ntook Guzman, who accompanied him, aside and told him that the Queen and\r\nCouncil had learned the particulars of a league of the Catholic powers\r\nagainst Elizabeth and the Protestants,[255] in favour of the Queen of\r\nScots. The better to effect the object, he said, the Emperor had made\r\na disadvantageous truce with the Turk, whereat the English Council was\r\nmuch scandalised, and was determined to make all necessary preparations,\r\nthis being the reason why the Queen had answered the Ambassador so\r\nunfavourably.[256] Guzman was shocked that so sensible a person as Cecil\r\nshould believe such nonsense. Probably Cecil knew as well as Guzman\r\nthat the league was dead, so far as united action against England was\r\nconcerned; but such attempts as this, to serve French ends by arousing\r\njealousy between Spain and England, were constant, and occasionally, as\r\nin this instance, aroused some distrust on one side or the other.[257]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the detention of Mary Stuart was known by the French\r\nGovernment an attempt was made to gain Murray to the side of France, in\r\norder to obtain possession of the infant Prince. Murray delayed pledging\r\nhimself until he received the letters from the Lords and from Cecil,\r\nalready referred to. He then started with all haste for Scotland, taking\r\nLondon on the way. Whilst in London at the end of July he saw Guzman,\r\nand told him as a secret that he had not even communicated to Elizabeth,\r\nthat a letter existed which proved conclusively the guilt of his sister\r\nin the murder of her husband.[258] It was evident thus early that Murray,\r\nwhilst expressing sympathy for his sister, and deprecating generally\r\nany derogation of the dignity of a sovereign, was determined that Mary\r\nStuart should do no more harm to Protestantism or the relationship\r\nbetween Scotland and England, if he could help it. “He said he would do\r\nhis best to find some means by which she should remain Queen, but without\r\nsufficient liberty to do them any harm, or marry against the will of her\r\nCouncil and Parliament.”[259] It is evident, from a letter from Cecil to\r\nNorris, that Murray arranged with the former when in England to assume\r\nthe Regency of Scotland on his arrival, although not without misgiving on\r\nthe part of Elizabeth, even if she personally was a consenting party to\r\nthe arrangement. Murray, writing a friendly letter to Cecil early in 1568\r\n(Hatfield Papers), mentions that a report had reached him that Cecil had\r\nbeen told that he (Murray) was offended because Sir William in his first\r\nletter had not addressed him as Regent. Murray assures him that this was\r\nnot the case, and begs him not to allow any such thought to disturb their\r\nfriendship, “the amity of the two countries being the great object of\r\nboth … although the Queen, your mistress, outwardly seems not altogether\r\nto allow the present state here, yet I doubt not but her Highness in\r\nheart liketh it well enough.” Elizabeth was at the time divided between\r\ntwo feelings: that of indignation at any restraint being placed upon a\r\nsovereign by subjects, and the knowledge that the imprisonment of Mary\r\nmeant the disablement of the only individual whom England had to fear.\r\nCecil was fully alive to the latter fact, whilst the former was to him\r\nof quite secondary importance when compared with the national issues\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\nWhen the news came of Mary’s renunciation and the crowning of the infant\r\nJames, the Lords wrote to Elizabeth, saying that either she must protect\r\nthem, or they must accept a French alliance; and she was then obliged\r\nto prefer the interests of England to her reverence for the sacredness\r\nof a sovereign. Guzman thus tells the story: “The Queen told me she did\r\nnot know what was best to be done, and asked my opinion, pointing out to\r\nme the inexpediency of showing favour to so bad an example, and, on the\r\nother hand, the danger to her of a new alliance of these people with the\r\nFrench … I think I see more inclination on her part to aid them (the\r\nScots) than the case at present demands, as I gave her many reasons for\r\ndelay, whilst she still insisted that it was necessary to act at once.”\r\nThe next day (August 9) the tone of the Queen had somewhat changed. She\r\nwould, she said, recall Throgmorton from Scotland, as it was beneath her\r\ndignity to have an Ambassador accredited to a sovereign in duress,[260]\r\nand she would refuse her protection and aid to the Lords. The reason\r\nfor this perhaps was that “the letter she writes to Throgmorton is very\r\nshort. I have seen it, though I could not read it. It was in the hands\r\nof Lord Robert (_i.e._ Leicester), who dictated it, and he carried it to\r\nthe Queen for signature in my presence, _Cecil not being present_.”[261]\r\nCecil, indeed, at this juncture had to proceed with great caution, and,\r\nas usual, by indirect and devious ways. Leicester, Pembroke, and their\r\nfriends had now (August), as Guzman says, “no rivals, as Secretary Cecil\r\nproceeds respectfully, and the rest who might support him are absent. He\r\nknows well, however, that he is more diligent than they, and so keeps his\r\nfooting.”\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Catholics in England were allowed almost perfect\r\nimmunity, whilst, on the other hand, strong land and sea forces were\r\nmustered, as a counterbalance to the great army to be led into Flanders\r\nby Alba. The closest friendship existed between the Spaniards and Cecil,\r\nwho was never tired of assuring Guzman that Hawkins’ great expedition,\r\nthen on the coast bound for Guinea, should under no circumstances do\r\nanything prejudicial in any of the territories of the King of Spain;\r\nnotwithstanding which, and the fact that Philip’s Flemish fleet had just\r\nbeen effusively welcomed at Dover, John Hawkins himself, when the same\r\nfleet put into Plymouth, fired a few cannon shots at the flagship, and\r\nbanged away until the Spanish flag was hauled down, to the unspeakable\r\nindignation of the Flemish admiral.\r\n\r\nThings were in this condition in the autumn of 1567, all Europe being on\r\nthe alert watching the gathering of the storm over the Netherlands. So\r\nlong as there was any danger of French interference in Scotland, or of\r\nthe Catholic powers taking up the cause of Mary Stuart, Elizabeth, and\r\nmore especially Cecil, drew closer to Spain and the Catholic party in\r\nEngland. But events moved quickly, and the whole aspect changed within a\r\nfew weeks. Almost simultaneously, in September 1567, came from different\r\nquarters two preliminary thunderclaps that announced the tempest. The\r\nadvent of Alba in the Netherlands on his mission of vengeance had sent\r\naffrighted fugitives flying in swarms across the narrow seas to England;\r\nbut when, on the 9th September, after the treacherous dinner-party in\r\nBrussels, the two highest heads in Flanders, Egmont and Horn, were struck\r\nat, and the bearers lodged in jail, all the world knew that the great\r\nstruggle had begun between liberty and Protestantism on the one side,\r\nand tyranny and Catholicism on the other. Thanks mainly to Elizabeth\r\nand Cecil, it was not to be fought out on British soil. Only a few weeks\r\nafterwards came the news of Condé’s attempt to seize the young King of\r\nFrance and his mother, and to rescue them from the influence of Cardinal\r\nLorraine. The attempt failed, but soon all France was ablaze with civil\r\nwar, for the Protestant worm at last had turned. Betrayed, as they had\r\nbeen before, and face to face now with foreign mercenaries hurried into\r\nFrance to suppress them, the convinced Huguenots decided to stand by\r\ntheir faith, and fight to the death for liberty to exercise it, let\r\nthe “politicians” do what they might. The two events happening almost\r\ntogether, whilst Mary Stuart was in prison under a cloud, and the rebel\r\nShan O’Neil in Ireland had finally fallen, at once relieved England of\r\nall danger from without, unless the Catholic party was irresistibly\r\ntriumphant both in France and Flanders. The best way to prevent that was\r\nto support those who were in arms against it, and the policy of Elizabeth\r\nand Cecil was again cautiously changed accordingly.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Queen received from Norris news of Condé’s rising, she\r\nsent for Bôchetel, the French Ambassador, and ostentatiously condoled\r\nwith him for the disrespect shown to his sovereign. She rather overdid\r\nthe pity, and suggested that she should arbitrate between the King\r\nand the Huguenots, but would take care that no help was given to the\r\nlatter from England. Bôchetel dryly thanked her for the assurance that\r\nshe would not help rebels _again_, but said that his King was quite\r\nable to deal with his subjects without her assistance. Here, as in the\r\ncase of Mary Stuart, Elizabeth’s first feeling was indignation at any\r\ndisrespect being shown to a sovereign; but Cecil’s letter to Norris at\r\nthe time (November 3, 1567) shows that he and his friends looked at the\r\nmatter from another point of view,[262] which Elizabeth herself shortly\r\nafterwards adopted, as she had done in the case of the Queen of Scots. In\r\nthe meanwhile the Council became daily more outspoken in favour of the\r\nHuguenots. Messages of encouragement went speeding across the Channel\r\nto Coligny, to Montgomerie, and the rest of the Huguenot leaders. Cecil\r\nhimself took Archbishop Parker to task for his leniency to Bishop Thirlby\r\nand Dr. Boxall, who were in his custody for recusancy; and at the end of\r\nNovember the official blindness as to people attending mass in London\r\ncame to an end. The English people who had worshipped undisturbed in the\r\nSpanish Ambassador’s chapel were suddenly arrested, and many of them\r\nsent to prison.[263] On the same day Cecil complained to Guzman that he\r\nhad promoted the breaking of the law by persuading Englishmen to attend\r\nmass, and repeated other sinister reports about him. The Spaniard denied\r\nthe charges, and warned Cecil that, although his present attitude might\r\nbe prompted by patriotic motives, it was a dangerous one, “and that\r\nsome people were casting the responsibility upon him (Cecil), for the\r\npurpose of making him unpopular.” Cecil, apparently, was not afraid of\r\nthis, for he had strained the loyalty of his friends almost to breaking\r\nlimits lately by the severity exercised against the anti-vestment divines\r\nand his approaches to Spain, and doubtless welcomed the change in the\r\npolitical position which allowed him to enforce uniformity upon Catholics\r\nas well as upon his own co-religionists. There was a talk of expelling\r\nall Catholics from the Queen’s household, and Bacon, the Chancellor,\r\nmade a speech in the Star Chamber directing the judges and officials\r\nto put into renewed force and press vigorously, the laws against the\r\npossession of books attacking the Protestant faith. “What most troubles\r\nthe Catholics, however,” writes Guzman, “is to see that Leicester has\r\nbecome much more confirmed in his heresy, and is followed by the Earl of\r\nPembroke, who had been considered a Catholic. There is nobody now on the\r\nCatholic side in the Council.”\r\n\r\nThe hollow negotiations, too, for the Archduke’s marriage, carried on\r\nby honest Sussex in Vienna, were politely shelved; and the political\r\npretence which Elizabeth and Cecil had kept up for so long, of a leaning\r\ntowards the Catholic side, could safely be discarded until the renewed\r\nliability of England to attack from without might again call for its\r\nresumption. So far the Queen and her minister had dissembled to good\r\npurpose, for the great struggle for the faith had been diverted from\r\nEngland to the Continent, and the monarchs of France and Spain were both\r\nbusy in suppressing the religious revolts of their own subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n1568-1569\r\n\r\n\r\nNorris in France, and Cecil’s agents in Spain and Flanders, continued\r\nto send home alarming news of the intentions of Philip and the Guises\r\nagainst England. The stories were untrue, but coming from so many\r\nquarters at the same time, were evidently not invented by the senders.\r\nThey were in fact set afloat by Philip, as a means of keeping England\r\nin a state of apprehension, and so preventing her from sending overt\r\naid to the Protestants in Flanders and France. To some extent they were\r\nsuccessful in frightening Elizabeth, evidently to Cecil’s annoyance, for\r\nthe Secretary at least had taken Philip’s measure, and knew that his\r\nhands were full. In a letter to Lord Cobham, written in April 1568, Cecil\r\ngives expression to this feeling in the figurative language which he was\r\nin the habit of employing. Cobham, as Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports,\r\nhad forwarded a secret proposal of some Frenchmen in Calais to seize\r\nthat citadel and deliver it to the Huguenots to be held for Elizabeth.\r\nThe Queen was alarmed at the boldness of the plan, but promised that she\r\nwould consider it if the King of France refused her offered mediation\r\nbetween him and the Huguenots. Cecil writes thereupon: “It grieveth me\r\nto hold and follow the plough where the owner of the ground forbears\r\nto cast in the seed in seasonable time, and I am all the more grieved\r\nthat your Lordship is in like manner discouraged. ‘_Moremus sepe sed\r\nnihil promoremus._’ But besides the plough your Lordship follows, we\r\nare occupied with another, meaning to join both together for surety, but\r\nstill I despair of seed.”[264]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, though Elizabeth herself was still overshadowed by\r\nthe traditional might of Spain, the English Catholics were feeling, by\r\nthe increased severity exercised towards them, the changed political\r\nsituation. The English minister, and in her stronger moments the English\r\nQueen, were speaking more firmly now than ever they had dared to do since\r\nElizabeth’s accession. For the first time the position was becoming\r\ndefined. It was no longer France or Spain nationally that was the enemy\r\nof England: it was Catholic against Protestant the world over. Philip\r\nwas as nervously anxious to avoid war as Elizabeth herself, and his need\r\nto do so much greater than hers; but if Protestantism was allowed to\r\nbecome strong, then his great empire must crumble, and the basis of his\r\nsystem disappear. His own slow stolidity had been in a great measure the\r\ncause of his finding himself in so unfavourable a tactical position, for\r\nhe had allowed the champions of the autonomous rights of his Flemish\r\ndominions—rights which at first he might easily have conciliated with his\r\nown sovereignty—to obtain for their cause the immense added impetus of\r\nreligious reform. It was this fact which had changed the situation; and\r\nit was accentuated in England by the activity of the Pope (Pius V.) in\r\nestablishing English seminaries abroad, and by means of money and busy\r\nagents in England itself, raising the spirits of those who clung to the\r\nold faith.[265]\r\n\r\nThe answer to the effervescence thus caused amongst the Catholics was the\r\nrenewed harshness against them by the English ministers and the rising\r\naggressiveness of the Protestants. Late in February 1568, Cecil sent word\r\nto Guzman, with whom he was still ostensibly on friendly terms, to say\r\nthat the Queen had learnt casually that the English Ambassador in Madrid\r\n(Dr. Man) was not allowed to hold Protestant service in the embassy.\r\nShe was surprised at this, and had sent to the Ambassador orders to\r\ndemand the same rights as were accorded to Guzman in England; if these\r\nwere denied she would recall him. Cecil himself was more outspoken and\r\nindignant than usual, and much more so than the Queen. “They think, no\r\ndoubt, that the present troubles in France and elsewhere,” writes Guzman,\r\n“give them a good opportunity of gaining ground, their own affairs being\r\nfavourable; so they have begun to look out more keenly, and to trouble\r\nthe Catholics, summoning some and arresting others, and warning them to\r\nobey the present laws … they (the Council) soon change her (the Queen),\r\nand all their efforts are directed at making her shy of me.”[266]\r\nGuzman’s messenger to Madrid travelled more quickly than Cecil’s, and\r\nbefore Dr. Man could demand his right to enjoy Protestant service, he was\r\nunceremoniously hustled out of Madrid, without obtaining audience of the\r\nKing, the pretext being that he had in public conversation at his own\r\ntable insulted the Catholic faith.[267] Though Philip took this strong\r\ncourse, he was as anxious as ever to avoid an open quarrel with England\r\nabout that or anything else, and sent all sorts of conciliatory messages\r\nto the Queen. Dr. Man, he said, had behaved himself so outrageously that\r\nhis further stay in Spain was impossible; but if another Ambassador were\r\nsent who would act as English Ambassadors always had done, he should be\r\nreceived with open arms.\r\n\r\nThe news arrived in London at a bad time. A Portuguese Ambassador had\r\njust come (May 1568) to complain—“brawling,” as Cecil calls it—of the\r\nHawkins expeditions to Guinea. He went to the audience with Guzman, and\r\nfound the Queen in a towering rage about a scurrilous letter referring\r\nto her, written by the Cardinal Prince Dom Henrique. Cecil had obtained\r\npossession of the letter somehow, and produced it, saying that the\r\npresumption of the Portuguese was insufferable and made them hated by\r\nall nations. The matter of the letter quite overshadowed the grievance\r\nabout trade, as it no doubt was intended to do, and the Portuguese got no\r\nredress. On the contrary, Cecil called to him some Spanish residents in\r\nLondon who accompanied the Ambassador to Whitehall, and warned them that\r\nthey might not attend mass at the embassy. What! not foreigners? asked\r\nAntonio de Guaras. No, retorted Cecil, and turned his back upon them to\r\nrejoin the Queen. The next day when Cecil saw Guzman, he complained of\r\nAlba’s severity in Flanders, and of some insulting reference to Elizabeth\r\nin the “Pontifical History” of Dr. Illescas, so that when Dr. Man’s\r\nletter arrived immediately afterwards announcing his practical expulsion\r\nfrom Spain, everything was prepared for an explosion. The Queen received\r\nthe news with some alarm as to what it might portend, and was at first\r\ninclined to be conciliatory; but when Guzman visited Cecil in the Strand\r\ntwo or three days afterwards, he found the Secretary in a fit of anger\r\nunusual with him. Such treatment of an Ambassador, he said, was an\r\nunheard-of insult to his mistress, unless it was meant as a provocation\r\nto war. After storming for some time, he stopped for want of breath;\r\nand it needed all Guzman’s suavity to calm him. “I waited a little for\r\nhim to recover from his rage, and then went up to him, laughing, and\r\nembraced him, saying that I was amused to see him fly into such a passion\r\nover what I had told him, because I knew that he understood differently.\r\nThe affair, I said, might be made good or bad as the Queen liked to\r\nmake it.”[268] But Cecil was not easily appeased. He told Guzman that\r\nthe Council regarded him with suspicion, that Englishmen were treated\r\nharshly in Spain, and much more to the same effect, all of which was very\r\nsurprising to the Spaniard, who was unused to such plain speaking from\r\nhim. But in the ten years that Elizabeth had sat upon the throne, things\r\nhad radically changed. Cecil could afford to speak boldly to Spain now;\r\nfor whilst England had grown enormously in wealth, commerce, industry,\r\nand shipping, under a prudent, patriotic Government, both the great\r\nrivals she formerly feared were rent by the religious schism which the\r\nfolly or ambition of their rulers had precipitated upon them, and England\r\nat any given moment could paralyse either of them for harm by smiling\r\nupon their Protestant subjects.\r\n\r\nWhilst Mary was in Lochleven Castle, Murray’s enemies, the Hamiltons\r\nand the Catholics, were busy. Murray had tried his best by severity to\r\nreduce the country to something approaching order, and the turbulent\r\nchiefs who profited by anarchy resented it. The compromising papers\r\nwhich implicated the ruling powers in the late deeds of murder and\r\nviolence were burnt, though not those that implicated the Queen,[269]\r\nand the whole of the responsibility was cast upon the Queen and Bothwell.\r\nReligious uniformity was passed by Parliament, and the exercise of\r\nCatholic worship abolished. All this violent action, too rapid and too\r\npartial to be readily assimilated by a country so profoundly divided as\r\nScotland was, naturally caused reaction in favour of Mary, and when after\r\none unsuccessful attempt she escaped from prison (2nd May), there were\r\nfriends in plenty to flock to her banner. The day before her flight she\r\nhad written the fervent prayer to Elizabeth, swearing unchanging fidelity\r\nto her if she would send her help[270]—help for which she had besought\r\nCatharine de Medici in vain; for France wanted the alliance of Scotland,\r\nnot that of Mary Stuart personally. The day after, when Mary, surrounded\r\nby Hamiltons, was free again, the possibilities were all changed. Mary\r\nStuart turned in a few hours from the humble suppliant to the haughty\r\nsovereign. Her abdication was revoked, Murray’s regency declared illegal,\r\nand all his acts annulled. Beton was sent off post-haste to London and\r\nParis to demand for his mistress a thousand harquebussiers and a sum of\r\nmoney. Beton’s instructions were to tell the English Government that if\r\nthey would not send the help, he was to demand it from the French. Cecil\r\nwrites to Norris,[271] 16th May, that under these circumstances the Queen\r\nhad promised all that Mary demanded; but he was to keep his eye on Beton,\r\nand if he asked for French aid, Catharine was to be told the message he\r\nbrought from Mary to London. Before Beton left London he went to see\r\nGuzman with a verbal message from Mary. Now that she was free, she said,\r\nshe would show the world how innocent she was, and begged for the advice\r\nand help of Guzman and his master. She was a firmer Catholic than ever,\r\nshe averred; nearly all the people and nobles of Scotland were on her\r\nside; but she complained that she was in the field without proper garb or\r\nadornments, and begged Guzman to send a request to the Duke of Alba to\r\nseize her jewels and restore them to her, if Murray sent them to Flanders\r\nfor sale.[272]\r\n\r\nThis was on the 11th May. Two days afterwards the result of the battle\r\nof Langside once more cast the unhappy Mary Stuart into the chasm of\r\nirredeemable misfortune, and on the 16th she fled across the Solway a\r\nfugitive to England, to see her country no more in life. Such a step\r\nas this was tempting fate. It is true that Elizabeth had constantly\r\nprofessed sympathy for her in her captivity; but whilst the English\r\nQueen’s words were fair, the acts of her Government, dictated not by\r\npersonal motives, such as the friends of Mary have absurdly tried to fix\r\nupon Cecil, but by high national policy, had been uniformly in favour\r\nof Murray and the Protestants. Mary’s attitude, moreover, had from the\r\nfirst, and not unnaturally, been favourable to the French alliance, upon\r\nwhich for centuries Scotland had depended for the preservation of its\r\nindependence; and to place herself thus unconditionally at the mercy of\r\nthe English, whose policy she had opposed and whose interests she sought\r\nto subvert, was little short of an act of madness. Mary had no excuse for\r\ntrusting to a Quixotic generosity, of which Elizabeth had never given her\r\nthe slightest indication beyond conventional fine words, such as would\r\nhardly deceive Mary. It was not so much that she overrated her generosity\r\nas she underrated her boldness.\r\n\r\nDrury in Berwick had kept Cecil informed almost from hour to hour of\r\nthe course of events in Scotland;[273] and a few hours only after Mary\r\nlanded at Workington she wrote her famous and oft-quoted letter to the\r\nEnglish Queen. In it she recites her sorrows, and begs Elizabeth to aid\r\nher in her just quarrel; but, above all, to send for her as soon as\r\npossible, “for I am in a pitiable condition, not only for a Queen but\r\na gentlewoman.”[274] The position was a difficult one for the English\r\nQueen and Council. Guzman says they were much perplexed, “as the Queen\r\nhas always shown good-will to the Queen of Scots, and the majority of\r\nthe Council has been opposed to her, and favourable to the Regent and\r\nhis government. If this Queen has her way, they will have to treat Mary\r\nas a sovereign, which will offend those who forced her to abdicate; so\r\nthat although these folks are glad enough to have her in their hands,\r\nthey have many things to consider … if she remain free, and able to\r\ncommunicate with her friends, great suspicions will arise. In any case it\r\nis certain that the two women will not agree very long together.”[275]\r\n\r\nWhen Mary had arrived at Carlisle a few days afterwards, she sent Lord\r\nHerries to London with a letter for Cecil, which may be given in full.\r\nMary’s letters were always clever, unless she lost her temper, as she\r\ndid sometimes, and here it will be seen that she appeals to positively\r\nthe only feeling which it was probable would move Cecil to favour her,\r\nnamely, her kinship to his mistress and her regal status. “Mester\r\nCeciles,” runs the letter, “L’équité, dont vous avvez le nom d’estre\r\namateur, et la fidelle et sincère servitude que portez a la Royne,\r\nMadame ma bonne sœur, et par consequent a toutes celles qui sont de son\r\nsang, et en pareille dignité, me fayt en ma juste querele, par sur tous\r\nautres m’adresser a vous en ce temps de mon trouble pour etre avancée\r\npar votre bon conseille, que j’ai commandé Lord Heris, presant porteur\r\nvous fayre entandre au long.… De Karlile ce xxviii Mey. Votre bien bonne\r\namye Marie R.”[276] With this letter Herries brought others for the\r\nPope and Guzman. He demanded aid for his mistress on a pledge sent to\r\nher by Elizabeth through Throgmorton in the form of a ring, and when\r\nsome hesitation was shown, he imprudently blurted out that if Elizabeth\r\ndid not keep her word his mistress would appeal to France, Spain, the\r\nEmperor, and the Pope. “The Pope!” exclaimed puritan Bedford, shocked\r\nat the idea. “Yes, the Pope,” replied Herries, “or the Grand Turk, or\r\nthe Sophi, or any one else who will help her.” This sort of talk was\r\nsufficient to decide Mary’s removal to Bolton as a measure of precaution.\r\n\r\nBefore this took place, however, Lord Scrope and Sir Francis Knollys had\r\nbeen deputed by Elizabeth to visit and confer with Mary at Carlisle.\r\nHerries on that occasion had said that if the English would not help\r\nhis Queen, she wished to go to France; “whereupon,” writes Knollys, we\r\n“answered that your Highness could in no wise lyke hyr sekyng aide in\r\nFrance, therbie to bring Frenchmen into Skotland;” and, continued the\r\nenvoys, the Queen of England could not receive her personally until she\r\nwas satisfied of her innocence in the murder of her husband. Mary was\r\njust as imprudent as Herries in her interview with the English envoys;\r\nbut what frightened Knollys most was the large number of her English\r\nsympathisers in the north of England. In his letter to Elizabeth he\r\npoints out the danger of the situation, and suggests that Mary should\r\nhave the choice of freely returning to Scotland, if she chose, or of\r\nremaining in England; but not of going to France, as she evidently wished\r\nto do. “She was so agile and spirited,” says Knollys, that she could only\r\nbe kept a prisoner so near the Border by very rigorous means, such as\r\n“devices of towels and toyes at her chamber window”; whereas to carry her\r\nfarther inland might cause “serious sedition.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth and her Council decided to run the latter risk rather than\r\nthat Mary should go to France to be a permanent thorn in the flesh of\r\nEngland, and the Queen of Scots’ long imprisonment commenced.[277] Even\r\nin the first few weeks of her stay she was busy endeavouring to subvert\r\nEnglish ends; appointing Chatelherault, Argyll, and Huntly to the supreme\r\ngovernment of the kingdom against Murray; Chatelherault being strongly\r\nin the French interest, and daily clamouring through his brother in\r\nParis for French armed support. All this was known to the Queen and\r\nCecil; and Mary’s intemperate letters of protest against her removal\r\nfrom Carlisle, and her constant threats to appeal to France and Spain\r\nif Elizabeth would not help her,[278] made it altogether inconsistent\r\nwith prudence to allow the misguided woman her liberty. The investigation\r\ninto Mary’s guilt or innocence seems to have originated with Cecil.[279]\r\nLeft to herself, Elizabeth, as we have seen, was mainly influenced by the\r\npersonal feeling of reverence for a sovereign: Cecil could not oppose\r\nthis, and as usual took an indirect means of reaching his end. When Mary\r\ncomplained to Knollys at Carlisle of the subjects who had dethroned\r\nher, he had told her that as it was lawful for subjects to depose mad\r\nsovereigns, it was also lawful for them to depose those who had lost\r\ntheir wits to the extent of conniving at murder. Mary wept at this,\r\nand Knollys softened the blow; but Knollys had certainly seen Cecil’s\r\nreport, and took the line suggested by it. If Mary could be shown to have\r\nconnived at Darnley’s death—and Cecil must have known of the damning\r\nproofs against her when he proposed the negotiation—the regal immunity\r\nfell from her like a loosened garment, and Elizabeth’s personal desire\r\nto consider the sacredness of the monarch before the interests of the\r\ncountry lost its principal resting point.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the state of civil war in Scotland continued, and\r\nnews came daily of French armaments preparing to aid Mary’s party.\r\nCecil ceaselessly urged an armistice, and at last (1st September) was\r\nsuccessful, though imprudent Herries continued to threaten that if\r\nElizabeth did not restore the Queen of Scots to the throne in two months,\r\nshe and her friends would appeal only to France for armed aid. Elizabeth\r\nclearly could not force Mary upon the Scottish people, and for her\r\ninterference to be effective she must be recognised as a mediator, not\r\nby Mary alone, but also by Murray and his party. This was difficult; for\r\nMurray knew that if the final result was to restore Mary with any power\r\nat all, he and his party sooner or later were doomed. Thanks mainly to\r\nthe efforts of Cecil, Murray at last gave way, and the commissions of\r\nScotch and English Councillors were sent to York, ostensibly to mediate\r\nbetween the Queen of Scots and her subjects. But Mary found herself no\r\nlonger, as she had hoped to be, the accuser of Murray, but practically on\r\nher own trial for murder. By a remark in a letter from Cecil to Norris\r\nat the time, he seems again with some difficulty to have avoided being\r\nappointed a commissioner himself.\r\n\r\nWhilst the intricate and obscure proceedings in York[280] were\r\nprogressing, Cecil’s hands were full in London. Protestant zeal was\r\nfairly aflame now at Alba’s proceedings in the Netherlands. All eastern\r\nEngland swarmed with Flemish fugitives, many of whom found their way back\r\nhome again well armed with weapons bought in England, and even more with\r\nmessages of indignant sympathy from English Protestants. Guzman protested\r\nto Cecil again and again, but could get no more than vague half promises,\r\nand once a proclamation, which the Spaniards described as a “compliment\r\nrather than a remedy.”\r\n\r\nIn September the mild and diplomatic Guzman was withdrawn, much to\r\nElizabeth’s apprehension, and Cecil’s regret, and an Ambassador of very\r\ndifferent calibre was sent. For many years the warlike party in Philip’s\r\ncouncils, led by Alba, had been urging him to active hostility towards\r\nEngland, but the peace party of Ruy Gomez had prevented the advice\r\nfrom being adopted. Now that Alba was supreme in the Netherlands, and\r\nreported that the Protestant revolt was mainly fed from England, Philip\r\nseems to have decided to alarm Elizabeth into neutrality by sending\r\na rough-tongued representative. He had felt his ground first by his\r\ncontemptuous treatment of Dr. Man, and seeing that Elizabeth had taken\r\nit quietly, he sent as his new Ambassador a turbulent bigoted Catalan,\r\nnamed Gerau de Spes, to endeavour by truculence to do what the suavity\r\nof Guzman had failed to effect. Dutch, Huguenot, and English privateers\r\nwere preying upon Spanish shipping, to an extent which well-nigh cut\r\noff communication by sea between Spain and northern Europe. Money and\r\narms, unchecked, found their way from England to the brave “beggars” in\r\nHolland; and though Philip did not wish to fight England, it was vital\r\nfor him to paralyse her for harm. Mary Stuart had written to Philip from\r\nCarlisle, begging him for help against Elizabeth, and the chance seemed\r\nto Philip a good one to disturb England for his own ends, without war.\r\nHe accordingly wrote cautiously to Alba (15th September), saying that\r\nhe was willing to help Mary, but desired Alba to report upon what might\r\nbe done to that end, whilst sending reassuring promises to the Queen of\r\nScots.[281] From the first hour that De Spes set foot in England, he went\r\nbeyond his instructions and conspired actively against the Government to\r\nwhich he was accredited.\r\n\r\nThere was more even than this untoward change to occupy the thoughts\r\nand hands of Elizabeth’s first minister. The war had raged in France\r\nbetween the Huguenots and the Catholics from September 1567 till the\r\nclever management of Catharine had beguiled the Protestants to accept the\r\nhollow peace of Longjumeau (March 1568). Hans Casimir and his mercenary\r\nGermans went home; the Huguenots laid down their arms; and then again the\r\nCatholic pulpits thundered forth that it was godly to break faith with\r\nheretics, and that the blood shed of unbelievers sent up sweet incense\r\nto heaven. Nearly 10,000 Huguenots were treacherously slain in three\r\nmonths, and no punishment could be obtained against the murderers. Condé\r\nand Coligny fled to the stronghold of La Rochelle, there to be joined by\r\nthe Queen of Navarre with 4000 men-at-arms, and all that was strong and\r\nwarlike on the side of the Huguenots. Elizabeth in the autumn was making\r\na progress through the valley of the Thames when she heard that Cardinal\r\nChatillon[282] had escaped from Tréport, and had arrived in England and\r\ndesired an audience. Lord Cobham, Warden of the Cinque Ports, made much\r\nof him when he landed; Gresham entertained him; the French Ambassador,\r\nhimself inclined to be a Huguenot, honoured him as if he were a prince;\r\nand as soon as the Queen’s answer was received, Chatillon hurried down\r\nto Newbury to prefer his request to the Queen. He looked little of a\r\ncardinal or a churchman, for he dressed in cape, hat, and sword, and\r\nhis wife joined him, but that perhaps made him all the more welcome.\r\nThrogmorton voices the general idea in a letter to Cecil. “I think,” he\r\nsays, “with you, that it is a special favour of God to preserve this\r\nrealm from calamities by their neighbours’ troubles.… If her Majesty\r\nsuffer the Low Countries and France to be weeded of the members of the\r\nChurch whereof England is also a portion, I see no other thing can happen\r\nbut a more grievous accident to us than to those whom we have suffered to\r\nbe destroyed.”[283]\r\n\r\nBut it is quite clear that neither the Queen nor Cecil intended to\r\nallow the Huguenots to be destroyed. The Cardinal was received with\r\nopen arms, munitions were brought from the Tower in hot haste, and a\r\nstrong fleet was fitted out to carry aid to Huguenots in Rochelle. The\r\nFrench Ambassador might be half a Huguenot, but his brother the Bishop\r\nof Rennes was not, and he came and protested strongly in the name of\r\nCatharine against Chatillon’s reception in England. Cecil tells Norris\r\nin Paris that he got a very short answer. “I told him,” says Cecil, “we\r\nhad more cause to favour him (Chatillon) and all such, because the said\r\nCardinal Lorraine was known to be an open enemy of our sovereign. So he\r\ndeparted with no small misliking, and I well contented to utter some\r\nround speeches.”[284] But, prudent as usual, Cecil was a stickler for\r\nlegality, and took care that appearances were kept up. The Cardinal, he\r\ninsisted, was a faithful subject of his King; it was the Guises who were\r\nthe enemies. Norris is directed to tell Catharine that the fleet is “to\r\nprotect our Burdeaux fleet from pyrats”; and if any complaint is made\r\nabout money and munitions of war being provided for Chatillon, he is\r\nto say that the Queen would never do anything against the French King,\r\nbut if English merchants made bargains with the Huguenots, he (Cecil)\r\nknew of no way to stop it. He certainly made no attempt to do so; for\r\nwith a great civil war on hand it was clear that France could not resort\r\nto arms for the cause of Mary Stuart; and whilst mediatory proceedings\r\nwere dragging on in England, the Protestant cause in Scotland was being\r\nconsolidated.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy Queen of Scots herself, persuaded that no help could just now\r\nreach her from her French kinsmen, seems to have depended almost entirely\r\nupon the aid to be given by the King of Spain and Alba to the Scottish\r\nCatholics. No messenger came from her to London without beseeching\r\nsecret letters in cipher to the Spanish Ambassador; and whilst the trial\r\ndragged on, she left no stone unturned to arouse indignation against\r\nMurray and the English. They wished to kill her child, she said, and\r\nforce the reformed faith upon her and Scotland. In an intercepted letter\r\nto one of the Hamiltons, which fell into Cecil’s hands,[285] she says\r\nthat Dumbarton, with Murray’s consent, was to be seized by the English.\r\nElizabeth had, she averred, promised to sustain Murray, to recognise his\r\nlegitimacy, and raise him to the throne as her vassal; both of these\r\nbeing accusations which were likely to move the Hamiltons to fury. But,\r\nabove all, she accused Cecil of a deeper plot still. He had arranged,\r\nshe said, to marry one of his daughters to the Earl of Hertford, father\r\nof Catharine Grey’s young heir, and thus, by mutual support, Hertford’s\r\nson and Murray might occupy respectively the English and Scottish thrones\r\nunder Cecil’s tutelage. “So they will both be bent on my son’s death.”\r\nThere was no truth in it; but it was an excellent invention to arouse the\r\nire of the Scottish Catholics. Before even this was written (December),\r\nCecil knew how bitter was Mary’s feeling against him. When Beton came to\r\nLondon from Mary in October, with secret messages for De Spes, suggesting\r\nher escape, “which will not be difficult, or even to raise a revolt\r\nagainst this Queen,” Cecil guessed his real errand, and, says De Spes,\r\n“Cecil is so much against the Queen of Scotland, and so jealous in the\r\nmatter, that as soon as he saw Beton he asked him whether he had been\r\nwith his complaints to the Spanish Ambassador, and whether he came to see\r\nme often; to which Beton replied that he had no dealings whatever with\r\nme.”[286]\r\n\r\nBut Cecil’s spies were everywhere, and he knew that De Spes was working\r\nceaselessly in Mary’s interests to bring disaster upon England, in union\r\nwith his chief, the Duke of Alba, in Flanders. The great difficulty\r\nin the way of the Spaniards was the extreme penury of the treasury.\r\nSpain was in the very depths of poverty, its commerce well-nigh killed\r\nby unwise fiscal arrangements and the depredations of the privateers,\r\nagainst whom De Spes inveighed to Cecil constantly, but in vain, though\r\nthe Secretary was strongly against piracy on principle. Flanders\r\ndesolated with war, Holland and Zeeland in revolt, were no longer the\r\nmilch-cows for the Spaniards that they had been, and Alba, with an\r\nunpaid and rebellious soldiery, was in despair of subduing Orange, much\r\nless of crushing England, unless large sums of money were forthcoming.\r\nPhilip made a great effort in the autumn of 1568, and borrowed a large\r\nsum of money from the Genoese bankers to supply Alba with the sinews of\r\nwar. The money was to be conveyed by sea to Flanders at the risk of the\r\nbankers. Three of the vessels duly arrived in Antwerp, after having been\r\nchased by Huguenot privateers; but several others put into Southampton,\r\nPlymouth, and Falmouth, to escape from their pursuers. The representative\r\nin England of the bankers was the Genoese Benedict Spinola, who requested\r\nDe Spes to ask the Queen to allow the money to be discharged and brought\r\noverland to Dover, where it could be transhipped under convoy for the\r\nDuke of Alba. De Spes saw the Queen on the 29th November, and she\r\nconsented to this course being adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the privateers, in crowds, were clustered outside the\r\nharbours where the rich treasure lay, and nearly every Spanish ship that\r\nentered the Channel fell into their hands. De Spes had not been sent by\r\nPhilip to provoke war, but in the few months that he had been in England\r\nhis violence, insolence, and bigotry had brought war nearer than ever\r\nit had been before. Norris in Paris had just been warned, and had sent\r\nthe warning to Cecil, that a plot was formed to kill the Queen, and that\r\nthe papal banker Ridolfi, De Spes, and the English Catholic nobility,\r\nheaded by the Earl of Arundel, had agreed to place Mary Stuart on the\r\nEnglish throne. De Spes was closeted day and night with Mary’s agents.\r\n“The Bishop of Ross came at midnight to offer me the good-will of his\r\nmistress and many gentlemen of this country.… The Queen of Scotland told\r\nmy servant to convey to me the following words: ‘Tell the Ambassador that\r\nif his master will help me I shall be Queen of England in three months,\r\nand mass shall be said all over the country.’”[287]\r\n\r\nCondé’s agents, too, were for ever telling the Queen and Cecil of the\r\nplans against England of the Guises and Alba, as soon as the Protestants\r\nin France and Flanders had been subjugated; and Knollys wrote almost\r\ndespairingly from Bolton of Mary’s haughty disbelief in Elizabeth’s\r\npower to harm her.[288] There need, therefore, be no surprise that the\r\nEnglish Council began to question the wisdom of allowing the treasure\r\nthat had fallen into their power to be used against the tranquillity and\r\nindependence of their own country. When De Spes asked Cecil for the safe\r\nconducts for the money, he was put off with vague evasions, whilst the\r\nmain question was being discussed. After much pressing, Cecil gave the\r\nsafe conducts, and sent orders to Plymouth and Falmouth (13th December,\r\nN.S.) that the shore authorities were to defend the treasure-ships,\r\nwhich were being threatened by pirates, even in port. “These orders are\r\nnow being sent off,” writes De Spes, “but in all things Cecil showed\r\nhimself an enemy to the Catholic cause, and desirous on every opportunity\r\nof opposing the interests of your Majesty.… He has to be dealt with by\r\nprayers and gentle threats.” “The Council is sitting night and day about\r\nthe Queen of Scotland’s affairs. Cecil and the Chancellor (Bacon) would\r\nlike to see her dead, as they have a King of their own choosing, one of\r\nHertford’s children.”[289]\r\n\r\nAfter deliberation, Cecil had sent for Bernard Spinola, and ascertained\r\nfrom him that the money was being conveyed at the bankers’ risk, and\r\ncould not legally be called King Philip’s property.[290] This seems to\r\nhave decided the question. The money on the cutter in Southampton harbour\r\nwas discharged, on the pretext of protecting it from pirates;[291] and\r\nas soon as De Spes got the news, on the 20th December, he went to the\r\nQueen in a violent rage to demand its return. He only saw Cecil, who said\r\nthe money was safe, but hinted that it did not belong to the King. De\r\nSpes then gave the bad advice to Alba to retaliate by seizing all English\r\nproperty in the Netherlands, which was done, and Cecil was provided with\r\na pretext which gave him what he always needed, a good legal position to\r\njustify his acts. The Queen had not hitherto plainly said that she would\r\nkeep the money; but as soon as she heard that Alba had seized English\r\nproperty, it gave her the required excuse for doing so. Her credit was\r\nas good as Philip’s, she said, and she would borrow it herself. Not only\r\n400,000 crowns in gold, but every scrap of Spanish property in England\r\nwas seized, enormously in excess of all English property in Flanders. In\r\nvain De Spes hectored and stormed, in vain Alba alternately threatened\r\nand implored, in vain Philip made seizures of Englishmen and goods\r\nin Spain; the Queen was in an unassailable position. Alba had openly\r\ndeclared the seizures of English property first, and all Elizabeth had\r\ndone was to adopt reprisals afterwards. But it crippled Alba and Philip\r\nalmost to exhaustion, and well-nigh ruined Spanish commerce and killed\r\nSpanish credit.\r\n\r\nFor years open and secret negotiations went on to obtain some restoration\r\nof the enormous amount of Spanish property seized. Cajolery, bribery,\r\nand appeals to English honour were resorted to without effect; private\r\nnegotiations were opened by the owners of the property to get partial\r\nrestitution on any terms; envoy after envoy was sent, and returned home\r\nempty-handed. The Queen refused to acknowledge Alba or his agents in any\r\nform, and Cecil was immovable in his determination that no arrangement\r\nshould be made that did not bring into account all the confiscations\r\nand persecutions that had ever been suffered by English in Spain at the\r\nhands of the Inquisition, which he knew was impossible. In the meanwhile\r\nthe property dwindled and was jobbed away, and little, if any, ever\r\neventually reached its proper owners.\r\n\r\nEarly in January the Queen refused to receive De Spes, and sent Cecil\r\nand the Lord Admiral, attended by a large train, and the aldermen of the\r\ncity, to see him at his house. Cecil, as usual, was the spokesman. He was\r\nangry and severe: upbraided the Ambassador for his bad offices; condemned\r\nthe cruelty of the Duke of Alba, and his insolence in seizing English\r\nproperty; and ended by placing De Spes and all his household under\r\narrest, in the custody of Henry Knollys, Arthur Carew, and Sir Henry\r\nKnyvett. The reason of this was that a violent letter from De Spes to\r\nAlba had been intercepted by Cecil’s orders. To make matters worse, the\r\nfoolish Ambassador, whilst under arrest, wrote an insolent letter to Alba\r\ncomplaining of his treatment, and sent it open to the Council. In it he\r\nsays that “Cecil is harsh and arrogant; that he vapoured about religion,\r\ndragged up the matter of John Man and about Bishop Quadra’s affairs,\r\nand, in short, did and said a thousand impertinent things. He thinks he\r\nis dealing with Englishmen, who all tremble before him.… The question\r\nof the money does not suit him. I beg your Excellency not to refrain on\r\nmy account from doing everything that the interests and dignity of the\r\nKing demand; for whilst Cecil rules, I do not believe there will ever be\r\nlasting peace. It is a pity so excellent a Queen should give credit to\r\nso scandalous a person as this. God send a remedy; for in this country,\r\npeople great and small are discontented with the Government.… Cecil is\r\nhaving a proclamation drawn up, from which he leaves out what is most\r\nimportant, and misstates the case. He refused to return my packet, and is\r\ngetting one Somers to decipher my letters. If he succeeds I will pardon\r\nhim.”[292] The transmission of this insolent letter, open to the Council,\r\nto be sent to Alba, produced the effect that might have been expected.\r\nDe Spes was asked to explain what he meant by such offensive expressions\r\nagainst the Government, and by some scurrilous references employed in\r\nanother intercepted letter towards the Queen. He tried to attenuate his\r\ninsolence towards the Queen, and the Council as a whole, but not that\r\ntowards Cecil personally.\r\n\r\nAnd so affairs drifted from bad to worse. Every letter from De Spes to\r\nAlba and the King was full of abuse of Cecil, and statements of the\r\ndetermination of the English Catholics to shake off his tyranny and raise\r\nMary Stuart to the throne. The people are all discontented, he says,\r\nand the slightest show of countenance from Philip will enable Elizabeth\r\nand the detested Cecil to be overthrown. Philip did not know what to\r\nthink of it, and sent to Alba orders to inquire independently whether\r\nDe Spes’ representations were true. If it is so easy, he says, he is\r\nwilling to give the aid required, as after his duty to maintain the holy\r\nfaith in his own dominions, it is incumbent upon him to re-establish it\r\nin England. “If you think the chance will be lost by again waiting to\r\nconsult me, you may at once take the steps you consider advisable.”[293]\r\nAlba soon undeceived the King. He had his hands full in the Netherlands;\r\nhe was almost without money; rash and foolish De Spes, he knew, was not\r\nto be depended upon, and he told Philip plainly that he must temporise\r\nand make friends with Elizabeth, leaving vengeance until later. De\r\nSpes, he thought, was being deceived, perhaps betrayed, by Ridolfi and\r\nthe Catholics, and open war with England must be avoided at any cost.\r\nCecil, indeed, had accurately gauged the situation, and knew far better\r\nthan De Spes that Philip dared not fight, now that the Prince of Orange\r\nwas holding Holland and Zeeland against him. England’s traditional\r\nalliance was not with the House of Spain, but with the possessor of the\r\nNetherlands, and in the same proportion as Spain lost control over the\r\nLow Countries, the need for a close union with her shifted.\r\n\r\nLate in February the Duke of Norfolk, and his father-in-law, the Earl of\r\nArundel, to whom the changed situation was not so clear as to Cecil, sent\r\nRidolfi to De Spes with a cipher communication to tell him that the money\r\nand Spanish property should be returned.[294] “They had only consented\r\nto my detention and Cecil’s other impertinences, because they were not\r\nyet strong enough to resist him. But they were gathering friends, and\r\nwere letting the public know what was going on, in the hope and belief\r\nthat they will be able to turn out the present accursed Government and\r\nraise up another Catholic one, bringing the Queen to consent thereto.\r\nThey think your Excellency (Alba) will support them in this, and that\r\nthe country will not lose the friendship of our King. They say they will\r\nreturn to the Catholic religion, and they think a better opportunity\r\nnever existed than now. Although Cecil thinks he has them all under his\r\nheel, he will find few or none of them stand by him. I have encouraged\r\nthem.… In the meanwhile Cecil is bravely harrying the Catholics,\r\nimprisoning many, for nearly all the prisons are full. The Spaniards\r\n(_i.e._ from the arrested ships) are in Bridewell to the number of over\r\n150, and a minister is sent to preach to them.” This gives us a clue to\r\nthe real origin of the plot against Cecil, which his domestic biographer\r\nabsurdly ascribes to a noble member of the Council having seen upon his\r\ntable a book attacking aristocracy.[295] Rapin is nearer in guessing the\r\ncause of the conspiracy in ascribing it to Norfolk, Winchester, Pembroke,\r\nLeicester, Northumberland, Westmoreland, and Arundel, in favour of Mary\r\nStuart’s claim, at least to the succession, in opposition to Cecil’s\r\ncandidate, Catharine Grey’s son, Lord Beauchamp. Camden records that\r\nThrogmorton, Leicester’s henchman, advocated the lodging of Cecil in\r\nthe Tower first. “If he were once shut up, men would open their mouths\r\nto speak freely against him.”[296] As will be seen, however, Cecil was\r\nmore than a match for his jealous enemies, who were also the enemies of\r\nEngland; and the Queen, to her honour, stood bravely up for her great\r\nminister.[297] The plan agreed upon was for Norfolk, a cat’s-paw of\r\nLeicester, to denounce Cecil for his supposed intention of forcing the\r\nsuccession of Beauchamp, and provoking war with Spain by advocating the\r\nseizure of Philip’s treasure; but Leicester, too unstable, even, to keep\r\nthe counsel of his own plot, dropped a hint to the Queen, who warned\r\nCecil, and the whole nefarious conspiracy was unveiled. The excuse given\r\nby Norfolk and Arundel to De Spes for their failure was that so many\r\nCouncillors were interested in the plunder that they could not get them\r\nto move against Cecil. “For my part,” says De Spes, “I believe that they\r\nhave very little courage, and in the usual English way wish things to be\r\nso far advanced that they can with but little trouble win your Majesty’s\r\nrewards and favours.”\r\n\r\nOn the strength of their intentions against Cecil, Arundel, with his\r\nsons-in-law, Norfolk and Lumley, tried their hardest to get some\r\nmoney from De Spes, but without effect until the northern rebellion\r\nwas in preparation. Their intermediary was a Florentine banker, whose\r\nbrother-in-law, Cavalcanti, was one of Cecil’s agents, and through him\r\nevery step was known to the Secretary. Spies were everywhere. Whilst\r\nCecil’s most confidential private secretary, Allington, carried all his\r\nsecrets to De Spes for a consideration,[298] no visitor went to the\r\nSpanish Embassy whose name and business was not at once reported to\r\nCecil, who, says De Spes, was suspicious even of the birds of the air.\r\nThough Mary was in captivity, she contrived to write constant cipher\r\nletters through De Spes to the Pope, to Alba, and to Philip. The Bishop\r\nof Ross, her indefatigable but imprudent agent, took no step in Mary’s\r\ncause without consultation with the Spaniard. She would, he said, have\r\nbeen released already but for Cecil, her great enemy in the Council.[299]\r\nIf he could be got rid of, all would be well. The Bishop of Ross went so\r\nfar as to solicit another husband for Mary to be chosen by Philip, and\r\noffered her abject submission both for England and Scotland, in return\r\nfor aid to the coming rising in her favour. It will be seen by this that\r\na more dangerous and widespread plot even than that against Cecil was\r\nbeing planned by the Catholic nobility.\r\n\r\nAt what period the first suggestion was made for a marriage between the\r\nDuke of Norfolk and Mary Stuart is not certain, but the Bishop of Ross\r\nafterwards deposed[300] that the Duke had sent his offer to the Queen\r\nbefore the meeting of the Commission of York (October 1568), of which\r\nhe was president; and as Lady Scrope, in whose husband’s house, Bolton\r\nCastle, Mary was kept, was Norfolk’s sister, it is probable that the plan\r\nwas hatched during her stay at Bolton. From Murray’s statement[301] it\r\nappears that Norfolk had a private conference with him during the sitting\r\nof the Commission at York, when the Duke proposed to suppress the papers\r\nwhich incriminated Mary, in order to save the scandal of a conviction.\r\nMurray placed the evidence before the English Commissioners, and agreed\r\nto abide by Elizabeth’s decision, and Norfolk at once wrote a private\r\nletter to Cecil conveying his strong impression of the Queen’s guilt, but\r\nadvocating the suppression of the evidence. Norfolk’s conference with\r\nMurray, and probably Cecil’s knowledge of the marriage plan, appears to\r\nhave been the reason for the removal of the Commission to London, and\r\nthe employment of Norfolk elsewhere, as well as of the removal of Mary to\r\nTutbury. When Norfolk returned to court, Elizabeth received him coldly,\r\nfor the talk about his marriage with Mary was now public, and the Duke\r\nassured the Queen of the untruth of the rumours. After Murray, with real\r\nor pretended reluctance, had laid the whole of his evidence against Mary\r\nbefore the Commission, and the sittings had come to an end with the sole\r\nresult of leaving the cloud over her head, Norfolk’s plan for a time was\r\nshelved;[302] but the conspiracy of the nobles against Cecil in favour of\r\nMary again revived the idea of the marriage; and Guzman in June 1569 says\r\nthat the new Lord Dacre had mentioned the matter to him, and professed\r\nhis willingness to hold in readiness 15,000 men in the north, to rise in\r\nfavour of Mary if he were assured of Philip’s support. De Spes asserts\r\nthat Cecil had proposed to marry his widowed sister-in-law, Lady Hoby, to\r\nthe Duke, a proposal which the Duke had rejected with scorn, “as his eyes\r\nwere fixed upon the Queen of Scots.”\r\n\r\nBy this time matters had so far advanced that a large sum of money (6000\r\ncrowns) was sent by Alba to the Catholic nobles, through Lumley and\r\nArundel, as well as 10,000 to Mary, and the rising in the north was in\r\nprinciple decided upon; but Alba, whilst ready to supply money secretly,\r\nstrictly enjoined De Spes to turn a deaf ear to any suggestions for\r\novert aid against the Queen’s Government.[303] His great care for the\r\nmoment was to repair the effects of his mistake, and obtain some sort\r\nof restitution of the Spanish property seized in England. Agents were\r\nsent backwards and forwards, supple cosmopolitan Florentines mostly.\r\nRidolfi, Fiesco, the Cavalcantis, and several others tried by bribery and\r\nother means to induce Cecil to consent to an arrangement. It suited him\r\nto pretend a willingness to do so. Ridolfi dined and conferred with him\r\nmore than once on the subject at Cecil House. De Spes was released from\r\nhis captivity in Paget House (on the site of the present Essex Street,\r\nStrand), and allowed to take the Bishop of Winchester’s house instead;\r\nbut on various pretexts, invented, as he says, by Cecil, the interminable\r\nnegotiations about the restitution dragged on without much result, as\r\nCecil evidently intended them to do. “We must have patience,” De Spes\r\nwrites to Alba, “but the affair is greatly injured by Cecil’s having\r\nagain got the upper hand in the government, without fear now that the\r\nother members may overthrow him, for he knows that they could not agree\r\ntogether for the purpose.”[304]\r\n\r\nWhilst Cecil was temporising about the restitution, and dallying with\r\nthe Spanish agents, he kept his hand on the pulse of the Catholic Lords.\r\nArundel and his party had arranged that De Spes should once more be\r\nadmitted to the Queen’s presence at Guildford, and then go to a meeting\r\nof the conspirators at Nonsuch; but Cecil raised difficulties, and\r\nhimself came to town specially to tell De Spes that the Queen could not\r\nreceive him until he obtained fresh credentials direct from Spain. Cecil\r\nhad apparently by this time (August 1569) won over the Earl of Pembroke;\r\nand Leicester himself had taken fright at the probable result of his\r\nplotting. His accomplices had gone beyond him. The rise of Norfolk and\r\nMary under a Catholic regime would of course have meant extinction for\r\nLeicester, and though he was ready enough to ruin Cecil, he had no wish\r\nto be dragged down in his fall. “The Duke’s party,” writes De Spes, “and\r\nthose who favour the Queen of Scotland, are incomparably the greater\r\nnumber.… I believe there will be some great event soon, as the people are\r\nmuch dissatisfied and distressed by want of trade, and these gentlemen of\r\nNonsuch have some new imaginations in their heads.”\r\n\r\nA few days after this was written, Norfolk received the ominous warning\r\nfrom the Queen at Titchfield, to “beware on what pillow he rested his\r\nhead.” The Duke was a poor, weak creature, and instead of accompanying\r\nthe Queen to Windsor, he fled into Norfolk, and from there wrote an\r\napology to the Queen. Elizabeth’s answer was a peremptory summons for\r\nhim to come to court, ill or well. He delayed, and the Queen, in a rage,\r\nsent and arrested him, confining him first at Burnham, near Windsor, and\r\nshortly afterwards in the Tower. How wise and moderate Cecil was under\r\nthe circumstances, may be seen in his own letters. He knew better than\r\nany one that the conspiracy was primarily directed against him, as one\r\nof the conditions imposed upon Mary was stated to be that nothing should\r\nbe done against Elizabeth;[305] yet this is how he wrote to the Queen\r\njust before Norfolk was sent to the Tower[306] (9th October): “If the\r\nDuke shall be charged with the crime of treason, and shall not thereof\r\nbe convicted, he shall not only save his credit, but increase it. And\r\nsurely, without the facts may appear manifest within the compass of\r\ntreason (which I cannot see how they can), he shall be acquitted of that\r\ncharge; and better it were in the beginning to foresee the matter, than\r\nattempt it with discredit, and not without suspicion of evil will and\r\nmalice. Wherefore I am bold to wish that your Majesty would show your\r\nintention only to inquire of the facts and circumstances, and not by any\r\nspeech to note the same as treason. And if your Majesty would yourself\r\nconsider the words of the statute evidencing treasons, I think you would\r\nso consider it.”\r\n\r\nIn a letter written by Cecil to Norris a few days before this,[307] he\r\nsays that he had answered to the Queen, who was very angry with Norfolk,\r\nfor the latter’s return; and he gives an account of the Duke’s plight and\r\nreported willingness to obey the Queen’s summons: “whereof I am glad;\r\nfirst, for the respect of the State, and next for the Duke himself, whom\r\nof all subjects I honoured and loved above the rest, and surely found in\r\nhim always matter so deserving. Whilst this matter hath been passing,\r\nyou must not think but that the Queen of Scots was nearer looked to than\r\nbefore; and though evil willers of our State would gladly have seen some\r\ntroublesome issue of this matter, yet, God be thanked, I trust they\r\nshall be deceived. The Queen hath willed Lord Arundel and Lord Pembroke\r\nto keep their lodgings here, for that they were privy to this marriage\r\nintended, and did not reveal it to her Majesty; but I think none of them\r\ndid so with any evil meaning.[308] Of Lord Pembroke’s intent herein,\r\nI can witness that he meant nothing but well to the Queen’s Majesty.\r\nLord Lumley is also restrained, and the Queen hath also been grievously\r\noffended with Lord Leicester, but considering that he hath revealed all\r\nthat he sayeth he knoweth of himself, her Majesty spareth her displeasure\r\nmore towards him. Some disquiets must arise, but I trust not hurtful, for\r\nthat her Majesty sayeth she will know the truth, so as every one shall\r\nsee his own fault, and so stay.” But for all Cecil’s diplomatic pleading,\r\nNorfolk went to the Tower, where, with feigned submission and lying\r\nprotestations, he continued to plot with Mary Stuart and the enemies of\r\nEngland. The Catholics and Norfolk’s friends, of course, threw the whole\r\nblame upon Cecil.[309]\r\n\r\nShortly before Norfolk’s arrest, De Spes, who was still in close\r\ncommunication with the northern Lords and the Duke’s friends, wrote to\r\nthe King, anticipating a favourable result of the movement; “although, on\r\nthe other hand, I observe that Cecil and his fellow-Protestants on the\r\nCouncil are still very much deluding themselves. Even now, with the peril\r\nbefore them, they will not come to reason, so firmly persuaded are they\r\nthat their religion will prevail.” As soon as Arundel and his friends\r\nwere placed under arrest, De Spes says that “every one cast the blame\r\non Secretary Cecil, who conducts these affairs with great astuteness.”\r\nAll would be lost, he said, by the Duke’s cowardice, and the Queen of\r\nScots had sent to urge him to behave valiantly. But valour was no part\r\nof wretched Norfolk’s nature. A few days before the Duke was lodged in\r\nthe Tower, an envoy of the northern Earls, headed by Northumberland, came\r\nto De Spes, promising to raise and capture the north country, release\r\nMary, restore the Catholic religion, and return unconditionally all the\r\nSpanish property seized. They only asked in return that a few Spanish\r\nharquebussiers should be sent; and they dropped Norfolk out of their\r\nprogramme, looking to the Spaniards to provide a fit husband for Mary.\r\n“Whilst Cecil governs here, no good course can be expected, and the\r\nDuke of Norfolk says that he wished to get him out of the government\r\nand change the guard of the Queen of Scotland before taking up arms. It\r\nis thought they will not dare to take the Duke to the Tower, though in\r\nthis they may be deceived, because they who now rule are Protestants,\r\nand most of them creatures of Cecil.” The Secretary’s attitude in this\r\nmatter has been treated somewhat at length, because it happens that\r\nmaterial exists which shows conclusively how bitter and unjust were his\r\nenemies towards him, and how impossible it is to accept, without full\r\nexamination, statements to his detriment, made even by men who were in\r\ndaily communication with him.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of October the Catholic ferment in the north reached its\r\nheight. The Queen had summoned Northumberland and Westmoreland, and they\r\nrefused to obey. Without waiting for the Spanish aid for which they\r\nhad stipulated, they entered Durham with 5000 foot and 1000 horse, and\r\nproclaimed the restoration of the Catholic faith. Cecil himself, giving\r\nan account of the rising to Norris,[310] says, “They have in their\r\ncompany priests of their faction, who, to please the people thereabouts,\r\ngive them masses, and some such trash as the spoils and wastes where they\r\nhave been.” Smashing communion-tables and devastating Protestant houses\r\nas they went, they advanced to Doncaster; but the Government had long\r\nforeseen the affair, and were ready to cope with it. Mary was hurried\r\noff, strongly guarded, to Coventry, out of the reach of the rebels. Lord\r\nDarcy repulsed one band; the Earl of Sussex, president of the north,\r\nheld York against the main body; the wardens of the marches were well\r\nprepared and provided by Cecil’s foresight, and the country people in the\r\ngreat towns of the north were intimidated into quietude. On the 24th\r\nDecember, Cecil could write: “Thank God, our northern rebellion is fallen\r\nflat to the ground and scattered away.[311] The Earls are fled into\r\nNorthumberland, seeking all ways to escape, but they are roundly pursued,\r\nby Sir John Forster and Sir Henry Percy in one company, and Lord Sussex\r\nin another. The 16th December they broke up their sorry army, the 18th\r\nentered Northumberland, the 19th into the mountains; they scattered all\r\ntheir footmen, willing them to shift for themselves; and of a thousand\r\nhorsemen there are left but five hundred. By this time they must be\r\nfewer, and, I trust, either taken or fled into Scotland, where the Earl\r\nof Murray is in good readiness to chase them to their ruin.”[312]\r\n\r\nSo ended, ignominiously, the only important armed revolt against\r\nElizabeth in England, but the first of a long series of plots against\r\nthe peace and independence of the nation, by which Mary Stuart from her\r\ncaptivity, English Catholics who prized their faith more than their\r\ncountry, and Spain and the Guises, for their own national or dynastic\r\nends, sought to bend the neck of England once again to the yoke which the\r\nstatecraft of Elizabeth and her great minister had enabled her to shake\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n1570-1572\r\n\r\n\r\nAt no time since her accession had Elizabeth and her government been in\r\nso much danger as immediately after the suppression of the rebellion of\r\nthe north. Cecil had known that the Catholic English and Scottish nobles\r\nand Mary were in constant communication with Spain and the Pope, but\r\neven he was not aware how widespread was the conspiracy.[313] Orange in\r\nthe Netherlands, and Coligny in France, had for a time been crushed;\r\nCondé had been killed in battle; and everywhere the Catholic cause was\r\ntriumphant. This was the eventuality which alone England had to fear;\r\nand although Spanish aid to the English Catholics was neither so active\r\nnor so abundant as has usually been assumed, unquestionably the hopes\r\nand promises held out both by Philip and the Pope had raised the spirits\r\nof the Catholics in England and Scotland higher than they had been for\r\nmany years. Spanish money and support under papal auspices kept Ireland\r\nin a state of discord, as we have seen; Mary appealed to King Philip\r\nas a vassal to her suzerain; the Guisan agents were busy plotting with\r\nthe Hamiltons and Murray’s enemies on the Border, and the whole north\r\nof England was riddled with religious discontent. Cecil wrote at the\r\nbeginning of 1570 to Norris: “We have discovered some tokens, and we hear\r\nof some words uttered by the Earl of Northumberland, that maketh us think\r\nthis rebellion had more branches, both of our own and strangers, than did\r\nappear, and I trust the same will be found out, though perchance when all\r\nare known in secret manner, all may not be notified.”\r\n\r\nThe truth of Cecil’s forebodings came soon afterwards. On the 22nd\r\nFebruary 1570, Murray was shot by a Hamilton in the streets of\r\nLinlithgow, and in the anarchy which followed, the friends of Mary\r\nStuart on the Scottish Border invaded England. Maitland of Lethington\r\nand others who had hitherto stood firmly by Murray, now turned to the\r\nside of the Hamiltons and the French party; whilst a special French\r\nGuisan envoy boldly demanded of Elizabeth, in the name of the King of\r\nFrance, Mary Stuart’s release, permission for himself to pass into\r\nScotland, and a pledge from the English Queen that in future she would\r\nrefrain from supporting the Huguenots. Papal emissaries whispered at\r\nfirst that the Pope had excommunicated “the flagitious pretended Queen\r\nof England”; and then one Catholic, bolder than the rest (Felton), dared\r\npublicly to post the bull on the Bishop of London’s door. The Bishop\r\nof Ross was tireless in spreading the view of Mary’s innocence and\r\nunmerited sufferings,[314] and many Englishmen who were opposed to her\r\nin everything were scandalised at her continued captivity. So strong a\r\nProtestant as Sir Henry Norris, the English Ambassador in Paris—for ever\r\nthe butt of French remonstrance against Mary’s imprisonment—advised Cecil\r\nto have her released. But Sir William knew better the risk of such a step\r\nnow, and replied, “Surely few here amongst us conceive it feasible with\r\nsurety,” and he was right. Stories, too, came from Flanders of plans to\r\nassassinate Elizabeth; but she was never so strong or wise as when the\r\ncircumstances were difficult and dangerous. “I know not,” writes Cecil,\r\n“by what means, but her Majesty is not much troubled with the opinion\r\nof danger; nevertheless I and others cannot be but greatly fearful for\r\nher, and do, and will do, all that in us may lie to understand by God’s\r\nassistance the attempts.”\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Cecil had once more triumphed over his enemies\r\non the Council and in England: the danger that then threatened was from\r\nwithout. Again, the policy of disabling the foreign Catholics by aiding\r\nthe Protestants was resorted to. Killigrew was kept busy in Germany\r\narranging with Hans Casimir and other mercenary leaders, to raise large\r\nforces for the purpose of entering France and enabling the Huguenots to\r\navenge their disasters.[315] Cardinal Chatillon was still a welcome\r\nguest at the English court. The privateers in the Channel were stronger\r\nand bolder than ever, and had practically swept Spanish shipping from\r\nthe narrow seas. The Flemings were encouraged with promises of help and\r\nsupport when Orange had once more organised a force to cope with Alba.\r\nSussex and Hunsdon in the meanwhile did not let the grass grow under\r\ntheir feet, but harried both sides of the Border, stamping out the last\r\nembers of rebellion, and striking terror into the Catholic fugitives,\r\nwhilst Morton and the Protestant party were consolidating their position,\r\nmomentarily shaken by the murder of Murray.[316] De Spes was ceaselessly\r\nclamouring to the King and Alba for armed intervention in England before\r\nit was too late. Mary might be captured by a _coup de main_, as she\r\nherself suggested, and carried to Spain; a few troops sent to Scotland\r\nnow, said the Bishop of Ross, might overturn the new Regency; a small\r\nforce in Ireland would easily expel the heretics; “and the whole nation\r\nwill rise as soon as they see your Majesty’s standard floating over ships\r\non their coast.”\r\n\r\nBut Alba distrusted both French and English, Protestants and Catholics\r\nalike. He knew that the conflagration in the Netherlands was still all\r\naglow beneath the surface, and he dared not plunge into war with England.\r\nHis slow master pondered and plotted, beset with cares and poverty, and\r\nunable to wreak his vengeance upon England until he had the certainty of\r\nMary Stuart’s exclusive devotion to his interests. But the extent and\r\ncomplexity of Philip’s difficulties were only known to himself, and the\r\ndanger appeared to Cecil even greater than it was.\r\n\r\nThe plague had raged in London for the whole of the summer of 1569, and a\r\nrecrudescence of it in the following June gave Cecil a good opportunity\r\nfor advocating Norfolk’s partial enlargement. The Duke made a most\r\nsolemn renunciation of his proposed marriage with Mary, and craved\r\nElizabeth’s forgiveness; and at length in August was allowed to retire\r\nto his own house. That he owed his liberation to Cecil is clear from\r\nhis letters. At the beginning of July, apparently, some person—probably\r\nLeicester—had told the Duke that Cecil was against him, and the Secretary\r\nshowed him how false this was, and proposed to take action against his\r\nslanderers. The Duke in reply thanked him for his friendly dealing and\r\nhis frank explanation, “which have sufficiently purged him (Cecil) and\r\nlaid the fault on those who deserved it.” But he begged him to refrain\r\nfrom further action, as it might cause mischief.[317] When Norfolk at\r\nlength was “rid of yonder pestylent infectyous hows” (the Tower), he\r\nunhesitatingly attributed his release to Cecil. How busy the slanderers\r\nof the Secretary were, and how deeply he felt the wounds they dealt him,\r\nmay be seen in another statement in his own hand of the same period[318]\r\n(July 1570), which contains an indignant denial of the reports that\r\nhad been spread with regard to his alleged dishonest dealing with the\r\nproperty of his ward the Earl of Oxford.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of Norfolk’s stay in the Tower and afterwards, the\r\nlove-letters between him and Mary continued, the Queen signing her\r\nletters “your own faithful to death,” and using many similar terms of\r\nendearment;[319] and Cecil could hardly have been entirely ignorant\r\nof the Duke’s bad faith. But for political reasons it was considered\r\nnecessary, not only to conciliate him, but Mary and the Spaniards as\r\nwell. Concurrently, therefore, with the negotiations for Norfolk’s\r\nrelease, a show of willingness was made to come to terms with Mary.\r\nHer presence in England was an embarrassment and a danger, and now\r\nthat Murray was dead, the principal personal obstacle to her return\r\nhad disappeared. If she could be so tied down as to be used as a means\r\nfor pacifying Scotland, whilst depending for the future entirely\r\nupon England, her return to her country would relieve Elizabeth of a\r\ndifficulty. The first basis of negotiation was the surrender of the\r\nEnglish rebel Lords in exchange for her, and the delivery to England of\r\nfour or six of the principal Scottish nobles and the young Prince as\r\nhostages. But these terms were by no means acceptable to Mary’s agents or\r\nto herself. She feared that the Scots would kill her, and the English her\r\nson, and so secure the joint kingdoms to a nominee of Elizabeth or Cecil.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for Elizabeth’s change of attitude must be sought in the\r\npanic which seized upon England in the early summer of 1570. A powerful\r\nSpanish fleet was in the Channel, ostensibly to convey Philip’s fourth\r\nwife, Anne of Austria, from Flanders to Spain; but rumours came that\r\nthe dreaded Duke of Alba was ready now for the invasion of England. The\r\nGuises in Normandy, too, were said to have an army of harquebussiers\r\nwaiting to embark for Scotland; the Irish rebels were being helped both\r\nby Philip and the Guises. The Pope’s bull absolving Englishmen from their\r\noaths of allegiance was the talk everywhere, and English merchants in\r\ndespair cried that at last they and their country were to pay for the\r\ndepredations of the pirates. The French were demanding haughtily that the\r\nEnglish troops should evacuate the Border Scottish fortresses held by\r\nthem, and the Protestants in France and Flanders were not yet prepared to\r\nfurnish the diversion upon which the English usually depended for their\r\nown safety.\r\n\r\nThe position was very grave in appearance, though not so great in\r\nreality, and it alarmed Elizabeth out of her equanimity. De Guaras says\r\nthat she shut herself up for three days, and railed against Cecil for\r\nbringing her to such a pass; and the same observer reports that when\r\nCecil one day in the middle of July left the Queen and retired to his\r\nown apartment, he cried to his wife in deep distress, “O wife! if God do\r\nnot help us we shall be lost and undone. Get together all the jewels and\r\nmoney you can, that you may follow me when the time comes; for surely\r\ntrouble is in store for us.”[320] This may or may not be true in detail,\r\nand also Guaras’ assertion that Cecil had sent large private funds to\r\nGermany, whither he would retire in case of trouble; but it is certain\r\nthat panic reigned supreme for a few weeks in the summer, accentuated,\r\ndoubtless, by the plague which was devastating the country. But fright\r\ndid not paralyse the minister for long, if at all. Twenty-five ships\r\nwere hastily armed, two fresh armies were raised of five thousand men\r\neach, ostensibly for Scotland. Mary was prompted to send Livingston to\r\nScotland to negotiate an arrangement with the Regent Lennox, and Cecil\r\nhimself, with Sir Walter Mildmay, was induced to go and confer with\r\nMary at Chatsworth; but, says De Spes, “all these things are simply\r\ntricks of Cecil’s, who thinks thereby to cheat every one, in which to a\r\ncertain extent he succeeds.” The Secretary had by this time discovered\r\nthat in any case neither Philip nor Alba would raise a finger to avenge\r\na slight upon De Spes, for he had imprisoned him and distressed him in\r\na thousand ways already without retaliation. At the same time, a blow\r\nat such a notorious conspirator as he was could not fail to produce\r\na great effect upon the English Catholics who plotted with him and\r\nlooked to Spain alone for support. Cecil therefore sent Fitzwilliams\r\nto Flanders about the seizures, and instructed him to complain to\r\nAlba of De Spes’ communications with the rebels. “His object,” wrote\r\nthe Ambassador, “is to expel me, now that they think I understand the\r\naffairs of this country; and Cecil thinks that I, with others, might\r\nmake such representations to the Queen as would diminish his great\r\nauthority.… Cecil is a crafty fox, a mortal enemy of the Catholics and\r\nto our King, and it is necessary to watch his designs very closely,\r\nbecause he proceeds with the greatest caution and dissimulation. There\r\nis nothing in his power he does not attempt to injure us. The Queen’s\r\nown opinion is of little importance, and that of Leicester less; so that\r\nCecil unrestrainedly and arrogantly governs all.… Your worship may be\r\ncertain that if Cecil is allowed to have his way he will disturb the\r\nNetherlands.”[321] De Spes’ information was correct on the latter point,\r\nas well it might be, for in addition to Cecil’s own secretary, Allington,\r\nhe had in his pay Sir James Crofts, a member of the Council, and the\r\nSecretary of the Council, Bernard Hampton, who between them brought him\r\nnews of everything that passed in the Council or in Cecil House.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary’s efforts to get rid of so troublesome a guest as De Spes,\r\nand to offer an object-lesson to the English Catholics at the same time,\r\nwere persistent, and in the end successful. De Spes was refused the\r\ntreatment of an ambassador, threatened with the Tower, flouted, slighted,\r\nand insulted at every turn; but he could only futilely storm and fret,\r\nfor neither his King nor Alba was pleased with the difficult position\r\nwhich his violence had created for them in England. It was all the fault\r\nof Cecil personally, insisted De Spes. He wished to afflict the Catholic\r\ncause without witnesses, and would stick at nothing, even poison, to get\r\nrid of the Spaniard.\r\n\r\nCecil would have liked to avoid his mission to Mary Stuart, for he\r\nwas almost crippled with constant gout, and he was fully aware of\r\nthe hollowness of the negotiations in hand. The interviews with Mary\r\ncould hardly have been agreeable, although they were carried out with\r\ngreat formality and politeness on both sides. Cecil charged her with\r\na knowledge of the northern rebellion, which she only partly denied,\r\nsaying, however, that she did not encourage it. Mary seems to have been\r\nalternately passionate and tearful; but her bad adviser, the Bishop of\r\nRoss, was by her side, and though she argued her case shrewdly, she\r\ncould not refrain from unwisely and unnecessarily wounding Elizabeth at\r\nthe outset.[322] In the second article of the proposed treaty, where\r\nElizabeth’s issue were to be preferred in the succession, Mary altered\r\nthe words to “lawful issue,” to which Elizabeth, although acceding to it,\r\nreplied that Mary “measured other folk’s disposition by her own actions.”\r\nAfter some acrimony on the subject of other alterations on behalf of\r\nMary, an arrangement was arrived at, which, however, was afterwards\r\nvetoed by the Scottish Government,[323] at the instance of Morton, who\r\nwas the Commissioner in London.\r\n\r\nWhilst the negotiations with Mary had been progressing, peace had been\r\nsigned between the Huguenots and Charles IX. at St. Germains (August\r\n1570), and the fears of Elizabeth and Cecil were consequently aggravated\r\nat the plans which were known to be promoted by Cardinal Lorraine for\r\nthe marriage of the Duke of Anjou, next brother to the French King, with\r\nthe Queen of Scots. Now that the Montmorencis and the “politicians” had\r\nreconciled parties in France, the danger of such a match became serious\r\nboth to England and the sincere Huguenots. Anjou posed as the figurehead\r\nof the extreme Catholic party, but was known to be vaguely ambitious and\r\nunstable. Cardinal Chatillon therefore thought it would be a good move\r\nto disarm him by yoking him under Huguenot auspices to Elizabeth. The\r\nfirst approach was made by the Vidame de Chartres to Cecil, who privately\r\ndiscussed it with the Queen. They must have regarded it with favour, for\r\nit was exactly the instrument they needed for splitting the league, and\r\narousing jealousy between France and Spain. The Emperor had just given a\r\nsevere rebuff to attempts to revive the Archduke’s match with Elizabeth,\r\nbut the negotiation for making a French Catholic prince King-consort of\r\nEngland under Huguenot control was a master-stroke which sufficed to\r\noverturn all international combinations, set France and Spain by the\r\nears, turned the Guises, as relatives of Mary Stuart, against their\r\nprincipal supporter in France, and reduced the Queen of Scots herself to\r\nquite a secondary element in the problem. The idea was just as welcome\r\nto Catharine de Medici, who hated Mary Stuart as much as she dreaded the\r\nGuises. Both she and the young King would have been glad to be quit of\r\nthe ambitious Anjou, who always threw in his weight on the Catholic side,\r\nand made it more difficult for the Queen-mother to hold the balance. So,\r\nvery soon Guido Cavalcanti was speeding backwards and forwards between\r\nEngland and France, secretly preparing the way for the more formal\r\nnegotiations between the official Ambassadors.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Queen of England was concerned, the negotiation was purely\r\npolitical and insincere, for the reasons just stated, but the comedy\r\nwas well played by all parties. Leicester of course was favourable, for\r\nit meant bribes to him, and there was no danger. La Mothe Fénélon, the\r\nAmbassador, gently broached the matter to the Queen at Hampton Court\r\nin January 1571. As usual she was coy and coquettish. She was too old\r\nfor Anjou, she objected, but still she said the princes of the House\r\nof France had the reputation of being good husbands.[324] Cardinal\r\nChatillon shortly afterwards was blunter than the Ambassador. Would the\r\nQueen marry Anjou if he proposed? he asked, to which Elizabeth replied,\r\nthat on certain conditions she would; and the next day she submitted the\r\nsubject to her Council, who, as in duty bound, threw the whole of the\r\nresponsibility on to the Queen.\r\n\r\nWalsingham had just replaced Norris as Ambassador to France. He was a\r\nfriend of Leicester, a strict Protestant, who had been indoctrinated in\r\nthe political methods of Cecil, with whom and with Leicester he kept up\r\na close confidential correspondence.[325] One of his first letters to\r\nLeicester gives a personal description of the young Prince, in which a\r\ndesire to tell the truth struggles with his duty not to say anything\r\nwhich may hamper the negotiation. The Guises and the Spanish party in\r\nParis exhorted Anjou to avoid being drawn into the net, and the Duke\r\nhimself at one time openly used insulting expressions towards Elizabeth;\r\nbut such was the position in England that it was absolutely necessary\r\nthat an appearance of reality should be given to the affair. Prudent\r\nCecil, as usual, avoided pledging himself personally more than necessary,\r\nand wrote from Greenwich to Walsingham on the 3rd March, that he had\r\nwished the Queen herself to write her instructions, but as she had\r\ndeclined to do so, he merely repeated her words in a postscript—namely,\r\nthat if he (Walsingham) were approached on the matter of the marriage, he\r\nmight say that before he left England he had heard “that the Queen, upon\r\nconsideration of the benefit of her realm, and to content her subjects,\r\nhad resolved to marry if she should find a fit husband, who must be\r\nof princely rank.” To this Cecil himself adds as his private opinion,\r\nto be told to no one, “I am not able to discern what is best, but\r\nsurely I see no continuance of her quietness without a marriage.”[326]\r\nMatters were indeed critical at this juncture, and Cecil, Leicester,\r\nand even Walsingham, repeatedly, and apparently with sincerity, stated\r\ntheir opinion that Elizabeth would be forced to wed Anjou, or he would\r\nmarry Mary Stuart, as it was necessary for Catharine de Medici and the\r\nHuguenots to get rid of this fanatical figurehead of the extreme Catholic\r\nparty.[327]\r\n\r\nIn his letter to Walsingham of 1st March, Cecil signs his name thus, “By\r\nyour assured (as I was wont) William Cecil;” and then underneath, “And as\r\nI am now ordered to write, William Burleigh.”[328] That the title was not\r\nof his own seeking is almost certain. The Spanish Ambassador, De Spes,\r\nsays that the Queen ennobled him in order that he might be more useful\r\nin Parliament and in the matter of the Queen of Scots; and the new Lord\r\nhimself, in a letter to Nicholas White, speaks thus slightingly of his\r\nnew honour: “My style is Lord of Burghley if you mean to know it for your\r\nwriting, and if you list to write truly, the poorest Lord in England.\r\nYours, not changed in friendship, though in name, William Burghley.” To\r\nWalsingham again he wrote on the 25th March, “My style of my poor degree\r\nis Lord of Burghley;” and on the 14th April in a letter to the same\r\ncorrespondent he signs, “William Cecill—I forgot my new word, William\r\nBurleigh.”\r\n\r\nAt the time of his elevation the new Lord was suffering from one of his\r\nconstantly recurring fits of gout, and his letters are mostly written,\r\nwith pain and difficulty, which he frequently mentions, “from my bed\r\nin my house at Westminster.” And yet, withal, the amount of work he\r\ngot through at the time was nothing short of marvellous. Every matter,\r\ngreat and small, seemed to be dealt with by him. He was a Member of\r\nParliament for the two counties of Lincoln and Northampton;[329] as\r\nChancellor of the University of Cambridge he was deeply interested in\r\nthe interminable disputes there with regard to ritual, vestments, and\r\nscholastic questions; as President of the Court of Wards he attended\r\npersonally to an immense number of estates and private interests;[330]\r\nand acquaintances, high and low, from Greys, Howards, Clintons, and\r\nDudleys, down to poor students or alien refugees, still by common accord\r\naddressed their petitions for aid and advice to him. To judge by their\r\ngrateful acknowledgments, they seem rarely to have appealed to him in\r\nvain, and it is evident by the hundreds of such letters at Hatfield, that\r\neven when petitions could not be granted, they were assured of impartial\r\nand just consideration from Lord Burghley. His own great establishments,\r\ntoo, at Burghley, Theobalds, and London, must have claimed much of his\r\nattention, for all accounts passed under his own eyes, and in such small\r\nmatters as the rotation of crops, the sale of produce, the breeding\r\nof stock, and the replenishment of gardens, nothing was done without\r\nconsultation with the master. His hospitality was very great; for we are\r\ntold by his domestic biographer that “he kept open house everywhere,\r\nand his steward kept a standing table for gentlemen, besides two other\r\nlong tables, often twice set out, one for the clerk of the kitchen, and\r\nthe other for yeomen.” He personally can have had but little enjoyment\r\nfrom his splendid houses and stately living. He must have been almost\r\nconstantly at court, or hard at work at his house in Cannon Row,\r\nWestminster, handy for Whitehall, rather than at his new palace in the\r\nStrand, where his wife and family lodged. He seems to have had no hobby\r\nbut books and gardens, and to have taken no exercise except on his rare\r\nvisits to Theobalds or Burghley, when he would jog round his garden paths\r\non an ambling mule.\r\n\r\nThis was the man, vigilant, prudent, moderate, cautious and untiring in\r\nhis industry, who in the spring and summer of 1571 by his consummate\r\nstatecraft once more brought England out of the coil of perils which\r\nsurrounded her on all sides. His counter-move to Spanish support to the\r\nrebels in England and Ireland, and to Guisan plots in Scotland, was to\r\nsupply arms, munitions, and money to the Protestants of Rochelle and the\r\nDutch privateers, and to fit out a strong English fleet. The pacification\r\nof France and the crushing of reform in Flanders were answered by\r\nremittances of money to Germany to raise mercenaries for Orange, and the\r\nwelcoming of Louis of Nassau and Cardinal Chatillon in England; whilst\r\nthe marriage of Charles IX. to an Austrian Princess, and the closer\r\nrelations between France and the Catholic league, were counteracted by\r\nthe marriage negotiations between Elizabeth and Anjou, and the treaty\r\nwith Mary Stuart for her restoration.\r\n\r\nBut as the effect of Cecil’s diplomacy gradually became apparent, the\r\nmore reckless of his opponents resorted to desperate devices to frustrate\r\nhim. Already, by February 1571, Mary Stuart had convinced herself that\r\nthe treaty for her liberation was fallacious, and she wrote an important\r\nletter to the Bishop of Ross, from which great events sprang.[331] She\r\nrefers to plans for her escape, and announces her decision to go to\r\nSpain, throwing herself in future entirely upon Philip as her protector;\r\nand she urges that Ridolfi should be sent to Spain and Rome to explain\r\nher situation and resolve, and to beg for help. Norfolk was to be asked\r\nto pledge himself finally to become a Catholic; doubt as to his religion,\r\nshe says, having been the principal reason for Philip’s lukewarmness.\r\nThe Bishop sent a copy of the letter to Norfolk, who was still nominally\r\nunder arrest. The Duke gave his consent, and Ridolfi started from England\r\nat the end of March. It has been frequently denied that Norfolk connived\r\nat this proposal for the invasion of England by a foreign power; but,\r\nin addition to the depositions of Ross and Barker,[332] the following\r\nletter from De Spes introducing Ridolfi to Philip appears to settle the\r\nquestion against the Duke:[333] “The Queen of Scots, and the Duke of\r\nNorfolk on behalf of many other lords and gentlemen who are attached to\r\nyour Majesty’s interests, and the promotion of the Catholic religion, are\r\nsending Rodolfo Ridolfi, a Florentine gentleman, to offer their services\r\nto your Majesty, and to represent to you that the time is now ripe to\r\ntake a step of great benefit to Christianity, as in detail Ridolfi will\r\nset forth to your Majesty. The letter of credence from the Duke of\r\nNorfolk is written in the cipher that I have sent to Zayas, for fear it\r\nshould be taken. London, 25th March, 1571.” The exact proposal to be made\r\nverbally by Ridolfi is not stated, but De Spes refers to it in his next\r\nletter as “the real remedy” for Lord Burghley’s activity. It is probable\r\nthat not only the support of Mary and Norfolk was intended, but also the\r\nassassination of Elizabeth and her minister.[334] Cecil had been put\r\nupon the alert by the kidnapping in Flanders and bringing to England of\r\nthe notorious Dr. Storey, who, under torture in the Tower, had divulged\r\nthe dealings of the northern Lords with Alba through Ridolfi and the\r\nBishop of Ross. This caused Cecil to keep a watch upon the doings of\r\nboth the agents; and Lord Cobham, in Dover, was instructed to intercept\r\nany cipher letters which might be brought by a Flemish secretary of the\r\nBishop of Ross, one Charles Bailly, who was with Ridolfi in Flanders.\r\nThe man was stopped and his papers captured, with some copies of the\r\nBishop of Ross’s book in favour of Mary’s claims. The Cobhams were never\r\nto be trusted; and Thomas Cobham surreptitiously obtained the cipher\r\nkeys, and had them conveyed to De Spes, substituting for them a dummy\r\npacket, which was sent to Cecil. But Bailly himself, who had written\r\nthe papers at Ridolfi’s dictation, was promptly put on the rack in the\r\nTower, and confessed that the letters were written to two persons,\r\ndesignated by numbers, under cover to the Bishop, and conveyed the Duke\r\nof Alba’s approval of the plan for invading England, and his readiness,\r\nif authorised by his King, to co-operate with the persons indicated.\r\n\r\nLetters sent by the Bishop to Bailly after his arrest, urging him to\r\nfirmness, threatening the traitor who had betrayed him, and in a hundred\r\nways proving his own complicity, were all intercepted and read. The\r\ntortured wretch swore to the Bishop that he would tell nothing, even if\r\nthey tore him into a hundred pieces; begged that his trunk containing\r\ndrafts of letters from Mary to Cardinal Lorraine and Hamilton might be\r\nrescued from his lodging. But Burghley forestalled them all. The whole\r\nof the letters were taken, and every day, in the Tower, fresh rackings,\r\nand threats to cut off his ears or his head, were used by Burghley\r\nto the frightened lad, to force him to give a key of the cipher. One\r\nmorning at five o’clock he was carried by the Lieutenant of the Tower\r\nto Lord Burghley, and was told that, unless he immediately confessed\r\nall, he would be racked till the truth was torn from him. The lad, half\r\ndistraught, day by day unfolded as much as he knew, notwithstanding the\r\nBishop’s frantic assurances that Burghley would not dare to harm him\r\nmuch, as he was a foreigner and a servant of the Queen of Scots.[335]\r\nAnd so, piece by piece, the whole conspiracy was unravelled so far as\r\nregarded the main object, and the complicity of Alba, the Spaniards and\r\nthe Bishop of Ross proved beyond doubt; but still the persons indicated\r\nby the cipher numbers “30” and “40” could only be surmised, for Bailly\r\nhimself did not know them. Gradually the names of Mary Stuart and Norfolk\r\ncrept into the depositions of those examined, but without sufficient\r\ndefiniteness yet for open proceedings against them to be commenced.\r\n\r\nWhilst Lord Burghley, with inexhaustible patience, was tracking the\r\nplot to its source, the most elaborate pretence of agreement with the\r\nFrench on the subject of the Anjou match was kept up both in Paris and\r\nLondon; though more sincere on the part of the former than the latter,\r\nfor Catharine and Charles IX. were in mortal fear of the Guises, the\r\nLeague, and the heir-presumptive to the crown. Cavalcanti and officers of\r\nthe King’s household ran backwards and forwards to England with loving\r\nmessages; and the Huguenots worked their best to bring the matter to\r\na successful issue, or, in default of it, for a close alliance. Henry\r\nCobham was sent to Madrid ostensibly to treat on the matter of the\r\nseizures, but really to learn, if possible, how far Philip was pledged to\r\nthe plans against England; but the Spaniards were forewarned and ready\r\nfor him, and he learned nothing.\r\n\r\nLord Burghley had, however, a better plan than this. Fitzwilliam, a\r\nrelative of the English Duchess of Feria, had been sent to Spain by him\r\nfor the purpose of negotiating for the release of the men and hostages\r\nwho had been captured from Hawkins at San Juan de Ulloa. He professed\r\nin Spain to be strongly Catholic and in favour of Mary Stuart, and came\r\nback to England in 1571, with presents, pledges, and promises to the\r\ncaptive Queen and her friends. Hawkins lay with a strong auxiliary fleet\r\nat the mouth of the Channel, and it was agreed with Lord Burghley that\r\nFitzwilliam and Hawkins should hoodwink the Spaniards, obtain a good haul\r\nfor themselves, and at the same time trace the ramifications of the great\r\ninternational plot against England. De Spes jumped at the bait, with but\r\na mere qualm of misgiving, when Fitzwilliam went and offered, on behalf\r\nof Hawkins, to desert with all his fleet to Spain, and take part, if\r\nnecessary, in an attack upon England. When he wrote to the King he said,\r\n“My only fear is lest Burghley himself may have set the matter afoot to\r\ndiscover your Majesty’s feelings, though I have seen nothing to make me\r\nthink this.”\r\n\r\nBut it was exactly the case, nevertheless, and the ruse succeeded beyond\r\nexpectation. By the end of August all Hawkins’ men had been released in\r\nSpain and sent back to England, with ten dollars each in their pockets,\r\nand Hawkins himself was the better off by £40,000 of Spanish money. But\r\nmore than this: Burghley had obtained through Fitzwilliam full knowledge\r\nof the aims of the Ridolfi conspiracy. It was clear now to demonstration\r\nthat the Pope,[336] Philip, and the Catholic party in France were pledged\r\nto a vast crusade against England, for crushing Protestantism, destroying\r\nElizabeth,[337] and raising Mary Stuart to the thrones of Great\r\nBritain. Burghley and the Queen had practically known it for months,\r\nas we have seen, and already the diplomatic measures they had taken to\r\ncounteract it were producing their effects. But now that the evidence was\r\nsufficient, the blow against the conspirators could be struck openly. All\r\nunsuspecting still, De Spes was comforting himself with the reflection\r\nthat the capture of Bailly was an unimportant incident; he urged Alba\r\nand the King to immediate action, fumed at the instructions he received\r\nto hold back Philip’s letters to Mary and Norfolk until he had orders to\r\ndeliver them, and sneered at the timid delay. “As all of Lord Burghley’s\r\njests have turned out well for him hitherto, he is ready to undertake\r\nanything, and has no fear of danger. They and the French together make\r\ngreat fun of our meekness.” “It is a pity to lose time, for Lord Burghley\r\nis continuing to oppress the Catholics. If the opportunity is lost this\r\nyear, I fear the false religion will prevail in this island in a way\r\nwhich will make it a harsh neighbour for the Netherlands.”\r\n\r\nThe opportunity, though he did not know it, had been lost already, for\r\nall the threads were now in Burghley’s hands, and he was master of\r\nthe situation. In August was intercepted the bag of money (£600) with\r\na cipher letter[338] being sent secretly to Herries and Kirkaldy of\r\nGrange, Mary’s friends in Scotland, by the Duke of Norfolk’s secretary,\r\nand in a day or two the net swept into the Tower the Duke and all the\r\nunderlings who had served as intermediaries. Burghley lost no time now.\r\nAlmost every day, threats or the rack wrung some fresh admission from\r\nthe instruments—secretaries, messengers, and the like. Norfolk at first,\r\nwith extreme effrontery, denied everything;[339] but he was a weak man,\r\nand soon broke down. Even then De Spes did not see that all was lost.\r\n“The Catholics,” he said, “are many, though their leaders be few, and\r\nLord Burghley, with his terrible fury, has greatly harassed and dismayed\r\nthem, for they are afraid even of speaking to each other. The whole\r\naffair depends upon getting weapons into their hands, and giving them\r\nsome one to direct them.”[340] It was too late. Mary Stuart’s prison\r\nwas made closer; her correspondence was intercepted and read; there was\r\nno more concealment necessary or possible. One Catholic noble after the\r\nother was isolated and imprisoned; Dr. Storey’s dreadful fate was held\r\nup as a warning to traitors, and London and the country was flooded with\r\nbroadsheets calculated to arouse English and Protestant sentiment to\r\nfever heat at the dastardly conspiracy which was laid bare.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th December a message reached De Spes summoning him to the\r\nCouncil at Whitehall. When he arrived there he found them awaiting\r\nhim, with Lord Burghley as spokesman. There was no mincing matters.\r\nThe Ambassador was told that he had plotted with traitors against the\r\nQueen’s life and the peace of the country, and he would be expelled, as\r\nDr. Man had been from Spain with far less reason.[341] De Spes tried to\r\nbrazen it out, but ineffectually. Burghley was on firm ground: no delay,\r\nhe said, could be allowed, excepting the time absolutely necessary for\r\nthe preparations for the voyage, which time was to be passed out of\r\nLondon.[342] Speechless, almost, with indignation, in pretended fear that\r\nBurghley would have him killed, De Spes was hustled out of the country he\r\nhad sought to ruin, and a week afterwards (16th January 1572) the Duke of\r\nNorfolk was tried by his peers and found guilty of the capital crime of\r\nhigh treason.\r\n\r\nDe Spes left England with bitter resentment at the triumph of Burghley’s\r\ndiplomacy. “They will now,” he says, “make themselves masters of the\r\nChannel, and with one blow, with their practices in Flanders, will\r\nplunge that country into a dreadful war. It is of no use now to speak of\r\nour lost opportunities. They have gone; but … steps may still be taken\r\nto make these people weep in their own country.” When he arrived in\r\nFlanders he made a long report of his embassy, containing the following\r\ninteresting appreciation of Burghley as he appeared to his greatest\r\nenemy: “The principal person in the Council is William Cecil, now Lord\r\nBurghley, a Knight of the Garter. He is a man of mean sort, but very\r\nastute, false, lying, and full of artifice. He is a great heretic, and\r\nsuch a clownish Englishman as to believe that all the Christian princes\r\njoined together are not able to injure the sovereign of his country,\r\nand he therefore treats their ministers with great arrogance. This man\r\nmanages the bulk of the business, and by means of his vigilance and\r\ncraftiness, together with his utter unscrupulousness of word and deed,\r\nthinks to outwit the ministers of other princes, which to some extent he\r\nhas hitherto succeeded in doing.”\r\n\r\nBefore De Spes was expelled, the efforts of Burghley, Walsingham, and\r\nDe Foix had been successful in arranging the terms of a close political\r\nalliance between France and England. Elizabeth swore to Cavalcanti that\r\nshe would never trust Spaniards again, and he might see how little she\r\ncared for the King of Spain by the way she had treated his Ambassador.\r\nShe could, indeed, afford now to slight the most powerful monarch in the\r\nworld; for one of the counter-strokes to the Spanish-Papal plot had been\r\nthe concentration in the Channel of a great fleet of Flemish and Huguenot\r\nprivateers under the Count de la Mark, and during the winter a plan had\r\nbeen perfected for the seizure by the “beggars” of Brille, the key to\r\nZeeland. The imposition in Flanders of the tax which ruined Spain had\r\nbeen the last straw,[343] and the whole country was ripe for revolt. For\r\nsome time an arrangement had been in progress with Louis of Nassau, by\r\nwhich the Huguenots should invade Flanders over the French frontier, in\r\nthe interest of the Flemish Protestants. However friendly Elizabeth might\r\nbe with France, this was a proceeding which was sure to be looked upon\r\nby English statesmen with profound distrust; and Walsingham, writing to\r\nCecil on the last day of 1571,[344] says that he has been asked whether,\r\nin the event of the French entering Flanders, the Queen of England will\r\ntake Zeeland, as the Flemings fear that the French may not be contented\r\nwith Flanders. Some time before this, in September, Walsingham had urged\r\nCecil to promote this invasion of Flanders by the French, as a means of\r\nkeeping the Huguenots in power, as well as embarrassing Spain. “If not,”\r\nhe says, “the Guises will bear sway, who will be so forward in preferring\r\nthe conquest of Ireland, and the advancement of their niece to the crown\r\nof England, as the other side (_i.e._ the Huguenots) is contrariwise\r\nbent to prefer the conquest of Flanders.” When the immediate danger from\r\nthe Guises was over, however, the idea of a French invasion of Flanders\r\ncould not be calmly endured without some corresponding move in English\r\ninterests, and joint action in the Netherlands was suggested. It is\r\nassumed by Motley and most other historians that the capture of Brille by\r\nthe “beggars” under La Mark early in April was quite unpremeditated, but\r\nDe Spes warned Alba that the affair was being planned in England at least\r\nsix months before;[345] and the sending away from Dover of La Mark’s\r\nfleet did not, as Motley surmises, arise alone from Elizabeth’s fear of\r\noffending Spain—for that she had already done—but from the complaints\r\nof the Easterling merchants that their trade with England had become\r\nimpossible whilst these freebooters of the seas lay off the coast. In any\r\ncase, the surprise and seizure of Brille by the “beggars” once more gave\r\nAlba plenty to think about on his own side of the Straits; and England\r\nmight, for the present, breathe freely again.\r\n\r\nIt had been as necessary for Catharine de Medici as for Elizabeth to\r\nprovide against the complete domination of England and Scotland by a\r\nSpanish-Papal conspiracy in favour of Mary Stuart, and she had seconded\r\nWalsingham strenuously in endeavouring to overcome Anjou’s religious\r\nscruples against marrying Elizabeth. Anjou shifted like the wind, as\r\nhe fell under the influence of the Guises and his mother alternately.\r\nSometimes the match looked certain, and Catharine was effusive in\r\nher thanks to Burghley; the next week it appeared hopeless. But the\r\nintrigue served its purpose, and kept the French Government friendly\r\nwith Elizabeth during the critical time of the Spanish-Guisan conspiracy\r\nagainst her—a conspiracy which also threatened Catharine’s influence\r\nin France. Burghley himself seems to have been at a loss to understand\r\nElizabeth’s real intentions at the time; but it would appear that both he\r\nand Walsingham were in earnest in wishing for the Anjou match, of course\r\nwith the safeguards laid down in Cecil’s several minutes on the matter;\r\nbut “the conferences,” wrote the Secretary, “have as many variations as\r\nthere are days.”\r\n\r\nWhen at length it was seen that Anjou would no longer act as a party to\r\nthe game, but was looking to the possibility of a marriage with Mary\r\nStuart or with a Polish princess, the idea of the marriage of Elizabeth\r\nwith his youngest brother, the Duke of Alençon, was again very cautiously\r\nbrought up by Sir Thomas Smith and Killigrew, who were acting as English\r\nAmbassadors in France during Walsingham’s illness. Alençon was only a lad\r\nas yet, and could be used without loss of dignity as a stalking-horse\r\nuntil the treaty of close alliance was finally agreed upon between the\r\ntwo countries. The inevitable Guido Cavalcanti broached the matter\r\nto Burghley in January, as he was coming away from an interview with\r\nElizabeth, and after some conference Burghley himself discussed the\r\nmatter with the Queen. She was thirty-nine, and the suggested bridegroom\r\nwas barely seventeen; but she was full of curiosity as to the looks\r\nof the suitor, and distrustful about their respective ages. She asked\r\nBurghley how tall Alençon was. “About as tall as I am,” replied the\r\nSecretary. “About as tall as your grandson, you mean,” snapped her\r\nMajesty,[346] and so the colloquy ended for a time. On the 19th April\r\n1572 the draft treaty between England and France was signed at Blois.\r\nIt provided that aid was to be given unofficially by both nations to\r\nthe revolted Hollanders; the fleet of Protestant privateers was to be\r\nsheltered and encouraged, and Huguenot Henry of Navarre was to marry the\r\nKing’s sister Margaret. The Protestants and politicians of France had\r\nthus for the moment triumphed all along the line; the connection between\r\nEngland and France was closer than it had been for many years, and\r\nElizabeth and Burghley could look back upon a great peril to their nation\r\nand their faith manfully met and astutely overcome.\r\n\r\nThe Catholic party in England was now utterly prostrate. The Duke of\r\nNorfolk, condemned to death for treason, was respited again and again\r\nby the Queen, whilst he abjectly prevaricated, and threw the blame upon\r\nothers. The Bishop of Ross and Barker, he said, had forsworn him: he\r\nnever meant to bring a foreign force to England to depose the Queen,\r\nand so forth. From the first, Burghley, who had always been Norfolk’s\r\nfriend, urged the Queen to let the law take its course.[347] He has been\r\nbitterly blamed for doing so; but seeing the danger to which Norfolk’s\r\ntreason had reduced the realm, he would have failed in his duty as a\r\nFirst Minister if he had allowed any weakness or personal consideration\r\nto stand in the way of the just punishment for a great crime. Norfolk,\r\nthough he was the most popular man and greatest noble in the realm, and\r\nstill has many apologists, had plotted with the enemies of England to\r\nbring the country again under foreign tutelage for his own ambition, and\r\nit was right that he should suffer.\r\n\r\nThat Burghley did not flinch in the case of a man with so many friends,\r\nis a proof of his rectitude and his courage. Though Norfolk himself\r\nmust have known what his attitude was, his esteem for him was evidently\r\nnot lessened. In the first letter he wrote to the Queen after his\r\ncondemnation, 21st January 1572, he prays for “her Majesty’s forgiveness\r\nfor his manifold offences, that he may leave this vale of misery with\r\na lighter heart and quieter conscience. He desires that Lord Burghley\r\nshould act as guardian to his poor orphans,” and he signs his letter,\r\n“Written by the woeful hand of a dead man, your Majesty’s unworthy\r\nsubject, Thomas Howard”;[348] and when this prayer was granted, he again\r\nwrote to the Queen expressing “his comfort at hearing of her Majesty’s\r\nintended goodness to his unfortunate brats, and that she had christened\r\nthem with such an adopted father as Lord Burghley.”[349] At length, when\r\nParliament had added its pressure to that of her minister’s, the Queen’s\r\nreal or pretended reluctance to execute her near kinsman was overcome,\r\nand the Duke’s head fell on Tower Hill, 2nd June, before the lamentations\r\nof a great populace, who loved him above any subject of the Queen.\r\n\r\nLess than a week afterwards Marshal Montmorenci, Paul de Foix, and\r\na splendid embassy arrived in England for the purpose of formally\r\nratifying the treaty of alliance between England and France, a\r\ncorresponding embassy from England under Lord Lincoln being in France\r\nfor a similar purpose. The courts vied with each other in their splendid\r\nentertainments. The Frenchmen with forty followers were lodged in\r\nSomerset House. At Whitehall, at Windsor (where Montmorenci received the\r\nGarter), at Leicester House, and at Cecil House, sumptuous banquets were\r\ngiven, followed by masques, balls, and tourneys. There was much talk\r\nabout the Duke of Alençon, but no decided answer given by Elizabeth to\r\nthe hints of marriage, which, indeed, was not now so pressing a matter\r\nfor her as it had been. When the Frenchmen had taken leave, Burghley sent\r\nto Walsingham an interesting letter giving some account of the embassy,\r\nby which it is clear that the Queen still desired to keep up the talk\r\nof the marriage, in view of a possible need to draw still closer to the\r\nFrench. “I am willed,” he writes, “to require you to use all good means\r\nto understand what you can of the Duke of Alençon, his age in certainty,\r\nof his stature, his conditions, his inclination in religion, his devotion\r\nthis way, his followers and servitors: hereof her Majesty seeketh\r\nspeedily to be advertised, that she may resolve before the month.” He\r\nsays, that for his part, he can see no great dislike of the idea, except\r\nin the matter of age, and hints at getting Calais as the young Prince’s\r\ndower. “If somewhat be not advised to recompense the opinion that her\r\nMajesty conceiveth, as that she should be misliked to make choice of\r\nso young a prince, I doubt the end.”[350] When, however, Lincoln came\r\nback from France loaded with plate and jewels, and full of praise of the\r\ngallantry of Alençon, the Queen became somewhat warmer, and Walsingham\r\nfor weeks to come was bombarded with minute questions as to the personal\r\nqualities, and particularly as to the pock-marked visage, of the suitor.\r\n\r\nThere was but one more of the great conspirators against England to\r\ndeal with. Norfolk had deservedly died the death of a traitor, and\r\nthose who had supported him were either dead or lingering sufferers in\r\nprison, the disloyal Catholics were despairing, Spain had received its\r\nanswer by the expulsion of De Spes and the renewal of the war in the\r\nNetherlands, whilst Coligny and the Huguenots rode rough-shod over the\r\nGuises and their friends. But the very spring-head of the conspiracy\r\nremained untouched. A commission was appointed in June to formulate\r\ncharges against Mary Stuart herself,[351] and in Parliament it was\r\nresolved that she was unworthy to succeed to the English crown. But\r\nElizabeth again allowed her personal feeling to stand in the way of her\r\npatriotic duty, or, as some would prefer to say, desired to fix upon\r\nothers the responsibility of a grave act against her own order and kin.\r\nBurghley, in his letter already quoted, written at the end of June to\r\nWalsingham, says: “Now for Parliament: I cannot write patiently: all\r\nthat we laboured for, and with full consent brought to fashion, I mean\r\na law to make the Scottish Queen unable and unworthy of succession of\r\nthe crown, was by her Majesty neither assented to nor rejected, but\r\ndeferred until the feast of All Saints; but what all other good and wise\r\nmen think thereof, you may guess. Some here have, as it seemeth, abused\r\ntheir favour about her Majesty, to make herself her most enemy. God amend\r\nthem.”[352]\r\n\r\nA fortnight after this letter was written Burghley was made Lord\r\nTreasurer of England in place of the Marquis of Winchester, who had\r\nrecently died. The work and strain of the Secretaryship had gravely\r\naffected Burghley’s health, and early in the previous April he had been\r\nso ill that his life was despaired of. De Guaras, the merchant who\r\nacted informally as Spanish agent, says that the Queen and most of the\r\nCouncillors visited him, in the belief that his state was desperate.[353]\r\nFor some time he had been begging for permission to rest, but until the\r\ngreat matters in hand were settled, this was impossible. The sky over\r\nEngland had once more become cleared, and the great minister could hand\r\nover to his old friend Sir Thomas Smith the Secretaryship, in which he\r\nhad done such signal service to the State.\r\n\r\nThe day after the elevation of Burghley to the Treasurership, the Queen\r\nstarted on one of the stately progresses which caused so much delight and\r\nenthusiasm to all her subjects but those who had to entertain her, except\r\nperhaps Burghley and his rival Leicester, who were both honoured during\r\nthis summer with a visit from the sovereign. Burghley’s entry of the\r\ngreat event comes curtly enough in his diary after the memorandum of his\r\nnew appointment, thus:—\r\n\r\n“1572. July 15. Lord Burghley made Lord Treasurer of England.”\r\n\r\n“July 22. The Queen’s Majesty at Theobalds.”[354]\r\n\r\nElizabeth had visited Theobalds in 1564 and 1571. On this occasion her\r\nstay extended over three days, and the domestic biographer of Burghley\r\nthus refers to this amongst other visits: “His Lordship’s extraordinary\r\nchardg in enterteynment of the Quene was greater to him than to anie of\r\nher subjects, for he enterteyned her at his house twelve several tymes,\r\nwhich cost him two or three thousand pounds each tyme.… But his love for\r\nhis Sovereign, and joy to enterteyn her and her traine, was so greate, as\r\nhe thought no troble, care, nor cost too much, and all too little.”\r\n\r\nWhilst Elizabeth slowly made her way from one great house to another,\r\nby Gorhambury,[355] Dunstable, Woburn,[356] and so to Kenilworth, the\r\ncorrespondence on the negotiations for the Alençon match became warmer\r\nand warmer. Agents and messengers speeded backwards and forwards with\r\nportraits and amiable trifles, particularly from the side of England.\r\n\r\nThere was a good reason for this. Before even the treaty of alliance\r\nwas signed, Burghley had deplored that Charles IX. and his mother were\r\ncooling in the agreement for France and England jointly to aid the\r\nFlemish rebels. The Pope and the Emperor were trying their hardest to\r\nwithdraw Charles and his mother from the compromise into which he had\r\nentered with Elizabeth; and already the young King and Catharine de\r\nMedici were discovering that Coligny and the Huguenots, when they had\r\nthe upper hand, could be as domineering and tyrannical as the Guises\r\nthemselves. Paris was in seething discontent that the beloved Guises were\r\nin disgrace, and Charles found his throne tottering. To add to his fears\r\nfrom the Catholics, the Huguenot force that had entered Flanders under\r\nGenlis had been routed and destroyed by the Spaniards (19th July), and\r\nit was clear to Catharine and her son, that if they did not promptly cut\r\nthemselves free from Elizabeth’s attack on Spanish interests, they would\r\nbe dragged down when the Huguenots fell. The very day that the news of\r\nGenlis’ defeat arrived in Paris, a young noble named La Mole was sent\r\nflying to England, ostensibly to confer with the Queen on the Alençon\r\nmatch. There was no particular reason for roughly breaking off that,\r\nand so offending Elizabeth; but the sending of a mere schoolboy like La\r\nMole with only vague instructions about the proposed joint action in\r\nFlanders would show that Charles IX. did not intend to take any further\r\nresponsibility in that direction.\r\n\r\nLa Mole arrived in London on 27th July, and had a long midnight\r\ninterview with Burghley at the French Embassy. He ostensibly only came\r\nfrom Alençon—not from the King—and when, a few days afterwards, he saw\r\nthe Queen privately at Kenilworth, though he was full of fine lovelorn\r\ncompliments from Alençon, he could only say from the King that the latter\r\ncould not openly declare himself in the matter of Flanders. He suggested\r\nprudence, and fears of a league of Catholic powers against him. He talked\r\nabout the strength of Portugal and Savoy, and generally cried off from\r\nhis bargain. This was ill news for Elizabeth, for there were hundreds of\r\nEnglishmen in arms in Holland, and brave Sir Humphrey Gilbert and his\r\nband were besieging Ter Goes. But the English Queen made the best of it,\r\nand sought to redress matters by pushing the Alençon match more warmly\r\nthan ever, and petting and caressing La Mole, who accompanied her on her\r\nprogress towards Windsor. Burghley and the experienced Smith seem to have\r\nbeen as firmly convinced as young La Mole himself, that the Queen was in\r\nearnest, and would really, at last, make up her mind to marry Alençon.\r\nIn her conversations with La Mole and Fénélon she smoothed away all\r\ndifficulties. Walsingham had made a great mistake, she said, in declaring\r\nthat Alençon’s youth was an insuperable difficulty; and much more to\r\nthe same effect. But it is curious that all this artless prattle, all\r\nthis coy coquetry of the Queen, so spontaneous in appearance, had in\r\nsubstance been carefully previously drafted by Burghley, and the drafts\r\nare still at Hatfield. Whilst Charles IX. was hesitating and looking\r\naskance at the dominant Huguenots, the latter were assuring Burghley and\r\nWalsingham that all would be well directly. Henry of Navarre was to be\r\nmarried to the Princess Margaret, and this would give them a pretext for\r\ngathering so strong a force of their party that they could make the King\r\ndo as they pleased.[357]\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth and the Huguenots had no monopoly of cunning, and whilst\r\nthe billing and cooing with La Mole went on, the massacre of St.\r\nBartholomew was being secretly planned, and every effort was being made\r\nby the French King to draw England into a position of overt hostility\r\nto Spain, whilst he remained unpledged. The Ambassador, Fénélon, and\r\nyoung La Mole, left the Queen, and returned to London on the 27th\r\nAugust. On the same day there arrived at Rye two couriers from Paris,\r\none from Walsingham to the Queen and Burghley, the other to the French\r\nAmbassador. The French courier was detained, and his papers sent forward\r\nwith Walsingham’s despatches to the Queen. The news of the great crime\r\nof St. Bartholomew fell upon Elizabeth and her court like a death-knell;\r\nfor it seemed that at last the threatened crusade against Protestantism\r\nhad begun, and that England was struck at as well as the Huguenots. All\r\nrejoicings were stopped, mourning garb was assumed, and the gay devices\r\nof masques and mummeries gave way to anxious conferences and plans for\r\ndefence. Affrighted Protestants by the thousand came flying across the\r\nChannel in any craft that would sail; from mouth to mouth in England\r\nran the dreadful story of unprovoked and wanton slaughter, and on\r\nevery side the old English feeling of hatred and distrust of the false\r\nFrenchmen came uppermost again. On the 7th September, La Mothe Fénélon\r\nwas received by the Queen at Woodstock in dead silence, and surrounded\r\nby all the signs of mourning. He made the best of a bad matter: talked\r\nof a plot of Coligny and the Huguenots to seize the Louvre, urged that\r\nthe massacre was unpremeditated, and hoped that the friendship between\r\nFrance and England would continue uninterrupted. But Elizabeth knew that\r\nsuch a friendship could only be a snare for her whilst the Guises were\r\nparamount, and she dismissed the Ambassador with a plain indication of\r\nher opinion.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards Burghley penned a long letter from the Council to\r\nWalsingham, dictating the steps to be taken for the protection of English\r\ninterests; and he accompanied it by a private note, in which the Lord\r\nTreasurer’s own view is frankly set forth. “I see,” he says, “the devil\r\nis suffered by Almighty God for our sins to be strong in following the\r\npersecution of Christ’s members, and therefore we are not only vigilant\r\nof our own defence against such trayterous attempts as lately have been\r\nput in use there in France, but also to call ourselves to repentance.…\r\nThe King assures her Majesty that the navy prepared by Strozzi shall not\r\nin any way endamage her Majestie; but we have great cause in these times\r\nto doubt all fair speeches, and therefore we do presently put all the\r\nsea-coasts in defence, and mean to send her Majesty’s navy to sea with\r\nspeed, and so to continue until we see further whereunto to trust.”[358]\r\n\r\nNot many days after the massacre, Catharine de Medici saw the mistake\r\nshe had made in allowing the Guises a free hand, and she and the King\r\ndid their best by protestations to Walsingham, and through Fénélon and\r\nCastelnau de la Mauvissière, to draw closer to Elizabeth again. Alençon\r\ndid much more. He went to Walsingham, swore vengeance upon the murderers,\r\nand expressed his intention of escaping from court and secretly flying\r\nto England. By an emissary of his own he sent an extravagant love-letter\r\nto the Queen, and ostentatiously took the Huguenot side, whilst Anjou\r\nwas on the side of the League. Elizabeth did not wish to break with\r\nFrance, for her safety once more depended upon avoiding isolation; but\r\nshe was still deeply distrustful. Smith, in sending the Queen’s answer to\r\nWalsingham, quaintly defines her attitude towards the French: “You may\r\nperceive by her Majesty’s answer, that she will not refuse the interview\r\nnor marriage, but yet she cometh near to them _tam timido et suspenso\r\npede_, that they may have good cause to doubt. The answer to De la Mothe\r\nis _addulced_ so much as may, for she would have it so. You have a\r\nbusie piece of work to decypher that which in words is designed to the\r\nextremitie, in deeds is more than manifest; neither you shall open the\r\none, nor shall they cloak the other. The best is, thank God, we stand\r\nupon our guard, nor I trust shall be taken and killed asleep, as Coligny\r\nwas. The greatest matter for her Majestie, and our safety and defence, is\r\nearnestly of us attempted, nor yet achieved, nor utterly in despair, but\r\nrather in hope.”[359]\r\n\r\nFor the next few months this firm attitude of watchfulness was\r\nmaintained, whilst the outward demonstrations of friendship between\r\nCatharine and Elizabeth became gradually more cordial, thanks largely\r\nto the influence in the English court of the special envoy Castelnau\r\nde la Mauvissière. Elizabeth consented to act as sponsor for the French\r\nKing’s infant daughter; Alençon’s envoy, Maisonfleur, with the knowledge\r\nof Burghley, sent to his master a plan for his escape to England with\r\nNavarre and Condé, and assured him that the Queen would marry him if\r\nhe came. But all this diplomatic finesse did not for a moment stay the\r\ngrim determination of the Queen and her Council to provide against\r\ntreachery, from whatever quarter it might come. All along the coast the\r\ncountry stood on guard. Portsmouth, Plymouth, the Thames, and Harwich\r\nwere swarming with shipping, armed to the teeth for the succour of stern\r\nProtestant Rochelle against the Catholics, and to aid the Netherlanders\r\nin their struggle.[360] The Huguenots of Guienne, Languedoc, and Gascony\r\nhad recovered somewhat from the shock of St. Bartholomew, and were\r\narming for their defence; and to them also went English money, arms, and\r\nencouragement. At Elizabeth’s court the Vidame de Chartres and the Count\r\nde Montgomerie were honoured guests and busy agents, whilst in France\r\nthe young Princes of Navarre and Condé were daily being pledged deeper\r\nto the cause of Protestantism and England. The German princes, too, as\r\nprofoundly shocked at the treacherous massacre as Elizabeth herself, drew\r\nnearer to the Queen, who was now regarded throughout Europe as the head\r\nof the Protestant confederacy.\r\n\r\nIt was soon seen that, though St. Bartholomew had given more power to the\r\nGuises, it had also strengthened and consolidated the reformers rather\r\nthan destroyed them. Month after month Anjou, at the head of the Catholic\r\nroyal army, cast his men fruitlessly against the impregnable walls of\r\nRochelle, well supplied as the town was with stores by Montgomerie’s\r\nfleet from England, until at last in the spring of 1573 it was seen by\r\nCatharine and her sons that they had failed to crush the reformers of\r\nFrance, and they were glad to make terms with the heroic Rochellais,\r\nwhere the besiegers, plague-stricken, starving, and disheartened, were in\r\nfar worse case than the beleaguered. Anjou, to his brothers’ and mother’s\r\ndelight, was elected to the vacant throne of Poland, and a full amnesty\r\nwas signed for the Huguenots (June 1573); complete religious liberty\r\nbeing accorded in the towns of Rochelle, Montauban, and Nismes, whilst\r\nprivate Protestant worship was allowed throughout France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n1572-1576\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first effects of the massacre of St. Bartholomew was an\r\napproach on the part of Burghley to the Spanish agent in England. The\r\nobject probably was to keep in touch and to learn what was going on,\r\nwhilst arousing the jealousy of the French, and, above all, to reopen\r\nEnglish trade with Flanders and Spain. In any case, the cordiality of\r\nso great a personage as the Lord Treasurer quite turned the head of\r\nsimple-minded, vain Antonio de Guaras, who suddenly found himself treated\r\nas an important diplomatist, and for the rest of his life tried, but\r\ndisastrously, to live up to the character.[361] Soon after the expulsion\r\nof De Spes, one of Burghley’s agents had opened up communications with De\r\nGuaras, which resulted in an interview between the latter and the Lord\r\nTreasurer. The minister was graciousness itself, and quite dazzled the\r\nmerchant. There was nothing, he assured him, that he desired more than an\r\nagreement with Spain on all points; and though it all came to nothing at\r\nthe time, and shortly afterwards the Flemish Commissioners were curtly\r\ndismissed, a letter was handed to Guaras late in August 1572 to be sent\r\nto Alba, making professions of willingness to negotiate for a reopening\r\nof trade, and to withdraw the English troops from Flanders. Before the\r\nreply came in October the massacre of St. Bartholomew had taken place,\r\nand when De Guaras went to Burghley at Hampton Court with a letter from\r\nAlba he found him all smiles. “The Queen was only remarking yesterday,”\r\nsaid he, “that she wondered Antonio de Guaras did not come to court with\r\na reply to the message offering to withdraw the Englishmen who were\r\nhelping the rebels.” They were only sent there, said Burghley, to prevent\r\nFrenchmen from gaining a footing. He was overjoyed to receive Alba’s\r\nkind letter, and took it to the Queen at once, though she had already\r\nsickened with the smallpox, which a day or two afterwards declared\r\nitself. He hoped, he said, that God would pardon those who had caused the\r\ndissension between the two countries; and the Queen was most willing to\r\ncome to terms. He expressed delight at the reported successes of Alba.\r\nHe compared Spaniards with Frenchmen, greatly to the disadvantage of the\r\nlatter, and “he said more against the French than I did, speaking with\r\ngreat reverence of our King, and of so courageous a Prince, which were\r\nthe words he applied to your Excellency” (Alba).\r\n\r\nThe delighted merchant was pressed to stay to supper to meet such great\r\npersonages as the Earl of Sussex, the Lord Chamberlain, and others; and\r\nthe next day he was in conference with Burghley for hours, with the\r\nresult that the latter consented to draw up a new draft treaty for the\r\nreopening of trade, one of the clauses of which was to touch upon the\r\ntender subject of the treatment extended by the Inquisition to English\r\nmerchants and mariners in Spain. Burghley hinted to De Guaras that some\r\nof the Council were against an accord, but he persuaded him that his own\r\nfeelings were all in favour of a renewal of the close understanding with\r\nthe House of Burgundy. De Guaras was backwards and forwards to court for\r\nweeks, more charmed than ever with the Lord Treasurer’s amiability. “It\r\nis,” he says, “undoubted that a great amount of dissension exists in\r\nthe Council, some being friendly to our side, and others to the French;\r\nbut the best Councillor of all of them is Lord Burghley, as he follows\r\nthe tendency of the Queen, which is towards concord. As he is supreme in\r\nthe country and in the Queen’s estimation, in all the important Councils\r\nwhich were held during the days that I was at court, he, with his great\r\neloquence, having right on his side, was able to persuade those who were\r\nopposed to him. He assured me privately that he had gained over the great\r\nmajority of his opponents, and especially the Earl of Leicester, who\r\nhas always been on the side of the French.”[362] Burghley could be very\r\npersuasive and talkative when it suited him, as it very rarely did. The\r\nFrench, he said, were most anxious for a close alliance, but the Queen\r\nand himself set but small store on “these noisy French and Italians.”\r\n\r\nA Spanish spy in London, unknown to De Guaras, scornfully wrote to Alba\r\nthat Lord Burghley was playing with De Guaras; and before many weeks had\r\npassed, the latter himself had begun to doubt. Burghley passed him in\r\nhis ante-room three times without so much as noticing him. “Some great\r\nplot against the Spaniards in Flanders” was hatching, he was sure; “and\r\nin one moment they decided that their false news was of more importance\r\nthan our friendship.” “Whilst this Government exists, no good arrangement\r\nwill be made, as the Queen only desires it from fear, and the rest will\r\noppose it on religious grounds.” When De Guaras saw the Lord Treasurer\r\nlater in November (1572), grave doubts were expressed about the _bona\r\nfides_ of Philip, much to the Spaniard’s indignation. Burghley said he\r\nwas still strongly in favour of an arrangement, because the French, who\r\nwished the English wool trade to go to France instead of Flanders, were\r\nso shifty, and could not be trusted. The Queen would be glad, too, to\r\nmediate between Spain and the Prince of Orange. Thus Burghley played on\r\nthe hopes and fears of Spain; but through the whole negotiation it was\r\nclear that the objects were—first, if possible, to reopen the ports for\r\nEnglish trade on profitable terms;[363] and, secondly, to keep Spain in\r\nhand, pending the development of events in France, and the strengthening\r\nof Orange for his forthcoming campaign.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Sir Humphrey Gilbert and his 800 Englishmen were\r\nrecalled from Flanders, and the elaborate pretence made that he was in\r\ndisgrace for having gone thither at all against the Queen’s wish; and\r\nother demonstrations were made, especially by Burghley, of a desire to\r\nagree on friendly conditions with Spain. As weeks passed without any\r\nreply coming from Alba to the draft treaty, Burghley grew distrustful,\r\nand, as De Guaras complains, coldly passed him without recognising him.\r\nAt last, late in December, he sent for the Spaniard and made a speech,\r\nwhich, De Guaras says, sounded as if it had been studied. “He hoped,” he\r\nsaid, “that the good-will of himself and his friends would be recognised.\r\nSome of the Councillors thought that De Guaras had been playing them\r\nfalse,[364] and his (Burghley’s) party was much annoyed that no answer\r\nhad come, especially about the simultaneous opening of the ports.” All\r\nthe while the vigorous support of Orange’s preparations went on; money,\r\nmen, and arms flowed over in abundance (early in 1573); and the Dutch\r\nagents were in England urging Elizabeth openly to take Holland and\r\nZeeland under her protection, and to lend national countenance to the\r\nstruggle against Spain. She was not prepared for this yet, for France\r\nwas under the influence of the Guises, and their intrigues in Scotland\r\nleft her no rest. But Alba was afraid of the bare possibility of a\r\ngreat Protestant league of English, Germans, and Huguenots, in favour\r\nof Orange; and his pride was humbled more by this than by professions\r\nof friendship. The result of Burghley’s negotiations through De Guaras,\r\nand the aiding of Orange, was that in the summer of 1573 the Flemish\r\nand Spanish ports were once more opened to English trade, on terms\r\nimmensely favourable to England,[365] since she obtained a free market\r\nfor her cloth, whilst she kept the great bulk of the enormous amount\r\nof Spanish property which Elizabeth had seized five years previously.\r\nThis was a greater exemplification of the impotence of Philip, even\r\nthan the expulsion of De Spes. All the world could see now that, much\r\nas his Inquisition might harry individual Englishmen, the King could\r\nneither defend nor avenge the injuries done to himself; and was obliged\r\nto overlook the presence of armed English regiments on the side of his\r\nrebellious subjects, for the sake of retaining the profit brought to his\r\ndominions by English commerce. Burghley had at all events established one\r\nfact, namely, that, for the present, Philip alone could do no harm.\r\n\r\nThe struggles between the Protestants and Catholics in Scotland had\r\ncontinued almost without interruption since the death of Murray. Mary’s\r\nfriends were still numerous and strong amongst the aristocratic and\r\nlanded classes, and were supported, as we have seen, by Spanish and papal\r\nmoney, as well as by Guisan intrigue. The Regent Lennox had been murdered\r\nby the Hamiltons (September 1571), and his successor (Mar) had died of\r\npoison or a broken heart (November 1572); but with the advent of Morton,\r\na man of stronger fibre, the Protestant cause became more aggressive, and\r\nthe English influence over Scotland more decided. Shortly before this\r\nhappened, when the effects of St. Bartholomew were still weighing on the\r\nEnglish court, and it was known that Catharine de Medici and her son were\r\nas busy with the Archbishop of Glasgow in supporting the Hamiltons and\r\nGordons as was Cardinal Lorraine himself, secret instructions were given\r\nto Killigrew, the English Ambassador in Scotland, to take a step which\r\nunder any other circumstances would have been inexcusable. The secret\r\ninstructions are drafted in Burghley’s hand, and more obloquy has been\r\npiled upon his memory in consequence of them than for any other action\r\nin his career; even his thick-and-thin apologist, Dr. Nares, confessing\r\nthat he could only look upon Killigrew’s orders “with feelings of disgust\r\nand horror.” Killigrew’s open mission was to reconcile the King’s party\r\nwith those who championed the cause of his mother, and especially with\r\nKirkaldy of Grange and Lethington, who still held Edinburgh Castle; but\r\nhis secret instructions were to a different effect. He was to warn\r\nthe Protestants that a second St. Bartholomew might be intended in\r\nScotland—not by any means an improbable suggestion, considering who were\r\nthe promoters of the original massacre. “But you are also chosen to deal\r\nin a third matter of far greater moment.” The continuance of the Queen of\r\nScots in England, he is told, is considered dangerous, and it is deemed\r\ndesirable that she should be sent to Scotland and delivered to the Regent\r\n(Mar), “if it might be wrought that they themselves should secretly\r\nrequire it, with good assurance to deal with her by way of justice, that\r\nshe should receive that which she hath deserved, whereby no further peril\r\nshould ensue from her escaping, or by setting her up again. Otherwise the\r\nCouncil of England will never assent to deliver her out of the realm; and\r\nfor assurance, none can suffice but hostages of good value—that is, some\r\nchildren of the Regent and the Earl of Morton.”[366] The suggestion was\r\nnot a chivalrous or a generous one. It meant nothing less than handing\r\nover the unfortunate Mary to her enemies to be executed, and so to rid\r\nElizabeth of her troublesome guest without responsibility. Killigrew was\r\nBurghley’s brother-in-law, and the two, with Leicester and the Queen,\r\nwere the only persons acquainted with the intention.\r\n\r\nOn his arrival in Edinburgh the new envoy found the Protestants\r\nprofoundly moved by the news of the massacre in Paris; Knox, paralysed\r\nand on the brink of the grave, used his last remaining spark of life\r\nto denounce the Guises and the Papists who had forged the murder plot\r\nagainst the people of God. Killigrew found Morton ready and eager to\r\nhelp in the sacrifice of Mary, but Mar held back; and Burghley and\r\nLeicester wrote, urging speed in the matter.[367] When the terms of\r\nthe Scots at last were sent to Burghley, it was seen that, though they\r\nwere willing to have Mary killed, they would not relieve Elizabeth of\r\nthe responsibility.[368] The death of Mar put an end for a time to the\r\nnegotiation, which was never seriously undertaken again, as it was clear\r\nthat the Scots would drive too hard a bargain to suit Elizabeth.\r\n\r\nIt is my province to explain facts rather than to apologise for them, and\r\nthe explanation of the plan to cause Mary to be judicially murdered in\r\nScotland must be sought in the panic which seized upon the Protestants\r\nafter St. Bartholomew. The massacre was generally believed to be only a\r\npart of a plan for the universal extirpation of the reformers, in which\r\nit was known that Mary Stuart’s friends and relatives were the prime\r\nmovers, and one of the main objects was represented to be the raising of\r\nMary to the throne of a Catholic Great Britain. So long as this belief\r\nexisted, no step was inexcusable that aimed at frustrating so diabolical\r\nand widespread a conspiracy. That Burghley himself was not sensible of\r\nany turpitude in the matter may be seen from a letter written by him\r\nto Walsingham on the 14th January 1573, begging him to discover the\r\nauthor of a book printed in Paris, in which he and Bacon are scurrilously\r\naccused of plans against Norfolk and Mary. “God amend his spirit,” he\r\nsays, referring to the author, “and confound his malice. As for my part,\r\nif I have any such malicious or malignant spirit, God presently so\r\nconfound my body to ashes and my soul to perpetual torment in hell.”[369]\r\n\r\nHow soon Catharine de Medici and her son regretted the false step of\r\nSt. Bartholomew is seen by their attitude towards England early in the\r\nfollowing year (1573). The Archbishop of Glasgow was plainly told that\r\nno more help could be given to his mistress, Cardinal Lorraine failed\r\nignominiously to draw France into renewed activity on behalf of the\r\nLeague, and Charles IX. considered it necessary to apologise to Elizabeth\r\nfor the presence in his court of the special papal envoy already referred\r\nto. It was seen also that the blood and iron policy of Alba had ended in\r\nfailure: the revolt in the Netherlands was stronger than ever, Holland\r\nwas entirely in the hands of Orange, and most of the Catholic provinces\r\nof Flanders even had broken from their Spanish allegiance. Under these\r\ncircumstances it seemed possible that the secular dream of Frenchmen\r\nmight eventually come to pass, and the fine harbours and busy towns of\r\nBelgium might fall to the share of France. But this could only be if\r\nshe had a close understanding and made common cause with England. So\r\nonce more the Alençon marriage was vigorously pushed to the front by\r\nCatharine. In February the French Ambassador saw Elizabeth, and formally\r\nprayed her to give an answer whether she would marry the Prince or\r\nnot. If she would only let them know her pleasure now, the King and\r\nQueen-mother would trouble her no more. It was a good opportunity, and\r\nElizabeth made the most of it. Fair terms must be given to the Huguenots\r\nin Rochelle, she said, and on condition that this was done, she would\r\ngive an answer about Alençon through Lord Burghley. On the 18th February\r\nthe Lord Treasurer made his formal speech. The Queen would never marry a\r\nman she had never seen. If the Prince liked to come over, even secretly,\r\nhe would be welcome; but in any case an interview had better precede\r\nthe discussion of religion, because if the lovers did not fancy each\r\nother, the question of conscience would be a convenient pretext for\r\nbreaking off the negotiation; but still no public exercise of Catholic\r\nworship must be expected. When Burghley sent to Walsingham a copy of his\r\nspeech, he added for his private information: “I see the imminent perils\r\nto this State, and … the success (_i.e._ the succession) of the crown\r\nmanifestly uncertain, or rather so manifestly prejudicial to the state\r\nof religion, that I cannot but still persist in seeking marriage for\r\nher Majesty, and finding no way that is liking to her but this of the\r\nDuke, I do force myself to pursue it with desire, and do fancy myself\r\nwith imaginations that if he do come hither her Majesty would not refuse\r\nhim.… If I am deceived, yet for the time it easeth me to imagine that\r\nsuch a sequel may follow.”[370] This was uncertain enough; but Walsingham\r\nwas even less encouraging. He was sick of the whole hollow business;\r\nprofoundly distrustful of the French; and, moreover, was a friend of\r\nLeicester, who constantly plied him with letters deprecating the match.\r\nThis, then, is how he managed cleverly to stand in with Burghley whilst\r\nserving Leicester. “Touching my private opinion of the marriage, the\r\ngreat impediment that I find in the same is the contentment of the eye.\r\nThe gentleman, sure, is void of any good favour, besides the blemish\r\nof the small pocks. Now, when I weigh the same with the delicateness of\r\nher Majesty’s eye, and considering also that there are some about her\r\nin credit, who in respect of their particular interests, have neither\r\nregard for her Majesty, nor to the preservation of our country from\r\nruine, and will rather increase the misliking by defacing him than by\r\ndutifully laying before her the necessity of marriage … I hardly think\r\nthere will ever grow any liking.… Whether this marriage be sincerely\r\nmeant here or not is a hard point to judge … in my opinion I think rather\r\nno than yea.”[371] This was almost the last letter written by Walsingham\r\nas Ambassador. He was recalled, to be shortly afterwards appointed\r\njoint-Secretary of State with Sir Thomas Smith, with the intention of\r\nstill further relieving Burghley from routine labour; and Dr. Dale, as\r\nAmbassador in Paris, kept alive the ridiculous, and frequently insincere,\r\ndiscussion of the marriage of Elizabeth and Alençon.[372]\r\n\r\nBurghley’s labours and anxieties were not confined to foreign affairs.\r\nHis interest in the uniformity and discipline of the Anglican Church\r\nwas unceasing, and especially in connection with his Chancellorship of\r\nCambridge University, gave him endless anxiety. The vestments controversy\r\nhad now widened and deepened. The famous tract called “An Admonition to\r\nParliament” had been presented to the Parliament of 1572 by Cartwright;\r\nand its violence in a Puritan direction had provoked a controversy,\r\nwhich, at the period now under consideration (1573), had developed on\r\none side into a bitter antagonism to prelacy, and even sacerdotalism in\r\nall its forms. Both parties appealed to Burghley. He made a speech in\r\nthe Star Chamber which left no doubt as to his attitude, if any such\r\never existed, on the point. The Queen, he said, was determined to have\r\nthe laws obeyed. No innovation of ritual or practice would be permitted.\r\nIf any of the “novelists” were under the impression that departures from\r\nthe rules laid down would remain unpunished, he disabused their minds.\r\nA Fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge, named Chark, violently attacked the\r\nhierarchy from the University pulpits, and was admonished. He persisted,\r\nand was ejected from his Fellowship. Another Cambridge man, Edward\r\nDering, Lecturer at St. Paul’s Cathedral, acted similarly, and was\r\nsummoned before the Privy Council, and was suspended from his preferment.\r\nAt the instance of Bishop Sandys[373] he was restored, but again brought\r\nbefore the Star Chamber when he addressed a long letter to Burghley\r\nadvocating his views. Whilst Leicester always favoured the Puritans,\r\nthe Lord Treasurer was thus on the side of the law and the prelates;\r\nand though he was constantly chosen as arbiter, even by those with whom\r\nhe disagreed, he never wavered in his insistence on the maintenance of\r\nuniformity, and obedience to the prescriptions laid down by Parliament\r\nand the rulers of the Church.[374]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the appointment of two Secretaries of State, which\r\nsomewhat relieved him from writing despatches, almost every matter, great\r\nand small, was still referred to Burghley. We have given instances of his\r\nactivity in foreign and ecclesiastical affairs; but, as Ellis[375] truly\r\nsays, “from a question of peace or war, down to a regulation for the\r\nlining of slop hose; from quarrels at court to the bickering between a\r\nschoolmaster and his scholar; from the arrest of a peer to the punishment\r\nof a cutpurse—all was reported to him, and by all parties in turn his\r\nfavour was craved.”\r\n\r\nIt must have been difficult for him to keep clear of court factions\r\nand scandal; but though it was notorious that Leicester always opposed\r\nhim, they still remained outwardly friendly, and their letters to each\r\nother are full of civil expressions. Sussex and Hatton were for ever at\r\nfeud with Leicester. Alençon’s amorous agents scandalised all beholders\r\nby their open flirting with the Queen, to which Leicester retorted by\r\nmaking violent love to two sisters, Lady Sheffield and Frances Howard;\r\nand the light-hearted and light-heeled young Earl of Oxford, Burghley’s\r\nson-in-law at this time (1573), had danced himself into the good graces\r\nof the erotic Queen, which he soon lost by his folly. Stern Lady Burghley\r\nopenly and imprudently condemned this philandering, and the Queen\r\nfell into a rage with her; yet “my Lord Treasurer, even after his old\r\nmanner, dealeth with matters of the State only, and beareth himself very\r\nuprightly.… At all these love matters my Lord Treasurer winketh, and will\r\nnot meddle any way.”[376]\r\n\r\nBurghley’s private correspondence with his steward, Kemp, at Burghley, at\r\nthis period, shows that his care for detail in his household management\r\nwas as unwearied as ever. One letter written in June 1573 by Kemp is very\r\ncurious. Burghley’s mother was still alive, but, of course, very aged.\r\nShe appears to have become unduly penurious as to her garb, and her son\r\nhad ordered a dress for the old lady. The steward writes: “Mr. Thomas\r\nCecil came home well, and my mistress, your mother, came to Burghley two\r\nhours before him. The gown that you would make, it must be for every\r\nday, and yet because it comes from you (except you write to her to the\r\ncontrary) she will make it her holiday gown; whereof she hath great store\r\nalready, both of silk and cloth. But I think, sir, if you make her one\r\nof cloth, with some velvet on it, with your letter to desire her for\r\nyour sake to wear it daily, she would accustom herself to it; so as she\r\nwould forget to go any longer in such base apparel as she hath used to\r\nhave a delight in, which is too mean for one of a lower estate than she\r\nis.” The old lady also desired a chaplain for service twice a day; and by\r\nBurghley’s endorsement on the letter, it is evident that the gown and the\r\nchaplain were sent to her.\r\n\r\nDuring the Queen’s great progress through Kent and Sussex in the autumn,\r\nBurghley attended her; and whilst the court was at Eridge, the Treasurer,\r\nnot without difficulty, persuaded the Queen to accede to Mary Stuart’s\r\nrequest, through the Earl of Shrewsbury, that she should be allowed to\r\nvisit the baths of Buxton, whither shortly afterwards Burghley himself\r\nwent for his own malady,[377] and saw the unhappy Queen, whom on this\r\noccasion, at all events, he impressed not unfavourably.[378] During the\r\nQueen’s progress, which was on a more lavish scale even than usual,[379]\r\na determined attempt was made—and, according to one of Mary Stuart’s\r\nletters from Buxton, not quite unsuccessfully—to arouse Elizabeth’s\r\ndistrust of Burghley. Simultaneously there were sent to the Queen, to\r\nBurghley, to Bacon, and the principal courtiers and ecclesiastics,\r\nanother violent book printed in France against Burghley and the Lord\r\nKeeper. A copy was sent to the Queen by Lord Windsor, a refugee on the\r\nContinent, with great professions of attachment, and hints evidently\r\ndirected against Burghley, “although for my part, in mine opinion, I\r\nsuppose he is too wise to be overtaken in many of those things which he\r\nis touched withal.”[380] Burghley received his copy from an unknown hand\r\nin Canterbury Cathedral precincts, where he was lodged, and it appears\r\nquite to have upset his equanimity. He wrote (11th September 1573) to\r\nthe Archbishop (Parker) bitterly resenting the attack at such a time “by\r\nsome domestic hidden scorpion.” “If God and our consciences were not our\r\ndefence and consolation against these pestilential darts, we might well\r\nbe weary of our lives.” Parker returned “the mad book, so outrageously\r\npenned that malice hath made him blind. I judge it not worth an answer.”\r\nBacon was less disturbed with the matter than his brother-in-law, and\r\nsummarises the contents of the book as follows: “It consisteth of three\r\npoints. Chiefly it is to change the religion that now is; 2nd, to\r\nestablish the Scottish Queen’s party; and, 3rd, is an invective against\r\nus two. I like the conjunction of the matter, though I mislike the\r\nimpudent lies of the author to maintain it.”\r\n\r\nThe accession of Morton to the Regency of Scotland had been followed by\r\nthe complete collapse of Mary’s cause there. Killigrew was ready with\r\nEnglish bribes, and the Hamiltons and the Gordons were induced to abandon\r\na hopeless struggle and lay down their arms. Only Kirkaldy of Grange\r\nheld out, hoping against hope that the promised Guisan help would reach\r\nhim in Edinburgh Castle. Once a large sum of French money for him was\r\nwithheld by the treachery of Sir James Balfour, corrupt almost to the\r\npoint of grotesqueness; and thenceforward Kirkaldy, Lord Hume, and the\r\nrest of the party simply held out in the castle to save their lives.\r\nBut when Drury with English troops crossed the Border and reinforced\r\nMorton, Kirkaldy surrendered to the English general, on promise of fair\r\ntreatment. Morton insisted upon the prisoners being delivered to him,\r\nfor whilst they lived, he said, there would be no safety for him or the\r\nState; and though Drury held out, Elizabeth at last gave way to Morton’s\r\nimportunity, and brave Kirkaldy and the rest of Mary’s staunch friends\r\nlost their heads. Thenceforward Mary Stuart’s cause was dead, so far as\r\nthe Scottish people themselves were concerned. Morton nearly obtained the\r\nBishop of Ross, too, from Elizabeth, but he was after all a sovereign’s\r\nAmbassador, and her Council dissuaded her from surrendering him. On his\r\nabject submission and solemn promise never again to take part in public\r\naffairs,[381] he was allowed to go to France, to break his pledge at\r\nonce, and become thenceforward an untiring agent for the furtherance\r\nof Spanish aims in England. Thus Scotland for a time, under so firm an\r\nEnglish ally as Morton, ceased to cause active anxiety to Elizabeth and\r\nher minister.\r\n\r\nAlba, sick of his sanguinary failure, was replaced in Flanders by a\r\nmore diplomatic Governor (Requesens) late in 1573. Though De Guaras in\r\nLondon continued humbly to imitate De Spes, and immersed himself in\r\nintrigues, such as that of the English captains who proposed to betray\r\nFlushing, the plans of those who offered to kill the Prince of Orange,\r\nto kidnap the young King of Scotland, and the like, many of these plans\r\nwere merely traps set by Burghley to learn how far the Spaniards were\r\nwilling to go; and they came to nothing, for of all things Philip needed\r\npeace the most. Alba and the war party in Spain were in disgrace, the\r\ncommerce of the country was almost destroyed by the privateers, and\r\nfriendly relations with England were once more the great object of\r\nPhilip’s policy. Burghley also renewed his efforts to draw the countries\r\ncloser together, for reasons which will presently be stated. A great\r\ndelivery of Catholics from prison was made mainly at his instance, and\r\ndrew upon him remonstrances and attacks, both on the part of some of the\r\nBishops themselves, in a guarded fashion, and more violently from the\r\nPuritans, now openly patronised by Leicester. Arising out of this, a\r\ngreat conspiracy was said to have been discovered against the lives of\r\nArchbishop Parker and Lord Burghley, on the part of one Undertree. The\r\ndepositions of the accused, which are in the Hatfield Papers, are, as\r\nusual in such cases, full to the extent of diffuseness; but though Parker\r\nwas much alarmed, and the affair gave Burghley an infinity of trouble,\r\nthere does not appear to have been much importance really attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe key to Burghley’s milder attitude towards the Catholics—apart from\r\nthe disappearance of Mary Stuart’s party in Scotland—was the position\r\nof affairs in France. The talk of Elizabeth’s marriage with Alençon had\r\ncontinued uninterruptedly, drawn out with a thousand banalities as to\r\nthe possibility of secret meetings between the lovers, the depth and\r\nnumber of pock holes on the suitor’s face, his personal qualities, his\r\nreligious elasticity, and the like. His brother, Charles IX., was only\r\ntwenty-four, but it was known that he could not live long; the heir,\r\nAnjou, now King of Poland, was a furious and fanatical Catholic. With\r\nthe knowledge of Elizabeth and her minister, all France was enveloped\r\nin a vast conspiracy, in which the Montmorencis and the “politicians”\r\nwere making common cause with the Huguenots, of which combination\r\nAlençon was the figurehead. But Catharine de Medici was fully aware of\r\nthe fact, and was determined to frustrate it. With Anjou for King she\r\nmight still be supreme in France; whereas the rise of Alençon, under\r\nthe tutelage of the Huguenots and the Queen of England, would have\r\nmeant extinction for her. Several times before Charles died, Alençon\r\nand the Princes of Navarre and Condé had tried to escape to England,\r\nbut Catharine held them tight, and never left them. Montgomerie was\r\nwaiting for the signal, with a strong fleet in the Channel, to swoop\r\ndown upon Normandy, and all the Protestants and anti-Guisans in France\r\nwere under arms. The mine was to burst in April, the Princes were to be\r\nrescued forcibly from Catharine, and St. Bartholomew was to be avenged.\r\nBut the Queen-mother was on the alert. Just before the day fixed she\r\nhurried away from St. Germains to Catholic Paris, clapped Alençon and\r\nNavarre, Montmorenci, De Cossé, and all the chiefs into prison, and then\r\ncrushed the Protestant armies piecemeal, for they were leaderless and\r\nfar apart. When, therefore, Charles IX. died (30th May 1574), Catharine\r\nwas mistress of the situation, and held France in her hand until the new\r\nKing, Henry III., arrived, to take possession of the throne. With such\r\na sovereign as this in France, led by Catharine, who had her grudge to\r\nsatisfy against Elizabeth for the encouragement she had given to the\r\nPrinces, it was natural that Burghley should again smile somewhat upon\r\nthe Catholics, and say civil words to Spain; especially as panic-stricken\r\nrumours came—though they were untrue—that Philip was fitting out a\r\ngreat navy to send with a powerful force to Flanders.[382] Catholic\r\nFlanders, moreover, had mostly been brought back to Spanish allegiance\r\nby the mildness of Requesens; and Elizabeth was growing less willing to\r\ncontinue to provide large sums of money to uphold Orange in what now\r\nappeared to be a well-nigh desperate cause, if it had to be supported\r\nentirely from England. So when Requesens’ envoys came to see her about\r\nthe regulation of trade, and the exclusion of the privateers from her\r\nports, she was all smiles; and although upon being appealed to, to allow\r\nEnglish mercenaries to serve the Spaniards in Flanders as they served\r\nOrange, she refused, though not very firmly, she expressed her desire\r\nto bring Orange to submit to the King of Spain. Once more, therefore, an\r\nunrestrained Catholic regime in France inevitably drew England and Spain\r\ncloser together. It was only when the Huguenots were paramount, who would\r\nnot join Philip against England, or help the Catholics of Scotland, that\r\nElizabeth and Burghley could afford to disregard the friendship of the\r\nKing of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the young sovereign of France—no longer a king,\r\nbut a besotted monk, sunk into the deepest abyss of debauchery\r\nand superstition—kept alive the discontent of the Huguenots and\r\n“politicians,” who had regarded his accession with horror. Alençon and\r\nthe King held rival courts in Paris, the one surrounded by reformers, the\r\nother by all that was retrograde and vicious. Cardinal Lorraine was dead,\r\nand the King’s advisers were no longer statesmen, but mendicant friars\r\nand the Italian time-servers of the Queen-mother: Henry of Guise was just\r\nentering into the arena, and was already a popular idol; and all seemed\r\nto portend a renewal of French activity in favour of Mary Stuart.[383]\r\nElizabeth therefore went out of her way to dazzle poor foolish De Guaras\r\nagain. Seeing him walking in Richmond Park, she called him to her, and\r\nexerted all her witchery upon him (March 1575). “You understand,” she\r\nsaid, “full well, old wine, old bread, and old friends should be prized\r\nthe most, and if only for the sake of showing these Frenchmen who are\r\nwrangling as to whether our friendship is firm or not, there is good\r\nreason to prove outwardly the kind feeling which inwardly exists.”[384]\r\nShe accused the poor man, quite coquettishly, of having received a token\r\nfrom the Queen of Scots—which he had not—but ended by quite winning him\r\nover by her prattle. Almost simultaneously with this, strict orders were\r\ngiven to the Warden of the Cinque Ports “to prevent the landing of the\r\nPrince of Orange, or any of his aiders or abettors in the conspiracy\r\nagainst the King of Spain, and also to prevent their receiving any aid,\r\nsuccour, or relief, in men, armour, or victuals.”[385]\r\n\r\nConsidering that the revolt in Holland had been mainly kept up from\r\nEngland, this was indeed a complete change of policy; but more was behind\r\nit even than appeared. Many of the Catholic refugees on the Continent\r\nwere spies in the service of Lord Burghley, to whom nearly all of them\r\nappealed as their only hope and protector, and one of them particularly,\r\nnamed Woodshaw,[386] who was deep in the confidence of La Motte, the\r\nSpanish Governor of Gravelines. The latter suggested that, as war\r\nbetween France and England was in the air, it would be a good plan for\r\nthe English to seize Calais or Boulogne, with the aid of the Spaniards,\r\nand come to terms with Philip to prevent any aid or food reaching the\r\nFrench from Flanders or Artois. This was conveyed to Burghley, and soon\r\nSir William Drury, Colonel Chester, and several of the officers who\r\nhad come from Holland, were in close conference daily with him and the\r\nother Councillors remaining in London when the Queen went upon her summer\r\nprogress. De Guaras, whilst reporting their movements, was in the dark\r\nas to their object. “During the last three days,” he says, “at night or\r\nat unsuspected hours, they have taken from the Tower sixty waggons and\r\ngun carriages, which have been shipped to Dover.” Guns, battery-trains,\r\nculverins, fieldpieces, and ammunition were being shipped on four of\r\nthe Queen’s ships at Rochester. Mariners were being pressed, commanders\r\nwere leaving secretly for the coast, Burghley’s son-in-law the Earl of\r\nOxford, with Ralph Hopton and young Montmorenci, hurried off to Germany,\r\nand the Huguenot agents were closeted with Burghley almost day and night.\r\nWe know now what it all meant, by a letter from the Earl of Sussex to\r\nLord Burghley,[387] in which he deplores the projected war with Catholic\r\nFrance, which, he says, is only brought about by those who wish to\r\nprevent the Queen’s marriage with Alençon. “It will bring her into war\r\nwith all Europe, and she and the realm will smart for the pleasing of\r\nthese men’s humours.” The cost of the war, he says, was to be defrayed\r\nequally by the King of Navarre (Henry), the German princes, and the\r\nQueen; “but he fears her Majesty in the end must pay for all, or let all\r\nfall when she hath put her foot in.”\r\n\r\nWilkes, the Clerk of the Council, was sent with a large sum of money to\r\nyoung Montmorenci (Meru) in Strasbourg, and then over the Rhine to the\r\nDuke Hans Casimir, the great mercenary; and Meru was able to write to\r\nBurghley in October, “Thanks to the Queen’s favour by your means, we are\r\nnow on the point of succeeding. One of the finest armies that for twenty\r\nyears hath issued from Germany, ready to march, is coming just in time\r\nto succour the King’s brother.”[388] All through the summer De Guaras was\r\nat fault as to the meaning of the preparations, which he thought might be\r\na joint expedition against the Spaniards in Flanders. As we have seen,\r\nthe very opposite really was the case. Some of the principal English\r\nofficers, indeed, who had been with Orange were full of plots with De\r\nGuaras for poisoning the Prince, for betraying Flushing into Spanish\r\nhands, and so forth. For the moment there were certainly no smiles from\r\nElizabeth for the Netherlanders; for Orange had taken a masterly step,\r\nsuch as she herself might have conceived. When he saw that English help\r\nwas slackening, he boldly made approaches to France for help. So long as\r\nit was Huguenot help under her control, Elizabeth did not mind; but when\r\nit was a question of marrying Orange’s daughter to Alençon or some other\r\nFrench prince, and obtaining French national patronage, it was quite\r\nanother matter—that Elizabeth would never allow. So England and Spain\r\ngrew closer and closer. Sir Henry Cobham was sent as an envoy to Philip,\r\nostensibly on the question of the English prisoners of the Inquisition,\r\nbut really to propose a friendship between the two countries, and inform\r\nthe King of the Prince of Orange’s intrigues with the French.[389] A\r\nSpanish flotilla on its way to the Netherlands, under Don Pedro de\r\nValdés, was, moreover, welcomed in the English ports, and an envoy from\r\nRequesens took part, as the Queen’s guest, in the memorable festivities\r\nat Kenilworth.\r\n\r\nA renewed appeal was made to the Council by Orange in August, through\r\nColonel Chester. He offered the island of Zeeland to Elizabeth, if she\r\nwould hold it, and begged permission to raise two thousand fresh men\r\nin England. The reply given by Burghley was to the effect that “if the\r\nQueen allowed such a thing, the King of Spain would have a good cause for\r\nintroducing schism and fire into her country through Ireland. If Orange\r\ncarried out his threat to hand over the territory to the French, the\r\nQueen would oppose it.” Every day some fresh proof of friendship with\r\nSpain was given. Frobisher proposed to place his fleet at the disposal\r\nof the King of Spain, proclamations were issued forbidding all British\r\nsubjects from taking service with Orange, and offers of mediation were\r\nfrequent. In September 1575, Alençon managed to escape the vigilance of\r\nhis brother and his mother, fled to Dreux, adopted the Huguenot cause,\r\nand headed the revolt with Henry of Navarre. This was the eventuality\r\nin which the English preparations were to have been employed. But,\r\nagain, Catharine de Medici was too clever to be caught. She suddenly\r\nreleased Montmorenci and the rest of the “politicians” from the Bastile,\r\nattached them to the King’s cause, and through them patched up a six\r\nmonths’ truce between the two brothers (November). The terms were hard\r\nfor Henry. Alençon was bribed with 100,000 livres, and the three rich\r\nduchies of Anjou, Berri, and Touraine; Hans Casimir got 300,000 crowns,\r\nand a pension of 40,000 livres; the German mercenaries were handsomely\r\npaid to go home; Condé was promised the governorship of Picardy; the\r\nMontmorencis, De Cossé, the Chatillons, and the rest of the malcontents\r\nwere bought; the crown jewels of France were pawned, and the country\r\nplunged deeply in debt to pay for the famous truce.\r\n\r\nThen Elizabeth and her advisers found themselves confronted with\r\nincreased difficulties, as they usually did when the Catholics in\r\nFrance had a free hand. Catharine and the King saw that France was\r\nnot big enough to hold at the same time the sovereign and the heir\r\npresumptive, and cast about for means to get rid of him profitably. The\r\nbest suggestion for them came from the Walloon nobles in favour of Spain.\r\nWhy should not Alençon marry a daughter of the Spanish King and be made\r\nViceroy of Spanish Flanders? The mere whisper of such an arrangement\r\ndrove Elizabeth into a new course. She might hint, as she did pretty\r\nbroadly many times, at the marriage of the young Prince with herself, but\r\nAlençon thought he saw more advantage elsewhere. For the next three years\r\nhe was held tightly in the leading-strings of his mother and brother—no\r\nlonger a Huguenot, but an ostentatiously devout Catholic, hating the King\r\nand his surroundings bitterly; jealous, vengeful, and turbulent, but\r\nlooking for his future to the Catholics and the League rather than to\r\nthe Queen of England, with whom he kept up just a sufficient pretence of\r\nlove-making to prevent her from opposing him in Flanders. It was doubly\r\nnecessary now for Elizabeth to be friendly with Spain; but she could\r\nnot afford to see Orange utterly crushed, for with the Huguenots and\r\nProtestant Holland both subdued, there was no barrier between her and\r\nCatholic vengeance. The position was a perplexing one for her. Orange\r\nsent over prayers almost daily for help, or he must abandon the struggle.\r\nAt one time, in December, when the Queen learned that a great deputation\r\nof Dutch Protestant nobles were on the way to offer her Holland and\r\nZeeland in exchange for English support,[390] “she entered her chamber\r\nalone, slamming the door after her, and crying out that they were ruining\r\nher over this business. She declared loudly that she would have no\r\nforces sent openly to Holland. She was in such grief that her ladies\r\nthreatened to burst her door open if she would not admit them, as they\r\ncould not bear her to be alone in such trouble.”[391] But loudly as she\r\nmight protest, especially in the hearing of the friends of Spain, and\r\nroughly as she might use St. Aldegonde, Paul Buiz, and the rest of the\r\nNetherlanders who prayed for aid, she took care, with Burghley’s help, to\r\nlook fixedly in another direction when men and arms, munitions and money,\r\nwere sent over to Orange in violation of her own orders.\r\n\r\nWhat Lord Burghley’s action in the matter was is seen by his letters.\r\nBeale, one of the clerks of the Council, was sent over to Zeeland to\r\nreport on Orange’s position, and to insist upon the suppression of\r\npiracy. Burghley thus writes to Walsingham (16th April 1576): “I have\r\nperused all the letters and memorandum of Mr. Beale’s concerning his\r\nvoyage into Zeeland, and so well allow of the whole course therein\r\ntaken by the Lords, that both with heart and hand I sign them.”[392]\r\nThe Flushing pirates appear to have offered some insult to the Earl\r\nof Oxford, Burghley’s son-in-law, on his way to England, at which the\r\nTreasurer was extremely angry,[393] an unusual thing with him. In\r\nthe same letter he writes: “I find it hard to make a good distinction\r\nbetween anger and judgment for Lord Oxford’s misusage, and especially\r\nwhen I look into the universal barbarism of the Prince’s (Orange) force\r\nof Flushingers, who are only a rabble of common pirates, or worse, who\r\nmake no difference whom they outrage, I mistrust any good issue of the\r\ncause, though of itself it should be favoured.” He almost violently urges\r\nthat Beale should ask the Prince of Orange to avenge such an insult “by\r\nhanging some of the principals.” “Such an outrage cannot be condoned\r\nwithout five or six of such thieves being hanged. If the Prince were rid\r\nof a hundred of them it would be better for the cause. You see my anger\r\nleadeth my judgment. But I am not truly more moved hereto for particular\r\ncauses than for the public.”[394] The same day a very strong remonstrance\r\nfrom the English Council was written to Orange, saying that the piracy of\r\nthe Flushing men was rendering his cause odious to all Christendom, and\r\nwould ruin his enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe Netherlanders, especially Paul Buiz, who lodged with Burghley’s\r\nservant, Herll, in Redcross Street, did their best to excuse the\r\nFlushingers, and begged that “these rough men be not roughly dealt with.”\r\nIt is evident that they looked upon Leicester and the Puritans as their\r\nchampions rather than moderate Burghley, whose approaches to Spain at\r\nthe time were, of course, well known. Herll writes (14th March 1576):\r\n“It is given out by those of good sort who profess the religion, that\r\nyour Lordship has been the only obstacle to this Holland service, by\r\ndissuading her Majesty from the enterprise, when the Earl of Leicester\r\nand several earnest friends were furtherers thereof. They complain that\r\nthese poor men who were sent to the Queen have been, contrary to promise,\r\nkept by indirect dealing so long here, to their utter undoing at home and\r\nabroad. They say that Sir F. Walsingham dealt honestly with them from\r\nthe first. He said they would get nothing, and lose their time. They say\r\nthese unworthy proceedings with foreign nations make the English the most\r\nhated men in the world, and to be contemned for mere abusers, as those\r\nwho put on religion and piety and justice for a cloak to serve humours\r\nwithal. Your Lordship’s enemies, however, are compelled to say that you\r\nare more subject to evil judgment for your good service than for evil\r\nitself.” When Herll spoke to Paul Buiz about Burghley’s anger at the\r\noutrage on Lord Oxford, the Netherlander “struck his breast, and said\r\nyour Lordship was the only man who had dealt sincerely with them, and\r\ntruly favoured their cause, and yet was forced to give them hard words,\r\naccording to the alterations of the time, parties, and occasion, which\r\nkind of free proceeding he preferred of all others.”[395]\r\n\r\nA few months later (August) Herll was made the means of conveying\r\nto Colonel Chester, then with Orange, Lord Burghley’s view of the\r\nsituation. “Her Majesty,” he says, “is so moved by those insolent\r\ndelinges of the Prynce and his Zeelanders, as none dare move her to ani\r\nconsideratyon towards theme, butt all is sett uppon revenge of their\r\nlewd acts and worse speche, and to extermynate them owt of the world,\r\nrather than endure it ani longer. And where the Prynce pretends aid\r\nowt of France, he dawnceth in a nett. If he se not that, her Majesty\r\nknows the contrary, and that herein he is greatly abused, or seeketh to\r\nabuse others, with small credit to hymselfe and less assurans to his\r\nestate when this maske is taken away.”[396] The great indignation about\r\nthe pirates may or may not have been sincere; but it is unquestionable\r\nthat it was the fear expressed of an arrangement between Orange and the\r\nFrench that really caused the disquietude.[397] The remedy to be proposed\r\nto Orange by Chester was simply that he, Orange, should prevent any\r\nrepetition of the piratical outrages of the Flushing men, and apologise\r\nfor them, and his friends in England will move the Queen “to help him\r\nunderhand; but to say that her Majesty will be _forced_ to do anything,\r\nmaugre her will, is a great absurdity.” But if Orange will open his\r\neyes and see things as they are, “somewhat (yea, some round portion)\r\nwill be voluntarily given to the assistance of the cause, and to aid\r\nboth Zeeland and Holland, especially the latter, to which country the\r\nQueen and her Council are greatly inclined.” Orange was a diplomatist as\r\nkeen as Burghley himself, and he well knew that, as a last resource, he\r\ncould always force the hands of the English Government by negotiating\r\nfor aid from France. Elizabeth might swear at his envoys, make friends\r\nwith his enemies the Spaniards, threaten to expend the last man and the\r\nlast shilling she had to turn the French out of Flanders, if ever they\r\nentered; but she always ended in sending aid “underhand” to Orange to\r\nprevent his union with the French; unless, as happened later, the French\r\nwere Huguenots disowned by their own King, and going as her humble\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nLeicester was for ever clamouring for open help to be sent to Orange; the\r\nPuritans, who took their cue from him, were more aggressive than ever in\r\nthe country;[398] but ready as the Queen might be to dally Leicester,\r\nshe took care to make no serious move in the knotty question of the\r\nNetherlands without the advice of her “spirit,” as she nicknamed the\r\ngreat Lord Treasurer.[399] In spite of his almost continual illness, she\r\nsummoned him to her, wherever she might be; and at about the period when\r\nthe letters just quoted were written, the Earl of Sussex writes saying\r\nthat the Queen has just received intelligence from beyond the seas which\r\nshe must discuss with him at once. When Burghley had seen the Queen,\r\neither on that occasion or soon after, and returned home, Sussex writes\r\nthus: “Her Majesty spoke honourably of your Lordship’s deserts, and of\r\nher affection for you, and of your sound, deep judgment and counsel;\r\nusing these words, ‘that no prince in Europe had such a councillor as she\r\nhad of him.’ If your Lordship had heard her speeches, they must needs\r\nhave been to your great contentment. The end of her Majesty’s speeches\r\nwas that she prayed your Lordship to come to Nonsuch, as soon as you\r\nconveniently might.”\r\n\r\nBurghley, indeed, was the only one of her ministers whom she treated\r\nwith anything approaching respect, for he always respected himself.\r\nWalsingham, especially, was the object of her vulgar abuse. “Scurvy\r\nknave” and “rogue” were the terms she frequently applied to him; and\r\nit was apparently not at all an uncommon thing for her, in moments of\r\nimpatience with him, to pluck off her high-heeled shoe and fling it\r\nin his face. Leicester she alternately petted and insulted. After a\r\nsquabble he used to sulk at Wanstead for a few days, till she softened\r\nand commanded him to return, and then the comedy recommenced. Hatton\r\nand Heneage were treated in similar fashion, but with even less\r\nconsideration. Only towards the Lord Treasurer, except for occasional\r\nfits of distrust caused by his enemies, the Queen usually behaved with\r\ndecorum. How careful he was to avoid all cause for doubt is seen by his\r\nanswer to Lord Shrewsbury’s offer of his son as a husband for one of\r\nBurghley’s daughters.[400] It will be recollected that Lord Shrewsbury\r\nhad the custody of the Queen of Scots, and that Burghley had fallen into\r\nsemi-disgrace shortly before, because he had visited Buxton at the same\r\ntime as Mary and her keeper. The match proposed was a good one, and the\r\nLord Treasurer—a new noble—was flattered and pleased at the offer, but\r\ndeclined it, mainly because his enemies had put into the Queen’s head\r\nthat he had gone to Buxton at the instance of the Shrewsburys, to plot in\r\nfavour of Mary; “and hereof at my return to her Majesty’s presence, I had\r\nvery sharp reproofs … with plain charging of me for favouring the Queen\r\nof Scots, and that in so earnest sort, as I never looked for, knowing my\r\nintegrity to her Majesty, but specially knowing how contrariously the\r\nQueen of Scots conceived of me for many things.” He continues his letter\r\nwith an evidently sincere protest of his loyalty and disinterestedness,\r\nand the absence in him of any personal feeling against Mary, but declares\r\nhis determination to do his best, at all costs, to frustrate any\r\nattempted injury against his mistress or her realm.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this small cloud, Burghley went again to Buxton in 1577.\r\nA somewhat curious letter from Leicester, who went to Buxton before him\r\nin June, shows that the Lord Treasurer’s mode of life was not always\r\nprudent. Leicester says that he and his brother are benefiting greatly\r\nfrom the water. “We observe our physician’s orders diligently, and\r\nfind great pleasure both in drinking and bathing in the water. I think\r\nit would be good for your Lordship, but not if you do as we hear your\r\nLordship did last time: taking great journeys abroad ten or twelve miles\r\na day, and using liberal diet with company dinners and suppers. We take\r\nanother way, dining two or three together, having but one dish of meat\r\nat most, and taking the air afoot or on horseback moderately.”[401] In\r\nJuly (1577) Burghley started from Theobalds for his Lincolnshire estates,\r\nand thence to Buxton. Leicester wrote to him there that the Queen was\r\ndesirous of receiving a “tun of Buxton water in hogsheads;” but when\r\nin due time the water arrived, “her Majesty seemeth not to make any\r\ngreat account of it. And yet she more than twice or thrice commanded me\r\nearnestly to write to you for it, and … asked me sundry times whether\r\nI had remembered it or not: but it seems her Majesty doth mistrust it\r\nwill not be of the goodness here it is there; besides, somebody told her\r\nthere was some bruit of it about, as though her Majesty had had some sore\r\nleg. Such like devices made her half angry with me now for sending to\r\nyou for it.”[402] This hint of her sore leg was enough to make Elizabeth\r\nsacrifice a river of Buxton water if necessary. She, like her father\r\nbefore her, really had an issue in one of her legs, and there was no\r\npoint upon which she was more sensitive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n1576-1580\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that from the accession of Henry III. of France in the\r\nautumn of 1574 it suited English policy to draw closer to Spain. An\r\nevent happened, however, late in 1576 which once more changed the entire\r\nposition. Requesens, the Spanish Viceroy of Flanders, had died in March\r\n1576, before his mission of pacification was complete. It is true that\r\nCatholic Flanders and Brabant had been won back again, but Holland\r\nand Zeeland still stood out. The fierce Spanish infantry cared for no\r\ndistinction between Fleming and Hollander, Catholic or Protestant, and\r\nwere openly discontented at the conciliatory policy which Philip’s\r\npenury rendered needful. They were unpaid, for there was no money in the\r\ntreasury to pay them, and soon mutiny, pillage, and murder became the\r\norder of the day. Philip was in despair, and ordered his brother Don Juan\r\nto hurry to Flanders from Italy to pacify and withdraw the troops, and to\r\nconciliate the indignant Catholic Flemings at any cost. Don Juan scorned\r\nand hated the task—which he said a woman could do better than a soldier.\r\nHe was full of a secret plan to dash over to England with the Spanish\r\ninfantry from Flanders; and instead of obeying orders and going direct to\r\nhis new government, he hurried to Spain for the purpose of persuading his\r\nbrother to allow him to have his way.\r\n\r\nThe time thus wasted was fatal. Peace with England was absolutely\r\nnecessary for Philip, and he refused to countenance Don Juan’s plans.\r\nBut Orange had spies everywhere; Burghley’s secretary, Herll, was in\r\nFlanders, and long before Don Juan arrived on the Flemish frontier the\r\nhopes of the murderous rabble of soldiery that the young Prince would\r\nlead them to England were well known to the Lord Treasurer and his\r\nmistress. Early in November 1576 the Spanish fury burst upon Antwerp.\r\nThe Council of Regency consisted mostly of Flemish Catholic nobles, and\r\nthey fought as well as they might against the blood lust of the King’s\r\nsoldiers. When all hope was gone, and the fairest cities of Flanders had\r\nbeen devastated and ruined, and their populations massacred, without\r\ndistinction of age, sex, or creed, then Catholic Flanders turned against\r\nthe wreckers of their homes, and shoulder to shoulder with Orange and\r\nhis Protestants, stood at bay. When Don Juan arrived at Luxemburg he was\r\ninformed that the States would only allow him to take up his governorship\r\non terms to be dictated by them in union with Orange; the first condition\r\nof which was that the Spanish troops must leave the Netherlands\r\nforthwith, _and by land_, in order that they might not invade England.\r\nDon Juan was mad with fury and disappointment; but chafe as he might,\r\nhe had to give way, and in the end was forced to enter Brussels only as\r\nGovernor on sufferance of the States in the spring of 1577.\r\n\r\nTo England there came now to beg for aid and support, not rough\r\nZeelanders alone, not beggars of the sea, not boorish burghers, but the\r\nvery nobles who had often come before as Philip’s representatives—De\r\nCroys, Montmorencis, De Granvelles, Zweveghems, and the like; Catholics\r\nof bluest blood, but ready to claim any help against the Spanish\r\noppressor. Dr. Wilson was sent as English envoy to the States, and\r\nSir John Smith went to Madrid with a formal offer from Elizabeth to\r\nmediate.[403] Philip’s only course was to accept any terms which left\r\nhim even a nominal sovereignty of his Netherlands dominions, and this he\r\ndid, rather than allow Elizabeth to pose as mediatrix between him and\r\nhis subjects. But the altered position in Flanders completely changed\r\nthe attitude of England towards Spain, especially when in the summer of\r\n1577 Don Juan lost patience, broke faith with the Flemings, threw himself\r\ninto the fortress of Namur, and defied the States. England’s traditional\r\nalliance had not been with the crown of Spain, but with the House of\r\nBurgundy as possessor of the Netherlands; and now that Flanders and\r\nBrabant were at one with Holland and Zeeland in upholding their rights\r\nagainst Spain, England was naturally on their side against the foreigner,\r\nquite independently of the question of creed. There was no longer any\r\nconcealment about it.[404] The Duke of Arschot’s brother was at the\r\nEnglish court in September with the acquiescence of Orange, planning an\r\narrangement which seemed to offer a means by which all parties might be\r\nsatisfied. The young Austrian Archduke Mathias, Philip’s nephew, was\r\nsuddenly spirited away from Vienna and installed by the Flemings as\r\nsovereign of Flanders, with Orange as his guide and mentor. An English\r\narmy under Leicester or his brother was to be raised to support him\r\nagainst Don Juan, who was rallying a Catholic force, crying to the Duke\r\nof Guise for help, and making a last appeal to his brother to save his\r\nhonour, if not his sovereignty. The outbreak of the Protestants in Ghent,\r\nencouraged by the proximity of Orange, the capture and imprisonment of\r\nArschot and the Catholic nobles, and the desecration of Catholic shrines\r\n(end of October), forced Philip’s hands. The Archduke Mathias as a\r\ntributary sovereign, with the Catholic Flemings paramount over Orange,\r\nmight have been tolerated; but if the Protestants and Orange were going\r\nto predominate, Spain must fight to the end. So with a heavy heart Philip\r\nbent to the inevitable, and sent Alexander Farnese and a Spanish army\r\nfrom Italy once more to reconquer the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nThe invariable excuse given by Elizabeth for her help to the States\r\nwas, that it was to keep the French out of Flanders; Don Juan’s appeal\r\nto the Guises being especially distasteful to her. “The present support\r\ndesired of her,” she declared, “is only in consideration of the extreme\r\nnecessity of the States by reason of the great preparations in France and\r\nelsewhere to overrun them, and bring utter ruin upon them; and it not\r\ndisagreeing with the ancient treaties between the crown of England and\r\nthe House of Burgundy … the purpose of the States being no other than\r\nby these succours to keep themselves in due obedience to the King their\r\nsovereign, her Majesty is content to grant the aid desired.”[405] The\r\nplausible reasons advanced, however, made no difference to Philip. It was\r\nonly evident to him that the Queen of England was subsidising rebellion\r\nagainst him, and that her subjects held fortresses in his dominions as a\r\npledge for the money she had advanced. He could not afford to declare war\r\nwith England at the time, but he did what he could. The Irish malcontents\r\nwere encouraged with the aid of Papal money; and Catholic plots, with\r\nSpanish and Guisan aid, for the rescue of Mary Stuart, the assassination\r\nof Elizabeth, and the like, kept the English court in alarm,[406] and\r\npointed the moral for ever on the lips of Philip’s many paid agents and\r\nfriends in Elizabeth’s counsels.\r\n\r\nDuring most of the period when the arrangements with the States were\r\nbeing concluded in 1577, Burghley was absent from court, and it may be\r\nfairly assumed that the less cautious attitude adopted towards Spain was\r\nowing to the unchecked influence of Leicester; but with Burghley’s return\r\nlate in the autumn the astute balancing diplomacy of the master-hand\r\nbecomes once more apparent, both in the declaration quoted above, and the\r\nletter drafted by the Treasurer taken by Wilkes, Clerk of the Council,\r\nto Madrid. In it Elizabeth prays Philip to have compassion upon his\r\nFlemish subjects and to grant their just demands, and again explains her\r\nsupport of them. Moderate and deferential, however, as the tone of the\r\nletter was, it did not alter prior facts, and Philip was indignant and\r\nwrathful at what he called an attempt of Elizabeth to lay down the law\r\nfor him. “Send this man off,” he says, “before his fortnight is up, and\r\nbefore he commits some impertinence which will oblige us to burn him.”\r\nPhilip might well be angry, for he was impotent: he had to reconquer his\r\nown Flemings, Catholics and Protestants too, thanks to the aid they had\r\nobtained from Elizabeth. To make matters more galling, Antonio de Guaras\r\nhad suddenly been arrested at dead of night, all his papers captured, his\r\nproperty sequestrated, and the poor man himself accused of consorting and\r\nplotting with the Queen’s enemies.[407] Lord Burghley, his former friend,\r\nwas daily threatening him with the rack in the Tower; and for eighteen\r\nmonths he was treated with calculating contumely and harshness, only\r\nat last to be released, old, broken, and penniless, and sent to Spain\r\nscornfully to die.\r\n\r\nIn January 1578, Don Juan and Farnese defeated the States troops at\r\nGemblours, and it seemed as if once more Flanders and Brabant would fall\r\na prey to Spanish soldiery. Elizabeth’s aid had become less liberal\r\nwith the return of Burghley, who had no objection at all to Spanish\r\npredominance in Catholic Flanders; his only interest there was to keep\r\nthe French out.[408] But the Flemings naturally regarded the position\r\nfrom another point of view. What they wanted was to preserve their\r\nautonomous rights against Spain. Mathias had turned out a broken reed: he\r\nhad no money, no followers, no friends, and no ability; and the really\r\ndominant man in the Government was Protestant Orange. This did not\r\nplease the Catholic nobles, and they cast about for another prince with\r\na greater following than Mathias, who should at once be a Catholic and\r\nyet acceptable to Orange and the Protestants. Catharine had for some time\r\npast anticipated the position, and had been busy, but secretly, pushing\r\nthe claims of her son Alençon; but for her purpose it was necessary to\r\nmanage warily, in order to avoid giving Philip open offence. Alençon,\r\nhowever, was bound by no such considerations. Nothing would have suited\r\nhim better than to draw France into war with Spain. He was under arrest\r\nand strictly guarded, but he contrived, on the 14th February 1578, to\r\nescape out of a second-floor window in the Louvre. All France was in a\r\nturmoil. Huguenots and malcontents flocked to the Flemish frontier, and\r\nCatharine raced half over France to beg her errant son to return. Henry\r\nIII. assured Mendoza, the new Spanish Ambassador on his way to England,\r\nthat his brother was obedient, and he was sure he would do nothing\r\nagainst Philip in Flanders. But all the world knew that he would if he\r\ncould; and that whatever he might do with a French force there would\r\nbe against English as well as Spanish interests. Once more, therefore,\r\nit was necessary for Elizabeth to change her policy somewhat, and Lord\r\nBurghley resumed his favourite character of a friend to the ancient\r\nSpanish alliance.\r\n\r\nThe new Spanish Ambassador saw Elizabeth on the 16th March 1578, and\r\ngave her all sorts of reassuring messages from Philip. He was the most\r\nclement of sovereigns. A successor to Don Juan should be appointed who\r\nshould please everybody, and all would soon be settled. A few days\r\nafterwards Mendoza had a long conversation with Burghley, in the presence\r\nof other Councillors. As Philip had, said the Treasurer, practically\r\naccepted the various concessions to the Flemings recommended by the\r\nQueen; “if the terms offered were not accepted by the States, she herself\r\nwould take up arms against them.” This was probably too strong for\r\nLeicester and Walsingham, Puritans both, and Mendoza says they seemed to\r\nbe urging something upon Burghley very forcibly, which he thought was the\r\nquestion of the withdrawal of the Spanish troops from Flanders; but it\r\nended in Burghley again pointedly offering the Queen’s mediation.\r\n\r\nA few days later the Duke of Arschot’s brother, the Marquis d’Havrey,\r\nLeicester’s great friend, arrived in England to counteract Mendoza’s\r\nefforts, and to beg that the troops that had been promised should be sent\r\nto the States. He was made much of by the English nobles and the Queen,\r\nwho was now greatly influenced by Leicester, and Burghley at the moment\r\nseems to have stood almost alone in his resistance of open aid being sent\r\nto the States.[409] It did not take Mendoza many days to discover how\r\nthings really lay. “I have found the Queen,” he writes, “much opposed to\r\nyour Majesty’s interests, and most of her ministers are quite alienated\r\nfrom us, particularly those who are most important, as although there are\r\nseventeen Councillors … the bulk of the business really depends upon the\r\nQueen, Leicester, Walsingham, and Cecil, the latter of whom, although by\r\nvirtue of his office he takes part in the resolutions, absents himself\r\nfrom the Council on many occasions, as he is opposed to the Queen’s\r\nhelping the rebels so effectively, and thus weakening her own position.\r\nHe does not wish, however, to break with Leicester and Walsingham on\r\nthe matter, they being very much wedded to the States and extremely\r\nself-seeking. I am assured that they are keeping the interest of the\r\nmoney lent to the States, besides the presents they have received out of\r\nthe principal. They urge the business under the cloak of religion, which\r\nCecil cannot well oppose.”[410]\r\n\r\nThis, indeed, was one of the periods when Burghley’s moderating influence\r\nwas overborne by Leicester, Walsingham, and the Puritans. The Lord\r\nTreasurer still did his best—constantly ill though he was—to stem the\r\nviolence of the tide, befriending the bishops who were being bitterly\r\nattacked,[411] and counselling caution in aiding the Flemings against\r\nSpain; but, as we have seen, he was somewhat in the background, and\r\nabsented himself from court as much as possible. It is curious, however,\r\nto see, even under these circumstances, how he was still appealed to\r\nby all parties. He was very ill in April at Theobalds, and the Queen\r\nhappened to be suffering from toothache. Of course Hatton must write to\r\nthe Lord Treasurer, begging him to come to court and give his advice as\r\nto what should be done. The reply is very characteristic. Notwithstanding\r\nhis own pain he would come up at once, he wrote, if by so doing he could\r\nrelieve the Queen; but as the physicians advised that the tooth should\r\nbe extracted, though they dared not tell the Queen so, all he could do\r\nwould be to urge her Majesty to have it done.[412] Hatton did not care\r\nto incur the responsibility of saying so himself, and simply showed\r\nthe Queen Burghley’s letter. Doubtless Elizabeth took the good advice\r\ntendered; for it was only a day or two afterwards that young Gilbert\r\nTalbot, Lord Shrewsbury’s son, was walking in the Tilt Yard, Whitehall,\r\none morning, under the Queen’s windows, when her maiden Majesty herself\r\ncame to the casement in her night-dress, in full view of Talbot, who\r\nwrote: “My eye fell towards her, and she showed to be greatly ashamed\r\nthereof, for that she was unready and in her night-stuff; so when she saw\r\nme after dinner as she went to walk, she gave me a great fillip on the\r\nforehead, and told the Lord Chamberlain how I had seen her that morning,\r\nand how ashamed she was.” Talbot, in writing this to his father (1st May\r\n1578) ends his letter by saying that the Queen was that week to stay\r\nthree or four days with Burghley at Theobalds. It is plain to see that\r\nthe renewed severity against the Catholics in England, and the almost\r\nostentatious aiding of the States against Spain, did not meet with the\r\napproval of Burghley. He was much more concerned for the moment at the\r\nlarge levies of French troops being collected on the Flemish frontier;\r\nand his ordinary policy would have been either to side with the Spaniards\r\nagainst them, or to have disarmed their figurehead Alençon (or Anjou as\r\nhe was now called) by holding out hopes of his marriage with the Queen,\r\nif the earnest attempts of the English to mediate between the States\r\nand Don Juan were fruitless. But he had to reckon with Leicester and\r\nWalsingham, and the Queen’s policy wavered almost daily between her two\r\nsets of counsellors.[413]\r\n\r\nTo the Queen’s visit to Theobalds is doubtless due the entry in\r\nBurghley’s diary of 15th May, recording the despatch of Edward Stafford\r\nto inspect and report upon the French forces on the Flemish frontier.\r\nAlençon himself used every effort to convince the Queen of his desire to\r\nlook to her, rather than to his brother, as his guide and support. On\r\nthe 19th May he sent her a letter by one of his friends, informing her\r\nof his intention of relieving the Netherlands; “of which intention,” he\r\nsays, “she already knows so much that he will not tire her by explaining\r\nit further.” On the 7th July he crossed the frontier, and threw himself\r\ninto Mons for the purpose, as he declared, “of helping this oppressed\r\npeople, and humiliating the pride of Spain;” and at the same time he sent\r\nhis chamberlain to offer marriage to Elizabeth, and assure her of his\r\ncomplete dependence upon her. It was unwelcome news for Elizabeth, for\r\nshe could never trust the French. Alençon, after all, was a Catholic, and\r\nshe was uncertain whether Henry III. was not really behind his brother.\r\nGondi, one of the leaders of Catharine’s counsels, had recently come to\r\nEngland with a request to be allowed to see Mary Stuart;[414] Catholic\r\nintrigues in Scotland had succeeded in putting an end to Morton’s regency\r\n(March 1578); and on all sides there were indications that, if Elizabeth\r\ncould only be dragged into open hostility to Spain, and so rendered\r\npowerless, an attempt would be made on the part of France to recover\r\nits lost influence over Scotland. Mendoza carefully fanned the flame of\r\nElizabeth’s distrust against the French; and the effect of Walsingham’s\r\nabsence in Flanders, whilst Leicester was away at Buxton, is noticeable\r\nat once. “The Queen,” writes Mendoza (19th July), “is now turning her\r\neyes more to your Majesty; and her ministers have begun to get friendly\r\nwith me. If your Majesty wishes to retain them, I see a way of doing\r\nit.”[415]\r\n\r\nAlençon’s agents in the meanwhile were not idle. One after the other came\r\nto assure her of their master’s desire to marry her, and look to her\r\nalone for guidance. He had quarrelled with his brother, he said, and had\r\nno other mistress than the Queen of England. They quite convinced Sussex,\r\napparently, for he entered warmly into their marriage plans, which gave\r\nhim another chance of revenge upon Leicester. Elizabeth’s desire to be\r\namiable to Alençon’s envoys at Long Melford during her progress (August)\r\nled her to insult Sussex, as Lord Steward, about the amount of plate\r\non the sideboard. This gave an opportunity for Lord North, a creature\r\nof Leicester, to give Sussex the lie, and led to a further feud which\r\ncontinued for months.[416]\r\n\r\nBut though Elizabeth was somewhat tranquillised with regard to the French\r\nKing’s connivance in Alençon’s proceedings, she was cool about the\r\nmarriage business. “If the Prince liked to come, she told De Bacqueville,\r\nhe might do so; but he must not take offence if she did not like him\r\nwhen she saw him;” whereupon Burghley told the envoy that if he were\r\nin his place he would not bring his master over on such a message. All\r\nthe charming of Alençon’s attractive agents was unsuccessful in opening\r\nthe Queen’s money bags, and the loan of 300,000 crowns they prayed for\r\nwas refused. If he wanted her aid or affection, she said, he must first\r\nobey her and retire from Flanders, and she would then consider what she\r\nshould do. Pressure was put upon Alençon by his brother, by the Pope\r\nand the Catholics, on the other hand, to desist from his enterprise.\r\nSplendid Catholic alliances were proposed to him, and dire threats of\r\npunishment held out if he did not retire. When the Protestant Hollanders\r\ndiscovered that Alençon could count neither upon England nor France to\r\nsupport him, they began to cry off. The only temptation they had in\r\nwelcoming a Catholic prince was the hope of national aid. If he did not\r\nbring that, he was as useless to them as poor Mathias had been. And so\r\nall through the autumn of 1578 the fate of Flanders hung on Elizabeth’s\r\ncaprice. Henry III. was anxious to get his brother married to Elizabeth,\r\nand a fresh national alliance concluded; but he wished to avoid pledging\r\nhimself against Spain, so as to be able to hold the balance. Elizabeth’s\r\naim was similar, and she would promise nothing; but she swore both to\r\nFlemings and Spaniards that for every Frenchman that set foot in Flanders\r\nthere should be an Englishman. Fresh German mercenaries were raised\r\nat her expense to aid the States; renewed attempts, backed by threats,\r\nwere made to persuade Don Juan to ratify the pacification of Ghent; but\r\nAlençon, in the meanwhile, with a dwindling force and no money, was\r\nfalling to the ground between the two stools of France and England,\r\nHuguenot or Catholic. At the end of the year ominous news came that the\r\nHuguenots had been won over by the Queen-mother;[417] that the King of\r\nFrance had entered into a great Catholic league against Elizabeth, and\r\nwas raising a force of mercenaries in Germany to help Alençon to keep a\r\nfooting in Flanders, in spite of England; whilst a Scottish nobleman, a\r\nDouglas, was at the French court carrying on some secret intrigue with\r\nHenry III.\r\n\r\nElizabeth was alarmed at this, and at once became warm in the Alençon\r\nmarriage, thanks partly also to the arrival of the Prince’s agent Simier,\r\nwho very soon established a complete influence over the Queen, to the\r\ninfinite scandal of all Europe. Against this influence Mendoza, able,\r\nbold, and crafty, battled ceaselessly: for ever pointing at the intrigues\r\nof the French in Scotland, their old jealousy of England, the approaching\r\nmarriageable age of the King of Scots, which would give an opportunity\r\nfor recovering French influence in his country, and much more to the\r\nsame effect. After one conversation of this sort with the Queen, late in\r\nJanuary 1579, Mendoza drove his points home one by one to Burghley and\r\nSussex, showing them how much more profitable was an alliance with Spain\r\nthan with France, and the danger of England herself being attacked if she\r\ntook the Netherlands rebels under her protection. Amongst other things\r\nBurghley replied that “he had told M. Simier that one of the principal\r\narguments in favour of the marriage, namely, that Alençon might become\r\nKing of France, had turned him (Cecil) against it, as he considered that\r\nit would be a disadvantage to England, whereupon Simier had complained\r\nof him to the Queen. For his own part his desire had always been to see\r\nthe Queen married to a prince of the House of Austria, with which it was\r\nwell to be in alliance; but since old friends cast them off, and your\r\nMajesty refused to confirm the treaties, or receive a minister at your\r\ncourt,[418] they must seek new friends.”\r\n\r\nThe current of affairs and the Queen’s fickleness evidently displeased\r\nthe Lord Treasurer. In September (1578) he had unsuccessfully begged\r\nleave of absence to visit Burghley,[419] where the rebuilding of the\r\nmansion was still progressing, under the care of Sir Thomas Cecil. He\r\nwas not allowed to go; but the plague raged in London all the autumn,\r\nand Burghley retreated to Theobalds, where he was within easy reach of\r\nthe Council. He found, moreover, Leicester’s enmity towards him more\r\nactive than ever,[420] and Hatton, now his chief henchman, for Sussex was\r\nunstable, was of inferior rank, influence, and ability. But though his\r\npolitical influence for a time was under a cloud, there was no abatement\r\nof the appeals to his judgment and for his intercession with the Queen.\r\nImprisoned Catholics, deprived Puritans, old friends, like the Duchess\r\nof Suffolk, Lord Lincoln, or the Earl of Bedford, claimed his advice in\r\ntheir affairs; suitors at law besought his good word; miners or explorers\r\nprayed for his patronage; bishops bespoke his aid to govern their clergy;\r\nthe clergy appealed to him against the bishops. High and humble, friend\r\nand stranger, rich and poor alike, looked to Burghley for guidance, and\r\nfound at least patient consideration for their causes.[421]\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1579, however, the aspect of European politics had\r\nbecome so threatening that the practised hand of the Lord Treasurer was\r\nneeded at the helm, and thenceforward his influence was again in the\r\nascendant. Simier was making violent vicarious love to the Queen, and\r\nletters of the most extravagant description were exchanged between the\r\nyoung Prince and Elizabeth, whilst really sincere and earnest efforts\r\nwere being made in favour of the match by Henry III. and Catharine de\r\nMedici. Commissioners and ambassadors went backwards and forwards, and\r\nthe conditions, not only of the Queen’s marriage, but of a national\r\noffensive and defensive alliance between France and England, were under\r\ndiscussion. Henry III. was ready, he said, to submit to any conditions\r\ndesired by Elizabeth, and Alençon was almost blasphemous in his praising\r\nof the charms of his elderly flame. There were two main reasons for\r\nthis drawing together of England and France. Don Juan was dead, and\r\nthe military genius and diplomacy of Alexander Farnese had once more\r\nseparated Catholic Belgium from Protestant Holland (Treaty of Arras,\r\nJanuary 1579). Orange himself still clung to the hope of consolidating\r\na united Flemish nation, including north and south, and desired to use\r\nAlençon, with the Queen of England’s support, for that purpose but\r\nthere was no enthusiasm in Holland for the idea; and in the meanwhile\r\nAlençon was isolated in Catholic Flanders, with his own brother raging\r\nat the compromising position in which he placed him, and ordering him to\r\nreturn to France. It was evident to Henry that the only way in which his\r\nturbulent brother could be established in Flanders, without causing both\r\nSpanish and English arms to be used against him, was to let him depend\r\nsolely upon Elizabeth and Orange, whilst France stood aloof. This was one\r\nof the reasons for the closer relations desired by Catharine and her son.\r\nThe other was more important still. The young King of Portugal had fallen\r\nin battle in Morocco, and the new King was an aged, childless Cardinal.\r\nPhilip of Spain was already intriguing for the succession, which he\r\nclaimed. The possession of the fine harbours and Atlantic seaboard of\r\nPortugal by Spain would enormously increase her maritime potency, to the\r\ndetriment of England and France; and it was felt that these powers must\r\nunite to resist the common danger. That Lord Burghley was early alive to\r\nits importance is proved by a genealogical statement of his relating to\r\nthe Portuguese succession immediately after the death of the King Don\r\nSebastian[422] (August 1578), and several memoranda of subsequent date on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances the Alençon approaches again became to all\r\nappearance serious. The Prince, ceding to the pressure placed upon him,\r\nconsented to retire from Flanders early in the year, and was reconciled\r\nto his brother; and then the arrangements for effective action in the\r\nNetherlands and a visit of Alençon to England were actively proceeded\r\nwith. How busy Lord Burghley was in the matter will be seen by the very\r\nvoluminous minutes in his own hand of the discussions in Council on the\r\nsubject (Hatfield Papers). In all probability the Queen was not even now\r\nsincere in the matter of the marriage, especially as Leicester and Hatton\r\npretended to be warmly in favour of it, until they became personally\r\njealous of Simier; but Burghley was evidently doubtful. In his balancing\r\npapers he gives much more space to the “perils” than to the advantages\r\nof the match, and his own final judgment is, that “except that her\r\nMajesty would of her own mind incline to marriage he would never advise\r\nthereto.” In the meanwhile, all England was in a veritable panic at the\r\nidea of the marriage of the Queen to a Papist. Puritan pulpits rang with\r\ndenunciations; Stubbs’ famous book, “The Discovery of a Gaping Gulph,”\r\nwhich cost the author his right hand and deeply offended the Queen, was\r\nread widely; and the Queen herself was obliged to warn her eager suitor\r\nof the hatred of her people to the idea of his proposed visit. But the\r\npreparations went on, and the court was ordered to make itself as fine\r\nas money would make it, Leicester alone sending to Flanders for twelve\r\nhundred pounds’ worth of silks, velvets, and cloth of gold. Simier in the\r\nmeanwhile was daily becoming more clamorous for a definite answer to his\r\nmaster’s proposal. Large bribes were paid by the French Ambassador and\r\nMendoza respectively to the Councillors to forward or impede the match,\r\nand the probabilities shifted from day to day.[423]\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen seemed really bent upon the match, Burghley did not\r\nattempt to oppose her; he simply placed before her the arguments for and\r\nagainst it, and left the decision to her. This is exactly what Elizabeth\r\ndid not wish. Simier and her own imprudence had drawn her into an\r\nextremely dangerous position, and she wished her Council to assume the\r\nresponsibility of extricating her from it. Her first object in resuming\r\nthe negotiations had been to get Alençon and the French out of Flanders,\r\nwhilst preventing the despair and collapse of Orange; her present aim\r\nwas to secure the King of France to her side, and weaken Spain without\r\nherself being drawn into open hostility. The talk of marriage helped her\r\nin this; but if once she fell into the trap, and was married indeed, her\r\npower of balance would be gone. Driven into a corner, late in April she\r\ntook Simier and the French Ambassador, with Burghley, Leicester, Sussex,\r\nand Walsingham, to Wanstead, where she desired the Councillors to give\r\nher in writing their individual opinions, in order that she might show\r\nthem to the Frenchmen. They refused to do so, and once more laid before\r\nher the “perils and advantages” of each course, leaving her to decide.\r\nThe Councillors mentioned sat in conference almost day and night during\r\ntheir three days’ stay at Wanstead, but, after all, returned as they\r\ncame. Simier was furious, and threatened to go back to France; and a full\r\nCouncil sat at Whitehall on the 3rd May, from two o’clock in the day till\r\ntwo the next morning, finally to discuss the question. It was found that\r\nthe only man really in favour of the marriage was Sussex, and Simier was\r\ncalled in and informed that his master’s conditions were unacceptable.\r\nThe envoy roared out that he had been played with, and flung out of\r\nthe room to make his complaint to the Queen. She was all sympathy. She\r\nwanted to get married—she must get married. It was all the fault of her\r\nCouncillors, and so forth, until her ruffled “ape,” as she called him,\r\nwas pacified. Alençon was not lightly put off. He announced his intention\r\nof coming to see his goddess, no matter what the consequences might be.\r\nThe Queen was for refusing him leave, but Lord Burghley pointed out to\r\nher the danger of this open affront to a French prince. She had gone too\r\nfar to refuse, and she was obliged to give a passport. Simier rarely\r\nleft the Queen’s side now, and she seems quite to have lost her head.\r\nMendoza worked hard to spread the sinister murmurs of her behaviour\r\nthrough the country. Leicester grew violently jealous, and twice hired\r\nan assassin to kill Simier, which he nearly did once in the Queen’s own\r\nbarge. The Queen was beside herself with rage, and Simier, to revenge\r\nhimself upon Leicester, told the Queen, as no one else had dared to do,\r\nof the marriage of Leicester with Lady Essex. It was a master-stroke. The\r\nQueen’s fury was boundless, and she swore like a trooper at Leicester and\r\nthe she-wolf he had married. For a time Leicester’s influence was gone,\r\nand Simier lived in the palace of Greenwich, to the open disgust of the\r\nEnglish people. In August, Alençon rushed over to England in disguise.\r\nHis coming was an open secret, but the Queen kept him hid in the palace\r\nof Greenwich.[424] She posed before him, showed off all her charms, dined\r\nand supped with him in private, fell desperately in love with him, or\r\npretended to do so, and sent him off after a week’s stay as secretly as\r\nhe came, with expressions of affection on both sides, even too fervid to\r\nbe sincere, and long afterwards continued by correspondence.\r\n\r\nWhatever might be the final result of the marriage negotiations—and\r\nBurghley himself was as much in the dark as any one on that point—a close\r\nalliance between France and England was of growing importance to both\r\ncountries. The English Council under Burghley sat at Greenwich almost\r\ncontinuously from the 2nd to the 8th October discussing, weighing, and\r\nreporting upon the whole question of alliance and marriage. The final\r\nresult was that the marriage would be undesirable, Burghley and Sussex\r\nbeing the only Councillors who were not strongly opposed to it.[425]\r\nThe message to the Queen was delivered by Burghley. It was ambiguous\r\nand moderate, begged the Queen to tell the Council her own mind, and\r\nso on; but there was no doubt of the meaning of it to the Queen. The\r\nCouncil was against the match, unless some guarantee could be found that\r\nthe Protestant religion should not be imperilled. Burghley’s minute\r\nsets forth the Queen’s answer. “She shed many tears to find that her\r\nCouncillors, by their long disputations, should make it doubtful whether\r\nit would be safe for her to marry and have a child.” She was a simpleton,\r\nshe said, to have referred the question to them. She expected they would\r\nhave unanimously begged her to marry, instead of raising doubts about\r\nit. When they saw her again later in the day she was more angry still.\r\nShe railed at those who would think of “surety” before her happiness,\r\n“and that any should think so slenderly of her” as to doubt that she\r\nwould take care that religion was properly safeguarded if she married.\r\nShe managed, as usual, to reduce the Council to a state of confusion\r\nwith her tears and reproaches; and a hasty meeting was called, at which\r\na resolution was passed to the effect, that as the Queen seemed so much\r\nbent upon the marriage, the Councillors all offered their services to\r\npromote it. When this message was taken to her, Lord Burghley records\r\nthat “her Majesty’s answers were very sharp in reprehending all such\r\nas she thought would make arguments against her marriage, and though\r\nshe thought it not meet to declare to them whether she would marry with\r\nMonsieur or no, yet she looked from their hands that they should with one\r\naccord have made a special suit to her for the same.”[426]\r\n\r\nNo wonder that with such a change on the part of the Queen from morning\r\nto afternoon, the Councillors were at their wits’ end to know what she\r\nreally meant; but it is evident that she intended to have her own way,\r\nwhatever it was, and lay the responsibility upon others. Burghley and\r\nSussex had avoided open opposition, and were favourably regarded by the\r\nQueen in consequence; whilst Leicester, Walsingham, Knollys, and even her\r\npoor “sheep” Hatton, came in for a share of her vituperation and abuse;\r\nand the Puritans who were leading the outcry against the match received\r\nharder measure than ever.\r\n\r\nEarly in November she summoned the Council again, and told them that she\r\nhad decided to marry. It was only for them now to consider the means.\r\nLet them, she said, individually put their opinions in writing. It was\r\nevident that this course would again bring forward the dissensions on the\r\nsubject, and render it more difficult, which was perhaps her intention.\r\nSimier went and told her so, whereupon she asked him angrily how he knew\r\nwhat orders she had given to her Council. He replied that Lord Burghley\r\nhad told him. “Surely,” she cried, “it is possible for my Councillors to\r\nkeep a secret. I will see to this.” Then she sent orders to the Council\r\nto write a letter to Alençon, asking him to come to England quickly,\r\nwhich they refused to do. He was, they said, coming to marry her, not\r\nthem, and she ought to write herself. They openly quarrelled with Simier,\r\nwho was finding England too hot for him, and who left late in November,\r\ntaking with him a hastily patched draft agreement for the marriage,\r\nin which the Queen characteristically introduced at the last hour an\r\nadditional loophole of escape, by stipulating that the articles should\r\nremain in suspense for two months, “during which time the Queen hopes to\r\nhave brought her people to consent. If before that time she did not write\r\nconsenting to receive ambassadors for the conclusion of the treaty, the\r\nwhole of the conditions would be void.”[427]\r\n\r\nThe year 1580 opened full of anxiety for Elizabeth. The ostentatious\r\nfitting out of the Spanish fleet, and the active support by Spain\r\nand the Pope of the Desmond rebellion, the success of Parma, and the\r\ndesperate attempts of Orange to reunite Flanders with Holland under\r\nAlençon in the national cause, were all so many dangers to England. If\r\nElizabeth offended France or alienated Alençon himself, Flemish affairs\r\nmight be settled without her participation, and to her detriment, and\r\nshe would have to face Spain alone. This was the more to be feared, as\r\nreligious affairs in England were in a worse condition than before,\r\nand for the first time since her accession the Queen herself was\r\nunpopular. Her light conduct with Simier, and, above all, her seeming\r\ndetermination in favour of the Alençon marriage, had aroused all the old\r\nhatred against the French, and had embittered the widespread Puritan\r\ndistrust of the “Papists.” The country was being flooded with seminary\r\npriests, specially trained for the propaganda to which they devoted\r\ntheir lives,[428] and the great Catholic party in England, having\r\nrecovered somewhat from the blow of the Norfolk conspiracy, were once\r\nmore holding up their heads. Elizabeth had allowed Leicester and her own\r\npassions to lead her too far, and she struggled to free herself from the\r\ntoils. When she tried in January to withdraw gently from the Alençon\r\nnegotiations, and suggested to Henry III. that some fresh conditions\r\nwere necessary, she found it difficult. The King was determined to throw\r\nthe responsibility of breaking upon her, and it still suited him to\r\nkeep up an appearance of friendship. She could, he replied, make her\r\nown stipulations; he would accept them. As for religion, that was his\r\nbrother’s affair. Alençon himself also said that he would come over\r\nat once to England and leave everything to her. He hoped she was not\r\nreviving the religious question for the purpose of deceiving him again,\r\nas some people said; but he would risk everything for his love. He went\r\nso far as to beg her to forgive Leicester for his sake, and blamed Simier\r\nfor quarrelling with the Earl.\r\n\r\nBut Leicester, Hatton, and Walsingham were quite determined now to stop\r\nthe marriage, which looked too serious to please them; and a cloud of\r\nquestions about religion, rank of ambassadors, &c., soon threw the\r\nmatter into obscurity again. How completely affairs had changed in this\r\nrespect in a few weeks is seen in the long draft of a letter to the\r\nQueen at Hatfield, dated at end of January 1580, in the handwriting of\r\nSir Thomas Cecil, although it can hardly have been really written by\r\nhim to the Queen, but certainly represents the views of his father.\r\nBurghley had struggled during all his ministry, and often against\r\ngreat difficulties, to preserve peace with Spain, whilst holding high\r\nEngland’s honour and prosperity; but now that Leicester and the extreme\r\nProtestant party, together with Philip’s seizure of Portugal, had forced\r\nthe Queen into a position which sooner or later must end in hostility to\r\nSpain, and perhaps with France also, Burghley urged the need for a close\r\nunderstanding with France, on the safest terms possible for his country.\r\n\r\nThe course now taken by the Queen seemed to render inevitable that which\r\nBurghley had all his life endeavoured to avoid, namely, the isolation\r\nof England with both of the great powers against her. The address above\r\nreferred to lays down that, so long as the Queen was favourable to the\r\nAlençon marriage, the writer was willing to sacrifice his life for it.\r\nHe still maintains that it is the only safe course, and one which should\r\nenable the Queen to “rule the sternes of the shippes of Europe with\r\nmore fame than ever came to any Quene of the Worelld.” But finding her\r\nMajesty utterly against it, he proposes such remedies as are necessary,\r\nat least for comparative safety. He points out that she cannot expect\r\nthat France and Alençon will sit down patiently under the slight, though\r\nthey may dissemble for a time; and he suggests that Alençon should be\r\ndiverted from allying himself with Spain, by encouraging his enterprise\r\nin the Netherlands, dangerous though such a course was to England.\r\nAll Papists should be dismissed from positions of trust; the army,\r\nnavy, and fortifications should be placed on a war-footing; mercenary\r\nGermans should be bespoken; fresh vents for English commerce should be\r\nsought;[429] the Irish should be conciliated, and their just grievances\r\nremedied, and “certain private disorders in Ireland winked at.” The\r\nQueen of Scots should be brought to a safer place farther south, and\r\nrepressive precautions taken against her friends in England. Whoever may\r\nhave given this remarkable state paper to Elizabeth,[430] it is certain\r\nthat the advice contained in it was followed. Orders were given to\r\nbring Mary Stuart to Ashby-de-la-Zouch,[431] the mild and lenient Lord\r\nShrewsbury being reinforced in his guard by Sir Ralph Sadler and two\r\nother known Protestants;[432] a general muster of militia was summoned,\r\n90,000 men in all; London was called upon for 4000 armed men; the\r\nQueen’s navy, seventeen ships, was mobilised;[433] and negotiations were\r\nopened for Condé and a Huguenot force, with a number of mercenary German\r\nProtestants, to enter Flanders.[434] It was considered rightly that if a\r\nlarge body of Huguenots depending entirely upon England were by Alençon’s\r\nside, it would not only prevent his brother from supporting him, but\r\nwould render his enterprise in Flanders less dangerous to England.\r\n\r\nConcurrently with these precautions, the Queen renewed her extravagant\r\nlove correspondence with Alençon. There is no more remarkable instance\r\nthan this of the consummate statesmanship of Burghley. The country\r\nhad been driven out of the straight course in which he had held it so\r\nlong, and was rapidly nearing the breakers. The document now under\r\nconsideration laid before the Queen the only course which could avert\r\ndestruction, and this course, as we see, she wisely took. If Burghley\r\nhad openly opposed Leicester and Walsingham from the first, he would\r\nprobably have fallen into disgrace, and have lost his influence entirely;\r\nbut by holding aloof and tempering their policy only, he was able,\r\nwhen catastrophe impended, to lead the ship of state into a harbour of\r\ncomparative safety. Under the influence of fear and Burghley, the Queen\r\nat the same time became most amiable to the Spaniards again. She assured\r\nMendoza (20th February) that “she would never make war upon your Majesty,\r\nunless you began it first, which she could not believe by any means you\r\nwould do.” She was, she said, a sister to Philip. “She had always done\r\nher best for the tranquillity of the Netherlands, and to prevent the\r\nFrench from getting a footing there.” Mendoza spoke some hard truths to\r\nher, but she was very humble.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, when the French Ambassador had been driving her\r\ninto a corner about Alençon, and threatening that the Prince would\r\npublish her letters, she was closeted in her chamber at Whitehall with\r\nBurghley and Archbishop Sandys. “Here am I,” she cried, “between Scylla\r\nand Charybdis. Alençon has agreed to all my conditions, and wants to know\r\nwhen he is to come and marry me. If I fail he will probably quarrel with\r\nme, and if I marry him I shall not be able to govern the country. What\r\nshall I do?” Sandys gave a courtier-like reply, and Burghley was silent.\r\nThe Queen was impatient at this, and roughly told him he was purposely\r\nabsenting himself from the Council. What was his advice? Thus pressed,\r\nthe Lord Treasurer replied that if it was her pleasure to marry she\r\nshould do so, as Alençon had accepted the terms which rendered her safe.\r\n“That,” said the Queen, “is not the opinion of the rest of the Council,\r\nbut that I should keep him in play.” Burghley was aware of this already,\r\nand dryly told the Queen that those who tried to trick princes generally\r\nended by being caught themselves. But Elizabeth knew her profound powers\r\nof dissimulation better even than Burghley did, and went on her way. The\r\nLord Treasurer stood almost alone among the councillors in his mild and\r\ncautious policy. Sussex, in deep dudgeon, was generally at his mansion\r\nat Newhall; and, as we have seen, Burghley himself avoided as much as\r\npossible incurring responsibility for the present action of the Queen,\r\nexcept so far as to advise her how to render her policy as little harmful\r\nas possible. But it is evident that Elizabeth, in moments of difficulty\r\nlike this, always turned away from Leicester, and sought the sounder aid\r\nof the Lord Treasurer.\r\n\r\nLeicester, in March, pretended to fall ill, and during his absence from\r\ncourt completely turned round. Now that Lord Burghley was urging for a\r\nclose friendship with France, since Leicester’s policy had alienated\r\nSpain, the Earl, with characteristic instability, suddenly professed to\r\nMendoza a desire to “serve the King of Spain.” His enemies, he said,\r\nwere plotting this French alliance and marriage only to spite him, and\r\nhe would bring the Queen to a close friendship to Spain. The Queen was,\r\ndoubtless, aware of Leicester’s change; because when Castelnau, the\r\nFrench Ambassador, addressed Elizabeth with an important message from\r\nCatharine, proposing that a joint effort should be made to prevent the\r\ndomination of Portugal by Philip (17th April 1580), he was referred to\r\nBurghley alone, and only after the decision had been adopted not to\r\ncommence hostilities, as suggested, was Leicester let into the secret.\r\nDangerous as it was to England that Philip should dominate Portugal, it\r\nwas of more importance to France; and it was determined to cast upon the\r\nlatter power, if possible, the responsibility of preventing it.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of a serious cause for dissension between France and Spain\r\nwas, indeed, a welcome one for Elizabeth, and she made the most of it.\r\nThe star of Morton in Scotland was waning fast, and D’Aubigny, Earl\r\nof Lennox, had already gained a complete command of the young King’s\r\naffection. Mary Stuart from her captivity was taking the grave step of\r\nlaying herself, her country, and her child at the feet of the King of\r\nSpain, with the acquiescence this time of the Duke of Guise. The English\r\nGovernment, however, was not yet aware of this, and looked upon France\r\nas more likely than Spain to influence Scotland under D’Aubigny.[435]\r\nDivision in France was consequently promoted by Leicester and his party.\r\nAlençon was warned not to be too pliant in agreeing with his brother;\r\nand when Condé and Navarre once again raised the Huguenot standard, the\r\nformer rushed over to England to beseech for funds (June 1580), and\r\nwas received several times in secret by the Queen and Leicester. He\r\nimmediately sent a message to his adherents in France that all was well,\r\nand that assistance would be given to him.\r\n\r\nAfter some days the Queen sent word to Castelnau, the French Ambassador,\r\nsaying that she had heard that Condé was in England, but she would not\r\nreceive him except in the Ambassador’s presence. Burghley, writing to\r\nSussex, says that on arriving at Nonsuch from Theobalds, “I came hither\r\nabout five o’clock, and repairing towards the Privy Chamber to see her\r\nMajesty, I found the door at the upper end shut, and understood that the\r\nFrench Ambassador and the Prince of Condé had been a long time there with\r\nher Majesty, with none others of the Council but my Lord of Leicester\r\nand Mr. Vice-Chamberlain Hatton.” After the audience Castelnau went to\r\nBurghley and complained of Condé for raising disturbances in France. “He\r\naugmenteth his suspicions upon the sight of the great favours shown to\r\nthe Prince of Condé by certain Councillors here, whom he understandeth\r\nhave been many times with him (Condé) at the banqueting-house where he is\r\nlodged.” The Queen told Burghley that Condé had asked for a contribution\r\nof one-third of the cost of a Huguenot rising, the King of Navarre\r\nand the German Protestants paying the other two-thirds; but the Lord\r\nTreasurer’s opinion of it is sufficiently expressed in the following\r\nwords, which probably decided the question, for Condé did not get the aid\r\nhe sought notwithstanding Leicester’s efforts: “I wish her Majesty may\r\nspend some portion to solicit them for peace … but to enter into war and\r\ntherewith to break the marriage, and so to be left alone as subject to\r\nthe burden of such a war, I think no good counsellor can allow.”[436]\r\n\r\nThe fact that he had not been personally consulted earlier did not\r\napparently ruffle Lord Burghley. In his quiet, prudent way he brought\r\nthings round to his view, without caring for the personal aspect. Not\r\nso, irritable, hot-tempered Sussex. He replied in boiling indignation\r\nagainst Leicester—“I have never heard word from my Lord Leicester, Mr.\r\nVice-Chamberlain, or Mr. Secretary Walsingham, of the coming of the\r\nPrince of Condé, or of his expectations, or to seek to know what I\r\nthought fit to do in his cause; whereby I see either they seek to keep\r\nthe whole from me, or else care little for my opinion … perhaps at my\r\ncoming some of them will mislike I am made such a stranger … I can give\r\nas good a sound opinion as the best of them … I am very loath to see\r\nmy sovereign lady to be violently drawn into war.”[437] In any case,\r\nBurghley’s unaided efforts were sufficient to prevent the Queen from\r\ngiving money to Condé, and thus setting the King of France against her\r\nas well as the King of Spain. She was, indeed, in a month, so completely\r\nturned by Lord Burghley’s influence as to exert herself to bring about\r\nsome sort of accord between Henry III. and the Huguenots.[438]\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the year the haggling between Elizabeth and Alençon\r\nwent on. The deputies of the States, after much discussion, offered\r\nthe sovereignty to the French Prince, whose letters to the Queen grew\r\nmore preposterous than ever. It was evident that if he went too far\r\nin the Protestant direction to please Elizabeth he would be useless\r\nas a means for attracting the Catholic Flemings to cordial union with\r\nOrange; whereas an uncompromising Catholic attitude, or any appearance\r\nof depending upon his brother for armed aid, would have been fiercely\r\nresisted both by the English and the Hollanders. Many points therefore\r\nhad to be reconciled, and the Queen kept the affair mainly in her own\r\nhands, playing upon the hopes, fears, and ambitions of Alençon with the\r\ndexterity of a juggler.\r\n\r\nBurghley’s main efforts in the meanwhile were directed to preventing her\r\nfrom drifting into war, either with France or Spain. When the envoys\r\ncame from the Portuguese pretender, Don Antonio, they brought bribes and\r\npresents in plenty for Leicester, who entertained them splendidly, and\r\nurged their suit for assistance for their master; but again Lord Burghley\r\npointed out to the Queen the expense she would incur and the risks she\r\nwould run in a war with Spain, and one Ambassador after another went back\r\ndiscomfited, whilst Leicester pocketed their bribes, and alternately\r\nraged and sulked when his advice was not followed.\r\n\r\nThere were others besides Leicester whose recklessness or greed was\r\ndragging England to the brink of a war with Spain, in spite of Burghley’s\r\nefforts. Strong as was the great statesman’s interest in increasing the\r\nlegitimate trade of the country, we have seen that from the beginning\r\nof Hawkins’ voyages to the West Coast of Africa, and thence to South\r\nAmerica with slaves, Burghley had refused any participation in the\r\nsyndicates that financed them. He had, it is true, on more than one\r\noccasion repudiated the claim of the Spaniards, and especially of the\r\nPortuguese, to exclusive dominion of the western world by virtue of the\r\nPope’s bull, but he had always frowned upon the filibustering attempts\r\nof the syndicates, under the auspices of some of the aldermen of London,\r\nto establish posts in territory occupied by other Christian powers, or\r\nto force trade upon established settlements against the will of the\r\nauthorities. He had honestly done his best to check robbery in the\r\nChannel by those who called themselves privateers, and almost alone of\r\nthe Councillors, he had no share or interest in the piratical ventures\r\nunder the English flag which had committed such destructive depredations\r\nupon shipping.\r\n\r\nThe attack upon Hawkins’ fleet at San Juan de Ulloa, 1568, had aroused\r\nfierce and not unnatural indignation amongst sailors and merchants in\r\nEngland; but the expedition was in defiance of the Spanish law, in a\r\nport belonging to and occupied by Spain, and it is more than doubtful\r\nwhether Burghley advised the seizure of the specie belonging to Philip,\r\nin December 1568, in reprisal for the attack. There were ample reasons,\r\nand an excellent legal pretext, for the seizure of the money without\r\nthat. In fact it was a master-stroke of policy which the foolish rashness\r\nof De Spes had put into Burghley’s power, and the latter and Elizabeth\r\nnaturally welcomed the opportunity of crippling Alba. But when it became\r\na question of revenging San Juan de Ulloa by the despatch of a strong\r\narmed expedition against Spanish colonies, Lord Burghley looked askance\r\nat what might well be made a _casus belli_ by Spain, and could only\r\nenrich the mariners and shareholders who took part in it.\r\n\r\nDrake’s raid upon Nombre-de-Dios, 1573, had been robbery pure and simple,\r\ncarried out swiftly and secretly, so that the authorities at home had no\r\nopportunity, even if they had the will, to prevent it; and Drake kept\r\nout of the way for nearly three years afterwards, to escape punishment.\r\nBut in 1577 he was introduced by Walsingham or Hatton to the Queen,[439]\r\nwho told him that she wished to be revenged upon the King of Spain, and\r\nthat he, Drake, was the man to do it. When Drake explained his plan for\r\na great piratical raid into the Pacific, the Queen swore by her crown\r\nthat she would have any man’s head who informed the King of Spain of it;\r\nand, says Drake, “her Majesty gave me special commandment that of all\r\nmen my Lord Treasurer should not know it.” But the preparations for the\r\nvoyage could not be kept secret entirely from Burghley, who was well\r\nserved by spies, and had many means of winning men. He could not prohibit\r\nthe expedition, of course; but, as usual, he sought to render it as\r\ninnocuous as possible. Thomas Doughty, presumably a barrister, certainly\r\na man of questionable character, had become Hatton’s secretary, and was\r\ndeep with Drake in the plans for the expedition. The whole business is\r\nsomewhat obscure, but Lord Burghley appears to have bought this man to\r\nhis interests, and, according to Doughty himself, to have offered him the\r\npost of his private secretary, which, however, is unlikely. In any case,\r\nhe learned from him all that there was to know about Drake’s intentions,\r\nand when, in November 1577, Drake’s expedition sailed, Doughty\r\naccompanied it as Burghley’s secret agent, and, it may charitably be\r\nsurmised, for the express purpose of moderating if not frustrating its\r\naction. First he tried to desert with his ship, and was duly chased and\r\nbrought back by Drake. Then he was accused of attempting to sow discord,\r\ndiscouragement, and mutiny amongst the men, and Drake hanged him with\r\nhis own hands on the coast of Patagonia.[440] Winter, the other captain,\r\ndrifted back to England again from Tierra del Fuego, whilst Drake in the\r\nlittle _Pelican_ went on his great voyage of plunder round the world.\r\nAll Europe rang with the news of his ravages in the South Seas, and the\r\nshareholders, says Mendoza, “are beside themselves with joy.” But the\r\nfeelings of peaceful English merchants, and of Burghley himself, were far\r\ndifferent. They saw that Spain had been attacked wantonly, her mariners\r\nhanged, her treasure stolen without legal excuse, her sacred edifices\r\nransacked, and it was felt that a war of retaliation was inevitable, in\r\nwhich all England would suffer for the dishonest profit of a few.\r\n\r\nOne day towards the end of September 1580, after an absence of nearly\r\nthree years, when most people had given up Drake for lost, the _Pelican_\r\nsailed quietly into Plymouth Sound, bringing in her hold plundered\r\nriches incalculable. Drake posted up to London, hoping doubtless that\r\nElizabeth’s greed would overcome her fears of war. He was closeted for\r\nsix hours with the Queen; but when he was summoned to the Council not\r\none of his own backers was there, but only Burghley, Sussex, Crofts—a\r\nSpanish agent—and Secretary Wilson. They ordered all his treasure to be\r\nbrought to the Tower, and a precise inventory made of it, preliminary\r\nto its restitution. When the order was taken to Leicester, Walsingham,\r\nand Hatton, they refused to sign, and exerted their influence with the\r\nQueen to get it suspended. Mendoza raged and threatened. The Queen was\r\nin mortal fear of war, and had promised that Drake should be punished if\r\nhe came back. But she loved money, and was not blind to the injury that\r\nhad been done to her probable foe by Drake’s boldness. So she temporised\r\nas usual, accepted Drake’s presents graciously, and gradually came round\r\nto making a hero of the great seaman, in spite of Mendoza’s talk of war\r\nand vengeance. She must have proofs against Drake before she punished\r\nhim, she said. Besides, what were the Spanish troops doing in Ireland?\r\nWhen the last Spanish-Papal soldier was withdrawn, she would talk about\r\nthe restitution of Drake’s plunder—not before.[441] At present she was\r\nthe aggrieved party. Gifts and bribes showered from Drake upon the\r\nCouncillors; but when Burghley was offered 3000 crowns’ worth of fine\r\ngold, he refused it, saying he could not receive a present from a man who\r\nhad stolen all he had,[442] and Sussex also declined any portion of the\r\nbooty. Once more it was Burghley’s task to avert or provide against the\r\nwar with Spain, which the ineptitude and cupidity of others had brought\r\nwithin measurable distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n1581-1584\r\n\r\n\r\nAlençon had nominally accepted the sovereignty of Flanders offered to him\r\nby the States of Ghent in the autumn of 1580; but whilst the Huguenots\r\nwere in arms against his brother, he had no force of men to enable him to\r\nenter and assume the government of his new dominion. He had industriously\r\nstriven to draw Elizabeth into a marriage, or into aiding him in Flanders\r\nas a price for her jilting him; but she had always been too clever for\r\nhim, and kept on the right side of a positive compromise. When the\r\nfears of war with Spain engendered in England by Drake’s depredations\r\nbecame acute, and the Spanish aid to the Irish rebels could no longer\r\nbe concealed, it was necessary once more for England to draw close to\r\nFrance. A request was accordingly sent for a special French embassy to\r\ncome to England empowered to settle the details of the Alençon marriage\r\nand a national alliance. Elizabeth’s letters to Alençon became more\r\naffectionate than ever: she promised him 200,000 crowns of Drake’s\r\nplunder to pay German mercenaries to support him in Flanders, she sent\r\nthe lovelorn Prince a wedding-ring, she petted and bribed his agent until\r\nher own courtiers were all jealous; and under the influence of Burghley\r\nand Sussex, once more the marriage negotiations assumed a serious aspect,\r\nwhilst Leicester and Hatton chafed in the background.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the seminary priests and missionaries, in conjunction\r\nwith the Papal invasion of Ireland, had been answered in England by\r\nfresh severity against the Catholics. The gaols were all full to\r\noverflowing with English recusants; fresh proclamations were issued\r\nagainst harbouring priests; and spies at home and abroad were following\r\nthe ubiquitous movements of the zealous young members of the Society of\r\nJesus, who yearned for the crown of martyrdom. There is no doubt that\r\nto some extent the new persecution of the Catholics was for the purpose\r\nof reconciling the Puritans to the Alençon match, but it was still more\r\nowing to the genuine alarm of a war against Spain and the Pope.\r\n\r\nParliament opened on the 16th January 1581, after twenty-four\r\nprorogations, this only being its third session, although it was elected\r\nin 1572. We have already seen that the Puritan party was strong in\r\nthe House of Commons, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Walter\r\nMildmay, in his speech, voiced the general feeling of the country at\r\nthe dangers that seemed impending. “Our enemies sleep not,” he said,\r\n“and it behoveth us not to be careless, as though all were past; but\r\nrather to think that there is but a piece of the storm over, and that\r\nthe greater part of the tempest remaineth behind, and is like to fall\r\nupon us by the malice of the Pope, the most capital enemy of the Queen\r\nand this State.”[443] He denounced the “absolutions, dispensations,\r\nreconciliations, and such other things of Rome. You see how lately he\r\n(the Pope) hath sent hither a sort of hypocrites, naming themselves\r\nJesuits, a rabble of vagrant friars, newly sprung up, running through\r\nthe world to trouble the Church of God.” The aim of the oration, of\r\ncourse, was to lead the House to vote liberal supplies for the defence\r\nof the country, and in this it was successful; though, when the Puritan\r\nmajority endeavoured to appoint days of fasting and humiliation by\r\nParliamentary vote, they were rapped over the knuckles by the Queen,\r\nas they had been in the previous session, for interfering with her\r\nprerogative.[444]\r\n\r\nThe country, in fact, was now thoroughly alive to the danger into which\r\nit had drifted, and Lord Burghley’s hand once more took the tiller,\r\nto remedy, so far as he might, the evils which had resulted from the\r\ntemporary abandonment of his cautious policy.[445] His task was not an\r\neasy one to settle the preliminaries of the pompous embassy which was\r\nto come from France. There were a host of questions to be considered.\r\nThe Queen would insist upon the Ambassadors being of the highest rank,\r\nand having full powers. Leicester and Hatton objected to their coming at\r\nall; Alençon insisted that they should be only empowered to negotiate a\r\nmarriage, and not an alliance; whilst Cobham, the English Ambassador,\r\nendeavoured ineffectually to draw Henry III. into a pledge to break\r\nwith Spain about Portugal before the embassy left France. At last all\r\nwas arranged, and in April the Ambassadors, with a suite of two hundred\r\npersons, arrived in London.[446] Drake’s silver was drawn upon liberally\r\nfor presents; a new gallery was built at Whitehall for the entertainment\r\nof the envoys; Philip Sidney wrote a masque, and played the fool for once\r\nfor their delectation; and joust and tourney, ball and banquet, succeeded\r\neach other hourly, to the exclusion of more serious business.\r\n\r\nLeicester had done his best to stop the embassy, but without effect,\r\nand wrote to Lord Shrewsbury that he “was greatly troubled at these\r\ngreat lords coming.”[447] He tried to work upon the Queen’s weak side,\r\nby assuring her that the one object of the Frenchmen was to lead her\r\ninto heavy expenditure, and so to enfeeble her, that she might the more\r\neasily be conquered.[448] This, at all events, caused some restriction in\r\nthe expenditure; for the Queen suddenly discovered that it would not be\r\ndignified for her to entertain the Ambassadors or pay for horses until\r\nthey actually arrived in London. Burghley may be presumed to have been\r\ndelighted at their coming, for he made no effort to limit the cost of\r\nhis banquet to them at Cecil House, in the Strand, which was one of the\r\nmost splendid entertainments offered to them. There is in the Lansdowne\r\nMSS. a full relation of this splendid feast of the 30th April, with the\r\nbills of fare, accounts of expenses, &c., which gives some notion of the\r\nsplendour and extent of Burghley’s household. There were consumed two\r\nstags, 40s.; two bucks, 20s.; six kids, 24s.; six pigs, 10s.; six shins\r\nof beef, 24s.; four gammons of bacon, 16s.; one swan, 10s.; three cranes,\r\n20s.; twenty-four curlews, 24s.; fifteen pheasants, 30s.; fifty-four\r\nherons, £8, 15s.; eight partridges, 8s., and vast quantities of meat\r\nof all sorts; and sturgeon, conger, salmon, trout, lampreys, lobsters,\r\nprawns, gurnards, oysters, and many sorts of fresh-water fish. Herbs\r\nand salads cost no less than 36s., and cream, 27s. There were consumed\r\n3300 eggs, 360 lbs. of butter, 42 lbs. of spices, and three gallons of\r\nrose-water. £11, 7s. 3d. was paid for the hire of extra vessels and\r\nglass; flowers and rushes cost £5, 7s. 10d., and Turkey carpets, £11.\r\nThis Gargantuan feast was served by forty-nine gentlemen and thirty-four\r\nservants, and was washed down with £75 worth of beer as well as Gascon,\r\nsack, hippocras, and other wine costing £21; the entire expenditure on\r\nthe afternoon’s feeding being £649, 1s. 5d.\r\n\r\nThough Burghley and Sussex had brought over the embassy in hopes of a\r\nmarriage, or at least an alliance, the Queen changed from hour to hour.\r\nWhen Leicester complained to her, she silenced him by saying that she\r\ncould avoid a marriage whenever she liked by bringing Alençon over\r\nwhilst the embassy was in England, and then setting the Frenchmen at\r\nloggerheads, and by subsidising the Prince’s attempts in Flanders. At the\r\nsame time she certainly led Sussex, and probably Burghley, to believe\r\nthat she might be in earnest at last.\r\n\r\nAfter some weeks the elder Ambassadors got tired of trifling, and begged\r\nthe Queen to appoint a committee of the Council to negotiate with them.\r\nThe great banquet at Burghley House was the preliminary meeting, and a\r\npaper at Hatfield, endorsed by Burghley, lays down, in the usual precise\r\nmanner of the time, every aspect of the matter. The propositions are\r\nthree: 1st, if the Queen should remain unmarried; 2nd, if she should\r\nmarry Alençon; and 3rd, if she should enter into some strait league with\r\nthe French. In the first eventuality the Queen must strengthen herself\r\nand weaken her opponents; Scotland must be reduced to the same friendship\r\nthat existed before the advent of D’Aubigny; James’s marriage to a\r\nCatholic must be prevented; Mary Stuart must be held tightly; Ireland\r\nmust be subdued; the entire domination of Spain over the Netherlands\r\nmust be avoided, and an alliance concluded either with France or the\r\nGerman Protestants. In the second eventuality, that the Queen should\r\nmarry Alençon, the writer urges that the wedding should take place\r\nwithout delay, but always on condition that religion in England must be\r\nsafeguarded, and Henry III. pledged to provide most of the means for\r\nAlençon’s enterprise in Flanders. On the other hand, if the marriage is\r\nnot to take place, care must be taken that no offence is given to the\r\nsuitor. “Since the treaty with Simier many accidents have happened to\r\nmake this marriage hateful to the people, as the invasion of Ireland by\r\nthe Pope, the determination of the Pope to stir up rebellion in this\r\nrealm by sending in a number of English Jesuits, who have by books,\r\nchallenges, and secret instructions and seductions, procured a great\r\ndefection of many people to relinquish their obedience to her Majesty.\r\nLikewise there is a manifest practice in Scotland, by D’Aubigny, to\r\nalienate the young King of Scotland, both from favouring the Protestant\r\nreligion and from amity to her Majesty and her realm, notwithstanding\r\nthat he hath only been conserved in his crown at her Majesty’s\r\ncharges.”[449]\r\n\r\nAlthough this paper has usually been treated as emanating from Burghley,\r\nI consider it much more likely to have been the work of Walsingham. There\r\nis at Hatfield, of similar date (2nd May 1581), a note, all in the Lord\r\nTreasurer’s hand, for his speech to the Ambassadors, and this is preceded\r\nby a private remark that, before a definite answer can be given, “it is\r\nnecessary to know her Majesty’s own mind, to what end she will have this\r\ntreaty tend, either to a marriage or no marriage, amity or no amity.”\r\nAs Burghley seems not to have possessed this information, it is not\r\nsurprising that the draft of his speech simply tends to delay. The Queen\r\nhas written to Alençon, he says, and must have a reply before she can say\r\nanything definite about the marriage; but as there has been some talk on\r\nboth sides of a close alliance, the Queen expects the Ambassadors to be\r\nempowered to deal with that also.[450]\r\n\r\nThe Ambassadors themselves give an account of a speech of Burghley’s,\r\neither on this or another occasion, in which he declared that, although\r\nhe was formerly against the marriage, he now personally thought it\r\ndesirable. Brisson replied in a similar strain, and then the strong\r\nProtestantism of Walsingham asserted itself. He said that the hope of the\r\nmarriage had caused the Pope to flood England with Jesuits and invade\r\nIreland, the Catholics in England were already in high feather about it,\r\nand Alençon had broken faith, and had entered into negotiations with the\r\nStates General, since Simier took the draft treaty. Besides, he said,\r\nlook at the danger of child-bearing to the Queen at her age. The marriage\r\nwould probably drag England into war at least, and until the Queen\r\nreceived a reply to her letters the negotiations for the marriage must\r\nstand over.[451]\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that the Queen desired an alliance without a\r\nmarriage, and to draw France into open hostility to Spain, whilst she\r\nremained unpledged. But Secretary Pinart was almost as clever as\r\nBurghley, and played his cards well, and no progress was made. Let\r\nthem marry first, said Pinart, it would be easy to make an alliance\r\nafterwards. Affairs were thus at a deadlock. Alençon was on the frontier\r\nwith a body of men ready to enter Flanders to relieve Cambray, when his\r\nbrother’s forces dispersed them. It was then clear to the Prince that he\r\nmust depend upon the Queen of England alone; and ceding to the pressure\r\nof his agent in England, he suddenly rushed over to London (2nd June), to\r\nthe confusion of the Ambassadors, who shut themselves up to avoid meeting\r\nhim. The Queen was all smiles, for she was satisfied now that Alençon was\r\nobliged to look to her only for aid, marriage or no marriage. Alençon\r\nwent back after a few days as secretly as he had come, but every one\r\nsaw that the Queen had won the trick; and the pompous embassy went back\r\nloaded with presents, but only taking with it a draft marriage treaty,\r\naccompanied by a letter from Elizabeth, saying that she might alter her\r\nmind if she liked, in which case the treaty was to be considered as\r\nannulled.[452]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Mendoza was watching closely the attempts of Leicester\r\nto persuade the Queen to aid Don Antonio in Portugal, as well as to\r\nprovide means for Alençon in Flanders. Walsingham had laid a trap for\r\nMendoza, who was induced to pay a large sum of money to some Hollanders\r\nwho promised to betray Flushing to the Spaniards, but really did just the\r\nopposite. The Hollanders left with the Spanish Ambassador the child son\r\nof one of them as a hostage. By orders of Walsingham the embassy was\r\nviolated and the boy taken away; and this amongst many other grievances\r\nwas the source of endless squabbling with the Queen, who invariably\r\nretorted to all Mendoza’s complaints that Philip had connived at the\r\ninvasion of Ireland. After one of his interviews with the Queen (24th\r\nJune) he writes: “It is impossible for me to express the insincerity with\r\nwhich she and her ministers proceed.… She contradicts me every moment in\r\nmy version of the negotiations.… I understood from her and Cecil, who is\r\none of the few ministers who show any signs of straightforwardness, that\r\nthey understood that your Majesty intended to write to the Queen assuring\r\nher that the succour had not been sent to Ireland on your behalf. I told\r\nthem that the matter referred to the Pope alone, but Cecil said they\r\nwished to see a letter from your Majesty;” whereupon Mendoza angrily told\r\nhim that the word of an Ambassador was sufficient.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that this conversation took place, Burghley’s task of\r\nkeeping the peace was rendered still more difficult by the arrival in\r\nEngland of the fugitive Portuguese Pretender, Don Antonio, who was at\r\nonce taken up by Leicester and Hatton. The Spanish Ambassador was told\r\nby Hatton that if he wanted his passports he could have them, and the\r\nQueen almost insultingly refused him audience. Mendoza then wrote her a\r\nletter, which he thought the Queen would be obliged to show to the whole\r\nCouncil, “where I was sure some of the members would point out to her\r\nthe danger she was running in refusing to receive me and thus irritating\r\nyour Majesty. Cecil, particularly, who is the person upon whom the\r\nQueen depends in matters of importance, had seen me a few days before,\r\nand said how sorry he was that these things should occur, and that he\r\nshould be unable to remedy them, as he was sure I could not avoid being\r\noffended.”[453]\r\n\r\nA few weeks afterwards Mendoza made another attempt to see the Queen,\r\nwho was then in the country. She said that as Philip had not written\r\nany excuse about the Spanish expedition to Ireland, she did not see her\r\nway to receive the Ambassador. If he had anything to say he might tell\r\nit to two Councillors. Burghley was known to be the most favourable of\r\nthem, and had expressed to Mendoza his ignorance that the audience had\r\nbeen refused. “He did not think it wise to refuse me; and as he is the\r\nmost important of the ministers I thought best to inform him of the\r\nreply I had received, and to say I should like to see him.” Burghley\r\nwas ill of gout at Theobalds at the time, but shortly afterwards he\r\ncame to town and asked Mendoza to see him at Leicester House, “his gout\r\npreventing him from coming further.” Mendoza found him with Leicester\r\ntogether, and in reply to the stereotyped complaints of the Ambassador\r\nabout Drake’s plunder, the aid to the Portuguese, and the refusal of\r\naudience, the Treasurer firmly told him that the Queen thought he had\r\nbeen remiss in not obtaining a letter from the King disclaiming the Irish\r\nexpedition. This Mendoza haughtily refused to do, and the conference\r\nended unsatisfactorily.[454]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that at this period (August 1581) Burghley was in despair\r\nof keeping on friendly relations with Spain. The Queen and Leicester\r\nhad determined to subsidise Alençon in Flanders, and to countenance\r\nDon Antonio’s attempts on Portugal. This coming after the retention\r\nof Drake’s plunder, and refusal of audience to the Ambassador, seemed\r\nto make the continuance of peace between the two countries impossible,\r\nand Burghley was once more obliged to turn to the necessary, but to him\r\ndistasteful, alternative—a close union with France.\r\n\r\nThe great French embassy had gone back defeated, for they saw that\r\nElizabeth was befooling Alençon, and that the national alliance would\r\nonly be made on terms advantageous to English interests in Flanders.\r\nBut it was necessary for Henry III. and his mother to cling to England\r\nif they were effectually to oppose Philip in Portugal. The Guises were\r\nbecoming more overbearing and powerful than ever under the popular Duke\r\nHenry; they were known to be turning towards Spain, and their ambitions\r\nwere high both for themselves and for their cousin Mary Stuart. To avoid\r\nthe complete subjugation of France to their ends, the King was therefore\r\nobliged to court Elizabeth, and suffer her to have her way with Alençon\r\nand Flanders. Henry III. consequently asked Elizabeth, through Somers,\r\nto name a day for the marriage, simultaneously with which an offensive\r\nand defensive alliance would be concluded, and a secret agreement entered\r\ninto with regard to the establishment of Alençon in Flanders. This, of\r\ncourse, was understood to be merely fencing, and Walsingham himself was\r\nsent to France to conclude a treaty. He was instructed to say that the\r\nFrench were mistaken in supposing that the marriage was settled. The\r\nQueen could not consent to the marriage now, for, as Alençon was already\r\nin arms against the King of Spain, it would “bring us and our realme into\r\nwar, which in no respect our realme and subjects can accept.” But if the\r\nKing will accept her secret aid to Alençon’s plan in Flanders, and the\r\nopposition to Spain in Portugal, she will be willing to conclude an\r\noffensive and defensive alliance with him. In any case, the marriage was\r\nto be abandoned. Walsingham saw Alençon in Picardy before going to Paris,\r\nand, as may be supposed, the young Prince was in despair at the Queen’s\r\nfickleness. He was certain his brother would not make an alliance without\r\nthe marriage, as he feared the Queen would slip out of it, leaving\r\nFrance alone face to face with Spain.[455] If, said Catharine, who was\r\nwith her son, the Queen of England broke her word about the marriage for\r\nfear of her people, she might break an alliance for a similar reason.\r\nBut Walsingham made it clear to both of them that Elizabeth would not\r\nallow herself to be dragged into war with Spain, though covert aid\r\nshould be given to her late suitor. Poor Alençon wept and stormed, but\r\nin vain. Anything short of marriage was useless to him, he said. His\r\nbrother neither had helped nor would help him against Spain, unless the\r\nmarriage took place. He himself would come to England for an answer\r\nfrom the Queen’s lips as soon as he had raised the siege of Cambray.\r\nElizabeth complained of Walsingham’s management of the interview; he\r\ncould rarely content her. He had, she said, been too abrupt in breaking\r\noff the marriage. Burghley pointed out to her that she could not have all\r\nher own way. She wanted, he said, to keep the marriage afoot, and yet\r\nnot to marry; to aid Alençon secretly, whilst France aided him openly;\r\nto conclude an alliance by which she gained everything, and France\r\nnothing.[456]\r\n\r\nElizabeth, in a rage, swore that Leicester and the Puritans were dragging\r\nher into all sorts of expense and trouble,[457] from which she could not\r\nextricate herself without war. Walsingham was soon disgusted with his\r\ntask, for he could make but little progress in Paris, and the Queen found\r\nfault with him constantly. He answered boldly, almost rudely, to all her\r\nstrictures. He told her that with all this hesitation about the marriage\r\n“you lose the benefit of time, which, if years be considered, is not the\r\nleast thing to be weighed. If you mean it (the marriage) not, then assure\r\nyourself it is one of the worst remedies you can use.… When your Majesty\r\ndoth see in what doubtful terms you stand with foreign princes, then you\r\ndo wish with great affection that opportunities offered had not been\r\noverslipped; but when they are offered you, if they be accompanied by\r\ncharges, they are altogether neglected. The respect of charges hath lost\r\nScotland, and I would to God I had no cause to think it might not put\r\nyour Highness into peril of losing England.”[458]\r\n\r\nEven Burghley, with all his influence, was in despair at getting the\r\nQueen to spend any money. Walsingham had told the Queen that if she lent\r\nAlençon 100,000 ducats secretly he might be appeased. Burghley pointed\r\nout to her that her niggardliness was ruining the chance of effectually\r\nweakening Spain. “In no wise,” writes Burghley, “would she have the\r\nenterprise of the Low Countries lost, but she will not particularly\r\nwarrant you to offer aid. She allegeth that now the King (of France)\r\nhath gone so far he will not abandon it.… Her Majesty is also very\r\ncold in the cause of Don Antonio, alleging that she liketh it only by\r\nopportunity [importunity?] of her Council; and now that all things are\r\nready, ships, victuals, and men, the charges whereof come to £12,000, she\r\nhath been moved to find £2000 more needful for the full furniture of the\r\nvoyage, wherewith she is greatly offended with Mr. Hawkins and Drake,\r\nas the charges are greater than was said to her … hereupon her Majesty\r\nis content not to give a penny more; and now after Drake and Hawkins\r\nhave made shift for the £2000, she will not let them depart until she be\r\nassured by you that the French will aid Don Antonio, for she feareth to\r\nbe left alone.… All these things do marvellously stay her Majesty … yet\r\nshe loseth all the charges spent in vain, and the poor King (Antonio) is\r\nutterly lost.”[459]\r\n\r\nBut Burghley might reason and remonstrate, Walsingham might tell her, as\r\nhe did, that the penuriousness would bring her to ruin, Elizabeth would\r\nnot open her purse strings until it was almost too late. Alençon had made\r\na dash into Flanders soon after seeing Walsingham in August, and relieved\r\nCambray, and then being absolutely penniless, his brother, in a fright at\r\nhis boldness, refusing any aid, the Queen was obliged to send him £20,000\r\nto prevent the abandonment of the whole business, and a union with the\r\nGuises which he threatened. He returned to France after a few weeks, and\r\nthen again announced his intention of coming to England to exert his\r\npersonal influence on the Queen. To stave off the visit several other\r\nsums of money were sent to him. Leicester, too, strove his hardest to\r\nstop it; but Alençon’s agents and Alençon’s lovelorn epistles were more\r\nflattering to the Queen even than Leicester, and the lover came early in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nAlthough Walsingham had almost arranged a draft treaty of alliance\r\nwithout marriage when he was in Paris, it fell through on the eternal\r\nquestion of the Queen’s “charges” and responsibility, and when Alençon\r\narrived in England the whole matter was as far from settlement as\r\never. Of the extraordinary cajolery by which the Queen alternately\r\nraised Alençon to the pinnacle of hope and plunged him to the depths\r\nof despair during his stay with her at Richmond and Whitehall, a full\r\ndescription will be found elsewhere.[460] By her dexterity she bound\r\nhim personally to her, and made it appear that the only obstacles to\r\nthe match were those raised by the King of France. From the coming of\r\nAlençon it is clear that Leicester alone understood the Queen’s game.\r\nThe earl was radiant and joyous, which made Sussex distrust the result,\r\nnotwithstanding appearances. So far as he could Lord Burghley held aloof,\r\nalthough when the Prince came to London he waited upon him with other\r\nCouncillors formally every morning at nine. When the famous scene was\r\nenacted (22nd November) in the gallery at Whitehall, where the Queen\r\nboldly kissed her suitor on the lips and publicly pledged herself to\r\nmarry him,[461] Burghley was confined to his bed with an attack of gout.\r\nThe Queen sent him an account of what had passed. Mendoza reports that he\r\nthereupon exclaimed, “Blessed be the Lord that this business has at last\r\nreached a point where the Queen, on her part, has done all she can; it is\r\nfor the country now alone to carry it out.” The deduction which Mendoza\r\ndrew from this exclamation was probably the correct one. To him it proved\r\nthat the whole plan was insincere on the part of Elizabeth, and that the\r\nintention was to cause conditions to be imposed by Parliament which the\r\nKing of France could not accept, and then to throw the responsibility of\r\nthe breach upon the latter.\r\n\r\nThis was all very well, but it was a reverse for Burghley’s policy.\r\nLeicester and Walsingham had drawn the Queen into a position of almost\r\nopen hostility to Spain; and yet a close union with France was rendered\r\ndifficult by Elizabeth’s fickleness and dread of responsibility, and by\r\nLeicester’s jealousy. As usual in such circumstances, Burghley cautiously\r\nendeavoured to redress the balance. When the treaty with France seemed\r\nassured, Mendoza had been refused audience, and on remonstrating with\r\nBurghley he had found him far less willing to be friendly than before.\r\nLeicester quite openly talked about turning the Spanish Ambassador out of\r\nEngland, and even Burghley had replied, to an application for audience\r\non behalf of Mendoza to deliver a letter from Philip to the Queen, who\r\nwas at Nonsuch, that the Queen was alone and unattended by Councillors,\r\n“and as Don Bernardino is to bring letters to the Queen from so great an\r\nenemy to her as his master, it is meet that he should be received as the\r\nminister of such a one.” When the Spaniard did see the Queen (October),\r\nhis threats and complaints about Don Antonio and Alençon were met with\r\nanger and indignation by her. All the old complaints on both sides were\r\nrepeated, and both then and later Mendoza was certain by the attitude of\r\nLeicester, Hatton, and Walsingham, that they were determined to have war\r\nwith Spain, and that Burghley, for once, would not stand in their way.\r\n\r\nBut a change came in the attitude of the latter in December. It seemed\r\nthen impossible for the Queen to withdraw her pledges to Alençon without\r\na breach with France, whilst she could hardly help him without a war\r\nwith Spain. Scottish affairs, moreover, were a subject of deep anxiety.\r\nD’Aubigny was now master, and Morton, to Elizabeth’s indignation, had\r\nbeen executed. Catholic priests and Jesuits were known to be flitting\r\nbackwards and forwards; and worst of all, Mary Stuart had, for the\r\nfirst time since her flight, opened up friendly negotiations with her\r\nson’s Government, and had formally joined James with herself in her\r\nsovereignty. She had moreover written confidently asking for many fresh\r\nconcessions which Elizabeth was loath to grant her.[462]\r\n\r\nAny appearance of an approach of the French and Scots always drew England\r\nand Spain together, and with the added dangers already cited, this was\r\nquite sufficient to change Lord Burghley’s tone. Mendoza accordingly\r\nreports (25th December 1581) that, at a meeting of the Council held to\r\nconsider the situation, Burghley suggested that an alliance should be\r\nmade with Spain, and an agreement arrived at with regard to the Low\r\nCountries. This was approved of by the Lord Chancellor (Bromley), the\r\nLord Admiral (Lincoln), and Crofts. Sussex held aloof, wavering between\r\nhis enmity to France and Leicester, and his attachment to Protestantism;\r\nwhilst Leicester, Walsingham, Hatton, and Knollys were strenuously\r\nopposed to any approach to Spain, as they were, even more violently, to\r\nBurghley’s proposal that Drake’s plunder, or what was left of it, should\r\nbe restored. A few days afterwards Burghley had some business with a\r\nSpanish merchant established in London, and to him he expressed a desire\r\nthat negotiations should be opened for an agreement between the two\r\ncountries. When the merchant carried the message to Mendoza, the latter\r\nattributed the suggestion entirely to the fear which he had aroused by\r\nhis firmness, and he made no response. Mendoza himself, indeed, one of\r\nthe warlike Alba school, had now no hope or desire for peace. The rise of\r\nD’Aubigny in Scotland and the coming of the Jesuits had quite altered the\r\nposition during the last year, and Mendoza had in his hands a plot that\r\nseemed to promise the triumph of the Catholics.\r\n\r\nAs early as April 1581, Mary Stuart had renewed her approaches to Spain\r\nthrough the Archbishop of Glasgow in Paris. “Things were now,” she\r\nsaid, “better disposed than ever in Scotland for a return to its former\r\ncondition … and English affairs could be dealt with subsequently. The\r\nKing, her son, was quite determined to return to the Catholic religion,\r\nand much inclined to an open rupture with the Queen of England.” She\r\nbegged for armed aid from Philip, to be landed first in Ireland, and to\r\nenter Scotland at a given signal after the alliance between Scotland\r\nand Spain had been signed. Nothing came of this at the time; and after\r\nseveral other attempts on the part of Mary to get into touch with the\r\nSpaniards, she became distrustful of her Ambassador (Archbishop Beton)\r\nand other intermediaries, and contrived in November to communicate with\r\nMendoza direct. She had heard that all the priests who flocked into\r\nScotland and England looked to him for guidance, and that through them\r\nhe had sent a message to the Scottish Catholics, saying that everything\r\nnow depended upon Scotland’s reverting to the old faith. The English\r\nCatholic nobles then at liberty had, at Mendoza’s instance, formed a\r\nsociety with this object, and secretly sent two priests to sound James\r\nand D’Aubigny, and to promise that they would raise the north of England,\r\nrelease Mary, and secure the English succession to James. They brought\r\nback a favourable reply, which the ambassador at once conveyed to Allen\r\nand Persons on the continent. This was late in the autumn of 1581, and\r\nMendoza looked coldly upon Burghley’s new advances, for he was now the\r\ncentre of the plot to overthrow Elizabeth by means of the Scottish\r\nCatholics, a plot in which, against his will, he was obliged to make\r\nuse of the Jesuit missionaries, who themselves at first had no idea of\r\nthe Spanish political aims that underlay the conversion of Scotland to\r\nCatholicism.\r\n\r\nSide by side with the Jesuits, Creighton, Persons, and Holt, who were\r\nemployed in the political movement, were others who had been sent to\r\nEngland and were intended purely for spiritual work. They had been\r\nextremely successful in their propaganda, and had once more infused\r\nspirit into the English Catholic party. This could not be done without\r\nthe printing and dissemination of books, as well as preaching, and the\r\nspies of the Council were directed to track to earth the priests who were\r\nat the bottom of the movement. Nearly every writer upon the subject has\r\ntaken for granted that Lord Burghley was at the bottom of the persecution\r\nwhich followed. Such, however, does not appear to have been the case. As\r\nwe have seen, the Lord Treasurer insisted upon some uniformity in the\r\npractice of the Anglican Church, but he must have known that many of his\r\nclosest friends, and the colleagues upon whom he depended in the Council,\r\nwere Catholics, and his lifelong tendency was to a political union\r\nwith Spain, the champion of Catholic Christendom. He was determined,\r\nit is true, to crush treason to the Queen and the institutions of the\r\ncountry, no matter who suffered; and when Catholicism meant revolution he\r\nharried it fiercely; but he was no persecutor for the sake of religion\r\nitself,[463] and the cruel torture and execution of Campion, Sherwin,\r\nand Briant,[464] during Alençon’s visit to England (1st December 1581),\r\nfor denying the Queen’s supremacy, were almost certainly prompted in the\r\nmain by Walsingham, Knollys, and the Puritans, who were in a fever of\r\napprehension lest the marriage with Alençon would lead to toleration of\r\nthe Catholic faith. The men actually executed were not in fact employed\r\nin the political portion of the propaganda at all, but were honest\r\nreligious missionaries; but they, and the scores of other Catholics\r\nwho were swept into prison at the time, were useful object lessons for\r\nWalsingham and Leicester, whose aims, as we have seen, were in direct\r\nopposition to those of Burghley.[465] The latter, indeed, was at the\r\nvery time of the execution approaching Mendoza with suggestions for an\r\nalliance with Spain, which were coldly received for the reasons already\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nDuring Alençon’s stay in England, the Queen, who was playing her own\r\ngame, which was to reduce the Prince to utter dependence upon her and to\r\ndistrust of his brother, had been constantly thwarted by the jealousy\r\nof Leicester and Hatton. They were for granting enormous sums to the\r\nsuitor to get rid of him at any cost, which was no part of the Queen’s\r\nplan. Lord Burghley alone of the Councillors never displeased her in the\r\nmatter; whenever it was a question of large expenditure, he always had\r\na convenient attack of gout, and thus never openly thwarted the Queen.\r\nThe difficulty was to get Alençon out of the country without ruinous\r\nexpense or further pledges, and when it was found that all the Queen’s\r\npersuasions were unavailing she had to employ Burghley’s diplomacy.\r\nHe began by inflaming the young Prince’s ambition, and enlarging upon\r\nthe splendid destiny awaiting him in his new sovereignty, which was\r\nnow clamouring for his presence. Promises were made never meant to be\r\nliterally fulfilled, of the vast sums the Queen would contribute to his\r\nsupport, and at last, after infinite trouble, he was induced to promise\r\nto sail for Flanders. He wished to stay until the new year; but when\r\nBurghley pointed out to him the large amount of money he would have to\r\nspend in presents he seemed to give way, for money he had none. But when\r\nthe time came he still stayed on. The Queen told Burghley after supper\r\non Christmas night that she would not marry the lad to be empress of the\r\nworld, and that he must get rid of him somehow. Catharine de Medici,\r\nthe Prince of Orange, the German princes, and the French Ambassador all\r\nadded their pressure to that of the Queen and Burghley to get Alençon\r\nout of England. Leicester and Hatton fumed and threatened. Burghley at\r\nlast frankly told the Queen that the only way to get rid of her suitor\r\nwas to provide a sum of ready money for him, and promise that he should\r\ncome back to England as soon as he was crowned. The Queen did not like\r\nthe alternative, and said she must wait for the King of France’s answer\r\nto her last demands. This time Catharine de Medici beat her with her own\r\nweapons. The answer was a full acceptance of everything required by the\r\nEnglish; and to make it more complete, Alençon said he was willing to\r\nbecome a Protestant.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed alarming, and the Queen sent hurriedly to Burghley to\r\nget her out of the scrape. His suggestion this time was that she should\r\ndemand Calais and Havre as security for the fulfilment of the King’s\r\npromises, which was a device after her own heart. But still Alençon\r\nwould not go, and the Queen became seriously alarmed. She promised him\r\n£60,000; but Burghley was opposed to any such sum as that being paid, or\r\nindeed more than was necessary for the Prince’s voyage. The Queen said\r\nthat she did not mean to pay it, but only to promise it, which was quite\r\nanother matter. It is evident that Burghley was now quite undeceived,\r\nand against both the pretence of marriage and any large support being\r\ngiven to Alençon. He dreaded the revenge of France for the insult put\r\nupon it; and of Spain, for aiding the Frenchman’s usurpation of Philip’s\r\nsovereignty under English protection. His remedy, as usual, was a\r\nfriendship with Spain. Walsingham, on the other hand, was all in favour\r\nof vigorous help to Orange and a war with Spain. The Queen usually leant\r\nto the side of Burghley, but was swayed hither and thither by her fears\r\nof France, by Pinart’s threats, Alençon’s tears, Leicester’s jealousy,\r\nand her own greed and vanity.\r\n\r\nAt last after infinite trouble Alençon sailed with fifteen ships,\r\nattended by Leicester (sorely against his will), Hunsdon, Sidney,\r\nWilloughby, Howard, and Norris, to take upon himself the sovereignty of\r\nHolland and Flanders. The Queen after all had to provide a large sum\r\nof money, but it was sent to the States, and not entrusted to Alençon,\r\nexcept a personal present of £25,000 from the Queen. Leicester escaped\r\nfrom the new sovereign’s side on the very day he was crowned, and hurried\r\nback to his mistress’s side. He reported that Alençon and the French were\r\nhated by the Protestant Dutchmen, who had only admitted him because the\r\nQueen of England was behind him. The English Ambassador in Paris at the\r\nsame time sent word that Henry III. had repudiated his brother’s action,\r\nand had denounced as traitors all those who aided him.\r\n\r\nThis was exactly what Elizabeth feared. She had offended both the great\r\npowers, and was alone. She swore at Leicester for sanctioning, by his\r\npresence, the investiture of Alençon; she railed at Walsingham as a knave\r\nfor dragging her into such a business; and she insisted upon Burghley,\r\nwho was ill with fever in London, getting up and coming to Windsor to\r\ntell her what to do. When he appeared, she asked him whether it would\r\nnot be better for her at once to become friendly with Spain. Thus, though\r\nthe sagacious Lord Treasurer had let her go her own way, she had at last\r\nbeen brought by circumstances to propose his policy again. “He replied\r\nthat nothing would suit her better, especially if peace could be arranged\r\nin the Netherlands by the concession of liberty of conscience.”[466]\r\nSussex was of the same opinion, but distrusted both the Queen and\r\nBurghley, who, he said, had spoken coolly on the subject on the Council.\r\nThere is, however, no reason to doubt that the Treasurer was sincere in\r\nhis desire for such an arrangement, which indeed was the only one which\r\nseemed to promise peace to England.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Spanish and Jesuit plot in Scotland was progressing.\r\nGuise had drifted further and further away from Henry III. and his\r\nmother, from whom he saw he could get no aid for Mary Stuart or his\r\nown ambitious plans. When, therefore, the Queen of Scots had offered\r\nher submission and the sending of her son to Spain, he had separated\r\nhimself from French interests, and tendered his own humble services\r\nto Philip. This made all the difference. If the Holy League and this\r\nundertaking made the Guises Catholics and Spaniards before they were\r\nFrenchmen, Philip need have no hesitation in helping their niece to the\r\ncrowns of Scotland and England; and the Jesuits were set to work to\r\nsecure James and D’Aubigny, whilst Mary Stuart’s spirits rose high. The\r\nScottish Catholic nobles were ready to rise, and even, if necessary, to\r\nkill or deport the King if he would not be a Catholic. All they asked\r\nwas a force of two thousand foreign troops. D’Aubigny entered eagerly\r\ninto the affair, and by the spring of 1582 all was arranged, when the\r\nJesuit emissaries and D’Aubigny between them mismanaged it. Guise was\r\nfoolishly brought into the plan by D’Aubigny, and he wanted to invade\r\nthe south of England with his troops at the same time. D’Aubigny made\r\nexaggerated claims for himself, and the Scottish Catholic nobles followed\r\nsuit. Philip recognised that Guise was still playing for his own hand,\r\nthough not for France. If Mary was to be Queen of Great Britain and his\r\nhumble servant, she must owe her crown to him, and not to Guise. Philip\r\ntherefore grew cool, and the raid of Ruthven and the banishment of\r\nD’Aubigny, by which young James fell into the hands of the Protestants\r\n(August 1582), effectually put an end to the projects of invasion for a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th March 1582, Alençon in Antwerp was giving an entertainment\r\non the occasion of his birthday, when the Prince of Orange was stabbed,\r\nit was thought mortally, by a young Spaniard hired by those greater than\r\nhimself. The one cry, both in Holland and in England, was, that Alençon\r\nand his false Frenchmen were at the bottom of the crime, and, but for the\r\nfortitude of Orange, every Frenchman in the Netherlands would have been\r\nmassacred. Elizabeth was beside herself with fear. Her first impulse was\r\nto get Alençon out of Flanders, even if she brought him to England; but\r\nWalsingham gravely warned her that if the Prince came again she would\r\ncertainly have to marry him.\r\n\r\nWhilst Orange lay between life and death, Leicester, Hatton, Knollys,\r\nand Walsingham were for ever urging the Queen boldly to take Flanders\r\nand Holland under her own protection, whilst Burghley, aided by Sussex\r\nand Crofts, again advocated an arrangement with Spain. But the latter\r\nwere in a minority; the Protestant feeling of the country was thoroughly\r\naroused at the attempted murder of Orange, and Burghley was obliged to\r\nbe cautious. Mendoza was instructed by Philip, March 1582, to use his\r\ninfluence with the Council to prevent aid being given to Alençon. “I\r\nhave,” writes Mendoza, “tried every artifice to get on good terms with\r\nsome of them, but they all turn their faces against me, particularly\r\nthe Lord Treasurer, whom I formerly used to see, the rest of them being\r\nopenly inimical. Only lately I sought an opportunity of approaching him\r\nagain, and asked him to see me. He replied that his colleagues looked\r\nupon him as being very Spanish in his sympathies, and therefore he could\r\nnot venture to see me alone, except by the Queen’s orders. I had, he\r\nsaid, better communicate my business through Secretary Walsingham, in the\r\nordinary course.”[467]\r\n\r\nWalsingham, on the other hand, lost no opportunity of widening the\r\nbreach, in order to force the Queen to more vigorous action in favour of\r\nthe Dutch Protestants. In May he sent an insulting message to Mendoza, to\r\nthe effect that the Queen would not receive him until some satisfaction\r\nwas given about Ireland. The Ambassador at once complained to Burghley.\r\nWar, he said, might well result from this treatment of him. Burghley\r\nendeavoured to minimise the slight. It was a mistake of the messenger,\r\nhe said, and Mendoza had better write to the Queen. He did so, but with\r\nno result but to confirm Walsingham’s message, though Elizabeth softened\r\nit somewhat by saying, “God forbid that she should ever break with your\r\nMajesty, to whom she bore nothing but good-will.”[468] When, in July,\r\nAlençon demanded more money, Walsingham, Leicester, and Hatton were for\r\nsending him £50,000 at once—anything to prevent his coming to England\r\nagain—but Cecil opposed it vigorously. There was but £80,000 in the\r\nTreasury, he said, and so only £30,000 was sent to Flanders.\r\n\r\nBy the death of Bacon, the fatal illness of Sussex, and the defection\r\nof Hatton, Lord Burghley was at this time almost alone in the Council;\r\nfor Crofts, the Controller, a regular pensioner of Spain and a Catholic,\r\nwas a man of no influence; and, according to Mendoza, the Lord Treasurer\r\nin November told the Queen plainly that she must appoint two more\r\nCouncillors of his way of thinking, “to oppose Leicester and his gang.”\r\nIt was probably in pursuance of this policy that Burghley cast about for\r\nsome counterbalancing influence to be used against Leicester.\r\n\r\nAt the end of 1581 a young captain named Walter Ralegh, whose company in\r\nIreland had been disbanded on the suppression of the Desmond rebellion,\r\nhad been sent over to England with despatches. He was clever and\r\nbrilliant, and full of schemes for governing Ireland more cheaply than\r\nthe Viceroy, Lord Grey, had done. Grey rebuked him for his presumption,\r\nand sent him home in semi-disgrace. Leicester was a bitter enemy of\r\nGrey’s, and was glad to welcome the young captain who impeached his\r\ngovernment, and that of Leicester’s rival Ormond.[469] Ralegh was\r\ninvited to the Council-table to explain his plans to Lord Burghley. His\r\nrecommendations were approved, and submitted to the Queen, who gave him\r\naudience. Before many weeks passed (May 1582), favours began to shower\r\nupon him; and by the autumn, Leicester and Hatton had taken fright, and\r\nwere bitterly jealous of him, whilst the Lord Treasurer had cleverly\r\nenlisted the new favourite under his banner. He was never a member of the\r\nCouncil, but he had the Queen’s ear, and kept it for years; for Leicester\r\nwas elderly and scorbutic, and Hatton was an affected fribble, whilst\r\nRalegh was young, handsome, and manly, and as wise as he was ambitious.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1582 the plague raged in London, and Burghley took\r\nrefuge at Theobalds, where, in November, his recently married young\r\nson-in-law, the eldest son of Lord Wentworth died. The letters written\r\non this occasion from Walsingham[470] and Hatton[471] prove that the\r\npolitical opposition in the Council did not degenerate into personal\r\nenmity; indeed, nothing is more remarkable than the affectionate regard,\r\nand even reverence, which are constantly expressed by Lord Burghley’s\r\ncorrespondents towards him. An especially kind thought seems to have\r\noccurred to Walsingham. He suggests to Hatton that “it would be some\r\ncomfort to his lady (_i.e._ Elizabeth Wentworth), if it might please you\r\nso to work with her Majesty, as his (Burghley’s) other son-in-law (Lord\r\nOxford), who hath long dwelt in her Majesty’s displeasure, might be\r\nrestored to her Highness’s good favour.”[472]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of Oxford had constantly been a source of trouble to Lord\r\nBurghley. He was extravagant, eccentric, and quarrelsome, and only by\r\nthe exercise of great forbearance on the part of his father-in-law had\r\nany semblance of friendship been kept up. If on this occasion, as is\r\nprobable, Hatton acceded to Walsingham’s suggestion, and persuaded the\r\nQueen once more to receive Oxford at court, it was not long before the\r\nintractable Earl again misbehaved himself; for on May of the following\r\nyear (1583) his long-suffering father-in-law appealed to the new\r\nfavourite, Ralegh, to exert his influence with the Queen to forgive him\r\nagain. Ralegh’s answer,[473] giving a long account of his efforts to move\r\nthe Queen, shows that Oxford had injured him also. “I am content,” he\r\nwrites, “for your sake to lay the serpent before the fire, as much as in\r\nme lieth, that having recovered strength, myself may be most in danger of\r\nhis poison and sting.”\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, Mary Stuart had never ceased, since the triumph of\r\nD’Aubigny, to negotiate through Mendoza for her release and restoration,\r\nand the subsequent invasion of England over the Scottish Border. The raid\r\nof Ruthven and the fall of D’Aubigny did not at first discourage her.\r\nShe still believed that the expected arrival of foreign troops, and her\r\nson’s secret favour of the Catholics, would enable the plot to be carried\r\nthrough,[474] and under this belief it was that she wrote her violent\r\nletter of denunciation and complaint to Elizabeth (8th November).[475]\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the receipt of this letter in London there\r\narrived the Guisan, La Mothe Fénélon, on his way to Scotland, for the\r\npurpose of inquiring into the treatment of D’Aubigny by the Protestant\r\nlords, uniting Mary and her son on the throne, and, if possible, to\r\nmediate with Elizabeth in favour of the captive Queen; whilst, at the\r\nsame time, another envoy (De Maineville) was sent by sea with secret\r\ninstructions to plan a fresh rising of the Catholic nobles in union\r\nwith James. Castelnau, the regular Ambassador, might protest untruly\r\nto Elizabeth, as he did, that it was “une chose du tout contraire à la\r\nverité de dire que le Sieur De Maineville eut une seconde et particulière\r\nsecrete instruction;” but the embassy was quite terrifying enough to\r\nElizabeth, coming after the plots that she knew had been hatching between\r\nthe Spaniards, the Jesuits, and D’Aubigny. Walsingham hurried from his\r\ncountry house to court the moment he heard of La Mothe Fénélon’s arrival,\r\nfor all the official French plans for helping James and D’Aubigny had\r\npurposely been allowed to leak out. We know now that they were merely\r\na trick of the Queen-mother’s to frighten Elizabeth into helping poor\r\nAlençon in the Netherlands, the only really serious part of them being\r\nDe Maineville’s secret mission, which depended entirely upon Guise.[476]\r\nThe Queen kept La Mothe dallying for weeks before she would give him a\r\npassport, whilst she tried to dazzle him anew with the talk of marrying\r\nAlençon and supporting him in Flanders. Before he left for Scotland,\r\nD’Aubigny had passed through London on his way to France, where he died\r\nshortly afterwards; and when La Mothe proceeded on his mission it was\r\nalready too late, if ever it was intended to be effectual.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the standing reproaches to Lord Burghley’s memory that he\r\nwas the constant enemy of Mary. In former chapters I have shown that\r\nthis was not the case. That he was inflexible in tracing and punishing\r\ntreason against his mistress and her Government is obvious, for it was\r\nhis first duty as a minister; but how far he was from any personal enmity\r\nagainst the unfortunate Mary, may be seen in his many letters to Lord\r\nShrewsbury at Hatfield and elsewhere. On the receipt of Mary’s imprudent\r\nletter to the Queen and the arrival of La Mothe in England, a Council was\r\ncalled to consider the removal of the Queen of Scots from the care of\r\nShrewsbury. Mendoza says that “the Treasurer was greatly opposed to her\r\nbeing removed from the Earl’s house, where she had remained for fifteen\r\nyears, especially as Shrewsbury had not failed fully to carry out his\r\ninstructions. He said her removal would scandalise the country.”[477]\r\n\r\nBurghley’s relative William Davison, in conjunction with Robert Bowes,\r\nwas sent to Scotland at the same the time as La Mothe, to dissuade\r\nJames from acceding to French suggestion of associating his mother with\r\nhimself in his sovereignty; and Walsingham’s brother-in-law, Beale, was\r\ndeputed to proceed to Sheffield for the purpose of negotiating with\r\nMary with regard to her future.[478] Mary from the first had seen that\r\nthe interference of Henry III. and his mother was a feint in favour of\r\nAlençon, and sent Fontenay to Mendoza whilst Beale was with her, to\r\nask for his guidance in the negotiation.[479] Elizabeth had secretly\r\nauthorised Beale, under certain circumstances, to offer Mary her release.\r\nThis, Mendoza understood, was unfavourable to Spanish ends, because she\r\nwould almost infallibly fall in such case into the hands of the French,\r\nor be compelled, if she stayed in England, to make such renunciations\r\nand compromises as would render her useless as an instrument with which\r\nto raise the Catholics. The Spaniard therefore naturally advised her to\r\nstay where she was, and the unhappy woman followed his interested advice.\r\nShe gave Beale a somewhat unyielding answer, and her last chance of\r\nliberation fled.[480]\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile Alençon continued to clamour for money, and repeated his\r\nvows of everlasting love and slavish submission; anything if Elizabeth\r\nwould only send money to save him from becoming the laughing-stock of\r\nEurope. The Protestant Dutchmen were tired of him; Orange saw that he\r\nwas a useless burden, and prayed Elizabeth to take her bad bargain back\r\nagain. Seeing that he could expect but little from England, he obtained\r\nthe help of his mother. Marshal Biron crossed the frontier into Flanders,\r\nand in January 1583 the false Valois endeavoured to seize and garrison\r\nwith Frenchmen the strong places of the Netherlands. The affair failed,\r\nand Alençon fled from Antwerp detested and distrusted. The States\r\ndisowned him, and Norris, the English general, refused to obey him; and\r\nthough Elizabeth pretended to be angry with Sir John Norris and the\r\nEnglishmen, she thought better of it when Alençon asked her to withdraw\r\nthem and let his Frenchmen deal with the Flemings, for it was now clear\r\nthat she could never trust him in Flanders alone.\r\n\r\nWith the invidious position into which Elizabeth’s tortuous policy had\r\nled her; almost hopeless as she was now of conciliating Spain, and\r\nconscious of having insulted France beyond forgiveness by her treatment\r\nof Alençon; with Orange discontented, and Scotland in a ferment, it is\r\nnot strange that division existed in the Queen’s counsels. Burghley\r\nhimself at this time was tired of the struggle. The fresh Councillors\r\nhad not been appointed, and he had to contend with infinite diplomacy\r\nfor every point that he carried. The general tendency of the Queen’s\r\npolicy was opposed to his view of what was wise; he was now old and\r\nalmost constantly ill, and either the Queen’s obduracy with regard to his\r\nunworthy son-in-law Oxford, or the opposition he constantly met with,\r\nled him to seek release from his offices, and to desire to pass the rest\r\nof his life in retirement. His complaint would rather seem to have been\r\nagainst the Queen herself, to judge from her very curious letter turning\r\nhis desire to ridicule. On the 8th May 1583 she wrote:—\r\n\r\n    “Sir Spirit,[481] I doubt I do nickname you, for those of your\r\n    kind, they say, have no sense. But I have of late seen an\r\n    ‘_Ecce Signum_,’ that if an ass kick you, you feel it so soon.\r\n    I will recant you from being a spirit if ever I perceive you\r\n    disdain not such a feeling. Serve God, fear the King, and be\r\n    a good fellow to the rest. Let never care appear in you for\r\n    such a rumour; but let them well know that you rather desire\r\n    the righting of such a wrong by making known their error, than\r\n    you be so silly a soul as to foreslow that you ought to do, or\r\n    not freely deliver what you think meetest, and pass of no man\r\n    so much, as not to regard her trust who putteth it in you. God\r\n    bless you, and long may you last _omnino_.\r\n\r\n                                                       “E. R.”[482]\r\n\r\nThe duplicity of the young King of Scots and the intrigues of the Guisan\r\nenvoy were successful in June in withdrawing James from the power of the\r\nlords of the English faction, and once more the Scottish Catholics held\r\nup their heads.[483] Thus encouraged, Mary at once informed Elizabeth\r\nthat the conditional promises she had made to Beale and Mildmay in the\r\nnegotiations for her release, were to be considered void unless she were\r\nat once liberated,[484] her attitude being no doubt to some extent the\r\nresult of the strenuous efforts of the Spaniards through Mendoza to keep\r\nher in England, and to prevent her from entering into any compromise as\r\nto religion.\r\n\r\nThis new phase of affairs profoundly disquieted Elizabeth.[485] Her\r\nAmbassador in France, Henry Cobham, continued to send alarming news of\r\nGuise’s designs,[486] and it is certain that Walsingham, at all events,\r\nwas aware of the constant communications between Mary and Mendoza. It\r\nwas therefore decided to send Walsingham himself to Edinburgh, to obtain\r\nfrom James some assurance that English interests should not suffer by\r\nhis change of ministers, and to offer him a subsidy in consideration\r\nof his acceptance of the terms proposed by Elizabeth. That the mission\r\nwas an unwelcome one to Walsingham, who foresaw its failure, is proved\r\nby Mendoza’s statement (19th August): “He strenuously refused to go,\r\nand went so far as to throw himself at the Queen’s feet, and pronounce\r\nthe following terrible blasphemy: he swore by the soul, body, and\r\nblood of God, that he would not go to Scotland, even if she ordered\r\nhim to be hanged for it, as he would rather be hanged in England than\r\nelsewhere.… Walsingham says that he saw that no good could come of the\r\nmission, and that the Queen would lay upon his shoulders the whole of\r\nthe responsibility for the evils that would occur. He said she was very\r\nstingy already, and the Scots more greedy than ever, quite disillusioned\r\nnow as to the promises made to them; so that it was impossible that any\r\ngood should be done.”[487] But Walsingham went nevertheless, and came\r\nhome safely, though, as he foretold, his embassy was fruitless, for the\r\nCatholics had entirely captured James.\r\n\r\nAlençon, in despair of obtaining sufficient help from Elizabeth, now\r\nthat he had shown his falseness, had retired to France, leaving his\r\nforces under Marshal Biron. Lovelorn epistles and frantic protestations\r\ncontinued to pass between him and Elizabeth; but it was acknowledged now\r\nthat his cause was hopeless, and he fell henceforward entirely under the\r\ninfluence of his mother. The States and Orange again and again urged\r\nElizabeth to take the provinces into her own hands and carry on the war\r\nopenly. Leicester, Walsingham, Bedford, Knollys, and the Puritans urged\r\nher seriously to do so; but she refused on the advice of Burghley, “who\r\ntold her that she had not sufficient strength to struggle with your\r\nMajesty, particularly with so small a contribution as that offered by the\r\nStates. Leicester and the rest of them are trying to persuade her to send\r\nfive or six thousand men thither.”[488]\r\n\r\nEvents were irresistibly nearing a crisis which made it necessary for\r\nElizabeth to take an open course on one side or the other; and Lord\r\nBurghley had again been overborne by the zealous Protestants in the\r\nCouncil until a breach with Spain had become unavoidable sooner or later.\r\nWalsingham had never lost touch of Mary Stuart’s proceedings,[489]\r\nor of her French cousin’s various plans for the murder of Elizabeth,\r\nand the invasion of England. Guise had submitted to Philip in 1583 a\r\nregular proposal for the Queen’s assassination, and in the autumn had\r\nsent his pensioner Charles Paget (Mopo) to England to negotiate for the\r\nrising of the English Catholics. One of the results of this was that\r\nyoung Francis Throgmorton, a correspondent of Mary Stuart, and one of\r\nher intermediaries with Mendoza, was arrested with others and charged\r\nwith a plot to assassinate the Queen. How far this accusation was true\r\nit is at this moment difficult to say, but there is no doubt that the\r\nThrogmortons, with the Earl of Northumberland, who was imprisoned, Lord\r\nPaget, who fled, and many other Catholics, were in league with Charles\r\nPaget for a rising, in conjunction with Guise.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that Lord Burghley took no part in the prosecution of\r\nThrogmorton, which was mainly forwarded by Leicester, who was always\r\nsuspected of having poisoned Sir Nicholas Throgmorton, the uncle of the\r\naccused man. The apprehension of the conspirators and the consequent\r\nexpulsion of Mendoza (January 1584) certainly served the purposes of the\r\nstrong Protestant majority led by Leicester[490] and Walsingham in the\r\nCouncil, and aided them in forcing the hands of the Queen and Burghley.\r\nThe death of Alençon in June, and the murder of Orange by an agent of\r\nthe Spaniards in July, still further acted in the same direction. It was\r\nno longer possible for England to hold a non-committal position. Either\r\nSpain must be permitted to crush Protestantism in the Netherlands, or the\r\nhead of the Protestant confederacy must cast aside the mask and boldly\r\nfight the Catholic powers. There were reasons why this course might now\r\nbe taken with much more safety than previously. The Queen-mother of\r\nFrance was frantic with rage against Spain for the loss of her favourite\r\nson. The King was childless, and the Guises were already plotting to\r\ngrasp the crown, or partition France on Henry’s death, rather than he\r\nshould be succeeded by the Huguenot Henry of Navarre. Elizabeth had\r\ntherefore the certainty, for the first time since her accession, that\r\nFrance nationally would not coalesce with Spain against her, and that\r\nany attempt of Guise to injure her would be counteracted by Catharine,\r\nNavarre and the Huguenots.\r\n\r\nThe question of the future policy to be pursued by England under\r\nthe changed circumstances was, as usual, submitted to the judicial\r\nexamination of Lord Burghley, whose minutes[491] set forth the whole\r\ncase _pro_ and _contra_. The question propounded was, “Shall the Queen\r\ndefend and help the Low Countries to recover from the tyranny of Spain\r\nand the Inquisition; and if not, what shall she do to protect England\r\nwhen he shall have subdued Holland?” After stating the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of each course, it is evident that the judgment is in\r\nfavour of aiding the States, on certain conditions of security, which\r\nBurghley himself notes in the margin. The aid is to cost as little as\r\npossible; some of the best noblemen of Zeeland are to be held as hostages\r\nin the hands of the English; the chief military commands to be held\r\nby English officers; the King of Scots to be secured to the English\r\ninterest; the King of Navarre to embarrass Spain on her frontiers, and\r\na Parliament to be called in England for the purpose of sanctioning the\r\ncourse proposed. But, continues the document, if it is decided that\r\nEngland shall not help the States, then she must be put into a condition\r\nof defence, the navy increased, a large sum of money collected, some\r\nGerman mercenaries engaged to watch the Scottish Border, and the English\r\nCatholics “put in surety.” “Finally, that ought to be Alpha and Omega,\r\nto cause her people to be better taught to serve God, and to see justice\r\nduly administered, whereby they may serve God, and love her Majesty; and\r\nthat if it may be concluded, _Si Deus nobiscum, quis contra nos?_”\r\n\r\nLord Burghley was thus, after a quarter of a century of striving to keep\r\non friendly relations with Spain, forced by the policy of Leicester,\r\nWalsingham, and the strong Protestants, into the contest which he\r\nhad hoped to avoid. Circumstances had been stronger than individual\r\npredilections, and Mary Stuart’s ceaseless designs against the crown and\r\nfaith of England, and especially her submission to Spain, had given the\r\nProtestant party an impetus which swept aside the cautious moderation of\r\nBurghley’s policy, and proved even to him the necessity for war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n1584-1587\r\n\r\n\r\nThe militant Protestants were now paramount in Elizabeth’s Council, and\r\nsoon made their influence felt, not only in foreign relations, but in\r\nhome affairs as well. They were in favour of an aggressive policy in\r\naid of Protestantism abroad, and doubtless thought that the best way\r\nto strengthen their hands would be to strike at Prelacy at home, and\r\nto discredit the last vestiges of the old faith, against the foreign\r\nchampions of which they were ready to do national battle.\r\n\r\nThe appointment of Whitgift to the Archbishopric of Canterbury had been\r\navowedly made by the Queen (September 1583) for the purpose of repairing\r\nthe effects of Grindal’s leniency, and bringing the Nonconformists to\r\nobedience; “to hold a strait rein, to press the discipline of his Church,\r\nand recover his province to uniformity.” He had set about his work with a\r\nthoroughness which brought upon him a storm of reproach from ministers,\r\nand greatly embittered the controversies within the Church.[492] Burghley\r\nfelt strongly on the question of uniformity, as involving obedience\r\nto the law; but Whitgift’s methods were too severe even for him, and\r\nproduced from him more than one rebuke. He was the referee of all\r\nparties—Puritans, Churchmen, and Catholics appealed to him as their\r\nfriend—and he strove to hold the balance fairly, whilst deprecating\r\nextreme views on each side. Leicester and Knollys were ceaseless in the\r\nattacks upon the prelates, and Whitgift’s violence made it difficult for\r\nBurghley to defend him. In one of his letters to the Archbishop he says,\r\n“I am sorry to trouble your Grace, but I am more troubled myself, not\r\nonly with many private petitions of ministers recommended by persons of\r\ncredit as being peaceable persons in their ministry, but yet more with\r\ncomplaints to your Grace and colleagues, greatly troubled; but also I am\r\nnow daily charged by Councillors and public persons to neglect my duty\r\nin not staying your Grace’s proceedings, so vehement and general against\r\nministers and preachers, as the Papists are thereby encouraged, and\r\nill-disposed subjects animated, and her Majesty’s safety endangered.”\r\n\r\nNow that the Puritan party had the upper hand, Burghley’s proverbial\r\nmiddle course was not strong enough for his colleagues, and they\r\ndetermined to deal with Prelacy and Papacy at the same time. The first\r\nthing was to pack the new Parliament, and in this Leicester laboured\r\nunblushingly. Sir Simon D’Ewes’ Journal sets forth the great number of\r\nblank proxies sent to the Earl; and if his letter to the electors of\r\nAndover is typical, this is not to be wondered at. He boldly asks them to\r\nsend him “your election in blank, and I will put in the names.” Another\r\nletter from the Privy Council to Lord Cobham[493] directs him to obtain\r\nthe nomination of all the members for the Cinque Ports. Parliament\r\nmet at the end of November, and a formal complaint of the Puritan and\r\nNonconformist ministers was presented to the House of Commons, which,\r\nafter reducing the number of its articles from thirty-four to sixteen, it\r\nadopted and laid before the House of Lords. Whitgift and his colleagues\r\nfought hard, cautiously aided by Burghley and the Queen, who, when\r\nshe afterwards dismissed Parliament, roundly scolded the members for\r\ninterfering with her religious prerogative; and the only effect of the\r\ncomplaints was to enable Burghley to exert pressure upon the prelates to\r\nallay their zeal.\r\n\r\nThe attack of the militant Protestants against the Catholics, however,\r\nwas more effectual, although even that was somewhat palliated by Lord\r\nBurghley’s moderation. It was evident now that the Catholic League\r\nabroad and its instruments would stick at nothing. Father Creighton,\r\nthe priest who had played so prominent a part in the abortive plans of\r\nD’Aubigny, Mendoza, and the Jesuits, had been captured with some of his\r\nbrother seminarists, and the rack had torn from them confirmation of the\r\ndesperate plans of which the Throgmorton conspiracy had given an inkling.\r\nLeicester and his party had aroused Protestant horror of such projects to\r\nfever heat. At his instance an association had been formed, pledged by\r\noath to defend the Queen’s life or to avenge it, and to exclude for ever\r\nfrom the throne any person who might benefit by the Queen’s removal. Mary\r\nStuart somewhat naturally regarded the last clause as directed against\r\nherself, and endeavoured to take the sting from it by offering her own\r\nqualified adhesion to the association, which, however, was declined.\r\n\r\nWhen the association was legalised by a bill in Parliament, the Queen\r\n(Elizabeth), under Burghley’s influence, sent a message to the House,\r\nabating some of the objectionable features, and reconciling it with the\r\nrules of English equity. No penalties were to accrue before the persons\r\naccused had been found guilty by a regular commission, and Mary and her\r\nheirs were excused from forfeiture, unless Elizabeth were assassinated.\r\n\r\nThe new bill against Catholics was easily passed, under feelings such\r\nas those prevailing in the House and the country, and the enactment was\r\nregarded as a natural retort to the promulgation of the Papal bulls in\r\nfavour of revolution in England. All native Jesuits and seminarists\r\nfound in England after forty days were to be treated as traitors, and\r\nit was felony to shelter or harbour them. English students or priests\r\nabroad were to be forced to return within six months and take the oath\r\nof supremacy, or incur the penalty for high treason; and many similar\r\nprovisions were made, by which the world could see that the militant\r\nProtestants of England had picked up the gage thrown down by Philip and\r\nthe Pope. Henceforward it was to be war to the knife until one side or\r\nthe other was vanquished, and Lord Burghley’s astute policy of balance\r\nand compromise was cast into the background after a quarter of a century\r\nof almost unbroken success.[494]\r\n\r\nAlmost the only dissenting voice in the House of Commons against the\r\npenal bill was that of Dr. William Parry, member for Queenborough. In\r\na violent and abusive speech, he said that the House was so evidently\r\nbiassed that it was useless to give it the special reasons he had for\r\nopposing the bill, but would state them to the Queen alone. This was\r\nconsidered insulting to the House, and he was committed to the charge\r\nof the sergeant-at-arms, but was released by the Queen and Council the\r\nfollowing day. The events which followed form one of the unsolved riddles\r\nof history. Parry was a man of bad character, who for years had been one\r\nof Burghley’s many spies upon the English refugees on the Continent. He\r\nappears, however, to have been esteemed more highly by the Treasurer than\r\nsuch instruments usually are.\r\n\r\nWhen young Anthony Bacon was sent on his travels to France, his uncle,\r\nBurghley, specially instructed him to cultivate the acquaintance of Dr.\r\nParry. Leicester complained to the Queen of this, and the Lord Treasurer\r\nundertook that his nephew should not be shaken either in loyalty or\r\nreligion by his acquaintanceship with Parry.[495] After the latter\r\nreturned to England in 1583 he was elected member of the Parliament of\r\nthe following year, after having persistently but unsuccessfully begged\r\na sinecure office from Burghley. From his first arrival he had been full\r\nof real or pretended plots for the assassination of the Queen, which he\r\nprofessed to have discovered on the Continent. He was, like all men of\r\nhis profession, an unprincipled scamp, and made these secret disclosures\r\nthe ground for ceaseless demands for reward. He was disappointed and\r\ndiscontented, as well as vain and boastful, and overshot the mark. In one\r\nof his interviews with the Queen he produced a somewhat doubtfully worded\r\nletter of approval from the Papal Secretary of State, Cardinal Como,[496]\r\nwhich, he said, referred to a pretended project undertaken by him (Parry)\r\nfor the murder of the Queen. He talked loosely to Charles Neville and\r\nother Catholics of this plot as a real one, and six weeks after his\r\nescapade in Parliament was arrested and lodged in jail. At first he would\r\nadmit nothing, but the fear of the rack, or some other motive, produced\r\nfrom him a full and complete confession of a regular plan—once, he said,\r\nnearly executed—for killing Elizabeth; but before sentence he vehemently\r\nretracted, and appealed to the knowledge of the Queen, Burghley, and\r\nWalsingham that he was innocent. But if they possessed this knowledge\r\nthey never revealed it, and Parry died the revolting death of a traitor,\r\nclamouring to the last that Elizabeth herself was responsible for his\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that Parry was an _agent provocateur_, and great\r\nquestion arises as to the reality of the crime for which he was punished.\r\nI have found no trace in the Spanish correspondence of his having been a\r\ntool of Mendoza or Philip, such as exists in the cases of Throgmorton,\r\nBabington, and others; and I consider that the evidence generally favours\r\nthe idea that he was deliberately caught in his own lure, and sacrificed\r\nin order to aggravate the anti-Catholic fervour in the country, and\r\nsecure the passage of the penal enactments. In one particular I dissent\r\nfrom nearly every historian who has written on the subject. All fingers\r\npoint at Lord Burghley as the author of the plan. I look upon it as being\r\nthe work of Leicester, Knollys, and Walsingham. It was they, and not\r\nBurghley, who were anxious to strengthen the fervent Protestant party.\r\nIt was they, and not Burghley, who were forcing the penal enactments\r\nthrough the Parliament they had packed. The Treasurer could hardly have\r\nbeen blind to what was going on, but he could not afford to champion\r\nParry. The latter, a venal scoundrel known to be in Burghley’s pay, but\r\ndiscontented with his patron, was doubtless bought by Leicester to play\r\nhis part in Parliament, and afterwards to confess the Catholic plot on\r\nthe assurance of pardon, with the object of blackening the Catholics, and\r\nperhaps, by implication, Burghley as well.\r\n\r\nThat Leicester’s friends were at the time seeking to represent the\r\nLord Treasurer as against the Protestant cause is clear from several\r\nindignant letters written by Burghley himself. “If they cannot,” he says,\r\n“prove all their lies, let them make use of any _one_ proof wherewith\r\nto prove me guilty of falsehood, injustice, bribery or dissimulation\r\nor double-dealing in Council, either with her Majesty or with her\r\nCouncillors. Let them charge me on _any_ point that I have not dealt as\r\nearnestly with the Queen to aid the afflicted in the Low Countries to\r\nwithstand the increasing power of the King of Spain, the assurance of\r\nthe King of Scots to be tied to her Majesty with reward, yea, with the\r\ngreatest pension that any other hath. If in any of these I am proved to\r\nbe behind or slower than any in a discreet manner, I will yield myself\r\nworthy of perpetual reproach as though I were guilty of all they use\r\nto bluster against me. They that say in rash and malicious mockery\r\nthat England is become _Regnum Cecilianum_ may use their own cankered\r\nhumour.” In July of the same year he writes in similar strain to Sir\r\nThomas Edmunds:[497] “If you knew how earnest a course I hold with her\r\nMajesty, both privately and openly, for her to retain the King of Scots\r\nwith friendship and liberality, yea, and to retain the Master of Gray and\r\nJustice-Clerk, with rewards to continue their offices, which indeed are\r\nwell known to me to be very good, you would think there could be no more\r\nshameful lies made by Satan himself than these be; and finding myself\r\nthus maliciously bitten with the tongues and pens of courtiers here, if\r\nGod did not comfort me, I had cause to fear murdering hands or poisoning\r\npoints; but God is my keeper.”\r\n\r\nThe more or less hollow negotiations for the liberation of Mary, and for\r\nthe association of her son with herself in her sovereign rights, had\r\ndragged on intermittently for years. Burghley himself has set forth the\r\nreasons for the successive failures;[498] in each case the discovery of\r\nsome fresh plot in her favour. The serious set of conspiracies brought to\r\nlight in 1584 had caused her removal from the mild custody of Burghley’s\r\nfriend, Lord Shrewsbury, to that of the rigid Puritan, Sir Amyas Paulet,\r\nat Tutbury. In her troubles the captive Queen, like every one else,\r\nappealed to Burghley, and especially in the matter of the reckless\r\naccusations of immorality brought by the Countess of Shrewsbury and her\r\nCavendish sons against her husband and Mary.[499]\r\n\r\nBurghley’s kindness in this matter, and his attempts to soften the\r\nfresh severity of the Queen’s captivity, had not only persuaded Mary’s\r\nagents that he was her friend,[500] but had given to Leicester and his\r\nparty an excuse for spreading rumours to the Treasurer’s detriment. At\r\nan inopportune time, Nau, Mary’s French secretary, had gone to London\r\nwith new plans of associated sovereignty; but almost simultaneously the\r\nMaster of Gray had arrived as James’s Ambassador. He was easily bought\r\nby the English Government, as we have seen, with the full approval\r\nof Burghley;[501] and on his return to Scotland promptly caused the\r\nrejection by the Lords of Nau’s project in favour of Mary. It was never\r\non the question of securing the Scots by bribery to the English interest\r\nthat Burghley was remiss. It was open war with Spain that he always\r\nopposed.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the toils were closing round the unhappy Mary. She\r\nhad now thrown herself entirely into the arms of Spain; and the Guises\r\nwere being gradually but steadily forced into the background by Philip,\r\nas being likely to frustrate his plans, by claiming for their kinsman,\r\nJames Stuart, the succession of England after his mother. Every letter\r\nto and from Tutbury was intercepted by Paulet. Morgan, Charles Paget,\r\nRobert Bruce, and others, in their communications with Mary, laid bare\r\nher hopes and their intrigues.[502] If any doubts had previously existed\r\nas to the intentions of Spain and the Queen of Scots, they could exist\r\nno longer. The only question for England was how best to withstand the\r\ncombination against her. Here, as usual, Burghley was at issue with the\r\nnow dominant party of militant Protestants; and equally, as usual, his\r\nopposition was cautious and indirect. Leicester and his friends were for\r\nopen operations against Spain both in the Netherlands and on the high\r\nseas, and for helping Henry III. to withstand the Guises; whilst the\r\nTreasurer preferred to stand on the defensive, and keep as much money in\r\nhand as possible.[503] Elizabeth rarely required urging to parsimony, and\r\nby appealing to her weakness Burghley was able for a time to moderate the\r\nplans of the other party.\r\n\r\nBut events were too strong for him. Mainly by his influence Leicester had\r\nbeen restrained since 1580 from subsidising a great expedition against\r\nPhilip in favour of the Portuguese Pretender, Don Antonio; but in the\r\nspring of 1585 the treacherous seizure of English ships in Spain had\r\naroused the English to fury. Drake’s great expedition of twenty-nine\r\nships was fitted out, and general reprisals authorised. Never was an\r\nexpedition more popular than this, for the English sailors were aching\r\nfor a fight with foes they knew they could beat, and Burghley’s cautions\r\nwere scouted. Drake’s fleet sailed in September, doubtful to the last\r\nmoment whether the Queen would not be prevailed upon to stay it;[504]\r\nand by sacking Santo Domingo and ravaging Santiago and Cartagena almost\r\nwithout hindrance, demonstrated the ineffective clumsiness of Philip’s\r\nmethods. Leicester and the war-party were now almost unrestrained; for\r\nthe Lord Treasurer made the best of it, and confined his efforts to\r\nminimising the cost of the new policy as much as possible, and suggesting\r\ncaution to the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioners from the States continued to urge the Queen to\r\nassume the sovereignty of the Netherlands, and to govern the country,\r\neither directly or through a nominee; but this was a responsibility\r\nwhich neither she nor Burghley cared to accept. At length, after much\r\nhesitation on the part of the Queen, Sir John Norris was sent with an\r\nEnglish force of 5000 men to take possession of the strong cautionary\r\nplaces offered by the Hollanders, and Leicester was designated to follow\r\nas Lieutenant-General of the Queen’s forces (September 1585).\r\n\r\nElizabeth approached the business with fear and trembling. It was a\r\ndeparture from Burghley’s safe and tried policy, and was involving her in\r\nlarge expenditure. She distrusted rebels and popular governments; she did\r\nnot like to send away her best troops in a time of danger, and she railed\r\noften and loudly at Leicester and Walsingham for dragging her into such a\r\npass. Only a day after Leicester’s appointment she changed her mind and\r\nbade him suspend his preparations. “Her pleasure is,” wrote Walsingham,\r\n“that you proceed no further until you speak with her. How this cometh\r\nabout I know not. The matter is to be kept secret. These changes here\r\nmay work some such changes in the Low Countries as may prove irreparable.\r\nGod give her Majesty another mind, … or it will work both hers and her\r\nbest affected subjects’ ruin.”[505] To this Leicester wrote one letter\r\nof submission to be shown to the Queen, and the other for Walsingham’s\r\nown eye, full of indignation. “This,” he says, “is the strangest dealing\r\nin the world.… What must be thought of such an alteration? I am weary of\r\nlife and all.”\r\n\r\nElizabeth had, however, gone too far now to retire, and Leicester’s\r\njourney went forward. But it is plain to see that whilst he was making\r\nhis preparations to act as sovereign on his own account, the Queen,\r\ninfluenced by Burghley, was drafting his instructions in a way that\r\nstrictly limited his power for harm, and minimised her responsibility\r\ntowards Spain. Leicester was directed to “let the States understand that\r\nwhereby their Commissioners made offer unto her Majesty, first of the\r\nsovereignty of those countries, which for sundry respects she did not\r\naccept; secondly, under her protection to be governed absolutely by such\r\nas her Majesty would appoint and send over as her Lieutenant. That her\r\nMajesty, although she would not take so much upon her as to command them\r\nin such absolute sort, yet unless they should show themselves forward to\r\nuse the advice of her Majesty … she would think her favours unworthily\r\nbestowed upon them.”\r\n\r\nThis must have been gall and wormwood for Leicester, for in his own\r\nnotes he lays down as his guiding principles, “First, that he have as\r\nmuch authoryte as the Prince of Orange had; or any other Captain-General\r\nhath had heretofore: second, that there be as much allowance by the\r\nStates for the said Governor as the Prince had, with all offices\r\napportenaunt.”[506] He had infinite trouble in getting money from the\r\nQueen, and went so far as to offer to pledge his own lands to her\r\nas security; but at last, in December, all was ready, and Leicester\r\nfoolishly went to Holland with his vague ambitions, leaving Burghley in\r\npossession at home. It is plain from his beseeching letter of farewell to\r\nthe Lord Treasurer that he recognised the danger. He prays him earnestly\r\nnot to have any change made in the plans agreed upon, and to provide\r\nsufficient resources for the sake of the cause involved and for the\r\nQueen’s honour. “Hir Majesty, I se, my lord, often tymes doth fall into\r\nmyslyke of this cause, and sondry opinions yt may brede in hir withal,\r\nbut I trust in the Lord, seeing hir Highness hath thus far resolved, and\r\ngone also to this far executyon as she hath, and that myne and other\r\nmenne’s poor lives are adventured for hir sake, that she will fortify\r\nand mainteyn her own action to the full performance that she hath agreed\r\non.”[507] Burghley was very ill at the time, unable to rise from his\r\ncouch, but in answer to the Earl’s appeal he assured him that he would\r\nconsider himself “accursed in the sight of God” if he did not strive\r\nearnestly to promote the success of the expedition.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Treasurer was, of course, sincere in his desire to prevent the\r\ncollapse of the Protestant cause in the Netherlands, for he had never\r\nceased for years to insist that the quietude of England mainly depended\r\nupon it. Where he differed from Leicester was in his determination, if\r\npossible, to avoid such action as would lead to an open breach with\r\nSpain. Before even Leicester landed at Flushing he had begun to quarrel\r\nwith the Dutchmen, and in a fortnight was intriguing to obtain an offer\r\nof the sovereignty of the States for himself. The offer was made, and\r\nmodestly refused at first; but on further pressure Leicester accepted\r\nthe sovereignty, as he had intended to do from the first (January 1586).\r\nThe rage of Elizabeth knew no bounds. This would make her infamous, she\r\nsaid, to all the world. Leicester was timid at the consequences of the\r\nstep he had taken, and made matters worse by delaying for weeks to write\r\nexplanations to the angry Queen. Walsingham and Hatton did their best,\r\nbut very ineffectually, to appease her. Burghley in a letter to Leicester\r\n(7th February) assured him that he too had done so, and that he himself\r\napproved of his action, and hoped to “move her Majesty to alter her hard\r\nopinion.” As we have seen, Burghley’s opposition was seldom direct, and\r\nit may be accepted as probable that he mildly deprecated the Queen’s\r\nanger against her favourite; but a remark in a letter (17th February)\r\nfrom Davison, who was sent by Leicester to explain and extenuate his act\r\nto the Queen,[508] seems to show that the Lord Treasurer’s advocacy had\r\nnot been so earnest as he would have had Leicester to believe.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had ordered Heneage to go to Holland post-haste, to command\r\nLeicester openly to abandon his new title; but from the 7th February\r\ntill the 14th, whilst Heneage’s harsh instructions were being drafted,\r\nBurghley was diplomatically absent from court, and the pleading of\r\nWalsingham and Hatton had no softening effect upon the Queen. On the\r\n13th February, Davison at length arrived with Leicester’s excuses. The\r\nQueen railed and stormed until he was reduced to tears. She refused at\r\nfirst to receive Leicester’s letter or to delay Heneage’s departure.\r\nBurghley arrived the next day, and Davison writes on the 17th that he\r\n“_had successfully exerted himself to convince the Lord Treasurer that\r\nthe measures adopted were necessary_, and that his Lordship had urged the\r\nQueen on the subject.”\r\n\r\nThe only effect of Burghley’s persuasion, however, was to obtain for\r\nHeneage discretion to withhold, if he considered necessary, the Queen’s\r\nletter to the States, and to save Leicester from the degradation of\r\na public renunciation. Burghley had thus done his best to preserve\r\nLeicester’s friendship and gratitude; but, after all, it was his policy,\r\nand not that of Leicester, that was triumphant. Heneage was a friend\r\nof the Earl’s, and on his arrival in Holland delayed action; but the\r\nQueen was not to be appeased. She had, she said, been slighted, and her\r\ncommission exceeded, and would send no money till her instructions were\r\nfulfilled. Confusion and danger naturally resulted, and Leicester’s\r\nfriends redoubled their efforts to save him. Burghley himself assured\r\nLeicester (31st March) that he had threatened to resign his office unless\r\nshe changed her course. “I used boldly such language in this matter, as\r\nI found her doubtful whether to charge me with presumption, which partly\r\nshe did, or with some astonishment of my round speech, which truly was no\r\nother than my conscience did move me, even in _amaritudine anima_. And\r\nthen her Majesty began to be more calm than before, and, as I conceived,\r\nreadier to qualify her displeasure.”[509]\r\n\r\nWhen the Queen saw that Heneage and Leicester were construing her\r\nleniency into acquiescence of the Earl’s action, she blazed out again;\r\nand when Burghley begged her to allow Heneage to return and explain the\r\ncircumstances, “she grew so passionate in the matter that she forbade me\r\nto argue more;” and herself wrote a letter to Heneage containing these\r\nwords: “Do as you are bidden, and leave your considerations for your own\r\naffairs; for in some things you had clear commandment, which you did\r\nnot do, and in others none, which you did.” At the urgent prayer of the\r\nStates, however, representing the danger to the cause which a public\r\ndeposition of Leicester would bring about, the Queen finally allowed\r\nmatters to rest until they could devise some harmless way out of the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole business Burghley almost ostentatiously acted the\r\npart of Leicester’s friend. It was a safe course for him to take, for\r\nthe Queen was so angry that he could keep the good-will of Leicester\r\nand the Protestants, and yet be certain of the ultimate failure of his\r\nopponent. As soon as the States understood Leicester’s position, and had\r\nrealised his incompetence, they were only too anxious to be rid of him;\r\nand throughout his inglorious government Burghley could well speak in\r\nhis favour, for it must have been evident that the Earl was working his\r\nown ruin, and that his position was untenable. One curious feature in\r\nthe matter is that both Burghley and Walsingham hinted to Leicester that\r\nthe Queen was being influenced by some one underhand. “Surely,” writes\r\nthe Secretary, “there is some treachery amongst ourselves, for I cannot\r\nthink she would do this out of her own head;” and the gossip of the court\r\npointed at Ralegh, who wrote to Leicester[510] vigorously protesting\r\nagainst the calumny.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, wheels within wheels in Elizabeth’s court. Two of\r\nher Councillors were Spanish spies, Ralegh was Burghley’s partisan, the\r\nConservative party in favour of friendship with the House of Burgundy\r\nwas not dead, and, notwithstanding all that has been written, it may\r\nbe fairly assumed that the decadence of Leicester and the militant\r\nProtestant party during the Earl’s absence in Holland did not take place\r\nwithout some secret prompting from Lord Burghley.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the plans for the invasion of England were gradually\r\nmaturing in Philip’s slow mind. The raid of Drake’s fleet upon his\r\ncolonies, and Leicester’s assumption of the sovereignty of the\r\nNetherlands, had at last convinced Philip, after nearly thirty years of\r\nhesitancy, that England must be coerced into Catholicism, or Spain must\r\ndescend from its high estate. So long as the elevation of Mary Stuart\r\nmeant a Guisan domination of England, with shifty James as his mother’s\r\nheir, it had not suited Philip to squander his much needed resources upon\r\nthe overthrow of Elizabeth; but by this time Guise was pledged to vast\r\nambitions in France, which could only be realised by Philip’s help. The\r\nJesuits and English Catholics had persuaded the Spaniard that he would be\r\nwelcomed in England, whilst a Scot or a Frenchman would be resisted to\r\nthe death. Most of Mary’s agents, too, had been bribed to the same side,\r\nand Mendoza in Paris was her prime adviser and mainstay. Various attempts\r\nwere made by the Scottish Catholics and Guise’s friends to manage the\r\nsubjugation of England over the Scottish Border; but though Philip\r\naffected to listen to their approaches, and used them as a diversion, his\r\nplan was already fixed—England must be won by Spaniards in Mary’s name,\r\nand be held thenceforward in Spanish hands. Mary was ready to agree to\r\nanything, and at the prompting of Philip’s agents she disinherited her\r\nson (June 1586) in favour of the King of Spain. Morgan, Paget, and others\r\nhad at last succeeded in reopening communication with Mary, who had\r\nnow lost all hope of release except by force. A close alliance between\r\nEngland and James VI. had been agreed to: she knew that no help would\r\ncome from her son or his Government; and her many letters to Charles\r\nPaget, to Mendoza, and to Philip himself, leave no doubt whatever that\r\nshe was fully cognisant of the plans for the overthrow, and perhaps\r\nmurder, of Elizabeth, in order that she, Mary, might be raised by Spanish\r\npikes to the English throne.[511]\r\n\r\nIn May 1586 the priest Ballard had seen Mendoza in Paris, and had sought\r\nthe countenance of Spain for the assassination of Elizabeth; and in\r\nAugust the matter had so far progressed as to enable Gifford to give to\r\nMendoza full particulars of the vile plan. There was, according to his\r\naccount, hardly a Catholic or schismatic gentleman in England who was not\r\nin favour of the plot; and though Philip always distrusted a conspiracy\r\nknown to many, he promised armed help from Flanders if the Queen were\r\nkilled. Mendoza, when he saw Gifford, recommended that Don Antonio,\r\nBurghley, Walsingham, Hunsdon, Knollys, and Beale should be killed; but\r\nthe King wrote on the margin of the letter, “It does not matter so much\r\nabout Cecil, although he is a great heretic, but he is very old, and it\r\nwas he who advised the understandings with the Prince of Parma, and he\r\nhas done no harm. It would be advisable to do as he [_i.e._ Mendoza] says\r\nwith the others.”[512]\r\n\r\nThe folly of Babington and his friends almost passes belief. They seem to\r\nhave been prodigal of their confidences, and to have had no apprehension\r\nof treachery. Babington’s own letter to Mary setting forth in full\r\nall the plans in favour of “his dear sovereign” (6th July) was handed\r\nimmediately by the false agent Gifford to Walsingham. No move was made\r\nby Walsingham, except to send the clever clerk Phillips to Chartley to\r\ndecipher all intercepted letters on the spot, and so to avoid delay in\r\ntheir delivery, which might arouse the suspicion of the conspirators.\r\nSurrounded by spies and traitors, but in fancied security, the unhappy\r\nQueen involved herself daily deeper in the traps laid for her; approved\r\nof Babington’s wild plans, and made provision for her own release, whilst\r\nWalsingham watched and waited. When the proofs were incontestable, and\r\nall in the Secretary’s hands, the blow fell. On the 4th August Ballard\r\nwas arrested, Babington and the intended murderer Savage a day or so\r\nafterwards, and Mary Stuart’s doom was sealed. She was hurried off\r\ntemporarily to Tixhall; Nau and Curll were placed under arrest, the\r\nQueen’s papers seized, and her rooms closely examined. Amias Paulet was\r\na faithful jailer, and he did his work well. “Amyas, my most faithful,\r\ncareful servant,” wrote Elizabeth, “God reward thee treblefold for the\r\nmost troublesome charge so well discharged. If you knew, my Amyas, how\r\nkindly, besides most dutifully, my grateful heart accepts and prizes\r\nyour spotless endeavours and faultless actions, your wise orders and safe\r\nregard, performed in so dangerous and crafty a charge, it would ease your\r\ntravail and rejoice your heart.… Let your wicked murderess know how with\r\nhearty sorrow her vile deserts compel these orders, and bid her from me\r\nask God’s forgiveness for her treacherous dealing.” Elizabeth and her\r\nministers rightly appreciated the great peril which she had escaped, and\r\nfrom the first it was recognised by most of them that Mary had forfeited\r\nall claim to consideration at their hands.[513]\r\n\r\nIt is usually assumed by a certain class of writers that Mary was\r\nunjustly hounded to her death, mainly by the personal enmity of Lord\r\nBurghley. Nothing, in reality, is more distant from the truth. A most\r\ndangerous conspiracy against the government and religion of England had\r\nbeen discovered, in which she was a prime mover. Her accomplices rightly\r\nsuffered the penalty of their crime,[514] and it was due to justice and\r\nto the safety of the country that the mainspring of the conspiracy should\r\nbe disabled for further harm. But still the matter was a delicate and\r\ndangerous one, for Catholics were numerous in England, and the great\r\nCatholic confederacy abroad was ready to take any advantage which a\r\nfalse step on the part of Elizabeth might give them. As we have seen,\r\nmoreover, the feelings of the Queen of England herself with regard to\r\nthe sacredness of anointed sovereigns was strong, and no more difficult\r\nproblem had ever faced the Government than how to dispose of their\r\ntroublesome guest in a way that should in future safeguard England\r\nfrom her machinations, whilst respecting the many susceptibilities\r\ninvolved. As usual in moments of difficulty, Elizabeth turned to her aged\r\nminister,[515] and as a result of a long private conference with him\r\nthe question was submitted to the Privy Council. The Catholic members\r\nadvocated only a further stringency in Mary’s imprisonment. Leicester\r\nwas in favour of solving the difficulty by the aid of poison,[516]\r\nwhilst Burghley, followed by Walsingham and others, proposed a regular\r\njudicial inquiry, which was now legally possible by virtue of the Act of\r\nAssociation passed by Parliament in the previous year. A commission was\r\nconsequently issued on the 6th October for the trial of Mary, containing\r\nthe names of forty-six of the principal peers and judges, and all the\r\nCouncillors, but only after some bickering between the Queen and Burghley\r\nwith regard to the style to be given to Mary and other details.[517]\r\n\r\nBefore this point had been reached, however, measures had been taken to\r\ntest the feeling of foreign powers on the subject. Diplomatic relations\r\nhad ceased between Spain and England; but as soon as the Babington\r\nconspiracy was discovered, Walsingham impressed upon Chateauneuf, the\r\nFrench Ambassador, that the Spaniards were at the bottom of it, and that\r\nit was directed almost as much against the King of France as against\r\nElizabeth herself. The Ambassador himself was a strong Guisan,[518] and\r\npersonally was an object of odium and suspicion to the excited Londoners;\r\nbut his master’s hatred of the Guises and dread of their objects was\r\ngrowing daily, and when Madame de Montpensier prayed Henry to intercede\r\nfor the protection of Mary, she obtained but a cold answer;[519] and no\r\nofficial step by the French was taken in her favour at the time, except\r\nas a matter of justice Elizabeth was requested that she might have the\r\nassistance of counsel. It was clear, therefore, that Henry III. would not\r\ngo to war for the sake of his sister-in-law.\r\n\r\nMary was removed to Fotheringay for trial on the 6th October, and on the\r\nfollowing day Paulet and Mildmay delivered to her Elizabeth’s letter,\r\ninforming her of the charges against her, and the tribunal to which she\r\nwas to be submitted. She indignantly refused to acknowledge Elizabeth’s\r\nright to place her, an anointed sovereign, upon her trial; but she\r\ndenied all knowledge and complicity in the murder plot. This was the\r\nsafest attitude she could have assumed, although the proofs against\r\nher already in the hands of Elizabeth were overwhelming;[520] and the\r\narguments of Burghley and Lord Chancellor Bromley failed to alter Mary’s\r\ndetermination. This was embarrassing, and in the face of it Elizabeth\r\nwrote to Burghley[521] instructing him that, although the examination\r\nmight proceed, no judgment was to be delivered until she had conferred\r\nwith him. At the same time she wrote to Mary a letter of mingled threats\r\nand hope, with the object of changing her attitude towards the tribunal.\r\nThis, added to the persuasions of Hatton, succeeded in the object,[522]\r\nand Mary, unfortunately for her, retreated from her unassailable position.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th, two days afterwards, the tribunal sat in the great hall of\r\nFotheringay Castle, and Mary, almost crippled with rheumatism, painfully\r\nhobbled to her place, supported by her Steward, Sir Andrew Melvil. On\r\nthe right of the Lord Chancellor sat Lord Burghley. That the proceedings\r\nagainst Mary, in which he had from the first taken an active part, were\r\nin his opinion necessary for the safety of England, is clear from his\r\nmany letters upon the subject; but it is equally evident that if he could\r\ndecently have avoided personal identification with them he would have\r\nbeen better pleased. His letters to Popham, the Attorney-General, show\r\nthat he wished to be absent from the trial; but as he wrote at the time\r\nto Sir Edward Stafford, the English Ambassador in France, “I was never\r\nmore toiled than I have been of late, and yet am, with services that here\r\ndo multiply daily; and whosoever scapeth I am never spared. God give me\r\ngrace.”\r\n\r\nMuch of the obloquy that has been unjustly cast upon him in the matter\r\nof Mary Stuart arises from his inveterate habit of putting everything in\r\nwriting, which other men did not do. For instance, the draft of the whole\r\ncase, or, as he puts it, “the indignities and wrongs done and offered\r\nby the Queen of Scots to the Queen,” is in his handwriting,[523] and the\r\nletters to the Queen detailing the progress of events at Fotheringay are\r\nsent from him, whilst Elizabeth’s instructions through Davison are all\r\naddressed to Walsingham and Burghley. But it must be remembered that\r\nhe was the Queen’s most trusted and experienced Councillor, and the\r\nexistence of records written by or to him does not show that he was more\r\neager than the rest for the sacrifice of the Scottish Queen.\r\n\r\nMary defended herself with consummate ability before a tribunal almost\r\nentirely prejudiced against her. She was deprived of legal aid, without\r\nher papers, and in ill health; and, according to modern notions, the\r\nprocedure against her was unjust in the extreme. Once she turned upon\r\nWalsingham and denounced him as the contriver of her ruin, but soon\r\nregained her composure; and in her argument with Burghley, with respect\r\nto the avowals of Babington and her Secretaries, reached a point of\r\ntouching eloquence which might have moved the hearts, though it did not\r\nconvince the intellects, of her august judges.[524] But her condemnation\r\nwas a foregone conclusion; and although the sentence was not pronounced\r\nuntil the return of the Commission to Westminster (October 25), Mary left\r\nthe hall of Fotheringay practically a condemned felon on the 15th.\r\n\r\nBut it was one thing to condemn and another thing to execute. Here\r\nElizabeth’s scruples again assailed her. The two Houses of Parliament\r\naddressed her on the 12th November, begging that for the sake of the\r\nrealm and her own safety the sentence might be carried into effect. At no\r\npoint of her career was the profound duplicity of Elizabeth more resorted\r\nto than now. She had evidently determined that Mary must die, which is of\r\nitself not surprising; but she was equally determined that, if she could\r\nhelp it, no blame should personally attach to her for having disregarded\r\nthe privileges of a crowned head. After much pretended sorrow and\r\nrepudiation of any desire for revenge, but at the same time setting forth\r\na careful recapitulation of Mary’s offences, she complained of Parliament\r\nfor passing the Act which made it necessary for her to pronounce sentence\r\nof death on a kinswoman, and said she must take time for prayer and\r\ncontemplation before she could give an answer to the petition. A few\r\ndays afterwards she besought the Houses to consider again whether some\r\nother course could not be adopted instead of executing Mary, but she\r\nwas assured by them that there was “no other sound and assured means”\r\nthan that which they had formerly recommended (18th November). Her next\r\naddress to the Houses was still more hypocritical. After infinite talk\r\nof her mercy, her goodness, and her hatred of bloodshed, even for her\r\nown safety, she ended enigmatically: “Therefore if I should say I would\r\nnot do what you request, it might be peradventure more than I thought,\r\nand to say I would do it might perhaps breed peril of what you labour to\r\npreserve, being more than in your own wisdoms and discretions would seem\r\nconvenient.”[525]\r\n\r\nSeveral days before this, Mary’s sentence had been communicated to her by\r\nLord Buckhurst and Beale. She was dignified and courageous, rejoiced that\r\nshe was to die, as she said, for the Catholic faith, and again affirmed\r\nthat she had taken no part in the plot for the murder of Elizabeth,\r\nwhich was doubtless true so far as active participation or direction was\r\nconcerned. Her letters written immediately afterwards to Mendoza[526]\r\nand the Duke of Guise[527] are conceived in the same spirit, and appear\r\nto entertain no expectation of mercy. The Spaniards, however, were more\r\nhopeful, and ascribed to Burghley a deep scheme for selling Mary’s life\r\nto France, in exchange for concessions to English interests.\r\n\r\nThe arrangements for the invasion of England by a great fleet from\r\nSpain were now so far advanced as to be impossible of concealment, and\r\nthe English Government were actively adopting measures of defence and\r\nreprisal. Under the transparent pretext of aiding Don Antonio, English\r\narmed ships were hounding Spanish commerce from the seas and harrying\r\nSpanish settlements; the English troops under Leicester, and the Scots\r\nunder the Master of Gray, were fighting Spaniards in Holland, and the\r\nEnglish militant Protestant party had now supplanted Burghley’s policy on\r\nall sides. But still the cautious old statesman patiently worked in his\r\nown way to minimise the dangers with which his political opponents had\r\nalready surrounded the Queen. There were two things only that he could\r\ndo, namely, once more to endeavour to disarm Spain by making a show of\r\nfriendship, and to sow discord between France and Spain; and both these\r\nthings he did. One of Ralegh’s privateers had captured Philip’s governor\r\nof Patagonia, the famous explorer and navigator, Sarmiento; and almost\r\nsimultaneously with the passing of Mary’s sentence, Ralegh was invited to\r\nbring his prisoner to Cecil House for a private conference. Sarmiento was\r\nflattered and made much of, and received his free release on condition\r\nof his taking to Spain messages from Burghley and Ralegh suggesting a\r\nfriendly arrangement between the countries. Ralegh, indeed, went so far\r\nas to offer—whether sincerely or not does not affect the question—two of\r\nhis ships for Philip’s service, and for many weeks sympathetic messages\r\nfound their way secretly from the Lord Treasurer and Sir Walter to Spain\r\nand Flanders.[528]\r\n\r\nAt the same time Sir Henry Wotton was sent to Paris with certified copies\r\nof Mary’s will in favour of Philip, and of her correspondence with\r\nMendoza. “He is instructed to point out how much she depended upon your\r\nMajesty, and how shy she was of France.”[529] This was exactly the course\r\nmost likely to alienate Henry III. from Spain and his sister-in-law;\r\nand although he tardily sent Pomponne de Bellièvre to remonstrate with\r\nElizabeth, the Spaniards and Guisans, at all events, never believed\r\nin the sincerity of his protests.[530] Mendoza writes: “Elizabeth has\r\ngiven orders that directly Bellièvre arrives in England the rumour is\r\nto be spread that the Queen of Scots is killed, in order to discover\r\nhow he takes it. Bellièvre, however, is forewarned of it, and has his\r\ninstructions what to say when he hears it. It is a plan of Cecil’s\r\narising out of a desire (as I wrote to your Majesty) to sell to the\r\nFrench on the best terms they can what they do not dream of carrying out.\r\nThe English and French will have no difficulty in agreeing on the point,\r\nbecause the King and his mother are very well pleased that the Queen of\r\nScots should be kept alive, though a prisoner, in order to prevent the\r\nsuccession of your Majesty to the English throne; whilst the English see\r\nplainly that the many advantages accruing to them from keeping the Queen\r\nof Scots a prisoner would change into as many dangers if they made away\r\nwith her.”[531]\r\n\r\nOn the 6th December public proclamation of Mary’s sentence was made in\r\nLondon amidst signs of extravagant rejoicing on the part of the populace.\r\nThe next day Bellièvre delivered a long speech to the Queen, in which\r\nhe made no attempt to deny Mary’s guilt, but appealed to Elizabeth’s\r\nmagnanimity, and proposed guarantees from France to insure Mary’s future\r\nharmlessness. The Queen repeated bitterly her grievances against Mary,\r\nand replied that the life of Mary was incompatible with her own safety;\r\nand Lord Burghley, in a subsequent interview with the Frenchman, repeated\r\nmore emphatically the same idea. Shortly afterwards, at the renewed\r\nrequest of Bellièvre and Chateauneuf, Elizabeth ungraciously consented\r\nto grant a respite of twelve days to Mary to enable the Ambassadors\r\nto communicate with their master. But Henry III. himself was now in a\r\nhopeless condition. “Such is the confusion of the court, the vacillation\r\nof the King, and the jealousy, hatred, and suspicion of the courtiers,\r\nthat decisions are adopted and abandoned at random.… The King is trying\r\nto draw closer to the Queen of England, which is the principal object\r\nof Bellièvre’s mission.”[532] The only reply, therefore, sent to\r\nBellièvre and Chateauneuf from France was a pedantic and wordy appeal\r\nto Elizabeth’s mercy, which must have convinced her that she need fear\r\nnothing from the French.[533]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the first movement of indignation on the part of James\r\nalso, it soon became clear that selfish reasons would confine his action\r\nto protest. This is not altogether to be wondered at. He had been\r\ninformed that Mary had disinherited him, and told De Courcelles, the\r\nFrench Ambassador, that he knew “she had no more good-will towards him\r\nthan towards the Queen of England.” The Master of Gray, at his side, too,\r\nwas the humble servant of England, and the traitor, Archibald Douglas,\r\nrepresented him in the English court. On pressure from France, however,\r\nJames sent Sir William Keith, another English partisan, to intercede for\r\nhis mother, or at least to induce Elizabeth to delay the execution until\r\na fitting embassy from him might be sent. Elizabeth hectored and stormed\r\nat James’s threatening letters; but when she became calmer she granted\r\nthe twelve days’ respite already referred to. The Master of Gray and\r\nSir Robert Melvil subsequently arrived at the English court and were\r\nequally unsuccessful.[534] Melvil undoubtedly did his best, and Elizabeth\r\nthreatened his life in consequence; but the Master of Gray’s advocacy\r\nwent no further than he knew would please the English Government.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that Elizabeth herself had decided that Mary should\r\ndie, if the execution could be carried out without uniting France\r\nand Spain against her, and especially if she herself could manage to\r\nescape personal opprobrium. Of Lord Burghley’s personal opinion on the\r\nmatter it is extremely difficult to judge. He is generally represented\r\nby historians as being the prime enemy and persecutor of the unhappy\r\nwoman, which he certainly was not. He was a cautious man and took his\r\nstand behind legal forms; but the slightest slackness on his part was\r\nrepresented by Leicester and his friends as a desire to curry favour\r\nwith Mary. He, the Howards, Crofts, and the other conservatives were,\r\nas usual, desirous of staving off the rupture with Spain, but dared not\r\nappear for a moment to favour so unpopular a cause as that of Mary. The\r\ntruth of this view is partly shown by the revelations of Sir Edward\r\nStafford, the English Ambassador in Paris, a great friend of Burghley’s\r\nand a paid agent of Spain. Stafford told Charles Arundell in January that\r\nBurghley had written that Bellièvre had not acted so cleverly as they had\r\nexpected, and if that he (Burghley) had not prompted him he would have\r\ndone worse still. “He was advised to ask for private audience without\r\nChateauneuf, and was closeted with the Queen, who was accompanied by\r\nonly four persons. What passed at the interview was consequently not\r\nknown; but that he (Cecil) could assure him (Stafford) that the Queen of\r\nScotland’s life would be spared, although she would be kept so close that\r\nshe would not be able to carry on her plots as hitherto. This is what I\r\nhave always assured your Majesty was desired by the Queen of England,\r\nas well as the King of France. Cecil also says that, although he has\r\nconstantly shown himself openly against the Queen of Scots, Leicester\r\nand Walsingham, his enemies, had tried to set the Queen against him by\r\nsaying that he was more devoted to the Queen of Scotland than any one.\r\nBut she (Elizabeth) had seen certain papers in her (Mary’s) coffers\r\nthat told greatly against Leicester, and the Queen had told the latter\r\nand Walsingham that they were a pair of knaves, and she saw plainly\r\nnow that, owing to her not having taken the advice of certain good and\r\nloyal subjects of hers, she was in peril of losing her throne and her\r\nlife, by burdening herself with a war which she was unable to carry on.\r\nShe said if she had done her duty as Queen she would have had them both\r\nhanged.”[535]\r\n\r\nBy this and several similar pronouncements it would appear that Burghley,\r\ntrue to his invariable method, was still by indirect and cautious steps\r\nendeavouring to lead the Queen back to the moderate path from which\r\nLeicester, Walsingham, and the militant Protestants had diverted her; and\r\nthat, very far from being the mortal enemy of Mary, he would probably\r\nhave saved her if he could have done it with perfect harmlessness\r\nto himself, and have insured the future security of the Queen and\r\nGovernment. But whilst the Queen was very slowly being influenced by the\r\nCatholics and Conservatives near her, events were precipitated and Mary\r\npaid the last penalty. There is no space in this work to tell in detail\r\nthe obscure and much debated story of the issue of the warrant for Mary’s\r\nexecution;[536] but a summary glance at Burghley’s share in it cannot be\r\nexcluded in any biography of the statesman. Soon after the proclamation\r\nof the sentence (6th December 1586) Elizabeth herself directed Burghley\r\nto draft the warrant for the execution. He did so, and sent for Secretary\r\nDavison—Walsingham being absent from illness—and informed him that as\r\nhe, Burghley, was returning to London, the court then being at Richmond,\r\nhe would leave the draft with Davison that it might be engrossed and\r\npresented to the Queen for signature. When Davison laid the document\r\nbefore the Queen she told him to keep it back for the present. Six weeks\r\npassed without anything more being done, and Leicester in the interval\r\ncomplained to Davison, in Burghley’s presence, of his remissness in not\r\nagain laying the document before the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Master of Gray left London at the end of January, and on the\r\n1st February Lord Admiral Howard told the Queen that there was much\r\ndisquieting talk in the country with regard to attempts to be made for\r\nthe rescue of Mary, &c.[537] Elizabeth then requested Howard to send for\r\nDavison and direct him to lay the warrant before her for signature. The\r\nSecretary accordingly carried the warrant to the Queen, who was full of\r\nsmiles and amiability, and asked him what he had there. Davison told her,\r\nand she signed the warrant, explaining to him whilst doing so, that she\r\nhad hitherto delayed it for the sake of her own reputation. Then, with\r\na joke, she handed the signed warrant back to him, and, according to\r\nDavison, bade him carry it at once to the Lord Chancellor, have it sealed\r\nwith the great seal as privately as possible, and send it away to the\r\nCommissioners, so that she should hear no more about it.\r\n\r\nElizabeth afterwards, however, swore that she had given him no such\r\ninstructions. As he was leaving, Elizabeth directed him to call on\r\nWalsingham, who was confined to his house by illness, and to tell him\r\nwhat had been done. She then spoke bitterly of Amias Paulet for not\r\nhaving made the warrant unnecessary, and hinted to Davison that he\r\nmight write to Paulet again suggesting the poisoning of Mary. This\r\nDavison demurred at doing, as he knew that it would be fruitless, and\r\nhe did not relish the task, but promised to mention it to Walsingham.\r\nThe Secretary’s story is that he went straight to Lord Burghley and\r\nshowed him and Leicester the warrant, repeating the Queen’s directions.\r\nHe then proceeded to Walsingham House; and the result of his visit is\r\nseen in a memorandum (dated the next day, 2nd February) in Walsingham’s\r\nhand, annotated by Lord Burghley, laying down the steps to be taken for\r\nimmediately carrying the warrant into effect.[538] The fullest details,\r\neven for the burial, are set forth, and at the end it is directed that\r\n“the Lords and court are to give out that there will be no execution.”\r\n\r\nThus far Davison’s statement has been followed; but there is at Hatfield\r\n(part iii., No. 472) a rough draft in Lord Burghley’s handwriting, which,\r\nin view of the date upon it, 2nd February, throws rather a new light\r\nupon the matter, and proves that, unknown to Davison, Lord Burghley and\r\nthe rest of the Council were accomplices of the Queen in her intention\r\nof subsequently repudiating her orders and ruining her Secretary, and\r\nthat the tragi-comedy was not played by Elizabeth alone, but by her grave\r\nCouncillors as well. The draft document is in the name of the Council,\r\nand sets forth the reasons that had moved them to despatch the warrant\r\nwithout further consulting the Queen; “_and yet we are now at this time\r\nmost sorry to understand that your Majesty is so greatly grieved with\r\nthis kind of proceeding, and do most humbly beseech your Majesty_,” &c.\r\nThis, be it remembered, is dated the 2nd February, before the warrant had\r\nbeen sent off or the Queen even knew it had been sealed.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning of the 2nd the Queen sent Killigrew to Davison,\r\ndirecting him not to go to the Lord Chancellor until he had seen her.\r\nWhen he entered her presence she asked him, to his surprise, whether\r\nhe had had the warrant sealed, and he informed her that he had. Why so\r\nmuch haste? she asked; to which he replied that she had told him to use\r\ndespatch. He then inquired if she wished the warrant executed. Yes,\r\nshe said; but she did not like the form of it, for it threw all the\r\nresponsibility upon her, and again suggested poison as the best way out\r\nof her difficulty.\r\n\r\nAll this made Davison suspicious, and he went to Hatton and told him\r\nthat he feared the intention was subsequently to disavow him. He would,\r\nhe said, take no more responsibility, but would go at once to Lord\r\nBurghley. This he did, and the latter summoned the Privy Council for\r\nnext day; whilst he, Burghley, busied himself in drafting the letters to\r\nthe Commissioners, the Earls of Kent and Shrewsbury. The next morning\r\n(3rd February) the Council met in Lord Burghley’s room, and the Lord\r\nTreasurer laid the whole matter before them, repeating Davison’s story,\r\nand recommending that the warrant should be despatched without further\r\nreference to the Queen. This was agreed to, and the instructions\r\nand warrant were sent the same night (Friday, 3rd February) to the\r\nCommissioners, Burghley himself handing the document to Beale to carry\r\ndown into the country.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when Davison entered the Queen’s room at Greenwich\r\nshe was chatting with Ralegh, and told the Secretary that she had\r\ndreamed the previous night that the Queen of Scots was executed, which\r\nmade her very angry. It was a good thing, she said, that Davison was\r\nnot near her at the time. This frightened Davison, and he asked her\r\nwhether she really did not wish the warrant executed. With an oath\r\nshe said she did, but again repeated what she had said the previous\r\nday about the responsibility, and “another way of doing it.” A day or\r\nso afterwards, Davison informed the Queen that Paulet had indignantly\r\nrefused Walsingham’s suggestion to poison Mary, whereupon she broke into\r\ncomplaints of the “daintiness of these precise fellows,” and violently\r\ndenounced people who professed to love and defend her, but threw all\r\nresponsibility upon her.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th February the tragedy of Fotheringay was consummated, and in\r\nthe afternoon of the 9th young Talbot brought the news to London. Lord\r\nBurghley at once summoned Davison, and after consulting with Hatton and\r\nothers, it was decided not to tell the Queen suddenly. When she learnt\r\nit later in the day the well-prepared blow fell upon Davison. The Queen\r\npretended to be infuriated, swore that she had never intended to have the\r\nwarrant divulged, and whilst blaming all the Councillors,[539] threw\r\nmost of the onus upon Davison. The Council advised him to retire from\r\ncourt, and he was soon afterwards cast into the Tower and degraded from\r\nhis office. After a long and tedious trial and a painful imprisonment, he\r\nwas condemned to a fine sufficient to ruin him, and thenceforward lived\r\nin poverty and obscurity. The Earl of Essex fought manfully in his favour\r\nwhilst he lived, but Lord Burghley and the rest of the Councillors were\r\ntoo strong for him, and the man they had ruined was never allowed to\r\nraise his head again.[540]\r\n\r\nThat Burghley and the other principal Councillors were parties to the\r\nplot, and that the Queen’s anger with them was assumed, is also seen\r\nby a memorandum in Burghley’s handwriting at Hatfield,[541] dated 17th\r\nFebruary, headed “The State of the Cause _as it ought to be conceived\r\nand reported_ concerning the Execution done upon the Queen of Scots,”\r\nin which the Queen’s version is adopted, and all the blame thrown upon\r\nDavison and the Council. Even before this was written the affair was\r\nso reported to Burghley’s friend Stafford in Paris, in order that this\r\nversion might be spread on the Continent. Charles Arundell, in conveying\r\nthe news from Stafford to Mendoza, says that Burghley was absent through\r\nillness,[542] and that the execution was carried through by Davison, “who\r\nis a terrible heretic,” and the rest of Mary’s enemies. This is perhaps\r\nthe blackest stain that rests upon Burghley’s name. We have seen before\r\nthat he was not generous or magnanimous in his treatment of others when\r\nhis own interests were at stake; and the sacrifice of Davison would\r\nprobably appear to him a very small price to pay for helping Elizabeth\r\nout of a difficult position, and maintaining his own favour.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have seen that the Lord Treasurer from motives of policy had\r\nbeen forced to take a prominent part in the condemnation and execution\r\nof Mary, it cannot be supposed that the position of affairs at the time\r\nwas agreeable to him. The wars in Flanders, the persecution of English\r\nProtestants in Spain, the reprisals of Drake and the privateers, and the\r\nCatholic plots in the interests of Mary had aroused a strong Protestant\r\nwar feeling in the country. Leicester and his friends had the popular\r\nvoice on their side, and Burghley and the Conservatives could only very\r\ncautiously and tentatively endeavour to stay the impetus with which\r\nthe country was rushing towards a national war with the strongest\r\npower in Christendom. The great Armada was in full preparation, and\r\nthe ports of Italy, Flanders, Spain, and Portugal rang with the sound\r\nof arms. Don Antonio once more was welcomed in England, to be used as\r\na stalking-horse, this being Lord Burghley’s last hope of levying war\r\nwithout national responsibility.\r\n\r\nBut though there was much talk about Don Antonio, and Spanish spies in\r\nEngland continued to report that the great fleet under Drake was to be\r\nemployed in his interests, its real object was to render impossible, at\r\nleast for that year, the junction of Philip’s naval forces in Lisbon.\r\nThanks to the efforts of Burghley and his party, an elaborate pretence\r\nwas kept up of the expedition being a private one; but it was really\r\ncontrolled and organised by government officers, and the second in\r\ncommand, Borough, was a Queen’s admiral, sent avowedly to place a check\r\nupon Drake, and to prevent him from going too far in his open attack upon\r\nSpain. Drake’s instructions were “to prevent or withstand any enterprise\r\nas might be attempted against her Highness’s dominions, and especially\r\nby preventing the concentration of Philip’s squadrons;” and he was to\r\ndistress the ships as much as possible, both in the havens themselves\r\nand on the high seas. Drake arrived in Plymouth from the Thames on the\r\n23rd March, and in a week of incessant energy had everything ready. The\r\nsecret of his intentions was well kept, and Mendoza’s many spies could\r\nonly tardily report the loose gossip of the streets. Sir Edward Stafford\r\nassured his Spanish paymaster that no living soul but the Queen and the\r\nLord Treasurer knew what the design was to be.\r\n\r\nLeicester was now at Buxton (April 1587), shortly to start on another\r\nvisit to Flanders, and in his absence Burghley’s influence, both Ralegh\r\nand Hatton being on his side, as well as Crofts and the Catholics,\r\novershadowed that of Walsingham and Knollys. Drake seems to have feared\r\nthe consequence of this, and hurried his departure from Plymouth (2nd\r\nApril). He was only just in time, for as soon as he had gone a courier\r\ncame in hot haste with orders from the Council, which now meant Burghley,\r\nstrictly limiting Drake’s action:[543] “You shall forbear to enter\r\nforcibly into any of the said King’s ports or havens, or to offer any\r\nviolence to any of his towns or shipping within harbour, or to do any act\r\nof hostility on land.”\r\n\r\nThis was exactly what Drake had foreseen. The ship sent after him\r\nwith the orders failed to reach him, and the great seaman went on his\r\nway. But, as usual with Drake, the official drag on the wheel had to\r\nbe overcome. Off Cape St. Vincent, Borough recited to the Admiral the\r\nconditions under which the Queen’s ships accompanied him, evidently\r\nexpecting that he would not confine his operations to preventing the\r\nconcentration of the Spanish squadrons. But Drake was on his own\r\nelement now, and sailed straight to Cadiz, as some people had shrewdly\r\nexpected he meant to do from the first.[544] Borough warned him not to\r\nexceed the Queen’s orders, and was placed under arrest for his pains;\r\nand unopposed, Drake sailed into Cadiz harbour, to the dismay of the\r\nastounded Spaniards. He plundered, burned, and sank all the ships in\r\nport, destroyed the stores, and then quietly sailed out again unmolested.\r\nHe did damage to the extent of a million ducats (though Philip wrote\r\nthat he felt the insolence of the act more than the material damage),\r\nand if he had cared to disobey the Queen’s orders further he might have\r\nstopped the Armada for good by burning the ships in Lisbon, for they had\r\nneither guns nor men on board to protect them. But he knew now that the\r\npeace party in the Council were busy arranging with Parma’s envoy for the\r\nmeeting of a conference, and doubtless thought he had gone far enough in\r\nhis brilliant disobedience.\r\n\r\nThe indispensable Andrea de Looe had arrived in London from the\r\nPrince of Parma immediately after Drake sailed, and was soon deep in\r\nnegotiation with Burghley with the object of arranging a meeting of Peace\r\nCommissioners. When he had returned to Brussels with the proposals, news\r\ncame of Drake’s daring raid. De Looe then wrote a long letter to Burghley\r\n(11th July), pointing out how much the cause of peace was injured by such\r\nacts of aggression. Burghley’s answer[545] (28th July) perfectly defines\r\nhis position towards Drake’s action. After professing the Queen’s desire\r\nfor peace, and readiness to send her Commissioners to Flanders if the\r\nDuke of Parma will suspend hostilities (before the Sluys), he says: “True\r\nit is, and I avow it upon my faith, her Majesty did send a ship expressly\r\nwith a message by letters charging him (Drake) not to show any act of\r\nhostility before he went to Cadiz, which messenger, by contrary winds,\r\ncould never come to the place where he was, but was constrained to come\r\nhome, and hearing of Sir Fras. Drake’s actions, her Majesty commanded\r\nthe party that returned to be punished, but he acquitted himself by oath\r\nof himself and all his company. And so unwitting, yea unwilling, to her\r\nMajesty those actions were committed by Sir Fras. Drake, for the which\r\nher Majesty is greatly offended with him; and now also for bringing home\r\nof a rich ship that came out of the East Indies.”[546] And then, as some\r\ncounterbalance to these enormities, Lord Burghley sets forth once more\r\nthe various grievances of England against Spain.\r\n\r\nWhilst the elaborate and frequently insincere negotiations for peace were\r\nbeing laboriously pursued for many months, Lord Burghley’s other standing\r\npolicy was not neglected, namely, that of causing jealousy between France\r\nand Spain. Henry III. was now in mortal fear of Guise, and was ready to\r\nlisten to English and Huguenot suggestions that Philip’s conquest of\r\nEngland would be followed by a Guisan dynasty under Spanish patronage in\r\nFrance. All the French influence at the Vatican was exercised to procure\r\nthe conversion of James Stuart and the opposition of Spanish aims, and\r\nbefore the end of the year Lord Burghley had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthat Henry III. and his clever mother in no case would aid Philip to\r\nsubjugate England.\r\n\r\nElizabeth, in the meanwhile, was assailed by doubts and fears, and\r\nperiodical fits of penuriousness in the midst of her danger, which drove\r\nher Councillors to despair. Stafford told Mendoza that “Cecil writes that\r\nthe Queen is so peevish and discontented that it was feared she would\r\nnot live long. Her temper is so bad that no Councillor dares to mention\r\nbusiness to her, and when even he (Cecil) did so, she had told him that\r\nshe had been strong enough to lift him out of the dirt, and was able\r\nto cast him down again. He (Cecil) was of opinion that the Councillors\r\nmight be divided into three classes—those who wished to come to terms\r\nwith Spain, those who desired a close friendship with France, and those\r\nwho wanted to stand aloof from both, whilst enriching themselves with\r\nplunder. He (Cecil) was neither a Spaniard nor a Frenchman, but wished\r\nthe Queen to be friendly with both powers. King Henry, under whom the\r\ncountry was powerful and tranquil, thought he was doing a great thing\r\nwhen he was able to make war with France when he had an alliance with\r\nSpain; and now it happened that the French were as desirous of being\r\nfriendly as the English were, and he urges the Ambassador to hasten the\r\nconclusion of an agreement.”[547]\r\n\r\nBut whilst he was writing amiably for the French, he took care, on the\r\nother hand, to make the most of the peace negotiations with Spain, and\r\nthus to cause Henry to be the more anxious for England’s friendship. The\r\nold statesman was thus cautiously and slowly going on his traditional\r\nway, hopeless though he must have been of the final result as regarded\r\nkeeping peace with Spain. The long-continued preparations of the Armada\r\nwere rapidly approaching completion; the Pope had been cajoled into\r\npromising funds unwillingly to aid Philip’s aims; the English Catholic\r\nrefugees were eagerly awaiting the harvest of their efforts; the great,\r\ncumbrous machine for crushing England was already in motion, and no\r\nefforts of diplomacy could stop it.\r\n\r\nBut yet Burghley did his best. The war and plunder party, as usual,\r\nchecked him at every turn; but early and late, through constant pain and\r\nsickness, family trouble[548] and public disappointment, he struggled\r\non in the way he had marked out for himself so many years before—to\r\ndivide England’s possible enemies, and keep the peace with Spain so long\r\nas was humanly possible. The Queen was full of qualms and misgivings;\r\nswaying now to one side, now to another, and abusing in turn both the\r\nparty of peace and the advocates of war. “The Queen has been scolding\r\nthe Lord Treasurer greatly for the last few days, for having neglected\r\nto disburse money for the fleet,” wrote a Spanish spy in November; and a\r\nfew days afterwards, when she was alarmed at the delay in Parma’s reply,\r\nshe flew into a tremendous rage with Burghley, “upon whom she heaped a\r\nthousand insults,” for having induced her to negotiate for peace whilst\r\nthe enemy completed his preparations. “She told the Treasurer he was old\r\nand doting; to which he replied that he knew he was old, and would gladly\r\nretire to a church to pray for her.” But the old minister gave the Queen\r\nas good as she brought, and in vigorous words pointed out in detail that\r\nher present dangers arose entirely from her neglect of his advice and the\r\nimprudence of his opponents in the Council.[549] But the next day came\r\nParma’s answer, and the Queen was all smiles again towards Burghley and\r\nthe peacemakers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n1588-1593\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the tedious negotiations with Parma were dragging on, no slackness\r\nwas visible in the preparations for resisting the attack on England.\r\nDrake was sent to the mouth of the Channel with a fine squadron of ships,\r\nwhilst the Lord Admiral’s fleet was being put in readiness in the Thames\r\nwith all haste; and Ralegh in Devonshire, Hunsdon in the north, and Lord\r\nGrey and Sir John Norris in the home counties, were busily organising\r\nthe land forces. As usual, upon Lord Burghley rested much of the labour\r\nand responsibility, and to him matters great and small were referred for\r\ndecision.[550] The English preparations met with many difficulties. The\r\nQueen was fractious and fickle, one day hectoring and threatening, and\r\nthe next cursing Walsingham and his gang, who had drawn her into this\r\nstrait, and were for ever pestering her for money, which she doled out as\r\nsparingly as possible. There was, moreover, no great alacrity shown at\r\nfirst by the people at large in providing special funds to meet the great\r\nnational emergency, and the trading classes were grumbling at Leicester\r\nand the greedy gentlemen whose piracy was largely responsible for the\r\ncoming war.\r\n\r\nThe sending of Peace Commissioners to Parma was, as usual, the subject\r\nof division in the Council, Burghley naturally advocating the pacific\r\npolicy, and Leicester, Walsingham, and Paulet violently opposing the\r\nnegotiations except on impossible terms. The Queen wavered constantly,\r\nbut was more frequently on the side of peace. Soon after Leicester\r\nreturned from Holland (January 1588) he opposed in the Council the\r\nsending of Commissioners. A comedy was played the same night before the\r\nQueen and court, and as the company rose, Elizabeth turned upon Leicester\r\nin a great rage and told him she _must_ make peace with Spain at any\r\ncost. “If my ships are lost,” she said, “nothing can save me.” Leicester\r\ntried to tranquillise her by talking about Drake; but she replied that\r\nall he did was to irritate the enemy to her detriment.[551]\r\n\r\nThe instructions to the Peace Commissioners, as drafted by Burghley,[552]\r\nseem to be an honest attempt to come to terms. England was to pledge\r\nherself not to send aid of any sort, to the prejudice of Philip, to\r\nany of the dominions he had inherited (thus excluding Portugal), and\r\nPhilip was asked, at least, to bind himself to prevent the molestation\r\nby the Inquisition of English mariners on board their ships in Spanish\r\nports. But side by side with this there is reason to believe that Lord\r\nBurghley, probably through Crofts, endeavoured to gain the Duke of Parma\r\npersonally to the side of peace.[553] He had been badly treated by Philip\r\nin the matter of Portugal, and was still in the dark as to the King’s\r\nreal intentions. He was liable to dismissal at any moment; he was short\r\nof money, and chafing at the inexplicable delay of the Armada. It was\r\nsuggested that a condition of the peace might be to give him fixity of\r\ntenure of his government of Flanders for life. How far these approaches\r\nmay have influenced him it is at present difficult to say, but he\r\ncertainly appealed to Philip earnestly and solemnly to allow him to make\r\npeace,[554] and when the Armada finally appeared in the Channel he did\r\nnothing to falsify his own prediction of the disaster which awaited it.\r\n\r\nThe English Commissioners[555] embarked for Ostend (a town in\r\nEnglish-Dutch occupation) in March, but one of them, Crofts, a Spanish\r\nagent, made no hesitation of landing in Philip’s town of Dunkirk and\r\nproceeding overland to Ostend. After infinite bickering as to the place\r\nof meeting, the preliminary conferences were held in a tent between\r\nOstend and Nieuport; but on questions of procedure and powers the\r\nnegotiations were delayed until the Armada had sailed from Lisbon, and\r\nPhilip’s pretence could be kept up no longer, when the Commissioners\r\nhurriedly returned. Crofts’ desire to serve his Spanish paymasters,\r\nand to obtain peace at any price, caused him to go beyond his public\r\ninstructions in making concessions, and at the instance of Leicester he\r\nwas cast into the Tower on his return; but the rest of the Commissioners\r\nacknowledged that they had been tricked, and that Philip had never\r\nintended peace. Many persons had thought so from the first, though the\r\ndelay had been advantageous for England. The Lord Admiral, writing to\r\nWalsingham before the Commissioners left England, says: “There never\r\nwas since England was England such a stratagem and mask made to deceive\r\nEngland, withal, as this is of the treaty of peace. I pray God we have\r\nnot cause to remember one thing that was made of the Scots by the\r\nEnglishmen; that we do not curse for this a long grey beard with a white\r\nhead, witless, that will make all the world think us heartless. You know\r\nwhom I mean.”[556]\r\n\r\nThough Burghley had struggled for thirty years to maintain peace with\r\nSpain, when war was inevitable he took far more than his share of the\r\nlabour of organising it. As usual, he worked early and late, sometimes\r\nalmost in despair at the Queen’s penuriousness and irritability, and\r\nhimself suffering incessantly. Whilst he was still striving for peace\r\n(10th April) he thus writes to Walsingham: “I cannot express my pain,\r\nnewly increased in all my left arm. My spirits are even now so extenuated\r\nas I have no mind towards anything but to groan with my pain.… Surely,\r\nsir, as God will be best pleased with peace, so in nothing can her\r\nMajesty content her realm better than in procuring it.… So forced\r\nwith pain, even from my arm to my heart, I end.”[557] In the midst of\r\nthe preparations, when Howard, Winter, Drake, and Hawkins were daily\r\nwriting reports or requests to the over-burdened Lord Treasurer, his\r\nfavourite but unfortunate daughter, Lady Oxford, died. In his diary he\r\nsimply records the fact in the words, “Anna Comitissa Oxoniæ, filia mia\r\ncharissima, obiit in Do. Greenwici et 25, Sepult. Westminster;”[558] but\r\nthe bereaved father was in a few days hard at work again, though still\r\nconfined to his bed.[559]\r\n\r\nAt length, on the 30th July (N.S.), the long looked for Armada appeared\r\nin the Channel. The story of how the sceptre of the sea passed to England\r\nduring the next week has often been told elsewhere, and need not be\r\nhere repeated; but Burghley’s share of the glory at least must not go\r\nunrecorded. We have seen how the details of organisation were largely\r\nleft in his hands; but, in addition to this, like other great nobles,\r\nhe raised a special force, clothed in his colours, and maintained at\r\nhis expense,[560] and visited the army encamped at Tilbury, “where,”\r\nsays Leicester, “I made a fair show for my Lord Treasurer, who came\r\nfrom London to see us.” It is usually asserted also that his two sons,\r\nSir Thomas and Sir Robert, joined the English fleet, like so many other\r\ngentlemen of rank; and although this may be true, for certainly Sir\r\nRobert was at Dover,[561] and might perhaps have gone on board one of the\r\nships, it is questionable, and their names do not appear in any of the\r\nrecords as being present.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly to be supposed that the Spaniards would so readily submit\r\nto defeat as not to renew the attack, for Englishmen had not yet gauged\r\nthe paralysing effect of Philip’s system upon his subjects, and, like the\r\nrest of the world, took Spain largely on trust; but Burghley was right in\r\nhis forecast that the Armada itself was so broken and weak that it would\r\nrun round Ireland and return no more. When the heroics in England were\r\nover and matters were settling down, there was still no cessation in the\r\nwork of the Lord Treasurer. There were intricate victualling accounts to\r\nbe laboriously calculated in perplexing Roman numerals;[562] there were\r\nwages to be paid; captains and admirals to be brought to book for every\r\nitem of their expenditure, for the Queen would have no slackness in that\r\nrespect, even though the country and herself had been rescued from a\r\ngreat peril; there were prisoners to interrogate, and plans to be made\r\nfor future defence, and, as usual, Puritans and prelates to be appeased\r\nand reconciled. The lion’s share of all this fell to the gouty, crippled\r\nold man with the bright eyes, the grave face, and the snowy hair—to Lord\r\nTreasurer Burghley.\r\n\r\nShortly after the disappearance of the Armada, Leicester died (4th\r\nSeptember), on his way to Kenilworth, and Burghley lost the political\r\nrival who had continued to thwart him for nearly thirty years. Nothing\r\nproves more clearly Burghley’s consummate prudence and tact than the\r\nfact that, to the very last, his relations with the Earl were always\r\noutwardly polite, and even friendly.[563] That this was not owing to the\r\nforbearance of Leicester is seen by his violent quarrels with Sussex,\r\nArundel, Ormonde, Heneage, Ralegh, and others who crossed his path.\r\n\r\nThe death of Leicester, together with that of Sir Walter Mildmay, which\r\nhappened shortly afterwards, changed the balance of Elizabeth’s Council.\r\nThe old ministers were dropping off one by one and giving place to\r\nyounger men, who could not expect to exercise over the experienced and\r\nmature ruler the same influence as that of her earlier advisers. In\r\norder to strengthen his party Lord Burghley had patronised Ralegh; but\r\nLeicester had retorted by bringing forward his young stepson Essex, whom\r\nhis dying father had left as a solemn charge to Burghley. Essex was a\r\nmere lad of twenty-two when Leicester died, and as yet too young to head\r\na party against the aged minister; but he had absorbed all the traditions\r\nof the dead favourite, and henceforward thwarted the Cecils to the best\r\nof his power with all the persistence of Leicester, but with a haughty\r\nincautiousness which belonged to himself alone, and ultimately led him to\r\nhis tragic death.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the crushing blow that Spanish power had received,\r\nEnglish public feeling continued apprehensive and nervous. Spies abroad\r\nstill sent alarmist reports of Philip’s future plans, and few Englishmen\r\nhad yet realised how completely their foe was disabled. When Parliament\r\nmet, therefore, in February (1589), the largest subsidies ever voted were\r\ngranted for the defence of the country, and the Houses petitioned her\r\nMajesty “to denounce open war against the King of Spain.”\r\n\r\nThere were, however, other ways of crippling the foe more acceptable both\r\nto the Queen and her principal minister. Since 1581 Elizabeth had been\r\nplaying fast and loose with Don Antonio, the claimant to the crown of\r\nPortugal. Leicester and Walsingham had more than once encouraged him to\r\nspend large sums of money in England—raised on the sale or security of\r\nhis jewels—in fitting out naval expeditions in his favour, but nothing\r\neffectual had been done for his cause. Catharine de Medici, on the other\r\nhand, had countenanced the despatch of two fine expeditions from France\r\nto the Azores, both of which had been disastrously defeated; and in\r\nthe Armada year Antonio again came to England to seek for aid against\r\nthe common enemy. He was sanguine, and ready to promise anything for\r\nimmediate aid. Just before the Armada arrived, the plan of diverting\r\nPhilip’s forces by an attack on Portugal had been broached by the Lord\r\nAdmiral in a letter to Walsingham, but the Queen would not then hear of\r\nany of her ships being sent away.\r\n\r\nIn September, however, circumstances had changed. It was useless to\r\nask the Queen to accept the whole expense and responsibility of an\r\nexpedition; but in September 1588, Antonio saw Lord Burghley, who wrote\r\ndown the plans and offers he made. If, said the pretender, he could once\r\nland in Portugal with a sufficient force, all the country would rise in\r\nhis favour; and his suggestion, supported by Sir John Norris and Sir\r\nFrancis Drake, was to form a joint-stock undertaking with the countenance\r\nand help of the Queen and the Dutch, for the purpose of invading and\r\ncapturing Portugal in his interest. In exchange he promised to pay the\r\nsoldiers, and handsomely; to allow them to loot Spanish property in\r\nLisbon; and, above all, to burn Philip’s ships in Lisbon and Seville, and\r\nrecoup the adventurers their expenditure with a large bonus.[564] If war\r\nwere to be made at all, this was a method of making it likely to find\r\nfavour in the eyes of the Queen and Burghley; and in February 1589[565] a\r\nwarrant was issued authorising the expedition, and appointing rules for\r\nits government. Drake was to command at sea, and Norris by land, and the\r\nobjects are carefully set forth in Burghley’s words: “first, to distress\r\nthe King of Spain’s ships; second, to obtain possession of the Azores in\r\norder to intercept the treasure ships; and third, to assist Don Antonio\r\nto recover the kingdom of Portugal if it shall be found that the public\r\nvoice be favourable to him.”\r\n\r\nThe Queen contributed £20,000 and seven ships of the navy, and strict\r\nconditions were made that her money should not be wasted. But the\r\naffair was mismanaged from the first. Most of the men who went were\r\nidle vagabonds, the scum of the towns and the sweepings of the jails.\r\nThe Dutch contingent fell away, the promises of support in England were\r\nnot kept, money ran short, and the victuals went bad. The Queen lost\r\nher temper and began to frown upon the expedition when Drake’s constant\r\ndemands for further help became too pressing; but finally, after weeks\r\nof galling delay, through bad weather and other causes, the expedition\r\nput to sea (13th April), nearly 200 sail of all sorts, with 20,000\r\nmen. Shortly before it left, the Earl of Essex, with his brother and\r\nother gentlemen, had fled to Plymouth in disguise, shipped on board the\r\n_Swiftsure_ and put to sea.[566] The Queen had specially refused him\r\npermission to accompany the expedition; and when she found that her\r\nfavourite had disobeyed her, her fury knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nFrom that hour the expedition and commanders got nothing but ill words\r\nfrom her. Not content simply to burn the few ships in Coruña, the\r\ncommanders lost a precious fortnight, in direct violation to orders, in\r\nbesieging the place and burning the lower town. Wine was found in plenty,\r\nand excess incapacitated the greater part of the Englishmen; pestilence\r\nand desertion worked havoc in their ranks, and subsequently, as a\r\ncrowning disaster, Norris, persuaded by Antonio against Drake’s advice,\r\nmarched overland from Peniche to Lisbon, instead of forcing the Tagus.\r\n\r\nBut Antonio had been deceived. None but a few country people joined him;\r\nthe Portuguese in Lisbon were utterly cowed by the firmness and severity\r\nof the Archduke Albert and his few Spaniards, and Norris had no siege\r\nartillery. After a few days of useless heroism, in which young Essex\r\nshowed himself the brave, rash, generous lad he was, the attempt was\r\nabandoned; and harassed by enemies in flank and rear, beset by famine,\r\nsickness, and panic, Norris, and what was left of his army, beat a\r\nretreat to Cascaes, where Drake and the ships awaited them. The Azores\r\nwere never approached, and the ships in Lisbon and Seville were not\r\nburned, and the inglorious expedition slunk back again to England with a\r\nloss of two-thirds of its number of men.\r\n\r\nAlthough Burghley had drawn up the conditions of the Queen’s aid to\r\nthe expedition, he took no active part in its subsequent organisation,\r\nfor a great sorrow was impending, which fell upon him ten days before\r\nthe expedition sailed. He had lived in harmony and affection with\r\nhis wife for forty-three years, and her death on the 4th April cast\r\nhim for a time into the deepest sorrow.[567] But even in the midst of\r\nhis grief, his passion for placing everything on record led him to\r\nwrite a most interesting series of meditations on his loss, which is\r\nstill extant.[568] Commencing by a reflection on the fruitlessness of\r\nwishing his “dear wife alive again in her mortal body,” he proceeds at\r\ngreat length to lay down the direction his thoughts should take for\r\nconsolation, such as gratitude to God for “His favour in permitting her\r\nto have lived so many years together with me, and to have given her grace\r\nto have the true knowledge of her salvation.” But most of the curious\r\ndocument is occupied by a statement of the liberal anonymous charities\r\nof Lady Burghley, which during her life she had kept inviolably secret,\r\neven from her husband; and as some indication of the reality of Lord\r\nBurghley’s grief, it may be mentioned that he signs the paper “April 9,\r\n1588.[569] Written at Colling’s Lodge by me in sorrow.”\r\n\r\nThrough the whole course of his life we have seen William Cecil pursuing\r\nthe traditional policy of suspicion of France and Scotland, and a desire\r\nto draw closer to the rulers of the Netherlands. But in his old age a\r\nseries of circumstances which were impossible to have been foreseen,\r\nentirely revolutionised the political balance of Europe, and for a time\r\nled even Lord Burghley to reverse his main policy. The heavy yoke of the\r\nGuises, doubly heavy now that they had the power of Spain behind them,\r\nhad at last galled to desperation the vicious Valois who ruled France.\r\nThe long-foretold and carefully-planned blow which had murdered the Duke\r\nof Guise and his brother, and rid Henry of his hard taskmaster, had been\r\nfollowed by a combination of all French Catholicism against the royal\r\nmurderer. The subjects were declared to be absolved from their allegiance\r\nto the King, Paris flew to arms, the Church thundered denunciations,\r\nand the erstwhile royal bigot and monk, the figurehead of the Catholic\r\nLeague, the sleepless persecutor of Protestants, found himself driven\r\ninto the arms of the only subjects he had who were not ready to tear him\r\nto pieces, namely, the Huguenots and excommunicated Henry of Navarre,\r\nthe legitimate heir to the throne. Together they advanced upon Paris to\r\ncrush the Guisan Catholics, and wreak vengeance upon the citizens who had\r\ndeposed their sovereign. Henry of Navarre had often sought and obtained\r\nElizabeth’s help against the Catholics, and looked to her again in this\r\nsupreme struggle which was to decide, as it seemed, the fate of France.\r\nFor the first time, however, on this occasion English aid took the form\r\nof supporting the sovereign against rebels, instead of the reverse.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland also the Catholic nobles had been busy intriguing for the\r\nlanding of a Spanish force, which should coerce or depose James, and\r\nfinally crush Protestantism there.[570] The plan had been discovered,\r\nand Elizabeth, who had again made sure of James, had urged him to\r\nseverity, and offered him support if necessary against his Catholic\r\nnobles. So that in Scotland, as in France, it was Catholicism that\r\nrepresented rebellion, and Protestantism in both countries looked to\r\nEngland to uphold legality. That the position struck Lord Burghley as\r\ncurious is seen in a letter from him to Lord Shrewsbury[571] (16th June).\r\n“The world,” he says, “is become very strange! We Englishmen now daily\r\ndesire the prosperity of a King of France and a King of Scots. We were\r\nwont to aid the subjects oppressed against both these Kings; now we are\r\nmoved to aid both these Kings against their rebellious subjects; and\r\nthough these are contrary effects, yet on our part they proceed from\r\none cause, for that we do is to weaken our enemies.” In another letter\r\nhe says, “Seeing both Kings are enemies to our enemies we have cause to\r\njoin with them.” In fact, once more for a time religious union had become\r\nstronger than national divisions. It was the Protestantism of England,\r\nFrance, Scotland, and Holland, led by Elizabeth, against militant\r\nCatholicism everywhere, championed by the Spanish King.\r\n\r\nSix weeks after the above letter was written the changed position towards\r\nFrance was further accentuated by the murder of Henry III. at the hands\r\nof a fanatic monk in the interests of the Catholics. With the Huguenot\r\nHenry of Navarre as King of France, and with Spain as the power behind\r\nthe League, England and France were pledged to the same cause. The main\r\nsources of distrust in England against France always had been the fear\r\nthat the latter power might dominate Flanders or gain a footing in\r\nScotland. James’s adhesion to the Protestant party, his alliance with\r\nEngland, and his growing hopes of the English succession, had made\r\nthe latter contingency one which might now be disregarded, whilst the\r\npossession of strong places in the Netherlands in English hands, the\r\nreligion of the new King of France, and his need to depend upon England\r\nfor support, rendered it in the highest degree improbable that he would\r\ndream of conquering and holding Spanish Flanders against the wish of\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nFor the last three years Elizabeth had continued to supply Henry of\r\nNavarre with large sums of money to pay mercenaries; but if Henry was to\r\nreign over France he must now fight the League and Spain; and to enable\r\nhim to do this, England would have to subscribe more handsomely than\r\never. Henry accordingly sent Beauvoir la Nocle to London to push his\r\nmaster’s cause. Great quantities of ammunition were shipped to the coast\r\nof Normandy, whither Henry had retired with his army; but men were wanted\r\ntoo, and on the 17th August Beauvoir dined with the Lord Treasurer at\r\nCecil House, and concluded an arrangement by which Elizabeth was to lend\r\n300,000 crowns to pay for German reiters in the spring, and to make a\r\ncash advance to Henry of 70,000 crowns.\r\n\r\nBy a letter from Beauvoir in the following year (16th June 1590) it is\r\nclear that Burghley’s old distrust of the French had not been overcome\r\nwithout difficulty. “At last,” he says, “I have conquered the Lord\r\nTreasurer! Now it must be borne in mind that if the Queen says ‘Do this,’\r\nand Burghley says ‘Do it not,’ it is he who will be obeyed. Still I find\r\nhim easier and more tractable than he was; these are humours that come\r\nand go, like the wind blows. Nevertheless he does well, though he is not\r\none of those who act up to the proverb ‘Quis cito dat, bis dat.’” In the\r\nsame despatch Beauvoir fervently urges the King to keep his promise with\r\nregard to the payment for the ammunition, &c., supplied to him. He says\r\nthat the failure to meet such engagements is called in England “to play\r\nthe Vidame.”[572] “For God’s sake,” he continues, “make provision for\r\npayment, or abandon all hope of getting anything else here except on good\r\nsecurity.”[573]\r\n\r\nHenry’s first attack on Paris failed, and he was forced to retire\r\n(November 1589); but he sent the gallant old hero La Noue to Picardy\r\nto withstand the League there. When young Essex heard of his proximity\r\nhe was anxious to join him.[574] From the first he had been trying to\r\npersuade the Queen to send national forces under his command to aid the\r\nHuguenots, but cautious Burghley was always at hand to hint at expense\r\nand responsibility, and the auxiliary English troops under Willoughby,\r\nnow in Henry’s service, were complaining bitterly of the hardships and\r\npenury they were undergoing. A great fleet also was being fitted out in\r\nSpain, the destination of which was kept secret, but rumours ran that it\r\nwas coming to England, or what was almost as bad, to capture a French\r\nport in the Channel as a naval base from which the invasion of England\r\ncould be effected. Brittany was held by the Duke de Mercœur for the\r\nLeague by Spanish aid, and already (January) overtures had been made by\r\nhim to Philip to occupy a port on the coast.\r\n\r\nBut whether England was to be attacked direct or a Brittany port first\r\ntaken possession of, it behoved Elizabeth to stand on her guard, and on\r\nthe 15th March a great plan for the muster and mobilisation of troops all\r\nover England was issued by the Lord Treasurer.[575] On the day before\r\nthe order was made in England the Huguenot King had gained the great\r\nbattle of Ivry, crushing Mayenne’s army and rapidly beleaguering Paris\r\nagain. For the moment, therefore, Henry was able to hold his own, and\r\nthe apprehension of the English Government was mainly directed towards\r\nBrittany, where a Spanish force of 4000 men were supporting the Duke de\r\nMercœur; and the claim of Philip’s daughter to the duchy, if not to the\r\ncrown of France, was being advanced.\r\n\r\nBurghley’s age was now telling upon him greatly. He had become very deaf,\r\nand almost constant gout kept him crippled; but still he remained, as\r\never, the resource of every one with an appeal to make, a question to\r\nbe decided, or an end to be served.[576] The recent death of Walsingham\r\n(April 1590) left him the only one of the Queen’s early Councillors,\r\nexcept Crofts, who died soon afterwards, and Sir Francis Knollys, whose\r\nfanatical Puritanism and anti-Prelatism still gave much trouble to the\r\nTreasurer. The latter had evidently marked out his brilliant younger\r\nson Robert Cecil for Walsingham’s successor; and certainly no better\r\nchoice could have been made, for he had for some time past relieved\r\nhis father of some of his most laborious work, and had imbibed much of\r\nhis policy and method. The mere hint of such an intention, however,\r\nwas sufficient to arouse the opposition of Essex, who, either out of\r\ngenerosity or in a mere spirit of contradiction of “the Cecils,” took up\r\nthe cause of Davison, and endeavoured to bring him back to office.[577]\r\nThe Lord Treasurer was powerful enough to prevent that; but did not\r\npush the matter to extremes by obtaining the appointment of his own son\r\nuntil some years afterwards, although Robert Cecil was knighted (May\r\n1591) and was sworn a Member of the Privy Council shortly afterwards\r\n(August 1591), and thereafter practically discharged much of the duty of\r\nSecretary of State.[578] Burghley has frequently been blamed for a want\r\nof generosity towards Davison at this juncture. He was, as we have had\r\noccasion to notice more than once, not a generous man; but this was a\r\ncrucial trial of strength between him and young Essex, and if Davison\r\nhad been reappointed Secretary of State the influence of Burghley would\r\nhave suffered irreparably. It was obvious now that Essex was determined,\r\nif possible, to force Elizabeth into an aggressive policy, especially\r\nagainst Spain, and it was exactly this policy which Burghley still\r\ndevoted his life to opposing. But it is clear that the Treasurer did not\r\ngain his point with regard to Davison without some little trouble. Whilst\r\nthe matter was in dispute he pleaded his age and infirmities as a reason\r\nfor his complete retirement from office;[579] and such a hint always\r\nbrought the Queen to her bearings.\r\n\r\nHe, however, absented himself from court and stayed in dudgeon at\r\nTheobalds, where the Queen, to pacify him, paid him a stately visit in\r\nMay, and the notes at Hatfield in the Lord Treasurer’s writing show that\r\non this occasion, as usual, the smallest details of the Queen’s reception\r\nwere arranged by him. Whilst there the Queen appears to have written the\r\nextraordinary jocose letter to “The disconsolate and retired spryte,\r\nthe hermite of Tyboll,” in which, with tedious and affected jocularity,\r\nHatton, in her name, exhorts him to return to the world and his duty. He\r\nmust have done so promptly, for he was with the court at Greenwich again\r\nas busy as ever in a fortnight, writing to Mr. Grimstone, the agent in\r\nFrance, a letter (June), which shows that already the old distrust of\r\nFrench methods was reasserting itself. “In truth, her Majesty findeth\r\nsome lack that the King doth not advertise her more frequently of his\r\nactions and intentions; and especially she findeth it strange that there\r\nis no more care had for the state of Brittany, in that the King sendeth\r\nno greater forces thither to encounter the Spaniards’ new descents, or to\r\nrecover such port towns as be of most moment. And her Majesty is truly\r\ncomforted with certain successes that have happened in Brittany since\r\nthe arrival (there) of Sir John Norreys.”[580] The letter ends with an\r\nemphatic reminder of Henry’s obligations to Elizabeth, and a somewhat\r\ndoubting hope that he will be properly grateful.\r\n\r\nHenry naturally was for winning Paris, the headquarters of the League and\r\nthe capital of his realm, and he was already giving pause to Elizabeth\r\nand Burghley by his willingness to “receive instruction” from priests,\r\nwith a view to his conversion. What from the English point of view was\r\nmost to be feared was that he might at last be forced or cajoled into\r\nconsenting to a partition of France, in which the Infanta’s claim to the\r\nDuchy of Brittany, which was a very strong one, should be acknowledged.\r\nThis would have brought the Spaniards into the Channel opposite England,\r\nand have completely altered the balance of power. Already Don Juan\r\ndel Aguila had a firm grip upon the port of Blavet, and Elizabeth’s\r\nGovernment were pressing Henry to direct his attention to the north of\r\nFrance, where the League had occupied most of the principal ports,\r\nexcept Dieppe. Henry himself was reducing Chartres and other places near\r\nParis, whilst his officers in the north, with inadequate forces, were\r\ndoing their best to recover the coast towns.\r\n\r\nAt the urgent desire of Elizabeth, Henry promised to come to\r\nNormandy,[581] and Essex prevailed upon the Queen to give him command\r\nof a considerable English force to besiege Rouen[582] (July). The young\r\nEarl was in semi-disgrace in consequence of his recent marriage with\r\nWalsingham’s daughter (Sir Philip Sidney’s widow), but the Queen gave\r\nhim strict orders not to expose himself to danger. Henry, however, did\r\nnot keep his word to meet Essex on the coast, and as soon as Essex\r\nlanded, made an attempt to utilise the English force elsewhere. Essex was\r\nindignant, and rushed off to Noyon to remonstrate with Henry.[583] When,\r\nhowever, Rouen was at last besieged, he violated the Queen’s commands and\r\ntook an active part in the siege.[584]\r\n\r\nAt length Elizabeth declared that she would be played with no longer\r\nby him, and he was forced to return to his infuriated mistress,[585]\r\nwhilst the siege of Rouen dragged on for months longer, sometimes in the\r\npresence of Henry himself, until the arrival of Parma and Mayenne caused\r\nit to be abandoned (May 1592). The anger of the Queen with Essex and the\r\nwar-party was increased by the ill success in the autumn (1591) of the\r\nattempt to intercept the Spanish treasure fleet off the Azores;[586] and\r\nfor a time “the Cecils” had their way, which was to administer just so\r\nmuch aid, and no more, as should prevent Maurice of Nassau in Holland and\r\nHenry of Navarre in France from succumbing to the power of Spain, whilst\r\nthe Queen in the meanwhile railed at Navarre for his shiftiness, and at\r\nEssex for his disobedience. Her Englishmen, she said, had been badly\r\ntreated and exposed to undue hardships, her advances were unpaid, nobody\r\nwas grateful to her; and in future she declared, that though Henry might\r\nhave her prayers he should have no more of her money.\r\n\r\nThe determined efforts of Essex and his party, and more especially of\r\nthe two Bacons, Francis and Antony, to wound and discredit the Cecils,\r\nstopped at no inconsistency. From their earliest childhood the Earl and\r\nthe Bacons had been attached to the Puritan party, and still posed as its\r\nchampions; and yet they were the first to endeavour to cast upon Burghley\r\nthe odium of the severe proclamation and fresh persecution of the\r\nseminary priests that had been considered necessary.[587] From the action\r\nof Allen, Persons, and their friends at the time of the Armada, from the\r\nletters intercepted by Burghley disclosing the Jesuit plot in Scotland,\r\nand from the continued bitter writings of Person’s directed against\r\nElizabeth and her minister, it was beyond question now, that whatever may\r\nhave been the case at the beginning of their propaganda, the aim of the\r\nseminarists was simply to undermine and overturn the political government\r\nof the country.[588] And yet the Bacons, nephews of Burghley and sons of\r\na fiercely Puritan mother, prompted by the double spy Standen and men of\r\nthe same evil class, almost violently took up the cause of the persecuted\r\nCatholics when they thought it would injure the kinsman to whom they owed\r\nso much, and his son, of whom they were jealous.[589]\r\n\r\nThe renewed severity against the seminarists at this time was certainly\r\nnot without justification. The shifty James Stuart was again listening\r\nto the charming of his Catholic nobles and the agents of Spain, though\r\ndoubtless with the intention of outwitting them, and from all sides came\r\nthe news of a powerful fleet being prepared in the Spanish ports either\r\nfor England, Scotland, or Ireland. For a time in the autumn of 1592,\r\nwhilst Lord Burghley was accompanying Elizabeth through the southern\r\ncounties,[590] a perfect panic of apprehension fell upon the people;\r\npartly, it must be confessed, caused by the fear of reprisals for the\r\nceaseless ravages of the English upon Spanish shipping. Burghley himself\r\nhad always been opposed to these ravages,[591] and had steadily refused\r\nto accept any share in the profits of them; but when the prizes were\r\nbrought back he took care that the Queen’s share was not forgotten. A\r\ngood instance of this occurred in 1592. Ralegh and the Earl of Cumberland\r\nwith some associates fitted out a powerful expedition to intercept\r\nthe treasure galleons, and, if possible, to raid some of the Spanish\r\nsettlements. When the squadron had sailed, Ralegh was suddenly recalled\r\nby the angry Queen and thrown into the Tower (May) for having married.\r\n\r\nThe _Roebuck_, Ralegh’s own ship, captured off Flores amongst other\r\nprizes the great carrack _Madre de Dios_, which reached Dartmouth on\r\nthe 8th September. The riches she contained were beyond calculation;\r\npearls, amber, musk, and precious stones, tapestries, silks, spices, and\r\ngold formed her cargo. Plunder began long before she reached England,\r\nand when the news came of the capture the great road to the west was\r\ncrowded by Jew dealers, London tradesmen and fine ladies and gentlemen\r\non their way to buy bargains. Ralegh’s sailors were already sulky at the\r\nimprisonment of their beloved master, and when attempts were made by the\r\nshore authorities to recover some of the plunder and prevent further\r\npeculation, they became unmanageable. Sir John Hawkins wrote to Lord\r\nBurghley that Ralegh was the only man who could bring them to order.[592]\r\nBut Ralegh was in the Tower, “the Queen’s poor prisoner”; and it needed\r\nall the Lord Treasurer’s influence, working on Elizabeth’s greed, to\r\nobtain permission for Sir Walter, still under guard, to go down to\r\nDevonshire and set matters straight.[593] Preceding him by a few hours on\r\nthe same errand went Sir Robert Cecil, whose letters to his father on his\r\njourney, detailing the measures he had adopted on the way to intercept\r\nthe plunder, are extremely graphic and interesting.[594]\r\n\r\nSuch depredations upon Spanish shipping as this—and they were of constant\r\noccurrence—although they might enrich the adventurers, and to some extent\r\neven the Queen, were a means of keeping the English people generally\r\nin a constant state of apprehension, and rendering legitimate commerce\r\ndangerous and difficult. As we have seen, Lord Burghley had steadily set\r\nhis face against piracy of all sorts, and Sir Robert Cecil followed his\r\nlead. Ralegh had from his first appearance at court been a friend of the\r\nCecils, as against Leicester and Essex, and he still remained on their\r\nside; but he was greedy and unscrupulous, and certainly from the time of\r\nthe capture of the great carrack the cordiality between the Cecil party\r\nand himself diminished.[595] The talk of the court generally was that\r\nBurghley was jealous of the rise of all men who might compete with his\r\nbeloved son Robert; and Ralegh’s friend Spenser puts the thought in verse\r\n(“The Ruins of Time”) thus:—\r\n\r\n    “O grief of griefs! O gall of all good hearts!\r\n    To see that virtue should despisèd be\r\n    Of him that first was raised for virtuous parts,\r\n    And now broad spreading like an agèd tree,\r\n    Lets none shoot up that nigh him planted be.”\r\n\r\nThat Lord Burghley in his failing age should desire to continue his\r\npolicy through his son was perfectly natural, especially as in his case\r\nthe son was in every way worthy to succeed him; and it is not fair to\r\nblame him for mean filial jealousy to the detriment of Ralegh, as Spenser\r\ndoes, for Ralegh, although nominally his adherent, was in the matter\r\nof the Puritans and aggressive action against Spain, acting rather on\r\nthe side of Essex. It is to this fact that Ralegh owed his lifelong\r\ndisappointment at being excluded from the Privy Council.\r\n\r\nThat Essex and his party were sleepless in their attempts to undermine\r\nthe influence of the Cecils there is abundant evidence to prove.\r\nAmongst many others, an interesting letter from Ralph Lane to Lord\r\nBurghley (March 1592) may be quoted.[596] Sir Thomas Cecil and his\r\nmore brilliant younger brother had quarrelled whilst their father was\r\nstaying in retirement at Theobalds, sick and sorry. “The world speaks\r\nof your Lordship’s grief,” writes Lane, “and thinks it proceeds from\r\nthe differences between your two sons. The matter is not great, but\r\nthe humours short. That which grieves your well-wishers, who are the\r\ntrue well-wishers of her Majesty and the State, is that it has been\r\nmisrepresented to her Majesty so as to injure you for credit and wisdom,\r\nand that these hard constructions made against you to her are the\r\nprincipal cause of your own grief. Good men moan that her Majesty is\r\nsought to be deprived in this dangerous time of so wise and approved\r\na Councillor. I hope that no envy will make her Majesty disconceit a\r\npersonage the choice of whom in the beginning of her reign prognosticated\r\nher future greatness.”\r\n\r\nBut Elizabeth, though she might listen to the youngsters who sought to\r\ncontemn her aged Councillor, knew his worth better than they, and much\r\nas he desired rest, when it came to the pinch, she always refused to let\r\nhim go. Only a few days after the above letter was written, indeed, Lord\r\nBurghley received a life-grant of Rockingham Forest, part of the lands of\r\nthe deceased Lord Chancellor Bromley, as if in answer to the detractions\r\nof his enemies. Another instance of the dependence of the Queen upon him\r\nand of his devotion to his duty happened in June. He had gone to Bath to\r\nseek alleviation from the gout which had afflicted him all the spring,\r\nand writes from there to the Queen, who was on her progress, enclosing\r\nher an important letter from her Ambassador in France. “I would,” he\r\nsays, “have attended your Majesty myself with it, but I am in the midst\r\nof my cure and may not break off without special harm and frustrating my\r\nrecovery, which is promised in a few days. But still I will risk all, and\r\ncome if your Majesty desires it.”[597]\r\n\r\nThe persistent attacks upon Burghley and his policy were not confined to\r\nEssex and the Puritans. The Spanish Jesuit party in Flanders, which in\r\nformer years had often looked upon him with sympathy and sometimes with\r\nhope, now cast upon him the responsibility of everything that happened\r\nin England, even when the policy was dictated by Burghley’s opponents.\r\nIn all the plots of Holt, Yorke, Archer, Cahill, and the rest of the\r\ndesperadoes in Flanders, Burghley was one of the principal objects of\r\nattack. “He was but a blood-sucker,” said Yorke; and the latter swore\r\nhe would lay a poisoned glowing coal in his way and kill him.[598]\r\nBurghley, he said, had poisoned the young Earl of Derby in order to marry\r\nhis grand-daughter to the Earl’s brother. “England was governed by the\r\nMachivellian policy of those who would be kings, and whom it is time were\r\ncut off;”[599] and much more of the same sort. These grosser calumnies\r\nand accusations of corruption[600] were in most cases obviously false,\r\nand could hardly have caused Lord Burghley very deep concern; but the\r\nmost artful of his enemies, Father Persons, well knew the weak point\r\nin his armour, and wounded him to the quick in his books, in which he\r\npretended to show that the Lord Treasurer was of base origin, his father\r\na tavern-keeper, and he himself a bell-ringer.[601] We have seen in a\r\nformer similar case that attacks upon his ancestry almost alone aroused\r\nLord Burghley’s anger; and an anti-Spanish Catholic writing at the time\r\n(January 1593) records how deeply he was pained by the books of Persons\r\nand Verstegen just published, “which,” he says, “will do the Catholics no\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\nThe division, indeed, between the two parties of Catholics was now\r\nwell defined. Those who adhered to Spain and the Jesuits were of\r\ncourse bitterly inimical to moderate statesmen like the Cecils, whose\r\nefforts would naturally tend to bring about a compromise with James\r\nor Arabella Stuart for the Queen’s successor, peace with Spain, and\r\ntoleration for Catholics. The Vatican, the French, the Venetians, and\r\nmany of the English and Scottish Catholics abroad were in favour of this\r\nsolution;[602] and the English Catholic secular clergy were enlisted\r\nalmost entirely on the same side. The extreme parties, however, were\r\nnaturally violently opposed to compromise of any sort; so that the\r\nCecils, as leaders of the peaceful and moderate party, were the target\r\nfor envenomed attacks at the same time both of Spanish Jesuits, who\r\nwished for a purely Catholic England under Spanish auspices, and the\r\nmilitant Protestant party led by Essex, who aimed at a purely Protestant\r\nEngland and an aggressive war with Spain.\r\n\r\nThe bitterness of party feeling was promptly demonstrated at the meeting\r\nof Parliament in February. Intelligence of continued armaments in Spain,\r\nand the recent revelations of informers as to the anti-English plots\r\nhatched in Flanders, had rendered necessary the employment of large sums\r\nfor the national defence. A statement of the apprehensions entertained\r\nwas made in the House of Lords by the Lord Keeper Puckering, and in\r\nthe Commons by Sir Robert Cecil, the substance of both speeches having\r\nbeen previously drafted by Lord Burghley. The patriotism of the members\r\nwas appealed to in fervent terms to provide funds for maintaining the\r\nnational independence. The Puritan party, aided by Ralegh, fanned the\r\nflame and sought to pledge the Houses to an offensive war; and with but\r\nlittle dissent a treble subsidy was voted, payable in four years. Francis\r\nBacon[603] struck a discordant note by asking that the payments should\r\nextend over six years. The people were poor, he said, and hard pressed;\r\ndo not arouse their discontent “and set an evil precedent against\r\nourselves and our posterity.” Sir Robert Cecil somewhat indignantly\r\nanswered his cousin’s speech, and the Queen and Lord Treasurer soon made\r\ntheir displeasure felt, and Francis Bacon could only protest his loyalty\r\nand sorrow for his offence. If only he could wound the Cecils and bring\r\nhimself into the good graces of Essex, he seemed to care but little.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons, as usual, had a strongly Puritan leaven, and the\r\nindefatigable Peter Wentworth once more incurred the Queen’s anger by\r\nbringing forward the succession question. Whilst the Puritan leaders in\r\nthe Commons were being sent to the Tower and the Fleet,[604] the bishops\r\nwere preparing a blow which should demolish for good all attempts at\r\nattacks against the Establishment. A new extreme sect called Independents\r\nor Brownists had gained considerable popularity. Other Nonconformists\r\nresisted the orders of the Church, and opposed the authority of\r\nprelates, but the Brownists were for disestablishment altogether. Their\r\nleaders, Barrow and Greenwood, and several others, were in prison; but\r\ntheir followers were many, and growing in number, and the prelates\r\nwere determined to stamp out this new danger to the Church, come what\r\nmight. Several Brownists were arraigned for sedition, on the ground\r\nthat attacks upon the Establishment were attacks upon the Queen. Barrow\r\nand Greenwood were found guilty, and condemned to death. During the\r\nprosecution the prelates in the Lords had passed a severe bill against\r\nrecusancy, designed to press more hardly against Brownists than even\r\nagainst Catholics. On the 31st March the condemned men were dragged to\r\nTyburn, with all the hideous formalities usual in executions for felony;\r\nand when the ropes were already around their necks, a reprieve suddenly\r\narrived. Lord Burghley himself, though seriously ill, had insisted upon\r\na suspension of the sentence. “No Papist,” he said, “had suffered for\r\nreligion, and Protestants’ blood should not be the first shed, at least\r\nbefore an attempt was made to convince them.” We are told also that he\r\nspoke sharply to the Archbishop (Whitgift). The recusants bill went\r\nto the lower House on the 4th April, and Ralegh amongst others made\r\na vigorous speech against it. The opposition in the Commons, we are\r\ntold,[605] hardened the prelates’ hearts, and both Barrow and Greenwood\r\nsuffered the last penalty two days afterwards, to be followed in their\r\nmartyrdom for Protestant Nonconformity by many others all over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis case has been stated here somewhat at length, because it has become\r\nusual to cast upon Lord Burghley the odium for cruel persecution both\r\nof Catholics and Protestants, in disregard of the fact that there were\r\nin England two extreme parties struggling with each other, he being, so\r\nfar as religion was concerned, a moderator between the two. He was, of\r\ncourse, the most prominent man in the Government, but he only maintained\r\nhis influence by avoiding the extremes of both parties, and in order\r\nto do this he was obliged to refrain from running strongly counter to\r\neither. It may be said that in this case of the Brownists, as well as\r\nthat of the Catholics, he might have firmly put his foot down and have\r\nprevented the sacrifice; but in that event he would not have been William\r\nCecil, Lord Burghley, and he would not have held the tiller of the State\r\nfor forty years.\r\n\r\nIn the summer, Essex received a strange and powerful coadjutor in his\r\npolicy of aggressive war against Spain. He and his friends the Bacons,\r\nmuch to the Puritan Lady Bacon’s concern, were already deep in confidence\r\nwith Standen, and other double spies and professed Catholics, the object\r\napparently being to organise, for the benefit of Essex, a separate spy\r\nsystem, independent of the universal network controlled by the Cecils.\r\nThe new recruit to Essex was a man of a very different calibre to the\r\nother instruments. Antonio Perez, the former all-powerful minister of\r\nPhilip II., was at deadly feud with his master, and had been welcomed at\r\nthe court of France as the bitterest enemy of his native country. He was\r\none of the most brilliant and fascinating scoundrels that ever lived,\r\nand soon won the good graces of the jolly Béarnais, who was already\r\nmeditating what he called the “mortal leap” of going to Mass, and turning\r\nthe Huguenot Navarre into the Catholic King of France, eldest son of the\r\nChurch. He had depended much upon Elizabeth’s help; although of late that\r\nhad been slackening as Essex’s influence waned, and he knew that the step\r\nhe was about to take would turn her full fury upon him. Who could so\r\nplausibly plead his cause and inflame the hearts in England against Spain\r\nas this mordant foe of Philip, who knew every weakness, every secret,\r\nof his former master? So in June, Perez went to England with Henry’s\r\nblessing, and with the cold permission of Elizabeth, for she had no love\r\nfor traitors, and Burghley knew Perez’s errand.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived he found Elizabeth already fuming at Henry’s apostasy,\r\nand complaining bitterly to Beauvoir de Nocle of his master’s\r\ningratitude.[606] She refused absolutely to receive the “Spanish\r\ntraitor,” and the cautious Cecils gave him a wide berth. Essex in some\r\nnotes to Phillips, soon after Perez’s arrival, directs him to set\r\ninformers to work to discover the real reason of the Spaniard’s coming.\r\nLord Burghley, he says, has seen him once, and the Earl of Essex twice.\r\n“Burghley only wished to compare his judgment with his own experience;\r\nbut he (Essex) wished to found upon Perez some action, for all his plots\r\nare to make war offensive rather than defensive.”[607] Essex soon got\r\nover his doubts, and plausible Perez stood with Bacon[608] ever at his\r\nright hand, living at his cost, writing his biting gibes, weaving his\r\nplots against Philip, and with his matchless ability and experience\r\nadvising the young Earl how best to drag England into war with Spain,\r\neven though Henry was a Catholic, and so to outwit the watchful Cecils.\r\nIt was not long, too, before he flattered and wormed himself into the\r\ngood graces of the Queen, who gave him a handsome pension; and so\r\ngradually the war-party gained ground in Elizabeth’s councils, for in\r\nthis Ralegh too was on the side of Essex, and the ceaseless talk of the\r\nintrigues of the Jesuits kept the English war feeling at fever heat.\r\n\r\nMost of the routine work formerly falling upon Lord Burghley was\r\nnow undertaken by his son. Letters from all quarters, and upon all\r\nsubjects, came to Sir Robert, whose diligence must have been almost\r\nas indefatigable as that of his father; but apparently only those of\r\nspecial importance and touching foreign affairs were submitted to the\r\nLord Treasurer. But though Sir Robert might be diligent, he certainly\r\nlacked the high sense of dignity which had always been characteristic of\r\nhis father. At a time when courtiers vied with each other in addressing\r\nalmost blasphemous flattery to the Queen, when all the firmament was\r\nransacked to provide comparisons favourable to her Majesty’s beauty and\r\nwisdom, Lord Burghley, although always respectful and deferential to the\r\nQueen, never sacrificed his dignity to please her.\r\n\r\nThat his son was more of a supple courtier than he, is seen by the\r\naddress penned by him to be delivered to the Queen by a man dressed as\r\na hermit on her entrance to Theobalds, where she passed some days on\r\na visit to the Lord Treasurer, in October. For turgid affectation and\r\ngrovelling humility this production could hardly be excelled by the\r\negregious Simier, or Hatton himself. The subject evidently has reference\r\nto the Queen’s previous visit to the house when Lord Burghley was in\r\ndeep trouble and living in retirement. On that occasion there was much\r\naffected verbosity about the Lord Treasurer as a hermit, and in October\r\n1593, when the pretended hermit addressed her Majesty, he reminded her\r\nthat the last time she came, “his founder, upon a strange conceit to\r\nfeed his own humour, had placed the hermit, contrary to his profession,\r\nin his house, whilst he (Burghley) had retired to the hermit’s poor\r\ncell.” Whilst his founder (Burghley) lived he was assured that he would\r\nnot again dispossess him (as he never turned out tenants) “Only this\r\nperplexeth my soul, and causeth cold blood in every vein, to see the life\r\nof my founder so often in peril, nay, his desire as hasty as his age to\r\ninherit his tomb. But this I hear (which is his greatest comfort), that\r\nwhen his body, being laden with years, oppressed with sickness, having\r\nspent his strength in the public service, desireth to be rid of worldly\r\ncares, even when he is grievously sick and lowest brought, what holds\r\nhim back and ransometh him, is the fear that my young master may wish to\r\nuse my cell. And therefore, hearing of all the country folks I meet, that\r\nyour Majesty doth use him in your service, as in former time you have\r\ndone his father, my founder, and that though his experience and judgment\r\nbe not comparable, yet as report goeth he hath something in him like the\r\nchild of such a parent,” he (the hermit) begs the Queen, whose will is\r\nlaw, to bid Robert Cecil to continue in active life, and leave to the\r\nhermit the cell granted to him by his father.[609]\r\n\r\nThis was doubtless considered at the time a highly ingenious device for\r\nasking the Queen for a reversion of the fathers’ offices for the son,\r\nand is certainly not lacking in the worldly wisdom which looks ahead;\r\nbut surely never was any man’s coming death talked about so much in his\r\nlifetime, and with so little constraint, as that of Lord Burghley.[610]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n1594-1598\r\n\r\n\r\nAll through the year 1593 Lord Burghley’s agents in Spain had sent news\r\nof the powerful naval preparations being made at Pasages, Coruña, and\r\nelsewhere, and the war-party at home and abroad had strained every nerve\r\nto induce the Queen to assume the offensive. Raleigh,[611] Drake, and\r\nHawkins supported Essex in his efforts; but the caution of “the Cecils,”\r\nthe Queen, and the Lord Admiral restrained, as well as might be, the\r\nardour of the forward party.\r\n\r\nThere were, indeed, many elements of danger near home which amply\r\njustified a cautious policy. James Stuart’s extraordinary lenity to the\r\nCatholic lords who had rebelled against him, and his known dallying with\r\nSpain and Rome, again suggested the possibility of a Spanish invasion\r\nof England over the Border, simultaneously with a rising of Catholics\r\nin England. The almost complete control of the coast of Brittany by the\r\nSpaniards, their recent seizure and fortification of a strong position\r\nin Brest harbour, and their continued intrigues in Ireland, all pointed\r\nto the aggressive policy against this country which Philip’s newly\r\nreorganised fleet enabled him to adopt. What would have caused but\r\nmodified alarm to England a few years before, became much more terrible\r\nnow that Henry IV. had become a Catholic and was making peace with the\r\nLeague. Elizabeth and her trusted advisers, therefore, kept Drake and\r\nHawkins at home, and with the exception of sending Frobisher and Norris\r\nin the autumn of 1594 to oust the Spaniards from Brest harbour,[612]\r\nstood on the defensive.\r\n\r\nEssex, often in temporary disgrace with the Queen, headstrong and\r\ninexperienced, was no match in diplomacy for Robert Cecil, fortified by\r\nthe experience and sagacity of his father; but he had enlisted in his\r\nservice some of the cleverest and most unscrupulous spies and agents to\r\naid him. Wherever the Queen had an ambassador, or the Cecils an agent,\r\nEssex also had a man to represent his interest. Every envoy that came\r\nfrom James Stuart or Henry IV. to ask for aid which the Cecils considered\r\nit imprudent to give under the circumstances, was received by Essex\r\nand his friends with open arms; and counter intrigues were carried on\r\nthrough them against the policy of Lord Burghley. In Scotland, Holland,\r\nand France, it was Essex who posed as the friend at the expense of the\r\nCecils.[613]\r\n\r\nIt had been to a considerable extent owing to the diplomacy of Antonio\r\nPerez that Henry IV. had decided to come to terms with the League, in\r\norder that the united forces of France might be opposed to the Spaniards.\r\nIt was now Perez’s secret mission from the French King, with the aid of\r\nEssex, to exacerbate English feeling against Spain nationally, and to\r\npledge Elizabeth to help him against the common enemy, independently of\r\nthe question of religion. This would have been a distinct departure from\r\nthe traditional policy of England, which had usually been to stand aloof\r\nwhilst the two great rivals were fighting; and only the attachment of\r\nthe King of France to the Protestant cause had for a time altered this\r\npolicy. Elizabeth’s interests in France, now that Henry was a Catholic,\r\nwere limited to preventing the permanent establishment of the Spanish\r\npower on the north coast opposite England, and to that end the Cecils\r\ndirected their efforts. This, however, did not satisfy Essex and the\r\nwar-party; and the persistent plots of the English Jesuits in Spain and\r\nFlanders[614] added constant fuel to the flame, which Perez so artfully\r\nfanned from Essex House.[615]\r\n\r\nAn opportunity occurred late in 1593 by which some of the instruments of\r\nthe Cecils might be discredited, and a fresh blow dealt at the policy\r\nof cautious moderation. Many of the Portuguese gentlemen who surrounded\r\nthe pretender, Don Antonio, had for years sold themselves both to\r\nPhilip and to England—and played false to both. It has been seen that\r\nLord Burghley’s network of secret intelligence, under the management of\r\nPhillips, was extremely extensive; and, amongst others, several of these\r\nPortuguese were employed.[616] The most popular physician in London at\r\nthe time was Dr. Ruy Lopez, a Portuguese Jew, the Queen’s physician, who\r\nwas frequently employed by Burghley as an intermediary with the spies,\r\nin order to avert suspicion from them. On several occasions suggestions\r\nhad been made to Philip by these spies of plans to kill the pretender,\r\nand Lopez’s name had been mentioned to the Spanish Government as one who\r\nwould be willing to undertake the task of poisoning him.\r\n\r\nIn 1590 one Andrada had been discovered in an act of treachery against\r\nDon Antonio, and arrested in England, and a letter of his to Mendoza had\r\nbeen intercepted, in which he said that he had won over Lopez to the\r\ncause of Spain. In another letter, not intercepted, he gave particulars\r\nof a proposal of Lopez to bring about peace between England and Spain, if\r\na sum of money was paid to him. Through the influence of Lopez, however,\r\nAndrada was liberated, and sent abroad as a spy in the interests of\r\nEngland. Thenceforward for three years secret correspondence was known,\r\nby Lord Burghley, to be passing between Spanish agents in Flanders and\r\nSpain, and Dr. Lopez, through Andrada and others. The intermediaries\r\nwere all double spies and scoundrels who would have stuck at nothing,\r\nand were so regarded by Lord Burghley; but Lopez was thought to be above\r\nsuspicion, and to be acting solely in English interests. He had, however,\r\nmade an enemy of Essex; and Perez artfully wheedled some admissions\r\nfrom him that he was in communication with Spanish agents about some\r\ngreat plan. In October 1593, Gama, one of the agents, was, at Essex’s\r\nsuggestion, arrested in Lopez’s house and searched. The letters found\r\nupon him were enigmatical, but suspicious. Then another agent named\r\nTinoco, with similar communications and bills of exchange in his pocket\r\nfrom Spanish ministers, was laid by the heels. Essex, prompted by\r\nPerez, was indefatigable in the examination of the men. They lied and\r\nprevaricated—for it is certain that they were paid by both sides; but\r\none of them mentioned Dr. Lopez as being interested in some compromising\r\npapers found upon him, and suddenly on the 30th January the Queen’s\r\nphysician was arrested. He was immediately carried to Cecil House in the\r\nStrand, and there examined by the Lord Treasurer, Sir Robert Cecil, and\r\nEssex.[617]\r\n\r\nHis answers seemed satisfactory to the Cecils, whose agent Lopez was,\r\nbut did not please Essex. The Earl, however, was forestalled by Robert\r\nCecil, who posted off to Hampton Court and assured Elizabeth of the\r\nphysician’s innocence. Whilst he was assuring her that the only ground\r\nfor the accusation—which had now assumed the form of a plot to murder\r\nthe Queen—arose from the Earl’s hatred of Lopez, Essex was endeavouring\r\nto strengthen the proofs against the accused. When the Earl appeared\r\nat court the Queen burst out in a fury against him, called him a rash\r\nand temerarious youth to bring this ruinous accusation of high treason\r\nagainst her trusty servant from sheer malice, and told him that she\r\nknew Lopez was innocent, and her honour was at stake in seeing justice\r\ndone. Gradually, however, the nets closed around the doctor. The Cecils\r\ndid as much as they dared in his favour, but the presumptive evidence\r\nagainst him was too strong. The underlings competed with each other\r\nin the fulness of their confessions against Lopez, in hope of favour\r\nfor themselves; and at length some sort of confession was said to have\r\nbeen wrung from Lopez himself,[618] Robert Cecil, with horror, was\r\nforced to admit his belief that he was guilty,[619] and Lopez and his\r\nfellow-criminals were executed at Tyburn early in June.[620] This,\r\ntogether with the simultaneous declaration of other Spanish Jesuit plots\r\nagainst the Queen, and the activity of Perez’s venomous pen, aroused a\r\nfeeling of perfect fury against Philip and his country.\r\n\r\nAll eyes looked to Drake and the sailors again to punish Spain upon\r\nthe sea. Talk of great expeditions to America, to the Azores, to Spain\r\nitself, ran from mouth to mouth. What had been done with impunity\r\nbefore, might, said the Englishmen, be done again, even though the King\r\nof France had become a Papist and was unworthy of English help. But\r\nthe Queen was in one of her timid moods, and the Cecils held the reins\r\ntightly. Essex remained sulking or in disgrace for the greater part of\r\nthe summer, and, we learn from a letter from Sir Thomas Cecil to his\r\nbrother, only became ostensibly reconciled with the Lord Treasurer in\r\nAugust.\r\n\r\nLittle of the routine business passed through Lord Burghley’s hands now,\r\nthanks to the activity of his son, but we get a glance occasionally at\r\nthe aged minister from friends and foes who visited him. In the latter\r\ncategory we may place the spy Standen, a place-hunter and double traitor,\r\nwho had fastened himself upon Essex, and yet was for ever pestering\r\nBurghley for an appointment. Sometimes the Lord Treasurer pretended to\r\nforget who he was, sometimes he gravely and politely expressed his regret\r\nat his inability to help him; but on one occasion, at least, he let him\r\nknow that as he had joined Essex he must expect nothing from him. Standen\r\nwas hanging about Hampton Court in the spring, and when the Queen had\r\nleft, thinking the Lord Treasurer would be less busy than usual, “he\r\nstepped into his Lordship’s bedchamber, and found him alone sitting by\r\nthe fire.” After some compliments, the place-hunter, for the hundredth\r\ntime, set forth his claims. Burghley replied as before, that Standen was\r\nin England for a long time after his return from abroad without even\r\ncoming to salute him. Standen said he had been ill with ague; “but,”\r\nsaid the minister, “you have been about the court all the winter and\r\nmust have had some good days. And,” he asked, “how is it I have not seen\r\nthe statement the Queen told you to draw up about Spain and to hand to\r\nme?” Standen hemmed and ha’d, but at last had to confess that he had\r\ngiven the statement to Essex for the Queen six months before. “Then my\r\nLord began to start in his chair, and to alter his voice and countenance\r\nfrom a kind of crossing and wayward manner which he hath, into a tune\r\nof choler,”[621] and told the spy that since he had begun with the\r\nEarl of Essex he had better go on with him, and hoped him well of it.\r\nThen angrily telling him some home-truths about his conduct, the Lord\r\nTreasurer dismissed the spy; though for the rest of the great minister’s\r\nlife he was not free from his importunities.\r\n\r\nIt was not often that Lord Burghley thus exhibited anger, even to a man\r\nlike Standen. We seem to know the aged statesman better in the following\r\npathetic little word-picture contained in a letter from his faithful\r\nsecretary, Sir Michael Hicks, to Sir Robert Cecil[622] (27th September):\r\n“My Lord called me to him this evening, and willed me to write to you\r\nin mine own name, to signify to you that the Judge of the Admiralty\r\ncame hither to him a little before supper time, to let him understand\r\nthat he was not furnished with sufficient matter to meet the French\r\nAmbassador, and required five or six days’ further respite … wherewith\r\nhe (Burghley) was well contented … for at the time of his coming to him\r\nhe found himself ill, and not fit to hear and deal in suits, and he doth\r\nso continue. And truly, methinks, he is nothing sprighted, but lying on\r\nhis couch he museth or slumbereth. And being a little before supper at\r\nthe fire, I offered him some letters and other papers, but he was soon\r\nweary of them, and told me he was unfit to hear suits. But I hope a good\r\nnight’s rest will make him better to-morrow.”[623]\r\n\r\nBut though the great statesman was nearing his end, his mind was as\r\nkeen as ever, and his influence was strong enough to prevent Essex from\r\ndragging England into an offensive war with Spain for the benefit of\r\nHenry IV. The Béarnais had still to cope with rebellion in various parts\r\nof his realm, and the Spaniards had secured a firm footing in Picardy\r\nand Brittany; his finances were in the utmost disorder, and against the\r\nadvice of Sully he declared a national war against Philip in January. He\r\nhad clamoured and cajoled in vain for more aid from Elizabeth, and in his\r\npressing need had appealed with more success to the Hollanders.\r\n\r\nThis was the last straw. All the old distrust of the Burghley school\r\nagainst the French revived. The Queen was furious that these ingrate\r\nDutchmen, whom she alone had rescued from the Spanish tyranny, should now\r\ncurry favour with France. They owed her vast sums of money and eternal\r\ngratitude, they had offered her the sovereignty of their States, and yet\r\ninstead of paying their debts and releasing some of her forces occupied\r\nin their service, they must needs seek fresh friends. If possible she was\r\nmore indignant still with Henry; for, as we have seen, one of the two\r\npivots upon which English policy turned was to exclude French influence\r\nin the Low Countries. Thomas Bodley was sent back to the States with\r\nreproaches for their ingratitude, and a peremptory demand that they\r\nshould pay her what they owed her. Before he left England, however, he\r\nalso was gained by Essex, and notwithstanding Burghley’s and the Queen’s\r\nstrict instructions, was far more careful to provide excuses for the\r\nStates than to press them.[624] Henry IV., too, never ceased to declare\r\nthat unless much more English help was sent to him, the north of France\r\nwould slip from his grasp whilst he was busy in the south; and in the\r\nautumn, point was given to his warning by the treacherous surrender of\r\nCambray to the Spaniards. This was a direct danger to England, and Henry\r\nmade the most of it by sending a special envoy to demand fresh English\r\naid. But still Burghley was against violent measures, for a great Spanish\r\nfleet was being fitted out in Galicia, and Tyrone’s rebellion in Ireland\r\nwas being actively promoted by Philip. Defence, as usual, was the first\r\nthought of the Lord Treasurer; and disabled as he was, he drew up in\r\nthe autumn a complete scheme for the protection of the country against\r\ninvasion.[625]\r\n\r\nBut though Elizabeth would not commence offensive warfare against Spain,\r\nshe was induced to listen at last to Drake’s oft-rejected prayer for\r\npermission to raise a powerful privateer squadron to capture prizes\r\nand raid Panama. This was what people wanted. Drake’s name had not\r\nlost its magic, and volunteers joined in thousands, eager for fighting\r\nand loot under the great admiral. The ports of Spain and Portugal were\r\npanic-stricken at the mere prospect of a visit, and if the fleet had\r\nsailed promptly in the spring, Philip might have been crippled again. But\r\nthe Queen and Burghley were still apprehensive, and loath to let Drake\r\nsail too far away. Suddenly on 23rd July four Spanish pinnaces landed\r\n600 soldiers on the Cornish coast, and without resistance they ravaged\r\nand burnt the country round Penzance. It was a mere predatory raid from\r\nthe Brittany coast; but it seemed to justify all Elizabeth’s fears, and,\r\nto Drake’s despair, she forbade him to go direct to Panama. He was,\r\nshe said, to cruise about the Channel and Ireland for a month, then to\r\nintercept any fleet from Spain that might threaten, and finally to lay in\r\nwait for the Spanish treasure flotilla before he crossed the Atlantic.\r\nThe orders doubtless originated from Howard, who was as cautious as\r\nBurghley himself; but Drake and his officers flatly refused to obey them.\r\nThey had, they said, on the Queen’s commission fitted out at vast expense\r\na private fleet for a certain purpose, and it was utterly inappropriate\r\nto the service now demanded of it. The Queen was angry, and, as usual,\r\ncalled upon Burghley to refute the strategical arguments of the sailors,\r\nwhich he did in a learned minute. But it was never sent, for Drake was\r\nobviously in the right, and the Queen was obliged to give way. She made\r\nDrake pledge his honour to be back in England again in the following\r\nMay to fight the new Armada, and, on the 28th August, Drake and Hawkins\r\nsailed out of Plymouth to failure and death.\r\n\r\nAll through the year, with but short intervals of comparative ease, Lord\r\nBurghley remained ill, but manfully determined to perform his duty. His\r\nletters to his son, written, of course, with greater freedom than to\r\nothers, disclose more of his private feelings than we have been able\r\nto see at any earlier period of his career. Both in these letters and\r\nthose of his secretaries the note touched is intense devotion to the\r\npublic service at any cost to his own repose. Maynard writes to Sir\r\nRobert Cecil (23rd December 1594) that the sharp weather had increased\r\nthe Lord Treasurer’s pain. “But for your coming hither his Lordship\r\nsays you shall not need, although you shall hear his amendment is grown\r\nbackward.” A few months later at Theobalds, Clapham sends to Sir Robert\r\nvery unfavourable news of the invalid, and in the following month of\r\nMay we find him confined to his bed at Cecil House in London, suffering\r\ngreatly, and fretting at his inability to go to court. In the autumn he\r\ntells his son that he is obliged to sign his letters with a stamp, “for\r\nwant of a right hand”; but even then he concludes his letter thus—“And\r\nif by your speech with her Majesty she will not mislike to have so bold\r\na person to lodge in her house, I will come as I am (in body not half a\r\nman, but in mind passable) to the muster of the rest of my good Lords,\r\nher Majesty’s Councillors, my good friends.… Upon your answer I will make\r\nno unnecessary delay, by God’s permission.”[626] In the midst of his\r\npain his letters are full of directions upon State matters. In a letter\r\nto Cecil in October, urging the Queen to send prompt reinforcements to\r\nIreland, which apparently she was inclined to neglect, he says, “My\r\naching pains so increase that I am all night sleepless, though not idle\r\nin mind.”[627]\r\n\r\nThat the Lord Treasurer’s bodily weakness and overpowering\r\npolitical influence were recognised elsewhere than in England as a\r\npowerful factor in the international situation, is evident from the\r\ncorrespondence—amongst many others—of the Venetian Ambassador in France.\r\nHenry had gone north, and was besieging La Fère, in Picardy, in the\r\nlate autumn, after the fall of Cambray, and had sent his agent Lomenie\r\nto England to support the efforts of Essex in his favour. But the Earl\r\nwas in semi-disgrace, and the French agent went back with but small\r\npromises of aid. Henry was about to send a stronger envoy, Sancy, but\r\nEssex told him it would be useless, and the clever Béarnais, knowing\r\nbest how to arouse Elizabeth’s jealousy, despatched Sancy to Holland.\r\nThereupon the Venetian Ambassador writes to the Doge: “If Sancy went to\r\nEngland just now he would not find the Queen well disposed towards the\r\npolicy of his Majesty (Henry IV.), not only on the grounds I have so\r\noften explained, but also because she does not approve of the conduct of\r\nthe French ministers. The chief reason, however, is that there reigns a\r\ndivision in the councils of the Queen, and her two principal ministers\r\nare secretly in disaccord. One of these ministers, the Lord Treasurer, is\r\nvery ill-disposed towards the crown of France, and uses all his influence\r\nto prevent the Queen from taking an active part in this direction. There\r\nis a strong suspicion that he has been bought by Spanish gold. The other\r\nnobleman, a prime favourite with the Queen, is of the contrary opinion,\r\nurging that every effort should be made to quench the fire in one’s\r\nneighbour’s house to prevent one’s own from being burnt. The Queen is in\r\nthe greatest perplexity. The Lord Treasurer, in addition to his other\r\narguments, urges the plea of economy, to which women are naturally more\r\ninclined than men. All the same, no efforts are being spared to dispose\r\nher mind, so that should Sancy go to England he may easily obtain all he\r\nasks for.”[628]\r\n\r\nWhen it became evident that Henry was again appealing to the States,\r\nElizabeth was forced to make a counter-move, and decided to send Sir\r\nHenry Unton to offer further English help, if certain French towns,\r\nespecially Calais, were placed in her hands as security. It was clear\r\nthat Henry neither could nor would agree to such terms, and probably\r\nthe Queen and Burghley were quite aware of the fact; but upon Unton’s\r\nembassy Essex founded a regular conspiracy for the purpose of outwitting\r\nthe Cecils and dragging England into war. Antonio Perez had already been\r\nsent back to France in July 1595, self-pitying and lachrymose at leaving\r\nthe luxury of Essex House to follow a camp; but to be received in France\r\nalmost with royal consideration, and to be welcomed once more as the\r\nbosom friend of the King. He betrayed everybody; but his real mission was\r\nto send alarming news to Essex as to Henry’s intentions, in order that\r\nElizabeth might be frightened into an alliance with him to prevent his\r\njoining her enemies against her. Perez thought more of his own discomfort\r\nthan of his English patron’s policy, and had to be brought to book more\r\nthan once. The Earl sent Sir Roger Williams to upbraid him for not making\r\nmatters more lively. “I am doing,” says the Earl, “what I can to push on\r\nwar in England; but you! you! Antonio, what are you doing on that side?”\r\n\r\nBut when Unton went on his mission early in January 1596, a stronger ally\r\nthan Perez was gained. He was entirely in Essex’s interests, and received\r\nsecret instructions from the Earl.[629] Perez and Unton were to work\r\ntogether, of course without the knowledge of Sir Thomas Edmonds, the\r\nregular Ambassador, who was a “Cecil man.” Henry IV. was to be prompted\r\nto feign anger and indignation with England, and threaten to make friends\r\nwith Spain. “He must so use the matter as Unton may send us thundering\r\nletters, whereby he must drive us to propound and to offer.” Perez, too,\r\nwas to keep the game alive by assuring Essex that a treaty was on foot\r\nbetween France and Spain, and to reproach Essex for allowing Unton to be\r\nsent on such an errand as would mortally offend the King.\r\n\r\nBut the Cecils were too clever for Essex and Perez combined. One of\r\nPerez’s secretaries played him false, for which he was afterwards\r\nimprisoned in the Clink by Essex; and it is probable that the threads of\r\nthe intrigue, all through, were in the hands of Burghley. In any case,\r\nthere was no great change in Elizabeth’s policy,[630] and Unton himself\r\ndied in France before his mission was complete (23rd March 1596). Only a\r\nfew days afterwards news reached London that the Spaniards were marching\r\non Calais. This, at all events, was calculated to arouse Elizabeth to\r\naction; and on Easter Sunday 1596 all the church doors in London were\r\nsuddenly closed during service, and there and then a number of the\r\nmen-worshippers pressed for service. They were hurriedly armed and on the\r\nsame night marched to Dover for embarkation under Essex. No sooner were\r\nthe men on board and ready to sail than a counter order came from London.\r\nEssex was frantic, and wrote rash and foolish letters to the Queen and\r\nthe Lord Admiral. He writes to Sir Robert Cecil on the same day: “O! pray\r\nget the order altered. I have written to the Queen in a passion. Pray\r\nplead for me, that I may not be disgraced by any one else commanding\r\nthe succour whilst I have done the work. Pray do not show the Queen my\r\nletter to the Admiral; it is too passionate.”[631] Almost in sight of\r\nEssex, the day after this was written (14th), the citadel of Calais fell\r\ninto the hands of the Spaniards, and Elizabeth found she had overreached\r\nherself.[632] When Unton had asked for Calais as the price of her help,\r\nthe Béarnais had said, with his usual oath, that he would see it in the\r\nhands of the Spaniards first; and for once he had told the truth.\r\n\r\nThe blow to Elizabeth’s policy was undoubtedly a severe one, and a\r\ncounter-stroke had to be delivered. The old project which on several\r\noccasions had been submitted by Howard to the Council for an attack upon\r\nthe shipping in Cadiz harbour, was revived. Essex was all aflame in the\r\nbusiness from the first; but the Queen changed her mind from day to day.\r\n“The Queen,” wrote Reynolds in May,[633] “is daily changing her humour\r\nabout my Lord’s voyage, and was yesterday almost resolute to stay it,\r\nusing very hard words of my Lord’s wilfulness.” Lord Burghley appears\r\nto have been very ill at the time of the preparations;[634] but he was\r\nsufficiently well to secure the appointment of the aged Lord Admiral to\r\nthe joint command of the fleet, to the discontent, and almost despair, of\r\nEssex; and to pen an order from the Queen strictly limiting the objects\r\nof the expedition to the destruction of the Spanish ships manifestly\r\nintended for the invasion of England. The great fleet of 96 sail, with\r\na contingent of 24 sail of Hollanders, left Plymouth on the 5th June,\r\nand on the 20th appeared before the astounded eyes of the citizens of\r\nCadiz. The divided command, and the small experience of actual fighting\r\nat sea of Howard and Essex, was nearly bringing about a disaster to the\r\nEnglish; but at a critical moment Ralegh’s advice was taken. The fleet\r\nsailed boldly into the harbour, and destroyed the shipping first, and\r\nthen captured and sacked the city.\r\n\r\nIt was the greatest blow that had ever been dealt to the power of Spain;\r\nand it proved that Philip’s system was rotten, and that the Spanish\r\npretensions were incapable of being sustained by force of arms. When\r\nEssex came back he found that Sir Robert Cecil had been appointed\r\nSecretary of State (July) in his absence.[635] The Queen was fractious,\r\nand offended that her orders had been exceeded, and above all, that she\r\nhad not received so much booty as she expected; and for a time Essex\r\nwas kept at arm’s length. But now that Cecil had obtained the coveted\r\npost of Secretary, he wisely endeavoured to make friends with Essex, who\r\nhad so bitterly opposed him;[636] and, greatly to the Queen’s delight,\r\na new appearance of cordiality between them was the result. Sir Robert\r\neven brought Ralegh into the circle of grace. He had been for five years\r\nunder the Queen’s frown, but Cadiz had made him friendly with Essex,\r\nand now Cecil and Essex together brought about a reconciliation with\r\nthe Queen. On the 2nd June 1597 Ralegh once more knelt before his royal\r\nmistress, and donned his long-neglected silver armour as captain of the\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nThe sacking of Cadiz had irretrievably ruined Philip’s prestige; but\r\nit had not deprived him of all material resources, heavy and ceaseless\r\nas had been the drain upon his treasury for the war in France. The\r\nIrish chiefs left him no peace from their importunities, and assured\r\nhim again and again that with the aid of a few men the island might be\r\nhis, and Elizabeth and the heretics at his mercy. Promises, sums of\r\nmoney, and slight succour were sent from time to time; but the insult of\r\nCadiz and the exhortations of the Church, at length prevailed upon the\r\nKing to attempt one great effort in Ireland to crush his enemy before\r\nswift approaching death struck him down. We understand now that such a\r\nsystem as his foredoomed to failure any attempt to organise promptly an\r\nefficient naval armament; for penury, peculation, delay, and ineptitude\r\nwere the natural result of the minutest details being jealously retained\r\nin the hands of an overworked hermit hundreds of miles away from the\r\ncentre of activity. But in England the news of his intentions caused far\r\ngreater apprehension than we now know that they deserved; and Essex was\r\nagain all eagerness to take out another fleet, and repeat elsewhere the\r\n_coup_ of Cadiz.\r\n\r\nThis time he found no obstacles raised by the Cecils. In a biography of\r\nLord Burghley, it is not necessary to probe the vexed question of the\r\nsincerity of Sir Robert Cecil’s reconciliation with Essex. Most inquirers\r\nof late years have assumed, with some show of justification, that it\r\nwas from the first a deep-laid plot of Cecil, perhaps with Ralegh’s\r\nco-operation, to ruin the Earl, as in its results it certainly did. But\r\nwithout admitting this, or at least implicating Burghley himself in such\r\na plan,[637] it may fairly be assumed that when Cecil saw how smoothly\r\nthings went for him, and how soon he obtained the Secretaryship when\r\nEssex was absent, he may have welcomed any opportunity of again getting\r\nrid of so turbulent and quarrelsome a colleague.[638] The earl’s pride\r\nand jealousy had also taken from him much of the Queen’s regard, and she\r\nwas determined to humble or to break him. The first project had been to\r\nraise a small expedition under Ralegh and Lord Thomas Howard to intercept\r\nthe Spanish treasure fleets; but when it became known that the Adelantado\r\nof Castile was making ready a fleet of 100 ships and a powerful army in\r\nthe Galician ports, Essex proposed a great enlargement of the plan. He\r\nwas authorised to raise a force of 120 ships, the Dutchmen were induced\r\nto send a strong contingent, and with infinite labour Essex and Ralegh\r\ninduced the Queen to consent to their plan for burning the Spanish fleet,\r\nin port or wherever they could find it, and then to intercept and capture\r\nthe homeward-bound flotillas from the East and West Indies.\r\n\r\nLord Burghley’s attitude is seen by a cordial letter he wrote to Essex\r\nearly in May (State Papers, Domestic). “I thank you,” he says, “for not\r\nreproving my objections for the resolutions for conference. I hope to\r\nsee you at Court to-morrow, if God by over-great pains do not countermand\r\nme. _I like so well to attempt something against our Spanish enemy that I\r\nhope God will prosper the purpose._”\r\n\r\nThe fleets gathered in Plymouth Sound early in July, and sailed in three\r\nfine squadrons under Essex, Thomas Howard, and Ralegh respectively.[639]\r\nOn the day he sailed unsuspecting Essex in the fulness of his heart wrote\r\na fervent letter of thanks to Cecil.[640] He would, he said, never forget\r\nhis kindness whilst he lived; “and if I live to return, I will make you\r\nthink your friendship well professed.” Unfortunately he returned sooner\r\nthan he expected, for the fleets were caught in a storm and driven back\r\nwith much suffering and danger. Famine and sickness broke out, and for a\r\nwhole month the fleets were wind-bound in the Channel, whilst the Queen\r\nbegan to waver about allowing her ships and men to be exposed again so\r\nlate in the season. Once more the aged Lord Treasurer wrote to Essex on\r\nhis return (July 23), “It is not right that I should condole with you\r\nfor your late torment at sea, for I am sure that would but increase your\r\nsorrow, and be no relief to me. I am but as a monoculus, by reason of\r\na flux falling into my left eye; and you see the impediment by my evil\r\nwriting and short letter.… In the time of this disaster I did by common\r\nusage of my morning prayer on the 23rd of every month, in the 107th\r\nPsalm, read these nine verses proper for you to repeat, and especially\r\nsix of them, which I send to you. This letter savours more of divinity.\r\nAs for humanity, I refer you to the joint-letter from the Lord Admiral,\r\nmyself, and my son.”[641]\r\n\r\nEssex and Ralegh posted to London early in August and prayed the Queen\r\nto let them resume their voyage. “Only,” said Essex, “allow me to take\r\nhalf the ships and to do as I please where I like, and I will perform\r\na worthy service.” But the Queen would not hear of such a thing, nor\r\nshould they with her permission enter any Spanish port at all. At last,\r\nas a compromise, she consented to Ralegh’s sending a few fire-ships\r\ninto Ferrol, on condition that Essex was to keep quite away from the\r\nenterprise; and to be sure she should be obeyed, she insisted upon the\r\nsoldiers being left at home. At length, on the 17th August, the truncated\r\nexpedition again sailed. Disaster, jealousy and division dogged it from\r\nthe first. Another great storm drove the squadrons asunder. The winds\r\nprevented them from approaching Ferrol. Ralegh, under a misunderstanding,\r\nattacked Fayal, in the Azores, in the absence of Essex, and the\r\nsycophants around the Earl bred evil blood between them. The main body\r\nof the flotillas from the Indies escaped them; and eventually Essex,\r\nwith his ships battered and disabled, crept into Plymouth at the end\r\nof October, bringing with them hardly sufficient plunder to pay their\r\nexpenses. Fortunately in their absence the Spanish fleet for the invasion\r\nof Ireland had also been driven back and practically destroyed by a\r\nstorm, and all present danger from that quarter had disappeared.\r\n\r\nEssex found that in his absence the Lord Admiral had been made Earl of\r\nNottingham, which, in conjunction with his office, gave him precedence,\r\nand that Secretary Cecil had been made Chancellor of the Duchy of\r\nLancaster. The Earl was furious, and sulked at Wanstead instead of going\r\nto court; but the old Lord Treasurer was once more amiability itself—as\r\nwell he might be, for his son was winning all along the line. On the 9th\r\nNovember he wrote to the Earl, “My writing manifests my sickness. Some of\r\nyour friends say that the cause of your absence is sickness, so I send my\r\nservant to ascertain your health. I wish I could remedy any other cause\r\nof your absence; but writing will do no good. It requires another manner\r\nof remedy, in which you may command my service.”[642] And again, ten days\r\nlater, “I hoped you would have come to court for the fortieth anniversary\r\nof her Majesty’s coronation. I hear, to my sorrow, that you have been\r\nreally sick, but hope you will soon be back at court, where you shall\r\nfind a harvest of business, needful for many heads, wits, and hands.”[643]\r\n\r\nAlthough the young Earl obstinately absented himself from court, he\r\nseems to have sent a letter of thanks and friendship to Lord Burghley;\r\nfor the latter on the 30th November writes expressing his joy at the\r\nEarl’s contentment, but chiding him for his continued absence, which he\r\nsays is exposing him to “diversity of censures.” “I find,” he says, “her\r\nMajesty sharp to such as advise her to that which it were meet for her\r\nto do, and for you to receive. My good Lord, overcome her with yielding\r\nwithout disparagement of your honour, and plead your own cause with your\r\npresence; whereto I will be as serviceable as any friend you have, to\r\nmy power—which is not to run, for lack of good feet, nor to fight, for\r\nlack of good hands, but ready with my heart to command my tongue to do\r\nyou due honour.”[644] At length, probably at the suggestion of Burghley,\r\nthe angry Queen made Essex Earl-Marshal, which gave him precedence over\r\nHoward, and he came back to court sulky and quarrelsome, galled that\r\ncooler heads and keener wits than his could work their will in spite of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the war between France and Spain was wearing itself out.\r\nSince the conversion of Henry IV. matters were gradually working back\r\ninto their natural groove of nationalities instead of faiths. Philip\r\nwas bankrupt in purse, broken in spirit, and already on the brink of\r\nthe grave; but the awful sacrifices his ruined country had made had at\r\nleast prevented France from becoming a Protestant country. He was leaving\r\nFlanders to his beloved daughter Isabel, and wished to bequeath to her\r\npeace as well. By Henry’s treaty with England and the United Provinces\r\ntwo years before he had bound himself to make common cause with them\r\nagainst the King of Spain; but the main cause of his own quarrel with\r\nSpain had nearly disappeared, for the Leaguers were now mostly on his\r\nside, and for a year past the Pope (Clement VIII.) had been busy trying\r\nto bring about a reconciliation between the two great Catholic powers.\r\nThe pontiff assured Henry that he was not bound to keep faith with\r\nheretics, and might break the treaty with Elizabeth and Holland. “I\r\nhave,” replied the Béarnais, “pledged my faith to the Queen of England\r\nand the United Provinces. How could I treat to their detriment, or even\r\nfail in a single point, without betraying my duty, my honour, and my own\r\ninterests? No pretext would excuse such baseness and perfidy, and if it\r\ncould, sooner than avail myself of it I would lose my life.”\r\n\r\nBut when, in the autumn of 1597, the Spaniards were finally routed\r\nat Amiens, it was evident that Spain could fight no longer, and that\r\nthe moment for peace had come. The Archduke, who was to marry the new\r\nsovereign of Flanders, was especially anxious for peace before the\r\nSpanish King died, and at his instance advances to Henry were made.\r\nThis was the last great international question in which Burghley was\r\npersonally interested, and by a curious coincidence it brought once\r\nmore to the front the traditional English policy, of which he was the\r\nrepresentative; a policy which had for many years past been broken and\r\ninterrupted by the religious position on the Continent. The growing power\r\nand ambition of the Dutch United Provinces, and their aid sent to Henry\r\nIV. against Spain, together with Henry’s conversion to Catholicism, had\r\nonce more aroused the fear of England that by an arrangement between them\r\nthe French might dominate Spanish Flanders. The project of making the\r\nInfanta and her husband practically independent sovereigns of the Belgic\r\nprovinces was therefore eminently favourable to English interests, and\r\ndrew England once more irresistibly to the side of Spain, as against the\r\nDutchmen and Henry IV.; for the possession of Flanders by the French (or\r\nnow even by the strong pushing young Republic under French influence) was\r\none of the two eventualities against which for centuries the traditional\r\npolicy of England had been directed. Coincident, therefore, with Henry’s\r\nnegotiations, secret approaches were made by England to the Archduke, and\r\nonce more, after a half-century of fighting, England was smiling as of\r\nold on a “Duke of Burgundy,” as against a French King.[645]\r\n\r\nIn November Henry sent envoys to the States and to England to demand\r\nfurther aid, but with the alternative of a peace conference. The Dutchmen\r\nthought they had been betrayed, and indignantly said so; refusing\r\nabsolutely to make peace with ruined, defeated Spain, except on their\r\nown terms, and in their own time. Elizabeth had far greater reason\r\nthan they for indignation with her ally, and had to be approached more\r\ngently and with greater diplomacy. De Maisse, Henry’s envoy, arrived in\r\nLondon on the 2nd, and was received by the Queen on the 8th December. He\r\nfound the Cecils absolute masters of the Council; for all of Burghley’s\r\npredictions of the falsity of Frenchmen had come true, and his objection\r\nto the treaty of alliance (May 1596) had been more than justified. Essex,\r\nonly just returned to court from his sulky fit at Wanstead, took in\r\nearnest Henry’s demands for reinforcements against Spain, and was all\r\nfor fighting again, whilst Burghley of course understood them to be only\r\na mask for the peace suggestion. The Queen and Burghley were determined\r\nto assume indignation and grievance in order that, in the coming peace,\r\nthey might get the best possible terms for England; indignant, however,\r\nas they might pretend to be, there was nothing they desired more than\r\na pacification that should open all ports to English trade and leave\r\nFlanders in the hands of a modest, moderate sovereign under the guarantee\r\nof Spain. But withal it behoved them to walk warily, for Spain had\r\noutwitted them in the peace negotiations of 1588, and Protestant Holland\r\ncould not be abandoned.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th December De Maisse was received in State by Elizabeth at\r\nWhitehall,[646] whither Lord Burghley was brought in a litter, but Essex\r\nwas still absent. The Queen was enigmatical but polite, and referred\r\nthe envoy to Lord Burghley, with whom he conferred on the 10th, when it\r\nbecame evident that the object of the English was to gain time whilst\r\nother negotiations were proceeding. The Queen exerted all her wiles and\r\nancient coquetry on De Maisse to delay matters, and not without success;\r\nwhilst she inflamed Caron, the envoy of the Dutch States, with hints of\r\nHenry’s desertion and perfidy, in order to embitter French relations with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt length Henry IV. got tired of this buckler play, and De Maisse plainly\r\ntold Elizabeth that the King considered that her delay in giving him\r\na definite answer released him from his pledges under the treaty of\r\nalliance. Again he was referred to Burghley, whom he saw again early in\r\nJanuary. The Queen could not treat with the Archduke, said the Treasurer.\r\nIf her envoys were to attend a peace conference, it could only be with\r\nthe representatives of the King of Spain; besides, he said, the Queen\r\nmust settle with States before she entered into any negotiations at all.\r\nIt was well known to Henry and his minister at this time that brisk\r\nsecret negotiations were being conducted between Elizabeth and the\r\nArchduke; and in a final interview with Burghley on 10th January, De\r\nMaisse gave him an ultimatum. His master must make peace or be supported\r\nin war. Essex was present at the interview; and although the Lord\r\nTreasurer invited him to speak he remained obstinately silent, except to\r\nsay that he did not see how religious dissensions would allow of peace\r\nbeing made with Spain.\r\n\r\nAt length Burghley announced that the Queen would send an embassy to\r\nFrance to settle with Henry the whole question of peace or war, in\r\nconjunction with an embassy from the States. The embassy consisted of Sir\r\nRobert Cecil, Sir Thomas Wilkes, and Dr. Herbert; and the instructions\r\ntaken by them are contained in the last of the important State papers\r\nwritten by the failing hand of the great statesman. The document is a\r\nlong and sagacious one, laying down as an absolute condition of any peace\r\nwith Spain that the United Provinces should be secured from all fear of\r\nfuture attempts to subdue them. An earnest desire for peace breathes all\r\nthrough the document, but it must be a real peace, which acknowledged\r\naccomplished facts, abandoned inflated claims, and recognised the rights\r\nof Protestantism to equal treatment.\r\n\r\nCecil and his companions embarked from Dover on the 17th February,\r\nand on the death of Wilkes in Rouen, the whole burden of the embassy\r\nfell upon the Secretary. It was not until they reached Angers on the\r\n21st that Cecil saw the King. In effect the Béarnais had already made\r\npeace secretly with the Archduke; the States were determined that they\r\nwould give up no tittle of their hard-won independence, and haughtily\r\nrefused even a truce if their rights were not recognised. England dared\r\nnot abandon them, so that Cecil on his interview with Henry could only\r\nreproach him for his desertion of the ally to whom he owed so much. Henry\r\nreplied that his position was such that he could not do otherwise. “I\r\nam,” he said, “like a man clothed in velvet that hath no meat to put in\r\nhis mouth.”[647]\r\n\r\nOn the 28th March Cecil received a letter from his father dated the\r\n1st, which caused him deep alarm. “The bearer,” it said, “will report\r\nto you my great weakness. But do not take any conceit thereby to hinder\r\nyour service; but I must send you a message delivered to me in writing\r\nby Mr. Windebanke. I make no comment, not knowing out of what shop the\r\ntext is come, but in my opinion _non sunt ponendi rumores ante salutem_.\r\nGod bless you in earth and me in heaven, the place of my present\r\npilgrimage.”[648] Cecil unwillingly followed Henry to Nantes on his\r\nhollow errand; but this letter disturbed him, and at the earliest moment\r\nhe took leave of France and returned, although on the way somewhat better\r\nnews reached him. “Mr. Secretary returned the 1st of the month” (May),\r\nsays Chamberlain, “somewhat crazed with his posting journey, the report\r\nof his father’s dangerous state gave him wings; but for aught I can learn\r\nthe old man’s case is not so desperate but he may hold out another year\r\nwell enough.”[649]\r\n\r\nBefore Cecil had left on his mission, greatly against his inclination,\r\nhe had received a promise from Essex that during his absence he would\r\nnot cause any alteration to be made either in policy or court affairs.\r\nThe Earl had been as good as his word, and for a few days after Cecil’s\r\nreturn they were friendly; but when the Peace of Vervins was actually\r\nsigned between Henry and Philip the old feud between the policies of\r\npeace and war broke out again. This was one of those junctures when\r\nFrance and Spain being friendly, it had always been the Burghley policy\r\nto draw closer to the latter power, whilst at the same time fortifying\r\nthose who were opposing her; and this was the course adopted by the\r\nCecils on the present occasion. Francis Vere was sent to Holland with\r\npromises and encouragement for the States to stand firm; whilst the\r\nArchduke in Flanders was secretly informed that the Queen desired peace,\r\nand would enter into negotiations if she were assured that her desires\r\nwere reciprocated. This policy soon alienated Essex and the war-party,\r\nand after one stormy interview on the subject with the dying Lord\r\nTreasurer, the latter handed to the Earl a book of Psalms and silently\r\npointed with his finger to the line, “Bloodthirsty men shall not live\r\nout half their days;” a last prophecy which the Earl’s pride and folly\r\nhastened to fulfil.[650]\r\n\r\nAll the summer the aged minister lingered sick unto death in his palace\r\nin the Strand, sometimes taking the air in a coach or litter, and on two\r\noccasions going as far as Theobalds. During the time his great yearning\r\nwas to bring about a peace before he died between his mistress and\r\nthe old enemy, who, in the bitterness of defeat, was dying too in the\r\nfrowning mountains of the Guadarrama far away. For forty years these two\r\nmen had striven as none ever strove before to maintain peace between\r\nEngland and Spain; and their efforts had been unavailing, for religious\r\ndifferences had for a time obliterated national lines of policy. But\r\nBurghley had had the supreme wisdom of bending before superior force\r\nand adapting his varying means to his unvarying objects. England thus\r\nhad gained, whilst Philip, buoyed up with the fatuous belief in his\r\ndivine power and inspiration, scorning to give way to considerations\r\nof expediency, had been ruined by war and had failed in most of his\r\naims. And yet through the welter of wrong and slaughter, Providence had\r\ndecreed that the objects that both men aimed at should not be utterly\r\ndefeated. The alliance between the countries was needed both by Spain\r\nand England in order that Flanders should not fall into the hands of the\r\nFrench, and this at least had been attained. By England it was required\r\nto counterbalance a possible French domination of Scotland, and this had\r\nceased to be a danger. On the side of Philip had been gained the point\r\nthat France was still a Catholic country; whilst to England it was to be\r\ncredited that Protestantism was now a great force which demanded equality\r\nwith the older form of belief, and, above all, that England was no longer\r\nin the leading strings of France or Spain, but had, in the forty years of\r\ndexterous balance under Elizabeth and Burghley, attained full maturity\r\nand independence, with the consciousness of coming imperial greatness.\r\n\r\nTo say that this was all owing to the management of the Queen and her\r\nminister would be untrue. Circumstances and the faults and shortcomings\r\nof their rivals—nay, their own shortcomings and weaknesses as well—aided\r\nthem powerfully to attain the brilliant success that attended them; but\r\nit may safely be asserted that without a man of Burghley’s peculiar gifts\r\nat her side Elizabeth would at an early period of her reign have lost the\r\nnice balance upon which her safety alone depended.\r\n\r\nIt was curious that the last hours of Burghley should have been occupied\r\nin striving still to bring about peace with Spain, which had been his\r\nobject through life, though he had attained for England already most of\r\nthe political advantages which a peace with Spain might bring; but old\r\nprejudices against France were still as strong as they had been in his\r\nyouth, for, as he had truly foretold, the Béarnais had played them false,\r\nand thenceforward no Frenchman should ever be trusted again. Spain, in\r\nany case, would keep the false Frenchmen out of Flanders; so Spain was\r\nEngland’s friend.\r\n\r\nFor twelve days the Lord Treasurer lay in his bed at Cecil House\r\nbefore he died, suffering but slightly, and resigned, almost eager\r\nfor his coming release. On the evening of the 3rd August he fell into\r\nconvulsions, and when the fit had passed, “Now,” quoth he, “the Lord be\r\npraised, the time is come;” and calling his children, he blessed them\r\nand took his leave, commanding them “to love and fear God, and love one\r\nanother.”[651] Then he prayed for the Queen, handed his will to his\r\nsteward Bellot, turned his face to the wall, and died in the early hours\r\nof the next morning; decorous, self-controlled, and dignified to the last.\r\n\r\nHis death, though long expected, was a blow which the aged Queen felt for\r\nthe rest of her life. She wept, and withdrew herself from all company,\r\nwe are told, when she was informed of her loss;[652] and two years\r\nafterwards Robert Sidney, writing to Sir John Harrington, says, “I do see\r\nthe Queen often; she doth wax weak since last troubles, and Burghley’s\r\ndeath doth often draw tears from her goodly cheeks.”\r\n\r\nEven Essex, who had wrought so much against him, felt the loss the\r\ncountry had sustained. At the splendid funeral in Westminster Abbey[653]\r\non the 29th August, we are told by an eye-witness that “my Lord of\r\nEssex to my judgment did more than ceremoniously show sorrow”;[654] and\r\nChamberlain, writing on the next day, says, “The Lord Treasurer’s funeral\r\nwas performed yesterday with all the rites that belonged to so great a\r\npersonage. The number of mourners were above 500, whereof there were many\r\nnoblemen, and among the rest the Earl of Essex, who (whether it were\r\nupon consideration of the present occasion or for his own disfavours),\r\nmethought, carried the heaviest countenance of the company.”[655]\r\n\r\nThroughout Europe the death of the Lord Treasurer was looked upon as a\r\nloss to the cause of peace. Essex, it was thought, would now hold sway\r\nand launch England upon a policy of warlike adventure. But Essex was\r\nhimself hurrying to his doom; and Robert Cecil held firmly in his hand\r\nthe strings of his great father’s policy—a policy which was on the death\r\nof the Queen to bring a Scottish king to the English throne, and unite\r\nEngland and Spain again in a friendly alliance. The baseness and trickery\r\nthat accompanied the reunion of the countries belong to the history of\r\nthe reign of James, and formed no part of the plan of Lord Burghley or\r\nhis mistress. There was no truckling in their relations with foreign\r\nnations, however powerful they might be, and the servile meanness of the\r\nStuarts in carrying out Lord Burghley’s traditions must be ascribed to\r\ntheir degeneracy rather than to the policy itself.\r\n\r\nOf Lord Burghley’s place amongst great statesmen it may be sufficient\r\nto say that his gifts and qualities were exactly what were needed by\r\nthe circumstances of his times. He was called upon to rule in a time of\r\nradical change, when vehement partisans on one side and the other were\r\nfiercely struggling for the mastery of their opinions. It is precisely\r\nin such times as these that the moderate, tactful, cautious man must in\r\nthe end be called upon to decide between the extremes, and to prevent\r\ncatastrophe by steering a middle course. This throughout his life was the\r\nfunction of William Cecil. His gifts were not of the highest, for he was\r\nnot a constructive statesman or a pioneer of great causes. He often stood\r\nby and saw injustice done by extreme men on one or the other side rather\r\nthan lose his influence by appearing to favour the opposite extreme;\r\nand, as we have seen in his own words, he was quite ready to carry out\r\nas a minister a policy of which as a Councillor he had expressed his\r\ndisapproval. This may not have been high-minded statesmanship, but at\r\nleast it enabled him to keep his hand upon the helm, and sooner or later\r\nto bring the ship of State back to his course again. He was a man whose\r\nobjects and ideals were much higher than his methods, because the latter\r\nbelonged to his own age, whereas the former were based upon broad truths\r\nand great principles, which are eternal. But it may safely be asserted\r\nthat the rectitude of his mind and his great sense of personal dignity\r\nwould prevent him from adopting any course for which warrant could not\r\nbe found, either in the law of the land or what he would regard as\r\noverpowering national expediency. The first cause he served was that of\r\nthe State; the second was William Cecil and his house. Through a long\r\nlife of ceaseless toil and rigid self-control these were the mainsprings\r\nof his activity and devotion. If he was austere in a frivolous court, if\r\nbribes failed to buy him in an age of universal corruption, if he was\r\ncool and judicious amidst general vehemence, it was because the qualities\r\nof his mind and his strict self-schooling enabled him to understand that\r\nhis country might thus be most effectively served, and that it would be\r\nunworthy of William Cecil to act otherwise. The gifts which made him a\r\ngreat minister at a period when moderation was the highest statesmanship,\r\nwould have made him a great judge at any period, and it is in its\r\njudicial aspect that the finest qualities of his mind are discovered.\r\nIt was to the keen casuist who weighed to a scruple every element of a\r\nquestion and saw it on every side; it was to the calm, imperturbable\r\njudge, that from the first hour of her reign Elizabeth looked to save her\r\nagainst herself; and whatever may be said of Cecil’s statesmanship in\r\nits personal aspect, it had the supreme merit of having kept the great\r\nQueen upon the straight path up which she led England from weakness,\r\ndistraction, and dependence, to unity and strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] “Sadler State Papers,” vol. i. p. 375.\r\n\r\n[2] _Memoires sur les affaires d’Angleterre MS._ Bibliothèque Nationale.\r\nColbert, 35.\r\n\r\n[3] Naunton, in _Fragmenta Regalia_, says that he was personally\r\nacquainted with the senior branch of Cecil’s family in Herefordshire,\r\nwhich was of no mean antiquity: but he speaks of David Cecil, the\r\nstatesman’s grandfather, as “being exposed, and sent to the city, as\r\npoor gentlemen used to do their sons, became to be a rich man on London\r\nBridge, and purchased (an estate) in Lincolnshire, where this man (_i.e._\r\nSir William) was born.” Cecil’s enemies in his lifetime, especially\r\nFather Persons, spoke of David Cecil as having been an innkeeper at\r\nStamford; but this is very improbable, though he may well have owned inns\r\nin the town, of which he was an alderman.\r\n\r\n[4] The date of his death in the “journal” at Hatfield is given as 1536,\r\nand Collins states it to have happened in 1541, his will being proved in\r\nthat year.\r\n\r\n[5] Peck, _Desiderata Curiosa_.\r\n\r\n[6] “Courtships of Queen Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\n[7] That Cecil’s father was much displeased at his marriage is seen by a\r\nletter from Alford, his steward, at Burghley, after the death of Richard\r\nCecil. Mrs. Cecil, the widow (to whom Burghley belonged), appears to\r\nhave been an extremely self-willed old lady, and refused to exhibit her\r\nhusband’s will to her son’s agents. In conversation with one of them, she\r\nsaid she knew that her husband had made a will (besides the one in her\r\npossession) touching his goods, when he went to Boulogne (_i.e._ 1544).\r\nAlford says: “Thinking this might have been about the time he conceived\r\ndispleasure against you for your first marriage, I rode off immediately\r\nto the attorney who, according to Mrs. Cecil, held it, in order, if\r\npossible, to learn the contents of the will in your (Cecil’s) interests”\r\n(Alford to Cecil, 9th April 1553; Hatfield Papers).\r\n\r\n[8] Perpetual Calendar MS., Hatfield.\r\n\r\n[9] _Desiderata Curiosa._ This is confirmed by a letter at Hatfield from\r\nGriffin, the Queen’s attorney (27th April 1557), saying, “I am sorry\r\nthat you never were of Gray’s Inne nor can skill of no lawe,” by which\r\nit is clear that Cecil was never called to the bar, and probably never\r\nseriously studied law.\r\n\r\n[10] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[11] Roger Ascham, writing to Sturmius (August 1550), says: “But there\r\nare two English ladies whom I cannot omit to mention.… One is Jane Grey …\r\nthe other Mildred Cooke, who understands and speaks Greek like English,\r\nso that it may be doubted whether she is most happy in the possession\r\nof this surpassing degree of knowledge, or in having for her preceptor\r\nand father Sir Anthony Cooke, whose singular erudition caused him to be\r\njoined with John Cheke in the office of tutor to the King; or finally,\r\nin having become the wife of William Cecil, lately appointed Secretary\r\nof State: a young man, indeed, but mature in wisdom, and so deeply\r\nskilled, both in letters and affairs, and endued with such moderation\r\nin the exercise of public offices, that to him would be awarded, by\r\nthe consenting voice of Englishmen, the fourfold praise attributed to\r\nPericles by his rival Thucydides: ‘To know all that is fitting, to be\r\nable to apply what he knows, to be a lover of his country, and superior\r\nto money.’”\r\n\r\n[12] _Desiderata Curiosa_, and Camden.\r\n\r\n[13] State Papers, Dom., 1547-80.\r\n\r\n[14] _Ibid._, and Tytler.\r\n\r\n[15] December 1547, Lansdowne MSS., 2, 16.\r\n\r\n[16] _Diarium Expeditionis Scoticæ._\r\n\r\n[17] _Desiderata Curiosa._\r\n\r\n[18] This is the assertion made by Nares, but it is very questionably\r\ncorrect, as a letter dated 1st July 1548 from Sir Thomas Smith in\r\nBrussels (State Papers, Foreign) is addressed to Mr. Cecil, Master of\r\nRequests to the Lord Protector’s Grace, and a similar letter from Fisher\r\nat Stamford on the 27th July 1548 bears the same superscripture (State\r\nPapers, Dom.).\r\n\r\n[19] Harl.

The\r\ndocument is entirely written by Cecil, and is a list of fifteen questions\r\nto be put to Somerset in the Tower, all of them of a leading character\r\nand calculated to compromise the prisoner. In Cotton, Vesp. 171, will\r\nbe found the minutes of the Council which discussed the execution of\r\nSomerset.

King … Morysine to say he\r\nhath no more commission but if the Emperor will send a man to England\r\nhe shall know more. This was done on intent to get some friends. The\r\nreasonings be in my deske.”\r\n\r\n[43] _Desiderata Curiosa._\r\n\r\n[44] Nares.\r\n\r\n[45] State Papers, Dom.\r\n\r\n[46] Another remedy was a hedgehog stewed in rose-water.\r\n\r\n[47] The office at first entailed considerable expense to him. In his\r\ndiary there is an entry on 12th April, “Paid the embroiderer for xxxvi.\r\nschutchyns for my servants coats at iiˢ each. iiiˡ xiiˢ;” and in a letter\r\n(State Papers, Dom.) from Petre to Cecil he tells him that the “fashion\r\nof his robes” will be decided when _Garter_ comes to court.\r\n\r\n[48] Strype regards the illness as being a diplomatic one, and I am\r\ninclined to side with him; but it is only fair to say that Cecil’s old\r\nfriend Dr. Wotton, Ambassador in France, attributed it to overwork. He\r\nwrites (State Papers, Foreign), 21st June: “Yow perceive yow must needes\r\nmoderate your labour, your complexion being not strong ynough to continue\r\nas yow begone; and my Lords, I doubt not, will not be so unreasonable as\r\nto requyre more of yow than yow be able to do. A good parte of the labour\r\nwhich was wont to lye on the Clerkes of the Counsell’s hands is now\r\nturned to yow, whereof I suppose yow may easily disburden yourself. It is\r\nbetter to do so betimes than to repent the not doinge of it after, when\r\nit shalle be too late.”\r\n\r\n[49] The ceremony took place at Durham House, in the Strand, which had\r\nbeen granted by Somerset as a town residence for the Princess Elizabeth,\r\nbut which Northumberland had, much to Elizabeth’s indignation, exchanged,\r\nwithout her acquiescence, for Somerset’s unfinished palace in the Strand.\r\nIn answer to her remonstrances, Northumberland humbly protested that\r\nhe had no desire to offend her Grace, but he made no alteration in his\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\n[50] Strype’s “Annals,” vol. iv. Alford’s deposition was made at Cecil’s\r\nrequest twenty years afterwards, and doubtless echoes what Cecil desired\r\nto be said.\r\n\r\n[51] This statement also must be taken for what it is worth. It was\r\nwritten in Cecil’s extreme old age—or soon after his death—and of course\r\nreflected his own version of affairs. It was natural that after the fall\r\nof Jane, and particularly when he was Elizabeth’s minister, he should be\r\nanxious to dissociate himself from an act which deprived the Queen of her\r\nbirthright.\r\n\r\n[52] B. M. Lans. MSS., 2, 102.\r\n\r\n[53] Notwithstanding this protest, there is in Lansdowne MSS., 1236,\r\nNo. 15, a draft or copy, _in Cecil’s own handwriting_, of the document\r\nreferred to, addressed to the Lords-Lieutenant of counties, in which they\r\nare begged “to disturbe, repell, and resyste the fayned and untrue clayme\r\nof the Lady Mary, basterd daughter of … Henry VIII.” The date of this is\r\nthe 10th July; but the Duke of Northumberland’s draft of the same letter\r\nis endorsed by Cecil, 12th July. This would seem to suggest that at all\r\nevents Cecil had helped the Duke in the composition of the first draft of\r\nthe document. On the dorse of Northumberland’s copy (Lansdowne MSS., 3,\r\n34), Cecil has written: “First copy of a l’re to be wrytte from ye Lady\r\nJane … wrytte by ye Duk of Northūblā.” But, as stated above, the date of\r\nhis own copy is two days earlier.\r\n\r\n[54] This interesting document is also printed in Tytler’s “Edward VI.\r\nand Mary.”\r\n\r\n[55] An early copy of this document is in Harl. MSS., 35, and the\r\noriginal draft or “devise” is in Petyt Papers, Inner Temple Library. See\r\nalso Strype and Burnet.\r\n\r\n[56] “Queen Jane and Queen Mary,” Camden Society.\r\n\r\n[57] Harl. MSS., 194. Also Hollingshead and “Queen Jane and Queen Mary.”\r\n\r\n[58] Harl. MSS., 353.\r\n\r\n[59] It is not quite clear whether Cecil preceded or followed Arundel\r\nand Paget in their journey to meet the Queen. It is nearly certain that\r\nCecil started after them. They were certainly present at the proclamation\r\nat Baynard’s Castle on the 19th July, whereas Cecil does not appear to\r\nhave been there. The letter, moreover, written the same morning from the\r\nTower by the Council to Lord Rich, exhorting him to stand firm for Jane\r\n(Lansdowne MSS., 3) which Cecil said was written by Cheke, is signed\r\nby all the Councillors in London, including Arundel, Paget, Petre, and\r\nCheke, _but not by Cecil_. The letter to Mary from the Council, carried\r\nby Arundel and Paget, appears to have borne no signatures (Strype’s\r\n“Cranmer”); but the letter to Northumberland shortly afterwards ordering\r\nhim to obey the Queen bears Cecil’s signature. Probably, therefore,\r\nCecil found some excuse for absenting himself on the critical 19th\r\nJuly, and when Mary’s triumph was assured, signed the denunciation of\r\nNorthumberland, and at once started to greet the Queen.\r\n\r\n[60] 7 Julii Libertatem adeptus sū morte regis et ex misere aulico factus\r\nlibertas mei juris.\r\n\r\n[61] An interesting letter from Northumberland to the Council and\r\nSecretaries of State, written during his illness (27th November 1552,\r\nState Papers, Foreign) shows how much Cecil and his colleagues distrusted\r\nNorthumberland’s new departure in foreign policy. The French Ambassador’s\r\nsecretary had desired audience of the Duke alone, to convey a private\r\nmessage from Henry II. to him. Northumberland knew that this would be\r\nresented by the Council, and wrote: “I have availed myself of my sickness\r\nto direct the Secretary, who was very importunate, to communicate what\r\nhe had to say, to one of the Secretaries of State or to the Council. And\r\nthus I trust within a while, although I may be thought affectionate to\r\nthe French, as some have reported me, yet I doubt not this way which I\r\nintend to use with them to continue but a little while in their graces,\r\nwhich I never desired in all my life but for the service of my master, as\r\nknoweth the Lord.”\r\n\r\n[62] Dalby’s letter in Harl.

Cheke’s evil fate fell upon\r\nhim very shortly, as if in judgment for his own pharisaism. In the same\r\nspring he was lured by promise of pardon into Philip’s Flemish dominions\r\nwith Sir Peter Carew. He was treacherously seized, bound, and kidnapped\r\non board a vessel at Antwerp (much as Dr. Story was in the reign of\r\nElizabeth), brought to England, and lodged in the Tower. Threatened with\r\nthe stake, he allowed Dr. Feckenham to persuade him to recant. Mary’s\r\nGovernment made him publicly drink the cup of degradation to the dregs,\r\nand the unhappy man—pitied by his friends, and betrayed and scoffed at\r\nby his enemies—died of a broken heart the following year (September\r\n1557).

He appears to have been on close terms\r\nof friendship with Cecil, who managed his affairs in his absence, and to\r\nwhom he wrote an interesting account of the great victory of St. Quentin\r\n(Hatfield Papers). The friendship of such men as Bedford, Clinton, and\r\nPaget would of itself almost account for Cecil’s immunity and favour\r\nunder Philip and Mary.\r\n\r\n[82] State Papers, Dom.\r\n\r\n[83] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[84] Cecil seems to have been greatly in request for commissions\r\ninvolving a knowledge of rural dilapidations and the management of landed\r\nestates. In March 1557 the Lords of Queen Mary’s Council commissioned him\r\nto examine the damage done to Brigstock Park, Northamptonshire, and to\r\nplace Sir Nicholas Throgmorton there as keeper (Lansdowne MSS., 3). He\r\nwas also steward of Colly Weston and other manors belonging to Princess\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n[85] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[86] Feria had visited Elizabeth at Hatfield a few days before the Queen\r\ndied, and had then written to Philip: “I am told for certain that Cecil,\r\nwho was Secretary to King Edward, will be her Secretary also.

This would have rendered the position of Spain in the Netherlands\r\nuntenable, and would have destroyed the Spanish commerce, and the fact\r\nexplains Philip’s forbearance with Elizabeth in the earlier years of her\r\nreign.

The first\r\nmeasure of Elizabeth was to turn a large number of the merchantmen,\r\nwhich had been built under subsidy, into warships. These were probably\r\nthe ships referred to by Cardinal Lorraine. On the 3rd July, shortly\r\nafterwards, the Queen was present at the launch of a fine new warship at\r\nWoolwich, which she christened the _Elizabeth_.\r\n\r\n[108] State Papers, Foreign; _in extenso_ in Forbes.\r\n\r\n[109] See also Throgmorton to Cecil, 1st July. _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[110] The Queen to Throgmorton, 17th and 19th July (State Papers,\r\nForeign).\r\n\r\n[111] Sadler to Cecil, 16th September 1559 (Sadler Papers, vol. i.).\r\n\r\n[112] Printed _in extenso_ in Sadler Papers, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[113] Arran travelled as a Frenchman under the name of De Beaufort.\r\n\r\n[114] Sadler Papers, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[115] The scandalous gossip sent by all the foreign agents in England,\r\nespecially by Feria and his successor, caused much heart-burning.\r\nChalloner had been sent to the Emperor in connection with the Archduke’s\r\nmatch, and in the Imperial court found scandal rife about his mistress\r\nand Lord Robert.

He was secretly received by Sir James Crofts\r\nin the castle of Berwick, and there, by Cecil’s instructions, Crofts\r\ngave him a draft written by Cecil of the best form in which to make his\r\nrepresentation to the English Queen and Council. This is a good example\r\nof Cecil’s foresight and thoroughness. He knew that Dudley and other\r\nFrench partisans would oppose in the Council the sending of an army to\r\nScotland, and in order to strengthen Maitland’s hands and avoid the\r\nintroduction of anything upon which his opponent could seize, he himself\r\ndrafted the address of the Scottish Protestants to the Queen and Council.\r\nIt is needless to say that Maitland adopted his suggestions. The original\r\nScotch draft is in the Cotton MSS., Caligula B ix., and extracts of it\r\nhave been printed by Dr. Robertson and Dr. Nares.

M. Add. MSS. 28, 173_a_,\r\nprinted in Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[124] Although I can find no hint of such a thing in De Glajon’s letters\r\nto the Duchess of Parma, an entry in Cecil’s diary seems to prove that\r\nPhilip’s jealousy of France was now so keen as to have led him secretly\r\nto approve of the English attack in Scotland. The entry in Cecil’s own\r\nhand runs: “April 10, M. de Glason came and joined with the Bishop of\r\nAquila to move the revocation of the army out of Scotland, _but Glason\r\nprivately to my Lord Admiral and me the Secretary counselled us to the\r\ncontrary_.” There is in the Record Office (printed _in extenso_ by\r\nForbes) a long Latin document in Cecil’s hand, being his reply or speech\r\nto the official representations of De Glajon and the Bishop of Aquila.\r\n\r\n[125] The French protest is printed by Forbes.\r\n\r\n[126] All in Hatfield Papers, part i.\r\n\r\n[127] The “device” proposed by Cecil would appear to have been the clause\r\nthat if the article relative to the abandonment of the royal arms of\r\nEngland by Mary and her husband was rejected by them, the point was to\r\nbe submitted to the arbitration of the King of Spain. Cecil’s own draft\r\nof the clause is at Hatfield (Papers, part i.). There is no doubt that\r\nCecil was safe in making this condition, as he must have known from his\r\ninterview with De Glajon what Philip’s real sentiments were.\r\n\r\n[128] Cecil was paid during his absence £4 per diem—£252; and for postage\r\nwith twenty two horses from London to Edinburgh and back, £117.\r\n\r\n[129] That this would be the case was foreseen before he started from\r\nLondon in May. Killigrew writes to Throgmorton (in France) on the day\r\nbefore Cecil’s departure, “who (Cecil), for his country’s sake, hath been\r\ncontented to take the matter in hand. The worst hath been cast of his\r\nabsens from hence by his frendes, but at length jugged (judged) for the\r\nbest.… I know none love their country better; I wold the Quene’s Majesty\r\ncould love it so well” (Throgmorton Papers, _in extenso_ in Forbes).\r\n\r\n[130] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[131] The twentieth Earl of Huntingdon (Hastings) was the son of\r\nCatharine Pole by the nineteenth Earl.

He writes to Throgmorton, 4th April, saying\r\nthat the Queen was making the Swedish envoy Guldenstern very welcome. “I\r\nsee no small declensions from former dealings (_i.e._ with Dudley); at\r\nleast I find in her Majesty by divers speeches a determination not to\r\nmarry one of her subjects” (State Papers, Foreign).\r\n\r\n[137] Anthony de Bourbon, titular King-Consort of Navarre, husband of\r\nJeanne d’Albret, and father of Henry IV. of France.\r\n\r\n[138] Hatfield Papers, part i.\r\n\r\n[139] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, i.\r\n\r\n[140] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[141] Throgmorton, a zealous Protestant, who was in France, and, of\r\ncourse, not behind the scenes in London, appears to have been seriously\r\nalarmed, and to have thought that Cecil was really about to change his\r\nreligion. He wrote (29th April) almost vehemently exhorting him not to\r\nruin the country by doing so (Foreign Calendar).\r\n\r\n[142] When Throgmorton first heard that James Stuart was on his way to\r\nFrance he was in great alarm. He was sure that he would be bought over by\r\nMary and the Catholic party, who intended to obtain for him a Cardinal’s\r\nhat. Throgmorton thought that no prominent or powerful Scotsman should\r\ncome to France for fear of his falling under the influence of the\r\nanti-English party. But Cecil saw young Stuart on his way and satisfied\r\nhimself that he might be trusted; and when Stuart returned to Paris from\r\nRheims on his way home, Throgmorton was almost extravagant in his praise\r\nof him, and regarded him as firmly wedded to English interests, as indeed\r\nhe was. Mary, on the advice of Cardinal Lorraine, refused to ratify the\r\ntreaty of Edinburgh until she arrived in Scotland; but she consented to\r\nhand over the government of her realm to James and his friends until\r\nher return. She promised to send after him patents under her great seal\r\nconstituting him Regent, but this she failed to do. Nevertheless he\r\nwent back to Scotland with practically a free hand, pending the Queen’s\r\narrival in her realm. (Foreign Calendar.)\r\n\r\n[143] Hatfield State Papers, _in extenso_ in Haynes.\r\n\r\n[144] For months Throgmorton’s spectre was that Mary might marry Philip’s\r\nonly son, Don Carlos, which, he pointed out to Cecil, would inevitably\r\nruin England and Protestantism. It may be doubted whether Cardinal\r\nLorraine had reached this point yet; though, as will be told, it was\r\nbroached later from another quarter. It is more likely that at this\r\ntime—the early summer of 1561—the Cardinal’s view was to marry his niece\r\nto the Archduke Charles, Elizabeth’s former suitor, which would have\r\ngreatly strengthened the Catholics of Germany and the House of Lorraine.\r\nThe English Catholics at the same time, at the instigation of the\r\nCountess of Lennox, were anxiously advocating a marriage between her son,\r\nLord Darnley, and his cousin, Mary Stuart.\r\n\r\n[145] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[146] Hatfield Papers, part i.\r\n\r\n[147] Throgmorton to Elizabeth, 26th July, in Cabala.\r\n\r\n[148] For Maitland’s interviews with the Queen, see Hayward (Camden\r\nSociety).\r\n\r\n[149] Hatfield Papers, part i.\r\n\r\n[150] Lady Margaret, and the Earls of Westmoreland and Northumberland,\r\nwith the Duke of Norfolk, were summoned to London, whilst the Earl of\r\nArundel was obliged to absent himself from court (November 1561), and the\r\nstudents of the University were in a condition of revolt at the attempt\r\nto reform the worship in the college chapels. “The whole place,” said the\r\nMayor of Oxford, “was of the same opinion (_i.e._ Catholic), and there\r\nwere not three houses in it that were not filled with papists,” “whereat\r\nthe Council were far from pleased, and told the Mayor to take care not to\r\nsay such things elsewhere” (Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.).\r\n\r\n[151] Quadra to the King, 13th September 1561 (Spanish Calendar,\r\nElizabeth).\r\n\r\n[152] The Perpetual Calendar at Hatfield frequently mentions attacks of\r\nillness about this time, “fitts of ague,” or gout, fever, and so on.\r\n\r\n[153] At first the difficulty of obtaining the new coins caused some\r\ninconvenience, and several of Elizabeth’s Councillors were in favour\r\n(1562) of a fresh debasement of the coinage. By Cecil’s and Paget’s\r\nefforts, however, this was avoided, as it was feared that such a measure\r\nwould cause disturbance. For the first year or two the demand was so\r\ngreat for the new money that the supply was quite inadequate to the\r\ndemand, but the people greatly resented the idea of a fresh debasement.\r\n\r\n[154] As early as 1555, in the reign of Mary, Cecil had been one of the\r\noriginal promoters and shareholders of the Russia Company, but he always\r\nsteadily refused to share in privateering.\r\n\r\n[155] The expedition and its object had first been suggested to\r\nThrogmorton in Paris by an old Portuguese pilot, named Captain Melchior,\r\nwho had formerly lived for many years on the Sus coast and other parts of\r\nWest Africa. He had been a pensioner of Francis I. and Henry II., but on\r\nthe death of the latter, lost his pension. The King of Navarre (Anthony\r\nde Bourbon) supported him for a time, and then sent him with his scheme\r\nto Throgmorton, who referred him to Cecil. The expedition itself was\r\nunsuccessful, but was followed by others under the younger Hawkins, which\r\nestablished a lucrative trade in slaves and produce between Africa, the\r\nSpanish Indies, and England. There is an interesting paper in the Record\r\nOffice, dated 27th May of the following year, 1562, when a Portuguese\r\nAmbassador was in England remonstrating against the despatch of a new\r\nexpedition to Guinea. It is a full description of the coast by Martin\r\nFrobisher, who had been for nine months a prisoner of the Portuguese\r\nat Elmina. He shows that the Portuguese on the coast exercised no\r\ncontrol outside of their forts, and were so detested by the natives that\r\nFrobisher and other Englishmen were employed as intermediaries.\r\n\r\n[156] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[157] Foreign State Papers.\r\n\r\n[158] Foreign State Papers.\r\n\r\n[159] Foreign State Papers.\r\n\r\n[160] In 1559 Throgmorton speaks of the youth at that period as being of\r\ngreat promise—unfortunately unfulfilled.\r\n\r\n[161] Foreign Calendar.\r\n\r\n[162] The first war of religion in France.\r\n\r\n[163] The massacre of Vassy, which began the civil war, took place on the\r\n1st March 1562.\r\n\r\n[164] See Grindall’s long list of recusants in prison, in hiding, and in\r\nexile at the end of 1561 (Domestic Calendar).\r\n\r\n[165] See Sidney and Throgmorton’s letters to Cecil (Foreign Calendar,\r\nMay 1562).\r\n\r\n[166] Almost every letter from Throgmorton to Cecil at this juncture\r\nsounds the note of alarm at the possibility of such a combination. A\r\nPortuguese Ambassador had recently been sent to England, once more to\r\nremonstrate about the English trade with Guinea (as fruitlessly as in\r\nthe previous year). He lodged with the Bishop of Aquila at Durham Place,\r\nand Throgmorton was confident that the real object of his mission was to\r\nperfect the arrangement of a Catholic rising in England in conjunction\r\nwith Mary Stuart, the Guises, and Philip. The fears, however, were\r\nperfectly groundless as yet so far as regarded Philip. He was in no hurry\r\nto help the Guises until he had them pledged body and soul, and had\r\ncrushed reform in his own Netherlands. But of course Cecil was unable to\r\npenetrate Philip’s policy so well as we can, with all his most private\r\ncorrespondence before us. It is worthy of mention that D’Antas, the\r\nPortuguese Ambassador above referred to, offered Cecil a regular pension\r\nfrom his sovereign if he would look favourably upon his interests.\r\nCecil’s reply is not forthcoming; but the offer cannot have been\r\naccepted, for the Secretary never varied in his assertion of the right of\r\nEnglish merchants to trade on the West African and Brazilian coasts.\r\n\r\n[167] See statements of Borghese Venturini (State Papers, Foreign).\r\n\r\n[168] Throgmorton Papers; _in extenso_ in Forbes.\r\n\r\n[169] State Papers, Foreign; _in extenso_ in Forbes.\r\n\r\n[170] See the examinations in State Papers, Foreign, 1562.\r\n\r\n[171] Sir Henry Sidney divulged it to the Bishop.\r\n\r\n[172] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[173] Bitter as the Bishop was against Cecil’s policy, which checkmated\r\nhim on every side, it is only fair to say that he usually speaks of his\r\ncharacter with great respect.\r\n\r\n[174] Dudley wrote to Throgmorton (May 1562) that the Queen was\r\nfavourable to Condé and the Huguenots, “but her Majestie seemeth very\r\nwareful in too much open show towards them” (State Papers, Foreign).\r\n\r\n[175] _In extenso_ in Forbes.\r\n\r\n[176] Smith sent a message to Throgmorton (21st November 1562) assuring\r\nhim that his peace negotiations with the Queen-mother and his friendship\r\nwith the Cardinal were not sincere, but only to “discover their minds.”\r\nIt is hardly probable that this was the case; although Smith, as a\r\nzealous Protestant, certainly did not anticipate the abandonment of the\r\ncause of the reformers. Much less did he intend for England to be thrown\r\nover by both sides as she was. In a letter to Cecil (17th December) he\r\nrelates his indignant remonstrance to the Queen-mother when he heard\r\nthat the Guisans in Paris had issued a proclamation of war against Queen\r\nElizabeth as an enemy of the faith. (Letters _in extenso_ in Forbes.)\r\n\r\n[177] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[178] Cecil had built for himself (1560) a splendid mansion in the\r\nStrand, on the site of the present Exeter Hall, the grounds extending\r\nback to Covent Garden. It was joined on the west by the Earl of Bedford’s\r\nestate, for which in a subsequent generation it was exchanged. Cecil\r\nappears to have continued in the possession of his house at Westminster,\r\nadjoining Whitehall, no doubt for business purposes.\r\n\r\n[179] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[180] Sir Simon D’Ewes’ Journal.\r\n\r\n[181] Strype.\r\n\r\n[182] The Bishop of Aquila, in giving an account of these measures,\r\nsays, that it would seem as if they were designed to mimic the Spanish\r\nInquisition.\r\n\r\n[183] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[184] The marriage of the unfortunate Lady Catharine Grey with Lord\r\nHertford—the eldest son of Somerset—was contracted secretly, and when the\r\nbirth of a son made the matter public, the Queen was intensely indignant,\r\nand refused to acknowledge the union, both Lord and Lady Hertford\r\nbeing committed to the Tower. Guzman says that Cecil brought about the\r\nmarriage; but there is no evidence whatever of this. Lord Hertford was in\r\nParis with Cecil’s son, Thomas, when the affair was discovered, and was\r\nrecalled in haste by the Queen. As soon as Cecil heard of it, he warned\r\nhis son not to associate with Hertford. Cecil wrote to his friend Smith\r\nat the same time, “I pray that God may by this chance give her Majesty a\r\ndisposition to consider hereof (_i.e._ the succession), that either by\r\nher marriage or by some common order we her poor subjects may know where\r\nto lean and adventure our lives with content to our consciences.” Greatly\r\nto Cecil’s annoyance the question of Catharine’s guilt was referred to\r\nhim for examination and report. He assured Smith in a letter that he\r\nwould judge impartially, and he did so; for Parker, the Archbishop, on\r\nhis report, pronounced against the marriage, but Cecil continued on close\r\nterms of intimacy with the Grey family, who all called him cousin (Lady\r\nCecil’s brother married Catharine Grey’s cousin), and certainly favoured\r\nLady Catharine’s claims under the will of Henry VIII. Cecil cautiously\r\ndid his best to soften the punishment, and finally obtained the removal\r\nof both husband and wife from the Tower into private custody. Many\r\nletters on the subject from the Greys to Cecil will be found in Lansdowne\r\nMSS. 2.\r\n\r\n[185] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[186] She was probably correct in this. When Elizabeth saw Maitland in\r\nLondon she suggested Dudley as a suitable husband to Mary; and when\r\nthe Scotsman hinted that his mistress was not so selfish as to deprive\r\nElizabeth of a person so much cherished by herself, the English Queen,\r\ngreatly to Maitland’s confusion, hinted at the Earl of Warwick, Dudley’s\r\nbrother. Maitland cleverly silenced the Queen by suggesting that, as\r\nElizabeth was so much older than Mary, she should marry Dudley first\r\nherself, and when she died, leave to the Scottish Queen both her widower\r\nand her kingdom.\r\n\r\n[187] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[188] Cecil was also much interested in the promotion of mineralogy. A\r\npatent was granted in 1563 to a German named Schutz who was skilled in\r\nthe discovery of calamine and the manufacture of brass therewith. For the\r\nworking of this patent a company was afterwards formed, Cecil, Bacon,\r\nNorfolk, Pembroke, Leicester, and others being shareholders, and a great\r\nimpetus was given in consequence to the founding of brass cannon. Much\r\nencouragement was also given by Cecil at this and later periods to German\r\nmineralogists for the working of English mines.\r\n\r\n[189] In a letter to the Vice-Chancellor (Dr. Perne) in April 1560, Cecil\r\nconveyed the pleasant news of the Queen’s intention to grant a number\r\nof prebends and exhibitions to those divinity students that shall be\r\nrecommended “as fittest to receive the same promotions and exhibitions.”\r\nThe object of this was to encourage the divinity students to embrace the\r\nProtestant form of worship, which they were loth to do. (Harl. MSS.,\r\n7037, 265-66).\r\n\r\n[190] There is in the Domestic State Papers of 1565 a draft letter of the\r\nCouncil, written by Cecil to the Vice-Chancellor, forbidding and ordering\r\nthe suppression in Cambridge of all shows, booths, gaming-houses, &c., as\r\nbeing unseemly and dangerous.\r\n\r\n[191] Full account of the visit, with the speeches, &c., will be found in\r\nNichol’s “Progresses of Queen Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\n[192] The old Bishop of Aquila had died, probably of the plague, in the\r\nprevious autumn at Langley, near Windsor. He had been succeeded by Don\r\nDiego Guzman de Silva.\r\n\r\n[193] The official account makes no mention of this. It says only that\r\ngreat preparations had been made to represent Sophocles’ tragedy of Ajax\r\nFlagellifer. “But her Highness, as it were, tyred with going about the\r\ncolleges and hearing disputations, and overwatched with former plays, …\r\ncould not, as otherwise no doubt she would, … hear the said tragedy, to\r\nthe great sorrow not only of the players but of the whole University.”\r\nIf the scene as described by the Spaniard took place, it must have been\r\nat the house of Sir Henry Cromwell, the great Oliver’s grandfather, at\r\nHinchinbrook, where the Queen slept on the night of the day she left\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\n[194] The Queen had, however, supped with him at his yet unfinished\r\nmansion in London—Cecil House—in 1560, and had there stood godmother to\r\nhis infant daughter Elizabeth (6th July 1564).\r\n\r\n[195] This splendid place, to which further reference will be made, was\r\nvisited on his first voyage south by James I., who was so enamoured of\r\nit that he obtained it from the first Earl of Salisbury, Cecil’s younger\r\nson, in exchange for Hatfield. It was at Theobalds that King James died.\r\n\r\n[196] The details of, and correspondence with relation to this\r\ncommercial war, with the various negotiations, and especially\r\nthose of the conference of Bruges, will be found in the Hatfield\r\nPapers, correspondence of the Merchant-Adventurers, Foreign Papers,\r\ncorrespondence of Valentine Dale, Sheres, &c., and in the B. M. Add.\r\nMSS., 28,173, correspondence of Dassonleville and other Flemish agents,\r\nas well as in Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[197] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[198] The book in question was that written by John Hales, Clerk of the\r\nHanaper, in favour of the succession of Lady Catharine Grey and her\r\nchildren. He had been indicted in January 1564 for “presumptuously and\r\ncontemptuously discussing, both by words and in writing, the question of\r\nthe succession to the imperial crown of England, in case the Queen should\r\ndie without issue;” and thenceforward for months interrogatories and\r\ndepositions with regard to his sayings and doings, and those of Catharine\r\nGrey and her husband, Lord Hertford, continued before Cecil without\r\nintermission. (The papers in the case are all at Hatfield, and are mostly\r\npublished _in extenso_ by Haynes.) Hales himself was the scapegoat, and\r\nwas in the Fleet prison for six months; but in all probability, as Dudley\r\nsaid, Cecil and his brother-in-law, Bacon, had a great share in drawing\r\nup the book. Cecil was probably too powerful and useful to touch; but\r\nBacon was reprimanded, and Lord John Grey of Pyrgo, an old friend of\r\nCecil’s, was kept under arrest until his death, a few months later.\r\n\r\n[199] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[200] Philip s reply, partly in his own hand, to his Ambassador’s\r\nreports of Dudley’s offers is characteristic: “I am pleased to see what\r\nLord Robert says, and will tell you my will on the point. I am much\r\ndissatisfied with Cecil, as he is such a heretic; and if you give such\r\nencouragement to Robert as will enable him to put his foot on Cecil and\r\nturn him out of office, I shall be very glad. But you must do it with\r\nsuch tact and delicacy, that if it fails, none shall know that you had a\r\nhand in it” (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.).\r\n\r\n[201] Hatfield Papers, part i.\r\n\r\n[202] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[203] This refers to the order issued shortly before, called\r\n“Advertisements for the due order of the administration of the Holy\r\nSacrament, and for the apparel of all persons ecclesiastical”; which\r\ncommenced the bitter “vestments controversy.”\r\n\r\nAn interesting series of returns from the bishops, of this date (October\r\n1564) is at Hatfield. Their lordships had been directed to make reports\r\nof the persons of note in their respective dioceses, classified under the\r\nheads of “favourers of true religion,” “adversaries of true religion,”\r\nand “neutrals.” To the reports the bishops append their recommendations\r\nfor reform. The Bishop of Hereford says that all his canons residentiary\r\n“ar but dissemblers and rancke papists.” He suggests that all those who\r\nwill not conform should be expelled; and most of his episcopal brethren\r\nadvocate even stronger measures than these. Another paper of this time\r\n(1564) addressed to Cecil, and printed by Strype in his “Life of Parker,”\r\nshows the remarkable diversity of the service in English churches. As\r\nwill be seen later, Cecil’s attitude on the great vestment question\r\ndivided him from many of his Protestant friends.\r\n\r\n[204] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[205] Memoirs of Sir James Melvil of Hallhill.\r\n\r\n[206] Bedford and Maitland subsequently met at Berwick to discuss the\r\nproposed match. It suited Mary to pretend some willingness to take\r\nLeicester in order to obtain leave for Darnley to come to Scotland.\r\nShe was probably right in supposing that finally Elizabeth did not\r\nmean to allow Leicester to marry the Scottish Queen. Cecil was of the\r\nsame opinion. Writing to his friend Smith at the end of December 1564\r\n(Lansdowne MSS., 102), he says, “I see her Majesty very desyroose to have\r\nmy L. of Leicester placed in this high degree to be the Scottish Queen’s\r\nhusband, but when it cometh to the conditions which are demanded I see\r\nher then remiss of her earnestness.”\r\n\r\n[207] Melvil’s Memoirs.\r\n\r\n[208] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[209] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[210] Humphrey and Sampson, both eminent divines and friends of Cecil,\r\namongst others, stood out. The former, after much hesitation, was\r\nforced into obedience; but the latter was dismissed from his deanery\r\nof Christ Church (Strype’s “Annals”). The students and masters of\r\nCecil’s own College of St. John gave him as Chancellor much trouble by\r\nrefusing to wear their surplices and hoods. After much correspondence\r\nand remonstrance with them, the Chancellor became really angry, and the\r\nstudents assumed a humbler attitude.\r\n\r\n[211] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[212] _Dépêches de De Foix, Bibliothèque Nationale._\r\n\r\n[213] Foreign State Papers.\r\n\r\n[214] _Dépêches de De Foix, Bibliothèque Nationale._\r\n\r\n[215] Castelnau de la Mauvissière was in London in May 1565 on his way\r\nto France from Scotland, and gives, in a letter to the Queen-mother, a\r\nmost entertaining account of a conversation with Elizabeth at a night\r\ngarden-party given by Leicester in his honour (the letter itself is\r\nin a private collection, but is printed in Chéruel’s _Marie Stuart\r\net Catharine de Medici_). She said how much more popular in England\r\nFrenchmen were than Spaniards; praised the young King as “the greatest\r\nand most virtuous prince on earth.” She asked Castelnau whether he would\r\nbe vexed if she married the King. “Although she had nothing,” she said,\r\n“worthy of so great a match: nothing but a little realm, her goodness and\r\nher chastity, on which point at least she could hold her own against any\r\nmaiden in the world,” and much more to the same effect. Castelnau says\r\nhe never saw her look so pretty as she did. Catharine took the hint, and\r\nher industrious approaches to Smith were largely prompted by Elizabeth’s\r\ncoquetry to Castelnau on this occasion.\r\n\r\n[216] Hatfield Papers, _in extenso_ in Haynes.\r\n\r\n[217] Cecil writes to Smith, 3rd June 1565 (Lansdowne MSS., 102). “My\r\nLord of Lecester furdereth the Quene’s Majesty with all good reasons to\r\ntake one of these great princes, wherein surely perceaving his own course\r\nnot sperable, he doth honourably and wisely. I see few noblemen devoted\r\nto France; but I being _Mancipum Reginæ_, and lackyng witt for to expend\r\nso great a matter, will follow with service where hir Majesty will goo\r\nbefore.” This attitude is very characteristic of the writer.\r\n\r\n[218] There is an enigmatical entry in Cecil’s journal at this period,\r\nAugust 1565, saying, “The Queene’s Majestie seemed to be much offended\r\nwith the Earle of Leicester, and so she wrote an obscure sentence in a\r\nbook at Windsor.” Strype, who has been followed by most other historians,\r\nthought that this referred to Leicester’s opposition to the Archduke’s\r\nsuit. The real reason for the Queen’s squabble with Leicester is given by\r\nGuzman (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.). August 27: “I wrote to\r\nyour Majesty that the Queen was showing favour to one Heneage, who serves\r\nin her chamber. Lord Robert and he have had words, and as a consequence\r\nRobert spoke to the Queen about it. She was apparently much annoyed at\r\nthe conversation.… Heneage at once left the court, and Robert did not\r\nsee the Queen for three days, until she sent for him. They say now that\r\nHeneage will come back at the instance of Lord Robert, to avoid gossip.”\r\n\r\n[219] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[220] Harl.

MSS., 4645.\r\n\r\n[222] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[223] The action of the French representatives was extremely perplexing.\r\nOn the one hand, they offered help to Elizabeth against Scotland, and\r\nurged Mary to make terms with Murray; whilst on the other, they continued\r\nto intercede with Elizabeth for Lady Margaret and Mary, and conveyed the\r\nkindest messages to the Queen and Darnley. (See Randolph’s letters.)\r\n\r\n[224] Yaxley was sent back from Madrid with glowing promises and\r\nencouragement from Philip to Mary and Darnley, and 20,000 crowns in\r\nmoney. The ship, however, in which he sailed from Flanders was wrecked,\r\nand Yaxley’s lifeless body was washed up on the coast of Northumberland,\r\nwith the money and despatches attached to it. The money, of course,\r\nnever reached Mary, but formed the subject of a long squabble as to the\r\nrespective claims for it, of the Crown and the Earl of Northumberland.\r\n(Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.).\r\n\r\n[225] State Papers, Scotland.\r\n\r\n[226] Randolph’s letter, 6th February 1566, gives particulars of Mary’s\r\nadhesion to the League of Bayonne (Harl. MSS. 4645); but she does not\r\nappear actually to have signed the “bond” sent to her, as she was urged\r\nto do by the Bishop of Dunblane and other papal emissaries. There is\r\nnot the slightest doubt, however, that she looked at this time to the\r\nCatholic league alone for help in her claims, and had decided to defy\r\nEngland and the Protestant party.\r\n\r\n[227] Randolph to Cecil, 1st March; and Randolph and Bedford to Cecil,\r\n6th March (Scottish State Papers).\r\n\r\n[228] Randolph wrote to Leicester on the 13th February 1566, telling\r\nhim of a plot to kill Rizzio, and probably the Queen, in order that\r\nLennox and his son Darnley might seize the crown. He says he thinks it\r\nbetter _not_ to tell Cecil, but to keep the secret between the writer\r\nand Leicester. On the 1st March, Randolph sent to Cecil copies of the\r\ntwo “Conventions,” signed by the Earls—namely, that of Darnley, Morton,\r\nand Ruthven, to kill Rizzio; and that of Murray, Argyll, Rothes, &c.,\r\nto uphold Darnley in all his quarrels. Bedford, writing to Cecil on the\r\n6th March, begged him earnestly to keep the whole matter secret, except\r\nfrom Leicester and the Queen. It will thus be seen that, far from being\r\na promoter of the Darnley plot to kill Rizzio, Cecil did not know of it\r\nin time to stop its perpetration, if he had been inclined to do so, as\r\nthe murder was committed on the 9th March. Against this, however, must\r\nbe placed, for what it is worth, Guzman’s statement that Cecil had told\r\nLady Margaret of Rizzio’s murder as having taken place the day before it\r\nreally occurred.\r\n\r\n[229] From a statement of Guzman (28th January 1566) it would appear\r\nthat Cecil, probably in union with Murray, had some idea of bringing\r\nDarnley round to the English interest. The Queen (Elizabeth), he says,\r\nhad refused Rambouillet’s suggestion that when he arrived in Scotland he\r\nmight bring about a reconciliation between the two Queens. “Afterwards,\r\nhowever, Cecil went to his (Rambouillet’s) lodgings, and told him that\r\nwhen the King of Scotland, bearing in mind that he had been an English\r\nsubject, should write modestly to the Queen, saying that he was sorry\r\nfor her anger, and greatly wished that it should disappear, he (Cecil)\r\nbelieved that everything would be settled, if at the same time the Queen\r\nof Scotland would send an Ambassador hither to treat of Lady Margaret’s\r\naffairs” (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.).\r\n\r\n[230] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[231] Only two days before this Guzman gave the same advice to\r\nElizabeth. Both she and Cecil then assured him of their desire for such\r\na settlement, which would have checked French designs in Scotland, and\r\ndisarmed Spain.\r\n\r\n[232] We do not often hear of Lady Cecil’s action in politics, but on\r\nthis occasion she seems to have seconded her husband. Guzman writes (22nd\r\nApril 1566): “Cecil’s wife tells me that the French Ambassador says that\r\nif the Archduke comes hither, he will cause discord in the country, as\r\nhe will endeavour to uphold his religion, and will have many to follow\r\nhim. She thinks the Queen will never marry Lord Robert, or, indeed, any\r\none else, unless it be the Archduke, which is the match Cecil desires.\r\nCertainly, if any one has information on the matter, it is Cecil’s wife,\r\nas she is clever and greatly influences him.”\r\n\r\nA few days after the above was written, Guzman visited Cecil, who\r\nwas ill, and mentioned how annoyed the French were when they saw the\r\nArchduke’s suit prospering. “They then at once bring forward their\r\nown King to embarrass the Queen. When this trick has hindered the\r\nnegotiations, they take up with Leicester again, and think we do not see\r\nthrough them.” “Yes,” replied Cecil, “they are very full of fine words\r\nand promises, as usual, and they think when they have Lord Robert on\r\ntheir side their business is as good as done, but their great object is\r\nto embroil the Emperor with the King of Spain.” (Spanish State Papers,\r\nElizabeth, vol. i.)\r\n\r\n[233] When news came of Brederode’s “protest” in the Netherlands and\r\nthe rising of the “beggars,” Guzman tried hard to discover from Cecil\r\nwhether any connection existed between the rebels and the English. He\r\nconcluded that there was none, although the eastern counties’ ports were\r\nfull already of Flemish Protestant fugitives. The Queen was very emphatic\r\nin her condemnation of the “beggars” at first. “Fine Christianity, she\r\nsaid, was this, which led subjects to defy their sovereign. It had begun\r\nin Germany and in France, and then extended to Scotland, and now to\r\nFlanders, and perhaps some day will happen here, as things are going now.\r\nSome rogues, she said, even wanted to make out that _she_ knew something\r\nabout the affairs in Flanders. Only let me get them into my hands, she\r\nexclaimed, and I will soon make them understand the interest I feel in\r\nall that concerns my brother, the King” (_i.e._ Philip). (Spanish State\r\nPapers, Elizabeth.)\r\n\r\n[234] See the letters of Cecil’s spy, Ruxby (or Rooksby), _in extenso_\r\nin Haynes. This man had fled from England to Scotland for debt. He was\r\nknown to Cecil, who, when he heard that he was dealing with Mary Stuart\r\nin Edinburgh, warned him. Ruxby then offered his services as a spy, and\r\nsent Cecil very compromising information about Mary’s plans. Melvil\r\ndiscovered this, and Ruxby was seized by the Scots and put in prison,\r\nKilligrew’s attempts, at the instance of Cecil, to convey him to England\r\nas an escaped recusant, being thus frustrated. (Hatfield Papers.)\r\n\r\n[235] He started from Edinburgh a few hours after James’s birth, and\r\nreached London in four days (Melvil Memoirs).\r\n\r\n[236] Melvil Memoirs.\r\n\r\n[237] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i. On the 20th July, Cecil\r\nwrites to Lord Cobham, “I trust I shall not be troubled with the Scottish\r\njourney” (Hatfield Papers).\r\n\r\n[238] Nichol’s “Progresses of Queen Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\n[239] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[240] Although Cecil was a member of the Commons deputation, he was,\r\nof course, known to be against the measure, and escaped the Queen’s\r\nvituperation. Cecil himself in his notes thus refers to the matter:\r\n“1566. October 17. Certen Lords, viz., Erle of Pembroke and Lecester,\r\nwer excluded the presence-chamber, for furdering the proposition of the\r\nsuccession to be declared in Parliament without the Queen’s allowance.”\r\n\r\n[241] The Parliament was dissolved on 2nd January 1567. The principal\r\nmeasure adopted in it was that which gave Parliamentary confirmation to\r\nthe consecration of the bishops and archbishops, in order to counteract\r\nthe attacks promoted by Bonner against the Protestant consecration. The\r\nmeasure was principally urged by the bishops themselves, and in the Lords\r\nwas carried to a great extent by their votes, there being twenty-eight\r\nbishops present, and thirty-two lay peers. The House of Commons was\r\nstrongly Protestant, and was dissolved instead of being prorogued, as was\r\nexpected. Although the measure referred to was passed, the Government\r\nrefrained from proceeding further against the Catholic bishops who had\r\nrefused the oath of supremacy. (See Strype’s “Annals,” &c.)\r\n\r\n[242] _Scrinia Ceciliana._\r\n\r\n[243] Spanish State Papers: Guzman to Philip, 1st March.\r\n\r\n[244] _Scrinia Ceciliana._\r\n\r\n[245] These letters will be found in Labanoff, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[246] Catharine de Medici’s attitude when she heard the news was\r\ncharacteristic. She thus wrote to Montmorenci: “Gossip: my son the King\r\nis sending you this courier to give you the news he has received from\r\nScotland. You see that the young fool (Darnley) has not been King very\r\nlong. If he had been wiser he would have been alive still. It is a great\r\npiece of luck for the Queen, my daughter, to be rid of him.” (MSS.\r\nBibliothèque Nationale, Bethune.)\r\n\r\n[247] Drury to Cecil, April 1567 (State Papers, Scotland).\r\n\r\n[248] _Scrinia Ceciliana._\r\n\r\n[249] _Scrinia Ceciliana._\r\n\r\n[250] Again, on the 3rd September, Cecil writes to Norris: “The Queen’s\r\nMajesty, our sovereign, remaineth still offended with the Lords (of\r\nScotland) for the Queen: the example moveth her.” Later in the month\r\n(27th September) a French envoy came through England on a mission to\r\nScotland, and proposed to Elizabeth that joint action should be taken to\r\nsecure Mary’s liberation. The envoy was persuaded in London to refrain\r\nfrom continuing his journey, and we see that Cecil’s feeling in favour\r\nof the Protestant party was gradually gaining ground in Elizabeth’s\r\ncounsels. He writes: “Surely if either the French King or the (English)\r\nQueen should appear to make any force against them of Scotland for the\r\nQueen (of Scots’) cause, we find it credible that it were the next way to\r\nmake an end of her; and for that cause her Majesty is loth to take that\r\nway.” As an instance of the divergence of the Queen and Cecil during the\r\nsummer, Guzman, detailing a private conversation he had with the Queen\r\nin July, during which he warned her again against French interference in\r\nScotland, writes: “Certain things passed in the conversation which she\r\nbegged me not to communicate _even to Cecil_.”\r\n\r\n[251] _Scrinia Ceciliana._\r\n\r\n[252] The object of the French was to retain their alliance with Scotland\r\nin any case, which, indeed, was their great safeguard against England and\r\nSpain. De Croc was sent as Ambassador in 1566 for this especial purpose.\r\nVilleroy and Lignerolles were subsequently despatched respectively to\r\nconciliate Murray and Bothwell. When Murray assumed the Regency, the\r\nFrench were just as anxious to recognise him as they had been to welcome\r\nother régimes, and Charles IX. himself assured Murray of his continued\r\nfriendship. (See letters and instructions in Chéruel.)\r\n\r\n[253] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[254] Cecil writes to Lord Cobham (27th May): “Lady Clinton hath procured\r\nmy wife to make a supper to-morrow, where a greater person will covertly\r\nbe, as she is wont. The Queen hath made asseverations to persuade the\r\nDuke (of Norfolk) of her effectual dealing to marry, and to deal plainly\r\nin this embassy” (Hatfield Papers). The object of the supper was to\r\nenable the Queen privately to meet the Emperor’s Ambassadors before their\r\npublic reception. She seems to have been much disappointed that they had\r\nnothing to say about the marriage, and as a result decided at last to\r\nsend the Earl of Sussex to the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[255] Guzman expressed his disbelief in any such intelligence having\r\nbeen received, whereupon Cecil showed him the paper. The document had\r\nreached Cecil in German from one of his agents, and is still in the\r\nBurghley Papers. Guzman pointed out to Cecil the undiplomatic form in\r\nwhich the articles of the alleged treaty were drawn up and their inherent\r\nimprobability, which Cecil admitted. The particulars are now known to\r\nhave been a fabrication, although the main object of the league was\r\nunquestionably to suppress Protestantism by extermination.\r\n\r\n[256] The answer, which Guzman calls a very impertinent one, will be\r\nfound in State Papers, Foreign, June 1567, and the original draft, in\r\nCecil’s hand, at Hatfield.\r\n\r\n[257] Guzman writes (5th July): “Everything that can be done to arouse\r\nthe suspicion of the Queen against your Majesty is being done by certain\r\npeople, and I am trying all I can to banish such feeling and keep her\r\nin a good humour, without saying anything offensive of the King of\r\nFrance … I think I have satisfied and tranquillised her; although when\r\nthey see your Majesty so strongly armed, suspicion is aroused, and not\r\nhere alone.” On the 21st July, he says, “With all the demonstrations\r\nof friendship and the friendly offers I make to the Queen from your\r\nMajesty, I find her rather anxious about the coming of the Duke of Alba\r\nto Flanders.”\r\n\r\n[258] Murray very closely describes the contents of the “first” casket\r\nletter, of which so much has been written. The arguments of Mary’s\r\ndefenders, founded on the long delay in the production of the letters,\r\ntherefore fall to the ground, as Murray had evidently seen a copy, or the\r\noriginals, before the end of July. To those who accuse Murray himself\r\nof having caused the letters to be forged, it may be replied that, on\r\nthe 12th July, De Croc, on his way from Scotland to France, mentioned\r\nto Guzman in London the existence of the letters. As Dalgleish, with\r\nthe letters, was captured in Edinburgh on the 20th June, there was no\r\ntime in the interval for Morton in Scotland and Murray in Lyons to have\r\nconcocted an elaborate forgery such as this. Murray, at all events, must\r\nbe acquitted, as De Croc, leaving Scotland at the end of June, had copies\r\nof the letters in his possession.\r\n\r\n[259] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[260] How wavering Elizabeth’s policy was at the time, according as\r\nLeicester or Cecil was near her, may clearly be seen. By Throgmorton’s\r\ninstructions of 30th June (State Papers, Scotland; _in extenso_ in\r\nKeith), it is evident that his mission was to blame both Mary and the\r\nLords, making Elizabeth the arbiter between them, and to negotiate the\r\nrestoration of Mary to liberty, but without political power. The Lords\r\nwould not allow this, and Throgmorton failed. On the other hand, Melvil\r\nwas sent back to Scotland shortly before Throgmorton, taking a message\r\nfrom Elizabeth to the Lords, in reply to their secret intimation that\r\nthey intended to depose Mary, and a promise to the effect that she\r\nwould aid them “in their honourable enterprise” (Melvil to Cecil, 1st\r\nJuly—State Papers, Scotland; _in extenso_ in Tytler).\r\n\r\n[261] Guzman to Philip, August 9, 1567, Spanish State Papers. Guzman\r\nat this time had a conversation with a French envoy, Lignerolles, who\r\nwas returning from Scotland. He told him that Leicester’s henchman\r\nThrogmorton, on his embassy to Scotland, had acted earnestly and\r\nvigorously in favour of Mary. “Which,” writes Guzman, “I quite believe,\r\nas he has always been attached to her. He is also a great friend of Lord\r\nRobert’s, and an enemy of Cecil, whom the Queen does not consider to be\r\nin favour of the Queen of Scots, but a partisan of Catharine” (Grey).\r\n\r\n[262] “Her Majesty much dislikes of the Prince of Condé and the French\r\nLords. The (English) Council do all they can to cover the same. Her\r\nMajesty, being a Prince herself, is doubtful to give comfort to subjects.\r\nYou (Norris), nevertheless, shall do well to comfort them as occasion\r\nshall serve” (_Scrinia Ceciliana_). The day before this was written,\r\nGuzman writes to Philip, speaking of the suspicion that exists that the\r\nQueen is helping the Huguenots, of which, however, he cannot find any\r\nconfirmation: “But still I notice that when news comes favourable to the\r\nheretics, these Councillors are more pleased than otherwise, whilst they\r\ngrieve if the heretics fail” (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth).\r\n\r\n[263] Guzman’s comment upon this is curious: “These heretics are so blind\r\nas to marvel why your Majesty does not allow full liberty to all in your\r\ndominions to enjoy their own opinions and schisms against the Catholic\r\nreligion, and yet they themselves refuse to let people live freely in\r\nthe ancient religion which for so many years they have followed without\r\nmolestation.”\r\n\r\n[264] This second “plough” was probably an arrangement to subsidise\r\nMurray to send a privateer naval force to intercept some of Philip’s\r\nvessels conveying a number of Flemish nobles to Spain, amongst others\r\nCount de Buren, the young son of the Prince of Orange.\r\n\r\n[265] Dr. Allen had recently established the English seminary at Douai,\r\nand a Dr. Wilson was apprehended in March 1568 for collecting money\r\nfrom English Catholics for the seminary at Louvain. Cecil himself, in\r\nhis essay on the “Execution of Justice,” mentions the large number of\r\npapal emissaries in England at this time. Thomas Heath, brother of the\r\nArchbishop, and Faithful Cummin, a Dominican monk, were both arrested\r\nduring this spring for carrying on a Catholic propaganda under the guise\r\nof Puritan Nonconformists. (See Strype’s Parker, &c.).\r\n\r\n[266] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[267] He was said to have called the Pope a “canting little monk.”\r\nAmongst those who testified against him was Gresham’s agent Huggins, who\r\nafterwards became one of Cecil’s spies in Spain, and betrayed both sides.\r\n\r\n[268] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[269] Drury to Cecil, 28th November 1567 (State Papers, Scotland).\r\n\r\n[270] In Labanoff, vol. ii.

Cecil’s whole efforts\r\nwere directed against preventing French troops being sent to Scotland at\r\nany cost. In Cecil’s own memoranda (Harl. MSS., 4653), when Mary first\r\nentered England, this is the main point dwelt upon. No person was to see\r\nMary without permission of the English guard, all the known accomplices\r\nof Darnley’s murder were to be arrested, all interference of the French\r\nwas to be prevented, and if it was decided to restore Mary, it was only\r\nto be on conditions which insured the exclusion of the French. The\r\nsumming up of the document consists of a statement of the dangers that\r\nwould ensue to England if Mary were to be allowed to return to France, or\r\nif, on the other hand, she remained in England. At this time Cecil was in\r\nfavour of Mary’s restoration under the strict tutelage of England.\r\n\r\n[278] See letters 21st June, &c., Hatfield Papers (_in extenso_ in\r\nHaynes), and 13th June and 5th July, Cotton MSS., Caligula, c. i.\r\n\r\n[279] See Cecil’s report and recommendations, Harl.

(No. 1200), and many letters\r\non the subject _in extenso_ in Haynes. In November the sittings were\r\ntransferred to Westminster. On the 30th October a Council was held at\r\nHampton Court, at which the “casket letters” were considered, and it was\r\ndecided that Mary’s representatives, the Bishop of Ross and Lord Herries,\r\nshould first have audience of Elizabeth. They were to be so questioned as\r\nto “move them to confess their general authority to answer all charges.”\r\nThe representatives of the Lords, Maitland and MacGill, were then to be\r\nintroduced and asked what answer they could give to Mary’s accusations,\r\nand why, in face of the letters they produced, they refrained from\r\ncharging the Queen openly with murder. It was decided in the Council\r\nto remove Mary from Bolton to Tutbury.

It is asserted that the seizure of the treasure was urged\r\nupon Cecil as a reprisal for this. I am of opinion that such was not the\r\ncase, as the seizure of the money was under consideration before it was\r\npossible for the affair of St. Juan de Ulloa to be known.\r\n\r\n[291] The safe conduct for the money sent to the ports by De Spes was\r\nclosely followed by contrary orders from the Council to Sir William\r\nHorsey at Southampton, and Champernoun at Plymouth, and the treasure was\r\nlanded in accordance therewith. On the 13th December, William Hawkins\r\nwrote to Cecil from Plymouth with rumours of the attack on John Hawkins\r\nat St. Juan de Ulloa, but the seizure must have been decided upon before\r\nCecil received the letter.\r\n\r\n[292] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[293] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[294] The seizure of Spanish property had greatly alarmed the English\r\nmerchants and bankers, and was the pretext seized upon by Cecil’s enemies\r\nto ruin him.\r\n\r\n[295] _Desiderata Curiosa._\r\n\r\n[296] Fuller’s “Holy State.”\r\n\r\n[297] How moderate and cautious Cecil was in his triumph, after he had\r\ndiscovered and apprised the Queen of the plot to ruin him, and had barely\r\nescaped the dagger of the hired assassin who was to kill him, is seen\r\nin his subsequent demeanour towards the conspirators. Instead of trying\r\nto disgrace or punish them, he continued to work loyally with them.\r\nThe real prime mover in the plot was Leicester, with whom outwardly\r\nCecil was always friendly. Cecil, writing to a friend at the time, thus\r\nexpresses himself: “I am in quietness of mind, as feeling the nearness\r\nand readiness of God’s favour to assist me with His grace, to have a\r\ndisposition to serve Him before the world; and therein have I lately\r\nproved His mere goodness to preserve me from some clouds or mists, in\r\nthe midst whereof I trust mine honest actions are proved to have been\r\nlightsome and clear. And to make this rule more proper, I find the\r\nQueen’s Majesty, my gracious lady, without change of her old good meaning\r\ntowards me, and so I trust by God’s goodness to observe a continuance.\r\nI also am moved to believe that all my Lords, from the greatest to the\r\nmeanest, think my actions honest and painful, and do profess inwardly\r\nto bear me as much good-will as ever they did.” That this was the case,\r\nat least with one of the conspirators, is proved by the fact that\r\nLord Pembroke, who died at the end of the year, left Cecil one of his\r\nexecutors, jointly with Leicester and Throgmorton.\r\n\r\n[298] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[299] Although in all her letters Mary designates Cecil as her enemy,\r\nshe could, when not carried away by anger, perceive his good qualities.\r\nIn February 1569 she was removed to Tutbury, and was extremely angry and\r\nalarmed at this. In conversation with Henry Knollys, who repeated the\r\nconversation to a correspondent of Cecil’s (Hatfield Papers, part i.\r\n1279), “she spared not to give forth that the Secretary was her enemy,\r\nand that she mistrusted by this removing he would cause her to be made\r\naway.” But when her passion was over, she said that though the Secretary\r\nwere not her friend, he was an expert, wise man, wishing it might be her\r\nluck to get the friendship of so wise a man.\r\n\r\n[300] Hatfield Papers; _in extenso_ in Haynes.\r\n\r\n[301] Denied afterwards by Norfolk, but confirmed by Melvil. (See State\r\nTrials, and Melvil’s Memoirs).\r\n\r\n[302] The Bishop of Ross deposed afterwards that Norfolk was so much\r\nexasperated at Murray’s having finally brought forward the whole of\r\nthe evidence to convict Mary of murder, that he formed a plot for his\r\nassassination. Melvil says, however, that before Murray returned to\r\nScotland, Throgmorton had fully gained his acquiescence in the projected\r\nmarriage, and had reconciled the Regent and the Duke.\r\n\r\n[303] Alba was very angry with De Spes for the way in which he was\r\ncompromising Spain. He wrote again to him in July, saying that he “was\r\ninformed from France that the Queen of Scotland was being utterly ruined\r\nby the plotting of her servants with you, as they never enter your house\r\nwithout being watched. This might cost the Queen her life, and I am not\r\nsure that yours would be safe.” The evidence given afterwards at the Duke\r\nof Norfolk’s trial, and the examinations of Bailly and the Bishop of\r\nRoss, proved that Cecil had information of everything that occurred.\r\n\r\n[304] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth. Alba, writing to Philip soon\r\nafterwards (8th August), says, “I have written several times to Don\r\nGerau, telling him to suspend negotiations, as I plainly see they are\r\ntricking him, so as to get all they can from him, and then say they have\r\nnegotiated without authority. He is zealous … but he is inexperienced;\r\nhe allows himself to be led away, and is ruining the negotiation.” It\r\nwill be seen that it was comparatively easy for Cecil to outwit such an\r\ninstrument as this.\r\n\r\n[305] Mary consented to the condition; and the whole arrangement was,\r\naccording to Norfolk and the Bishop of Ross, acquiesced in by Leicester\r\nand the majority of the Council. How far sincere Mary was in accepting\r\nthe condition, may be seen by her message to De Spes. “She says if she\r\nwere at liberty, or could get such help as would enable her to bring her\r\ncountry to submission, she would deliver herself and her son entirely\r\ninto your Majesty’s hands, but now she will be obliged to sail with the\r\nwind” (De Spes to Philip, 27th August). This, no doubt, referred to her\r\nhaving consented to the marriage with Norfolk, and to the proposals\r\nsubmitted by the English Government to Murray and the Parliament of Perth\r\nfor Mary’s return to Scotland. Murray was opposed to his sister’s return\r\nin any form, and neither of the Queen’s propositions, nor Mary’s petition\r\nfor a divorce from Bothwell, was granted. That Cecil was at this time\r\n(the spring and summer of 1569) desirous of getting rid of Mary from\r\nEngland, without allowing her to go to France, where the Catholics had\r\njust beaten the Huguenots, is certain, and also that he did not wish her\r\nto be ill used in Scotland. See his minute sent to Murray by Henry Carey,\r\ndemanding to know what hostages would be given for her safety if she was\r\nreturned. (Hatfield Papers, Haynes; also Strype’s Annals, and Rapin.)\r\n\r\n[306] Harl. MSS., 6353.\r\n\r\n[307] _Scrinia Ceciliana_, 3rd October.\r\n\r\n[308] In a postscript to a letter from the Earl of Huntingdon to Cecil\r\nfrom Coventry, where he was in joint charge of Mary Stuart, 9th December\r\n1569, he mentions “the speech that passeth amongst many, how earnest a\r\ndealer you were for this marriage for which the Duke and others do suffer\r\nher Majesty’s displeasure: yea, it is reported from the mouth of some\r\nof the sufferers that, in persuasion, you (Cecil) yielded such reasons\r\nfor it as he (the Duke), by them, was most moved to consent.” Cecil can\r\nhardly have been so forward in the matter as is here suggested, or it\r\nsurely would have been mentioned in the rigorous examinations of those\r\nimplicated. (Hatfield Papers, part i.)\r\n\r\n[309] De Spes went so far as to say that it was Cecil who was urging that\r\nNorfolk should be sent to the Tower—the very reverse, as we now know,\r\nbeing the case. Cecil afterwards thought it worth while to defend himself\r\nagainst this charge in a note of his still existing in the Cotton MSS.\r\nIt runs: “Whoso sayeth that I have in any wise directly or indirectly\r\nhindered or altered her Majesty’s disposition in the delivery of the\r\nDuke of Norfolk out of the Tower, I do affirm the same is untrue, and he\r\nthat sayeth so doth speak an untruth. If any man will affirm the same to\r\nbe true against this, my assertion, the same doth therein maintain an\r\nuntruth and a lye. W. Cecil, xii. Julii, 1570.”\r\n\r\n[310] 2nd November (_Scrinia Ceciliana_).\r\n\r\n[311] Full details of the operations against the rebels will be found\r\nin the Sadler Papers; Sir Ralph Sadler being the Warden of the East and\r\nMiddle Marches, and Paymaster-general of the army.\r\n\r\n[312] The Earl of Westmoreland succeeded in escaping to Flanders,\r\nand thence to Spain. He remained a pensioner of Philip’s for years\r\nafterwards, plotting against England, and beseeching payment of the\r\ngrudging dole which the Spanish King had assigned to him. Northumberland\r\nwas captured by Murray and imprisoned in Lochleven; and at the time of\r\nthe Regent’s assassination, Elizabeth’s special envoys from the Border\r\nwere negotiating for Northumberland’s surrender. He was delivered to the\r\nEnglish Government in 1572 by the Regent Morton, and beheaded at York.\r\n\r\n[313] On the pretext of negotiating once more for the return of the\r\nSpanish property seized, Alba sent to England, in October, the famous\r\nItalian general, Ciapino Vitello, and in his letters to Sadler, Cecil\r\nexpresses great anxiety as to the probability of an attack being made by\r\nAlba on Hartlepool at the time. English writers have always assumed that\r\nCiapino came to England in order to take command of a force to be sent\r\nby Alba to England, but there is no trace of such a project in Alba’s\r\nor Guzman’s letters. Ciapino was forced, however, to leave his large\r\nretinue at Dover, and considerable delay took place before even he was\r\nreceived. Alba states to Philip that Cecil and Leicester had been, or\r\nwere to be, bribed by the bankers Spinola and Fiesco, to allow Ciapino\r\nto come to England (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth), but Leicester sent\r\nword to Ciapino, as soon as the rising in the north was known, that his\r\nstay in England was considered very suspicious. He was then hurried\r\naway as soon as possible. There was really, however, not the slightest\r\nground at the time to fear an armed invasion by Alba in favour of Mary.\r\nHe wrote to Philip, 11th December, that he expected the rising “would\r\nall end in smoke,” and he would not move a step without Philip’s precise\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n[314] See _inter alia_ the Bishop of Ross’s letter to Philip, 4th\r\nNovember 1569 (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth). His mistress, he says,\r\nhad ordered him to remonstrate with Elizabeth against her imprisonment at\r\nTutbury, and to demand either her restoration to her throne, or that she\r\nshould be allowed to go over to France or Spanish Flanders. He can get no\r\nanswer from Elizabeth, he says, and therefore in Mary’s name fervently\r\nbegs for Philip’s aid.\r\n\r\n[315] Very large sums were granted by Elizabeth for this purpose. To\r\nCount Mansfield alone she promised 100,000 crowns payable in three\r\nmonths, and a like sum in two years. In February the Prince of Orange\r\nsent an envoy to England to beg for similar aid, which was to be largely\r\nsupplemented by the Flemings in England. The envoy was secretly lodged in\r\nCecil House.\r\n\r\n[316] There is an interesting memorandum of this period in Cecil’s hand\r\n(Hatfield Papers, part i., Nos. 1452 and 1455), entitled, “Extract of ye\r\nbooke of ye state of ye realme,” in which the various dangers set forth\r\nin this page and the remedies therefor are described. The dangers are—the\r\nconspiracy of the Pope and the Kings of France and Spain against England;\r\nthat of Mary Queen of Scots; the decay of civil obedience and of martial\r\npower in the country; the interruption of trade with Flanders, and the\r\nshortcomings in England’s treaties with foreign princes.\r\n\r\n[317] Hatfield Papers, part i.\r\n\r\n[318] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[319] See her letters in Labanoff, iii., and also Banister’s Confessions\r\n(Hatfield).\r\n\r\n[320] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[321] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[322] The whole of the documents are at Hatfield; most of them _in\r\nextenso_ in Haynes.\r\n\r\n[323] See Morton to Cecil, 9th February 1571 (Hatfield Papers, part i.,\r\n1541); and Elizabeth to Shrewsbury, 24th March (_ibid._, 1546).\r\n\r\n[324] _Correspondance de la Mothe Fénélon._\r\n\r\n[325] Walsingham Papers.

From them it is clear that the Secretary himself was uncertain\r\nof the Queen’s intentions. In one important letter to her (31st August),\r\nCecil suggests a way by which she may extricate herself, if she pleases,\r\nfrom the agreement she had made on the matter with Catharine’s special\r\nenvoy, De Foix, at Knebworth. But he warns her very seriously of the\r\ndangerous position in which she stands unless she does marry. “It will,”\r\nhe says, “also be necessary to seek by your Majesty’s best council the\r\nmeans to preserve yourself, as in the most dangerous and desperate\r\nsicknesses, the help of the best physicians; and surely how your Majesty\r\nshall obtain remedies for your perils, I think, is only in the knowledge\r\nof Almighty God.”\r\n\r\n[327] Norris to the Queen (Foreign State Papers), 31st August 1570; also\r\nWarcop’s communications from Walsingham to Cecil, 16th July 1571, &c.\r\n\r\n[328] Walsingham Papers.\r\n\r\n[329] His eldest son Thomas, afterwards Lord Exeter, also sat in this\r\nParliament as representative of the borough of Stamford. He had ended the\r\nsowing of his wild oats, to which reference has been made, by running\r\naway with a nun from a French convent; and was now married to Dorothy\r\nNevil, a daughter of the last Lord Latimer, whose sister had married Sir\r\nHenry Percy, brother of the rebel Earl of Northumberland. Lord Burghley,\r\nin the little Perpetual Calendar at Hatfield, duly records the birth of\r\nall of Thomas’s children, three of whom had been born by this time.\r\n\r\n[330] The young Earl of Rutland, one of his wards, especially at this\r\ntime seems to have occupied much of his attention. He was sent with\r\nLord Buckhurst’s embassy to France to congratulate Charles IX. on his\r\nmarriage with Elizabeth of Austria, and at every stage of the journey a\r\ncorrespondence was kept up between them, the Secretary being solicitous\r\nfor the lad’s welfare and good treatment even to the smallest detail.\r\nIn the State Papers, Domestic, of 20th January 1571, there is a curious\r\ndocument in Cecil’s handwriting, headed “Directions for a Traveller,”\r\nlaying down for Lord Rutland’s guidance strict rules for his conduct\r\nwhilst abroad.\r\n\r\n[331] Mary to the Bishop, 8th February 1571 (Cotton MSS., Caligula, c.\r\nxi.).\r\n\r\n[332] Hatfield Papers and State Trials.\r\n\r\n[333] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[334] That this possibility was ever present to the minds of Elizabeth’s\r\nadvisers, is seen by the constant warnings on the subject by Cecil’s\r\nagents in Flanders, and by Walsingham. In one of Cecil’s statements as\r\nto the advantages and disadvantages of the Queen’s marriage with Anjou\r\n(Foreign State Papers, 14th January 1571), he enters on the contra\r\nside the possibility that, in the case of there being no issue, the\r\nKing-consort might shorten the Queen’s life and marry Mary Stuart. The\r\nconfessions of the men who were to murder Burghley in connection with the\r\nRidolfi plot are at Hatfield.\r\n\r\n[335] Details of all the examinations and the letters are at Hatfield.\r\nBurghley alleged that Bailly was a Scotchman. His claim to be considered\r\na servant of the Queen of Scots was merely a technical one, although on\r\nhis tomb in a church in a suburb of Brussels he is called a secretary of\r\nthe Queen, which he certainly was not, and there is a bas-relief of her\r\nexecution. This has led on several occasions to the incorrect assertion\r\nthat Charles Bailly was present at the scene represented. He lived for\r\nmany years in Flanders in the pay of Spain; and, at least on one occasion\r\n(1586), he took part in a Spanish attempt to foment a Catholic invasion\r\nand revolution in Scotland.\r\n\r\n[336] The Pope had sent by Beton, early in the year, as much as 140,000\r\ncrowns to Mary Stuart, which she received through Ridolfi. (Examination\r\nof Ross: Hatfield.)\r\n\r\n[337] The conspiracy included also a design to assassinate Burghley\r\nhimself.

During the\r\nwedding festivities the open slight to Spain was made the most of.\r\nCavalcanti was flattered and caressed, the Guises were denounced as\r\n“Hispaniolised traitors,” and the Queen’s connection with the Protestants\r\nof Germany and Flanders boasted of; whilst De Spes and his master\r\nwere scornfully held up as an object-lesson of England’s boldness and\r\nstrength. De Spes, in his last letter to Alba before his embarkation,\r\nsays that “Burghley has received certain threatening letters, and had\r\ninformed the Queen that if I stay here during the trial of the prisoners\r\nthe country will rise up in arms; and he, timid, contemptible fellow that\r\nhe is, commits so many absurdities that people are quite astonished.”\r\n\r\n[343] The alcabala or tenth penny—ten per cent. on every sale.\r\n\r\n[344] Foreign State Papers.\r\n\r\n[345] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[346] _Correspondance de la Mothe Fénélon._\r\n\r\n[347] Burghley writes to Walsingham, 11th February 1572, an account\r\nof the Queen’s vacillation about Norfolk’s fate: “Suddenly on Sunday,\r\nlate at night the Queen’s Majesty sent for me, and entered into a great\r\nmisliking that the Duke should die next day, and said she was, and should\r\nbe, disquieted; and said she would have a new warrant made that night to\r\nthe sheriffs to forbear, until they should hear further. God’s will be\r\nfulfilled, and aid her Majesty to do herself good.” (Walsingham Papers:\r\nComplete Ambassador). In another letter from Burghley to Walsingham a\r\nfew weeks earlier than this, he complains of the Queen’s clemency: “The\r\nQueen’s Majesty has always been a merciful lady, and by mercy she hath\r\ntaken more harm than by justice, and yet she thinks she is more beloved\r\nin doing herself harm.” And again: “Here is no small expectation whether\r\nthe Duke shall die or continue prisoner.

When Parliament did meet again, the clemency of the Queen\r\ntowards Mary was made a source of complaint by the Puritan Wentworth, who\r\nwas imprisoned for his undutiful speech. For the consultation and report\r\nof the joint committee of the two Houses in 1572 respecting Mary Stuart,\r\nsee D’Ewes’ “Compleat Journal.”\r\n\r\n[353] It is probable that on this occasion the Queen made the celebrated\r\nremark to Burghley’s servant. He told her Majesty, who wore a very high\r\nhead-dress, that it would be necessary to stoop to enter the door of the\r\nchamber where the sick man lay. “For your master only will I stoop,”\r\nsaid the Queen, “but not for the King of Spain.” It may be worth while\r\nto repeat De Guaras’ remark when giving an account of this sickness of\r\nBurghley. The latter had been showing an inclination to come to terms\r\nwith Spain about the seizures (it was shortly before the French alliance\r\nwas signed), and his illness had interrupted the negotiations. “If this\r\nman dies,” writes De Guaras, “it will be very unfortunate for the purpose\r\nwhich he declared to me.… It is true that hitherto he has undoubtedly\r\nbeen the enemy of peace and tranquillity, for his own bad ends; but I am\r\nconvinced that he is now well disposed, which means that the Queen and\r\nCouncil are so, for he, and no one else, rules the whole affairs of the\r\nState. God grant that if it be for His service he may live.” (Spanish\r\nState Papers, Elizabeth, vol. ii.)\r\n\r\n[354] These are the dates in the diary, but they do not quite agree with\r\nthe entries in the little Perpetual Calendar at Hatfield, which run thus:—\r\n\r\n“19 July 1572. W. Cecill admiss. Thesaurus Angl.\r\n\r\n“19 July 1572. Quene’s Majestie at Theobalds, 5 to 6.”\r\n\r\n[355] A curious letter from Sir Nicholas Bacon to Burghley respecting\r\nthis visit is in Lansdowne MSS., 14 (printed by Ellis), in which he prays\r\nfor advice and guidance, “ffor in very deede no man is more rawe in such\r\na matter than myself” (12th July 1572. Gorhambury).\r\n\r\n[356] There is another letter in the same collection from the Earl of\r\nBedford to Burghley, begging him to arrange that the Queen should not\r\nstay at Woburn longer than two nights and a day. “I pray god the Rowmes\r\nand Lodgings there may be to her Majesty’s contentation for the tyme.…\r\nThey should be better than they be” (16th July 1572. Russell House).\r\n\r\n[357] Spanish State Papers, 22nd July 1572, a month before St.\r\nBartholomew. If this be true, it to some extent confirms the subsequent\r\nallegations of the Catholics as to a plot of the Huguenots.\r\n\r\n[358] Foreign State Papers; _in extenso_ in Digges.\r\n\r\n[359] Smith to Walsingham, 27th September (Foreign State Papers; _in\r\nextenso_ in Digges).\r\n\r\n[360] When Orange entered Brabant in September he sent an envoy to\r\nEngland to ask for aid. An agent at once started from London with £16,000\r\nin money, and a few days afterwards £30,000 in bills on Hamburg were\r\nsent, for which the Prince wrote thanking Burghley. Large quantities\r\nof stores were also shipped from England, and a force of 12,000 men\r\ncollected at the ports in case of emergency.\r\n\r\n[361] See his letters in Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth; and also\r\n“Antonio de Guaras,” by Richard Garnett, LLD.\r\n\r\n[362] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[363] How deeply interested Burghley was in the question of trade is seen\r\nin the active efforts he was making at this time to establish the Flemish\r\nfugitives in various parts of England, to exercise the handicrafts in\r\nwhich they excelled. During the negotiations with De Guaras, he was\r\nestablishing a community of cloth-workers in his own town of Stamford,\r\nlodging them at first in a house of his own, giving them a church and\r\naiding them with money. (Dr. Cunningham’s “Alien Emigrants in England”;\r\nState Papers, Domestic; and Strype’s Parker.)\r\n\r\n[364] Burghley, on a previous occasion, had frightened De Guaras out of\r\nhis wits by charging him with conspiring against the Queen. Throughout\r\nthe whole negotiation the Spaniards were alternately flattered and\r\nthreatened. De Guaras himself was one day overjoyed with Burghley’s\r\namiability and admiration for all things and men Spanish; and the next\r\nday cast into the depths of gloom, by haughty indifference, or hints at\r\npunishment for treason, of which the poor man was as yet quite innocent;\r\nor, again, by talk of the diversion of all English trade to France or\r\nHamburg, the abundant aid being sent to Orange, or the welcoming of the\r\nDutch privateers into English ports. The negotiation and its result are a\r\ngood specimen of Lord Burghley’s diplomatic methods.\r\n\r\n[365] The documents relating to the protracted negotiations with regard\r\nto the seizures, and the resumption of trade, will be found in the Cotton\r\nMSS., Galba ciii., civ., cv., cvi., and Vesp. cxiii.\r\n\r\n[366] Hatfield Papers; _in extenso_ in Murdin; also State Papers,\r\nScotland.\r\n\r\n[367] See letters in Cotton MSS., Caligula, ciii.\r\n\r\n[368] The terms were—that the hostages should be delivered within four\r\nhours of the surrender of Mary; that James should be taken under the\r\nprotection of Elizabeth, and his rights remain intact, and be recognised\r\nby the English Parliament; that a defensive alliance should be concluded\r\nbetween the two countries; that the Earls of Bedford, Huntingdon,\r\nand Essex should be present at the Queen’s execution with a force of\r\n3000 men, and immediately afterwards join the King’s troops to reduce\r\nEdinburgh Castle, which should then be delivered to the Regent; and,\r\nfinally, that all arrears of pay owing to the Scottish army should be\r\npaid by England. The Spanish agents attributed the failure of Killigrew’s\r\nmission to the efforts of De Croc, the French Ambassador in Scotland.\r\nElizabeth told the latter, when she saw him in London in October, that\r\nshe was well aware of all his plots in Scotland. Her uneasiness at the\r\ntime was increased by the news of the arrival in Paris of Cardinal\r\nOrsini, a papal envoy with a fresh plan for the release of Mary.\r\n\r\n[369] State Papers, Foreign. See also Burghley’s letters to Copley.\r\nRoxburghe Club.\r\n\r\n[370] Foreign State Papers; _in extenso_ in Digges.\r\n\r\n[371] Foreign State Papers; _in extenso_ in Digges.\r\n\r\n[372] The progress of each stage in the complicated business is related\r\nin the author’s “Courtships of Queen Elizabeth.”\r\n\r\n[373] The Bishop of London’s letter to Burghley is at Hatfield, part\r\nii.; _in extenso_ in Murdin. “These be dangerous days,” he says, “full\r\nof itching ears mislying their minds, and ready to forget all obedience\r\nand duty.… A soft plaister is better than a sharp corosy to apply to this\r\nsore.… If Mr. Deryng be somewhat spared, yet wal scoled, the others,\r\nbeing manifest offenders, may be dealt withal according to their deserts”\r\n(3rd June 1573).\r\n\r\n[374] In one case his love of justice had an unfortunate termination.\r\nA crazy Puritan named Birchett stabbed Sir John Hawkins in the Strand,\r\nunder the belief that he was Sir Christopher Hatton, the declared rival\r\nof Leicester in the Queen’s affection; and it was surmised also, his\r\nopponent in his Puritan leanings. The Queen issued a commission for\r\nBirchett’s summary trial and punishment by martial law, but was persuaded\r\nby Burghley to remand him to safe custody for further inquiries. He was\r\nimprisoned in the Lollard’s Tower, and a few days afterwards killed his\r\nkeeper. He was clearly a maniac, but the affair brought great odium upon\r\nPuritanism, and led to the arrest of Mr. Cartwright, the leader of the\r\nparty. It is to be noticed that Burghley provided suitable preferment\r\nfor all the eminent Puritan nonconformists who were dismissed from their\r\npositions in the Church; Cartwright, Lever, and Sampson being made\r\nrespectively “masters” of charitable foundations where their opinions on\r\nritual were of little importance.\r\n\r\n[375] Original letters, Ellis.\r\n\r\n[376] Gilbert Talbot to the Earl of Shrewsbury, 9th May 1573 (Lodge’s\r\nIllustrations).\r\n\r\n[377] The number and variety of remedies sent to Burghley from all parts\r\nof the world for the cure of the gout are truly marvellous. We have\r\nalready mentioned some in an earlier page, but they became much more\r\nfrequent after this year (1573), when a Mr. Dyon sent one which Burghley\r\nendorses as “Recipe pro podagra,” as well as Lady Harrington. Dr. Nuñes,\r\nthe Queen’s Portuguese physician, sent quite a collection of nostrums\r\nin Latin, and a German doctor recommended certain medicated slippers; a\r\ntincture of gold was advocated by a Nicholas Gybberd, and the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury was loud in his praises of “oyle of stagg’s blood.” Most of\r\nthe recipes mentioned will be found in the Lansdowne MSS., 18, 21, 27,\r\n29, 39, and 42.\r\n\r\n[378] See letters from Mary, in Labanoff, vol. iv. Elizabeth showed some\r\namount of jealous suspicion at Burghley’s interview with Mary, of which\r\nLeicester and the Treasurer’s enemies made the most during his absence.\r\n\r\n[379] Burghley, as Lord Treasurer, seems to have been seriously concerned\r\nat the heavy cost of these progresses. In the Lansdowne MSS., 16, there\r\nis a document, altered and corrected by Lord Burghley himself, of this\r\ndate (1573), showing how the royal household expenses had been increased\r\nby this particular progress. It is to be deduced from the document that\r\nextra expenditure entailed was £1034, 0s. 6d.\r\n\r\n[380] See a curious letter from Lord Windsor to Burghley, 10th January\r\n1574, exculpating himself for this letter (Hatfield Papers, part ii., No.\r\n181).\r\n\r\n[381] Hatfield Papers; _in extenso_ in Murdin.\r\n\r\n[382] As a matter of fact he was straining every nerve at the time\r\nto hold back his half-brother, Don John of Austria, who, with papal\r\nsupport, was full of all manner of grand plans for the founding of a\r\ngreat Christian Empire in Africa or the East, with himself as Emperor;\r\nor else for invading England from Flanders, marrying Mary Stuart, and\r\nreigning over a Catholic Great Britain. Don John and Gregory XIII. were\r\nvery serious in their plans; but Philip was determined that nothing of\r\nthe sort should be done with Spanish forces. He was absolutely bankrupt\r\nat the time, and had recently been obliged to repudiate the interest\r\nupon the vast sums he had borrowed. This had caused wholesale financial\r\ndisaster in Italy and Flanders, and Philip’s credit was at its lowest ebb.\r\n\r\n[383] Mary’s own hopes were high for a short time after the accession\r\nof her favourite brother-in-law. But she soon found out her mistake.\r\nCatharine’s aim was not to benefit Mary Stuart, but to prevent the\r\nextinction of French influence in Scotland. Her first act after Henry\r\nIII. ascended the throne was to project an embassy to Scotland,\r\naccredited, not as all previous French embassies had been, to Mary\r\nStuart’s party alone, but to both parties. Mary indignantly protested\r\nat this proposed recognition of the “usurpers,” and the embassy was\r\nabandoned. La Chatre was sent to London in March 1575, to confirm the\r\ntreaty of Blois (in which Elizabeth and the Huguenots were comprised),\r\nbut he did not say a word in favour of the liberation of the Queen of\r\nScots. The withdrawal soon afterwards of the Guisan La Mothe Fénélon from\r\nEngland, and the appointment, as Ambassador, of Castelnau, a great friend\r\nof the English alliance, quite convinced Mary that she had nothing to\r\nhope for from Henry III., who, sunk in sloth and vice, left everything to\r\nhis mother.\r\n\r\n[384] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[385] 16th April 1575 (Hatfield Papers).\r\n\r\n[386] Woodshaw’s interesting letters of this period to Burghley are in\r\nHatfield Papers. See also “Copley’s Correspondence,” Roxburghe Club.\r\n\r\n[387] Hatfield Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[388] Hatfield Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[389] See Philip’s minute of his conversation with Cobham, October 1575\r\n(Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth), and also Lord Burghley’s Diary.\r\n\r\n[390] Burghley, in his Diary, refers to this embassy, giving the names\r\nof the envoys. He says they based their offer of Holland, &c., to the\r\nQueen upon her descent from Philippa of Hainault and Holland, who married\r\nEdward III.\r\n\r\n[391] Gerald Talbot writes: “Her Majesty is troubled with these causes,\r\nwhich maketh her very melancholy, and she seemeth to be greatly out of\r\nquiet. What shall be done in these matters is at present unknown; but\r\nhere are ambassadors on all sides, who labour greatly, one against the\r\nother. Her Majesty hath put upon her to deal betwixt the King of Spain\r\nand the Low Country; the King of France and his brother. Her Majesty may\r\ndeal as pleaseth her, for I think they both be weary of war, especially\r\nFlanders, which, as report goeth, is utterly wanting of money, munition,\r\n&c.” Hampton Court, 4th January 1576.\r\n\r\n[392] Burghley was at the time unable to attend the Council in\r\nconsequence of an attack of his old enemy the gout.\r\n\r\n[393] A few days later Burghley had reason to be still more angry with\r\nOxford himself, though with his reverence for rank he appears to have\r\ntreated him with inexhaustible patience and forbearance. Oxford had been\r\nvery extravagant and got into difficulties. During his absence abroad\r\nhe had made some complaint to Burghley about his steward or agent, but\r\nnothing apparently of consequence. In March, Lord Burghley wrote to\r\nhim in Paris, saying that his wife was pregnant; and the Earl’s answer\r\nwas most cordial, full of rejoicing at the news, and announcing his\r\nimmediate return. The Treasurer’s eldest son, Sir Thomas Cecil (he had\r\nbeen knighted the previous year at Kenilworth), travelled to Dover to\r\nmeet his brother-in-law. All went well until they arrived in London, when\r\nOxford declined to meet his wife or hold any communication with her.\r\nBurghley reasoned, remonstrated, and besought in vain. Oxford was sulky\r\nand intractable. His wife, he said, had been influenced by her parents\r\nagainst him, and he would have no more to do with her. The whole of the\r\ndocuments in the quarrel are in Hatfield Papers. As some indication of\r\nthe state in which noblemen of the period travelled even short distances,\r\ntwo entries in the uncalendared household account-book at Hatfield may\r\nbe quoted: “Saturday, December 1576. My Lord and Lady Oxford came from\r\nLondon to Theobalds; 28 servants with them.” And again, “Monday, 14th\r\nJanuary 1577. My Lord and my Lady of Oxford and 28 persons came from\r\nLondon.”\r\n\r\n[394] State Papers, Foreign.\r\n\r\n[395] State Papers, Foreign.\r\n\r\n[396] Hatfield Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[397] How true this is may be seen by the account of an important\r\nconversation De Guaras had with Burghley on the 30th January 1576\r\n(Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth). De Guaras had prayed Burghley to\r\nprevent the Queen from accepting the offer of Orange’s envoys for her to\r\ntake Holland and Zeeland. The Treasurer replied that, if the offer were\r\naccepted, it would only be in the interests of Spain, and to prevent the\r\nFrench from obtaining a footing. The Spaniard derided such a possibility,\r\nand Burghley said that England, in pursuance of its ancient policy, would\r\ndefend the rights of the House of Burgundy, but that “foreign intruders”\r\nhad misgoverned the States to an extent which endangered England itself.\r\n“Foreign intruders” indeed, retorted De Guaras; “your Lordship cannot\r\ncall Spaniards ‘foreign intruders’ in Flanders.” Burghley got angry at\r\nthis, and said, “You people are of such sort that wherever you set foot\r\nno grass grows, and you are hated everywhere.” Hollanders, he continued,\r\nwere fighting for their privileges, and would be successful in upholding\r\nthem. The end of the colloquy was a renewal of the Queen’s wish to\r\nmediate between Orange and Spain. The great object was to prevent the\r\nFrench from obtaining influence in Flanders, and here Spanish and English\r\naims were identical.\r\n\r\n[398] A violent attack against the hierarchy, and even against the Queen,\r\nwas made in Parliament (February 1576) by Paul Wentworth, member for\r\nTregony, a strong Puritan, who declared against the powers given to the\r\nbishops to regulate ritual without the intervention of Parliament, and\r\ncomplained of the rejection by the Queen of the bills against the Queen\r\nof Scots in the previous session of 1572. Wentworth was imprisoned in the\r\nTower for a few days for his boldness. (D’Ewes’ Journal.)\r\n\r\n[399] As Sussex for once was on the side of Leicester and the Puritans,\r\nBurghley seems to have depended as an ally at this time principally upon\r\nHatton. A letter from the latter to the Treasurer (26th August 1576,\r\nLansdowne MSS., 22) shows that Burghley was urging him to return to court\r\nfrom the country, where he was lying ill, and apparently unhappy. His\r\nrecent unjust extortion of the lease of Ely Place, Holborn, from the\r\nBishop of Ely (Cox), had rendered him very unpopular.\r\n\r\n[400] A similar but more flattering offer was made in 1573 by the\r\nunfortunate Earl of Essex, who proposed that his eldest son, then\r\nonly about six years old, should be betrothed to Burghley’s daughter\r\n(Lansdowne MSS., 17). A few hours before he died (21st September 1576)\r\nthe Earl wrote a most pathetic letter to Lord Burghley, praying him to\r\ntake the same son into his household, and beseeching him to be good\r\nto him for the sake of his father, “who lived and died your true and\r\nunfeigned friend” (Hatfield Papers). It is sad to consider that the\r\nson grew up to be the enemy of his father’s friend; to succeed, in his\r\nenmity of Burghley, the vile Leicester, who dishonoured his mother and\r\ndeliberately ruined his father.\r\n\r\n[401] Hatfield Papers.\r\n\r\n[402] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[403] Philip’s reception of Smith was cold, more so even than had been\r\nhis treatment of Sir Henry Cobham. Smith writes to Burghley (5th February\r\n1577) saying that he “has had special care to make known the Queen’s\r\nnoble nature and the great love and obedience of her subjects; in which\r\nhe has not detracted any title of honour that your Lordship is worthy of.\r\nYea, even the Duke of Alba himself gives you the honour to be one of the\r\nmost sufficient men in Christendom in all politic government.” Smith’s\r\nreports of the extremity of Philip’s financial exhaustion caused great\r\nsurprise amongst the friends of Spain in Elizabeth’s court, many of whom\r\ndisbelieved them. When Smith returned and begged the Queen for a reward\r\nfor his services, she refused to accord him anything except to take his\r\nbills payable in twelve months for £2000 instead of a mortgage she had\r\non his lands. (See letter 21st September 1578, Hatton to Burghley: State\r\nPapers, Domestic.)\r\n\r\n[404] A sum of no less than 400,000 crowns was openly provided by\r\nElizabeth for the States at the request of the Catholic Flemish nobles.\r\n\r\n[405] Hatfield Papers.\r\n\r\n[406] See the extraordinary Italian letter of this period from Baptista\r\nde Trento to the Queen, in which nearly the whole of her nobility\r\n(including Leicester and Sussex) are accused (Hatfield Papers), and also\r\na letter written by Burghley to Lord Shrewsbury, after his return from\r\nBuxton, warning him to keep his eyes on Mary, who was, he said, suspected\r\nof suborning some of Shrewsbury’s servants. The persecuting Bishop of\r\nLondon (Aylmer) also wrote at the same time to Burghley urging him to\r\n“use more severity than hath hitherto been used; or else we shall smart\r\nfor it. For as sure as God liveth they look for an invasion, or else they\r\n(the Catholics) would not fall away as they do” (Strype’s Aylmer).\r\n\r\n[407] According to his own statement the case against him was divulged\r\nto Burghley by some of the Catholic Flemish nobles who were aware of his\r\nformer practices; but there are many indications in his letters up to\r\nthe time of his arrest, that he was a party to plots then in progress,\r\nespecially one with Colonel Chester and others.\r\n\r\n[408] An interesting minute on the subject, in Burghley’s writing, is\r\nin Hatfield Papers (part ii., No. 531). Two personages were to be sent\r\nfrom England to bring about peace: one to the States, and the other to\r\nDon Juan. The States were to be reminded that they owed gratitude to\r\nElizabeth for risking war with Spain on their behalf, and aiding them\r\nwith £85,000; and the envoy was to point out to them the danger of their\r\nreceiving French help. The French, they are to be told, may either turn\r\nand side with the enemy, or try to keep the country for themselves. As a\r\nlast resort, the English envoy is to be authorised to offer English aid\r\nif the States will desist from dealing with the French.\r\n\r\nDon Juan, on the other hand, is to be told that if he does not make terms\r\nwith the States, the French will conquer the country, in which case the\r\nQueen will send such aid to the States as will enable them to hold their\r\nown against everybody. As usual with Burghley’s minutes, there is at the\r\nend a carefully-balanced summary of possibilities, and courses to be\r\npursued, all tending to the same end—the exclusion of the French from\r\nFlanders. The mission in question was that of June 1578, the envoys being\r\nLord Cobham and Walsingham.\r\n\r\n[409] For a wonder, on this occasion Sussex sided with his enemy\r\nLeicester, although, as will be seen, only for a short time.\r\n\r\n[410] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[411] Grindall, Archbishop of Canterbury, had been deprived by the Queen\r\nfor neglecting to suppress the “prophesying”; and Sandys, Archbishop of\r\nYork, was also in disgrace; but, as Strype says, “his good friend Lord\r\nBurghley stood up for him.” He certainly did so in the case of Grindall,\r\nwho kept up a constant correspondence with the “good Lord Treasurer.”\r\n\r\n[412] Add. MSS., 15,891; 21st April 1578.\r\n\r\n[413] To such an extent was this so, that whilst, according to Mendoza,\r\nmoney and men were constantly being sent to Flanders, and Leicester and\r\nWalsingham were planning the murder of Don Juan and the expulsion of\r\nMendoza from England, “I can assure your Majesty that the Earl of Sussex\r\nis sincerely attached to your Majesty’s interests, and Cecil also, though\r\nnot so openly. But if he and Sussex are properly treated they will both\r\nbe favourable, and their good disposition will be much strengthened when\r\nthey see it rewarded.” His suggestion was that Burghley and Sussex should\r\nbe granted large pensions. It will be observed that Sussex had already\r\nbroken free from Leicester.\r\n\r\n[414] Elizabeth appears to have been very angry about Gondi’s mission.\r\n“She told him,” says Mendoza, “loudly in the audience chamber, that she\r\nknew very well he had come to disturb her country, and to act in favour\r\nof the worst woman in the world, whose head should have been struck off\r\nlong ago. She was sure he had not come with the knowledge of his King,\r\nbut only of some of those who surrounded him. Gondi replied that the\r\nQueen of Scots was a sovereign, as she was, and her own kinswoman, and\r\nit was not surprising that efforts should be made on her behalf. The\r\nQueen answered him angrily, that she should never be free as long as she\r\nlived, even if it cost her (Elizabeth) her realm and her own liberty. The\r\nQueen-mother, she said, must surely know what Mary had attempted against\r\nher.” (5th May 1578; Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.)\r\n\r\n[415] Mendoza dilates much upon the venality of the English Council, and\r\nsays, “I am told by a person in the palace, that, even in the matter of\r\ngiving me audience readily, the Queen has been considerably influenced by\r\nthe gloves and perfumes I gave her when I arrived.”\r\n\r\n[416] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, and also a letter from Sussex\r\nto Burghley in November, printed by Lodge, vol. ii.; also Sussex to\r\nBurghley, Hatfield Papers, part ii., where he mentions that “Burghley\r\nalso had been ill-used by lewd speech. I will on all occasions stick as\r\nnear to you as your shirt is to your back.” (5th November 1578.)\r\n\r\n[417] This was true. The treaty of Nerac was signed in February 1579 by\r\nHenry of Navarre, now the acknowledged leader.\r\n\r\n[418] Cobham, Wilkes, and Smith had all been sent back with a short\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n[419] Sir Thomas Cecil to Burghley, and Lord Lincoln to the same\r\n(Hatfield Papers).\r\n\r\n[420] Hatton to Burghley, 28th September 1578 (Hatfield Papers).\r\n\r\n[421] There are many hundreds of such letters as these at Hatfield and in\r\nthe Lansdowne MSS.\r\n\r\n[422] Hatfield State Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[423] Mendoza, writing on 8th April, says, “Lord Burghley is not so much\r\nopposed to the match as formerly; but I cannot discover whether he and\r\nSussex have changed their minds because they think that they may thus\r\nbring about the fall of Leicester, and avenge themselves upon him for old\r\ngrievances, and for his having advanced to the office of Chancellor an\r\nenemy of theirs” (_i.e._ Bromley). On another occasion, when the Queen\r\nlearned of the Papal-Spanish expedition to Ireland to aid the Desmonds in\r\nMunster, she was so much alarmed that she dropped the French negotiations\r\nfor some days and refused to see Simier.\r\n\r\n[424] It has not been noticed by Burghley’s biographers that, true to his\r\ncautious character, he found an excuse for going into Northamptonshire\r\nshortly before Alençon arrived in London. He writes an interesting\r\nletter to Hatton from Althorpe, dated 9th August (Nicholas’s “Life of\r\nHatton”), in reply to the advices respecting the fortifying of the Papal\r\nforce at Dingle, in Kerry. The ships must be sent against them, he says,\r\ndouble-manned, “as there is no good access by land.” He is very jealous\r\nof foreigners setting foot in Ireland, for fear any “discontentation\r\ngrow betwixt France and us upon a breach of this interview (_i.e._\r\nwith Alençon), or if the King of Spain shall be free from his troubles\r\nin the Low Country.” He approves of the agreement of Cologne and the\r\npacification of Ghent, whereby Holland and Zeeland were to remain\r\nProtestant, and Flanders Catholic, rather than the war should go on.\r\n“On Tuesday morning we will be at Northampton, where after noon we mean\r\nto hear the babbling matters of the town for the causes of religion,\r\nwishing that we may accord them all in mind and action; at least we will\r\ndraw them to follow one line by the rule of the laws, or else make the\r\ncontrariant feel the sharpness of the same law.” On the same day Burghley\r\nwrote a vigorous letter to Walsingham directing energetic action in\r\nIreland.\r\n\r\n[425] Burghley’s minutes of the deliberations are in Hatfield Papers,\r\npart ii.\r\n\r\n[426] Hatfield Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[427] The original draft of the protocol in Simier’s handwriting is\r\nin the Hatfield Papers. A most valuable digest or “time-table,” in\r\nBurghley’s handwriting, of the whole of the negotiations for the Queen’s\r\nmarriage up to the period of Simier’s departure, will be found in the\r\nHatfield Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[428] Allen’s famous English seminary had been transferred to Rheims\r\nunder the patronage of the Guises, and a great number of young priests\r\nwere continually sent into England, especially after 1579, the first\r\nmembers of the Jesuit mission, Persons and Campion, arriving in 1580.\r\n\r\n[429] Mendoza at this period writes to the King of the enormous number of\r\nships being built. “This,” he says, “makes the English almost masters of\r\nthe commerce … as they have a monopoly of shipping, whereby they profit\r\nby all the freights.” Burghley was an untiring promoter of extension of\r\nlegitimate trade, as he was a constant enemy to piracy. He was at this\r\ntime promoting Humphrey Gilbert’s colonisation schemes in North America,\r\nthe enterprises of Frobisher and his friends in Hudson’s Bay, the trade\r\nof the Muscovy Company, the overland route to the Caspian by the White\r\nSea and the Volga, and other similar adventures; but, as we shall have\r\noccasion to see later, he disapproved entirely of Drake’s proceedings in\r\nthe Pacific, and other expeditions of a wantonly aggressive character.\r\n\r\n[430] Hatfield Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[431] Sadler State Papers.\r\n\r\n[432] The intention, however, was not carried out. In the summer Lord\r\nShrewsbury wrote to Lady Burghley asking her to prevail upon her husband\r\nto obtain the Queen’s permission for Mary Stuart to go to Buxton and\r\nChatsworth. Lady Burghley in her reply suggests that the Queen was angry\r\nand refused. Mary, however, did go to Buxton later, but not to Chatsworth.\r\n\r\n[433] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth. Burghley’s interest in naval\r\naffairs was great. He had, when danger threatened from Alba, in the\r\nsummer of 1578, elaborated a scheme for the mobilisation of the navy,\r\nand had put fourteen ships into commission. The Council appear to have\r\naddressed to him most of their minutes respecting naval organisation,\r\ninstead of to the Lord Admiral.\r\n\r\n[434] The Duke Hans Casimir was in England at the time (January 1580),\r\nand took a large sum of money back with him for the purpose in question.\r\n\r\n[435] This was actually the case at the time so far as Scotland itself\r\nas apart from Mary was concerned. There is in the Hatfield Papers of\r\nthis date (1580) a fervent appeal from James VI. to the King of France,\r\nbegging for assistance in force to release his mother, and support him\r\nagainst his heretic subjects. Mendoza also reports (4th September 1580)\r\nthat Guise had just recognised James’s title of King for the first time,\r\nand that intimate relations were being formed between the courts of\r\nScotland and France. This probably arose from the long delay of the reply\r\nfrom Spain to Mary, Guise, and the Archbishop of Glasgow, relative to\r\ntheir offer of complete submission to Philip. The whole matter, however,\r\nwas changed in the following year, and thenceforward Mary and her friends\r\ndepended upon Spain alone.\r\n\r\n[436] In Strype’s “Annals,” _in extenso_.\r\n\r\n[437] Hatfield Papers. Another letter of this period (June 1580) from\r\nSussex to Lord Burghley (Hatfield Papers) shows forcibly the affection\r\nand veneration he felt for him. “I do love, honour, and reverence you\r\nas a father, and do you all the service we can as far as any child you\r\nhave, with heart and hand.… The true fear of God which your actions have\r\nalways shown to be in your heart, the great and deep care you have had\r\nfor the honour and safety of the Queen … and the continual trouble you\r\nhave of long time taken for the benefit of the commonwealth, and the\r\nupright course you have always taken respecting the matter, and not the\r\nperson, in all causes … have tied me to your Lordship in that knot which\r\nno worldly frailty can break.”\r\n\r\n[438] See her letter to Henry III. (Hatfield State Papers, 27th July\r\n1580).\r\n\r\n[439] According to Drake’s statement given in Cooke’s narrative in Vaux,\r\nDrake was presented to the Queen by Walsingham; but Doughty, of whom we\r\nshall speak presently, asserted when he was on his trial that he, who was\r\na great friend of Drake, and private secretary to Hatton, had interested\r\nthe latter in the project, and that it was he who persuaded the Queen to\r\ncountenance Drake.\r\n\r\n[440] 20th June 1578. Doughty confessed that he had given Burghley a plan\r\nof the voyage. It was this, unquestionably, that sealed Doughty’s fate.\r\n\r\n[441] Mendoza writes to the King (23rd October 1580): “Sussex, Burghley,\r\nCrofts, the Admiral, and others insist that the Queen should retain the\r\ntreasure in her own hands in the Tower, and if your Majesty will give\r\nthem the satisfaction they desire about Ireland, the treasure may be\r\nrestored, after reimbursing the adventurers for their outlay.… Leicester\r\nand Hatton advocate that Drake should not be personally punished, nor\r\nmade to restore the plunder if the business is carried before the\r\ntribunals. The fine excuse they give is that there is nothing in the\r\ntreaties between the countries which prohibits Englishmen from going to\r\nthe Indies.”\r\n\r\n[442] Spanish State Papers.\r\n\r\n[443] D’Ewes’ Journal.\r\n\r\n[444] Sir Walter Mildmay introduced a bill in this Parliament by which\r\nreconciliation to Rome should be punishable as high treason, the saying\r\nof mass by a fine of 200 marks and a year’s imprisonment, and the hearing\r\nof mass half that penalty. Absence from church was to be punished by a\r\nfine of £20 a month, and unlicensed schoolmasters were to be imprisoned\r\nfor a year. The bill met with much opposition by the Lords and by\r\nBurghley’s party, and was somewhat lessened in severity before it became\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\n[445] How entirely Elizabeth herself depended upon the Burghley policy\r\nnow, is proved by a remark reported by Mendoza (27th February). D’Aubigny\r\nwas quite paramount in Scotland, and Morton was in prison, his doom\r\npractically sealed. Mendoza reports that the Earl of Huntingdon,\r\nLeicester’s brother-in-law, Warden of the Marches, had connived at a\r\nraid of Borderers into England as far as Carlisle, where some Englishmen\r\nwere killed, in order that he might have an excuse for crossing into\r\nScotland and attacking Morton’s enemies. When the Queen heard of this\r\nshe was extremely angry. “What is this I hear about Scotland?” she asked\r\nWalsingham. “Did I order anything of this sort to be done?” Walsingham\r\nminimised the affair. The answer was, “You Puritan! you will never be\r\ncontent until you drive me into war on all sides, and bring the King of\r\nSpain on to me.” (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.)\r\n\r\n[446] It consisted of two very young princes of the blood sent for\r\nappearance’ sake, Francis de Bourbon, Dauphin d’Auvergne, and Charles de\r\nBourbon, Count de Soissons; Marshal de Cossé, Pinart, La Mothe Fénélon,\r\nBrisson, and a great number of courtiers of rank. So desirous was\r\nElizabeth that they should be impressed with the splendour of her court,\r\nthat she ordered that the London mercers should sell their fine stuffs\r\nat a reduction of 25 per cent. in order that the courtiers might be\r\nhandsomely dressed.\r\n\r\n[447] Lodge, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[448] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[449] Hatfield Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[450] Hatfield Papers, part ii.\r\n\r\n[451] Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris: _Fonds français_, 3308.\r\n\r\n[452] In addition to the letter of the Queen, there is another document\r\nsigned by the Ambassadors and by the English Council, saying that the\r\nterms shall not be considered binding upon the Queen, unless within six\r\nweeks she and Alençon report in writing to the King of France that they\r\nhave arranged certain personal questions to their mutual satisfaction.\r\nBoth documents are printed _in extenso_ in Digges.\r\n\r\n[453] Spanish Calendar, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[454] The real reason for the Queen’s ostentatious slighting of Mendoza\r\nat the time was to draw the King of France on, and make him believe that\r\nshe was willing to break with Spain.\r\n\r\n[455] Walsingham to the Queen: “fearing lest when he should be embarqued\r\nyour Majesty would slip the collar” (Walsingham Papers).

For their actions are not matters of\r\nreligion, but merely of state, tending directly to the deprivation of her\r\nMajesty’s crown.” Campion, he says, had been brought before Leicester and\r\nBromley, but had not confessed anything of importance. It appears to have\r\nbeen the result of the admissions wrung from Campion and others about\r\nthis time as to the houses in which they had lodged that led to the great\r\nnumber of Catholic arrests all over England.\r\n\r\n[466] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[467] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[468] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[469] Ralegh was certainly known to Leicester before this.

Nicholas Faunt\r\nwrites to Anthony Bacon (Bacon Papers, vol. i.): “There has been a fray\r\nbetween my Lord of Oxford and Knyvett, who are both hurt, but Lord Oxford\r\nmore dangerously. You know,” he adds, “Master Knyvett is not meanly\r\nbeloved at court, and therefore is not likely to speed ill, whatsoever\r\nthe quarrel be.” There is also a most interesting letter from Burghley\r\nto Hatton (12th March 1582, B. M. MSS., Add. 91), in which he begs him\r\nto intercede with the Queen for Oxford, and recites the whole of the\r\naccusations against him.\r\n\r\n[473] State Papers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[474] Mary to Beton, 18th November 1582 (Spanish State Papers).\r\n\r\n[475] Harl.

But on the following\r\nday (17th April 1583) Beale wrote to Lord Burghley (Harl. MSS., 4663),\r\nsaying that she had abandoned all ambition, she was old and ill, and was\r\nready to swear to anything for her liberation. This, however, was before\r\nshe received Mendoza’s letter (6th May?) advising her on no account to\r\naccept her release (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth).\r\n\r\n[481] The Queen had nicknames for most of her friends; Burghley was the\r\nLeviathan or the Spirit, Hatton was Bellwether or Lyddes, Walsingham was\r\nMoon, Alençon was Frog, Simier was Ape, Ralegh was Water, Leicester was\r\nSweet Robin, and so forth.\r\n\r\n[482] Printed in Dr. Nares’ Life of Burghley.\r\n\r\n[483] See letter from a Scottish gentleman to De Maineville, 13th July\r\n(Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth), and Mary to Mendoza, of same date\r\n(_ibid._).\r\n\r\n[484] See letter of Castelnau to Henry III., 1st July; _in extenso_ in\r\nChéruel’s _Marie Stuart_. How completely Mary distrusted the French and\r\nCastelnau at the time, notwithstanding her cordial letters to them, may\r\nbe seen by a paragraph in her letter to Mendoza of 13th July (Spanish\r\nState Papers). The recognition of James as King by La Mothe’s embassy had\r\nconfirmed Mary’s determination to depend only upon the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n[485] One of Elizabeth’s movements as soon as she heard the news was\r\nto summon Lord Arbroath, the eldest of the Hamiltons, from France, to\r\nproceed to Scotland in her pay. See letter, Mary to Castelnau, September\r\n(Hatfield Papers), and Mendoza to the King, 19th August (Spanish State\r\nPapers).\r\n\r\n[486] Guise sent Persons (alias Melino) to the Pope in August, giving\r\nhim an account of his plans. Four thousand Spaniards were to land at\r\nDalton-in-Furness, Lancashire, whilst Guise made a descent on Sussex,\r\nsimultaneously with a rising of Catholics in the North of England and on\r\nthe Scottish Border (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, 22nd August).\r\n\r\n[487] Walsingham’s disinclination to undertake the mission is quite\r\ncomprehensible. He was at the time engaged in a complicated intrigue with\r\nthe triple traitor Archibald Douglas, by which he learnt the secrets of\r\nMary Stuart; and at the same time he and Leicester were making approaches\r\nto Mary Stuart and James, for a marriage between the latter and Lady\r\nDorothy Devereux, the step-daughter of Leicester, on condition of James\r\nbeing declared the heir of England. See letters from Mary to Castelnau,\r\nSeptember 1583 (Hatfield Papers, part iii.), and Mendoza to the King,\r\n13th March 1583 (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth); also Castelnau to\r\nHenry, 1st January 1584 (Harl. MSS., 1582), and the same to Mary (Harl.\r\nMSS., 387). The heads of Walsingham’s instructions are in Hatfield\r\nPapers, part iii.\r\n\r\n[488] Mendoza to the King, 19th August (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth).\r\n\r\n[489] Many of her compromising letters to Mendoza were intercepted and\r\nread. Mary herself, writing to Elizabeth from Tutbury (29th September\r\n1584), thanking her for her change of lodging, protests against the\r\nstoppage of her correspondence with the French Ambassador Castelnau. “All\r\nthat I write,” she says, “passes through the hands of your people, who\r\nsee, read, examine, and keep back in order to point out to me any fault\r\nif they find in it anything offensive or injurious to you” (Harl. MSS.,\r\n4651). This was more true than Mary thought when she wrote it, for she\r\nhad no idea that some of her more compromising letters to the Spaniards\r\nwere read. A letter from Mary to Sir Francis Englefield, Philip’s English\r\nSecretary (9th October 1584), contains the following dangerous words: “Of\r\nthe treaty between the Queen of England and me I may neither hope nor\r\nlook for good issue. Whatsoever shall come of me, by whatsoever change of\r\nmy state and condition, let the execution of the great plot go forward\r\nwithout any respect of peril or danger to me.” And she continues by\r\nsaying that the plan (_i.e._ the rising and invasion) must take place at\r\nlatest next spring or the cause will be ruined.\r\n\r\n[490] There are several reasons for believing that the prosecution\r\nof Somerville, the Ardens, Throgmorton, and others, was not entirely\r\nhonest on the part of Leicester. Somerville was obviously a madman,\r\nand was strangled in his cell; the estates of Arden, whose wife was a\r\nThrogmorton, went to enrich a creature of Leicester; and the priest,\r\nHall, on whose evidence the prisoners were condemned, was quietly\r\nsmuggled out of the country by Leicester’s favour. Although it is\r\npossible that Throgmorton may have participated in Guise’s murder plot—he\r\ncertainly did in the invasion plot—there is no satisfactory evidence to\r\nprove it.\r\n\r\n[491] Hatfield State Papers, part iii.\r\n\r\n[492] How keenly Whitgift felt the attacks upon him for doing what\r\nhe conceived to be his duty, may be seen by his letters in Strype’s\r\nWhitgift. In a letter to Anthony Bacon (Birch’s Elizabeth) he writes: “I\r\nam, thank God, exercised with like calumnies at home also; but I comfort\r\nmyself that lies and false rumours cannot long prevail. In matters of\r\nreligion I remain the same, and so intend to do by God’s grace during\r\nlife; wherein I am daily more and more confirmed by the uncharitable and\r\nindirect practices, as well by the common adversary the Papist, as also\r\nof some of our wayward, unquiet, and discontented brethren.”\r\n\r\n[493] Hatfield State Papers, part iii.\r\n\r\n[494] Even whilst the bill was passing through Parliament, however, the\r\neffects of his moderation were seen. In March twenty Catholic priests and\r\none layman, either convicted or accused of treason, were released from\r\nprison and sent to France. Father Howard himself told Mendoza that he was\r\nat a loss to account for this leniency.\r\n\r\n[495] He certainly was not benefited in purse; for one of the first\r\nthings Parry did was to borrow fifty crowns of the young man, which he\r\nnever returned (Birch’s Elizabeth). In the correspondence of Sir Thomas\r\nCopley with Burghley at this period (1579-80), Parry is presented in a\r\nmore favourable light than that in which he is usually regarded, and so\r\nfar as can be judged by his letters he retained the Lord Treasurer’s\r\nesteem almost to the time of his arrest.\r\n\r\n[496] Mendoza, writing to Philip from Paris at the time, says that this\r\nletter was forged (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth), but in any case the\r\nletter did not necessarily imply approval of murder.\r\n\r\n[497] Hatfield Papers, part iii.\r\n\r\n[498] Harl.

The latter\r\neven had the meanness to allege that it was mainly owing to Davison’s\r\npersuasion that he accepted the sovereignty, and Davison was disgraced\r\nand banished from court for a time in consequence. See Sir Philip\r\nSidney’s letters to Davison (Harl. MSS., 285).\r\n\r\n[509] Cotton, Galba, cx. (Leycester Correspondence).\r\n\r\n[510] Harl. MSS., 6994 (Edwards’ “Letters of Ralegh”).\r\n\r\n[511] Amongst many other proofs may be mentioned her letter to Charles\r\nPaget, 27th July 1586 (Hatfield Papers, part iii.), in which she says:\r\n“Upon Ballard’s return the principal Catholics who had despatched him\r\noversea imparted to her their intentions;” but she advises that “nothing\r\nis to be stirred on this side until they have full assurance and promise\r\nfrom the Pope and Spain.” In another letter of the same date to Mendoza\r\nshe says that although she had turned a deaf ear for six months to\r\nthe various overtures made to her by the Catholics, now that she had\r\nheard of the intentions of the King of Spain, she had consented thereto\r\n(Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, part iii.). Again, on the same day, she\r\ninstructed the French Ambassador to ask Burghley to be careful in the\r\nchoice of a new guardian for her, “so that whatever happen, whether it be\r\nthe death of the Queen of England, or a rebellion in the country, my life\r\nmay be safe” (Labanoff).\r\n\r\n[512] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, vol. iii. The reference to Parma\r\napplies to certain negotiations for peace which had been attempted by\r\nAndrea de Looe, Agostino Graffini, and William Bodenham. In a statement\r\nfurnished by an English agent to Philip in November, it is also asserted\r\nthat these negotiations were initiated by Burghley “who was always\r\nagainst the war.”\r\n\r\n[513] Mendoza wrote to Philip (8th November): “When Cecil saw the papers\r\n(taken in Mary’s rooms) he told the Queen that now that she had so great\r\nan advantage, if she did not proceed with all rigour at once against the\r\nQueen of Scotland, he himself would seek her friendship. These words are\r\nworthy of so clever a man as he is, and were intended to lead the other\r\nCouncillors to follow him in holding the Queen of England back.” It is\r\nevident from this that Mendoza did not consider Cecil to be Mary’s enemy.\r\n\r\n[514] Babington, Savage, Ballard, Barnewell, Tylney, Tichbourne, and\r\nAbingdon were executed at St. Giles-in-the-Fields on the 20th September.\r\nMendoza says that as Babington’s heart was being torn out he was\r\ndistinctly heard to pronounce the word “Jesus” thrice.\r\n\r\n[515] State Papers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[516] Camden.\r\n\r\n[517] Davison, who had just been appointed an additional Secretary of\r\nState, wrote to Burghley from Windsor (5th October) that the Queen did\r\nnot like the wording, “Tam per Maria filiam et hæredem Jacobi quinti\r\nnuper Scotorū Regis ac communiter vocatam Scotorū Regis et dotare\r\nFranciæ.” She wished it to be, “Tam per Maria filiam &c. … Scotorū Regis\r\net dotare Franciæ _communiter vocata Regina Scotorū_.” Thus it is seen\r\nthat, although Elizabeth made no difficulty about acknowledging Mary as\r\nQueen Dowager of France, she would not recognise her as of right Queen of\r\nScots. Davison adds that she was sending a special messenger to Burghley\r\nto discuss the matter with him.\r\n\r\n[518] He was the secret means of communication between Mendoza and his\r\nspies in England.\r\n\r\n[519] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[520] Nau and Curll, the two Secretaries, had been closely examined\r\nby Burghley in London, and at first had denied everything, but\r\nsubsequently when confronted with their own handwriting, were obliged\r\nto acknowledge—especially Nau—Mary’s cognisance of Babington’s plans.\r\nNau afterwards (1605) endeavoured to minimise his admissions, but Mary’s\r\nletter to Mendoza (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, 23rd November) which\r\nwas not delivered or opened until long after Mary’s death, leaves no\r\ndoubt whatever that Mary considered he had betrayed her. Curll lived\r\nfor the rest of his life on a handsome pension from Spain, but Nau\r\ngot nothing. Mary’s first answer to her accusers, that she was a free\r\nprincess and not subject to Elizabeth’s tribunal, had been foreseen by\r\nBeale (see his opinion, Harl. MSS., 4646).\r\n\r\n[521] Queen to Burghley, 12th October (Cotton, Caligula, cix.).\r\n\r\n[522] Camden Annals, and Life of Sir Thomas Egerton.\r\n\r\n[523] Hatfield Papers, part iii.\r\n\r\n[524] Howell’s State Trials. Burghley writes to Davison (15th October,\r\nCotton, Caligula): “She has only denied the accusations. Her intention\r\nwas to move pity by long artificial speeches, to lay all blame upon the\r\nQueen’s Majesty, or rather upon the Council, that all the troubles past\r\ndid ensue from them, avowing her reasonable offers and our refusals. And\r\nin these speeches I did so encounter her with reasons out of my knowledge\r\nand experience, as she hath not the advantage she looked for. And, as\r\nI am assured, the auditory did find her case not pitiable, and her\r\nallegations untrue.”\r\n\r\n[525] Hollingshead.\r\n\r\n[526] Mary to Mendoza, 24th November (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth,\r\npart iii.).\r\n\r\n[527] Paris Archives; _in extenso_ in Von Raumer.\r\n\r\n[528] Philip’s secret agent in London wrote at the time urging that “a\r\nmessage should be sent from Spain to the Lord Treasurer, who is the\r\nruling spirit in all this business, and is desirous of peace, to let him\r\nknow that your Majesty wished for his friendship” (Spanish State Papers,\r\nElizabeth, part iii.).\r\n\r\n[529] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, part iii.\r\n\r\n[530] Bellièvre did not arrive in England until 1st December. An account\r\nof his embassy will be found printed in Labanoff. The regular Ambassador,\r\nChateauneuf, did his best, for he was a Guisan, but Elizabeth flatly\r\ntold him she believed he was exceeding his instructions. His own doubts\r\nas to his master’s real wishes are expressed in a letter to D’Esneval in\r\nParis (20th October): “Je vous prie me mander privément, ou ouvertement,\r\nl’intention de Sa Majesté sur les choses de deça; car il me semble que\r\nl’on se soucie fort peu de par dela du fait de la Reine d’Ecosse.”\r\nDavison wrote to Burghley at Fotheringay (8th October), telling him of\r\nthe “presumption” of Chateauneuf’s first remonstrance, and the rebuke\r\nsent to him by the Queen “for attempting to school her in her actions.”\r\n\r\n[531] Mendoza to Philip, 7th December (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth,\r\npart iii.).\r\n\r\n[532] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth, part iii. In a marginal note to\r\nanother letter, Philip himself expresses an opinion that Bellièvre has\r\ngone, not to save Mary’s life, but for another purpose.\r\n\r\n[533] See Lord Burghley’s notes of this appeal for his reply thereto\r\n(Hatfield State Papers, part iii.); and also Elizabeth’s own most\r\ninteresting letter to Henry III. (Harl. MSS., 4647). She ends by a hit\r\nat Henry’s helpless position: “I beg you, therefore, rather to think of\r\nthe means of preserving than of diminishing my friendship. Your States,\r\nmy good brother, cannot bear many enemies; do not for God’s sake give\r\nthe rein to wild horses, lest they throw you from your seat.” Another\r\ncharacteristic step taken in England at the same time was to concoct\r\na bogus plot to murder Elizabeth, in which it was pretended that the\r\nAmbassador Chateauneuf was concerned. This gave an opportunity for\r\nmuch anger and complaint on the part of Elizabeth, especially against\r\nthe Guises; and in Lord Burghley’s memoranda giving reasons for Mary’s\r\nexecution, this so-called plot of Stafford, Moody, and Destrappes is\r\ngravely set forth as a contributing factor.\r\n\r\n[534] Gray’s own feelings in the matter may be seen by his copious\r\ncorrespondence with Archibald Douglas, at Hatfield. He had, when he was\r\nin Flanders, proposed that Mary might be put out of the way by poison,\r\nand was hated by Mary’s friends in consequence. “If she die,” he said, “I\r\nshall be blamed, and if she live I shall be ruined;” but he was forced\r\nagainst his will to accept the embassy and acted in a similar way to\r\nBellièvre—pleaded with strong words but weak arguments, in order that his\r\nown position might be saved whether Mary lived or died.\r\n\r\n[535] Mendoza to Philip, 24th January 1587 (Spanish State Papers,\r\nElizabeth, vol. iv.).\r\n\r\n[536] The matter is fully discussed in Nicolas’s Life of Davison.\r\n\r\n[537] It is curious that the warning should come from Howard, a Catholic\r\nand a Conservative, several of whose relatives were Spanish pensioners.\r\n\r\n[538] Hatfield Papers, part iii. There is no mention of the poison letter\r\nto Paulet, but it was written, and is printed in Nicolas’s Life of\r\nDavison, with Paulet’s reply.\r\n\r\n[539] The Queen kept up a pretence of anger against the Councillors for\r\nsome time, and especially against Burghley, who on the 13th February\r\nwrote her a submissive letter praying for her favour. He was excluded\r\nfrom her presence, and complains that she “doth utter more heavy, hard,\r\nbitter, and minatory speeches against me than against any other,” which\r\nhe ascribes to the calumnies of his many enemies, and to the fact that\r\nhe alone was not allowed to justify his action personally to her. “I\r\nhave,” he says, “confusedly uttered my griefs, being glad that the night\r\nof my age is so near by service and sickness as I shall not long wake to\r\nsee the miseries that I fear others shall see that are like to overwatch\r\nme.” When at length he obtained audience of the Queen, she treated him\r\nso harshly that he again retired, and was only induced to return again\r\nby the intercession of Hatton. Elizabeth’s special anger with Burghley\r\nmay have been an elaborate pretence agreed upon between them, or, what is\r\nmore probable, the result of some calumnies of Leicester.\r\n\r\n[540] An interesting statement of Burghley’s treatment of Davison in\r\nlater years will be found in Harl. MSS., 290. Part of his unrelenting\r\nattitude to him is commonly attributed to Burghley’s desire to secure\r\nthe Secretaryship of State for his son, Sir Robert Cecil. It is evident,\r\nhowever, that Davison was adopted by Essex as one of his instruments to\r\noppose Burghley’s policy, and the restoration of Davison would thereafter\r\nhave meant a defeat for the Cecils. This, it appears to me, amply\r\nexplains the Lord Treasurer’s attitude.\r\n\r\n[541] Hatfield Papers, part iii. 223.\r\n\r\n[542] That Lord Burghley was desirous of dissociating himself personally\r\nfrom the execution, and of remaining on good terms with the Catholic\r\nparty, is further seen by a remark made in a letter from Mendoza to\r\nPhilip (26th March 1587): “Cecil, the Lord Treasurer, said publicly that\r\nhe was opposed to the execution, and on this and all other points feeling\r\nwas running very high in the Council; Cecil and Leicester being open\r\nopponents” (Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth).\r\n\r\n[543] Walsingham, conveying this news to Leicester in Flanders (17th\r\nApril), says: “There are letters written from certain of my Lords, by her\r\nMajesty’s effectual command, to inhibit him (Drake) to attempt anything\r\nby land or within the ports of Spain.” On the 11th he wrote: “This\r\nresolution proceedeth altogether upon a hope of peace, which I fear may\r\ndo much harm.”\r\n\r\n[544] The first hint to this effect reached Philip too late to be useful.\r\nIt was conveyed by Mendoza from Stafford in Paris on the 19th April, the\r\nday that Drake reached Cadiz.\r\n\r\n[545] Foreign Office Records, Flanders, 32.\r\n\r\n[546] This was the great galleon _San Felipe_, one of the richest prizes\r\never brought to England.\r\n\r\n[547] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[548] His mother, the owner of Burghley, had just died, aged eighty-five;\r\nand his unmanageable son-in-law, the Earl of Oxford, still caused\r\nhim endless trouble. His only family consolation at the time was the\r\npromise of his favourite son, Sir Robert Cecil, whose great talents\r\nand application were already remarkable. How incessant and varied Lord\r\nBurghley’s labours still were may be seen by the great number of letters\r\naddressed to him, entreating him for help, influence, or advice. The\r\nCatholic Earl of Arundel from the Tower, the Earl of Huntingdon, Lord\r\nBuckhurst, Lord Cobham, and a host of other nobles appealed to him to\r\nforward their suits; Puritan divines like Hammond, Cartwright, Humphreys,\r\nand Travers; prelates like Whitgift, Aylmer, Herbert, and Sandys, by\r\ncommon accord chose him as the arbiter of their constant disputes. The\r\nCourt of Wards, too, entailed a large correspondence and much personal\r\nattention; whilst at this period Burghley was also deeply concerned\r\nin checking the tendency of Cambridge students to indulge in “satin\r\ndoublets, silk and velvet overstocks, great fine ruffs, and costly\r\nfacings to their gowns.”\r\n\r\n[549] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[550] As instances see letters—Ralegh to Burghley, 27th December 1587\r\n(State Papers, Domestic, ccvi. 40); Howard to Burghley, 22nd December\r\n(State Papers, Domestic, ccvi. 42); same to same (Harl. MSS., 6994,\r\n102); Burghley’s own holograph list of ships and their destinations,\r\n5th January 1588; Hawkins to Burghley, 18th January 1588 (both in State\r\nPapers, Domestic, cviii.); and many similar papers of this period in\r\nState Papers, Domestic, cviii., and Harl. MSS., 6994.\r\n\r\n[551] Stafford told Mendoza (25th February) that Burghley had written to\r\nhim saying, that he would do his best to prevent Drake from sailing, as\r\nhis voyages were only profitable to himself and his companions, but an\r\ninjury to the Queen and an irritation to foreign princes; and in May,\r\nBurghley told Stafford that if he had remained out of town two days\r\nlonger, his colleagues would have let Drake go.\r\n\r\n[552] Hatfield Papers, part iii.\r\n\r\n[553] Spanish State Papers, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n[554] This mission was said to have been entrusted originally to Paulet,\r\nand afterwards to Herbert; but as they did not go to Flanders, it is more\r\nlikely to have been left to Crofts. I can, however, find no record of it\r\nexcept in Spanish account.\r\n\r\n[555] The Commissioners were the Earl of Derby, Lord Cobham, Sir James\r\nCrofts, with Valentine Dale and Rogers. Burghley’s son, Sir Robert Cecil,\r\nwas also attached. The whole correspondence of the Commissioners, mostly\r\ndirected to Lord Burghley, will be found in Cotton, Vesp., cviii.\r\n\r\n[556] Motley thought that Burghley was referred to, but surely Howard\r\nwould not call him witless. Probably Crofts is meant.\r\n\r\n[557] State Papers, Domestic, ccix.\r\n\r\n[558] Howard, writing on the 13th June to Walsingham, says: “I forbear to\r\nwrite unto my Lord Treasurer because I am sure he is a very heavy man for\r\nmy lady his daughter, for which I am most heartily sorry.”\r\n\r\n[559] Writing to Walsingham, “from my house near the Savoy,” 17th July,\r\nhe says: “I am at present by last night’s torment weakened in spirits, as\r\nI am not able to rise out of my bed; which is my grief the more, because\r\nI cannot come thither where both my mind and duty do require;” and yet on\r\nthe same day he (Burghley) sent a long minute corrected with his own hand\r\nto Darrell, giving directions for the victualling of the navy.\r\n\r\n[560] In September, when the news came of the flight of the Armada, grand\r\nreviews of these forces were held previous to their being disbanded.\r\nLord Chancellor Hatton entertained the Queen at dinner in Holborn, and\r\nhis hundred men-at-arms in red and yellow paraded before her Majesty.\r\nThe next day (20th August) a similar ceremony took place at Cecil House,\r\nand shortly afterwards Leicester’s troop was reviewed. But they were all\r\nthrown into the shade by Essex’s splendid force of sixty musketeers and\r\nsixty mounted harquebussiers, in orange-tawny, with white silk facings,\r\nand two hundred light horsemen, in orange velvet and silver.\r\n\r\n[561] See his letter, 30th July (O.S.), to his father, giving him an\r\naccount from hearsay of what had happened off Calais (State Papers,\r\nDomestic, ccxiii.).\r\n\r\n[562] The ordinary Arabic numbers were never used by Burghley, even in\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n[563] One of the last letters that Leicester wrote was to Burghley, from\r\nMaidenhead, two days only before his death, asking for some favour for\r\na friend, Sir Robert Jermyn, and apologising for leaving court without\r\ntaking leave of the Lord Treasurer; and in November the widowed Countess\r\nof Leicester—the mother of Essex—wrote begging Burghley to use his\r\ninfluence with the Queen to buy a vessel belonging to her late husband.\r\n\r\n[564] Lord Burghley’s memoranda (State Papers, Domestic). For particulars\r\nof the expedition see “The Year after the Armada,” by the present writer.\r\n\r\n[565] Don Antonio had been deceived so often in England, that although\r\npreparations for the expedition were being made for some months\r\npreviously, he was not convinced that it was really intended for him\r\nuntil the end of the year 1588.\r\n\r\n[566] On the eve of his flight Essex thus explained his action in a\r\nletter to Heneage (Hatfield Papers, part iii. 966): “What my courses have\r\nbeen I need not repeat, for no man knoweth them better than yourself.\r\nWhat my state now is I will tell you. My revenue is no greater than when\r\nI sued my livery, my debts at least two or three and twenty thousand\r\npounds. Her Majesty’s goodness has been so great I could not ask her for\r\nmore; no way left to repair myself but mine own adventure, which I had\r\nmuch rather undertake than offend her Majesty with suits, as I have done.\r\nIf I speed well, I will adventure to be rich; if not, I will not live to\r\nsee the end of my poverty.”\r\n\r\n[567] His entry in his diary recording the fact runs thus: “1589. April\r\n4 _Die Veneris inter hor 3 et 4 mane obdormit in Domino, Mildreda Domina\r\nBurgley_.” She is interred at Westminster Abbey, with her daughter the\r\nCountess of Oxford; a very long Latin inscription is on the tomb, written\r\nby Burghley, recording their many virtues and the writer’s grief at their\r\nloss. There is at Hatfield (part iii. 973) a note of the mourners and\r\narrangements for the funeral in Lord Burghley’s handwriting.\r\n\r\n[568] MSS. Lansdowne, ciii. 51.\r\n\r\n[569] This is a not unnatural mistake under the circumstances for 9th\r\nApril 1589. The year then began on the 1st April, and in his sorrow Lord\r\nBurghley had overlooked the change of year. More than a month after this\r\nhe wrote a letter, full of grief still, to his old friend the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury, by which we see that he was still living in retirement in one\r\nof the lodges of his park at Theobalds, as it is signed “From my poore\r\nlodge neare my howss at Theobalds, 27 Maii 1589. _P.S._ The Queene is at\r\nBarn Elms, but this night I will attend on her at Westminster, for I am\r\nno man mete for feastings.”\r\n\r\n[570] For the particulars of the Catholic plots of Huntly, Crawford,\r\nErrol, Claud Hamilton, and Bothwell (Stuart), see Spanish State Papers,\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\n[571] State Papers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[572] The Vidame de Chartres was the Huguenot agent in Elizabeth’s\r\ncourt for some years, and was constantly craving aid for the cause. His\r\npromises of repayment were very rarely kept, as the Huguenots had most of\r\nthe wealth of France against them. Hence the saying quoted.\r\n\r\n[573] Egerton MSS., 359.\r\n\r\n[574] “November 30. I have heard a rumour that you have arrived at\r\nCalais, and that if the enemy comes to attack that place you will be\r\nthere with troops to defend it. If this news be true I pray you let me\r\nhear it from yourself, and advertise me by the ordinary courier what the\r\nenemy is doing and what you think of these designs. For I shall be very\r\nhappy to see some opportunity by which we could together win honour and\r\nserve the common weal. I am idle here, and have nothing to do but to\r\nhearken for such opportunities.” (Essex to La Noue; Hatfield Papers, part\r\niii.)\r\n\r\n[575] Hatfield Papers, part iv.\r\n\r\n[576] A letter from Sir John Smith to Burghley, 28th January 1590,\r\nexpresses sorrow “to hear that you were very dangerously sick, being\r\nnext unto her Majesty, in my opinion, the pillar and upholder of the\r\nCommonwealth. Howbeit, I am now very glad to hear you have recovered your\r\nhealth;” to which the Lord Treasurer appends the note “relatio falsæ”\r\n(Hatfield Papers, part iv.). Later in the year, however (October), the\r\nClerk of the Privy Seal, writing to Lord Talbot, says, “I never knew my\r\nLord Treasurer more lusty or fresh in hue than at this hour.” How heavily\r\nbusiness still pressed upon the Lord Treasurer is seen by a remark of\r\nhis in a letter to Mr. Grimstone (January 1591): “The cause” (of his not\r\nhaving written) “is partly for that I have not leisure, being, as it\r\nwere, roundly besieged with affairs to be answered from north, south,\r\neast, and west; whereof I hope shortly to be delivered by supply of some\r\nto take charge as her Majesty’s principal secretary” (Bacon Papers,\r\nBirch).\r\n\r\n[577] Soon afterwards, Essex was at issue with Robert Cecil about the\r\nappointment of a successor to one of Heneage’s offices (Essex to Sir\r\nHenry Unton; Hatfield Papers, part iv.). How bitter Essex was against the\r\nCecils is shown by a letter from him to Sir Henry Unton in Paris (June\r\n1591): “Things do remain in the same state as they did. They who are most\r\nin appetite are not yet satisfied, whereof there is great discontentment.\r\nIf it stand at this stay awhile longer they will despair, _for their\r\nchief hour-glass hath little sand left in it, and doth run out still_.”\r\n\r\n[578] In one of the letters suggested by the secret intelligence\r\nsecretary, Phillips, to be written to English Catholics abroad (31st\r\nAugust 1591), Robert Cecil’s appointment to the Council is noted; “but\r\nthe Queen seems determined against Robert Cecil for the Secretaryship;\r\nbut my Lord being sick, the whole management of the Secretary’s place\r\nis in his (Robert’s) hands, and as he is already a Councillor, any\r\nemployment of him between the Queen and his father will be the means of\r\ninstalling him in the place” (State Papers, Domestic).\r\n\r\n[579] He expressed this wish as soon as Essex’s opposition to Robert\r\nCecil’s appointment became manifest. A letter (State Papers, Domestic)\r\nfrom Hatton, 15th July 1590, thus refers to the matter: “We can\r\nwell witness your endless travails, which in her Majesty’s princely\r\nconsideration she should relieve you of; but it is true the affairs\r\nare in good hands, as we all know, and thereby her Majesty is the more\r\nsure, and we her poor servants the better satisfied. God send you help\r\nand happiness to your better contentment.” Nearly all through 1590 and\r\n1591 repeated reference is made in his correspondence to Burghley’s\r\ninfirmities. This, added to the everlasting disputes between the\r\nPrelatists and the Puritans, in which he was between two fires, and the\r\ngalling opposition of Essex to his son’s appointment, might well have\r\nexcused his desire to be relieved of his heavy burden.\r\n\r\n[580] Bacon Papers, Birch. Sir John Norris had recently gone to Brittany\r\nwith a small English auxiliary force, and had captured Guingamp. There\r\nwere also 600 Englishmen in Normandy and an English squadron on the\r\nBrittany coast. Burghley holds out hopes also of sending 600 more men to\r\nBrittany.\r\n\r\n[581] Henry wrote one of his clever characteristic letters to Elizabeth\r\n(5th August), expressing in fervent terms his delight at hearing of her\r\nintention of coming to Portsmouth during his visit to Normandy. He swears\r\neternal gratitude, and begs her to allow him to run across the Channel;\r\n“et baiser les mains comme Roi de Navarre, et etre aupres d’elle deux\r\nheures, a fin que j’aie ce bien d’avoir veu, au moins une fois, en ma\r\nvie, celle a qui j’ai consacré et corps et tant ce que j’aurai jamais;\r\net que j’aime et révère plus que chose que soit au monde.” Referring\r\nto Essex’s force, he says: “Le secours que qu’il vous a pleu à présent\r\nm’accorder m’est en singulière grace, pour la qualité de celluy auquel\r\nvous avez donné la principale charge, et pour la belle force dont il est\r\ncomposé.” (Hatfield Papers, part iv.)\r\n\r\n[582] The Earl’s brother, Walter Devereux, was killed in the siege.\r\n\r\n[583] Essex seems to have quarrelled with every one in France, and the\r\nCouncil in England condemned his proceedings from the first. In a letter\r\nto the Council (September) he says the whole purport of their letters\r\nis “to rip up all my actions and to reprove them” (Hatfield Papers,\r\npart iv.). The Queen also wrote him a very angry letter (4th October)\r\nconsenting on strict conditions that the English shall only be allowed to\r\nremain a month longer in France.\r\n\r\n[584] From a long letter from Burghley (22nd October), Essex appears to\r\nhave again left his command and run over to England. He begged Burghley\r\nto ask the Queen’s permission for him to join Biron at the siege of\r\nCaudebec. The Lord Treasurer says he had not done so, as he was sure the\r\nQueen would refuse. Her strict orders were that neither Essex nor his men\r\nshould risk themselves at the siege of Havre or elsewhere except by her\r\norders. Essex appears to have disobeyed, and returned to France at once\r\nwithout seeing the Queen. During his absence the Englishmen had deserted\r\nwholesale. Burghley says there were not 2000 of them remaining—they\r\nwere unpaid and mutinous, and, according to Biron and Leighton, were\r\ncommitting outrages on all sides. Beauvoir de Nocle wrote to Essex as\r\nsoon as he had gone back to France (22nd October), “Les courroux de la\r\nreine redoublent.”\r\n\r\n[585] See the Queen’s very angry letter peremptorily recalling him (24th\r\nDecember 1591), (Hatfield Papers, part iv.).\r\n\r\n[586] The heroic but unprofitable result of the expedition was the famous\r\nfight of the _Revenge_ and the death of Sir Richard Grenville, who\r\nquite needlessly, and out of sheer obstinacy, engaged the whole Spanish\r\nsquadron. The great difficulty of getting the expedition together is seen\r\nby the large number of towns which addressed Lord Burghley personally or\r\nthe Council, begging on the score of poverty to be excused from fitting\r\nthe ships, as they had been commanded to do. Southampton, Hull, Yarmouth,\r\nNewcastle, and other towns professed to be so decayed as to be quite\r\nunable to contribute ships (Hatfield Papers, part iv.).\r\n\r\n[587] The reports of spies of plots in Flanders at the time amply\r\njustified the precautionary measures taken. Burghley was still appealed\r\nto by both religious parties, and he appears at this time to have been\r\nclaimed by both. In March 1591 one of the spy-letters suggested by\r\nPhillips to be sent abroad mentions Burghley’s feud with Archbishop\r\nWhitgift and his favour to the Puritans. The Catholic spy in Flanders,\r\nSnowdon, in June of the same year, says that the _anti-Spanish_ English\r\nCatholic refugees there, Lord Vaux, Sir T. Tresham, Mr. Talbot, and Mr.\r\nOwen were opposed to the plots then in progress. “It is said amongst\r\nthem that if occasion be offered they will requite the relaxation now\r\nafforded them by his Lordship’s (Burghley’s) moderation, for it is noted\r\nthat since the cause of the Catholics came to his arbitrament things have\r\ngone on with wonderful suavity” (State Papers, Dom.). On the other hand,\r\nPhillips (in July) tells another spy, St. Mains, of the extravagances of\r\nthe fanatics, Hacket, Coppinger, and Ardington, and speaks of Burghley as\r\nbeing on the side of the Puritans.\r\n\r\n[588] In a spirited reply (Hatfield Papers) to a remonstrance of Antony\r\nStanden, Lord Burghley insists that Catholics who were punished by death\r\nin England are “only those who profess themselves by obedience to the\r\nPope to be no subjects of the Queen; and though their outward pretence\r\nbe to be sent from the seminaries to convert people to their religion,\r\nyet without reconciling them from their obedience to the Queen they never\r\ngive them absolution.” Those, he says, who still retain their allegiance\r\nto the Queen, but simply absent themselves from churches, are only fined\r\nin accordance with the law. The same contention is more elaborately\r\nstated in Lord Burghley’s essay on “The Execution of Justice.” The\r\nexaminations of various spies, giving alarming accounts of the plots\r\nin Flanders at this time to kill the Queen and Burghley (State Papers,\r\nDomestic), afford ample proof that Lord Burghley’s contention as to the\r\naims of the Spanish seminarists was correct.\r\n\r\n[589] Francis Bacon frankly confessed that he adhered to Burghley’s\r\nenemies because he thought it would be for his own personal advantage\r\nas well as for that of the State; and his brother Antony writes (Bacon\r\nPapers): “On the one side, I found nothing but fair words, which make\r\nfools fain, and yet even in those no offer or hopeful assistance of real\r\nkindness, which I thought I might justly expect at the Lord Treasurer’s\r\nhands, who had inned my ten years’ harvest into his own barn.”\r\n\r\n[590] It was during this progress at Oxford that the circumstance thus\r\nrelated by Sir J. Harrington happened: “I may not forget how the Queen in\r\nthe midst of her oration casting her eye aside, and seeing the old Lord\r\nTreasurer standing on his lame feet for want of a stool, she called in\r\nall haste for a stool for him; nor would she proceed in her speech till\r\nshe saw him provided. Then she fell to it again as if there had been no\r\ninterruption.” Harrington says that some one (probably Essex) twitted her\r\nfor doing this on purpose to show off her Latin.\r\n\r\n[591] Writing to Archibald Douglas advising him how to excuse as well\r\nas he might the depredations of Scotsmen on Danish shipping, he says in\r\na postscript, “I write not this in favour of piracies, for I hate all\r\npirates mortally” (Hatfield Papers, part iv.).\r\n\r\n[592] Lansdowne MSS., lxx.\r\n\r\n[593] Lansdowne MSS., lxx., and Hatfield Papers, part iv.\r\n\r\n[594] Through the whole of the autumn and winter Lord Burghley was\r\nbusy in the liquidation and division of the vast plunder brought in\r\nthe carrack. Ralegh had risked every penny he possessed, and came out\r\na loser. The Queen got the lion’s share, and the adventurers, with the\r\nexception of Ralegh, received large bonuses.\r\n\r\n[595] One of Thomas Phillips’ suggested spy-letters to be sent abroad\r\n(22nd March 1591) says that although the Puritan party is the weaker,\r\nEssex has made Ralegh join him in their favour. Ralegh’s Puritan birth\r\nand breeding naturally gave him sympathy for Essex’s party, whilst his\r\nactive temperament and his greed made him in favour of war, especially\r\nwith Spain. His only tie with the Cecils was his early political\r\nconnection. Though he was usually in personal enmity with Essex, his\r\nnatural bent was therefore more in sympathy with Essex’s party than with\r\nthat to which he was supposed to be attached.\r\n\r\n[596] State Papers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[597] Numerous similar instances of this devotion occur in the letters\r\nof Burghley to his son and others. In April 1594 he writes to Sir\r\nRobert from Cecil House, that as her Majesty desires to have him there\r\n(Greenwich) to-day, he will go, if it be her pleasure that he should\r\nleave his other engagements. He then recounts his various duties for\r\nthe day, including sitting all the morning in the Court of Wards, “with\r\nsmall ease and much pain,” and again in the afternoon; the next day he\r\nhad to preside in the Exchequer Chamber, the Star Chamber, &c.; “but if\r\nher Majesty wishes I will leave all. I live in pain, yet spare not to\r\noccupy myself for her Majesty.” In July he writes to his son, “I can\r\naffirm nothing of my amendment, but if my attendance shall be earnestly\r\nrequired I will wear out my time at court as well as where I am” (State\r\nPapers, Domestic). How great and generally recognised his influence still\r\nwas is seen by the depositions of what disaffected persons said of him.\r\nPrestall (Kinnersley’s deposition, State Papers, Domestic, 1591) said\r\n“the Lord Treasurer was the wizard of England, a worldling wishing to\r\nfill his own purse, and good for nobody; so hated that he would not live\r\nlong if anything happened to the Queen.” “The Treasurer led the Queen and\r\nCouncil, and only cared about enriching himself.”\r\n\r\n[598] Declarations of Kinnersley, Young, and Walpole (1594), State\r\nPapers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[599] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[600] In accordance with the practice of the time Burghley doubtless\r\nreceived presents from suitors for office and others (see State Papers,\r\nDomestic); but it is on record that he frequently refused such offerings\r\nwhen they assumed the form of bribes to influence judicial decisions\r\nor questions of account. Above all, there is no proof that he accepted\r\nany bribes from Spain, even when almost every other Councillor of the\r\nQueen was paid by one side or the other. Several mentions are made in\r\nthe Spanish State Papers of the advisability of paying him heavily, and\r\neven sums were allotted for the purpose; but I have not found a single\r\nstatement of his having accepted such payments; although in after years\r\nhis son certainly did so.\r\n\r\n[601] Francis Bacon answered the book in an able pamphlet published the\r\nsame year (1592), called “Observations upon a Libel published in the\r\nPresent Year,” in which Lord Burghley and Sir Robert Cecil are very\r\nhighly lauded.\r\n\r\n[602] One of the loyal English Catholics, St. Mains, writing (January\r\n1593) to Fitzherbert, says that “the Lord Treasurer has been dangerously\r\nill, but is now well recovered, thanks be to God; for the whole state of\r\nthe realm depends upon him. If he go, there is not one about the Queen\r\nable to wield the State as it stands.” The principal Catholic refugees\r\nagainst Spain at this period were Charles Paget, William Gifford, the\r\nTreshams, Hugh Griffith, Dr. Lewis, Bishop of Cassano, the Scottish\r\nCarthusian Bishop of Dunblane, Thomas Morgan, Thomas Hesketh, Nicholas\r\nFitzherbert, &c.\r\n\r\n[603] Francis was member for Middlesex, whilst his brother Antony sat for\r\nWallingford. The Queen remained angry with Francis for many months. It\r\nwas only in September that Essex with the greatest difficulty obtained\r\npermission for him to appear at court (Bacon Papers, Birch).\r\n\r\n[604] Morice was sent to Tutbury Castle and kept there in prison for\r\nsome years for making a speech in this Parliament complaining of the\r\ngrievances of the Puritans. Wentworth was sent to the Tower, and Stevens\r\nand Walsh to the Fleet. Puckering, the Lord Keeper, told the House that\r\nthe Queen had not called it together to make new laws; there were more\r\nthan enough already. “It is, therefore, her Majesty’s pleasure that no\r\ntime be spent therein” (D’Ewes).\r\n\r\n[605] Phillips’ suggestions to Sterrell (State Papers, Domestic).\r\n\r\n[606] Elizabeth seems to have received the first hint of his intention\r\nin May, and Lord Burghley sends an indignant letter to his son about it\r\n(26th May). He ends by saying, “If I may not have some leisure to cure my\r\nhead, I shall shortly ease it in my grave; and yet if her Majesty mislike\r\nmy absence, I will come thither” (Hatfield Papers, part iv.). See also\r\nletters of Sir Thomas Edmunds (State Papers, France, Record Office); and\r\nElizabeth’s curious letters to Henry (July), signed, “Votre tres assurée\r\nsœur si ce soit à la vielle mode: avec la nouvelle je n’ay qui faire, E.\r\nR.” (Hatfield Papers).\r\n\r\n[607] State Papers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[608] How deeply Lady Bacon resented her son’s friendship with Perez is\r\nseen in a letter of hers to Francis Bacon: “I pity your brother; but yet\r\nso long as he pities not himself, but keepeth that bloody Perez, yea,\r\na court companion and a bed companion—a proud, profane, costly fellow,\r\nwhose being about him I verily believe the Lord God doth mislike, and\r\ndoth the less bless your brother in credit and in health. Such wretches\r\nas he is never loved your brother, but for his credit, living upon him”\r\n(Bacon Papers, Birch).\r\n\r\n[609] Nichols’ Progresses, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[610] Burghley appears to have been very dangerously ill a few weeks\r\nafterwards at Windsor. Essex’s spy Standen wrote to his friend Antony\r\nBacon (6th November) that he had gone up to the Lord Treasurer’s lodging\r\nto inquire after his health; but was refused admittance by the servants,\r\nwho told him, however, that his Lordship had rested better than on the\r\nprevious night. Whilst Standen “was going down the stairs, the Queen was\r\nat my back, who, unknown to me, had been visiting my Lord, so I stayed\r\namong the rest to see her Majesty pass. A little while after I met Mr.\r\nCooke, who told me, that true it was that my Lord had somewhat rested the\r\nnight past; but that this morning his Lordship had a very rigorous fit of\r\npain, and dangerous” (Bacon Papers, Birch). We hear from the same source\r\nof similar attacks in December and January following.\r\n\r\n[611] “I hope you will remember,” wrote Raleigh to Howard, “that it is\r\nthe Queen’s honour and safety to assail rather than to defend” (Hatfield\r\nPapers).\r\n\r\n[612] Frobisher was mortally wounded in the assault.\r\n\r\n[613] See the extraordinary letters of Foulis, Cockburn, and other\r\nScottish agents, to Bacon, &c., in the Bacon Papers (Birch). “Mr Bowes,\r\nthe English Ambassador here (in Scotland), is very much scandalised at\r\nthe behaviour of Crato (_i.e._ Burghley) and his son towards me, and\r\nassures me he will remonstrate with the Queen at his return,” writes\r\nFoulis to Bacon (Bacon Papers); and similar expressions in the letters\r\nof other French and Scotch agents show clearly that Essex took care to\r\ncultivate the idea that it was only the Cecils who prevented the adoption\r\nof a generous policy towards them.\r\n\r\n[614] See the many confessions and declarations of spies and informers\r\n(1594) as to alleged plots for the murder of the Queen, Burghley, &c., at\r\nthis time (State Papers, Domestic).\r\n\r\n[615] It was here, and at Eton College, where he was lodged when the\r\ncourt was at Windsor, that he wrote his bitter “Relaciones” against\r\nPhilip. He alleged that men were sent to London to assassinate him, and\r\nwith indefatigable zeal of tongue and pen kept up and increased the\r\nill-feeling in the court against Spain. His copious correspondence with\r\nHenry IV. leaves no doubt whatever either as to the real object of his\r\nmission or the utter baseness with which he executed it.\r\n\r\n[616] See Burghley’s correspondence with Andrada, Da Vega, and others\r\n(State Papers, Domestic), and Mendoza’s references to the same men in the\r\nSpanish State Papers.\r\n\r\n[617] On the way from this examination Sir Robert Cecil and Essex\r\nrode together in a coach. The former—surely to annoy Essex—reverted\r\nto a subject which had caused intense acrimony between the Earl and\r\nthe Cecils for months past, namely, the appointment to the vacant\r\nAttorney-Generalship which Essex was violently urging for Francis\r\nBacon; an appointment to which neither the Queen nor Lord Burghley\r\nwould consent, although the latter was willing for him to have the\r\nSolicitor-Generalship. The abuse and insult heaped upon the Cecils behind\r\ntheir backs on this account by the Earl, by the scoundrel Standen, and\r\nby the Bacons themselves, may be seen in the Bacon Papers (Birch). On\r\nthis occasion the violent rashness and want of tact on the part of\r\nEssex is very clear. Cecil asked him, as if the subject was new, who he\r\nthought would be the best man for the Attorney-Generalship. The Earl was\r\nastonished, and replied that he knew very well, as he, Cecil, was the\r\nprincipal reason why Bacon had not already been appointed. Cecil then\r\nexpressed his surprise that Essex should waste his influence in seeking\r\nthe appointment of a raw youth. Essex flew in a rage, and told Cecil that\r\n_he_ was younger than Francis, and yet he aspired to a much higher post\r\nthan the Attorney-Generalship, _i.e._ the Secretaryship of State, and\r\nthen, quite losing control of himself, swore that he _would_ have the\r\nappointment for Francis, and would “spend all my power, might, authority,\r\nand amity, and with tooth and nail procure the same against whomsoever.”\r\nThe hot-headed Earl foolishly ended by an undisguised threat against\r\nCecil and his father (Bacon Papers), which we may be sure the former,\r\nat least, did not forget, although Essex had quite changed his tone and\r\nwrote quite humbly to Cecil on the matter in the following May (Hatfield\r\nPapers). It is hardly necessary to say that Bacon was disappointed of the\r\nAttorney-Generalship.\r\n\r\n[618] See the extensive correspondence and proceedings in the case (State\r\nPapers, Domestic, and Hatfield Papers).\r\n\r\n[619] Cecil to Windebanke (State Papers, Domestic).\r\n\r\n[620] Great obscurity still surrounds the case. Apart from his own\r\nalleged confession, Lopez’s condemnation depended upon the declarations\r\nof the double spies who were his accomplices, and he solemnly asserted\r\nhis innocence on the scaffold. I have carefully examined all the\r\nevidence—much of it hitherto unknown—and although there is no space to\r\nenter into the matter here, I am personally convinced that the service\r\nthat Lopez was to render was to poison Don Antonio—not the Queen—and\r\nbring about some sort of _modus vivendi_ between England and Spain.\r\n\r\n[621] Bacon Papers, Birch.\r\n\r\n[622] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[623] Hatfield Papers, part iv.\r\n\r\n[624] Correspondence with Burghley, in the Hatfield Papers, part v., and\r\nState Papers, Flanders (Record Office); and with Essex, in Bacon Papers\r\n(Birch). Burghley, apparently to occupy his mind during his illness,\r\nwrote a most elaborate minute, “to be shown to her Majesty when she is\r\ndisposed to be merry, to see how I am occupied in logic and neglect\r\nphysic;” proving that her demands upon the States to be made by Bodley\r\nare founded upon the maxims of civil law. “If,” he says, “my hand and\r\narm did not pain me as it doth in distempering my spirits, I would\r\nsend longer argument” (Hatfield Papers, part v.). Thanks to Burghley’s\r\npersistence, terms were made with the States.\r\n\r\n[625] Printed in Strype’s “Annals.”\r\n\r\n[626] The Queen at this time appears to have been desirous of saving\r\nBurghley trouble. When the court was at Nonsuch (September 1595), the\r\nCouncil was held in his room, the Queen being present. (Bacon Papers.)\r\n\r\n[627] That he was not idle in mind even in his greatest pain is shown by\r\nthe fact that during this autumn, whilst he was almost entirely disabled,\r\nhe not only continued his close attendance to State affairs, but gave a\r\ngreat amount of attention to the new question which was disturbing the\r\nChurch, and especially setting the University of Cambridge by the ears.\r\nA Mr. Barrett, of Gonville and Caius, had preached a sermon in which\r\nthe doctrine of free grace was enunciated. This was thought by many to\r\nbe “Popish,” and Burghley, as Vice-Chancellor, ordered him to recant.\r\nThe doctrine was eloquently defended by Burghley’s protegé, Professor\r\nBaro. Curiously enough, Whitgift, a prelate of prelates, then came\r\nout with a series of articles (called the Lambeth articles) enforcing\r\nthe extreme Calvinistic doctrine of absolute predestination. Burghley\r\nwas passionately appealed to by both parties, and while supporting\r\nthe authority of Whitgift, expressed his dissent from the doctrine\r\nof predestination. The Queen, annoyed at the question being raised,\r\ninstructed Sir Robert Cecil to stop the dispute, which had caused much\r\ntrouble both to her and Burghley.\r\n\r\n[628] Venetian State Papers.\r\n\r\n[629] _In extenso_ in Bacon Papers (Birch).\r\n\r\n[630] Burghley did not prevail with the Queen at this juncture without\r\ntrouble when Essex was near. In March 1596, Essex arrived at the court\r\nat Richmond, and Standen says: “The old man upon some pet would needs\r\naway against her will on Thursday last, saying that her business was\r\nended, and he would for ten days go take physic. When she saw it booted\r\nnot to stay him she said he was a froward old fool” (Bacon Papers). The\r\nfollowing dignified letter written soon afterwards by Burghley to his\r\nson evidently refers to this incident: “My loving son, Sir Robert Cecil,\r\nknt., I do hold, and will always, this course in such matters as I differ\r\nin opinion from her Majesty. As long as I may be allowed to give advice\r\nI will not change my opinion by affirming the contrary, for that were\r\nto offend God, to whom I am sworn first; but as a servant I will obey\r\nher Majesty’s command and no wise contrary the same; presuming that she\r\nbeing God’s chief minister here, it shall be God’s will to have her\r\ncommandments obeyed—after that I have performed my duty as a Councillor,\r\nand shall in my heart wish her commandments to have such good success as\r\nshe intendeth. You see I am a mixture of divinity and policy; preferring\r\nin policy her Majesty before all others on earth, and in divinity the\r\nKing of Heaven above all.” This letter seems to enshrine Burghley’s\r\nlifelong rule of conduct as a minister.\r\n\r\n[631] Hatfield Papers, part v.\r\n\r\n[632] Lord Burghley must be absolved from all blame for the hesitation\r\nto succour Calais. The delay and failure were entirely the fault of the\r\nQueen. Whilst Burghley held back and resisted attempts to drag England\r\ninto war with Spain unnecessarily; when English interests were really at\r\nstake, as in the case of Calais, he could be as active as any one. On the\r\n6th April, as soon as the news arrived, his secretary wrote to Robert\r\nCecil—the Lord Treasurer being “freshly pinned” with the gout and unable\r\nto write—approving of Essex’s plan to relieve Calais; and on the 10th he\r\nwrites himself, after the town had surrendered, but whilst the citadel\r\nheld out: “I am heartily sorry to perceive her Majesty’s resolution\r\nto stay this voyage, being so far forward as it is; and surely I am\r\nof opinion that the citadel being relieved the town will be regained,\r\nand if for want of her Majesty’s succour it shall be lost, by judgment\r\nof the world the blame will be imputed to her.… These so many changes\r\nbreed hard opinions of counsell.” Sancy and the Duke de Bouillon came to\r\nElizabeth at Greenwich to remonstrate with her, in Henry’s name, on the\r\neffect which her demand for Calais in return for her aid had produced.\r\nSancy had a long conversation with Burghley on the 23rd April, and the\r\nlatter frankly told him that the conversion of Henry had entirely changed\r\nthe situation. The only common interests now, he said, between the two\r\ncountries was their vicinity. Sancy says the Lord Treasurer praised the\r\nSpaniards to the skies, to the detriment of the French. The French envoy\r\nwas endeavouring to secure an offensive and defensive alliance with\r\nEngland, which Burghley steadily opposed. How could Henry help Elizabeth?\r\nthe Treasurer asked; and what more could Elizabeth do for him than she\r\nwas doing? In one of their interviews Burghley flatly told Sancy that the\r\nQueen did not intend to strengthen Henry in order that he might make an\r\nadvantageous peace over her head. Sancy was shocked at such an imputation\r\non his master’s honour, and gave a written pledge of Henry that he would\r\nnever treat without England, and this was embodied in the treaty (26th\r\nMay 1596). Burghley made as good terms as he could, but he never was in\r\nfavour of the treaty. His letter quoted above (page 479) and his quarrel\r\nwith the Queen evidently had reference to this subject.\r\n\r\n[633] Bacon Papers.\r\n\r\n[634] Writing from Theobalds to Robert Cecil soon after the expedition\r\nsailed from Plymouth, he says, “I came here rather to satisfy my mind by\r\nchange of place, and to be less pressed by suitors, than with any hope of\r\nease or relief.”\r\n\r\n[635] Essex had lately, and most intemperately, been trying to force\r\nBodley into the Secretaryship. His importunity was so great as to offend\r\nthe Queen, and predisposed her against his protegés. How jealous Antony\r\nBacon was may be seen in his letter. “_Elphas peperit_; so that now the\r\nold man may say, with the rich man in the gospel, ‘_requiescat anima\r\nmea_.’” Bacon Papers.\r\n\r\n[636] That the reconciliation was not easy will be seen in Essex’s\r\nletters in the Bacon Papers. The Earl writes in September to Lady\r\nRussell, “Yesterday the Lord Treasurer and Sir Robert Cecil did, before\r\nthe Queen, contest with me, … and this day I was more braved by your\r\nlittle cousin (Cecil) than ever I was by any man in my life. But I was,\r\nand am, not angry, which is all the advantage I have of him.” In the\r\nfollowing April Essex entertained Cecil and Ralegh at dinner, “and a\r\ntreaty of peace was confirmed.” During the Earl’s disgrace with the Queen\r\nshortly afterwards, Cecil appears to have behaved in a friendly manner\r\ntowards him.\r\n\r\n[637] It is curious that in the previous year, when Essex was going\r\non the Cadiz expedition, Bellièvre, the French minister, expressed an\r\nopinion that “his appointment is a suggestion of the Lord Treasurer, in\r\norder to divert the Queen from sending aid to his Majesty (Henry IV.),\r\nand to get rid of the Earl of Essex on the pretext of this honourable\r\nappointment, which would leave him (Burghley) master of the Council.” It\r\nis fair to say that the Venetian ambassador who transmits this opinion,\r\nexpresses his disbelief in it. Venetian State Papers.\r\n\r\n[638] That the sagacious Bacon saw and foretold the consequences of\r\nEssex’s willingness to absent himself in risky enterprises, is evident\r\nfrom his letters to the Earl in October 1596 (Bacon’s Works, ed. Montagu,\r\nvol. 9).\r\n\r\n[639] There were about 120 ships, English and Dutch, and a force of some\r\n6000 men, including 1000 English veterans from the Low Countries, led by\r\nthe gallant Sir Francis Vere.\r\n\r\n[640] State Papers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[641] State Papers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[642] State Papers, Domestic.\r\n\r\n[643] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[644] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[645] De Maisse, the French peace envoy to England, wrote, “These people\r\nare still dwelling on their imagination of the house of Burgundy, … but\r\nit does not please them to have so powerful a neighbour as the King of\r\nSpain.”\r\n\r\n[646] Full particulars of his embassy will be found in his Journal, in\r\nthe Archives de la Ministère des affaires étrangères, Paris, partly\r\nreproduced in Prévost-Paradol’s “Elizabeth et Henry IV.”\r\n\r\n[647] For Cecil’s account of his embassy see Bacon Papers, Birch.

The Queen was so prepared for it by the small\r\nhopes of recovery that she takes it not over heavily, and gives ears to\r\nher suitors. The great places are in a manner passed before his death.”\r\n(State Papers, Dom.)\r\n\r\n[653] The full arrangements for the funeral will be found in the State\r\nPapers, Domestic, of the 29th August (Record Office). After the funeral\r\nat Westminster, the body was carried with great state to Stamford and\r\nburied at St. Martin’s Church, in accordance with the will.
