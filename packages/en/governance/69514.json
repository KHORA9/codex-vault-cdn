He never wasted\r\nwords; yet those words when spoken had more weight than those of most\r\nother men in Washington.\r\n\r\nThere was the briefest of good-morning gleams in his nod and glance,\r\nbut he only said:\r\n\r\n“Gordon, can you take the Pennsylvania train for New York that leaves\r\nthe station in thirty-two minutes?”\r\n\r\nThe young man was used to abrupt questions from his chief, but he\r\ncaught his breath, mentally surveying his day as it had been planned:\r\n\r\n“Why, sir, I suppose I could--if it is necessary----” He hesitated.\r\n\r\n“It is necessary,” said the chief curtly, as if that settled the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n“But--half an hour!” ejaculated Gordon in dismay. “I could hardly get\r\nto my rooms and back to the station. I don’t see how---- Isn’t there a\r\ntrain a little later?”\r\n\r\n“Later train won’t do. Call up your man on the ’phone. Tell him to pack\r\nyour bag and meet you at the station in twenty minutes. You’ll need\r\nevening clothes. Can you depend on your man to get your things quickly\r\nwithout fail?”\r\n\r\nThere was that in the tone of the chief that caused Gordon to make no\r\nfurther demur.\r\n\r\n“Sure!” he responded with his usual business-like tone, as he strode to\r\nthe ’phone. His daze was passing off. “Evening clothes?” he questioned\r\ncuriously, as if he might not have heard aright.\r\n\r\n“Yes, evening clothes,” was the curt answer, “and everything you’ll\r\nneed for daytime for a respectable gentleman of leisure--a tourist, you\r\nunderstand.”\r\n\r\nGordon perceived that he was being given a mission of trust and\r\nimportance, not unmixed with mystery perhaps. He was new in the secret\r\nservice, and it had been his ambition to rise in his chief’s good\r\ngraces. He rang the telephone bell furiously and called up the number\r\nof his own apartments, giving his man orders in a breezy, decisive tone\r\nthat caused a look of satisfaction to settle about the fine wrinkles\r\nof the chief’s eyes.\r\n\r\nGordon’s watch was out and he was telling his man on just what car he\r\nmust leave the apartments for the station. The chief noted it was two\r\ncars ahead of what would have been necessary. His gray head gave an\r\nalmost imperceptible nod of commendation, and his eyes showed that he\r\nwas content with his selection of a man.\r\n\r\n“Now, sir,” said Gordon, as he hung up the receiver, “I’m ready for\r\norders.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you are to go to New York, and take a cab for the Cosmopolis\r\nHotel--your room there is already secured by wire. Your name is John\r\nBurnham. The name of the hotel and the number of your room are on\r\nthis memorandum. You will find awaiting you an invitation to dine\r\nthis evening with a Mr. Holman, who knows of you as an expert in\r\ncode-reading. Our men met him on the train an hour ago and arranged\r\nthat he should invite you. He didn’t know whom they represented, of\r\ncourse. He has already tried to ’phone you at the hotel about coming to\r\ndinner to-night. He knows you are expected there before evening. Here\r\nis a letter of introduction to him from a man he knows. Our men got\r\nthat also. It is genuine, of course.\r\n\r\n“Last night a message of national importance, written in cipher, was\r\nstolen from one of our men before it had been read. This is now in the\r\nhands of Holman, who is hoping to have you decipher it for him and a\r\nfew guests who will also be present at dinner. They wish to use it for\r\ntheir own purposes. Your commission is to get hold of the message and\r\nbring it to us as soon as possible. Another message of very different\r\nimport, written upon the same kind of paper, is in this envelope,\r\nwith a translation for you to use in case you have to substitute a\r\nmessage. You will have to use your own wits and judgment. The main\r\nthing is, _get the paper_, and _get back with it_, with as little\r\ndelay as possible. Undoubtedly your life will be in danger should it\r\nbe discovered that you have made off with it. Spare no care to protect\r\nyourself _and the message_, at all hazards. Remember, I said, _and the\r\nmessage_, young man! It means much to the country.\r\n\r\n“In this envelope is money--all you will probably need. Telegraph or\r\n’phone to this address if you are in trouble. Draw on us for more, if\r\nnecessary, also through this same address. Here is the code you can\r\nuse in case you find it necessary to telegraph. Your ticket is already\r\nbought. I have sent Clarkson to the station for it, and he will meet\r\nyou at the train. You can give him instructions in case you find you\r\nhave forgotten anything. Take your mail with you, and telegraph back\r\norders to your stenographer. I think that is all. Oh, yes, to-night,\r\nwhile you are at dinner, you will be called to the ’phone by one of\r\nour men. If you are in trouble, this may give you opportunity to\r\nget away, and put us wise. You will find a motor at the door now,\r\nwaiting to take you to the station. If your man doesn’t get there\r\nwith your things, take the train, anyway, and buy some more when you\r\nget to New York. Don’t turn aside from your commission for anything.\r\nDon’t let _anything_ hinder you! Make it a matter of life and death!\r\nGood-morning, and good luck!”\r\n\r\nThe chief held out a big, hairy hand that was surprisingly warm and\r\nsoft considering the hardness of his face and voice, and the young man\r\ngrasped it, feeling as if he were suddenly being plunged into waves of\r\nan unknown depth and he would fain hold on to this strong hand.\r\n\r\nHe went out of the office quietly enough, and the keen old eyes watched\r\nhim knowingly, understanding the beating of the heart under Gordon’s\r\nwell-fitting business coat, the mingled elation and dread over the\r\ncommission. But there had been no hesitancy, no question of acceptance,\r\nwhen the nature of the commission was made known. The young man was\r\n“game.” He would do. Not even an eyelash had flickered at the hint\r\nof danger. The chief felt he would be faithful even in the face of\r\npossible death.\r\n\r\nGordon’s man came rushing into the station just after he reached there\r\nhimself. Clarkson was already there with the ticket. Gordon had time to\r\nscribble a message to Julia Bentley, whose perfumed scrawl he had read\r\non the way down. Julia had bidden him to her presence that evening. He\r\ncould not tell whether he was relieved or sorry to tell her he could\r\nnot come. It began to look to him a good deal as if he would ask Julia\r\nBentley to marry him some day, when she got tired of playing all the\r\nothers off against him, and he could make up his mind to surrender his\r\nfreedom to any woman.\r\n\r\nHe bought a paper and settled himself comfortably in the parlor-car,\r\nbut his interest was not in the paper. His strange commission engaged\r\nall his thoughts. He took out the envelope containing instructions and\r\nwent over the matter, looking curiously at the cipher message and its\r\ntranslation, which, however, told him nothing. It was the old chief’s\r\nway to keep the business to himself until such time as he chose to\r\nexplain. Doubtless it was safer for both message and messenger that he\r\ndid not know the full import of what he was undertaking.\r\n\r\nGordon carefully noted down everything that his chief had told him,\r\ncomparing it with the written instructions in the envelope; arranged\r\nin his mind just how he would proceed when he reached New York; tried\r\nto think out a good plan for recovering the stolen message, but could\r\nnot; and so decided to trust to the inspiration of the moment. Then it\r\noccurred to him to clear his overcoat pockets of any letters or other\r\ntell-tale articles and stow them in his suit-case. He might have to\r\nleave his overcoat behind him. So it would be well to have no clues for\r\nanyone to follow.\r\n\r\nHaving arranged these matters, and prepared a few letters with notes\r\nfor his stenographer, to be mailed back to her from Philadelphia, he\r\nreread Julia Bentley’s note. When every angular line of her tall script\r\nwas imprinted on his memory, he tore the perfumed note into tiny pieces\r\nand dropped them from the car window.\r\n\r\nThe question was, did he or did he not want to ask Julia Bentley to\r\nbecome his wife? He had no doubt as to what her answer would be. Julia\r\nhad made it pretty plain to him that she would rather have him than any\r\nof her other admirers; though she did like to keep them all attendant\r\nupon her. Well, that was her right so long as she was unmarried. He had\r\nno fault to find with her. She was a fine girl, and everybody liked\r\nher. Also, she was of a good family, and with a modest fortune in her\r\nown right. Everybody was taking it for granted that they liked each\r\nother. It was time he was married and had a real home, he supposed,\r\nwhatever that was--that seemed to have so great a charm for all his\r\nfriends. To his eyes, it had as yet taken on no alluring mirage effect.\r\nHe had never known a real home, more than his quiet bachelor apartments\r\nwere to him now, where his man ordered everything as he was told,\r\nand the meals were sent up when wanted. He had money enough from his\r\ninheritance to make things more than comfortable, and he was deeply\r\ninterested in the profession he had chosen.\r\n\r\nStill, if he was ever going to marry, it was high time, of course. But\r\ndid he want Julia? He could not quite make it seem pleasant to think of\r\nher in his rooms when he came home at night tired; she would always be\r\nwanting to go to her endless theatre parties and receptions and dances;\r\nalways be demanding his attention. She was bright and handsome and well\r\ndressed, but he had never made love to her. He could not quite imagine\r\nhimself doing so. How did men make love, anyway? Could one call it love\r\nwhen it was “made” love? These questions followed one another idly\r\nthrough his brain as the landscape whirled past him. If he had stayed\r\nat home, he would have spent the evening with Julia, as she requested\r\nin her note, and there would probably have been a quiet half-hour after\r\nother callers had gone when he would have stayed as he had been doing\r\nof late, and tried to find out whether he really cared for her or not.\r\n\r\nSuppose, for instance, they were married, and she sat beside him now.\r\nWould any glad thrill fill his heart as he looked at her beautiful face\r\nand realized that she was his? He tried to look over toward the next\r\nchair and imagine that the tired, fat old lady with the double chin and\r\nthe youthful purple hat was Julia, but that would not work. He whirled\r\nhis chair about and tried it on an empty chair. That went better; but\r\nstill no thrill of joy lifted him out of his sordid self. He could not\r\nhelp thinking about little trying details. The way Julia looked when\r\nshe was vexed. Did one mind that in the woman one loved? The way she\r\nordered her coachman about. Would she ever speak so to her husband? She\r\nhad a charming smile, but her frown was--well--unbecoming to say the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nHe tried to keep up the fallacy of her presence. He bought a magazine\r\nthat he knew she liked, and read a story to her (in imagination). He\r\ncould easily tell how her black eyes would snap at certain phrases she\r\ndisliked. He knew just what her comment would be upon the heroine’s\r\nconduct. It was an old disputed point between them. He knew how she\r\nwould criticize the hero, and somehow he felt himself in the hero’s\r\nplace every time she did it. The story had not been a success, and he\r\nfelt a weariness as he laid the magazine aside at the call for dinner\r\nfrom the dining-car.\r\n\r\nBefore he had finished his luncheon he had begun to feel that though\r\nJulia might think now that she would like to marry him, the truth\r\nabout it was that she would not enjoy the actual life together any\r\nbetter than he would. Were all marriages like that? Did people lose\r\nthe glamour and just settle down to endure each other’s faults and\r\nmake the most of each other’s pleasant side, and not have anything\r\nmore? Or was he getting cynical? Had he lived alone too long, as his\r\nfriends sometimes told him, and so was losing the ability really to\r\nlove anybody but himself? He knit his brows, and got up whistling to go\r\nout and see why the train had stopped so long in this little country\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nIt was just beyond Princeton, and they were not far now from New York.\r\nIt would be most annoying to be delayed so near to his destination. He\r\nwas anxious to get things in train for his evening of hard work. It\r\nwas necessary to find out how the land lay as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that there was a wrecked freight ahead of them, and there\r\nwould be delay. No one knew just how long; it would depend on how soon\r\nthe wrecking train arrived to help.\r\n\r\nGordon walked nervously up and down the grass at the side of the track,\r\nlooking anxiously each way for sign of the wrecking train. The thought\r\nof Julia did occur to him, but he put it impatiently away, for he knew\r\njust how poorly Julia would bear a delay on a journey even in his\r\ncompany. He had been with her once when the engine got off the track\r\non a short trip down to a Virginia house-party, and she was the most\r\nimpatient creature alive, although it mattered not one whit to any of\r\nthe rest of the party whether they made merry on the train or at their\r\nfriend’s house. And yet, if Julia were anything at all to him, would\r\nnot he like the thought of her companionship now?\r\n\r\nA great white dog hobbled up to him and fawned upon him as he turned\r\nto go back to the train, and he laid his hand kindly upon the animal’s\r\nhead, and noted the wistful eyes upon his face. He was a noble dog, and\r\nGordon stood for a moment fondling him. Then he turned impatiently and\r\ntramped back to his car again. But when he reached the steps he found\r\nthat the dog had followed him.\r\n\r\nGordon frowned, half in annoyance, half in amusement, and sitting down\r\non a log by the wayside he took the dog’s pink nozzle into his hands,\r\ncaressing the white fur above it gently.\r\n\r\nThe dog whined happily, and Gordon meditated. How long would the train\r\nwait? Would he miss getting to New York in time for the dinner? Would\r\nhe miss the chance to rise in his chief’s good graces? The chief would\r\nexpect him to get to New York some other way if the train were delayed.\r\nHow long ought he to wait on possibilities?\r\n\r\nAll at once he saw the conductor and trainmen coming back hurriedly.\r\nEvidently the train was about to start. With a final kindly stroke of\r\nthe white head, he called a workman nearby, handed him half a dollar to\r\nhold the dog, and sprang on board.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely settled himself into his chair, however, before the\r\ndog came rushing up the aisle from the other end of the car, and\r\nprecipitated himself muddily and noisily upon him.\r\n\r\nWith haste and perturbation Gordon hurried the dog to the door and\r\ntried to fling him off, but the poor creature pulled back and clung to\r\nthe platform yelping piteously.\r\n\r\nJust then the conductor came from the other car and looked at him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n“No dogs allowed in these cars,” he said gruffly.\r\n\r\n“Well, if you know how to enforce that rule I wish you would,” said\r\nGordon. “I’m sure I don’t know what to do with him.”\r\n\r\n“Where has he been since you left Washington?” asked the grim conductor\r\nwith suspicion in his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I certainly haven’t had him secreted about me, a dog of that size,”\r\nremarked the young man dryly. “Besides, he isn’t my dog. I never saw\r\nhim before till he followed me at the station. I’m as anxious to be rid\r\nof him as he is to stay.”\r\n\r\nThe conductor eyed the young man keenly, and then allowed a grim sense\r\nof humor to appear in one corner of his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Got a chain or a rope for him?” he asked more sympathetically.\r\n\r\n“Well, no,” remarked the unhappy attaché of the dog. “Not having had an\r\nappointment with the dog I didn’t provide myself with a leash for him.”\r\n\r\n“Take him into the baggage-car,” said the conductor briefly, and\r\nslammed his way into the next car.\r\n\r\nThere seemed nothing else to be done, but it was most annoying to\r\nbe thus forced on the notice of his fellow-travellers, when his\r\ncommission required that he be as inconspicuous as possible.\r\n\r\nAt Jersey City he hoped to escape and leave the dog to the tender\r\nmercies of the baggage man, but that official was craftily waiting\r\nfor him and handed the animal over to his unwilling master with a\r\nsatisfaction ill-proportioned to the fee he had received for caring for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen began a series of misfortunes. Disappointment and suspicion\r\nstalked beside him, and behind him a voice continually whispered his\r\nchief’s last injunction: “Don’t let anything hinder you!”\r\n\r\nFrantically he tried first one place and then another, but all to no\r\neffect. Nobody apparently wanted to care for a stray white dog, and\r\nhis very haste aroused suspicion. Once he came near being arrested as\r\na dog thief. He could not get rid of that dog! Yet he must not let him\r\nfollow him! Would he have to have the animal sent home to Washington as\r\nthe only solution of the problem? Then a queer fancy seized him that\r\njust in some such way had Miss Julia Bentley been shadowing his days\r\nfor nearly three years now; and he had actually this very day been\r\nconsidering calmly whether he might not have to marry her, just because\r\nshe was so persistent in her taking possession of him. Not that she was\r\nunladylike, of course; no, indeed! She was stately and beautiful, and\r\nhad never offended. But she had always quietly, persistently, taken it\r\nfor granted that he would be her attendant whenever she chose; and she\r\nalways chose whenever he was in the least inclined to enjoy any other\r\nwoman’s company.\r\n\r\nHe frowned at himself. Was there something weak about his character\r\nthat a woman or a dog could so easily master him? Would any other\r\nemployee in the office, once trusted with his great commission, have\r\nallowed it to be hindered by a dog?\r\n\r\nGordon could not afford to waste any more time. He must get rid of him\r\nat once!\r\n\r\nThe express office would not take a dog without a collar and chain\r\nunless he was crated; and the delays and exasperating hindrances seemed\r\nto be interminable. But at last, following the advice of a kindly\r\nofficer, he took the dog to an institution in New York where, he was\r\ntold, dogs were boarded and cared for, and where he finally disposed\r\nof him, having first paid ten dollars for the privilege. As he settled\r\nback in a taxicab with his watch in his hand, he congratulated himself\r\nthat he had still ample time to reach his hotel and get into evening\r\ndress before he must present himself for his work.\r\n\r\nWithin three blocks of the hotel the cab came to such a sudden\r\nstandstill that Gordon was thrown to his knees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were surrounded immediately by a crowd in which policemen were\r\na prominent feature. The chauffeur seemed dazed in the hands of the\r\nofficers.\r\n\r\nA little, barefoot, white-faced figure huddled limply in the midst\r\nshowed Gordon what had happened: also there were menacing glances\r\ntowards himself and a show of lifted stones. He heard one boy say: “You\r\nbet he’s in a hurry to git away. Them kind allus is. They don’t care\r\nwho they kills, they don’t!”\r\n\r\nA great horror seized him. The cab had run over a newsboy and perhaps\r\nkilled him. Yet instantly came the remembrance of his commission:\r\n“Don’t let anything hinder you. Make it a matter of life and death!”\r\nWell, it looked as if this was a matter of death that hindered him now.\r\n\r\nThey bundled the moaning boy into the taxicab and as Gordon saw no\r\nescape through the tightly packed crowd, who eyed him suspiciously, he\r\nclimbed in beside the grimy little scrap of unconscious humanity, and\r\nthey were off to the hospital to the tune of “Don’t let anything hinder\r\nyou! Don’t let anything hinder you!” until Gordon felt that if it did\r\nnot stop soon he would go crazy. He meditated opening the cab door and\r\nmaking his escape in spite of the speed they were making, but a vision\r\nof broken legs and a bed in the hospital for himself held him to his\r\nseat. One of the policemen had climbed on in front with the chauffeur,\r\nand now and again he glanced back as if he were conveying a couple of\r\nprisoners to jail. It was vexatious beyond anything! And all on account\r\nof that white dog! Could anything be more ridiculous than the whole\r\nperformance?\r\n\r\nHis annoyance and irritation almost made him forget that it was his\r\nprogress through the streets that had silenced this mite beside him.\r\nBut just as he looked at his watch for the fifth time the boy opened\r\nhis eyes and moaned, and there was in those eyes a striking resemblance\r\nto the look in the eyes of the dog of whose presence he had but just\r\nrid himself.\r\n\r\nGordon started. In spite of himself it seemed as if the dog were\r\nreproaching him through the eyes of the child. Then suddenly the boy\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n“Will yous stay by me till I’m mended?” whispered the weak little voice.\r\n\r\nGordon’s heart leaped in horror again, and it came to him that he\r\nwas being tried out this day to see if he had the right stuff in him\r\nfor hard tasks. The appeal in the little street-boy’s eyes reached\r\nhim as no request had ever yet done, and yet he might not answer it.\r\nDuty,--life and death duty,--called him elsewhere, and he must leave\r\nthe little fellow whom he had been the involuntary cause of injuring,\r\nto suffer and perhaps to die. It cut him to the quick not to respond to\r\nthat urgent appeal.\r\n\r\nWas it because he was weary that he was visited just then by a vision\r\nof Julia Bentley with her handsome lips curled scornfully? Julia\r\nBentley would not have approved of his stopping to carry a boy to the\r\nhospital, any more than to care for a dog’s comfort.\r\n\r\n“Look here, kiddie,” he said gently, leaning over the child, “I’d stay\r\nby you if I could, but I’ve already made myself late for an appointment\r\nby coming so far with you. Do you know what Duty is?”\r\n\r\nThe child nodded sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“Don’t yous mind me,” he murmured weakly. “Just yous go. I’m game all\r\nright.” Then the voice trailed off into silence again, and the eyelids\r\nfluttered down upon the little, grimy, unconscious face.\r\n\r\nGordon went into the hospital for a brief moment to leave some money in\r\nthe hands of the authorities for the benefit of the boy, and a message\r\nthat he would return in a week or two if possible; then hurried away.\r\n\r\nBack in the cab once more, he felt as if he had killed a man and left\r\nhim lying by the roadside while he continued his unswerving march\r\ntoward the hideous duty which was growing momently more portentous, and\r\nto be relieved of which he would gladly have surrendered further hope\r\nof his chief’s favor. He closed his eyes and tried to think, but all\r\nthe time the little white face of the child came before his vision,\r\nand the mocking eyes of Julia Bentley tantalized him, as if she were\r\ntelling him that he had spoiled all his chances--and hers--by his\r\nfoolish soft-heartedness. Though, what else could he have done than he\r\nhad done, he asked himself fiercely.\r\n\r\nHe looked at his watch. It was at least ten minutes’ ride to the\r\nhotel, the best time they could make. Thanks to his man the process of\r\ndressing for evening would not take long, for he knew that everything\r\nwould be in place and he would not be hindered. He would make short\r\nwork of his toilet. But there was his suit-case. It would not do to\r\nleave it at the hotel, neither must he take it with him to the house\r\nwhere he was to be a guest. There was nothing for it but to go around\r\nby the way of the station where it would have to be checked. That meant\r\na longer ride and more delay, but it must be done.\r\n\r\nArrived at the hotel at last and in the act of signing the unaccustomed\r\n“John Burnham” in the hotel registry, there came a call to the\r\ntelephone.\r\n\r\nWith a hand that trembled from excitement he took the receiver. His\r\nbreath went from him as though he had just run up five flights of\r\nstairs. “Yes? Hello! Oh, Mrs. Holman. Yes! Burnham. I’ve but just\r\narrived. I was delayed. A wreck ahead of the train. Very kind of you to\r\ninvite me, I’m sure. Yes, I’ll be there in a few moments, as soon as I\r\ncan get rid of the dust of travel. Thank you. Good-by.”\r\n\r\nIt all sounded very commonplace to the clerk, who was making out bills\r\nand fretting because he could not get off to take his girl to the\r\ntheatre that night, but as Gordon hung up the receiver he looked around\r\nfurtively as if expecting to see a dozen detectives ready to seize upon\r\nhim. It was the first time he had ever undertaken a commission under an\r\nassumed name and he felt as if he were shouting his commission through\r\nthe streets of New York.\r\n\r\nThe young man made short work of his toilet. Just as he was leaving the\r\nhotel a telegram was handed him. It was from his chief, and so worded\r\nthat to the operator who had copied it down it read like a hasty call\r\nto Boston; but to his code-enlightened eyes it was merely a blind to\r\ncover his exit from the hotel and from New York, and set any possible\r\nhunters on a wrong scent. He marvelled at the wonderful mind of his\r\nchief, who thought out every detail of an important campaign, and\r\nforgot not one little possible point where difficulty might arise.\r\n\r\nGordon had a nervous feeling as he again stepped into a taxicab and\r\ngave his order. He wondered how many stray dogs, and newsboys with\r\nbroken legs, would attach themselves to him on the way to dinner.\r\nWhenever the speed slowed down, or they were halted by cars and autos,\r\nhis heart pounded painfully, lest something new had happened, but he\r\narrived safely and swiftly at the station, checked his suit-case,\r\nand took another cab to the residence of Mr. Holman, without further\r\nincident.\r\n\r\nThe company were waiting for him, and after the introductions they went\r\nimmediately to the dining-room. Gordon took his seat with the feeling\r\nthat he had bungled everything hopelessly, and had arrived so late\r\nthat there was no possible hope of his doing what he had been sent\r\nto do. For the first few minutes his thoughts were a jumble, and his\r\neyes dazed with the brilliant lights of the room. He could not single\r\nout the faces of the people present and differentiate them one from\r\nanother. His heart beat painfully against the stiff expanse of evening\r\nlinen. It almost seemed as if those near him could hear it. He found\r\nhimself starting and stammering when he was addressed as “Mr. Burnham.”\r\nHis thoughts were mingled with white dogs, newsboys, and ladies with\r\nscornful smiles.\r\n\r\nHe was seated on the right of his hostess, and gradually her gentle\r\nmanners gave him quietness. He began to gain control of himself, and\r\nnow he seemed to see afar the keen eye of his chief watching the\r\ntesting of his new commissioner. His heart swelled to meet the demand\r\nmade upon him. A strong purpose came to him to rise above all obstacles\r\nand conquer in spite of circumstances. He must forget everything else\r\nand rise to the occasion.\r\n\r\nFrom that moment the dancing lights that multiplied themselves in the\r\nglittering silver and cut glass of the table began to settle into\r\norder; and slowly, one by one, the conglomeration of faces around the\r\nboard resolved itself into individuals.\r\n\r\nThere was the pretty, pale hostess, whose gentle ways seemed\r\nhardly to fit with her large, boisterous, though polished husband.\r\nUnscrupulousness was written all over his ruddy features, also a\r\ncertain unhidden craftiness which passed for geniality among his kind.\r\n\r\nThere were two others with faces full of cunning, both men of wealth\r\nand culture. One did not think of the word “refinement” in connection\r\nwith them; still, that might be conceded also; but it was all\r\ndominated by the cunning that on this occasion, at least, was allowed\r\nto sit unmasked upon their countenances. They had outwitted an enemy,\r\nand they were openly exultant.\r\n\r\nOf the other guests, one was very young and sleek, with eyes that had\r\nearly learned to evade; one was old and weary-looking, with a hunted\r\nexpression; one was thick-set, with little eyes set close in a fat,\r\nselfish face. Gordon began to understand that these three but did the\r\nbidding of the others. They listened to the conversation merely from a\r\nbusiness standpoint and not with any personal interest. They were there\r\nbecause they were needed, and not because they were desired.\r\n\r\nThere was one bond which they seemed to hold in common: an alert\r\nreadiness to combine for their mutual safety. This did not manifest\r\nitself in anything tangible, but the guest felt that it was there and\r\nready to spring upon him at any instant.\r\n\r\nAll this came gradually to the young man as the meal with its pleasant\r\nformalities began. As yet nothing had been said about the reason for\r\nhis being there.\r\n\r\n“Did you tell me you were in a wreck?” suddenly asked the hostess\r\nsweetly, turning to him, and the table talk hushed instantly while the\r\nhost asked: “A wreck! Was it serious?”\r\n\r\nGordon perceived his mistake at once. With instant caution, he replied\r\nsmilingly, “Oh, nothing serious, a little break-down on a freight\r\nahead, which required time to patch up. It reminded me----” and then he\r\nlaunched boldly into one of the bright dinner stories for which he was\r\nnoted among his companions at home. His heart was beating wildly, but\r\nhe succeeded in turning the attention of the table to his joke, instead\r\nof to asking from where he had come and on what road. Questions about\r\nhimself were dangerous he plainly saw, if he would get possession of\r\nthe valued paper and get away without leaving a trail behind him. He\r\nsucceeded in one thing more, which, though he did not know it, was the\r\nvery thing his chief had hoped he would do when he chose him instead\r\nof a man who had wider experience; he made every man at the table feel\r\nthat he was delightful, a man to be thoroughly trusted and enjoyed; who\r\nwould never suspect them of having any ulterior motives in anything\r\nthey were doing.\r\n\r\nThe conversation for a little time rippled with bright stories and\r\nrepartee, and Gordon began to feel almost as if he were merely enjoying\r\na social dinner at home, with Julia Bentley down the table listening\r\nand haughtily smiling her approval. For the time the incidents of\r\nthe dog and the newsboy were forgotten, and the young man felt his\r\nself-respect rising. His heart was beginning to get into normal action\r\nagain and he could control his thoughts. Then suddenly, the crisis\r\narrived.\r\n\r\nThe soup and fish courses had been disposed of, and the table was being\r\nprepared for the entrée. The host leaned back genially in his chair\r\nand said, “By the way, Mr. Burnham, did you know I had an axe to grind\r\nin asking you here this evening? That sounds inhospitable, doesn’t\r\nit? But I’m sure we’re all grateful to the axe that has given us the\r\nopportunity of meeting you. We are delighted at having discovered you.”\r\n\r\nGordon bowed, smiling at the compliment, and the murmurs of hearty\r\nassent around the table showed him that he had begun well. If only he\r\ncould keep it up! But how, _how_, was he to get possession of that\r\nmagic bit of paper and take it away with him?\r\n\r\n“Mr. Burnham, I was delighted to learn through a friend that you are an\r\nexpert in code-reading. I wonder, did the message that my friend Mr.\r\nBurns sent you this morning give you any intimation that I wanted you\r\nto do me a favor?”\r\n\r\nGordon bowed again. “Yes: it was intimated to me that you had some\r\nmessage you would like deciphered, and I have also a letter of\r\nintroduction from Mr. Burns.”\r\n\r\nHere Gordon took the letter of introduction from his pocket and handed\r\nit across the table to his host, who opened it genially, as if it were\r\nhardly necessary to read what was written within since they already\r\nknew so delightfully the man whom it introduced. The duplicate cipher\r\nwriting in Gordon’s pocket crackled knowingly when he settled his coat\r\nabout him again, as if it would say, “My time is coming! It is almost\r\nhere now.”\r\n\r\nThe young man wondered how he was to get it out without being seen, in\r\ncase he should want to use it, but he smiled pleasantly at his host\r\nwith no sign of the perturbation he was feeling.\r\n\r\n“You see,” went on Mr. Holman, “we have an important message which we\r\ncannot read, and our expert who understands all these matters is out of\r\ntown and cannot return for some time. It is necessary that we know as\r\nsoon as possible the import of this writing.”\r\n\r\nWhile he was speaking Mr. Holman drew from his pocket a long, soft\r\nleather wallet and took therefrom a folded paper which Gordon at once\r\nrecognized as the duplicate of the one he carried in his pocket.\r\nHis head seemed to reel, and all the lights go dark before him as\r\nhe reached a cold hand out for the paper. He saw in it his own\r\nadvancement coming to his eager grasp, yet when he got it would he be\r\nable to hold it? Something of the coolness of a man facing a terrible\r\ndanger came to him now. By sheer force of will he held his trembling\r\nfingers steady as he took the bit of paper and opened it carelessly, as\r\nif he had never heard of it before, saying as he did so:\r\n\r\n“I will do my best.”\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden silence as every eye was fixed upon him while he\r\nunfolded the paper. He gave one swift glance about the table before he\r\ndropped his eyes to the task. Every face held the intensity of almost\r\nterrible eagerness, and on every one but that of the gentle hostess sat\r\ncunning--craft that would stop at nothing to serve its own ends. It was\r\na moment of almost awful import.\r\n\r\nThe next instant Gordon’s glance went down to the paper in his hand,\r\nand his brain and heart were seized in the grip of fright. There was no\r\nother word to describe his feeling. The message before him was clearly\r\nwritten in the code of the home office, and the words stared at him\r\nplainly without the necessity of study. The import of them was the\r\nrevelation of one of the most momentous questions that had to do with\r\nthe Secret Service work, a question the answer to which had puzzled the\r\nentire department for weeks. That answer he now held in his hand, and\r\nhe knew that if it should come to the knowledge of those outside before\r\nit had done its work through the department it would result in dire\r\ncalamity to the cause of righteousness in the country, and incidentally\r\ncrush the inefficient messenger who allowed it to become known. For the\r\ninstant Gordon felt unequal to the task before him. How could he keep\r\nthese bloodhounds at bay--for such they were, he perceived from the\r\nimport of the message, bloodhounds who were getting ill-gotten gains\r\nfrom innocent and unsuspecting victims--some of them little children.\r\n\r\nBut the old chief had picked his man well. Only for an instant the\r\nglittering lights darkened before his eyes and the cold perspiration\r\nstarted. Then he rallied his forces and looked up. The welfare of a\r\nnation’s honor was in his hands, and he would be true. It was a matter\r\nof life and death, and he would save it or lose his own life if need be.\r\n\r\nHe summoned his ready smile.\r\n\r\n“I shall be glad to serve you if I can,” he said. “Of course I’d like\r\nto look this over a few minutes before attempting to read it. Codes are\r\ndifferent, you know, from one another, but there is a key to them all\r\nif one can just find it out. This looks as if it might be very simple.”\r\n\r\nThe spell of breathlessness was broken. The guests relaxed and went on\r\nwith their dinner.\r\n\r\nGordon, meanwhile, tried coolly to keep up a pretense of eating, the\r\npaper held in one hand while he seemed to be studying it. Once he\r\nturned it over and looked on the back. There was a large cross-mark\r\nin red ink at the upper end. He looked at it curiously and then\r\ninstinctively at his host.\r\n\r\n“That is my own mark,” said Mr. Holman. “I put it there to distinguish\r\nit from other papers.” He was smiling politely, but he might as well\r\nhave said, “I put it there to identify it in case of theft;” for every\r\none at the table, unless it might be his wife, understood that that was\r\nwhat he meant. Gordon felt it and was conscious of the other paper in\r\nhis vest-pocket. The way was going to be most difficult.\r\n\r\nAmong the articles in the envelope which the chief had given him before\r\nhis departure from Washington were a pair of shell-rimmed eye-glasses,\r\na false mustache, a goatee, and a pair of eyebrows. He had laughed\r\nat the suggestion of high-tragedy contained in the disguise, but had\r\nbrought them with him for a possible emergency. The eye-glasses were\r\ntucked into the vest-pocket beside the duplicate paper. He bethought\r\nhimself of them now. Could he, under cover of taking them out, manage\r\nto exchange the papers? And if he should, how about that red-ink\r\nmark across the back? Would anyone notice its absence? It was well to\r\nexchange the papers as soon as possible before the writing had been\r\nstudied by those at the table, for he knew that the other message,\r\nthough resembling this one in general words, differed enough to attract\r\nthe attention of a close observer. Dared he risk their noticing the\r\nabsence of the red cross on the back?\r\n\r\nSlowly, cautiously, under cover of the conversation, he managed to get\r\nthat duplicate paper out of his pocket and under the napkin in his lap.\r\nThis he did with one hand, all the time ostentatiously holding the code\r\nmessage in the other hand, with its back to the people at the table.\r\nThis hand meanwhile also held his coat lapel out that he might the more\r\neasily search his vest-pockets for the glasses. It all looked natural.\r\nThe hostess was engaged in a whispered conversation with the maid at\r\nthe moment. The host and other guests were finishing the exceedingly\r\ndelicious patties on their plates, and the precious code message\r\nwas safely in evidence, red cross and all. They saw no reason to be\r\nsuspicious about the stranger’s hunt for his glasses.\r\n\r\n“Oh, here they are!” he said, quite unconcernedly, and put on the\r\nglasses to look more closely at the paper, spreading it smoothly on the\r\ntable cloth before him, and wondering how he should get it into his\r\nlap in place of the one that now lay quietly under his napkin.\r\n\r\nThe host and the guests politely refrained from talking to Gordon and\r\ntold each other incidents of the day in low tones that indicated the\r\nnon-importance of what they were saying; while they waited for the real\r\nbusiness of the hour.\r\n\r\nThen the butler removed the plates, pausing beside Gordon waiting\r\npunctiliously with his silver tray to brush away the crumbs.\r\n\r\nThis was just what Gordon waited for. It had come to him as the only\r\nway. Courteously he drew aside, lifting the paper from the table and\r\nputting it in his lap, for just the instant while the butler did his\r\nwork; but in that instant the paper with the red cross was slipped\r\nunder the napkin, and the other paper took its place upon the table,\r\nback down so that its lack of a red cross could not be noted.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good, but how long could this be kept up? And the paper\r\nunder the napkin--how was it to be got into his pocket? His hands were\r\nlike ice now, and his brain seemed to be at boiling heat as he sat back\r\nand realized that the deed was done, and could not be undone. If anyone\r\nshould pick up that paper from the table and discover the lack of the\r\nred mark, it would be all up with him. He looked up for an instant\r\nto meet the gaze of the six men upon him. They had nothing better to\r\ndo now than to look at him until the next course arrived. He realized\r\nthat not one of them would have mercy upon him if they knew what he had\r\ndone, not one unless it might be the tired, old-looking one, and he\r\nwould not dare interfere.\r\n\r\nStill Gordon was enabled to smile, and to say some pleasant nothings\r\nto his hostess when she passed him the salted almonds. His hand lay\r\ncarelessly guarding the secret of the paper on the table, innocently,\r\nas though it just _happened_ that he laid it on the paper.\r\n\r\nSitting thus with the real paper in his lap under his large damask\r\nnapkin, the false paper under his hand on the table where he from\r\ntime to time perused it, and his eye-glasses which made him look most\r\ndistinguished still on his nose, he heard the distant telephone bell\r\nring.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the words of his chief and sat rigid. From his position\r\nhe could see the tall clock in the hall, and its gilded hands pointed\r\nto ten minutes before seven. It was about the time his chief had said\r\nhe would be called on the telephone. What should he do with the two\r\npapers?\r\n\r\nHe had but an instant to think until the well-trained butler returned\r\nand announced that some one wished to speak with Mr. Burnham on the\r\ntelephone. His resolve was taken. He would have to leave the substitute\r\npaper on the table. To carry it away with him might arouse suspicion,\r\nand, moreover, he could not easily manage both without being noticed.\r\nThe real paper must be put safely away at all hazards, and he must take\r\nthe chance that the absence of the red mark would remain unnoticed\r\nuntil his return.\r\n\r\nDeliberately he laid a heavy silver spoon across one edge of the paper\r\non the table, and an icecream fork across the other, as if to hold it\r\nin place until his return. Then, rising with apologies, he gathered\r\nhis napkin, paper, and all in his hand, holding it against his coat\r\nmost naturally, as if he had forgotten that he had it, and made his\r\nway into the front hall, where in an alcove was the telephone. As he\r\npassed the hat-rack he swept his coat and hat off with his free hand,\r\nand bore them with him, devoutly hoping that he was not being watched\r\nfrom the dining-room. Could he possibly get from the telephone out the\r\nfront door without being seen? Hastily he hid the cipher message in an\r\ninner pocket. The napkin he dropped on the little telephone table, and\r\ntaking up the receiver he spoke: “Hello! Yes! Oh, good evening! You\r\ndon’t say so! How did that happen?” He made his voice purposely clear,\r\nthat it might be heard in the dining-room if anyone was listening. Then\r\nglancing in that direction he saw, to his horror, his host lean over\r\nand lift the cipher paper he had left on the table and hand it to the\r\nguest on his right.\r\n\r\nThe messenger at the other end had given his sentence agreed upon\r\nand he had replied according to the sentences laid down by the chief\r\nin his instructions; the other end had said good-by and hung up, but\r\nGordon’s voice spoke, cool and clear in the little alcove, despite\r\nhis excitement. “All right. Certainly, I can take time to write it\r\ndown. Wait until I get my pencil. Now, I’m ready. Have you it there?\r\nI’ll wait a minute until you get it.” His heart beat wildly. The blood\r\nsurged through his ears like rushing waters. Would they look for the\r\nlittle red mark? The soft clink of spoons and dishes and the murmur of\r\nconversation was still going on, but there was no doubt but that it\r\nwas a matter of a few seconds before his theft would be discovered. He\r\nmust make an instant dash for liberty while he yet could. Cautiously,\r\nstealthily, like a shadow from the alcove, one eye on the dining-room,\r\nhe stole to the door and turned the knob. Yet even as he did so he saw\r\nhis recent host rise excitedly from his seat and fairly snatch the\r\npaper from the man who held it. His last glimpse of the room where he\r\nhad but three minutes before been enjoying the hospitality of the house\r\nwas a vision of the entire company starting up and pointing to himself\r\neven as he slid from sight. There was no longer need for silence. He\r\nhad been discovered and must fight for his life. He shut the door\r\nquickly, his nerves so tense that it seemed as if something must break\r\nsoon; opened and slammed the outer door, and was out in the great\r\nwhirling city under the flare of electric lamps with only the chance of\r\na second of time before his pursuers would be upon him.\r\n\r\nHe came down the steps with the air of one who could scarcely take time\r\nto touch his feet to the ground, but must fly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost in front of the house stood a closed carriage with two fine\r\nhorses, but the coachman was looking up anxiously toward the next\r\nbuilding. The sound of the closing door drew the man’s attention, and,\r\ncatching Gordon’s eye, he made as if to jump down and throw open the\r\ndoor of the carriage. Quick as a flash, Gordon saw he had been mistaken\r\nfor the man the carriage awaited, and he determined to make use of the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n“Don’t get down,” he called to the man, taking chances. “It’s very late\r\nalready. I’ll open the door. Drive for all you’re worth.” He jumped\r\nin and slammed the carriage door behind him, and in a second more the\r\nhorses were flying down the street. A glance from the back window\r\nshowed an excited group of his fellow-guests standing at the open door\r\nof the mansion he had just left pointing toward his carriage and wildly\r\ngesticulating. He surmised that his host was already at the telephone\r\ncalling for his own private detective.\r\n\r\nGordon could scarcely believe his senses that he had accomplished his\r\nmission and flight so far, and yet he knew his situation was most\r\nprecarious. Where he was going he neither knew nor cared. When he was\r\nsure he was far enough from the house he would call to the driver and\r\ngive him directions, but first he must make sure that the precious\r\npaper was safely stowed away, in case he should be caught and searched.\r\nThey might be coming after him with motor-cycles in a minute or two.\r\n\r\nCarefully rolling the paper into a tiny compass, he slipped it into\r\na hollow gold case which was among the things in the envelope the\r\nchief had given him. There was a fine chain attached to the case, and\r\nthe whole looked innocently like a gold pencil. The chain he slipped\r\nabout his neck, dropping the case down inside his collar. That done he\r\nbreathed more freely. Only from his dead body should they take that\r\naway. Then he hastily put on the false eyebrows, mustache, and goatee\r\nwhich had been provided for his disguise, and pulling on a pair of\r\nlight gloves he felt more fit to evade detection.\r\n\r\nHe was just beginning to think what he should say to the driver about\r\ntaking him to the station, for it was important that he get out of the\r\ncity at once, when, glancing out of the window to see what part of\r\nthe city he was being taken through he became aware of an auto close\r\nbeside the carriage keeping pace with it, and two men stretching their\r\nnecks as if to look into the carriage window at him. He withdrew to the\r\nshadow instantly so that they could not see him, but the one quick\r\nglance he had made him sure that one of his pursuers was the short\r\nthick-set man with the cruel jaw who had sat across from him at the\r\ndinner-table a few minutes before. If this were so he had practically\r\nno chance at all of escape, for what was a carriage against a swift\r\nmoving car and what was he against a whole city full of strangers and\r\nenemies? If he attempted to drop from the carriage on the other side\r\nand escape into the darkness he had but a chance of a thousand at not\r\nbeing seen, and he could not hope to hide and get away in this unknown\r\npart of the city. Yet he must take his chance somehow, for the carriage\r\nmust sooner or later get somewhere and he be obliged to face his\r\npursuers.\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, just at the instant when he had decided to jump\r\nat the next dark place and was measuring the distance with his eye, his\r\nhand even being outstretched to grasp the door handle, a blustering,\r\nboisterous motor-cycle burst into full bloom just where he intended\r\nto jump, and the man who rode it was in uniform. He dodged back into\r\nthe darkness of the carriage again that he might not be seen, and\r\nthe motor-cycle came so near that its rider turned a white face and\r\nlooked in. He felt that his time had come, and his cause was lost. It\r\nhad not yet occurred to him that the men who were pursuing him would\r\nhardly be likely to call in municipal aid in their search, lest their\r\nown duplicity would be discovered. He reasoned that he was dealing\r\nwith desperate men who would stop at nothing to get back the original\r\ncipher paper, and stop his mouth. He was well aware that only death\r\nwould be considered a sufficient silencer for him after what he had\r\nseen at Mr. Holman’s dinner-table, for the evidence he could give would\r\ninvolve the honor of every man who had sat there. He saw in a flash\r\nthat the two henchmen whom he was sure were even now riding in the car\r\non his right had been at the table for the purpose of silencing him\r\nif he showed any signs of giving trouble. The wonder was that any of\r\nthem dared call in a stranger on a matter of such grave import which\r\nmeant ruin to them all if they were found out, but probably they had\r\nreasoned that every man had his price and had intended to offer him a\r\nshare of the booty. It was likely that the chief had caused it to be\r\nunderstood by them that he was the right kind of man for their purpose.\r\nYet, of course, they had taken precautions, and now they had him well\r\ncaught, an auto on one side, a motor-cycle on the other and no telling\r\nhow many more behind! He had been a fool to get into this carriage.\r\nHe might have known it would only trap him to his death. There seemed\r\nabsolutely no chance for escape now--yet he must fight to the last. He\r\nput his hand on his revolver to make sure it was easy to get at, tried\r\nto think whether it would not be better to chew up and swallow that\r\ncipher message rather than to run the risk of its falling again into\r\nthe hands of the enemy; decided that he must carry it intact to his\r\nchief if possible; and finally that he must make a dash for safety at\r\nonce, when just then the carriage turned briskly into a wide driveway,\r\nand the attendant auto and motor-cycle dropped behind as if puzzled at\r\nthe move. The carriage stopped short and a bright light from an open\r\ndoorway was flung into his face. There seemed to be high stone walls on\r\none side and the lighted doorway on the other hand evidently led into\r\na great stone building. He could hear the puffing of the car and cycle\r\njust behind. A wild notion that the carriage had been placed in front\r\nof the house to trap him in case he tried to escape, and that he had\r\nbeen brought to prison, flitted through his mind.\r\n\r\nHis hand was on his revolver as the coachman jumped down to fling open\r\nthe carriage door, for he intended to fight for his liberty to the last.\r\n\r\nHe glanced back through the carriage window, and the lights of the auto\r\nglared in his face. The short, thick-set man was getting out of the\r\ncar, and the motor-cyclist had stood his machine up against the wall\r\nand was coming toward the carriage. Escape was going to be practically\r\nimpossible. A wild thought of dashing out the opposite door of his\r\ncarriage, boldly seizing the motor-cycle and making off on it passed\r\nthrough his mind, and then the door on his left was flung open and the\r\ncarriage was immediately surrounded by six excited men in evening dress\r\nall talking at once. “Here you are at last!” they chorused.\r\n\r\n“Where is the best man?” shouted some one from the doorway. “Hasn’t\r\nhe come either?” And as if in answer one of the men by the carriage\r\ndoor wheeled and called excitedly: “Yes, he’s come! Tell him--tell\r\nJeff--tell him he’s come.” Then turning once more to Gordon he seized\r\nhim by the arm and cried: “Come on quickly! There isn’t a minute to\r\nwait. The organist is fairly frantic. Everybody has been just as\r\nnervous as could be. We couldn’t very well go on without you--you know.\r\nBut don’t let that worry you. It’s all right now you’ve come. Forget\r\nit, old man, and hustle.” Dimly Gordon perceived above the sound of\r\nsubdued hubbub that an organ was playing, and even as he listened it\r\nburst into the joyous notes of the wedding march. It dawned upon him\r\nthat this was not a prison to which he had come but a church--not a\r\ncourt-room but a wedding, and horror of horrors! they took him for the\r\nbest man. His disguise had been his undoing. How was he to get out of\r\nthis scrape? And with his pursuers just behind!\r\n\r\n“Let me explain----” he began, and wondered what he could explain.\r\n\r\n“There’s no time for explanations now, man. I tell you the organ has\r\nbegun the march. We’re expected to be marching down that middle aisle\r\nthis very minute and Jeff is waiting for us in the chapel. I sent the\r\nsignal to the bride and another to the organist the minute we sighted\r\nyou. Come on! Everybody knows your boat was late in coming in. You\r\ndon’t need to explain a thing till afterwards.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment one of the ushers moved aside and the short, thick-set\r\nman stepped between, the light shining full upon his face, and Gordon\r\nknew him positively for the man who had sat opposite him at the table a\r\nfew minutes before. He was peering eagerly into the carriage door and\r\nGordon saw his only escape was into the church. With his heart pounding\r\nlike a trip hammer he yielded himself to the six ushers, who swept the\r\nlittle pursuer aside as if he had been a fly and literally bore Gordon\r\nup the steps and into the church door.\r\n\r\nA burst of music filled his senses, and dazzling lights, glimpses\r\nof flowers, palms and beautiful garments bewildered him. His one\r\nthought was for escape from his pursuers. Would they follow him into\r\nthe church and drag him out in the presence of all these people, or\r\nwould they be thrown off the track for a little while and give him\r\nopportunity yet to get away? He looked around wildly for a place of\r\nexit but he was in the hands of the insistent ushers. One of them\r\nchattered to him in a low, growling whisper, such as men use on solemn\r\noccasions:\r\n\r\n“It must have been rough on you being anxious like this about getting\r\nhere, but never mind now. It’ll go all right. Come on. Here’s our\r\ncue and there stands Jefferson over there. You and he go in with the\r\nminister, you know. The groom and the best man, you understand, they’ll\r\ntell you when. Jeff has the ring all right, so you won’t need to bother\r\nabout that. There’s absolutely nothing for you to do but stand where\r\nyou’re put and go out when the rest do. You needn’t feel a bit nervous.”\r\n\r\nWas it possible that these crazy people didn’t recognize their mistake\r\neven yet here in the bright light? Couldn’t they see his mustache was\r\nstuck on and one eyebrow was crooked? Didn’t they know their best man\r\nwell enough to recognize his voice? Surely, surely, some one would\r\ndiscover the mistake soon--that man Jeff over there who was eyeing him\r\nso intently. He would be sure to know this was not his friend. Yet\r\nevery minute that they continued to think so was a distinct gain for\r\nGordon, puzzling his pursuers and giving himself time to think and plan\r\nand study his strange surroundings.\r\n\r\nAnd now they were drawing him forward and a turn of his head gave him\r\na vision of the stubbed head of the thick-set man peering in at the\r\nchapel door and watching him eagerly. He must fool him if possible.\r\n\r\n“But I don’t know anything about the arrangements,” faltered Gordon,\r\nreflecting that the best man might not be very well known to the ushers\r\nand perhaps he resembled him. It was not the first time he had been\r\ntaken for another man--and with his present make-up and all, perhaps it\r\nwas natural. Could he possibly hope to bluff it out for a few minutes\r\nuntil the ceremony was over and then escape? It would of course be the\r\nbest way imaginable to throw that impudent little man in the doorway\r\noff his track. If the real best man would only stay away long enough\r\nit would not be a difficult part to play. The original man might turn\r\nup after he was gone and create a pleasant little mystery, but nobody\r\nwould be injured thereby. All this passed through his mind while the\r\nusher kept up his sepulchral whisper:\r\n\r\n“Why, there are just the usual arrangements, you know--nothing new.\r\nYou and Jeff go in after the ushers have reached the back of the church\r\nand opened the door. Then you just stand there till Celia and her uncle\r\ncome up the aisle. Then follows the ceremony--very brief. Celia had\r\nall that repeating after the minister cut out on account of not being\r\nable to rehearse. It’s to be just the simplest service, not the usual\r\nlengthy affair. Don’t worry, you’ll be all right, old man. Hurry!\r\nThey’re calling you. Leave your hat right here. Now I must go. Keep\r\ncool. It’ll soon be over.”\r\n\r\nThe breathless usher hurried through the door and settled into a sort\r\nof exalted hobble to the time of the wonderful Lohengrin music. Gordon\r\nturned, thinking even yet to make a possible escape, but the eagle-eye\r\nof his pursuer was upon him and the man Jefferson was by his side:\r\n\r\n“Here we are!” he said, eagerly grabbing Gordon’s hat and coat and\r\ndumping them on a chair. “I’ll look after everything. Just come along.\r\nIt’s time we went in. The doctor is motioning for us. Awfully glad to\r\nsee you at last. Too bad you had to rush so. How many years is it since\r\nI saw you? Ten! You’ve changed some, but you’re looking fine and dandy.\r\nNo need to worry about anything. It’ll soon be over and the knot tied.”\r\n\r\nMechanically Gordon fell into place beside the man Jefferson, who was\r\na pleasant-faced youth, well-groomed and handsome. Looking furtively\r\nat his finely-cut, happy features, Gordon wondered if he would feel\r\nas glad as this youth seemed to be, when he walked down the aisle to\r\nmeet his bride. How, by the way, would he feel if he were going to be\r\nmarried now,--going into the face of this great company of well-dressed\r\npeople to meet Miss Julia Bentley and be joined to her for life?\r\nInstinctively his soul shrank within him at the thought.\r\n\r\nBut now the door was wide open, the organ pealing its best, and he\r\nsuddenly became aware of many eyes, and of wondering how long his\r\neyebrows would withstand the perspiration that was trickling softly\r\ndown his forehead. His mustache--ridiculous appendage! why had he not\r\nremoved it?--was it awry? Dared he put up his hand to see? His gloves!\r\nWould anyone notice that they were not as strictly fresh as a best\r\nman’s gloves should be? Then he took his first step to the music, and\r\nit was like being pulled from a delicious morning nap and plunged into\r\na tub of icy water.\r\n\r\nHe walked with feet that suddenly weighed like lead, across a church\r\nthat looked to be miles in width, in the face of swarms of curious\r\neyes. He tried to reflect that these people were all strangers to him,\r\nthat they were not looking at him, anyway, but at the bridegroom by\r\nhis side, and that it mattered very little what he did, so long as he\r\nkept still and braved it out, if only the real best man didn’t turn up\r\nuntil he was well out of the church. Then he could vanish in the dark,\r\nand go by some back way to a car or a taxicab and so to the station.\r\nThe thought of the paper inside the gold pencil-case filled him with\r\na sort of elation. If only he could get out of this dreadful church,\r\nhe would probably get away safely. Perhaps even the incident of the\r\nwedding might prove to be his protection, for they would never seek him\r\nin a crowded church at a fashionable wedding.\r\n\r\nThe man by his side managed him admirably, giving him a whispered\r\nhint, a shove, or a push now and then, and getting him into the proper\r\nposition. It seemed as if the best man had to occupy the most trying\r\nspot in all the church, but as they put him there, of course it was\r\nright. He glanced furtively over the faces near the front, and they all\r\nlooked quite satisfied, as if everything were going as it should, so he\r\nsettled down to his fate, his white, strained face partly hidden by the\r\nabundant display of mustache and eyebrow. People whispered softly how\r\nhandsome he looked, and some suggested that he was not so stout as when\r\nthey had last seen him, ten years before. His stay in a foreign land\r\nmust have done him good. One woman went so far as to tell her daughter\r\nthat he was far more distinguished-looking than she had ever thought he\r\ncould become, but it was wonderful what a stay in a foreign land would\r\ndo to improve a person.\r\n\r\nThe music stole onward; and slowly, gracefully, like the opening of\r\nbuds into flowers, the bridal party inched along up the middle aisle\r\nuntil at last the bride in all the mystery of her white veil arrived,\r\nand all the maidens in their flowers and many colored gauzes were\r\nsuitably disposed about her.\r\n\r\nThe feeble old man on whose arm the bride had leaned as she came up\r\nthe aisle dropped out of the procession, melting into one of the front\r\nseats, and Gordon found himself standing beside the bride. He felt sure\r\nthere must be something wrong about it, and looked at his young guide\r\nwith an attempt to change places with him, but the man named Jefferson\r\nheld him in place with a warning eye. “You’re all right. Just stay\r\nwhere you are,” he whispered softly, and Gordon stayed, reflecting on\r\nthe strange fashions of weddings, and wondering why he had never before\r\ntaken notice of just how a wedding party came in and stood and got out\r\nagain. If he was only out of this how glad he would be. It seemed one\r\nhad to be a pretty all-around man to be a member of the Secret Service.\r\n\r\nThe organ had hushed its voice to a sort of exultant sobbing, filled\r\nwith dreams of flowers and joys, and hints of sorrow; and the minister\r\nin a voice both impressive and musical began the ceremony. Gordon stood\r\ndoggedly and wondered if that really was one eyebrow coming down over\r\nhis eye, or only a drop of perspiration.\r\n\r\nAnother full second passed, and he decided that if he ever got out\r\nof this situation alive he would never, no, never, no, _never_, get\r\nmarried himself.\r\n\r\nDuring the next second that crawled by he became supremely conscious\r\nof the creature in white by his side. A desire possessed him to look\r\nat her and see if she were like Julia Bentley. It was like a nightmare\r\nhaunting his dreams that she _was_ Julia Bentley somehow transported\r\nto New York and being married to him willy-nilly. He could not shake\r\nit off, and the other eyebrow began to feel shaky. He was sure it was\r\nsailing down over his eye. If he only dared press its adhesive lining a\r\nlittle tighter to his flesh!\r\n\r\nSome time during the situation there came a prayer, interminable to his\r\nexcited imagination, as all the other ceremonies.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of the hush and the supposedly bowed heads, Gordon turned\r\ndesperately toward the bride. He must see her and drive this phantasm\r\nfrom his brain. He turned, half expecting to see Julia’s tall,\r\nhandsome form, though telling himself he was a fool, and wondering why\r\nhe so dreaded the idea. Then his gaze was held fascinated.\r\n\r\nShe was a little creature, slender and young and very beautiful,\r\nwith a beauty which a deathly pallor only enhanced. Her face was\r\ndelicately cut, and set in a frame of fine dark hair, the whole made\r\nmost exquisite by the mist of white tulle that breathed itself about\r\nher like real mist over a flower. But the lovely head drooped, the\r\ncoral lips had a look of unutterable sadness, and the long lashes swept\r\nover white cheeks. He could not take his eyes from her now that he had\r\nlooked. How lovely, and how fitting for the delightful youth by his\r\nside! Now that he thought of it she was like him, only smaller and more\r\ndelicate, of course. A sudden fierce, ridiculous feeling of envy filled\r\nGordon’s heart. Why couldn’t he have known and loved a girl like that?\r\nWhy had Julia Bentley been forever in his pathway as the girl laid out\r\nfor his choice?\r\n\r\nHe looked at her with such intensity that a couple of dear old sisters\r\nwho listened to the prayer with their eyes wide open, whispered one to\r\nthe other: “Just see him look at her! How he must love her! Wasn’t it\r\nbeautiful that he should come right from the steamer to the church and\r\nnever see her till now, for the first time in ten long years. It’s so\r\nromantic!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” whispered the other; “and I believe it’ll last. He looks at her\r\nthat way. Only I do dislike that way of arranging the hair on his face.\r\nBut then it’s foreign I suppose. He’ll probably get over it if they\r\nstay in this country.”\r\n\r\nA severe old lady in the seat in front turned a reprimanding chin\r\ntoward them and they subsided. Still Gordon continued to gaze.\r\n\r\nThen the bride became aware of his look, raised her eyes, and--they\r\nwere full of tears!\r\n\r\nThey gave him one reproachful glance that shot through his soul like a\r\nsword, and her lashes drooped again. By some mysterious control over\r\nthe law of gravity, the tears remained unshed, and the man’s gaze was\r\nturned aside; but that look had done its mighty work.\r\n\r\nAll the experiences of the day rushed over him and seemed to culminate\r\nin that one look. It was as if the reproach of all things had come upon\r\nhim. The hurt in the white dog’s eyes had touched him, the perfect\r\ncourage in the appeal of the child’s eyes had called forth his deepest\r\nsympathy, but the tears of this exquisite woman wrung his heart. He saw\r\nnow that the appeal of the dog and the child had been the opening wedge\r\nfor the look of a woman, which tore self from him and flung it at her\r\nfeet for her to walk upon; and when the prayer was ended he found that\r\nhe was trembling.\r\n\r\nHe looked vindictively at the innocent youth beside him, as the soft\r\nrustle of the audience and the little breath of relief from the\r\nbridal party betokened the next stage in the ceremony. What had this\r\ninnocent-looking youth done to cause tears in those lovely eyes? Was\r\nshe marrying him against her will? He was only a boy, anyway. What\r\nright had he to suppose he could care for a delicate creature like\r\nthat? He was making her cry already, and he seemed to be utterly\r\nunconscious of it. What could be the matter? Gordon felt a desire to\r\nkick him.\r\n\r\nThen it occurred to him that inadvertently _he_ might have been the\r\ncause of her tears; he, supposedly the best man, who had been late, and\r\nheld up the wedding no knowing how long. Of course it wasn’t really\r\nhis fault; but by proxy it was, for he now was masquerading as that\r\nunlucky best man, and she was very likely reproaching him for what she\r\nsupposed was his stupidity. He had heard that women cried sometimes\r\nfrom vexation, disappointment or excitement.\r\n\r\nYet in his heart of hearts he could not set those tears, that look,\r\ndown to so trivial a cause. They had reached his very soul, and he\r\nfelt there was something deeper there than mere vexation. There had\r\nbeen bitter reproach for a deep wrong done. The glance had told him\r\nthat. All the manhood in him rose to defend her against whoever had\r\nhurt her. He longed to get one more look into her eyes to make quite\r\nsure; and then, if there was still appeal there, his soul must answer\r\nit.\r\n\r\nFor the moment his commission, his ridiculous situation, the real peril\r\nto his life and trust, were forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe man Jefferson had produced a ring and was nudging him. It appeared\r\nthat the best man had some part to play with that ring. He dimly\r\nremembered somewhere hearing that the best man must hand the ring to\r\nthe bridegroom at the proper moment, but it was absurd for them to go\r\nthrough the farce of doing that when the bridegroom already held the\r\ngolden circlet in his fingers! Why did he not step up like a man and\r\nput it upon the outstretched hand; that little white hand just in front\r\nof him there, so timidly held out with its glove fingers tucked back,\r\nlike a dove crept out from its covert unwillingly?\r\n\r\nBut that Jefferson-man still held out the ring stupidly to him, and\r\nevidently expected him to take it. Silly youth! There was nothing for\r\nit but to take it and hand it back, of course. He must do as he was\r\ntold and hasten that awful ceremony to its interminable close. He took\r\nthe ring and held it out, but the young man did not take it again.\r\nInstead he whispered, “Put it on her finger!”\r\n\r\nGordon frowned. Could he be hearing aright? Why didn’t the fellow put\r\nthe ring on his own bride? If he were being married, he would knock any\r\nman down that dared to put his wife’s wedding ring on for him. Could\r\nthat be the silly custom now, to have the best man put the bride’s ring\r\non? How unutterably out of place! But he must not make a scene, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe little timid hand, so slender and white, came a shade nearer as if\r\nto help, and the ring finger separated itself from the others.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the smooth circlet. It seemed too tiny for any woman’s\r\nfinger. Then, reverently, he slipped it on, with a strange,\r\ninexpressible longing to touch the little hand. While he was thinking\r\nhimself all kinds of a fool, and was enjoying one of his intermittent\r\nvisions of Julia Bentley’s expressive countenance interpolated on the\r\npresent scene, a strange thing happened.\r\n\r\nThere had been some low murmurs and motions which he had not noticed\r\nbecause he thought his part of this very uncomfortable affair was\r\nabout concluded, when, lo and behold, the minister and the young man\r\nby his side both began fumbling for his hand, and among them they\r\nmanaged to bring it into position and place in its astonished grasp the\r\nlittle timid hand that he had just crowned with its ring.\r\n\r\nAs his fingers closed over the bride’s hand, there was such reverence,\r\nsuch tenderness in his touch that the girl’s eyes were raised once more\r\nto his face, this time with the conquered tears in retreat, but all the\r\npain and appeal still there. He looked and involuntarily he pressed her\r\nhand the closer, as if to promise aforetime whatever she would ask.\r\nThen, with her hand in his, and with the realization that they two\r\nwere detached as it were from the rest of the wedding party, standing\r\nin a little centre of their own, his senses came back to him, and he\r\nperceived as in a flash of understanding that it was _they_ who were\r\nbeing married!\r\n\r\nThere had been some terrible, unexplainable mistake, and he was\r\nstupidly standing in another man’s place, taking life vows upon\r\nhimself! The thing had passed from an adventure of little moment into a\r\nmatter of a life-tragedy, two life-tragedies perhaps! What should he do?\r\n\r\nWith the question came the words, “I pronounce you husband and wife,”\r\nand “let no man put asunder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat had he done? Was it some great unnamed, unheard-of crime he had\r\nunconsciously committed? Could anyone understand or excuse such asinine\r\nstupidity? Could he ever hold up his head again, though he fled to\r\nthe most distant part of the globe? Was there nothing that could save\r\nthe situation? Now, before they left the church, could he not declare\r\nthe truth, and set things right, undo the words that had been spoken\r\nin the presence of all these witnesses, and send out to find the real\r\nbridegroom? Surely neither law nor gospel could endorse a bond made in\r\nthe ignorance of either participant. It would, of course, be a terrible\r\nthing for the bride, but better now than later. Besides, he was pledged\r\nby that hand-clasp to answer the appeal in her eyes and protect her.\r\nThis, then, was what it had meant!\r\n\r\nBut his commission! What of that? “A matter of life and death!” Ah! but\r\nthis was _more_ than life or death!\r\n\r\nWhile these rapid thoughts were flashing through his brain, the\r\nbenediction was being pronounced, and with the last word the organ\r\npealed forth its triumphant lay. The audience stirred excitedly,\r\nanticipating the final view of the wedding procession.\r\n\r\nThe bride turned to take her bouquet from the maid of honor, and the\r\nmovement broke the spell under which Gordon had been held.\r\n\r\nHe turned to the young man by his side and spoke hurriedly in a low\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“An awful mistake has been made,” he said, and the organ drowned\r\neverything but the word “mistake.” “I don’t know what to do,” he went\r\non. But young Jefferson hastened to reassure him joyously:\r\n\r\n“Not a bit of it, old chap. Nobody noticed that hitch about the ring.\r\nIt was only a second. Everything went off slick. You haven’t anything\r\nmore to do now but take my sister out. Look alive, there! She looks as\r\nif she might be going to faint! She hasn’t been a bit well all day!\r\nSteady her, quick, can’t you? She’ll stick it out till she gets to the\r\nair, but hurry, for goodness’ sake!”\r\n\r\nGordon turned in alarm. Already the frail white bride had a claim on\r\nhim. His first duty was to get her out of this crowd. Perhaps, after\r\nall, she had discovered that he was not the right man, and that was the\r\nmeaning of her tears and appeal. Yet she had held her own and allowed\r\nthings to go through to the finish, and perhaps he had no right to\r\nreveal to the assembled multitudes what she evidently wanted kept\r\nquiet. He must wait till he could ask her. He must do as this other man\r\nsaid--this--this brother of hers--who was of course the best man. Oh,\r\nfool, and blind! Why had he not understood at the beginning and got\r\nhimself out of this fix before it was too late? And what should he do\r\nwhen he reached the door? How could he ever explain? His commission! He\r\ndared not breathe a word of that? What explanation could he possibly\r\noffer for his--his--yes----his _criminal_ conduct? Why, no such thing\r\nwas ever heard of in the history of mankind as that which had happened\r\nto him. From start to finish it was--it--was---- He could not think of\r\nwords to express what it was.\r\n\r\nHe was by this time meandering jerkily down the aisle, attempting to\r\nkeep time to the music and look the part that she evidently expected\r\nhim to play, but his eyes were upon her face, which was whiter now and,\r\nif possible, lovelier, than before.\r\n\r\n“Oh, just see how devoted he is,” murmured the eldest of the two dear\r\nold sisters, and he caught the sense of her words as he passed, and\r\nwondered. Then, immediately before him, retreating backward down the\r\naisle with terrible eyes of scorn upon him, he seemed to feel the\r\npresence of Miss Julia Bentley leading onward toward the church door;\r\nbut he would not take his eyes from that sweet, sad face of the white\r\nbride on his arm to look. He somehow knew that if he could hold out\r\nuntil he reached that door without looking up, her power over him would\r\nbe exorcised forever.\r\n\r\nOut into the vacant vestibule, under the tented canopy, alone together\r\nfor the moment, he felt her gentle weight grow heavy on his arm, and\r\nknew her footsteps were lagging. Instinctively, lest others should\r\ngather around them, he almost lifted her and bore her down the carpeted\r\nsteps, through the covered pathway, to the luxurious motor-car waiting\r\nwith open door, and placed her on the cushions. Some one closed the car\r\ndoor and almost immediately they were in motion.\r\n\r\nShe settled back with a half sigh, as if she could not have borne\r\none instant more of strain, then sitting opposite he adjusted the\r\nwindow to give her air. She seemed grateful but said nothing. Her eyes\r\nwere closed wearily, and the whole droop of her figure showed utter\r\nexhaustion. It seemed a desecration to speak to her, yet he must have\r\nsome kind of an understanding before they reached their destination.\r\n\r\n“An explanation is due to you----” he began, without knowing just what\r\nhe was going to say, but she put out her hand with a weary protest.\r\n\r\n“Oh, please don’t!” she pleaded. “I know--the boat was late! It doesn’t\r\nmatter in the least.”\r\n\r\nHe sat back appalled! She did not herself know then that she had\r\nmarried the wrong man!\r\n\r\n“But you don’t understand,” he protested.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” she moaned. “I don’t want to understand. Nothing can\r\nchange things. Only, let me be quiet till we get to the house, or I\r\nnever can go through with the rest of it.”\r\n\r\nHer words ended with almost a sob, and he sat silent for an instant,\r\nwith a mingling of emotions, uppermost of which was a desire to take\r\nthe little, white, shrinking girl into his arms and comfort her,\r\n“Nothing can change things!” That sounded as though she did know\r\nbut thought it too late to undo the great mistake now that it had\r\nbeen made. He must let her know that he had not understood until the\r\nceremony was over. While he sat helplessly looking at her in the\r\ndimness of the car where she looked so small and sad and misty huddled\r\nbeside her great bouquet, she opened her eyes and looked at him. She\r\nseemed to understand that he was about to speak again. By the great arc\r\nlight they were passing he saw there were tears in her eyes again, and\r\nher voice held a child-like pleading as she uttered one word:\r\n\r\n“Don’t!”\r\n\r\nIt hurt him like a knife, he knew not why. But he could not resist the\r\nappeal. Duty or no duty, he could not disobey her command.\r\n\r\n“Very well.” He said it quietly, almost tenderly, and sat back with\r\nfolded arms. After all, what explanation could he give her that she\r\nwould believe? He might not breathe a word of his commission or\r\nthe message. What other reason could he give for his extraordinary\r\nappearance at her wedding and by her side?\r\n\r\nThe promise in his voice seemed to give her relief. She breathed a\r\nsigh of relief and closed her eyes. He must just keep still and have\r\nhis eyes open for a chance to escape when the carriage reached its\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nThus silently they threaded through unknown streets, strange thoughts\r\nin the heart of each. The bride was struggling with her heavy burden,\r\nand the man was trying to think his way out of the maze of perplexity\r\ninto which he had unwittingly wandered. He tried to set his thoughts\r\nin order and find out just what to do. First of all, of course came\r\nhis commission, but somehow every time the little white bride opposite\r\ntook first place in his mind. Could he serve both? What _would_ serve\r\nboth, and what would serve _either_? As for himself, he was free to\r\nconfess that there was no room left in the present situation for even\r\na consideration of his own interests.\r\n\r\nWhatever there was of good in him must go now to set matters right\r\nin which he had greatly blundered. He must do the best he could for\r\nthe girl who had so strangely crossed his pathway, and get back to\r\nhis commission. But when he tried to realize the importance of his\r\ncommission and set it over against the interests of the girl-bride, his\r\nmind became confused. What should he do! He could not think of slipping\r\naway and leaving her without further words, even if an opportunity\r\noffered itself. Perhaps he was wrong. Doubtless his many friends might\r\ntell him so if they were consulted, but he did not intend to consult\r\nthem. He intended to see this troubled soul to some place of safety,\r\nand look out for his commission as best he could afterward. One thing\r\nhe did not fully realize, and that was that Miss Julia Bentley’s vision\r\ntroubled him no longer. He was free. There was only one woman in the\r\nwhole wide world that gave him any concern, and that was the little\r\nsorrowful creature who sat opposite to him, and to whom he had just\r\nbeen married.\r\n\r\nJust been married! He! The thought brought with it a thrill of wonder,\r\nand a something else that was not unpleasant. What if he really had?\r\nOf course he had not. Of course such a thing could not hold good. But\r\nwhat if he had! Just for an instant he entertained the thought--would\r\nhe be glad or sorry? He did not know her, of course, had heard her\r\nspeak but a few words, had looked into her face plainly but once, and\r\nyet suppose she were his! His heart answered the question with a glad\r\nbound that astonished him, and all his former ideas of real love were\r\nswept from his mind in a breath. He knew that, stranger though she\r\nwas, he could take her to his heart; cherish her, love her and bear\r\nwith her, as he never could have done Julia Bentley. Then all at once\r\nhe realized that he was allowing his thoughts to dwell upon a woman\r\nwho by all that was holy belonged to another man, and that other man\r\nwould doubtless soon be the one with whom he would have to deal. He\r\nwould soon be face to face with a new phase of the situation and he\r\nmust prepare himself to meet it. What was he going to do? Should he\r\nplan to escape from the opposite door of the automobile while the bride\r\nwas being assisted from her seat? No, he could not, for he would be\r\nexpected to get out first and help her out. Besides, there would be too\r\nmany around, and he could not possibly get away. But, greater than any\r\nsuch reason, the thing that held him bound was the look in her eyes\r\nthrough the tears. He simply could not leave her until he knew that\r\nshe no longer needed him. And yet there was his commission! Well, he\r\nmust see her in the hands of those who would care for her at least. So\r\nmuch he had done even for the white dog, and then, too, surely she was\r\nworth as many minutes of his time as he had been compelled to give to\r\nthe injured child of the streets. If he only could explain to her now!\r\n\r\nThe thought of his message, with its terrible significance, safe in\r\nhis possession, sent shivers of anxiety through his frame! Suppose\r\nhe should be caught, and it taken from him, all on account of this\r\nmost impossible incident! What scorn, what contumely, would be his!\r\nHow could he ever explain to his chief? Would anybody living believe\r\nthat a man in his senses could be married to a stranger before a\r\nwhole church full of people, and not know he was being married until\r\nthe deed was done--and then not do anything about it after it was\r\ndone? That was what he was doing now this very minute. He ought to be\r\nexplaining something somehow to that poor little creature in the shadow\r\nof the carriage. Perhaps in some way it might relieve her sorrow if he\r\ndid, and yet when he looked at her and tried to speak his mouth was\r\nhopelessly closed. He might not tell her anything!\r\n\r\nHe gradually sifted his immediate actions down to two necessities;\r\nto get his companion to a safe place where her friends could care for\r\nher, and to make his escape as soon and as swiftly as possible. It was\r\nawful to run and leave her without telling her anything about it; when\r\nshe evidently believed him to be the man she had promised and intended\r\nto marry; but the real bridegroom would surely turn up soon somehow\r\nand make matters right. Anyhow, it was the least he could do to take\r\nhimself out of her way, and to get his trust to its owners at once.\r\n\r\nThe car halted suddenly before a brightly lighted mansion, whose tented\r\nentrance effectually shut out the gaze of alien eyes, and made the\r\ntransit from car to domicile entirely private. There was no opportunity\r\nhere to disappear. The sidewalk and road were black with curious\r\nonlookers. He stepped from the car first and helped the lady out. He\r\nbore her heavy bouquet because she looked literally too frail to carry\r\nit further herself.\r\n\r\nIn the doorway she was surrounded by a bevy of servants, foremost among\r\nwhom her old nurse claimed the privilege of greeting her with tears and\r\nsmiles and many “Miss-Celia-my-dears,” and Gordon stood for the instant\r\nentranced, watching the sweet play of loving kindness in the face of\r\nthe pale little bride. As soon as he could lay down those flowers\r\ninconspicuously he would be on the alert for a way of escape. It\r\nsurely would be found through some back or side entrance of the house.\r\n\r\nBut even as the thought came to him the old nurse stepped back to let\r\nthe other servants greet the bride with stiff bows and embarrassed\r\nwords of blessing, and he felt a hand laid heavily on his arm.\r\n\r\nHe started as he turned, thinking instantly again of his commission and\r\nexpecting to see a policeman in uniform by his side, but it was only\r\nthe old nurse, with tears of devotion still in her faded eyes.\r\n\r\n“Mister George, ye hevn’t forgot me, hev ye?” she asked, earnestly.\r\n“You usen’t to like me verra well, I mind, but ye was awful for the\r\nteasin’ an’ I was always for my Miss Celie! But bygones is bygones now\r\nan’ I wish ye well. Yer growed a man, an’ I know ye must be worthy o’\r\nher, or she’d never hev consented to take ye. Yev got a gude wife an’\r\nno mistake, an’ I know ye’ll be the happiest man alive. Ye won’t hold\r\nit against me, Mister George, that I used to tell yer uncle on your\r\nmasterful tricks, will ye? You mind I was only carin’ fer my baby girl,\r\nan’ ye were but a boy.”\r\n\r\nShe paused as if expecting an answer, and Gordon embarrassedly assured\r\nher that he would never think of holding so trifling a matter against\r\nher. He cast a look of reverent admiration and tenderness toward the\r\nbeautiful girl who was smiling on her loyal subjects like a queen,\r\nroused from her sorrow to give joy to others; and even her old nurse\r\nwas satisfied.\r\n\r\n“Ah, ye luve her, Mister George, don’t ye?” the nurse questioned. “I\r\ndon’t wonder. Everybody what lays eyes on her luves her. She’s that\r\ndear----” here the tears got the better of the good woman for an\r\ninstant and she forgot herself and pulled at the skirt of her new black\r\ndress thinking it was an apron, and wishing to wipe her eyes.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly Gordon found his lips uttering strange words, without his\r\nown apparent consent, as if his heart had suddenly taken things in hand\r\nand determined to do as it pleased without consulting his judgment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I love her,” he was saying, and to his amazement he found that\r\nthe words were true.\r\n\r\nThis discovery made matters still more complicated.\r\n\r\n“Then ye’ll promise me something, Mister George, won’t ye?” said the\r\nnurse eagerly, her tears having their own way down her rosy anxious\r\nface. “Ye’ll promise me never to make her feel bad any more? She’s\r\ncried a lot these last three months, an’ nobody knows but me. She could\r\nhide it from them all but her old nurse that has loved her so long. But\r\nshe’s been that sorrowful, enough fer a whole lifetime. Promise that\r\nye’ll do all in yer power to make her happy always.”\r\n\r\n“I will do all in my power to make her happy,” he said, solemnly, as if\r\nhe were uttering a vow, and wondered how short-lived that power was to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wedding party had arrived in full force now. Carriages and\r\nautomobiles were unloading; gay voices and laughter filled the house.\r\nThe servants disappeared to their places, and the white bride, with\r\nonly a motioning look toward Gordon, led the way to the place where\r\nthey were to stand under an arch of roses, lilies and palms, in a\r\nroom hung from the ceiling with drooping ferns and white carnations\r\non invisible threads of silver wire, until it all seemed like a fairy\r\ndream.\r\n\r\nGordon had no choice but to follow, as his way was blocked by the\r\nincoming guests, and he foresaw that his exit would have to be made\r\nfrom some other door than the front if he were to escape yet awhile.\r\nAs he stepped into the mystery of the flower-scented room where his\r\nlady led the way, he was conscious of a feeling of transition from the\r\nworld of ordinary things into one of wonder, beauty and mysterious joy;\r\nbut all the time he knew he was an impostor, who had no right in that\r\nsilver-threaded bower.\r\n\r\nYet there he stood bowing, shaking hands, and smirking behind his false\r\nmustache, which threatened every minute to betray him.\r\n\r\nPeople told him he was looking well, and congratulated him on his\r\nbride. Some said he was stouter than when he left the country, and\r\nsome said he was thinner. They asked him questions about relatives\r\nand friends living and dead, and he ran constant risk of getting into\r\nhopeless difficulties. His only safety was in smiling, and saying very\r\nlittle; seeming not to hear some questions, and answering others with\r\nanother question. It was not so hard after he got started, because\r\nthere were so many people, and they kept coming close upon one another,\r\nso no one had much time to talk. Then supper with its formalities was\r\ngot through with somehow, though to Gordon, with his already satisfied\r\nappetite and his hampering mustache, it seemed an endless ordeal.\r\n\r\n“Jeff,” as they all called him, was everywhere, attending to\r\neverything, and he slipped up to the unwilling bridegroom just as he\r\nwas having to answer a very difficult question about the lateness of\r\nhis vessel, and the kind of passage they had experienced in crossing.\r\nBy this time Gordon had discovered that he was supposed to have been\r\nten years abroad, and his steamer had been late in landing, but where\r\nhe came from or what he had been doing over there were still to be\r\nfound out; and it was extremely puzzling to be asked from what port he\r\nhad sailed, and how he came to be there when he had been supposed to\r\nhave been in St. Petersburg but the week before? His state of mind was\r\nanything but enviable. Besides all this, Gordon was just reflecting\r\nthat the last he had seen of his hat and coat was in the church. What\r\nhad become of them, and how could he go to the station without a hat?\r\nThen opportunely “Jeff” arrived.\r\n\r\n“Your train leaves at ten three,” he said in a low, business-like tone,\r\nas if he enjoyed the importance of having made all the arrangements.\r\n“I’ve secured the stateroom as you cabled me to do, and here are the\r\ntickets and checks. The trunks are down there all checked. Celia didn’t\r\nwant any nonsense about their being tied up with white ribbon. She\r\nhates all that. We’ve arranged for you to slip out by the fire-escape\r\nand down through the back yard of the next neighbor, where a motor,\r\njust a plain regular one from the station, will be waiting around the\r\ncorner in the shadow. Celia knows where it is. None of the party will\r\nknow you are gone until you are well under way. The car they think you\r\nwill take is being elaborately adorned with white at the front door\r\nnow, but you won’t have any trouble about it. I’ve fixed everything up.\r\nYour coat and hat are out on the fire-escape, and as soon as Celia’s\r\nready I’ll show you the way.”\r\n\r\nGordon thanked him. There was nothing else to do, but his countenance\r\ngrew blank. Was there, then, to be no escape? Must he actually take\r\nanother man’s bride with him in order to get away? And how was he to\r\nget away from her? Where was the real bridegroom and why did he not\r\nappear upon the scene? And yet what complications that might bring up.\r\nHe began to look wildly about for a chance to flee at once, for how\r\ncould he possibly run away with a bride on his hands? If only some one\r\nwere going with them to the station he could slip away with a clear\r\nconscience, leaving her in good hands, but to leave her alone, ill, and\r\ndistressed was out of the question. He had rid himself of a lonely dog\r\nand a suffering child, though it gave him anguish to do the deed, but\r\nleave this lovely woman for whom he at least appeared to have become\r\nresponsible, he could not, until he was sure she would come to no harm\r\nthrough him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let anything hinder you! Don’t let anything hinder you!”\r\n\r\nIt appeared that this refrain had not ceased for an instant since it\r\nbegan, but had chimed its changes through music, ceremony, prayer\r\nand reception without interruption. It acted like a goad upon his\r\nconscience now. He must do something that would set him free to go back\r\nto Washington. An inspiration came to him.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t you like to go to the station with us?” he asked the young\r\nman, “I am sure your sister would like to have you.”\r\n\r\nThe boy’s face lit up joyfully.\r\n\r\n“Oh, wouldn’t you mind? I’d like it awfully, and--if it’s all the same\r\nto you, I wish Mother could go too. It’s the first time Celia and she\r\nwere ever separated, and I know she hates it fiercely to have to say\r\ngood-by with the house full of folks this way. But she doesn’t expect\r\nit of course, and really it isn’t fair to you, when you haven’t seen\r\nCelia alone yet, and it’s your wedding trip----”\r\n\r\n“There will be plenty of time for us,” said the compulsory bridegroom\r\ngraciously, and felt as if he had perjured himself. It was not in his\r\nnature to enjoy a serious masquerade of this kind.\r\n\r\n“I shall be glad to have you both come,” he added earnestly. “I really\r\nwant you. Tell your mother.”\r\n\r\nThe boy grasped his hand impulsively:\r\n\r\n“I say,” said he, “you’re all right! I don’t mind confessing that I’ve\r\nhated the very thought of you for a whole three months, ever since\r\nCelia told us she had promised to marry you. You see, I never really\r\nknew you when I was a little chap, but I didn’t used to like you. I\r\ntook an awful scunner to you for some reason. I suppose kids often\r\ntake irrational dislikes like that. But ever since I’ve laid eyes on\r\nyou to-night, I’ve liked you all the way through. I like your eyes.\r\nIt isn’t a bit as I thought I remembered you. I used to think your\r\neyes had a sort of deceitful look. Awful to tell you, isn’t it? But I\r\nfelt as if I wanted to have it off my conscience, for I see now you’re\r\nnothing of the kind. You’ve got the honestest eyes I ever saw on a man,\r\nand I’d stake my last cent that you wouldn’t cheat a church mouse.\r\nYou’re true as steel, and I’m mighty glad you’re my brother-in-law. I\r\nknow you’ll be good to Celia.”\r\n\r\nThe slow color mounted under his disguise until it reached Gordon’s\r\nburnished brown hair. His eyes were honest eyes. They had always been\r\nso--until to-day. Into what a world of deceit he had entered! How he\r\nwould like to make a clean breast of it all to this nice, frank boy;\r\nbut he must not! for there was his trust! For an instant he was on the\r\npoint of trying to explain that he was not the true bridegroom, and\r\ngetting young Jefferson to help him to set matters right, but an influx\r\nof newly arrived guests broke in upon their privacy, and he could only\r\npress the boy’s hand and say in embarrassed tones:\r\n\r\n“Thank you! I shall try to be worthy of your good opinion hereafter!”\r\n\r\nIt was over at last, and the bride slipped from his side to prepare\r\nfor the journey. He looked hastily around, feeling that his very first\r\nopportunity had come for making an escape. If an open window had\r\npresented itself, he would have vaulted through, trusting to luck and\r\nhis heels to get away, but there was no window, and every door was\r\nblocked by staring, admiring, smirking people. He bethought himself of\r\nthe fire-escape where waited his hat and coat, and wondered if he could\r\nfind it.\r\n\r\nWith smiling apologies, he broke away from those around him, murmuring\r\nsomething about being needed, and worked his way firmly but steadily\r\ntoward the stairs and thence to the back halls. Coming at last upon an\r\nopen window, he slipped through, his heart beating wildly. He thought\r\nfor a second that he was there ahead of the others; but a dark form\r\nloomed ahead and he perceived some one coming up from outside. Another\r\nsecond, and he saw it was his newly acquired brother-in-law.\r\n\r\n“Say, this is great!” was his greeting. “How did you manage to find\r\nyour way up alone? I was just coming down after you. I wanted to leave\r\nyou there till the last minute so no one would suspect, but now you\r\nare here we can hustle off at once. I just took Mother and Celia down.\r\nIt was pretty stiff for Mother to climb down, for she was a little\r\nbit afraid, but she was game all right, and she was so pleased to go.\r\nThey’re waiting for us down there in the court. Here, let me help you\r\nwith your overcoat. Now I’ll pull down this window, so no one will\r\nsuspect us and follow. That’s all right now, come on! You go ahead.\r\nJust hold on to the railing and go slow. I’ll keep close to you. I know\r\nthe way in my sleep. I’ve played fire here many a year, and could climb\r\ndown in my sleep.”\r\n\r\nGordon found himself wishing that this delightful brother-in-law were\r\nreally his. There was evidently to be no opportunity of escape here. He\r\nmeditated making a dash and getting away in the dark when they should\r\nreach the foot of the stairs; much as he hated to leave that way, he\r\nfelt he must do so if there was any chance for him at all; but when\r\nthey reached the ground he saw that was hopeless. The car that was\r\nto take them to the station was drawn up close to the spot, and the\r\nchauffeur stood beside it.\r\n\r\n“Your mother says fer you to hurry, Mister Jefferson,” he called in a\r\nsepulchral tone. “They’re coming out around the block to watch. Get in\r\nas quick as you can.”\r\n\r\nThe burly chauffeur stood below Gordon, helped him to alight on his\r\nfeet from the fire-escape, and hustled him into the darkness of the\r\nconveyance.\r\n\r\nThey were very quiet until they had left the dark court and were\r\nspeeding away down the avenue. Then the bride’s mother laid two gentle\r\nhands upon Gordon’s, leaning across from her seat to do so, and said:\r\n\r\n“My son, I shall never forget this of you, never! It was dear of you to\r\ngive me this last few minutes with my darling!”\r\n\r\nGordon, deeply touched and much put to it for words, mumbled something\r\nabout being very glad to have her, and Jefferson relieved the situation\r\nby pouring forth a volume of information and questions, fortunately not\r\npausing long enough to have the latter answered. The bride sat with one\r\nhand clasped in her mother’s, and said not a word. Gordon was haunted\r\nby the thought of tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was little opportunity for thinking, but Gordon made a hasty\r\nplan. He decided to get his party all out to the train and then\r\nremember his suit-case, which he had left checked in the station.\r\nJefferson would probably insist upon going for it but he would insist\r\nmore strenuously that the brother and sister would want to have\r\nthis last minute together. Then he could get away in the crowd and\r\ndisappear, coming later for his suit-case perhaps, or sending a porter\r\nfrom his own train for it. The only drawback to this arrangement was\r\nthat it seemed a dishonorable way to leave these people who would\r\nin the nature of things be left in a most trying position by his\r\ndisappearance, especially the sad little bride. But it could not be\r\nhelped, and his staying would only complicate things still further,\r\nfor he would have to explain who he was, and that was practically\r\nimpossible on account of his commission. It would not do to run risks\r\nwith himself until his mission was accomplished and his message\r\ndelivered. After that he could confess and make whatever reparation a\r\nman in his strange position could render.\r\n\r\nThe plan worked very well. The brother of course eagerly urged that he\r\nbe allowed to go back for the suit-case, but Gordon, with well-feigned\r\nthoughtfulness, said in a low tone:\r\n\r\n“Your sister will want you for a minute all to herself.”\r\n\r\nA tender look came into the boy’s eyes, and he turned back smiling\r\nto the stateroom where his mother and sister were having a wordless\r\nfarewell. Gordon jumped from the train and sprinted down the platform,\r\nfeeling meaner than he ever remembered to have felt in his whole\r\nlife, and with a strange heaviness about his heart. He forgot for the\r\nmoment that there was need for him to be on his guard against possible\r\ndetectives sent by Mr. Holman. Even the importance of the message\r\nhe carried seemed to weigh less, now that he was free. His feet had\r\na strange unwillingness to hurry, and without a constant pressure of\r\nthe will would have lagged in spite of him. His heart wanted to let\r\nsuit-case and commission and everything else go to the winds and take\r\nhim back to the stateroom where he had left his sorrowful bride of\r\nan hour. She was not his, and he might not go, but he knew that he\r\nwould never be the same hereafter. He would always be wondering where\r\nshe was, wishing he could have saved her from whatever troubled her;\r\nwishing she were his bride, and not another’s.\r\n\r\nHe passed back through the station gate, and a man in evening clothes\r\neyed him sharply. He fancied he saw a resemblance to one of the men\r\nat the Holman dinner-table, but he dared not look again lest a glance\r\nshould cost him recognition. He wondered blindly which way he should\r\ntake, and if it would be safe to risk going at once to the checking\r\nwindow, or whether he ought to go in hiding until he was sure young\r\nJefferson would no longer look for him. Then a hand touched his\r\nshoulder and a voice that was strangely welcome shouted:\r\n\r\n“This way, George! The checking place is over to the right!”\r\n\r\nHe turned and there stood Jefferson, smiling and panting:\r\n\r\n“You see, the little mother had something to say to Celia alone, so I\r\nsaw I was _de trop_, and thought I better come with you,” he declared\r\nas soon as he could get his breath.\r\n\r\n“Gee, but you can run!” added the panting youth. “What’s the hurry?\r\nIt’s ten whole minutes before the train leaves. I couldn’t waste all\r\nthat time kicking my heels on the platform, when I might be enjoying\r\nmy new brother-in-law’s company. I say, are you really going to live\r\npermanently in Chicago? I do wish you’d decide to come back to New\r\nYork. Mother’ll miss Celia no end. I don’t know how she’s going to\r\nstand it.”\r\n\r\nWalking airily by Gordon’s side, he talked, apparently not noticing the\r\nsudden start and look of mingled anxiety and relief that overspread\r\nhis brother-in-law’s countenance. Then another man walked by them\r\nand turning looked in their faces. Gordon was sure this was the\r\nthick-set man from Holman’s. He was eying Gordon keenly. Suddenly all\r\nother questions stepped into the background, and the only immediate\r\nmatter that concerned him was his message, to get it safely to its\r\ndestination. With real relief he saw that this had been his greatest\r\nconcern all the time, underneath all hindrances, and that there had\r\nnot been at any moment any escape from the crowding circumstances other\r\nthan that he had taken, step by step. If he had been beset by thieves\r\nand blackguards, and thrown into prison for a time he would not have\r\nfelt shame at the delay, for those things he could not help. He saw\r\nwith new illumination that there was no more shame to him from these\r\ntrivial and peculiar circumstances with which he had been hemmed in\r\nsince his start to New York than if he had been checked by any more\r\ntragic obstacles. His only real misgiving was about his marriage.\r\nSomehow it seemed his fault, and he felt there ought to be some way\r\nto confess his part at once--but how--without putting his message in\r\njeopardy--for no one would believe unless they knew all.\r\n\r\nBut the time of danger was at hand, he plainly saw. The man whom he\r\ndared not look closely at had turned again and was walking parallel to\r\nthem, glancing now and again keenly in their direction. He was watching\r\nGordon furtively; not a motion escaped him.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s delay at the checking counter while the attendant\r\nsearched for the suit-case, and Gordon was convinced that the man had\r\nstopped a few steps away merely for the purpose of watching him.\r\n\r\nHe dared not look around or notice the man, but he was sure he followed\r\nthem back to the train. He felt his presence as clearly as if he had\r\nbeen able to see through the back of his head.\r\n\r\nBut Gordon was cool and collected now. It was as if the experiences\r\nof the last two hours, with their embarrassing predicaments, had been\r\nwiped off the calendar, and he were back at the moment when he left\r\nthe Holman house. He knew as well as if he had watched them follow him\r\nthat they had discovered his--theft--treachery--whatever it ought to be\r\ncalled--and he was being searched for; and because of what was at stake\r\nthose men would track him to death if they could. But he knew also\r\nthat his disguise and his companion were for the moment puzzling this\r\nsleuth-hound.\r\n\r\nThis was probably not the only watcher about the station. There were\r\ndetectives, too, perhaps, hired hastily, and all too ready to seize a\r\nsuspect.\r\n\r\nHe marvelled that he could walk so deliberately, swinging his suit-case\r\nin his gloved hand at so momentous a time. He smiled and talked easily\r\nwith the pleasant fellow who walked by his side, and answered his\r\nquestions with very little idea of what he was saying; making promises\r\nwhich his heart would like to keep, but which he now saw no way of\r\nmaking good.\r\n\r\nThus they entered the train and came to the car where the bride and her\r\nmother waited. There were tears on the face of the girl, and she turned\r\nto the window to hide them. Gordon’s eyes followed her wistfully, and\r\ndown through the double glass, unnoticed by her absent gaze, he saw the\r\nface of the man who had followed them, sharply watching him.\r\n\r\nRealizing that his hat was a partial disguise, he kept it on in spite\r\nof the presence of the ladies. The color rose in his cheeks that he had\r\nto seem so discourteous, but, to cover his embarrassment, he insisted\r\nthat he be allowed to take the elder lady to the platform, as it really\r\nwas almost time for the train to start, and so he went deliberately out\r\nto act the part of bridegroom in the face of his recognized foe.\r\n\r\nThe mother and Gordon stood for a moment on the vestibule platform,\r\nwhile Jefferson bade his sister good-by and tried to soothe her\r\ndistress at parting from her mother.\r\n\r\n“He’s all right, Celie, indeed he is,” said the young fellow\r\ncaressingly, laying his hand upon his sister’s bowed head. “He’s going\r\nto be awfully good to you; he cares a lot for you, and he’s promised\r\nto do all sorts of nice things. He says he’ll bring you back soon, and\r\nhe would never stand in the way of your being with us a lot. He did\r\nindeed! What do you think of that? Isn’t it quite different from what\r\nyou thought he would say? He doesn’t seem to think he’s got to spend\r\nthe rest of his days in Chicago either. He says there might something\r\nturn up that would make it possible for him to change all his plans.\r\nIsn’t that great?”\r\n\r\nCelia tried to look up and smile through her tears, while the man\r\noutside studied the situation a moment in perplexity and then strolled\r\nslowly back to watch Gordon and the elder woman.\r\n\r\n“You will be good to my little girl,” he heard the woman’s voice\r\npleading. “She has always been guarded, and she will miss us all, even\r\nthough she has you.” The voice went through Gordon like a knife. To\r\nstand much more of this and not denounce himself for a blackguard would\r\nbe impossible. Neither could he keep his hat on in the presence of this\r\nwonderful motherhood, a motherhood that appealed to him all the more\r\nthat he had never known a mother of his own, and had always longed for\r\none.\r\n\r\nHe put up his hand and lifted his hat slightly, guarding as much as\r\npossible his own face from the view of the man on the station platform,\r\nwho was still walking deliberately, considerately, up and down, often\r\npassing near enough to hear what they were saying. In this reverent\r\nattitude, Gordon said, as though he were uttering a sacred vow:\r\n\r\n“I will guard her as if she were--as if I were--as if I\r\nwere--_you_”--then he paused a moment and added solemnly,\r\ntenderly--“Mother!”\r\n\r\nHe wondered if it were not desecration to utter such words when all\r\nthe time he was utterly unable to perform them in the way in which the\r\nmother meant. “Impostor!” was the word which rang in his ears now. The\r\nclamor about being hindered had ceased, for he was doing his best, and\r\nnot letting even a woman’s happiness stand in the way of his duty.\r\n\r\nYet his heart had dictated the words he had spoken, while his mind and\r\njudgment were busy with his perilous position. He could not gainsay his\r\nheart, for he felt that in every way he could he would guard and care\r\nfor the girl who was to be in his keeping at least for a few minutes\r\nuntil he could contrive some way to get her back to her friends without\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe whistle of the train was sounding now, and the brakemen were\r\nshouting, “All aboard!”\r\n\r\nHe helped the frail little elderly woman down the steps, and she\r\nreached up her face to kiss him. He bent and took the caress, the first\r\ntime that a woman’s lips had touched his face since he was a little\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n“Mother, I will not let anything harm her,” he whispered, and she said:\r\n\r\n“My boy, I can trust you!”\r\n\r\nThen he put her into the care of her strong young son, swung upon the\r\ntrain as the wheels began to move, and hurried back to the bride. On\r\nthe platform, walking beside the train, he still saw the man. Going to\r\nthe weeping girl, Gordon stooped over her gently, touched her on the\r\nshoulder, and drew the window shade down. The last face he saw outside\r\nwas the face of the baffled man, who was turning back, but what for?\r\nWas he going to report to others, and would there perhaps be another\r\nstop before they left the city, where officers or detectives might\r\nboard the train? He ought to be ready to get off and run for his life\r\nif there was. There seemed no way but to fee the porter to look after\r\nhis companion, and leave her, despicable as it seemed! Yet his soul of\r\nhonor told him he could never do that, no matter what was at stake.\r\n\r\nThen, without warning a new situation was thrust upon him. The bride,\r\nwho had been standing with bowed head and with her handkerchief up to\r\nher eyes, just as her brother had left her, tottered and fell into\r\nhis arms, limp and white. Instantly all his senses were called into\r\naction, and he forgot the man on the platform, forgot the possible\r\nnext stop in the city, and the explanation he had been about to make\r\nto the girl; forgot even the importance of his mission, and the\r\nfact that the train he was on was headed toward Chicago, instead of\r\nWashington; forgot everything but the fact that the loveliest girl he\r\nhad ever seen, with the saddest look a human face might wear, was lying\r\napparently lifeless in his arms.\r\n\r\nOutside the window the man had turned back and was now running\r\nexcitedly along with the train trying to see into the window; and\r\ndown the platform, not ten yards behind, came a frantic man with\r\nEnglish-looking clothes, a heavy mustache and goatee, shaggy eyebrows,\r\nand a sensual face, striding angrily along as fast as his heavy body\r\nwould carry him.\r\n\r\nBut Gordon saw none of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nFive hours before, the man who was hurling himself furiously after the\r\nrapidly retreating train had driven calmly through the city, from the\r\npier of the White Star Line to the apartment of a man whom he had met\r\nabroad, and who had offered him the use of it during his absence. The\r\nrooms were in the fourth story of a fine apartment house. The returning\r\nexile noted with satisfaction the irreproachable neighborhood, as he\r\nslowly descended from the carriage, paid his fee, and entered the door,\r\nto present his letter of introduction to the janitor in charge.\r\n\r\nHis first act was to open the steamer trunk which he had brought with\r\nhim in the cab, and take therefrom his wedding garments. These he\r\ncarefully arranged on folding hangers and hung in the closet, which was\r\notherwise empty save for a few boxes piled on the high shelf.\r\n\r\nThen he hastened to the telephone and communicated with his best man,\r\nJefferson Hathaway; told him the boat was late arriving at the dock,\r\nbut that he was here at last; gave him a few directions concerning\r\nerrands he would like to have done, and agreed to be at the church a\r\nhalf-hour earlier than the time set for the ceremony, to be shown just\r\nwhat arrangements had been made. He was told that his bride was feeling\r\nvery tired and was resting, and agreed that it would be as well not\r\nto disturb her; they would have time enough to talk afterwards; there\r\nreally wasn’t anything to say but what he had already written. And he\r\nwould have about all he could do to get there on time as it was. He\r\nasked if Jefferson had called for the ring he had ordered and if the\r\ncarriage would be sent for him in time and then without formalities\r\nclosed the interview. He and Jefferson were not exactly fond of one\r\nanother, though Jefferson was the beloved brother of his bride-to-be.\r\n\r\nHe hung up the receiver and rang for a brandy and soda to brace himself\r\nfor the coming ordeal which was to bind to him a woman whom for years\r\nhe had been trying to get in his power and whom he might have loved if\r\nshe had not dared to scorn him for the evil that she knew was in him.\r\nAt last he had found a way to subdue her and bring her with her ample\r\nfortune to his feet and he felt the exultation of the conqueror as he\r\nwent about his preparations for the evening.\r\n\r\nHe made a smug and leisurely toilet, with a smile of satisfaction upon\r\nhis flabby face. He was naturally a selfish person and had always known\r\nhow to make other people attend to all bothersome details for him\r\nwhile he enjoyed himself. He was quite comfortable and self-complacent\r\nas he posed a moment before the mirror to smooth his mustache and note\r\nhow well he was looking. Then he went to the closet for his coat.\r\n\r\nIt was most peculiar, the way it happened, but somehow, as he stepped\r\ninto that closet to take down his coat, which hung at the back where\r\nthe space was widest, the opening at the wrist of his shirt-sleeve\r\ncaught for just an instant in the little knob of the closet latch. The\r\ngold button which held the cuff to the wristband slipped its hold,\r\nand the man was free almost at once, but the angry twitch he had\r\nmade at the slight detention had given the door an impetus which set\r\nit silently moving on its hinges. (It was characteristic of George\r\nHayne that he was always impatient of the slightest detention.) He\r\nhad scarcely put his hand upon his wedding coat when a soft steel\r\nclick, followed by utter darkness, warned him that his impatience had\r\nentrapped him. He put out his hand and pushed at the door, but the\r\ncatch had settled into place. It was a very strong, neat little catch,\r\nand it did its work well. The man was a prisoner.\r\n\r\nAt first he was only annoyed, and gave the door an angry kick or two,\r\nas if of course it would presently release him meekly; but then he\r\nbethought him of his polished wedding shoes, and desisted. He tried to\r\nfind a knob and shake the door, but the only knob was the tiny brass\r\none on the outside of the catch, and you cannot shake a plain surface\r\nreared up before you. Then he set his massive, flabby shoulder against\r\nthe door and pressed with all his might, till his bulky linen shirt\r\nfront creaked with dismay, and his wedding collar wilted limply. But\r\nthe door stood like adamant. It was massive, like the man, but it was\r\nnot flabby. The wood of which it was composed had spent its early life\r\nin the open air, drinking only the wine of sunshine and sparkling air,\r\nwet with the dews of heaven, and exercising against the north blast. It\r\nwas nothing for it to hold out against this pillow of a man, who had\r\nbeen nurtured in the dissipation and folly of a great city. The door\r\nheld its own, and if doors do such things, the face of it must have\r\nlaughed to the silent room; and who knows but the room winked back? It\r\nwould be but natural that a room should resent a new occupant in the\r\nabsence of a beloved owner.\r\n\r\nHe was there, safe and fast, in the still dark, with plenty of time\r\nfor reflection. And there were things in his life that called for his\r\nreflection. They had never had him at an advantage before.\r\n\r\nIn due course of time, having exhausted his breath and strength in\r\nfruitless pushing, and his vocabulary in foolish curses, he lifted up\r\nhis voice and roared. No other word would quite describe the sound that\r\nissued from his mighty throat. But the city roared placidly below him,\r\nand no one minded him in the least.\r\n\r\nHe sacrificed the shiny toes of the shoes and added resounding kicks\r\non the door to the general hubbub. He changed the roar to a bellow\r\nlike a mad bull, but still the silence that succeeded it was as deep\r\nand monotonous as ever. He tried going to the back of the closet and\r\nhurling himself against the door, but he only hurt his soft muscles\r\nwith the effort. Finally he sat down on the floor of the closet.\r\n\r\nNow, the janitor’s wife, who occupied an apartment somewhat\r\novercrowded, had surreptitiously borrowed the use of this closet the\r\nweek before, in order to hang therein her Sunday gown, whose front\r\nbreadth was covered with grease-spots, thickly overlaid with French\r\nchalk. The French chalk had done its work and removed the grease-spots,\r\nand now lay thickly on the floor of the closet, but the imprisoned\r\nbridegroom did not know that, and he sat down quite naturally to rest\r\nfrom his unusual exertions, and to reflect on what could be done next.\r\n\r\nThe immediate present passed rapidly in review. He could not afford\r\nmore than ten minutes to get out of this hole. He ought to be on the\r\nway to the church at once. There was no knowing what nonsense Celia\r\nmight get into her head if he delayed. He had known her since her\r\nchildhood, and she had always scorned him. The hold he had upon her now\r\nwas like a rope of sand, but only he knew that. If he could but knock\r\nthat old door down! If he only hadn’t hung up his coat in the closet!\r\nIf the man who built the house only hadn’t put such a fool catch on the\r\ndoor! When he got out he would take time to chop it off! If only he had\r\na little more room, and a little more air! It was stifling! Great beads\r\nof perspiration went rolling down his hot forehead, and his wet collar\r\nmade a cool band about his neck. He wondered if he had another clean\r\ncollar of that particular style with him. If he _only_ could get out of\r\nthis accursed place! Where were all the people? Why was everything so\r\nstill? Would they never come and let him out?\r\n\r\nHe reflected that he had told the janitor he would occupy the room with\r\nhis baggage for two or three weeks perhaps, but he expected to go away\r\non a trip this very evening. The janitor would not think it strange\r\nif he did not appear. How would it be to stay here and die? Horrible\r\nthought!\r\n\r\nHe jumped up from the floor and began his howlings and gyrations once\r\nmore, but soon desisted, and sat down to be entertained by a panorama\r\nof his past life which is always unpleasantly in evidence at such\r\ntimes. Fine and clear in the darkness of the closet stood out the\r\nnicely laid scheme of deviltry by which he had contrived to be at last\r\nwithin reach of a coveted fortune.\r\n\r\nOccasionally would come the frantic thought that just through this\r\nlittle mishap of a foolish clothespress catch he might even yet lose\r\nit. The fraud and trickery by which he had an heiress in his power\r\ndid not trouble him so much as the thought of losing her--at least of\r\nlosing the fortune. He must have that fortune, for he was deep in debt,\r\nand--but then he would refuse to think, and get up to batter at his\r\nprison door again.\r\n\r\nFour hours his prison walls enclosed him, with inky blackness all\r\naround save for a faint glimmer of light, which marked the well-fitted\r\nbase of the door as the night outside drew on. He had lighted the gas\r\nwhen he began dressing, for the room had already been filled with\r\nshadows, and now, it began to seem as if that streak of flickering gas\r\nlight was the only thing that saved him from losing his mind.\r\n\r\nSomewhere from out of the dim shadows a face evolved itself and gazed\r\nat him, a haggard face with piercing hollow eyes and despair written\r\nupon it. It reproached him with a sin he thought long-forgotten. He\r\nshrank back in horror and the cold perspiration stood out upon his\r\nforehead, for the eyes were the eyes of the man whose name he had\r\nforged upon a note involving trust money fifteen years before; and the\r\nman, a quiet, kindly, unsuspecting creature had suffered the penalty in\r\na prison cell until his death some five years ago.\r\n\r\nSometimes at night in the first years after his crime, that face had\r\nhaunted him, appearing at odd intervals when he was plotting some\r\nparticularly shady means of adding to his income, until he had resolved\r\nto turn over a new leaf, and actually gave up one or two schemes as\r\nbeing too unscrupulous to be indulged in, thus acquiring a comforting\r\nfeeling of being virtuous. But it was long since the face had come.\r\nHe had settled it in his mind that the forgery was merely a patch of\r\nwild oats which he had sown in his youth, something to be regretted but\r\nnot too severely blamed for, and thus forgiving himself he had grown\r\nto feel that it was more the world’s fault for not giving him what\r\nhe wanted than his own for putting a harmless old man in prison. Of\r\nthe shame that had killed the old man he knew nothing, nor could have\r\nunderstood. The actual punishment itself was all that appealed to him.\r\nHe was ever one that had to be taught with the lash, and then only\r\nkept straight while it was in sight.\r\n\r\nBut the face was very near and vivid here in the thick darkness. It\r\nwas like a cell, this closet, bare, cold, black. The eyes in the gloom\r\nseemed to pierce him with the thought: “This is what you made me\r\nsuffer. It is your turn now. IT IS YOUR TURN NOW!” Nearer and nearer\r\nthey came looking into his own, until they saw down into his very soul,\r\nhis little sinful soul, and drew back appalled at the littleness and\r\nmeanness of what they saw.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time in his whole selfish life George Hayne knew any\r\nshame, for the eyes read forth to him all that they had seen, and how\r\nit looked to them; and beside the tale they told the eyes were clean of\r\nsin and almost glad in spite of suffering wrongfully.\r\n\r\nCloser and thicker grew the air of the small closet; fiercer grew the\r\nrage and shame and horror of the man incarcerated.\r\n\r\nNow, from out the shadows there looked other eyes, eyes that had never\r\nhaunted him before; eyes of victims to whom he had never cast a half a\r\nthought. Eyes of men and women he had robbed by his artful, gentlemanly\r\ncraft; eyes of innocent girls whose wrecked lives had contributed to\r\nhis selfish scheme of living; even the great reproachful eyes of\r\nlittle children who had looked to him for pity and found none. Last,\r\nabove them all were the eyes of the lovely girl he was to have married.\r\n\r\nHe had always loved Celia Hathaway more than he could have loved anyone\r\nor anything else besides himself, and it had eaten into his very being\r\nthat he never could make her bow to him; not even by torture could he\r\nbring her to her knees. Stung by the years of her scorn he had stooped\r\nlower and lower in his methods of dealing with her until he had come\r\nat last to employ the tools of slow torture to her soul that he might\r\nbring low her pride and put her fortune and her scornful self within\r\nhis power. The strength with which she had withheld him until the\r\ntime of her surrender had turned his selfish love into a hate with\r\ncontemplations of revenge.\r\n\r\nBut now her eyes glowed scornfully, wreathed round with bridal white,\r\nand seemed to taunt him with his foolish defeat at this the last minute\r\nbefore the final triumph.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the brandy he had taken had gone to his head. Was he going\r\nmad that he could not get away from all these terrible eyes?\r\n\r\nHe felt sure he was dying when at last the janitor came up to the\r\nfourth floor on his round of inspection, noticed the light flaring\r\nfrom the transom over the door occupied by the stranger who had said\r\nhe was going to leave on a trip almost immediately, and went in to\r\ninvestigate. The eyes vanished at his step. The man in the closet lost\r\nno time in making his presence known, and the janitor, cautiously,\r\nand with great deliberation made careful investigation of the cause\r\nand reason for this disturbance and finally let him out, after having\r\nreceived promise of reward which never materialized.\r\n\r\nThe stranger flew to the telephone in frantic haste, called up the\r\nhouse of his affianced bride, shouting wildly at the operator for all\r\nundue delays, and when finally he succeeded in getting some one to the\r\n’phone it was only to be told that neither Mrs. Hathaway nor her son\r\nwere there. Were they at the church? “Oh, no,” the servant answered,\r\n“they came back from the church long ago. There is a wedding in the\r\nhouse, and a great many people. They are making so much noise I can’t\r\nhear. Speak louder please!”\r\n\r\nHe shouted and raved at the servant, asking futile questions and\r\ndemanding information, but the louder he raved the less the servant\r\nunderstood and finally he hung up the receiver and dashed about the\r\nroom like an insane creature, tearing off his wilted collar, grabbing\r\nat another, jerking on his fine coat, searching vainly for his cuffs,\r\nsnatching his hat and overcoat, and making off down the stairs;\r\nbreathlessly, regardless of the demand of the janitor for the fee of\r\nfreedom he had been promised.\r\n\r\nOut in the street he rushed hither and thither blindly in search of\r\nsome conveyance, found a taxicab at last, and, plunging in, ordered it\r\nto go at once to the Hathaway address.\r\n\r\nArrived there, he presented an enlivening spectacle to the guests, who\r\nwere still making merry. His trousers were covered with French chalk,\r\nhis collar had slipped from its confining button in front and curved\r\ngracefully about one fat cheek, his high hat was a crush indeed, having\r\nbeen rammed down to his head in his excitement. He talked so fast and\r\nso loud that they thought he was crazy and tried to put him out, but he\r\nshook his fist angrily in the face of the footman and demanded to know\r\nwhere Miss Hathaway was? When they told him she was married and gone,\r\nhe turned livid with wrath and told them that that was impossible, as\r\nhe was the bridegroom.\r\n\r\nBy this time the guests had gathered in curious groups in the hall and\r\non the stairs, listening, and when he claimed to be the bridegroom they\r\nshouted with laughter, thinking this must be some practical joke or\r\nelse that the man was insane. But one older gentleman, a friend of the\r\nfamily, stepped up to the excited visitor and said in a quieting voice:\r\n\r\n“My friend, you have made a mistake! Miss Hathaway has this evening\r\nbeen married to Mr. George Hayne, just arrived from abroad, and they\r\nare at this moment on their way to take the train. You have come too\r\nlate to see her, or else you have the wrong address, and are speaking\r\nof some other Miss Hathaway. That is very likely the explanation.”\r\n\r\nGeorge looked around on the company with helpless rage, then rushed to\r\nhis taxicab and gave the order for the station.\r\n\r\nArriving at the station, he saw it was within half a minute of the\r\ndeparture of the Chicago train, and none knew better than he what time\r\nthat train had been going to depart. Had he not given minute directions\r\nregarding the arrangements to his future brother-in-law? What did it\r\nall mean anyway? Had Celia managed somehow to carry out the wedding\r\nwithout him to hide her mortification at his non-appearance? Or had she\r\nrun away? He was too excited to use his reason. He could merely urge\r\nhis heavy bulk onward toward the fast fleeting train; and dashed up\r\nthe platform, overcoat streaming from his arm, coat-tails flying, hat\r\ncrushed down upon his head, his fat, bechalked legs rumbling heavily\r\nafter him. He passed Jefferson and his mother; watching tearfully,\r\nlingeringly, the retreating train. Jefferson laughed at the funny\r\nspectacle, but the mother did not notice and only said absently: “I\r\nthink he’ll be good to her, don’t you, Jeff? He has nice eyes. I don’t\r\nremember that his eyes used to seem so pleasant, and so--deferential.”\r\nThen they turned to go back to their car, and the train moved faster\r\nand faster out of the station. It would presently rush away out into\r\nthe night, leaving the two pursuers to face each other, baffled.\r\n\r\nBoth realized this at the same instant and the short, thick-set man\r\nwith sudden decision turned again and plunging along with the train\r\ncaught at the rail and swung himself with dangerous precipitation to\r\nthe last platform of the last car with a half-frightened triumph.\r\nLooking back he saw the other man with a frantic effort sprint forward,\r\ntrying to do the same thing, and failing in the attempt, sprawl flat on\r\nthe platform, to the intense amusement of a couple of trainmen standing\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nGeorge Hayne, having thus come to a full stop in his headlong career,\r\nlay prostrate for a moment, stunned and shaken; then gathered himself\r\nup slowly and stood gazing after the departing train. After all, if he\r\nhad caught it what could he have done? It was incredible that Celia\r\ncould have got herself married and gone on her wedding trip without\r\nhim. If she had eloped with some one else and they were on that train\r\nwhat could he have done? Kill the bridegroom and force the bride to\r\nreturn with him and be married over again? Yes, but that might have\r\nbeen a trifle awkward after all, and he had enough awkward situations\r\nto his account already. Besides, it wasn’t in the least likely that\r\nCelia was married yet. Those people at the house had been fooled\r\nsomehow, and she had run away. Perhaps her mother and brother were gone\r\nwith her. The same threats that had made her bend to him once should\r\nfollow her wherever she had gone. She would marry him yet and pay for\r\nthis folly a hundred fold. He lifted a shaking hand of execration\r\ntoward the train which by this time was vanishing into the dark opening\r\nat the end of the station, where signal lights like red berries\r\nfestooned themselves in an arch against the blackness, and the lights\r\nof the last car paled and vanished like a forgotten dream.\r\n\r\nThen he turned and hobbled slowly back to the gates regardless of the\r\nmerriment he was arousing in the genial trainmen; for he was spent\r\nand bruised, and his appearance was anything but dignified. No member\r\nof the wedding company had they seen him at this juncture would have\r\nrecognized in him any resemblance to the handsome gentleman who had\r\nplayed his part in the wedding ceremony. No one would have thought it\r\npossible that he could be Celia Hathaway’s bridegroom.\r\n\r\nSlowly back to the gate he crept, haggard, dishevelled, crestfallen;\r\nhis hair in its several isolated locks downfallen over his forehead,\r\nhis collar wilted, his clothes smeared with chalk and dust, his\r\novercoat dragging forlornly behind him. He was trying to decide what\r\nto do next, and realizing the torment of a perpetual thirst, when a\r\nhand was laid suddenly upon him and a voice that somehow had a familiar\r\ntwang, said: “You will come with me, sir.”\r\n\r\nHe looked up and there before him in the flesh were the eyes of the man\r\nwho had haunted him for years, the very eyes grown younger, and filled\r\nwith more than reproach. They were piercing him with the keenness of\r\nretribution. They said, as plainly as those eyes in the closet had\r\nspoken but a brief hour before: “Your time is over. My time has come.\r\nYou have sinned. You shall suffer. Come now and meet your reward.”\r\n\r\nHe started back in horror. His hands trembled and his brain reeled. He\r\nwished for another cocktail to help him to meet this most extraordinary\r\nemergency. Surely, something had happened to his nerves that he was\r\nseeing these eyes in reality, and hearing the voice, that old man’s\r\nvoice made young, bidding him come with him. It could not be, of\r\ncourse. He was unnerved with all he had been through. The man had\r\nmistaken him for some one--or perhaps it was not a man after all. He\r\nglanced quickly around to see if others saw him, and at once became\r\naware that a crowd was collecting about them.\r\n\r\nThe man with the strange eyes and the familiar voice was dressed in\r\nplain clothes, but he seemed to have full assurance that he was a real\r\nlive man and had a right to dictate. George Hayne could not shake away\r\nhis grasp. There was a determination about it that struck terror to his\r\nsoul, and he had a weak desire to scream and hide his eyes. Could he be\r\ncoming down with delirium tremens? That brandy must have been unusually\r\nstrong to have lasted so long in its effects. Then he made a weak\r\neffort to speak, but his voice sounded small and frightened. The eyes\r\ntook his assurance from him.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he asked, and meant to add, “What right have _you_\r\nto dictate to _me_?” but the words died away in his throat, for the\r\nplainclothes man had opened his coat and disclosed a badge that shone\r\nwith a sinister light straight into his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I am Norman Brand,” answered the voice, “and I want you for what you\r\ndid to my father. It is time you paid your debt. You were the cause\r\nof his humiliation and death. I have been watching for you for years.\r\nI saw the notice of your wedding in the paper and was tracking you. It\r\nwas for this I entered the service. Come with me.”\r\n\r\nWith a cry of horror George Hayne wrenched away from his captor and\r\nturned to flee, but instantly three revolvers were levelled at him, and\r\nhe found that two policemen in brass buttons were stationed behind him,\r\nand the crowd closed in about him. Wherever he turned it was to look\r\ninto the barrel of a gun, and there was no escape in any direction.\r\n\r\nThey led him away to the patrol wagon, the erstwhile bridegroom, and\r\nin place of the immaculate linen he had searched so frantically for in\r\nhis apartment they put upon his wrists cuffs of iron. They put him in a\r\ncell and left him with eyes of the old man for company and the haunting\r\nlikeness of his son’s voice filling him with frenzy. The unquenchable\r\nthirst came upon him and he begged for brandy and soda, but none came\r\nto slake his thirst, for he had crossed the great gulf and justice at\r\nlast had him in her grasp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime the man on the steps of the last car of the Chicago Limited\r\nwas having his doubts about whether he ought to have boarded that\r\ntrain. He realized that the fat traveller who was hurling himself after\r\nthe train had stirred in him a sudden impulse which had been only half\r\nformed before and he had obeyed it. Perhaps he was following a wrong\r\nscent and would lose the reward which he knew was his if he brought the\r\nthief of the code-writing, dead or alive, to his employer. He was half\r\ninclined to jump off again now before it was too late; but looking down\r\nhe saw they were already speeding over a network of tracks, and trains\r\nwere flying by in every direction. By the time they were out of this\r\nthe speed would be too great for him to attempt a jump. It was even now\r\nrisky, and he was heavy for athletics. He must do it at once if he did\r\nit at all.\r\n\r\nHe looked ahead tentatively to see if the track on which he must jump\r\nwas clear, and the great eye of an engine stabbed him in the face, as\r\nit bore down upon him. The next instant it swept by, its hot breath\r\nfanning his cheek, and he drew back shuddering involuntarily. It was of\r\nno use. He could not jump here. Perhaps they would slow up or stop,\r\nand anyway, should he jump or stay on board?\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the upper step the better to get the situation in hand.\r\nPerhaps in a minute more the way would be clearer to jump off if he\r\ndecided not to go on. Thus he vacillated. It was rather unlike him not\r\nto know his own mind.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if there must be something here to follow, and yet,\r\nperhaps he was mistaken. He had been the first man of the company at\r\nthe front door after Mr. Holman turned the paper over, and they all had\r\nnoticed the absence of the red mark. It had been simultaneous with the\r\nclicking of the door-latch and he had covered the ground from his seat\r\nto the door sooner than anyone else. He could swear he had seen the\r\nman get into the cab that stood almost in front of the house. He had\r\nlost no time in getting into his own car which was detailed for such\r\nan emergency, and in signalling the officer on a motor-cycle who was\r\nalso ready for a quick call. The carriage had barely turned the corner\r\nwhen they followed, there was no other of the kind in sight either way\r\nbut that, and he had followed it closely. It must have been the right\r\ncarriage. And yet, when the man got out at the church he was changed,\r\nmuch changed in appearance, so that he had looked twice into the empty\r\ncarriage to make sure that the man for whom he searched was not still\r\nin there hiding. Then he had followed him into the church and seen him\r\nmarried; stood close at hand when he put his bride into a big car, and\r\nhe had followed the car to the house where the reception was held; even\r\nmingling with the guests and watching until the bridal couple left for\r\nthe train. He had stood in the alley in the shadow, the only one of the\r\nguests who had found how the bride was really going away, and again he\r\nhad followed to the station.\r\n\r\nHe had walked close enough to the bridegroom in the station to be\r\nalmost sure that mustache and those heavy eyebrows were false; and yet\r\nhe could not make it out. How could it be possible that a man who was\r\ngoing to be married in a great church full of fashionable people would\r\nso dare to flirt with chance as to accept an invitation to a dinner\r\nwhere he might not be able to get away for hours? What would have\r\nhappened if he had not got there in time? Was it in the least possible\r\nthat these two men could be identical? Everything but the likeness\r\nand the fact that he had followed the man so closely pointed out the\r\nimpossibility.\r\n\r\nThe thick-set man was accustomed to trust his inner impressions\r\nthoroughly, and in this case his inner impression was that he must\r\nwatch this peculiar bridegroom and be sure he was not the right man\r\nbefore he forever got away from him--and yet--and yet, he might be\r\nmissing the right man by doing it. However, he had come so far, had\r\nrisked a good deal already in following and in throwing himself on\r\nthat fast moving train. He would stay a little longer and find out\r\nfor sure. He would try and get a seat where he could watch him and in\r\nan hour he ought to be able to tell if he were really the man who had\r\nstolen the code-writing. If he could avoid the conductor for a time he\r\nwould simply profess to have taken the wrong train by mistake and maybe\r\ncould get put off somewhere near home, in case he discovered that he\r\nwas barking up the wrong tree. He would stick to the train for a little\r\nyet, inasmuch as there seemed no safe way of getting off at present.\r\n\r\nHaving decided so much, he gave one last glance toward the twinkling\r\nlights of the city hurrying past, and getting up sauntered into the\r\ntrain, keeping a weather eye out for the conductor. He meant to burn\r\nno bridges behind him. He was well provided with money for any kind of\r\na trip and mileage books and passes. He knew where to send a telegram\r\nthat would bring him instant assistance in case of need, and even now\r\nhe knew the officer on the motor-cycle had reported to his employer\r\nthat he had boarded this train. There was really no immediate need for\r\nhim to worry. It was big game he was after and one must take some risks\r\nin a case of that sort. Thus he entered the sleeper to make good the\r\nimpression of his inner senses.\r\n\r\nGordon had never held anything so precious, so sweet and beautiful and\r\nfrail-looking, in his arms. He had a feeling that he ought to lay her\r\ndown, yet there was a longing to draw her closer to himself and shield\r\nher from everything that could trouble her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut she was not his--only a precious trust to be guarded and cared\r\nfor as vigilantly as the message he carried hidden about his neck;\r\nshe belonged to another, somewhere, and was a sacred trust until\r\ncircumstances made it possible for him to return her to her rightful\r\nhusband. Just what all this might mean to himself, to the woman in\r\nhis arms, and to the man whom she was to have married, Gordon had not\r\nas yet had time to think. It was as if he had been watching a moving\r\npicture and suddenly a lot of circumstances had fallen in a heap\r\nand become all jumbled up together, the result of his own rash but\r\nunsuspecting steps, the way whole families have in moving pictures of\r\nfalling through a sky-scraper from floor to floor, carrying furniture\r\nand inhabitants with them as they descend.\r\n\r\nHe had not as yet been able to disentangle himself from the debris and\r\nfind out what had been his fault and what he ought to do about it.\r\n\r\nHe laid her gently on the couch of the drawing-room and opened the\r\nlittle door of the private dressing-room. There would be cold water in\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHe knew very little about caring for sick people--he had always been\r\nwell and strong himself--but cold water was what they used for people\r\nwho had fainted, he was sure. He would not call in anyone to help,\r\nunless it was absolutely necessary. He pulled the door of the stateroom\r\nshut, and went after the water. As he passed the mirror, he started at\r\nthe curious vision of himself. One false eyebrow had come loose and\r\nwas hanging over his eye, and his goatee was crooked. Had it been so\r\nall the time? He snatched the eyebrow off, and then the other; but the\r\nmustache and goatee were more tightly affixed, and it was very painful\r\nto remove them. He glanced back, and the white, limp look of the girl\r\non the couch frightened him. What was he about, to stop over his\r\nappearance when she might be dying, and as for pain--he tore the false\r\nhair roughly from him, and, stuffing it into his pocket, filled a glass\r\nwith water and went back to the couch. His chin and upper lip smarted,\r\nbut he did not notice it, nor know that the mark of the plaster was all\r\nabout his face. He only knew that she lay there apparently lifeless\r\nbefore him, and he must bring the soul back into those dear eyes. It\r\nwas strange, wonderful, how his feeling had grown for the girl whom he\r\nhad never seen till three hours before.\r\n\r\nHe held the glass to her white lips and tried to make her drink, then\r\npoured water on his handkerchief and awkwardly bathed her forehead.\r\nSome hairpins slipped loose and a great wealth of golden-brown hair\r\nfell across his knees as he half knelt beside her. One little hand\r\ndrooped over the side of the couch and touched his. He started! It\r\nseemed so soft and cold and lifeless.\r\n\r\nHe blamed himself that he had no remedies in his suit-case. Why had\r\nhe never thought to carry something,--a simple restorative? Other\r\npeople might need it though he did not. No man ought to travel without\r\nsomething for the saving of life in an emergency. He might have needed\r\nit himself even, in case of a railroad accident or something.\r\n\r\nHe slipped his arm tenderly under her head and tried to raise it so\r\nthat she could drink, but the white lips did not move nor attempt to\r\nswallow.\r\n\r\nThen a panic seized him. Suppose she was dying? Not until later, when\r\nhe had quiet and opportunity for thought, did it occur to him what a\r\nterrible responsibility he had dared to take upon himself in letting\r\nher people leave her with him; what a fearful position he would have\r\nbeen in if she had really died. At the moment his whole thought was\r\none of anguish at the idea of losing her; anxiety to save her precious\r\nlife; and not for himself.\r\n\r\nForgetting his own need of quiet and obscurity, he laid her gently back\r\nupon the couch again, and rushed from the stateroom out into the aisle\r\nof the sleeper. The conductor was just making his rounds and he hurried\r\nto him with a white face.\r\n\r\n“Is there a doctor on board, or have you any restoratives? There is a\r\nlady----” He hesitated and the color rolled freshly into his anxious\r\nface. “That is--my wife.” He spoke the word unwillingly, having at the\r\ninstant of speaking realized that he must say this to protect her good\r\nname. It seemed like uttering a falsehood, or stealing another man’s\r\nproperty; and yet, technically, it was true, and for her sake at least\r\nhe must acknowledge it.\r\n\r\n“My wife,” he began again more connectedly, “is ill--unconscious.”\r\n\r\nThe conductor looked at him sharply. He had sized them up as a wedding\r\nparty when they came down the platform toward the train. The young\r\nman’s blush confirmed his supposition.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see!” he said briefly. “Go back to her and I’ll bring some one.”\r\n\r\nIt was just as Gordon turned back that the thick-set man entered the\r\ncar from the other end and met him face to face, but Gordon was too\r\ndistraught at that moment to notice him, for his mind was at rest about\r\nhis pursuer as soon as the train started.\r\n\r\nNot so with the pursuer however. His keen little eyes took in the\r\nwhite, anxious face, the smear of sticking plaster about the mouth and\r\neyebrows, and instantly knew his man. His instincts had not failed him\r\nafter all.\r\n\r\nHe put out a pair of brawny fists to catch at him, but a lurch of the\r\ntrain and Gordon’s swift stride out-purposed him, and by the time the\r\nlittle man had righted his footing Gordon was disappearing into the\r\nstateroom, and the conductor with another man was in the aisle behind\r\nhim waiting to pass. He stepped back and watched. At least he had\r\ndriven his prey to quarry and there was no possible escape now until\r\nthe train stopped. He would watch that door as a cat watches a mouse,\r\nand perhaps be able to send a telegram for help before he made any move\r\nat all. It was as well that his impulse to take the man then and there\r\nhad come to naught. What would the other passengers have thought of\r\nhim? He must of course move cautiously. What a blunder he had almost\r\nmade. It was no part of his purpose to make public his errand. The\r\nmen who were behind him did not wish to be known, nor to have their\r\nbusiness known.\r\n\r\nWith narrowing eyes he watched the door of the stateroom as the\r\nconductor and doctor came and went. He gathered from a few questions\r\nasked by one of the passengers that there was some one sick, probably\r\nthe lady he had seen faint as the train started. It occurred to him\r\nthat this might be his opportunity, and when the conductor came out\r\nof the drawing-room the second time he inquired if any assistance was\r\nneeded, and implied that doctoring was his profession, though it would\r\nbe a sorry patient that had only his attention. However, if he had one\r\naccomplishment it was bluffing, and he never stopped at any profession\r\nthat suited his needs.\r\n\r\nThe conductor was annoyed at the interruptions that had already\r\noccurred and he answered him brusquely that they had all the help\r\nnecessary and there wasn’t anything the matter anyway.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left for the man to do but wait.\r\n\r\nHe subsided with his eye on the stateroom door, and later secured a\r\nberth in plain sight of that door, but gave no order to have it made\r\nup until every other passenger in the car was gone to what rest a\r\nsleeping-car provides. He kept his vigil well, but was rewarded with\r\nno sight of his prey that night, and at last with a sense of duty well\r\ndone and the comfortable promise from the conductor that his deftly\r\nworded telegraphic message to Mr. Holman should be sent from a station\r\nthey passed a little after midnight, he crept to his well-earned rest.\r\nHe was not at home in a dress shirt and collar, being of the walks of\r\nlife where a collar is mostly accounted superfluous, and he was glad\r\nto be relieved of it for a few hours. It had not yet occurred to him\r\nthat his appearance in that evening suit would be a trifle out of place\r\nwhen morning came. It is doubtful if he had ever considered matters of\r\ndress. His profession was that of a human ferret of the lower order,\r\nand there were many things he did not know. It might have been the way\r\nhe held his fork at dinner that had made Gordon decide that he was but\r\na henchman of the others.\r\n\r\nHaving put his mind and his body at rest he proceeded to sleep, and the\r\ntrain thundered on its way into the night.\r\n\r\nGordon meanwhile had hurried back from his appeal to the conductor, and\r\nstood looking helplessly down at the delicate girl as she lay there\r\nso white and seemingly lifeless. Her pretty travelling gown set off\r\nthe exquisite face finely; her glorious hair seemed to crown her. A\r\nhandsome hat had fallen unheeded to the floor, and lay rolling back\r\nand forth in the aisle with the motion of the train. He picked it up\r\nreverently, as though it had been a part of her. His face in the few\r\nminutes had gone haggard.\r\n\r\nThe conductor hurried in presently, followed by a grave elderly man\r\nwith a professional air. He touched a practised finger to the limp\r\nwrist, looked closely into the face, and then taking a little bottle\r\nfrom a case he carried called for a glass.\r\n\r\nThe liquid was poured between the closed lips, the white throat\r\nreluctantly swallowed it, the eyelids presently fluttered, a long\r\nbreath that was scarcely more than a sigh hovered between the lips, and\r\nthen the blue eyes opened.\r\n\r\nShe looked about, bewildered, looking longest at Gordon, then closed\r\nher eyes wearily, as if she wished they had not brought her back, and\r\nlay still.\r\n\r\nThe physician still knelt beside her, and Gordon, with time now to\r\nthink, began to reflect on the possible consequences of his deeds.\r\nWith anxious face, he stood watching, reflecting bitterly that he\r\nmight not claim even a look of recognition from those sweet eyes,\r\nand wishing with all his heart that his marriage had been genuine. A\r\npassing memory of his morning ride to New York in company with Miss\r\nBentley’s conjured vision brought wonder to his eyes. It all seemed\r\nso long ago, and so strange that he ever could have entertained for a\r\nmoment the thought of marrying Julia. She was a good girl of course,\r\nfine and handsome and all that,--but--and here his eyes sought the\r\nsweet sad face on the couch, and his heart suffered in a real agony for\r\nthe trouble he saw; and for the trouble he must yet give to her when he\r\ntold her who he was, or rather who he was not; for he must tell her and\r\nthat soon. It would not do to go on in her company--nor to Chicago! And\r\nyet, how was he possibly to leave her in this condition?\r\n\r\nBut no revelations were to be given that night.\r\n\r\nThe physician administered another draught, and ordered the porter to\r\nmake up the berth immediately. Then with skilful hands and strong arms\r\nhe laid the young girl in upon the pillows and made her comfortable,\r\nGordon meanwhile standing awkwardly by with averted eyes and troubled\r\nmien. He would have liked to help, but he did not know how.\r\n\r\n“She’d better not be disturbed any more than is necessary to-night,”\r\nsaid the doctor, as he pulled the pretty cloth travelling gown smoothly\r\ndown about the girl’s ankles and patted it with professional hands.\r\n“Don’t let her yield to any nonsense about putting up her hair, or\r\ntaking off that frock for fear she’ll rumple it. She needs to lie\r\nperfectly quiet. It’s a case of utter exhaustion, and I should say a\r\nlong strain of some kind--anxiety, worry perhaps.” He looked keenly at\r\nthe sheepish bridegroom. “Has she had any trouble?”\r\n\r\nGordon lifted honest eyes.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid so,” he answered contritely, as if it must have been his\r\nfault some way.\r\n\r\n“Well, don’t let her have any more,” said the elder man briskly. “She’s\r\na very fragile bit of womanhood, young man, and you’ll have to handle\r\nher carefully or she’ll blow away. Make her _happy_, young man! People\r\ncan’t have too much happiness in this world. It’s the best thing, after\r\nall, to keep them well. Don’t be afraid to give her plenty.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you!” said Gordon, fervently, wishing it were in his power to do\r\nwhat the physician ordered.\r\n\r\nThe kindly physician, the assiduous porter, and the brusque but\r\ngood-hearted conductor went away at last, and Gordon was left with his\r\nprecious charge, who to all appearances was sleeping quietly. The light\r\nwas turned low and the curtains of the berth were a little apart. He\r\ncould see the dim outline of drapery about her, and one shadowy hand\r\nlying limp at the edge of the couch, in weary relaxation.\r\n\r\nAbove her, in the upper berth, which he had told the porter not to make\r\nup, lay the great purple-black plumed hat, and a sheaf of lilies of the\r\nvalley from her bouquet. It seemed all so strange for him to be there\r\nin their sacred presence.\r\n\r\nHe locked the door, so that no one should disturb the sleeper, and went\r\nslowly into the little private dressing-room. For a full minute after\r\nhe reached it, he stood looking into the mirror before him, looking\r\nat his own weary, soiled face, and wondering if he, Cyril Gordon,\r\nheretofore honored and self-respecting, had really done in the last\r\ntwelve hours all the things which he was crediting himself with having\r\ndone! And the question was, how had it happened? Had he taken leave of\r\nhis senses, or had circumstances been too much for him? Had he lost\r\nthe power of judging between right and wrong? Could he have helped any\r\nof the things that had come upon him? How could he have helped them?\r\nWhat ought he to have done? What ought he to do now? Was he a criminal\r\nbeyond redemption? Had he spoiled the life of the sweet woman out there\r\nin her berth, or could he somehow make amends for what he had done? And\r\nwas he as badly to blame for it all as he felt himself to be?\r\n\r\nAfter a minute he rallied, to realize that his face was dirty. He\r\nwashed the marks of the adhesive plaster away, and then, not satisfied\r\nwith the result, he brought his shaving things from his suit-case\r\nand shaved. Somehow, he felt more like himself after his toilet was\r\ncompleted, and he slipped back into the darkened drawing-room and\r\nstretched himself wearily on the couch, which, according to his\r\ndirections, was not made up, but merely furnished with pillows and a\r\nblanket.\r\n\r\nThe night settled into the noisy quiet of an express train, and each\r\nrevolution of the wheels, as they whirled their way Chicagoward,\r\nresolved itself into the old refrain, “Don’t let anything hinder you!\r\nDon’t let anything hinder you!”\r\n\r\nHe certainly was not taking the most direct route from New York to\r\nWashington, though it might eventually prove that the longest way round\r\nwas the shortest way home, on account of its comparative safety.\r\n\r\nAs he settled to the quiet of his couch, a number of things came\r\nmore clearly to his vision. One was that they had safely passed the\r\noutskirts of New York without interference of any kind, and must\r\nby this time be speeding toward Albany, unless they were on a road\r\nthat took them more directly West. He had not thought to look at the\r\ntickets for knowledge of his bearings, and the light was too dim for\r\nhim to make out any monograms or letterings on inlaid wood panels or\r\ntransoms, even if he had known enough about New York railroads to gain\r\ninformation from them. There was one thing certain: even if he had been\r\nmistaken about his supposed pursuers, by morning there would surely be\r\nsome one searching for him. The duped Holman combination would stop\r\nat nothing when they discovered his theft of the paper, and he could\r\nnot hope that so sharp-eyed a man as Mr. Holman had seemed to be would\r\nbe long in discovering the absence of his private mark on the paper.\r\nUndoubtedly he knew it already. As for the frantic bridegroom, Gordon\r\ndreaded the thought of meeting him. It must be put off at any hazards\r\nuntil the message was safe with his chief, then, if he had to answer\r\nwith his life for carrying off another man’s bride, he could at least\r\nfeel that he left no duty to his government undone. It was plain that\r\nhis present situation was a dangerous one from two points of view,\r\nfor the bridegroom would have no difficulty in finding out what train\r\nhe and the lady had taken; and he was satisfied that an emissary of\r\nHolman had more than a suspicion of his identity. The obvious thing to\r\ndo was to get off that train at the first opportunity and get across\r\ncountry to another line of railroad. But how was that to be done with a\r\nsick lady on his hands? Of course he could leave her to herself. She\r\nprobably had taken journeys before, and would know how to get back. She\r\nwould at least be able to telegraph to her friends to come for her. He\r\ncould leave her money and a note explaining his involuntary villainy,\r\nand her indignation with him would probably be a sufficient stimulant\r\nto keep her from dying of chagrin at her plight. But as from the first\r\nevery nerve and fibre in him rejected this suggestion. It would be\r\ncowardly, unmanly, horrible! Undoubtedly it might be the wise thing to\r\ndo from many standpoints, but--_never_! He could no more leave her that\r\nway than he could run off to save his life and leave that message he\r\ncarried. She was a trust as much as that. He had got into this, and he\r\nmust get out somehow, but he would not desert the lady or neglect his\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nToward morning, when his fitful vigil became less lucid it occurred\r\nto him that he ought really to have deserted the bride while she was\r\nstill unconscious, jumping off the train at the short stop they made\r\nsoon after she fell into his arms. She would then have been cared for\r\nby some one, his absence discovered, and she would have been put off\r\nthe train and her friends sent for at once. But it would have been\r\ndastardly to have deserted her that way not knowing even if she still\r\nlived, he on whom she had at least a claim of temporary protection.\r\n\r\nIt was all a terrible muddle, right and wrong juggled in such a\r\nmysterious and unusual way. He never remembered to have come to a spot\r\nbefore where it was difficult to know which of two things it was right\r\nto do. There had always before been such clearly defined divisions. He\r\nhad supposed that people who professed not to know what was right were\r\npeople who wished to be blinded on the subject because they wished to\r\ndo wrong and think it right. But now he saw that he had judged such too\r\nharshly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps his brain had been overstrained with the excitement and\r\nannoyances of the day, and he was not quite in a condition to judge\r\nwhat was right. He ought to snatch a few minutes’ sleep, and then\r\nhis mind would be clearer, for something must be done and that soon.\r\nIt would not do to risk entering a large city where detectives and\r\nofficers with full particulars might even now be on the watch for\r\nhim. He was too familiar with the workings of retribution in this\r\nprogressive age not to know his danger. But he really must get some\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nAt last he yielded to the drowsiness that was stealing over him--just\r\nfor a moment, he thought, and the wheels hummed on their monotonous\r\nsong: “Don’t let anything hinder! Don’t let anything----! Don’t\r\nlet----! Don’t! Hin-der-r-r-r!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man slept, and the train rushed on. The night waned. The dawn grew\r\npurple in the east, and streaked itself with gold; then later got out\r\na fillet of crimson and drew over its cloudy forehead. The breath of\r\nthe lilies filled the little room with delicate fragrance, and mingled\r\nstrange scenes in the dreams of the man and the woman so strangely\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nThe sad little bride grew restless and stirred, but the man on the\r\ncouch did not hear her. He was dreaming of a shooting affray, in\r\nwhich he carried a bride in a gold pencil and was shot for stealing a\r\nsandwich out of Mr. Holman’s vest-pocket.\r\n\r\nThe morning light grew clearer. The east had put on a vesture of gold\r\nabove her purple robe, and its reflection shone softly in at the\r\nwindow, for the train was just at that moment rushing northward, though\r\nits general course was west.\r\n\r\nThe sleeper behind the thick green curtains stirred again and became\r\nconscious, as in many days past, of her heavy burden of sorrow. Always\r\nat first waking the realization of it sat upon her as though it would\r\ncrush the life from her body. Lying still with bated breath, she fought\r\nback waking consciousness as she had learned to do in the last three\r\nmonths, yet knew it to be futile while she was doing it.\r\n\r\nThe sun shot up between the bars of crimson, like a topaz on a lady’s\r\ngown that crowns the whole beautiful costume. The piercing, jewelled\r\nlight lay across the white face, touched the lips with warm fingers,\r\nand the troubled soul knew all that had passed.\r\n\r\nShe lay quiet, letting the torrent sweep over her with its sickening\r\nrealization. She was married! It was over--with the painful parting\r\nfrom dear ones. She was off away from them all. The new life she so\r\ndreaded had begun, and how was she to face it--the life with one whom\r\nshe feared and did not respect? How could she ever have done it but for\r\nthe love of her dear ones?\r\n\r\nGradually she came to remember the night before--the parting with\r\nher mother and her brother; the little things that brought the tears\r\nagain to her eyes. Then all was blankness. She must have fainted. She\r\ndid not often faint, but it must be--yes, she remembered opening her\r\neyes and seeing men’s faces about her, and George--could it have been\r\nGeorge?--with a kinder look in his eyes than she had ever thought to\r\nsee there. Then she must have fainted again--or had she? No, some one\r\nhad lifted her into this berth, and she had drunk something and had\r\ngone to sleep. What had happened? Where was everybody? It was good\r\nto have been left alone. She grudgingly gave her unloved husband a\r\nfragment of gratitude for not having tried to talk to her. In the\r\ncarriage on the way he had seemed determined to begin a long argument\r\nof some kind. She did not want to argue any more. She had written tomes\r\nupon the subject, and had said all she had to say. He was not deceived.\r\nHe knew she did not love him, and would never have married him but for\r\nher mother’s sake and for the sake of her beloved father’s memory. What\r\nwas the use of saying more? Let it rest. The deed was done, and they\r\nwere married. Now let him have his way and make her suffer as he chose.\r\nIf he would but let her suffer in silence and not inflict his bitter\r\ntongue upon her, she would try to bear it. And perhaps--oh, perhaps,\r\nshe would not live long, and it would soon be all over.\r\n\r\nAs the daylight grew, the girl felt an inclination to find out whether\r\nher husband was near. Cautiously she lifted her head, and, drawing back\r\na corner of the curtain, peered out.\r\n\r\nHe lay quietly on the couch, one hand under his cheek against the\r\npillow, the other across his breast, as if to guard something. He\r\nwas in the still sleep of the overwearied. He scarcely seemed to be\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nCelia dropped the curtain, and put her hand to her throat. It startled\r\nher to find him so near and so still. Softly, stealthily, she lay down\r\nagain and closed her eyes. She must not waken him. She would have as\r\nlong a time to herself as was possible, and try to think of her dear\r\nmother and her precious brother. Oh, if she were just going away from\r\nthem alone, how well she could bear it! But to be going with one whom\r\nshe had always almost hated----\r\n\r\nHer brother’s happy words about George suddenly came to her mind.\r\nJefferson had thought him fine. Well, of course the dear boy knew\r\nnothing about it. He had not read all those letters--those awful\r\nletters. He did not know the threats--the terrible language that had\r\nbeen used. She shuddered as she thought of it. But in the same breath\r\nshe was glad that her brother had been deceived. She would not have it\r\notherwise. Her dear ones must never know what she had gone through to\r\nsave them from disgrace and loss of fortune--disgrace, of course, being\r\nthe first and greatest. She had feared that George would let them see\r\nthrough his veneer of manners, and leave them troubled, but he had made\r\na better appearance than she had hoped. Ten years had made a greater\r\nchange in him than she had expected. He really had not been so bad as\r\nher conjured image of him.\r\n\r\nThen a sudden desire to look at him again seized her, to know once for\r\nall just how he really did seem. She would not want to notice him awake\r\nany more than she could help, nor dare, lest he presume upon her sudden\r\ninterest, to act as if he had never offended; but if she should look\r\nat him now as he lay asleep she might study his face and see what she\r\nreally had to expect.\r\n\r\nShe fought the desire to peer at him again, but finally it gained\r\ncomplete possession of her, and she drew back the curtain once more.\r\n\r\nHe was lying just as quietly as before. His heavy hair, a little\r\ndisordered on the pillow, gave him a noble, interesting appearance. He\r\ndid not seem at all a fellow of whom to be afraid. It was incredible\r\nthat he could have written those letters.\r\n\r\nShe tried to trace in his features a likeness to the youth of ten\r\nyears ago, whom she had known when she was but a little girl, who had\r\ntied her braids to her chair, and put raw oysters and caterpillars\r\ndown her back, or stretched invisible cords to trip her feet in dark\r\nplaces; who made her visits to a beloved uncle--whom he also had the\r\nright to call uncle, though he was no cousin of hers--a long list of\r\ncatastrophes resulting in tears; who had never failed to mortify her on\r\nall occasions possible, and once---- But the memories were too horrible\r\nas they crowded one upon another! Let them be forgotten!\r\n\r\nShe watched the face before her keenly, critically, yet she could see\r\nno trace of any such character as she had imagined the boy George must\r\nhave developed as a man; of which his letters had given her ample\r\nproof. This man’s face was finely-cut and sensitive. There was nothing\r\ncoarse or selfish in its lines. The long, dark eyelashes lay above dark\r\ncircles of weariness, and gave that look of boyishness that always\r\ntouches the maternal chord in a woman’s heart. George used to have a\r\npuffy, self-indulgent look under his eyes even when he was a boy. She\r\nhad imagined from his last photograph that he would be much stouter,\r\nmuch more bombastic; but, then, in his sleep, perhaps those things fell\r\nfrom a man.\r\n\r\nShe tried to turn away indifferently, but something in his face held\r\nher. She studied it. If he had been any other man, any stranger, she\r\nwould have said from looking at him critically that kindness and\r\ngenerosity, self-respect and respect for women, were written all over\r\nthe face before her. There was fine, firm modelling about the lips\r\nand the clean-shaven chin; and about the forehead the look almost of\r\na scholar; yet she thought she knew the man before her to be none of\r\nthese things. How deceptive were looks! She would probably be envied\r\nrather than pitied by all who saw her. Well, perhaps that was better.\r\nShe could the easier keep her trouble to herself. But stay, what was\r\nthere about this man that seemed different? The smooth face? Yes.\r\nShe had the dim impression that last night he wore a mustache. She\r\nmust have been mistaken, of course. She had only looked at him when\r\nabsolutely necessary, and her brain was in such a whirl; but still\r\nthere seemed to be something different about him.\r\n\r\nHer eyes wandered to the hand that lay across his breast. It was the\r\nfine white hand of the professional man, the kind of hand that somehow\r\nattracts the eye with a sense of cleanness and strength. There was\r\nnothing flabby about it. George as a boy used to have big, stumpy\r\nfingers and nails chewed down to the quick. She could remember how\r\nshe used to hate to look at them when she was a little girl, and yet\r\nsomehow could not keep her eyes away. She saw with relief that the\r\nnails on this hand were well shaped and well cared for.\r\n\r\nHe looked very handsome and attractive as he lay there. The sun shot\r\none of its early daring bolts of light across his hair as the train\r\nturned in its course and lurched northward around a curve. It glinted\r\nthere for a moment, like a miniature search-light, travelling over the\r\nhead, showing up every wave and curve. He had the kind of hair which\r\nmakes a woman’s hand instinctively long to touch it. Celia wondered\r\nat the curious thoughts that crowded through her mind, knowing that\r\nall the while there was the consciousness that when this man should\r\nwake she would think of nothing but his hateful personality as she had\r\nknown it through the years. And she was his wife! How strange! How\r\nterrible! How impossible to live with the thought through interminable\r\nweary years! Oh, that she might die at once before her strength failed\r\nand her mother found out her sorrow! She lay back again on her pillows\r\nvery still and tried to think, but somehow a pleasant image of him,\r\nher husband, lingered in her memory. Could it be possible that she\r\nwould ever see anything pleasant in him? Ever endure the days of his\r\ncompanionship? Ever come to the point where she could overlook his\r\noutrageous conduct toward her, forgive him, and be even tolerant of\r\nhim? Sharp memories crowded upon her, and the smarting tears stung\r\ntheir way into her eyes, answering and echoing in her heart, “No, no, a\r\nthousand times, no!” She had paid his price and gained redemption for\r\nher own, but--forget what he had done? _Never!_\r\n\r\nThe long strain of weariness, and the monotony of the onrushing train,\r\nlulled her half into unconsciousness again, and the man on the couch\r\nslumbered on.\r\n\r\nHe came to himself suddenly, with all his senses on the alert, as the\r\nthumping noise and motion of the train ceased, and a sudden silence of\r\nopen country succeeded, broken now and again by distant oncoming and\r\nreceding voices. He caught the fragment of a sentence from some train\r\nofficial: “It’s a half-hour late, and maybe more. We’ll just have to\r\nlie by, that’s all. Here, you, Jim, take this flag and run up to the\r\nswitch----” The voice trailed into the distance, ended by the metallic\r\nnote of a hammer doing something mysterious to the underpinning of the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\nGordon sat up suddenly, his hand yet across his breast, where his first\r\nwaking thought had been to feel if the little pencil-case were safe.\r\n\r\nGlancing stealthily toward the curtains of the berth, and perceiving no\r\nmotion, he concluded that the girl still slept.\r\n\r\nSoftly he slipped his feet into his shoes, gave one or two other\r\ntouches to his toilet, and stood up, looking toward the curtains. He\r\nwanted to go out and see where they were stopping, but dared he go\r\nwithout knowing that she was all right?\r\n\r\nSoftly, reverently, he stooped and brought his face close to the\r\nopening in the curtains. Celia felt his eyes upon her. Her own were\r\nclosed, and by a superhuman effort she controlled her breathing,\r\nslowly, gently, as if she were asleep.\r\n\r\nHe looked for a long moment, thrilled by the delicate beauty of her\r\nsleeping face, filled with an intoxicating joy to see that her lips\r\nwere no longer white; then, turning reverently away, he unlocked the\r\ndoor and stepped forth.\r\n\r\nThe other occupants of the car were still wrapped in slumber. Loud\r\nsnores of various kinds and qualities testified to that. A dim light at\r\nthe further end contended luridly, and losingly, with the daylight now\r\nflooding the outside world and creeping mischievously into the transoms.\r\n\r\nGordon closed the door of the compartment noiselessly and went down the\r\naisle to the end of the car.\r\n\r\nA door was open, and he could hear voices outside. The conductor stood\r\ntalking with two brakemen. He heard the words: “Three-quarters of an\r\nhour at least,” and then the men walked off toward the engine.\r\n\r\nGordon looked across the country, and for the first time since he\r\nstarted on his journey let himself remember that it was springtime and\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nThere had been a bitter wind the night before, with a hint of rain in\r\nthe air. In fact, it had rained quite smartly during the ride to the\r\nhospital with the hurt child, but he had been so perturbed that he had\r\ntaken little notice of the weather. But this was a radiant morning.\r\n\r\nThe sun was in one of its most charming moods, when it touches\r\neverything with a sort of unnatural glory after the long winter of\r\ndarkness and cold. Every tree trunk in the distance seemed to stand out\r\nclearly, every little grass-blade was set with a glowing jewel, and the\r\nwinding stream across a narrow valley fairly blazed with brightness.\r\nThe very road with its deep, clean wheel-grooves seemed like a\r\nwell-taken photograph.\r\n\r\nThe air had an alluring softness mingled with its tang of winter that\r\nmade one long to take a walk anywhere out into the world, just for\r\nthe joy of being and doing. A meadow-lark shot up from somewhere to a\r\ntelegraph pole, let go a blithe note, and hurried on. It was glorious.\r\nThe exhilaration filled Gordon’s blood.\r\n\r\nAnd here was the chance he craved to slip away from the train before\r\nit reached a place where he could be discovered. If he had but thought\r\nto bring his suit-case! He could slip back now without being noticed\r\nand get it! He could even go without it! But--he could not leave her\r\nthat way--could he? Ought he? Perhaps he ought---- But it would not do\r\nto leave his suit-case with her, for it contained letters addressed to\r\nhis real name. An explanation would of course be demanded, and he could\r\nnever satisfy a loving mother and brother for having left a helpless\r\ngirl in such a situation--even if he could satisfy his own conscience,\r\nwhich he knew he never could. He simply could not leave her, and yet he\r\n_must_ get away from that train as soon as possible. Perhaps this was\r\nthe only opportunity he would have before reaching Buffalo, and it was\r\nvery risky, indeed dangerous, to dare enter Buffalo. It was a foregone\r\nconclusion that there would be private detectives ready to meet the\r\ntrain in Buffalo with full descriptions and particulars and only too\r\nready to make way with him if they could do so without being found out.\r\nHe looked nervously back at the door of the car. Dared he attempt to\r\nwaken her and say that they had made a mistake and must change cars?\r\nWas she well enough? And where could they go?\r\n\r\nHe looked off toward the landscape for answer to his question.\r\n\r\nThey were decidedly in the country. The train stood at the top of\r\na high embankment of cinders, below which was a smooth country road\r\nrunning parallel to the railroad for some distance till it met another\r\nroad at right angles to it, which stretched away between thrifty\r\nmeadow-lands to a nestling village. The glorified stream he had first\r\nnoticed far up the valley glinted narrower here in the morning light,\r\nwith a suggestion of watercress and forget-me-nots in its fringes as\r\nit veered away under a bridge toward the village and hid itself in a\r\ntangle of willows and cat-tails.\r\n\r\nHow easy it would be to slide down that embankment, and walk out that\r\nroad over the bridge to the village, where of course a conveyance of\r\nsome sort could be hired to bear him to another railroad town and\r\nthence to--Pittsburgh, perhaps, where he could easily get a train to\r\nWashington. How easy if only he were not held by some invisible hands\r\nto care for the sweet sleeper inside the car! And yet, for her sake as\r\nwell as his own, he must do something, and that right speedily.\r\n\r\nHe was standing thus in deep meditation, looking off at the little\r\nvillage which seemed so near and yet would be so far for her to walk,\r\nwhen he was pervaded with that strange sense of some one near. For an\r\ninstant he resisted the desire to lift his eyes and prove to himself\r\nthat no one was present in a doorway which a moment before he knew had\r\nbeen unoccupied. Then, frowning at his own nervousness, he turned.\r\n\r\nShe stood there in all the beauty of her fresh young girlhood, a\r\ndelicate pallor on her cheeks, and a deep sadness in her great dark\r\neyes, which were fixed upon him intently, in a sort of puzzled study.\r\nShe was fully dressed, even to her hat and gloves. Every wave of her\r\ngolden hair lay exquisitely in place under the purple hat, as though\r\nshe might have taken an hour or two at her toilet; yet she had made it\r\nwith excited haste, and with trembling fingers, determined to have it\r\naccomplished before the return of her dreaded liege lord.\r\n\r\nShe had sprung from her berth the instant he closed the door upon her,\r\nand fastened the little catch to bar him out. She had dashed cold water\r\ninto her face, fastened her garments hurriedly, and tossed the glory\r\nof her hair into place with a few touches and what hairpins she could\r\nfind on the floor. Then putting on her hat, coat, and gloves, she had\r\nfollowed him into the outer air. She had a feeling that she must have\r\nair to breathe or she would suffocate. A wild desire filled her to go\r\nalone into the great out-of-doors. Oh, if she but dared to run away\r\nfrom him! But that she might not do, for all his threats would then\r\nprobably be made good by him upon her dear mother and brother. No,\r\nshe must be patient and bear to the end all that was set down for her.\r\nBut she would get out and breathe a little before he returned. He had\r\nvery likely gone into the smoker. She remembered that the George of\r\nold had been an inveterate smoker of cigarettes. She would have time\r\nfor a taste of the morning while he had his smoke. And if he returned\r\nand found her gone what mattered it? The inevitable beginning of\r\nconversations which she so dreaded would be put off for a time.\r\n\r\nShe never thought to come upon him standing thus alone, looking off at\r\nthe beauty of the morning as if he enjoyed it. The sight of him held\r\nher still, watching, as his sleeping face had held her gaze earlier\r\nin the morning. How different he was from what she had expected! How\r\nthe ten years had changed him! One could almost fancy it might have\r\nchanged his spirit also--but for those letters--those terrible letters!\r\nThe writer of those letters could not change, except for the worse!\r\nAnd yet, he was handsome, intellectual looking, kindly in his bearing,\r\nappreciative of the beauty about him--she could not deny it. It was\r\nmost astonishing. He had lost that baggy look under his eyes, and the\r\nweak, selfish, cruel pout of lip she remembered so keenly.\r\n\r\nThen he turned, and a smile of delight and welcome lit up his face. In\r\nspite of herself, she could not keep an answering smile from glimmering\r\nfaintly in her own.\r\n\r\n“What! You up and out here?” he said, hastening closer to the step.\r\n“How are you feeling this morning? Better, I’m sure, or you would not\r\nbe here so early.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I had to get out to the air,” she said. “I couldn’t stand the car\r\nanother minute. I wish we could walk the rest of the way.”\r\n\r\n“Do you?” he said, with a quick, surprised appreciation in his voice.\r\n“I was just wishing something like that myself. Do you see that\r\nbeautiful straight road down there? I was longing to slide down this\r\nbank and walk over to that little village for breakfast. Then we could\r\nget an auto, perhaps, or a carriage, to take us on to another train. If\r\nyou hadn’t been so ill last night, I might have proposed it.”\r\n\r\n“Could we?” she asked, earnestly. “I should like it so much;” and there\r\nwas eagerness in her voice. “What a lovely morning!” Her eyes were\r\nwistful, like the eyes of those who weep and wonder why they may not\r\nlaugh, since sunshine is still yellow.\r\n\r\n“Of course we could,” he said, “if you were only able.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’m able enough. I should much rather do that than to go back into\r\nthat stuffy car. But wouldn’t they think it awfully queer of us to run\r\naway from the train this way?”\r\n\r\n“They needn’t know anything about it,” he declared, like a boy about\r\nto play truant. “I’ll slip back in the car and get our suit-cases. Is\r\nthere anything of yours I might be in danger of leaving behind?”\r\n\r\n“No, I put everything in my suit-case before I came out,” she said,\r\nlistlessly, as though she had already lost her desire to go.\r\n\r\n“I’m afraid you are not able,” he said, pausing solicitously as he\r\nscaled the steps.\r\n\r\nShe was surprised at his interest in her welfare.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course I am,” she said, insistently. “I have often taken\r\nlonger walks than that looks to be, and I shall feel much better for\r\nbeing out. I really feel as if I couldn’t stand it any longer in there.”\r\n\r\n“Good! Then, we’ll try it!”\r\n\r\nHe hurried in for the baggage and left her standing on the cinder\r\nroadbed beside the train looking off at the opening morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was just at that instant that the thick-set man in his berth not ten\r\nfeet away became broadly conscious of the unwonted stillness of the\r\ntrain and the cessation of motion that had lulled him to such sound\r\nrepose. So does a tiny, sharp sound strike upon our senses and bring\r\nthem into life again from sleep, making us aware of a state of things\r\nthat has been going on for some time perhaps without our realization.\r\nThe sound that roused him may have been the click of the stateroom\r\nlatch as Gordon opened the door.\r\n\r\nThe shades were down in the man’s berth and the curtains drawn close.\r\nThe daylight had not as yet penetrated through their thickness. But\r\nonce awake his senses were immediately on the alert. He yawned,\r\nstretched and suddenly arrested another yawn to analyze the utter\r\nstillness all about him. A sonorous snore suddenly emphasized the\r\nquiet of the car, and made him aware of all the occupants of all those\r\ncurtained apartments. His mind went over a quick résumé of the night\r\nbefore, and detailed him at once to duty.\r\n\r\nAnother soft clicking of the latch set him to listening and his bristly\r\nshocked head was stuck instantly out between the curtains into the\r\naisle, eyes toward the stateroom door, just in time to see that a man\r\nwas stealing quietly down the passageway out of the end door, carrying\r\ntwo suit-cases and an umbrella. It was his man. He was sure instantly,\r\nand his mind grew frantic with the thought. Almost he had outdone\r\nhimself through foolish sleep.\r\n\r\nHe half sprang from his berth, then remembered that he was but partly\r\ndressed, and jerked back quickly to grab his clothes, stopping in\r\nthe operation of putting them on to yank up his window shade with an\r\nimpatient click and flatten his face against the window-pane!\r\n\r\nYes, there they were down on the ground outside the train, both of\r\nthem; man, woman, baggage and all slipping away from him while he slept\r\npeacefully and let them go! The language of his mind at that point was\r\nhot with invectives.\r\n\r\nGordon had made his way back to the girl’s side without meeting any\r\nporters or wakeful fellow-passengers. But a distant rumbling greeted\r\nhis ears. The waited-for express was coming. If they were to get away,\r\nit must be done at once or their flight would be discovered, and\r\nperhaps even prevented. It certainly was better not to have it known\r\nwhere they got off. He had taken the precaution to close the stateroom\r\ndoor behind him and so it might be some time before their absence\r\nwould be discovered. Perhaps there would be other stops before the\r\ntrain reached Buffalo, in which case their track would not easily be\r\nfollowed. He had no idea that the evil eye of his pursuer was even then\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nCelia was already on the ground, looking off toward the little village\r\nwistfully. Just how it was to make her lot any brighter to get out\r\nof the train and run away to a strange little village she did not\r\nquite explain to herself, but it seemed to be a relief to her pent-up\r\nfeelings. She was half afraid that George might raise some new\r\nobjection when he returned.\r\n\r\nGordon swung himself down on the cinder path, scanning the track\r\neither way. The conductor and brakemen were not in sight. Far in the\r\ndistance a black speck was rushing down upon them. Gordon could hear\r\nthe vibration of the rail of the second track, upon which he placed his\r\nfoot as he helped Celia across. In a moment more the train would pass.\r\nIt was important that they should be down the embankment, out of sight.\r\nWould the delicate girl not be afraid of the steep incline?\r\n\r\nShe hesitated for just an instant at the top, for it was very steep.\r\nThen, looking up at him, she saw that he expected her to go down with\r\nhim. She gave a little frightened gasp, set her lips, and started.\r\n\r\nHe held her as well as he could with two suit-cases and an umbrella\r\nclutched in his other hand, and finally, as the grade grew steeper,\r\nhe let go the baggage altogether, and it slid briskly down by itself,\r\nwhile he devoted himself to steadying the girl’s now inevitable and\r\nswift descent.\r\n\r\nIt certainly was not an ideal way of travelling, this new style of\r\n“gravity” road, but it landed them without delay, though much shaken\r\nand scratched, and divested of every vestige of dignity. It was\r\nimpossible not to laugh, and Celia’s voice rang out merrily, showing\r\nthat she had not always wept and looked sorrowful.\r\n\r\n“Are you much hurt?” asked Gordon anxiously, holding her hands and\r\nlooking down at her tenderly.\r\n\r\nBefore she could reply, the express train roared above them, drowning\r\ntheir voices and laughter; and when it was past they saw their own\r\ntrain take up its interrupted way grumblingly, and rapidly move off.\r\nIf the passengers on those two trains had not been deeply wrapped in\r\nslumber, they might have been surprised to see two fashionably attired\r\nyoung persons, with hats awry and clasped hands, laughing in a country\r\nroad at five o’clock of a May morning. But only one was awake, and by\r\nthe time the two in the road below remembered to look up and take\r\nnotice, the trains were rapidly disappearing.\r\n\r\nThe girl had been deeply impressed with Gordon’s solicitude for her.\r\nIt was so out of keeping with his letters. He had never seemed to care\r\nwhether she suffered or not. In all the arrangements, he had said what\r\n_he_ wanted, indeed what he _would have_, with an implied threat in\r\nthe framing of his sentence in case she dared demur. Never had there\r\nbeen the least expression of desire for her happiness. Therefore it was\r\nsomething of a surprise to find him so gentle and thoughtful of her.\r\nPerhaps, after all, he would not prove so terrible to live with as she\r\nhad feared. And yet--how could anyone who wrote those letters have any\r\nalleviating qualities? It could not be. She must harden herself against\r\nhim. Still, if he would be outwardly decent to her, it would make her\r\nlot easier, of course.\r\n\r\nBut her course of mental reasoning was broken in upon by his stout\r\ndenunciations of himself.\r\n\r\n“I ought not to have allowed you to slide down there,” he declared. “It\r\nwas terrible, after what you went through last night. I didn’t realize\r\nhow steep and rough it was. Indeed I didn’t. I don’t see how you ever\r\ncan forgive me.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’m not hurt,” she said gently, astonished at his solicitation.\r\nThere was a strange lump in her throat brought by his kindness, which\r\nthreatened tears. Just why should kindness from an unexpected quarter\r\nbring tears?\r\n\r\n“I’m only a little shaken up,” she went on as she saw a real anxiety\r\nin his brown eyes, “and I don’t mind it in the least. I think it was\r\nrather fun, don’t you?”\r\n\r\nA faint glimmer of a smile wavered over the corners of her mouth, and\r\nGordon experienced a sudden desire to take her in his arms and kiss\r\nher. It was a strange new feeling. He had never had any such thought\r\nabout Julia Bentley.\r\n\r\n“Why, I--why, yes, I guess so, if you’re sure you’re not hurt.”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” she said, and then, for some unexplained reason, they both\r\nbegan to laugh. After that they felt better.\r\n\r\n“If your shoes are as full of these miserable cinders as mine are, they\r\nneed emptying,” declared Gordon, shaking first one well-shod foot and\r\nthen the other, and looking ruefully at the little velvet boots of the\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n“Suppose you sit down”--he looked about for a seat, but the dewy grass\r\nwas the only resting place visible. He pitched upon the suit-cases and\r\nimprovised a chair. “Now, sit down and let me take them off for you.”\r\n\r\nHe knelt in the road at her feet as she obeyed, protesting that she\r\ncould do it for herself. But he overruled her, and began clumsily to\r\nunbutton the tiny buttons, holding the timid little foot firmly, almost\r\nreverently, against his knee.\r\n\r\nHe drew the velvet shoe softly off, and, turning it upside down, shook\r\nout the intruding cinders, put a clumsy finger in to make sure they\r\nwere all gone; then shyly, tenderly, passed his hand over the sole of\r\nthe fine silk-stockinged foot that rested so lightly on his knee, to\r\nmake sure no cinders clung to it. The sight and touch of that little\r\nfoot stirred him deeply. He had never before been called upon to render\r\nservice so intimate to any woman, and he did it now with half-averted\r\ngaze and the utmost respect in his manner. As he did it he tried to\r\nspeak about the morning, the departing train, the annoying cinders,\r\nanything to make their unusual position seem natural and unstrained. He\r\nfelt deeply embarrassed, the more so because of his own double part in\r\nthis queer masquerade.\r\n\r\nCelia sat watching him, strangely stirred. Her wonder over his kindness\r\ngrew with each moment, and her prejudices almost dissolved. She could\r\nnot understand it. There must be something more he wanted of her, for\r\nGeorge Hayne had never been kind in the past unless he wanted something\r\nof her. She dreaded lest she should soon find it out. Yet he did not\r\nlook like a man who was deceiving her. She drew a deep sigh. If only\r\nit were true, and he were good and kind, and had never written those\r\nawful letters! How good and dear it would be to be tenderly cared for\r\nthis way! Her lips drooped at the corners, and her eyelids drooped in\r\ncompany with the sigh; then Gordon looked up in great distress.\r\n\r\n“You are tired!” he declared, pausing in his attempt to fasten the\r\nlittle pearl buttons. “I have been cruel to let you get off the train!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed I’m not,” said the girl, brightening with sudden effort. At\r\nleast, she would not spoil the kindness while it lasted. It was surely\r\nbetter than what she had feared.\r\n\r\n“You never can button those shoes with your fingers,” she laughed,\r\nas he redoubled his efforts to capture a tiny disc of pearl and set\r\nit into its small velvet socket. “Here! I have a button-hook in my\r\nhand-bag. Try this.”\r\n\r\nShe produced a small silver instrument from a gold-link bag on her arm\r\nand handed it to him. He took it helplessly, trying first one end and\r\nthen the other, and succeeding with neither.\r\n\r\n“Here, let me show you,” she laughed, pulling off one glove. Her white\r\nfingers grasped the silver button-hook, and flashed in and out of\r\nthe velvet holes, knitting the little shoe to the foot in no time. He\r\nwatched the process in humble wonder, and she would not have been a\r\nhuman girl not to have been flattered with his interest and admiration.\r\nFor the minute she forgot who and what he was, and let her laugh ring\r\nout merrily; and so with shy audacity he assayed to take off the other\r\nshoe.\r\n\r\nThey really felt quite well acquainted and as if they were going on\r\na day’s picnic, when they finally gathered up their belongings and\r\nstarted down the road. Gordon summoned all his ready wit and intellect\r\nto brighten the walk for her, though he found himself again and again\r\non the brink of referring to his Washington life, or some other\r\npersonal matter that would have brought a wondering question to her\r\nlips. He had decided that he must not tell her who he was until he\r\ncould put her in an independent position, where she could get away\r\nfrom him at once if she chose. He was bound to look after her until\r\nhe could place her in good hands, or at least where she could look\r\nafter herself, and it was better to carry it out leaving her to think\r\nwhat she pleased until he could tell her everything. If all went well,\r\nthey might be able to catch a Pittsburgh train that night and be in\r\nWashington the next day. Then, his message delivered, he would tell\r\nher the whole story. Until then he must hold his peace.\r\n\r\nThey went gaily down the road, the girl’s pale cheeks beginning\r\nto flush with the morning and the exercise. She was not naturally\r\ndelicate, and her faint the night before had been the result of a\r\nseries of heavy strains on a heart burdened with terrible fear. The\r\nmorning and his kindness had made her forget for the time that she was\r\nsupposed to be walking into a world of dread and sacrifice.\r\n\r\n  “The year’s at the spring,\r\n  The day’s at the morn,”\r\n\r\nquoted Gordon gaily,\r\n\r\n  “Morning’s at seven;\r\n  The hill-side’s dew-pearled----”\r\n\r\nHe waved an umbrella off to where a hill flashed back a thousand lights\r\nfrom its jewelled grass-blades thickly set.\r\n\r\n  “The lark’s on the wing;\r\n  The snail’s on the thorn,”\r\n\r\nwent on Celia suddenly catching his spirit, and pointing to a lark that\r\ndarted up into the blue with a trill of the morning in his throat.\r\n\r\nGordon turned appreciative eyes upon her. It was good to have her take\r\nup his favorite poet in that tone of voice--a tone that showed she too\r\nknew and loved Browning.\r\n\r\n  “God’s in his heaven,\r\n  All’s right with the world,”\r\n\r\nfinished Gordon in a quieter voice, looking straight into her eyes.\r\n“That seems very true, to-day, doesn’t it?”\r\n\r\nThe blue eyes wavered with a hint of shadow in them as they looked back\r\ninto the brown ones.\r\n\r\n“Almost--perhaps,” she faltered wistfully.\r\n\r\nThe young man wished he dared go behind that “almost--perhaps” and find\r\nout what she meant, but concluded it were better to bring back the\r\nsmile and help her to forget for a little while at least.\r\n\r\nDown by the brook, they paused to rest, under a weeping willow, whose\r\ngreen-tinged plumes were dabbling in the brook. Gordon arranged the\r\nsuit-cases for her to sit upon, then climbed down to the brookside and\r\ngathered a great bunch of forget-me-nots, blue as her eyes, and brought\r\nthem to her.\r\n\r\nShe looked at them in wonder, to think they grew out here, wild,\r\nuntended. She had never seen them before, except in pots in the\r\nflorist’s windows. She touched them delicately with the tips of her\r\nfingers, as if they were too ethereal for earth; then fastened them in\r\nthe breast of her gown.\r\n\r\n“They exactly match your eyes!” he exclaimed involuntarily, and then\r\nwished he had not spoken, for she flushed and paled under his glance,\r\nuntil he felt he had been unduly bold. He wondered why he had said\r\nthat. He never had been in the habit of saying pretty things to girls,\r\nbut this girl somehow called it from him. It was genuine. He sat a\r\nmoment abashed, not knowing what to say next, as if he were a shy boy,\r\nand she did not help him, for her eyelashes drooped in a long becoming\r\nsweep over her cheeks, and she seemed for the moment not to be able to\r\ncarry off the situation. He was not sure if she were displeased or not.\r\n\r\nHer heart had thrilled strangely as he spoke, and she was vexed with\r\nherself that it should be so. A man who had bullied and threatened her\r\nfor three terrible months and forced her to marry him had no right to\r\na thrill of her heart nor a look from her eyes, be he ever so kind for\r\nthe moment. He certainly was nice and pleasant when he chose to be;\r\nshe must watch herself, for never, never, must she yield weakly to his\r\nsmooth overtures. Well did she know him. He had some reason for all\r\nthis pleasantness. It would surely be revealed soon.\r\n\r\nShe stiffened her lips and tried to look away from him to the\r\npurply-green hills; but the echo of his words came upon her again,\r\nand again her heart thrilled at them. What if--oh what if he were all\r\nright, and she might accept the admiration in his voice? And yet how\r\ncould that be possible? The sweet color came into her cheeks again,\r\nand the tears flew quickly to her eyes, till they looked all sky and\r\ndew, and she dared not turn back to him.\r\n\r\nThe silence remained unbroken, until a lark in the willow copse behind\r\nthem burst forth into song and broke the spell that was upon them.\r\n\r\n“Are you offended at what I said?” he asked earnestly. “I am sorry if\r\nyou did not like it. The words said themselves without my stopping to\r\nthink whether you might not like it. Will you forgive me?”\r\n\r\n“Oh,” she said, lifting her forget-me-not eyes to his, “I am not\r\noffended. There is nothing to forgive. It was--beautiful!”\r\n\r\nThen his eyes spoke the compliment over again, and the thrill started\r\nanew in her heart, till her cheeks grew quite rosy, and she buried her\r\nface in the coolness of the tiny flowers to hide her confusion.\r\n\r\n“It was very true,” he said in a low, lover-like voice that sounded\r\nlike a caress.\r\n\r\n“Oughtn’t we to hurry on to catch our train?” said Celia, suddenly\r\nspringing to her feet. “I’m quite rested now.” She felt if she stayed\r\nthere another moment she would yield to the spell he had cast upon her.\r\n\r\nWith a dull thud of consciousness the man got himself to his feet and\r\nreminded himself that this was another man’s promised wife to whom he\r\nhad been letting his soul go out.\r\n\r\n“Don’t let anything hinder you! Don’t let anything hinder you!”\r\nsuddenly babbled out the little brook, and he gathered up his\r\nsuit-cases and started on.\r\n\r\n“I am going to carry my suit-case,” declared a very decided voice\r\nbehind him, and a small hand seized hold of its handle.\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon, you are not!” declared Gordon in a much more\r\ndetermined voice.\r\n\r\n“But they are too heavy for you--both of them--and the umbrella too,”\r\nshe protested. “Give me the umbrella then.”\r\n\r\nBut he would not give her even the umbrella, rejoicing in his strength\r\nto shield her and bear her burdens. As she walked beside him, she\r\nremembered vividly a morning when George Hayne had made her carry two\r\nheavy baskets, that his hands might be free to shoot birds. Could this\r\nbe the same George Hayne?\r\n\r\nAltogether, it was a happy walk, and far shorter than either had\r\nexpected it to be, though Gordon worried not a little about his frail\r\ncompanion before they came to the outskirts of the village, and kept\r\nbegging her to sit down and rest again, but she would not. She was\r\nquite eager and excited about the strange village to which they were\r\ncoming. Its outlying farm-houses were all so clean and white, with\r\ngreen blinds folded placidly over their front windows, and only their\r\nback doors astir. The cows all looked peaceful, and the dogs all seemed\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nThey walked up the village street, shaded in patches with flecks of\r\nsunshine through the young leaves. If anyone had told Celia Hathaway\r\nthe night before that she would have walked and talked thus to-day\r\nwith her bridegroom she would have laughed him to scorn. But now all\r\nunconsciously she had drifted into an attitude of friendliness with the\r\nman whom she had thought to hate all the rest of her life.\r\n\r\nOne long, straight, maple-lined street, running parallel to the stream,\r\ncomprised the village. They walked to the centre of it, and still saw\r\nno signs of a restaurant. A post-office, a couple of stores and a\r\nbakery made up the business portion of the town, and upon enquiry it\r\nappeared that there was no public eating house, the one hotel of the\r\nplace having been sold at auction the week before on account of the\r\ndeath of the owner. The early village loungers stared disinterestedly\r\nat the phenomenal appearance in their midst of a couple of city folks\r\nwith their luggage and no apparent means of transit except their two\r\ndelicately shod feet. It presented a problem too grave to be solved\r\nunassisted, and there were solemn shakings of the head over them. At\r\nlast one who had discouragingly stated the village lack of a public inn\r\nasked casually:\r\n\r\n“Hed a runaway?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” laughed Gordon pleasantly. “We didn’t travel with horses.”\r\n\r\n“Hed a puncture, then,” announced the village wiseacre, shifting from\r\none foot to the other.\r\n\r\n“Wal, you come the wrong direction to git help,” said another languid\r\nlistener. “Thur ain’t no garridge here. The feller what uset to keep it\r\nskipped out with Sam Galt’s wife a month ago. You’d ought to ’a’ turned\r\nback to Ashville. They got a good blacksmith there can tinker ye up.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so?” said Gordon interestedly. “Well now that’s too bad, but\r\nperhaps as it can’t be helped we’ll have to forget it. What’s the next\r\ntown on ahead and how far?”\r\n\r\n“Sugar Grove’s two mile further on, and Milton’s five. They’ve got a\r\ngarridge and a rest’rant to Milton, but that’s only sence the railroad\r\nbuilt a junction there.”\r\n\r\n“Has anyone here a conveyance I could hire to take us to Milton?”\r\nquestioned Gordon, looking anxiously about the indolent group.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t want to drive to Milton for less’n five dollars,” declared\r\na lazy youth after a suitable pause.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said Gordon. “How soon can you be ready, and what sort of\r\na rig have you? Will it be comfortable for the lady?”\r\n\r\nThe youth eyed the graceful woman in her dainty city dress scornfully.\r\nHis own country lass was dressed far prettier to his mind; but the eyes\r\nof her, so blue, like the little weed-flowers at her breast, went to\r\nhis head. His tongue was suddenly tied.\r\n\r\n“It’s all right! It’s as good’s you’ll get!” volunteered a sullen-faced\r\nman half sitting on a sugar barrel. He was of a type who preferred to\r\nsee fashionable ladies uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nThe youth departed for his “team” and after some enquiries Gordon\r\nfound that he might be able to persuade the owner of the tiny white\r\ncolonial cot across the street to prepare a “snack” for himself and\r\nhis companion, so they went across the street and waited fifteen\r\nminutes in a dank little hair-cloth parlor adorned in funeral wreaths\r\nand knit tidies, for a delicious breakfast of poached eggs, coffee,\r\nhome-made bread, butter like roses, and a comb of amber honey. To each\r\nthe experience was a new one, and they enjoyed it together like two\r\nchildren, letting their eyes speak volumes of comments in the midst of\r\nthe old lady’s volubility. Unconsciously by their experiences they\r\nwere being brought into sympathy with each other.\r\n\r\nThe “rig” when it arrived at the door driven by the blushing youth\r\nproved to be a high spring wagon with two seats. In the front one the\r\nyouth lounged without a thought of assisting his passengers. Gordon\r\nswung the baggage up, and then lifted the girl into the back seat,\r\nhimself taking the place beside her, and planting a firm hand and arm\r\nbehind the backless seat, that she might feel more secure.\r\n\r\nThat ride, with his arm behind her, was just one more link in the\r\npretty chain of sympathy that was being welded about these two.\r\nUnconsciously more and more she began to droop, until when she grew\r\nvery tired he seemed to know at once.\r\n\r\n“Just lean against my arm,” he said. “You must be very tired and it\r\nwill help you bear the jolting.” He spoke as if his arm were made of\r\nwood or iron, and was merely one of his belongings, like an umbrella\r\nor suit-case. He made it seem quite the natural thing for her to\r\nlean against him. If he had claimed it as her right and privilege\r\nas wife, she would have recoiled from him for recalling to her the\r\nhated relation, and would have sat straight as a bean-pole the rest\r\nof the way, but, as it was, she sank back a trifle deprecatingly, and\r\nrealized that it was a great help. In her heart she thanked him for\r\nmaking it possible for her to rest without entirely compromising her\r\nattitude toward him. There was nothing about it that suggested anything\r\nlover-like; it seemed just a common courtesy.\r\n\r\nYet the strong arm almost trembled as he felt the precious weight\r\nagainst it, and he wished that the way were ten miles instead of five.\r\nOnce, as Celia leaned forward to point to a particularly lovely bit of\r\nview that opened up as they wound around a curve in the road, they ran\r\nover a stone, and the wagon gave an unexpected jolt. Gordon reached\r\nhis hand out to steady her, and she settled back to his arm with a\r\nsense of safety and being cared for that was very pleasant. Looking up\r\nshyly, she saw his eyes upon her, with that deep look of admiration\r\nand something more, and again that strange thrill of joy that had\r\ncome when he gave her the forget-me-nots swept through her. She felt\r\nalmost as if she were harboring a sinful thought when she remembered\r\nthe letters he had written; but the joy of the day, and the sweetness\r\nof happiness for even a moment, when she had been for so long a time\r\nsad, was so pleasant that she let herself enjoy it and drift, refusing\r\nto think evil of him now, here, in this bright day. Thus like children\r\non a picnic, they passed through Sugar Grove and came to the town of\r\nMilton, and there they bade their driver good-by, rewarding him with\r\na crisp five-dollar bill. He drove home with a vision of smiles in\r\nforget-me-not eyes, and a marked inability to tell anything about his\r\nwonderful passengers who had filled the little village with awe and\r\namazement, and had given no clue to anyone as to who or what they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to go back to the pursuer, in his berth, baffled and frantic and\r\nraging. With hands that fumbled because of their very eagerness he\r\nsought to get into his garments, and find his shoes from the melée of\r\nblankets and other articles in the berth, all the time keeping one eye\r\nout of the window, for he must not let his prey get away from him now.\r\nHe must watch and see what they were going to do. How fortunate that he\r\nhad wakened in time for that. At least he would have a clue. Where was\r\nthis? A station?\r\n\r\nHe stopped operations once more to gaze off at the landscape, a\r\ndesolate country scene to his city hardened eyes. Not a house in sight,\r\nnor a station. The spires of the distant village seemed like a mirage\r\nto him. This couldn’t be a station. What were those two doing down\r\nthere anyway? Dared he risk calling the conductor and having him hold\r\nthem? No, this affair must be kept absolutely quiet. Mr. Holman had\r\nsaid that if a breath of the matter came out it was worse than death\r\nfor all concerned. He must just get off this train as fast as he could\r\nand follow them if they were getting away. It might be he could get the\r\nman in a lonely place--it would be easy enough to watch his chance\r\nand gag the lady--he had done such things before. He felt far more\r\nat home in such an affair than he had the night before at the Holman\r\ndinner-table. What a pity one of the others had not come along. It\r\nwould be mere child’s play for two to handle those two who looked as\r\nif they would turn frightened at the first threat. However, he felt\r\nconfident that he could manage the affair alone.\r\n\r\nHe panted with haste and succeeded in getting the wrong legs into\r\nhis trousers and having to begin all over again, his efforts greatly\r\nhampered by the necessity for watching out the window.\r\n\r\nThen came the distant rumble of an oncoming train, and an answering\r\nscream from his own engine. The two on the ground had crossed quickly\r\nover the second track and were looking down the steep embankment.\r\nWere they going down there? What fate that he was not ready to follow\r\nthem at once! The train that was coming would pass--their own would\r\nstart--and he could not get out. His opportunity was going from him and\r\nhe could not find his shoes!\r\n\r\nWell what of it? He would go without! What were shoes in a time like\r\nthis? Surely he could get along barefoot, and beg a pair at some\r\nfarmhouse, or buy a pair at a country store. He must get out at any\r\ncost, shoes or no shoes. Grasping his coat which contained his money\r\nand valuables he sprang from his berth straight into the arms of the\r\nporter who was hurrying back to his car after having been out to gossip\r\nwith a brakeman over the delay.\r\n\r\n“What’s de mattah, sah?” asked the astonished porter, rallying quickly\r\nfrom the shock and assuming his habitual courtesy.\r\n\r\n“My shoes!” roared the irate traveller. “What have you done with my\r\nshoes?”\r\n\r\n“Quiet, sah, please sah, you’ll wake de whole cyah,” said the porter.\r\n“I put yoh shoes under de berth sah, right whar I allus puts ’em aftah\r\nblackin’ sah.”\r\n\r\nThe porter stooped and extracted the shoes from beneath the curtain and\r\nthe traveller, whose experience in Pullmans was small, grabbed them\r\nfuriously and made for the door, shoes in hand, for with a snort and a\r\nlurch and a preliminary jar the train had taken up its motion, and a\r\nloud rushing outside proclaimed that the other train was passing.\r\n\r\nThe porter, feeling that he had been treated with injustice, stood\r\ngazing reproachfully after the man for a full minute before he followed\r\nhim to tell him that the wash-room was at the other end of the car and\r\nnot down past the drawing-room as he evidently supposed.\r\n\r\nHe found his man standing in stocking feet on the cold iron platform,\r\nhis head out of the opening left in the vestibuled train, for when the\r\nporter came in he had drawn shut the outer door and slammed down the\r\nmovable platform, making it impossible for anyone to get out. There was\r\nonly the little opening the size of a window above the grating guard,\r\nand the man clung to it as if he would jump over it if he only dared.\r\nHe was looking back over the track and his face was not good to see.\r\n\r\nHe turned wildly upon the porter.\r\n\r\n“I want you to stop this train and let me off,” he shouted. “I’ve lost\r\nsomething valuable back there on the track. Stop the train quick, I\r\ntell you, or I’ll sue the railroad.”\r\n\r\n“What was it you lost?” asked the porter respectfully. He wasn’t sure\r\nbut the man was half asleep yet.\r\n\r\n“It was a--my--why it was a very valuable paper. It means a fortune to\r\nme and several other people and I must go back and get it. Stop the\r\ntrain, I tell you, at once or I’ll jump out.”\r\n\r\n“I can’t stop de train sah, you’ll hev to see de conductah sah, ’bout\r\ndat. But I specks there’s mighty little prospec’ o’ gettin’ dis train\r\nstopped foh it gits to its destinashun sah. We’s one hour a’hind time\r\nnow, sah, an’ he’s gotta make up foh we gits to Buff’lo.”\r\n\r\nThe excited passenger railed and stormed until several sleepers were\r\nawakened and stuck curious sleepy countenances out from the curtains\r\nof their berths, but the porter was obdurate, and would not take any\r\nmeasures to stop the train, nor even call the conductor until the\r\npassenger promised to return quietly to his berth.\r\n\r\nThe thick-set man was not used to obeying but he saw that he was only\r\nhindering himself and finally hurried back to his berth where he\r\nhastily parted the curtains, craning his neck to see back along the\r\ntrack and over the green valley growing smaller and smaller now in\r\nthe distance. He could just make out two moving specks on the white\r\nwinding ribbon of the road. He felt sure he knew the direction they\r\nwere taking. If he only could get off that train he could easily catch\r\nthem, for they would have no idea he was coming, and would take no\r\nprecautions. If he had only wakened a few seconds sooner he would have\r\nbeen following them even now.\r\n\r\nFully ten minutes he argued with the conductor, showing a wide\r\nincongruity between his language and his gentlemanly attire, but the\r\nconductor would do nothing but promise to set him down at a water\r\ntower ten miles ahead where they had to slow up for water. He said sue\r\nor no sue he had his orders, and the thick-set man did not inspire him\r\neither to sympathy or confidence. The conductor had been many years on\r\nthe road and generally knew when to stop his train and when to let it\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\nSullenly the thick-set man accepted the conductor’s decision and\r\nprepared to leave the train at the water tower, his eye out for the\r\nlandmarks along the way as he completed his hasty toilet.\r\n\r\nHe was in no pleasant frame of mind, having missed a goodly amount of\r\nhis accustomed stimulants the night before, and seeing little prospect\r\nof either stimulants or breakfast before him. He was not built for a\r\nten-mile walk over the cinders and his flabby muscles already ached at\r\nthe prospect. But then, of course he would not have to go far before\r\nhe found an automobile or some kind of conveyance to help him on his\r\nway. He looked eagerly from the window for indications of garages or\r\nstables, but the river wound its silver way among the gray green willow\r\nfringes, and the new grass shone a placid emerald plain with nothing\r\nmore human than a few cows grazing here and there. Not even a horse\r\nthat might be borrowed without his owner’s knowledge. It was a strange,\r\nforsaken spot, ten whole miles and no sign of any public livery! Off\r\nto the right and left he could see villages, but they were most of them\r\ntoo far away from the track to help him any. It began to look as if\r\nhe must just foot it all the way. Now and then a small shanty or tiny\r\ndwelling whizzed by near at hand, but nothing that would relieve his\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him to go into the dining-car for breakfast, but even as\r\nhe thought of it the conductor told him that the train would stop in\r\ntwo minutes and he must be ready to get off, for they did not stop long.\r\n\r\nHe certainly looked a harmless creature, that thick-set man as he stood\r\nalone upon the cinder elevation and surveyed the landscape o’er. Ten\r\nmiles from his quarry, alone on a stretch of endless ties and rails\r\nwith a gleaming river mocking him down in the valley, and a laughing\r\nsky jeering overhead. He started down the shining track his temper a\r\nwreck, his mind in chaos, his soul at war with the world. The worst\r\nof it all was that the whole fault was his own for going to sleep. He\r\nbegan to fear that he had lost his chance. Then he set his ugly jaw and\r\nstrode ahead.\r\n\r\nThe morning sun poured down upon the thick-set man on his pilgrimage,\r\nand waxed hotter until noon. Trains whizzed mercilessly by and gave him\r\nno succor. Weary, faint, and fiercely thirsty he came at last to the\r\nspot where he was satisfied his quarry had escaped. He could see the\r\nmarks of their rough descent in the steep cinder bank, and assaying the\r\nsame himself came upon a shred of purple silk caught on a bramble at\r\nthe foot.\r\n\r\nPuffing and panting, bruised and foot-sore, he sat down at the very\r\nplace where Celia had stopped to have her shoes fastened, and mopped\r\nhis purple brow, but there was triumph in his ugly eye, and after a few\r\nmoment’s rest he trudged onward. That town over there ought to yield\r\nboth conveyance and food as well as information concerning those he\r\nsought. He would catch them. They could never get away from him. He was\r\non their track again, though hours behind. He would get them yet and no\r\nman should take his reward from him.\r\n\r\nAlmost spent he came at last to the village, and ate a surprisingly\r\nlarge dish of beef and vegetable stew at the quaint little house where\r\nCelia and Gordon had breakfasted, but the old lady who served it to\r\nthem was shy about talking, and though admitting that a couple of\r\npeople had been there that morning she was non-committal about their\r\nappearance. They might have been young and good-looking and worn\r\nfeathers in their hats, and they might not. She wasn’t one for noticing\r\npeople’s appearance if they treated her civilly and paid their bills.\r\nWould he have another cup of coffee? He would, and also two more\r\npieces of pie, but he got very little further information.\r\n\r\nIt was over at the corner store where he finally went in search\r\nof something stronger than coffee that he further pursued his\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\nThe loungers were still there. It was their only business in life\r\nand they were most diligent in it. They eyed the newcomer with a\r\nrelish and settled back on their various barrels and boxes to enjoy\r\nwhatever entertainment the gods were about to provide to relieve their\r\nmonotonous existence.\r\n\r\nA house divided against itself cannot stand. This man’s elegant\r\ngarments assumed for the nonce did not fit the rest of his general\r\nappearance which had been accentuated by his long, hot, dusty tramp.\r\nThe high evening hat was jammed on the back of his head and bore a\r\ndecided dent where it had rolled down the cinder embankment, his collar\r\nwas wilted and lifeless, his white laundered tie at half mast, his coat\r\nawry, and his fine patent leather shoes which pinched were covered\r\nwith dust and had caused a limp like the hardest tramp upon the road.\r\nMoreover, again the speech of the man betrayed him, and the keen-minded\r\nold gossips who were watching him suspiciously sized him up at once the\r\nminute he opened his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Saw anything of a couple of young folks walking down this way?”\r\nhe enquired casually, pausing to light a cigar with which he was\r\nreinforcing himself for further travel.\r\n\r\nOne man allowed that there might have passed such people that day. He\r\nhardly seemed willing to commit himself, but another vouchsafed the\r\ninformation that “Joe here driv two parties of thet description to\r\nMilton this mornin’--jes’ got back. Mebbe he could answer fer ’em.”\r\n\r\nJoe frowned. He did not like the looks of the thick-set man. He still\r\nremembered the forget-me-not eyes.\r\n\r\nBut the stranger made instant request to be driven to Milton, offering\r\nten dollars for the same when he found that his driver was reluctant,\r\nand that Milton was a railroad centre. A few keen questions had made\r\nhim sure that his man had gone to Milton.\r\n\r\nJoe haggled, allowed his horse was tired, and he didn’t care about the\r\ntrip twice in one day, but finally agreed to take the man for fifteen\r\ndollars, and sauntered off to get a fresh horse. He had no mind to be\r\nin a hurry. He had his own opinion about letting those two “parties”\r\nget out of the way before the third put in an appearance, but he had\r\nno mind to lose the fifteen dollars. It would help to buy the ring he\r\ncoveted for his girl.\r\n\r\nIn due time Joe rode leisurely up and the impatient traveller climbed\r\ninto the high spring wagon and was driven away from the apathetic gaze\r\nof the country loungers, who unblinkingly took in the fact that Joe\r\nwas headed toward Ashville, and evidently intended taking his fare to\r\nMilton by way of that village, a thirty-mile drive at least. The man\r\nwould get the worth of his money in ride. A grim twinkle sat in their\r\nseveral eyes as the spring wagon turned the curve in the road and was\r\nlost to sight, and after due silence an old stager spoke:\r\n\r\n“Do you reckon that there was their sho-fur?” he requested languidly.\r\n\r\n“Naw!” replied a farmer’s son vigorously. “He wouldn’t try to showf all\r\ndolled up like that. He’s the rich dad comin’ after the runaways. Joe\r\ndon’t intend he shell get ’em yet awhile. I reckon the ceremony’ll be\r\nover ’fore he steps in to interfere.” This lad went twice a month to\r\nMilton to the “movies” and was regarded as an authority on matters of\r\nromance. A pause showed that his theory had taken root in the minds of\r\nhis auditors.\r\n\r\n“Wal, I reckon Joe thinks the longest way round is the shortest way\r\nhome,” declared the old stager. “Joe never did like them cod-fish\r\nswells--but how do you ’count fer the style o’ that gal? She wan’t\r\nlike her dad one little bit.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, she’s ben to collidge I ’spose,” declared the youth. “They get all\r\nthat off’n collidge.”\r\n\r\n“Serves the old man right fer sendin’ his gal to a fool collidge when\r\nshe ought to a ben home learnin’ to house-keep. I hope she gits off\r\nwith her young man all right,” said a grim old lounger, and a cackle\r\nof laughter went round the group, which presently broke up, for this\r\nhad been a strenuous day and all felt their need of rest; besides they\r\nwanted to get home and tell the news before some neighbor got ahead of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll this time Celia and Gordon were touring Milton, serenely\r\nunconscious of danger near, or guardian angel of the name of Joe.\r\n\r\nInvestigation disclosed the fact that there was a train for Pittsburgh\r\nabout three in the afternoon. Gordon sent a code telegram to his chief,\r\nassuring him of the safety of the message, and of his own intention\r\nto proceed to Washington as fast as steam could carry him. Then he\r\ntook the girl to a restaurant, where they mounted two high stools, and\r\npartook with an unusually ravenous appetite of nearly everything on the\r\nmenu--corn soup, roast beef, baked trout, stewed tomatoes, cold slaw,\r\ncustard, apple, and mince pies, with a cup of good country coffee and\r\nreal cream--all for twenty-five cents apiece.\r\n\r\nIt was a very merry meal. Celia felt somehow as if for the time all\r\nmemory of the past had been taken from her, and she were free to think\r\nand act happily in the present, without any great problems to solve or\r\ndecisions to make. Just two young people off having a good time, they\r\nwere, at least until that afternoon train came.\r\n\r\nAfter their dinner, they took a short walk to a tiny park where two\r\nwhite ducks disported themselves on a seven-by-nine pond, spanned by a\r\nrustic bridge where lovers had cut their initials. Gordon took out his\r\nknife and idly cut C. H. in the rough bark of the upper rail, while\r\nhis companion sat on the little board seat and watched him. She was\r\npondering over the fact that he had cut her initials, and not his own.\r\nIt would have been like the George of old to cut his own and never once\r\nthink of hers. And he had put but one H. Probably he thought of her now\r\nas Celia Hayne, without the Hathaway, or else he was so used to writing\r\nher name Celia Hathaway, that he was not thinking at all.\r\n\r\nThose letters! How they haunted her and clouded every bright experience\r\nthat she fain would have grasped and held for a little hour.\r\n\r\nThey were silent now, while he worked and she thought. He had finished\r\nthe C. H., and was cutting another C, but instead of making another\r\nH, he carefully carved out the letter G. What was that for? C. G.?\r\nWho was C. G.? Oh, how stupid! George, of course. He had started a C\r\nby mistake. But he did not add the expected H. Instead he snapped his\r\nknife shut, laid his hand over the carving, and leaned over the rail.\r\n\r\n“Some time, perhaps, we’ll come here again, and remember,” he said,\r\nand then bethought him that he had no right to hope for any such\r\nanniversary.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” She looked up into his eyes, startled, troubled, the haunting of\r\nher fears in the shadows of the blue.\r\n\r\nHe looked down into them and read her trouble, read and understood, and\r\nlooked back his great desire to comfort her.\r\n\r\nHis look carried further than he meant it should. For the third time\r\nthat day a thrill of wonder and delight passed over her and left her\r\nfearful with a strange joy that she felt she should put from her.\r\n\r\nIt was only an instant, that look, but it brought the bright color to\r\nboth faces, and made Gordon feel the immediate necessity of changing\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\n“See those little fishes down there,” he said pointing to the tiny lake\r\nbelow them.\r\n\r\nThrough a blur of tears, the girl looked down and saw the tiny,\r\nsharp-finned creatures darting here and there in a beam of sun like a\r\nsmall search-light set to show them off.\r\n\r\nShe moved her hand on the rail to lean further over, and her soft\r\nfingers touched his hand for a moment. She would not draw them away\r\nquickly, lest she hurt him; why, she did not know, but she could\r\nnot--would not--hurt him. Not now! The two hands lay side by side for\r\na full minute, and the touch to Gordon was as if a roseleaf had kissed\r\nhis soul. He had never felt anything sweeter. He longed to gather the\r\nlittle hand into his clasp and feel its pulses trembling there as he\r\nhad felt it in the church the night before, but she was not his. He\r\nmight not touch her till she had her choice of what to do, and she\r\nwould never choose him, never, when she knew how he had deceived her.\r\n\r\nThat one supreme moment they had of perfect consciousness,\r\nconsciousness of the drawing of soul to soul, of the sweetness of that\r\nhovering touch of hands, of the longing to know and understand each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThen a sharp whistle sounded, and a farmer’s boy with a new rake and a\r\nsack of corn on his shoulder came sauntering briskly down the road to\r\nthe bridge. Instantly they drew apart, and Celia felt that she had been\r\non the verge of disloyalty to her true self.\r\n\r\nThey walked silently back to the station, each busy with his own\r\nthoughts, each conscious of that one moment when the other had come so\r\nnear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were a lot of people at the station. They had been to a family\r\ngathering of some sort from their remarks, and they talked loudly and\r\nmuch, so that the two stood apart--for the seats were all occupied--and\r\nhad no opportunity for conversation, save a quiet smiling comment now\r\nand then upon the chatter about them, or the odd remarks they heard.\r\n\r\nThere had come a constraint upon them, a withdrawing of each into his\r\nshell, each conscious of something that separated. Gordon struggled to\r\nprevent it, but he seemed helpless. Celia would smile in answer to his\r\nquiet remarks, but it was a smile of distance, such as she had worn\r\nearly in the morning. She had quite found her former standing ground,\r\nwith its fence of prejudice, and she was repairing the breaks through\r\nwhich she had gone over to the enemy during the day. She was bracing\r\nherself with dire reminders, and snatches from those terrible letters\r\nwhich were written in characters of fire in her heart. Never, never,\r\ncould she care for a man who had done what this man had done. She had\r\nforgotten for a little while those terrible things he had said of her\r\ndear dead father. How could she have forgotten for an instant! How\r\ncould she have let her hand lie close to the hand that had defiled\r\nitself by writing such things!\r\n\r\nBy the time they were seated in the train, she was freezing in her\r\nattitude, and poor Gordon sat miserably beside her and tried to think\r\nwhat he had done to offend her. It was not his fault that her hand\r\nhad lain near his on the rail. She had put it there herself. Perhaps\r\nshe expected him to put his over it, to show her that he cared as a\r\nbridegroom should care--as he did care, in reality, if he only had the\r\nright. And perhaps she was hurt that he had stood coolly and said or\r\ndone nothing. But he could not help it.\r\n\r\nMuch to Gordon’s relief, the train carried a parlor-car, and it\r\nhappened on this particular day to be almost deserted save for a deaf\r\nold man with a florid complexion and a gold knobbed cane who slumbered\r\naudibly at the further end from the two chairs Gordon selected. He\r\nestablished his companion comfortably, disposed of the baggage, and\r\nsat down, but the girl paid no heed to him. With a sad, set face,\r\nshe stared out of the window, her eyes seeming to see nothing. For\r\ntwo hours she sat so, he making remarks occasionally, to which she\r\nmade little or no reply, until he lapsed into silence, looking at her\r\nwith troubled eyes. Finally, just as they neared the outskirts of\r\nPittsburgh, he leaned softly forward and touched her coat-sleeve, to\r\nattract her attention.\r\n\r\n“Have I offended--hurt--you in any way?” he asked gently. She turned\r\ntoward him, and her eyes were brimming full of tears.\r\n\r\n“No,” she said, and her lips were trembling. “No, you have\r\nbeen--most--kind--but--but I cannot forget _those letters_!” She ended\r\nwith a sob and put up her handkerchief quickly to stifle it.\r\n\r\n“Letters?” he asked helplessly. “What letters?”\r\n\r\n“The letters you wrote me. All the letters of the last five months. I\r\ncannot forget them. I can _never_ forget them! How could you _think_ I\r\ncould?”\r\n\r\nHe looked at her anxiously, not knowing what to say, and yet he must\r\nsay something. The time had come when some kind of an understanding,\r\nsome clearing up of facts, must take place. He must go cautiously, but\r\nhe must find out what was the matter. He could not see her suffer so.\r\nThere must be some way to let her know that so far as he was concerned\r\nshe need suffer nothing further and that he would do all in his power\r\nto set her right with her world.\r\n\r\nBut letters! He had written no letters. His face lighted up with the\r\nswift certainty of one thing about which he had not dared to be sure.\r\nShe still thought him the man she had intended to marry. She was not\r\ntherefore troubled about that phase of the question. It was strange,\r\nalmost unbelievable, but it was true that he personally was not\r\nresponsible for the trouble in her eyes. What trouble she might feel\r\nwhen she knew all, he had yet to find out, but it was a great relief to\r\nbe sure of so much. Still, something must be said.\r\n\r\n“Letters!” he repeated again stupidly, and then added with perplexed\r\ntone: “Would you mind telling me just what it was in the letters that\r\nhurt you?”\r\n\r\nShe turned eyes of astonishment on him.\r\n\r\n“How can you ask?” she said almost bitterly. “You surely must know how\r\nterrible they were to me! You could not be the man you have seemed to\r\nbe to-day if you did not know what you were doing to me in making all\r\nthose terrible threats. You must know how cruel they were.”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I don’t understand,” he said earnestly, the trouble\r\nstill most apparent in his eyes, “Would you mind being a little more\r\nexplicit? Would you mind telling me exactly what you think I wrote you\r\nthat sounded like a threat?”\r\n\r\nHe asked the question half hesitatingly, because he was not quite sure\r\nwhether he was justified in thus obtaining private information under\r\nfalse pretenses, and yet he felt that he must know just what troubled\r\nher or he could never help her; and he was sure that if she knew he was\r\nan utter stranger, even a kindly one, those gentle lips would never\r\nopen to inform him upon her torturer. As it was she could tell him her\r\ntrouble with a perfectly clear conscience, thinking she was telling it\r\nto the man who knew all about it. But his hesitation about prying into\r\nan utter stranger’s private affairs even with a good motive, gave him\r\nan air of troubled dignity, and real anxiety to know his fault that\r\npuzzled the girl more than all that had gone before.\r\n\r\n“I cannot understand how you can ask such a question, since it has been\r\nthe constant subject of discussion in all our letters!” she replied,\r\nsitting up with asperity and drying her tears. She was on the verge of\r\ngrowing angry with him for his petty, wilful misunderstanding of words\r\nwhose meaning she felt he must know well.\r\n\r\n“I do ask it,” he said quietly, “and, believe me, I have a good motive\r\nin doing so.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at him in surprise. It was impossible to be angry with those\r\nkindly eyes, even though he did persist in a wilful stupidity.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, since you wish it stated once more I will tell you,” she\r\ndeclared, the tears welling again into her eyes. “You first demanded\r\nthat I marry you--demanded--without any pretense whatever of caring\r\nfor me--with a hidden threat in your demand that if I did not, you\r\nwould bring some dire calamity upon me by means that were already in\r\nyour power. You took me for the same foolish little girl whom you had\r\ndelighted to tease for years before you went abroad to live. And when\r\nI refused you, you told me that you could not only take away from my\r\nmother all the property which she had inherited from her brother, by\r\nmeans of a will made just before my uncle’s death, and unknown except\r\nto his lawyer and you; but that you could and would blacken my dear\r\ndead father’s name and honor, and show that every cent that belonged to\r\nMother and Jefferson and myself was stolen property. When I challenged\r\nyou to prove any such thing against my honored father, you went still\r\nfurther and threatened to bring out a terrible story and prove it with\r\nwitnesses who would swear to anything you said. You knew my father’s\r\nwhite life, you as much as owned your charges were false, and yet you\r\ndared to send me a letter from a vile creature who pretended that she\r\nwas his first wife, and who said she could prove that he had spent much\r\nof his time in her company. You knew the whole thing was a falsehood,\r\nbut you dared to threaten to make this known through the newspapers\r\nif I did not marry you. You realized that I knew that, even though few\r\npeople and no friends would believe such a thing of my father, such a\r\nreport in the papers--false though it was--would crush my mother to\r\ndeath. You knew that I would give my life to save her, and so you had\r\nme in your power, as you have me now. You have always wanted me in your\r\npower, just because you love to torture, and now you have me. But you\r\ncannot make me forget what you have done. I have given my life but I\r\ncannot give any more. If it is not sufficient you will have to do your\r\nworst.”\r\n\r\nShe dropped her face into the little wet handkerchief, and Gordon\r\nsat with white, drawn countenance and clenched hands. He was fairly\r\ntrembling with indignation toward the villain who had thus dared impose\r\nupon this delicate flower of womanhood. He longed to search the world\r\nover for the false bridegroom; and, finding, give him his just dues.\r\n\r\nAnd what should he do or say? Dared he tell her at once who he was and\r\ntrust to her kind heart to forgive his terrible blunder and keep his\r\nsecret till the message was safely delivered? Dared he? Had he any\r\nright? No, the secret was not his to divulge either for his own benefit\r\nor for any other’s. He must keep that to himself. But he must help her\r\nin some way.\r\n\r\nAt last he began to speak, scarcely knowing what he was about to say:\r\n\r\n“It is terrible, _terrible_, what you have told me. To have written\r\nsuch things to one like you--in fact, to anyone on earth--seems to me\r\nunforgivable. It is the most inhuman cruelty I have ever heard of. You\r\nare fully justified in hating and despising the man who wrote such\r\nwords to you.”\r\n\r\n“Then, why did you write them?” she burst forth. “And how can you sit\r\nthere calmly and talk that way about it, as if you had nothing to do\r\nwith the matter?”\r\n\r\n“Because I never wrote those letters,” he said, looking her steadily,\r\nearnestly, in the eyes.\r\n\r\n“You never wrote them!” she exclaimed excitedly. “You dare to deny it?”\r\n\r\n“I dare to deny it.” His voice was quiet, earnest, convincing.\r\n\r\nShe looked at him, dazed, bewildered, indignant, sorrowful. “But you\r\ncannot deny it,” she said, her fragile frame trembling with excitement.\r\n“I have the letters all in my suit-case. You cannot deny your own\r\nhandwriting. I have the last awful one--the one in which you threatened\r\nFather’s good name--here in my hand-bag. I dared not put it with the\r\nrest, and I had no opportunity to destroy it before leaving home. I\r\nfelt as if I must always keep it with me, lest otherwise its awful\r\nsecret would somehow get out. There it is. Read it and see your own\r\nname signed to the words you say you did not write!”\r\n\r\nWhile she talked, her trembling fingers had taken a folded, crumpled\r\nletter from her little hand-bag, and this she reached over and laid\r\nupon the arm of his chair.\r\n\r\n“Read it,” she said. “Read it and see that you cannot deny it.”\r\n\r\n“I should rather not read it,” he said. “I do not need to read it to\r\ndeny that I ever wrote such things to you.”\r\n\r\n“But I insist that you read it,” said the girl.\r\n\r\n“If you insist I will read it,” he said, taking the letter reluctantly\r\nand opening it.\r\n\r\nShe sat watching him furtively through the tears while he read, saw\r\nthe angry flush steal into his cheeks as the villainy of a fellow man\r\nwas revealed to him through the brief, coarse, cruel epistle, and she\r\nmistook the flush for one of shame.\r\n\r\nThen his true brown eyes looked up and met her tearful gaze steadily, a\r\nfine anger burning in them.\r\n\r\n“And you think I wrote that!” he said, a something in his voice she\r\ncould not understand.\r\n\r\n“What else could I think? It bears your signature,” she answered coldly.\r\n\r\n“The letter is vile,” he said, “and the man who wrote it is a\r\nblackguard, and deserves the utmost that the law allows for such\r\noffences. With your permission, I shall make it my business to see that\r\nhe gets it.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” she said, wide-eyed. “How could you punish\r\nyourself? You cannot still deny that you wrote the letter.”\r\n\r\n“I still deny that I wrote it, or ever saw it until you handed it to me\r\njust now.”\r\n\r\nThe girl looked at him, nonplussed, more than half convinced, in spite\r\nof reason.\r\n\r\n“But isn’t that your handwriting?”\r\n\r\n“It is not. Look!”\r\n\r\nHe took out his fountain pen, and, holding the letter on the arm of her\r\nchair, he wrote rapidly in his natural hand her own name and address\r\nbeneath the address on the envelope, then held it up to her.\r\n\r\n“Do they look alike?”\r\n\r\nThe two writings were as utterly unlike as possible, the letter being\r\naddressed in an almost unreadable scrawl, and the fresh writing\r\nstanding fine and clear, in a script that spoke of character and\r\nbusiness ability. Even a child could see at a glance that the two were\r\nnot written by the same hand--and yet of course, it might have been\r\npractised for the purpose of deception. This thought flashed through\r\nthe minds of both even as he held it out for her to look.\r\n\r\nShe looked from the envelope to his eyes and back to the letter,\r\nstartled, not knowing what to think.\r\n\r\nBut before either of them had time for another word the conductor, the\r\nporter, and several people from the car behind came hurriedly through,\r\nand they realized that while they talked the train had come to a halt,\r\namid the blazing electric lights of a great city station.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Gordon, startled, “we must have reached Pittsburgh. Is this\r\nPittsburgh?” he called out to the vanishing porter.\r\n\r\n“Yas sah!” yelled the porter, putting his head around the curve of the\r\npassageway. “You bettah hurry sah, foh dis train goes on to Cincinnati\r\npretty quick. We’s late gittin’ in you see.”\r\n\r\nNeither of them had noticed a man in rough clothes with slouch hat and\r\nhands in his pockets who had boarded the train a few miles back and\r\nwalked through the car several times eyeing them keenly. He stuck his\r\nhead in at the door now furtively and drew back quickly again out of\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nGordon hurriedly gathered up the baggage, and they went out of the car,\r\nthe porter rushing back as they reached the door, to assist them and\r\nget a last tip. There was no opportunity to say anything more, as they\r\nmingled with the crowd, until the porter landed their baggage in the\r\ngreat station and hurried back to his train. The man with the slouch\r\nhat followed and stood unobtrusively behind them.\r\n\r\nGordon looked down at the white, drawn face of the girl, and his heart\r\nwas touched with compassion for her trouble. He must make her some\r\nsatisfactory explanation at once that would set her heart at rest, but\r\nhe could not do it here, for every seat about them was filled with\r\nnoisy chattering folk. He stooped and whispered low and tenderly:\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry, little girl! Just try to trust me, and I will explain it\r\nall.”\r\n\r\n“Can you explain it?” she asked anxiously, as if catching at a rope\r\nthrown out to save her life.\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” he said, “if you will be patient and trust me. But we\r\ncannot talk here. Just wait in this seat until I see if I can get the\r\nstateroom on the sleeper.”\r\n\r\nHe left her with his courteous bow, and she sat watching his tall, fine\r\nfigure as he threaded his way among the crowds to the Pullman window,\r\nher heart filled with mingling emotions. In spite of her reason, a tiny\r\nbit of hope for the future was springing up in her heart and without\r\nher own will she found herself inclined to trust him. At least it was\r\nall she could do at present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nBack at Milton an hour before, when the shades of dusk were falling and\r\na slender moon hung timidly on the edge of the horizon, a horse drawing\r\na spring wagon ambled deliberately into town and came to a reluctant\r\nhalt beside the railroad station, having made a wide détour through the\r\nlarger part of the county on the way to that metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe sun had been hot, the road much of it rough, and the jolts over\r\nstones and bumps had not added to the comfort of the thick-set man,\r\nalready bruised and weary from his travels. Joe’s conversation had not\r\nceased. He had given his guest a wide range of topics, discoursing\r\nlearnedly on the buckwheat crop and the blight that might be expected\r\nto assail the cherry trees. He pointed out certain portions of land\r\ninfested with rattlesnakes, and told blood-curdling stories of\r\nexperiences with stray bears and wild cats in a maple grove through\r\nwhich they passed till the passenger looked furtively behind him and\r\nurged the driver to hurry a little faster.\r\n\r\nJoe, seeing his gullibility, only made his stories of country life the\r\nbigger, for the thick-set man, though bold as a lion in his own city\r\nhaunts, was a coward in the unknown world of the country.\r\n\r\nWhen the traveler looking at his watch urged Joe to make haste and\r\nasked how many miles further Milton was, Joe managed it that the horse\r\nshould stumble on a particularly stony bit of road. Then getting down\r\ngravely from the wagon he examined the horse’s feet each in turn,\r\nshaking his head sadly over the left fore foot.\r\n\r\n“Jes’ ’z I ’sposed,” he meditated dreamily. “Stone bruise! Lame horse!\r\nDon’t believe I ought to go on. Sorry, but it’ll be the ruination of\r\nthe horse. You ain’t in a hurry I hope.”\r\n\r\nThe passenger in great excitement promised to double the fare if the\r\nyoung man would get another horse and hurry him forward, and after\r\ngreat professions of doubt Joe gave in and said he would try the horse,\r\nbut it wouldn’t do to work him hard. They would have to let him take\r\nhis time. He couldn’t on any account leave the horse behind anywhere\r\nand get a fresh one because it belonged to his best friend and he\r\npromised to bring it back safe and sound. They would just take their\r\ntime and go slow and see if the horse could stand it. He wouldn’t think\r\nof trying it if it weren’t for the extra money which he needed.\r\n\r\nSo the impatient traveler was dragged fuming along weary hour after\r\nweary hour through the monotonous glory of a spring afternoon of\r\nwhich he saw nothing but the dust of the road as he tried to count\r\nthe endless miles. Every mile or two Joe would descend from the wagon\r\nseat and fuss around the horse’s leg, the horse nothing loth at such\r\nunprecedented attention dozing cozily by the roadside during the\r\nprocess. And so was the traveler brought to his destination ten minutes\r\nafter the last train that stopped at Milton that night had passed the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph office was not closed however, and without waiting to\r\nhaggle, the passenger paid his thirty dollars for the longest journey\r\nhe ever took, and disappeared into the station, while Joe, whipping up\r\nhis petted animal, and whistling cheerily:\r\n\r\n  “Where did you get that girl--?”\r\n\r\nwent rattling down the short cut from Milton home at a surprising pace\r\nfor a lame horse. He was eating his supper at home in a little more\r\nthan an hour, and the horse seemed to have miraculously recovered from\r\nhis stone bruise. Joe was wondering how his girl would look in a hat\r\nwith purple plumes, and thinking of his thirty dollars with a chuckle.\r\n\r\nIt was surprising how much that thick-set man, weary and desperate\r\nthough he was, could accomplish, when once he reached the telegraph\r\nstation and sent his messages flying on their way. In less than three\r\nminutes after his arrival he had extracted from the station agent the\r\nfact that two people, man and woman, answering the description he gave,\r\nhad bought tickets for Pittsburgh and taken the afternoon train for\r\nthat city. The agent had noticed them on account of their looking as\r\nif they came from the city. He especially noticed the purple plumes,\r\nthe like of which he had never seen before. He had taken every minute\r\nhe could get off from selling tickets and sending telegrams to watch\r\nthe lady through his little cobwebby window. They didn’t wear hats like\r\nthat in Milton.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes one message was on its way to a crony in Pittsburgh with\r\nwhom the thick-set man kept in constant touch for just such occasions\r\nas the present, stirring him to strenuous action; another message had\r\nwinged its mysterious way to Mr. Holman, giving him the main facts\r\nin the case; while a third message caught another crony thirty miles\r\nnorth of Pittsburgh and ordered him to board the evening express at his\r\nown station, hunt up the parties described, and shadow them to their\r\ndestination, if possible getting in touch with the Pittsburgh crony\r\nwhen he reached the city.\r\n\r\nThe pursuer then ate a ham sandwich with liberal washings of liquid\r\nfire while he awaited replies to some of his messages; and as soon\r\nas he was satisfied that he had set justice in motion he hired an\r\nautomobile and hied him across country to catch a midnight express to\r\nPittsburgh. He had given orders that his man and accompanying lady\r\nshould be held in Pittsburgh until his arrival, and he had no doubt but\r\nthat the orders would be carried out, so sure was he that he was on the\r\nright track, and that his cronies would be able and willing to follow\r\nhis orders.\r\n\r\nThere was some kind of an excursion on at Pittsburgh, and the place was\r\ncrowded. The trainmen kept calling off specials, and crowds hurried out\r\nof the waiting room, only to be replaced by other crowds, all eager,\r\npushing, talking, laughing. They were mostly men, but a good many\r\nwomen and some children seemed to be of the number; and the noise and\r\nexcitement worried her after her own exciting afternoon. Celia longed\r\nto lay her down and sleep, but the seat was narrow, and hard, and\r\npeople were pressing on every side. That disagreeable man in the slouch\r\nhat would stand too near. He was most repulsive looking, though he did\r\nnot seem to be aware of her presence.\r\n\r\nGordon had a long wait before he finally secured the coveted stateroom\r\nand started back to her, when suddenly a face that he knew loomed up\r\nin the crowd and startled him. It was the face of a private detective\r\nwho was well known about Washington, but whose headquarters were in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nUntil that instant, it had not occurred to him to fear watchers so\r\nfar south and west as Pittsburgh. It was not possible that the other\r\nbridegroom would think to track him here, and, as for the Holman\r\ncontingent, they would not be likely to make a public disturbance about\r\nhis disappearance, lest they be found to have some connection with\r\nthe first theft of government property. They could have watchers only\r\nthrough private means, and they must have been wily indeed if they had\r\nanticipated his move through Pittsburgh to Washington. Still, it was\r\nthe natural move for him to make in order to get home as quickly as\r\npossible and yet escape them. And this man in the crowd was the very\r\none whom they would have been likely to pick out for their work. He was\r\nas slippery in his dealings as they must be, and no doubt was in league\r\nwith them. He knew the man and his ways thoroughly, and had no mind to\r\nfall into his hands.\r\n\r\nWhether he had been seen by the detective yet or not, he could not\r\ntell, but he suspected he had, by the way the man stood around and\r\navoided recognizing him. There was not an instant to be lost. The fine\r\nstateroom must go untenanted. He must make a dash for liberty. Liberty!\r\nAh, East Liberty! what queer things these brains of ours are! He knew\r\nPittsburgh just a little. He remembered having caught a train at East\r\nLiberty Station once when he had not time to come down to the station\r\nto take it. Perhaps he might get the same train at East Liberty. It was\r\nnearly two hours before it left.\r\n\r\nSwooping down upon the baggage, he murmured in the girl’s ear:\r\n\r\n“Can you hurry a little? We must catch a car right away.”\r\n\r\nShe followed him closely through the crowd, he stooping as if to\r\nlook down at his suit-case, so that his height might not attract the\r\nattention of the man whose recognition he feared, and in a moment more\r\nthey were out in the lighted blackness of the streets. One glance\r\nbackward showed his supposed enemy stretching his neck above the\r\ncrowd, as if searching for some one, as he walked hurriedly toward\r\nthe very doorway they had just passed. Behind them shadowed the man\r\nin the slouch hat, and with a curious motion of his hand signalled\r\nanother like himself, the Pittsburgh crony, who skulked in the darkness\r\noutside. Instantly this man gave another signal and out of the gloom of\r\nthe street a carriage drew up at the curb before the door, the cabman\r\nlooking eagerly for patronage.\r\n\r\nGordon put both suit-cases in one hand and taking Celia’s arm as gently\r\nas he could in his haste hurried her toward the carriage. It was the\r\nvery refuge he sought. He placed her inside and gave the order for\r\nEast Liberty Station, drawing a long breath of relief at being safely\r\nout of the station. He did not see the shabby one who mounted the box\r\nbeside the driver and gave his directions in guttural whispers, nor the\r\nman with the slouch hat who watched from the doorway and followed them\r\nto a familiar haunt on the nearest car. He only felt how good it was\r\nto be by themselves once more where they could talk together without\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nBut conversation was not easy under the circumstances. The noise of\r\nwagons, trains and cars was so great at the station that they could\r\nthink of nothing but the din, and when they had threaded their way out\r\nof the tangle and started rattling over the pavement the driver went\r\nat such a furious pace that they could still only converse by shouting\r\nand that not at all satisfactorily. It seemed a strange thing that any\r\ncabman should drive at such a rapid rate within the city limits, but\r\nas Gordon was anxious to get away from the station and the keen-eyed\r\ndetective as fast as possible he thought nothing of it at first.\r\nAfter a shouted word or two they ceased to try to talk, and Gordon,\r\nhalf shyly, reached out a reassuring hand and laid it on the girl’s\r\nshrinking one that lay in her lap. He had not meant to keep it there\r\nbut a second, just to make her understand that all was well, and he\r\nwould soon be able to explain things, but as she did not seem to resent\r\nit, nor draw her own away, he yielded to the temptation and kept the\r\nsmall gloved hand in his.\r\n\r\nThe carriage rattled on, bumpety-bump, over rough places, around\r\ncorners, tilting now and then sideways, and Celia, half-frightened, was\r\nforced to cling to her protector to keep from being thrown on the floor\r\nof the cab.\r\n\r\n“Oh, are we running away?” she breathed awesomely into his ear.\r\n\r\n“I think not,--dear,” he answered back, the last word inaudible. “The\r\ndriver thinks we are in a hurry but he has no need to go at this\r\nfurious pace. I will tell him.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward and tapped on the glass, but the driver paid no\r\nattention whatever save perhaps to drive faster. Could it be that he\r\nhad lost control of his horse and could not stop, or hadn’t he heard?\r\nGordon tried again, and accompanied the knocking this time with a\r\nshout, but all to no purpose. The cab rattled steadily on. Gordon\r\ndiscovered now that there were two men on the box instead of one, and a\r\nsudden premonition sent a thrill of alarm through him. What if after\r\nall the presence of that detective had been a warning, and he unheeding\r\nhad walked into a trap? What a fool he had been to get into a carriage\r\nwhere he was at the mercy of the driver. He ought to have stayed in\r\nopen places where kidnapping would be impossible. Now that he had\r\nthought of it he felt convinced that this was just what the enemy would\r\ntry to do,--kidnap him. The more fruitless he found his efforts to\r\nmake the driver hear him the more he felt convinced that something was\r\nwrong. He tried to open the door next him and found it stuck. He put\r\nall his strength forth to turn the catch but it held fast. Then a cold\r\nsweat stood out upon him and horror filled his mind. His commission\r\nwith its large significance to the country was in imminent jeopardy.\r\nHis own life was in all probability hanging in the balance, but most\r\nof all he felt the awful peril of the sweet girl by his side. What\r\nterrible experiences might be hers within the next hour if his brain\r\nand right arm could not protect her. Instinctively his hand went to\r\nthe pocket where he had kept his revolver ready since ever he had left\r\nWashington. Danger should not find him utterly unprepared.\r\n\r\nHe realized, too, that it was entirely possible, that his alarms were\r\nunfounded; that the driver was really taking them to the East Liberty\r\nstation; that the door merely stuck, and he was needlessly anxious.\r\nHe must keep a steady head and not let his companion see that he was\r\nnervous. The first thing was to find out if possible where they really\r\nwere, but that was a difficult task. The street over which they rattled\r\nwas utterly dark with the gloom of a smoky city added to the night.\r\nThere were no street lights except at wide intervals, and the buildings\r\nappeared to be blank walls of darkness, probably great warehouses. The\r\nway was narrow, and entirely unknown. Gordon could not tell if he had\r\never been there before. He was sure from his knowledge of the stations\r\nthat they had gone much farther than to East Liberty, and the darkness\r\nand loneliness of the region through which they were passing filled\r\nhim again with a vague alarm. It occurred to him that he might be able\r\nto get the window sash down and speak to the driver, and he struggled\r\nwith the one on his own side for a while, with little result, for it\r\nseemed to have been plugged up with wads of paper all around. This fact\r\nrenewed his anxiety. It began to look as if there was intention in\r\nsealing up that carriage. He leaned over and felt around the sash of\r\nthe opposite door and found the paper wads there also. There certainly\r\nwas intention. Not to alarm Celia he straightened back and went to\r\nwork again at his own window sash cautiously pulling out the paper\r\nuntil at last he could let down the glass.\r\n\r\nA rush of dank air rewarded his efforts, and the girl drew a breath of\r\nrelief. Gordon never knew how near she had been to fainting at that\r\nmoment. She was sitting perfectly quiet in her corner watching him, her\r\nfears kept to herself, though her heart was beating wildly. She was\r\nconvinced that the horse was running away.\r\n\r\nGordon leaned his head out of the window, but immediately he caught the\r\ngleam of a revolver in a hand that hung at the side of the driver’s\r\nbox, pointed downward straight toward his face as if with intention to\r\nbe ready in case of need. The owner of the hand was not looking toward\r\nhim, but was talking in muffled tones to the driver. They evidently had\r\nnot heard the window let down, but were ready for the first sign of an\r\nattempt on the part of their victims to escape.\r\n\r\nQuietly Gordon drew in his head speculating rapidly on the possibility\r\nof wrenching that revolver out of its owner’s hand. He could do it from\r\nwhere he sat, but would it be wise? They were probably locked in a\r\ntrap, and the driver was very likely armed also. What chance would he\r\nhave to save Celia if he brought on a desperate fight at this point? If\r\nhe were alone he might knock that revolver out of the man’s hand and\r\nspring from the window, taking his chance of getting away, but now he\r\nhad Celia to think of and the case was different. Not for a universe of\r\ngovernments could he leave a woman in such desperate straits. She must\r\nbe considered first even ahead of the message. This was life and death.\r\n\r\nHe wondered at his own coolness as he sat back in the carriage and\r\nquietly lifted the glass frame back into place. Then he laid a steady\r\nhand on Celia’s again and stooping close whispered into her ear:\r\n\r\n“I am afraid there’s something wrong with our driver. Can you be a\r\nlittle brave,--dear?” He did not know he had used the last word this\r\ntime, but it thrilled into the girl’s heart with a sudden accession of\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” she breathed close to his face. “You don’t think he has been\r\ndrinking, do you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps,” said Gordon relieved at the explanation. “But keep\r\ncalm. I think we can get out of this all right. Suppose you change\r\nseats with me and let me try if that door will open easily. We might\r\nwant to get out in a hurry in case he slows up somewhere pretty soon.”\r\n\r\nCelia quietly and swiftly slipped into Gordon’s seat and he applied\r\nhimself with all his strength and ingenuity gently manipulating the\r\nlatch and pressing his shoulder against the door, until at last to\r\nhis joy it gave way reluctantly and he found that it would swing open.\r\nHe had worked carefully, else the sudden giving of the latch would\r\nhave thrown him out of the carriage and given instant alarm to his\r\ndriver. He was so thoroughly convinced by this time that he was being\r\nkidnapped, perhaps to be murdered, that every sense was on the alert.\r\nIt was his characteristic to be exceedingly cool during a crisis. It\r\nwas the quality that the keen-eyed chief had valued most in him, and\r\nthe final reason why he had been selected for this difficult task in\r\nplace of an older and more experienced man who at times lost his head.\r\n\r\nThe door to the outside world being open Gordon cautiously took a\r\nsurvey of the enemy from that side. There was no gleaming weapon here.\r\nThe man set grimly enough, laying on the whip and muttering curses\r\nto his bony horse who galloped recklessly on as if partaking of the\r\ndesperate desires of his master. In the distance Gordon could hear the\r\nrumbling of an oncoming train. The street was still dark and scarcely\r\na vehicle or person to be seen. There seemed no help at hand, and no\r\nopportunity to get out, for they were still rushing at a tremendous\r\npace. An attempt to jump now would very likely result in broken limbs,\r\nwhich would only leave them in a worse plight than they were. He\r\nslipped back to his own seat and put Celia next to the free door again.\r\nShe must be where she could get out first if the opportunity presented\r\nitself. Also, he must manage to throw out the suit-cases if possible on\r\naccount of the letters and valuables they contained.\r\n\r\nInstinctively his hand sought Celia’s in the darkness again, and hers\r\nnestled into it in a frightened way as if his strength gave her comfort.\r\n\r\nThen, before they could speak or realize, there came the rushing sound\r\nof a train almost upon them and the cab came to a halt with a jerk,\r\nthe driver pulling the horse far back on his haunches to stop him.\r\nThe shock almost threw Celia to the floor, but Gordon’s arm about her\r\nsteadied her, and instantly he was on the alert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nGlancing through the window he saw that they were in front of a\r\nrailroad track upon which a long freight train was rushing madly along\r\nat a giddy pace for a mere freight. The driver had evidently hoped to\r\npass this point before the train got there, but had failed. The train\r\nhad an exultant sound as if it knew and had outwitted the driver.\r\n\r\nOn one side of the street were high buildings and on the other a great\r\nlumber yard, between which and their carriage there stood a team of\r\nhorses hitched to a covered wagon, from the back of which some boards\r\nprotruded, and this was on the side next to Celia where the door would\r\nopen! Gordon’s heart leaped up with hope and wonder over the miracle\r\nof their opportunity. The best thing about their situation was that\r\ntheir driver had stopped just a little back of the covered wagon, so\r\nthat their door would open to the street directly behind the covered\r\nwagon. It made it possible for the carriage door to swing wide and for\r\nthem to slip across behind the wagon without getting too near to the\r\ndriver. Nothing could have been better arranged for their escape and\r\nthe clatter of the empty freight cars drowned all sounds.\r\n\r\nWithout delay Gordon softly unlatched the door and swung it open\r\nwhispering to Celia:\r\n\r\n“Go! Quick! Over there by the fence in the shadow. Don’t look around\r\nnor speak! Quick! I’ll come!”\r\n\r\nTrembling in every limb yet with brave starry eyes Celia slipped like\r\na wraith from the carriage, stole behind the boards and melted into\r\nthe shadow of the great fence of the lumber yard, her purple plumes\r\nmere depths of shadow against the smoky planks. Gordon, grasping the\r\nsuit-cases, moved instantly after her, deftly and silently closing\r\nthe carriage door and dropping into the shadows behind the big wagon,\r\nscarcely able to believe as yet that they had really escaped.\r\n\r\nTen feet back along the sidewalk was a gateway, the posts being tall\r\nand thick. The gate itself was closed but it hung a few inches inside\r\nthe line of the fence, and into this depression the two stepped softly\r\nand stood, flattening themselves back against the gate as closely as\r\npossible, scarcely daring to breathe, while the long freight clattered\r\nand rambled its way by like a lot of jolly washerwomen running and\r\nlaughing in a line and spatting their tired noisy feet as they went;\r\nthen the vehicles impatiently took up their onward course. Gordon\r\nsaw the driver look down at the window below him and glance back\r\nhastily over his shoulder, and the man on the other side of the box,\r\nlooked down on his side. The glitter of something in his hand shone\r\nfor an instant in the glare of the signal light over the track. Then\r\nthe horse lurched forward and the cab began its crazy gait over the\r\ntrack and up the cobbled street. They had started onward without\r\ngetting down to look in the carriage and see if all were safe with\r\ntheir prisoners, and they had not even looked back to see if they had\r\nescaped. They evidently trusted in the means they had used to lock\r\nthe carriage doors, and had heard no sounds of their escaping. It was\r\nincredible, but it was true. Gordon drew a long breath of relief and\r\nrelaxed from his strained position. The next thing was to get out of\r\nthat neighborhood as swiftly as possible before those men had time to\r\ndiscover that their birds had flown. They would of course know at once\r\nwhere their departure had taken place and come back swiftly to search\r\nfor them, with perhaps more men to help; and a second time escape would\r\nbe impossible.\r\n\r\nGordon snatched up the suit-cases with one hand, and with the other\r\ndrew Celia’s arm within his.\r\n\r\n“Now, we must hurry with all our might,” he said softly. “Are you all\r\nright?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Her breath was coming in a sob, but her eyes were shining\r\nbravely.\r\n\r\n“Poor child!” his voice was very tender. “Were you much frightened?”\r\n\r\n“A little,” she answered more bravely now.\r\n\r\n“I shall have hard work to forgive myself for all this,” he said\r\ntenderly. “But we mustn’t talk. We have to get out of this quickly or\r\nthey may come back after us. Lean on me and walk as fast as you can.”\r\n\r\nCelia bent her efforts to take long springing strides, and together\r\nthey fairly skimmed the pavements, turning first this corner, then\r\nthat, in the general direction from which Gordon thought they had\r\ncome, until at last, three blocks away they caught the welcome whirr\r\nof a trolley, and breathless, flew onward, just catching a car. They\r\ncared not where it went so that they were safe in a bright light with\r\nother people. No diamonds on any gentleman’s neckscarf ever shone to\r\nCelia’s eyes with so friendly a welcome as the dull brass buttons on\r\nthat trolley conductor’s coat as he rang up their fares and answered\r\nGordon’s questions about how to get to East Liberty station; and their\r\npleasant homely gleam almost were her undoing, for now that they were\r\nsafe at last the tears would come to her eyes.\r\n\r\nGordon watched her lovingly, tenderly, glad that she did not know how\r\nterrible had been her danger. His heart was still beating wildly\r\nwith the thought of their marvellous escape, and his own present\r\nresponsibility. He must run no further risks. They would keep to\r\ncrowded trolleys, and trust to hiding in the open. The main thing was\r\nto get out of the city on the first train they could manage to board.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached East Liberty station a long train was just coming in,\r\nall sleepers, and they could hear the echo of a stentorian voice:\r\n\r\n“Special for Harrisburg, Baltimore and Washington! All aboard!” and\r\nup at the further end of the platform Gordon saw the lank form of\r\nthe detective whom he had tried to avoid an hour before at the other\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nWithout taking time for thought he hurried Celia forward and they\r\nsprang breathlessly aboard. Not until they were fairly in the cars and\r\nthe wheels moving under them did it occur to him that his companion had\r\nhad nothing to eat since about twelve o’clock. She must be famished,\r\nand in a fair way to be ill again. What a fool he was not to have\r\nthought! They could have stopped in some obscure restaurant along the\r\nway as well as not, and taken a later train, and yet it was safer to\r\nget away at once. Without doubt there were watchers at East Liberty,\r\ntoo, and he was lucky to have got on the train without a challenge. He\r\nwas sure that detective’s face lighted strangely as he looked his way.\r\nPerhaps there was a buffet attached to the train. At least, he would\r\ninvestigate. If there wasn’t, they must get off at the next stop--there\r\nmust be another stop surely somewhere near the city--he could not\r\nremember, but there surely must be.\r\n\r\nThey had to wait some time to get the attention of the conductor. He\r\nwas having much trouble with some disgruntled passengers who each\r\nclaimed to have the same berth. Gordon finally got his ear, and showing\r\nhis stateroom tickets inquired if they could be used on this train.\r\n\r\n“No,” growled the worried conductor. “You’re on the wrong train. This\r\nis a special, and every berth in the train is taken now but one upper.”\r\n\r\n“Then, we’ll have to get off at the next stop, I suppose, and take the\r\nother train,” said Gordon dismally.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t any other stop till somewhere in the middle of the night.\r\nI tell you this is a special, and we’re scheduled to go straight\r\nthrough. East Liberty’s the last stop.”\r\n\r\n“Then what shall we do?” asked Gordon inanely.\r\n\r\n“I’m sure I don’t know,” snapped the conductor. “I’ve enough to do\r\nwithout mending other people’s mistakes. Stay aboard, I suppose,\r\nunless you want to jump off and commit suicide.”\r\n\r\n“But I have a lady with me who isn’t at all well,” said Gordon, with\r\ndignity.\r\n\r\n“So much the worse for the lady,” replied the conductor inhumanly.\r\n“There’s one upper berth, I told you.”\r\n\r\n“An upper berth wouldn’t do for her,” said Gordon decidedly. “She isn’t\r\nwell, I tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Suit yourself!” snapped the harassed official. “I reckon it’s better\r\nthan nothing. You may not have it long. I’m likely to be asked for it\r\nthe next half minute.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so? And is there absolutely nothing else?”\r\n\r\n“Young man, I can’t waste words on you. I haven’t time. Take it or let\r\nit alone. It’s all one to me. There’s some standing room left in the\r\nday-coach, perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll take it,” said Gordon meekly, wishing he could go back and undo\r\nthe last half-hour. How in the world was he to go and tell Celia that\r\nhe could provide her nothing better than an upper berth?\r\n\r\nShe was sitting with her back to him, her face resting wearily on her\r\nhand against the window. Two men with largely checked suits, big seal\r\nrings, and diamond scarf-pins sat in the opposite seat. He knew it\r\nwas most unpleasant for her. A nondescript woman with a very large hat\r\nand thick powder on her face shared Celia’s seat. He reflected that\r\n“specials” did not always bear a select company.\r\n\r\n“Is there nothing you can do?” he pleaded with the conductor, as he\r\ntook the bit of pasteboard entitling him to the last vacant berth.\r\n“Don’t you suppose you could get some man to change and give her a\r\nlower berth? It’ll be very hard for her. She isn’t used to upper\r\nberths.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes rested wistfully on the bowed head. Celia had taken off her\r\nplumed hat, and the fitful light of the car played with the gold of her\r\nhair. The conductor’s grim eye softened as he looked.\r\n\r\n“That the lady? I’ll see what I can do,” he said briefly, and stumped\r\noff to the next car. The miracle of her presence had worked its change\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nGordon went over to Celia and told her in a low tone that he hoped to\r\nhave arrangements made for her soon, so that she could be comfortable.\r\nShe must be fearfully tired with the excitement and fright and hurry.\r\nHe added that he had made a great blunder in getting on this train,\r\nand now there was no chance to get off for several hours, perhaps, and\r\nprobably no supper to be had.\r\n\r\n“Oh, it doesn’t matter in the least,” said Celia wearily. “I’m not at\r\nall hungry.” She almost smiled when she said it. He knew that what she\r\nwanted was to have her mind relieved about the letters. But she readily\r\nsaw that there was no opportunity now.\r\n\r\nShe even seemed sorry at his troubled look, and tried to smile again\r\nthrough the settled sadness in her eyes. He could see she was very\r\nweary, and he felt like a great brute in care of a child, and mentally\r\nberated himself for his own thoughtlessness.\r\n\r\nGordon started off to search for something to eat for her, and was\r\nmore successful than he had dared hope. The newsboy had two chicken\r\nsandwiches left, and these, with the addition of a fine orange, a box\r\nof chocolates, and a glass of ice-water, he presently brought to her,\r\nand was rewarded by a smile this time, almost as warm and intimate as\r\nthose she had given him during their beautiful day.\r\n\r\nBut he could not sit beside her, for the places were all taken, and he\r\ncould not stand in the aisle and talk, for the porter was constantly\r\nrunning back and forth making up the berths. There seemed to be a\r\ncongested state of things in the whole train, every seat being full and\r\nmen standing in the aisles. He noticed now that they all wore badges\r\nof some fraternal order. It was doubtless a delegation to some great\r\nconvention, upon which they had intruded. They were a good-natured,\r\nnoisy, happy crowd, but not anywhere among them was to be found\r\na quiet spot where he and Celia could go on with their suddenly\r\ninterrupted conversation. Presently the conductor came to him and said\r\nhe had found a gentleman who would give the lady his lower berth and\r\ntake her upper one. It was already made up, and the lady might take\r\npossession at once.\r\n\r\nGordon made the exchange of tickets, and immediately escorted Celia to\r\nit. He found her most glad to go for she was now unutterably weary, and\r\nwas longing to get away from the light and noise about her.\r\n\r\nHe led the way with the suit-cases, hoping that in the other car there\r\nwould be some spot where they could talk for a few minutes. But he was\r\ndisappointed. It was even fuller than in the first car. He arranged\r\neverything for her comfort as far as possible, disposed of her hat and\r\nfixed her suit-case so that she could open it, but even while he was\r\ndoing it there were people crowding by, and no private conversation\r\ncould be had. He stepped back when all was arranged and held the\r\ncurtain aside that she might sit on the edge of her berth. Then\r\nstooping over he whispered:\r\n\r\n“Try to trust me until morning. I’ll explain it all to you then, so\r\nthat you will understand how I have had nothing to do with those\r\nletters. Forget it, and try to rest. Will you?”\r\n\r\nHis tone was wistful. He had never wanted to do anything so much in all\r\nhis life as to stoop and kiss those sweet lips, and the lovely eyes\r\nthat looked up at him out of the dusky shadows of the berth, filled\r\nwith fear and longing. They looked more than ever like the blue tired\r\nflowers that drooped from her gown wearily. But he held himself with a\r\nfirm hand. She was not his to kiss. When she knew how he had deceived\r\nher, she would probably never give him the right to kiss her.\r\n\r\n“I will try,” she murmured in answer to his question, and then added:\r\n“But where will you be? Is your berth nearby?”\r\n\r\n“Not far away--that is, I had to take a place in another car, they are\r\nso crowded.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said a little anxiously. “Are you sure you have a good\r\ncomfortable place?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes, I shall be all right,” he answered joyously. It was so\r\nwonderful to have her care whether he was comfortable or not.\r\n\r\nThe porter was making up the opposite berth, and there was no room to\r\nstand longer, so he bade her good night, she putting out her hand for a\r\nfarewell. For an instant he held it close, with gentle pressure, as if\r\nto reassure her, then he went away to the day-coach, and settled down\r\ninto a hard corner at the very back of the car, drawing his travelling\r\ncap over his eyes, and letting his heart beat out wild joy over that\r\nlittle touch of her dear hand. Wave after wave of sweetness went over\r\nhim, thrilling his very soul with a joy he had never known before.\r\n\r\nAnd this was love! And what kind of a wretch was he, presuming to love\r\nlike this a woman who was the promised bride of another man! Ah, but\r\nsuch a man! A villain! A brute, who had used his power over her to make\r\nher suffer tortures! Had a man like that a right to claim her? His\r\nwhole being answered “no.”\r\n\r\nThen the memory of the look in her eyes, the turn of her head, the\r\nsoft touch of her fingers as they lay for that instant in his, the\r\ninflection of her voice, would send that wave of sweetness over his\r\nsenses, his heart would thrill anew, and he would forget the wretch who\r\nstood between him and this lovely girl whom he knew now he loved as he\r\nhad never dreamed a man could love.\r\n\r\nGradually his mind steadied itself under the sweet intoxication, and he\r\nbegan to wonder just what he should say to her in the morning. It was\r\na good thing he had not had further opportunity to talk with her that\r\nnight, for he could not have told her everything; and now if all went\r\nwell they would be in Washington in the morning, and he might make some\r\nexcuse till after he had delivered his message. Then he would be free\r\nto tell the whole story, and lay his case before her for decision. His\r\nheart throbbed with ecstasy as he thought of the possibility of her\r\nforgiving him, and yet it seemed most unlikely. Sometimes he would let\r\nhis wild longings fancy for just an instant what joy it would be if she\r\ncould be induced to let the marriage stand. But he told himself at the\r\nsame time that that could never be. It was very likely that there was\r\nsome one else in New York to whom her heart would turn if she were free\r\nfrom the scoundrel who had threatened her into a compulsory marriage.\r\nHe would promise to help her, protect her, defend her from the man\r\nwho was evidently using blackmail to get her into his power for some\r\npurpose; most likely for the sake of having control of her property.\r\nAt least it would be some comfort to be able to help her out of her\r\ntrouble. And yet, would she ever trust a man who had even unwittingly\r\nallowed her to be bound by the sacred tie of marriage to an utter\r\nstranger?\r\n\r\nAnd thus, amid hope and fear, the night whirled itself away. Forward\r\nin the sleeper the girl lay wide awake for a long time. In the middle\r\nof the night a thought suddenly evolved itself out of the blackness\r\nof her curtained couch. She sat upright alertly and stared into the\r\ndarkness, as if it were a thing that she could catch and handle and\r\nexamine. The thought was born out of a dreamy vision of the crisp\r\nbrown waves, almost curls if they had not been so short and thick,\r\nthat covered the head of the man who had lain sleeping outside her\r\ncurtains in the early morning. It came to her with sudden force that\r\nnot so had been the hair of the boy George Hayne, who used to trouble\r\nher girlish days. His was thin and black and oily, collecting naturally\r\ninto little isolated strings with the least warmth, and giving him the\r\nappearance of a kitten who had been out in the rain. One lock, how well\r\nshe remembered that lock!--one lock on the very crown of his head had\r\nalways refused to lie down, no matter how much persuasion was brought\r\nto bear upon it. It had been the one point on which the self-satisfied\r\nGeorge had been pregnable, his hair, that scalp lock that would always\r\narise stiffly, oilily, from the top of his head. The hair she had\r\nlooked at admiringly that morning in the dawning crimson of the rising\r\nsun had not been that way. It had curved clingingly to the shape of the\r\nfine head as if it loved to go that way. It was beautiful and fine and\r\nburnished with a sense of life and vigor in its every wave. Could hair\r\nchange in ten years? Could it grow brown where it had been black? Could\r\nit become glossy instead of dull and oily? Could it take on the signs\r\nof natural wave where it had been as straight as a die? Could it grow\r\nlike fur where it had been so thin?\r\n\r\nThe girl could not solve the problem, but the thought was most\r\nstartling and brought with it many suggestive possibilities that were\r\nmost disturbing. Yet gradually out of the darkness she drew a sort of\r\ncomfort in her dawning enlightenment. Two things she had to go on in\r\nher strange premises, he had said he did not write the letters, and his\r\nhair was not the same. Who then was he? Her husband now undoubtedly,\r\nbut who? And if deeds and hair could change so materially, why not\r\nspirits? At least he was not the same as she had feared and dreaded.\r\nThere was so much comfort.\r\n\r\nAnd at last she lay down and slept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were late coming into Washington, for the Special had been\r\nsidetracked in the night for several express trains, and the noisy\r\ncrowd who had kept one another awake till after midnight made up by\r\nsleeping far into the morning.\r\n\r\nThree times did Gordon make the journey three cars front to see if his\r\ncompanion of yesterday were awake and needed anything, but each time\r\nfound the curtains drawn and still, and each time he went slowly back\r\nagain to his seat in the crowded day-coach.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the white dome of the capitol, and the tall needle\r\nof the monument, were painted soft and vision-like against the sky,\r\nreminding one of the pictures of the heavenly city in the story of\r\nPilgrim’s Progress, and faintly suggesting a new and visionary world,\r\nthat he sought her again, and found her fully ready, standing in the\r\naisle while the porter put up the berth out of the way. Beneath the\r\ngreat brim of her purple hat, where the soft fronds of her plumes\r\ntrembled with the motion of the train, she lifted sweet eyes to him, as\r\nif she were both glad and frightened to see him. And then that ecstasy\r\nshot through him again, as he realized suddenly what it would be to\r\nhave her for his life-companion, to feel her looks of gladness were all\r\nfor him, and have the right to take all fright away from her.\r\n\r\nThey could only smile at each other for good-morning, for everybody\r\nwas standing up and being brushed, and pushing here and there for\r\nsuit-cases and lost umbrellas; and everybody talked loudly, and laughed\r\na great deal, and told how late the train was. Then at last they were\r\nthere, and could get out and walk silently side by side in the noisy\r\nprocession through the station to the sidewalk.\r\n\r\nWhat little things sometimes change a lifetime, and make for our safety\r\nor our destruction! That very morning three keen watchers were set to\r\nguard that station at Washington to hunt out the government spy who had\r\nstolen back the stolen message, and take him, message and all, dead\r\nor alive, back to New York; for the man who could testify against the\r\nHolman Combination was not to be let live if there was such a thing as\r\ngetting him out of the way. But they never thought to watch the Special\r\nwhich was supposed to carry only delegates to the great convention. He\r\ncould not possibly be on that! They knew he was coming from Pittsburgh,\r\nfor they had been so advised by telegram the evening before by one of\r\ntheir company who had seen him buying a sleeper ticket for Washington,\r\nbut they felt safe about that Special, for they had made inquiries\r\nand been told no one but delegates could possibly come on it. They\r\nhad done their work thoroughly, and were on hand with every possible\r\nplan perfected for bagging their game, but they took the time when the\r\nPittsburgh Special was expected to arrive for eating a hearty breakfast\r\nin the restaurant across the street from the station. Two of them\r\nemerged from the restaurant doorway in plenty of time to meet the next\r\nPittsburgh train, just as Gordon, having placed the lady in a closed\r\ncarriage, was getting in himself.\r\n\r\nIf the carriage had stood in any other spot along the pavement in\r\nfront of the station, they never would have seen him, but, as it was,\r\nthey had a full view of him; and because they were Washington men, and\r\nexperts in their line, they recognized him at once, and knew their\r\nplans had failed, and that only by extreme measures could they hope\r\nto prevent the delivery of the message which would mean downfall and\r\ndisaster to them and their schemes.\r\n\r\nAs Gordon slammed shut the door of the carriage, he caught a vision of\r\nhis two enemies pointing excitedly toward him, and he knew that the\r\nbloodhounds were on the scent.\r\n\r\nHis heart beat wildly. His anxiety was divided between the message and\r\nthe lady. What should he do? Drive at once to the home of his chief\r\nand deliver the message, or leave the girl at his rooms, ’phone for\r\na faster conveyance and trust to getting to his chief ahead of his\r\npursuers?\r\n\r\n“Don’t let anything hinder you! Don’t let anything hinder you! Make it\r\na matter of life and death!” rang the little ditty in his ears, and now\r\nit seemed as if he must go straight ahead with the message. And yet--“a\r\nmatter of life and death!” He could not, must not, might not, take the\r\nlady with him into danger. If he must be in danger of death he did not\r\nwant to die having exposed an innocent stranger to the same.\r\n\r\nThen there was another point to be thought of.\r\n\r\nHe had already told the driver to take him to his apartments, and to\r\ndrive as rapidly as possible. It would not do to stop him now and\r\nchange the directions, for a pistol-shot could easily reach him yet;\r\nand, coming from a crowd, who would be suspected? His enemies were\r\nstanding on the threshold of a place where there were many of their\r\nkind to protect them, and none of his friends knew of his coming. It\r\nwould be a race for life from now on to the finish.\r\n\r\nCelia was looking out with interest at the streets, recognizing\r\nlandmarks with wonder, and did not notice Gordon’s white, set face\r\nand burning eyes as he strained his vision to note how fast the horse\r\nwas going. Oh, if the driver would only turn off at the next corner\r\ninto the side street they could not watch the carriage so far, but it\r\nwas not likely, for this was the most direct road, and yet--yes, he\r\nhad turned! Joy! The street here was so crowded that he had sought the\r\nnarrower, less crowded way that he might go the faster.\r\n\r\nIt seemed an age to him before they stopped at his apartments. To\r\nCelia, it had been but a short ride, in which familiar scenes had\r\nbrought her pleasure, for she recognized that she was not in strange\r\nChicago, but in Washington, a city often visited. Somehow she felt it\r\nwas an omen of a better future than she had feared.\r\n\r\n“Oh, why didn’t you tell me?” she smiled to Gordon. “It is Washington,\r\ndear old Washington.”\r\n\r\nSomehow he controlled the tumult in his heart and smiled back, saying\r\nin a voice quite natural:\r\n\r\n“I am so glad you like it.”\r\n\r\nShe seemed to understand that they could not talk until they reached\r\na quiet place somewhere, and she did not trouble him with questions.\r\nInstead--she looked from the window, or watched him furtively,\r\ncomparing him with her memory of George Hayne, and wondering in her\r\nown thoughts. She was glad to have them to herself for just this\r\nlittle bit, for now that the morning had come she was almost afraid of\r\nrevelation, what it might bring forth. And so it came about that they\r\ntook the swift ride in more or less silence, and neither thought it\r\nstrange.\r\n\r\nAs the carriage stopped, he spoke with low, hurried voice, tense with\r\nexcitement, but her own nerves were on a strain also, and she did not\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n“We get out here.”\r\n\r\nHe had the fare ready for the driver, and, stepping out, hurried Celia\r\ninto the shelter of the hallway. It happened that an elevator had just\r\ncome down, so it was but a second more before they were up safe in the\r\nhall before his own apartment.\r\n\r\nTaking a latch-key from his pocket, he applied it to the door, flung\r\nit open, and ushered Celia to a large leather chair in the middle of\r\nthe room. Then, stepping quickly to the side of the room, he touched a\r\nbell, and from it went to the telephone, with an “Excuse me, please,\r\nthis is necessary,” to the girl, who sat astonished, wondering at the\r\nhomelikeness of the room and at the “at-homeness” of the man. She had\r\nexpected to be taken to a hotel. This seemed to be a private apartment\r\nwith which he was perfectly acquainted. Perhaps it belonged to some\r\nfriend. But how, after an absence of years, could he remember just\r\nwhere to go, which door and which elevator to take, and how to fit the\r\nkey with so accustomed a hand? Then her attention was arrested by his\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n“Give me 254 L please,” he said.... “Is this 254 L?... Is Mr. Osborne\r\nin?... You say he has _not_ gone to the office yet?... May I speak\r\nwith him?... Is this Mr. Osborne?... I did not expect you to know\r\nmy voice.... Yes, sir; just arrived, and all safe so far. Shall I\r\nbring it to the house or the office?... The house?... All right,\r\nsir. Immediately.... By the way, I am sure Hale and Burke are on my\r\ntrack. They saw me at the station.... To your house?... You will wait\r\nuntil I come?... All right, sir. Yes, immediately.... Sure, I’ll take\r\nprecaution.... Good-by.”\r\n\r\nWith the closing words came a tap at the door.\r\n\r\n“Come, Henry,” he answered, as the astonished girl turned toward the\r\ndoor. “Henry, you will go down, please, to the restaurant, and bring up\r\na menu card. This lady will select what she would like to have, and you\r\nwill serve breakfast for her in this room as soon as possible. I shall\r\nbe out for perhaps an hour, and, meantime, you will obey any orders she\r\nmay give you.”\r\n\r\nHe did not introduce her as his wife, but she did not notice the\r\nomission. She had suddenly become aware of a strange, distraught haste\r\nin his manner, and when he said he was going out alarm seized her, she\r\ncould not tell why.\r\n\r\nThe man bowed deferentially to his master, looked his admiration and\r\ndevotion to the lady, waited long enough to say:\r\n\r\n“I’se mighty glad to see you safe back, sah--” and disappeared to obey\r\norders.\r\n\r\nCelia turned toward Gordon for an explanation, but he was already at\r\nthe telephone again:\r\n\r\n“46!... Is this the Garage?... This is The Harris Apartments.... Can\r\nyou send Thomas with a closed car to the rear door immediately?...\r\nYes.... No, I want Thomas, and a car that can speed.... Yes, the rear\r\ndoor, _rear_, and at once.... What?... What’s that?... But I _must_....\r\nIt’s _official_ business.... Well, I thought so. Hurry them up.\r\nGood-by.”\r\n\r\nHe turned and saw her troubled gaze following him with growing fear in\r\nher eyes.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” she asked anxiously. “Has something happened?”\r\n\r\nJust one moment he paused, and, coming toward her, laid his hands on\r\nhers tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Nothing the matter at all,” he said soothingly. “At least nothing\r\nthat need worry you. It is just a matter of pressing business. I’m\r\nsorry to have to go from you for a little while, but it is necessary. I\r\ncannot explain to you until I return. You will trust me? You will not\r\nworry?”\r\n\r\n“I will try!”\r\n\r\nHer lips were quivering, and her eyes were filled with tears. Again he\r\nfelt that intense longing to lay his lips upon hers and comfort her,\r\nbut he put it from him.\r\n\r\n“There is nothing to feel sad about,” he said, smiling gently. “It is\r\nnothing tragic only there is need for haste, for if I wait, I may fail\r\nyet---- It is something that means a great deal to me. When I come back\r\nI will explain all.”\r\n\r\n“Go!” she said, putting out her hands in a gesture of resignation, as\r\nif she would hurry him from her. And though she was burning to know\r\nwhat it all meant there was that about him that compelled her to trust\r\nhim and to wait.\r\n\r\nThen his control almost went from him. He nearly took those hands in\r\nhis and kissed them, but he did not. Instead, he went with swift steps\r\nto his bedroom door, threw open a chiffonier drawer, and took therefrom\r\nsomething small and sinister. She could see the gleam of its polished\r\nmetal, and she sensed a strange little menace in the click as he did\r\nsomething to it, she could not see what, because his back was to her.\r\nHe came out with his hand in his pocket, as if he had just hidden\r\nsomething there.\r\n\r\nShe was not familiar with firearms. Her mother had been afraid of them\r\nand her brother had never flourished any around the house, yet she knew\r\nby instinct that some weapon of defence was in Gordon’s possession;\r\nand a nameless horror rose in her heart and shone from her blue eyes,\r\nbut she would not speak a word to let him know it. If he had not been\r\nin such haste, he would have seen. Her horror would have been still\r\ngreater if she had known that he already carried one loaded revolver\r\nand was taking a second in case of an emergency.\r\n\r\n“Don’t worry,” he called as he hurried out the door. “Henry will get\r\nanything you need, and I shall soon be back.”\r\n\r\nThe door closed and he was gone. She heard his quick step down the\r\nhall, heard the elevator door slide and slam again, and then she knew\r\nhe was gone down. Outside an automobile sounded and she seemed to hear\r\nagain his words at the phone, “The rear door.” Why had he gone to the\r\nrear door? Was he in hiding? Was he flying from some one? What, oh\r\nwhat, did it mean?\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to reason it out, she flew across the room and opened\r\nthe door of the bedroom he had just left, then through it passed\r\nswiftly to a bath-room beyond. Yes, there was a window. Would it be the\r\none? Could she see him? And what good would it do her if she could?\r\n\r\nShe crowded close to the window. There was a heavy sash with stained\r\nglass, but she selected a clear bit of yellow and put her eye close.\r\nYes, there was a closed automobile just below her, and it had started\r\naway from the building. He had gone, then. Where?\r\n\r\nHer mind was a blank for a few minutes. She went slowly, mechanically\r\nback to the other room without noticing anything about her, sat down in\r\nthe chair, putting her hands to her temples, and tried to think. Back\r\nto the moment in the church where he had appeared at her side and the\r\nservice had begun. Something had told her then that he was different,\r\nand yet there had been those letters, and how could it possibly be\r\nthat he had not written them? He was gone on some dangerous business.\r\nOf that she felt sure. There had been some caution given him by the\r\nman to whom he first ’phoned. He had promised to take precaution--that\r\nmeant the little, wicked, gleaming thing in his pocket. Perhaps some\r\nharm would come to him, and she would never know. And then she stared\r\nat the opposite wall with wonder-filled eyes. Well, and suppose it\r\ndid? Why did she care? Was he not the man whose power over her but two\r\nshort days ago would have made her welcome death as her deliverer? Why\r\nwas all changed now? Just because he had smiled upon her and been kind?\r\nHad given her a few wild flowers and said her eyes were like them? Had\r\nhair that waved instead of being straight and thin? And where was all\r\nher loyalty to her dear dead father’s memory? How could she mind that\r\ndanger should come to one who had threatened to tell terrible lies that\r\nshould blacken him in the thoughts of people who had loved him? Had\r\nshe forgotten the letters? Was she willing to forgive all just because\r\nhe had declared that he did not write them? How foolish! He said he\r\ncould prove that he did not, but of course that was all nonsense. He\r\nmust have written them. And yet there was the wave in his hair, and the\r\nkindness in his eyes. And he had looked--oh, he had looked terrible\r\nthings when he had read that letter; as if he would like to wreak\r\nvengeance on the man who had written it. Could a man masquerade that\r\nway?\r\n\r\nAnd then a new solution to the problem came to her. Suppose\r\nthis--whoever he was--this man who had married her, had gone out to\r\nfind and punish George Hayne? Suppose---- But then she covered her eyes\r\nwith her hands and shuddered. Yet why should she care? But she did.\r\nSuppose he should be killed, himself! Who was he if not George Hayne\r\nand how did he come to take his place? Was it just another of George’s\r\nterrible tricks upon her?\r\n\r\nA quick vision came of their bringing him back to her. He would lie,\r\nperhaps, on that great crimson leather couch over there, just as he had\r\nlain in the dawning of the morning in the stateroom of the train, with\r\nhis hands hanging limp, and one perhaps across his breast, as if he\r\nwere guarding something, and his bright waves of brown hair lying heavy\r\nabout his forehead--only, his forehead would be white, so white and\r\ncold, with a little blue mark in his temple perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe footsteps of the man Henry brought her back to the present again.\r\nShe smiled at him pleasantly as he entered, and answered his questions\r\nabout what she would have for breakfast; but it was he who selected the\r\nmenu, not she, and after he had gone she could not have told what she\r\nhad ordered. She could not get away from the vision on the couch. She\r\nclosed her eyes and pressed her cold fingers against her eyeballs to\r\ndrive it away, but still her bridegroom seemed to lie there before her.\r\n\r\nThe colored man came back presently with a loaded tray, and set it down\r\non a little table which he wheeled before her, as though he had done\r\nit many times before. She thanked him, and said there was nothing else\r\nshe needed, so he went away.\r\n\r\nShe toyed with the cup of delicious coffee which he had poured for her,\r\nand the few swallows she took gave her new heart. She broke a bit from\r\na hot roll, and ate a little of the delicious steak, but still her mind\r\nwas at work at the problem, and her heart was full of nameless anxiety.\r\n\r\nHe had gone away without any breakfast himself, and he had had no\r\nsupper the night before, she was sure. He probably had given to her\r\neverything he could get on the train. She was haunted with regret\r\nbecause she had not shared with him. She got up and walked about the\r\nroom, trying to shake off the horror that was upon her, and the dread\r\nof what the morning might bring forth. Ordinarily she would have\r\nthought of sending a message to her mother and brother, but her mind\r\nwas so troubled now that it never occurred to her.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the room were tinted a soft greenish gray, and above the\r\npicture moulding they blended into a woodsy landscape with a hint\r\nof water, greensward, and blue sky through interlacing branches. It\r\nreminded her of the little village they had seen as they started from\r\nthe train in the early morning light. What a beautiful day they had\r\nspent together and how it had changed her whole attitude of heart\r\ntoward the man she had married!\r\n\r\nTwo or three fine pictures were hung in good lights. She studied them,\r\nand knew that the one who had selected and hung them was a judge of\r\ntrue art; but they did not hold her attention long, for as yet, she had\r\nnot connected the room with the man for whom she waited.\r\n\r\nA handsome mahogany desk stood open in a broad space by the window. She\r\nwas attracted by a little painted miniature of a woman. She took it up\r\nand studied the face. It was fine and sweet, with brown hair dressed\r\nlow, and eyes that reminded her of the man who had just gone from her.\r\nWas this, then, the home of some relative with whom he had come to stop\r\nfor a day or two, and, if so, where was the relative? The dress in the\r\nminiature was of a quarter of a century past, yet the face was young\r\nand sweet, as young, perhaps, as herself. She wondered who it was. She\r\nput the miniature back in place with caressing hand. She felt that she\r\nwould like to know this woman with the tender eyes. She wished her here\r\nnow, that she might tell her all her anxiety.\r\n\r\nHer eye wandered to the pile of letters, some of them official-looking\r\nones, one or two in square, perfumed envelopes, with high, angular\r\nwriting. They were all addressed to Mr. Cyril Gordon. That was\r\nstrange! Who was Mr. Cyril Gordon? What had they--what had she--to do\r\nwith him? Was he a friend whom George--whom they--were visiting for a\r\nfew days? It was all bewildering.\r\n\r\nThen the telephone rang.\r\n\r\nHer heart beat wildly and she looked toward it as if it had been a\r\nhuman voice speaking and she had no power to answer. What should she do\r\nnow? Should she answer? Or should she wait for the man to come? Could\r\nthe man hear the telephone bell or was she perhaps expected to answer?\r\nAnd yet if Mr. Cyril Gordon--well, somebody ought to answer. The ’phone\r\nrang insistently once more, and still a third time. What if _he_ should\r\nbe calling her! Perhaps he was in distress. This thought sent her\r\nflying to the ’phone. She took down the receiver and called:\r\n\r\n“Hello!” and her voice sounded far away to herself.\r\n\r\n“Is this Mr. Gordon’s apartment?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered, for her eyes were resting on the pile of letters\r\nclose at hand.\r\n\r\n“Is Mr. Gordon there?”\r\n\r\n“No, he is not,” she answered, growing more confident now and almost\r\nwishing she had not presumed to answer a stranger’s ’phone.\r\n\r\n“Why, I just ’phoned to the office and they told me he had returned,”\r\nsaid a voice that had an imperious note in it. “Are you sure he isn’t\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\n“Quite sure,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Who is this, please?”\r\n\r\n“I beg your pardon,” said Celia trying to make time and knowing not\r\nhow to reply. She was not any longer Miss Hathaway. Who was she? Mrs.\r\nHayne? She shrank from the name. It was filled with horror for her.\r\n“Who is this, I said,” snapped the other voice now. “Is this the\r\nchambermaid? Because if it is I’d like you to look around and inquire\r\nand be quite sure that Mr. Gordon isn’t there. I wish to speak with him\r\nabout something very important.”\r\n\r\nCelia smiled.\r\n\r\n“No, this is not the chambermaid,” she said sweetly, “and I am quite\r\nsure Mr. Gordon is not here.”\r\n\r\n“How long before he will be there?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know really, for I have but just come myself.”\r\n\r\n“Who is this to whom I am talking?”\r\n\r\n“Why--just a friend,” she answered, wondering if that were the best\r\nthing to say.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” there was a long and contemplative pause at the other end.\r\n\r\n“Well, could you give Mr. Gordon a message when he comes in?”\r\n\r\n“Why certainly, I think so. Who is this?”\r\n\r\n“Miss Bentley. Julia Bentley. He’ll know,” replied the imperious one\r\neagerly now. “And tell him please that he is expected here to dinner\r\nto-night. We need him to complete the number, and he simply mustn’t\r\nfail me. I’ll excuse him for going off in such a rush if he comes early\r\nand tells me all about it. Now you won’t forget, will you? You got the\r\nname, Bentley, did you? B, E, N, T, L, E, Y, you know. And you’ll tell\r\nhim the minute he comes in?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you! What did you say your name was?”\r\n\r\nBut Celia had hung up. Somehow the message annoyed her, she could not\r\ntell why. She wished she had not answered the ’phone. Whoever Mr. Cyril\r\nGordon was what should she do if he should suddenly appear? And as for\r\nthis imperious lady and her message she hoped she would never have to\r\ndeliver it. On second thought why not write it and leave it on his desk\r\nwith the pile of letters? She would do it. It would serve to pass away\r\na few of these dreadful minutes that lagged so distressfully.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and wrote: “Miss Bentley wishes Mr. Gordon to dine with\r\nher this evening. She will pardon his running away the other day if he\r\nwill come early.” She laid it beside the high angular writing on the\r\nsquare perfumed letters and went back to the leather chair too restless\r\nto rest yet too weary to stand up.\r\n\r\nShe went presently to the back windows to look out, and then to the\r\nside ones. Across the housetops she could catch a glimpse of domes and\r\nbuildings. There was the Congressional Library, which usually delighted\r\nher with its exquisite tones of gold and brown and white. But she had\r\nno eyes for it now. Beyond were more buildings, all set in the lovely\r\nfoliage which was much farther developed than it had been in New York\r\nState. From another window she could get a glimpse of the Potomac\r\nshining in the morning sun.\r\n\r\nShe wandered to the front windows and looked out. There were people\r\npassing and repassing. It was a busy street, but she could not make out\r\nwhether it was one she knew or not. There were two men walking back and\r\nforth on the opposite side. They did not go further than the corner of\r\nthe street either way. They looked across at the windows sometimes and\r\npointed up, when they met, and once one of them took something out of\r\nhis pocket and flashed it under his coat at his side, as if to have it\r\nready for use. It reminded her of the thing her husband had held in his\r\nhand in the bedroom and she shuddered. She watched them, fascinated,\r\nnot able to draw herself away from the window.\r\n\r\nNow and then she would go to the rear window, to see if there was any\r\nsign of the automobile returning, and then hurry back to the front, to\r\nsee if the men were still there. Once she returned to the chair, and,\r\nlying back, shut her eyes, and let the memory of yesterday sweep over\r\nher in all its sweet details, up to the time when they had got into the\r\nway train and she had seemed to feel her disloyalty to her father. But\r\nnow her heart was all on the other side, and she began to feel that\r\nthere had been some dreadful mistake, somewhere, and he was surely all\r\nright. He could not, could not have written those terrible letters.\r\nThen again the details of their wild carriage ride in Pittsburgh\r\nand miraculous escape haunted her. There was something strange and\r\nunexplained about that which she must understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nMeantime, Gordon was speeding away to another part of the city by the\r\nfastest time an experienced chauffeur dared to make. About the time\r\nthey turned the first corner into the avenue, two burly policemen\r\nsauntered casually into the pretty square in front of the house where\r\nlived the chief of the Secret Service. There was nothing about their\r\ndemeanor to show that they had been detailed there by special urgency,\r\nand three men who hurried to the little park just across the street\r\nfrom the house could not possibly know that their leisurely and\r\ncareless stroll was the result of a hurried telephone message from the\r\nchief to police headquarters immediately after his message from Gordon.\r\n\r\nThe policemen strolled by the house, greeted each other, and walked\r\non around the square across the little park. They eyed the three men\r\nsitting idly on a bench, and passed leisurely on. They disappeared\r\naround a corner, and to the three men were out of the way. The latter\r\ndid not know the hidden places where the officers took up their watch,\r\nand when an automobile appeared, and the three stealthily got up from\r\ntheir park bench and distributed themselves among the shrubbery near\r\nthe walk, they knew not that their every movement was observed with\r\nkeen attention. But they did wonder how it happened that those two\r\npolicemen seemed to spring out of the ground suddenly, just as the auto\r\ncame to a halt in front of the chief’s house.\r\n\r\nGordon sprang out and up the steps with a bound, the door opening\r\nbefore him as if he were expected. The two grim and apparently\r\nindifferent policemen stood outside like two stone images on guard,\r\nwhile up the street with rhythmic sound rode two mounted police, also\r\ncoming to a halt before the house as if for a purpose. The three men in\r\nthe bushes hid their instruments of death, and would have slunk away\r\nhad there been a chance; but, turning to make a hasty flight, they were\r\nmet by three more policemen. There was the crack of a revolver as one\r\nof the three desperadoes tried a last reckless dash for freedom--and\r\nfailed. The wretch went to justice with his right arm hanging limp by\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\nInside the house Gordon was delivering up his message, and as he\r\nlaid it before his chief, and stood silent while the elder man read\r\nand pondered its tremendous import, it occurred to him for the first\r\ntime that his chief would require some report of his journey, and\r\nthe hindrances that had made him a whole day late in getting back to\r\nWashington. His heart stood still with sudden panic. What was he to\r\ndo? How could he tell it all? What right had he to tell of his marriage\r\nto an unknown woman? A marriage that perhaps was not a marriage. He\r\ncould not know what the outcome would be until he had told the girl\r\neverything. As far as he himself was concerned he knew that the great\r\njoy of his life had come to him in her. Yet he could not hope that it\r\nwould be so with her. And he must think of her and protect her good\r\nname in every way. If there should be such a thing ever as that she\r\nshould consent to remain with him and be his wife he must never let a\r\nsoul know but what the marriage had been planned long ago. It would not\r\nbe fair to her. It would make life intolerable for them both either\r\ntogether or apart. And while he might be and doubtless was perfectly\r\nsafe in confiding in his chief, and asking him to keep silence about\r\nthe matter, still he felt that even that would be a breach of faith\r\nwith Celia. He must close his lips upon the story until he could talk\r\nwith her and know her wishes. He drew a sigh of weariness. It was a\r\nlong, hard way he had come, and it was not over. The worst ordeal would\r\nbe his confession to the bride who was not his wife.\r\n\r\nThe chief looked up.\r\n\r\n“Could you make this out, Gordon?” he asked, noting keenly the young\r\nman’s weary eyes, the strained, tense look about his mouth.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes sir; I saw it at once. I was almost afraid my eyes might\r\nbetray the secret before I got away with it.”\r\n\r\n“Then you know what you have saved the country, and what you have been\r\nworth to the Service.”\r\n\r\nThe young man flushed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” he said, looking down. “I understood it was\r\nimportant, and I am glad I was able to accomplish the errand without\r\nfailing.”\r\n\r\n“Have you reason to suppose you were followed, except for what you saw\r\nat the station in this city?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; I am sure there were detectives after me as I was leaving\r\nNew York. They were suspicious of me. I saw one of the men who had\r\nbeen at the dinner with me watching me. The disguise--and--some\r\ncircumstances--threw him off. He wasn’t sure. Then, there was a\r\nman--you know him, Balder--at Pittsburgh?----”\r\n\r\n“Pittsburgh!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you wonder how I got to Pittsburgh. You see, I was shadowed\r\nalmost from the first I suspect, for when I reached the station in\r\nNew York I was sure I recognized this man who had sat opposite me a\r\nfew minutes before. I suppose my disguise, which you so thoughtfully\r\nprovided, bothered him, for though he followed me about at a little\r\ndistance he didn’t speak to me. I had to get on the first train that\r\ncircumstances permitted, and perhaps the fact that it was a Chicago\r\ntrain made him think he was mistaken in me. Anyhow I saw no more of him\r\nafter the train left the station. Rather unexpectedly I found I could\r\nget the drawing-room compartment, and went into immediate retirement,\r\nleaving the train at daylight where it was delayed on a side track,\r\nand walked across country till I found a conveyance that took me to a\r\nPittsburgh train. It didn’t seem feasible to get away from the Chicago\r\ntrain any sooner as the train made no further stops, and it was rather\r\nlate at night by the time I boarded it. I thought I would run less risk\r\nby making a détour. I never dreamed they would have watchers out for\r\nme at Pittsburgh, and I can’t think yet how they managed to get on my\r\ntrack, but almost the first minute I landed I spied Balder stretching\r\nhis neck over the crowds. I bolted from the station at once and finding\r\na carriage drawn up before the door just ready for me I got in and\r\nordered them to drive me to East Liberty station.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid I shall always be suspicious of handy closed carriages\r\nafter this experience. I certainly have reason to be. The door was no\r\nsooner closed on me than the driver began to race like mad through the\r\nstreets. I didn’t think much of it at first until he had been going\r\nsome time, fully long enough to have reached East Liberty, and the\r\nhorse was still rushing like a locomotive. Then I saw that we were in a\r\nlonely district of the city that seemed unfamiliar. That alarmed me and\r\nI tapped on the window and called to the driver. He paid no attention.\r\nThen I found the doors were fastened shut, and the windows plugged so\r\nthey wouldn’t open.\r\n\r\n“I discovered that an armed man rode beside the driver. I managed to\r\nget one of the doors open after a good deal of work, and escaped when\r\nwe stopped for a freight train to pass; but I’m satisfied that I was\r\nbeing kidnapped and if I hadn’t got away just when I did you would\r\nnever have heard of me again or the message either. I finally managed\r\nto reach East Liberty station and jumped on the first train that came\r\nin, but I caught a glimpse of Balder stretching his neck over the\r\ncrowd. He must have seen me and had Hale and Burke on the watch when I\r\ngot here. They just missed me by a half second. They went over to the\r\nrestaurant--didn’t expect me on a special, but I escaped them, and I’m\r\nmighty glad to get that little paper into your possession and out of\r\nmine. It’s rather a long story to tell the whole, but I think you have\r\nthe main facts.”\r\n\r\nThere was a suspicious glitter in the keen eyes of the kind old chief\r\nas he put out his hand and grasped Gordon’s in a hearty shake; but all\r\nhe said was:\r\n\r\n“And you are all worn out--I’ll guarantee you didn’t sleep much last\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“Well, no,” said Gordon; “I had to sit up in a day-coach and share the\r\nseat with another man. Besides, I was somewhat excited.”\r\n\r\n“Of course, of course!” puffed the old chief, coughing vigorously, and\r\nshowing by his gruff attitude that he was deeply affected. “Well, young\r\nman, this won’t be forgotten by the Department. Now you go home and\r\ntake a good sleep. Take the whole day off if you wish, and then come\r\ndown to-morrow morning and tell me all about it. Isn’t there anything\r\nmore I need to know at once that justice may be done?”\r\n\r\n“I believe not,” said Gordon, with a sigh of relief. “There’s a list\r\nof the men who were at the dinner with me. I wrote them down from\r\nmemory last night when I couldn’t sleep. I also wrote a few scraps of\r\nconversation, which will show you just how deep the plot had gone. If\r\nI had not read the message and known its import, I should not have\r\nunderstood what they were talking about.”\r\n\r\n“H-m! Yes. If there had been more time before you started I might have\r\ntold you all about it. Still, it seemed desirable that you should\r\nappear as much at your ease as possible. I thought this would be best\r\naccomplished by your knowing nothing of the import of the writing when\r\nyou first met the people.”\r\n\r\n“I suppose it was as well that I did not know any more than I did. You\r\nare a great chief, sir! I was deeply impressed anew with that fact as\r\nI saw how wonderfully you had planned for every possible emergency. It\r\nwas simply great, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Pooh! Pooh! Get you home and to bed,” said the old chief quite\r\nbrusquely.\r\n\r\nHe touched a bell and a man appeared.\r\n\r\n“Jessup, is the coast clear?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yessah,” declared the darky. “Dey have jest hed a couple o’ shots in\r\nde pahk, an’ now dey tuk de villains off to der p’lice station. De\r\nofficers is out der waitin’ to ’scort de gemman.”\r\n\r\n“Get home with you, Gordon, and don’t come to the office till ten in\r\nthe morning. Then come straight to my private room.”\r\n\r\nGordon thanked him, and left the room preceded by the gray-haired\r\nservant. He was surprised to find the policemen outside, and wondered\r\nstill more that they seemed to be going one in front and the other\r\nbehind him as he rode along. He was greatly relieved that he had not\r\nbeen called upon to give the whole story. His heart was filled with\r\nanxiety now to get back to the girl, and tell her everything, and yet\r\nhe dreaded it more than anything he had ever had to face in all his\r\nlife. He sat back on the cushions, and, covering his face with his\r\nhands, tried to think how he should begin, but he could see nothing but\r\nher sweet eyes filled with tears, think of nothing but the way she had\r\nlooked and smiled during the beautiful morning they had spent together\r\nin the little town of Milton. Beautiful little Milton. Should he ever\r\nsee it again?\r\n\r\nCelia at her window grew more and more nervous as an hour and then\r\nanother half-hour slipped slowly away, and still he did not come.\r\nThen two mounted policemen rode rapidly down the street following an\r\nautomobile, in which sat the man for whom she waited.\r\n\r\nShe had no eyes now for the men who had been lurking across the way,\r\nand when she thought to look for them again she saw them running in the\r\nopposite direction as fast as they could go, making wild gestures for a\r\ncar to stop for them.\r\n\r\nShe stood by the window and saw Gordon get out of the car, and\r\ndisappear into the building below, saw the car wheel and curve away\r\nand the mounted police take up their stand on either corner; heard the\r\nclang of the elevator as it started up, and the clash of its door as\r\nit stopped at that floor; heard steps coming on toward the door, and\r\nthe key in the latch. Then she turned and looked at him, her two hands\r\nclasped before her, and her two eyes yearning, glad and fearful all at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I have been so frightened about you! I am so glad you have come!”\r\nshe said, and caught her voice in a sob as she took one little step\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\nHe threw his hat upon the floor, wherever it might land, and went\r\nto meet her, a great light glowing in his tired eyes, his arms\r\noutstretched to hers.\r\n\r\n“And did you care?” he asked in a voice of almost awe. “Dear, did you\r\n_care_ what became of _me_?”\r\n\r\nHe had come quite close to her now.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I _cared_! I could not help it.” There was a real sob in her\r\nvoice now, though her eyes were shining.\r\n\r\nHis arms went around her hungrily, as if he would draw her to him in\r\nspite of everything; yet he kept them so encircling, without touching\r\nher, like a benediction that would enwrap the very soul of his beloved.\r\nLooking down into her face he breathed softly:\r\n\r\n“Oh, my dear, it seems as if I must hold you close and kiss you!”\r\n\r\nShe looked up with bated breath, and thought she understood. Then,\r\nwith a lovely gesture of surrender, she whispered, “I can trust you.”\r\nHer lashes were drooping now over her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Not until you know all,” he said, and put her gently from him into the\r\ngreat arm-chair, with a look of reverence and self-abnegation she felt\r\nshe never would forget.\r\n\r\n“Then, tell me quickly,” she said, a swift fear making her weak from\r\nhead to foot. She laid her hand across her heart, as if to help steady\r\nits beating.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled forward the leather couch opposite her chair, and sat down,\r\nhis head drooping, his eyes down. He dreaded to begin.\r\n\r\nShe waited for the revelation, her eyes upon his bowed head.\r\n\r\nFinally he lifted his eyes and saw her look, and a tender light came\r\ninto his face.\r\n\r\n“It is a strange story,” he said. “I don’t know what you will think of\r\nme after it is told, but I want you to know that, blundering, stupid,\r\neven criminal, though you may think me, I would sooner die this minute\r\nthan cause you one more breath of suffering.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes lit up with a wonderful light, and the ready tears sprang into\r\nthem, tears that sparkled through the sunshine of a great joy that\r\nillumined her whole face.\r\n\r\n“Please go on,” she said softly, and added very gently, “I believe you.”\r\n\r\nBut even with those words in his ears the beginning was not easy.\r\nGordon drew a deep breath and launched forth.\r\n\r\n“I am not the man you think,” he said, and looked at her to see how she\r\nwould take it. “My name is not George Hayne. My name is Cyril Gordon.”\r\n\r\nAs one might launch an arrow at a beloved victim and long that it may\r\nnot strike the mark, so he sent his truth home to her understanding,\r\nand waited in breathless silence, hoping against hope that this might\r\nnot turn her against him.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she breathed softly, as if some puzzle were solving itself.\r\n“Oh!”--this time not altogether in surprise, nor as if the fact were\r\ndispleasing. She looked at him expectantly for further revelation, and\r\nhe plunged into his story headlong.\r\n\r\n“I’m a member of the Secret Service,--headquarters here in\r\nWashington,--and day before yesterday I was sent to New York on an\r\nimportant errand. A message of great import written in a private code\r\nhad been stolen from one of our men. I was sent to get it before they\r\ncould decipher it. The message involved matters of such tremendous\r\nsignificance that I was ordered to go under an assumed name, and on\r\nno account to let anyone know of my mission. My orders were to get the\r\nmessage, and let nothing hinder me in bringing it with all haste to\r\nWashington. I went with the full understanding that I might even be\r\ncalled upon to risk my life.”\r\n\r\nHe looked up. The girl sat wide-eyed, with hands clasped together at\r\nher throat.\r\n\r\nHe hurried on, not to cause her any needless anxiety.\r\n\r\n“I won’t weary you with details. There were a good many annoying\r\nhindrances on the way, which served to make me nervous, but I carried\r\nout the programme laid down by my chief, and succeeded in getting\r\npossession of the message and making my escape from the house of the\r\nman who had stolen it. As I closed the door behind me, knowing that it\r\ncould be but a matter of a few seconds at longest before six furious\r\nmen would be on my track, who would stop at nothing to get back what\r\nI had taken from them, I saw a carriage standing almost before the\r\nhouse. The driver took me for the man he awaited, and I lost no time in\r\ntaking advantage of his mistake. I jumped in, telling him to drive as\r\nfast as he could. I intended to give him further directions, but he had\r\nevidently had them from another quarter, and I thought I could call to\r\nhim as soon as we were out of the dangerous neighborhood. To add to\r\nmy situation I soon became sure that an automobile and a motor-cycle\r\nwere following me. I recognized one of the men in the car as the man\r\nwho sat opposite to me at the table a few minutes before. My coachman\r\ndrove like mad, while I hurried to secure the message so that if I were\r\ncaught it would not be found, and to put on a slight disguise--some\r\neyebrows and things the chief had given me. Before I knew where I was,\r\nthe carriage had stopped before a building. At first I thought it was\r\na prison--and the car and motor-cycle came to a halt just behind me. I\r\nfelt that I was pretty well trapped.”\r\n\r\nThe girl gave a low moan, and Gordon, not daring to look up, hurried on\r\nwith his story.\r\n\r\n“There isn’t much more to tell that you do not already know. I soon\r\ndiscovered the building was a church, not a prison. What happened\r\nafterward was the result of my extreme perturbation of mind, I suppose.\r\nI cannot account for my stupidity and subsequent cowardice in any other\r\nway. Neither was it possible for me to explain matters satisfactorily\r\nat any time during the whole mix-up, on account of the trust which I\r\ncarried, and which I could on no account reveal even in confidence,\r\nor put in jeopardy in the slightest degree. Naturally at first my\r\ncommission and how to get safely through it all was the only thing of\r\nimportance to me. If you keep this in mind perhaps you will be able\r\nto judge me less harshly. My only thought when the carriage came to a\r\nhalt was how to escape from those two pursuers, and that more or less\r\npervaded my mind during what followed so that ordinary matters which at\r\nanother time would have been at once clear to me, meant nothing at all.\r\nYou see, the instant that carriage came to a standstill some one threw\r\nopen the door, and I heard a voice call ‘Where is the best man?’ Then\r\nanother voice said, ‘Here he is!’ I took it that they thought I was\r\nbest man, but would soon discover that I wasn’t when I came into the\r\nlight. There wasn’t any chance to slip away, or I should have done so,\r\nand vanished in the dark, but everybody surrounded me, and seemed to\r\nthink I was all right. The two men who had followed were close behind\r\neyeing me keenly. I’m satisfied that they were to blame for that wild\r\nride we took in Pittsburgh! I soon saw by the remarks that the man\r\nI was supposed to be had been away from this country for ten years,\r\nand of course then they would not be very critical. I tried twice to\r\nexplain that there was a mistake, but both times they misunderstood\r\nme and thought I was saying I couldn’t go in the procession because\r\nI hadn’t practised. I don’t just know how I came to be in such a\r\ndreadful mess. It would seem as if it ought to have been a very easy\r\nthing to say I had got into the wrong carriage and they must excuse me,\r\nthat I wasn’t their man, but, you see, they gave me no time to think\r\nnor to speak. They just turned me over from one man to another and took\r\neverything for granted, and I, finding that I would have to break loose\r\nand flee before their eyes if I wished to escape, reflected that there\r\nwould be no harm in marching down the aisle as best man in a delayed\r\nwedding, if that was all there was to do. I could disappear as soon as\r\nthe ceremony was over, and no one would be the wiser. The real best man\r\nwould probably turn up and then they might wonder as they pleased for I\r\nwould be far away and perhaps this was as good a place as any in which\r\nto hide for half an hour until my pursuers were baffled and well on\r\ntheir way seeking elsewhere for me. I can see now that I made a grave\r\nmistake in allowing even so much deception, but I did not see any harm\r\nin it then, and they all seemed in great distress for the ceremony to\r\ngo forward. Bear in mind also that I was at that time entirely taken up\r\nwith the importance of hiding my message until I could take it safely\r\nto my chief. Nothing else seemed to matter much. If the real best man\r\nwas late to the wedding and they were willing to use me in his place\r\nwhat harm could come from it? He certainly deserved it for being late\r\nand if he came in during the ceremony he would think some one else had\r\nbeen put in his place. They introduced me to your brother--Jefferson.\r\nI thought he was the bridegroom, and I thought so until they laid your\r\nhand in mine!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she moaned, and the little hand went to help its mate cover her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“I knew it!” he said bitterly. “I knew you would feel just that way\r\nas soon as you knew. I don’t blame you. I deserve it! I was a fool, a\r\nvillain, a dumb brute--whatever you have a mind to call me! You can’t\r\nbegin to understand how I have suffered for you since this happened,\r\nand how I have blamed myself.”\r\n\r\nHe got up suddenly and strode over to the window, frowning down into\r\nthe sunlit street, and wondering how it was that everybody seemed to\r\nbe going on in exactly the same hurry as ever, when for him life had\r\nsuddenly come to a standstill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room was very still. The girl did not even sob. He turned after\r\na moment and went back to that bowed golden head there in the deep\r\ncrimson chair.\r\n\r\n“Look here,” he said, “I know you can’t ever forgive me. I don’t expect\r\nit! I don’t deserve it! But please don’t feel so awfully about it. I’ll\r\nexplain it all to every one. I’ll make it all right for you. I’ll take\r\nevery bit of blame on myself, and get plenty of witnesses to prove all\r\nabout it----”\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up with sorrow and surprise in her wet eyes.\r\n\r\n“Why, I do not blame you,” she said, mournfully. “I cannot see how\r\nyou were to blame. It was no one’s fault. It was just an unusual\r\nhappening--a strange set of circumstances. I could not blame you. There\r\nis nothing to forgive, and if there were I would gladly forgive it!”\r\n\r\n“Then what on earth makes you look so white and feel so distressed?” he\r\nasked in a distracted voice, as a man will sometimes look and talk to\r\nthe woman he loves when she becomes a tearful problem of despair to his\r\nobtuse eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t you know?”\r\n\r\n“No, I don’t,” he said. “You’re surely not mourning for that brute of a\r\nman to whom you had promised to sacrifice your life?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and buried her face in her hands again. He could\r\nsee that the tears were dropping between her fingers, and they seemed\r\nto fall red hot upon his heart.\r\n\r\n“Then what is it?” His tone was almost sharp in its demand, but she\r\nonly cried the harder. Her slender shoulders were shaking with her\r\ngrief now.\r\n\r\nHe put his hand down softly and touched her bowed head.\r\n\r\n“Won’t you tell me, Dear?” he breathed, and, stooping, knelt beside her.\r\n\r\nThe sobs ceased, and she was quite still for a moment, while his hand\r\nstill lay on her hair with that gentle, pleading touch.\r\n\r\n“It is--because you married me--in--that way--without knowing---- Oh,\r\ncan’t you see how terrible----”\r\n\r\nOh, the folly and blindness of love! Gordon got up from his knees as if\r\nshe had stung him.\r\n\r\n“You need not feel bad about that any more,” he said in a hurt tone.\r\n“Did I not tell you I would set you free at once? Surely no one in his\r\nsenses could call you bound after such circumstances.”\r\n\r\nShe was very still for an instant, as if he had struck her, and then\r\nshe raised her golden head, and a pair of sweet eyes suddenly grown\r\nhaughty.\r\n\r\n“You mean that _I_ will set _you_ free!” she said coldly. “I could not\r\nthink of letting you be bound by a misunderstanding when you were under\r\ngreat stress of mind. You were in no wise to blame. _I_ will set _you_\r\nfree.”\r\n\r\n“As you please,” he retorted bitterly, turning toward the window again.\r\n“It all amounts to the same thing. There is nothing for you to feel bad\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, there is,” she answered, with a quick rush of feeling that broke\r\nthrough her assumed haughtiness. “I shall always feel that I have\r\nbroken in upon your life. You have had a most trying experience with\r\nme, and you never can quite forget it. Things won’t be the same----”\r\n\r\nShe paused and the quiet tears chased each other eloquently down her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Gordon still bitterly; “things will never be the same for\r\nme. I shall always see you sitting there in my chair. I shall always be\r\nmissing you from it! But I am glad--glad. I would never have known what\r\nI missed if it had not been for this.” He spoke almost savagely.\r\n\r\nHe did not look around, but she was staring at him in astonishment, her\r\nblue eyes suddenly alight.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean?” she asked softly.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled round upon her. “I mean that I shall never forget you; that\r\nI do not want to forget you. I should rather have had these two days of\r\nyour sweet company, than all my lifetime in any other companionship.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she breathed. “Then, why--why did you say what you did about\r\nbeing free?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t say anything about being free that I remember. It was you\r\nthat said that.”\r\n\r\n“I said I would set you free. I could not, of course, hold you to a\r\nbond you did not want----”\r\n\r\n“But I did not say I did not want it. I said I would not hold you if\r\n_you_ did not want to stay.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that if you had known me a little--that is, just as much\r\nas you know me now--and had come in there and found out your mistake\r\nbefore it was too late, that you would have _wanted_ to go on with it?”\r\n\r\nShe waited for his answer breathlessly.\r\n\r\n“If you had known me just as much as you do now, and had looked up and\r\nseen that it was I and not George Hayne you were marrying, would _you_\r\nhave wanted to go on and be married?”\r\n\r\nHer cheeks grew rosy and her eyes confused.\r\n\r\n“I asked you first,” she said, with just a flicker of a smile.\r\n\r\nHe caught the shimmer of light in her eyes, and came toward her\r\neagerly, his own face all aglow now with a dawning understanding.\r\n\r\n“Darling,” he said, “I can go farther than you have asked. From the\r\nfirst minute my eyes rested upon your face under that mist of white\r\nveil I wished with all my heart that I might have known you before any\r\nother man had found and won you. When you turned and looked at me with\r\nthat deep sorrow in your eyes, you pledged me with every fibre of my\r\nbeing to fight for you. I was yours from that instant. And when your\r\nlittle hand was laid in mine, my heart went out in longing to have it\r\nstay in mine forever. I know now, as I did not understand then, that\r\nthe real reason for my not doing something to make known my identity\r\nat that instant was not because I was afraid of any of the things\r\nthat might happen, or any scene I might make, but because my heart\r\nwas fighting for the right to keep what had been given me out of the\r\nunknown. You are my wife, by every law of heaven and earth, if your\r\nheart will but say yes. I love you, as I never knew a man could love,\r\nand yet if you do not want to stay with me I will set you free; but it\r\nis true that I should never be the same, for I am married to you in my\r\nheart, and always shall be. Darling, look up and answer my question\r\nnow.”\r\n\r\nHe stood before her with outstretched arms, and for answer she rose and\r\ncame to him slowly, with downcast eyes.\r\n\r\n“I do not want to be set free,” she said.\r\n\r\nThen gently, tenderly, he folded his arms about her, as if she were too\r\nprecious to handle roughly, and laid his lips upon hers.\r\n\r\nIt was the shrill, insistent clang of the telephone bell that broke in\r\nupon their bliss. For a moment Gordon let it ring, but its merciless\r\nclatter was not to be denied; so, drawing Celia close within his arm,\r\nhe made her come with him to the ’phone.\r\n\r\nTo his annoyance, the haughty voice of Miss Bentley answered him from\r\nthe little black distance of the ’phone.\r\n\r\nHis arm was about Celia, and she felt his whole body stiffen with\r\nformality.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Miss Bentley! Good-morning! Your message? Why no! Ah! Well, I have\r\nbut just come in----”\r\n\r\nA pause during which Celia, panic-stricken, handed him the paper on\r\nwhich she had written Julia’s message.\r\n\r\n“Ah! Oh, yes, I have the message. Yes, it is very kind of you--” he\r\nmurmured stiffly, “but you will have to excuse me. No, really. It\r\nis utterly impossible! I have another engagement--” his arm stole\r\ncloser around Celia’s waist and caught her hand, holding it with a\r\nmeaningful pressure. He smiled, with a grimace toward the telephone\r\nwhich gladdened her heart. “Pardon me, I didn’t hear that,” he went\r\non.... “Oh, give up my engagement and come?... Not possibly!” His\r\nvoice rang with a glad, decided force, and he held still closer the\r\nsoft fingers in his hand.... “Well, I’m sorry you feel that way about\r\nit. I certainly am not trying to be disagreeable. No, I could not come\r\nto-morrow night either.... I cannot make any plans for the next few\r\ndays.... I may have to leave town again.... It is quite possible I may\r\nhave to return to New York. Yes, business has been very pressing. I\r\nhope you will excuse me. I am sorry to disappoint you. No, of course\r\nI didn’t do it on purpose. I shall have some pleasant news to tell\r\nyou when I see you again--or--” with a glance of deep love at Celia,\r\n“perhaps I shall find means to let you know of it before I see you.”\r\n\r\nThe color came and went in Celia’s cheeks. She understood what he meant\r\nand nestled closer to him.\r\n\r\n“No, no, I could not tell it over the ’phone. No, it will keep. Good\r\nthings will always keep if they are well cared for you know. No, really\r\nI can’t. And I’m very sorry to disappoint you to-night, but it can’t\r\nbe helped.... Good-by.”\r\n\r\nHe hung up the receiver with a sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n“Who is Miss Bentley?” asked Celia, with natural interest. She was\r\npleased that he had not addressed her as “Julia.”\r\n\r\n“Why, she is--a friend--I suppose you would call her. She has been\r\ntaking possession of my time lately rather more than I really enjoyed.\r\nStill, she is a nice girl. You’ll like her, I think; but I hope you’ll\r\nnever get too intimate. I shouldn’t like to have her continually\r\naround. She----” he paused and finished, laughing--“she makes me tired.”\r\n\r\n“I was afraid, from her tone when she ’phoned you, that she was a very\r\ndear friend--that she might be some one you cared for. There was a sort\r\nof proprietorship in her tone.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s the very word, proprietorship,” he laughed. “I couldn’t\r\ncare for her. I never did. I tried to consider her in that light one\r\nday, because I’d been told repeatedly that I ought to settle down, but\r\nthe thought of having her with me always was--well--intolerable. The\r\nfact is, you reign supreme in a heart that has never loved another\r\ngirl. I didn’t know there was such a thing as love like this. I knew I\r\nlacked something, but I didn’t know what it was. This is greater than\r\nall the gifts of life, this gift of your love. And that it should come\r\nto me in this beautiful, unsought way seems too good to be true!”\r\n\r\nHe drew her to him once more and looked down into her lovely face, as\r\nif he could not drink enough of its sweetness.\r\n\r\n“And to think you are willing to be my wife! My wife!” and he folded\r\nher close again.\r\n\r\nA discreet tap on the door announced the arrival of the man Henry, and\r\nGordon roused to the necessity of ordering lunch.\r\n\r\nHe stepped to the door with a happy smile and held it open.\r\n\r\n“Come in a minute, Henry,” he said. “This is my wife. I hope you will\r\nhenceforth take her wishes as your special charge, and do for her as\r\nyou have done so faithfully for me.”\r\n\r\nThe man’s eyes shone with pleasure as he bowed low before the gentle\r\nlady.\r\n\r\n“I is very glad to heah it, sah, and I offers you my\r\ncongratchumlations, sah, and de lady, too. She can’t find no bettah man\r\nin the whole United States dan Mars’ Gordon. I’s mighty glad you done\r\ngot ma’ied, sah, an’ I hopes you bof have a mighty fine life.”\r\n\r\nThe luncheon was served in Henry’s best style, and his dark face shone\r\nas he stepped noiselessly about, putting silver and china and glass in\r\nplace, and casting admiring glances at the lady, who stood holding the\r\nlittle miniature in her hand and asking questions with a gentle voice:\r\n\r\n“Your mother, you say? How dear she is! And she died so long ago!\r\nYou never knew her? Oh, how strange and sweet and pitiful to have a\r\nbeautiful girl-mother like that!”\r\n\r\nShe put out her hand to his in the shelter of the deep window, and\r\nthey thought Henry did not see the look and touch that passed between\r\nthem; but he discreetly averted his eyes and smiled benignly at the\r\nsalt-cellars and the celery he was arranging. Then he hurried out to\r\na florist’s next door and returned with a dozen white roses, which he\r\narranged in a queer little crystal pitcher, one of the few articles\r\nbelonging to his mother that Gordon possessed. It had never been used\r\nbefore, except to stand on the mantel.\r\n\r\nIt was after they had finished their delightful luncheon, and Henry had\r\ncleared the table and left the room, that Gordon remarked:\r\n\r\n“I wonder what has become of George Hayne. Do you suppose he means to\r\ntry to make trouble?”\r\n\r\nCelia’s hands fluttered to her throat with a little gesture of fear.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said. “I had forgotten him! How terrible! He will do\r\n_something_, of course. He will do _everything_. He will probably carry\r\nout all his threats. How could I have forgotten! Perhaps Mamma is now\r\nin great distress. What can we do? What can _I_ do?”\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him helplessly, and his heart bounded at the thought\r\nthat she was his to protect as long as life should last, and that she\r\nalready depended upon him.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be frightened,” he soothed her. “He cannot do anything very\r\ndreadful, and if he tries we’ll soon silence him. What he has written\r\nin those letters is blackmail. He is simply a big coward, who will run\r\nand hide as soon as he is exposed. He thought you did not understand\r\nlaw, and so took advantage of you. I’m sure I can silence him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, do you think so? But Mamma! Poor Mamma! It will kill her! And\r\nGeorge will stop at nothing when he is crossed. I have known him too\r\nlong. It will be _terrible_ if he carries out his threat.” Tears were\r\nin her eyes, agony was in her face.\r\n\r\n“We must telephone your mother at once and set her heart at rest. Then\r\nwe can find out just what ought to be done,” said Gordon soothingly.\r\n“It was unforgivably thoughtless in me not to have done it before.”\r\n\r\nCelia’s face was radiant at the thought of speaking to her mother.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how beautiful! Why didn’t I think of that before! What perfectly\r\ndear things telephones are!”\r\n\r\nWith one accord, they went to the telephone table.\r\n\r\n“Shall you call them up, or shall I?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“You call, and then I will speak to Mamma,” she said, her eyes shining\r\nwith her joy in him. “I want them to hear your voice again. They can’t\r\nhelp knowing you are all right when they hear your voice.”\r\n\r\nFor that, he gave her a glance very much worth having.\r\n\r\n“Just how do you account for the fact that you didn’t think I was all\r\nright yesterday afternoon? I have a very realizing sense that you\r\ndidn’t. I used my voice to the best of my ability, but it did no good\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, that was different! There were those letters to be\r\naccounted for. Mamma and Jeff don’t know anything about the letters.”\r\n\r\n“And what are you going to tell them now?”\r\n\r\nShe drew her brows down a minute and thought.\r\n\r\n“You’d better find out how much they already know,” he suggested. “If\r\nthis George Hayne hasn’t turned up yet, perhaps you can wait until\r\nyou can write, or we might be able to go up to-morrow and explain it\r\nourselves.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, could we? How lovely!”\r\n\r\n“I think we could,” said Gordon. “I’m sure I can make it possible. Of\r\ncourse, you know a wedding journey isn’t exactly in the program of the\r\nSecret Service, but I might be able to work them for one. I surely can\r\nin a few days if this Holman business doesn’t hold me up. I may be\r\nneeded for a witness. I’ll have to talk with the chief first.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how perfectly beautiful! Then you call them up, and just say\r\nsomething pleasant--anything, you know--and then say I’ll speak to\r\nMamma.”\r\n\r\nShe gave him the number, and in a few minutes a voice from New York\r\nsaid, “Hello!”\r\n\r\n“Hello!” called Gordon. “Is this Mr. Jefferson Hathaway?... Well, this\r\nis your new brother-in-law. How are you all?... Your mother recovered\r\nfrom all the excitement and weariness?... That’s good.... What’s\r\nthat?... You’ve been trying to ’phone us in Chicago?... But we’re not\r\nin Chicago. We changed our minds and came to Washington instead....\r\nYes, we’re in Washington--The Harris Apartments. We have been very\r\nselfish not to have communicated with you sooner. At least I have.\r\nCelia hasn’t had any choice in the matter. I’ve kept her so busy.\r\nYes, she’s very well, and seems to look happy. She wants to speak for\r\nherself. I’ll try to arrange to bring her up to-morrow for a little\r\nvisit. I want to see you too. We’ve a lot of things to explain to\r\nyou.... Here is Celia. She wants to speak to you.”\r\n\r\nCelia, her eyes shining, her lips quivering with suppressed excitement,\r\ntook the receiver.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Jeff dear, it’s good to hear your voice,” she said. “Is everything\r\nall right? Yes, I’ve been having a perfectly beautiful time, and I’ve\r\nsomething fine to tell you. All those nice things you said to me just\r\nbefore you got off the train are true. Yes, he’s just as nice as\r\nyou said, and a great deal nicer besides. Oh, yes, I’m very happy,\r\nand I want to speak to Mamma please. Jeff, is she all right? Is she\r\n_perfectly_ well, and not fretting a bit? You know you promised to tell\r\nme. What’s that? She thought I looked sad? Well, I did but that’s all\r\ngone now. Everything is perfectly beautiful. Tell mother to come to the\r\n’phone please--I want to make her understand.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to tell her, dear,” she whispered, looking up at Gordon.\r\n“I’m afraid George will get there before we do and make her worry.”\r\n\r\nFor answer he stooped and kissed her, his arm encircling her and\r\ndrawing her close. “Whatever you think best, dearest,” he whispered\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“Is that you, Mamma?” With a happy smile she turned back to the ’phone.\r\n“Dear Mamma! Yes, I’m all safe and happy, and I’m so sorry you have\r\nworried. We won’t let you do it again. But listen; I’ve something to\r\ntell you, a surprise--Mamma, I did not marry George Hayne at all. No,\r\nI say I _did not_ marry George Hayne at all. George Hayne is a wicked\r\nman. I can’t tell you about it over the ’phone but that was why I\r\nlooked sad. Yes, I was _married_ all right, but not to George. He’s oh,\r\nso different, Mother you can’t think. He’s right here beside me now,\r\nand Mother, he is just as dear--you’d be very happy about him if you\r\ncould see him. What did you say? Didn’t I mean to marry George? Why\r\nMother, I never wanted to. I was awfully unhappy about it, and I knew I\r\nmade you feel so too, though I tried not to. But I’ll explain all about\r\nit. You’ll be perfectly satisfied when you know all about it.... No,\r\nthere’s nothing whatever for you to worry about. Everything is right\r\nnow and life looks more beautiful to me than it ever did before. What’s\r\nhis name? Oh;” she looked up at Gordon with a funny little expression\r\nof dismay. She had forgotten and he whispered it in her ear.\r\n\r\n“Cyril--”\r\n\r\n“It’s Cyril, Mother! Isn’t that a pretty name? Which name? Oh, the\r\nfirst name of course. The last name?”\r\n\r\n“Gordon--” he supplied in her ear again.\r\n\r\n“Cyril Gordon, Mother,” she said, giggling in spite of herself at her\r\nstrange predicament.... “Yes, Mother. I am very, very happy. I couldn’t\r\nbe happier unless I had you and Jeff, too, and”--she paused, hesitating\r\nat the unaccustomed name--“and Cyril says we’re coming to visit you\r\nto-morrow. We’ll come up and see you and explain everything. And you’re\r\nnot to worry about George Hayne if he comes. Just let Jeff put him off\r\nby telling him you have sent for me, or something of the sort, and\r\ndon’t pay any attention to what he says. What? You say he did come? How\r\nstrange--and he hasn’t been back? I’m so thankful. He is dreadful. Oh,\r\nMother, you don’t know what I’ve escaped! And Cyril is good and dear.\r\nWhat? You want to speak to him? All right. He’s right here. Good-by,\r\nMother, dear, till to-morrow. And you’ll promise not to worry about\r\nanything? All right. Here is--Cyril.”\r\n\r\nGordon took the receiver.\r\n\r\n“Mother, I’m taking good care of her, just as I promised, and I’m going\r\nto bring her for a flying visit up to see you to-morrow. Yes, I’ll take\r\ngood care of her. She is very dear to me. The best thing that ever\r\ncame into my life.”\r\n\r\nThen a mother’s blessing came thrilling over the wires, and touched the\r\nhandsome, manly face with tenderness.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” he said. “I shall try always to make you glad you said\r\nthose words.”\r\n\r\nThey returned to looking in each other’s eyes, after the receiver was\r\nhung up, as if they had been parted a long time. It seemed somehow as\r\nif their joy must be greater than any other married couple, because\r\nthey had all their courting yet to do. It was beautiful to think of\r\nwhat was before them.\r\n\r\nThere was so much on both sides to be told; and to be told over again\r\nbecause only half had been told; and there were so many hopes and\r\nexperiences to be exchanged; so many opinions to compare, and to\r\nrejoice over because they were alike on many essentials. Then there\r\nwere the rooms to be gone through, and Gordon’s pictures and favorite\r\nbooks to look at and talk about, and plans for the future to be touched\r\nupon--just barely touched upon.\r\n\r\nThe apartment would do until they could look about and get a house,\r\nGordon said, his heart swelling with the proud thought that at last he\r\nwould have a real home, like his other married friends, with a real\r\nprincess to preside over it.\r\n\r\nThen Celia had to tell all about the horror of the last three months,\r\nwith the unpleasant shadows of the preceding years back of it. She told\r\nthis in the dusk of evening, before Henry had come in to light up,\r\nand before they had realized that it was almost dinner-time. She told\r\nit with her face hidden on her husband’s shoulder, and his arms close\r\nabout her, to give her comfort at each revelation of the story. They\r\ntried also to plan what to do about George Hayne; and then there was\r\nthe whole story of Gordon’s journey and commission from the time the\r\nold chief had called him into the office until he came to stand beside\r\nher at the church altar and they were married. It was told in careful\r\ndetail with all the comical, exasperating and pitiful incidents of\r\nwhite dog and little newsboy; but the strangest part about it all was\r\nthat Gordon never said one word about Julia Bentley and her imaginary\r\npresence with him that first day, and he never even knew that he had\r\nleft out an important detail.\r\n\r\nCelia laughed over the white dog and declared they must bring him home\r\nto live with them; and she cried over the story of the brave little\r\nnewsboy and was eager to visit him in New York, promising herself all\r\nsorts of pleasure in taking him gifts and permanently bettering his\r\ncondition; and it was in this way that Gordon incidentally learned that\r\nhis wife had a fortune in her own right, a fact that for a time gave\r\nhim great uneasiness of mind until she had soothed him and laughed at\r\nhim for an hour or more; for Gordon was an independent creature and had\r\nideas about supporting his wife by his own toil. Besides it seemed an\r\nunfair advantage to have taken a wife and a fortune as it were unaware.\r\n\r\nBut Celia’s fortune had not spoiled her, and she soon made him see that\r\nit had always been a mere incident in her scheme of living; comfortable\r\nand pleasant incident to be sure, but still an incident to be kept\r\nalways in the background, and never for a moment to be a cause for\r\nself-gratulation or pride.\r\n\r\nGordon found himself dreading the explanation that would have to come\r\nwhen he reached New York and faced his wife’s mother and brother. Celia\r\nhad accepted his explanations, because, somehow by the beautiful ways\r\nof the spirit, her soul had found and believed in his soul before the\r\ntruth was made known to her, but would her mother and brother be able\r\nalso to believe? And he fell to planning with Celia just how he should\r\ntell the story; and this led to his bringing out a number of letters\r\nand papers that would be worth while showing as credentials, and every\r\nstep of the way, as Celia got glimpse after glimpse into his past, her\r\nface shone with joy and her heart leaped with the assurance that her\r\nlot had been cast in goodly places, for she perceived not only that\r\nthis man was honored and respected in high places, but that his early\r\nlife had been peculiarly pure and true.\r\n\r\nThe strange loneliness that had surrounded his young manhood seemed\r\nsuddenly to have broken ahead of him, and to have opened out into the\r\nglory of the companionship of one peculiarly fitted to fill the need\r\nof his life. Thus they looked into one another’s eyes reading their\r\nlife-joy, and entered into the beautiful miracle of acquaintanceship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning quite early the ’phone called Gordon to the office.\r\nThe chief’s secretary said the matter was urgent.\r\n\r\nHe hurried away leaving Celia somewhat anxious lest their plans for\r\ngoing to New York that day could not be carried out, but she made up\r\nher mind not to fret even if the trip had to be put off a little, and\r\nsolaced herself with a short visit with her mother over the telephone.\r\n\r\nGordon entered his chief’s office a trifle anxiously, for he felt that\r\nin justice to his wife he ought to take her right back to New York and\r\nget matters there adjusted; but he feared that there would be business\r\nto hold him at home until the Holman matter was settled.\r\n\r\nThe chief greeted him affably and bade him sit down.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to have called you up so early,” he said, “but we needed\r\nyou. The fact is, they’ve arrested Holman and five other men, and you\r\nare in immediate demand to identify them. Would it be asking too much\r\nof an already overworked man to send you back to New York to-day?”\r\n\r\nGordon almost sprang from his seat in pleasure.\r\n\r\n“It just exactly fits in with my plans, or, rather, my wishes,” he\r\nsaid, smiling. “There are several matters of my own that I would like\r\nto attend to in New York and for which of course I did not have time.”\r\n\r\nHe paused and looked at his chief, half hesitating, marvelling that the\r\nway had so miraculously opened for him to keep silence a little longer\r\non the subject of his marriage. Perhaps the chief need never be told\r\nthat the marriage ceremony took place on the day of the Holman dinner.\r\n\r\n“That is good,” said the chief, smiling. “You certainly have earned the\r\nright to attend to your own affairs. Then we need not feel so bad at\r\nhaving to send you back. Can you go on the afternoon train? Good! Then\r\nlet us hear your account of your trip briefly, to see if there are any\r\npoints we didn’t notice yesterday. But first just step here a moment. I\r\nhave something to show you.”\r\n\r\nHe flung open the door to the next office.\r\n\r\n“You knew that Ferry had left the Department on account of his\r\nill-health? I have taken the liberty of having your things moved in\r\nhere. This will hereafter be your headquarters, and you will be next to\r\nme in the Department.”\r\n\r\nGordon turned in amazement and gazed at the kindly old face. Promotion\r\nhe had hoped for, but such promotion, right over the heads of his\r\nelders and superiors, he had never dreamed of receiving. He could have\r\ntaken the chief in his arms.\r\n\r\n“Pooh! Pooh!” said the chief. “You deserve it, you deserve it!” when\r\nGordon tried to blunder out some words of appreciation. Then, as if to\r\ncap the climax, he added:\r\n\r\n“And, by the way, you know some one has got to run across the water to\r\nlook after that Stanhope matter. That will fall to you, I’m afraid.\r\nSorry to keep you trotting around the globe, but perhaps you’ll like\r\nto make a little vacation of it. The Department’ll give you some time\r\nif you want it. Oh, don’t thank me! It’s simply the reward of doing\r\nyour duty, to have more duties given you, and higher ones. You have\r\ndone well, young man. I have here all the papers in the Stanhope case,\r\nand full directions written out, and then if you can plan for it you\r\nneedn’t return, unless it suits your pleasure. You understand the\r\nmatter as fully as I do already. And now for business. Let’s hurry\r\nthrough. There are one or two little matters we must talk over and I\r\nknow you will want to hurry back and get ready for your journey.” And\r\nso after all the account of Gordon’s extraordinary escape and eventful\r\njourney home became by reason of its hasty repetition a most prosaic\r\nstory composed of the bare facts and not all of those.\r\n\r\nAt parting the chief pressed Gordon’s hand with heartiness and ushered\r\nhim out into the hall, with the same brusque manner he used to close\r\nall business interviews, and Gordon found himself hurrying through the\r\nfamiliar halls in a daze of happiness, the secret of his unexpected\r\nmarriage still his own--and hers.\r\n\r\nCelia was watching at the window when his key clicked in the lock and\r\nhe let himself into the apartment his face alight with the joy of\r\nmeeting her again after the brief absence. She turned in a quiver of\r\npleasure at his coming.\r\n\r\n“Well, get ready,” he said joyfully. “We are ordered off to New York on\r\nthe afternoon train, with a wedding trip to Europe into the bargain;\r\nand I’m promoted to the next place to the chief. What do you think of\r\nthat for a morning’s surprise?”\r\n\r\nHe tossed up his hat like a boy, came over to where she stood, and\r\nstooping laid reverent lips upon her brow and eyes.\r\n\r\n“Oh, beautiful! lovely!” cried Celia, ecstatically, “come sit down on\r\nthe couch and tell me about it. We can work faster afterward if we\r\nget it off our minds. Was your chief very much shocked that you were\r\nmarried without his permission or knowledge?”\r\n\r\n“Why, that was the best of all. I didn’t have to tell him I was\r\nmarried. And he is not to know until just as I sail. He need never know\r\nhow it all happened. It isn’t his business and it would be hard to\r\nexplain. No one need ever know except your mother and brother unless\r\nyou wish them to, dear.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I am so glad and relieved,” said Celia, delightedly. “I’ve been\r\nworrying about that a little,--what people would think of us,--for of\r\ncourse we couldn’t possibly explain it all out as it is to us. They\r\nwould always be watching us to see if we really cared for each other;\r\nand suspecting that we didn’t, and it would be horrid. I think it is\r\nour own precious secret, and nobody but mamma and Jeff have a right to\r\nknow, don’t you?”\r\n\r\n“I certainly do, and I was casting about in my mind as I went into the\r\noffice how I could manage not to tell the chief, when what did he do\r\nbut spring a proposition on me to go at once to New York and identify\r\nthose men. He apologized tremendously for having to send me right back\r\nagain, but said it was necessary. I told him it just suited me for I\r\nhad affairs of my own that I had not had time to attend to when I was\r\nthere, and would be glad to go back and see to them. That let me out on\r\nthe wedding question for it would be only necessary to tell him I was\r\nmarried when I got back. He would never ask when.”\r\n\r\n“But the announcements,” said Celia catching her breath laughingly,\r\n“I never thought of that. We’ll just have to have some kind of\r\nannouncements or my friends will not understand about my new name; and\r\nwe’ll have to send him one, won’t we?”\r\n\r\n“Why, I don’t know. Couldn’t we get along without announcements?\r\nYou can explain to your intimate friends, and the others won’t\r\never remember the name after a few months--we’ll not be likely to\r\nmeet many of them right away. I’ll write to my chief and tell him\r\ninformally leaving out the date entirely. He won’t miss it. If we have\r\nannouncements at all we needn’t send him one. He wouldn’t be likely\r\never to see one any other way, or to notice the date. I think we can\r\nmanage that matter. We’ll talk it over with your--” he hesitated and\r\nthen smiling tenderly added, “we’ll talk it over with _mother_. How\r\ngood it sounds to say that. I never knew my mother you know.”\r\n\r\nCelia nestled her hands in his and murmured, “Oh, I am so happy,--so\r\nhappy! But I don’t understand how you got a wedding trip without\r\ntelling your chief about our marriage.”\r\n\r\n“Easy as anything. He asked me if I would mind running across the\r\nwater to attend to a matter for the service and said I might have extra\r\ntime while there for a vacation. He never suspects that vacation is to\r\nbe used as a wedding trip. I’ll write him, or ’phone him the night we\r\nleave New York. I may have to stay in the city two or three days to get\r\nthis Holman matter settled, and then we can be off. In the meantime you\r\ncan spend the time reconciling your mother to her new son. Do you think\r\nwe’ll have a very hard time explaining matters to her?”\r\n\r\n“Not a bit,” said Celia, gaily. “She never did like George. It was the\r\nonly thing we ever disagreed about, my marrying him. She suspected\r\nall the time I wasn’t happy and couldn’t understand why I insisted on\r\nmarrying him when I hadn’t seen him for ten years. She begged me to\r\nwait until he had been back in the country for a year or two, but he\r\nwould not hear to such a thing and threatened to carry out his worst at\r\nonce.”\r\n\r\nGordon’s heart suddenly contracted with righteous wrath over the\r\ncowardliness of the man who sought to gain his own ends by intimidating\r\na woman,--and this woman, so dear, so beautiful, so lovely in her\r\nnature. It seemed the man’s heart must indeed be black to have done\r\nwhat he did. He mentally resolved to search him out and bring him to\r\njustice as soon as he reached New York. It puzzled him to understand\r\nhow easily he seemed to have abandoned his purposes. Perhaps after\r\nall he was more of a coward than they thought, and had not dared to\r\nremain in the country when he found that Celia had braved his wrath and\r\nmarried another man. He would find out about him and set the girl’s\r\nheart at rest just as soon as possible, that any embarrassment at some\r\nfuture time might be avoided. Gordon stooped and kissed his wife again,\r\na caress that seemed to promise all reparation for the past.\r\n\r\nBut it suddenly occurred to the two that trains did not wait for\r\nlovers’ long loitering, and with one accord they went to work. Celia\r\nof course had very little preparation to make. Her trunk was probably\r\nin Chicago and would need to be wired for. Gordon attended to that the\r\nfirst thing, looking up the number of the check and ordering it back\r\nto New York by telegraph. Turning from the telephone he rang for the\r\nman and asked Celia to give the order for lunch while he got together\r\nsome things that he must take with him. A stay of several weeks would\r\nnecessitate a little more baggage than he had taken to New York.\r\n\r\nHe went into the bedroom and began pulling out things to pack but when\r\nCelia turned from giving her directions she found him standing in the\r\nbedroom doorway with an old-fashioned velvet jewel case in his hand\r\nwhich he had just taken from the little safe in his room. His face\r\nwore a wonderful tender light as if he had just discovered something\r\nprecious.\r\n\r\n“Dear,” he said, “I wonder if you will care for these. They were\r\nmother’s. Perhaps this ring will do until I can buy you a new one. See\r\nif it will fit you. It was my mother’s.”\r\n\r\nHe held out a ring containing a diamond of singular purity and\r\nbrilliance in quaint old-fashioned setting.\r\n\r\nCelia put out her hand with its wedding ring, the ring that he had put\r\nupon her finger at the altar, and he slipped the other jewelled one\r\nabove it. It fitted perfectly.\r\n\r\n“It is a beauty,” breathed Celia, holding out her hand to admire it,\r\n“and I would far rather have it than a new one. Your dear little\r\nmother!”\r\n\r\n“There’s not much else here but a little string of pearls and a pin or\r\ntwo. I have always kept them near me. Somehow they seemed like a link\r\nbetween me and mother. I was keeping them for--” he hesitated and then\r\ngiving her a rare smile he finished:\r\n\r\n“I was keeping them for you.”\r\n\r\nHer answering look was eloquent, and needed no words which was well,\r\nfor Henry appeared at that moment to serve luncheon and remind his\r\nmaster that his train left in a little over two hours. There was no\r\nfurther time for sentiment.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, these two, it seemed, could not be practical that day. They\r\nidled over their luncheon and dawdled over their packing, stopping to\r\nlook at this and that picture or bit of bric-a-brac that Gordon had\r\npicked up in some of his travels; and Henry finally had to take things\r\nin his own hands, pack them off and send their baggage after them.\r\nHenry was a capable man and rejoiced to see the devotion of his master\r\nand his new mistress, but he had a practical head and knew where his\r\npart came in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThe journey back to New York seemed all too brief for the two whose\r\nlives had just been blended so unexpectedly, and every mile was filled\r\nwith a new and sweet discovery of delight in one another; and then,\r\nwhen they reached the city they rushed in on Mrs. Hathaway and the\r\neager young Jeff like two children who had so much to tell they did not\r\nknow where to begin.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hathaway settled the matter by insisting on their going to dinner\r\nimmediately and leaving all explanations until afterward; and with the\r\nservants present of course there was little that could be said about\r\nthe matter that each one had most at heart. But there was a spirit of\r\ndeep happiness in the atmosphere and one couldn’t possibly entertain\r\nany fears under the influence of the radiant smiles that passed between\r\nmother and daughter, husband and wife, brother and sister.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the meal was concluded the mother led them up to her private\r\nsitting room, and closing the door she stood facing them all as half\r\nbreathless with the excitement of the moment they stood in a row before\r\nher:\r\n\r\n“My three dear children!” she murmured. Gordon’s eyes lit with joy and\r\nhis heart thrilled with the wonder of it all. Then the mother stepped\r\nup to him and placing her hand on his arm led him over to the couch and\r\nmade him sit beside her, while the brother and sister sat down together\r\nclose by.\r\n\r\n“Now, Cyril, my new son,” said she, deliberately, her eyes resting\r\napprovingly upon his face, “you may tell me your story. I see my girl\r\nhas lost both head and heart to you and I doubt if she could tell it\r\nconnectedly.”\r\n\r\nAnd while Celia and Jeff were laughing at this Gordon set about his\r\ntask of winning a mother, and incidentally an eager-eyed young brother\r\nwho was more than half committed to his cause already.\r\n\r\nCelia watched proudly as her handsome husband took out his credentials,\r\nand began his explanation.\r\n\r\n“First, I must tell you who I am, and these papers will do it better\r\nthan I could. Will you look at them, please?”\r\n\r\nHe handed her a few letters and papers.\r\n\r\n“These papers on the top show the rank and position that my father\r\nand my grandfather held with the government and in the army. This is\r\na letter from the president to my father congratulating him on his\r\napproaching marriage with my mother. That paper contains my mother’s\r\nfamily tree, and the letters with it will give you an idea of the\r\nhonor in which my mother’s family was held in Washington and in\r\nVirginia, her old home. I know these matters are not of much moment,\r\nand say nothing whatever about what I am myself, but they are things\r\nyou would have been likely to know about my family if you had known\r\nme all my life; and at least they will tell you that my family was\r\nrespectable.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Hathaway was examining the papers, and suddenly looked up\r\nexclaiming: “My dear! My father knew your grandfather. I think I saw\r\nhim once when he came to our home in New York. It was years ago and I\r\nwas a young girl, but I remember he was a fine looking man with keen\r\ndark eyes, and a heavy head of iron gray hair.”\r\n\r\nShe looked at Gordon keenly.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if your eyes are not like his. It was long ago of course.”\r\n\r\n“They used to say I looked like him. I do not remember him. He died\r\nwhen I was very young.”\r\n\r\nThe mother looked up with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n“Now tell me about yourself,” she said and laid a gentle hand on his.\r\n\r\nGordon looked down, an embarrassed flush spreading over his face.\r\n\r\n“There’s nothing great to tell,” he said. “I’ve always tried to live\r\na straight true life, and I’ve never been in love with any girl\r\nbefore--” he flashed a wonderful, blinding smile upon Celia.\r\n\r\n“I was left alone in the world when quite young and have lived around\r\nin boarding-schools and college. I’m a graduate of Harvard and I’ve\r\ntravelled a little. There was some money left from my father’s estate,\r\nnot much. I’m not rich. I’m a Secret Service man, and I love my work.\r\nI get a good salary and was this morning promoted to the position next\r\nin rank to my chief, so that now I shall have still more money. I shall\r\nbe able to make your daughter comfortable and give her some of the\r\nluxuries, if not all, to which she has been accustomed.”\r\n\r\n“My dear boy, that part is not what I am anxious about--” interrupted\r\nthe mother.\r\n\r\n“I know,” said Gordon, “but it is a detail you have a right to be told.\r\nI understand that you care far more what I am than how much money I can\r\nmake, and I promise you I am going to try to be all that you would want\r\nyour daughter’s husband to be. Perhaps the best thing I can say for\r\nmyself is that I love her better than my life, and I mean to make her\r\nhappiness the dearest thing in life to me.”\r\n\r\nThe mother’s look of deep understanding answered him more eloquently\r\nthan words could have done, and after a moment she spoke again.\r\n\r\n“But I do not understand how you could have known one another and I\r\nnever have heard of you. Celia is not good at keeping things from her\r\nmother, though the last three months she has had a sadness that I could\r\nnot fathom, and was forced to lay to her natural dread of leaving\r\nhome. She seemed so insistent upon having this marriage just as George\r\nplanned it--and I was so afraid she would regret not waiting. How could\r\nyou have known one another all this time and she never talked to me\r\nabout it, and why did George Hayne have any part whatever in it if you\r\ntwo loved one another? Just how long have you known each other anyway?\r\nDid it begin when you visited in Washington last spring, Celia?”\r\n\r\nWith dancing eyes Celia shook her head.\r\n\r\n“No, Mamma. If I had met him then I’m sure George Hayne would never\r\nhave had anything to do with the matter, for Cyril would have known how\r\nto help me out of my difficulty.”\r\n\r\n“I shall have to tell you the whole story from my standpoint, and from\r\nthe beginning,” said Gordon, dreading now that the crisis was upon him,\r\nwhat the outcome would be. “I have wanted you to know who and what\r\nI was before you knew the story, that you might judge me as kindly\r\nas possible, and know that however I may have been to blame in the\r\nmatter it was through no intention of mine. My story may sound rather\r\nimpossible. I know it will seem improbable, but it is nevertheless\r\ntrue, everything that I have to tell. May I hope to be believed?”\r\n\r\n“I think you may,” answered the mother searching his face anxiously.\r\n“Those eyes of yours are not lying eyes.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” he said simply, and then gathering all his courage he\r\nplunged into his story.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hathaway was watching him with searching interest. Jeff had drawn\r\nhis chair up close and could scarcely restrain his excitement, and when\r\nGordon told of his commission he burst forth explosively:\r\n\r\n“Gee! But that was a great stunt! I’d have liked to have been along\r\nwith you! You must be simply great to be trusted with a thing like\r\nthat!”\r\n\r\nBut his mother gently reproved him:\r\n\r\n“Hush, my son, let us hear the story.”\r\n\r\nCelia sat quietly watching her husband with pride, two bright spots of\r\ncolor on her cheeks, and her hands clasping each other tightly. She was\r\nhearing many details now that were new to her. Once more, when Gordon\r\nmentioned the dinner at Holman’s Jeff interrupted with:\r\n\r\n“Holman! Holman! Not J. P.? Why of course--we know him! Celia was\r\none of his daughter’s bridesmaids last spring! The old lynx! I always\r\nthought he was crooked! People hint a lot of things about him--”\r\n\r\n“Jeff, dear, let us hear the story,” again insisted his mother, and the\r\nstory continued.\r\n\r\nGordon had been looking down as he talked. He dreaded to see their\r\nfaces as the truth should dawn upon them, but when he had told all he\r\nlifted honest eyes to the white-faced mother and pleaded with her:\r\n\r\n“Indeed, indeed, I hope you will believe me, that not until they laid\r\nyour daughter’s hand in mine did I know that I was supposed to be the\r\nbridegroom. I thought all the time her brother was the bridegroom. If I\r\nhad not been so distraught, and trying so hard to think how to escape,\r\nI suppose I would have noticed that I was standing next to her, and\r\nthat everything was peculiar about the whole matter, but I didn’t.\r\nAnd then when I suddenly knew that she and I were being married, what\r\nshould I have done? Do you think I ought to have stopped the ceremony\r\nthen and there and made a scene before all those people? What was the\r\nright thing to do? Suppose my commission had been entirely out of the\r\nquestion, and I had had no duty toward the government to keep entirely\r\nquiet about myself, do you think I ought to have made a scene? Would\r\nyou have wanted me to for your daughter’s sake? Tell me please,” he\r\ninsisted, gently.\r\n\r\nAnd while she hesitated he added:\r\n\r\n“I did some pretty hard thinking during that first quarter of a second\r\nthat I realized what was happening, and I tell you honestly I didn’t\r\nknow what was the right thing to do. It seemed awful for her sake to\r\nmake a scene, and to tell you the truth I worshipped her from the\r\nmoment my eyes rested upon her. There was something sad and appealing\r\nas she looked at me that seemed to pledge my very life to save her from\r\ntrouble. Tell me, do you think I ought to have stopped the ceremony\r\nthen at the first moment of my realization that I was being married?”\r\n\r\nThe mother’s face had softened as she watched him and listened to his\r\ntender words about Celia and now she answered gently:\r\n\r\n“I am not sure--perhaps not! It was a very grave question to face. I\r\ndon’t know that I can blame you for doing nothing. It would have been\r\nterrible for her and us and everybody and have made it all so public.\r\nOh, I think you did right not to do anything publicly--perhaps--and\r\nyet--it is terrible to me to think you have been forced to marry my\r\ndaughter in that way.”\r\n\r\n“Please do not say forced,--_Mother_--” said Gordon laying both hands\r\nearnestly upon hers and looking into her eyes, “I tell you one thing\r\nthat held me back from doing anything was that I so earnestly desired\r\nthat what I was passing through might be real and lasting. I have\r\nnever seen one like her before. I know that if the mistake had been\r\nrighted and she had passed out of my life I should never have felt\r\nthe same again. I am glad, glad with all my heart that she is mine,\r\nand--Mother!--I think she is glad too!”\r\n\r\nThe mother turned toward her daughter, and Celia with starry eyes came\r\nand knelt before them, and laid her hands in the hands of her husband,\r\nsaying with ringing voice:\r\n\r\n“Yes, dear little Mother, I am gladder than I ever was before in my\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nAnd kneeling thus, with her husband’s arm about her, her face against\r\nhis shoulder, and both her hands clasped in his, she told her mother\r\nabout the tortures that George Hayne had put her through, until the\r\nmother turned white with horror at what her beloved and cherished child\r\nhad been enduring, and the brother got up and stormed across the floor,\r\nvowing vengeance on the luckless head of poor George Hayne.\r\n\r\nThen after the mother had given her blessing to the two, and Jeff\r\nhad added an original one of his own, there was the whole story of\r\nthe eventful wedding trip to tell, which they both told by solos and\r\nchoruses until the hour grew alarmingly late and the mother suddenly\r\nsent them all off to bed.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were both busy and happy ones for the two. They went\r\nto the hospital and gladdened the life of the little newsboy with fruit\r\nand toys and many promises; and they brought home a happy white dog\r\nfrom his boarding place whom Jeff adopted as his own. Gordon had a\r\ntrying hour or two at court with his one-time host, the scoundrel who\r\nhad stolen the cipher message; and the thick-set man glared at him from\r\na cell window as he passed along the corridor of the prison whither he\r\nhad gone in search of George Hayne.\r\n\r\nGordon in his search for the lost bridegroom, whom for many reasons he\r\ndesired to find as soon as possible, had asked the help of one of the\r\nmen at work on the Holman case, in searching for a certain George Hayne\r\nwho needed very much to be brought to justice.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you won’t have to search for him,” declared the man with a smile.\r\n“He’s safely landed in prison three days ago. He was caught as neatly\r\nas rolling off a log by the son of the man whose name he forged several\r\nyears ago. It was trust money of a big corporation and the man died in\r\nhis place in a prison cell, but the son means to see the real culprit\r\npunished.”\r\n\r\nAnd so Gordon, in the capacity of Celia’s lawyer, went to the prison\r\nto talk with George Hayne, and that miserable man found no excuse for\r\nhis sins when the searching talk was over. Gordon did not let the man\r\nknow who he was, and merely made it understood that Celia was married,\r\nand that if he attempted to make her any further trouble the whole\r\nthing would be exposed and he would have to answer a grave charge of\r\nblackmail.\r\n\r\nThe days passed rapidly, and at last the New York matter for which\r\nGordon’s presence was needed was finished, and he was free to sail away\r\nwith his bride. On the morning of their departure Gordon’s voice rang\r\nout over the miles of telephone wires to his old chief in Washington:\r\n“I am married and am just starting on my wedding trip. Don’t you want\r\nto congratulate me?” And the old chief’s gruff voice sounded back:\r\n\r\n“Good work, old man! Congratulations for you both. She may or may not\r\nbe the best girl in all the world; I haven’t had a chance to see yet;\r\nbut she’s a lucky girl, for she’s got _the best man I know_. Tell her\r\nthat for me! Bless you both! I’m glad she’s going with you. It won’t be\r\nso lonesome.”\r\n\r\nGordon gave her the message that afternoon as they sailed straight\r\ninto the sunshine of a new and beautiful life together.\r\n\r\n“Dear,” he said, as he arranged her steamer rug more comfortably about\r\nher, “has it occurred to you that you are probably the only bride who\r\never married the best man at her wedding?”\r\n\r\nCelia smiled appreciatively and after a minute replied mischievously:\r\n\r\n“I suppose every bride _thinks_ her husband is the best man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Italicized text is surrounded by underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n  Obvious typographical errors have been corrected.\r\n\r\n  Inconsistencies in hyphenation have been standardized.\r\n\r\n  Archaic or variant spelling has been retained.",
