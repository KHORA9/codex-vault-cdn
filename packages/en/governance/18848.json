V.--MARCH, 1864.--No. III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FINANCES AND RESOURCES.\r\n\r\nLETTER NO. III. OF HON. ROBERT J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LONDON, 10 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly,\r\n                                          _December 3d_, 1863.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed, even when the American rebellion should be\r\nsuppressed, that there would be a great loss of wealth and resources on\r\nthe part of the United States. As an economical question the great truth\r\nis not disputed by me, that, as a general rule, wars by a waste of\r\nproperty, by large expenditures, and by the withdrawal of so much labor\r\nfrom the pursuits of industry, impair the material interests of the\r\nnation. The influence of such considerations in the United States is not\r\ndenied; but there are in the cause of this contest, as well as in its\r\neffects and consequences, results which will more than compensate for\r\nsuch losses. Slavery was the sole cause of this rebellion, and the\r\nresult will be the reconstruction of the Union, with slavery everywhere\r\nextinguished. On this assumption, the question is, whether the\r\nsubstitution of free for slave labor throughout every State and\r\nTerritory of the Union will not, as a question of augmented wealth and\r\ninvigorated industry, far more than compensate for the losses incurred\r\nin the contest. Reasoning inductively, it might well be supposed that\r\nthe willing labor of educated and energetic freemen would be far more\r\nproductive than the forced labor of ignorant, unwilling, and uneducated\r\nslaves. In the realm of science, as well as in the direction of labor,\r\nknowledge is power, education is wealth and progress; and that this is\r\napplicable to the masses who compose a community, and especially to the\r\nworking classes, is demonstrated by our American official Census. In\r\nproof of this position, I will proceed by a reference to the official\r\ntables of our Census of 1860, to show not only in particular Slave\r\nStates, as compared with other Free States, whether old or new, Eastern\r\nor Western, or making the comparison of the aggregate of all the Slave\r\nwith the Free States, the annual product of the latter _per capita_ is\r\nmore than double that of the Slave States. I begin with Maryland as\r\ncompared with Massachusetts, because Maryland, in proportion to her\r\narea, has greater natural advantages than any one of the Slave or Free\r\nStates; and if the comparison with the Free States is most unfavorable\r\nto her, it will be more so as to any other Southern State; as the Census\r\nshows that, from 1790 to 1860, as well as from 1850 to 1860, Maryland\r\nincreased in population per square mile more rapidly than any other\r\nslaveholding State.\r\n\r\nWe must consider the area, soil, climate, mines, hydraulic power,\r\nlocation, shore line, bays, sounds, and rivers, and such other causes as\r\naffect the advance of wealth and population.\r\n\r\nThe relative progress of Maryland has been slow indeed. The population\r\nof the Union, by the Census of 1790, was 3,929,827, of which Maryland,\r\ncontaining then 319,728, constituted a twelfth part (12.29). In 1860,\r\nthe Union numbered 31,445,080, and Maryland 687,034, constituting a\r\nforty-fifth part (45.76). In 1790, the Free States numbered 1,968,455,\r\nMaryland's population then being equal to one sixth (6.12); but, in\r\n1860, the population of the Free States was 18,920,078, Maryland's\r\nnumber then being equal to one twenty-seventh part (27.52). But, if\r\nMaryland had increased as rapidly from 1790 to 1860 as the whole Union,\r\nher proportion, one twelfth part, would have made her numbers in 1860,\r\n2,620,315; and if her proportional increase had equalled that of the\r\nFree States, her ratio, one sixth, would have made her population in\r\n1860, 3,153,392.\r\n\r\nI take the areas from the report (November 29, 1860) of the Commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office, where they are for the first time accurately\r\ngiven, 'excluding the water surface.' The population is taken from the\r\nCensus Tables. I compare first Massachusetts and Maryland, because they\r\nare maritime and old States, and both in 1790 had nearly the same\r\npopulation, but, as will be shown hereafter, with vastly superior\r\nnatural advantages in favor of Maryland.\r\n\r\nArea of Maryland, 11,124 square miles; shore lines, by tables of United\r\nStates Coast Survey, viz.: main shore, including bays, sounds, etc., 503\r\nmiles, islands 298, rivers to head of tide water 535; total, 1,336\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nArea of Massachusetts, 7,800 square miles; shore lines, by tables of\r\nUnited States Coast Survey, viz.: main shore, including bays, sounds,\r\netc., 435 miles, islands 259, rivers to head of tide water 70; total,\r\n764 miles. When we mark the Potomac and its tributaries, the lower\r\nSusquehanna, the deep and numerous streams of the Chesapeake, the\r\ncommercial advantages of Maryland over Massachusetts are vast indeed.\r\nLooking at the ocean shore of Maryland, and also at the Chesapeake Bay,\r\nthe largest and finest estuary in the world, indented with numerous\r\nsounds and navigable inlets, three fourths of its length for both shores\r\nbeing within Maryland, and comparing this deep and tranquil and\r\nprotected basin, almost one continuous harbor, with the rockbound coast\r\nof Massachusetts, lashed by the stormy Atlantic, the superiority of\r\nMaryland is striking.\r\n\r\nMortality in Maryland, by the late Census, viz., deaths from 1st June,\r\n1859, to 31st May, 1860, 7,370 persons. Same time in Massachusetts,\r\n21,303; making the ratio of deaths to the number living in Maryland, one\r\nto every 92, and in Massachusetts one to every 57; and the percentage of\r\ndeaths in Maryland 1.09, and in Massachusetts 1.76. This rate of\r\nmortality for Massachusetts is confirmed by the late official report of\r\ntheir Secretary of State to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAs to area, then, Maryland exceeds Massachusetts 43 per cent.; as to the\r\nshore line, that of Maryland is nearly double that of Massachusetts. As\r\nto climate, that of Maryland, we have seen, is far the most salubrious.\r\nThis is a vast advantage, not only in augmented wealth and numbers, from\r\nfewer deaths, but also as attracting capital and immigration. This\r\nmilder and more salubrious climate gives to Maryland longer periods for\r\nsowing, working, and harvesting crops, a more genial sun, larger\r\nproducts, and better and longer crop seasons, great advantages for\r\nstock, especially in winter, decreased consumption of fuel, a greater\r\nperiod for the use of hydraulic power, and of canals and navigable\r\nstreams. The area of Maryland fit for profitable culture is more than\r\ndouble that of Massachusetts, the soil much more fertile, its mines of\r\ncoal and iron, with the fluxes all adjacent, rich and inexhaustible;\r\nwhereas Massachusetts has no coal, and no valuable mines of iron or\r\nfluxes. When we reflect that coal and iron are the great elements of\r\nmodern progress, and build up mighty empires, this advantage of Maryland\r\nover Massachusetts is almost incalculable. The hydraulic power of\r\nMaryland also greatly exceeds that of Massachusetts. Such are the vast\r\nnatural advantages of Maryland over Massachusetts. Now let us observe\r\nthe results. Population of Maryland in 1790, 319,728; in 1860, 687,034;\r\nincrease, 367,300. Population of Massachusetts in 1790, 378,717; in\r\n1860, 1,231,065; increase, 852,348; difference of increase in favor of\r\nMassachusetts, 485,048; excess of Massachusetts over Maryland in 1790,\r\n58,989, and in 1860, 544,031. This result is amazing, when we regard the\r\nfar greater area of Maryland and her other vast natural advantages. The\r\npopulation of Maryland in 1790 was 28 to the square mile (28.74), and in\r\n1860, 61 to the square mile (61.76); whereas Massachusetts had 48 to the\r\nsquare mile in 1790 (48.55), and 157 to the square mile in 1860\r\n(157.82). Thus Massachusetts had only 20 more to the square mile in\r\n1790, and 96 more to the square mile in 1860. But if the area of\r\nMaryland and Massachusetts had been reversed, Massachusetts with the\r\narea of Maryland, and the population of Massachusetts of 1860 to the\r\nsquare mile, would have numbered then 1,755,661, and Maryland with the\r\narea of Massachusetts, and the population of Maryland of 1860 to the\r\nsquare mile, would have had then a population of only 481,728 upon that\r\nbasis, leaving Massachusetts in 1860, 1,273,393 more people than\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nBy the census of 1790, Massachusetts was the fourth in population of all\r\nthe States, and Maryland the sixth; but in 1860, Massachusetts was the\r\nseventh, and Maryland the nineteenth; and if each of the thirty-four\r\nStates increases in the same ratio from 1860 to 1870 as from 1850 to\r\n1860, Maryland will be only the twenty-fifth State.\r\n\r\nThese facts all conclusively attest the terrible effects of slavery on\r\nMaryland, and this is only one of the dreadful sacrifices she has made\r\nin retaining the institution. As to wealth, power, and intellectual\r\ndevelopment, the loss cannot be overstated.\r\n\r\nNor can manufactures account for the difference, as shown by the still\r\ngreater increase of the agricultural Northwest. Besides, Maryland\r\n(omitting slavery) had far greater natural advantages for manufactures\r\nthan Massachusetts. She had a more fertile soil, thus furnishing cheaper\r\nfood to the working classes, a larger and more accessible coast, and\r\nnearly eight times the length of navigable rivers, greater hydraulic\r\npower, vast superiority in mines of coal and iron, a far more salubrious\r\nclimate, cotton, the great staple of modern industry, much nearer to\r\nMaryland, her location far more central for trade with the whole Union,\r\nand Baltimore, her chief city, nearer than Boston to the great West,\r\nviz.: to the Ohio at Pittsburg and Cincinnati, the Mississippi at St.\r\nLouis, and the lakes at Cleveland, Toledo, and Chicago, by several\r\nhundred miles. Indeed, but for slavery, Maryland must have been\r\na far greater manufacturing as well as commercial State than\r\nMassachusetts--and as to agriculture; there could be no comparison.\r\n\r\nBut Massachusetts did not become a manufacturing State until after the\r\ntariff of 1824. That measure, as well as the whole protective policy,\r\nMassachusetts earnestly opposed in 1820 and 1824, and Daniel Webster, as\r\nher representative, denounced it as unconstitutional. From 1790 to 1820,\r\nMassachusetts was commercial, not manufacturing, and yet, from 1790 to\r\n1820, Massachusetts increased in numbers 144,442, and Maryland in the\r\nsame time only 87,622. Yet, from 1790 to 1820, Massachusetts, the most\r\ncommercial State, was far more injured by the embargo and the late war\r\nwith England than any other State.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the accusation of the secession leaders that the\r\nNorth was built up at the expense of the South, by the tariff, can have\r\nno application to the progress of Massachusetts and Maryland, because\r\nthe advance of the former over the latter preceded by more than thirty\r\nyears the adoption of the protective policy, and a comparison of the\r\nrelative advance of the Free and Slave States, during the same period,\r\nexhibits the same results.\r\n\r\nThere is one _invariable law_, whether we compare all the Slave States\r\nwith all the Free States, small States with small, large with large, old\r\nwith old, new with new, retarding the progress of the slaveholding\r\nStates, ever operating, and differing in degree only.\r\n\r\nThe area of the nine Free States enumerated in 1790, is 169,668 square\r\nmiles, and of the eight slaveholding States, 300,580 square miles, while\r\nthe population of the former in 1790 was 1,968,455, and of the latter,\r\n1,961,372; but, in 1860, these nine Free States had a population of\r\n10,594,168, and those eight Slave States only 7,414,684, making the\r\ndifference in favor of these Free States in 1860 over those Slave\r\nStates, 3,179,844, instead of 7,083 in 1790, or a positive gain to those\r\nFree States over those Slave States of 3,172,761. These Free States\r\nenumerated in 1790 and 1860, were the six New England States, New York,\r\nNew Jersey, and Pennsylvania; and the Slave States were Delaware,\r\nMaryland, Virginia, North and South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and\r\nKentucky: yet we have seen that the area of those Slave States was\r\nnearly double that of those Free States, the soil much more fertile, the\r\nclimate more salubrious, as shown by the Census, that the shore line,\r\nincluding main shore, bays and sounds, islands and rivers, to head of\r\ntide water, was, for those Free States, 4,480 miles, and for those Slave\r\nStates, 6,560 miles. Thus it is clear that the increase of population of\r\nthese Slave States should have far exceeded that of those Free States.\r\nThe population of these Slave States per square mile in 1790 was 6\r\n(6.52), and in 1860, 24 (24.66), and of those Free States in 1790, was\r\n11 per square mile (11.60), and in 1860, 62 per square mile (62.44).\r\nThus, while the increase of those Slave States from 1790 to 1860 was\r\nonly 18 per square mile, that of those Free States was nearly 51 per\r\nsquare mile (50.84), or in very nearly a triple ratio, while in wealth\r\nand education the proportionate progress was much greater.\r\n\r\nNo cause except slavery can be assigned to this wonderful difference,\r\nfor the colonists of Maryland were distinguished for education,\r\nintelligence, and gentle culture. Lord Baltimore was a statesman and\r\nphilanthropist, and his colony was a free representative government,\r\nwhich was the first to repudiate the doctrine of taxation without\r\nrepresentation, and the first to introduce religious toleration. While\r\nMaryland has produced many of the most eminent soldiers, statesmen, and\r\njurists, her relative decline in power, wealth, and population has been\r\ndeplorable, and is attributable exclusively to the paralyzing effect of\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\nWhile the advance of Massachusetts, with her limited area and sterile\r\nsoil, especially in view of the thousands of her native sons who have\r\nemigrated to other States, is one of the wonders of the world, yet the\r\nrelative increase of the population of New Jersey from 1790 to 1860,\r\ncompared with that of Maryland, is still greater than that of\r\nMassachusetts. The law is inflexible wherever slavery disappears.\r\nPopulation of New Jersey in 1790, 184,139, in 1860, 672,035, being an\r\nincrease of 264 per cent. (264.96) for New Jersey, of 225 per cent.\r\n(225.06) for Massachusetts, and for Maryland 114 percent. (114.88). The\r\nratio of increase per square mile from 1790 to 1860 was: Massachusetts,\r\n48.55 in 1790, and 157.82 in 1860; Maryland, 28.74 in 1790, and 61.76 in\r\n1860; and New Jersey, 22.01 in 1790, and 80.70 in 1860. Thus, while\r\nMaryland from 1790 to 1860, little more than doubled her ratio of\r\nincrease per square mile (28.74 to 61.76), and Massachusetts little more\r\nthan tripled her ratio (48.55 to 157.82), New Jersey very nearly\r\n_quadrupled_ hers (22.01 to 80.70). It must be conceded, however, that\r\nthe natural advantages of New Jersey are far greater than those of\r\nMassachusetts, whose material and intellectual progress, in defiance of\r\nsuch serious obstacles, now is, and most probably forever will be,\r\n_without a parallel_. Now the area of New Jersey is but 8,320 square\r\nmiles; the soil of Maryland is far more fertile, the hydraulic power\r\nmuch greater, the shoreline much more than double, viz.: 531 for New\r\nJersey, to 1,336 for Maryland; while New Jersey, with rich iron mines,\r\nhas no coal, and one third of her area is south of the celebrated Mason\r\nand Dixon's line, the northern boundary of Maryland. While the Free\r\nStates have accomplished these miracles of progress, they have peopled\r\neleven vast Territories (soon by subdivision to become many more\r\nStates), immigration to which has been almost exclusively from the North\r\nas compared with the South.\r\n\r\nThe Slave State which has increased _most_ rapidly to the square mile of\r\nall of them from 1790 to 1860, has had a smaller augmentation per square\r\nmile than that Free State which has increased most _slowly_ per square\r\nmile during the same time of all the Free States, and the result is the\r\nsame as to wealth and education also. Under the _best_ circumstances for\r\nthe Slave States, and the _worst_ for the Free States, this result\r\nproves the uniformity of the rule (like the great law of gravitation),\r\nknowing no exception to the effect of slavery in depressing the progress\r\nof States in population, wealth, and education.\r\n\r\nThe isothermals of the great Humboldt (differing so widely from\r\nparallels), which trace the lines of temperature on the earth's surface,\r\nprove, as to heat, the climate of the South (running a line from\r\nCharleston to Vicksburg) to be substantially the same as that of Greece\r\nand Italy-each, in its turn, the mistress of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Census of 1860 exhibits our increase of population from 1790 to 1860\r\nat 35.59 per cent., and of our wealth 126.45. Now, if we would increase\r\nthe wealth of the country only one tenth in the next ten years, by the\r\ngradual disappearance of slavery (far below the results of the Census),\r\nthen our wealth being now $16,159,616,068, the effect of such increase\r\nwould be to make our wealth in 1870, instead of $36,593,450,585, more\r\nthan sixteen hundred millions greater, and in 1880, instead of\r\n$82,865,868,849, over three billions six hundred millions, or more than\r\nthree times our present debt.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of this letter, it will be shown that the difference,\r\n_per capita_, of the annual products of Massachusetts and Maryland\r\nexceeds $150. As to the other Southern States, the excess is much\r\ngreater. Now, if the annual products of the South were increased $150\r\neach _per capita_ (still far below Massachusetts) by the exclusion of\r\nslavery, then multiplying the total population of the South, 12,229,727,\r\nby 150, the result would be an addition to the annual value of the\r\nproducts of the South of $1,834,456,050, and in the decade,\r\n$18,344,580,500. This change would not be immediate, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that with the vastly greater natural advantages of the South, the\r\nsuperiority of free to slave labor, the immense immigration, especially\r\nfrom Europe to the South, aided by the Homestead Bill, and the\r\nconversion of large plantations into small farms, an addition of at\r\nleast one billion of dollars would be made in a decade, by the\r\nexclusion of slavery, to the value of the products of the South.\r\n\r\nHaving considered the relative progress in population of Massachusetts\r\nand Maryland, I will now examine their advance in wealth.\r\n\r\nBy Tables 33 and 36, Census of 1860, the value of the products of\r\nMassachusetts that year was $287,000,000; and of Maryland, $66,000,000.\r\nTable 33 included domestic manufactories, mines, and fisheries (p. 59);\r\nand Table 36, agricultural products. Dividing these several aggregates\r\nby the total population of each State, the value of that year's product\r\nof Massachusetts was $235 _per capita_, and of Maryland, $96, making the\r\naverage annual value of the labor of each person in the former greatly\r\nmore than double that of the latter, and the gross product more than\r\nquadruple. This is an amazing result, but it is far below the reality.\r\nThe earnings of commerce and navigation are omitted in the Census, which\r\nincludes only the products of agriculture, manufactures, the mines, and\r\nfisheries. This was a most unfortunate omission, attributable to the\r\nsecession leaders, who wished to confine the Census to a mere\r\nenumeration of population, and thus obliterate all the other great\r\ndecennial monuments which mark the nation's progress in the pathway of\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nSome of these tables are given as follows:\r\n\r\n_First, as to Railroads._--The number of miles in Massachusetts in 1860\r\n(including city roads) was 1,340, and the cost of construction\r\n$61,857,203. (Table 38, pp. 230, 231.) The value of the freight of these\r\nroads in 1860 was $500,524,201. (P. 105.) The number of miles of\r\nrailroad in Maryland at the same time was 380, the cost of construction\r\n$21,387,157, and the value of the freight (at the same average rate)\r\n$141,111,348, and the difference in favor of Massachusetts $359,412,883.\r\nThe difference must have been much greater, because a much larger\r\nportion of the freight in Massachusetts consisted of domestic\r\nmanufactures, worth $250 per ton, which is $100 a ton above the average\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe passengers' account, not given, would vastly swell the difference in\r\nfavor of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe tonnage of vessels built in Massachusetts in 1860 was 34,460 tons,\r\nand in Maryland, 7,798 tons. (P. 107).\r\n\r\nThe number of banks in Massachusetts in 1860 was 174; capital,\r\n$64,619,200; loans, $107,417,323. In Maryland the number was 31;\r\ncapital, $12,568,962; loans, $20,898,762. (Table 34, p. 193.)\r\n\r\nThe number of insurance companies in Massachusetts, 117; risks,\r\n$450,886,263. No statement given for Maryland, but comparatively very\r\nsmall, as the risks in Massachusetts were nearly one sixth of all in the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nOur exports abroad, from Massachusetts, for the fiscal year ending 30th\r\nJune, 1860, were of the value of $17,003,277, and the foreign imports\r\n$41,187,539; total of imports and exports, $58,190,816; the clearances,\r\n746,909 tons, the entries, 849,449; total entered and cleared, 1,596,458\r\ntons. In Maryland, exports, $9,001,600, foreign imports, $9,784,773;\r\ntotal imports and exports, $18,786,323; clearances, 174,000 tons;\r\nentries, 186,417; total of entries and clearances, 360,417. (Table 14,\r\nRegister of Treasury.) Thus, the foreign imports and exports abroad, of\r\nMassachusetts, were much more than triple those of Maryland, and the\r\nentries and clearances very largely more than quadruple. The coastwise\r\nand internal trade are not given, as recommended by me when Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, but the tables of the railroad traffic indicate in part\r\nthe immense superiority of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThese statistics, however, prove that, if the earnings of commerce and\r\nnavigation were added, the annual value of the products of Massachusetts\r\n_per capita_ would be at least $300, and three times that of Maryland.\r\nIn estimating values _per capita_, we must find the earnings of\r\ncommerce very large, as a single merchant, in his counting house,\r\nengaged in an immense trade, and employing only a few clerks, may earn\r\nas much as a great manufacturing corporation, employing hundreds of\r\nhands. Including commerce, the value, _per capita_, of the products and\r\nearnings of Massachusetts exceeds not only those of _any State in our\r\nUnion_, BUT OF THE WORLD; and would, at the same rate, make the\r\nvalue of its annual products three hundred billions of dollars; and of\r\nour own country, upward of nine billions of dollars per annum. Such,\r\nunder great natural disadvantages, is the grand result achieved in\r\nMassachusetts, by education, science, industry, free schools, free soil,\r\nfree speech, _free labor_, free press, and free government. The facts\r\nprove that freedom is progress, that 'knowledge is power,' and that the\r\nbest way to appreciate the value of property and augment wealth most\r\nrapidly, is to invest a large portion of it in schools, high schools,\r\nacademies, colleges, universities, books, libraries, and the press, so\r\nas to make labor more productive, because more skilled, educated, and\r\nbetter directed. Massachusetts has achieved much in this respect; but\r\nwhen she shall have made high schools as free and universal as common\r\nschools, and the attendance on both compulsory, so as to qualify every\r\nvoter for governing a State or nation, she will have made a still\r\ngrander step in material and intellectual progress, and the results\r\nwould be still more astounding.\r\n\r\nBy Table 35 of the Census, p. 195, the whole value of all the property,\r\nreal and personal, of Massachusetts, in 1860, was $815,237,433, and that\r\nof Maryland, $376,919,944. We have seen that the value of the products\r\nthat year in Massachusetts was $287,000,000 (exclusive of commerce), and\r\nof Maryland, $66,000,000. As a question, then, of profit on capital,\r\nthat of Massachusetts was 35 per cent., and of Maryland 17 per cent.\r\nSuch is the progressive advance (more than two to one) of free as\r\ncompared with slave labor. The same law obtains in comparing all the\r\nFree with all the Slave States. But the proof is still more complete.\r\nThus, Delaware and Missouri (alone of all the Slave States) were ahead\r\nof Maryland in this rate of profit, because both had comparatively fewer\r\nslaves; and all the other Slave States, whose servile population was\r\nrelatively larger than that of Maryland, were below her in the rate of\r\nprofit. The law extends to _counties_, those having comparatively fewest\r\nslaves increasing far more rapidly in wealth and population. This, then,\r\nis the formula as to the rate of profit on capital. First, the Free\r\nStates; next, the States and counties of the same State having the\r\nfewest relative number of slaves. The Census, then, is an evangel\r\nagainst slavery, and its tables are revelations proclaiming laws as\r\ndivine as those written by the finger of God at Mount Sinai on the\r\ntables of stone.\r\n\r\nFor seventy years we have had these Census Tables, announcing these\r\ngreat truths more and more clearly at each decade. They are the records\r\nof the nation's movement and condition, the decennial monuments marking\r\nher steps in the path of empire, the oracles of her destiny. They are\r\nprophecies, for each decade fulfils the predictions of its predecessor.\r\nThey announce laws, not made by man, but the irrevocable ordinances of\r\nthe Almighty. We cannot, with impunity, refuse to obey these laws. For\r\nevery violation, they enforce their own penalties. From these there is\r\nno escape in the present or the past, nor for the future, except in\r\nconformity to their demands. These laws condemn slavery; and the\r\npunishment for disobedience is recorded in the result of every Census,\r\nand finally culminated in the rebellion. Slavery and freedom are\r\nantagonistic and discordant elements: the conflict between them is upon\r\nus; it admits of no neutrality or compromise, and one or the other\r\nsystem must perish.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that slavery is hostile to the progress of wealth and\r\npopulation: let us now ascertain its influence on moral and intellectual\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nBy Table 15 of the Census of 1860, the result for that year was as\r\nfollows: In Massachusetts, value of books printed, $397,500; jobs,\r\n$529,347; newspapers, $1,979,069; total, $2,905,916. Same year in\r\nMaryland, books printed, $58,000; jobs, $122,000; newspapers, $169,000;\r\ntotal, $350,155. By Table 37, Census of 1860, Massachusetts had 222\r\nnewspapers and periodicals, of which 112 were political, 31 religious,\r\n51 literary, miscellaneous 28. Maryland had only 57, all political. The\r\nwhole number of copies issued in Massachusetts in 1860 was 102,000,760,\r\nand in Maryland, 20,721,472. Of periodicals, Massachusetts has monthly,\r\n1 political, 10 religious, 18 literary, 7 miscellaneous; quarterly,\r\nreligious 3, literary 2, miscellaneous 1, and 1 annual. Maryland had\r\n_none_. Not a religious, literary, scientific, or miscellaneous\r\nperiodical or journal in the State! What terrible truths are unfolded in\r\nthese statistics! None but a political party press in Maryland, all\r\ndevoted, in 1860, to the maintenance, extension, and perpetuity of\r\nslavery, which had 57 advocates, and not one for science, religion, or\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the circulation in 1860 of the press in Massachusetts\r\nexceeded that of Maryland by more than eighty-one millions of copies.\r\nThese facts all prove that slavery is hostile to knowledge and its\r\ndiffusion, to science, literature, and religion, to the press, and to\r\nfree government.\r\n\r\nFor schools, colleges, libraries, and churches, I must take the Tables\r\nof the Census of 1850, those of 1860 not being yet published. There were\r\nin 1850 in Massachusetts, 3,679 public schools, 4,443 teachers, 176,475\r\npupils; native adults who cannot read or write, 1,861. In Maryland, 907\r\npublic schools, 1,005 teachers, 33,254 pupils; native adults who cannot\r\nread or write, 38,426, excluding slaves, to teach whom is criminal.\r\n\r\nThus, then, slavery is hostile to schools, withholding instruction from\r\nthe children of the poor.\r\n\r\nThe number of public libraries in Massachusetts was 1,462, volumes\r\n684,015. In Maryland, 124, and 125,042 volumes. Value of churches in\r\nMassachusetts, $10,206,000. In Maryland, $3,947,884, of which $2,541,240\r\nis in Baltimore (which has very few slaves), and the remainder is mainly\r\nin the seven counties (from which slavery has nearly disappeared)\r\nadjoining Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAs to schools, colleges, books, libraries, churches, newspapers, and\r\nperiodicals, it thus appears that Massachusetts is greatly in advance of\r\nMaryland.\r\n\r\nNow, then, let us contrast loyal Maryland with rebel South Carolina, the\r\nauthor of secession, and assuming for many years to instruct the nation.\r\nBy the Census of 1860, she had a population of 703,708, of whom 402,406\r\nwere slaves; and Maryland, numbering 687,049, had 87,189 slaves. Now, by\r\nthe Census of 1860, South Carolina had 45 journals and periodicals, and\r\nher annual circulation was 3,654,840 copies. The circulation therefore\r\nof Massachusetts exceeded that of South Carolina more than ninety-eight\r\nmillions of copies, while Maryland exceeded South Carolina more than\r\nseventeen millions of copies. So much for South Carolina as a great\r\npolitical teacher. As to schools in 1850: South Carolina had 724 public\r\nschools, 739 teachers, 17,838 pupils. Massachusetts, then, had 158,637\r\nmore pupils at public schools than South Carolina, and Maryland 15,416\r\nmore pupils at public schools than South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe press of Massachusetts, we have seen, circulated in 1860 upward of\r\none hundred and two millions of copies, equal to 279,454 per day,\r\nincluding journals and periodicals, each read, on an average, by at\r\nleast two persons. This is independent of books and pamphlets, and of\r\nthe very large circulation of papers from other States and from Europe.\r\nWhat a flood of light is thus shed daily and hourly upon the people of\r\nMassachusetts! This intellectual effulgence radiates by day and night.\r\nIt is the sun in its meridian splendor, and the stars in an\r\never-unclouded firmament. It has a centre and a circumference, but no\r\ndarkness. Ignorance vanishes before it; wealth follows in its train;\r\nlabor rejoices in its association, and finds its products more than\r\ndoubled; freedom hails its presence, and religion gives it a cordial\r\nwelcome; churches, schools, academies, colleges, and universities\r\nacknowledge its mighty influence. Science penetrates the secrets of\r\nnature, and unfolds each new discovery for the benefit of man. Coal, the\r\noffspring of the sun, develops its latent energy, and water contributes\r\nits untiring hydraulic power. Machinery takes more and more the place of\r\nnerves and muscles, cheapens clothing and subsistence and all the\r\nnecessaries of life, and opens new fields of industry, and more\r\nprofitable employment for labor. Steam and lightning become the slaves\r\nof man. He performs the journey of a day in an hour, and converses in\r\nminutes around the globe. The strength of man may not have been much\r\nincreased, but his power is augmented a thousand fold.\r\n\r\nHis life may not have been materially lengthened, but, in the march of\r\nknowledge, a year now is as a century, compared with man's progress in\r\nthe darkness of the middle ages. The eternal advance toward omniscience\r\ngoes on, but is like that of the infinite approach of the asymptote,\r\nwhich never reaches the hyperbolic curve. The onward of science is in a\r\ngeometrical ratio, so that in time, the intellectual progress of a day\r\nin the future, must exceed that of a century in the past. Knowledge is\r\nenthroned as king, and grand truths and new ideas are his ministers.\r\nScience takes the diameter of the earth's orbit as a base line and unit\r\nof measurement, and with it spans immensity, and triangulates the\r\nnebulous systems amid the shadowy verges of receding space. Its\r\nresearches are cosmical upon the earth and the heavens, and all the\r\nelements minister to its progress. Sink to the lowest mine, or fathom\r\nthe ocean's depth, or climb the loftiest mountains, or career through\r\nthe heavens on silken wings, and it is there also. On--on--on;\r\nnearer--nearer--still nearer it moves forever and forever, with\r\naccelerated speed, toward the infinite eternal. Such are the triumphs of\r\nknowledge; and he who diffuses it among our race, or discovers and\r\ndisseminates new truths, advances man nearer to his Creator; he exalts\r\nthe whole race; he elevates it in the scale of being, and raises it into\r\nhigher and still higher spheres.\r\n\r\nIt is science that marks the speed of sound and light and lightning,\r\ncalculates the eclipses, catalogues the stars, maps the heavens, and\r\nfollows, for centuries of the past and the future, the comet's course.\r\nIt explores the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. With geology,\r\nit notes the earthquake upheaval of mountains, and, with mineralogy, the\r\nlaws of crystallization. With chemistry, it analyzes, decomposes, and\r\ncompounds the elements. If, like Canute, it cannot arrest the tidal\r\nwave, it is subjecting it to laws and formulas. Taking the sunbeam for\r\nits pencil, it heliographs man's own image, and the scenery of the earth\r\nand the heavens. Has science any limits or horizon? Can it ever\r\npenetrate the soul of man, and reveal the mystery of his existence and\r\ndestiny? It is certainly exploring the facts of sociology, arranging and\r\ngeneralizing them, and deducing laws.\r\n\r\nMan, elevated by knowledge in the scale of being, controls the forces of\r\nnature with greater power and grander results, and accumulates wealth\r\nmore rapidly. The educated free labor of Massachusetts, we have seen,\r\ndoubles the products of toil, _per capita_, as compared with Maryland,\r\nand quadruples them (as the Census shows) compared with South Carolina.\r\nOne day's labor of a man in Massachusetts is more than equal to two in\r\nMaryland, and four in South Carolina. So, if we take our savage tribes,\r\nwith their huts and tents, their rude agriculture, their furs, their few\r\nand simple household manufactures, their hunting and fishing, the\r\naverage product of their annual labor, at four cents a day each, would\r\nbe $14.60 a year, or more than a fourth of that of South Carolina\r\n(56.91). So that Massachusetts, in material progress, is farther in\r\nadvance of South Carolina than that State is of the savage Indians. Thus\r\nwe have the successive steps and gradations of man: Massachusetts, with\r\nfree labor and free schools, having reached the highest point of\r\ncivilization: South Carolina, with slavery and ignorance (except the\r\nfew), in a semi-barbarous stage; and the lowest savage condition, called\r\nbarbarous, but nearer to South Carolina than that State to\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nSlavery, then, the Census proves, is hostile to the progress of wealth\r\nand population, to science, literature, and education, to schools,\r\ncolleges, and universities, to books and libraries, to churches and\r\nreligion, to the press, and therefore to free government; hostile to the\r\npoor, keeping them in want and ignorance; hostile to labor, reducing it\r\nto servitude, and decreasing two thirds the value of its products;\r\nhostile to morals, repudiating among slaves the marital and parental\r\ncondition, classifying them by law as chattels, darkening the immortal\r\nsoul, and making it a crime to teach millions of human beings to read or\r\nwrite. And shall labor and education, literature and science, religion\r\nand the press, sustain an institution which is their deadly foe?\r\n\r\nThe discussion will be continued in my next letter.\r\n                                                R. J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPALMER, THE AMERICAN SCULPTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSculpture as an art is probably anterior to painting. Form being a\r\nsimpler quality than color, the means of imitation were found in a\r\nconformity of shape rather than hue. The origin of sculpture is somewhat\r\nobscured in the thickening mists of antiquity, but it was no doubt one\r\nof the earliest symbols of ideas made use of by man. In fact, in its\r\nprimitive development, there is considerable evidence to show that it\r\nwas the first essay at a recorded language. The Egyptian hieroglyphics,\r\nthose mysterious etchings upon the rock, representing animals, men, and\r\nnondescript characters, were unquestionably rude attempts to hand down\r\nto posterity some account of the great events of those forgotten ages.\r\nThe next remove in the history of this art is its employment in the\r\nproduction of the images of idolatrous worship; and, when confined to\r\nthis purpose, it never attained any appreciable excellence. The purely\r\nheathen mind was incapable of conceiving those forms of ideal beauty\r\nwhich are born of the contemplation of a divine and spiritual beauty\r\nrevealed in the word of God and the teachings of his immaculate Son.\r\n\r\nThe grotesque Egyptian images worshipped on the Nile before the building\r\nof the pyramids, are, judging from the best preserved antiquities, not\r\nvery much inferior to the gilded deities to be seen to-day in the\r\nthousand pagodas of heathen lands.\r\n\r\nTake for example a Chinese idol of modern make: while it is less angular\r\nand more elaborately finished than the ancient monstrosities found in\r\nEgypt, still, so far as perfection of form or beauty of expression is\r\nconcerned, there is little to choose between the two. Each is a fitting\r\ntype of the degree of civilization and soul culture of the peoples that\r\nproduced them. It must not be urged that the success of sculpture in\r\nGreece and Rome disproves the proposition that the art could not develop\r\nitself among a strictly idolatrous race.\r\n\r\nThe splendid mythologies of the Greeks and Romans must not be considered\r\nas the highest forms even of the worship of idols or inanimate things.\r\nThe gods and goddesses of these mythological systems were principally\r\nthe powers that were supposed to preside over the different forces and\r\nelements of nature, and were invested with the celestial attributes of a\r\nhigher order of beings. Neptune ruled the sea, Pluto was director of\r\nceremonies in the infernal regions, while Jupiter was emperor of the sky\r\nand king of all the lesser gods.\r\n\r\nThese deities were the invention of a cultivated intellect, a refined\r\ntaste and polished civilization, and furnish a striking proof of man's\r\nlonging after the Infinite, unguided by the star of revelation.\r\n\r\nThe imaginative Greeks did not worship the statues of the gods _per se_,\r\nbut only admired them as the fitting representations of those mysterious\r\nforces that hold sway over earth, air, fire, and water, or reverenced\r\nthem as the symbols of noble sentiments or sublime passions. The thing\r\nitself, the cunning but lifeless figure, was only incidental, while the\r\nidea thus typified was the real incentive to worship. This was also the\r\nage that produced hero worship, and the great man who won the praise and\r\nadmiration of the people by his exalted qualities, or his prowess in\r\narms, was considered as a demigod, or one in favor with the tenants of\r\nOlympus, and his statue was accordingly erected, to stand beside that,\r\nperhaps, of Mars, Apollo, or Mercury.\r\n\r\nThus we trace the history of sculpture in its steady progress from its\r\nuse as a chronicler of events to its employment in the production of the\r\nobjects of idolatry, and thence to the mythological period, when it\r\nbecame the medium of æsthetic expression, attaining its highest\r\nperfection in the palmy days of Greece.\r\n\r\nIn no people of which the records of the past give any account, can we\r\nfind such an active sense of the beautiful as that which permeated the\r\nminds of the polished Greeks. The admiration of physical beauty became\r\nan almost absorbing passion, and its attainment was sought after in\r\nevery process which human ingenuity could devise.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedemonian women were accustomed to place the statues of beautiful\r\ngods or goddesses in their rooms, to the end that the children they\r\nshould give birth to, would, by nature's mysterious methods, assimilate\r\nthe artistic graces of these celestial models. Perfection of form and\r\nmanly strength were the pride of the wisest and most learned men of the\r\nnation, denoting that physical excellence was considered the necessary\r\nconcomitant of moral or intellectual worth. Authentic annals tell us\r\nthat Plato and Pythagoras appeared as wrestlers at the public games; and\r\nwho shall say that these philosophical gymnasts did not derive much of\r\ntheir mental vigor from this exciting exercise? In this age it is easy\r\nto see that sculpture must have received every incentive to full\r\ndevelopment. In the people about him the artist saw the most excellent\r\nmodels for his chisel, while the national taste was educated to the\r\nhighest degree in the beauties of form and the harmonies of proportion.\r\n\r\nBut the grand conceptions of Phidias, full of majesty and of grandeur as\r\nthey are--the matchless finish of the works of Apelles and Praxiteles,\r\nravishing the senses with their carnal beauty, still lacked one element,\r\nwithout which art can never reveal itself in the full perfection of its\r\nlatent capabilities.\r\n\r\nMere physical beauty, which contains no spiritual element, no drawing of\r\nthe immortal soul, no suggestion of purer and nobler sentiments\r\nstruggling for expression in the cunning marble, can never satisfy the\r\nrequirements of the Christianized taste of modern times.\r\n\r\nThe Venus de Medici was undoubtedly the ideal type of womanly perfection\r\nin the age which produced it, but now the sex would hardly feel\r\nthemselves flattered by so poor an interpretation. The form is all that\r\ncould be desired, but the head and features are positively insipid, and\r\na phrenologist would tell you by the development of the cranium that\r\nfemale education was not a part of the Grecian policy. There is in this\r\nstatue a certain air of wantonness, a perceptible consciousness of being\r\nvalued and admired solely for physical beauty, which just as plainly\r\ntells the estimate placed upon woman in those times as we can read the\r\nfact in history.\r\n\r\nThus we perceive sculpture as a representative art has become a\r\nchronicler of the world's advancement, so that those who accept the\r\ntheory of human progression would naturally look for purer and more\r\nspiritual conceptions in the artist's soul, with a corresponding\r\nnobility in the creations of his genius. The æsthetic principle in its\r\nhigher manifestations is not the product of pagan mind, because ideal\r\nbeauty and the rules governing its expression can only be conceived by\r\nhim to whom Faith has opened the glorious possibilities of our existence\r\nbeyond the grave. In no classic picture or statue is there anything akin\r\nto that divine affinity that is apparent in the Madonnas of the Italian\r\nmasters of the sixteenth century, investing them with a charm that\r\nlingers like an autumn sunset In the recollection of long-departed\r\nyears. Compare the loveliest of the Madonnas of Correggio and Raphael\r\nwith the Venus of Cos, and we perceive the inferiority of mere physical\r\nperfection to that spiritual beauty that exalts the soul of the\r\nbeholder, and awakens the slumber of his immortal longings.\r\n\r\nFaultless finish, harmonious outlines, and voluptuous proportions are\r\nonly the result of mechanical skill, that a good imitator or copyist can\r\nfor the most part achieve by the aid of his master's model. But the\r\nsentiment, emotion, passion, the _character_, so to speak, of the\r\nstatue, is the creation of the artist, the offspring of his quickened\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nIt is to express the æsthetic idea struggling in the soul of genius,\r\nthat the marble takes its form, the canvas its color, sweet sounds\r\ncombine in melody, and language weaves itself into the wreath of song.\r\nThe same divine impulse, the same grasping after a higher excellence\r\ninspires the sculptor, the painter, the composer, and the poet, but some\r\nchance bent of nature has decided them to choose different mediums of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nSome critic has written, had Coles' 'Voyage of Life' been executed in\r\nverse, instead of a series of pictures, it would have ranked as one of\r\nthe grandest poems of the age. High art, then, whatever its kind, is the\r\nlanguage of the æsthetic feeling in man--it symbolizes the god-like\r\nelement in his nature. Cumulative and progressive, it keeps even pace\r\nwith an improving civilization, and should therefore furnish fairer\r\nproducts to-day than in any period of the past. It assimilates the\r\nspirit of the times in which it is exercised; for as Ralph Waldo Emerson\r\nremarks in his subtle, essay: 'No man can quite emancipate himself from\r\nhis age and country, or produce a model in which the education, the\r\nreligion, the politics, usages, and arts of his times shall have no\r\nshare.'\r\n\r\nSo we see from the very necessity of this truism, that if our painters\r\nand sculptors would not be mere imitators of the exponents of another\r\nage, there would be soon established a national school of art. We do not\r\nmean by this a mere conventional type in finish and mode of treatment,\r\nbut certain marked, characteristic excellences and features that would\r\nidentify it with the history of our country and the peculiarities of our\r\npeople. There are a few native artists who have struggled to achieve\r\nthis consummation, and preëminent among these is Erastus D. Palmer, the\r\nAmerican sculptor.\r\n\r\nThe history of his career, his origin, his process of study, his choice\r\nof subjects in all his great works, his rise and triumph as an artist,\r\nall entitle him to this distinctive appellation. He commenced life as a\r\ncarpenter and joiner, but, while practising his trade in Utica, N. Y.,\r\nhis eye accidentally fell on a cameo likeness, and as the dropping of an\r\napple suggested to Newton the laws of gravitation, so the sight of this\r\nlittle trifle was the talisman that revealed to Palmer the artistic\r\ncapabilities of his genius. Being thus led to attempt the portrait of\r\nhis wife upon a shell, he executed his task--which was in a twofold\r\nsense a labor of love--with such fidelity to nature, such bold outline,\r\nand delicacy of finish, that connoisseurs detected in it the hand of a\r\nmaster. Thus encouraged, he for two years made cameo cutting his\r\nbusiness, and followed it with remarkable success, till, his eyes\r\nbecoming affected by the exercise of this talent, he was obliged to\r\nrelinquish it, with the expectation of returning to his old trade. But\r\nhappily he was induced to try his skill at modelling in clay, and then\r\nhe discovered what was in him. Taking his little girl for a model, he\r\nproduced a bust, styled the 'Infant Ceres,' which, when finished in\r\nmarble, immediately took rank as one of the gems of art. The sweet\r\n_naïvete_ of budding childhood, the timid eyes and dimpled cheek, all\r\nrefined and sublimated by the ideal graces added by the magic wand of\r\ngenius, combined to make this earliest bust of our sculptor one of the\r\nmost felicitous products of his chisel.\r\n\r\nSoon after this satisfactory experiment, Palmer removed to the city of\r\nAlbany, where he has since remained and won his well-deserved fame. His\r\ntwo allegorical pieces, 'Resignation' and 'Spring,' we cannot forbear to\r\ndescribe, familiar as they are to the _virtuoso_ of art, and well known\r\neven to the great public.\r\n\r\nThe latter is a female bust, her hair bound with a fillet of grass and\r\nhalf-developed grain, her face wearing an expression of modest coquetry,\r\nquite in keeping with the capricious, 'celestial maid;' while the gently\r\nswelling bosom suggests the latent forces of nature which only reach\r\ntheir fulness in the summer sun. And about the eyes there is a look of\r\njoy and freshness in which you fancy you can see\r\n\r\n            'the flowers begin to spring,\r\n  The skies to brighten, and the birds to sing.'\r\n\r\nThe 'Resignation' represents the refined voluptuousness of riper\r\nwomanhood. The features are exquisitely cut, and represent a type of\r\nbeauty fit for angelic spheres. The head, so finely proportioned, and\r\ncrowned with luxuriant, waving hair, inclines gracefully to one side, as\r\nin submission to the chastenings of Providence. But in the downcast,\r\nsorrowful eyes, there is an expression of mingled hope and patient\r\nendurance such as Mary might have worn at the foot of the cross. The\r\nmarble is eloquent of that Christian sentiment: 'He doeth all things\r\nwell.' The religious feeling of the sixteenth century, which gave to art\r\nboth its inspiration and theme, never found so fair a mould as in this\r\nbust of 'Resignation.'\r\n\r\nBoth of these works are entirely free from all explanatory accessories,\r\nand interpret themselves to the most sluggish soul.\r\n\r\nAnother of Palmer's compositions, and one of the most purely ideal, is\r\nthe 'Dream of the Spirit's Flight.' This is a large bas-relief, executed\r\nin medallion style. To give any idea by mere words of the spirit of this\r\nperformance is impossible. It is the half figure of a peri-like girl,\r\nwith tresses swaying in the higher air, with butterfly wings, arms and\r\ndrapery gracefully disposed, and all the parts uniting to impress you\r\nwith a sense of upward, soaring motion! There is a divine beauty about\r\nthe face reflected from a brighter world. Sculptured in pure white\r\nmarble, it seems a very soul just escaped from its prison house of clay,\r\nand, listening to those 'sounds seraphic,' bearing away to the great\r\nBeyond.\r\n\r\nWhile gazing on this airy sprite, the beholder feels an exhilarating\r\ninfluence steal over him, and involuntarily there goes up from his\r\nheart, like incense, that yearning prayer:\r\n\r\n  'So grant me, God, from every care,\r\n    And stain of passion free,\r\n  Aloft through virtue's purer air\r\n    To hold my course to Thee!'\r\n\r\nWe cannot speak separately of his 'Morning and Evening,' 'Immortality,'\r\n'Sleeping Peri,' his statue and bas-relief of 'Faith,' busts, and other\r\nworks, which are grouped in odd companionship about his studio. But the\r\n'Indian Girl' and 'White Captive,' the crowning achievements of Palmer's\r\ngenius, and the ones that give a thoroughly American character to his\r\nreputation, demand an elaborate consideration--not to explain their\r\nmerits, but to show what materials for art exist in our history, when\r\nappropriated by the master's hand.\r\n\r\nRomance and poetry have not often been successful in treating of the\r\ncharacter and customs of our aborigines, for the elements of true\r\nheroism in the savage nature are so exceptional and few, that the red\r\nman is a very poor subject for the higher manifestations of art. Cooper\r\nand Longfellow alone have come back from this field with the trophies of\r\npraise. But Palmer, with a striking originality and a subtle perception\r\nof spiritual influences, sees in the effect of Christianity on the\r\n'untutored mind' of the Indian, a theme to inspire his plastic clay. So\r\nfrom this idea he evolves the 'Indian Girl,' standing in an attitude of\r\nperfect repose, holding in her right hand a crucifix, on which her eyes\r\nare bent pensively in a sweet, absorbing reverie, which shuts out the\r\nconsciousness of the external world. In the other hand, which hangs\r\nlistlessly by her side, she barely touches rather than holds a bunch of\r\nfeathers, evidently gathered to adorn her person, and which she forgets\r\nin the contemplation of the story of the Cross. The artist supposes she\r\nhas found this crucifix, which the early Catholic missionaries were wont\r\nto attach to the forest trees, and having heard from some of these\r\nzealous teachers an exposition of Christ's mission, the better life has\r\nalready begun to dawn in her soul, and her whole aspect tells that this\r\nmysterious influence is upon her.\r\n\r\nThe features are Indian, fair and comely--we do not say beautiful,\r\nbecause this term expresses the highest excellence, and ought as a\r\ndescriptive phrase to be more sparingly used. The face is idealized, as\r\nthe rules of true art always require, but still preserves its fidelity\r\nto the natural type. The form is nude to the waist, the drapery arranged\r\nwith unrivalled grace, the hair is clubbed so as to reveal the neck and\r\nshoulders, while the perfection of contour and the completeness of\r\ndevelopment satisfy the most critical eye for the study of detail. The\r\n'Indian Girl' forms one of the landmarks in the history of American\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nBut Palmer's grand, characteristic work, in which his genius seems to\r\nhave reached its noblest expression, is the 'White Captive,' which we\r\nbelieve to be one of the most perfect creations of ancient or modern\r\nart. It is something more than the nude figure of a surpassingly\r\nbeautiful woman, bound to the stake, and defying the gaze of her\r\nbarbarous captors--it is not merely an exciting incident in pioneer\r\nlife, but it has a grand symbolical meaning that reaches beyond a\r\nliteral interpretation of the situation.\r\n\r\nWe see in this statue the contact of civilization with savage instinct,\r\nand in the expression of the 'White Captive,' peering through maiden\r\ntimidity, and rising triumphant above physical fear in a look of\r\nintellectual and religious strength, before which the swarthy warrior\r\nfeels himself in the presence of a superior power--a ruler! As we gaze\r\non in mute admiration, we behold the race of the red man receding\r\nwestward before that same power pictured in this wonderful face: now the\r\nIndian tribes pass the Rocky mountains, they come within the roar of the\r\nPacific, and, growing less and less, they at last vanish away into the\r\nuncertain mists of the ocean--a lost people, who have served the purpose\r\nfor which they were created, and disappeared from our continent to make\r\nroom for a nobler humanity. It is this melancholy fate, this glorious\r\ntriumph, that Palmer has recorded in a language more forcible than\r\nhistory, more eloquent than song, more ravishing than the lyre! To\r\ndefine how the statue spreads before you this great vision, eludes the\r\nacutest analysis; but there it is, told just as plainly as the Falls of\r\nNiagara or the eternal stars tell the omnipotence of God.\r\n\r\nThe longer one studies this marvellous work, the more he sees to admire,\r\nto reflect upon. There is something in the general effect that makes the\r\nbeholder forget the perfect nudity of the figure, which necessarily\r\ngrows out of the circumstances of the case, and which is entirely unfelt\r\nby the captive in her terrible realization of the peril which surrounds\r\nher. Thus two great difficulties that embarrass the execution of\r\nundraped statuary are entirely overcome:\r\n\r\n1. The nudity is only incidental to the general effect, and the subject\r\nseems entirely unconscious of the fact.\r\n\r\n2. The nudity is accounted for by the situation--the captive is tied\r\nunclad to a tree, to be burned alive, according to Indian custom.\r\n\r\nThus a criticism that has been frequently made (and not unjustly) on the\r\n_morale_ of certain works of art, has no application to this.\r\n\r\nOf the details of this ideal creation--its matchless finish, the\r\ngraceful undulations of the perfect form, the firmness expressed in the\r\nclenched fingers, the instinctive shudder gathered on the fair brow, the\r\nlofty defiance of the eyes and half-parted lips, the radiant beauty of\r\nthe face--we can only say they live in our memory, but too deep for\r\nwords. We believe the truth of the artist's conception, that the\r\nrevengeful savages acknowledged the divinity of her beauty and Christian\r\nreliance, and the 'White Captive' went free--the spirit of civilization\r\ntriumphed!\r\n\r\nAs a man's character is always more or less associated with his\r\nachievements, the reader may wish to learn something of Mr. Palmer as a\r\nman. In all kinds of soul-work, there is ever perceptible a certain\r\nflavor of the mind which produces it, and the things thus created\r\nusually suggest the qualities of the creator. So the works of the\r\nsculptor are to some degree the exponents of his character, the\r\nexpressions of his inner life.\r\n\r\nTherefore in Mr. Palmer we should expect moral and intellectual worth of\r\na high order, added to the purest and most exalted motives. He is in\r\nspirit a reformer, taking an interest in every measure for the\r\nimprovement of our race, and sympathizing with every struggle of our\r\naspiring manhood.\r\n\r\nThe eccentricities, excuses, and conventional affectations of many real\r\nand pretended geniuses he entirely eschews, feeling himself one of the\r\npeople, and laboring for their elevation.\r\n\r\nNeither does he deem it any part of genius to neglect his family, forget\r\nto pay his butcher's bill, and ignore the claim of his tailor. His ample\r\nhouse and neat atelier, at the north end of Eagle street, in the city of\r\nAlbany, are the fruit of his patient and inspiring toil--his chisel has\r\nwon him moderate fortune as well as world-wide fame.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of the 'Palmer Marbles' are seen in the show windows of\r\nParis, London, and Berlin, while in this country they help to fill the\r\nportfolios of the _virtuoso_, adorning the walls of the parlor and the\r\nprivate gallery.\r\n\r\nThough in youth Palmer did not receive an average common-school\r\neducation, he converses like a man of liberal culture, showing that he\r\nbelongs to the class of self-made men.\r\n\r\nHe has never visited the interminable art palaces of Europe, nor\r\nstudied, in the sense in which that term is used, the 'old masters;'\r\nstill he has appropriated all the valuable hints to be obtained from the\r\nclassic models, without regarding them as the _ne plus ultra_ of\r\nartistic execution, and therefore to be only imitated, to the exclusion\r\nof the higher ideals of an advanced civilization.\r\n\r\nHe has an intelligible and correct theory in regard to the fidelity of\r\nart to nature. For instance, he insists that he should _represent_, not\r\nimitate; and in making a bust of a man, the sculptor should express the\r\nhigher moods of his subject, and show him with his better qualities\r\nbrought to the surface. So the forms of nature should be idealized in\r\nthe direction of their primitive tendency, and thus art help to express\r\nthat ineffable longing of the soul, that reaching upward for a\r\nperfection that is approximated on earth, but never attained. This\r\nidealization is like the humor of Dickens, something more than nature in\r\nits grotesqueness, yet a stimulated growth of the natural quality.\r\nPalmer always takes nature for his model, and then assimilates it to\r\nthat ideal beauty which dwells in his imagination and sheds a spiritual\r\nhalo over the creation of his chisel.\r\n\r\nLike every true disciple of genius, he feels that he has a mission to\r\nperform, and that he is responsible for the influence he exerts on the\r\ntastes and æsthetic culture of the people. As you chat with him in his\r\nstudio, dressed in his blouse and cap, his dark eye glowing with\r\nenthusiasm for his art, or sparkling with playful humor, standing before\r\nyou tall and vigorous, you see in him one of the earnest workers for the\r\nelevation of our humanity.\r\n\r\nThe utilities of the world will take care of themselves: let us foster\r\nthe beautiful, because, like all divine attributes, man reaches it\r\nthrough striving, and is made better by its contemplation.\r\n\r\nPalmer does not look older than forty, and has perhaps not yet attained\r\nthe fulness of his powers, but has in him the elements of a healthy\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nWork on, thou almoner of sweetest joys, thou pilgrim in that fairy realm\r\nwhence come the high ideals of life; work on, striver for the perfect\r\ntype of beauty and of truth, and in thy progress let the people trace\r\nour human nature rising to diviner heights--expanding to sublimer\r\nbounds!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUDS.\r\n\r\nRESPECTFULLY DEDICATED TO PROFESSOR GUYOT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  High and fathomless above us vaults the pure aerial sky,\r\n  Solemn bends its arch of Beauty round a world where all things die.\r\n\r\n  On the dome through which Earth's swinging, spun of palpitating air,\r\n  Angel artists fresco vapors into pictures passing fair.\r\n\r\n  No cold canvas of dead color has the Mighty Master given:\r\n  Trembles with His Infinity the azure vault of Heaven.\r\n\r\n  On and in the lucent background float the ever-changeful forms,\r\n  Sometimes glowing into glory, sometimes glooming into storms.\r\n\r\n  God's blest seal is on creation; signs and symbols throng the sky,\r\n  Though too dull to read their meaning droops the stolid human eye.\r\n\r\n  Over mountain, over valley throng the clouds to soothe the sight;\r\n  Through the dim walls of the city gleam they buoyant, fleeting, bright.\r\n\r\n  Gentle, dreadful, or fantastic--nearer, farther as we gaze;\r\n  Varied, spiritual, tender, forms and melts the surging haze.\r\n\r\n  'Heavenly secrets' breathe around us--lowly flowers on the sod,\r\n  Cloudland's curves and grading colors veil the Infinite of God.\r\n\r\n  The Infinite--we shudder! but wild longings through us steal\r\n  As we vainly strive to grasp It till our failing senses reel.\r\n\r\n  Ever longing, never grasping, though in tenderness It stoop\r\n  To shade the scented cups of flowers, to bend them as they droop.\r\n\r\n  For through infinite gradations pass the changeful hues of light,\r\n  That the infinite through color may send greetings to the sight.\r\n\r\n  Through ne'er-returning, endless curves, flowers, trees, clouds,\r\n      mountains pass,\r\n  That man may see the Infinite through nature's magic glass.\r\n\r\n  Oh, tender stooping! soothing! Infinite Love must be\r\n  The cause, aim, end, the burning heart of everything we see.\r\n\r\n  Earth may cover deep her dying, parted hearts chant weary dirge,\r\n  But we _feel death is but seeming_ in the Cloudland's evening surge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _CIRRI._\r\n\r\n  Floating high above the mountains, in the fields of upper air,\r\n  Multitudinous throng the Cirri, ranged in order, heavenly fair.\r\n\r\n  Rank upon rank in glory lie the transverse, plumy bars;\r\n  Tranquil beauty rules the union which disorder never mars.\r\n\r\n  Perfect symmetry, obedience, mark their finely chiselled lines--\r\n  In the highest sphere of being flexile _grace_ with _law_ combines.\r\n\r\n  Now they break in fleecy ripples as innumerably they press;\r\n  Shines the blue of Heaven between them as they fly the Wind's caress.\r\n\r\n  Millions fleck the face of Heaven, but no two alike are ever:\r\n  Restless mirror of the Infinite, form seems exhausted never.\r\n\r\n  Are they lambs 'mid Heaven's blue pastures? are they swans with\r\n      downy breast\r\n  Floating through that azure ocean round the region of the Blest?\r\n\r\n  Are they snowy wings of Cherubs gathering round the Throne above,\r\n  As the vesper hymn of Heaven rises to the Eternal Love?\r\n\r\n  Gazing on their wavy ripples, they seem mingling with the sky,\r\n  Yet the heavenly little islets still innumerable lie.\r\n\r\n  How the fleecy cloudlets glitter as they sail so clear and high!\r\n  Is light curdling into snowflakes as it streams athwart the sky?\r\n\r\n  Freezing? No--warm and glowing, ambient, changeful, feathery, bright,\r\n  Rather seem the floating vapors melting into roseate light.\r\n\r\n  With the white flame in their bosoms, and the pure blue depths above,\r\n  When the sunset rays dart kisses, how they kindle into love!\r\n\r\n  See, with every shaft electric flash the bright hues deeper, higher,\r\n  Till the chaste and snowy cloudlets fleck the Blue of Heaven with fire.\r\n\r\n  How they flush and how they quiver! how the virgin drifts of snow\r\n  Drink the sunset's dying passion, catch his ardent parting glow!\r\n\r\n  Love weaves close in chords harmonic all the finely fretted dome,\r\n  Blue, white, purple, gold, and crimson, fringe, melt, ripple into foam.\r\n\r\n  Thus the angels drape God's footstool with soft vapor, wind, and sun:\r\n  Does His smile rest on the artists when their pleasant work is done?\r\n\r\n  Do they see Him bend the Heavens, riding swiftly on the clouds,\r\n  Heat His Heart, and Light the shadow which His inner Glory shrouds?\r\n\r\n  Seraphs, cherubs, thronging round Him, shall our hearts no raptures move?\r\n  Shall we prove dull links reluctant in the chain of endless love?\r\n\r\n  No. We feel the electric secret flashing through the Perfect Whole,\r\n  'Bliss eternal' telegraphing upon every faithful soul.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _CUMULI._\r\n\r\n  Leave we now the upper regions\r\n    With their wonders pure and high,\r\n  Gone the barred and fleecy Cirri--\r\n    Mountain Cumuli storm the sky.\r\n  High the calmness floats above us,\r\n    Tears and rain lie far below,\r\n  As we sail the middle Cloudland,\r\n    Where the vapors come and go.\r\n\r\n  Throbs a wilder pulse of passion,\r\n    Stronger individual life,\r\n  Rapid, energetic motion\r\n    Tells of elemental strife.\r\n  Nearer seem they to the human,\r\n    Rearing dizzy forms on high,\r\n  Than the order-loving Cirri\r\n    Barring the translucent sky.\r\n\r\n  Lovingly they crest our mountains,\r\n    Hovering o'er them all the day,\r\n  Copying all the soaring outlines\r\n    In artistic, skilful play;\r\n  Following close on the horizon,\r\n    Dip, break, gap, and lofty peak,\r\n  As to build Earth into Heaven\r\n    Would the haunting vapors seek.\r\n\r\n  Drifting swiftly through the azure,\r\n    Chase they shadows over Earth:\r\n  Flying footsteps, soft and silent,\r\n    Flit o'er grassy graves in mirth.\r\n  Shudder not--the bearded harvest\r\n    Quivers not, so light the tread:\r\n  Let it glide o'er moss and violet--\r\n    Would its touch could wake our dead!\r\n\r\n  Piling now, the tossing vapors,\r\n    With a wild exultant power,\r\n  Rise in turrets, towers, mountains,\r\n    Changing with the changing hour.\r\n  Glittering, gleaming, dazzling, snowy,\r\n    Heart-tossed shadows in them lie;\r\n  Broken, scattered, wind-torn, foamy,\r\n    Haunt they through Earth's panting sky.\r\n\r\n  Luminous jets of boiling vapor\r\n    Topple into sudden rifts,\r\n  Open into yawning chasms,\r\n    Break in tortured whirling drifts,\r\n  Panting, surging, rocking, reeling,\r\n    Cradling in their hearts the storm,\r\n  Spirit, power, passion flashing,\r\n    Lightning bares each secret form.\r\n\r\n  Banding now in groups colossal,\r\n    Piling o'er the mountain crest,\r\n  Sweeping down his rocky summit,\r\n    Crashing through his wooded breast,\r\n  Shattering fall his pines and larches,\r\n    Rain, hail, tumult onward swell,\r\n  Lightning scathes the shuddering forest,\r\n    Thunder frights the leafy dell.\r\n\r\n  Sunset fires the whirling vapors,\r\n    Now they sway and rock in light,\r\n  Toppling crests fling back the radiance,\r\n    Through the rifts it glitters bright,\r\n  Gloomy clouds are ruby kindling,\r\n    Rippling fringed with molten gold,\r\n  Rosy streams of color pouring,\r\n    Through the tempest's blackness rolled.\r\n\r\n  Surging weird in fitful beauty,\r\n    Every moment fraught with change,\r\n  Every break and mystic chasm\r\n    Opening up a Heaven-range:\r\n  Now the eastern peaks are kindling\r\n    Glow as though the Morning's heart\r\n  Throbbed against them, while the formless\r\n    Clouds to phantom being start.\r\n\r\n  Thus through storm-tost human bosoms\r\n    God oft sends His rays divine;\r\n  Passionate errors, when forgiven,\r\n    Lead us on to trust sublime.\r\n  God rays light through moral tempests,\r\n    Brings repentance out of crime;\r\n  'Much forgiven' ploughs the spirit,\r\n    Former faults as beacons shine.\r\n\r\n  Through our ruins Love is gleaming,\r\n    Rippling o'er in molten gold,\r\n  Rosy streams of life are pouring\r\n    Through our tempest's blackness rolled.\r\n  Glittering thus in growing beauty,\r\n    Every moment fraught with change,\r\n  Through each rift and shattered chasm\r\n    We may see the Heaven-range.\r\n\r\n  Thus the angels build the pictures\r\n    In the vext or tranquil skies,\r\n  Of our changeful human passions,\r\n    Stormful fall and heaven-won rise.\r\n  Thus they write in love and pity,\r\n    Radiant with their heaven-dyes,\r\n  Lessons for the lost, the erring,\r\n    Hope for weary, dying eyes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  _RAIN CLOUDS._\r\n\r\n  High float the Cirri,\r\n    Passionless, pure;\r\n

first\r\nglimpse of the Catskills, and followed with delight their gradual\r\ndevelopment of peak and clove, until, near Hudson, they stood fully\r\nrevealed, flooded with sunshine, flecked with shadows, or crowned by\r\nstorm-laden clouds?\r\n\r\nThis region is noteworthy, not alone from its beauty and incalculable\r\nutility, but also from the associations clustering around it through the\r\npen of poets and writers of romance, the brush of the artist, and the\r\nmemories of thousands of tourists, who have found health and strength\r\nfor both body and mind upon its craggy heights or beside its numberless\r\nwild and beautiful mountain torrents. It comprises the whole of Greene\r\nCounty, a portion of Delaware, and the neighboring borders of Ulster,\r\nSchoharie, and Albany. It truly deserves the appellation of 'many\r\nfountained,' giving rise to great rivers, such as the Delaware, and one\r\nof the main branches of the Susquehanna, and to manifold smaller\r\nwatercourses, as the Schoharie, Catskill, and Esopus. Unlike the\r\nHighlands of Northern New Jersey and Southern New York, and the region\r\nof the Adirondacs, its lakes are few and very small. The best known are\r\nthe twin lakes near the Mountain House, and Shue's Lake, not far from\r\nthe summit of Overlook Mountain. These are all at a height,\r\napproximately, of two thousand feet above the river, and add greatly to\r\nthe variety and interest of the landscape in their vicinity.\r\n\r\nNames among these hills are a commodity so scarce that their paucity\r\npresents a serious obstacle to intelligible description. Round Tops and\r\nHigh Peaks are innumerable. We hope, when Professor Guyot completes his\r\ncursory survey of heights, made eighteen months ago, he will strive to\r\ndo as in North Carolina, and supply the deficiency. Nomenclature is a\r\ndifficult matter, and requires a poet, a poetic man of science, or the\r\nimaginative intuitions of a primitive people.\r\n\r\nThe main range of the Catskills finds its southerly corner in Overlook\r\nMountain, not far from Woodstock, and about seven miles (more or less)\r\nwest of the Hudson. One ridge extends northerly (a little east, parallel\r\nwith the river) from twelve to fourteen miles, and then, at the North\r\nMountain, making an obtuse angle, turns to the northwest, and passes\r\nthrough Windham into Schoharie County: the other ridge, starting from\r\nOverlook, runs in a westerly direction along the southern border of\r\nGreene County, and finally in Delaware sinks into broken hill ranges of\r\nless elevation. The space intermediate between these two main ridges is\r\nat first narrow, but gradually widens as they diverge from the starting\r\npoint; its interior (northwesterly) slope is drained by the Schoharie (a\r\nbranch of the Mohawk) and its tributaries, the East, the West, and\r\nBatavia Kills. Singular gaps or cloves intersect the range, affording\r\neasy communication with the lowlands bordering its base. Each clove has\r\nits own stream, and in the main ones on the river front are found the\r\ncountless and beautiful waterfalls which constitute the chief\r\ncharacteristic of Catskill scenery. The more primitive rocks of the\r\nHighlands, the Adirondacs, and the White Mountains do not offer such\r\nnumerous and picturesque sheets of falling water as the red sandstone of\r\nthe Catskills.\r\n\r\nStarting from Overlook Mountain, whence the view is said to be\r\nmagnificent, and proceeding northward, we first reach the Plattekill\r\nClove, up whose steep and wooded cleft winds a wild road, chiefly used\r\nfor quarrying purposes, and down whose abrupt declivity the Plattekill\r\nleaps from crag to crag in a series of fine falls and cascades. The\r\nquantity of water during the summer months, except after considerable\r\nrain, is small, but the rock formations are very interesting, reminding\r\nthe traveller of wild passes in the Tyrol. This is perhaps the grandest\r\nof all the Catskill clefts, but human ingenuity has here afforded no aid\r\nto the sightseer, and strong heads and agile limbs are needed for the\r\nenjoyment of its hidden beauties.\r\n\r\nThe mountain to the north of the Plattekill Clove has two crests, known\r\nas High Peak and Round Top. It was long thought to be the loftiest\r\nsummit of the Catskills, but must now yield to the Windham High Peak or\r\nBlack Head, 3,926 feet high, and perhaps to other elevations in the same\r\nrange. Professor Guyot gives its height at 3,684 feet, and that of the\r\nMountain House as 2,245 feet. This mountain has frequently been\r\nascended, although there is no regular path leading to the summit, but\r\nthe thick growth of wood on the top greatly hinders the satisfactoriness\r\nof the view. Between Round Top and the nearest mountain to the north\r\nlies the Kauterskill Clove, known preëminently as _The Clove_, the home\r\nof artists and the theme of poets. Its springs are drained by the\r\nKauterskill Creek, a branch of the Catskill, and it is one of the\r\nloveliest spots in America. The road through this clove is one of the\r\nmain arteries to the back mountain country, and, from the summit of the\r\nclove, near Haines's sawmill, winds for about three miles to the base,\r\nby the side of streams offering fifteen fine falls and cascades in a\r\ndistance of five miles, and between steep and wooded mountain slopes or\r\nrocky crags lifted high in air, now swelling out into the sunlight, and\r\nanon curving back into amphitheatres of shadow. The main Kauterskill\r\nflows from the twin lakes already mentioned, and just below the Laurel\r\nHouse falls over a precipice of 175 feet, which, with another dash of 80\r\nfeet, makes the entire depth of the stream's first grand plunge into the\r\nwild ravine 255 feet. A short distance below is the Bastion Fall, and,\r\nimmediately following, the Terrace Cascade, the united height of the two\r\nbeing certainly not less than 100 feet. These four fine falls are found\r\nin an easy walk of three quarters of a mile leading down the ravine from\r\nthe Laurel House to the Clove road.\r\n\r\nThe Little Kauterskill flows into the main stream at a short distance\r\nbelow the bridge where the Clove road first crosses that torrent. The\r\nravine through which it flows is incomparably beautiful, with the grand\r\nplunge (Haines's Fall or Fawn's Leap) at the head, and the seven\r\ngraceful cascades, all visible from one projecting table rock, soon\r\nafter following. Below the above-mentioned bridge are the Dog Fall, the\r\ncascade at Moore's Bridge, and the Dog Hole, with its steep cliffs and\r\nfoaming rapids. At the mouth of the Clove is Palensville, a little\r\nmanufacturing village, where town-wearied denizens find fresh air and\r\npleasant walks and drives during the summer months. To our taste,\r\nhowever, the summer climate at the various sojourning places, about two\r\nthousand feet above the sea level, is far preferable to that at the base\r\nof the mountain.\r\n\r\nRising to the north of the Clove is the South Mountain, from whose\r\nbeetling crags are obtained some of the finest views offered by the\r\nCatskills; then follows the Pine Orchard, where are the well-known\r\nMountain House, the twin lakes, and the Laurel House at the head of the\r\nKauterskill Falls; and finally, the North Mountain, which looks down\r\nupon a graceful spur to the east, Kiskatom Round Top, and then sweeps\r\naway to the northwest. Beyond the North Mountain is a considerable\r\ndepression, down which passes an execrable road, leading from East\r\nJewett, within the mountain range, to Cairo, at its foot. Finally, we\r\nreach Windham High Peak,[1] and the fine road crossing the mountains\r\nfrom Catskill to Delhi, and passing through Windham and Prattsville.\r\n\r\nOn the southern side of the range, west of Overlook, are two wild and\r\nbeautiful clefts, the one known as the Stony Clove, and the other as\r\nWest Kill or Bushnell Clove. The first begins as a narrow gorge with\r\nlofty hemlock and moss-clad mountain sides, and gradually opens out, at\r\nPhoenicia, upon the hills of Ulster and Esopus Creek. It is watered by\r\na trout stream, and its few but cosey farm cottages offer shelter\r\nsufficient for amateur fishermen and artists, bewitched by its fairy\r\nrecesses and fine forest growth. In the narrow portion of this clove are\r\nice caves, where ice may be found at all seasons of the year, and whence\r\nissue cooling winds appreciable in the warmest summer days.\r\n\r\nThe West Kill, or Bushnell Clove, is said to be still finer and more\r\nalpine than the Stony Clove. The last-mentioned gap and that of the\r\nPlattekill join the main or Kauterskill Clove between Tannersville and\r\nHunter, while the Bushnell Clove does not intersect the valley of the\r\nSchoharie until the West Kill flows into that stream near the charming\r\nvillage of Lexington, six miles south, a little west of Prattsville.\r\n\r\nThese geographical details may seem uninteresting, but if the writer had\r\npossessed them eight years ago, when first making the near acquaintance\r\nof the Catskills, many a mystification might have been avoided, and many\r\na pleasant excursion, now only known to the fancy, have been found\r\npracticable. One great attraction of the Catskills is, that the greater\r\nnumber of the spots chiefly interesting are within walking or driving\r\ndistance from the chief points of sojourn. Visitors in general confine\r\nthemselves to the Mountain House and its immediate vicinity, and hence\r\nsee but little of the beauties hidden among the cliffs and ravines of\r\nthe inner peaks. The view from the Mountain House plateau is extensive,\r\nbut tame and monotonous in character; the horizon is not interesting,\r\nand the cloud scenery is far more impressive than that of the land\r\nbeneath. The views from the very easily ascended North or South\r\nMountains, where, in addition to the river valley, the eye embraces the\r\nlakes, the opening of the Clove, and the distant mountains toward\r\nLexington, are far superior. Clum's Hill, a terraced eminence, visible\r\nfrom many points among the Catskills, and the Parker Mountain, east of\r\nTannersville, both offer peculiar and interesting prospects; but the\r\nking of views is that obtained from the cliffs of the South Mountain\r\noverhanging the Clove. This vista has furnished sketches for two\r\nremarkable pictures painted by that rare artist and genuine son of\r\nHelios, S. R. Gifford. Looking toward the west is the rolling plateau of\r\nthe Clove, with the far-away mountains beyond Hunter, the Parker and\r\nNorth Mountains, the openings to the Stony and Plattekill Cloves, Clum's\r\nHill, and the silver thread of Haines's Fall. At the foot of the cliffs,\r\nmore than a thousand feet below, lie Brockett's (classic ground for\r\nartists), the Clove road, Moore's Bridge, the Dog Fall, and the brawling\r\nKauterskill. Directly opposite stands the wooded crest of Round Top. The\r\nentire mountain side is visible, and the cleft is so narrow that the\r\ntrees can almost be counted as they rise one above another to a height\r\nof 2,500 feet above the roaring stream, which here receives two slender\r\ncascades that have threaded their way through the tangled forest. Toward\r\nthe east, the river is visible, and the sloping mountain declivities\r\nframe a lovely picture of lowland country and far-away Connecticut or\r\nMassachusetts hills. The effects of light and shadow are such as we have\r\nnever seen surpassed. This earth there seems made of gold or crimson\r\nlights, of gray seas of mist, or of every imaginable combination of\r\nbeautiful hues.\r\n\r\nThese cliffs are reached by a charming walk through a beech wood, and\r\nare distant about a mile from the Laurel House. A longer and still\r\nsomewhat rough path was opened thither last summer from the Mountain\r\nHouse. But we should never end were we to characterize all the beautiful\r\nspots, the entrancing walks and drives to be found amid these cool and\r\nhealthful slopes and plateaus. A difference of at least ten degrees is\r\nfelt between the mountain resorts and the villages on the river bank,\r\nand the air is inexpressibly fresh and invigorating.\r\n\r\nThese mountains have also a very interesting flora. The oak, beech,\r\nbirch, chestnut, hickory, maple, ash, hemlock--pines, black, white, and\r\nyellow--spruces, fir, and balsam, are among the most widely spread\r\ntrees; and of fruits, the blackberry, gooseberry, raspberry,\r\nwhortleberry or blueberry, and strawberry, grow in profusion and of fine\r\nflavor. Violets, anemones, liverworts, the fairy bells of the Linnea\r\nBorealis, the fragrant stars of the Mitchella or partridge berry, the\r\ntrailing arbutus, Houstonia, the laurel, honeysuckle, sarsaparilla,\r\nwintergreen, bottle gentian, white and blue, purple orchids, willow\r\nherb, golden rod, immortelles, asters in every variety, St. John's wort,\r\nwild turnip, Solomon's seals, wild lilies of the vale, fire lilies,\r\nIndian pipe, with other flowers, ground pines, and varieties of moss and\r\nferns innumerable, border the winding woodpaths and secluded roads.\r\nThere are many regions in America more grand than that of the Catskills,\r\nbut none, we think, more easily and gratefully compensatory to a careful\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Within Gethsemane's Garden kneeling,\r\n    Bends the Lord His sacred head,\r\n  His soul, each human sorrow feeling,\r\n    Quivers with keen shafts, sin-sped,\r\n      Every human misery knows,\r\n      Bears the burden of our woes.\r\n\r\n  Perchance not men alone His sinking,\r\n    Bleeding heart to weep is fain,\r\n  But poor dumb creatures sees He drinking\r\n    Deep the bitter cup of pain,\r\n      Hears the wailing, anguished cry,\r\n      Hears but curse and blow reply!\r\n\r\n                                   L. D. P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUES OF THE WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe life of the soldier is one of constant anxiety and suspense. He\r\nnever knows with any certainty to-day what he shall have to do\r\nto-morrow. Upon seemingly the greatest calm may suddenly burst the most\r\nterrific storm. There is little incentive to thought, except of that\r\npractical kind which directs the activities of the soldier's perilous\r\nlife. Here we are, thousands of us, an acting mass rather than an\r\nassemblage of thinking individuals. Indeed, it is not strictly military\r\nto think; implicit and unquestioning obedience is the law. When the\r\norder was finally given on Monday night (September 21st) for the whole\r\narmy to fell back on Chattanooga, the writer remarked:\r\n\r\n'Well, if we shall not have to go any farther--if we can hold\r\nChattanooga, we are not defeated;--it is even a victory, and we have won\r\nChattanooga at the battle of Chickamauga.'\r\n\r\n'We want none of your speculations,' retorted our Prussian commander;\r\n'it is a soldier's business to obey, and not to think.'\r\n\r\nBut, it is hardly natural for an American soldier to execute a movement\r\nwithout inquiring the wherefore. And if we are marched over mountains,\r\nand down the Lookout at Alpine Pass, within a few miles of Rome; and\r\nthen marched back again, up the perilous steep, and northward to\r\nStevens's Gap, and down again;--why, even common soldiers, without the\r\nevidence of brains which there is, or ought to be, in shoulder straps,\r\ninquire of each other for the strategic value there may be in all this\r\nmarching and countermarching, and find it hard to believe that it was\r\nall provided for in the original programme.\r\n\r\nBut in a still higher sense is the American soldier given to thinking.\r\nHe is quite likely to have an opinion as to the origin and cause of the\r\nwar--as to the issues involved therein, and the results which it is\r\nlikely to bring about. There is, moreover, a multiplicity of views, and\r\nnot the unanimity of dulness.\r\n\r\nThe causes, the issues, the results of the war--momentous themes! and\r\nlikely to be thoroughly canvassed by those whom they so vitally\r\nconcern--the American citizen and our citizen soldiery.\r\n\r\nThe causes, issues, and results of the war are so intimately related\r\nthat we can scarcely think of one without also thinking of the others.\r\nThe causes are more especially a thing of the past--they already belong\r\nto history: the results belong more particularly to the future; the\r\nissues pertain to the present. It is these with which we have more\r\nimmediately to do, and which it behooves us, as intelligent actors in\r\nthe great drama, to understand. We should not be indifferent to results,\r\nand we are not; but if there are real issues of right and wrong involved\r\nin the contest, and we are in the right, we may rest assured that the\r\nresults of a successful prosecution of the war will be worthy of all our\r\nsacrifices, and honorable to us as a people and nation.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a beleaguered camp, with no notes of former reading, or\r\nbooks of reference, it is a poor place for the elaboration of one's\r\nideas;--the writer, nevertheless, proposes to make a brief inquiry into\r\nthe issues involved in this terrible war.\r\n\r\nThe fact exists that there is a war between the North and South, brought\r\nabout, as we believe, by unwarranted and aggressive acts of the Slave\r\nPower. This slave oligarchy of the South either had, or affected to\r\nhave, a profound contempt for what they supposed was the want of spirit\r\nin the Northern people. It was a current swagger that we should barely\r\nfurnish them with an opportunity to show their superior military\r\nprowess. 'This war shall be waged on Northern soil,' they said. Events\r\nhave shown that they miscalculated; but the raids of Jackson, Lee,\r\nMorgan & Co. show how great their will has been to carry out their\r\nthreats of invasion. When the rebel guns opened upon Sumter, there was\r\nno alternative left us but fight now, or soon. Had we hesitated and\r\ncompromised then, the arrogant spirit of the insurgents would have been\r\nstill further flattered and puffed up, and their contempt for the\r\nsubmissive North made genuine, whatever it may have been before. A\r\ncompromise then would have made no lasting peace; the South would soon\r\nhave become tired of being merely 'let alone;' her exactions and\r\naggressions would have become more and more insolent and intolerable,\r\ntill warlike resistance or ignoble submission and slavery would have\r\nbeen our only alternative. This war is, therefore, on our part and in\r\none sense, a war in self-defence; and this may be regarded as one of its\r\nissues.\r\n\r\nEvery loyal soldier is fighting for the security of our Northern homes;\r\nand the issue resolves itself into this: The resistance of invasion; the\r\nvindication of our manliness as a people; the protection of our own\r\nfiresides--else be overrun, outraged, desolated, enslaved by the minions\r\nof a Southern oligarchy, which indulges the insane conceit that it is\r\nborn to rule.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for our country, it embraces two distinct forms of\r\nsociety, of dissimilar, if not of antagonistic character. It is a\r\nheritage from our ancestors; but none the less an evil for its prestige\r\nfrom the sanctities of time; and we are now reaping its bitter fruits in\r\nthe manifold and hideous forms of a great civil war. Taking human nature\r\nas it is, there appears to be no escape from this cruel ordeal. We of\r\nthe North claim that we have transcended that type of society whose\r\nvital and informing element is chattel slavery. There is natural and\r\nirrepressible antagonism between the two forms of society; they cannot\r\nsubsist in peace and good feeling by the side of each other, and still\r\nless under the same Government. Conflict was inevitable, and it came.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the war and of elucidation respecting its cause and\r\norigin, this may be only commonplace, yet necessary to fulness of\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\nSlavery felt the necessity of efforts to save herself from impending\r\nruin; she became taunting and aggressive in her manners and acts, and\r\nresorted at length to violence, reminding one of the oft-repeated\r\nproverb, 'Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.' History has\r\nno readings for the comfort of slavery. There is a progress in human\r\naffairs, and the tide of that progress is against her. Threatening\r\nattitudes and impetuous dashes do not appear to come with salvation; and\r\nthe promise--of glory for freedom, and doom for her--now is that, as a\r\nturbulent and rebellious power, she will be completely overthrown; a\r\nsudden and deserved judgment, the legitimate consequence of her own\r\nviolence and desperation.\r\n\r\nThis struggle between a progressive and triumphant civilization, on the\r\none hand, and a crude, unprogressive, and waning one on the other--if\r\ncivilization it can be called--is another of the issues of this war. It\r\nis but the ultimate, the closing catastrophe of the 'irrepressible\r\nconflict.'\r\n\r\nInvolved in this feature of the war, there is much beside the naked\r\nissue of freedom and slavery.\r\n\r\nSlavery has no respect for the affections, as is evinced by the\r\nmercilessness with which she sunders every family tie. The refining\r\nculture of growth in civilization demands respect for the domestic\r\nloves, even of an inferior race. Where chattel slavery exists, labor is\r\nnot held in honor, and just in proportion to the depth to which one\r\nclass sinks by industrial oppression, does the other sink through\r\nenervating indolence and exhausting indulgence. Where there is chattel\r\nslavery, there cannot be free speech: the utterance of truth may indeed\r\nbe incendiary, and the rickety, combustible institution standing out of\r\nits time, must needs protect itself. There must not be free education or\r\nfree inquiry. It would never do to teach the slaves; and it is likewise\r\nthe interest of this form of society to retain the lower strata of the\r\nnominally free population in ignorance equally dense and impenetrable. A\r\ncringing servility must be generated and maintained on the one side, and\r\na haughty and exacting superciliousness on the other.\r\n\r\nAll these may be regarded as constituting minor issues, which are\r\ndependent for their vitality on that which is greater; and when the fate\r\nof the issue between chattel slavery and its antagonist shall have been\r\ndetermined, there will be no further trouble with the collaterals. When\r\nthe main trunk is torn up by the root, the branches will all die.\r\n\r\nBut while the issue between slavery and freedom thus comprehends within\r\nitself a class of issues which are subordinate, may there not be a still\r\ngreater issue which dwarfs that of slavery and freedom into a secondary,\r\nand comprehends within itself this and other issues of equal magnitude\r\nand importance?\r\n\r\nOur Government has never given out that its object in the prosecution of\r\nthe war is the extinction of slavery. It claims to have adopted\r\nemancipation only as a war measure; the great purpose of the war being\r\navowedly the recovery of Governmental possessions and the restoration of\r\nthe Union. Many moralists, failing, as we believe, to see the real\r\nsignificance of the idea of political unity, have looked upon the\r\nproposed object of the Government as a low and unworthy one; but have,\r\nnevertheless, rejoiced that the hand of Providence is in the work, and\r\noverruling it to bring out of these meaner aims a great and noble\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to recollect in this connection that it is not always\r\nwhen great moral ends are the real aim and purpose of a movement that\r\nthe greatest good has been accomplished. The greatest moral results have\r\noften followed when the movement proposed no moral end whatever; while\r\nefforts having a direct moral aim have resulted in signal failure, and\r\nsometimes in disaster even to the very end proposed. Well-meant efforts\r\nto save the heathen in a spiritual way have sometimes resulted in their\r\nphysical destruction, through the stealthy obtrusion of the pests of\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means as yet a settled question that emancipation will\r\nenhance the happiness of our negro population, or that it may not be the\r\nbeginning of a series of disasters to the race which will eventuate in\r\nits extinction on this continent. The settlement of the slave question\r\nmay be the beginning of the negro question; and the end of one\r\ndifficulty the beginning of another.\r\n\r\nIt may be that sympathy for the negro is seeking to put in train a\r\nseries of changes which would terribly revulse those same sympathies, if\r\nthe end could be seen from the beginning. Yet these sympathies, even if\r\nmistaken in their direct object, may be working to a great and desirable\r\nend, which they do not as yet recognize. The Crusaders aimed at what\r\nthey considered a good, but, failing in that, accomplished a real good\r\nof which they had no conception. They did not make themselves permanent\r\nmasters of the Holy Land, but through their intercourse with each other\r\nand with the more cultivated people of the East, they nourished the\r\ngerms of a forthcoming civilization in the West.\r\n\r\nIn the natural history of the world we discover that certain tribes of\r\nsentient beings prey upon certain other tribes; and this seems, on a\r\ncursory view, to be very shocking to the finer sensibilities of our\r\nnature; yet it is an arrangement which results in a larger amount of\r\nsentient enjoyment than could otherwise obtain among these lower\r\ndenizens of our inexplicable world. The most vigorous--that which\r\nembodies within itself the greatest and the most various elements of\r\nvitality and power--the most vigorous, I say, prevails; and if the negro\r\nrace of our continent should begin to wane and finally go as the 'poor\r\nIndian' has done--a fate which I do not here predict for him--the field\r\nthus vacated will not be lost, but occupied at once, and in time to its\r\nfullest extent, by a race of greater capabilities for culture, progress,\r\nand enjoyment. The physical world has attained to its present advanced\r\ngeological condition through much of violence and pain; the same is true\r\nin a moral sense of mankind at large; and there may be still quite a\r\ngreat deal of this same career to run.\r\n\r\nSympathy of itself is blind, and may 'kill with kindness.' It has often\r\ndone so. But it is a noble emotion: let it play its role, since, in the\r\nworking out of destiny, 'the will may be taken for the deed,' and a good\r\naccomplished which was not intended or foreseen.\r\n\r\nGovernments may not be greatly at fault for not proposing 'high moral\r\naims.' We need only recall the names of Watt, Fulton, Stevenson, Morse,\r\nand others of that class, to perceive that great moral changes are\r\nbrought about when no moral purpose is intended. It is not affirmed that\r\nthese benefactors of mankind never thought of the moral consequences\r\nwhich their purely physical labors would produce, but only that the\r\nmoral consequences were not the incentive to the mechanical achievement.\r\nThe genius of invention had to work out its legitimate results through\r\nthe innate force of its own peculiar constitution. The impetus was that\r\nof essential genius, not of moral calculation.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true of the cultivation of science for its own sake.\r\nThe stargazer with his telescope, the chemist with crucible and retort,\r\nthe physiologist with his chemical and optical aids, the purely\r\nscientific thinker--all who prosecute science for the love of it--have\r\nwrought out results which are breaking as light of the clear morning sun\r\nupon the history of nations, thus enabling us to avail ourselves of the\r\npast in order to comprehend the status of the present and the\r\npossibilities of the future.\r\n\r\nGreat social and political results have thus been attained without\r\nconsciously intending them, or seeing how they were to be brought about.\r\nOur Government, without professing great moral purposes, may yet\r\naccomplish more in that direction, and this, too, by the relentless and\r\nbloody hand of war, than has ever been the result of purely moral design\r\nby the most approved moral means, on the part of any combination of\r\nmankind. It may be a crisis in history, and the ushering in of a new\r\nera.\r\n\r\nOur Government proposes to recover lost possessions, and restore the\r\nintegrity of the Union. Wherefore? Ours is the most beneficent\r\nGovernment upon the earth, blessing the most human beings, and it should\r\nbe sustained. The whole nation has contributed to the acquisition of\r\nSouthern territory, and it is not meet that the Northern people should\r\nsurrender their interest in the same. The Mississippi River belongs as\r\nnaturally to the great West as to the South, and it should be under the\r\ncontrol of the same sovereign power, to be used for the good of one\r\ngreat people. There is no natural division line between the North and\r\nSouth, and it would be fatal to the future peace and prosperity of this\r\ncontinent to attempt to make one.\r\n\r\nThese are some of the reasons ordinarily given for the prosecution of\r\nthis war--for our great effort to reëstablish the Union. They are\r\npractical, readily comprehended, and to urge them is well--enough,\r\nreally, for present practical purposes; but may there not be in the idea\r\nof political unity a meaning--a philosophical significance, if you\r\nplease, which these practical and obvious considerations do not reveal?\r\n\r\nIt is the confirmed conviction of the Northern people, with certain\r\nunnatural exceptions, that it is our true policy to maintain the\r\nintegrity of the Union at any cost, however great; the people of the\r\nSouth evidently take a different view of it; the political thinkers of\r\nEurope appear to be divided in their sympathies between the North and\r\nSouth.\r\n\r\nAn article appears in a British quarterly to prove that it is the fate\r\nof great empires to fall to pieces; and that China, Turkey, Russia, and\r\nthe United States show signs of approaching dissolution. It is observed\r\nthat French writers of authority in the Government have issued pamphlets\r\nto prove that the peace and stability of nations require the\r\ndismemberment of the United States. The 'fire eaters' of the South are\r\nnot the only people who would like to see the United States in\r\nfragments. We have such even in the North; and in Europe, especially\r\nnear the thrones, 'their name is legion.'\r\n\r\nThe thinking world has not yet settled into the conviction that a great\r\ncontinental policy, preserving internal peace, and enduring for an\r\nindefinite period into the far-off future, is a possible thing. The fate\r\nof nations and empires, as revealed in history, is apparently against\r\nsuch an idea. Many empires have already appeared, risen to power, fallen\r\ninto decay, and become dismembered, having run their course and\r\ndisappeared. May it not be so with our own great confederacy of States?\r\nThe authority against a great, practical, enduring political unity is\r\nrespectable. May we not be fighting for an illusion? What guarantee have\r\nwe in history, science, and common sense, that our Federal Union will\r\nnot crumble as the empires of the past have done, and as the political\r\nprophets of Europe, casting the horoscope of nations in the shadows of\r\ntheir own political fragmentarism, have predicted for us? Even should\r\nthe rebels South be chastised, and the Union restored for the present,\r\nhave we solid reasons for believing in the permanency of our\r\ninstitutions? What is the warrant for our faith that American destiny\r\ncomprehends the principle of American unity?\r\n\r\nPeople contract habits of thought in a great measure from the nature of\r\nthe institutions which surround them. Europe could think nothing but\r\nfeudalism at one time; she had no conception of religion outside the\r\nChurch of Rome. The Turk thinks by the standard of political absolutism\r\nand the Moslem faith. The reflections of every people are cast in the\r\nnational mould; it is so the world over, and has been so in all times.\r\nEurope, or at least a very influential portion thereof, thinks that the\r\n'balance of power' system will yet be inaugurated among the family of\r\nnations yet to spring up on this continent. Her people think balance of\r\npower, and the London _Times_ and like organs of the existing polity\r\nwrite balance of power for our edification, and for the future of\r\nAmerica. They cannot conceive that there is any other way to get along\r\nfor any considerable length of time. In like manner is it\r\nconcluded--keeping up the old trains of thought--that if nations once\r\nfell into fragments when shaken, they will do just so again.\r\n\r\nNow, perhaps we have contracted habits of thought from the character of\r\nour country and her institutions, and are deceiving ourselves with hopes\r\nwhich have no real foundation. These, we believe, are considerations\r\nwhich have engaged the attention of every reflecting man; and it\r\nbehooves us, as intelligent Americans and members of a young nation of\r\nhitherto unexampled prosperity and promise, to be able to give a reason\r\nfor the faith that is in us.\r\n\r\nThere are changes and crises in the course and destiny of political\r\nsystems. The conditions of one period of time are different from the\r\nconditions of another period. Different conditions necessitate different\r\npolitical systems. Feudalism did not last always; European diplomacy is\r\nonly three hundred years old. If Europe, out of her peculiar situation,\r\noriginated the doctrine of balance of power, thus innovating upon the\r\npast, may not we, owing to the novelty of our situation, originate a\r\ncontinental system which will endure to the remotest periods of time, or\r\nso long as political systems shall have place on the earth?\r\n\r\nOne empire may fall into fragments to-day; while another may not only\r\nnot suffer dissolution, but really grow stronger, and appropriate, in a\r\nmost legitimate manner, parts of the dismembered empire.\r\n\r\nWe must allow, not only for the difference of conditions with reference\r\nto time, but, also, for the different situations at the same time of\r\ndifferent political structures. To assume, because nations have been\r\nground to atoms, or have fallen to pieces of their own weight, that\r\ntherefore Russia and the United States are about to go in the same way,\r\nis a species of reasoning which is hardly warranted by scientific\r\nmethods. It may be that the empire of Great Britain is itself doomed to\r\ndissolution at no very distant day; but it does not follow that the\r\nUnited States are, therefore, liable to the same fate, now or ever. So\r\nfar from this, it is possible, if not highly probable, that as the\r\nremote provinces of the British empire shall fall away, the central\r\npolitical system of this continent may very naturally absorb at least\r\none of the fragments, and thereby become stronger as a Government, and\r\nmore potent for good to the people of an entire world.\r\n\r\nThere are laws of dissolution, and laws of segregation and combination\r\nin the political as in the natural world. Great Britain may fall into\r\nfragments because her geographical and political conditions render her\r\namenable to the laws of dissolution; while the United States may go on\r\nenlarging their boundaries and becoming more stable and powerful from\r\nthe fact that their political status and local surroundings render them\r\nthe legitimate subject of the laws of political growth and geographical\r\nenlargement. The British possessions are geographically too remote; they\r\nmay not be united together by the necessary bonds of political union.\r\nThe weakness of Great Britain may now be what the weakness of the\r\nSpanish empire once was. Her geography is against her. The day is\r\ngradually passing away when arbitrary power may hold distant regions in\r\nsubjection to a central despotism; the day is at hand which demands that\r\nthe bonds of union shall be natural and just, not arbitrary--bonds which\r\nforever assert their own inherent power to unite and grow stronger, not\r\nweaker, with the inevitable changes constantly being wrought out by the\r\nbusy hand of time.\r\n\r\nMan's social and political life depends much on the physical conditions\r\nby which he is surrounded. We have only to instance a mountain and\r\nvalley population. The former is isolated and out of the way, and the\r\npeople simple, uncouth, and uncultivated--contented, it is true, but,\r\nnevertheless, enjoying but little of the abundance and variety in which\r\npeople of culture luxuriate. The valley population have a city,\r\nvillages, rich lands, trade, and commerce; they are wealthy, cultivated,\r\nand realize far more the legitimate fruition of our entire nature.\r\n\r\nEven missionaries, whose prejudices may be presumed to have been in\r\nfavor of purely moral means, tell us that that heathen can only be\r\npermanently Christianized through changes in their physical conditions\r\nwhich commerce alone can bring about.\r\n\r\nPhysical conditions affect the destiny of nations, and go far to\r\ndetermine the extent and character of political organizations. It makes\r\na great difference whether a country has or has not the means of ready\r\ncommunication and transportation from one section to another. While the\r\ngreat body of Europe was comparatively uncultivated, with only the\r\nnatural channels of commerce, and these unimproved, there could be\r\nlittle communication between the different sections of country; and\r\nEurope had no political or social unity. The people of the entire\r\ncontinent were in a fragmentary and disorganized mass, comparatively\r\nisolated, and independent of each other. The jurisdictions of the great\r\nbarons and of the cities became at length united into kingdoms. The\r\nincrease of commerce brought these kingdoms into relations with each\r\nother, and diplomacy grew out of national necessities. As the countries\r\nimproved and the facilities and occasions for intercommunication and\r\ncommerce increased, the principle of political unity must needs\r\ncomprehend a wider range. At first, it took in only the component parts\r\nof kingdoms, and then the kingdoms in the form of great national leagues\r\nof more or less permanence. This form of political unity may be very\r\nimperfect, but it is nevertheless unity consummated in the best possible\r\nmanner which the system of separate thrones would permit. Changes in the\r\nconditions and relations of peoples render changes in their political\r\nforms an absolute necessity. The facilities for education,\r\nintercommunication, travel, and commerce, are the great unitizers of\r\npeoples and nations.\r\n\r\nA great, overgrown empire, which has been built up by arbitrary power,\r\nmay fall to pieces, because it is not bound together by the ligaments\r\nwhich an ubiquitous commerce affords. Another, because thus interlaced\r\nand woven together, cannot be sundered. The dependence of part on part\r\nand the facilities of transportation from one section to another, render\r\nsuch an empire a really vital organism, which cannot be divided without\r\ndestroying the whole; but since nations, as individuals, are tenacious\r\nof life, the whole cannot be destroyed, and the empire cannot be\r\ndivided. There is no place for division, and none can be made. This\r\nprinciple, we believe, applies to our own country.\r\n\r\nLines for the transmission of intelligence, the highways of travel, the\r\nchannels of intercommunication and commerce--these connect remote\r\nsections with each other, and, in connection with the specialization of\r\nindustry, cause them to become mutually dependent, and thus form a web\r\nof unity knitting the many into one. The Mississippi River has been\r\ncharacterized by some one as a great original Unionist. It is so.\r\n\r\nThe channels and highways of commerce are of two kinds: natural and\r\nartificial. The natural are the seas, lakes, rivers; and these only\r\nbecome the means of political union according to the extent of the use\r\nwhich is made of them. The improvement of harbors and of rivers, and the\r\nmodern revolutions in the art of navigation, have greatly increased\r\ntheir power to make one section necessary to another, and bind people to\r\npeople. Were not steam applied to locomotion, the great rivers of North\r\nAmerica would afford far less of promise for American unity than they\r\nnow do.\r\n\r\nSince whatever facilitates communication and transportation makes one\r\nclass of people dependent on another, through the mutual exchange of\r\nsocial opportunity and of industrial productions, and binds them more\r\nfirmly together; hence, also, the political and social values of the\r\nartificial channels of commercial intercourse. Wagon roads, canals,\r\nrailroads, telegraphs, are all so many political unitizers; but the\r\nrailroad, with its accompaniment, the telegraph, may be regarded as the\r\nchief of all.\r\n\r\nLet us notice for a moment the political value of our rivers, with the\r\nimproved navigation of the same, and of our railroads, in the\r\nsuppression of the existing rebellion.\r\n\r\nHad there been no navigable rivers and no railroads uniting the North\r\nand South, the chances for the local division of our country would be\r\nfar greater than they are under existing circumstances. The South would\r\nhave been comparatively isolated from the North, and our armies could\r\nnot have reached her territory with the facility they now do. Prolonged\r\nfor years, as the war must have been under such circumstances, the North\r\nwould have grown weary of prosecuting it; the chances for intervention\r\nwould have been greater, and the establishment of a Southern nation by\r\nno means an impossible thing.\r\n\r\nWith facilities for penetrating the country, it may be easier to reduce\r\na dozen rebel States than one quarter of the territory if held by\r\nuncivilized Indians. We were longer subjugating the Seminole Indians\r\nthan we are likely to be in putting down the rebellion. The facilities\r\nof transportation in the one case, and their absence in the other, make\r\npart of the difference. Besides, these same facilities and their\r\naccompaniments render Southern society a really vital and sensitive\r\nthing, so that a wound in some vital part, as Vicksburg or Chattanooga,\r\nis felt to the remotest ends of Secessia. It will not require\r\nextermination of all the members; a few mere such wounds, and the\r\nrebellious creature will have to yield.\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee River enabled us to drive the enemy out of Western\r\nTennessee and Northern Mississippi and Alabama. By means of the\r\nMississippi River we have cut away a considerable limb of the\r\n'confederacy,' and we believe it can never be restored. Nashville has\r\nbecome a depot of supplies for the army of the Cumberland, because of\r\nthe Cumberland River and the railroad to the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nWhen we advanced from Murfreesboro', on the 24th of June last, the rains\r\nfell almost incessantly, and the roads became at length really\r\nimpassable. We were at Tullahoma and beyond it, on short rations. Had\r\nthere been no means of transportation other than the army wagon and the\r\ncommon road, it is doubtful whether, under the circumstances, General\r\nRosecrans could have held his advanced position so easily won. When some\r\nof the teams could not draw empty wagons back to Murfreesboro', it is\r\nnot likely that such means of transportation would have been sufficient\r\nfor the subsistence of our army in and around Tullahoma. But in less\r\nthan ten days the joyful whistle of the locomotive was heard, and the\r\narmy was soon abundantly supplied.\r\n\r\nTake our present situation. Had there been no railroad from Nashville to\r\nthe Tennessee River, the campaign of last fall could not have been\r\nundertaken with any prospect of success. But allow that it had been\r\nundertaken, and the result of the battle of Chickamauga what it was:\r\ncould our army have terminated its retreat at Chattanooga, and held this\r\nimportant military position? By no means: it would have recrossed the\r\nmountains, a broken, discouraged, and almost demoralized host. The\r\ntrains have run almost constantly from Nashville to Stevenson and\r\nBridgeport, and the army has been on half rations for nearly two months.\r\nIf wagons could not bring supplies fifty miles, much less one hundred\r\nand fifty. And now (November 15th) that the distance for teams has, for\r\nsome days, been reduced to six or seven miles, we are still very short\r\nof supplies.\r\n\r\nLet the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad receive due credit for the\r\npart it has played in promoting the success of the campaign and 'saving\r\nthe Army of the Cumberland.' Railroads and all other channels of\r\ncommerce contribute most efficiently to the success of the great effort\r\nof our Government to restore the integrity of the Union: let them\r\nreceive due credit, and be rightly remembered when the great conflict\r\nis ended.\r\n\r\nThese facts may serve to suggest the value of the various commercial\r\nfacilities as means of political unitization. A country without the\r\nmeans of travel and transportation may readily separate into independent\r\nfragments whenever any arbitrary institution, as that of slavery,\r\ndevelops antagonism between different geographical sections; and in that\r\ncase the arbitrary institution would triumph, and civilization would be\r\nthrown backward. But in a country which speaks the same language, and is\r\ncheckered all over by the pathways of commercial and social\r\nintercourse--since there is no place for division except by the rupture\r\nof innumerable ligaments--the integrity of its oneness will maintain\r\nitself; and if necessary to this end, the arbitrary institution, or\r\ncause of attempted rupture, whatever It may be, will be swept out of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe vindication of national unity is the great issue; the abasement of\r\nslavery a subordinate one.\r\n\r\nHere, then, may we perceive some reasons why our labor and sacrifice for\r\nthe restoration of the Union are not given in vain; that we are not\r\nstruggling to sustain a structure which will be liable at any time to\r\npass into the history of the 'fall of empires.' We have the\r\nencouragement of new conditions--of conditions which give a warrant,\r\nwherever they obtain, for the permanence of political unity. Subdue the\r\npresent rebellion, reinstate the Union, multiply the facilities for\r\nsocial intercourse and the mutual exchange of products, especially\r\nrailroads, wherever there is sufficient promise of a need; and our\r\ncountry, thus knit together and united, has nothing to fear from the\r\nmadness of local factions. Permeate the body politic in all its members\r\nby the nerves, veins, and arteries of a vital circulation, and it\r\nbecomes an organized unity which is not susceptible of division into\r\nupper or lower, right or left, except by the destruction of the entire\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nBut admitting that continental unity is to obtain some day, still the\r\nquestion as to whether now is or is not the time for it to assume a more\r\ndistinct form, brings us by a rational necessity to a brief notice of\r\nthe influence of European diplomacy and the contingency of foreign\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nIt is very clear that the 'balance of power' system of Europe, and the\r\ncontinental system which this war is waged on our part to sustain, are\r\nvery unlike, if not antagonistic systems. The tone, all through the war,\r\nof a large portion of the British daily press, and of much of her\r\nweightier literature; the intrigues of Napoleon and the outspeaking of\r\nhis minions, together with the measures which have been clandestinely\r\ntaken by persons of power and influence to advance the interests of\r\nsecession, show that there are influential classes in Western Europe,\r\nallied by interest to her fragmentary political organizations, who would\r\ngladly see the United States broken to pieces under the shock of\r\nrebellion. Their sympathies have been with the rebellion all through the\r\nwar; and that they have not interfered more actively than they have, is\r\nnot to be attributed to their sincere love for justice and neutrality,\r\nbut to their own weakness--to the complicated nature of their own\r\ndiplomacy, and its critical status just now, when there is danger of\r\nbursting volcanoes in their own midst.\r\n\r\nIt is a law of history that any political system of some degree of\r\nprevalence seeks to extend itself; indeed, this is a law of all\r\nmovement, whether physical, chemical, social, or political. There is a\r\npolitical leaven which permeates the whole mass, and brings it into the\r\nsame condition. It resulted once in the general prevalence of feudalism;\r\nit afterward touched the cities of civilizing Europe, and they became\r\nindependent, and leagued together for a common purpose. It operated\r\nagain, and governments of organized and more orderly character came\r\ninto existence all over what was once feudal Europe. The prevailing\r\nsystem, or that which is animated by the strongest and most active\r\nprinciple, necessitates whatever is unlike it to become of the same\r\ncharacter with itself, even though it might seem like the surrender of\r\nthe better for the worse. This is very aptly shown by the fact that\r\nunder feudalism allodial titles were voluntarily surrendered for feudal\r\nones. This system subordinated even the church.\r\n\r\nThe question is legitimate: Have we nothing to fear from the leaven of\r\npolitical fragmentarism in Europe? Is there not vitality enough in the\r\nlittle-monarchy and balance-of-power system of Middle and Western Europe\r\nto extend its influence into this country, contributing effectually to\r\nthe overthrow of American unity; and, by the operation of this political\r\n'induction,' making the political system of America like the political\r\nsystem of Europe? Or, has the time come for the more permanent\r\ninauguration of the policy of continental unity--a system of very\r\ndifferent genius from that which prevails in the former centres of\r\ncivilization? We believe that there are the most rational grounds for\r\nencouragement.\r\n\r\nPolitical fragmentarism is comparatively a primitive condition. Europe\r\nhas bean growing out of it for hundreds of years. The grasp of political\r\nunity has gradually taken hold of the nations, and brought them\r\norganization and order out of isolation and anarchy. Even European\r\ndiplomacy is an expression of the unitizing tendency, since it seeks to\r\nbind the nations together in leagues, making them as completely a unit\r\nas may be consistent with the pride and interests of separate and\r\ndistinct sovereignties. Unitization is therefore in the line of\r\npolitical development; it has gained strength with the march of\r\ncivilization and the growth of intelligence and freedom among the\r\npeople. Our struggle, therefore, would seem to be a spontaneous uprising\r\nof the people for the security of a cardinal principle--a great torrent\r\nof human movement, surging forward with the stream of political\r\ndevelopment. History is, in its deepest heart, upon the side of unity,\r\nand ours is a sure faith that victory will crown our efforts.\r\n\r\nWe are led further to hope that the time has come for unity, by the fact\r\nthat the European system has not as yet felt itself strong enough to\r\nmeddle in any direct manner in our affairs to the detriment of our\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the political system of Europe is at present so completely\r\nbusied with its own complications, together with the fact that our own\r\ncountry is so intersected by the natural and artificial channels of\r\ncommerce and general intercourse, and by the interrelation and\r\noverlapping of interests, that there is no definite line for a fracture\r\nto be found, while, at the same time, our armies can readily penetrate\r\ninto the enemy's country, and advance their base of supplies by means of\r\nthe great thoroughfares of trade; these are sources of encouragement,\r\nand give us good reason to believe that the time has indeed come for the\r\nushering in of a new political era by the successful vindication of\r\nAmerican unity.\r\n\r\nWe repeat, this is the great issue of the war. Slavery has only sprung\r\nupon us; and if slavery stands in the way of national unity and\r\npolitical harmony, unity and harmony can only be secured by\r\nsubordinating the power of slavery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs to the importance and full significance of the principle of political\r\nunity, it is not proposed to enter into a detailed discussion here; the\r\ntheme is too vast. A few suggestions must suffice in this connection.\r\n\r\nOne of the consequences of the want of political unity is national\r\ndissensions and frequent wars, by which the resources of nations are\r\ndrained, property destroyed, countries devastated, the arm of industry\r\nweakened, commerce crippled, and progress in the means of civilization\r\ngenerally retarded. Political unity would do away with national\r\nquarrels, so disastrous to human well-being; while the emulation of\r\nstates and sections will furnish all the incentive that is necessary to\r\nurge a people on to honorable achievements.\r\n\r\nIt does not promise well for the pacific character of unity, that we\r\nhave a great civil war; but wherefore? An antiquated and misplaced\r\ninstitution--a relic of a more primitive and barbarous form of\r\nsociety--has led to the development of antagonism between two local\r\ndivisions of our country. The war grew out of this antagonism: destroy\r\nthe cause of sectional misunderstanding, and this cause of war will\r\nnever more give us trouble.\r\n\r\nBut a difficulty is suggested: Our people will never become alike, never\r\na homogeneous people; the differences of country and climate will\r\nforever prevent this. Very good; we don't want sameness throughout the\r\nsociety of a great empire. This is a distinctly marked feature of\r\nprimitive society. The more unlike as to industrial pursuits, the more\r\nvariety in the tastes and wants of the people of different sections, the\r\nmore dependent may these different sections become upon each other; and\r\nwith facilities for intercourse, the more intimately do they become\r\nrelated. Unity develops itself through the specialization of parts and\r\nfunctions. This specializing process, as in the gradual formation of the\r\nvital organs in fetal development, is the very creation of unlikeness;\r\nand unity is the mutual dependence and necessary coöperation of these\r\ndissimilar organs. The more diversity the more complete the unity. It is\r\nantagonism--a very different thing--that does the mischief. It is not\r\ndesirable that a people should be homogeneous; that would be a falling\r\nback into barbarous conditions. Unity demands that the people shall be\r\nheterogeneous and diversified, with heterogeneous and diversified\r\noccupations, tastes, and habits; and then, with proper facilities for\r\nmental intercommunication, travel, and transportation, they become a\r\ncoöperative and coalescent people. It is coalescence we want, and not\r\nhomogeneity.\r\n\r\nIf such be the conditions of unity, then surely it is not to be feared,\r\nbecause New England manufactures, the Middle States mine, the Western\r\nStates farm, and the Southern States plant, that, therefore, they must\r\nneeds be under separate and distinct governments. This very\r\ndissimilarity of soil, climate, occupation, and production enables the\r\nsections to contribute to each other's welfare, and is a condition of\r\ntheir unity. The heart, liver, lungs, stomach, brain, and nerves cannot\r\ndispense with each other in the vital economy; it is the very dependence\r\nof one special part upon another through the channels of circulation,\r\nthat renders the superior animal organism so completely a unit. It\r\ncannot be repeated too often that it is not sameness of function, but\r\nheterogeneity of function, that unity requires. Hence, through the\r\nspecialization of industries--one kind of manufactures here, and another\r\nthere; mining in one locality, and farming in another; the growing of a\r\ncertain product in one section, and the growing of a different product\r\nin a different section--all these, together with, the increasing\r\nfacilities for correspondence and transportation, are preparing society\r\nfor larger, more complete, and inevitable unity.\r\n\r\nThere need be no fear of confirmed hostility of feeling between the\r\nNorth and South when the war is over, should it end in the\r\nreëstablishment of the Union. Southern journalists say:\r\n\r\n     'If the North is successful in its mad scheme of conquest, we shall\r\n     look upon ourselves as a subjugated people, and there never can be\r\n     cordial union between the people of the two sections.'\r\n\r\nNonsense. With the coming of peace, there will also come a very\r\ndifferent spirit over the dream of the entire South. The great mass of\r\nher people have been cruelly duped, and not less cruelly coerced; and\r\nonce the war is over, these people will become undeceived, and at once\r\nrelieved from the gyves of a remorseless conscription. There will be a\r\nviolent reaction in Southern sentiment, and a storm of indignation will\r\nbe hurled against the instigators of rebellion for all the torture and\r\nagony and ruin they have brought to the millions of a once happy nation.\r\nThe war for the Union will yet find an altar in every Southern home; it\r\nwill become as truly appreciated there as here; the Southern people will\r\none day glory as greatly in its magnificent results. There will be no\r\nlonger a few thousand aristocrats, calling themselves 'the South,' and\r\nteaching hatred to freedom and progress. This class will be shorn of\r\npower and influence, as one of the consequences of the war; and being no\r\nlonger competent for good or mischief, they may, indeed, nurse their\r\ngloom, and torture their lives to the bitter end with the wail, 'We are\r\na subjugated people.' But it will be the wail of selfishness for the\r\nsceptre which has departed forever from their hands. There is nothing to\r\nfear from these. Very soon after the Government shall have vindicated\r\nits competence and extended its jurisdiction over the rebel States, will\r\nthe most influential and active of their people range themselves on the\r\nside of the 'powers that be'--such is the charm of power, the magic of\r\ninterest, the welcome of peace. All the antagonism generated and\r\ncherished by slavery will have totally disappeared; and the South will\r\nsoon be on the side of all freedom. There will be cordial coöperation\r\nunder free labor and free trade, between her people and our people; and\r\nthough diversified as to occupations, habits, and tastes, they will\r\nconstitute essentially one great political brotherhood.\r\n\r\nWhen slavery, the cause of the present unhappy strife, is extinguished,\r\nour country has little to fear, except, perhaps, from the Rocky\r\nMountains, which interpose so formidable a barrier between the Atlantic\r\nand Pacific States of our great Federal Union. This mountain barrier and\r\nthe great distance by water may one day afford an occasion for the\r\nencouragement of ambitious men to repeat the experiment of secession.\r\nThe antidote to this possible evil is the reduction of the most\r\nformidable features of the barrier, and the shortening of the forbidding\r\ninterval. Span the mountains and intervening valleys with railroads and\r\nlines of telegraph, and every wire and rail assumes the dignity of a\r\nsocial and political power in the bonds of an indissoluble unity.\r\n\r\nIf there be so little to create apprehension for the future, may we not\r\nrationally hope that the diminution of war, if not its ultimate\r\nextinction, is one of the promises of political unity?\r\n\r\nGreat, strong, noble men--those who are great and noble in all the\r\nelements of their nature--such are never pugilists, and never fight: it\r\nis those of distorted and defective development--those who have not\r\ncompleteness and integrality within themselves, that are turbulent and\r\nbreak the peace.\r\n\r\nAnother value of comprehensive unity is that only in great coöperative\r\ncombinations of mankind can the _individual man_ find the fullest\r\nexpression for all the faculties of his nature. There is no unity\r\nproper--no organization--in savage society; and life there is very\r\nsimple, with little variety of expression and little enjoyment. As man\r\nbecomes cultivated his wants increase, and he becomes a more social\r\nbeing. His happiness becomes more and more dependent on others; hence\r\narise societies and organizations of various kinds. The more cultivated\r\nany people and the more diversified their wants, the more various do\r\ntheir relations become, and the more extensive their combinations. This\r\nis given merely as a fact of history. The truly philosophic eye, we\r\nbelieve, cannot be long in discerning that these larger combinations\r\nand more comprehensive unities are only a necessary outgrowth of an\r\nimproving civilization, and indispensable to the fullest measure of\r\nhappiness; since in them only can the life of a cultured people find the\r\nmeans of its best expression. The growth of unity, as revealed in\r\nhistory, is not an arbitrary thing incident to a chance concurrence of\r\ncauses, but naturally growing out of the needs of a steady progress in\r\nthe education and freedom of the people.\r\n\r\nTo say that it is through great social and political institutions that\r\nthe individual finds the most ample means for the culture and\r\nsatisfaction of the faculties and wants of his nature, is but another\r\nway of saying that it is through such institutions that he finds the\r\nwidest range for individual liberty. A very little observation of\r\nhistory will show that as political unity has enlarged and political\r\norganization become more distinctly marked, the radii of individual\r\nfreedom have at the same time swept a wider field.\r\n\r\nDespotism curtails enterprise, and prevents the specialization of parts\r\nand functions as the genuine condition of unity. The free play of\r\nintelligence and interest is necessary to develop the diversity upon\r\nwhich unity depends. Let the bare statement suffice. It must come to\r\nevery careful observer and clear thinker with the authority of a\r\nself-evident proposition. Unity and individual freedom are necessary to\r\neach other; they act and react, and one implies the other. They go hand\r\nin hand; and national unity cannot be violated and broken, without, at\r\nthe same time, necessitating despotism, and curtailing the individual in\r\nthe exercise of his legitimate rights. Unity and liberty are mutually\r\ndependent and forever inseparable. Hence the inestimable value of unity,\r\nthe leading issue of the war.\r\n\r\nThe issues of the war might be symbolized by the picture of a great\r\nriver; the smaller branches forming still larger ones, and these putting\r\ninto the main stream--unity--itself, as it descends, widening into the\r\ngreat ocean of the future.\r\n\r\nThese issues might, also, be exhibited in a kind of formula. The\r\nfollowing is no doubt very imperfect, but it may be somewhat suggestive.\r\nThe first includes the second, the second the third:\r\n\r\n    I.   Political unity _vs._ secession:\r\n\r\n       { A progressive civilization _vs._ a stagnant one;\r\n       { A republican form of government _vs._ an aristocratic one;\r\n   II. { Personal freedom _vs._ chattel slavery;\r\n       { General peace _vs._ diplomatic intrigue and war;\r\n       { An enlarged individual freedom _vs._ espionage, censure,\r\n       {  and restriction:\r\n\r\n       { Common schools and general intelligence _vs._ partial\r\n       {  culture and general ignorance;\r\n       { Free inquiry _vs._ conventional stultification;\r\n       { Free speech and a free press _vs._ the surveillance\r\n       {  of a mercenary police;\r\n       { The political equality of classes _vs._ the inequality of\r\n       {  ruling, servile, and disfranchised classes;\r\n       { Respect for the affections _vs._ disregard for ties of\r\n       {  home and family;\r\n       { Wages labor _vs._ compulsory labor;\r\n  III. { The dignity of labor _vs._ the opprobrium and servility\r\n       {  of labor;\r\n       { A healthy industrial activity _vs._ indolence and\r\n       {  crushing toil;\r\n       { The continual specialization of industry _vs._ industrial\r\n       {  sameness;\r\n       { Incentives to invention and improvement _vs._ mechanical\r\n       {  inactivity;\r\n       { A constantly renewed soil _vs._ an exhausted one;\r\n       { A great navy and flourishing commerce _vs._ general\r\n       {  commercial apathy;\r\n       { Great industrial prosperity _vs._ industrial\r\n       {  stagnation;\r\n       { Greater variety and versatility in life _vs._ a narrow\r\n       {  and bigoted uniformity.\r\n\r\nAs I close the preparation of this article for the press (November\r\n26th), it becomes positively known that General Bragg is in full\r\nretreat. This is a great victory, and splendidly won. There has been no\r\n'straggling to the rear,' no faltering, no serious reverse; the entire\r\nthree days' conflict, from first to last, has gone right on. A noble\r\nvictory, and worthy of a noble cause! Soldiers from every great section\r\nof the Union--from every State almost--have stood by the side of each\r\nother in the perilous conflict. Many have fallen a sacrifice to their\r\ncountry's great cause, unity. Let homage and gratitude from the\r\ndeep-stirred heart of the nation be theirs; may they long be remembered;\r\nand may those who survive, long live to enjoy the fruits of their\r\nvictory!\r\n\r\nThe South could ill afford to lose such a battle, here and now. Not long\r\ncan she hold out in her unnatural struggle against destiny. The tide of\r\na progressive civilization will roll over her, though for a time it must\r\nneeds be crimsoned with the blood of martyrs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nÆNONE:\r\n\r\nA TALE OF SLAVE LIFE IN ROME.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nWhen, in the second year of Titus Vespasian, the Roman general Sergius\r\nVanno returned from his armed expedition in the East, and asked for\r\npublic honors, there were some in the senate who made objection. It was\r\nnot fitting, they argued, that formal tokens of national commendation\r\nshould be too readily bestowed. It had not been so in the time of their\r\nfathers. Long years of noble, self-sacrificing zeal and arduous service,\r\ncrowned with conquests of supreme importance, had then been the only\r\nacknowledged title to the prize. It was scarcely proper that the same\r\ndistinctions which had hitherto been awarded for the acquisition of the\r\nmost valuable provinces should be granted for the annexation of a mere\r\nstrip of worthless territory upon the extreme borders of the\r\nempire--wild, rugged, and inhospitable, and inhabited by nomadic tribes,\r\nwho could only be brought under a nominal authority, and who would never\r\nprove otherwise than turbulent and unprofitable subjects. Nor was it a\r\nmatter to be mentioned with especial laudation that Sergius Vanno had\r\nsucceeded in repressing, with overwhelming force, a revolt in a few of\r\nthe Ægean islands. If exploits such as these were to be so liberally\r\nrecompensed, what honors could there be left to bestow upon deeds of\r\nacknowledged brilliancy and importance?\r\n\r\nSo, with cautious discrimination, spoke some of the senators; and so, in\r\nthe secrecy of their hearts, most of them thought. But against all this\r\nwere brought to bear, not only the influence which Sergius naturally\r\ncommanded as a patrician of the highest rank, but also the far more\r\npowerful pressure of popular clamor. Sergius was a favorite with the\r\npeople. His noble birth and lineage entitled him to their respect. He\r\nwas of a rare type of manly beauty--was wealthy, and used his gold with\r\nliberality--gave abundant largesses to the poorer classes--was lavish in\r\nhis expenditure upon the arts--did not disdain, at times, to descend\r\nfrom his natural station and associate with his inferiors, thereby\r\npleasing the fancy of the masses for social equality--patronized poets\r\nand actors, who, in return, sang or spouted his praise, and thus still\r\nfurther added to his fame--and was noted for a bold, frank, out-spoken\r\ndemeanor, which tended to conciliate all classes with him. These were\r\nvirtues not always to be found combined in one person. Moreover, he was\r\nimpulsively brave; and, though still young, was gifted with more than\r\nordinary military genius, and had carried on his campaign with that\r\nrashly daring energy which, when rewarded with success, never fails to\r\ncommend its possessor to popular adulation. In addition to all this,\r\nother considerations of a less personal character exerted their\r\ninfluence. Many months had elapsed since Rome had enjoyed any great\r\ncivic festivity, and the people had begun to long for a new stimulant.\r\nThe completion of the colossal Flavian amphitheatre had been delayed\r\nbeyond public expectation; and though its speedy inauguration had been\r\nannounced, there was serious doubt whether the lower and more turbulent\r\norders of the populace, so long restrained, would possess themselves\r\nwith sufficient patience to await the occasion with proper calmness. In\r\nfact, some outlet must be given to their excited appetite for novelty;\r\nand therefore, after much solemn consideration, the senate yielded to\r\nthe public clamor, and voted an ovation.\r\n\r\nAs a token of national appreciation, therefore, the honor thus bestowed\r\nupon Sergius Vanno was not one of the first order; nor were such\r\npageants a novelty to the Roman people. Several times before, within the\r\nmemory of that generation, victorious generals had entered the city with\r\nmyrtle wreaths upon their brows, and had exhibited to applauding throngs\r\nthe gathered wealth of conquered provinces. Nor had many years elapsed\r\nsince the present emperor--then prince--crowned with the richer and more\r\nlavish glories of a triumph, had ridden through the Via Sacra, greeted\r\nwith welcoming acclamations as the destroyer of the Jewish\r\ncapital--displaying before him the spoils of the sacred temple, and\r\nbringing in his train such thousands upon thousands of captives, that it\r\nhad seemed as though all Palestine was being emptied into Rome. Compared\r\nwith such exploits, those of Sergius were of trifling importance. But it\r\nnow entered little into the minds of the people to make these\r\ncomparisons. Whatever had been done in past time by other commanders,\r\nwas not worth considering at present. Whoever might have been renowned\r\nbefore, Sergius Vanno was the hero of to-day. To him should be all the\r\nhonor which tens of thousands of ringing voices and applauding hands\r\ncould lavish. And therefore, once more, as in the days of the past, the\r\nbalconies of the palaces and villas lining the broad Sacra Via were\r\ngorgeous with rich gold and purple tapestries--the Forum glowed bright\r\nand resplendent with statues and decorated arches--altars smoked with\r\nsacrifice in front of columned temples--and the walls and slopes of the\r\nPalatine Hill were joyous with triumphal tokens, while, upon the summit,\r\nthe house of the Cæsars glittered with banners and brave devices, and\r\nsuch costly adornments as were best fitted to grace the festivity and do\r\nhonor to the exploits of a much-esteemed subject.\r\n\r\nWe know the scene. At first--in the full blaze of the noonday\r\nsun--standing silent and nearly deserted, except by a few workmen and\r\nartisans, who here and there lingered to complete the festive\r\npreparations, or by scattered parties of the prætorian guard, who, in\r\nholiday armor, moved slowly to and fro, to watch that order was\r\nmaintained. Later--when the shadows deepened, and the air grew\r\ncooler--the avenues and prominent positions along the established route\r\nof the ovation beginning to fill with that great concourse of varied\r\nnationalities and conditions which only the imperial city could display.\r\nIn the open streets a disorderly rabble of slaves and bondmen--pouring\r\nin steady streams from their kennels behind the palaces and from the\r\nunhealthy purlieus of such quarters as had been spared from the\r\narchitectural encroachments of the wealthy, and allowed to fester in\r\ntheir own neglected corruption. Gathered together in close fraternity,\r\nthe Briton, the Goth, the African, and the Jew--each bearing his badge\r\nof life-long servitude, some even wearing marks of recent chastisement,\r\nbut almost all awaiting the approaching spectacle with pleased and\r\nanimated countenances, and in seeming forgetfulness that so many of\r\ntheir own number had graced former displays, and, by their degradation,\r\nhad afforded amusement to other equally unsympathetic concourses. Among\r\nthem, the lesser Romans--citizens in name, indeed, but, from their\r\npoverty and the overbearing exactions of the patricians, almost as much\r\nin slavery as those around them--disdainfully asserting their free\r\nbirth, and in turn contemned by the slaves themselves, as men to whom\r\nliberty was but another title for slow starvation, and who would not\r\ndare to resent the vilest insults heaped upon them by noble-owned and\r\nprotected menials--and now equally with the common herd obliged to\r\nsubmit to the strong argument of sword and lance, as, every little\r\nwhile, the soldiers along the line drove the whole writhing crowd,\r\nwithout distinction, into smaller and more confined compass. Here and\r\nthere, knights and soldiers of high rank--riding up on horseback, and\r\npushing through the struggling mass of slaves to the front, or more\r\nleisurely, but to equal purpose, waiting until their own menials had\r\ngone before, and, with mingled threats and blows, had cleared out a\r\nvacant space for them. Other crowds, standing in favorable positions\r\nupon housetops and upon hastily constructed stagings; and more\r\nespecially upon the great amphitheatre, whose arches were blackened with\r\nclusters of spectators, and whose summit, in place of the last few\r\nlayers of stone, so soon to be adjusted, had its deep human fringe. Upon\r\npalace balconies, patricians and noble ladies, displaying a dazzling\r\narray of gold and purple and rare jewelry, and attended by Ethiopian\r\nslaves, who, in glittering armlets, stood behind, holding feathered\r\ncanopies to shield their mistresses from the sun. All this confusing\r\nconcourse of wealth and poverty each moment increasing in breadth, and\r\ndensity, as every avenue emptied new swarms into the packed arena, until\r\nit seemed as though not only all Rome, but half the empire had gathered\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nLater yet, the music of flutes and hautboys--which, for a time, had been\r\nonly indistinctly heard--breaking upon the ear with a clearer sound, and\r\nthe van of the procession suddenly emerging into full view from behind\r\nthe Circus Maximus, and, accompanied by the ringing shout of thousands\r\nspreading abroad new and louder welcomes, beginning to file past with\r\nrapid steps. First in order, the magistrates in full official robes; the\r\nspoils of war; the white sheep dressed for the sacrifice, and the\r\npriests bearing the holy vessels of the altar; gay trappings, flaunting\r\nstandards, and all that could most readily inspire the heart with\r\nelation and enthusiasm. After these, and guarded on either side by\r\ndetached parties of troops, the captives, of barbaric and Grecian origin\r\nmostly, but here and there interspersed with men of other races--Jews,\r\nSyrians, and Huns--who, through contiguity of place or love of arms or\r\nself-interest, or a kindred hatred of the Roman rule, had been drawn\r\ninto the battle--and who, having bravely stood their ground, striving\r\nfor success, and with hearts well prepared for the consequences of\r\nfailure, had been overtaken by the usual defeat, and dragged into utter\r\nand hopeless slavery. Among them, men of the Ethiopian race, also--who,\r\nhaving been slaves in Greece, had fought, not for principle or for\r\nfreedom, but simply at their owners' bidding, and had thereby, upon\r\nbeing overcome, merely changed one class of masters for another--owners\r\nand slaves now knowing no difference in position, but standing involved\r\nin the same common fate. Some appearing defiant, others downcast and\r\nsullen, a few excited and curious, most of them walking with unfettered\r\nlimbs, but here and there one heavily chained, betokening a fierce and\r\nunsubdued nature, upon which it was still necessary to put restraint.\r\nAll marching or being dragged along at an equal pace; sometimes with an\r\napproximation to military exactness--at other points breaking into a\r\nconfused mass, as women and children clung despairingly together and\r\nprevented the maintenance of any regular order. Around them, the\r\nspectators closely pressing, with morbid curiosity, discussing with loud\r\napproval the value of whatever of strength or beauty met their eyes, and\r\noccasionally greeting some undersized and misshapen victim with jeers of\r\nderision. And closing up the straggling line, more soldiers, marching in\r\nwell-formed ranks, poising aloft myrtle-decked lances, and, while\r\ninterchanging salutations with the eddying crowd, singing in measured\r\ncadence their songs of victory.\r\n\r\nAnd at last, as the sun sank yet lower toward the horizon, a yet\r\nbrighter brilliancy investing the scene, as far down the line new shouts\r\narose, and the struggling throng caught up the loud acclaim and carried\r\nit onward like a great wave, betokening the speedy approach of the most\r\ndistinguished feature of the procession--the conqueror himself--hailed\r\nImperator by his troops--with his most noble friends clustered about\r\nhim, the myrtle wreath encircling his brow, and his earnest gaze fixed\r\nupon the Capitol, the honorable termination of his route.\r\n\r\nIn every respect, indeed--except in the display of those few distinctive\r\nformalities required to mark, as with a legal stamp, the actual and\r\ncomparative value of the honor--the same old familiar story, so often\r\nhitherto rehearsed upon that line of Sacra Via and of Forum: incense\r\nburning upon the altars, which had blazed for other heroes; garlands\r\nhanging from the arches which had graced past festivities; and surging\r\ncrowds, heedful only of the present glory, and, with the customary\r\npopular fickleness, ready to forget it all as soon as the fleeting\r\npageant should be over, now with indiscriminating zeal cheering the\r\nmarch of Sergius Vanno as frantically as in other days they had greeted\r\nthe triumphal cars of Cæsar and of Vespasian.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGradually the sun approached and dipped below the blue line of extended\r\nplain which lay between the city and the sea; the long shadows of\r\nafternoon began to blend into the one deeper shade of evening; the\r\ngroups of distant buildings became more and more indistinct; the arches\r\nof the Colosseum softly faded away, leaving but a broad mass of unbroken\r\nwall; upon the Palatine Hill the great house of the Cæsars shone less\r\nand less gloriously as the sky darkened behind the pile of decorated\r\nroofs; here and there a light gleamed from some distant quarter; here\r\nand there stars began to glisten in the sky.\r\n\r\nThen the concourse of people, who had waited so long and patiently,\r\nbegan to break apart. The pageant was not yet entirely over, for fresh\r\nbattalions of soldiers still marched past at rapid pace, tuning their\r\nsteady tramp to the cadence of their songs of triumph. But the great\r\nfeature of the occasion--the conqueror himself--had ridden by; and what\r\nyet remained was but a faint recapitulation of the glories which had\r\ngone before. Therefore the patricians retired from their balconies, the\r\nhorsemen abandoned their stations and plunged down the many streets\r\nwhich led out from the Forum, and the crowd of slaves and menial\r\ncitizens, already rendered so indistinct in the fading light as to\r\nresemble one writhing, struggling monster rather than separate beings,\r\nbegan to stretch out its long arms into the narrow lanes and byways, and\r\nso gradually to melt away.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing from the front balcony of the Vanno palace, where, shielded\r\nfrom the sun, she had sat and watched the procession pass by, Ænone, the\r\nyoung and fair wife of the conqueror, now sought rest and retirement in\r\nan inner apartment. Thither one of her women had preceded her, and had\r\ndrawn forward a cushioned lounge, had beaten up the silken pillows, had\r\nplaced a table near at hand, with a light repast spread upon it, had\r\ntrimmed and filled with fresh olive oil the large bronze lamp which\r\nswung from the ceiling, and now stood by awaiting further orders.\r\n\r\nThrowing herself upon the lounge, Ænone covered her face with her hands.\r\nWhat unbidden thought was it that came creeping into her heart to\r\ntrouble her? Why was it that something of the bright joyousness of\r\nspirit with which she looked forward to that day had vanished? Surely\r\nnothing had occurred which of itself could bring to her either sorrow or\r\nrepining. All things had happened as she had anticipated. She had seen\r\nher honored lord pass by with the myrtle wreath upon his brow, his most\r\nworthy officers at his side, and his bravest guards around him. She had\r\nseen that he was strong and without wound, as he had departed from her.\r\nShe had heard the shouts of applause which had welcomed his approach as\r\nthough he were a god; and, with her heart generously and unselfishly\r\nalive only to his honor, and unable to realize that all this frantic joy\r\nand adulation were not the passion of the nation's life, but were merely\r\none single, careless throb of its fevered pulse, she had rejoiced with\r\nhim, believing that he had indeed done what had made him the greatest of\r\nall living men. And, better than all, amid this scene of triumph, he had\r\nnot seemed unmindful of her, for he had looked up and waved to her a\r\nsalute, which the responsive crowd had joined in and carried along with\r\nredoubled acclamations, and he had sent to her his most trusty slave\r\nwith a loving message. What, then, could she ask more?\r\n\r\nNothing that she could name, or that if she named, to others, would have\r\nseemed a reasonable desire. And yet at her heart there was a certain\r\ndim, indistinct foreboding of evil, which she could not entirely\r\nrepress. Was it that, in his glance, as he rode by and beheld her\r\nawaiting him, there was less of longing love than of gratified pride? Or\r\ndid that flush upon his bronzed face indicate too surely his enjoyment\r\nof this pageant for its own sake rather than for the pleasure which he\r\nmight have supposed that she would derive from it? Was it from\r\nforgetfulness of her that, after he had ridden past, he did not again\r\nlook back to wave one more recognition, but rather seemed to gaze\r\neagerly forward to where the assembled senators stood ready to greet\r\nhim? Or, on the contrary, were all these merely vague and empty\r\nimaginings arising from the exhaustion and wearisomeness of long,\r\nimpatient waiting?\r\n\r\nAt length, raising her head, she saw her attendant bondwoman standing at\r\nthe distance of a few paces, with her hands crossed upon her breast. The\r\nsteady tramp of marching troops outside had ceased, for the last\r\nbattalion had passed; and now the only sound was the silver bubbling and\r\nplashing of a little fountain that adorned the courtyard upon which the\r\nwindow of the apartment looked out.\r\n\r\n'The pageant is over now,' said Ænone, 'and he will soon be here. Let me\r\nknow as soon as my lord returns.'\r\n\r\nThe woman bowed her head in silence; and then, feeling that nothing more\r\nwas wanted of her, slowly turned to depart. As she did so, a new comer\r\nentered the room--a male slave of Gallic birth, who, by reason of his\r\nlofty stature as well as wonderful strength, had been promoted from the\r\nlowest order of servitude to become Sergius Vanno's armor bearer and\r\nchief attendant. In that capacity he had fought through the late\r\ncampaign, and had now returned, bearing among his fellows his own share\r\nof honor for successful and daring exploits. He had been released from\r\npersonal attendance only a few moments before, and was now carrying back\r\nhis master's sword and buckler, to hang them up in their accustomed\r\nplace, and himself subside into well-earned idleness. Being the first\r\ntime, for many months, that he had seen his mistress, he muttered some\r\nrough ejaculations expressive of servile devotion, and then stood in\r\nlazy attitude awaiting her permission to speak further.\r\n\r\n'Your master, Drumo?'\r\n\r\n'Will not return to-night,' the man responded. 'The emperor demands his\r\npresence.'\r\n\r\n'And that will detain him--'\r\n\r\n'He knows not how long. But immediately after that there is to be a\r\nbrave feast at the house of the poet Emilius, and it will doubtless be\r\nmorning before they separate.'\r\n\r\n'He bade you tell me this?'\r\n\r\nThe giant nodded.\r\n\r\n'It is well. That is all; you can go. You may both go, for I would be\r\nalone.'\r\n\r\nThe armor bearer turned upon his heel and strode away, the sword and\r\nbuckler, together with his own rougher trappings, rattling at his back\r\nas he passed down the hall; and behind him slowly crept away the\r\nbondwoman. And Ænone, once more leaning back upon the lounge, gave\r\nherself up to sombre reflection.\r\n\r\nIt was of course no more than proper, she mused, that her lord should\r\nobey the behests of the emperor and wait upon him. Perhaps new honors\r\nwould then be showered down; and, at the least, it was no light\r\nprivilege to stand in the presence of the ruler of the world, and there\r\ngive personal narration of his exploits. But when that interview was\r\nover, what need to join the revels of another household, instead of\r\nhurrying back to place his newly won garlands at her feet?\r\n\r\nShe pondered upon the dubious reputation which attached to the house of\r\nthe poet Emilius, and recalled the terrible stories which, from time to\r\ntime, she had heard regarding it. What might be the realities of the\r\nscenes there enacted, none could truly tell, except the few most\r\nintimate frequenters of the place; but report gave no flattering\r\ndescription of them. Even among the Roman ladies with whom she was\r\nassociated, and whose information was confined to such stray bits of\r\ngossip as they had picked up from slaves and menials, and who, standing\r\nin unconscious awe of her simple purity of heart, often forebore to\r\nspeak with her as freely and unguardedly as with each other, she had\r\noccasionally heard such startling tales of the wild dissipations there\r\nenacted, as surpassed conception, and left her horrified senses no calm\r\nrefuge except in unbelief. The gorgeous feasts, the night-long\r\nlibations, the social intimacy with dancing girls and gladiators, the\r\nmockery of all that was pure and holy, the derisive insults to the gods\r\nthemselves--these were practices which the public voice connected with\r\nthe house of Emilius, not as occasional outbreaks of wild frivolity, but\r\nas the fixed habits of his daily life. And if these things were true,\r\nwhat claim of pride or policy could such a place advance to distract her\r\nlord from the allegiance due to his own home alone?\r\n\r\nBut possibly these things might not be true. She reflected that the poet\r\nwas wealthy; and as long as the world continues to be envious, riches\r\nwill seldom fail to bring false report upon their possessor. He was a\r\nman of genius, also; and all such can scarcely fail to find rivals who\r\nwill turn satirists and attack them in their homes and daily life.\r\nCertainly, it is not difficult for slander to magnify the genial\r\ngatherings of kindred spirits into scenes of wild debauchery. And it\r\nwas also true, that if mere outside appearance is of any value as an\r\nindex of what is hidden, the slight figure, the pale and almost girlish\r\nface, and the winning and courteous demeanor of the poet were far from\r\nindicating a man of low and debasing inclinations. Moreover, his\r\nwritings as surely spoke the contrary; and as she thus reasoned, Ænone\r\nlifted from its case a vellum roll with which Emilius himself had\r\npresented her, containing many of his poems, exquisitely engrossed.\r\nThese poems treated not upon the pleasures of wine and love--those\r\nfruitful and ever-varying subjects of the Horatian school. Instead of\r\nthis, they pursued, in deep-sounding and majestically rolling dactyls,\r\nthe less favorite and trodden track of Socrates and Plato, and\r\ndiscoursed upon temperance and honor--upon the satisfaction derived from\r\na well-spent life, and the delights attending a peaceful death--upon the\r\nimmateriality of the soul, and the reward bestowed by the gods upon\r\nthose who have honored them by leading a virtuous career. As Ænone\r\nslowly turned over leaf after leaf of the parchment roll, she felt her\r\nheart perplexed within her. She could scarcely believe that none of\r\nthose tales of reckless dissipation were true, for she remembered that\r\nsome of them had reached her ear attended by evidence so circumstantial\r\nthat it was impossible to reject them; but, if true, how account for\r\nthese grand maxims of lofty morality? What object could their author\r\nhave in thus uselessly playing the hypocrite, when amatory and\r\nbacchanalian choruses would not only have been more consonant with his\r\nown feelings, but doubtless more acceptable to the world? She had not\r\nyet learned what it often takes the wisest man a lifetime to\r\ndiscover--that every inconsistency of conduct is not hypocrisy, but that\r\nit is one of the most common idiosyncrasies of the mind to write and\r\nbelieve one thing, and as self-approvingly to feel and act the reverse.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh she closed the volume, and restored it to its place within\r\nthe case. Why ponder upon such things as these? The real character of\r\nthe poet Emilius was, after all, a matter of but little consequence to\r\nher. Whether the meeting at his house was a wild, reckless orgy, or a\r\nmere intellectual gathering of literary genius, it was none the less\r\ncertain that her lord was tarrying there, away from her side. But\r\nperhaps, indeed, even this was a duty which he owed to his fame and\r\nstation; and her face brightened up with new hope as the suggestion\r\nflashed upon her. It might be that at this feast there would be present\r\nsome poet of lofty epic powers, or historian of wondrous descriptive\r\ntalent, ranking as the brightest star of Roman literature; and either of\r\nthese, if properly conciliated, would doubtless celebrate her lord's\r\nexploits so grandly that in future ages his campaign would shine with\r\nfar greater lustre than if simply committed to parchment in the dry\r\ndetail of unadorned fact, and so filed away in the national archives. It\r\nwas most fitting, therefore, that he should not permit his impatient\r\nlove for her to allow him to neglect the opportunity of cultivating, by\r\na wise and condescending courtesy, the world-renowned talents of these\r\nmen, and thereby redoubling the resplendence of his own bright fame.\r\n\r\nEasily satisfying her mind with this pleasing reasoning, she retired for\r\nthe night into the innermost apartment--a retreat adorned with every\r\nluxury which could gratify pride and administer to a cultivated taste.\r\nThe floor was covered with tesselated marbles of different shades and\r\narranged in ingenious and novel patterns. The ceiling was resplendent\r\nwith allegorical frescoes by the most celebrated masters of the day.\r\nThere were glowing paintings upon the walls, rich tapestries in the\r\nwindows, embroidered hangings upon the bed. Beside the tables stood\r\nbronze figures holding forth lamps ready trimmed and lighted; fresh\r\nflowers had been placed in their allotted vases, and weighed down the\r\nair with perfume; and in a deep recess stood the bath ready filled, and\r\nscented with carefully plucked rose leaves floating upon the water. But\r\nall this display of magnificent luxury and elaborate taste, if regarded\r\nby her at all, now seemed to affect her with weariness rather than with\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nWhy, as she lay down upon her couch, and prepared to yield herself up to\r\npleasant slumber, did her thoughts wander back to the time when poverty\r\ninstead of luxury had been her lot? Why did those olden memories of the\r\npast so strongly haunt her? They were, perhaps, never entirely absent\r\nfrom her heart; but now they thronged about her with a force that would\r\nnot bear repression. Perhaps it was that the very magnificence and pomp\r\nof power of which she was now the centre, recalled the memory of the\r\ndistant past, by virtue of strong contrast alone; perhaps that the\r\nunsatisfied longing and vague foreboding of her soul necessarily\r\nimpressed upon her the consciousness that wealth and honor alone cannot\r\ngive perfect happiness, and thereby naturally led her thoughts back to\r\nthe time when she had found true content in poverty and loneliness.\r\nHowever that might be, now, as she closed her eyes and shut out the view\r\nof the costly adornments around her, more vividly than ever before were\r\npictured before her mind the scenes of her childhood: her father's\r\ncottage on the outskirts of Ostia--the olive grove upon the slope\r\nbehind--the roadside well, where the villagers would sometimes gather\r\nabout some invalided soldier from the German army, and listen to his\r\ntales of the last campaign--and in front, the bay, sparkling in the\r\nbright glare of the sun and laden with the corn-freighted ships of\r\nAlexandria.\r\n\r\nAnd there, too, was the old wave-worn rock--the scene of her life's only\r\nromance--where, stealing out from her father's cabin at the evening\r\nhour, and seating herself so close to the waterline that the spray of\r\nthe tideless sea would dash up and bathe her naked feet, she would wait\r\nin all innocence for the coming of the young sailor from Samos. How\r\nrapidly those hours used to pass! How pleadingly, on the last evening,\r\nhe had knelt beside her, with his arm resting upon her knee, and there,\r\ngazing up into her face, had asked her for one long tress of hair! How\r\nfoolish she had been to give it to him; and how earnestly he had vowed\r\nthat he would come back some day, no longer poor and forlorn, but in his\r\nown two-masted vessel, with full banks of oars, manned by the slaves\r\nwhom he would capture, and would then bear her away unto his own home!\r\nAnd how, like a silly girl, she had believed him, as though wandering\r\nsailor boys ever did come back to seek the loving hearts which had\r\ntrusted them! And so the year had passed away, and, as she might well\r\nhave known from the first, he had not returned. Nor was it to her\r\nregret; for but a little afterward the youthful patrician, already\r\nflushed with budding honors, had chanced to meet her; had loved her with\r\na generous passion, lifting him above all sordid calculation about\r\nwealth or social differences, and had taught her in turn to bestow upon\r\nhim an affection more true and absorbing than she had yet believed her\r\nheart was able to contain. And so her first romantic dream had ended, as\r\nall such childish dreams are apt to end. Let it go. Her heart had found\r\nits true bourne; she could well look back upon the past without regret,\r\nand smile at the youthful fancies connected with it.\r\n\r\nOne prayer to the gods--a further special invocation to her favorite\r\ngoddess, who, at the foot of the couch, stretched forth marble arms\r\nlovingly toward her--and then the silver tinkling of the little\r\ncourtyard fountain lulled her softly to sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCARL FRIEDRICH NEUMANN, THE GERMAN HISTORIAN OF OUR COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first volume of a history of the United States by Carl Friedrich\r\nNeumann, of Berlin,[2] has just been announced as the first history of\r\nour country ever written originally in the German language. The\r\nappearance of such a work at this juncture in our national existence, is\r\na noteworthy event, and the man who takes so unique an interest in our\r\naffairs should be introduced to our people. Having known him personally\r\nand intimately for many years, I shall attempt such sketch, making much\r\nof it anecdotal, for which purpose material is not wanting.\r\n\r\nDr. Neumann, born near Bamberg, in the kingdom of Bavaria, of Jewish\r\nparents, is now about sixty-five years of age, was educated at\r\nHeidelberg, passed over to the Protestant church at Munich, afterward\r\nattended lectures at Göttingen, and soon after became rector of the\r\ngymnasium at Speyer, but was dismissed from this place on account of the\r\nfreedom with which he expressed himself on some religious topics in his\r\nhistorical teachings. He gave private lessons for a time in Munich, and\r\nthen went to learn in a Benedictine monastery in Venice the Armenian\r\nlanguage. This was in 1827. In 1829 he studied the Chinese language in\r\nParis, went over to London, and sailed thence to visit India and China.\r\nHe collected for himself about ten thousand volumes of Chinese works,\r\nembracing every department of the literature of this language, and\r\nbought for the Royal Library at Berlin two thousand four hundred\r\nvolumes. Such collections had been till then unknown in Europe, and\r\nhence this was quite an event. Returning in 1831 from India, he made a\r\npresent of all his Chinese books to the Royal Library at Munich, and was\r\nappointed conservator of this collection, and professor of Chinese and\r\nArmenian in the university of that capital.\r\n\r\nOf Dr. Neumann's attainments in Oriental literature I know only what\r\nfame says, nor does it concern us much in this sketch. I once, however,\r\nsat with him in a retiring room of the Munich Museum (a great reading\r\nroom), when Baron Tautphoeus, whose accomplished wife is so well known\r\nin this country as authoress of the 'Initials' and 'Quits,' entered, and\r\nasked if we had seen the notice of Dr. Neumann in the last number of the\r\nLondon _Times_. The doctor had read it; I had not, but immediately did\r\nso. It made him the equal of the greatest orientalists of the past and\r\npresent ages, comparing him particularly with Klaproth. The _Times_, it\r\nis true, had a motive for this notice, as always, both in its praises\r\nand its lampoons. It had found views of Dr. Neumann on British India\r\nwhich it desired to commend, but even in our view this would not cancel\r\nthe eulogy. His authorship in connection with Chinese and Armenian\r\nphilosophy and history is very considerable, and outside of this field\r\nhe won, in 1847, a prize offered by the French Institute for the best\r\nwork on the 'Historical Development of the Peoples of Southern Russia.'\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done in the university in Chinese and Armenian, he of\r\ncourse did; but his lectures took a much wider range, embracing general\r\nhistory and ethnography. His powers of elocution were of a high order,\r\nand crowds of students were drawn to his lecture room. That freedom of\r\nutterance which cost him the rectorship at Speyer, was like Dr. Watts's\r\nor Pope's instinct for making rhymes--it was his nature, and could not\r\nbe whipped out of him; and it was equally natural that it should assume\r\nthe form of wit and humor.\r\n\r\nThere are not a few anecdotes in the popular mouth illustrating this\r\ntrait. He seems to have had no great liking to that race of men called\r\nkings, and it is said that he once alluded to them, in a lecture, in the\r\nnot very respectful remark that 'they were numbered, like the hacks in\r\nour streets.' The reader's apprehension of the point of another\r\nanecdote, in which Dr. Neumann appears in an attitude not very\r\nrespectful to his own sovereign, Louis II of Bavaria, will depend upon\r\nhis knowing something of the situation and history of the university\r\nbuildings in Munich. The king, among the many things he did for the\r\narchitectural adorning of the city, built a street to be called by his\r\nname. It is all outside of the old wall, and its outer end is closed by\r\na triumphal arch. Next to this, and outside of the city as it _then_\r\nwas, the king purchased ground, perhaps because it was cheap, and built\r\nthe present university edifice. As much farther out of the then city\r\nproper lies the miserable little town of Schwabing. Professors and\r\nstudents disliked to be taken so far from their lodgings and their\r\nbeerhouses, and the old university had been quite within the city. When\r\nthe removal took place, Dr. Neumann sketched the history of the\r\ninstitution in a lecture, referring to its original establishment at\r\nIngolstadt, its removal thence to Landschut, and thence to Munich, and\r\nthen added, that _'his Majesty King Louis II had now been pleased to\r\nremove it to Schwabing_.' We can imagine the sensation which such a\r\nsally would produce among students already stirred up for its\r\nappreciation, by having to walk from a half mile to a mile from those\r\ndepots of beer barrels from which so many of them sucked their sluggish\r\nlife and inspiration. But such jokes were not treason, or contempt of\r\nmajesty, or anything else against law.\r\n\r\nIt should be added in this connection, for Dr. Neumann's benefit, that\r\nthese stories, and many of the kind, are floating around, and are just\r\nlike him, but I have never had any confirmation of them from him, and in\r\nall our intercourse, which was frequent and intimate for six years,\r\nwhile he spoke much and freely in favor of democratical and against\r\nmonarchical institutions, I never found him indulging in coarse and\r\nclamorous denunciations of his king or Government.\r\n\r\nWhen the great revolutionary movement of 1848 broke upon the land, the\r\nsovereigns of Germany saw and accepted their condition. The popular mind\r\nwas so penetrated by this unrest, and the revolutionary leaders were so\r\nsubstantial in character, that resistance was folly, and the monarchs\r\nyielded, waiting the time when some change would enable them to divide\r\nthe revolutionists and turn them against each other. They allowed and\r\neven encouraged the formation at Frankfort of a provisional Parliament,\r\ncalled the Fore-Parliament, which looked toward a permanent central\r\nGovernment at that place for united Germany. Of this body Dr. Neumann\r\nwas a member. It was a fine field for the display of his free and\r\nliberal instincts, and we cannot conceive of his passing through its\r\ndebates without making large drafts upon his exhaustless fund of humor\r\nand sarcasm. It would be strange, indeed, if he could witness the dawn\r\nof that freedom which he loved without showing signs of exultation,\r\naccompanied with occasional taunts at the regime which was passing away\r\nand seemed already beyond recovery.\r\n\r\nBut, although a regular Parliament followed--although a quasi emperor\r\nwas elected in the person of the Archduke John of Austria, and\r\nhis way, as he proceeded to Frankfort, was a perfect triumphal\r\nprocession--although he selected his ministers, set them to work, and\r\nParliament was progressing with its constitution, and this continued for\r\nalmost a year, still, that which the shrewd ministers of some of the\r\nsovereigns had doubtless foreseen and waited for, came. Radicals outran\r\ntheir wiser and more rational brethren, and took up arms. They would\r\ndemolish at once those sovereignties which would have died by the slow\r\naction of time, had the central Government been fully established and\r\nwisely administered. But this new Government rather deliberated than\r\nacted. That which more than all else arouses the German mind--the\r\nSchleswig-Holstein question, identified as it is with the great question\r\nof the unity of the Teutonic race--was not taken up by the Government at\r\nFrankfort, but by that at Berlin. In the mean time the several\r\nGovernments of Bavaria, Prussia, and Austria had gained the mastery over\r\ntheir own domestic revolutions, so that they could act more freely.\r\nAustria called home its archduke and its members in the Frankfort\r\nParliament, and finally the whole movement subsided into the old order\r\nof things.\r\n\r\nThe various Governments were now in a position in which they could\r\npunish those disturbers of their peace who had endangered their very\r\nexistence. Of these Dr. Neumann was one, and in 1852 he was notified\r\nthat his lectures were no longer needed in the university of Munich. It\r\nwas doubtless thought that he would make some slight formal concessions,\r\nand be permitted to continue his active duties, as others had done. But\r\nhe felt too independent. He had means to live upon. His retiring pension\r\ncould not be withheld. He could now, moreover, give his individual\r\npowers to authorship, without feeling hampered by the thought that he\r\nhad a Government to please. He has persevered in this course,\r\nnotwithstanding the express wish of the philosophical faculty for his\r\nreturn to active duty in the university.\r\n\r\nHe had been occupied with a history of the British empire in India. To\r\nthis he gave increased attention, and published it some years ago; but\r\nthe Indian rebellion breaking out soon after its publication, he was led\r\nto sketch its history as an appendix. His investigations in the East\r\nbrought him in contact with the peculiar history of the Japanese empire,\r\nand he threw off by the way a brief history of Japan, devoting a chapter\r\nto the results of the American expedition thither.\r\n\r\nIt was while prosecuting his inquiries into the history of Eastern Asia,\r\nthat he met with such evidences of the commercial enterprise of the\r\nUnited States, and obtained such views of the future of our country, as\r\nto conceive the thought of writing its history for the German people,\r\ncommencing with the war of 1812, the point at which he considered our\r\nwonderful growth and expansion to have begun; and long before finishing\r\nhis history of British India, he was collecting material for this work.\r\nHe found, however, that he could not begin at the point he had chosen\r\nwithout striking upon roots and rudely severing them, which had struck\r\ndeeply into the soil of all the earlier periods of our existence. His\r\nplan was therefore enlarged.\r\n\r\nThe breaking out of the rebellion was a sad blow to him--it could not\r\nhave been more so to an American. It was likely not only to spoil _our_\r\ncountry, but _his_ history of it. It either cut off or dimmed or\r\nconfused that prospect of growth and expansion which had been stretched\r\nout interminably before him. He read the daily London _Times_--he had\r\nfor years taken the New York _Herald_, and his reliance upon this sheet\r\nhad been rather too implicit. Years before the breaking out of the\r\nrebellion, I had suggested this, and introduced to him the New York\r\n_Times_ and _Evening Post_, one of which he has taken ever since, not,\r\nhowever, without occasional intervals of sighing for his old companion\r\nthe _Herald_, much as his ancestors, after having left Egypt, sighed\r\nfor its leeks and onions. Although he coupled the _Herald_ and London\r\n_Times_--_par nobile fratrum_--as joint sharers of a favorite epithet of\r\nhis--_great liars_--he still liked to read them.\r\n\r\nDr. Neumann had been a Democrat in his politics--for he was familiar\r\nwith our distinctions in this country--but since the outbreak of the\r\nrebellion he has scarcely known where to place himself. He had made the\r\npersonal acquaintance of Buchanan, when that 'old public functionary'\r\nwas our Minister in London, and felt, as was quite natural, a little\r\nvain of this acquaintance when Buchanan became the head of the\r\nGovernment of that unseen land of his most enthusiastic admiration. The\r\nman, however, was less than the country, and he could drop him; but he\r\nstill desired to see him succeeded by a Democrat. We often had little\r\nspats, in which I took the ground that such had been the extravagant\r\ndemands of the South, made through the platforms of that party, that\r\nwith the strongest predilections for some of its men and its earlier\r\nantecedents, I should have felt bound to vote for both Fremont and\r\nLincoln, if I had been in the country. He would generally end the matter\r\nby a pleasant and jocular dissent, calling himself a Democrat and me a\r\nRepublican. But _after the rebellion_, his friends never knew what he\r\nwas, except that he was for the Union and the putting down of the\r\nrebels. No American could have felt in deeper sympathy with our cause.\r\nIn that land, where a thousand volunteers could not be raised to save a\r\nthrone, how did his heart swell with just pride when the President\r\ncalled for seventy-five thousand, and afterward in succession for\r\nhundreds of thousands, and they came forth at the call! How depressed at\r\ninstances of want of skill or decision in Government or generals! He\r\nnearly lost his patience with young men who were quietly pursuing their\r\nstudies in Europe, when their country was in peril and its armies needed\r\nthem; and he quite lost it when he met Americans who sympathized with\r\nthe rebellion, or even seemed indifferent to their country's fortunes.\r\n\r\nThere was an American lady in Munich, soon after the rebellion broke\r\nout, whose husband had died some years before, while holding a position\r\nin the army which entitled her to a pension, for which she had drawn\r\nwhile there. She had heard of Professor Neumann's love for our country\r\nand country people, but had no idea of the strictness of his\r\ndiscrimination between the parties--thought that he might feel much like\r\nthe thousands of Germans who quietly ask us which side we are on--she\r\nmay, too, have inferred something from his having a brother in Savannah,\r\nGeorgia. She soon found her mistake; for he informed her, in terms of no\r\ndoubtful import, that his sympathy did not embrace those of her class;\r\nand thus the result of the pleasant visit she had promised herself was\r\nlittle short of being turned out doors.\r\n\r\nAbout the 10th of December, 1861, we had at our house a little company\r\nof about thirty persons, and Dr. Neumann, with his wife and two\r\ndaughters, was among them. An American gentleman, who had been known to\r\nhis family and ours, had left for Russia two years before, and returned\r\nthat very day, was one of the company, and we had not yet learned his\r\nviews of secession. The first thing with Dr. Neumann and his daughters\r\nwas to know how he stood on this question. They found him a rebel, and\r\nin giving him their minds in relation to this matter, one of the\r\ndaughters expressed to him her wonder that I should allow him to enter\r\nmy house as they would not allow him in theirs. The stir made in the\r\ncompany by this little brush at arms arrested the attention of all, and\r\ngave the Americans their first information as to where our quondam\r\nfriend stood, as well as set them an example of zeal and enthusiasm in\r\ntheir own cause.\r\n\r\nI must close this notice with an incident which lies quite outside of\r\nDr. Neumann's relations to America and Americans. On his retirement from\r\nhis university labors, he withdrew mainly from the exciting scenes of\r\npublic life. But in November, 1859, occurred the centennial anniversary\r\nof Schiller's birth. Of all the men connected with German popular\r\nliterature, Schiller is most in the hearts of the people of Germany. The\r\nspirit of liberty shown in his 'William Tell'--his exile from his native\r\nWirtemberg for the free expressions used in the first play he ever\r\nwrote--his high order of genius as a poet and historian--the subjects he\r\nchose, and the way he treated them, and, finally, his social and\r\ndomestic character, have all combined to endear him to the whole people.\r\nThis festival was everywhere observed, and with the highest enthusiasm;\r\nfor although Governments were afraid of its effects, they were still\r\nmore afraid to refuse permission to hold it. It lasted for several days,\r\non one of which was a great public dinner, with several hundred in\r\nattendance, of which Dr. Neumann consented to be one. Champagne flowed\r\nfreely, and although I did not taste this beverage, and know by\r\nexperience little of its effects, it was easy to perceive that the\r\nanimation could not all be accounted for by love to the memory even of\r\nSchiller. Poems were read, and speeches were made describing his\r\ncharacter as poet, historian, or otherwise, according to the fancy of\r\neach speaker. I remember one from Bodenstedt, than whom few stand higher\r\nin the walks of polite literature, and one from Sybel, than whom no one\r\nin Germany ranks higher as a historian. Dr. Neumann, who, like an old\r\nparade horse long withrawn from the excitements of a parade, felt amid\r\nthese scenes the spirit of former days stirred within him, rose to\r\nspeak. We shall be prepared to appreciate the effect when we get an idea\r\nof the preternatural sensitiveness of those who composed the audience. A\r\nwell-known poet, who may perhaps be called the poet-laureate of Bavaria,\r\nhad read a poem on the occasion. It contained nothing to which any one\r\ncould object, as we might infer from his position with the king, and yet\r\nI heard the poet himself say a few days afterward that the editors of a\r\ncertain well-known journal, in publishing it, left out the stanzas\r\ncontaining the word _Freiheit_ (liberty), so fearful were they of not\r\npitching their tune to a key that would suit royal and Government ears.\r\nA similar sensitiveness pervaded the whole body present--nearly all drew\r\ntheir bread and beer from the Government, and did not wish it stopped or\r\ndiminished. This class had gotten up the meeting, and hoped to control\r\nit. When they saw Dr. Neumann rise, they felt that _there_ was a man\r\n_naturally_ fearless, and _now_ quite beyond that special sense of\r\ndanger which made them cautious. Recollection passed over his seven\r\nyears' silence, and called up the power with which he had harangued in\r\nother years. Nor was it so much what he said as the man who said it,\r\nwhich produced the effect, and yet there was much in the speech. He said\r\nthat Schiller had been eulogized as a social and domestic man, poet, and\r\nhistorian; but nothing had been said of him as a _politician_, and he\r\nshould speak of him in this character. The _rising_ of _such_ a man was\r\nan electric shock, suggestive of that which in 1848 made all Europe\r\ntremble from centre to circumference. The word _politician_ was a\r\n_second_ shock, drawing with it suggestively all the concomitants of\r\nthat revolution, as yet so well remembered by all. And when he proceeded\r\nto compare Schiller with Goethe--the _former_ frankly addressing himself\r\nto his friend in correspondence on the great questions of their\r\npolitics, and trying to draw him out, the _latter_, then a minister of\r\nstate, cautiously and warily declining to expose his views--he but\r\ncarried out the impression made in his rising and his announcement. It\r\nwas the only properly stump speech--I use the phrase in the high sense\r\nin which it might be used of O'Connell or Clay--I ever heard in Germany.\r\n\r\nSuch is the man who has undertaken to write our country's history for\r\nthe Germans. Of his _work_ I have said nothing, for I have not seen it;\r\nI write this impromptu on seeing the newspaper announcement of the first\r\nvolume. He will doubtless do much to set us right in the eyes of his own\r\npeople, where, however, there is less need of this than in _another_\r\nland, whose people are more nearly related to us, where such service,\r\nhowever, is less likely to be done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT AMERICAN CRISIS.\r\n\r\n_PART THREE._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last preceding article on this subject in THE CONTINENTAL, we\r\nconcluded by considering the consequences of an early victory of the\r\nNorth over the entire South, _followed by the restoration of the old\r\nUnion upon precisely the old basis_. We showed that, in such an event,\r\nthe war would have been barren of results even to the extent of removing\r\nits own cause, or preventing its almost immediate and more desperate\r\nrenewal; that the question at issue is a question of paramount governing\r\npower between two adverse theories of social existence; between two\r\ndistinct and conflicting civilizations; between two antagonistic and\r\nirreconcilable political and moral forces; and that it must be fought\r\nout to the complete subordination of the less advanced or more barbarous\r\nand backward-tending of those forces--unless the wheels of progress on\r\nthis continent are to be reversed, and the watchword of despotism be\r\nsubstituted for that of freedom: not only that it must be fought out on\r\nthe battle field, but that the fruits of the victory must not be blindly\r\nor foolishly surrendered after the obvious and external victory is won.\r\n\r\nWe may say here, however, for the purpose of reserving the still more\r\nradical consideration of the nature of this conflict for some future\r\nday, that, adverse as these theories of social existence are--distinct\r\nand conflicting as are these two civilizations--antagonistic and\r\nirreconcilable as these contending political and moral forces now seem,\r\nand for present practical purposes must be taken to be--they are not\r\n_essentially_ irreconcilable. Slavery, bad as it is, represents a truth\r\nin the larger Compound Truth of an Integral Social Philosophy. A deeper\r\nunderstanding of the whole problem of human society, possessed by the\r\nleading personages, North and South, would have saved the necessity of\r\nthis war--would at this day even, adjust it peaceably, harmoniously, and\r\nperfectly, and would render unnecessary the whole view of the subject\r\nwhich we are now taking. The world, however, is not yet quite prepared\r\nfor the peaceable intervention of scientific and truly philosophic\r\nmethods in the settlement of its disputes; and the knowledge of the\r\nexistence, even, of such methods, is as yet too little diffused to make\r\nthem in any sense available for the purposes of the hour. The point of\r\nview from which these papers are being written, is, indeed, as stated in\r\nthe last preceding number, higher than that of the ordinary politician,\r\nthe constitutional lawyer, or even that of common statesmanship and\r\npatriotic devotion. It is a point of view from which the interests of\r\nall mankind are taken into the account, and hence pertains, in a sense,\r\nto the domain of practical philosophy, or the universal aspect of\r\npolitics; the politics of the globe and of all humanity, in all time.\r\nBut it offers still a presentation of the subject toned down to the\r\nactual state of readiness in the world to hear reason, and to be\r\ninfluenced or governed by the suggestions contained in the writing. It\r\nis therefore an adaptation to an imperfect order of things, a mixed or\r\nconcrete phase of political practical philosophy, which is the most that\r\ncan now be aspired to. The point of view in question is therefore far\r\nlower than that of a final social philosophy having its basis in a\r\nperfect scientific theory, and working out from that basis into\r\npractical life. Perhaps, as will be again suggested in the course of\r\nthis article, the events of this war may conduce to a readiness on this\r\ncontinent, or may create an earnest demand even, for higher solutions\r\nand the thorough treatment, by some competent mind, of all our Political\r\nand Sociatory problems. The day, however, for such a radical diagnosis\r\nand treatment of the disease of human society has not yet arrived.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time we must content ourselves with partial remedies,\r\nalleviations, best temporary resorts, and even desperate expedients. It\r\nis from this stand-point that the writer of these articles now speaks;\r\nthat, feeling deeply in his heart and recognizing clearly in his head\r\nthe common brotherhood and the equal essential manhood of the\r\ninhabitants of the Southern and Northern States--sympathetically and\r\nsocially drawn, even, to the Southern side, by many endearing\r\nassociations and recollections; that, clearly appreciating the\r\nfratricidal nature of this war--its essential non-necessity, if men were\r\nwise enough to avail themselves of better known and feasible,\r\nmethods--he still deliberately and forcibly insists, under the\r\ncircumstances which are, that the North should not only fight out the\r\nwar to the last word of determinate conquest, but that it should, with\r\nwise but merciless rigor, extinguish the cause of the war, and hold with\r\nunflinching hand every advantage it gains, until new institutions and\r\nnew methods of thought shall have been securely planted on every inch of\r\nthe soil of the South.\r\n\r\nSince, even, the last previous part of this series of papers was sent to\r\nthe press, new and alarming indications have appeared in various\r\nquarters, of the drift in the public mind--North--in favor of an\r\neasy-going and conceding policy toward the South as the war draws to a\r\nclose; a policy which would be nearly certain to lose to ourselves and\r\nto the world all the benefits of the war; to deprive the South, even, of\r\nthose higher and ulterior benefits which would come to her also; to\r\nleave untouched the causes of the war, and to foster its early renewal\r\nwith more than its former desperation.\r\n\r\nNot to mention the reiterated and urgent renewals of the subject of\r\nreconstruction in quarters where we are accustomed to look for a partial\r\nloyalty or a covert opposition to the war, articles like the following,\r\nfrom the New York _Times_, of November 19th, frequently appear in the\r\nundoubtedly loyal press:\r\n\r\n     'RECONSTRUCTION.--Since we have been at the trouble of\r\n     conquering the rebels in the State of Arkansas--since, after many\r\n     great victories, we have now complete military possession of the\r\n     State, and have armies posted on its eastern, western, and northern\r\n     lines, and at its capital in the centre--we think it would be worth\r\n     while in the Government to take steps to reorganize the civil\r\n     administration there, and inaugurate a system of policy such as was\r\n     adopted in Missouri two years ago, and which has proved so\r\n     successful in pacifying that State. The loyal element in Arkansas\r\n     is large, as is made evident by the action of the people wherever\r\n     our forces have penetrated, and by the enlistment of a good number\r\n     of its citizens in the armies of the Union. One of the Senators\r\n     from Arkansas, Senator Sebastian, whose term of office is as yet\r\n     unexpired, is, and always has been, we believe, a sound loyal man;\r\n     and Mr. Gantt, who was elected to Congress just before the outbreak\r\n     of the rebellion, has recently given proof of his repentance and\r\n     devotion to the Union in the remarkable address which we published\r\n     last week. We do not see why the process of reconstruction might\r\n     not be at once commenced in Arkansas, and why, before the close of\r\n     next session, the State might not have a full congressional\r\n     delegation in Washington.'\r\n\r\nNot a word is here said of the important question of Slavery. The\r\nproposition is pure and simple to readmit the rebellious State of\r\nArkansas to the Union, upon precisely the same footing as that upon\r\nwhich we retained the allegiance of Missouri--to treat, in other words,\r\nloyal and rebellious States in the same way.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent article of the same able journal, one of the organs of\r\nthe Republican party, this easy-going policy, the _laissez-faire_ of\r\nstatesmanship, is expanded at large, and explicitly adopted and\r\nrecommended. The appearance of such an article in such a quarter is such\r\na remarkable index of the existence in the public mind of the delusions\r\nwe are exposing, that we transfer it bodily to our columns, for the sake\r\nof commenting upon its positions. Calhoun's famous expression, 'masterly\r\ninactivity,' is significantly adopted as a caption:\r\n\r\n     'CIVIL POLICY TOWARD SLAVERY.--There is a class of men who\r\n     stick to the idea that something positive must be done by the\r\n     Federal Government to end slavery. Even the issue of the\r\n     Emancipation Proclamation, a military measure for military ends\r\n     solely, does not satisfy them. They want civil power exercised, and\r\n     would gladly have even a breaking down of State lines and a\r\n     reconstruction of the Government itself, as the only effectual\r\n     means of destroying the institution of their special abhorrence.\r\n\r\n     'Now we, too, claim a good hearty hatred of slavery. We are as\r\n     anxious as any to see it under the sod, beyond resurrection. But we\r\n     don't believe in making any superfluous sacrifice to get it there.\r\n     Seeing that it is dying, we are quite content to let it die\r\n     quietly, without any attempt to pull the house down about its ears\r\n     and our own ears. This seems to us to be a very absurd sort of\r\n     impatience--prompted by giddy passion rather than sober reason.\r\n\r\n     'But how do we know slavery is dying? We know it from the unanimous\r\n     testimony of all personal observers of its condition. There is not\r\n     a man within the Union lines South, however friendly he may be to\r\n     the institution, who pretends that there is any chance whatever of\r\n     its being saved, _if present causes continue_. Two things are\r\n     killing it.\r\n\r\n     '_The first is the wear and tear of the war. Military operations\r\n     always tend to disjoint and break up, within their scope, all the\r\n     relations of society. They inevitably remit, to a greater or less\r\n     extent, the social man to a state of nature. Inter arma leges\r\n     silent_. This is felt in every social connection, even the closest\r\n     and strongest; for they all are, more or less, dependent on civil\r\n     law. But it must be felt particularly in that connection, which of\r\n     all others is the most forced and arbitrary--the connection between\r\n     master and slave. Liberty is a natural instinct. The caged bird is\r\n     not surer to fly through the parted wires than the slave, in his\r\n     ordinary condition, from the broken chain--_and the chain must be\r\n     broken when the civil law, which alone gives it strength, passes\r\n     away_. There are men who complain of the anti-slavery war policy of\r\n     the President. A policy that was anything else would not be a war\r\n     policy at all. The war upon the rebellious slaveholding people of\r\n     necessity involves an interruption of their laws; and unless the\r\n     advancing army should make good this absence of civil rule by\r\n     applying its own military power to keeping watch and ward over the\r\n     slaves, and thus abandon its proper military business, the result\r\n     is inevitable _that the institution must melt away as the war goes\r\n     on_. Abraham Lincoln might be as much attached to slavery as\r\n     Jefferson Davis himself, and yet no human sagacity would enable him\r\n     to fight Jefferson Davis honestly and effectually without mortal\r\n     injury to slavery. _It is the war which kills slavery, and not the\r\n     man who leads the war_.\r\n\r\n     '_The other destroying agency in open discussion_. Slavery can live\r\n     only in silence. There is a deadly antagonism between itself and\r\n     free speech. Where the one exists the other cannot. The vitality of\r\n     the one rests in pure force, and force and reason never agree. It\r\n     always has been, and always will be, that force must either\r\n     suppress reason or reason will subvert force. One of the first acts\r\n     of the slavery propagandists in Kansas was to pass enactments\r\n     through their spurious Legislature, making it a felony, punishable\r\n     by imprisonment and hard labor, for any man to 'assert or maintain\r\n     by speaking or writing that persons have not the right to hold\r\n     slaves in this Territory.' It has been so in every Slave State, and\r\n     worse. _Not only have slave codes interdicted, in every one of\r\n     them, all adverse discussion of the institution, but a mob power\r\n     has always been at hand to take summary vengeance upon it with\r\n     Lynch law. These resorts were not a mere caprice; they were a\r\n     necessity_. Slavery being once accepted as the prime object, there\r\n     was no alternative but to protect it just in this manner. _But the\r\n     war has ended all that. There can be no mobs where the bayonet\r\n     governs; nor arbitrary local laws where general military law is\r\n     paramount. The discussion of slavery is as free now in New Orleans\r\n     as in New York_. It is no more within the province of the military\r\n     Governor, Shepley, to interfere with fair discussion there, than it\r\n     is within the rightful power of the civil Governor, Seymour, to\r\n     interfere with it here. _And in the Border States, where the civil\r\n     laws still prevail, hostility to the rebellion has excited such a\r\n     dissatisfaction with slavery as its cause, that by general consent\r\n     perfect freedom is allowed in arguing against the institution._ The\r\n     consequence of this freedom has been that Missouri has already\r\n     determined to abolish it; Maryland and Delaware have put declared\r\n     emancipationists in places of their highest trusts by unprecedented\r\n     majorities; and Kentucky is visibly casting about to see how she\r\n     can best rid herself of the curse.\r\n\r\n     '_We say, then, that even if the National Government had the right\r\n     to institute new civil measures against slavery, it would not be\r\n     necessary. The unavoidable military operations of the war, and the\r\n     free discussion which is sure to attend it, are enough of\r\n     themselves to break down the institution. The Government has simply\r\n     to stand quiet, and let these agencies work_.'\r\n\r\nThe italics are our own, inserted for the sake of more easy reference.\r\nNot only is it unnecessary, according to this writer, to take any active\r\nand positive steps against Slavery at the South, but so soon as the\r\nrebel States wish to return within the Union, with all their old\r\nprivileges and with Slavery surviving, they should be permitted to do\r\nso, and should be received with open arms. The Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation itself is thus quietly wiped out, and a policy sketched\r\nwhich, in the event of mere military defeat on their part, would, in the\r\nnext place, be the most acceptable of all possible policies;--not to the\r\nloyal black men who are now struggling, fighting, and dying alongside of\r\nus, in the ranks; not to the small and feeble but growing anti-slavery\r\nparty, which, in the presence of, and under the protection of our armies\r\nof the North, is just springing up and consolidating itself in the\r\nSouth;--but to Jefferson Davis himself, and to all the devoted and\r\nfanatical adherents of the slaveholding system in the South, and their\r\n'Copperhead' friends in the North. The _Times_ article concludes as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     'But we go farther, and say, that any other interference would not\r\n     only be superfluous, but positively mischievous. To insure that\r\n     slavery, when it dies, shall never rise again, you have got to\r\n     depend largely upon the disposition of the Southern people. That\r\n     disposition should not be needlessly embittered. It can't help\r\n     becoming so if, as some propose, their States are reduced to the\r\n     condition of mere territorial dependencies. Americans can never be\r\n     satisfied to be underlings. Whatever the fortunes of war\r\n     legitimately bring, they are sensible enough to submit to; but it\r\n     is not in their spirit to consent to any permanent degradation.\r\n     Undertake to deprive them permanently of their civil rights, and\r\n     you simply make them your permanent enemies. _Territorialize them\r\n     because you hate slavery, and the inevitable effect will be that\r\n     you will only make them love slavery the more, and hate you the\r\n     more. This could not always continue. State rights, sooner or\r\n     later, would have to be restored. We don't believe that three years\r\n     would elapse after the close of the war before the keeping those\r\n     States in a territorial condition would be abandoned as an\r\n     insufferable anomaly in our system of government. State rights once\r\n     restored, the people, maddened by the thrall that had been put upon\r\n     them, would be very likely to vindicate these rights by\r\n     rehabilitating slavery. Every incentive of high pride and every\r\n     impulse of low spite would combine to urge this; and the National\r\n     Government would have no legitimate way of preventing it_.\r\n\r\n     'It will never do to try to give slavery its lasting quietus by\r\n     mere arbitrary force. To secure this we have got to rely in no\r\n     small measure upon reason. We must never forget that just as Force\r\n     is the natural ally of Slavery, just so Reason is the natural ally\r\n     of Freedom. _When the South has been overcome in fair fight, we\r\n     must give its reason a fair chance to assert itself_. Military\r\n     authority over each reclaimed State should last until the majority\r\n     of the people have made up their mind to resume, in good faith,\r\n     their old relations to the Government, and have had a fair\r\n     opportunity to canvass how that resumption shall best be\r\n     inaugurated. Of course the machinery of the State Government cannot\r\n     be given over to traitors; _but whenever there is sound reason to\r\n     believe that a fair loyal majority of the State want it, let them\r\n     have it--and that, too, without imposing any conditions concerning\r\n     slavery. If this just and rational policy is faithfully carried\r\n     out, and no arbitrary issues are foisted in to impose a sense of\r\n     subordination, we have not a doubt that every Slave State will\r\n     follow the emancipating policy which the Border States, of their\r\n     own accord, have already entered upon with such decision. Even if\r\n     loyal duty don't prompt it, interest will. For slavery, after\r\n     having been crippled as it has been by the war, even if it could\r\n     live, would only be an encumbrance. But it can't live. It is\r\n     already half dead. Let the loyal men of the South finish it and\r\n     bury it in their own way_.'\r\n\r\nCompare, now, in the fair spirit of criticism, the beginning and the end\r\nof this unstatesman-like editorial. Slavery, we are emphatically told,\r\nis dying; first, because the presence of the war in its immediate\r\nvicinity is killing it; and, secondly, because free discussion, excited\r\nby the war and the presence of Northern influence incidental to the war,\r\nis killing it--_therefore let us hasten to withdraw the military power,\r\nand the causes of free discussion, where, for a century, it has been\r\nannihilated until now, and has only now begun to exist, and leave in\r\nfull activity all the causes of reaction and the reëstablishment of the\r\nold STATUS. 'There is not the slightest chance, whatever,' says the\r\nwriter, 'of slavery being saved_, IF PRESENT CAUSES CONTINUE.' Therefore\r\n_hasten to discontinue present causes, by all means, and surrender the\r\nfield to the operation of the old causes. 'The chain'_ of the slave\r\n'_must be broken when the civil law, which alone gives it strength,\r\npasses away_.' Therefore hasten to restore the civil law to its old and\r\ntyrannical potency over the destiny of the slave. '_The institution must\r\nmelt away as the war goes on_.' Therefore, hasten not merely to finish\r\nthe active stage of the war, but _to surrender the power which victory\r\nwill place in your hands to continue the same emancipating influences_;\r\nand to surrender it into the hands of men avowedly hostile to your\r\npolicy, and who have been conquered fighting for their franchise to\r\nenslave.\r\n\r\n'_Not only_,' continues our editor, '_have slave codes interdicted, in\r\nevery one of the Slave States, all adverse discussion of the\r\ninstitution, but a mob power has always been at hand to take summary\r\nvengeance upon it with Lynch law. These resorts were not a mere caprice;\r\nthey were a necessity_.' Hasten, therefore, to reëstablish these engines\r\nof terrorism and the institution which inevitably demands their\r\nexistence. Ignore and set aside the Proclamation of Emancipation; betray\r\nthe auxiliary black man; throttle and destroy the incipient party of\r\nfreedom in its birth; turn the Young South, just rising into existence\r\nas the friend of liberty and progress, over, stripped and unprotected,\r\ninto the hands of the Old South, with its thongs, its thumbscrews, and\r\nits Lynch law; throw aside, the moment it is acquired, the power to\r\ncivilize and regenerate the South--not because the war and the free\r\ndiscussion which accompany the war _have killed slavery_, but because\r\nthey _are killing it_, and will be sure to kill it unless they are\r\nspeedily withdrawn.\r\n\r\n'But the war,' we are told, 'has ended all that. _There can be no mobs\r\nwhere the bayonet governs; nor arbitrary local laws where general\r\nmilitary law is paramount. The discussion of slavery is as free now in\r\nNew Orleans as it is in New York.'_ _True: therefore_, hasten to restore\r\nthe reign of mobs, or you will hurt the feelings of the men who make the\r\nmobs. Withdraw speedily 'the general military law,' and its 'paramount'\r\ncontrol, expressly in order that the operation of 'the arbitrary local\r\nlaws' may be resumed. Urge up the measures which will put an end to the\r\nstate of affairs in which 'the discussion of slavery is as free in New\r\nOrleans as it is in New York.'\r\n\r\n_'And in the Border States, where the civil laws still prevail,\r\nhostility to the rebellion has excited such a dissatisfaction with\r\nslavery as its cause, that, by general consent, perfect freedom is\r\nallowed in arguing against the institution.'_ This is true while a\r\nUnited States force is in the vicinity to overawe traitors--while the\r\nfriends of freedom feel confident that they have the strength of a\r\nnation at their back to aid them in resisting the local tyranny; hasten,\r\ntherefore, to remove these supports, and leave them to struggle single\r\nhanded and hopelessly against an inveterate and hoary despotism, which\r\nknows no law higher than its own will; and which has always been\r\ncompetent to crush out every rising aspiration toward freedom; until the\r\naccidental advantages of the war encouraged that timid utterance of true\r\nAmerican sentiment in those quarters which is just now beginning feebly\r\nto make itself heard and felt. Hasten, therefore, to withdraw that\r\nsupport at the instant of time when the local friends of freedom have\r\njust been induced to declare themselves, and so to become the unshielded\r\nvictims of slaveholding vindictiveness the instant the provisional\r\nsecurity of the new party derived from abroad ceases to exist. What\r\nwould 'the dissatisfaction with slavery' from 'hostility to the\r\nrebellion' have amounted to in Maryland, as a power, against the haughty\r\nand overbearing authority of the slaveholding Despotism, at the\r\ncommencement of the war, without the intervention of General Butler; or\r\nthat of Missouri, without that of General Fremont? What would that same\r\ndissatisfaction with Slavery amount to at this very day even, in those\r\nStates, against the reflex wave of pro-slavery influence and power, if\r\nall influence from the armies and authority of the United States were\r\ncompletely withdrawn? Or, granting even that in those two Border States,\r\nthe most advanced of all, the most under ordinary influences from the\r\nFree States, there is already inaugurated an Anti-slavery Movement which\r\nwould retain energy enough to carry on the struggle without foreign\r\naid--which even is extremely doubtful; the case would stand wholly\r\notherwise in Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, or Arkansas, where no\r\nwell-constituted Party of Freedom has as yet achieved any successes, and\r\nwhere the slaveholding interest and desperation are ten times stronger\r\nthan they are in the Border States.\r\n\r\n'_'We say, then,_ says the _Times_ writer, '_that even if the National\r\nGovernment had the right to institute new civil measures against\r\nslavery, it would not be necessary. The unavoidable military operations\r\nof the war, and the free discussion which is sure to attend it, are\r\nenough of themselves to break down the institution. The Government has\r\nsimply to stand quiet and let those influences work._'\r\n\r\nAll this, urged for the purposes for which it is here urged, is simply\r\ncrying, Peace! peace! when there is no peace. If these influences, the\r\npresence of the war power and free discussion, be to continue, very\r\ngood. Then, indeed, is there a chance, amounting almost to a certainty,\r\nthat Slavery will have to succumb, and all of these considerations,\r\nurged as a reason why the war power should be retained for an adequate\r\nperiod over the Slave States, even after their nominal submission, and\r\nfree discussion encouraged and protected by that power--which we\r\nunderstand to be the policy recommended by General Butler--are\r\nconsequent, logical, and patriotic; but put forth as reasons why we\r\nshould hasten to surrender the influence over the destiny of man which\r\nhas been so providentially, and yet with such immense sacrifice, placed\r\nin our hands, they are practically hostile to the vital purposes of the\r\nwar, however honest and simple minded may be the individuals who\r\nrecommend them.\r\n\r\nAgain: _'Territorialize them because you hate slavery, and the\r\ninevitable result will be that you will only make them love slavery the\r\nmore,'_ etc.\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose to insist on the technical process of\r\n_territorializing_ the conquered rebel States. What we do insist on is\r\nthat the military authority, which the nation has so laboriously\r\nasserted and acquired over them, shall not be withdrawn until the\r\nnatural and necessary and appropriate consequences of the war shall have\r\nbeen attained; and that among these is the inauguration of Freedom\r\ninstead of the reinstitution of that hideous anomaly of the nations,\r\nAmerican Slavery. We insist that the rising, but as yet the feeble and\r\ntimid Freedom Party of the South, including the blacks and a growing\r\nnumber of the poor whites, so fast as they become rightly informed, with\r\na small number of enlightened, generous, and noble-minded men of the\r\nplanter class, who sympathize with freedom, and are truly loyal in\r\nsympathy and soul to American principles and the American Government, be\r\nregarded and treated as the new and loyal South; and not a trumped-up\r\nparty, which may arise any day, of as bitter traitors as ever lived, but\r\nwho, seeing the hopelessness of their cause, which is, at bottom,\r\nSlavery, and nothing else, under the present issue of war, shall give in\r\na hollow and pretended profession of loyalty, in order to secure, by\r\nother means, the same end. Does this truly loyal party at the South\r\nanywhere as yet wish the withdrawal of the protection of the General\r\nGovernment, and desire to be turned over to the tender mercies of their\r\nfalse and subtle enemy--which are unheard-of cruelties? Let the\r\nrepresentation of the thousand loyal men from Middle Tennessee, recently\r\nmade to the President of the United States, answer. On the contrary,\r\nthere is nothing which those men so greatly dread--nothing which so\r\nchecks their more rapid development as a party--as the fear that they\r\nmay be so abandoned before their work is sufficiently advanced to secure\r\nits completion.\r\n\r\nThe three years which the _Times_ writer concedes to the existence of an\r\nanomaly in our Government, may be amply enough to accomplish all that is\r\nrequired. So far from imbittering the feelings of the true friends of\r\nthe Union in the South, assurance of the continuance of such a\r\nprotection over them, even for that length of time, would infuse new\r\nconfidence and new activity into all their movements. It is clearly the\r\nright of the policeman to judge when the mob is effectually suppressed,\r\nand as much his duty not to allow himself to be surprised and\r\nover-mastered by a pretended and hollow submission for the sake of\r\nseizing an advantage, as it is to inflict effectual blows of his cudgel\r\nwhile the row is in its more flagrant stages of development. The United\r\nStates, having interfered by force to suppress a national riot, has a\r\nclear right, and a bounden duty, not to abandon the region of the\r\ndisturbance until the _animus_ of rebellion is subdued as effectually as\r\nits open manifestation; and knowing that that _animus_ is identical\r\nwith the spirit, purposes, and designs of the slaveholding class--a\r\nconspiracy, in fine, to overthrow the Government in that sole behalf--it\r\nis alike bound effectually to cripple or actually to exterminate that\r\nmalign influence.\r\n\r\nAgain says our writer under review: '_When the South has been overcome\r\nin fair fight, we must give its reason a chance to assert itself._' Very\r\ntrue, if the mode of doing so be not foolishly misunderstood. The error\r\nhere is in speaking of the South as one, whereas from this time forward\r\nand for some years to come, there will be an Old South, rebellious at\r\nheart, malignant, defiant, cruel, and revengeful to the last\r\ndegree--bold, accustomed to rule with unquestioned authority--and, when\r\nconquered, refusing to remain conquered, except as the grapple of the\r\nconqueror is still at its throat; and a New South, loyal, loving, and\r\ndevoted to its deliverers, but timid, shrinking, and tentative of its\r\npowers--liberty-loving, and truly American in sentiment, but unused to\r\nthe exercise of political supremacy, unorganized, and weak;--an old\r\nSouth, refusing every appeal to reason, and only thirsting for\r\nvengeance; and a new South, ready to reason and to be reasoned with, and\r\nlooking gratefully to the National Government as its guide and protector\r\nin the unequal contest before it--more fearful to it than ever--at the\r\nclose of the war. How, then, shall we 'give the reason of the South a\r\nchance to assert itself'? By withdrawing our support from our friends,\r\nand the friends of America, and of man, in the South, and turning them\r\nover, like sheep to the wolves, to their unreasoning and vindictive\r\nenemies; or by standing by them in the weakness of their first essay to\r\ndepend on reason and justice in the place of force or fraud; by\r\ndeveloping, in fine, the reason of the South, which has been for a\r\ncentury overridden and suppressed by the incubus of an organized\r\ndespotism, from which there is now, for the first time, the chance of a\r\nredemption, if these _friends_ of Southern reason do not commit a\r\nblunder in their understanding of the case?\r\n\r\n'_Whenever_,' says the _Times_ writer, '_there is sound reason to\r\nbelieve that a sound loyal majority of the State want it\r\n(reconstruction), let them have it--and that, too, without imposing any\r\nconditions concerning slavery_.' That is to say, abandon the\r\nProclamation of Emancipation, betray the colored man, who, trusting to\r\nour faith, is now enrolling himself in our armies; betray the timid\r\nfriends of freedom, who, by our encouragement, have dared to proclaim\r\ntheir love of liberty, and subject themselves to inevitable banishment\r\nor extermination, unless the programme of a new free South be executed\r\ntriumphantly and to the letter; furnish to the most malignant\r\nslaveholding faction an equal chance at the very least, on a hollow\r\npretence of loyalty, to recover the ascendant and annihilate the new\r\nparty of emancipation and a regenerated South; and all this to save the\r\nSouthern malignants from being subjected to an unpleasant sense of\r\n'subordination;' to prevent imbittering their sentiments; as if it were\r\npossible to add bitterness to gall, or venom to the virus of the\r\nrattlesnake. The most imbittering and offensive thing that _can ever be\r\ndone_ to those men _is done_ the moment you pronounce the words of\r\nfreedom and human rights, in conjunction with each other, as if they\r\nwere the same thing. That done, every other measure grows mild. To\r\nterritorialize the whole South, and place a satrap over every parish and\r\ncounty of it--saying no word for freedom--would be a gentle and\r\nconciliating procedure compared with the most innocent utterance of a\r\nmere sentiment in behalf of emancipation and the elevation of the negro\r\nto the status of a man. Why, then, strain at a gnat when we have already\r\nswallowed a camel? If we mean anything by Emancipation Proclamations,\r\nthe organization of negro troops, or even by our own inherent love of\r\nliberty, nothing after that need ever be handled gingerly with the\r\nSouth. Every recommendation to abstain from giving her offence is simply\r\na recommendation to recede, not only from our whole war policy now so\r\nhappily inaugurated, but to recede from every genuine and efficient\r\nsentiment the Northern people may entertain, or ever have entertained,\r\nin behalf of the distinctively American idea: the freedom and equality\r\nbefore the law of all men.\r\n\r\n_'If this just and rational policy is faithfully carried out,'_\r\ncontinues our editor, _'and no arbitrary issues are foisted in to impose\r\na sense of subordination, we have not a doubt that every Slave State\r\nwill follow the emancipating policy which the Border States, of their\r\nown accord, have already entered upon with such decision. Even if loyal\r\nduty don't prompt it, interest will; for slavery, after having been\r\ncrippled, as it has been by the war, even if it could live, would only\r\nbe an encumbrance. But it can't live. It is already half dead. Let the\r\nloyal men of the South finish it and bury it in their own way'._\r\n\r\nNow it is precisely this simple-minded and easy credence that everything\r\nwill go right if it be at once handed over to the management of the men\r\nwho may have been whipped in the battle field--this overweening\r\nconfidence on the part of good men, and intelligent men, too, in the\r\nordinary sense of intelligence, at the North, which is the most\r\ndangerous feature of the whole matter. We are just entering upon the\r\nreal crisis of the war, when the war, by many, will be thought finished.\r\nIt is exceedingly doubtful whether in any single Border State the\r\nAnti-slavery Movement has received as yet any such impetus or gained any\r\nsuch secure foothold that it could maintain the struggle for a six\r\nmonths, if the influence growing out of the presence of the war in their\r\nmidst were withdrawn, and the political power were remanded in full to\r\nthe local authorities; and, in respect to the States farther South, and\r\nwholly committed to the institution, it is certain that Slavery has\r\nhardly received what would prove a serious scratch upon its epidermis,\r\nif such changes were now to take place.\r\n\r\nIndeed, on the contrary, there was never a time when temptation to\r\nslaveholding was a third part what it is to-day, aside from the threat\r\nof danger hanging over it from the continuance of the war, and the\r\nsupposed determination of the Northern conquerors to put an end to it.\r\nThe vital principle of Slavery which overrides every other\r\nconsideration, is the extra-profitable nature and state of slave-labor\r\nproducts. The writer has himself seen Slavery firmly seated in the\r\nsaddle and unassailable in an exposed region of the South, with cotton\r\nat from eight to twelve cents on the pound, and the same institution\r\ntrembling toward its downfall when cotton fell to four and a half and\r\nfive cents on the plantation. What must then be its hold on the cupidity\r\nof Southern men when the condition of Slavery, by virtue of the same\r\nstate of war which threatens its existence on the one hand, has caused\r\nthe price of cotton to rule, on the other hand, from twenty-five to\r\nseventy-five cents a pound, and has affected, in a somewhat similar way,\r\nevery other product of the sort! An immense premium is thus offered for\r\nthe continuance of the institution, and the danger is not slight that\r\nour own Northern men, thrown into the South, would be seduced, in great\r\nnumbers, by the temptation, into becoming themselves slavery\r\npropagandists, unless the exigencies of the war, the _esprit du corps_,\r\nand the solidarity of interests springing up between them and the negro\r\nsoldiers, and the prompt and energetic activity of the Government in\r\nbehalf of an emancipation policy were all to combine to prevent it. In\r\ntalking of Slavery, its power, its weakness, or its prospects, men,\r\nunless they have been intimately mixed up with its workings, are apt to\r\nbe reckoning without their host. Our own sentiment of justice in the\r\nmatter, North, poor and feeble as it is in most of us, is immensely\r\naided by the negative fact that our interests do not happen to be\r\nimmediately involved adversely. Not one in ten thousand of Northern men\r\nor Europeans, thrown into the South previous to the war, ever withstood\r\nthe infection of pro-slavery sentiment and action. Our soldiers do so\r\nnow, only because they are in large bodies, because they are fighting\r\nthe Southern men, and because they are becoming more and more identified\r\nwith a distinct national policy in behalf of emancipation and the rights\r\nof man. Withdraw these causes, and the effects would be rapidly\r\nreversed. Northern officers and men could not be trusted to fraternize\r\nwith the slave-holding aristocracy, previous to the time when the\r\nbackbone of the institution of Slavery should have been effectually\r\nbroken; not because they are bad men, but because they are men, and\r\nwould act, under similar circumstances, as men--alike Northern,\r\nSouthern, and European men--have acted in the years that are past. There\r\nis a far more reliable and trustworthy party of Southern anti-slavery\r\nmen than are as yet their Northern allies; men who have suffered\r\nintensely from actual contact and struggle with the institution, and who\r\nhave felt, in some measure, the steel of Slavery enter their own souls;\r\nbut they are not numerous enough to stand without the aid of these same\r\nuntrustworthy Northern auxiliaries, who already, at the first indication\r\nof incipient success for our arms, propose, like this writer, to remand\r\nthem to the tender mercies of a Southern majority rule. It is the fear\r\nof this treachery which makes them so few as they are, and so weak. It\r\nis these men whom we wish to see sustained, recognized as the loyal and\r\nthe new South, and aided in the work of reconstruction, when the\r\nsomewhat distant period for it to be safe and wise shall have arrived.\r\nThey are the men who will teach us wisdom, if we will follow their\r\nadvice; and they, be assured of it, will not clamor for any early and\r\nthoughtless surrender of our present advantages, for fear of hurting the\r\nsensibilities of the South by imposing a sense of 'subordination.' With\r\nthe agony of despair, such men would remonstrate against any such\r\nsuicidal policy, and entreat the Government of the United States and the\r\npeople of the North to stand by them in their great distress, through,\r\nuntil the end. While writing, the following newspaper paragraph attracts\r\nour attention, and is a fair expression of the truth we are seeking to\r\ninculcate:\r\n\r\n     'The Hon. Silas Casey, of Kentucky, brings news of the most intense\r\n     feeling, on the subject of holding slaves in the Border States,\r\n     among Union men. They contend that the restriction in the\r\n     President's Proclamation has made Kentucky and Tennessee a\r\n     'national slave pen,' where slaves, fleeing from the 'confederate'\r\n     States, are bought and sold by the thousand. He says the Unionists\r\n     to a man are in favor of immediate and sweeping emancipation of all\r\n     slaves within their borders--that there can be no protection for a\r\n     Unionist as long as aristocratic secessionists are allowed to hold\r\n     all their old slaves, and are protected in buying human beings,\r\n     once freed by the President's Proclamation. The last and most\r\n     important step to be taken by the Government, to insure Unionism in\r\n     the Border States, is to emancipate the slaves of disloyalists in\r\n     Kentucky and Tennessee. The military once removed from Kentucky,\r\n     and again would commence the barbarism of slavery. Defenders of the\r\n     Government would be murdered--freedom of speech be denied; the\r\n     expulsion of Northern ministers, and the tar-and-feathering of\r\n     Northern schoolmasters, for only preferring Union to secession,\r\n     freedom to slavery, would go on as freely as in the palmiest days\r\n     of the chivalry; Parson Brownlow would be driven from Knoxville,\r\n     his press and dwelling burned, Casey and Green and Adams exiled\r\n     forever, and the same old war would have to be fought over again,\r\n     with all its blood and horror, on Kentucky soil.'\r\n\r\nThe following comments are equally true:\r\n\r\n     'Again we call the attention of thoughtful men to the current\r\n     phases of 'Border State' politics, and ask that they be deeply\r\n     considered. If we open a hundred 'conservative' journals in\r\n     succession, we shall find at least ninety of them asserting or\r\n     assuming that the revolted States are to be reconciled to the Union\r\n     by new concessions, new guarantees to slavery. But those States\r\n     themselves emphatically repel this assumption. Every man in\r\n     Delaware, in Maryland, in Tennessee, in Missouri, who is heartily\r\n     and thoroughly anti-rebel is also anti-slavery, and nearly every\r\n     one is for immediate, not gradual, emancipation. They were not\r\n     Republicans; not one in twenty of them voted for Lincoln; they make\r\n     no special pretensions to philanthropy; but they mean to live and\r\n     die in the Union, and they do not choose to have their throats cut\r\n     by rebels; so they desire that slavery should die, knowing by\r\n     practical experience, by personal observation, that slavery and the\r\n     rebellion are but two phases of the same thing--two names for one\r\n     reality.'\r\n\r\nSlavery, as things are, is neither 'crippled' nor 'half dead.' It is\r\nonly a little sick, and threatened with being made more so, if the same\r\neffectual blows which have been dealt it are followed up hereafter with\r\nother blows still more effectual.\r\n\r\nWe have reason to believe that the writer of the _Times_ article we have\r\nbeen reviewing, has passed some time with the Army of the Cumberland;\r\nthat he has viewed the subject impartially from what he deems a large\r\nfield of observation; and that he speaks honestly what he believes. But\r\nno observation even of that kind is sufficient to open the whole case.\r\nLet him be a Southern man, or a Northern man residing at the South, and\r\ncommitted to the emancipation policy; let him stay behind and see the\r\nbanners of our army gradually retiring to the North, and the banished\r\nleaders of the rebellion and other slaveholding tyrants and harpies\r\ngathering in the wake and gradually surrounding him and his little band\r\nof patriots--reclaiming all their old authority and overawing and\r\ntrampling down every incipient blade of the crop of freedom, which had\r\nbeen planted in the presence and under the shadow of our armies--and he\r\nwill be better prepared to judge. From even the high authority of\r\nGeneral Grant himself, on this subject, we dissent. Let him first\r\ngrapple with a Southern slaveholding public sentiment, as a peaceable\r\ncitizen holding adverse opinions, and without a victorious army at his\r\nback, and he will be better qualified to form and give a reliable\r\nopinion. He is represented as having said, in a private letter to the\r\nHon. E. F. Washburn, of the date of August 13th, 1863, that the people\r\nof the North need not quarrel over the institution of Slavery; that what\r\nVice-President Stevens acknowledges as the corner stone of the\r\nconfederacy is already knocked out; that Slavery is already dead, and\r\ncannot be resurrected; that it would take a standing army to maintain\r\nSlavery in the South, if we were to make peace to-day guaranteeing to\r\nthe South all their former constitutional privileges, etc. With profound\r\nrespect for General Grant as a man and a soldier, we would still prefer\r\nthe opinion, on this point, of any earnest member of the young and\r\nfeeble anti-slavery party of the South, who resides a few miles away\r\nfrom the actual reach of the authority and influence of a Federal army.\r\n\r\nIt is refreshing to know that to this opinion of the victorious general,\r\nof exceedingly doubtful value, upon the specific point in question, he\r\nadds these memorable and patriotic words:\r\n\r\n     'I never was an Abolitionist, not even what would be called\r\n     anti-slavery, but I try to judge fairly and honestly, and it became\r\n     patent to my mind early in the rebellion that the North and South\r\n     could never live at peace with each other except as one nation, and\r\n     that without slavery. As anxious as I am to see peace established,\r\n     I would not, therefore, be willing to see any settlement until this\r\n     question is forever settled.'\r\n\r\nAlmost the only men in the nation who are really competent to judge when\r\nSlavery is really dead, in any region, are those Northern and Western\r\nanti-slavery men who have come into long and deadly collision with its\r\nspirit and power in Kansas and upon the western border of Missouri. Even\r\nNorthern and Eastern Abolitionists, better versed perhaps in the theory\r\nof the subject, would prove very incompetent if matched in practical\r\nhostility with slaveholding opinion and might--slaveholding\r\nvindictiveness, cunning, treachery, and recklessness of every\r\nconsideration, human or divine, but the gaining of their one end, the\r\nretention of their hold over the slave.\r\n\r\nIt is again refreshing, in the midst of the open or covert defence and\r\nprotection among us of the surviving remnant of Slavery at the South,\r\ngranting for the moment that it is now reduced to that, and in the midst\r\nof such easy and over-credulous and mistaken assumptions of its\r\ncomplete, virtual destruction already, by undoubted friends of freedom,\r\nas in the case of the _Times_ editor, General Grant, and numerous\r\nothers, to listen to such hearty utterances, in the keynote of the right\r\npolicy, as were made by Secretary Chase in his recent speech at\r\nCincinnati, and to be able to believe that they foreshadow the course of\r\nthe Administration in this trying epoch of our country's history. We\r\nquote the following report:\r\n\r\n     'It was never intended to interfere with States that were loyal.\r\n     This Proclamation comes up as a great feature in this war. In my\r\n     judgment the Proclamation was the right thing in the right place,\r\n     and without it I am just as sure as I am of my own existence that\r\n     we could not have made the progress we have made. And I hold that\r\n     the man who denounces the Proclamation either speaks ignorantly,\r\n     speaks about that of which he knows little or nothing, or else he\r\n     really desires that the rebellion should succeed.\r\n\r\n     'There are two classes of States in the South; there is the class\r\n     of States that is affected by the Proclamation, and a class of\r\n     States that is not. With this last class of States, which is not\r\n     affected by the Proclamation, we have simply nothing to do, except\r\n     to bid God speed to the unconditional Union men of those States,\r\n     that they will do their own work in their own way and in their own\r\n     time, and all we have to do is to stand by them.\r\n\r\n     'But in the States which are affected by the Proclamation the case\r\n     is different. Either the Proclamation was a great, monstrous sham,\r\n     and an imposition in the face of the world, or else that\r\n     Proclamation was an effectual thing, and there are no slaves to-day\r\n     in the rebel States. They are all enfranchised by the Proclamation,\r\n     for what says it? All the slaves of these States are declared now\r\n     and forever free, and the executive power is pledged to the\r\n     maintenance of their freedom. If it were not so it would be a\r\n     national imposture, and I would no more be guilty of that piece of\r\n     infamy than I would steal into your house at night and rob your\r\n     pantry. But what have we to do with this Proclamation in the\r\n     rebellious Slave States? It is a very simple thing: _just simply\r\n     recognise the Union men who remain in those States_. Such men as\r\n     Mr. Flanders, and Mr. May, and a whole host of others, who were\r\n     known as slaveowners, are now satisfied that the Union men of the\r\n     South must see to it that slavery must never be permitted to be\r\n     reëstablished in those States. Take such a man as the Hon. Charles\r\n     Anderson. When he went home and stood up for the Union, what did\r\n     the slave aristocracy do for him? They drove him from the State,\r\n     and his wife and little ones were obliged to take shelter in the\r\n     bush. And so with multitudes of Union men in Texas at the present\r\n     day. But all of them wish to get back and establish a Free State in\r\n     Texas; because, they say, no other than a Free State can ever\r\n     protect them from the enemies of human freedom, and, I was going to\r\n     say, of human nature. Again, in Florida there were many who were\r\n     driven away who are now anxious to return. Is there a man here who\r\n     wants these noble, generous Union men of the South _to go back to\r\n     be trampled under foot by restored rebels_! Let them go back, but\r\n     let them go back under the ægis of the American Union, and the\r\n     protection of the Government pledged to them, and then they will\r\n     take care to settle this question of slavery. They will amend the\r\n     Constitution so as to put the slavery question where it ought to\r\n     be. When that is done, who is going to talk about the Proclamation?\r\n     You have here, my fellow citizens, an intelligent statement, as it\r\n     seems to me, of the manner in which this thing can be settled:\r\n     simply by standing by the unconditional Union men--who almost all\r\n     of them have embraced the doctrine of emancipation in the Border\r\n     States--and standing by the Union men in the rebellious States, and\r\n     letting them protect themselves against the institution of\r\n     slavery.'\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the present writing, and having just transferred these\r\nmanly, patriotic, and statesmanlike sentiments to our columns, hoping\r\nthat they might foreshadow the fixed policy of the Administration, of\r\nwhich Mr. Chase is so able and distinguished a member, we are overtaken\r\nby more than a full fruition of the hope in the publication of the\r\nPresident's Message and Proclamation of Amnesty to the South, upon the\r\nsole condition of the perpetual maintenance of the Proclamation of\r\nEmancipation issued a year ago; in other words, upon the condition of\r\nthe total and definitive extinction of Slavery in the South. The men of\r\nthe South who are ready for this are to be recognized as the loyal\r\ncitizens, the New South--precisely what ought to be done. The machinery\r\nof the old State Governments is to remain intact, but to be turned over\r\nto this regenerated Southern party for administration. The whole\r\nmilitary and civil force of the Union is to retain its guardianship over\r\nthe South, during the transition, and to remain pledged to the\r\nmaintenance of the status of freedom united with loyalty, until, by the\r\ngrowth and stability of the new order of things, the conquered territory\r\nshall dispense with its continued intervention. The plan devised by the\r\nPresident is admirable, and symptoms already exist that, like so many\r\nother of his leading measures, it is destined to meet with unbounded\r\nacceptance and popularity, from even the most diverse and disharmonious\r\nquarters. Trusting, therefore, that the practical administration of the\r\nwar is drifting into the right policy, based on the true theory of its\r\ncauses and legitimate termination, we may leave these merely political\r\nand military questions, and revert, in conclusion, to the possible\r\nremaining eventualities of the war. These may be, for the time, (1.)\r\nSeemingly prosperous and fortunate, or, (2.) Seemingly accompanied with\r\ndisaster, discouragement, and dismay--ulterior even to the eventual\r\ntriumph of our arms over the open enemies of the existing order of\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nFirstly, then, it may happen, that from this time out we shall be more\r\nand more decisively triumphant over the 'rump' of the rebellion still\r\nextant in the South; that the new policy of emancipation now so\r\nfavorably inaugurated may work like a magical charm, and that among the\r\nhappy and startling surprises to which we are daily becoming addicted,\r\nmay be that of an unexpected readiness in the exhausted and repentant\r\nSouth to acquiesce in the new order of things; that our new financial\r\nscheme may develop germs of commercial prosperity more than adequate to\r\ncompensate for all the strain upon our national energy and resources\r\nimposed by the war; that an immense and unparalleled expansion of\r\nnational prosperity, hardly marred by the ripple of our financial\r\nencumbrances, may be in waiting for the future United States of America,\r\nand lie spread out in the immediate future before us; that untold wealth\r\nmay be unearthed from our mines, marvellous discoveries and inventions\r\nmade to increase our manufactures and means of locomotion, and new\r\nsources of learning and art and practical action be opened.\r\n\r\nSuppose even less brilliant and rapid results. Suppose that the war\r\nlingers; that numerous and desperate battles have yet to be fought, and\r\nsome reverses to be endured; but that we continue to hold the heart of\r\nthe South up to our present lines in Georgia and East Tennessee; that\r\nthe new system of things is gradually established and becomes solidified\r\nwithin the States already possessed: even this state of things, if\r\nprovidentially enforced on us after our best exertions have been put\r\nforth to succeed, may, again, unexpectedly prove to have concealed under\r\nseeming failure a more fortunate termination of our herculean work.\r\nPerhaps there is even yet not enough national virtue among us to leaven\r\nthe whole lump, and thus, by being delayed of our too greedy aspirations\r\nfor success, we may only the more surely succeed. A halt at this period\r\nof the war was foreshadowed, it will be remembered by the reader, in the\r\nearlier portion of this series of papers, written more than two years\r\nago. At any rate, if the remaining resistance of the rebel government\r\nshould prove more obstinate and prolonged than is now generally\r\nanticipated, let there be no discouragement, and no serious\r\ndisappointment. Remember again, in that event, that our supreme triumphs\r\nare moral and social, for which our military successes are merely a\r\nbasis; and that moral and social changes demand time to be consolidated\r\nand secured. Immense changes are being rapidly effected in the public\r\nsentiment and the prospective action of the reconquered portions of the\r\nSouth; but such changes are not made in a day; and some retardation of\r\nthe national aspiration for a speedy termination of the war may prove\r\nour providential security against evils which, our own precipitancy\r\nmight possibly otherwise incur. The retention of our present hold, the\r\ngradual but slow progress to a complete final conquest, and the steady\r\nassimilation of the reintegrated portions of the South with our Northern\r\nand the truly American character and sentiment, would still, therefore,\r\ndeserve to be reckoned upon the side of seeming or obvious success.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, let us consider, for a moment, the other\r\nalternative--that of apparent disaster, incurred from the war, not so\r\nmuch in the light of overwhelming military defeats, which need hardly\r\nnow to be seriously apprehended, as from financial exhaustion and other\r\nsecondary causes introduced into the working of our national and social\r\nlife through the operation and influence of the war. Mr. Cobden,\r\nundoubtedly a friend of our nation, and a shrewd observer of the world's\r\naffairs on the basis of experience, or a knowledge of the past, warns us\r\nto look forward to a period of almost utter prostration after the war\r\nshall have terminated, and to a train of serious consequences from the\r\nterrific strain put by it upon our energies and resources. Forebodings\r\nof a similar kind haunt the imaginations of many of our own citizens.\r\nThe history of past wars and their results justify the anticipation.\r\nPerchance all this may prove an unnecessary fear. It may happen that the\r\nalmost boundless recuperative energies of this young American\r\ncivilization of ours may be destined to astonish our enemies, our\r\nfriends, and ourselves, as much as the extent of our resources for\r\naction have already done--that the strain put upon us, instead of\r\nenfeebling us in the least, has been merely a healthy exercise for the\r\ngrowing muscles and thews of a young giant just now ripening into a\r\nfirst manhood, and never heretofore called upon for any adequate\r\nexertion to display his strength. We once heard an enthusiastic and\r\nprogressive orator, referring to the marvels of modern development,\r\nutter, with a sublime and audacious eloquence, the startling assertion\r\nthat '_Experience is a fool._' There is a sense, no doubt, in which the\r\nsentiment is true. Neither the growth, nor the inherent power, nor the\r\nelasticity of the rebound from seeming exhaustion, nor the immense\r\nacceleration of the rapidity of the future career of the American\r\npeople, is to be safely measured by a reference to what has occurred\r\nwith former nationalities, in other and different times. Our experience\r\nof the future, whatever it may be, will be, no doubt, essentially\r\ndifferent from any of the past.\r\n\r\nBut assume, on the contrary, that the prediction is essentially well\r\nfounded; that we have before us, in the immediate future, a period of\r\nextreme exhaustion, depression, and even of temporary discouragement in\r\nthe public mind. All this need not, to the philosophic mind, cause the\r\nslightest apprehension of permanent evil results--of any serious check\r\neven, to our inevitable destiny, as the heirs of unbounded prosperity\r\nand the leaders of the vanguard of the progress of the world. A halt, in\r\nthis sense, in the rapidity of our career, would be only the necessary\r\nprice of our immense and invaluable achievement, the elimination of\r\nchattel slavery from the constitution of our social and political life.\r\nWe have still other and great social evils remaining behind. The\r\nscientific and harmonious adjustment of the relations of capital to\r\nlabor, of the employers to the employed, in the constitution of our free\r\ncompetitive society as it will still remain after Slavery is dead, is\r\nthe next great practical question which will force itself upon our\r\nattention, and insist upon being definitively settled, before we can\r\nenter upon that ulterior triumphant national development which is\r\nreserved, in the decrees of destiny, for us as a people. This problem,\r\nseemingly so difficult, will be found unexpectedly easy of solution, so\r\nsoon as the thinking and practical mind of the people is seriously\r\ncalled to its consideration. It is worthy of observation, that periods\r\nof great pecuniary depression are favorable to the progress of ideas. It\r\nis written in the Providence of God that the American people must,\r\nwithin the few years to come, solve the whole problem of justice to the\r\nlaboring man; must, indeed, accept its office as the Champion and the\r\nIllustrator, in a practical way, of Universal Justice, in all the\r\nrelations of life. Are we prepared to enter on this career,\r\nintelligently, lovingly, and with voluntary alacrity, from affection to\r\nthe True and the Good; or must we be again scourged into the\r\nconsideration of great questions lying immediately in our way, by the\r\nprovidential inflictions of disaster and distress?\r\n\r\nWe can now see easily enough, that had we been ready and desirous, as a\r\npeople, to do justice to the black man, we should have escaped the\r\nhorrors of a great war. We may predict, with the assurance of a\r\nreligious faith, backed, we might almost affirm, by the certainty of a\r\nscientific demonstration, that if we are already sufficiently prepared\r\nto be simply just, we shall be saved from the serious infliction of more\r\nnational suffering; and that if, on the contrary, this preparation of\r\nthe heart and the head has not been wrought in us by what we have\r\nalready endured, we shall be called directly and continuously to the\r\nsuffering of more and perhaps greater inflictions. 'Whom the Lord loveth\r\nhe chasteneth,' but not blindly nor uselessly, and not, therefore, after\r\nthe right frame of mind has been wrought in the subject of the\r\npunishment. The law is precisely the same, whether we speak\r\ntheologically or from the profoundest philosophical principles; and it\r\nmay almost be said that the American people have only to choose whether\r\nthey will immediately enter, with the close of the war, upon a higher\r\ncareer of prosperity, or whether they will endure an additional term of\r\ntuition in the school of adversity. These words may seem mystical,\r\nunaccompanied with further illustration and elaboration of the ideas,\r\nbut it is not the place here to pursue them.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed with the supposition that we have before us, at the\r\nconclusion of this war, a period of great national suffering. Such\r\nperiods, we have already said, are favorable to the development of\r\nthought. We may add, they are alike favorable to the growth of earnest\r\npurpose. Through suffering we are perfected. Thought and high purpose\r\nare secure bases of noble achievement. If we are not yet prepared to be\r\ninducted into our national mission, through providential favor, then let\r\nus come to it through the inverse method: _through Ulterior and\r\nReactionary Consequence_.\r\n\r\nIt may be that we are to endure still more grievous afflictions than\r\npecuniary and commercial revulsion and depression. Our political\r\nconstitution still bears in its bosom, even after Slavery is removed,\r\ndangerous seeds of anarchy and prospective revolution. Within the two\r\nyears past, grave mutterings, to which American ears have been\r\nheretofore altogether unused, have been heard in various quarters,\r\ntouching the superior advantages of 'strong government,' the speakers,\r\nmostly of the higher or wealthier order of life, meaning thereby, the\r\nold and retrograde forms of monarchy, or something of that sort. Periods\r\nof disaster tend to reveal a latent lack of confidence in the permanency\r\nof existing things. Investigations in Sociology impeach the wisdom of\r\nour institutions, in common with that of all others that have been tried\r\nin the past, from another point of view. Periods of distress and\r\nprivation stimulate the turbulence of the 'dangerous classes.' All\r\nnational experience reveals, in fine, the existence, in the very nature\r\nof human society, of great antagonistic principles struggling with each\r\nother in mighty conflict, and with which no political or governmental\r\narrangements heretofore extant have been adequate rightly to cope.\r\n\r\nThe great and bloody contest with Slavery, now going on, is an instance\r\nof such a conflict; and the fact that we, in the midst of this\r\nnineteenth century, had arrived at the knowledge of no better solution\r\nof it than an appeal to the old, barbarous, uncertain, and terrible\r\nordeal of battle, is an illustration of the incompetency in question.\r\nSlavery, bad as it is, is the representative of a great social\r\nprinciple, which, separated from the special mode of its manifestation,\r\nhas in it that which is good and right. Mr. Cobden justly characterizes\r\nthe great American war as an insurrection of aristocracy against the\r\nprinciple of democracy. But aristocracy is not wholly wrong, nor is\r\ndemocracy wholly right, in the nature and constitution of things. These\r\nare two great antagonistic principles, when sifted to the bottom; one\r\nthe principle of Order, through Subordination, the soul of Conservatism;\r\nand the other the principle of Freedom, through Individuality, the soul\r\nof Progression. Neither will ever expunge or expel the other from the\r\nconstitution of man, individually or collectively; and it pertains to\r\nScience, the Science of Politics, based on the Unity of the Sciences\r\nbelow that level, to be arrived at by humanity in the future, to\r\ndiscover and lead in the complete harmony and reconciliation between the\r\ntwo. The writer of these papers has in manuscript a labored document\r\nupon the Slavery question from this more radical and philosophical point\r\nof view, which was prepared just previous to the outbreak of the\r\nexisting war, in the hope of attracting the leading minds, North and\r\nSouth, to the peaceable and scientific solution of the whole Slavery\r\nquestion. But the antagonism was too far advanced, passions too much\r\naroused, the popular ignorance of the existence of higher methods of\r\nsolution too dense, and the crisis too imminent for the existence of any\r\ndemand for such considerations then; and the publication of the document\r\nwas withheld. In it were shown the significance of Slavery as a Fact in\r\nHistory and a Principle in Nature; its Compensations and Advantages; its\r\npositive value, in fact, in the larger sense, in the development of\r\nhuman society on the planet; then its destiny to give way in our\r\nadvancing civilization to the higher doctrine of abstract rights and\r\nindividual culture through intellectual means; and again, the\r\ninsufficiency of the latter doctrine, when taken for the whole truth;\r\nand finally, to show how, by the intervention of the science of the\r\nsubject, the value of both the Principles in conflict could be extracted\r\nand made coöperative, and their evils completely neutralized. The world\r\nnot being ripe for the adoption of the superior and rational methods\r\nhere intimated for the adjustment of our difficulties--the readiness of\r\none party even, without the equal readiness of the other, being\r\ninadequate--the crisis and the conflict could not be averted; and that\r\nagain being the case, it is of the utmost importance that the second in\r\norder of the two adverse principles, the principle of democracy, be\r\ncompletely triumphant; not because it is more true, but because it is a\r\nmore _advanced_ truth, and one step nearer, therefore, to the final\r\nsolution,_ which will then lap back, and subsume and assimilate and\r\nreconcile the whole family of fundamental principles upon which the\r\nexistence of human society is inexpugnably based_. It is upon this lower\r\nground of adaptation to the exigency of the age and the occasion, and as\r\na means to the development of still higher truths, that we urge the\r\ninestimable importance of the effectual conquest over the South by the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nBut the two Principles, thus brought face to face with each other, in\r\ndeadly array, under the present guise of chattel slavery and republican\r\nfreedom, are not extinguished in the world, nor in America even, nor are\r\nthey to be permanently reconciled with each other by any outcoming\r\nwhatsoever of the present war. These principles are the Aristocratic and\r\nthe Democratic; the principle of conservative order and progressive\r\nfreedom. Both are vital and essential forces, ever living, ever active;\r\nalways antagonistic; never reconciled in the past; never to be\r\nreconciled in the future, till it be done finally, effectually,\r\nand forever, through the SCIENCE of the subject. By the\r\ncontingencies of this war still future, by the lingering and disastrous\r\n_sequelæ_ of the war, or by other and possible eventualities not yet\r\nsufficiently developed to be distinctly cognizable, the inherent and\r\nunconquerable antagonism (until reconciled through science) of the great\r\nopposing forces in human society is liable to be burst upon us with a\r\nconflagration in comparison with which even the devastations of the\r\npresent war will seem trifling. The writer of these papers anticipated\r\nand predicted for a long time, and has not yet fully ceased to\r\nanticipate, that the present conflict may gradually shape itself into a\r\ndesperate and universal struggle, North and South, between these two\r\nprinciples, in their bald, undisguised, and unmitigated hostility; that,\r\nin other words, as a party of freedom should be developed at the South,\r\nthere would be developed _pari passu_ at the North a great reactionary\r\nparty; assimilating the elements of a _bogus_ democracy and all those\r\nwho by organization or position are inherently and overweeningly\r\naristocratic; a party bold, powerful, and desperate enough to bring home\r\nthe civil war to our own doors; in other words, that the war would\r\nbecome a war wholly of Ideas; and those defined down to their sharpest\r\nand most ultimate differences of logical significance. In that case, the\r\nevents of the French Revolution would have been, or will be, repeated in\r\nAmerica, on a more gigantic scale. Warning symptoms have already\r\nappeared among us of the possibilities of all this. If it be in the good\r\nprovidence of God that we are to escape this terrible ordeal--if it be\r\npermitted that this cup of national evils pass from us--it can only be\r\nthat we are a step farther on in the completion of our education, as a\r\nnation, than was obviously revealed to the investigation of the\r\nobserver; that, as a people, we are nearer to a genial and willing\r\nacceptance of truth and obedience to the dictates of justice than\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nStill the conflict of principles endures in the world at large--the\r\nAristocratic Principle, represented by autocracy, absolutism, prelacy,\r\nand slaveholding authority, on the one hand, and the Democratic\r\nPrinciple, represented by republicanism, Protestantism, dead-levelism,\r\nwith free and destructive competition, on the other. As Slavery and\r\nFreedom have been preparing for their local conflict in America during\r\nthe thirty years past; so, for the whole century gone by, the\r\nthreatening cloud of the final conflict between the two great governing\r\nideas in the world has been gathering. Occasional sharp and some\r\nterrific encounters have been had. Is this conflict of opinion to become\r\nmore and more consolidated and defined, and finally embodied in two\r\ngreat hostile camps, covering the whole earth with an actual war,\r\nreplete with desolation and carnage--not a war of distinct\r\nnationalities, but of the partisans of the two great antagonistic drifts\r\nof human development? Is there to be literally the great battle of\r\nArmageddon in the world before the incoming of a better age? or has the\r\nignorant wrath of man sufficiently prevailed, and are we in truth\r\nprepared to investigate with sobriety, accept with simple honesty, and\r\nfaithfully to practise the lessons of wisdom which the experience of the\r\npast or the new discoveries of the present or the future may bring? The\r\nreligious world is becoming deeply penetrated with the conviction that\r\nwe are, in the world at large, upon the verge of great events--that we\r\nare nearing the termination of an Old Dispensation and the commencement\r\nof a New; without, perhaps, defining very clearly, or attempting even to\r\ndefine distinctly to the imagination the nature of the change. The\r\ndeepest philosophy of the age forecasts similar eventualities for an\r\nearly day and for the whole earth. Thus it is that the investigation of\r\nThe Great American Crisis, actual and urgent, might properly lead us up\r\nto the consideration of a Great World Crisis, impending and probable. On\r\nsome other occasion it may be thought proper to give to this latter\r\nsubject a distinct and more elaborate treatment. The object which we\r\nhave proposed in the present series is now sufficiently accomplished,\r\nand the writer takes leave of the reader, with a profound conviction\r\nthat to the anxious cry, What of the night? the answer, All is well, can\r\nbe conscientiously returned. Even should the seemingly disastrous\r\nfeatures sketched above in the alternative programme of our national\r\nfuture yet providentially reveal themselves in the scroll of our\r\nnation's history, let not the patriot or the lover of mankind for a\r\nmoment despair. It will be but the intensified darkness preceding the\r\nlight--the crisis of a deep-seated disease prognosticating health. The\r\ndestiny of America is the destiny of man; and that is, that we come soon\r\ninto the inheritance of new glories--an unlimited development and\r\nprosperity, founded on Religion married to Science, eventuating in the\r\nreconciliation of Order and Progression, in Universal Justice, and in\r\nthe elevation, protection, mutual coöperation and happiness of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHISTLE-DOWN.\r\n\r\n  Pale and fleecy, ghosty and white,\r\n  Onward borne in their unknown flight--\r\n  Flimsy and fragile, pure and fair--\r\n  Mystic things the thistles are.\r\n\r\n  Drifting about on a windy day--\r\n  Ghosty children at their play--\r\n  Revelling up above the trees,\r\n  Hither and thither on the breeze.\r\n\r\n  Slow and sadly, how they fly,\r\n  Chasing shadows in the sky!\r\n  Never resting, never still,\r\n  Through the valley, o'er the hill.\r\n\r\n  Walking round o'er the churchyard mould,\r\n  Up above the bosoms cold;\r\n  Flitting past each marble door,\r\n  Sadly breathing: 'Gone before!'\r\n\r\n  Spectres _wild_ with their viewless steeds,\r\n  Riding on where nothing leads;\r\n  Up to the sky when the earth gets brown--\r\n  _Ever restless_ thistle-down.\r\n\r\n  Through the forest cool and dark,\r\n  Never hitting the destined mark;\r\n  Over the earth and through the air,\r\n  Downy thistles _everywhere_.\r\n\r\n  Darting in at the open door,\r\n  Telling of joys that come no more;\r\n  Robed in grave clothes fine and thin--\r\n  Shades of phantoms, ever dim.\r\n\r\n  Up the church-aisles Sabbath-days,\r\n  Where the dusky twilight plays;\r\n  Round the altar, o'er the bier,\r\n  Preaching _more than priests do here_.\r\n\r\n  Solemn are the words they say--\r\n  _Silent sermons free of_ PAY;\r\n  And the _lessons_ they impart,\r\n  _Never vanish from the heart_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LOVE LUCIFER.\r\n\r\n\r\n     [The author of 'The Love Lucifer' says in regard to it: 'I enclose\r\n     a narration of _facts_. Not noted for assurance, I yet feel well\r\n     assured that its publication in THE CONTINENTAL 'will do\r\n     uses.'' Should there be any among our readers who have inquired\r\n     into our modern necromancy, they will not fail to recognize in the\r\n     excited, wild, incoherent, and uncultured jargon of the spirits of\r\n     'The Love Lucifer,' the same style and character evinced by those\r\n     to whom they may have been introduced by the 'mejums.' The two\r\n     Bulwers, the Howitts, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, the Halls, the De\r\n     Morgans, &c., have taken a deep interest in these half-comic,\r\n     half-serious, and always incoherent demonstrations.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps the matter-of-fact experience of our author may shield some\r\n     of our readers from 'obsessions, delusions, magnetic streams of\r\n     Od,' be they angelic, human, demoniac, or Koboldic in their\r\n     origin.--_Ed. Con._]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe things herein might well remain in soak for one decade, at least.\r\nThe writer certainly did well to let a dozen sane, practical years pass\r\nbetween these experiences and their narration.\r\n\r\nI was a youth after the own heart of my Presbyterian\r\npreceptors--proposed to become a Presbyterian preceptor. The son of a\r\nNew York merchant, I was schooled in the schooling of such; and was\r\nsteadfastly minded to know no life-purpose but the salvation of sinners.\r\nBut I was a little restive--felt that the limits of the Shorter\r\nCatechism were too short and strait for me. The shadow of\r\nSchleiermacher's readjustment of Christianity was upon me. I felt that\r\nsome old things were passing away. In common with so many others who\r\ninclined toward the sacerdotal office, I was unconsciously turning my\r\nback upon it, on account of the crudities contained in the only existing\r\ncreeds for which I had any respect. American Protestant youth have not\r\nbeen alone in this regard. Says the London _Times_, 'The number of men\r\nof education and social position who enter into orders is becoming less\r\nand less every year.' Let then ancient, true, everlasting Christianity\r\nbe speedily adjusted to modern facts, lest it further lapse.\r\n\r\nFree thoughted, earnestly disposed toward the acquirement and\r\ndissemination of absolute spiritual truth, as was not unnatural, I\r\nthoroughly investigated the 'Supernaturalism' of the day. I soon\r\nassented to the general proposition that sociability with the invisibles\r\nis practicable, if not profitable; but ever held at a cheap rate the\r\nphilosophies and religions, harmonious and other, which the full-blooded\r\nghost-mongers so zealously promulgated. I still maintain that great good\r\nwill result from these chaotic developments; for instance, that the\r\nimpartial mind will find in them that scientific foundation for belief\r\nin much of the supernaturalism (to repeat the absurd expression) of the\r\nBible, of which the age stands in such woful need. That this generation\r\ndoes experience such a lack is made sufficiently apparent in the 'Essays\r\nand Reviews.' On no other point are the noble freemen who therein and\r\nthereby grope after the 'readjustment,' so utterly deaf, dumb, halt, and\r\nblind, as they are in respect to Scripture miracles. In fact, these\r\nwriters cast the most wondrous of the _actæ sanctorum_ to the winds.\r\nMethinks the more thoughtful and earnest men of Christendom must, then,\r\nassent to the proposition that we have pressing need of a new flood of\r\nsuch practical phenomena as sturdy old Baxter gave to the Sadducees of\r\nhis day, in his 'Certainty of the World of Spirits.' Whether these\r\nstrange doings gradually cease, or take on new and more striking\r\naspects, I doubt not they will help to give a healthy vigor to our\r\nemaciated faith in the existence of an unseen and spiritual world. Let\r\nus not, then, utterly scorn the strange rabble who have rushed headlong\r\nafter this curiousest curiosity of modern times--except the\r\nrebellion--even though they may remind us of 'the Queen's ragged\r\nregiment of literature.' It should be taken for granted that so\r\nstartling a novelty would attract the floating scum of society, whether\r\nthe solid folk heeded or derided it.\r\n\r\nThough the following narrative may bring upon me an infinite derision, I\r\nhave long felt that it should be published, on account of the light it\r\nthrows upon some of the most mysterious facts of existence. Others may\r\nhave had similar experiences; but, if so, pride keeps them from\r\nconfessing how utterly they have been hoodwinked and enslaved by those\r\ninvisible loafers who form so large a portion of the newcomers and who\r\nare permitted--not to put on too fine a point--to do the dirty work of\r\ncleansing the modern mind of its gross Augean Sadduceeism. The only\r\ntheory promotive of self-complacency that I could ever concoct, as to\r\nwhy I was put through such an ordeal, is, that I was suffered for my own\r\nand the general benefit to see the dangers of necromancy, and especially\r\nthe awful psychodynamical methods used by spirits to obsess and\r\ngradually craze human brains. I, at least, received a scare that made me\r\ncareful, ever after, how I called spirits from the vasty deep, or\r\nelsewhere. After passing perils manifold, both carnal and\r\nspiritual--having gone, torrent-borne, through the yawning chasms\r\nrepresented in Cole's 'Voyage of Life' pictures, I come into calmer\r\nseas, the lines fall in pleasant places; and now I sit me down, in\r\nlife's high noon--having lighted on a certain place where was a den (a\r\npleasanter than Bunyan's)--to write the strange things that befell me in\r\nthe seeming long ago--the dew and freshness of my youth. And though I be\r\nreckoned of many a dreamer of dreams, he shall not, I think, go\r\nunprofited, who can rightly 'read my rede.'\r\n\r\nTo come, then, to the details. I had been for several months, whether\r\nwisely or unwisely doth not appear, a link in one of those human chain\r\nrings supposed to be as peculiarly receptive of extra and super and\r\nultra mundane facts as a legislative 'ring' is of the loose change of\r\nthe lobby; and had sought in vain for personal contact with the world to\r\ncome, when one afternoon a streak of the 'od' lightning suddenly ran\r\ndown my right arm, as I sat in my private apartment, and behold I was a\r\n'writing mejum.' The usual 'proofs' of relationship were given. Not\r\nbeing very credulous, however, I did not, at first, acknowledge them as\r\nsuch. But as my time was at my own disposal just then, I gave myself up\r\nto the influence for several days. The consequence was, that I became so\r\nthoroughly mesmerized, or 'biologized,' that I ceased to be complete\r\nmaster of my own faculties, and was _forced_ to give a half assent to\r\nall the absurdities that were communicated. Be it understood, then, that\r\nthese experiences are given as those of a person whose will, whose very\r\nsoul and _proprium_ had been temporarily subjugated by some other will\r\nor wills; and whose natural powers of discrimination were as much\r\ndistraught as are those of the subjects of the itinerant biologist; who\r\nare made to believe, most firmly, that cayenne pepper is sugar, that\r\nwater is fire, that a cane is a snake. As for the readers of this\r\nperiodical who still insist that even animal and spiritual magnetism are\r\nhumbugs, I can only say, with the author of the 'Night Side of Nature,'\r\n'How closely their clay must be wrapped about them!' For one, I have\r\ngenerally avoided any witnessing of marvels of this class--priding\r\nmyself in believing in their occurrence because of the pure _à priori_\r\nreasonableness of the thing.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in this, as in most other alleged intercourses\r\nwith the invisible world, there is persistent, continuous attempt to\r\nexcite _the vanity_ of the mortal who is venturing the dangerous\r\nexperiment. If the secret history of all the modern mediums were\r\nrevealed--no matter what their natural disposition to vanity--it would\r\nbe found that the vast majority of them had been incessantly flattered\r\nby their spiritual familiars, and each informed that he or she was the\r\nvery individual of whom a forlorn, misguided world had been all this\r\nwhile in anxious expectation! This appears to have been the history of\r\nnecromancy from the beginning. Flattery has ever been the chief stock in\r\ntrade of those beings who are so properly called 'seducing spirits.'\r\n'Tis ever with glozing words that these children of the wilderness gain\r\nthe ear and the affections, and entrance through the heart-gates kept by\r\nParley the Porter. Let me not be supposed to include in this class all\r\nthe spirits who have been of late years so busy among us mortal and\r\nimmortal Yankees. I consider that the old expression 'white, black, and\r\ngray' fully describes the denizens of the 'interior.' In fact, all seers\r\ninsist that human creatures, in and out of the body, appear to them\r\nwhite or variously shaded toward black, according to their moral status.\r\nIt is probable that the reason why the black and gray varieties have\r\nbeen so almost exclusively heard from, of late, is to be found in the\r\nfact, that it is contrary to the laws of God and nature for us to _seek_\r\nsociety beyond the terrestrial plane; and that our only proper course,\r\nin this regard, is to avoid the supernatural, as a general thing; and\r\nwhen it is apparently thrust upon us, to have only so much to do with it\r\nas is quite inevitable. When the authorities of heaven have anything to\r\nsay to a mortal, they will _force_ him to listen, if necessary--even if\r\nthey have to throw him, like Paul, from his horse.\r\n\r\nWell, I had embarked, like Virgil, or Dante, on my perilous tour through\r\nHades. There was, at once, a crowding about my pathway (only a bridle\r\npath) of ostensible, estimable deceased relatives, who, after imparting\r\na variety of priceless information, started off in the usual style,\r\nmagnifying mine office. According as their influence over my rational\r\nfaculties became more complete, the proportions of their Munchausenisms\r\nincreased. Unfortunately for the duration of the fantasy, their jumble\r\nof Scripture prophecies concerning me--which was then made to appear\r\nnearly coherent--was so plainly writ, that as soon as the blockade of my\r\nfaculties was raised, the illusion, never more than half complete, was\r\ndispelled. My 'great mission' was not fully developed at the first\r\nsession; but when I had become perfectly clairaudient (I never became\r\nclairvoyant), and could dispense with the pencil, a queer mixture of\r\nmetempsychosis and Parseeism was poured into my ear. It ran somewhat as\r\nfollows: The two beings first created were, a Lucifer predominant in\r\nlove, and a Lucifer predominant in intellect; whom we may call the Love\r\nLucifer and the Intellectual Lucifer. The latter was the individual who\r\nfell, who played the copperhead in Eden, and has been kicking up such a\r\nbobbery ever since. The story ran, that these two persons--the original\r\nAhriman and Ormozd--have been tilting against each other all through\r\nearth's career--appearing in the forms of the principal good and bad\r\nmen. Thus their quarrels gave the outline and the skeleton to the whole\r\nstory of Adam's race. According to this new 'philosophy of history,'\r\nthese spirits of light and darkness have been, from the beginning,\r\nstriving for the mastery; on the one hand, in the persons of the most\r\neminent saints, from Abraham to Augustine, and others not yet canonized;\r\non the other hand, in the persons of the world conquerors noted for\r\nheartless intellectuality, from Nimrod to Napoleon (shall we add Jeff.\r\nDavis?). Well, I, great I, was to enjoy the distinguished honor of\r\nfinishing the list of Love Lucifers; and, after winding up the small\r\naffairs of earth, was to lock up the other big dog--after he had\r\nappeared in his last great role--and then inaugurate the millennium--a\r\nnew latter-day Jacob's ladder having been established in the centre of\r\nAfrica to forward the work.\r\n\r\nIt soon appeared that there was a star, a _prima donna_, in this company\r\nwho--after adding a few loose planks to life's little stage--were\r\nstriving to still personate mortals and put off immortality. A deceased\r\ndamsel, of whom I had heard as 'a morning star among the living,'\r\nappeared now, as 'a Hesper among the dead;' and was imposingly\r\nintroduced to me, by a _quasi_ near 'relative,' as being only too happy\r\nto learn that she was one half of the eternal unit of which I was the\r\ncomplement. I began to be as lordly and self-satisfied as the bewildered\r\nsot in the 'Taming of the Shrew.' After exhausting my small stock of\r\nwriting paper, I concluded to allow my new friends to spend their\r\nloquacity on some old college note books, the handiwork of a\r\nrelative--every other page being blank. The venerable professors of\r\nColumbia College would have had their dignity and propriety quite\r\nfrightened out of them, had they seen what weird statements were\r\npresently sandwiched in with their dry disquisitions on science and\r\nphilosophy. Whenever an especially startling announcement was made, a\r\nfurious gust of the 'od' would run down my arm; and each word would be\r\nmade to cover half a page. We went into the new business regardless of\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nMy invisible charmer, who had--it must be said, not very\r\nprudishly--proposed for my hand, no sooner got possession of it, than\r\n'she' began to protest that when she learned what a splendid fate was in\r\nstore for her, as _tender_ to my royal highness, she could only weep for\r\njoy for several days. Presently she sent out through my captive digits\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n'We have, indeed, a long journey to travel together, most loving\r\npartner; and how my innermost soul exults, in view of that unending\r\noneness, of soul and spirit, which is to be our portion! .... Ah me, why\r\nwas I chosen to join my eternal being with yours? when innumerable\r\nseraphs would salute you 'husband' with enthusiastic joy and\r\ngratitude!....'\r\n\r\nHere is one plain fact, whatever else may be doubted. After conversing\r\nfor two days with this extraordinary visitor, I became most desperately\r\nin love with her, or him, or it--as you please. Though past my majority,\r\nmy placid nature had never before been thoroughly aroused in this\r\ndirection. Now, by reason of the tact and knowledge of my nature,\r\npossessed by the invisible party, and still more because of my state of\r\nmesmeric subjection, I was sighing like a furnace or a Romeo. Not\r\nUlysses, Circe tempted--not Sintram seeking his Undine--not the hapless\r\nsailor wight pursuing the maiden of the _mer_, was more utterly enamored\r\nthan was I. As a proof that I was no bad specimen of the 'gushing'\r\npersuasion, at this period, read the following expressive though\r\nsometimes commonplace retort. I do not profess to know, and do not much\r\ncare, whether it was the utterance of an artful fiend, a misguided\r\nsaint, or one of those 'sympathetic spirits' of whom Swedenborg makes\r\nfrequent mention. According to his statement, these beings are in such a\r\ncondition, that whenever they come in contact with a mortal, they chime\r\nin with and encourage the views and tendencies of their terrestrial\r\nacquaintance; and often, without meaning it, lead him into great\r\nerrors--being themselves used as cats' paws by decidedly evil spirits.\r\nBut here is the tender missive, which I transcribe from between two\r\nheavy pages of notes on the Aristotelian and Baconian philosophies:\r\n\r\n'I thought that I had experienced the joys of reciprocal affection; but\r\nnever until now have begun to realize what an unbounded sea of bliss two\r\nkindred souls can bathe in. Ah! who could have convinced me that so\r\nmuch rapture could be crowded into a few moments, as was mine while you\r\nwere pouring forth the inexhaustible treasures of your mind upon my\r\nentranced ear? Spare me the sudden transition from mere esteem to such\r\nhuge, melodious irresistible outpouring of affection. It takes away my\r\nstrength; while the expression of my warm feelings can never so affect\r\nyour sturdy, much tried, trouble-scathed manhood.'\r\n\r\nYou see that the flattery is never forgotten. But adulation is an\r\ninstrument of the weak as well as of the deceitful. The utterer of this\r\nmay have been innocent of fraud, and, like myself, mesmerized into\r\nfollowing the will of a more powerful being. Again, the purpose of\r\n_this_ being may have been a good one. Such, and so many, and so great,\r\nand varied, and strange, seem to be the possibilities and dangers of the\r\ninner life.\r\n\r\nA systematic series of attempts seems to have been made--by some person\r\nor persons to the deponent most emphatically unknown--to get my cool,\r\nphlegmatic nervous system and brain excited. The two principal means\r\nmade use of to complete the obsession were, that just mentioned, and the\r\nannouncement of a succession of 'big things,' as about to occur--the\r\nbiggest kind of things--those the expectation of which was best\r\ncalculated to set my brain in a whirl. It will be seen, in the sequel,\r\nthat, failing to thoroughly accomplish their purpose by such means, my\r\nspirit friends or fiends, as the case may be, undertook the bug-a-boo,\r\nfrightening process; which was apparently working successfully, when\r\ntheir operations, in that style, were suddenly brought to a final close,\r\nby some means which must ever, I suppose, remain unknown to me. The\r\nstartling events stated as imminent were generally made dependent upon\r\nthe clairvoyant opening that had been promised me.\r\n\r\nThe first beatific vision that was to greet my gaze would be, of course,\r\nthat one which I was to behold most frequently throughout the æons\r\nwithout end--even the face of that radiant being who had gone before, to\r\nawait me in the angelhood; where, beaming seraphic upon me forever, it\r\nwas to be to me the embodiment of all ideals of loveliness, grace,\r\nrefinement, love. In its every lineament I was to read and decipher an\r\nendless series of ever fresh and most celestial arcana--was continually\r\nto find new proof of love and wisdom, and of the divine ability to adapt\r\nhuman to human. Since the love of the mate is next to the love of the\r\nMaker, it is no profanity to say that,\r\n\r\n  'When I'd been there ten thousand years,\r\n    Bright, happy as the sun,\r\n  I'd have no less days to sing its praise\r\n    Than when I first begun.'\r\n\r\nInstead of through a fast-waning honeymoon of love, that face was to\r\nentrance me while the sun of heaven stood in the zenith of heaven--and\r\nwe read that there is _no_ night there, forevermore. Was not this\r\npromised sight a sufficient cause for excitement? What prospect--save\r\nthat of a vision of Deity--could be better adapted to arouse the\r\nloftiest and most exquisite emotions? What better fitted to gather into\r\none all long-cherished feelings of admiration and reverence for the\r\nnoble of the other sex--to aggregate and revive all those chivalrous,\r\ngallant, elevating, purifying, tender thoughts which we have ever had,\r\nwith regard to them, in our highest moments?\r\n\r\nSome reader may say: 'Why will you thus attempt to dignify ideas that\r\nyou acknowledge were excited in a confused brain, by apparently\r\nmischievous or irresponsible spirits?' I answer, that even if the\r\nimmediate exciting cause of this current of ideas was some ill-designing\r\nbeing, the ideas themselves were not, necessarily, either evil or\r\nundignified; and that only such portion of the brain was addled as would\r\nbe likely to rebel against the obsession.\r\n\r\nWaiting the appointed hour, I sat imagining the scene. I saw _myself_\r\nsuddenly rising ('sudden Ianthe rose') from the prone body and all\r\ncircumjacent grossness--rising, through clouds and darkness, to some\r\ndelightsome plane of the inner world. A dozen yards in front of me,\r\nbeside a graceful tree, would stand 'the only.' We would gaze at each\r\nother, with intense scrutiny, for some moments. Each would think, 'There\r\nis plenty of time; it is to last forever.' We would even look about us,\r\nstill saying nothing. Being eternally modelled, fitted, fore-ordained,\r\nand predestined for each other, love arrows would, of course, have\r\npierced our centres of palpitation at the first mutual glance. Still,\r\nthough quivering with emotion, neither would be disposed to lessen the\r\ndistance. Methought we would even seat ourselves on the mossy banks--the\r\ndozen yards still intervening--and, each leaning back against a tree,\r\nwould 'face the enemy'--the eternal joy-sharer, sorrow-sharer, worship,\r\nwisdom, love, pity, wonder, use, sport, hope-sharer; while,\r\noccasionally, a premonitory, prophetic pang of rapture out of the coming\r\neternities of bliss would thrill through us. I had even a fancy that\r\nthere would be no interchange of words, no lessening of the coy distance\r\nof space and manner, during this first interview. 'It is to last so\r\nlong! so long!' Again, I fancied that we might sit there only weeping,\r\nas we looked and _loved_. 'So long! so long!' Tender, dewy eyes\r\nwandering naively, innocently, over each feature of face and\r\nform--inquiry, wonder, joy in them--pleased surprise, that such and such\r\npoints of the vision should be as they are. Indefinite longings becoming\r\ndefinite, as all things longed for appear embodied, as faith is lost in\r\nsight. Again, I imagined laconic speech might ensue--like the\r\nsingle-line dialogue of Greek tragedies. But here the wings of\r\nimagination drooped, and I could only see the separation. She would\r\nglide toward me. Her warm finger-tips would touch my palm, her tender\r\nazure eyes would beam once fully and closely upon me. One moment I would\r\nsee the inner heaven opened; and the next--the familiar furniture of my\r\nroom would be before me. Thus I imagined. The curious may learn what\r\nactually befell, on a future occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN FINANCES AND RESOURCES.\r\n\r\nLETTER NO. IV. OF HON. ROBERT J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          LONDON, 10 Half Moon Street, Piccadilly,\r\n                                            _January 1st, 1864._\r\n\r\nIn my third and last letter on American Finances and Resources, the\r\neffect of the substitution of free for slave labor in the United States\r\nby the abolition of slavery was discussed. In that letter it was shown\r\nby the official American Census of 1860, that the product that year,\r\n_per capita_, of Massachusetts was $235; _per capita_, Maryland $96; and\r\nof South Carolina $56. Massachusetts had no slaves; Maryland, 87,189;\r\nand South Carolina, 402,406. Thus we see the annual value of the\r\nproducts of labor decreased in proportion to the number of slaves. In\r\nfurther proof of the position assumed in that letter, that the progress\r\nof wealth, of population, and education in the United States, was most\r\ninjuriously affected by slavery, I now present other official facts from\r\nour Census of 1860. My first comparison will be that of the Free State\r\nof New York with slaveholding Virginia.\r\n\r\nBy the Census, the population of Virginia in 1790 was 748,308, and in\r\n1860, 1,596,318, making the ratio of increase 113.32 per cent. In 1790\r\nNew York numbered 340,120, and in 1860, 3,880,735, the ratio of increase\r\nbeing 1,040.99. (Table 1, Prelim. Census Rep., p. 132.) Thus, the rate\r\nof increase in New York exceeded that of Virginia more than nine to one.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, the population of Virginia was largely more than double that of\r\nNew York. In 1860, the population of New York was very largely more than\r\ndouble that of Virginia. In 1790, Virginia, in population, ranked first\r\nof all the States, and New York the fifth. In 1860, they had reversed\r\ntheir positions, and New York was the first, and Virginia the fifth.\r\n(Rep. p. 120.) At the same rate of progress, from 1860 to 1900, as from\r\n1790 to 1860, Virginia, retaining slavery, would have sunk from the\r\nfirst to the twenty-first State, and would still continue, at each\r\nsucceeding decade, descending the inclined plane toward the lowest\r\nposition of all the States. Such has been, and still continues to be,\r\nthe effect of slavery, in dragging down that once great State from the\r\nfirst toward the last in rank in the Union. But if, as in the absence of\r\nslavery must have been the case, Virginia had increased from 1790 to\r\n1860 in the same ratio as New York, her population in 1860 would have\r\nbeen 7,789,141, and she must always have remained the first in rank of\r\nall the States.\r\n\r\nAREA.--The natural advantages of Virginia far exceed those of\r\nNew York. The area of Virginia is 61,352 square miles, and that of New\r\nYork 47,000. The population of Virginia per square mile in 1790 was\r\n12.19, and in 1860, 26.02. That of New York, in 1790, was 7.83, and in\r\n1860, 84.36. Now, if New York, with her present numbers per square mile,\r\nhad the area of Virginia, her population, in 1860, would have been\r\n5,175,654, and that of Virginia, reduced to the area of New York, on the\r\nbasis of her present numbers per square mile, would have been 1,320,000.\r\nThis illustrates the immense effect of area, as one of the great\r\nelements influencing the progress of population. But wonderful as are\r\nthese results, the great fact is omitted in this calculation, that\r\nVirginia, in 1790, had largely more than double the population of New\r\nYork. Thus, if we reverse the numbers of New York and Virginia in 1790,\r\nand take the actual ratio of increase of each for the succeeding seventy\r\nyears, the population of Virginia, in 1860, would have been 728,875, and\r\nthat of New York, as we have seen, would have been 7,789,141, making the\r\ndifference exceed seven millions, or very largely more than ten to one.\r\nReverse the areas also, and the difference would exceed eight millions.\r\n\r\nSHORE LINE.--As furnishing cheap and easy access for imports\r\nand exports, creating marts for commerce with great cities, and\r\naffecting the interior most beneficially, the shore line, with adequate\r\nharbors, constitutes a vast element in the progress of states and\r\nempires. Now, by the last tables of the United States Coast Survey, the\r\nshore line of Virginia was 1,571 miles, and of New York 725 miles. The\r\nfive great parallel tide-water rivers of Virginia, the Potomac, the\r\nRappahannock, the York River, James River, and Roanoke (partly in North\r\nCarolina), with their tributaries, furnish easy access for hundreds of\r\nmiles into the interior, with both shores of the noble Chesapeake Bay\r\nfor many miles, as well as its magnificent outlet and the main ocean for\r\na considerable distance, all within the limits of Virginia. We have seen\r\nthat the coast line of Virginia is largely more than double that of New\r\nYork, and the harbors of Virginia are more numerous, deeper, and much\r\nnearer the great valley of the Ohio and Mississippi. By the Coast Survey\r\ntables, the mean low water in the harbor of New York, by Gedney's\r\nChannel, is 20 feet, and at high-water spring tides is 24.2; north\r\nchannel, 24, mean low water, and 29.1 spring tides, high water; south\r\nchannel, 22, and 27.1; main ship channel, after passing S. W. spit buoy,\r\non N. E. course, one mile up the bay, for New York, 22.5-27.06. By the\r\nsame tables, from capes at entrance of Chesapeake Bay to Hampton, at\r\nmean low water, 30 feet; spring tides, high water, 32.8. Anchorage in\r\nHampton Roads, 59-61.8. From Hampton Roads to Sewell's Point, 25-27.8.\r\nSouth of Sewell's Point (one mile and a half), 21-23.8; up to Norfolk,\r\n23-25.8. From Hampton Roads to James River, entering to the northward of\r\nNewport News, middle ground, 22-24.8. From Hampton Roads to James River,\r\nentering to the southward of Newport News, middle ground, 27-29.8. From\r\nabreast the tail of York Spit, up to Yorktown, 33-35.8. Elizabeth River,\r\nbetween Norfolk and navy yard, 25.5-28.3.\r\n\r\nWhen we leave the tide-water rivers for the interior navigable streams,\r\nVirginia has a vast advantage. New York has no such rivers above tide,\r\nbut Virginia has the Ohio for hundreds of miles, with its tributaries,\r\nthe Kanawha, Guyandotte, and Big Sandy. It is true, New York has several\r\nof the great lakes, and the vast advantage of connection with them\r\nthrough her great canal. But, in the absence of slavery, the canal\r\nprojected by Washington (preceding that of New York) would have\r\nconnected, through Virginia, the Chesapeake Bay with the Ohio River. The\r\nJames River, flowing into the Chesapeake, cuts the Blue Mountains, and\r\nthe Kanawha, a confluent of the Ohio, cuts the Alleghany; thus opening\r\nan easy and practicable route for a great canal from the eastern to the\r\nwestern waters. The valley of the lakes, with which New York is\r\nconnected by her canal, has an area of 335,515 square miles. The valley\r\nof the Mississippi, with which the Chesapeake would long since, in the\r\nabsence of slavery, have been connected by the Virginia canal, has an\r\narea of 1,226,600 square miles. The shore line of the Mississippi and\r\nits tributaries, above tide water, is 35,644 miles. (Page 35, Compend.\r\nCensus of 1850.) Our shore line of the lakes is 3,620 miles, including\r\nbays, sounds, and islands; and that of the British, 2,629. (Ib. 35.) The\r\nconnection of the lakes with the Ohio and Mississippi would be the same\r\nfor both States, the one being from the lakes to these rivers, and the\r\nother from the rivers to the lakes. The location of Virginia is more\r\ncentral than that of New York, and Virginia runs farther west by several\r\nhundred miles. We are so accustomed to look at the connection of New\r\nYork with the West by her canal, and Virginia with no such union, that\r\nit is difficult to realize the great change if Virginia had been\r\nconnected by her progressing work with the Ohio and Mississippi, and\r\nthence, by the present canals, with the lakes.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent, then, that, as regards easy access to the West, the\r\nnatural advantages of Virginia surpass New York, and with greater\r\nfacilities for artificial works. How many decades would be required,\r\nafter emancipation, to bring the superior natural advantages of Virginia\r\ninto practical operation, is not the question; nor do I believe that the\r\ncity of New York will ever cease to be the centre of our own trade, and\r\nultimately of the commerce of the world. But although Virginia, in\r\nadhering to slavery, has lost her supremacy in the Union, it is quite\r\ncertain that, as a Free State, she would commence a new career of\r\nwonderful prosperity, that capital and population from the North and\r\nfrom Europe would flow there with a mighty current, her lands be doubled\r\nin value, and her town and city property far more than quadrupled.\r\n\r\nMINES.--Virginia has vast mines of coal, the great element of\r\nmodern progress. New York has none. It is coal that has made Great\r\nBritain a mighty empire, giving her power, by land and sea, equal to\r\nthe manual force of all mankind. It is stated by the Commissioner of the\r\nGeneral Land Office, in his report before referred to, of November,\r\n1860, 'that an acre of coal, three feet thick, is equal to the product\r\nof 1,940 acres of forest trees; and each acre of a coal seam four feet\r\nin thickness, and yielding one yard of pure coal, is equivalent to 5,000\r\ntons, and possesses, therefore, a reserve of mechanical strength in its\r\nfuel, equal to the life labor of more than 1,600 men.'\r\n\r\nThis statement of the Commissioner is made on the highest authority, and\r\nproves the vast natural advantages of Virginia over New York. Virginia,\r\nalso, has far more abundant mines of iron, more widely diffused over the\r\nState, reaching from tide water to the Ohio. She has also these iron\r\nmines in juxtaposition with coal and all the fluxes. Virginia, also, has\r\nvaluable mines of gold, lead, and copper. New York has no gold or copper\r\nmines, and produced in 1860 but $800 worth of lead. (Table 14.)\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC POWER.--Omitting Niagara, which thus far scorns the\r\ncontrol of man, the hydraulic power of Virginia very far exceeds that of\r\nNew York. It is to be found on the Potomac and its tributaries, and upon\r\nnearly every stream that flows into the Chesapeake or Ohio. The superior\r\nmildness of the climate of Virginia makes this power available there for\r\na much greater portion of the year. The great falls of the Potomac,\r\nwhere Washington constructed the largest locks of the continent, has a\r\nwater power unsurpassed, and is but twelve miles from tide water, at\r\nWashington. This point is a most healthy and beautiful location,\r\nsurrounded by lands whose natural fertility was very great, and, in the\r\nabsence of slavery, must have been a vast manufacturing city. This water\r\npower could move more spindles than are now worked on all this\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND MANUFACTURES.--The natural fertility of the\r\nsoil of Virginia far exceeded that of New York, with a more genial sun,\r\nand much more favorable seasons for agricultural products, as well as\r\nfor stock. The number of acres of land in Virginia susceptible of\r\nprofitable culture, is nearly double that of New York, but much of it\r\nhas been impoverished by slave labor, scratching and exhausting the\r\nsoil, without manure or rotation of crops. The Census shows that\r\nVirginia has all the products of New York, and cotton in addition.\r\nVirginia produced, in 1860, 12,727 bales of cotton (Table 36), worth, at\r\npresent prices, nearly $3,000,000. She also adjoins the States of North\r\nCarolina and Tennessee, producing, in 1850, 372,964 bales, worth, at\r\npresent prices, nearly $90,000,000. Virginia is also much nearer than\r\nNew York to all the other cotton States. With these vast advantages,\r\nwith her larger area, more fertile soil, cheaper subsistence, her coal\r\nand iron and great hydraulic power, with so much cotton raised by\r\nherself and in adjacent States, Virginia should have manufactured much\r\nmore cotton than New York. But, by the Census (Table 22), the value of\r\nthe cotton manufacture of Virginia in 1850 was $1,446,109, and in 1860,\r\n$1,063,611--a decrease of one third. In New York, the value of the\r\ncotton manufacture in 1850 was $5,019,323, and in 1860, $7,471,961, an\r\nincrease of over 48 per cent. So, if we look at the tables of mines,\r\nmanufactures, and the fisheries, with the vastly superior advantages of\r\nVirginia, the whole product in 1860 was of the value of $51,300,000, and\r\nof agriculture $68,700,000; while in New York these values were\r\nrespectively $379,633,560 and $226,376,440. (Tables of Census, 33 and\r\n36.)\r\n\r\nCLIMATE AND MORTALITY.--By Table 6, page 22, of the Census,\r\nthere were for the year ending June 1st, 1860, 46,881 deaths in New\r\nYork, being 1 in every 82 of the population, and 1.22 per cent. The\r\nnumber of deaths in Virginia, in the same year, was 22,472, being 1 in\r\nevery 70 of the population, or 1.43 per cent. There was, then, a slight\r\ndifference in favor of New York. But Virginia is divided into four\r\ngeographical sections; the tide-water, the Piedmont (running from the\r\ntide-water region to the Blue Mountains), the valley between these\r\nmountains and the Alleghanies, and the trans-Alleghany to the Ohio.\r\nThese three last sections, containing three fourths of the area and\r\nwhite population of the State, surpass New York in salubrity, with the\r\nmost bracing and delightful climate. The climate of Virginia is far more\r\nfavorable for stock and agricultural products than New York, with longer\r\nand better seasons, and is more salubrious than the climate of Europe.\r\n(Comp. 1850.)\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WEALTH.--We have seen how great was the advance in\r\npopulation of New York over Virginia, from 1790 to 1860, being in the\r\nratio of more than 9 to 1. Now let us compare the relative progress of\r\nwealth. It is contended by the advocates of slavery, that it accumulates\r\nwealth more rapidly, and thus enriches the nation, although it may\r\ndepress its moral and intellectual development, its increase of numbers\r\nand of power, and tarnish its reputation throughout the world. As\r\npopulation and its labor create wealth, it must be retarded by a system\r\nwhich, as we have seen in this case, diminishes the relative advance of\r\nnumbers in the ratio of more than 9 to 1. But the Census proves that\r\nslavery greatly retards the increase of wealth. By Tables 33 and 36 of\r\nthe Census of 1860, it appears, omitting commerce, that the products of\r\nindustry, as given, viz., of agriculture, manufactures, mines, and\r\nfisheries, were that year in New York $606,000,000, or $156 _per\r\ncapita_; and in Virginia $120,000,000, or $75 _per capita_. This shows a\r\ntotal value of product in New York more than five times greater than in\r\nVirginia, and _per capita_ more than 2 to 1. If we include the earnings\r\nof commerce, and all business not given in the Census, I think it will\r\nbe shown hereafter, that the value of the products and earnings of New\r\nYork, in 1860, exceeded those of Virginia at least 7 to 1. As to the\r\nrate of increase, the value of the products of agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, mines, and fisheries, of Virginia, in 1850, was\r\n$84,180,428 (Table 9), and in New York $358,736,603, showing an increase\r\nin Virginia from 1850 to 1860 of $35,519,572, being 41 per cent., and in\r\nNew York $249,263,397, being 70 per cent., exhibiting a difference of 29\r\nper cent. Now the increase of population in Virginia from 1850 to 1860\r\nwas 12.29 per cent., and in New York 25.29 per cent., the difference\r\nbeing only 13 per cent. (Table 1, p. 131.) Thus, it appears, the\r\nincrease of wealth in New York, exclusive of the gains of commerce, as\r\ncompared with Virginia, was more than double the ratio of the\r\naugmentation of population. By the Census Table of 1860, No. 35, p. 195,\r\n'The true value of the real and personal property, according to the\r\neighth Census was, New York, $1,843,338,517, and of Virginia,\r\n$793,249,681.' Now we have seen the value of the products of New York in\r\n1860 by the Census was $606,000,000, and in Virginia $120,000,000. Thus,\r\nas a question of the annual yield of capital, that of New York was 34\r\nper cent., and Virginia 15 per cent.; the annual product of capital\r\nbeing more than double in New York what it was in Virginia. The problem\r\nthen is solved in Virginia, as it was in Maryland and South Carolina,\r\nand all the South compared with all the North, that slavery retards the\r\nprogress of wealth and accumulation of capital in the ratio of 2 to 1.\r\nOur war taxes may be very great, but the tax of slavery is far greater,\r\nand the relief from it, in a few years, will add much more to the\r\nnational wealth than the whole deduction made by the war debt. Our total\r\nwealth, by the Census of 1860, being, by Table 35, $16,159,616,068, one\r\nper cent. taken annually to pay the interest and gradually extinguish\r\nthe war debt, would be $161,596,160; whereas, judging by Virginia and\r\nNew York, the diminished increase of the annual product of capital, as\r\nthe result of slavery, is 2.10 per cent., or $453,469,250 per annum,\r\nequal in a decade, without compounding the annual results, to\r\n$4,534,692,500.\r\n\r\nThat our population would have reached in 1860 nearly 40,000,000, and\r\nour wealth have been more than doubled, if slavery had been extinguished\r\nin 1790, is one of the revelations made by the Census; while in science,\r\nin education, and national power, the advance would have been still more\r\nrapid, and the moral force of our example and success would have\r\ncontrolled for the benefit of mankind the institutions of the world.\r\n\r\nBy Table 36, page 196, of the Census of 1860, the _cash_ value of the\r\nfarms of Virginia was $371,096,211, being $11.91 per acre, and of New\r\nYork $803,343,593, being $38.26 per acre. Now, by the Table, the number\r\nof acres embraced in these farms of New York was 20,992,950, and in\r\nVirginia 31,014,950, the difference of value per acre being $25.36, or\r\nmuch more than 3 to 1 in favor of New York. Now, if we multiply this\r\nnumber of acres of farm lands of Virginia by the New York value, it\r\nwould make the total value of the farm lands of Virginia,\r\n$1,186,942,136, and the _additional_ value caused by emancipation\r\n$815,845,925. But, stupendous as is this result in regard to lands, it\r\nis far below the reality. We have seen that the farm lands of Virginia,\r\nimproved and unimproved, constituted 31,014,950 acres. By the Census and\r\nthe Land Office Tables, the area of Virginia is 39,265,280 acres. Deduct\r\nthe farm lands, and there remain unoccupied 8,250,330 acres. Now,\r\nVirginia's population to the square mile being 26.02, and that of New\r\nYork 84.36, with an equal density in Virginia, more than two thirds of\r\nthese Virginia lands, as in New York, must have been occupied as farms.\r\nThis would have been equivalent, at two thirds, to 5,500,000 acres,\r\nwhich, at their present average value of $2 per acre, would be worth\r\n$11,000,000; but, at the value per acre of the New York lands, these\r\n5,500,000 acres would be worth $206,430,000. Deduct from this their\r\npresent value, $11,000,000, and the remainder, $195,430,000, is the sum\r\nby which the unoccupied lands of Virginia, converted into farms, would\r\nhave been increased in value by emancipation. Add this to the enhanced\r\nvalue of their present farms, $815,845,925, and the result would be\r\n$1,011,275,925, as the gain of Virginia in the value of lands by\r\nemancipation. To these we should add, from the same cause, the\r\nenhancement of the town and city property in Virginia to the extent of\r\nseveral hundred millions of dollars. In order to realize the truth, we\r\nmust behold Virginia as she would have been, with New York railroads and\r\ncanals, farms, manufactures, commerce, towns, and cities. Then we must\r\nconsider the superior natural advantages of Virginia, her far greater\r\narea, her richer soil, her more genial sun, her greater variety of\r\nproducts, her mines of coal, iron, gold, copper, and lead, her\r\npetroleum, her superior hydraulic power, her much larger coast line,\r\nwith more numerous and deeper harbors--and reflect what Virginia would\r\nhave been in the absence of slavery. Her early statesmen, Washington,\r\nJefferson, Madison, Monroe, Mason, Tucker, and Marshall, all realized\r\nthis great truth, and all desired to promote emancipation in Virginia.\r\nBut their advice was disregarded by her present leaders--the new, false,\r\nand fatal dogmas of Calhoun were substituted; and, as a consequence,\r\nVirginia, from the first rank (_longo intervallo_) of all the States,\r\nhas fallen to the fifth, and, with slavery continued, will descend still\r\nmore rapidly in the future than in the past.\r\n\r\nBy Census Table 36, p. 197, the value, in 1860, of the farm lands of all\r\nthe Slave States, was $2,570,466,935, and the number of acres\r\n245,721,062, worth $10.46 per acre. In the Free States, the value of the\r\nfarm lands was $4,067,947,286, and the number of acres 161,462,008,\r\nworth $25.19 per acre. Now if, as certainly in the absence of slavery\r\nwould have been the case, the farm lands of the South had been worth as\r\nmuch per acre as those of the North, their total value would have been\r\n$6,189,713,551, and, deducting the present price, the _additional_ cash\r\nvalue would have been $3,619,246,616.\r\n\r\nBut if, to this, we add the _increased_ value of the _unoccupied_ lands\r\nof the South, by multiplying them by the difference between their value\r\nper acre and that of the _unoccupied_ lands of the North, the result is\r\n$2,240,000,000, which, added to that of the farm lands, makes\r\n$5,859,246,616, as the augmented value of the lands of the South caused\r\nby emancipation.\r\n\r\nBy Census Tables of 1860, 33 and 36, the total value of the products of\r\nagriculture, manufactures, mines, and fisheries in the Free States was\r\n$4,150,000,000, and of the Slave States $1,140,000,000, making the\r\nproducts of the Free States in 1860 nearly 4 to 1 of the Slave States,\r\nand $217 _per capita_ for the Free States, and for the Slave States $93\r\n_per capita_. This is exclusive of commerce, which would greatly\r\nincrease the ratio in favor of the North, that of New York alone being\r\nnearly equal to that of all the Slave States. Now, multiplying the\r\npopulation of the Slave States by the value of the products _per capita_\r\nof the Free States, and the result is $2,653,631,032, making, by\r\nemancipation, the increased annual product of the Slave States\r\n$1,511,031,032, and in ten years, exclusive of the yearly accumulations,\r\n$15,110,310,320.\r\n\r\nBy the Table 35, Census of 1860, the total value of all the property,\r\nreal and personal, of the Free States, was $10,852,081,681, and of the\r\nSlave States, $5,225,307,034. Now, the product, in 1860, of the Free\r\nStates, being $4,150,000,000, the annual yield on the capital was 39 per\r\ncent.; and, the product of the Slave States being $1,140,000,000, the\r\nyield on the capital was 22 per cent. This was the gross product in both\r\ncases. I have worked out these amazing results from the Census Tables,\r\nto illustrate the fact, that the same law, by which slavery retarded the\r\nprogress of wealth in Virginia, as compared with New York, and of\r\nMaryland and South Carolina, as compared with Massachusetts, rules the\r\nrelative advance in wealth of all the Slave States, as compared with\r\nthat of all the Free States. I have stated that the statistics of\r\ncommerce, omitted in these tables, would vastly increase the difference\r\nin favor of the Free States as compared with the Slave States, and of\r\nNew York as contrasted with Virginia. I shall now resume the latter\r\ninquiry, so as to complete the comparison between New York and Virginia.\r\nBy commerce is embraced, in this examination, all earnings not included\r\nunder the heads of agriculture, manufactures, the mines, or fisheries.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS.--The number of miles of railroads in operation in\r\nNew York, in 1860, including city roads, was 2,842 miles,[3] costing\r\n$138,395,055; and in Virginia, 1,771 miles, costing $64,958,807. (Census\r\nTable of 1860, No. 38, pp. 230 and 233.) Now, by the same Census Report,\r\np. 105, the value of the freights of the New York roads for 1860 was as\r\nfollows: Product of the forest--tons carried, 373,424; value per ton,\r\n$20; total value, $7,468,480. Of animals--895,519 tons; value per ton,\r\n$200; total value, $179,103,800. Vegetable food--1,103,646 tons; value\r\nper ton, $50; total value, $55,182,000. Other agricultural\r\nproducts--143,219 tons; value per ton, $15; total value, $2,148,055.\r\nManufactures--511,916 tons; value per ton, $500; total value,\r\n$391,905,500. Other articles--930,244 tons; value $10 per ton; total\r\nvalue, $9,302,440. Grand total, 4,741,773 tons carried; value per ton,\r\n$163. Total values, $773,089,275. Deducting one quarter for duplication,\r\nmakes 3,556,330 tons carried on the New York roads in 1860; and the\r\nvalue, $579,681,790. The values of the freights on the Virginia roads,\r\nas estimated, is $60,000,000, giving an excess to those of New York of\r\n$519,681,790, on the value of railroad freights in 1860. The passenger\r\naccount, not given, would largely increase the disparity in favor of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nCANALS.--The number of miles of canals in New York is 1,038,\r\nand their cost $67,567,972. In Virginia, the number of miles is 178, and\r\nthe cost $7,817,000. (Census Table 39, p. 238.) The estimated value of\r\nthe freight on the New York canals is 19 times that of the freight on\r\nthe Virginia canals. (Census.)\r\n\r\nTONNAGE.--The tonnage of vessels built in New York in 1860 was\r\n31,936 tons, and in Virginia 4,372. (Census, p. 107.)\r\n\r\nBANKS.--The number of banks in New York in 1860 was 303;\r\ncapital $111,441,320, loans $200,351,332, specie $20,921,545,\r\ncirculation $29,959,506, deposits $101,070,273: and in Virginia the\r\nnumber was 65; capital $16,005,156, loans $24,975,792, specie\r\n$2,943,652; circulation $9,812,197, deposits $7,729,652. (Table 34, p.\r\n193, Census.)\r\n\r\nINSURANCE COMPANIES.--The risks taken in New York were\r\n$916,474,956, or nearly one third of those in the whole Union. Virginia,\r\nestimated at $100,000,000; difference in favor of New York $816,474,956.\r\n(Census, p. 79.)\r\n\r\nEXPORTS AND IMPORTS, ETC.--Our exports abroad from New York for\r\nthe fiscal year ending 30th June, 1860, were $145,555,449, and the\r\nforeign imports $248,489,877; total of both, $394,045,326. The\r\nclearances same year from New York were 4,574,285 tons, and the entries\r\n4,836,448 tons; total of both, 9,410,733 tons. In Virginia, the exports\r\nthe same year were $5,858,024, and the imports $1,326,249; total of\r\nboth, $7,184,273; clearances, 80,381 tons, entries, 97,762 tons; total\r\nof both, 178,143 tons. (Table 14, Register of United States Treasury.)\r\nRevenue collected from customs same year in New York, $37,788,969, and\r\nin Virginia $189,816, or 200 to 1 in favor of New York. (Tables U. S.\r\nCom. of Customs.) No returns are given for the coastwise and internal\r\ntrade of either State, but the tables of the railway and canal\r\ntransportation of States show nearly the same proportion in favor of New\r\nYork as in the foreign trade. Thus the _domestic_ exports from New York\r\nfor the above year abroad were $126,060,967, and from Virginia\r\n$5,833,370. (Same Table, 14.) And yet Virginia, as we have seen, had\r\nmuch greater natural advantages than New York for commerce, as well as\r\nfor mines, manufactures, and agriculture. But slavery has almost\r\nexpelled commerce from Virginia, and nearly paralyzed all other\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nThese Tables, taken from the Census and the Treasury records, prove\r\nincontestably, that slavery retards the progress of wealth and\r\npopulation throughout the South, but especially in Virginia. Nor can the\r\nTariff account for the results; for Virginia, as we have seen, possesses\r\nfar greater advantages than New York for manufactures. Besides, the\r\ncommerce of New York far surpasses that of Virginia, and this is the\r\nbranch of industry supposed to be affected most injuriously by high\r\ntariffs, and New York has generally voted against them with as much\r\nunanimity as Virginia. But there is a still more conclusive proof. The\r\nyear 1824 was the commencement of the era of high tariffs, and yet, from\r\n1790 to 1820, as proved by the Census, the percentage of increase of New\r\nYork over Virginia was greater than from 1820 to 1860. Thus, by Table 1\r\nof the Census, p. 124, the increase of population in Virginia was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n   From 1790 to 1800  17.63 per cent.\r\n     \"  1800  \" 1810  10.73    \"\r\n     \"  1810  \" 1820   9.31    \"\r\n     \"  1820  \" 1830  13.71    \"\r\n     \"  1830  \" 1840   2.34    \"\r\n     \"  1840  \" 1850  14.60    \"\r\n     \"  1850  \" 1860  12.29    \"\r\n\r\nThe increase of population in New York was:\r\n\r\n  From 1790 to 1800  72.51 per cent.\r\n    \"  1800  \" 1810  63.45    \"\r\n    \"  1810  \" 1820  43.14    \"\r\n    \"  1820  \" 1830  39.76    \"\r\n    \"  1830  \" 1840  26.60    \"\r\n    \"  1840  \" 1850  27.52    \"\r\n    \"  1850  \" 1860  25.29    \"\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the population of Virginia was 748,318, in 1820, 1,065,129, and\r\nin 1860, 1,596,318. In 1790 the population of New York was 340,120, in\r\n1820, 1,372,111, and in 1860, 3,880,735. Thus, from 1790 to 1820, before\r\nthe inauguration of the protective policy, the relative increase of the\r\npopulation of New York, as compared with Virginia, was very far greater\r\nthan from 1820 to 1860. It is quite clear, then, that the Tariff had no\r\ninfluence whatever in depressing the progress of Virginia as compared\r\nwith New York.\r\n\r\nWe have heretofore proved by the Census the same position as regards the\r\nrelative progress of Maryland and Massachusetts, and the same principle\r\napplies as between all the Free, as compared with all the Slave States.\r\nIn New York, we have seen that from 1790 to 1820, in the absence of high\r\ntariffs, and even before the completion of her great canal, her advance\r\nin population was much more rapid than from 1820 to 1860. Indeed, it is\r\nquite clear that, so far as the Tariff had any influence, it was far\r\nmore unfavorable to New York than to Virginia, New York being a much\r\ngreater agricultural as well as commercial State.\r\n\r\nHaving shown how much the material progress of Virginia has been\r\nretarded by slavery, let us now consider its effect upon her moral and\r\nintellectual development.\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.--The number of newspapers and\r\nperiodicals in New York in 1860 was 542, of which 365 were political, 56\r\nreligious, 63 literary, 58 miscellaneous; and the number of copies\r\ncirculated in 1860 was 320,930,884. (Census Tables, Nos. 15, 37.) The\r\nnumber in Virginia was 139; of which 117 were political, 13 religious, 3\r\nliterary, 6 miscellaneous; and the number of copies circulated in 1860\r\nwas 26,772,568. Thus, the annual circulation of the press in New York\r\nwas twelve times as great as that of Virginia. As to periodicals: New\r\nYork had 69 monthlies, of which 2 were political, 25 religious, 24\r\nliterary, and 18 miscellaneous; 10 quarterlies, of which 5 were\r\nreligious, and 5 literary; 6 annuals, of which 2 were political, 2\r\nreligious, and 2 miscellaneous. Virginia had 5 monthlies, of which 1 was\r\npolitical, 2 religious, 1 literary, and 1 miscellaneous; and no\r\nquarterlies or annuals. The annual circulation of the New York monthlies\r\nwas 2,045,000; that of Virginia was 43,900; or more than 43 to 1 in\r\nfavor of New York.\r\n\r\nAs regards schools, colleges, academies, libraries, and churches, I must\r\ntake the Census of 1850, those tables for 1860 not being yet arranged\r\nand printed. The number of public schools in New York in 1850 was\r\n11,580, teachers 13,965, pupils 675,221; colleges, academies, etc.,\r\npupils 52,001; attending school during the year, as returned by\r\nfamilies, 693,329; native adults of the State who cannot read or write,\r\n23,341. Public libraries, 11,013; volumes, 1,760,820. Value of churches\r\n$21,539,561. (Comp. Census, 1850.)\r\n\r\nThe number of public schools in Virginia in 1850 was 2,937, teachers\r\n3,005, pupils 67,438; colleges, academies, etc., pupils 10,326;\r\nattending school during the year, as returned by families, 109,775;\r\nnative white adults of the State who cannot read or write, 75,868.\r\nPublic libraries, 54; volumes, 88,462. Value of churches, $2,902,220.\r\n(Compend. of Census of 1850.) By Table 155, same compend., the\r\npercentage of native free population in Virginia over 20 years of age\r\nwho cannot read or write is 19.90, and in New York 1.87, in North\r\nCarolina 30.34, in Maryland 11.10, in Massachusetts 0.32, or less than\r\none third of one per cent. In New England, the percentage of native\r\nwhites who cannot read or write is 0.42, or less than one half of one\r\nper cent.; and in the Southern States 20.30, or 50 to 1 in favor of New\r\nEngland. (Compend., Table 571.) But, if we take the whole adult\r\npopulation of Virginia, including whites, free blacks, and slaves, 42.05\r\nper cent., or nearly one half, cannot read or write; and in North\r\nCarolina, more than one half cannot read or write. We have seen, by the\r\nabove official tables of the Census of 1850, that New York, compared\r\nwith Virginia, had nearly ten times as many pupils at schools, colleges,\r\nand academies, twenty times as many books in libraries, and largely more\r\nthan seven times the value of churches; while the ratio of native white\r\nadults who cannot read or write was more than 10 to 1 in Virginia,\r\ncompared with New York. We have seen, also, that in North Carolina\r\nnearly one third of the native white adults, and in Virginia nearly one\r\nfifth, cannot read or write, and in New England 1 in every 400, in New\r\nYork 1 in every 131, in the South and Southwest 1 in every 42 of the\r\nnative white adults. (Comp. p. 153.)\r\n\r\nMy next comparison will be that of two great new Western\r\nStates--Illinois, a Free State, and Missouri, slaveholding.\r\n\r\nThe comparison is just, for while Missouri has increased since 1810 in\r\nwealth and population, much more rapidly than any of the Slave States,\r\nthere are several Free States whose relative advance has exceeded that\r\nof Illinois. The rapid growth of Missouri is owing to her immense area,\r\nher fertile soil, her mighty rivers (the Mississippi and Missouri), her\r\ncentral and commanding position, and to the fact that she has so small a\r\nnumber of slaves to the square mile, as well as to the free population.\r\n\r\nThe population of Illinois, in 1810, was 12,282, and in 1860, 1,711,951;\r\nthe ratio of increase from 1810 to 1860 being 13,838.70. (Table 1, Cens.\r\n1860.) The population of Missouri in 1810, was 20,845, and in 1860,\r\n1,182,012; the ratio of increase from 1810 to 1860 being 5,570.48. (Ib.)\r\nThe rank of Missouri in 1810 was 22, and of Illinois 23. The rank of\r\nMissouri in 1860 was 8, and of Illinois, 4.\r\n\r\nAREA.--The area of Missouri is 67,380 square miles, being the\r\n4th in rank, as to area, of all the States. The area of Illinois is\r\n55,405 square miles, ranking the 10th. Missouri, then, has 11,875 more\r\nsquare miles than Illinois. This excess is greater by 749 square miles\r\nthan the aggregate area of Massachusetts, Delaware, and Rhode Island,\r\ncontaining in 1860 a population of 1,517,902. The population of Missouri\r\nper square mile in 1810 exceeded that of Illinois .08; but, in 1860, the\r\npopulation of Missouri per square mile was 17.54, ranking the 22d, and\r\nthat of Illinois, 30.90, ranking the 13th. Illinois, with her ratio to\r\nthe square mile and the area of Missouri, would have had in 1860 a\r\npopulation of 2,082,042; and Missouri, with her ratio and the area of\r\nIllinois, would have had in 1860 a population of 971,803, making a\r\ndifference in favor of Illinois of 1,110,239 instead of 529,939. The\r\nabsolute increase of population of Illinois per square mile from 1850 to\r\n1860 was 15.54, and of Missouri 7.43, Illinois ranking the 6th in this\r\nratio and Missouri the 14th. These facts prove the vast advantages which\r\nMissouri possessed in her larger area as compared with Illinois.\r\n\r\nBut Missouri in 1810, we have seen, had nearly double the population of\r\nIllinois. Now, reversing their numbers in 1810, the ratio of increase of\r\neach remaining the same, the population of Illinois in 1860 would have\r\nbeen 2,905,014, and of Missouri, 696,983. If we bring the greater area\r\nof Missouri as an element into this calculation, the population of\r\nIllinois in 1860 would have exceeded that of Missouri more than two\r\nmillions and a half.\r\n\r\nMINES.--By Census Tables, 9, 10, 13, and 14, Missouri produced,\r\nin 1860, pig iron of the value of $575,000; Illinois, none. Bar and\r\nrolled iron--Missouri, $535,000; Illinois, none. Lead--Missouri,\r\n$356,660; Illinois, $72,953. Coal--Missouri, $8,200; Illinois, $964,187.\r\nCopper--Missouri, $6,000; Illinois, none. As to mines, then, Missouri\r\nhas a decided advantage over Illinois. Indeed, the iron mountains of\r\nMissouri are unsurpassed in the world. That Illinois approaches so near\r\nto Missouri in mineral products, is owing to her railroads and canals,\r\nand not to equal natural advantages. The number of miles of railroad in\r\noperation in 1860 was, 2,868 in Illinois, and 817 in Missouri; of\r\ncanals, Illinois, 102 miles; Missouri, none. (Tables 38, 39.) But if\r\nMissouri had been a Free State, she would have at least equalled\r\nIllinois in internal improvements, and the Pacific Railroad would have\r\nlong since united San Francisco, St. Louis, and Chicago.\r\n\r\nIllinois is increasing in a _progressive_ ratio as compared with\r\nMissouri. Thus, from 1840 to 1850 the increase of numbers in Illinois\r\nwas 78.81, and from 1850 to 1860, 101.01 per cent., while the increase\r\nof Missouri from 1840 to 1850 was 77.75, and from 1850 to 1860, 73.30.\r\nThus, the ratio is augmenting in Illinois, and decreasing in Missouri.\r\nIf Illinois and Missouri should each increase from 1860 to 1870, in the\r\nsame ratio as from 1850 to 1860, Illinois would then number 3,441,448,\r\nand Missouri, 2,048,426. (Table 1.) In 1850, Chicago numbered 29,963,\r\nand in 1860, 109,260. St. Louis, 77,860 in 1850, and 160,773 in 1860.\r\n(Table 40.) From 1840 to 1850 the ratio of increase of Chicago was\r\n570.31, and from 1850 to 1860, 264.65, and of St. Louis, from 1840 to\r\n1850, 372.26 per cent., and from 1850 to 1860, 106.49. If both increased\r\nin their respective ratios from 1860 to 1870 as from 1850 to 1860,\r\nChicago would number 398,420 in 1870, and St. Louis, 331,879. It would\r\nbe difficult to say which city has the greatest natural advantages, and\r\nyet when St. Louis was a city, Chicago was but the site of a fort.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WEALTH.--By Census Table 36, the cash value of the\r\nfarms of Illinois in 1860, was $432,531,072, and of Missouri,\r\n$230,632,126, making a difference in favor of Illinois of $201,898,946,\r\nwhich is the loss which Missouri has sustained by slavery in the single\r\nitem of the value of her farm lands. Abolish slavery there, and the\r\nvalue of the farm lands of Missouri would soon equal those of Illinois,\r\nand augment the wealth of the farmers of Missouri over two hundred\r\nmillions of dollars. But these farm lands of Missouri embrace only\r\n19,984,809 acres (Table 36), leaving unoccupied 23,138,391 acres. The\r\ndifference between the value of the unoccupied lands of Missouri and\r\nIllinois, is six dollars per acre, at which rate the increased value of\r\nthe unoccupied lands of Missouri, in the absence of slavery, is\r\n$148,830,346. Thus it appears, that the loss to Missouri in the value of\r\nher lands, caused by slavery, is $340,729,292. If we add to this the\r\ndiminished value of town and city property in Missouri, from the same\r\ncause, the total loss in that State in the value of real estate, exceeds\r\n$400,000,000, which is nearly twenty times the value of her slaves. By\r\nTable 35, the increase in the value of the real and personal property of\r\nIllinois from 1850 to 1860, was $715,595,276, being 457.93 per cent.,\r\nand of Missouri, $363,966,691, being 265.18 per cent. At the same rate\r\nof increase from 1860 to 1870, the total wealth of Illinois would then\r\nbe $3,993,000,000, and of Missouri, $1,329,000,000, making the\r\ndifference against Missouri, in 1870, caused by slavery, $2,664,000,000,\r\nwhich is more than double the whole debt of the nation, and more than\r\ntwice the value of all the slaves in the Union.\r\n\r\nThe total wealth of the Union in 1860 exceeded $16,000,000,000. If this\r\nwere increased $1,000,000,000 in time, by the augmented wealth of\r\nMissouri, and our revenue from duties and taxes should be $220,000,000,\r\nthe increased income, being one seventeenth of the whole, would exceed\r\n$12,000,000 per annum; or, if the increase of wealth should be only\r\n$200,000,000, then the augmented proportional annual revenue would be\r\n$2,750,000, or nearly one eightieth part of the whole revenue.\r\n\r\nBy overthrowing the rebellion, the taxes to pay the national debt will\r\nbe collected from all the States, instead of being confined to those\r\nthat are loyal. The rebel Confederate debt, never having had any\r\nexistence in law or justice, but having been created only to support a\r\nwicked rebellion, will of course be expunged by the reëstablishment of\r\nthe Union. All the rebel States' debt incurred since the revolt, for the\r\npurpose of overthrowing the Government, will, of course, have no legal\r\nexistence. Under the Federal Constitution, no State Legislature can have\r\nany lawful existence, except in conformity with its provisions,\r\naccompanied by a prior oath of every member to support the Constitution\r\nof the United States. These assemblages, then, since the revolt in the\r\nseveral States, calling themselves State Legislatures, never had any\r\nlegal existence or authority, and were mere assemblages of traitors.\r\nSuch is the clear provision of the Federal Constitution, and of the law\r\nof nations and of justice. It would be strange, indeed, if conventicles\r\nof traitors in revolted States could legally or rightfully impose taxes\r\non the people of such States, loyal or disloyal, to overthrow the\r\nGovernment. Indeed, if justice could have her full sway, the whole debt\r\nof this Government, incurred to suppress this rebellion, ought to be\r\npaid by the traitors alone.\r\n\r\nMy next comparison will be that of the Free State of Pennsylvania with\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nVirginia was a considerable colony when Pennsylvania was occupied only\r\nby Indian tribes. In 1790, Virginia was first in rank of all the States,\r\nher number of inhabitants being 748,308. (Census Rep., 120, 121.)\r\nPennsylvania then ranked the second, numbering 434,373 persons. (Ib.) In\r\n1860 the population of Virginia was 1,596,318, ranking the fifth;\r\nPennsylvania still remaining the second, and numbering 2,905,115. (Ib.)\r\nIn 1790 the population of Virginia exceeded that of Pennsylvania\r\n313,925; in 1860 the excess in favor of Pennsylvania was 1,308,797. The\r\nratio of increase of population of Virginia from 1790 to 1860 was 113.32\r\nper cent., and of Pennsylvania in the same period, 569.03. At the same\r\nrelative ratio of increase for the next seventy years, Virginia would\r\ncontain a population of 3,405,265 in 1930; and Pennsylvania 19,443,934,\r\nexceeding that of England. Such has been and would continue to be the\r\neffect of slavery in retarding the progress of Virginia, and such the\r\ninfluence of freedom in the rapid advance of Pennsylvania. Indeed, with\r\nthe maintenance and perpetuity of the Union in all its integrity, the\r\ndestiny of Pennsylvania will surpass the most sanguine expectations.\r\n\r\nThe population of Virginia per square mile in 1790 was 12.19, and in\r\n1860, 26.02; whilst that of Pennsylvania in 1790 was 9.44, and in 1860,\r\n63.18. (Ib.) The absolute increase of the population of Virginia per\r\nsquare mile, from 1790 to 1860, was 13.83, and from 1850 to 1860, 2.85;\r\nwhilst that of Pennsylvania from 1790 to 1860, was 53.74, and from 1850\r\nto 1860, 12.93. (Ib.)\r\n\r\nAREA.--The area of Virginia is 61,352 square miles, and of\r\nPennsylvania 46,000, the difference being 15,352 square miles, which is\r\ngreater by 758 square miles than the aggregate area of Massachusetts,\r\nConnecticut, and Delaware, containing in 1860 a population of\r\n1,803,429. (Ib.) Retaining their respective ratios of increase per\r\nsquare mile from 1790 to 1860, and reversing their areas, that of\r\nVirginia in 1860 would have been 1,196,920, and of Pennsylvania\r\n3,876,119. Reversing the numbers of each State in 1790, the ratio of\r\nincrease in each remaining the same, the population of Pennsylvania in\r\n1860 would have been 5,408,424, and that of Virginia, 926,603. Reversing\r\nboth the areas and numbers in 1790, and the population of Pennsylvania\r\nwould have exceeded that of Virginia in 1860 more than six millions.\r\n\r\nSHORE LINE.--By the Tables of the Coast Survey, the shore line\r\nof Virginia is 1,571 miles, and of Pennsylvania only 60 miles. This\r\nvastly superior coast line of Virginia, with better, deeper, more\r\ncapacious, and much more numerous harbors, unobstructed by ice, and with\r\neasy access for so many hundred miles by navigable bays and tide-water\r\nrivers leading so far into the interior, gives to Virginia great\r\nadvantages over Pennsylvania in commerce and every branch of industry.\r\nIndeed, in this respect, Virginia stands unrivalled in the Union. The\r\nhydraulic power of Virginia greatly exceeds that of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nMINES.--Pennsylvania excels every other State in mineral\r\nwealth, but Virginia comes next.\r\n\r\nSOIL.--In natural fertility of soil, the two States are about\r\nequal; but the seasons in Virginia are more favorable, both for crops\r\nand stock, than in Pennsylvania. Virginia has all the agricultural\r\nproducts of Pennsylvania, with cotton in addition. The area, however, of\r\nVirginia (39,265,280 acres) being greater by 9,825,280 acres than that\r\nof Pennsylvania (29,440,000 acres), gives to Virginia vast advantages.\r\n\r\nIn her greater area, her far superior coast line, harbors, rivers, and\r\nhydraulic power, her longer and better seasons for crops and stock, and\r\ngreater variety of products, Virginia has vast natural advantages, and\r\nwith nearly double the population of Pennsylvania in 1790. And yet,\r\nwhere has slavery placed Virginia? Pennsylvania exceeds her now in\r\nnumbers 1,308,797, and increased in population from 1790 to 1860, in a\r\nratio more than five to one. Such is the terrible contrast between free\r\nand slave institutions!\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WEALTH.--By Census Tables (1860) 33 and 36, it\r\nappears (omitting commerce) that the products of industry, as given,\r\nviz., of agriculture, manufactures, mines, and fisheries, were that year\r\nin Pennsylvania, of the value of $399,600,000, or $138 _per capita_; and\r\nin Virginia, $120,000,000, or $75 _per capita_. This shows a total value\r\nof product in Pennsylvania much more than three times that of Virginia,\r\nand, _per capita_, nearly two to one. That is, the average value of the\r\nproduct of the labor of each person in Pennsylvania is nearly double\r\nthat of each person, including slaves, in Virginia. Thus is proved the\r\nvast superiority of free over slave labor, and the immense national loss\r\noccasioned by the substitution of the latter for the former.\r\n\r\nAs to the rate of increase: the value of the products of Virginia in\r\n1850 was $84,480,428 (Table 9), and in Pennsylvania, $229,567,131,\r\nshowing an increase in Virginia, from 1850 to 1860, of $35,519,572,\r\nbeing 41 per cent.; and in Pennsylvania, $170,032,869, being 51 per\r\ncent.; exhibiting a difference of 10 per cent. in favor of Pennsylvania.\r\nBy the Census Table of 1860, No. 35, p. 195, the true value then of the\r\nreal and personal property was, in Pennsylvania, $1,416,501,818, and of\r\nVirginia, $793,249,681. Now, we have seen, the value of the products in\r\nPennsylvania in 1860 was $399,600,000, and in Virginia, $120,000,000.\r\nThus, as a question of the annual yield of capital, that of Pennsylvania\r\nwas 29 per cent., and of Virginia, 15 per cent. By Census Table 35, the\r\ntotal value of the real and personal property of Pennsylvania was\r\n$722,486,120 in 1850, and $1,416,501,818 in 1860, showing an increase,\r\nin that decade, of $694,015,698, being 96.05 per cent.; and in Virginia,\r\n$430,701,082 in 1850, and $793,249,681 in 1860, showing an increase of\r\n$362,548,599, or 84.17 per cent.\r\n\r\nBy Table 36, p. 196, Census of 1860, the _cash_ value of the farms of\r\nVirginia was $371,092,211, being $11.91 per acre; and of Pennsylvania,\r\n$662,050,707, being $38.91 per acre. Now, by this table, the number of\r\nacres embraced in these farms of Pennsylvania was 17,012,153 acres, and\r\nin Virginia, 31,014,950; the difference of value per acre being $27, or\r\nlargely more than three to one in favor of Pennsylvania. Now, if we\r\nmultiply the farm lands of Virginia by the Pennsylvania value per acre,\r\nit would make the total value of the farm lands of Virginia\r\n$1,204,791,804; and the _additional_ value, caused by emancipation,\r\n$835,699,593. But the whole area of Virginia is 39,265,280 acres,\r\ndeducting from which the farm lands, there remain unoccupied 8,250,330\r\nacres. Now, if (as would be in the absence of slavery) the population\r\nper square mile of Virginia equalled that of Pennsylvania, three fifths\r\nof these lands would have been occupied as farms, viz. 4,950,198, which,\r\nat the Pennsylvania value per acre, would have been worth $188,207,524.\r\nDeduct from this their present average value of $2 per acre, $9,800,396,\r\nand the remainder, $178,407,128, is the sum by which the unoccupied\r\nlands of Virginia, converted into farms, would have been increased in\r\nvalue by emancipation. Add this to the enhanced value of their present\r\nfarms, and the result is $1,014,106,721 as the gain, on this basis, of\r\nVirginia in the value of her lands, by emancipation. To these we should\r\nadd the increased value of town and city lots and improvements, and of\r\npersonal property, and, with emancipation, Virginia would now have an\r\naugmented wealth of at least one billion and a half of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe earnings of commerce are not given in the Census Tables, which would\r\nvastly increase the difference in the value of their annual products in\r\nfavor of Pennsylvania as compared with Virginia. These earnings include\r\nall not embraced under the heads of agriculture, manufactures, the\r\nmines, and fisheries. Let us examine some of these statistics.\r\n\r\nRAILROADS.--The number of miles of railroad in operation in\r\nPennsylvania in 1860, including city roads, was 2,690.49 miles,[4]\r\ncosting $147,283,410; and in Virginia, 1,771 miles, costing $64,958,807.\r\n(Census Table of 1860, No. 38, pp. 230, 232.) The annual value of the\r\nfreight carried on these roads is estimated at $200,000,000 more in\r\nPennsylvania than in Virginia, and the passenger account would still\r\nmore increase the disparity.\r\n\r\nCANALS.--The number of miles of canals in Pennsylvania in 1860\r\nwas 1,259, and their cost, $42,015,000. In Virginia the number of miles\r\nwas 178, and the cost, $7,817,000. (Census Table 39, p. 238.) The\r\nestimated value of the freight on the Pennsylvania canals is ten times\r\nthat of the freight on the Virginia canals.\r\n\r\nTONNAGE.--The tonnage of vessels built in Pennsylvania in 1860\r\nwas 21,615 tons, and in Virginia, 4,372. (Census, p. 197.)\r\n\r\nBANKS.--The number of banks in Pennsylvania in 1860 was 90;\r\ncapital, $25,565,582; loans, $50,327,127; specie, $8,378,474;\r\ncirculation, $13,132,892; deposits, $26,167,143;--and in Virginia the\r\nnumber was 65; capital, $16,005,156; loans, $24,975,792; specie,\r\n$2,943,652; circulation, $9,812,197; deposits, $7,729,652. (Census Table\r\n35, p. 193.)\r\n\r\nEXPORTS AND IMPORTS, ETC.--Our exports abroad from\r\nPennsylvania, for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1860, and foreign\r\nimports, were of the value of $20,262,608. The clearances, same year,\r\nfrom Pennsylvania, and entries were 336,848 tons. In Virginia the\r\nexports the same year and foreign imports were of the value of\r\n$7,184,273; clearances and entries, 178,143 tons. (Table 14, Register of\r\nU. S. Treasury.) Revenue from customs, same year, in Pennsylvania,\r\n$2,552,924, and in Virginia, $189,816; or more than twelve to one in\r\nfavor of Pennsylvania. (Tables U. S. Commissioner of Customs.) No returns\r\nare given for the coastwise and internal trade of either State; but the\r\nrailway and canal transportation of both States shows a difference of\r\nten to one in favor of Pennsylvania. And yet, Virginia, as we have seen,\r\nhad much greater natural advantages than Pennsylvania for commerce,\r\nforeign and internal, her shore line up to head of tide water being\r\n1,571 miles, and Pennsylvania only 60 miles.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that, exclusive of commerce, the products of Pennsylvania\r\nin 1860 were of the value of $399,600,000, or $138 _per capita_; and in\r\nVirginia, $120,000,000, or $75 _per capita_. But, if we add the earnings\r\nof commerce, the products of Pennsylvania must have exceeded those of\r\nVirginia much more than four to one, and have reached, _per capita_,\r\nnearly three to one. What but slavery could have produced such amazing\r\nresults? Indeed, when we see the same effects in _all_ the Free States\r\nas compared with _all_ the Slave States, and in _any_ of the Slave\r\nStates, as compared with _any_ of the Free States, the uniformity of\r\nresults establishes the law beyond all controversy, that slavery retards\r\nimmensely the progress of wealth and population.\r\n\r\nThat the Tariff has produced none of these results, is shown by the fact\r\nthat the agriculture and commerce of Pennsylvania vastly exceed those of\r\nVirginia, and yet these are the interests supposed to be most\r\ninjuriously affected by high tariffs. But there is still more conclusive\r\nproof. The year 1824 was the commencement of the era of high tariffs,\r\nand yet, from 1790 to 1820, as proved by the Census, the percentage of\r\nincrease of Pennsylvania over Virginia was greater than from 1820 to\r\n1860. Thus, by Table 1 of the Census, p. 124, the increase of population\r\nin Virginia was as follows:\r\n\r\n  From 1790 to 1800  17.63 per cent.\r\n    \"  1800 \"  1810  10.73    \"\r\n    \"  1810 \"  1820   9.31    \"\r\n    \"  1820 \"  1830  13.71    \"\r\n    \"  1830 \"  1840   2.34    \"\r\n    \"  1840 \"  1850  14.60    \"\r\n    \"  1850 \"  1860  12.29    \"\r\n\r\nThe increase of population in Pennsylvania was:\r\n\r\n  From 1790 to 1800  38.67 per cent.\r\n    \"  1800 \"  1810  34.49    \"\r\n    \"  1810 \"  1820  29.55    \"\r\n    \"  1820 \"  1830  28.47    \"\r\n    \"  1830 \"  1840  27.87    \"\r\n    \"  1840 \"  1850  34.09    \"\r\n    \"  1850 \"  1860  25.71    \"\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the population of Virginia was 748,318; in 1820, 1,065,129, and\r\nin 1860, 1,596,318. In 1790 the population of Pennsylvania was 434,373;\r\nin 1820, 1,348,233, and in 1860, 2,906,115. Thus, from 1790 to 1820,\r\nbefore the inauguration of the protective policy, the relative increase\r\nof the population of Pennsylvania, as compared with Virginia, was very\r\nfar greater than from 1820 to 1860. It is quite clear, then, that the\r\ntariff had no influence in depressing the progress of Virginia as\r\ncompared with Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nHaving shown how much the material progress of Virginia has been\r\nretarded by slavery, let us now consider its effect upon her moral and\r\nintellectual development.\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.--The number of newspapers and\r\nperiodicals in Pennsylvania in 1860 was 367, of which 277 were\r\npolitical, 43 religious, 25 literary, 22 miscellaneous; and the total\r\nnumber of copies circulated in 1860 was 116,094,480. (Census Tables,\r\nNos. 15, 37.) The number in Virginia was 139, of which 117 were\r\npolitical, 13 religious, 3 literary, 6 miscellaneous; and the number of\r\ncopies circulated in 1860 was 26,772,568, being much less than one\r\nfourth that of Pennsylvania. The number of copies of monthly periodicals\r\ncirculated in Pennsylvania in 1860 was 464,684; and in Virginia, 43,900:\r\nor much more than ten to one in favor of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nAs regards schools, colleges, academies, libraries, and churches, I must\r\ntake the Census of 1850, those tables for 1860 not being yet arranged or\r\nprinted. The number of public schools in Pennsylvania in 1850 was 9,061;\r\nteachers, 10,024; pupils, 413,706; colleges, academies, &c., pupils,\r\n26,142; attending school during the year, as returned by families,\r\n504,610; native adults of the State who cannot read or write, 51,283;\r\npublic libraries, 393; volumes, 363,400; value of churches, $11,853,291;\r\npercentage of native free population (adults) who cannot read or write,\r\n4.56. (Comp. Census of 1850.)\r\n\r\nThe number of public schools in Virginia in 1850 was 2,937; teachers,\r\n3,005; pupils, 67,438; colleges, academies, etc., pupils, 10,326;\r\nattending school, as returned by families, 109,775; native white adults\r\nof the State who cannot read or write, 75,868; public libraries, 54;\r\nvolumes, 88,462; value of churches, $2,902,220; percentage of native\r\nfree adults of Virginia who cannot read or write, 19.90. (Comp. Census\r\nof 1850.) Thus, the church and educational statistics of Pennsylvania,\r\nand especially of free adults who cannot read or write, is as five to\r\none nearly in favor of Pennsylvania. When we recollect that nearly one\r\nthird of the population of Pennsylvania are of the great German race and\r\nspeak the noble German language, to which they are greatly attached, and\r\nhence the difficulty of introducing common _English_ public schools in\r\nthe State, the advantage, in this respect, of Pennsylvania over Virginia\r\nis most extraordinary.\r\n\r\nMy last comparison will be that of our two smallest States--Rhode\r\nIsland, a Free State, and Delaware, slaveholding.\r\n\r\nIn 1790 the population of Rhode Island was 69,110, and that of Delaware\r\n59,096. In 1860, the former numbered 174,620, the latter 112,216. Thus,\r\nfrom 1790 to 1860, the ratio of increase of population of Rhode Island\r\nwas 152.67 per cent., and of Delaware, 89.88. At the same relative rate\r\nof increase, for the next, as for the last seventy years, the population\r\nof Rhode Island in 1930, would be 441,212, and of Delaware, 213,074.\r\nThus in 1790, Rhode Island numbered but 10,014 more than Delaware,\r\n62,404 more in 1860, and, at the same ratio of increase, 228,138 more in\r\n1930. Such has been and would be the effect of slavery in retarding the\r\nincrease of Delaware, as compared with Rhode Island. (Census Table,\r\n1860, No. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe population of Rhode Island per square mile in 1790, was 52.15, and\r\nin 1860, 133.71; that of Delaware, 27.87 in 1790, and 59.93 in 1860. The\r\nabsolute increase of population of Rhode Island, per square mile, from\r\n1790 to 1860, was 80.79, and from 1850 to 1860, 20.74; that of Delaware,\r\nfrom 1790 to 1860, was 25.05, and from 1850 to 1860, 9.76. (Ib.)\r\n\r\nAREA.--The area of Rhode Island is 1,306 square miles, and of\r\nDelaware, 2,120, being 38 per cent., or much more than one third larger\r\nthan Rhode Island. Retaining their respective ratios of increase, per\r\nsquare mile, from 1790 to 1860, and reversing their areas, the\r\npopulation of Rhode Island in 1860, would have been 283,465, and of\r\nDelaware, 78,268.\r\n\r\nIn natural fertility of soil Delaware is far superior to Rhode Island,\r\nthe seasons much more favorable for crops and stock, and with more than\r\ndouble the number of acres of arable land.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF WEALTH.--By Census Tables 33 and 36 (omitting\r\ncommerce), it appears that the products of industry as given, viz., of\r\nagriculture, manufactures, mines, and fisheries, were that year, in\r\nRhode Island, of the value of $52,400,000, or $300 _per capita_, and in\r\nDelaware, $16,100,000, or $143 _per capita_. That is, the average\r\nannual value of the product of the labor of each person in Rhode Island\r\nis greatly more than double that of the labor of each person in\r\nDelaware, including slaves. This, we have seen, would make the value of\r\nthe products of labor in Rhode Island in 1930, $132,368,600, and in\r\nDelaware, only $30,469,582, notwithstanding the far greater area and\r\nsuperior natural advantages of Delaware as compared with Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nAs to the rate of increase: the value of the products of Delaware in\r\n1850 was $7,804,992, in 1860, $16,100,000; and in Rhode Island, in 1850,\r\n$24,288,088, and in 1860, $52,400,000. (Table 9, Treas. Rep., 1856),\r\nexhibiting a large difference in the ratio in favor of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nBy Table 36, p. 196, Census of 1860, the cash value of the farm lands of\r\nRhode Island in 1860 was $19,385,573, or $37.30 per acre (519,698\r\nacres), and of Delaware, $31,426,357, or $31.39 per acre (1,004,295\r\nacres). Thus, if the farm lands of Delaware were of the cash value of\r\nthose of Rhode Island per acre, it would increase the value of those of\r\nDelaware $5,935,385, whereas the whole value of her slaves is but\r\n$539,400.\r\n\r\nBut by Table 35, Census of 1860, the total value of the real and\r\npersonal property in Rhode Island in 1860, was $135,337,588, and of\r\nDelaware, $46,242,181, making a difference in favor of Rhode Island,\r\n$89,095,497, whereas, we have seen, in the absence of slavery, Delaware\r\nmust have far exceeded Rhode Island in wealth and population.\r\n\r\nThe earnings of commerce are not given by the Census, but, to how vast\r\nan extent this would swell the difference in favor of Rhode Island, we\r\nmay learn from the Census, Bank Table No. 34. The number of the banks of\r\nRhode Island in 1860, was 91; capital, $20,865,569; loans, $26,719,877;\r\ncirculation, $3,558,295; deposits, $3,553,104. In Delaware, number of\r\nbanks, 12, capital, $1,640,675; loans, $3,150,215; circulation,\r\n$1,135,772; deposits, $976,223.\r\n\r\nHaving shown how much slavery has retarded the material progress of\r\nDelaware, let us now consider its effect upon her moral and intellectual\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nNEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS.--The number of newspapers and\r\nperiodicals in Rhode Island in 1860, was 26, of which 18 were political,\r\n6 literary, and 2 miscellaneous. (Census, Table No. 37.) The number in\r\nDelaware was 14, of which 13 were political, and 1 literary. Of\r\nperiodicals, Delaware had none; Rhode Island 1. The number of copies of\r\nnewspapers and periodicals issued in Rhode Island in 1860 was 5,289,280,\r\nand in Delaware only 1,010,776, or largely more than five to one in\r\nfavor of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nAs regards schools, colleges, academies, libraries, and churches, I must\r\ntake the Census of 1850, those tables for 1860 not being yet arranged or\r\npublished. The number of public schools in Rhode Island in 1850 was 426,\r\nteachers 518, pupils 23,130; attending school during the year, as\r\nreturned by families, whites, 28,359; native adults of the State who\r\ncannot read or write, 1,248; public libraries, 96; volumes, 104,342;\r\nvalue of churches, $1,293,600; percentage of native free adults who\r\ncannot read or write, 149. Colleges and academies, pupils, 3,664. (Comp.\r\nCensus of 1850.) The number of public schools in Delaware in 1850, was\r\n194, teachers, 214, pupils, 8,970; attending school during the year,\r\nwhites, as returned by families, 14,216; native free adults of the State\r\nwho cannot read or write, 9,777; public libraries, 17; volumes, 17,950;\r\nvalue of churches, $340,345; percentage of native free adults who cannot\r\nread or write, 23.03; colleges and academies, pupils, 764. (Comp.\r\nCensus, 1850.)\r\n\r\nThe subject will be continued in my next letter. R. J. WALKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n_PART THE LAST._\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life! Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--GOETHE.\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished\r\n     or intended.'--WEBSTER'S _Dictionary_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks after Hiram's interview with Dr. Ephraim Peters, he had\r\noccasion to spend a long evening in company with certain influential\r\nmembers (of which he, of course, was the most influential) of St.\r\nJude's.\r\n\r\nIt was past eleven o'clock when the meeting broke up. It was a clear,\r\ncold, December night, and Hiram buttoned his coat quite to his chin as\r\nhe descended the steps to commence his walk home. Some had carriages in\r\nwaiting; but he, fully alive to his brother's advice, preferred to go on\r\nfoot. One gentleman kept him company for a couple of blocks; after that,\r\nhe proceeded alone.\r\n\r\nAs he passed the corner of a street which ran at right angles to the one\r\nhe was pursuing, a man came suddenly upon him, and, standing square in\r\nhis path, demanded in a savage tone, 'Do you want your wood split?'\r\n\r\nHiram turned quickly aside, to avoid the questioner; but he had time to\r\nobserve that he was an athletic man, with a limping gait, and a fierce,\r\ndemoniacal countenance. He carried in his hand something like a\r\nbutcher's cleaver; and before Hiram could escape, he repeated the\r\nquestion: 'Do you want your wood split?'\r\n\r\nHiram uttered a hasty 'No,' in response, and walked swiftly forward.\r\n\r\nThe stranger was not to be so easily disposed of. He put himself before\r\nthe millionnaire a second time, and repeated his question.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker was not a coward--that is, so far as his brain served him;\r\nand we all know he had enough of that.\r\n\r\nFinding he was not to get rid of the unknown so readily, he stopped and\r\nregarded him with careful scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThe other repeated his question still again: 'Do you want your wood\r\nsplit?'\r\n\r\nHiram was not slow to perceive that the man was insane, and he\r\nendeavored to humor him.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he said, 'I want my wood split very much indeed. It is too late\r\nto-night; but come to my house to-morrow, and you shall have the job.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no, no, no!' cried the other, 'I work only by night--only by\r\nnight--and I cannot go to your house--you must come to mine!'\r\n\r\nHe laid hold of Hiram's arm with a tenacious grasp.\r\n\r\n'I must first go home,' said Hiram, calmly, 'and send my wood round for\r\nyou to split.'\r\n\r\n'Not so, not so,' retorted the maniac. 'It has already been sent. Come\r\nand see!'--and he began pulling at Hiram's arm--not with ferocity, but\r\nwith a doggedness almost worse.\r\n\r\nHiram looked up and down the street. Not a soul was visible. The\r\ncreature who stopped his way was a powerful man--was armed with a deadly\r\nweapon--was mad.\r\n\r\nHiram came swiftly to a conclusion. He would appear to yield, and in the\r\nwalk he was about to take it was almost a certainty that they would\r\nencounter some one. So he replied, in a good-natured manner: 'Well, if\r\nthe wood has been sent to you, we had better go and have it split at\r\nonce.'\r\n\r\n'That's the talk--that's the talk! But we must hurry. Come on--come\r\nquick, and you will see how I will do it up.'\r\n\r\nHe did not relax his hold of Hiram's arm. The two walked rapidly\r\nforward--much more rapidly than Hiram desired; but the crazy man kept\r\nexclaiming: 'We must make haste, I promised _him_ I would not leave the\r\nroom. No more would I; but you see, if I can earn the money, I am all\r\nright--all right--all right!'\r\n\r\n'How much have _you_ got?' he asked, stopping abruptly, and turning\r\nsuddenly on Hiram.\r\n\r\n'I have got ever so much. Now I think of it, suppose I pay you on the\r\nspot, so that you can go ahead and split the wood? It is getting late,\r\nyou see.'\r\n\r\n'That won't do--that won't do. I want _him_ to have the money!\r\nCome--come along, and give it to him.'\r\n\r\nOn they pressed, till at length the man exclaimed: 'Here we are! Don't\r\nyou perceive?'\r\n\r\nHe had stopped before an old and very common-looking house. In the\r\nsecond story one could see a light burning. The madman motioned Hiram to\r\nenter. The millionnaire was glad to discover that he was so near the end\r\nof his journey, and in a perfectly respectable neighborhood. Not\r\ndoubting that he would find the apartment occupied, and quite sure there\r\nwere inhabitants in the other part of the house, he proceeded to mount\r\nthe stairs with alacrity, his companion following close at his heels.\r\n\r\nIt was with a sense of quiet relief that Hiram opened the door into a\r\nwell-lighted room. This feeling was suddenly changed to one of horror on\r\nascertaining that there was no one in the apartment, but that on a bed\r\nat the farther end of it was extended the corpse of a woman, already\r\nlaid out and ready for the coffin! He stepped quickly backward, but it\r\nwas too late. The madman was close behind him, and egress was out of the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n'Come,' he said, 'you need not be afraid; she won't hurt you.'\r\n\r\nThe poor creature walked to the bedside, and it seemed as if sanity was\r\nvainly struggling to regain its place.\r\n\r\n'Come closer,' he exclaimed to Hiram, who was standing near him.\r\n\r\nHiram advanced at the word of command, and the other again took his arm;\r\nand both stood very still, looking at the dead woman.\r\n\r\n'Had we better wake her, think you?'\r\n\r\nHiram shook his head.\r\n\r\n'You are right. I must first earn the money--earn the money. Then--then\r\nI will wake her. Yes, then I will wake her.'\r\n\r\n'Is it your wife?' demanded Hiram, timidly, impelled by an irresistible\r\nimpulse to ask the question.\r\n\r\n'Wife!' shouted the other, glaring on Hiram--'wife! who talks to me\r\nabout wife? Do you? Say quick!--do you?'--and he raised the cleaver in a\r\nmenacing manner.\r\n\r\n'It was not I,' said Hiram, with as much calmness as he could command,\r\nwhile he looked at the other fixedly--'it was not I.'\r\n\r\n'Glad to hear you say so. If it had been, I would have made kindling\r\nwood of you--yes, kindling wood of you!--That's all got along with,' he\r\nadded, lowering the cleaver. 'Now take a seat.'\r\n\r\nThe madman sat down on one side of a small table, and motioned Hiram to\r\noccupy the chair opposite.\r\n\r\nHe did so.\r\n\r\n'Now we are comfortable. Don't you think so? Shan't have to move, shall\r\nwe? Old Meeker, d----n his soul!--don't own this house. Come, let's have\r\na gay old time!'--and he commenced, half shouting, half singing:\r\n\r\n  'Ain't I glad to get out of the wilderness--\r\n      To get out of the wilderness,\r\n      To get out of the wilderness?--\r\n  Ain't I glad to get out of the wilderness?\r\n             Hip, hip, hurrah!'\r\n\r\nHiram sat pale, but not trembling. He knew his very life depended on his\r\ncomposure, and he believed that the noise which the madman was making\r\nwould soon bring persons to the spot.\r\n\r\n'You don't seem to like my little song,' he exclaimed, 'I will give you\r\nanother.' And he shouted on:\r\n\r\n  'I wish I was a horse, as big as any elephant--\r\n      As big as any elephant,\r\n      As big as any elephant--\r\n  I wish I was a horse, as big as any elephant--\r\n         Hip, hip, hurrah!'\r\n\r\n'That's better, ain't it?' Suddenly he turned and looked at the corpse.\r\n\r\n'Wife--wife! who said 'wife' to me?--who said 'wife' to me?' And he\r\nburst forth more furiously than ever:\r\n\r\n  'My wife's dead, and I want another one--\r\n      And I want another one,\r\n      And I want another one--\r\n  My wife's dead, and I want another one--\r\n         Hip, hip, hurrah!'\r\n\r\nThe man had now become so much excited, that he commenced walking\r\nrapidly around the room, brandishing his weapon in a most reckless\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nHiram's situation was becoming critical. He did not lose his\r\nself-possession, but began to balance the chances of attempting to\r\nescape by moving swiftly to the door, against keeping his seat and\r\nclosely watching the maniac.\r\n\r\nAs if divining what was passing in his mind, the madman suddenly placed\r\nhis back to the door, as if to bar any egress, and commenced singing\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nRelief came at last.\r\n\r\nHiram, whose every sense was on the alert, thought he saw the knob of\r\nthe door turn. He was not mistaken; for now it commenced partially to\r\nopen.\r\n\r\nThe maniac, feeling the pressure, turned about, leaving the entrance\r\nfree--and Dr. Ephraim Peters entered.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to take in matters at a glance. Addressing the madman in a\r\ncalm but commanding tone, he said: 'How is it that you have disobeyed\r\nme? I shall not trust you again. Sit down.'\r\n\r\nThe effect was electrical. An entire change came over the countenance\r\nand bearing of the maniac; he dropped the cleaver, and, passing to the\r\nother side of the room, took a seat in close proximity to the corpse.\r\n\r\nThen turning, the young doctor addressed Hiram: 'Is your presence here\r\nforced or voluntary?'\r\n\r\n'Purely accidental.'\r\n\r\n'I supposed so. A word with you outside.'\r\n\r\nTo Hiram this was a joyful summons, and he responded with alacrity.\r\n\r\nAs they went out, the doctor closed the door, and the two stood together\r\nin the gloomy hall at the top of the staircase.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Meeker, you recognize me, doubtless?'\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\n'I am Dr. Peters, who called to see you about two weeks ago, on behalf\r\nof a poor woman whose dead body is now in that room. I told you, if she\r\nhad to be moved, it would kill her. Your agent drove her out, and she\r\nlies here dead! It has made her husband crazy--a temporary lunacy, I\r\ntrust--but, whatever it is, there you see the whole.\r\n\r\n'I am expecting some persons every moment,' he continued, 'who will\r\nremain here all night, and I will detain you no longer.'\r\n\r\nThe doctor spoke in such a tone of quiet dignity, that it was impossible\r\nfor Hiram to reply. He fumbled for a moment in his coat, and then drew\r\nout his pocket book. Producing several bills, he offered them to the\r\ndoctor, muttering half inaudibly something about his desire to pay\r\nfuneral expenses.\r\n\r\nThe young physician drew back, as if in danger of contamination.\r\n\r\n'Your money perish with you!' he said, solemnly. 'Think you charity\r\nconsists in bank notes?'\r\n\r\nThe doctor turned and reëntered the chamber; and Hiram Meeker proceeded\r\nslowly down the stairs and into the street.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts, as he walked homeward, were not of an enviable nature. I\r\nconfess I have no desire to attempt to portray them.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nHiram's slumbers that night were much disturbed.\r\n\r\nHis rest was broken by strange dreams, frightful or preposterous, which,\r\nrunning into each other, became blended in a confused mass of floating\r\nfancies.\r\n\r\nAt last he woke. He opened big eyes. It was perfectly dark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized just what he was. No business--no money--no\r\nearth--no foothold--nothing but a naked soul.\r\n\r\nHiram lay breathing with slow respirations. Even his piety was not\r\npresent to support him. The world was swept from under him.\r\n\r\nThen came a stern sense--a patent conviction--of all he had counted on:\r\nnothing--nothing!\r\n\r\nHe turned over, and fell asleep again. But still refreshing slumber was\r\ndenied him; still were the night visions terrifying.\r\n\r\nAt last these appeared to take a definite shape. Heaving, working,\r\nrevolving, the chaotic mass assumed form and grew luminous.\r\n\r\nAll of a sudden, IT changed to one great, bright, burning\r\n_eye_. Then _he_ was the eye--all eye--nothing but eye! What sights were\r\npresented! The eye was gifted with a wonderful vision. It could discern\r\ntrue from false--real from counterfeit--what was genuine from sham and\r\npretence.\r\n\r\nMore than this. The _eye_--which was Hiram--could discriminate between\r\nwhat men considered valuable and available and important, and also good\r\nand essential, and by all means to be secured: I say, the _eye_ had the\r\npower to distinguish between these, and what was in truth and in very\r\ndeed good and just and right, and truly to be desired and sought after.\r\n\r\nHow things changed places!\r\n\r\nSome shrank into littleness and utter insignificance, which formerly had\r\nlarge proportions and a towering importance; others, which before seemed\r\npuny and of little worth, grew grandly into magnitude, and power, and\r\nmight.\r\n\r\nAt a great distance could be observed the habitations of the children of\r\nmen. They appeared like objects seen through an inverted telescope--far\r\noff and exceedingly diminished.\r\n\r\nOn the shore of the sea, Hiram Meeker was discovered.\r\n\r\nHe looked no larger than a man's thumb. He had fenced off a portion of\r\nthe sands, so that no one except himself (and many attempted) could have\r\naccess thereto. He was engaged transporting these sands in the most\r\ncareful manner, one by one, into a large warehouse, for better security,\r\nas it would seem.\r\n\r\nWhat is wonderful in all this is, that Hiram, the whole time, thought it\r\ngold he was storing, whereas the _eye_ could perceive it to be sand\r\nonly--glittering sand.\r\n\r\nAt length the vision faded away. Hiram started up in a mortal agony. The\r\neffort woke him, and he gazed wildly around. It was not yet light. Weary\r\nand exhausted by what he had passed through, he soon fell asleep, and\r\nthis time slumbered peacefully.\r\n\r\nWhen he opened his eyes, the sun was shining cheerfully into his room.\r\nThe whole aspect of things was changed. The old scenes were shifted into\r\nplace, the old machinery set in motion--Hiram was himself again!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nBurnsville!\r\n\r\nI hope the reader is willing to revisit this charming spot. For I\r\nconfess that I myself feel impelled to do so. Indeed, I sometimes regret\r\nfollowing the fortunes of Hiram Meeker to New York. Far more agreeable\r\nwould it have been to have continued the story of Joel Burns, and showed\r\nwhat a good man may achieve, notwithstanding the workings of the\r\n'ancient leaven,' and the divers contests which spring up daily within\r\nand around him.\r\n\r\nBut my task once undertaken, I did not feel at liberty to leave it.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, only a brief visit to the place which the reader\r\nmay recollect was commenced by Joel Burns in his youth, when his love\r\nfor Ellen Bellows lent to his already energetic spirit a tenfold force\r\nand vigor and perseverance.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-five years which have told with such effect on New York, have\r\nalso produced great changes and great improvements in Burnsville. It was\r\na thriving village when we last knew it. Now it is a large town. The\r\nhigher portion is covered with fine buildings. Churches, hotels,\r\nacademies, and various institutions for which New England is remarkable,\r\nseem specially to flourish here.\r\n\r\nThere are some old landmarks which I am sure we shall recognize--Joel\r\nBurns's house, for example, and the little brick 'office' from which\r\nHiram sallied one morning before daylight to take the stage for New\r\nYork, to attack Joslin the paper dealer.\r\n\r\nThe improvements have been astonishing. Beautiful trees skirt the\r\nprincipal streets, and form an arch above. Everywhere you behold\r\ndisplayed signs of admirable taste.\r\n\r\nBelow, in the valley, is the railroad; and opposite the 'paper mill' has\r\nbeen erected one of the finest 'stations' in the State. Here has sprung\r\nup a large manufacturing place, rivalling in size and business\r\nimportance the 'ridge,' as we used to call it, but leaving the latter\r\nfree from the noise and bustle of the mills and factories and machinery\r\nof our now famous 'Slab City.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Egerton married Sarah Burns, as you have long since guessed. He is\r\none of the few men of talent who has no ambition to quit his happy home\r\nto adventure in a large city. He is celebrated far and near, but nothing\r\ncan draw him away from the spot where a youth he came to watch over a\r\nyoung girl whose life was trembling in the balance.\r\n\r\nAnd Sarah, think you she is not repaid for her fidelity to her father?\r\nBy it she escaped the grasp of Hiram Meeker, and is now--she has been\r\nfor years--a loving, trustful, joyous wife.\r\n\r\nHappy Sarah Burns! I commenced this narrative by recounting an _un_happy\r\nincident in your life. How grateful is the task of recording your\r\ntriumph over the greatest danger which can threaten a maiden--the danger\r\nof _loving unworthily_!\r\n\r\nJoel Burns! I confess that, of all at Burnsville, it is in you my\r\nfeelings of interest centre--you, whose romantic fidelity to your wife's\r\nmemory has thrown a charm over your whole existence. It is a great\r\ntreasure--is it not?--a heart so true, so loyal, so pure and faithful,\r\nthat not one, no, not one of all the young and fair and good and\r\nfascinating from out this world's fair creation can divert it for a\r\nmoment, or change its even, constant, ever-loving pulsations. Such a\r\nheart you possess, Joel Burns!\r\n\r\nJoel Burns was 'mated' as well as 'married;' and when his wife died, he\r\ndid not really lose her. In spirit she attended him wherever he\r\nwent--always near him--more actually present, Joel used sometimes to\r\nthink, than she ever was before.\r\n\r\nHow could he wish to marry again, when his wife was all the time by his\r\nside--an ever-present, ever-abiding comfort and consolation?\r\n\r\nI say, herein lay the charm and the glory of Joel's life. His influence\r\non his place, after it grew beyond the proportions of a village, and\r\nbecame one of the largest towns in the State, was just as great as when\r\nit had but a dozen buildings.\r\n\r\nJoel did not permit the desire to accumulate to become a passion. On the\r\ncontrary, he diffused his wealth--not by direct gifts in charity, but by\r\naffording everybody around him opportunity to get on and prosper, just\r\nexactly as if the world was common to all, and as if all should be\r\nallowed a fair chance to live in it!\r\n\r\nYou have no idea how the attempt to practise this principle enriched the\r\nlife and nature of Joel Burns.\r\n\r\n[There are two Spirits--towering, gigantic Genii--who attend on man: one\r\nthe Absorbing, the other the Imparting, Spirit. Both are active,\r\nenergetic, untiring. The former, if it gains access to the soul,\r\ncommences at once to narrow and impoverish it; while the latter enlarges\r\nand makes the soul rich. Herein is explained the old enigma which a\r\ndying man is said to have uttered:\r\n\r\n  'What I kept, I've not;\r\n  What I gave, I've got.']\r\n\r\nI have remarked that Burnsville was one of the largest towns in the\r\nState. This was not only the case, but the immense manufactories in\r\n'Slab City' made it much more prominent than any other, and brought it\r\ninto more direct communication with New York.\r\n\r\nHiram Meeker heard, from time to time, of all that Joel was doing. In\r\nfact, impelled by a strong impulse, he took pains to ascertain what\r\nprogress he made from year to year. But Hiram could not, with all his\r\npenetration, fathom a nature like that of Joel. It was always a puzzle\r\nto him. For it was not given to a man, who had all his life harbored the\r\nwicked Demon _Absorption_, to understand the excellency and happiness of\r\nsuch a life.\r\n\r\nBut he watched Burnsville. Indeed, he was tempted to make some heavy\r\ninvestments there when the railroad was constructed--of which event, as\r\nthe leading capitalist of the country, he had the earliest information.\r\nHe abandoned the idea, however, for he shrank from coming in contact\r\nwith his old employer.\r\n\r\nSo Joel Burns lived on his noble, God-given existence.\r\n\r\nBut, reader, if you think I am endeavoring to depict a faultless person,\r\nyou are much mistaken. Faultless is lifeless, when applied to human\r\nbeings. It is in the contest with our faults that the glory of our\r\nhumanity shines forth. It is this which binds our race together in one\r\ngreat brotherhood. Pray, tell me what we could do with a faultless man\r\nor woman. What have we in common with any such person? What sympathy\r\nhave we with either, or either with us?\r\n\r\nJoel Burns was constitutionally ardent and energetic, not to say\r\nimpetuous. With such characteristics are always strong attending\r\nimperfections. He had his share of these. But his motives were honest,\r\nhis principles right, his intents true; and I declare I think it to be a\r\nreal felicity and blessing to observe the faults of such a man, and\r\nwitness how he encounters and battles with, and conquers them--or if for\r\na moment overcome, to behold his genuine regret and contrition.\r\n\r\nI will pursue this no further. I have some work to do in the metropolis.\r\nIf I linger at Burnsville, I shall be quite unfitted for it--I shall,\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJoel--Joel Burns--farewell!\r\n\r\nEllen Bellows--Ellen Burns--don't you see that Joel has remembered your\r\ndying injunction, and has tried to 'live right?' Yes, you do. It was for\r\nthis that you have never forsaken him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSarah Egerton smiles on me as I pass out of the gate. A group of\r\nchildren, half grown, and full grown, give me joyous greeting; and the\r\nDoctor waves his hand from his carriage, as he drives along on his\r\nerrands of mercy and benevolence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must make haste. There is no stage to wait five minutes for me. The\r\ntime table is a despot.\r\n\r\nThe train approaches. It has stopped. It is off again, and I am in it.\r\n\r\nBurnsville, pleasant Burnsville, adieu!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nThe _dénouement_ happened in this way:\r\n\r\nThere was to be a large party at Mrs. Caruther's, a married daughter of\r\nMrs. Bennett. The Bennetts and the Meekers, by the way, always kept up\r\ntheir intimacy. Mr. Bennett is dead. He died the year he was seventy,\r\nleaving a large fortune. The widow lives in the old house, and the\r\nchildren are married, and are bringing out _their_ children now.\r\n\r\nI say, Mrs. Caruthers was to give a large party. Mrs. Meeker, who\r\ninvariably attended her daughter, could not go. Belle must not go alone.\r\nShe arranged, so she said, to drive early in the evening to Mrs.\r\nCaruther's, and to stay there all night.\r\n\r\nFor two or three weeks previous, Belle, under the inspiration of Signor\r\nBarbone, who now exercised a complete control over her, had been making,\r\nquietly but very efficiently, her arrangements for quitting her father's\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nBy degrees, and with an amazing display of secretiveness, she managed to\r\nconvey out of the house all that she might require for a considerable\r\nabsence.\r\n\r\nHer jewels were not lost sight of, nor anything else of value. The\r\nSignor had provided proper receptacles for all these articles--indeed,\r\nhad greatly aided the young lady in the selection of what to take. More\r\nthan this--Signor Barbone (_proh pudor!_) had suggested that she should\r\nfortify herself with such sums of money as she might be able to get\r\ntogether without exciting suspicion.\r\n\r\nStrange as you may think, Belle was possessed of so little delicacy,\r\nthat she actually entered into the spirit of the enterprise--regarding\r\nthe affair as a capital joke, enabling her to hold out against papa\r\nshould he prove obstinate, as he might for a few days (it could only be\r\nfor a few days), and inclined to be severe.\r\n\r\nWhat with all her jewels, including some recent expensive purchases,\r\nmade for the first time in her life without payment on the spot (this\r\nalso at the suggestion of the Signor), and with sums quietly got\r\ntogether for several weeks, including some considerable amounts coaxed\r\nfrom her father on various pretences, and a pretty large sum borrowed\r\nover night from mamma--I say, with all this, the 'happy pair' were\r\npretty well fortified for their first campaign.\r\n\r\nThe trying moment arrived.\r\n\r\nMrs. Caruthers, of course, knew nothing of Belle's tale to her mother,\r\nthat she was to pass the night at her house. She simply expected Belle\r\nto grace her party.\r\n\r\nQuite early in the day the young lady ordered a handsome ball dress\r\nplaced in a box, and directed it to be taken to her dressmaker, to\r\nreceive some trifling alterations before evening. She would call in good\r\nseason there, so she told her mother, and order it sent to Mrs.\r\nCaruthers's.\r\n\r\nThen, waiting for Mrs. Meeker, to take her morning drive, she went to\r\nher room and hurried on a travelling dress.\r\n\r\nShe was going down stairs, when Harriet's nurse opened the door of her\r\nyoung mistress's apartment, and asked her to step a moment into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nBelle turned with all the composure she could muster; she curbed her\r\nimpatience, and looked amiable.\r\n\r\n'Oh, are you going out, Belle?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear; you know I am to be early at Mrs. Caruthers's. Mamma can't\r\ngo with me--so I am to stay all night.'\r\n\r\n'Why, you have on your travelling dress!'\r\n\r\n'It looks odd, doesn't it I--I have sent my ball dress to Laroche, to be\r\naltered a little; and I have to call there now, and I want her to see me\r\nin this. Do you know, I don't think she has fitted me well at all?'\r\n\r\n'It seems to me quite perfect.'\r\n\r\n'Hatty, dear, did you want me?'\r\n\r\nThis she said still standing, as if in haste to go.\r\n\r\n'Oh, no. I thought you were going into the parlor, and I was about to\r\nask you to sit with me a little while. I have something to say to you\r\nabout Gus. I want you to talk to papa. You know papa will listen to\r\n_you_. Tell him--never mind, dear, to-morrow will do as well--I hope you\r\nwill have a pleasant evening.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you, dear. Good-by.'\r\n\r\nShe turned and opened the door.\r\n\r\nBy a sort of instinctive tenderness not denied to any human creature,\r\nBelle paused and looked back, and, hesitating a moment, returned; going\r\nto where her sister was reclining, she kissed her affectionately,\r\nwithout speaking one word.\r\n\r\nHarriet's eyes suffused; she was quite unused to such a demonstration.\r\n\r\n'My darling sister,' she whispered.\r\n\r\nBelle was already out of the room. She bounded down the staircase,\r\npassed hastily through the hall, and was soon walking rapidly along the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nOne hour from that time she was on her way to New Jersey.\r\n\r\nA clergyman had been provided in that State to perform the marriage\r\nceremony.\r\n\r\nWhen the six o'clock New York train for Philadelphia passed through\r\nNewark, it received on board Mr. and Mrs. Filippo Barbone, who were just\r\nstarting on their wedding excursion.\r\n\r\nIt was the commencement of the honeymoon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo wonder, the next day, that Belle is late. We who are in the secret\r\nwill not be astonished; neither does Mrs. Meeker think it at all strange\r\nthat Belle should not return in the morning after the excitement of a\r\ngrand evening display such as Mrs. Caruthers will be sure to have.\r\n\r\nThe day wears on. As the dinner hour approaches, Mrs. Meeker decides to\r\nsend the carriage for her.\r\n\r\nThe coachman soon drives up before Mrs. Caruthers's; and the footman,\r\ndescending, announces simply that he has called for Miss Belle. The\r\nanswer which is brought to him is, that Miss Belle is not in the house.\r\nHe returns and reports accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlthough this little incident is very annoying to Mrs. Meeker, still she\r\nhas no other idea than that Belle has stopped to make some call or do\r\nsome shopping on her way home.\r\n\r\nHad she considered a moment, she would have perceived how unreasonable\r\nwas such a supposition. But, as Mrs. Meeker could not have the slightest\r\nsuspicion of the truth, she was forced to imagine something.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of her perplexity, Hiram entered. He was so accustomed, and\r\nespecially of late, to his daughter's greeting at the door, that he\r\nmissed these affectionate tokens of her presence when he entered the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n'Where is Belle?' he said, as he came into the parlor.\r\n\r\n'Belle has not returned yet from Mrs. Caruthers's. It is rather strange.\r\nI have just sent the carriage for her. Wakeman brings back word that she\r\nis not there.'\r\n\r\n'Wakeman is an idiot!' exclaimed Hiram, with a degree of temper so\r\nunusual, that Mrs. Meeker started--'an idiot! I dare say he did not make\r\nhis message intelligible.'\r\n\r\nNow, 'Wakeman' was Mrs. Meeker's private servant--a family servant, she\r\nwas pleased to say; thereby meaning, not that he had been in the employ\r\nof her father, honest Thorn the plumber, nor yet in the service of her\r\nmother, the \"poor relation,\" but that in fact he was her servant before\r\nshe was married, and had remained _par excellence_ her servant ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\nShe therefore rose in arms at once, in vindication of her favorite, and\r\nwas about to work herself into one of her customary manifestations,\r\nwhich Hiram was evidently in no state of mind to bear, when there was\r\nsuddenly a ring at the door. An instant's parley, and the servant\r\nentered, bearing a note to Mr. Meeker.\r\n\r\nThe superscription was in Belle's handwriting.\r\n\r\nA 'terrible sagacity' informed Hiram's heart of something dreadful about\r\nto shock it. He tore open the envelope with fierceness, and read as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     'DEAR PAPA: Don't be angry with me. I was married\r\n     yesterday to Filippo Barbone. I married him because I love him, and\r\n     could never love any one else. I knew you would not consent, but I\r\n     could not live without him. Forgive your little girl, dear papa,\r\n     and write me to come back to you with my dear Filippo. Oh, I know\r\n     you will like _him_. Send to me at the Gresham House, Philadelphia.\r\n     I shall be in agony till I hear from you. Love to dear mamma and\r\n     Harriet. If I only had your forgiveness, how happy I should be,\r\n     dear, dear papa!\r\n\r\n           'Your little           Belle.'\r\n\r\n[This letter, mainly the production of the Signor, was prepared and put\r\ninto the hands of his accomplice before the runaways set off, with\r\ndirections to watch for Hiram's entrance into his house, and deliver\r\nimmediately after.]\r\n\r\nNever before did Hiram Meeker give way to such an exhibition of rage.\r\n\r\nHe glared fiercely about him, as if endeavoring to find some person on\r\nwhom to vent it.\r\n\r\nThere was no one but his wife, who stood directly before him, her angry\r\nreply in favor of 'Wakeman' having been cut short by the entrance of the\r\nservant with the note.\r\n\r\nAs Hiram's glance fell on her, a sudden suspicion seized him that she\r\nwas in some way privy to the affair. In an instant he had grasped her\r\narm, and, shaking her with all his might, he exclaimed:\r\n'Wretch!--monster!--she-devil!--limb of Satan!'\r\n\r\nThe affair was seriously enough certainly, but it had a ludicrous\r\naspect. There was Arabella, without having the slightest idea of what\r\ncould cause such a violent outbreak, tossed about like a whirligig by\r\nthe usually calm, sedate, and self-possessed Hiram, who seemed suddenly\r\ntransported into a very demon.\r\n\r\nPortions of her headdress began to come down. A pair of side curls\r\ndropped--a first-rate shot, a sportsman would say--the effect of a\r\ndouble shake and a sudden fetch-up. Next a profusion of hair from the\r\nback of the head tumbled off. Teeth began to chatter, and various\r\nportions of the structure in which she was encased, to give way.\r\n\r\nAll this time, Arabella was vainly endeavoring to give utterance to\r\nvarious exclamations, but she could only gasp out some unintelligible\r\nsound, while her eyes flashed fire and her cheeks burned with rage.\r\n\r\nAt last Hiram was exhausted, and with exhaustion came some little\r\nthought of what he had been doing. He relinquished his hold of his wife,\r\npicked up the note which he had dropped on the floor, put it into her\r\nhands, and quit the room.\r\n\r\nHiram stood a moment in the hall, quite overcome by the revulsion that\r\nsucceeded the storm. Then he slowly mounted the stairs, and proceeded to\r\nthe room of his invalid child.\r\n\r\nHarriet was so struck with the change in her father's countenance, that\r\nshe started up and exclaimed: 'Why, papa, what is the matter?'\r\n\r\n'We are disgraced, my child!' said Hiram, in a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n'How? What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Your sister has run away with a low, vile swindler. My curse rest on\r\nher forever!'\r\n\r\n'Oh, not so--say not so!' replied Harriet, imploringly.\r\n\r\n'Tell me, my child,' said Hiram, mournfully, while he seated himself by\r\nher side and took her hand--'tell your father truly, did you know\r\nanything about this?'\r\n\r\n'No, papa. I do not even now know what you mean.'\r\n\r\nQuite calmly Hiram told his daughter what had occurred. The travelling\r\ndress, and Belle's last kiss, flashed on her mind. She repeated the\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n'And you know nothing of this Filippo Barbone?' said Hiram, forcing\r\nhimself with difficulty to pronounce the name.\r\n\r\n'Nothing.'\r\n\r\n'And your mother?' continued he, slowly, and in a tone which terrified\r\nhis child.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I am sure she knew nothing about it, perfectly sure. I know she did\r\nnot wish Belle to go to Mrs. Caruthers's, because she could not go with\r\nher; and even after Belle made the arrangement to stay all night, mamma\r\ndid not seem to be at all satisfied.'\r\n\r\nHiram was convinced, and the want of an object on which to wreak his\r\nanger now served to exhaust it.\r\n\r\nHe leaned his face upon the side of his daughter's couch, and groaned.\r\n\r\nHarriet put her hand gently upon his cheek. 'Papa,' she said, timidly,\r\n'may I tell you what to do?'\r\n\r\nHiram raised his head. His face was very haggard, but he made no reply.\r\n\r\n'Send for Belle to come back, and her husband too, and let us make them\r\nhappy,' said Harriet, almost abruptly.\r\n\r\n'Never! My curse is on her! She is no longer my child--I disinherit\r\nher!'\r\n\r\n'Give her my portion, then--I shall not require it.'\r\n\r\nHiram started--a new idea had struck him. It was as if somehow he had\r\nreceived a new accession of wealth by the surrender of Harriet's share.\r\nA strange confusion of ideas, certainly; but the thought grew on him, as\r\nwe shall see by-and-by. Now, however, it gave place to the dominant\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\nHarriet, encouraged by his silence, broke in again: 'Won't you, papa?'\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\r\nHiram turned and looked at her angrily, but was compelled to lower his\r\ncountenance before his daughter's earnest, truthful, heavenly gaze.\r\n\r\nHe started up and went back to the parlor. He began to feel ashamed of\r\nhis violence toward his wife, and was anxious to dispose of the matter\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\nTo return to Arabella.\r\n\r\nAs soon as her husband had left her, she proceeded to read the note he\r\nplaced in her hands. That accomplished, she took the precaution to ring\r\nthe bell several times with great energy; and, having disposed of the\r\nlittle articles which lay scattered on the floor, she threw herself on\r\nthe sofa, in violent hysterics.\r\n\r\nWhen Hiram entered, these were at once renewed. Her husband understood\r\nthis phase of her constitution; and, directing the maid servants to\r\nremove their mistress to her own room, he ordered dinner to be served.\r\n\r\nI will do him the justice to say he ate little or nothing.\r\n\r\nTwo or three times the waiter observed that his master put his hand to\r\nhis head and then to his heart, as if endeavoring to tranquillize\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, he mounted his horse, and rode several miles. When he\r\nreturned, one would not have known, to look at him, that anything\r\nunusual had happened.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the nest week Hiram was occupied in making his will. A new and\r\nimportant idea seemed to have possession of him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom that period he never permitted his daughter's name to be mentioned,\r\nand would receive no communication from her.\r\n\r\nArabella's hysterics continued, at intervals for several days. Her\r\nhusband, in view of his violence toward her, was very considerate, but\r\nthe affair was never alluded to by either.\r\n\r\nArabella, perhaps, felt that she deserved some punishment for tolerating\r\nthe 'Count in disguise;' and Hiram never got over a certain feeling of\r\nmortification when he thought of the scene in the parlor.\r\n\r\nHere we leave all the parties for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANICAL TENDENCY IN MODERN SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no greater absurdity than the attempt to demonstrate anything\r\nfrom historical evidence, or to frame from it an argument whose cogency\r\nshall even approach to a demonstration. Granting the hypothesis that\r\nlike causes will always produce like effects, we find ourselves unable\r\nto show that the cases are exactly, or even proximately, the same.\r\nHistory is not a record of every circumstance, but of those only that\r\nwere deemed worthy of perpetuation; and even were all circumstances\r\nknown to us, we must receive them as seen through the opinions of the\r\nhistorian, while the present is as it seems to us; so two cases, while\r\nappearing to agree, may in reality be very unlike. And, in addition to\r\nthis, so many are the events that precede any given effect, that it is\r\nimpossible to determine which is the cause, and which only the\r\ncircumstance attending that cause. So, while our literature is flooded,\r\nwith so many 'demonstrations from history,' many a philosopher finds\r\nhimself in the situation of the sage who demonstrated that 'Tenterton\r\nsteeple' was the 'cause of Godwin Sands.'\r\n\r\nFrom this it has arisen that practical men have come to despise not only\r\nall reasonings from history, but social science altogether, deeming it a\r\npleasant tissue of thoughts that may amuse a leisure hour, but nothing\r\nof practical importance. On most subjects this is unfortunately true,\r\nbut sometimes in the state of a nation there are indications, repeated\r\nagain and again, showing the existence of a cause which, unless\r\ncounteracted, will eventually produce certain disastrous effects. Though\r\nseen and pointed out by many wise men, still the existence of the cause\r\ncannot be logically proved, nor the time of its effect mathematically\r\ncalculated. Such were the terrible premonitions which foretold the\r\nFrench Revolution, and such are the signs showing over and over again\r\nthe existence of a mechanical tendency in our own social state. Very\r\nseldom, almost never, do we have mathematical certainty as the ground of\r\nour action, but the greater part of our lives is directed by moral or\r\nprobable evidence; and though most of our reasoning on this subject must\r\nbe derived from history or social science, we deem it worthy of the same\r\ntreatment that is given, to other questions. If the probabilities be not\r\nas great, let it pass with other schemes and theories, but if those\r\nprobabilities be great enough to make it of practical and vital\r\nimportance, then let it become an element in every man's consideration.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of possible confusion in this word _mechanical_.\r\nTo most readers it would bring the idea of invention, the increasing\r\nnumber of cotton mills and iron founderies, of steamships and power\r\npresses, and such progress would be considered in the highest degree\r\npraiseworthy; but the sense in which we use the word is somewhat more\r\ngeneral. A machine differs from a man in this respect: the former acts\r\nwithout intelligence and without volition, in accordance with certain\r\nlaws impressed upon it from without; while a man chooses his own end by\r\nhis own volition, in the light of his own intelligence, and in the same\r\nmanner decides upon the means for obtaining that end. A mechanical\r\ncondition would therefore be one wherein an individual acts without\r\nintelligence or volition, according to certain laws or habits coming to\r\nhim from others; a mechanical state of society, one wherein the\r\ngovernment moves on according to the will of one or more men, without\r\nthought, love, or even attention from the mass of the people, content\r\nonly with their acquiescence. On the other hand, a rational condition,\r\nboth of society and of the individual, would be that in which the\r\nthought, will, and love of the individual gave strength and life to\r\nevery act.\r\n\r\nThe question whether our social state is becoming mechanical, losing\r\npersonal thought and volition, is of great and vital importance, on\r\naccount of the terrible major premise that lies beneath. For prove but\r\nonce that this is the fact, and there comes upon us the great general\r\ntruth: 'The nation that is growing mechanical is hastening toward its\r\ndestruction.' The proof of this assertion is written everywhere in\r\nhistory. The limits of this article render it impossible that a tithe of\r\nthe proof should be brought forward in its support, and therefore only\r\nthe most general truths can be laid down for the reader to verify from\r\nhis own historical knowledge. No fact is more indisputable than that\r\nevery preceding civilization has had its birth, progress, and death,\r\ndiffering only in length from the life of a mortal man; and in the state\r\nof each one, in proportion as this mechanical tendency increased, in\r\nthat proportion their national life departed.\r\n\r\nThe first period in every nation has been that called the heroic or\r\ngolden age. Whether this was, in reality, or only in poetic dream, the\r\nbest age, depends upon another question: What is the true aim in the\r\nlife of men and nations? If it be but to live comfortably and without\r\nconfusion, then the architecture and laws of later times are a proof of\r\nprogress; but if the great end be to develop the whole man, and live a\r\nbrave, thoughtful, truthful life, with or without tumult, then is the\r\nfirst the golden age; for, entering on a new mode of life, undirected by\r\nhabits of thought or action from his ancestors, each man makes use of\r\nhis personal thought in finding out, and volition in choosing, his\r\nmethod of life. No history has recorded the internal state of such a\r\nnation, but only the fact that it has always been successful in\r\npreserving its liberties against invasion.\r\n\r\nThe next is the age of leaders, when individual thought has so far\r\ndeparted that they begin to look to others not yet as governors, but\r\ndirectors. This, to a superficial view the noblest age, marks the\r\nbeginning of a decline. Its great power of invasion, as under Pericles\r\nor Cæsar, comes from the fact that, while strength enough is left to\r\ncarry out the details, there is not enough of independence in thought to\r\nmar the unity in the plan of its leader. Its brilliant literature\r\nsprings from division of labor; life has become so complex that each man\r\ncannot comprehend it all--so one takes the department of thought,\r\nanother of action. The man of thought tries to bring back that courage\r\nand virtue which he sees are departing, by singing beautiful songs in\r\ntheir praise; while the man of action, feeling their waning power in\r\nhimself, makes up, by repeating these praises, the lack of a heroic\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe next is the mechanical age of society, which life has so outgrown\r\nthe mind that the man cannot attend to both his own affairs and the\r\nstate, which latter, therefore, he gladly yields to others. This is the\r\nage of standing armies, hired to protect a people too careless to\r\nprotect themselves. This is the age of tyrants, as the lesser Cæsars or\r\nPhilip of Macedon. This is the age which ushers in the last period of\r\nthe nation, a mechanical state of the individual, when thought has so\r\ndeparted that the man is not able to attend even to his own life, and,\r\nlike a passive machine, the state is impelled and directed in even the\r\nleast things by one tyranny from without. It is hardly necessary to add\r\nthat Alexander in Greece, Elagabalus in Rome, Louis XVI in France, were\r\nfollowed by a destruction as certain as the fact that God meant the\r\nearth to be inhabited by men and not machines.\r\n\r\nHaving shown the grave consequence that lies beneath it, we come now to\r\nthe all-important consideration, whether our own social state has this\r\nmechanical tendency. The preceding sketch not only shows the truth which\r\nwe have deduced from it, that this tendency is a prelude to a nation's\r\ndeath, but it also points out another, namely, that civilization\r\ncontains within itself certain causes which finally work its\r\ndestruction. We may, by a diligent study, find out these causes, such\r\nas increase of outward knowledge, division of labor, a complexity of\r\noutward relations, and a consequent hurried life that leaves no time for\r\nthought; but a careful analysis of all these reduces them to one great\r\ncause--an undue attention to physical prosperity. This cause existed\r\namong ancient nations in sufficient force to bring about their\r\ndestruction, but it possessed not a tithe of the universality and\r\nstrength which it holds among the modern, for, whereas it was once\r\nindividual, it is now national, pervading every part of the social\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nBefore the world was thickly settled and the nations established, it was\r\nheld that the power of a nation consisted in the extent of its\r\ndominions, so that while the individual strove for wealth in\r\nagriculture, manufactures, or commerce, the state despised such low\r\npursuits, and turned its attention to increase of territory. But when,\r\nafter the fall of Rome, it was found that the earth was too fully\r\npeopled and national power too well established for such means of\r\nstrength, attention was turned to another source of power in the\r\ncultivation of a people's own resources and increase of its wealth.\r\nWealth is obtained by the addition of mental power to physical products,\r\nincreasing their value for supplying the wants of man. So that attention\r\nto physical comfort and prosperity which was despised by the brave\r\nnations of antiquity, is now the leading object of government: treaties\r\nare made, wars are declared, rebellions break out, not on account of\r\nnational glory or right, but in consideration of cotton manufacture,\r\nfacilities of commerce, or freedom of trade. Nations as well as men are\r\nabsorbed in the same great pursuit, adding mind to matter for production\r\nof wealth.\r\n\r\nFrom this undue attention to physical prosperity spring certain\r\nsubordinate causes, which, upon examination, are found to be the exact\r\n_differentia_ of modern times. The characteristics which distinguish our\r\nage from all others are the very ones which have been found so\r\ndestructive to preexistent civilizations. The first characteristic of\r\nthis kind is the abundance of outward knowledge. In the pursuit of\r\nwealth, the ocean, the desert, the isles of the sea have been ransacked\r\nfor commodities to gratify the desires of man, and, in order that nature\r\nmay be pliable for the same purpose in the hands of the artisan, its\r\nlaws have been studied with the greatest success; the bowels of the\r\nearth, the depths of the air, the prison of the arctic seas, have all\r\nbeen subject to the same strict scrutiny in this design.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge thus obtained comes pouring in by lightning and steam, and\r\nis scattered over the world within the reach of the poorest by means of\r\nthe printing press. The man of to-day is a citizen of the world; he\r\nseems to be ubiquitous. It is as though he had a thousand eyes and ears,\r\nand, alas! only one mind. Thought has two conditions: first, knowledge,\r\nas food and stimulus; second, time for distributing and digesting that\r\nknowledge. But the first is so superabundantly fufilled that it entirely\r\nobliterates the second. Knowledge comes pouring in from all quarters so\r\nrapidly, that the man can hardly receive, much less arrange and think\r\nout, the enormous mass of facts daily accumulating upon him. The boasted\r\nage of printing presses and newspapers, of penny magazines, and penny\r\ncyclopædias, is not necessarily the age of thought. There is a world-\r\n\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n|Transcribers note: It is regretted that page 354 is missing|\r\n|and cannot be traced.                                      |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nwill be the result; but to the working-man division of labor is mental\r\ndeath. The ancients might call these masses the _ignobile vulgus_, the\r\nFrench nobles might sneer at them as _sans-culottes_, we may deride them\r\nas the 'common herd,' all attempting to ignore their existence in\r\nhistory or politics; but it will be all in vain--for in the end it is\r\nthe people that rule, be the government of the surface what it may.\r\nEither they will raise their rulers by their intelligent freedom, or\r\ndrag the brilliant crowd down with them to destruction in spite of\r\ntheory or law. Not only in mad sedition and revolution, but always, the\r\nmasses govern.\r\n\r\nThe next great characteristic of the age is the increased complexity of\r\noutward relations, while the inner mental power does not increase in the\r\nsame ratio. The former causes had a mechanical tendency in that they\r\nlessened the mental strength, for all volition must have its foundation\r\nin thought; but this has the same tendency, inasmuch as it increases the\r\nobjects of thought beyond the power of the mind to satisfy the demand.\r\nIf any intelligent man should stop in the midst of his life, and\r\nconsider the relations by which he is surrounded, and for the satisfying\r\nof which he is responsible, he will shrink amazed from their enormous\r\ncomplexity: demands from the state for support and thoughtful fidelity,\r\ndemands from his fellow men for love and charity, children demanding\r\neducation and training, his own nature demanding cultivation and\r\ndevelopment, and, last of all, or rather first of all, his God demanding\r\nthoughtful love and service. When he proceeds to consider how he may\r\nbest satisfy all these, there pours in upon him knowledge unbounded,\r\nschemes, theories, and methods innumerable, so that he retreats at last\r\nin despair and returns to his business--so he calls it, as though to\r\nmake money were all that a man was sent into the world for, as though\r\nhis children, his country, his fellow man, were not all his business.\r\nThe outer world seems to have risen to overwhelm him, and the reason of\r\nit lies in this same great cause of undue attention to outward\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nIn the pursuit of wealth, men have aggregated themselves into towns and\r\ncities, whose area is measured by square miles, and their population by\r\nhundreds of thousands or millions; the mind meanwhile, instead of\r\nincreasing in proportion to the demands thus made upon it, has rather\r\ndiminished in power. Added to this, each man finds his own private\r\naffairs in the same state. The social barrier of birth is either gone or\r\nfast departing, and each man recognizes wealth as the only way to power;\r\nbut the concentrated attention of men and nations in this direction has\r\nso complicated its pursuit that he must give his whole mind and heart to\r\nthis alone, if he would hope to succeed in it, or even comprehend it.\r\nWhile these two worlds, the objective and the thinking subjective, have\r\nthus grown so enormously out of proportion, the world has found a remedy\r\nagain in division of labor. The different relations, which are the\r\nunalienable obligations of every man, have been parcelled out among all,\r\nand each takes but one as his vocation, leaving all the rest to the\r\nvicarious performance of others. Politicians care for the state,\r\nteachers for the children, charitable societies for each man's neighbor,\r\nand preachers fulfil his duty to God.\r\n\r\nThe first mistake in the world's action is this. In this partition,\r\nthoughts and actions have become separated, the world is filled and the\r\nindividual confounded by new religions, methods of education, theories\r\nof government, propounded by those _par excellence_ called the thinking\r\nmen, while the men who work have no time for thought. Wisdom is theory\r\nproved by experience, but here, alas! the reasoning man and the\r\npractical man are separated, so that we are farther than ever from the\r\nliving truth.\r\n\r\n  Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore,\r\n  And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.'\r\n\r\n\r\nBehind this first mistake, that one man can do the thinking for another,\r\nthe great error in the world's reasoning on this subject is this, that\r\none man can perform another's duties at all. The duty is his, the\r\nresponsibility is his, and none can perform the one or assume the other.\r\nGranting that he may supply the thought or mechanical; the dynamical,\r\nthe love and soul power which would make that logic effectual, can come\r\nonly from each individual himself.\r\n\r\nThe duty which each man owes to his children is education and training.\r\nSchools and teachers may supply schemes of education, improved methods\r\nof study, and instil some facts or even ideas into the mind; but that\r\nwhich vivifies the intellect and brings out every power in its fullest\r\ndevelopment is the motive of love; and it was meant that the filial\r\naffection of the child toward its parent should be the life of its\r\nopening mind. The mere logic of religion, Sunday schools and teachers,\r\nmay supply one day out of seven; but to animate that logic and make it a\r\npractical thing, a faith instead of a belief, it must be made concrete\r\nand living in the loving life of home. In this case no one does the duty\r\nor assumes the responsibility of the parent.\r\n\r\nOur duty to our fellow men is not charity as we use the word--a bill\r\ndropped into the contribution box, or a subscription to a charitable\r\nsociety; but [Greek: charis] in the old meaning of love and help.\r\nPoverty springs from two causes--improvidence, a lack of the\r\n_savoir-faire_ in the affairs of life, or overwhelming circumstances,\r\nwhich have broken the spirit of the man and made him sit down\r\ndiscouraged and despairing. In either case, money is no remedy. If the\r\nman be improvident, it only helps the evil for a moment, and the want\r\nsoon returns: what the man needs is instruction and care from those\r\nbetter versed in the art of living. And in the second case, to give\r\nmoney is no avail, but rather an evil; for instead of thus recognizing\r\nhis degradation, the man needs encouragement, the enthusiasm of a strong\r\nand successful heart, giving life and light to him who thus sits in\r\ndarkness. This demands the time and careful thought of every man, or the\r\nduty is left undone. Charitable institutions are well enough: the only\r\nerror is in supposing that they can assume the responsibility of the\r\nindividual. 'This ye ought to have done, and not to have left the other\r\nundone.'\r\n\r\nOur country cannot be left to politicians, for its first great demand is\r\nthe careful thought of every man in the direction of its affairs; and\r\nthis, no single man or class of men can supply. The action of Government\r\nshould be conditioned by the needs of the people, and these can be known\r\nonly by the people themselves. It is for every man, therefore, to keep\r\nan earnest and heedful eye to his own needs and the wants of those about\r\nhim, if the _vox populi_ would be _vox Dei_, the utterance of God's\r\ntruth; otherwise the opinion of the people will be the voice of\r\ndemagogues, which is as far as possible from the voice of God. Another\r\nneed is that of continual watchfulness, lest the country be defrauded,\r\nor its rulers become corrupt. No class of men can be appointed as\r\nwatchmen, lest they also go in the same way: but it is the unalienable\r\nduty of the whole people. When the emergency of defence arises, no man\r\ncan really perform his duty by the payment of money or the providing of\r\na substitute; for that which makes a country strong is not armies or\r\ncannon, but life. The Moors held Grenada, in the midst of Spain, for\r\nyears, the Swiss have remained amid the storms of Europe for centuries,\r\na Rome of huts went out to conquer the world, while a Rome of palaces is\r\ndoomed to invasion and death. Every nation has money enough, if it have\r\nonly patriotism and its attendant courage. Even if war has become\r\nmechanical and men fight at a distance, so that the courage of a hand to\r\nhand conflict is of no avail, it finally comes to the same result; a\r\nnation needs not cannon or armies, but men whose hands are strong and\r\nwhose minds are quick because of the love in their hearts. No man\r\nperforms his duty unless he sends a substitute of equal bravery and\r\npatriotism to that which he should himself possess, and then he must do\r\nthe substitute's duty by going in his place. Politicians and hired\r\nsoldiery can neither govern nor protect a country; it needs the people\r\nthemselves as individuals.\r\n\r\nIn religion, no man pretends to say that a class of men can perform the\r\nduty which each man owes to God, and the person who should say such a\r\nthing would be considered in jest or partially deranged. Yet it is so\r\ntacitly held, and practically believed. As the man sits in his cushioned\r\nseat on the Lord's day, and looks up at the stately edifice which he has\r\nhelped to build, and hears the eloquent words of the preacher whom he in\r\npart pays, he has a comfortable feeling that his work is done. To be\r\nsure, no man can love God without knowing Him, and none can know Him\r\nwell without a careful and intelligent study of His works in creation\r\nand revelation; but the man himself has no time for this, he has\r\nsomething else to do, and if he but hire another to dig out these\r\ntruths, and present them to him, as it were ready made, of a Sunday, he\r\nconsiders that it is enough. The preacher performs the thinking and the\r\narchitect the acting of man's duty to God. So the world goes on;\r\nreligion is merely logical, mechanical, a kind of 'greatest amount of\r\nhappiness' affair, a lubricant to make the wheels of society move on\r\nsmoothly, instead of being from the soul, dynamical, giving love and\r\nlife to the world.\r\n\r\nThis mechanical tendency has also an element which makes it worse than\r\nany corresponding state in former times, for these at least contained a\r\nfaith which was positive, while ours is utterly negative; theirs sprang\r\nfrom want of mental power, ours from want of time. When in times past a\r\npeople felt the power of thought going from them, and became conscious\r\nof their inability to solve the great riddle of life which was\r\nperplexing them, they chose the best remedy for what was irremediable,\r\nand turned to wiser men than they for direction and help. From thence\r\nsprang faith, reverence, hero worship, which stands next in rank to\r\nindependent thought. But we, having no time to attend to these things,\r\nhave yet no faith in those to whom they are entrusted, and no hope of\r\ntheir successful issue; we but shrug our shoulders at the thought, say,\r\n'I cannot attend to it,' and let it go. So _laisser aller_ is the cry of\r\nthe age, a dead negation of thought and volition.\r\n\r\nBy proving the existence of the causes that produce it, we have shown\r\nthe presence of a mechanical tendency in our social state; the same\r\nthing may be done in another way, by proving the existence of effects\r\nthat flow from it. The truest index of a people's condition is found in\r\nthe meaning which they attach to certain, words. A history of the word\r\n_virtus_, manhood, is a history of the social condition of the Roman\r\npeople. If, then, we find that the conceptions which we attach to such\r\nwords as God, man, and society are mechanical, then society must have\r\nsuch a tendency, for these words lie at the foundation of all\r\ngovernment, all social movements, and all individual actions.\r\n\r\nFirst, the meaning of the word God. We, as a people, neither deny nor\r\npretend to deny, in words, the existence of a Being, infinite in power\r\nand wisdom, who governs the universe according to his will; yet\r\npractically we have ignored His existence, and deified the laws of\r\nnature instead, given up the idea of a free volition, worshipping a\r\nmechanical necessity of cause and effect. The cause of this dates back\r\nto Bacon's 'Novum Organum,' the introduction of the Inductive\r\nPhilosophy. He laid down the principle that nature must be interrogated\r\nif she would be understood, that from a careful study of the effects we\r\nmust deduce the cause, instead of presuming the cause, and explaining\r\nthe effects on this hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThis form of study and the study itself are well enough when confined to\r\ntheir right proportion; but desire for wealth, in its endeavor to adapt\r\nnature to the wants of man, has forced the study out of its proportion,\r\nand deduced from it an untruth. In proving the being of a God from\r\nnature alone, we get only the idea of power joined to a dead necessity\r\nof laws; and it must be in the study of the human soul, with its\r\npersonality and volition, that we shall get the other ideas, which,\r\njoined to that of power, prove to us the being of a personal God. Nature\r\nhas been studied and analyzed and searched with all the social and\r\nindividual power of the age, while the science of mind and soul has\r\nstood still; and so it is that men no longer believe there is any God\r\nbut cause and effect; not the nation which is right is successful, but\r\n'God is always on the side which has the most cannon;' not the just man,\r\nbut the shrewd man, will succeed; not God but rain and sunshine, will\r\nbring forth the harvest.\r\n\r\nGive us back the time when men fought hand to hand in ordeal of battle,\r\nor bared their feet to walk over burning ploughshares in their firm\r\ntrust that God would defend the right; give them back with all their\r\nsuperstitions and darkness, if with them we may receive again the lost\r\nknowledge of a God who is 'Our Father,' a God who loves and protects His\r\nchildren. If there is anywhere on the earth a soul that trusts and\r\nprays, then must the world be wrong in its belief. A law is a rule of\r\nconduct, a law of nature is a rule of God's conduct, and though we have\r\nabstracted the personality and freedom, they are none the less there.\r\nThere is also a mitigated form of this atheism as follows: many believe\r\nin a personal God, yet conceive Him to be fettered by his own laws; as\r\nif He had made the machine of the universe, wound it up, and could now\r\nonly stand helplessly aside to see it go. Prayer is of no avail to such\r\na God; thus the first need of the soul is left unsatisfied, and man\r\nstands in the universe alone. Herein is their error: because He has\r\nalways acted in this manner, they reason that He always will, and then\r\ngo farther and think He always must; not seeing how He stands behind and\r\nmoves the law. When the hammer in the pianoforte rises, the wire will\r\nsound; but there is one who sits unseen at the key board and controls\r\nthe wires of the hammer. When the lightning bolt falls, the tree is\r\nshattered; but God holds the lightning in His hands.\r\n\r\nSucceeding a mechanical idea of God, we have a similar idea of man. The\r\nfundamental question of human nature is that of free will or necessity.\r\nThe history of philosophy is but a history of the conflict of these two\r\nideas: in the life of the individual also, the same great question\r\narises, whether he can be what he will, or will be what he must. From\r\nthis come all those articles on 'Nature and Circumstances,' 'Genius and\r\nLabor,' with which college magazines are filled--endeavors of the young\r\nmind to solve this most vital problem. Modern society has declared\r\nitself on the side of necessity: while acknowledging man preeminently\r\nfree in his relations to others, it yet considers him as the bondslave\r\nof motives. When God is the mere bondsman of necessity, and his religion\r\nonly the means of the greatest amount of happiness, surely his creature\r\nmust be in the same slavery. There are three great motives that sway\r\nmen--love for themselves, love to others, and love to God. The first of\r\nthese is measurable, the others immeasurable. In the first, given a\r\ngreater means of happiness, ten thousand dollars instead of nine\r\nthousand, and the action follows in that direction as a matter of\r\nnecessity. But love of children, patriotism, benevolence, love of God\r\nrise above this logical and mechanical, to the region of free and\r\nincalculable volition.\r\n\r\nSociety, ignoring any such thing as soul, has declared that only the\r\nmeasurable and necessary remains in man. Thence has arisen the science\r\nof averages, pretending to foretell with mathematical certainty what a\r\nman must do under given circumstances. Thence also has arisen this\r\nmaxim, so often quoted as final in all such questions, 'Every man has\r\nhis price.' Perhaps there is some ground too for this opinion. We have\r\nbefore shown how, by division of labor, affection and volition have been\r\nabstracted from life, while only a formal performance of duties by\r\nothers remains, and it would be strange if, under such _régime_, these\r\nparts of the human nature should not become shrunken. But the soul is\r\nnot wholly gone yet; the world is mistaken--a little is left which\r\ncannot be measured by dollars and cents, enough of benevolence yet to\r\nmake tolerable, enough of faith and love in the hearts of a few holy men\r\nto keep the world from corruption.\r\n\r\nSociety was called by the Great Master a brotherhood. Even in heathen\r\ntimes men were held by ties of kindred and country; now they acknowledge\r\npractically no bond but that of interest. The word that is continually\r\nin our mouths is 'framework of society,' 'social mechanism,' as though\r\nit were impelled by a force from without, instead of being a living and\r\nvital thing, moved and governed by its own vital forces. 'Law of\r\naverages,' 'honesty is the best policy,' 'law of supply and demand,' are\r\nsupposed to be the forces that drive the affair, while any such power as\r\nlove or faith is ignored. But as with individuals, so with society. The\r\nworld is not so bad as it declares itself to be. Enough of patriotism is\r\nstill left to affect the gold market at times, enough of faith to keep\r\nalive the effete aristocracy of Europe, enough of courage and honor to\r\nrally around and bravely uphold a tattered flag in a battle for\r\nconstitutional freedom.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have shown the existence of a mechanical tendency, yet our\r\nlabor is incomplete and practically useless unless we have shown how it\r\nmay be retarded or wholly counterbalanced. Some countervailing element\r\nthere must be, as is evident from the fact that, while the causes that\r\nproduce this tendency exist in modern society in tenfold greater power\r\nthan they ever had in ancient life, yet their operation has been, by\r\nfar, less rapid. Greece and Rome existed barely a thousand years, while\r\nAnglo-Saxon civilization has already flourished much longer than that,\r\nand as yet shows no signs of immediate decay.\r\n\r\nThe retarding cause is war. This does not strike at the root of the\r\nmatter and eradicate the love of physical prosperity, but only retards\r\nthe movement, by awaking men to see that their interests are inseparable\r\nfrom those of the state. In the midst of war they see that one cannot\r\nperform the duty of another, that hired soldiery cannot protect a state,\r\nbut their own hearts and arms must be enlisted unless they would be\r\nburied in its ruins. It wakes up the dormant dynamical powers of courage\r\nand heroism, and checks for a moment the selfish individualism that was\r\ntaking the life from the nation.\r\n\r\nThis only retards, it does not counterbalance or neutralize this\r\ntendency. War was common to ancient and modern times alike; but that\r\ncause which has so long held our society from ruin, and on which we base\r\nour hope of an indestructible civilization, is the Christian religion.\r\nThis strikes at the root of the matter, being antagonistic not only to\r\nthe one simple cause, but to each of the subordinate causes that are\r\nderived from it. Disproportionate attention to outward prosperity\r\nsprings from the idea that the happiness of men and nations is\r\ninseparable from wealth. Directly opposed to this is the teaching of\r\nreligion, that happiness and strength come from performing truly the\r\nduties of life. The first derivative cause which we found under this was\r\nan accumulation of facts which overburden the mind and destroy its\r\npower. Religion has little to do with outward facts, it taxes but little\r\nthe receptive power; it has to do rather with changing knowledge into\r\nwisdom, applying the few vital facts to the life. This knowledge, we\r\nhave found, is objective, ignoring the [Greek: Gnothi seauton]; but\r\nreligious thought is intensely subjective; all other things it esteems\r\nas of no avail, except those that relate to the outward condition and\r\ntendency of the individual. Know thyself in relation to man and\r\nGod--this it continually demands. No man can be religious without\r\nthought--continual, earnest thought, perceiving and defining duties;\r\ntherefore, wherever religion comes, even the mind that was sunken in\r\nweakness is raised to renewed life. It is in this way that religion\r\ncounterbalances the influence of division of labor. While this takes\r\naway the last incentive to thought on the part of the workman, degrading\r\nhim to a cunning but expensive machine, religion gives to him a new\r\nspring of thought, vivifies his blunted mind by the power of transformed\r\naffections, and makes him again a man.\r\n\r\nThe next derivative was lack of time, taking affection and volition from\r\nlife by dividing the duties of the individual among others. In immediate\r\nantagonism to this, religion declares that the individual stands alone\r\nin his duties and responsibilities before God. It recognizes no\r\ninstitution of charity or social partition, but reiterates the command,\r\n'Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,' which includes everything.\r\n\r\nReligion is opposed to this tendency, not only in its causes, but in its\r\neffects. It brings back to us the idea of a personal God. It makes no\r\nmention of nature, but simply says: 'The heavens declare the glory of\r\nGod,' 'He sendeth his rain on the just and the unjust.' No laws of\r\nnature are spoken of as conditioning the action of God, but He sees the\r\nsparrow's fall and provides for it; He hears and answers the prayer of\r\nHis children. It declares man to be more than a slave driven by motives,\r\nwith every action necessitated; it declares him a creature of free\r\nvolition, whose action can neither be calculated nor controlled. It\r\ndeclares him possessed of powers of love and hate, which defy\r\nmathematics; a being above all price, to whom honesty may be more than\r\n'the best policy,' even the loving obedience of a child to a loving\r\nFather. It declares society to be no mere framework tied together by\r\ninterest, but a brotherhood, like a living soul, having a common Father,\r\nSaviour, and Home. In place of supply and demand, policy, interest, it\r\nenunciates but one word, _love_.\r\n\r\nIt would be worse than useless if we had come so far in reasoning, and\r\nobtained no practical result, which might be embodied in each man's\r\naction. We have shown the existence of this tendency, and the powers\r\nthat are antagonistic to it. We cannot prove the result, for there is no\r\nanalogy in any preceding case which history affords; we cannot calculate\r\nthe strength of the opposing powers, for the issue lies in man's\r\nvolition, which is above mathematics. Yet practically, the result, as\r\nfar as regards us individually, is as valuable as though this were\r\npossible. The result depends upon the world's decision, and each man is\r\nresponsible for his part of that decision, whether he will give his\r\nheart to outward or inward prosperity. If he would have his children, to\r\nunnumbered generations, rise up to bless the age in which he lived, and\r\nhim who lived therein; if he would do what he can to make his country's\r\ncivilization perpetual, and his own life truly happy, let him give up\r\nall thought of _laissez faire_, 'it will last my time,' and begin to\r\nlead an earnest, thoughtful life, sacrificing, if need be, something of\r\noutward prosperity for the sake of fulfilling his duty in love and\r\naction to his fellow men and to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INDIAN LOVE-SONG.\r\n\r\n\r\n  From his ambush in thy shadowy eyes young Love an arrow shot,\r\n  When beneath thy father's wigwam my youthful brain grew hot.\r\n  My heart is all a-quiver, but hear me while I sing;\r\n  Oh let me be thy beau, and I will never snap the string!\r\n    Then clad in noiseless moccasons the feet of the years shall fall;\r\n    For I will cherish thee, my love, till Time shall scalp us all.\r\n\r\n  Not with the glittering wampum have I come thy smiles to woo;\r\n  But I offer a cabin passage down life's river in my canoe;\r\n  And to beguile the voyage, if thou wilt come aboard,\r\n  Till sunset fire the waters the fire-water shall be poured.\r\n    While clad in noiseless moccasons the feet of the years shall fall;\r\n    And I will cherish thee, my love, till Time shall scalp us all.\r\n\r\n  Though my pipe of peace thy cruelty has shattered, stem and bowl,\r\n  A thousand thongs from thy dear hide are knotted round my soul.\r\n  From every murderous tomahawk my dove shall shielded be;\r\n  And if famine stare us in the face, I'll jerk my heart for thee.\r\n    So, clad in noiseless moccasons the feet of the years shall fall;\r\n    And I will cherish thee, my love, till Time shall scalp us all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOEMS FROM THE INNER LIFE. By LIZZIE DOTEN. Boston:\r\nWm. White & Co., 'Banner of Light' Office, 158 Washington street, New\r\nYork: A. J. Davis, 274 Canal street.\r\n\r\nThis book was written from what is called 'the plane of spiritual\r\nexperience' of which we, being neither clairvoyant, clairaudient, nor\r\nclairsentient, know positively nothing.' Miss Doten says: 'I claim both\r\na general and particular inspiration. I know that many sincere and\r\nearnest souls will decide, in the integrity of their well-trained\r\nintellects, that my claim to an intercourse with the invisible world is\r\nan extravagant assumption, and has no foundation in truth. I cannot\r\nconscientiously deny that in the mysteries of my inner life I have been\r\nacted upon decidedly and directly by disembodied intelligences, and this\r\nsometimes by an inspiration characteristic of the individual, or by a\r\npsychological influence similar to that whereby mind acts upon mind in\r\nthe body. Many of the poems were given by direct spirit influence before\r\npublic audiences. For many of them I could not obtain the authorship,\r\nbut for such as I could the names are given.'\r\n\r\nStrange statements truly, and yet we see no reason to doubt that Miss\r\nDoten fully believes them to be simple records of facts known to\r\nherself. We do not doubt her truth and good faith; but we confess\r\nourselves puzzled with the contradictory and inconsequent phenomena of\r\nmodern spiritualism. These developments never bring any accession to our\r\nknowledge. In addition to the curious circumstances attending the\r\ncreation of these poems, many of them are very beautiful. In those\r\npurporting to have been dictated by the spirit of Poe, the similarity of\r\nstyle is quite remarkable. His alliterations, his frequent assonances\r\nand rhymes, his chiming and ever-musical rhythms are wonderfully well\r\nreproduced. But has he learned nothing new to tell us in those 'supernal\r\nspheres'? Has he struck upon no new path in those weird regions, grasped\r\nno fresh and startling thought to weave into the perfect music of his\r\nlines? Nay, has he learned no new tunes, chimes, or rhythms 'where the\r\nangels' feet make music over all the starry floor'? Could he not lift\r\nfor us the veil of Isis? The 'inspiration' from Shakspeare we regard as\r\na total failure. He who never repeated himself on earth, comes to us who\r\nlove him, after his long residence in heaven, and travesties his own\r\nmatchless dramas by weak quotations from them, as if he had been\r\ncogitating only his own words through the new scenes of glory which had\r\nopened before him. Our great Shakspeare has grown none in the passing\r\ncenturies--comes from the empyrean to gabble like a dotard of the\r\nvisions of his youth? We quote from the poem:\r\n\r\n  'Man learns in this Valhalla of his soul\r\n  To love, nor ever finds 'Love's Labor Lost.'\r\n  No two-faced Falstaff proffers double suit;\r\n  No Desdemona mourns Iago's art;\r\n  And every Romeo finds his Juliet.'\r\n\r\nTrust us, fair and gifted Miss Doten, the spirit who sang this into your\r\nsoul was not Shakspeare, nor, unless we are much mistaken, even one of\r\nhis acquaintances.\r\n\r\nFAITH AND FANCY. By JOHN SAVAGE, Author of 'Sibyl, a\r\nTragedy.' New York: James B. Kirker, 599 Broadway. Washington, D. C.:\r\nPhilip & Solomon.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to welcome this little volume of poems, some of which were\r\npublished anonymously, and received general praise from critics and\r\nreaders. They are vigorous, patriotic, rhythmical, and many of them are\r\nmarked with imaginative power. The 'Muster of the North' is a bold and\r\nstriking poem.\r\n\r\nLIFE OF EDWARD LIVINGSTON. By CHARLES HAVENS HUNT.\r\nWith an Introduction by GEORGE BANCROFT. New York: D. Appleton\r\n& Co., 443 and 445 Broadway.\r\n\r\nMr. Hunt has had great advantages in the preparation of this interesting\r\nlife, the only surviving members of Mr. Livingston's immediate family\r\nhaving placed in his hands the whole mass of papers left by him at his\r\ndeath. The work has a double interest. As a man, Mr. Livingston claims\r\nour sympathies from his domestic virtues, his unvarying sweetness of\r\ndemeanor, his high ability and culture; as jurist and statesman, he is\r\nclosely related to the great epochs of our country. It fell to his lot,\r\nafter our acquisition of Louisiana, to adjust the old municipal laws\r\nderived from France and Spain, to the new condition of the connection\r\nwith America. 'The code which he prepared at the instance of the State\r\nof Louisiana,' says Mr. Bancroft, 'is in its simplicity, completeness,\r\nand humanity at once an impersonation of the man and an exposition of\r\nthe American Constitution. If it has never been adopted as a whole, it\r\nhas proved an unfailing fountain of reforms, suggested by its\r\nprinciples.' Mr. Livingston will live historically with such men as\r\nBacon, Montesquieu, Beccaria, and Bentham. His great work in its final\r\nform was styled 'A System of Penal Law,' and was divided into 'A Code of\r\nCrimes and Punishments,' 'A Code of Procedure,' 'A Code of Evidence,'\r\nand 'A Code of Reform and Prison Discipline,' besides 'A Book of\r\nDefinitions.' This work is marked by great unity of design, by the\r\nshunning of legal ambiguity, by the preventing rather than avenging\r\ncrime, and by bringing 'mercy to season justice.'\r\n\r\nSpace fails to follow Mr. Livingston through his congressional career,\r\nhis social and domestic life, his many and pleasant relations with\r\nGeneral Jackson, George M. Dallas, and most of the leading men of his\r\nown times. We close this short notice with a quotation from Charles J.\r\nIngersoll: 'A purer, sweeter, or superior spirit seldom has departed. He\r\nbelonged to a peerage of which there are very few members.' We doubt not\r\nthis important record will obtain a wide recognition.\r\n\r\nRAMBLES AMONG WORDS: their Poetry, History, and Wisdom. By\r\nWILLIAM SWINTON. Revised Edition. New York: Dion Thomas, 142\r\nNassau street.\r\n\r\nWe are glad to welcome a new edition of this interesting book. Some\r\nfifteen hundred illustrations of the Poetry, History, and Wisdom of\r\nWords are presented to the reader in these pages, the greater number of\r\nwhich have never before been etymologically analyzed. Mr. Swinton's\r\nclassifications are ingenious and suggestive. We have 'The Work of the\r\nSenses, 'The Idealism of Words,' 'Fossil Poetries,' 'Fossil Histories,'\r\n'Words of Abuse,' 'Growth of Words,' 'Verbal Ethics,' 'English in\r\nAmerica,' &c. Our author says: 'In the growth of Words all the\r\nactivities of the mind conspire. Language is the mirror of the living\r\ninward consciousness. Language is concrete metaphysics. What rays does\r\nit let in on the mind's subtile workings! There is more of what there is\r\nof essential in metaphysics--more of the structural action of the human\r\nmind, in Words, than in the concerted introspection of all the\r\npsychologists.' And very skilfully has Mr. Swinton elicited the pregnant\r\nmeanings, the rich coloring, the 'concrete metaphysics,' the terrors,\r\ndelights, and wonders of words. Thoughtlessly enough we use them, but\r\nthey are coins of matchless worth, stamped with the history and marked\r\nby the complicated powers of the being in the fire of whose soul they\r\nare fused. Truthfulness of derivation, history, erudition, poetry, and\r\nimagination meet in the charming pages before us, and enthral the\r\ninterest. We recommend the work not only to the student, but to all\r\nreaders of intelligence. Those already familiar with the subject will\r\nfind much rare and original matter; while those to whom it is new will\r\nbe astonished and startled with the unsuspected resources of the magical\r\nregions through which 'Rambles among Words' will conduct them.\r\n\r\nTHE VAGABONDS. By J. T. TROWBRIDGE. With Illustrations\r\nby F. O. C. Darley. New York: James G. Gregory, 46 Walker street.\r\n\r\nMost of the readers of the _Atlantic Monthly_ will remember 'The\r\nVagabonds'--a poem remarkable for its truth and pathos. Darley has\r\ncaught the spirit of the 'two travellers'--indeed, the expression of\r\nlove and pity in the face of the dog is almost human. If we but read\r\nthis poem aright, a moral lies in every verse, teaching us compassion\r\nfor erring humanity, and mercy to the dumb creatures whom no sin or\r\ndegradation can alienate from their loyal affections. We thank Darley\r\nfor these exquisite and tender illustrations. They are worthy of his\r\nfame. May they save our poor four-footed 'Rogers' many a kick, and\r\nelicit a deeper sympathy for earth's unfortunate vagabonds!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE METROPOLITAN FAIR IN AID OF THE UNITED STATES SANITARY COMMISSION.\r\n\r\nBelieving it to be the duty of all public and private citizens, of all\r\njournals and publications, to do whatsoever may be in their power to aid\r\nthe Metropolitan Fair in the effort to sustain the Sanitary Commission\r\nin its important functions, we propose devoting to this purpose the\r\npages of our Editor's Table.\r\n\r\nFort Sumter fell on the 15th of April, 1861; on the 16th, the\r\nPresident's proclamation calling out seventy-five thousand troops to\r\nsuppress an armed rebellion was issued. The effect was electric,\r\nstartling the loyal States into sudden activity. Men rushed to arms, and\r\nwomen thronged together to devise means to alleviate suffering likely\r\nsoon to occur among the brave fellows speeding to face death in behalf\r\nof their country. Surgeons and physicians were invited to meet with them\r\nand instruct them how to make lint, prepare bandages, and educate\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty ladies met during this juncture at the New York Infirmary\r\nfor women, April 25th, 1861, and a committee was appointed to organize\r\nthe benevolence of our women into a Central Association. A meeting was\r\ncalled in the Cooper Institute, April 29th, attended by the largest\r\nassembly of ladies ever drawn together before. It was presided over by\r\nD. D. Field, Esq.[5] Rev. Dr. Bellows explained the object of the\r\nmeeting, and an eloquent address was made by Vice-President Hamlin. Dr.\r\nCrawford, since Brigadier-General Crawford, who had been at Fort Sumter,\r\nfollowed him. Drs. Wood, Mott, Stevens, etc., urged the merits of the\r\nenterprise. Articles of organization were brought in, which, under the\r\nname of the Women's Central Association of Relief, united the women of\r\nNew York in a society whose objects were to collect and distribute\r\nauthentic information with regard to the wants of the army; to establish\r\na recognized union with the New York Medical Association for the supply\r\nof lint, bandages, etc.; to solicit the aid of all local associations;\r\nand to take measures for training and securing a supply of nurses\r\nagainst any possible demand of war. Dr. Mott was appointed President of\r\nthe Association; Rev. Dr. Bellows, Vice-President; G. F. Allen, Esq.,\r\nSecretary; and Howard Potter, of Brown Brothers & Co., Treasurer.\r\n\r\nWise questions were put to the Chief Medical Purveyor of the U. S. Army\r\nby the Association, to which kind and patient verbal answers were\r\nreturned. But it was evident that he regarded its solicitude as\r\nexaggerated, and its proffer of aid as almost superfluous, believing the\r\nMedical Department was fully aroused to its duties, and able to meet\r\nthem. There can be no doubt that this opinion was perfectly honest,\r\nloyal, and faithful. But the women still believed that something might\r\nbe done for the objects of their solicitude. A committee, consisting of\r\nDr. W. H. Van Buren, Dr. Elisha Harris, Dr. Jacob Harsen, and Rev. Dr.\r\nBellows, etc., was appointed to visit Washington, and confer with the\r\nmedical authorities and the War Department in regard to the whole\r\nsubject of volunteer aid to the army. The committee came to the\r\nconclusion, after some weeks' observation in and about Washington, that\r\nneither the Government, the War Department, the Bureau, the army, nor\r\nthe people understood the gigantic nature of the business entered upon,\r\nor were half prepared to meet the necessities which must in a few weeks\r\nor months fall crushingly upon them. Such facts convinced them of the\r\nnecessity of a much more extensive system than had been contemplated at\r\nthe period of their organization, and thus the idea of a Sanitary\r\nCommission, with an office and resident staff at Washington, presented\r\nitself to them as alone able to meet the views of the Central\r\nAssociation and the emergencies of the case. The ordering of a Sanitary\r\nCommission _without rights or powers_ was finally granted, the _duties_\r\nbeing enough to satisfy the most active. The order for the Commission\r\nwas issued by the Secretary of War June 9th, and approved by the\r\nPresident June 13th, 1861. Women feel that our soldiers belong to the\r\n_nation_, and thus local, and personal prejudices have yielded to the\r\ntruly _federal_ principles of the Sanitary Commission. They are\r\nwithdrawn from local politics, and have felt the assault upon the life\r\nof the nation in its true national aspect. They have been the first to\r\nappreciate and understand the all-embracing duties of the Sanitary\r\nCommission. With Milwaukee, Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Louisville,\r\nPittsburg, Philadelphia, New York, Brooklyn, New Haven, Hartford,\r\nProvidence, Boston, Portland, and Concord for centres, there are at\r\nleast 15,000 Soldiers' Aid Societies, all under the control of women,\r\nemployed in supplying, through the Sanitary Commission, the wants of the\r\nsick and wounded in the great Federal Army. The skill and business\r\nenergies of the women managing the vast operations of the chief centres\r\nof supply unfold a new and glowing page in the history of the capacities\r\nof the sex.\r\n\r\nWhy does the Sanitary Commission need so much money? Because the present\r\nmachinery of the Commission, supported by the Central Treasury cannot be\r\nkept in motion without large expenditures; and large as the cost is, the\r\nresults for good are almost infinitely larger. The Sanitary distributes\r\nthe supplies sent, embraces Sanitary Inspection by medical men of\r\ngeneral hospitals, Sanitary Inspection by medical men of camps and field\r\nhospitals, Special Relief with all its agencies and in all its various\r\ndepartments, and the Hospital Directory with its register and its\r\n500,000 names. Every dollar expended meets some real want, or helps to\r\nsave a life. Do the people wish this agency in behalf of the soldiers in\r\ntent, hospital, and on the battle field--at the East--West--South, to\r\ncease? or is it their will to continue it in its largeness of plan, its\r\nscientific exactness, its ability to do all that the friends at home\r\nwould themselves desire to do for our soldiers? Our generous and loyal\r\npeople have given their entire confidence to the Sanitary\r\nCommission--they have decided that it shall not die for lack of material\r\naid, estimating beyond all money and all price the lives and health of\r\nthe brave men now in the field for the defence of the country, and\r\ngrateful that they may repose in the certitude that every cent\r\ncontributed will be used in the surest manner to effect the results\r\nrequired. To aid in sustaining this beneficent institution, New York is\r\nabout to inaugurate a great Metropolitan Fair. She asks in the sacred\r\nname of freedom and humanity that her children come together with the\r\nworks of their hands, the results of their enterprise, the achievements\r\nof their talents, the bloom of their genius, to do her honor in a Great\r\nExhibition of Art, Industry, Commerce, all devoted to the cause of human\r\nprogress. She begs of her children to do the work which is given them to\r\ndo, with a spirit of love and patriotism, remembering no private griefs,\r\nno unworthy animosities; remembering only the bleeding sons of the\r\nRepublic, who threw themselves, in their youth and strength, into the\r\nyawning gulf which opened before them, hoping that, propitiated by such\r\na sacrifice, it might close again--willing to die, or live maimed and\r\nsuffering, that a happy, peaceful and united people might again possess\r\nthe fairest land which God has given to mankind. Chicago, Cincinnati,\r\nand Boston have already done nobly in this direction, and New York\r\nshould contribute in proportion to her means and advantages. The\r\nAtlantic seaboard should make great exertions, seeing that more than one\r\nhalf of the money received by the Commission has been contributed from\r\nthe shores of the Pacific--California having sent more than five hundred\r\nand twenty-five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Managers of the Fair invite all Merchants, Manufacturers, and\r\nArtisans to contribute of their wares to its stores, giving such goods\r\nas they make or deal in--such goods as are made profitable to them by\r\nthe prosperity of the country which our soldiers are fighting to\r\nmaintain.\r\n\r\nPainters and Sculptors, who have done so much for the honor of their\r\ncountry, all who are connected with the Fine Arts, either as creators,\r\nas dealers, or possessors of Art Treasures, are asked to send their\r\ncontributions for _exhibition_ or _sale_.\r\n\r\nFarmers are invited to bring to the Fair gifts from their barns, stalls,\r\ndairies, and poultry yards.\r\n\r\nPublishers and Booksellers are confidently looked to for aid. A\r\n_Second-hand Book Stall_ will be attached to this Department, to which\r\ncontributions are asked from the shelves of those who are cumbered with\r\nduplicate copies, or who have books which they no longer use. Connected\r\nwith this Department will be a table for the exposition and sale of\r\nvaluable Autographs.\r\n\r\nOn the Musicians, Musical Instrument Makers, and Music Dealers, the\r\nManagers confidently rely for a worthy representation of the beautiful\r\nart of which they are ministers, by the giving of Musical Performances\r\nand of instruments and music for sale.\r\n\r\nThe Managers and Artists of the various Theatres are invited to set\r\napart one evening during the Fair, the performances on which shall be\r\nfor the benefit of the fund.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the Public Schools and Public Institutions of a\r\nbenevolent character may contribute in some fitting manner to the Fair.\r\n\r\nIt is also hoped, from the well-known patriotism of the Fire Department\r\nand the Police, that they will bear an honorable and conspicuous part in\r\nthis life-preserving and humane undertaking.\r\n\r\nA Department of Arms and Trophies will be established, to which not only\r\narms and flags captured in the present war, but all articles of this\r\nkind having a historic or intrinsic interest, will be acceptable\r\ncontributions, either for sale or exhibition.\r\n\r\nAn Old Curiosity Shop will afford all who have interesting relics of the\r\npast in their possession an opportunity to enable others to share the\r\npleasure of examining them. Valuable contributions have been already\r\nreceived in this department. Let it be clearly stated whether articles\r\nof this kind are for sale or only for exhibition.\r\n\r\nA Newspaper will be published daily, which, in addition to the latest\r\ntelegraphic news, will contain short and piquant articles upon the\r\nincidents of the day, and especially of the Fair.\r\n\r\nA Post Office will also be established.\r\n\r\nA Restaurant will be under the charge of an accomplished public caterer.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that, so far as practicable, each city in the State\r\ndesiring that its contributions shall be kept together, shall have a\r\nseparate space set apart for them, and that each of these cities shall\r\nbe represented in the General Committee of Management.\r\n\r\nA certain number of each Executive Committee will be at its Office--the\r\nLadies at No. 2 Great Jones street, the Gentlemen at No. 842\r\nBroadway--every day, from 10 A. M. to 4 P. M.\r\n\r\nContributions are to be sent to the Receiving Depot, No. 2 Great Jones\r\nstreet, where they will be credited to their givers, and their receipt\r\nacknowledged by the proper committee.\r\n\r\nIt is particularly requested that each contribution be plainly marked\r\nwith the name of the contributor, for exposition during the Fair, and\r\nthat each article be accompanied by a memorandum of its value.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGULATIONS.\r\n\r\n1. Every application by note for contributions shall be upon paper\r\nbearing the symbol of the Fair, and signed in writing by a member of the\r\nExecutive Committee; and every member of a special committee shall be\r\nprovided with a similar certificate of authority.\r\n\r\n2. It is earnestly requested that all contributions in money be sent to\r\nthe Treasurer, to whose order all checks should be made payable.\r\n\r\n3. At the Fair, every article shall be sold at its current value, when\r\nthat is determinable.\r\n\r\n4. In all raffles, the number of tickets sold shall not exceed the\r\noriginal valuation of the articles raffled for.\r\n\r\n5. No person shall be importuned to buy articles or tickets for raffles.\r\n\r\n6. In every department, a cashier shall be appointed to receive money\r\nand make change.\r\n\r\n7. No punch shall be sold.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS.\r\n\r\nLadies' Association.\r\n\r\n  MRS. HAMILTON FISH, _President_.\r\n   \"   DAVID LANE, _Vice-President_.\r\n   \"   A. V.

Janes.\r\n\r\nWe have deemed it best thus to gather together from all available\r\nsources all the information we could glean from the circulars, etc., of\r\nthe Metropolitan Fair, with the names of its officers, and the addresses\r\nof the Executive Committees, that we might give all possible information\r\nto our widely spread circle of readers. We give, from the excellent\r\narticle in the January number of the _North American Review_ already\r\nquoted, a vivid description of scenes occurring in the great Northwest,\r\nupon a similar occasion.\r\n\r\n     'In Chicago, for instance, the Branch has lately held a fair of\r\n     colossal proportions, to which the whole Northwest was invited to\r\n     send supplies, and to come in mass! On the 26th of October last,\r\n     when it opened, a procession of three miles in length, composed of\r\n     wagon loads of supplies, and of people in various ways interested,\r\n     paraded through the streets of Chicago; the stores being closed,\r\n     and the day given up to patriotic sympathies. For fourteen days the\r\n     fair lasted, and every day brought reënforcements of supplies, and\r\n     of people and purchasers. The country people, from hundreds of\r\n     miles about, sent in upon the railroads all the various products of\r\n     their farms, mills, and hands. Those who had nothing else sent the\r\n     poultry from their barnyards; the ox or bull or calf from the\r\n     stall; the title deed of a few acres of land; so many bushels of\r\n     grain, or potatoes, or onions. Loads of hay, even, were sent in\r\n     from ten or a dozen miles out, and sold at once in the hay market.\r\n     On the roads entering the city were seen rickety and lumbering\r\n     wagons, made of poles, loaded with a mixed freight,--a few\r\n     cabbages, a bundle of socks, a coop of tame ducks, a few barrels of\r\n     turnips, a pot of butter, and a bag of beans,--with the proud and\r\n     humane farmer driving the team, his wife behind in charge of the\r\n     baby, while two or three little children contended with the boxes\r\n     and barrels and bundles for room to sit or lie. Such were the\r\n     evidences of devotion and self-sacrificing zeal the Northwestern\r\n     farmers gave, as, in their long trains of wagons, they trundled\r\n     into Chicago, from twenty and thirty miles' distance, and unloaded\r\n     their contents at the doors of the Northwestern Fair, for the\r\n     benefit of the United States Sanitary Commission. The mechanics and\r\n     artisans of the towns and cities were not behind the farmers. Each\r\n     manufacturer sent his best piano, plough, threshing machine, or\r\n     sewing machine. Every form of agricultural implement, and every\r\n     product of mechanical skill, was represented. From the watchmaker's\r\n     jewelry to horse shoes and harness; from lace, cloth, cotton, and\r\n     linen, to iron and steel; from wooden and waxen and earthen ware to\r\n     butter and cheese, bacon and beef;--nothing came amiss, and nothing\r\n     failed to come, and the ordering of all this was in the hands of\r\n     women. They fed in the restaurant, under 'the Fair,' at fifty cents\r\n     a meal, 1,500 mouths a day, for a fortnight, from food furnished,\r\n     cooked, and served by the women of Chicago; and so orderly and\r\n     convenient, so practical and wise were the arrangements, that, day\r\n     by day, they had just what they had ordered and what they counted\r\n     on, always enough, and never too much. They divided the houses of\r\n     the town, and levied on No. 16 A street, for five turkeys, on\r\n     Monday; No. 37 B street, for 12 apple pies, on Tuesday; No. 49 C\r\n     street, for forty pounds of roast beef, on Wednesday; No. 23 D\r\n     street was to furnish so much pepper on Thursday; No. 33 E street,\r\n     so much salt on Friday. In short, every preparation was made in\r\n     advance, at the least inconvenience possible to the people, to\r\n     distribute in the most equal manner the welcome burden of feeding\r\n     the visitors at the fair, at the expense of the good people of\r\n     Chicago, but for the pecuniary benefit of the Sanitary Commission.\r\n     Hundreds of lovely young girls, in simple uniforms, took their\r\n     places as waiters behind the vast array of tables, and everybody\r\n     was as well served as at a first-class hotel, at a less expense to\r\n     himself, and with a great profit to the fair. Fifty thousand\r\n     dollars, it is said, will be the least net return of this gigantic\r\n     fair to the treasury of the Branch at Chicago.'\r\n\r\nWe cannot believe that there is the least necessity to urge upon our\r\ngenerous people the absolute _duty_ of contributing largely to the\r\nsupport of the Sanitary Commission, the strong and helpful angel of our\r\nbloody battle fields. Our sick soldiers, burning with fever, shivering\r\nwith the debility of disease, with pallid faces and emaciated frames,\r\nask from us that its healing dews shall still be suffered to descend\r\nupon them. Stricken down upon the battle field in the full bloom of\r\nmanly vigor, lying festering in their ghastly wounds among the dead and\r\ndying, exposed to the dews of night, the broiling fervors of the midday\r\nsun, we may hear them implore us that the ambulances of the Sanitary may\r\nbe allowed to aid in bringing them shelter, aid, strength to live, or\r\npatience to die. Bleeding stumps of manly limbs are piteously held forth\r\nto us that surgeons may be supplied for amputation, that balls buried in\r\nthe flesh or lodged in the bone may be extracted by hands skilful in the\r\nuse of knife and probe. Let these brave fellows feel that the arms of\r\nthe men and women of this country are clasped around them in sustaining\r\nlove. Ah, have we not all dear ones in this grand army? answer me, fair\r\nand true daughters of our soil.\r\n\r\n  'The subtile sense, the faith intense, of woman's heart and brain,\r\n  Give her a prophet's power to see, to suffer, and maintain.'\r\n\r\nLet us not stop to measure what is prudent for us to give, but let us\r\ngive freely, promptly, as we would do if we saw before us the suffering\r\nvictims of this holy war! Every dollar may save a life, every penny a\r\npang. O God! shall we stop to count pence with our stricken brave\r\n_dying_ and bleeding before us? Every gift, however small, from a loyal\r\nsoul, will be greeted, every good giver welcomed. Let us listen to the\r\nmost sublime of all music, the great heart-throbs of a free people\r\nchiming together in the vigorous rhythm of the Divine charities. Let our\r\nnation comprehend from within the march of its vast destinies, its true\r\nand ever-growing force in the love and self-sacrifice of its children.\r\nLet the benediction of our American Evangel, 'All men are born free and\r\nequal,' sound on until all voices swell in the grand diapason of\r\neverywhere harmonious and united Humanity, for this is the strength of\r\nman and the true meaning of our Union.\r\n\r\n  'From the vine-land, from the Rhine-land,\r\n    From the Shannon, from the Scheldt,\r\n  From the ancient homes of genius,\r\n    From the sainted home of Celt,\r\n  From Italy, from Hungary,\r\n    All as brothers join and come,\r\n  To the sinew-bearing bugle\r\n    And the foot-propelling drum:\r\n  Too glad beneath the starry flag to die, and keep secure\r\n  The Liberty they dreamed of by the Danube, Elbe, and Suir.'\r\n\r\nLet us at least prove ourselves worthy of the century in which we live,\r\nand show the astonished world how a free people honors, guards, cares\r\nfor, and shelters its suffering heroes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Or Black Head. There is great confusion in names in this part of the\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n[2] Dr. Neumann has removed from Munich to Berlin within a year past.\r\n\r\n[3] Now over 3,000 miles.\r\n\r\n[4] Now 2,907 miles.\r\n\r\n[5] For most of these facts, see Article on the Sanitary Commission in\r\nthe _North American Review_ for January, 1864.",
