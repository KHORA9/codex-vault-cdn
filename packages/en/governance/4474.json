Pretty Mrs. Blathenoy was Nataly's first afternoon visitor, and\r\nwas graciously received; no sign of inquiry for the cause of the lady's\r\nalacrity to greet her being shown.  Colney Durance came in, bringing the\r\nrumour of an Australian cantatrice to kindle Europe; Mr. Peridon, a\r\nseeker of tidings from the city of Bourges; Miss Priscilla Graves,\r\nreporting of Skepsey, in a holiday Sunday tone, that his alcoholic\r\npartner might at any moment release him; Mr. Septimus Barmby, with a\r\nhanged heavy look, suggestive of a wharfside crane swinging the ponderous\r\nthing he had to say.  'I have seen Miss Radnor.'\r\n\r\n'She was well?' the mother asked, and the grand basso pitched forth an\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\n'Dear sweet girl she is!' Mrs. Blathenoy exclaimed to Colney.\r\n\r\nHe bowed.  'Very sweet.  And can let fly on you, like a haggis, for a\r\nscratch.'\r\n\r\nShe laughed, glad of an escape from the conversational formalities\r\nimposed on her by this Mrs. Victor Radnor's mighty manner.  'But what\r\ngirl worth anything!  .  .  .\r\n\r\nWe all can do that, I hope, for a scratch!'\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby's Profession dissented.\r\n\r\nMr. Catkin appeared; ten minutes after his Peridon.  He had met Victor\r\nnear the Exchange, and had left him humming the non fu sogno of ERNANI.\r\n\r\n'Ah, when Victor takes to Verdi, it's a flat City, and wants a burst of\r\ndrum and brass,' Colney said; and he hummed a few bars of the march in\r\nAttila, and shrugged.  He and Victor had once admired that blatancy.\r\n\r\nMr. Pempton appeared, according to anticipation.  He sat himself beside\r\nPriscilla.  Entered Mrs. John Cormyn, voluminous; Mrs. Peter Yatt,\r\neffervescent; Nataly's own people were about her and she felt at home.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy pushed a small thorn into it, by speaking of Captain\r\nFenellan, and aside, as if sharing him with her.  Nataly heard that\r\nDartrey had been the guest of these Blathenoys.  Even Dartrey was but a\r\nman!\r\n\r\nRather lower under her voice, the vain little creature asked: 'You knew\r\nher?'\r\n\r\n'Her?'\r\n\r\nThe cool counter-interrogation was disregarded.  'So sad!  In the desert!\r\na cup of pure water worth more than barrow-loads of gold!  Poor woman!'\r\n\r\n'Who?'\r\n\r\n'His wife.'\r\n\r\n'Wife!'\r\n\r\n'They were married?'\r\n\r\nNataly could have cried: Snake!  Her play at brevity had certainly been\r\nfoiled.  She nodded gravely.  A load of dusky wonders and speculations\r\npressed at her bosom.  She disdained to question the mouth which had\r\nbitten her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy, resolving, that despite the jealousy she excited, she\r\nwould have her friend in Captain Fenellan, whom she liked--liked, she was\r\nsure, quite as innocently as any other woman of his acquaintance did,\r\ndeparted and she hugged her innocence defiantly, with the mournful pride\r\nwhich will sometimes act as a solvent.\r\n\r\nA remark or two passed among the company upon her pretty face.\r\n\r\nNataly murmured to Colney: 'Is there anything of Dartrey's wife?'\r\n\r\n'Dead,' he answered.\r\n\r\n'When?'\r\n\r\n'Months back.  I had it from Simeon.  You didn't hear?'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.  Her ears buzzed.  If he had it from Simeon Fenellan,\r\nVictor must have known it.\r\n\r\nHer duties of hostess were conducted with the official smile.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she stood alone, she dropped on a chair, like one who has\r\ntaken a shot in the heart, and that hideous tumult of wild cries at her\r\nears blankly ceased.  Dartrey, Victor, Nesta, were shifting figures of\r\nthe might-have-been for whom a wretched erring woman, washed clean of her\r\nguilt by death, in a far land, had gone to her end: vainly gone: and now\r\nanother was here, a figure of wood, in man's shape, conjured up by one of\r\nthe three, to divide the two others; likely to be fatal to her or to\r\nthem: to her, she hoped, if the choice was to be: and beneath the leaden\r\nhope, her heart set to a rapid beating, a fainter, a chill at the core.\r\n\r\nShe snatched for breath.  She shut her eyes, and with open lips, lay\r\nwaiting; prepared to thank the kindness about to hurry her hence, out of\r\nthe seas of pain, without pain.\r\n\r\nThen came sighs.  The sad old servant in her bosom was resuming his\r\nlabours.\r\n\r\nBut she had been near it--very near it?  A gush of pity for Victor,\r\noverwhelmed her hardness of mind.\r\n\r\nUnreflectingly, she tried her feet to support her, and tottered to the\r\ndoor, touched along to the stairs, and descended them, thinking strangely\r\nupon such a sudden weakness of body, when she would no longer have\r\nthought herself the weak woman.  Her aim was to reach the library.  She\r\nsat on the stairs midway, pondering over the length of her journey: and\r\nnow her head was clearer; for she was travelling to get Railway-guides,\r\nand might have had them from the hands of a footman, and imagined that\r\nshe had considered it prudent to hide her investigation of those books:\r\nproofs of an understanding fallen backward to the state of infant and\r\nhaving to begin our drear ascent again.\r\n\r\nA slam of the kitchen stair-door restored her.  She betrayed no infirmity\r\nof footing as she walked past Arlington in the hall; and she was alive to\r\nthe voice of Skepsey presently on the door-steps.  Arlington brought her\r\na note.\r\n\r\nVictor had written: 'My love, I dine with Blathenoy in the City, at the\r\nWalworth.  Business.  Skepsey for clothes.  Eight of us.  Formal.  A\r\nthousand embraces.  Late.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey was ushered in.  His wife had expired at noon, he said; and he\r\npostured decorously the grief he could not feel, knowing that a lady\r\nwould expect it of him.  His wife had fallen down stone steps; she died\r\nin hospital.  He wished to say, she was no loss to the country; but he\r\nwas advised within of the prudence of abstaining from comment and\r\ntrusting to his posture, and he squeezed a drop of conventional\r\nsensibility out of it, and felt improved.\r\n\r\nNataly sent a line to Victor: 'Dearest, I go to bed early, am tired.\r\nDine well.  Come to me in the morning.'\r\n\r\nShe reproached herself for coldness to poor Skepsey, when he had gone.\r\nThe prospect of her being alone until the morning had been so absorbing a\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nShe found a relief also in work at the book of the trains.  A walk to the\r\ntelegraph-station strengthened her.  Especially after despatching a\r\ntelegram to Mr. Dudley Sowerby at Cronidge, and one to Nesta at\r\nMoorsedge, did she become stoutly nerved.  The former was requested to\r\nmeet her at Penhurst station at noon.  Nesta was to be at the station for\r\nthe Wells at three o'clock.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the flying of these telegrams, up to the tap of Victor's\r\nknuckle on her bed-room door next morning, she was not more reflectively\r\nconscious than a packet travelling to its destination by pneumatic tube.\r\nNor was she acutely impressionable to the features and the voice she\r\nloved.\r\n\r\n'You know of Skepsey?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Ah, poor Skepsey!'  Victor frowned and heaved.\r\n\r\n'One of us ought to stand beside him at the funeral.'\r\n\r\n'Colney or Fenellan?'\r\n\r\n'I will ask Mr. Durance.'\r\n\r\n'Do, my darling.'\r\n\r\n'Victor, you did not tell me of Dartrey's wife.'\r\n\r\n'There again!  They all get released!  Yes, Dartrey! Dartrey has his luck\r\ntoo.'\r\n\r\nShe closed her eyes, with the desire to be asleep.\r\n\r\n'You should have told me, dear.'\r\n\r\n'Well, my love!  Well--poor Dartrey!  I fancy I hadn't a confirmation of\r\nthe news.  I remember a horrible fit of envy on hearing the hint: not\r\nmuch more than a hint: serious illness, was it?--or expected event.\r\nHardly worth while to trouble my dear soul, till certain.  Anything about\r\nwives, forces me to think of myself--my better self!'\r\n\r\n'I had to hear of it first from Mrs. Blathenoy.'\r\n\r\n'You've heard of duels in dark rooms:--that was the case between\r\nBlathenoy and me last night for an hour.'\r\n\r\nShe feigned somnolent fatigue over her feverish weariness of heart.  He\r\nkissed her on the forehead.\r\n\r\nHer spell-bound intention to speak of Dudley Sowerby to him, was broken\r\nby the sounding of the hall-door, thirty minutes later.  She had lain in\r\na trance.\r\n\r\nLife surged to her with the thought, that she could decide and take her\r\nstep.  Many were the years back since she had taken a step; less\r\nindependently then than now; unregretted, if fatal.  Her brain was heated\r\nfor the larger view of things and the swifter summing of them.  It could\r\nput the man at a remove from her and say, that she had lived with him and\r\nsuffered intensely.  It gathered him to her breast rejoicing in their\r\nunion: the sharper the scourge, the keener the exultation.  But she had\r\none reproach to deafen and beat down.  This did not come on her from the\r\nworld: she and the world were too much foot to foot on the antagonist's\r\nline, for her to listen humbly.  It came of her quick summary survey of\r\nhim, which was unnoticed by the woman's present fiery mind as being new\r\nor strange in any way: simply it was a fact she now read; and it directed\r\nher to reproach herself for an abasement beneath his leadership, a blind\r\nsubserviency and surrender of her faculties to his greater powers, such\r\nas no soul of a breathing body should yield to man: not to the highest,\r\nnot to the Titan, not to the most Godlike of men.  Under cloak, they\r\ndemand it.  They demand their bane.\r\n\r\nAnd Victor!  .  .  .  She had seen into him.\r\n\r\nThe reproach on her was, that she, in her worship, had been slave, not\r\nhelper.  Scarcely was she irreproachable in the character of slave.  If\r\nit had been utter slave! she phrased the words, for a further reproach.\r\nShe remembered having at times murmured, dissented.  And it would have\r\nbeen a desperate proud thought to comfort a slave, that never once had\r\nshe known even a secret opposition to the will of her lord.\r\n\r\nBut she had: she recalled instances.  Up they rose; up rose everything\r\nher mind ranged over, subsiding immediately when the service was done.\r\nShe had not conceived her beloved to be infallible, surest of guides in\r\nall earthly-matters.  Her intellect had sometimes protested.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, had moved her to swamp it?\r\n\r\nHer heart answered.  And that heart also was arraigned: and the heart's\r\nfleshly habitation acting on it besides: so flagellant of herself was\r\nshe: covertly, however, and as the chaste among women can consent to let\r\nour animal face them.  Not grossly, still perceptibly to her penetrative\r\nhard eye on herself, she saw the senses of the woman under a charm.  She\r\nsaw, and swam whirling with a pang of revolt from her personal being and\r\nthis mortal kind.\r\n\r\nHer rational intelligence righted her speedily.  She could say in truth,\r\nby proof, she loved the man: nature's love, heart's love, soul's love.\r\nShe had given him her life.\r\n\r\nIt was a happy cross-current recollection, that the very beginning and\r\nspring of this wild cast of her life, issued from something he said and\r\ndid (merest of airy gestures) to signify the blessing of life--how good\r\nand fair it is.  A drooping mood in her had been struck; he had a look\r\nlike the winged lyric up in blue heavens: he raised the head of the young\r\nflower from its contemplation of grave-mould.  That was when he had much\r\nto bear: Mrs. Burman present: and when the stranger in their household\r\nhad begun to pity him and have a dread of her feelings.  The lucent\r\nsplendour of his eyes was memorable, a light above the rolling oceans of\r\nTime.\r\n\r\nShe had given him her life, little aid.  She might have closely\r\ncounselled, wound in and out with his ideas.  Sensible of capacity, she\r\nconfessed to the having been morally subdued, physically as well; swept\r\nonward; and she was arrested now by an accident, like a waif of the\r\nriver-floods by the dip of a branch.  Time that it should be!  But was\r\nnot Mr. Durance, inveighing against the favoured system for the education\r\nof women, right when he declared them to be unfitted to speak an opinion\r\non any matter external to the household or in a crisis of the household?\r\nShe had not agreed with him: he presented stinging sentences, which\r\nirritated more than they enlightened.  Now it seemed to her, that the\r\nmodel women of men make pleasant slaves, not true mates: they lack the\r\nworldly training to know themselves or take a grasp of circumstances.\r\n\r\nThere is an exotic fostering of the senses for women, not the\r\nstrengthening breath of vital common air.  If good fortune is with them,\r\nall may go well: the stake of their fates is upon the perpetual smooth\r\nflow of good fortune.  She had never joined to the cry of the women.  Few\r\namong them were having it in the breast as loudly.\r\n\r\nHard on herself, too, she perceived how the social rebel had reduced her\r\nmind to propitiate a simulacrum, reflected from out, of an enthroned\r\nSociety within it, by an advocacy of the existing laws and rules and\r\nhabits.  Eminently servile is the tolerated lawbreaker: none so\r\nconservative.  Not until we are driven back upon an unviolated Nature,\r\ndo we call to the intellect to think radically: and then we begin to\r\nthink of our fellows.\r\n\r\nOr when we have set ourselves in motion direct for the doing of the right\r\nthing: have quitted the carriage at the station, and secured the ticket,\r\nand entered the train, counting the passage of time for a simple rapid\r\nhour before we have eased heart in doing justice to ourself and to\r\nanother; then likewise the mind is lighted for radiation.  That doing of\r\nthe right thing, after a term of paralysis, cowardice--any evil name--\r\nis one of the mighty reliefs, equal to happiness, of longer duration.\r\n\r\nNataly had it.  But her mind was actually radiating, and the comfort to\r\nher heart evoked the image of Dartrey Fenellan.  She saw a possible\r\nreason for her bluntness to the coming scene with Dudley.\r\n\r\nAt once she said, No!  and closed the curtain; knowing what was behind,\r\ncounting it nought.  She repeated almost honestly her positive negative.\r\nHow we are mixed of the many elements!  she thought, as an observer; and\r\nself-justifyingly thought on, and with truth, that duty urged her upon\r\nthis journey; and proudly thought, that she had not a shock of the\r\npainful great organ in her breast at the prospect at the end, or any\r\napprehension of its failure to carry her through.\r\n\r\nYet the need of peace or some solace needed to prepare her for her\r\ninterview turned her imagination burningly on Dartrey.  She would not\r\nallow herself to meditate over hopes and schemes:--Nesta free: Dartrey\r\nfree.  She vowed to her soul sacredly--and she was one of those in whom\r\nthe Divinity lives, that they may do so--not to speak a word for the\r\ninfluencing of Dudley save the one fact.  Consequently, for a personal\r\nindulgence, she mused; she caressed maternally the object of her musing;\r\nof necessity, she excluded Nesta; but in tenderness she gave Dartrey a\r\nfair one to love him.\r\n\r\nThe scene was waved away.  That one so loving him, partly worthy of him,\r\nready to traverse the world now beside him--who could it be other than\r\nshe who knew and prized his worth?  Foolish!  It is one of the hatefuller\r\nscourges upon women whenever, a little shaken themselves, they muse upon\r\nsome man's image, that they cannot put in motion the least bit of drama\r\nwithout letting feminine self play a part; generally to develop into a\r\nprincipal part.  .  . The apology makes it a melancholy part.\r\n\r\nDartrey's temper of the caged lion dominated by his tamer, served as\r\nkeynote for any amount of saddest colouring.  He controlled the brute:\r\nbut he held the contempt of danger, the love of strife, the passion for\r\nadventure; he had crossed the desert of human anguish.  He of all men\r\nrequired a devoted mate, merited her.  Of all men living, he was the\r\nhardest to match with a woman--with a woman deserving him.\r\n\r\nThe train had quitted London.  Now for the country, now for free\r\nbreathing!  She who two days back had come from Alps, delighted in the\r\nlook on flat green fields.  It was under the hallucination of her saying\r\nin flight adieu to them, and to England; and, that somewhere hidden, to\r\nbe found in Asia, Africa, America, was the man whose ideal of life was\r\nhigher than enjoyment.  His caged brute of a temper offered opportunities\r\nfor delicious petting; the sweetest a woman can bestow: it lifts her out\r\nof timidity into an adoration still palpitatingly fearful.  Ah, but\r\nfamiliarity, knowledge, confirmed assurance of his character, lift her to\r\nanother stage, above the pleasures.  May she not prove to him how really\r\nmatched with him she is, to disdain the pleasures, cheerfully accept the\r\nburdens, meet death, if need be; readily face it as the quietly grey to-\r\nmorrow: at least, show herself to her hero for a woman--the incredible\r\nbeing to most men--who treads the terrors as well as the pleasures of\r\nhumanity beneath her feet, and may therefore have some pride in her\r\nstature.  Ay, but only to feel the pride of standing not so shamefully\r\nbelow his level beside him.\r\n\r\nWoods were flying past the carriage-windows.  Her solitary companion was\r\nof the class of the admiring gentlemen.  Presently he spoke.  She\r\nanswered.  He spoke again.  Her mouth smiled, and her accompanying look\r\nof abstract benevolence arrested the tentative allurement to\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nNew ideas were set revolving in her.  Dartrey and Victor grew to a\r\nlikeness; they became hazily one man, and the mingled phantom\r\ncomplimented her on her preserving a good share of the beauty of her\r\nyouth.  The face perhaps: the figure rather too well suits the years!\r\nshe replied.  To reassure her, this Dartrey-Victor drew her close and\r\nkissed her; and she was confused and passed into the breast of Mrs.\r\nBurman expecting an operation at the hands of the surgeons.  The train\r\nhad stopped.  'Penhurst?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Penhurst is the next station,' said the gentleman.  Here was a theme for\r\nhim!  The stately mansion, the noble grounds, and Sidney!  He discoursed\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe handsome lady appeared interested.  She was interested also by his\r\ndescription of a neighbouring village, likely one hundred years hence to\r\nbe a place of pilgrimage for Americans and for Australians.  Age, he\r\nsaid, improves true beauty; and his eyelids indicated a levelling to\r\nperform the soft intentness.  Mechanically, a ball rose in her throat;\r\nthe remark was illuminated by a saying of Colney's, with regard to his\r\ncountrymen at the play of courtship.  No laughter came.  The gentleman\r\ntalked on.\r\n\r\nAll fancies and internal communications left her.  Slowness of motion\r\nbrought her to the plain piece of work she had to do, on a colourless\r\nearth, that seemed foggy; but one could see one's way.  Resolution is a\r\nform of light, our native light in this dubious world.\r\n\r\nDudley Sowerby opened her carriage-door.  They greeted.\r\n\r\n'You have seen Nesta?' she said.\r\n\r\n'Not for two days.  You have not heard?  The Miss Duvidneys have gone to\r\nBrighton.'\r\n\r\n'They are rather in advance of the Season.'\r\n\r\nShe thanked him for meeting her.  He was grateful for the summons.\r\n\r\nInforming the mother of his betrothed, that he had ridden over from\r\nCronidge, he speculated on the place to select for her luncheon, and he\r\nspoke of his horse being led up and down outside the station.  Nataly\r\ninquired for the hour of the next train to London.  He called to one of\r\nthe porters, obtained and imparted the time; evidently now, as shown by\r\nan unevenness of his lifted brows, expecting news of some little weight.\r\n\r\n'Your husband is quite well?' he said, in affection for the name of\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n'Mr. Radnor is well; I have to speak to you; I have more than time.'\r\n\r\n'You will lunch at the inn?'\r\n\r\n'I shall not eat.  We will walk.'\r\n\r\nThey crossed the road and passed under trees.\r\n\r\n'My mother was to have called on the Miss Duvidneys.  They left\r\nhurriedly; I think it was unanticipated by Nesta.  I venture .  .  .  you\r\npardon the liberty .  .  .  she allows me to entertain hopes.  Mr.\r\nRadnor, I am hardly too bold in thinking .  .  .  I trust, in appealing\r\nto you .  .  .  at least I can promise!\r\n\r\n'Mr. Sowerby, you have done my daughter the honour to ask her hand in\r\nmarriage.'\r\n\r\nHe said: 'I have,' and had much to say besides, but deferred: a blow was\r\nvisible.  The father had been more encouraging to him than the mother.\r\n\r\n'You have not known of any circumstance that might cause hesitation in\r\nasking?'\r\n\r\n'Miss Radnor?'\r\n\r\n'My daughter:--you have to think of your family.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, Mrs. Radnor, I was coming to London tomorrow, with the consent\r\nof my family.'\r\n\r\n'You address me as Mrs. Radnor.  I have not the legal right to the name.'\r\n\r\n'Not legal!' said he, with a catch at the word.\r\n\r\nHe spun round in her sight, though his demeanour was manfully rigid.\r\n\r\n'Have I understood, madam .  .  . ?'\r\n\r\n'You would not request me to repeat it.  Is that your horse the man is\r\nleading?'\r\n\r\n'My horse: it must be my horse.'\r\n\r\n'Mount and ride back.  Leave me: I shall not eat.  Reflect, by yourself.\r\nYou are in a position of one who is not allowed to decide by his\r\nfeelings.  Mr. Radnor you know where to find.'\r\n\r\n'But surely, some food?  I cannot have misapprehended?'\r\n\r\n'I cannot eat.  I think you have understood me clearly.'\r\n\r\n'You wish me to go?'\r\n\r\n'I beg.'\r\n\r\n'It pains me, dear madam.'\r\n\r\n'It relieves me, if you will.  Here is your horse.'\r\n\r\nShe gave her hand.  He touched it and bent.  He looked at her.  A surge\r\nof impossible questions rolled to his mouth and rolled back, with the\r\nthought of an incredible thing, that her manner, more than her words,\r\nheld him from doubting.\r\n\r\n'I obey you,' he said.\r\n\r\n'You are kind.'\r\n\r\nHe mounted horse, raised hat, paced on, and again bowing, to one of the\r\nwayside trees, cantered.  The man was gone; but not from Nataly's vision\r\nthat face of wet chalk under one of the shades of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nIN WHICH WE SEE A CONVENTIONAL GENTLEMAN ENDEAVOURING TO EXAMINE A\r\nSPECTRE OF HIMSELF\r\n\r\nDudley rode back to Cronidge with his thunderstroke.  It filled him,\r\nas in those halls of political clamour, where explanatory speech is not\r\naccepted, because of a drowning tide of hot blood on both sides.  He\r\nsought to win attention by submitting a resolution, to the effect, that\r\nhe would the next morning enter into the presence of Mr. Victor Radnor,\r\nbearing his family's feelings, for a discussion upon them.  But the\r\nbrutish tumult, in addition to surcharging, encased him: he could not\r\nrightly conceive the nature of feelings: men were driving shoals; he had\r\nlost hearing and touch of individual men; had become a house of angrily\r\nopposing parties.\r\n\r\nHe was hurt, he knew; and therefore he supposed himself injured, though\r\nthere were contrary outcries, and he admitted that he stood free; he had\r\nnot been inextricably deceived.\r\n\r\nThe girl was caught away to the thinnest of wisps in a dust-whirl.\r\nReverting to the father and mother, his idea of a positive injury, that\r\nwas not without its congratulations, sank him down among his disordered\r\ndeeper sentiments; which were a diver's wreck, where an armoured livid\r\nsubtermarine, a monstrous puff-ball of man, wandered seriously light in\r\nheaviness; trembling his hundredweights to keep him from dancing like a\r\nbladder-block of elastic lumber; thinking occasionally, amid the mournful\r\nspectacle, of the atmospheric pipe of communication with the world above,\r\nwhereby he was deafened yet sustained.  One tug at it, and he was up on\r\nthe surface, disengaged from the hideous harness, joyfully no more that\r\nburly phantom cleaving green slime, free!  and the roaring stopped; the\r\nworld looked flat, foreign, a place of crusty promise.  His wreck,\r\nanimated by the dim strange fish below, appeared fairer; it winked\r\nlurefully when abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe internal state of a gentleman who detested intangible metaphor as\r\nheartily as the vulgarest of our gobblegobbets hate it, metaphor only can\r\ndescribe; and for the reason, that he had in him just something more than\r\nis within the compass of the language of the meat-markets.  He had--and\r\nhad it not the less because he fain would not have had--sufficient stuff\r\nto furnish forth a soul's epic encounter between Nature and Circumstance:\r\nand metaphor, simile, analysis, all the fraternity of old lamps for\r\nlighting our abysmal darkness, have to be rubbed, that we may get a\r\nglimpse of the fray.\r\n\r\nFree, and rejoicing; without the wish to be free; at the same time humbly\r\nand sadly acquiescing in the stronger claim of his family to pronounce\r\nthe decision: such was the second stage of Dudley's perturbation after\r\nthe blow.  A letter of Nesta's writing was in his pocket: he knew her\r\naddress.  He could not reply to her until he had seen her father: and\r\nthat interview remained necessarily prospective until he had come to his\r\nexact resolve, not omitting his critical approval of the sentences giving\r\nit shape, stamp, dignity--a noble's crest, as it were.\r\n\r\nNesta wrote briefly.  The apostrophe was, 'Dear Mr. Sowerby.'  She had\r\nengaged to send her address.  Her father had just gone.  The Miss\r\nDuvidneys had left the hotel yesterday for the furnished house facing the\r\nsea.  According to arrangements, she had a livery-stable hack, and had\r\nthat morning trotted out to the downs with a riding-master and company,\r\none of whom was 'an agreeable lady.'\r\n\r\nHe noticed approvingly her avoidance of an allusion to the 'Delphica' of\r\nMr. Durance's incomprehensible serial story, or whatever it was; which,\r\nas he had shown her, annoyed him, for its being neither fact nor fun; and\r\nshe had insisted on the fun; and he had painfully tried to see it or\r\nanything of a meaning; and it seemed to him now, that he had been\r\nhumiliated by the obedience to her lead: she had offended by her harping\r\nupon Delphica.  However, here it was unmentioned.  He held the letter out\r\nto seize it in the large, entire.\r\n\r\nHer handwriting was good, as good as the writing of the most agreeable\r\nlady on earth.  Dudley did not blame her for letting the lady be deceived\r\nin her--if she knew her position.  She might be ignorant of it.  And to\r\nstrangers, to chance acquaintances, even to friends, the position, of the\r\nloathsome name, was not materially important.  Marriage altered the view.\r\nHe sided with his family.\r\n\r\nHe sided, edgeing away, against his family.  But a vision of the earldom\r\ncoming to him, stirred reverential objections, composed of all which his\r\nunstained family could protest in religion, to repudiate an alliance with\r\na stained house, and the guilty of a condonation of immorality.  Who\r\nwould have imagined Mr. Radnor a private sinner flaunting for one of the\r\nrighteous?  And she, the mother, a lady--quite a lady; having really a\r\nsense of duty, sense of honour!  That she must be a lady, Dudley was\r\nconvinced.  He beheld through a porous crape, woven of formal\r\nrespectfulness, with threads of personal disgust, the scene, striking him\r\ndrearly like a distant great mansion's conflagration across moorland at\r\nmidnight, of a lady's breach of bonds and plunge of all for love.  How\r\nhad it been concealed?  In Dudley's upper sphere, everything was exposed:\r\nScandal walked naked and unashamed-figurante of the polite world.  But\r\nstill this lady was of the mint and coin, a true lady.  Handsome now, she\r\nmust have been beautiful.  And a comprehensible pride (for so would\r\nDudley have borne it) keeps the forsaken man silent up to death: .  .  .\r\ngrandly silent; but the loss of such a woman is enough to kill a man!\r\nNot in time, though!  Legitimacy evidently, by the mother's confession,\r\ncannot protect where it is wanted.  Dudley was optically affected by a\r\nround spot of the world swinging its shadow over Nesta.\r\n\r\nHe pitied, and strove to be sensible of her.  The effort succeeded so\r\nwell, that he was presently striving to be insensible.  The former state,\r\nwas the mounting of a wall; the latter, was a sinking through a chasm.\r\nThere would be family consultations, abhorrent; his father's agonized\r\namazement at the problem presented to a family of scrupulous principles\r\nand pecuniary requirements; his mother's blunt mention of the abominable\r\nname--mediaevally vindicated in champions of certain princely families\r\nindeed, but morally condemned; always under condemnation of the Church: a\r\nblot: and handed down: Posterity, and it might be a titled posterity,\r\ncrying out.  A man in the situation of Dudley could not think solely of\r\nhimself.  The nobles of the land are bound in honour to their posterity.\r\nThere you have one of the prominent permanent distinctions between them\r\nand the commonalty.\r\n\r\nHis mother would again propose her chosen bride for him: Edith Averst,\r\nwith the dowry of a present one thousand pounds per annum, and prospect\r\nof six or so, excluding Sir John's estate, Carping, in Leicestershire;\r\na fair estate, likely to fall to Edith; consumption seized her brothers\r\nas they ripened.  A fair girl too; only Dudley did not love her; he\r\nwanted to love.  He was learning the trick from this other one, who had\r\nbecome obscured and diminished, tainted, to the thought of her; yet not\r\nextinct.  Sight of her was to be dreaded.\r\n\r\nUnguiltily tainted, in herself she was innocent.  That constituted the\r\nunhappy invitation to him to swallow one half of his feelings, which had\r\nhis world's blessing on it, for the beneficial enlargement and\r\nenthronement of the baser unblest half, which he hugged and distrusted.\r\nCan innocence issue of the guilty?  He asked it, hopeing it might be\r\npossible: he had been educated in his family to believe, that the laws\r\ngoverning human institutions are divine--until History has altered them.\r\nThey are altered, to present a fresh bulwark against the infidel.  His\r\nconservative mind, retiring in good order, occupied the next rearward\r\npost of resistance.  Secretly behind it, the man was proud of having a\r\nheart to beat for the cause of the besiegeing enemy, in the present\r\ninstance.  When this was blabbed to him, and he had owned it, he\r\nattributed his weakness to excess of nature, the liking for a fair face.\r\n--Oh, but more!  spirit was in the sweet eyes.  She led him--she did lead\r\nhim in spiritual things; led him out of common circles of thought, into\r\nrefreshing new spheres; he had reminiscences of his having relished the\r\njuices of the not quite obviously comic, through her indications: and\r\nreally, in spite of her inferior flimsy girl's education, she could boast\r\nher acquirements; she was quick, startlingly; modest, too, in commerce\r\nwith a slower mind that carried more; though she laughed and was a needle\r\nfor humour: she taught him at times to put away his contempt of the\r\nromantic; she had actually shown him, that his expressed contempt of it\r\ndisguised a dread: as it did, and he was conscious of the foolishness of\r\nit now while pursuing her image, while his intelligence and senses gave\r\nher the form and glory of young morning.\r\n\r\nWariness counselled him to think it might be merely the play of her\r\nyouth; and also the disposition of a man in harness of business,\r\nexaggeratingly to prize an imagined finding of the complementary feminine\r\nof himself.  Venerating purity as he did, the question, whether the very\r\nsweetest of pure young women, having such an origin, must not at some\r\ntime or other show trace of the origin, surged up.  If he could only have\r\nbeen sure of her moral exemption from taint, a generous ardour, in\r\nreserve behind his anxious dubieties, would have precipitated Dudley to\r\nquench disapprobation and brave the world under a buckler of those\r\nmonetary advantages, which he had but stoutly to plead with the House of\r\nCantor, for the speedy overcoming of a reluctance to receive the nameless\r\ngirl and prodigious heiress.  His family's instruction of him, and his\r\ninherited tastes, rendered the aspect of a Nature stripped of the\r\nclothing of the laws offensive down to devilish: we grant her certain\r\nsteps, upon certain conditions accompanied by ceremonies; and when she\r\nviolates them, she becomes visibly again the revolutionary wicked old\r\nbeast bent on levelling our sacredest edifices.  An alliance with any of\r\nher votaries, appeared to Dudley as an act of treason to his house, his\r\nclass, and his tenets.  And nevertheless he was haunted by a cry of\r\ncriminal happiness for and at the commission of the act.\r\n\r\nHe would not decide to be 'precipitate,' and the days ran their course,\r\nuntil Lady Grace Halley arrived at Cronidge, a widow.  Lady Cantor spoke\r\nto her of Dudley's unfathomable gloom.  Lady Grace took him aside.\r\n\r\nShe said, without preface: 'You've heard, have you!'\r\n\r\n'You were aware of it?' said he, and his tone was irritable with a\r\nrebuke.\r\n\r\n'Coming through town, for the first time yesterday.  I had it--of all\r\nmen!--from a Sir Abraham Quatley, to whom I was recommended to go, about\r\nmy husband's shares in a South American Railway; and we talked, and it\r\ncame out.  He knows; he says, it is not generally known; and he likes,\r\nrespects Mr. Victor Radnor; we are to keep the secret.  Hum?  He had\r\nheard of your pretensions; and our relationship, etc.: \"esteemed\" it--\r\nyou know the City dialect--his duty to mention, etc.  That was after I\r\nhad spied on his forehead the something I wormed out of his mouth.  What\r\nare you going to do?'\r\n\r\n'What can I do!'\r\n\r\n'Are you fond of the girl?'\r\n\r\nAn attachment was indicated, as belonging to the case.  She was not a\r\nwoman to whom the breathing of pastoral passion would be suitable; yet he\r\nsaw that she despised him for a lover; and still she professed to\r\nunderstand his dilemma.  Perplexity at the injustice of fate and persons\r\nuniversally, put a wrinkled mask on his features and the expression of\r\nhis feelings.  They were torn, and the world was torn; and what he\r\nwanted, was delay, time for him to define his feelings and behold a\r\nrecomposed picture of the world.  He had already taken six days.  He\r\npleaded the shock to his family.\r\n\r\n'You won't have such a chance again,' she said.  Shrugs had set in.\r\n\r\nThey agreed as to the behaviour of the girl's mother.  It reflected on\r\nthe father, he thought.\r\n\r\n'Difficult thing to proclaim, before an engagement!' Her shoulders were\r\nrestless.\r\n\r\n'When a man's feelings get entangled!'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  a man's feelings!  I'm your British Jury for, a woman's.'\r\n\r\n'He has married her?'\r\n\r\nShe declared to not knowing particulars.  She could fib smoothly.\r\n\r\nThe next day she was on the line to London, armed with the proposal of an\r\nappointment for the Hon. Dudley to meet 'the girl's father.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nCONTAINS WHAT IS A SMALL THING OR A GREAT, AS THE SOUL OF THE CHIEF ACTOR\r\nMAY DECIDE\r\n\r\nSkepsey ushered Lady Grace into his master's private room, and\r\nentertained her during his master's absence.  He had buried his wife, he\r\nsaid: she feared, seeing his posture of the soaping of hands at one\r\nshoulder, that he was about to bewail it; and he did wish to talk of it,\r\nto show his modest companionship with her in loss, and how a consolation\r\nfor our sorrows may be obtained: but he won her approval, by taking the\r\nacceptable course between the dues to the subject and those to his\r\nhearer, as a model cab should drive considerate equally of horse and\r\nfare.\r\n\r\nA day of holiday at Hampstead, after the lowering of the poor woman's\r\nbones into earth, had been followed by a descent upon London; and at\r\nnight he had found himself in the immediate neighbourhood of a public\r\nhouse, noted for sparring exhibitions and instructions on the first\r\nfloor; and he was melancholy, unable quite to disperse 'the ravens'\r\nflocking to us on such days: though, if we ask why we have to go out of\r\nthe world, there is a corresponding inquiry, of what good was our coming\r\ninto it; and unless we are doing good work for our country, the answer is\r\nnot satisfactory--except, that we are as well gone.  Thinking which, he\r\nwas accosted by a young woman: perfectly respectable, in every way: who\r\ninquired if he had seen a young man enter the door.  She described him,\r\nand reviled the temptations of those houses; and ultimately, as she\r\ninsisted upon going in to look for the young man and use her persuasions\r\nto withdraw him from 'that snare of Satan,' he had accompanied her, and\r\nhe had gone upstairs and brought the young man down.  But friends, or the\r\nacquaintances they call friends, were with him, and they were 'in drink,'\r\nand abused the young woman; and she had her hand on the young man's arm,\r\nquoting Scripture.  Sad to relate of men bearing the name of Englishmen--\r\nand it was hardly much better if they pleaded intoxication!--they were\r\nnot content to tear the young man from her grasp, they hustled her,\r\npushed her out, dragged her in the street.\r\n\r\n'It became me to step to her defence: she was meek,' said Skepsey.  'She\r\nhad a great opinion of the efficacy of quotations from Scripture; she did\r\nnot recriminate.  I was able to release her and the young man she\r\nprotected, on condition of my going upstairs to give a display of my\r\nproficiency.  I had assured them, that the poor fellows who stood against\r\nme were not a proper match.  And of course, they jeered, but they had the\r\nevidence, on the pavement.  So I went up with them.  I was heavily\r\noppressed, I wanted relief, I put on the gloves.  He was a bigger man;\r\nthey laughed at the little one.  I told them, it depended upon a\r\nknowledge of first principles, and the power to apply them.  I will not\r\nboast, my lady: my junior by ten years, the man went down; he went down a\r\nsecond time; and the men seemed surprised; I told them, it was nothing\r\nbut first principles put into action.  I mention the incident, for the\r\nextreme relief it afforded me at the close of a dark day.'\r\n\r\n'So you cured your grief !' said Lady Grace; and Skepsey made way for his\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nVictor's festival-lights were kindled, beholding her; cressets on the\r\nwindow-sill, lamps inside.\r\n\r\n'Am I so welcome?'  There was a pull of emotion at her smile.  'What with\r\nyour little factotum and you, we are flattered to perdition when we come\r\nhere.  He has been proposing, by suggestion, like a Court-physician, the\r\nputting on of his boxing-gloves, for the consolation of the widowed:--\r\nmeant most kindly!  and it's a thousand pities women haven't their padded\r\ngloves.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  but our boxing-gloves can do mischief enough.  You have something\r\nto say, I see.'\r\n\r\n'How do you see?'\r\n\r\n'Tusk, tush.'\r\n\r\nThe silly ring of her voice and the pathless tattle changed; she talked\r\nto suit her laden look.  'You hit it.  I come from Dudley.  He knows the\r\nfacts.  I wish to serve you, in every way.'\r\n\r\nVictor's head had lifted.\r\n\r\n'Who was it?'\r\n\r\n'No enemy.'\r\n\r\n'Her mother.  She did rightly!\r\n\r\n'Certainly she did,' said Victor, and he thought that instantaneously of\r\nthe thing done.  'Oh, then she spoke to him!  She has kept it from me.\r\nFor now nearly a week--six days--I've seen her spying for something she\r\nexpected, like a face behind a door three inches ajar.  She has not been\r\nhalf alive; she refused explanations;--she was expecting to hear from\r\nhim, of him:--the decision, whatever it's to be!'\r\n\r\n'I can't aid you there,' said Lady Grace.  'He's one of the unreadables.\r\nHe names Tuesday next week.'\r\n\r\n'By all means.'\r\n\r\n'She?'\r\n\r\n'Fredi?--poor Fredi!--ah, my poor girl, yes!--No, she knows nothing.\r\nHere is the truth of it.--she, the legitimate, lives: they say she lives.\r\nWell, then, she lives against all rules physical or medical, lives by\r\nsheer force of will--it's a miracle of the power of a human creature to\r\n.  .  .  I have it from doctors, friends, attendants, they can't guess\r\nwhat she holds on, to keep her breath.  All the happiness in life!--if\r\nonly it could benefit her.  But it 's the cause of death to us.  Do you\r\nsee, dear friend;--you are a friend, proved friend,' he took her hand,\r\nand held and pressed it, in great need of a sanguine response to\r\nemphasis; and having this warm feminine hand, his ideas ran off with it.\r\n'The friend I need!  You have courage.  My Nataly, poor dear--she can\r\nendure, in her quiet way.  A woman of courage would take her place beside\r\nme and compel the world to do her homage, help;--a bright ready smile\r\ndoes it!  She would never be beaten.  Of course, we could have lived\r\nunder a bushel--stifled next to death!  But I am for light, air-battle,\r\nif you like.  I want a comrade, not a--not that I complain.  I respect,\r\npity, love--I do love her, honour: only, we want something else--courage\r\n--to face the enemy.  Quite right, that she should speak to Dudley\r\nSowerby.  He has to know, must know; all who deal closely with us must\r\nknow.  But see a moment: I am waiting to see the impediment dispersed,\r\nwhich puts her at an inequality with the world: and then I speak to all\r\nwhom it concerns--not before: for her sake.  How is it now?  Dudley will\r\nask .  .  .  you understand.  And when I am forced to confess, that the\r\nmother, the mother of the girl he seeks in marriage, is not yet in that\r\nstate herself, probably at that very instant the obstacle has crumbled to\r\ndust!  I say, probably: I have information--doctors, friends, attendants\r\n--they all declare it cannot last outside a week.  But you are here--\r\ntrue, I could swear! a touch of a hand tells me.  A woman's hand?  Well,\r\nyes: I read by the touch of a woman's hand:--betrays more than her looks\r\nor her lips!'  He sank his voice.  'I don't talk of condoling: if you are\r\nin grief, you know I share it.'  He kissed her hand, and laid it on her\r\nlap; eyed it, and met her eyes; took a header into her eyes, and lost\r\nhimself.  A nip of his conscience moved his tongue to say: 'As for guilt,\r\nif it were known .  .  .  a couple of ascetics--absolutely!'  But this\r\nwas assumed to be unintelligible; and it was merely the apology to his\r\nconscience in communion with the sprite of a petticoated fair one who was\r\nbeing subjected to tender little liberties, necessarily addressed in\r\nenigmas.  He righted immediately, under a perception of the\r\nthoroughbred's contempt for the barriers of wattled sheep; and caught\r\nthe word 'guilt,' to hide the Philistine citizen's lapse, by relating\r\nhistorically, in abridgement, the honest beauty of the passionate loves\r\nof the two whom the world proscribed for honestly loving.  There was no\r\nguilt.  He harped on the word, to erase the recollection of his first use\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n'Fiddle,' said Lady Grace.  'The thing happened.  You have now to carry\r\nit through.  You require a woman's aid in a social matter.  Rely on me,\r\nfor what I can do.  You will see Dudley on Tuesday?  I will write.  Be\r\nplain with him; not forgetting the gilding, I need not remark.  Your\r\nNesta has no aversion?'\r\n\r\n'Admires, respects, likes; is quite--is willing.'\r\n\r\n'Good enough beginning.'  She rose, for the atmosphere was heated, rather\r\nheavy.  'And if one proves to be of aid, you'll own that a woman has her\r\nplace in the battle.'\r\n\r\nThe fair black-clad widow's quick and singular interwreathing of the\r\nevanescent pretty pouts and frowns dimpled like the brush of the wind on\r\na sunny pool in a shady place; and her forehead was close below his chin,\r\nher lips not far.  Her apparel was attractively mourning.\r\n\r\nWidows in mourning, when they do not lean over extremely to the Stygian\r\nshore, with the complexions of the drugs which expedited the defunct to\r\nthe ferry, provoke the manly arm within reach of them to pluck their\r\npathetic blooming persons clean away from it.  What of the widow who\r\nvisibly likes the living?  Compassion; sympathy, impulse; and gratitude,\r\nimpulse again, living warmth; and a spring of the blood to wrestle with\r\nthe King of Terrors for the other poor harper's half-night capped\r\nEurydice; and a thirst, sudden as it is overpowering; and the solicitude,\r\na reflective solicitude, to put the seal on a thing and call it a fact,\r\nto the astonishment of history; and a kick of our naughty youth in its\r\ncoffin; all the insurgencies of Nature, with her colonel of the regiment\r\nabsent, and her veering trick to drive two vessels at the cross of a\r\ntrack into collision, combine for doing that, which is very much more,\r\nand which affects us at times so much less than did the pressure of a\r\nsoft wedded hand by our own elsewhere pledged one.  On the contrary, we\r\ntriumph, we have the rich flavour of the fruit for our pains; we\r\ncommission the historian to write in hieroglyphs a round big fact.\r\n\r\nThe lady passed through the trial submitting, stiffening her shoulders,\r\nand at the close, shutting her eyes.  She stood cool in her blush, and\r\neyed him, like one gravely awakened.  Having been embraced and kissed,\r\nshe had to consider her taste for the man, and acknowledge a neatness\r\nof impetuosity in the deed; and he was neither apologizing culprit nor\r\nglorying-bandit when it was done, but something of the lyric God\r\ntempering his fervours to a pleased sereneness, not offering a renewal\r\nof them.  He glowed transparently.  He said: 'You are the woman to take\r\na front place in the battle!'  With this woman beside him, it was a\r\nconquered world.\r\n\r\nComparisons, in the jotting souvenirs of a woman of her class and set,\r\nfavoured him; for she disliked enterprising libertines and despised\r\nstumbling youths; and the genial simple glow of his look assured her,\r\nthat the vanished fiery moment would not be built on by a dating master.\r\nShe owned herself.  Or did she?  Some understanding of how the other\r\nwoman had been won to the leap with him, was drawing in about her.  She\r\nwould have liked to beg for the story; and she could as little do that as\r\nbring her tongue to reproach.  If we come to the den! she said to her\r\nthought of reproach.  Our semi-civilization makes it a den, where a scent\r\nin his nostrils will spring the half-tamed animal away to wildness.  And\r\nshe had come unanticipatingly, without design, except perhaps to get a\r\nsuperior being to direct and restrain a gambler's hand perhaps for the\r\nfee of a temporary pressure.\r\n\r\n'I may be able to help a little--I hope!' she fetched a breath to say,\r\nwhile her eyelids mildly sermonized; and immediately she talked of her\r\ninheritance of property in stocks and shares.\r\n\r\nVictor commented passingly on the soundness of them, and talked of\r\nprojects he entertained:--Parliament!  'But I have only to mention it at\r\nhome, and my poor girl will set in for shrinking.'\r\n\r\nHe doated on the diverse aspect of the gallant woman of the world.\r\n\r\n'You succeed in everything you do,' said she, and she cordially believed\r\nit; and that belief set the neighbour memory palpitating.  Success folded\r\nher waist, was warm upon her lips: she worshipped the figure of Success.\r\n\r\n'I can't consent to fail, it's true, when my mind is on a thing,' Victor\r\nrejoined.\r\n\r\nHe looked his mind on Lady Grace.  The shiver of a maid went over her.\r\nThese transparent visages, where the thought which is half design is\r\nperceived as a lightning, strike lightning into the physically feebler.\r\nHer hand begged, with the open palm, her head shook thrice; and though\r\nshe did not step back, he bowed to the negation, and then she gave him a\r\ngrateful shadow of a smile, relieved, with a startled view of how greatly\r\nrelieved, by that sympathetic deference in the wake of the capturing\r\nintrepidity.\r\n\r\n'I am to name Tuesday for Dudley?' she suggested.\r\n\r\n'At any hour he pleases to appoint.'\r\n\r\n'A visit signifies .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'Whatever it signifies!'\r\n\r\n'I'm thinking of the bit of annoyance.'\r\n\r\n'To me?  Anything appointed, finds me ready the next minute.'\r\n\r\nHer smile was flatteringly bright.  'By the way, keep your City people\r\nclose about you: entertain as much as possible; dine them,' she said.\r\n\r\n'At home?'\r\n\r\n'Better.  Sir Rodwell Blachington, Sir Abraham Quatley: and their wives.\r\nThere's no drawing back now.  And I will meet them.'\r\n\r\nShe received a compliment.  She was on the foot to go.\r\n\r\nBut she had forgotten the Tiddler mine.\r\n\r\nThe Tiddler mine was leisurely mounting.  Victor stated the figures; he\r\nsaluted her hand, and Lady Grace passed out, with her heart on the top of\r\nthem, and a buzz about it of the unexpected having occurred She had her\r\nexperiences to match new patterns in events; though not very many.\r\nCompared with gambling, the game of love was an idle entertainment.\r\nCompared with other players, this man was gifted.\r\n\r\nVictor went in to Mr. Inchling's room, and kept Inchling from speaking,\r\nthat he might admire him for he knew not what, or knew not well what.\r\nThe good fellow was devoted to his wife.  Victor in old days had called\r\nthe wife Mrs. Grundy.  She gossiped, she was censorious; she knew--could\r\nnot but know--the facts; yet never by a shade was she disrespectful.  He\r\nhad a curious recollection of how his knowledge of Inchling and his wife\r\nbeing always in concert, entirely--whatever they might think in private\r\n--devoted to him in action, had influenced, if it had not originally\r\nsprung, his resolve to cast off the pestilential cloak of obscurity\r\nshortening his days, and emerge before a world he could illumine to give\r\nhim back splendid reflections.  Inchling and his wife, it was: because\r\nthe two were one: and if one, and subservient to him, knowing all the\r\nstory, why, it foreshadowed a conquered world.\r\n\r\nThey were the one pulse of the married Grundy beating in his hand.  So it\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nHe rattled his views upon Indian business, to hold Inchling silent, and\r\nlet his mind dwell almost lovingly on the good faithful spouse, who had\r\nno phosphorescent writing of a recent throbbing event on the four walls\r\nof his room.\r\n\r\nNataly was not so generously encountered in idea.\r\n\r\nHe felt and regretted this.  He greeted her with a doubled\r\naffectionateness.  Her pitiable deficiency of courage, excusing a man for\r\nthis and that small matter in the thick of the conflict, made demands on\r\nhim for gentle treatment.\r\n\r\n'You have not seen any one?' she asked.\r\n\r\n'City people.  And you, my love?'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Barmby called.  He has gone down to Tunbridge Wells for a week, to\r\nsome friend there.'  She added, in pain of thought: 'I have seen Dartrey.\r\nHe has brought Lord Clanconan to town, for a consultation, and expects he\r\nwill have to take him to Brighton.'\r\n\r\n'Brighton?  What a life for a man like Dartrey, at Brighton!'\r\n\r\nHer breast heaved.  'If I cannot see my Nesta there, he will bring her up\r\nto me for a day:\r\n\r\n'But, my dear, I will bring her up to you, if it is your wish to see\r\nher.'\r\n\r\n'It is becoming imperative that I should.'\r\n\r\n'No hurry, no hurry: wait till the end of next week.  And I must see\r\nDartrey, on business, at once!'\r\n\r\nShe gave the address in a neighbouring square.  He had minutes to spare\r\nbefore dinner, and flew.  She was not inquisitive.\r\n\r\nColney Durance had told Dartrey that Victor was killing her.  She had\r\nlittle animation; her smiles were ready, but faint.  After her interview\r\nwith Dudley, there had been a swoon at home; and her maid, sworn to\r\nsecrecy, willingly spared a tender-hearted husband--so good a master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nMRS. MARSETT\r\n\r\nLittle acts of kindness were not beyond the range of Colney Durance,\r\nand he ran down to Brighton, to give the exiled Nesta some taste of her\r\nfriendly London circle.  The Duvidney ladies knew that the dreaded\r\ngentleman had a regard for the girl.  Their own, which was becoming\r\nwarmer than they liked to think, was impressed by his manner of\r\nconversing with her.  'Child though she was,' he paid her the compliment\r\nof a sober as well as a satirical review of the day's political matter\r\nand recent publications; and the ladies were introduced, in a wonderment,\r\nto the damsel Delphica.  They listened placidly to a discourse upon her\r\nperformances, Japanese to their understandings.\r\n\r\nAt New York, behold, another adventurous representative and advocate\r\nof the European tongues has joined the party: Signor Jeridomani: a\r\nphilologer, of course; a politician in addition; Macchiavelli redivivus,\r\nit seems to fair Delphica.  The speech he delivers at the Syndicate\r\nDelmonico Dinner, is justly applauded by the New York Press as a\r\nmasterpiece of astuteness.  He appears to be the only one of the party\r\nwho has an eye for the dark.  She fancies she may know a more widely\r\nawake in the abstract.  But now, thanks to jubilant Journals and Homeric\r\nlaughter over the Continent, the secret is out, in so far as the\r\nconcurrents are all unmasked and exposed for the edification of the\r\nAmerican public.  Dr. Bouthoin's eyebrows are up, Mr. Semhians disfigures\r\nhis name by greatly gaping.  Shall they return to their Great Britain\r\nindignant?  Patriotism, with the sauce of a luxurious expedition at no\r\ncost to the private purse, restrains them.  Moreover, there is no sign of\r\nany one of the others intending to quit the expedition; and Mr. Semhians\r\nhas done a marvel or two in the cricket-field: Old England looks up where\r\nshe can.  What is painfully extraordinary to our couple, they find in the\r\nfrigid attitude of the Americans toward their 'common tongue'; together\r\nwith the rumour of a design to despatch an American rival emissary to\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nNesta listened, inquired, commented, laughed; the ladies could not have a\r\ndoubt that she was interested and understood.  She would have sketches of\r\nscenes between Delphica and M. Falarique, with whom the young Germania\r\nwas cleverly ingenuous indeed--a seminary Celimene; and between Delphica\r\nand M. Mytharete, with whom she was archaeological, ravishingly amoebaean\r\nof Homer.  Dr. Gannius holds a trump card in his artless daughter,\r\nconjecturally, for the establishment of the language of the gutturals in\r\nthe far East.  He has now a suspicion, that the inventive M. Falarique,\r\nmelted down to sobriety by misfortune, may some day startle their camp by\r\nthe cast of more than a crow into it, and he is bent on establishing\r\nalliances; frightens the supple Signor Jeridomani to lingual fixity;\r\neulogizes Football, with Dr. Bouthoin; and retracts, or modifies, his\r\ndictum upon the English, that, 'masculine brawn they have in their\r\nbodies, but muscle they have not in their feminine minds'; to exalt them,\r\nfor a signally clean, if a dense, people: 'Amousia, not Alousia, is their\r\nenemy:'--How, when we have the noblest crop of poets?  'You have never\r\nheartily embraced those aliens among you until you learnt from us, that\r\nyou might brag of them.'--Have they not endowed us with the richest of\r\nlanguages?  'The words of which are used by you, as old slippers, for\r\npuns.'  Mr. Semhians has been superciliously and ineffectively punning in\r\nforeign presences: he and his chief are inwardly shocked by a new\r\nperception; What if, now that we have the populace for paymaster,\r\nsubservience to the literary tastes of the populace should reduce the\r\nnation to its lowest mental level, and render us not only unable to\r\ncompete with the foreigner, but unintelligible to him, although so\r\nproudly paid at home!  Is it not thus that nations are seen of the\r\nHighest to be devouring themselves?\r\n\r\n'For,' says Dr. Gannius, as if divining them, 'this excessive and\r\napplauded productiveness, both of your juvenile and your senile,\r\nin your modern literature, is it ever a crop?  Is it even the restorative\r\nperishable stuff of the markets?  Is it not rather your street-pavement's\r\npatter of raindrops, incessantly in motion, and as fruitful?'\r\nMr. Semhians appeals to Delphica.  'Genius you have,' says she,\r\nstiffening his neck-band, 'genius in superabundance':--he throttles to\r\nthe complexion of the peony:--'perhaps criticism is wanting.'  Dr.\r\nGannius adds: 'Perhaps it is the drill-sergeant everywhere wanting for an\r\nunrivalled splendid rabble!'\r\n\r\nColney left the whole body of concurrents on the raised flooring of a\r\nfamous New York Hall, clearly entrapped, and incited to debate before\r\nan enormous audience, as to the merits of their respective languages.\r\n'I hear,' says Dr. Bouthoin to Mr. Semhians (whose gape is daily\r\nextending), 'that the tickets cost ten dollars!'\r\n\r\nThere was not enough of Delphicafor Nests.\r\n\r\nColney asked: 'Have you seen any of our band?'\r\n\r\n'No,' she said, with good cheer, and became thoughtful, conscious of a\r\nfunny reason for the wish to hear of the fictitious creature disliked by\r\nDudley.  A funny and a naughty reason, was it?  Not so very naughty: but\r\nit was funny; for it was a spirit of opposition to Dudley, without an\r\ninferior feeling at all, such as girls should have.\r\n\r\nColney brought his viola for a duet; they had a pleasant musical evening,\r\nas in old days at Creckholt; and Nesta, going upstairs with the ladies to\r\nbed, made them share her father's amused view of the lamb of the flock\r\nthis bitter gentleman became when he had the melodious instrument tucked\r\nunder his chin.  He was a guest for the night.  Dressing in the early\r\nhour, Nests saw him from her window on the parade, and soon joined him,\r\nto hear him at his bitterest, in the flush of the brine.  'These lengths\r\nof blank-faced terraces fronting sea!' were the satirist's present black\r\nbeast.  'So these moneyed English shoulder to the front place; and that\r\nis the appearance they offer to their commercial God!'  He gazed along\r\nthe miles of 'English countenance,' drearily laughing.  Changeful ocean\r\nseemed to laugh at the spectacle.  Some Orphic joke inspired his\r\nexclamation: 'Capital!'\r\n\r\n'Come where the shops are,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\n'And how many thousand parsons have you here?'\r\n\r\n'Ten, I think,' she answered in his vein, and warmed him; leading him\r\ncontemplatively to scrutinize her admirers: the Rev. Septimus; Mr.\r\nSowerby.\r\n\r\n'News of our friend of the whimpering flute?'\r\n\r\n'Here?  no.  I have to understand you!'\r\n\r\nColney cast a weariful look backward on the 'regiments of Anglo-Chinese'\r\nrepresented to him by the moneyed terraces, and said: 'The face of a\r\nstopped watch!--the only meaning it has is past date.'\r\n\r\nHe had no liking for Dudley Sowerby.  But it might have been an allusion\r\nto the general view of the houses.  But again, 'the meaning of it past\r\ndate,' stuck in her memory.  A certain face close on handsome, had a\r\nfatal susceptibility to caricature.\r\n\r\nShe spoke of her 'exile': wanted Skepsey to come down to her; moaned over\r\nthe loss of her Louise.  The puzzle of the reason for the long separation\r\nfrom her parents, was evident in her mind, and unmentioned.\r\n\r\nThey turned on to the pier.\r\n\r\nNesta reminded him of certain verses he had written to celebrate her\r\nvisit to the place when she was a child:\r\n\r\n                  '\"And then along the pier we sped,\r\n                    And there we saw a Whale\r\n                    He seemed to have a Normous Head,\r\n                    And not a bit of Tail!\"'\r\n\r\n'Manifestly a foreigner to our shores, where the exactly inverse\r\ncondition rules,' Colney said.\r\n\r\n                  '\"And then we scampered on the beach,\r\n                    To chase the foaming wave;\r\n                    And when we ran beyond its reach\r\n                    We all became more brave.\"'\r\n\r\nColney remarked: 'I was a poet--for once.'\r\n\r\nA neat-legged Parisianly-booted lady, having the sea, winds very\r\nenterprising with her dark wavy, locks and jacket and skirts, gave a cry\r\nof pleasure and--a silvery 'You dear!' at sight of Nesta; then at sight\r\nof one of us, moderated her tone to a propriety equalling the most\r\nconventional.  'We ride to-day?'\r\n\r\n'I shall be one,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\n'It would not be the commonest pleasure to me, if you were absent.'\r\n\r\n'Till eleven, then!'\r\n\r\n'After my morning letter to Ned.'\r\n\r\nShe sprinkled silvery sound on that name or on the adieu, blushed,\r\nblinked, frowned, sweetened her lip-lines, bit at the underone, and\r\npassed in a discomposure.\r\n\r\n'The lady?' Colney asked.\r\n\r\n'She is--I meet her in the troop conducted by the riding-master: Mrs.\r\nMarsett.'\r\n\r\n'And who is Ned?'\r\n\r\n'It is her husband, to whom she writes every morning.  He is a captain in\r\nthe army, or was.  He is in Norway, fishing.'\r\n\r\n'Then the probability is, that the English officer continues his military\r\nstudies.'\r\n\r\n'Do you not think her handsome, Mr. Durance?'\r\n\r\n'Ned may boast of his possession, when he has trimmed it and toned it a\r\nlittle.!\r\n\r\n'She is different, if you are alone with her.'\r\n\r\n'It is not unusual,' said Colney.\r\n\r\nAt eleven o'clock he was in London, and Nesta rode beside Mrs. Marsett\r\namid the troop.\r\n\r\nA South-easterly wind blew the waters to shifty goldleaf prints of\r\nbrilliance under the sun.\r\n\r\n'I took a liberty this morning, I called you \"Dear\" this morning,' the\r\nlady said.  'It's what I feel, only I have no right to blurt out\r\neverything I feel, and I was ashamed.  I am sure I must have appeared\r\nridiculous.  I got quite nervous.'\r\n\r\n'You would not be ridiculous to me.'\r\n\r\n'I remember I spoke of Ned!\r\n\r\n'You have spoken of him before.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  I know: to you alone.  I should like to pluck out my heart and\r\npitch it on the waves, to see whether it would sink or swim.  That's a\r\nfunny idea, isn't it!  I tell you everything that comes up.  What shall\r\nI do when I lose you!  You always make me feel you've a lot of poetry\r\nready-made in you.'\r\n\r\n'We will write.  And you will have your husband then.'\r\n\r\n'When I had finished my letter to Ned, I dropped my head on it and\r\nbehaved like a fool for several minutes.  I can't bear the thought of\r\nlosing you!'\r\n\r\n'But you don't lose me,' said Nesta; 'there is no ground for your\r\nsupposing that you will.  And your wish not to lose me, binds me to you\r\nmore closely.'\r\n\r\n'If you knew!' Mrs. Marsett caught at her slippery tongue, and she\r\ncarolled: 'If we all knew everything, we should be wiser, and what a\r\nnaked lot of people we should be!'\r\n\r\nThey were crossing the passage of a cavalcade of gentlemen, at the end of\r\nthe East Cliff.  One among them, large and dominant, with a playful voice\r\nof brass, cried out:\r\n\r\n'And how do you do, Mrs. Judith Marsett--ha?  Beautiful morning?'\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett's figure tightened; she rode stonily erect, looked level\r\nahead.  Her woman's red mouth was shut fast on a fighting underlip.\r\n\r\n'He did not salute you,' Nesta remarked, to justify her for not having\r\nresponded.\r\n\r\nThe lady breathed a low thunder: 'Coward!'\r\n\r\n'He cannot have intended to insult you,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\n'That man knows I will not notice him.  He is a beast.  He will learn\r\nthat I carry a horsewhip.'\r\n\r\n'Are you not taking a little incident too much to heart?'\r\n\r\nThe sigh of the heavily laden came from Mrs. Marsett.\r\n\r\n'Am I pale?  I dare say.  I shall go on my knees tonight hating myself\r\nthat I was born \"one of the frail sex.\"  We are, or we should ride at the\r\ncoward and strike him to the ground.  Pray, pray do not look distressed!\r\nNow you know my Christian name.  That dog of a man barks it out on the\r\nroads.  It doesn't matter.'\r\n\r\n'He has offended you before?'\r\n\r\n'You are near me.  They can't hurt me, can't touch me, when I think that\r\nI 'm talking with you.  How I envy those who call you by your Christian\r\nname!'\r\n\r\n'Nesta,' said smiling Nesta.  The smile was forced, that she might show\r\nkindness, for the lady was jarring on her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett opened her lips: 'Oh, my God, I shall be crying!--let's\r\ngallop.  No, wait, I'll tell you.  I wish I could!  I will tell you of\r\nthat man.  That man is Major Worrell.  One of the majors who manage to\r\nget to their grade.  A retired warrior.  He married a handsome woman,\r\nabove him in rank, with money; a good woman.  She was a good woman, or\r\nshe would have had her vengeance, and there was never a word against her.\r\nShe must have loved that--Ned calls him, full-blooded ox.  He spent her\r\nmoney and he deceived her.--You innocent!  Oh, you dear!  I'd give the\r\nworld to have your eyes.  I've heard tell of \"crystal clear,\" but eyes\r\nlike yours have to tell me how deep and clear.  Such a world for them to\r\nbe in!  I did pray, and used your name last night on my knees, that you\r\n--I said Nesta--might never have to go through other women's miseries.\r\nAh me!  I have to tell you he deceived her.  You don't quite understand.'\r\n\r\n'I do understand,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\n'God help you!--I am excited to-day.  That man is poison to me.  His wife\r\nforgave him three times.  On three occasions, that unhappy woman forgave\r\nhim.  He is great at his oaths, and a big breaker of them.  She walked\r\nout one November afternoon and met him riding along with a notorious\r\ncreature.  You know there are bad women.  They passed her, laughing.  And\r\nlook there, Nesta, see that groyne; that very one.'  Mrs. Marsett pointed\r\nher whip hard out.  'The poor lady went down from the height here; she\r\nwalked into that rough water look!--steadying herself along it, and she\r\nplunged; she never came out alive.  A week after her burial, Major\r\nWorrell--I 've told you enough.'\r\n\r\n'We 'll gallop now,' said Nesta.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett's talk, her presence hardly less, affected the girl with\r\nthose intimations of tumult shown upon smooth waters when the great\r\nelements are conspiring.  She felt that there was a cause why she had to\r\npity, did pity her.  It might be, that Captain Marsett wedded one who was\r\nof inferior station,' and his wife had to bear blows from cruel people.\r\nThe supposition seemed probable.  The girl accepted it; for beyond it, as\r\nthe gathering of the gale masked by hills, lay a brewing silence.  What?\r\nShe did not reflect.  Her quick physical sensibility curled to some\r\nbreath of heated atmosphere brought about her by this new acquaintance:\r\nnot pleasant, if she had thought of pleasure: intensely suggestive of our\r\nlife at the consuming tragic core, round which the furnace pants.  But\r\nshe was unreflecting, feeling only a beyond and hidden.\r\n\r\nBesides, she was an exile.  Spelling at dark things in the dark, getting\r\nto have the sight which peruses darkness, she touched the door of a\r\nmystery that denied her its key, but showed the lock; and her life was\r\nbeginning to know of hours that fretted her to recklessness.  Her friend\r\nLouise was absent: she had so few friends--owing to that unsolved reason:\r\nshe wanted one, of any kind, if only gentle: and this lady seemed to need\r\nher: and she flattered; Nesta was in the mood for swallowing and\r\ndigesting and making sweet blood of flattery.\r\n\r\nAt one time, she liked Mrs. Marsett best absent: in musing on her,\r\nwishing her well, having said the adieu.  For it was wearisome to hear\r\npraises of 'innocence'; and women can do so little to cure that\r\n'wickedness of men,' among the lady's conversational themes;  and 'love'\r\ntoo: it may be a 'plague,' and it may be 'heaven': it is better left\r\nunspoken of.  But there were times when Mrs. Marsett's looks and tones\r\ntouched compassion to press her hand: an act that had a pledgeing\r\nsignification in the girl's bosom: and when, by the simple avoidance of\r\nejaculatory fervours, Mrs. Marsett's quieted good looks had a shadow of a\r\ntender charm, more pathetic than her outcries were.\r\n\r\nThese had not always the sanction of polite usage: and her English was\r\nguilty of sudden lapses to the Thameswater English of commerce and\r\ndrainage instead of the upper wells.  But there are many uneducated\r\nladies in the land.  Many, too, whose tastes in romantic literature\r\nbetray now and then by peeps a similarity to Nesta's maid Mary's.  Mrs.\r\nMarsett liked love, blood, and adventure.  She had, moreover, a favourite\r\nnoble poet, and she begged Nesta's pardon for naming him, and she would\r\nnot name him, and told her she must not read him until she was a married\r\nwoman, because he did mischief to girls.  Thereupon she fell into one of\r\nher silences, emerging with a cry of hate of herself for having ever read\r\nhim.  She did not blame the bard.  And, ah, poor bard!  he fought his\r\nbattle: he shall not be named for the brand on the name.  He has lit a\r\nsulphur match for the lover of nature through many a generation; and to\r\nbe forgiven by sad frail souls who could accuse him of pipeing devil's\r\nagent to them at the perilous instant--poor girls too!--is chastisement\r\nenough.  This it is to be the author of unholy sweets: a Posterity\r\nsitting in judgement will grant, that they were part of his honest battle\r\nwith the hypocrite English Philistine, without being dupe of the plea or\r\nat all the thirsty swallower of his sugary brandy.  Mrs. Marsett\r\nexpressed aloud her gladness of escape in never having met a man like\r\nhim; followed by her regret that 'Ned' was so utterly unlike; except\r\n'perhaps'--and she hummed; she was off on the fraternity in wickedness.\r\n\r\nNesta's ears were fatigued.  'My mother writes of you,' she said, to vary\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett looked.  She sighed downright: 'I have had my dream of a\r\nfriend!--It was that gentleman with you on the pier!  Your mother\r\nobjects?'\r\n\r\n'She has inquired, nothing more.'\r\n\r\n'I am not twenty-three: not as old as I should be, for a guide to you.\r\nI know I would never do you harm.  That I know.  I would walk into that\r\nwater first, and take Mrs. Worrell's plunge:--the last bath; a thorough\r\ncleanser for a woman!  Only, she was a good woman and didn't want it, as\r\nwe--as lots of us do:--to wash off all recollection of having met a man!\r\nYour mother would not like me to call you Nesta!  I have never begged you\r\nto call me Judith.  Damnable name!'  Mrs. Marsett revelled in the heat of\r\nthe curse on it, as a relief to torture of the breast, until a sense of\r\nthe girl's alarmed hearing sent the word reverberating along her nerves\r\nand shocked her with such an exposure of our Shaggy wild one on a lady's\r\nlips.  She murmured: 'Forgive me,' and had the passion to repeat the\r\nepithet in shrieks, and scratch up male speech for a hatefuller; but the\r\ntwitch of Nesta's brows made her say: 'Do pardon me.  I did something in\r\nScripture.  Judith could again.  Since that brute Worrell crossed me\r\nriding with you, I loathe my name; I want to do things.  I have offended\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'We have been taught differently.  I do not use those words.  Nothing\r\nelse.'\r\n\r\n'They frighten you.'\r\n\r\n'They make me shut; that is all.'\r\n\r\n'Supposing you were some day to discover .  .  .  ta-tata, all the things\r\nthere are in the world.'  Mrs. Marsett let fly an artificial chirrup.\r\n'You must have some ideas of me.'\r\n\r\n'I think you have had unhappy experiences.'\r\n\r\n'Nesta .  .  .  just now and then!  the first time we rode out together,\r\ncoming back from the downs, I remember, I spoke, without thinking--I was\r\nenraged--of a case in the newspapers; and you had seen it, and you were\r\nnot afraid to talk of it.  I remember I thought, Well, for a girl, she's\r\nbold!  I thought you knew more than a girl ought to know: until--you did\r\n--you set my heart going.  You spoke of the poor women like an angel of\r\ncompassion.  You said, we were all mixed up with their fate--I forget the\r\nwords.  But no one ever heard in Church anything that touched me so.\r\nI worshipped you.  You said, you thought of them often, and longed to\r\nfind out what you could do to help.  And I thought, if they could hear\r\nyou, and only come near you, as I was--ah, my heaven!  Unhappy\r\nexperiences?  Yes.  But when men get women on the slope to their\r\nperdition, they have no mercy, none.  They deceive, and they lie; they\r\nare false in acts and words; they do as much as murder.  They're never\r\nhanged for it.  They make the Laws!  And then they become fathers of\r\nfamilies, and point the finger at the \"wretched creatures.\"  They have a\r\ndozen names against women, for one at themselves.'\r\n\r\n'It maddens me at times to think .  .  .  !' said Nesta, burning with the\r\nsting of vile names.\r\n\r\nOh, there are bad women as well as bad men: but men have the power and\r\nthe lead, and they take advantage of it; and then they turn round and\r\nexecrate us for not having what they have robbed us of!'\r\n\r\n'I blame women--if I may dare, at my age,' said Nesta, and her bosom\r\nheaved.  'Women should feel for their sex; they should not allow the\r\nnames; they should go among their unhappier sisters.  At the worst, they\r\nare sisters!  I am sure, that fallen cannot mean--Christ shows it does\r\nnot.  He changes the tone of Scripture.  The women who are made outcasts,\r\nmust be hopeless and go to utter ruin.  We should, if we pretend to be\r\nbetter, step between them and that.  There cannot be any goodness unless\r\nit is a practiced goodness.  Otherwise it is nothing more than paint on\r\ncanvas.  You speak to me of my innocence.  What is it worth, if it is\r\nonly a picture and does no work to help to rescue?  I fear I think most\r\nof the dreadful names that redden and sicken us.--The Old Testament!--\r\nI have a French friend, a Mademoiselle Louise de Seines--you should hear\r\nher: she is intensely French, and a Roman Catholic, everything which we\r\nare not: but so human, so wise, and so full of the pride of her sex!\r\nI love her.  It is love.  She will never marry until she meets a man who\r\nhas the respect for women, for all women.  We both think we cannot\r\nseparate ourselves from our sisters.  She seems to me to wither men, when\r\nshe speaks of their injustice, their snares to mislead and their cruelty\r\nwhen they have succeeded.  She is right, it is the--brute: there is no\r\nother word.'\r\n\r\n'And French and good!' Mrs. Marsett ejaculated.  'My Ned reads French\r\nnovels, and he says, their women .  .  .  .  But your mademoiselle is a\r\nreal one.  If she says all that, I could kneel to her, French or not.\r\nDoes she talk much about men and women?'\r\n\r\n'Not often: we lose our tempers.  She wants women to have professions;\r\nat present they have not much choice to avoid being penniless.  Poverty,\r\nand the sight of luxury!  It seems as if we produced the situation,\r\nto create an envious thirst, and cause the misery.  Things are improving\r\nfor them; but we groan at the slowness of it.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett now declared a belief, that women were nearly quite as bad\r\nas men.  'I don't think I could take up with a profession.  Unless to be\r\na singer.  Ah!  Do you sing?'\r\n\r\nNesta smiled: 'Yes, I sing.'\r\n\r\n'How I should like to hear you!  My Ned's a thorough Englishman--\r\ngentleman, you know: he cares only for sport; Shooting, Fishing, Hunting;\r\nand Football, Cricket, Rowing, and matches.  He's immensely proud of\r\nEngland in those things.  And such muscle he has! though he begins to\r\nfancy his heart's rather weak.  It's digestion, I tell him.  But he takes\r\nme to the Opera sometimes--Italian Opera; he can't stand German.  Down at\r\nhis place in Leicestershire, he tells me, when there 's company, he has--\r\nI'm sure you sing beautifully.  When I hear beautiful singing, even from\r\na woman they tell tales of, upon my word, it's true, I feel my sins all\r\nmelting out of me and I'm new-made: I can't bear Ned to speak.  Would you\r\none day, one afternoon, before the end of next week?--it would do me such\r\nreal good, you can't guess how much; if I could persuade you!  I know I'm\r\nasking something out of rules.  For just half an hour: I judge by your\r\nvoice in talking.  Oh! it would do me good-good-good to hear you sing.\r\nThere is a tuned piano--a cottage; I don't think it sounds badly.  You\r\nwould not see any great harm in calling on me? once!'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Nesta.  And it was her nature that projected the word.  Her\r\nawakened wits were travelling to her from a distance, and she had an\r\nintimation of their tidings; and she could not have said what they were;\r\nor why, for a moment, she hesitated to promise she would come.  Her\r\nvision of the reality of things was without written titles, to put\r\nthe stamp of the world on it.  She felt this lady to be one encompassed\r\nand in the hug of the elementary forces, which are the terrors to\r\ninexperienced pure young women.  But she looked at her, and dared trust\r\nthose lips, those eyes.  She saw, through whatever might be the vessel,\r\nthe spirit of the woman; as the upper nobility of our brood are enabled\r\nto do in a crisis mixed of moral aversion and sisterly sympathy, when\r\nnature cries to them, and the scales of convention, the mud-spots of\r\naccident, even naughtiness, even wickedness, all misfortune's issue, if\r\nwe but see the one look upward, fall away.  Reason is not excluded from\r\nthese blind throbs of a blood that strikes to right the doings of the\r\nFates.  Nesta did not err in her divination of the good and the bad\r\nincarnate beside her, though both good and bad were behind a curtain; the\r\nlatter sparing her delicate senses, appealing to chivalry, to the simply\r\nfeminine claim on her.  Reason, acting in her heart as a tongue of the\r\nflames of the forge where we all are wrought, told her surely that the\r\ngood predominated.  She had the heart which is at our primal fires when\r\nnature speaks.\r\n\r\nShe gave the promise to call on Mrs. Marsett and sing to her.\r\n\r\n'An afternoon?  Oh! what afternoon?' she was asked, and she said: 'This\r\nafternoon, if you like.'\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed: Mrs. Marsett acted violently the thrill of delight she\r\nfelt in the prospect.\r\n\r\nThe ladies Dorothea and Virginia, consulted, and pronounced the name of\r\nMarsett to be a reputable County name.  'There was a Leicestershire\r\nbaronet of the name of Marsett.'  They arranged to send their button-\r\nblazing boy at Nesta's heels.  Mrs. Marsett resided in a side-street not\r\nvery distant from the featureless but washed and orderly terrace of the\r\nglassy stare at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nSHOWS ONE OF THE SHADOWS OF THE WORLD CROSSING A VIRGIN'S MIND\r\n\r\nNasta and her maid were brought back safely through the dusk by their\r\nconstellation of a boy, to whom the provident ladies had entrusted her.\r\nThey could not but note how short her syllables were.  Her face was only\r\npartly seen.  They had returned refreshed from their drive on the\r\npopulous and orderly parade---so fair a pattern of their England!--after\r\ndiscoursing of 'the dear child,' approving her manners, instancing proofs\r\nof her intelligence, nay, her possession of 'character.'  They did so,\r\nnotwithstanding that these admissions were worse than their growing love\r\nfor the girl, to confound established ideas.  And now, in thoughtfulness\r\non her behalf, Dorothea said, 'We have considered, Nesta, that you may\r\nbe lonely; and if it is your wish, we will leave our card on your new\r\nacquaintance.'  Nesta took her hand and kissed it; she declined, saying,\r\n'No,' without voice.\r\n\r\nThey had two surprises at the dinner-hour.  One was the card of Dartrey\r\nFenellan, naming an early time next day for his visit; and the other was\r\nthe appearance of the Rev. Stuart Rem, a welcome guest.  He had come to\r\nmeet his Bishop.\r\n\r\nHe had come also with serious information for the ladies, regarding the\r\nRev. Abram Posterley.  No sooner was this out of his mouth than both\r\nladies exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'Again!' So serious was it, that there had been a consultation at the\r\nWells; Mr. Posterley's friend, the Rev. Septimus Barmby, and his own\r\nfriend, the Rev. Groseman Buttermore, had journeyed from London to sit\r\nupon the case: and, 'One hoped,' Mr. Stuart Rem said, 'poor Posterley\r\nwould be restored to the senses he periodically abandoned.'  He laid a\r\nhand on Tasso's curls, and withdrew it at a menace of teeth.  Tasso would\r\nsubmit to rough caresses from Mr. Posterley; he would not allow Mr.\r\nStuart Rem to touch him.  Why was that?  Perhaps for the reason of Mr.\r\nPosterley's being so emotional as perpetually to fall a victim to some\r\nbright glance and require the rescue of his friends; the slave of woman\r\nhad a magnet for animals!\r\n\r\nDorothea and Virginia were drawn to compassionate sentiments, in spite\r\nof the provokeing recurrence of Mr. Posterley's malady.  He had not an\r\nincome to support a wife.  Always was this unfortunate gentleman\r\nentangling himself in a passion for maid or widow of the Wells and it was\r\ndesperate, a fever.  Mr. Stuart Rem charitably remarked on his taking it\r\nso severely because of his very scrupulous good conduct.  They pardoned a\r\nlittle wound to their delicacy, and asked: 'On this occasion?' Mr. Stuart\r\nRem named a linendraper's establishment near the pantiles, where a fair\r\nyoung woman served.  'And her reputation?' That was an article less\r\npresentable through plate-glass, it seemed: Mr. Stuart Rem drew a\r\nprolonged breath into his nose.\r\n\r\n'It is most melancholy!' they said in unison.  'Nothing positive,' said\r\nhe.  'But the suspicion of a shadow, Mr. Stuart Rem!  You will not permit\r\nit?' He stated, that his friend Buttermore might have influence.\r\nDorothea said: 'When I think of Mr. Posterley's addiction to ceremonial\r\nobservances, and to matrimony, I cannot but think of a sentence that fell\r\nfrom Mr. Durance one day, with reference to that division of our Church:\r\nhe called it:--you frown!  and I would only quote Mr. Durance to you in\r\nsupport of your purer form, as we hold it to be--with the candles, the\r\nvestments, Confession, alas!  he called it, \"Rome and a wife.\"'\r\n\r\nMr. Stuart Rem nodded an enforced assent: he testily dismissed mention of\r\nMr. Durance, and resumed on Mr. Posterley.\r\n\r\nThe good ladies now, with some of their curiosity appeased, considerately\r\nsignified to him, that a young maiden was present.\r\n\r\nThe young maiden had in heart stuff to render such small gossip a hum of\r\nsummer midges.  She did not imagine the dialogue concerned her in any\r\nway.  She noticed Mr. Stuart Rem's attentive scrutiny of her from time to\r\ntime.  She had no sensitiveness, hardly a mind for things about her.\r\nTo-morrow she was to see Captain Dartrey.  She dwelt on that prospect,\r\nfor an escape from the meshes of a painful hour--the most woeful of the\r\nhours she had yet known-passed with Judith Marsett: which dragged her\r\nsoul through a weltering of the deeps, tossed her over and over, still\r\ndid it with her ideas.  It shocked her nevertheless to perceive how much\r\nof the world's flayed life and harsh anatomy she had apprehended, and so\r\ncoldly, previous to Mrs. Marsett's lift of the veil in her story of\r\nherself: a skipping revelation, terrible enough to the girl; whose\r\ncomparison of the previously suspected things with the things now\r\nrevealed imposed the thought of her having been both a precocious and a\r\ncallous young woman: a kind of 'Delphica without the erudition,' her mind\r\nphrased it airily over her chagrin.--And the silence of Dudley proved him\r\nto have discovered his error in choosing such a person--he was wise, and\r\nshe thanked him.  She had an envy of the ignorant-innocents adored by the\r\nyoung man she cordially thanked for quitting her.  She admired the white\r\ncoat of armour they wore, whether bestowed on them by their constitution\r\nor by prudence.  For while combating mankind now on Judith Marsett's\r\nbehalf, personally she ran like a hare from the mere breath of an\r\nassociation with the very minor sort of similar charges; ardently she\r\ndesired the esteem of mankind; she was at moments abject.  But had she\r\nactually been aware of the facts now known?\r\n\r\nThose wits of the virgin young, quickened to shrewdness by their budding\r\nsenses--and however vividly--require enlightenment of the audible and\r\nvisible before their sterner feelings can be heated to break them away\r\nfrom a blushful dread and force the mind to know.  As much as the\r\nwilfully or naturally blunted, the intelligently honest have to learn by\r\ntouch: only, their understandings cannot meanwhile be so wholly obtuse as\r\nour society's matron, acting to please the tastes of the civilized man--\r\na creature that is not clean-washed of the Turk in him--barbarously\r\nexacts.  The signor aforesaid is puzzled to read the woman, who is after\r\nall in his language; but when it comes to reading the maiden, she appears\r\nas a phosphorescent hieroglyph to some speculative Egyptologer; and he\r\ninsists upon distinct lines and characters; no variations, if he is to\r\nhave sense of surety.  Many a young girl is misread by the amount she\r\nseems to know of our construction, history, and dealings, when it is not\r\nmore than her sincere ripeness of nature, that has gathered the facts of\r\nlife profuse about her, and prompts her through one or other of the\r\ninstincts, often vanity, to show them to be not entirely strange to her;\r\nor haply her filly nature is having a fling at the social harness of\r\nhypocrisy.  If you (it is usually through the length of ears of your\r\nNovelist that the privilege is yours) have overheard queer communications\r\npassing between girls, and you must act the traitor eavesdropper or\r\nAchilles masquerader to overhear so clearly, these, be assured, are not\r\nspecially the signs of their corruptness.  Even the exceptionally cynical\r\nare chiefly to be accused of bad manners.  Your Moralist is a myopic\r\npreacher, when he stamps infamy, on them, or on our later generation, for\r\nthe kick they have at grandmother decorum, because you do not or cannot\r\nconceal from them the grinning skeleton behind it.\r\n\r\nNesta once had dreams of her being loved: and she was to love in return\r\nfor a love that excused her for loving double, treble; as not her lover\r\ncould love, she thought with grateful pride in the treasure she was to\r\npour out at his feet; as only one or two (and they were women) in the\r\nworld had ever loved.  Her notion of the passion was parasitic: man the\r\ntree, woman the bine: but the bine was flame to enwind and to soar,\r\nserpent to defend, immortal flowers to crown.  The choice her parents had\r\nmade for her in Dudley, behind the mystery she had scent of, nipped her\r\ndream, and prepared her to meet, as it were, the fireside of a November\r\nday instead of springing up and into the dawn's blue of full summer with\r\nswallows on wing.  Her station in exile at the Wells of the weariful\r\nrich, under the weight of the sullen secret, unenlivened by Dudley's\r\ncourtship, subdued her to the world's decrees; phrased thus: 'I am not to\r\nbe a heroine.'  The one golden edge to the view was, that she would\r\ngreatly please her father.\r\n\r\nHer dream of a love was put away like a botanist's pressed weed.  But\r\nafter hearing Judith Marsett's wild sobs, it had no place in her\r\ncherishing.  For, above all, the unhappy woman protested love to have\r\nbeen the cause of her misery.  She moaned of 'her Ned'; of his goodness,\r\nhis deceitfulness, her trustfulness; his pride and the vileness of his\r\nfriends; her longsuffering and her break down of patience.  It was done\r\nfor the proof of her unworthiness of Nesta's friendship: that she might\r\nbe renounced, and embraced.  She told the pathetic half of her story, to\r\nsuit the gentle ear, whose critical keenness was lost in compassion.  How\r\ndeep the compassion, mixed with the girl's native respect for the evil-\r\nfortuned, may be judged by her inaccessibility to a vulgar tang that she\r\nwas aware of in the deluge of the torrent, where Innocence and Ned and\r\nLove and a proud Family and that beast Worrell rolled together in leaping\r\nand shifting involutions.\r\n\r\nA darkness of thunder was on the girl.  Although she was not one to\r\nshrink beneath it like the small bird of the woods, she had to say within\r\nherself many times, 'I shall see Captain Dartrey to-morrow,' for a\r\nrecovery and a nerving.  And with her thought of him, her tooth was at\r\nher underlip, she struggled abashed, in hesitation over men's views of\r\nher sex, and how to bring a frank mind to meet him; to be sure of his not\r\nat heart despising; until his character swam defined and bright across\r\nher scope.  'He is good to women.'  Fragments of conversation,\r\nprincipally her father's, had pictured Captain Dartrey to her most\r\nmanfully tolerant toward a frivolous wife.\r\n\r\nHe came early in the morning, instantly after breakfast.\r\n\r\nNot two minutes had passed before she was at home with him.  His words,\r\nhis looks, revived her spirit of romance, gave her the very landscapes,\r\nand new ones.  Yes, he was her hero.  But his manner made him also an\r\nadored big brother, stamped splendid by the perils of life.  He sat\r\nsquare, as if alert to rise, with an elbow on a knee, and the readiest\r\nturn of head to speakers, the promptest of answers, eyes that were a\r\nbrighter accent to the mouth, so vividly did look accompany tone.  He\r\nrallied her, chatted and laughed; pleased the ladies by laughing at\r\nColney Durance, and inspired her with happiness when he spoke of\r\nEngland:--that 'One has to be in exile awhile, to see the place she\r\ntakes.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, Captain Dartrey, I do like to hear you say so,' she cried; his voice\r\nwas reassuring also in other directions: it rang of true man.\r\n\r\nHe volunteered, however, a sad admission, that England had certainly lost\r\nsomething of the great nation's proper conception of Force: the meaning\r\nof it, virtue of it, and need for it.  'She bleats for a lesson, and will\r\nget her lesson.'\r\n\r\nBut if we have Captain Dartrey, we shall come through!  So said the\r\nsparkle of Nesta's eyes.\r\n\r\n'She is very like her father,' he said to the ladies.\r\n\r\n'We think so,' they remarked.\r\n\r\n'There's the mother too,' said he; and Nesta saw that the ladies\r\nshadowed.\r\n\r\nThey retired.  Then she begged him to 'tell her of her own dear mother.'\r\nThe news gave comfort, except for the suspicion, that the dear mother was\r\nbeing worn by her entertaining so largely.  'Papa is to blame,' said\r\nNesta.\r\n\r\n'A momentary strain.  Your father has an idea of Parliament; one of the\r\nLondon Boroughs.'\r\n\r\n'And I, Captain Dartrey, when do I go back to them?'\r\n\r\n'Your mother comes down to consult with you.  And now, do we ride\r\ntogether?'\r\n\r\n'You are free?'\r\n\r\n'My uncle, Lord Clan, lets me out.'\r\n\r\n'To-day?'\r\n\r\n'Why, yes!'\r\n\r\n'This morning?'\r\n\r\n'In an hour's time.'\r\n\r\n'I will be ready.'\r\n\r\nNesta sent a line of excuse to Mrs. Marsett, throwing in a fervent\r\nadjective for balm.\r\n\r\nThat fair person rode out with the troop under conduct of the hallowing\r\nsquire of the stables, and passed by Nesta on horseback beside Dartrey\r\nFenellan at the steps of a huge hotel; issuing from which, pretty Mrs.\r\nBlathenoy was about to mount.  Mrs. Marsett looked ahead and coloured,\r\nbut she could not restrain one look at Nesta, that embraced her cavalier.\r\nNesta waved hand to her, and nodded.  Mrs. Marsett withdrew her eyes; her\r\ndoing so, silent though it was, resembled the drag back to sea of the\r\nshingle-wave below her, such a screaming of tattle she heard in the\r\nquestions discernible through the attitude of the cavalier and of the\r\nlady, who paused to stare, before the leap up in the saddle.  'Who is\r\nshe?--what is she?--how did you know her?--where does she come from?--\r\nwears her hat on her brows!--huge gauntlets out of style!--shady! shady!\r\nshady!'  And as always during her nervous tumults, the name of Worrell\r\nmade diapason of that execrable uproar.  Her hat on her brows had an air\r\nof dash, defying a world it could win, as Ned well knew.  But she scanned\r\nher gauntlets disapprovingly.  This town, we are glad to think, has a\r\nbright repute for glove-shops.  And Mrs. Marsett could applaud herself\r\nfor sparing Ned's money; she had mended her gloves, if they were in the\r\nfashion.--But how does the money come?  Hark at that lady and that\r\ngentleman questioning Miss Radnor of everything, everything in the world\r\nabout her!  Not a word do they get from Miss Radnor.  And it makes them\r\nthe more inquisitive.  Idle rich people, comfortably fenced round, are so\r\ninquisitive!  And Mrs. Marsett, loving Nesta for the notice of her,\r\nmaddened by the sting of tongues it was causing, heard the wash of the\r\nbeach, without consciousness of analogies, but with a body ready to jump\r\nout of skin, out of life, in desperation at the sound.\r\n\r\nShe was all impulse; a shifty piece of unmercenary stratagem occasionally\r\ndirecting it.  Arrived at her lodgings, she wrote to Nesta: 'I entreat\r\nyou not to notice me, if you pass me on the road again.  Let me drop,\r\nnever mind how low I go.  I was born to be wretched.  A line from you,\r\njust a line now and then, only to show me I am not forgotten.  I have had\r\na beautiful dream.  I am not bad in reality; I love goodness, I know.\r\nI cling to the thought of you, as my rescue, I declare.  Please, let me\r\nhear: if it's not more than \"good day\" and your initials on a post-card.'\r\n\r\nThe letter brought Nesta in person to her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE BURDEN UPON NESTA\r\n\r\nCould there be confidences on the subject of Mrs. Marsett with Captain\r\nDartrey?--Nesta timidly questioned her heart: she knocked at an iron door\r\nshut upon a thing alive.  The very asking froze her, almost to stopping\r\nher throbs of pity for the woman.  With Captain Dartrey, if with any one;\r\nbut with no one.  Not with her mother even.  Toward her mother, she felt\r\nguilty of knowing.  Her mother had a horror of that curtain.  Nesta had\r\nseen it, and had taken her impressions; she, too, shrank from it; the\r\nmore when impelled to draw near it.  Louise de Seilles would have been\r\nanother self; Louise was away; when to return, the dear friend could not\r\nstate.  Speaking in her ear, would have been possible; the theme\r\nprecluded writing.\r\n\r\nIt was ponderous combustible new knowledge of life for a girl to hold\r\nunaided.  In the presence of the simple silvery ladies Dorothea and\r\nVirginia, she had qualms, as if she were breaking out in spots before\r\nthem.  The ladies fancied, that Mr. Stuart Rem had hinted to them oddly\r\nof the girl; and that he might have meant, she appeared a little too\r\ncognizant of poor Mr. Abram Posterley's malady--as girls in these\r\nterrible days, only too frequently, too brazenly, are.  They discoursed\r\nto her of the degeneracy of the manners, nay, the morals of young\r\nEnglishwomen, once patterns!  They sketched the young English gentlewoman\r\nof their time; indeed a beauty; with round red cheeks, and rounded open\r\neyes, and a demure shut mouth, a puppet's divine ignorance; inoffensive\r\nin the highest degree, rightly worshipped.  They were earnest, and Nesta\r\nstruck at herself.  She wished to be as they had been, reserving her\r\npainful independence.\r\n\r\nThey were good: they were the ideal women of our country; which demands\r\nif it be but the semblance of the sureness of stationary excellence;\r\nsuch as we have in Sevres and Dresden, polished bright and smooth as\r\never by the morning's flick of a duster; perhaps in danger of accidents--\r\naccidents must be kept away; but enviable, admirable, we think, when we\r\nare not thinking of seed sown or help given to the generations to follow.\r\nNesta both envied and admired; she revered them; yet her sharp\r\nintelligence, larger in the extended boundary of thought coming of\r\nstrange crimson-lighted new knowledge, discerned in a dimness what blest\r\nconditions had fixed them on their beautiful barren eminence.  Without\r\nchallengeing it, she had a rebellious rush of sympathy for our evil-\r\nfortuned of the world; the creatures in the battle, the wounded, trodden,\r\nmud-stained: and it alarmed her lest she should be at heart one out of\r\nthe fold.\r\n\r\nShe had the sympathy, nevertheless, and renewing and increasing with the\r\npulsations of a compassion that she took for her reflective survey.  The\r\nnext time she saw Dartrey Fenellan, she was assured of him, as being the\r\nman who might be spoken to; and by a woman: though not by a girl; not\r\nspoken to by her.  The throb of the impulse precipitating speech subsided\r\nto a dumb yearning.  He noticed her look: he was unaware of the human sun\r\nin the girl's eyes taking an image of him for permanent habitation in her\r\nbreast.  That face of his, so clearly lined, quick, firm, with the blue\r\nsmile on it like the gleam of a sword coming out of sheath, did not mean\r\nhardness, she could have vowed.  O that some woman, other than the\r\nunhappy woman herself, would speak the words denied to a girl!  He was\r\nthe man who would hearken and help.  Essential immediate help was to be\r\ngiven besides the noble benevolence of mind.  Novel ideas of manliness\r\nand the world's need for it were printed on her understanding.  For what\r\ncould women do in aid of a good cause!  She fawned: she deemed herself\r\nvery despicably her hero's inferior.  The thought of him enclosed her.\r\nIn a prison, the gaoler is a demi-God-hued bright or black, as it may be;\r\nand, by the present arrangement between the sexes, she, whom the world\r\nallowed not to have an intimation from eye or ear, or from nature's\r\nblood-ripeness in commune with them, of certain matters, which it suffers\r\nto be notorious, necessarily directed her appeal almost in worship to the\r\nman, who was the one man endowed to relieve, and who locked her mouth for\r\nshame.\r\n\r\nThus was she, too, being put into her woman's harness of the bit and the\r\nblinkers, and taught to know herself for the weak thing, the gentle\r\nparasite, which the fiction of our civilization expects her, caressingly\r\nand contemptuously, to become in the active, while it is exacted of hero\r\nComedy of Clowns!--that in the passive she be a rockfortress impregnable,\r\nnot to speak of magically encircled.  She must also have her feelings;\r\nshe must not be an unnatural creature.  And she must have a sufficient\r\nintelligence; for her stupidity does not flatter the possessing man.  It\r\nis not an organic growth that he desires in his mate, but a happy\r\ncomposition.  You see the world which comes of the pair.\r\n\r\nThis burning Nesta, Victor's daughter, tempered by Nataly's milder blood,\r\nwas a girl in whom the hard shocks of the knowledge of life, perforce of\r\nthe hardness upon pure metal, left a strengthening for generous\r\nimagination.  She did not sit to brood on her injured senses or set them\r\nthrough speculation touching heat; they were taken up and consumed by the\r\nfire of her mind.  Nor had she leisure for the abhorrences, in a heart\r\nall flowing to give aid, and uplift and restore.  Self was as urgent in\r\nher as in most of the young; but the gift of humour, which had previously\r\ndiverted it, was now the quick feeling for her sisterhood, through the\r\none piteous example she knew; and broadening it, through her insurgent\r\nabasement on their behalf, which was her scourged pride of sex.  She but\r\nfaintly thought of blaming the men whom her soul besought for justice,\r\nfor common kindness, to women.  There was the danger, that her aroused\r\nyoung ignorance would charge the whole of the misery about and abroad\r\nupon the stronger of those two: and another danger, that the vision of\r\nthe facts below the surface would discolour and disorder her views of\r\nexistence.  But she loved, she sprang to, the lighted world; and she had\r\nfigures of male friends, to which to cling; and they helped in animating\r\nglorious historical figures on the world's library-shelves or under yet\r\npalpitating earth.  Promise of a steady balance of her nature, too, was\r\nshown in the absence of any irritable urgency to be doing, when her bosom\r\nbled to help.  Beyond the resolve, that she would not abandon the woman\r\nwho had made confession to her, she formed no conscious resolutions.  Far\r\nahead down her journey of the years to come, she did see muffled things\r\nshe might hope and would strive to do.  They were chrysalis shapes.\r\nAbove all, she flew her blind quickened heart on the wings of an\r\nimaginative force; and those of the young who can do that, are in their\r\nblood incorruptible by dark knowledge, irradiated under darkness in the\r\nmind.  Let but the throb be kept for others.  That is the one secret, for\r\nredemption; if not for preservation.\r\n\r\nVictor descended on his marine London to embrace his girl, full of\r\nregrets at Fredi's absence from the great whirl 'overhead,' as places of\r\nmultitudinous assembly, where he shone, always appeared to him.  But it\r\nwas not to last long; she would soon be on the surface again!  At the\r\nfirst clasp of her, he chirped some bars of her song.  He challenged her\r\nto duet before the good ladies, and she kindled, she was caught up by his\r\ngaiety, wondering at herself; faintly aware of her not being spontaneous.\r\nAnd she made her father laugh, just in the old way; and looked at herself\r\nin his laughter, with the thought, that she could not have become so\r\nchanged; by which the girl was helped to jump to her humour.  Victor\r\nturned his full front to Dorothea and Virginia, one sunny beam of delight\r\nand although it was Mr. Stuart Rem who was naughty Nesta's victim, and\r\nalthough it seemed a trespass on her part to speak in such a manner of a\r\nclerical gentleman, they were seized; they were the opposite partners of\r\na laughing quadrille, lasting till they were tired out.\r\n\r\nVictor had asked his girl, if she sang on a Sunday.  The ladies\r\nremembered, that she had put the question for permission to Mr. Stuart\r\nRem, who was opposed to secular singing.\r\n\r\n'And what did he say?' said Victor.\r\n\r\nNesta shook her head: 'It was not what he said, papa; it was his look.\r\nHis duty compelled him, though he loves music.  He had the look of a\r\nPatriarch putting his handmaiden away into the desert.'\r\n\r\nDorothea and Virginia, in spite of protests within, laughed to streams.\r\nThey recollected the look; she had given the portrait of Mr. Stuart Rem\r\nin the act of repudiating secular song.\r\n\r\n'Victor conjured up a day when this darling Fredi, a child, stood before\r\na famous picture in the Brera, at Milan; when he and her mother noticed\r\nthe child's very studious graveness; and they had talked of it; he\r\nremarking, that she disapproved of the Patriarch; and Nataly, that she\r\nwas taken with Hagar's face.\r\n\r\nHe seemed surprised at her not having heard from Dudley.\r\n\r\n'How is that?' said he.\r\n\r\n'Most probably because he has not written, papa.'\r\n\r\nHe paused after the cool reply.  She had no mournful gaze at all;\r\nbut in the depths of the clear eyes he knew so well, there was a coil\r\nof something animate, whatever it might be.  And twice she drew a heavy\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nHe mentioned it in London.  Nataly telegraphed at night for her girl to\r\nmeet her next day at Dartrey's hotel.\r\n\r\nTheir meeting was incomprehensibly joyless to the hearts of each,\r\nthough it was desired, and had long been desired, and mother was mother,\r\ndaughter daughter, without diminution of love between them.  They held\r\nhands, they kissed and clasped, they showered their tender phrases with\r\nfull warm truth, and looked into eyes and surely saw one another.  But\r\nthe heart of each was in a battle of its own, taking wounds or crying for\r\nsupports.  Whether to speak to her girl at once, despite the now vehement\r\ncontrary counsel of Victor, was Nataly's deliberation, under the thought\r\nof the young creature's perplexity in not seeing her at the house of the\r\nDuvidney ladies: while Nesta conjured in a flash the past impressions of\r\nher mother's shrinking distaste from any such hectic themes as this which\r\nburdened and absorbed her; and she was almost joining to it, through\r\nsympathy with any thought or feeling of one in whom she had such pride;\r\nshe had the shudder of revulsion.  Further, Nataly put on, rather\r\ncravenly an air, of distress, or she half designingly permitted her\r\ntrouble to be seen, by way of affecting her girl's recollection when\r\nthe confession was to come, that Nesta might then understand her to have\r\nbeen restrained from speaking, not evasive of her duty.  The look was\r\ninterpreted by Nesta as belonging to the social annoyances dating, in her\r\ncalendar, from Creckholt, apprehensively dreaded at Lakelands.  She\r\nhinted asking, and her mother nodded; not untruthfully; but she put on a\r\nbriskness after the nod; and a doubt was driven into Nesta's bosom.\r\n\r\nHer dear Skepsey was coming down to her for a holiday, she was glad to\r\nhear.  Of Dudley, there was no word.  Nataly shunned his name, with a\r\nsuperstitious dread lest any mention of him should renew pretensions that\r\nshe hoped, and now supposed, were quite withdrawn.  So she had told poor\r\nMr. Barmby only yesterday, at his humble request to know.  He had seen\r\nDudley on the pantiles, walking with a young lady, he said.  And 'he\r\nfeared,' he said; using, a pardonable commonplace of deceit.  Her\r\ncompassion accounted for the 'fear' which was the wish, and caused her\r\nnot to think it particularly strange, that he should imagine Dudley to\r\nhave quitted the field.  Now that a disengaged Dartrey Fenellan was at\r\nhand, poor Mr. Barmby could have no chance.\r\n\r\nDartrey came to her room by appointment.  She wanted to see him alone,\r\nand he informed her, that Mrs. Blathenoy was in the hotel, and would\r\ncertainly receive and amuse Nesta for any length of time.\r\n\r\n'I will take her up,' said Nataly, and rose, and she sat immediately,\r\nand fluttered a hand at her breast.  She laughed: 'Perhaps I'm tired!'\r\n\r\nDartrey took Nesta.\r\n\r\nHe returned, saying: 'There's a lift in the hotel.  Do the stairs affect\r\nyou at all?'\r\n\r\nShe fenced his sharp look.  'Laziness, I fancy; age is coming on.  How is\r\nit Mrs. Blathenoy is here?'\r\n\r\n'Well!  how?'  'Foolish curiosity?'  'I think I have made her of service.\r\nI did not bring the lady here.'  'Of service to whom?'  'Why, to Victor!'\r\n'Has Victor commissioned you?'  'You can bear to hear it.  Her husband\r\nknows the story.   He has a grudge .  .  .  commercial reasons.  I fancy\r\nit is, that Victor stood against his paper at the table of the Bank.\r\nBlathenoy vowed blow for blow.  But I think the little woman holds him\r\nin.  She says she does.'  'Victor prompted you?'  'It occurred as it\r\noccurred.'  'She does it for love of us?--Oh!  I can't trifle.\r\nDartrey!'  'Tell me.'  'First, you haven't let me know what you think of\r\nmy Nesta.'  'She's a dear good girl.'  'Not so interesting to you as a\r\nflighty little woman!'  'She has a speck of some sort on her mind.'\r\nNataly spied at Dudley's behaviour, and said: 'That will wear away.  Is\r\nMr. Blathenoy much here?'  'As often as he can come, I believe.'  'That\r\nis .  .  . ?'  'I have seen him twice.'  'His wife remains?' 'Fixed here\r\nfor the season.'  'My friend!'  'No harm, no harm!'  'But-to her!'  'You\r\nhave my word of honour.'  'Yes: and she is doing you a service, at your\r\nrequest; you occasionally reward her with thanks; and she sees you are a\r\nman of honour.  Do you not know women?'\r\n\r\nDartrey blew his pooh-pooh on feminine suspicions.  'There's very little\r\nleft of the Don Amoroso in me.  Women don't worship stone figures.'\r\n\r\n'They do: like the sea-birds.  And what do you say to me, Dartrey?--I can\r\nconfess it: I am one of them: I love you.  When last you left England, I\r\nkissed your hand.  It was because of your manly heart in that stone\r\nfigure.  I kept from crying: you used to scorn us English for the\r\n\"whimpering fits\" you said we enjoy and must have in books, if we can't\r\nget them up for ourselves.  I could have prayed to have you as brother or\r\nson.  I love my Victor the better for his love of you.  Oh!--poor soul--\r\nhow he is perverted since that building of Lakelands!  He cannot take\r\nsoundings of the things he does.  Formerly he confided in me, in all\r\nthings: now not one;--I am the chief person to deceive.  If only he had\r\nwaited!  We are in a network of intrigues and schemes, every artifice in\r\nLondon--tempting one to hate simple worthy people, who naturally have\r\ntheir views, and see me an impostor, and tolerate me, fascinated by him:\r\n--or bribed--it has to be said.  There are ways of bribeing.  I trust he\r\nmay not have in the end to pay too heavily for succeeding.  He seems a\r\nman pushed by Destiny; not irresponsible, but less responsible than most.\r\nHe is desperately tempted by his never failing.  Whatever he does!  .  .\r\nit is true!  And it sets me thinking of those who have never had an\r\nailment, up to a certain age, when the killing blow comes.  Latterly I\r\nhave seen into him: I never did before.  Had I been stronger, I might\r\nhave saved, or averted .  .  .  .  But, you will say, the stronger woman\r\nwould not have occupied my place.  I must have been blind too.  I did not\r\nsee, that his nature shrinks from the thing it calls up.  He dreads the\r\nexposure he courts--or has to combat with all his powers.  It has been a\r\nrevelation to me of him life as well.  Nothing stops him.  Now it is\r\nParliament--a vacant London Borough.  He counts on a death:\r\nAh! terrible! I have it like a snake's bite night and day.'\r\n\r\nNataly concluded: 'There: it has done me some good to speak.  I feel so\r\nbase.'  She breathed heavily.\r\n\r\nDartrey took her hand and bent his lips to it.  'Happy the woman who has\r\nnot more to speak!  How long will Nesta stay here?'\r\n\r\n'You will watch over her, Dartrey?  She stays-her father wishes--up to--\r\nah!  We can hardly be in such extreme peril.  He has her doctor, her\r\nlawyer, and her butler--a favourite servant--to check, and influence,\r\nher: She--you know who it is!--does not, I am now convinced, mean\r\npersecution.  She was never a mean-minded woman.  Oh! I could wish she\r\nwere.  They say she is going.  Then I am to be made an \"honest woman of.\"\r\nVictor wants Nesta, now that she is away, to stay until .  .  .  You\r\nunderstand.  He feels she is safe from any possible kind of harm with\r\nthose good ladies.  And I feel she is the safer for having you near.\r\nOtherwise, how I should pray to have you with us!  Daily I have to pass\r\nthrough, well, something like the ordeal of the red-hot ploughshares--\r\nand without the innocence, dear friend!  But it's best that my girl\r\nshould not have to be doing the same; though she would have the\r\ninnocence.  But she writhes under any shadow of a blot.  And for her to\r\nlearn the things that are in the world, through her mother's history!--\r\nand led to know it by the falling away of friends, or say, acquaintances!\r\nHowever ignorant at present, she learns from a mere nothing.  I dread!\r\n.  .  .  .  In a moment, she is a blaze of light.  There have been\r\noccurrences.  Only Victor could have overcome them!  I had to think it\r\nbetter for my girl, that she was absent.  We are in such a whirl up\r\nthere!  So I work round again to \"how long?\" and the picture of myself\r\ncounting the breaths of a dying woman.  The other day I was told I was\r\nenvied!'\r\n\r\n'Battle, battle, battle; for all of us, in every position!' said Dartrey\r\nsharply, to clip a softness: 'except when one's attending on an invalid\r\nuncle.  Then it's peace; rather like extinction.  And I can't be crying\r\nfor the end either.  I bite my moustache and tap foot on the floor, out\r\nof his hearing; make believe I'm patient.  Now I 'll fetch Nesta.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy came down with an arm on Nesta's shoulder.  She held a\r\ntelegram, and said to Nataly\r\n\r\n'What can this mean?  It's from my husband; he puts \"Jacob\": my husband's\r\nChristian name:--so like my husband, where there's no concealment!\r\nThere--he says:\r\n\r\n\"Down to-night else pack ready start to-morrow.\"  Can it signify, affairs\r\nare bad with my husband in the city?'\r\n\r\nIt had that signification to Nataly's understanding.  At the same time,\r\nthe pretty little woman's absurd lisping repetition of 'my husband' did\r\nnot seem without design to inflict the wound it caused.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it was not malicious; it came of the bewitchment of a silly\r\ntongue by her knowledge of the secret to be controlled: and after\r\ncontrasting her fortunes with Nataly's, on her way downstairs, she had\r\ncomforted herself by saying, that at least she had a husband.  She was\r\nnot aware that she dealt a hurt until she had found a small consolation\r\nin the indulgence: for Captain Dartrey Fenellan admired this commanding\r\nfigure of a woman, who could not legally say that which the woman he\r\nadmired less, if at all, legally could say.\r\n\r\n'I must leave you to interpret,' Nataly remarked.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blathenoy resented her unbefitting queenly style.  For this reason,\r\nshe abstained from an intended leading up to mention of the 'singular-\r\nlooking lady' seen riding with Miss Radnor more than once; and as to\r\nwhom, Miss Radnor (for one gives her the name) had not just now, when\r\nquestioned, spoken very clearly.  So the mother's alarms were not raised.\r\n\r\nAnd really it was a pity, Mrs. Blathenoy said to Dartrey subsequently;\r\nfinding him colder than before Mrs. Radnor's visit; it was a pity,\r\nbecause a young woman in Miss Radnor's position should not by any\r\npossibility be seen in association with a person of commonly doubtful\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nShe was denied the petulant satisfaction of rousing the championship\r\nbitter to her.  Dartrey would not deliver an opinion on Miss Radnor's\r\nconduct.  He declined, moreover, to assist in elucidating the telegram by\r\n'looking here,' and poring over the lines beside a bloomy cheek.  He was\r\npetulantly whipped on the arm with her glove, and pouted at.  And it was\r\nthen--and then only or chiefly through Nataly's recent allusion--that the\r\nman of honour had his quakings in view of the quagmire, where he was\r\nplanted on an exceedingly narrow causeway, not of the firmest.  For she\r\nwas a pretty little woman, one of the prize gifts of the present\r\neducation of women to the men who are for having them quiescent domestic\r\npatterns; and her artificial ingenuousness or candid frivolities came to\r\nher by nature to kindle the nature of the gentleman on the other bank of\r\nthe stream, and witch him to the plunge, so greatly mutually regretted\r\nafter taken: an old duet to the moon.\r\n\r\nDartrey escaped to the Club, where he had a friend.  The friend was\r\nColonel Sudley, one of the modern studious officers, not in good\r\nesteem with the authorities.  He had not forgiven Dartrey for the\r\nintemperateness which cut off a brilliant soldier from the service.\r\nHe was reduced to acknowledge, however, that there was a sparkling\r\ndefence for him to reply with, in the shape of a fortune gained and\r\nwhere we have a Society forcing us to live up to an expensive level,\r\nvery trying to a soldier's income, a fortune gained will offer excuses\r\nfor misconduct short of disloyal or illegal.  They talked of the state of\r\nthe Army: we are moving.  True, and at the last Review, the 'march past'\r\nwas performed before a mounted generalissimo profoundly asleep, head on\r\nbreast.  Our English military 'moving' may now be likened to Somnolency\r\non Horseback.  'Oh, come, no rancour,' said the colonel; 'you know he's a\r\nkind old boy at heart; nowhere a more affectionate man alive!'\r\n\r\n'So the sycophants are sure of posts!'\r\n\r\n'Come, I say!  He's devoted to the Service.'\r\n\r\n'Invalid him, and he shall have a good epitaph.'\r\n\r\n'He's not so responsible as the taxpayer.'\r\n\r\n'There you touch home.  Mother Goose can't imagine the need for defence\r\nuntil a hand's at her feathers.'\r\n\r\n'What about her shrieks now and then?'\r\n\r\n'Indigestion of a surfeit?'\r\n\r\nThey were in a laughing wrangle when two acquaintances of the colonel's\r\ncame near.  One of them recognized Dartrey.  He changed a prickly subject\r\nto one that is generally as acceptable to the servants of Mars.  His\r\ncompanion said: 'Who is the girl out with Judith Marsett?'  He flavoured\r\neulogies of the girl's good looks in easy garrison English.  She was\r\npraised for sitting her horse well.  One had met her on the parade, in\r\nthe afternoon, walking with Mrs. Marsett.  Colonel Sudley had seen them\r\non horseback.  He remarked to Dartrey:\r\n\r\n'And by the way, you're a clean stretch ahead of us.  I've seen you go by\r\nthese windows, with the young lady on one side, and a rather pretty woman\r\non the other too.'\r\n\r\n'Nothing is unseen in this town!' Dartrey rejoined.\r\n\r\nStrolling to his quarters along the breezy parade at night, he proposed\r\nto himself, that he would breathe an immediate caution to Nesta.  How had\r\nshe come to know this Mrs. Marsett?  But he was more seriously thinking\r\nof what Colney Durance called 'The Mustard Plaster'; the satirist's\r\nphrase for warm relations with a married fair one: and Dartrey, clear of\r\nany design to have it at his breast, was beginning to take intimations of\r\npricks and burns.  They are an almost positive cure of inflammatory\r\ninternal conditions.  They were really hard on him, who had none to be\r\ncured.\r\n\r\nThe hour was nigh midnight.  As he entered his hotel, the porter ran off\r\nto the desk in his box, and brought him a note, saying, that a lady had\r\nleft it at half-past nine.  Left it?--Then the lady could not be the\r\nalarming lady.  He was relieved.  The words of the letter were\r\ncabalistic; these, beneath underlined address:\r\n\r\n'I beg you to call on me, if I do not see you this evening.  It is\r\nurgent; you will excuse me when I explain.  Not late to-morrow.  I am\r\nsure you will not fail to come.  I could write what would be certain to\r\nbring you.  I dare not trust any names to paper.'\r\n\r\nThe signature was, Judith Marsett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nSHOWS HOW THE SQUIRES IN A CONQUEROR'S SERVICE HAVE AT TIMES TO DO\r\nKNIGHTLY CONQUEST OF THEMSELVES\r\n\r\nBy the very earliest of the trains shot away to light and briny air from\r\nLondon's November gloom, which knows the morning through increase of\r\ngasjets, little Skepsey was hurried over suburban chimneys, in his\r\nfriendly third-class carriage; where we have reminders of ancient\r\npastoral times peculiar to our country, as it may chance; but where a man\r\nmay speak to his neighbour right off without being deemed offensive.\r\nThat is homely.  A social fellow knitting closely to his fellows when he\r\nmeets them, enjoys it, even at the cost of uncushioned seats he can, if\r\nimps are in him, merryandrew as much as he pleases; detested punctilio\r\ndoes not reign there; he can proselytize for the soul's welfare; decry\r\nor uphold the national drink; advertize a commercial Firm deriving\r\nprosperity from the favour of the multitude; exhort to patriotism.  All\r\nis accepted.  Politeness is the rule, according to Skepsey's experience\r\nof the Southern part of the third-class kingdom.  And it is as well to\r\nmark the divisions, for the better knowledge of our countrymen.  The\r\nNorth requires volumes to itself.\r\n\r\nThe hard-grained old pirate-stock Northward has built the land, and is to\r\nthe front when we are at our epic work.  Meanwhile it gets us a blowzy\r\ncharacter, by shouldering roughly among the children of civilization.\r\nSkepsey, journeying one late afternoon up a Kentish line, had, in both\r\nsenses of the word, encountered a long-limbed navvy; an intoxicated, he\r\nwas compelled by his manly modesty to desire to think; whose loathly\r\ntalk, forced upon the hearing of a decent old woman opposite him, passed\r\nbaboonish behaviour; so much so, that Skepsey civilly intervened;\r\nsubsequently inviting him to leave the carriage and receive a lesson at\r\nthe station they were nearing.  Upon his promising faithfully, that it\r\nshould be a true and telling lesson, the navvy requested this pygmy spark\r\nto flick his cheek, merely to show he meant war in due sincerity; and he\r\nas faithfully, all honour, promising not to let it bring about a breakage\r\nof the laws of the Company, Skepsey promptly did the deed.  So they went\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nSkepsey alluded to the incident, for an example of the lamentable\r\ndeficiency in science betrayed by most of our strong men when put to it;\r\nand the bitter thought, that he could count well nigh to a certainty on\r\nthe total absence of science in the long-armed navvy, whose fist on his\r\nnose might have been as the magnet of a pin, was chief among his\r\nreminiscences after the bout, destroying pleasure for the lover of Old\r\nEngland's might.  One blow would have sent Skepsey travelling.  He was\r\nnot seriously struck once.  They parted, shaking hands; the navvy\r\nconfessing himself to have 'drunk a drop'; and that perhaps accounted for\r\nhis having been 'topped by a dot on him.'\r\n\r\nHe declined to make oath never to repeat his offence; but said, sending\r\nhis vanquisher to the deuce, with an amicable push at his shoulder,\r\n'Damned if I ever forget five foot five stretched six foot flat!'\r\n\r\nSkepsey counted his feet some small amount higher; but our hearty rovers'\r\nsons have their ballad moods when giving or taking a thrashing.  One of\r\nthe third-class passengers, a lad of twenty, became Skepsey's pupil, and\r\nturned out clever with the gloves, and was persuaded to enter the\r\nmilitia, and grew soon to be a corporal.  Thus there was profit of the\r\naffair, though the navvy sank out of sight.  Let us hope and pray he will\r\nnot insult the hearing of females again.  If only females knew how\r\nnecessary it is, for their sakes, to be able to give a lesson now and\r\nthen!  Ladies are positively opposed.  And Judges too, who dress so like\r\nthem.  The manhood of our country is kept down, in consequence.  Mr.\r\nDurance was right, when he said something about the state of war being\r\nwanted to weld our races together: and yet we are always praying for\r\nthe state of peace, which causes cracks and gaps among us!  Was that\r\nwhat he meant by illogical?  It seemed to Skepsey--oddly, considering\r\nhis inferior estimate of the value of the fair sex--that a young woman\r\nwith whom he had recently made acquaintance; and who was in Brighton now,\r\nupon missionary work; a member of the 'Army,' an officer of advancing\r\nrank, Matilda Pridden, by name; was nearer to the secret of the right\r\ncourse of conduct for individual citizens and the entire country than any\r\ngentleman he knew.\r\n\r\nYes, nearer to it than his master was!  Thinking of Mr. Victor Radnor,\r\nSkepsey fetched a sigh.  He had knocked at his master's door at the\r\noffice one day, and imagining the call to enter, had done so, and had\r\nseen a thing he could not expunge.  Lady Grace Halley was there.  From\r\nmatters he gathered, Skepsey guessed her to be working for his master\r\namong the great folks, as he did with Jarniman, and Mr. Fenellan with Mr.\r\nCarling.  But is it usual; he asked himself--his natural veneration\r\nframing the rebuke to his master thus--to repay the services of a lady\r\nso warmly?--We have all of us an ermined owl within us to sit in\r\njudgement of our superiors as well as our equals; and the little man,\r\nnotwithstanding a servant's bounden submissiveness, was forced to hear\r\nthe judicial pronouncement upon his master's behaviour.  His master had,\r\nat the same time, been saying most weighty kind words more and more of\r\nlate: one thing:--that, if he gave all he had to his fellows, and did all\r\nhe could, he should still be in their debt.  And he was a very wealthy\r\ngentleman.  What are we to think?  The ways of our superiors are\r\nwonderful.  We do them homage: still we feel, we painfully feel, we are\r\nbeginning to worship elsewhere.  It is the pain of a detachment of the\r\nvery roots of our sea-weed heart from a rock.  Mr. Victor Radnor was an\r\nhonour to his country.  Skepsey did not place the name of Matilda Pridden\r\nbeside it or in any way compare two such entirely different persons.  At\r\nthe same time and most earnestly, while dreading to hear, he desired to\r\nhave Matilda Pridden's opinion of the case distressing him.  He never\r\ncould hear it, because he could never be allowed to expound the case to\r\nher.  Skepsey sighed again: he as much as uttered: Oh, if we had a few\r\nthousands like her!--But what if we do have them?  They won't marry!\r\nThere they are, all that the country requires in wives and mothers; and\r\nlike Miss Priscilla Graves, they won't marry!\r\n\r\nHe looked through sad thoughts across the benches of the compartments to\r\nthe farther end of the carriage, where sat the Rev. Septimus Barmby,\r\nlooking at him through a meditation as obscure if not so mournful.  Few\r\nare the third-class passengers outward at that early hour in the winter\r\nseason, and Skepsey's gymnastics to get beside the Rev. Septimus were\r\nunimpeded; though a tight-packed carriage of us poor journaliers would\r\nnot have obstructed them with as much as a sneer.  Mr. Barmby and Skepsey\r\ngreeted.  The latter said, he had a holiday, to pay a visit to Miss\r\nNesta.  The former said, he hoped he should see Miss Nesta.  Skepsey then\r\nrapidly brought the conversation to a point where Matilda Pridden was\r\ncomprised.  He discoursed of the 'Army' and her position in the Army,\r\ngiving instances of her bravery, the devotion shown by her to the cause\r\nof morality, in all its forms.  Mr. Barmby had his fortunes on his hands\r\nat the moment, he could not lend an attentive ear; and he disliked this\r\nArmy, the title it had taken, and the mixing of women and men in its\r\nranks; not to speak of a presumption in its proceedings, and the public\r\nmarching and singing.  Moreover, he enjoyed his one or two permissible\r\nglasses: he doubted that the Chiefs of the Army had common benevolence\r\nfor the inoffensive pipe.  But the cause of morality was precious to him;\r\nmorality and a fit of softness, and the union of the happiest contrast of\r\nvoices, had set him for a short while, before the dawn of Nesta's day,\r\nhankering after Priscilla Graves.  Skepsey's narrative of Matilda\r\nPridden's work down at the East of London; was effective; it had the ring\r\nto thrill a responsive chord in Mr. Barmby, who mused on London's East,\r\nand martyrly service there.  His present expectations were of a very\r\ndifferent sort; but a beautiful bride, bringing us wealth, is no\r\nmisleading beam, if we direct the riches rightly.  Septimus, a solitary\r\nminister in those grisly haunts of the misery breeding vice, must needs\r\naccomplish less than a Septimus the husband of one of England's chief\r\nheiresses:--only not the most brilliant, owing to circumstances known to\r\nthe Rev. Groseman Buttermore: strangely, and opportunely, revealed: for\r\nher exceeding benefit, it may be hoped.  She is no longer the ignorant\r\ngirl, to reject the protecting hand of one whose cloth is the best of\r\ncloaking.  A glance at Dudley Sowerby's defection, assures our worldly\r\nwisdom too, that now is the time to sue.\r\n\r\nSeveral times while Mr. Barmby made thus his pudding of the desires of\r\nthe flesh and the spirit, Skepsey's tales of Matilda Pridden's heroism\r\ncaught his attention.  He liked her deeds; he disliked the position in\r\nwhich the young woman placed herself to perform them; and he said so.\r\nWomen are to be women, he said.\r\n\r\nSkepsey agreed: 'If we could get men to do the work, sir!'\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby was launching forth: Plenty of men!--His mouth was blocked by\r\nthe reflection, that we count the men on our fingers; often are we, as it\r\nwere, an episcopal thumb surveying scarce that number of followers!  He\r\ndiverged to censure of the marchings and the street-singing: the\r\nimpediment to traffic, the annoyance to a finely musical ear.  He\r\ndisapproved altogether of Matilda Pridden's military display, pronouncing\r\nher to be, 'Doubtless a worthy young person.'\r\n\r\n'Her age is twenty-seven,' said Skepsey, spying at the number of his own.\r\n\r\n'You have known her long?' Mr. Barmby asked.\r\n\r\n'Not long, sir.  She has gone through trouble.  She believes very\r\nstrongly in the will:--If I will this, if I will that, and it is the\r\nright will, not wickedness, it is done--as good as done; and force is\r\nquite superfluous.  In her sermons, she exhorts to prayer before action.'\r\n\r\n'Preaches?'\r\n\r\n'She moves a large assembly, sir.'\r\n\r\n'It would seem, that England is becoming Americanized!' exclaimed the\r\nConservative in Mr. Barmby.  Almost he groaned; and his gaze was fish-\r\nlike in vacancy, on hearing the little man speak of the present intrepid\r\nforwardness of the sex to be publicly doing.  It is for men the most\r\nindigestible fact of our century: one that--by contrast throws an\r\noverearthly holiness on our decorous dutiful mothers, who contentedly\r\nworked below the surface while men unremittingly attended to their\r\ninterests above.\r\n\r\nSkepsey drew forth a paper-covered shilling-book: a translation from the\r\nFrench, under a yelling title of savage hate of Old England and cannibal\r\nglee at her doom.  Mr. Barmby dropped his eyelashes on it, without\r\ncomment; nor did he reply to Skepsey's forlorn remark: 'We let them think\r\nthey could do it!'\r\n\r\nBehold the downs.  Breakfast is behind them.  Miss Radnor likewise: if\r\nthe poor child has a name.  We propose to supply the deficiency.  She\r\ndoes not declare war upon tobacco.  She has a cultured and a beautiful\r\nvoice.  We abstain from enlargeing on the charms of her person.  She has\r\nresources, which representatives of a rival creed would plot to secure.\r\n\r\n'Skepsey, you have your quarters at the house of Miss Radnor's\r\nrelatives?' said Mr. Barmby, as they emerged from tunnelled chalk.\r\n\r\n'Mention, that I think of calling in the course of the day.'\r\n\r\nA biscuit had been their breakfast without a name.\r\n\r\nThey parted at the station, roused by the smell of salt to bestow a more\r\nlegitimate title on the day's restorative beginning.  Down the hill,\r\nalong by the shops, and Skepsey, in sight of Miss Nesta's terrace,\r\nconsidered it still an early hour for a visitor; so, to have the sea\r\nabout him, he paid pier-money, and hurried against the briny wings of a\r\nSouth-wester; green waves, curls of foam, flecks of silver, under low-\r\nflying grey-dark cloud-curtains shaken to a rift, where at one shot the\r\nsun had a line of Nereids nodding, laughing, sparkling to him.  Skepsey\r\nenjoyed it, at the back of thoughts military and naval.  Visible sea,\r\nthis girdle of Britain, inspired him to exultations in reverence.  He\r\nwished Mr. Durance could behold it now and have such a breastful.  He was\r\nwishing he knew a song of Britain and sea, rather fancying Mr. Durance to\r\nbe in some way a bar to patriotic poetical recollection, when he saw his\r\nCaptain Dartrey mounting steps out of an iron anatomy of the pier, and\r\nlooking like a razor off a strap.\r\n\r\n'Why, sir!' cried Skepsey.\r\n\r\n'Just a plunge and a dozen strokes,' Dartrey said; 'and you'll come to my\r\nhotel and give me ten minutes of the \"recreation\"; and if you don't come\r\nwillingly, I shall insult your country.'\r\n\r\n'Ah!  I wish Mr. Durance were here,' Skepsey rejoined.\r\n\r\n'It would upset his bumboat of epigrams.  He rises at ten o'clock to a\r\nqueasy breakfast by candlelight, and proceeds to composition.  His\r\npicture of the country is a portrait of himself by the artist.'\r\n\r\n'But, sir, Captain Dartrey, you don't think as Mr. Durance does of\r\nEngland!'\r\n\r\n'There are lots to flatter her, Skepsey!  A drilling can't do her harm.\r\nYou're down to see Miss Nesta.  Ladies don't receive quite so early.  And\r\nhave you breakfasted?  Come on with me quick.'  Dartrey led him on,\r\nsaying: 'You have an eye at my stick.  It was a legacy to me, by word of\r\nmouth, from a seaman of a ship I sailed in, who thought I had done him a\r\nservice; and he died after all.  He fell overboard drunk.  He perished of\r\nthe villain stuff.  One of his messmates handed me the stick in Cape\r\nTown, sworn to deliver it.  A good knot to grasp; and it 's flexible and\r\nstrong; stick or rattan, whichever you please; it gives point or caresses\r\nthe shoulder; there's no break in it, whack as you may.  They call it a\r\nDemerara supple-jack.  I'll leave it to you.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey declared his intention to be the first to depart.  He tried the\r\ntemper of the stick, bent it a bit, and admired the prompt straightening.\r\n\r\n'It would give a good blow, sir.'\r\n\r\n'Does its business without braining.'\r\n\r\nPerhaps for the reason, that it was not a handsome instrument for display\r\non fashionable promenades, Dartrey chose it among his collection by\r\npreference; as ugly dogs of a known fidelity are chosen for companions.\r\nThe Demerara supple-jack surpasses bull-dogs in its fashion of assisting\r\nthe master; for when once at it, the clownish-looking thing reflects upon\r\nhim creditably, by developing a refined courtliness of style, while in no\r\nway showing a diminution of jolly ardour for the fray.  It will deal you\r\nthe stroke of a bludgeon with the playfulness of a cane.  It bears\r\nresemblance to those accomplished natural actors, who conversationally\r\npresent a dramatic situation in two or three spontaneous flourishes, and\r\nare themselves again, men of the world, the next minute.\r\n\r\nSkepsey handed it back.  He spoke of a new French rifle.  He mentioned,\r\nin the form of query for no answer, the translation of the barking little\r\nvolume he had shown to Mr. Barmby: he slapped at his breast-pocket, where\r\nit was.  Not a ship was on the sea-line; and he seemed to deplore that\r\nvacancy.\r\n\r\n'But it tells both ways,' Dartrey said.  'We don't want to be hectoring\r\nin the Channel.  All we want, is to be sure of our power, so as not to go\r\nhunting and fawning for alliances.  Up along that terrace Miss Nesta\r\nlives.  Brighton would be a choice place for a landing.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey temporized, to get his national defences, by pleading the\r\ncountry's love of peace.\r\n\r\n'Then you give-up your portion of the gains of war--an awful\r\ndisgorgement,' said Dartrey.  'If you are really for peace, you toss\r\nall your spare bones to the war-dogs.  Otherwise, Quakerly preaching is\r\ntaken for hypocrisy.'\r\n\r\n'I 'm afraid we are illogical, sir,' said Skepsey, adopting one of the\r\ncharges of Mr. Durance, to elude the abominable word.\r\n\r\n'In you run, my friend.'  Dartrey sped him up the steps of the hotel.\r\n\r\nA little note lay on his breakfast-table.  His invalid uncle's valet gave\r\nthe morning's report of the night.\r\n\r\nThe note was from Mrs. Blathenoy: she begged Captain Dartrey, in double\r\nunderlinings of her brief words, to mount the stairs.  He debated, and he\r\nwent.\r\n\r\nShe was excited, and showed a bosom compressed to explode: she had been\r\nweeping.  'My husband is off.  He bids me follow him.  What would you\r\nhave me do?'\r\n\r\n'Go.'\r\n\r\n'You don't care what may happen to your friends, the Radnors?'\r\n\r\n'Not at the cost of your separation from your husband.'\r\n\r\n'You have seen him!'\r\n\r\n'Be serious.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, you cold creature!  You know--you see: I can't conceal.  And you\r\ntell me to go.  \"Go!\"  Gracious heavens!  I've no claim on you; I haven't\r\nbeen able to do much; I would have--never mind!  believe me or not.  And\r\nnow I'm to go: on the spot, I suppose.  You've seen the man I 'm to go\r\nto, too.  I would bear it, if it were not away from .  .  .  out of sight\r\nof I'm a fool of a woman, I know.  There's frankness for you! and I could\r\ndeclare you're saying \"impudence\" in your heart--or what you have for\r\none.  Have you one?'\r\n\r\n'My dear soul, it 's a flint.  So just think of your duty.'  Dartrey\r\nplayed the horrid part of executioner with some skill.\r\n\r\nHer bosom sprang to descend into abysses.\r\n\r\n'And never a greater fool than when I sent for you to see such a face as\r\nI'm showing!' she cried, with lips that twitched and fingers that plucked\r\nat her belt.  'But you might feel my hatred of being tied to--dragged\r\nabout over the Continent by that .  .  .  perhaps you think a woman is\r\nnot sensible of vulgarity in her husband!  I 'm bothering you?  I don't\r\nsay I have the slightest claim.  You never made love to me, never!  Never\r\nso much as pressed my hand or looked.  Others have--as much as I let\r\nthem.  And before I saw you, I had not an idea of another man but that\r\nman.  So you advise me to go?'\r\n\r\n'There's no other course.'\r\n\r\n'No other course.  I don't see one.  What have I been dreaming of!\r\nUsually a woman feeling .  .  .'  she struck at her breast, 'has had a\r\nsoft word in her ear.  \"Go!\"  I don't blame you, Captain Dartrey.  At\r\nleast, you 're not the man to punish a woman for stripping herself, as I\r\n've done.  I call myself a fool--I'm a lunatic.  Trust me with your\r\nhand.'\r\n\r\n'There you are.'\r\n\r\nShe grasped the hand, and shut her eyes to make a long age of the holding\r\non to him.  'Oh, you dear dear fellow!--don't think me unwomanly; I must\r\ntell you now: I am naked and can't disguise.  I see you are ice--feel:\r\nand if you were different, I might be.  You won't be hurt by hearing\r\nyou've made yourself dear to me--without meaning to, I know!  It began\r\nthat day at Lakelands; I fell in love with you the very first minute I\r\nset eyes on you!  There's a confession for a woman to make! and a married\r\nwoman!  I'm married, and I no more feel allegiance, as they call it, than\r\nif there never had been a ceremony and no Jacob Blathenoy was in\r\nexistence.  And why I should go to him!  But you shan't be troubled.\r\nI did not begin to live, as a woman, before I met you.  I can speak all\r\nthis to you because--we women can't be deceived in that--you are one of\r\nthe men who can be counted on for a friend.'\r\n\r\n'I hope so,' Dartrey said, and his mouth hardened as nature's electricity\r\nshot sparks into him from the touch and rocked him.\r\n\r\n'No, not yet: I will soon let it drop,' said she, and she was just then\r\nthrillingly pretty; she caressed the hand, placing it at her throat and\r\nmoving her chin on it, as women fondle birds.  'I am positively to go,\r\nthen?'\r\n\r\n'Positively, you are to go; and it's my command.'\r\n\r\n'Not in love with any one at all?'\r\n\r\n'Not with a soul.'\r\n\r\n'Not with a woman?'\r\n\r\n'With no woman.'\r\n\r\n'Nor maid?'\r\n\r\n'No! and no to everything.  And an end to the catechism!'\r\n\r\n'It is really a flint that beats here?' she said, and with a shyness in\r\nadventurousness, she struck the point of her forefinger on the rib.\r\n'Fancy me in love with a flint!  And running to be dutiful to a Jacob\r\nBlathenoy, at my flint's command.  I'm half in love with doing what I\r\nhate, because this cold thing here bids me do it.  I believe I married\r\nfor money, and now it looks as if I were to have my bargain with poverty\r\nto bless it.'\r\n\r\n'There I may help,' said Dartrey, relieved at sight of a loophole, to\r\nspring to some initiative out of the paralysis cast on him by a pretty\r\nlittle woman's rending of her veil.  A man of honour alone with a woman\r\nwho has tossed concealment to the winds, is a riddled target indeed: he\r\nis tempted to the peril of cajoleing, that he may escape from the torment\r\nand the ridicule; he is tempted to sigh for the gallant spirit of his\r\nnaughty adolescence.  'Come to me--will you?--apply to me, if there's\r\never any need.  I happen to have money.  And forgive me for naming it.'\r\n\r\nShe groaned: 'Don't!  I'm, sure, and I thought it from the first, you're\r\none of the good men, and the woman who meets you is lucky, and wretched,\r\nand so she ought to be!  Only to you should I!  .  .  .  do believe that!\r\nI won't speak of what excuses I've got.  You've seen.'\r\n\r\n'Don't think of them: there'll be danger in it.\r\n\r\n'Shall you think of me in danger?'\r\n\r\n'Silly, silly!  Don't you see you have to do with a flint!  I've gone\r\nthrough fire.  And if I were in love with you, I should start you off to\r\nyour husband this blessed day.'\r\n\r\n'And you're not the slightest wee wee bit in love with me!'\r\n\r\n'Perfectly true; but I like you; and if we're to be hand in hand, in the\r\ntime to come, you must walk firm at present.'\r\n\r\n'I'm to go to-day?'\r\n\r\n'You are.'\r\n\r\n'Without again.'\r\n\r\nThe riddled target kicked.  Dartrey contrasted Jacob Blathenoy with the\r\nfair wife, and commiseratingly exonerated her; he lashed at himself for\r\ncontinuing to be in this absurdest of postures, and not absolutely secure\r\nfor all that.  His head shook.  'Friends, you'll find best.'\r\n\r\n'Well!' she sighed, 'I feel I'm doomed to go famished through life.\r\nThere's never to be such a thing as, love, for me!  I can't tell you no\r\nwoman could: though you'll say I've told enough.  I shall burn with shame\r\nwhen I think of it.  I could go on my knees to have your arms round me\r\nonce.  I could kill myself for saying it!--I should feel that I had one\r\nmoment of real life.--I know I ought to admire you.  They say a woman\r\nhates if she's refused.  I can't: I wish I were able to.  I could have\r\nhelped the Radnors better by staying here and threatening never to go to\r\nhim unless he swore not to do them injury.  He's revengeful.  Just as you\r\nlike.  You say \"Go,\" and I go.  There.  I may kiss your hand?'\r\n\r\n'Give me yours.'\r\n\r\nDartrey kissed the hand.  She kissed the mark of his lips.  He got\r\nhimself away, by promising to see her to the train for Paris.  Outside\r\nher door, he was met by the reflection, coming as a thing external, that\r\nhe might veraciously and successfully have pleaded a passionate hunger\r\nfor breakfast: nay, that he would have done so, if he had been downright\r\nin earnest.  For she had the prettiness to cast a spell; a certain curve\r\nat the lips, a fluttering droop of the eyelids, a corner of the eye, that\r\nled long distances away to forests and nests.  This little woman had the\r\nrosy-peeping June bud's plumpness.  What of the man who refused to kiss\r\nher once?  Cold antecedent immersion had to be thanked; and stringent\r\nvacuity; perhaps a spotting ogre-image of her possessor.  Some sense of\r\nright-doing also, we hope.  Dartrey angrily attributed his good conduct\r\nto the lowest motives.  He went so far as to accuse himself of having\r\nforborne to speak of breakfast, from a sort of fascinated respect for the\r\npitch of a situation that he despised and detested.  Then again, when\r\nbeginning to eat, his good conduct drew on him a chorus of the jeers of\r\nall the martial comrades he had known.  But he owned he would have had\r\nless excuse than they, had he taken advantage of a woman's inability,\r\nat a weak moment, to protect herself: or rather, if he had not behaved\r\nin a manner to protect her from herself.  He thought of his buried wife,\r\nand the noble in the base of that poor soul; needing constantly a present\r\nhelper, for the nobler to conquer.  Be true man with a woman, she must be\r\nviler than the devil has yet made one, if she does not follow a strong\r\nright lead:--but be patient, of course.  And the word patience here means\r\nmore than most men contain.  Certainly a man like Jacob Blathenoy was a\r\nmouthful for any woman: and he had bought his wife, he deserved no pity.\r\nNot?  Probably not.  That view, however, is unwholesome and opens on\r\nslides.  Pity of his wife, too, gets to be fervidly active with her\r\nportrait, fetches her breath about us.  As for condemnation of the poor\r\nlittle woman, her case was not unexampled, though the sudden flare of it\r\nstartled rather.  Mrs. Victor could read men and women closely.  Yes, and\r\nVictor, when he schemed--but Dartrey declined to be throwing blame right\r\nor left.  More than by his breakfast, and in a preferable direction, he\r\nwas refreshed by Skepsey's narrative of the deeds of Matilda Pridden.\r\n\r\n'The right sort of girl for you to know, Skepsey,' he said.  'The best in\r\nlife is a good woman.'\r\n\r\nSkepsey exhibited his book of the Gallic howl.\r\n\r\n'They have their fits now and then, and they're soon over and forgotten,'\r\nDartrey said.  'The worst of it is, that we remember.'\r\n\r\nAfter the morning's visit to his uncle, he peered at half a dozen sticks\r\nin the corner of the room, grasped their handles, and selected the\r\nDemerara supple-jack, for no particular reason; the curved knot was easy\r\nto the grasp.  It was in his mind, that this person signing herself\r\nJudith Marsett, might have something to say, which intimately concerned\r\nNesta.  He fell to brooding on it, until he wondered why he had not been\r\nmade a trifle anxious by the reading of the note overnight.  Skepsey was\r\nleft at Nesta's house.\r\n\r\nDartrey found himself expected by the servant waiting on Mrs. Marsett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nSHOWS HOW TEMPER MAY KINDLE TEMPER AND AN INDIGNANT WOMAN GET HER WEAPON\r\n\r\nJudith Marsett stood in her room to receive Nesta's hero.  She was\r\nflushed, and had thinned her lips for utterance of a desperate thing,\r\nafter the first severe formalities.\r\n\r\nHer aim was to preserve an impressive decorum.  She was at the same time\r\nburning to speak out furious wrath, in words of savage rawness, if they\r\nshould come, as a manner of slapping the world's cheek for the state to\r\nwhich it reduces its women; whom one of the superior creatures can\r\ninsult, and laugh.\r\n\r\nMen complaining of the 'peace which is near their extinction,' have but\r\nto shuffle with the sex; they will experience as remarkable a change as\r\nif they had passed off land on to sea.\r\n\r\nDartrey had some flitting notion of the untamed original elements women\r\ncan bring about us, in his short observant bow to Mrs. Marsett, following\r\nso closely upon the scene with Mrs. Blathenoy.\r\n\r\nBut this handsome woman's look of the dull red line of a sombre fire,\r\nthat needed only stir of a breath to shoot the blaze, did not at all\r\nalarm him.  He felt refreshingly strung by it.\r\n\r\nShe was discerned at a glance to be an aristocratic member of regions\r\nwhere the senses perpetually simmer when they are not boiling.  The talk\r\nat the Club recurred to him.  How could Nesta have come to know the\r\nwoman?  His questioning of the chapter of marvellous accidents, touched\r\nNesta simply, as a young girl to be protected, without abhorrently\r\ninvolving the woman.  He had his ideas of the Spirit of Woman stating her\r\ncase to the One Judge, for lack of an earthly just one: a story different\r\nfrom that which is proclaimed pestilential by the body of censors under\r\nconservatory glass; where flesh is delicately nurtured, highly prized;\r\nspirit not so much so; and where the pretty tricking of the flesh is\r\ntaken for a spiritual ascendancy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of her turbulent breast's burden to deliver, Mrs. Marsett's\r\nfeminine acuteness was alive upon Dartrey, confirming here and there\r\nNesta's praises of him.  She liked his build and easy carriage of a\r\nmuscular frame: her Ned was a heavy man.  More than Dartrey's figure,\r\nas she would have said, though the estimate came second, she liked his\r\nmanner with her.  Not a doubt was there, that he read her position.  She\r\ncould impose upon some: not upon masculine eyes like these.  They did not\r\nscrutinize, nor ruffle a smooth surface with a snap at petty impressions;\r\nand they were not cynically intimate or dominating or tentatively\r\namorous: clear good fellowship was in them.  And it was a blessedness\r\n(whatever might be her feeling later, when she came to thank him at\r\nheart) to be in the presence of a man whose appearance breathed of\r\noffering her common ground, whereon to meet and speak together,\r\nunburdened by the hunting world, and by the stoneing world.  Such common\r\nground seems a kind of celestial to the better order of those excluded\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nDartrey relieved her midway in a rigid practice of the formalities: 'I\r\nthink I may guess that you have something to tell me relating to Miss\r\nRadnor?'\r\n\r\n'It is.'  Mrs. Marsett gathered up for an immediate plunge, and deferred\r\nit.  'I met her--we went out with the riding-master.  She took to me.\r\nI like her--I could say' (the woman's voice dropped dead low, in a\r\ntremble), 'I love her.  She is young: I could kneel to her.  Do you know\r\na Major Worrell?'\r\n\r\n'Worrell?  no.'\r\n\r\n'He is a-calls himself a friend of my--of Captain Marsett's.  He met us\r\nout one day.'\r\n\r\n'He permitted himself to speak to Miss Radnor?'\r\n\r\nShe rejoiced in Dartrey's look.  'Not then.  First let me tell you.  I\r\ncan hardly tell you.  But Miss Radnor tells me you are not like other\r\nmen.  You have made your conclusions already.  Are you asking what right\r\nI had to be knowing her?  It is her goodness.  Accident began it; I did\r\nnot deceive her; as soon as ever I could I--I have Captain Marsett's\r\npromise to me: at present he's situated, he--but I opened my heart to\r\nher: as much as a woman can.  It came!  Did I do very wrong?'\r\n\r\n'I'm not here to decide: continue, pray.'\r\n\r\nMrs. Marsett aimed at formal speech, and was driving upon her natural in\r\nanger.  'I swear I did it for the best. She is an innocent girl .  .  .\r\nyoung lady: only she has a head; she soon reads things.  I saw the kind\r\nof cloud in her.  I spoke.  I felt bound to: she said she would not\r\nforsake me.--I was bound to!  And it was enough to break my heart, to\r\nthink of her despising me.  No, she forgave, pitied;--she was kind.\r\nThose are the angels who cause us to think of changeing.  I don't care\r\nfor sermons, but when I meet charity: I won't bore you!'\r\n\r\n'You don't.'\r\n\r\n'My .  .  .  Captain Marsett can't bear--he calls it Psalmody.  He thinks\r\nthings ought always to be as they are, with women and men; and women\r\npreachers he does detest.  She is not one to preach.  You are waiting to\r\nhear what I have to tell.  That man Major Worrell has tried to rob me of\r\neverything I ever had to set a value on:--love, I 'd say;--he laughs at a\r\nwoman like me loving.'\r\n\r\nDartrey nodded, to signify a known sort of fellow.\r\n\r\n'She came here.'  Mrs. Marsett's tears had risen.  'I ought not to have\r\nlet her come.  I invited her--for once: I am lonely.  None of my sex--\r\nnone I could respect!  I meant it for only once.  She promised to sing to\r\nme.  And, Oh!  how she sings!  You have heard her.  My whole heart came\r\nout.  I declare I believe girls exist who can hear our way of life--and\r\nI'm not so bad except compared with that angel, who heard me, and was\r\nand is, I could take oath, no worse for it.  Some girls can; she is one.\r\nI am all for bringing them up in complete innocence.  If I was a great\r\nlady, my daughters should never know anything of the world until they\r\nwere married.  But Miss Radnor is a young lady who cannot be hurt.  She\r\nis above us.  Oh!  what a treasure for a man!--and my God! for any man\r\nborn of woman to insult a saint, as she is!--He is a beast!'\r\n\r\n'Major Worrell met her here?'\r\n\r\n'Blame me as much as you like: I do myself.  Half my rage with him is at\r\nmyself for putting her in the way of such a beast to annoy.  Each time\r\nshe came, I said it was to be the last.  I let her see what a mercy from\r\nheaven she was to me.  She would come.  It has not been many times.  She\r\nwishes me either to .  .  .  Captain Marsett has promised.  And nothing\r\nseems hard--to me when my own God's angel is by.  She is!  I'm not such a\r\nbad woman, but I never before I knew her knew the meaning of the word\r\nvirtue.  There is the young lady that man worried with his insulting\r\nremarks! though he must have known she was a lady:--because he found her\r\nin my rooms.'\r\n\r\n'You were present when, as you say, he insulted her?'\r\n\r\n'I was.  Here it commenced; and he would see her downstairs.'\r\n\r\n'You heard?'\r\n\r\n'Of course, I never left her.'\r\n\r\n'Give me a notion  .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'To get her to make an appointment: to let him conduct her home.'\r\n\r\n'She was alone?'\r\n\r\n'Her maid was below.'\r\n\r\n'And this happened .  .  .?'\r\n\r\n'Yesterday, after dark.  My Ned--Captain Marsett encourages him to be\r\nfamiliar.  I should be the lowest of women if I feared the threats of\r\nsuch a reptile of a man.  I could tell you more.  I can't always refuse\r\nhis visits, though if Ned knew the cur he is!  Captain Marsett is easy-\r\ngoing.'\r\n\r\n'I should like to know where he lives.'\r\n\r\nShe went straight to the mantelpiece, and faced about with a card,\r\nhanding it, quite aware that it was a charge of powder.\r\n\r\nDesperate things to be done excused the desperate said; and especially\r\nthey seemed a cover to the bald and often spotty language leaping out of\r\nher, against her better taste, when her temper was up.\r\n\r\n'Somewhere not very distant,' said Dartrey perusing.  'Is he in the town\r\nto-day, do you know?'\r\n\r\n'I am not sure; he may be.  Her name .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'Have no fear.  Ladies' names are safe.'\r\n\r\n'I am anxious that she may not be insulted again.'\r\n\r\n'Did she show herself conscious of it?'\r\n\r\n'She stopped speaking: she looked at the door.  She may come again--or\r\nnever! through that man!'\r\n\r\n'You receive him, at his pleasure?'\r\n\r\n'Captain Marsett wishes me to.  He is on his way home.  He calls Major\r\nWorrell my pet spite.  All I want is; not to hear of the man.  I swear\r\nhe came yesterday on the chance of seeing--for he forced his way up past\r\nmy servant; he must have seen Miss Radnor's maid below.'\r\n\r\n'You don't mean, that he insulted her hearing?'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  Captain Fenellan, you know the style.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I thank you,' Dartrey said.  'The young lady is the daughter of my\r\ndearest friends.  She's one of the precious--you're quite right.  Keep\r\nthe tears back.'\r\n\r\n'I will.'  She heaved open-mouthed to get physical control of the tide.\r\n'When you say that of her!--how can I help it?  It's I fear, because I\r\nfear .  .  .  and I've no right to expect ever .  .  .  but if I'm never\r\nagain to look on that dear face, tell her I shall--I shall pray for her\r\nin my grave.  Tell her she has done all a woman can, an angel can, to\r\nsave my soul.  I speak truth: my very soul!  I could never go to the\r\nutter bad after knowing her.  I don't--you know the world--I'm a poor\r\nhelpless woman!--don't swear to give up my Ned if he does break the word\r\nhe promised once; I can't see how I could.  I haven't her courage.\r\nI haven't--what it is!  You know her: it's in her eyes and her voice.\r\nIf I had her beside me, then I could starve or go to execution--I could,\r\nI am certain.  Here I am, going to do what you men hate.  Let me sit.'\r\n\r\n'Here's a chair,' said Dartrey.  'I've no time to spare; good day, for\r\nthe present.  You will permit me to call.'\r\n\r\n'Oh!  come'; she cried, out of her sobs, for excuse.  They were genuine,\r\nor she would better have been able to second her efforts to catch a\r\ndistinct vision of his retreating figure.\r\n\r\nShe beheld him, when he was in the street, turn for the district where\r\nMajor Worrell had his lodgeings.  That set her mind moving, and her tears\r\nfell no longer.\r\n\r\nMajor Worrell was not at home.  Dartrey was informed that he might be at\r\nhis Club.\r\n\r\nAt the Club he heard of the major as having gone to London and being\r\nexpected down in the afternoon.  Colonel Sudley named the train:\r\nan early train; the major was engaged to dine at the Club.  Dartrey had\r\ninformation supplied to him concerning Major Worrell and Captain Marsett,\r\nalso Mrs. Marsett.  She had a history.  Worthy citizens read the\r\ndescription of history with interest when the halo of Royalty is round\r\nit.  They may, if their reading extends, perceive, that it has been the\r\nmain turbid stream in old Mammon's train since he threw his bait for\r\nflesh.  They might ask, too, whether it is likely to cease to flow while\r\nhe remains potent.  The lady's history was brief, and bore recital in a\r\nClub; came off quite honourably there.  Regarding Major Worrell, the tale\r\nof him showed him to have a pass among men.  He managed cleverly to get\r\nhis pleasures out of a small income and a 'fund of anecdote.'  His\r\nreputation indicated an anecdotist of the table, prevailing in the\r\nprimitive societies, where the art of conversing does not come by nature,\r\nand is exercised in monosyllabic undertones or grunts until the\r\nnarrator's well-masticated popular anecdote loosens a digestive laughter,\r\nand some talk ensues.  He was Marsett's friend, and he boasted of not\r\nletting Ned Marsett make a fool of himself.\r\n\r\nDartrey was not long in shaping the man's character: Worrell belonged\r\nto the male birds of upper air, who mangle what female prey they are\r\nforbidden to devour.  And he had Miss Radnor's name: he had spoken her\r\nname at the Club overnight.  He had roused a sensation, because of a man\r\nbeing present, Percy Southweare, who was related to a man as good as\r\nengaged to marry her.  The major never fell into a quarrel with sons of\r\nnobles, if he could help it, or there might have been a pretty one.\r\n\r\nSo Colonel Sudley said.\r\n\r\nDartrey spoke musing: 'I don't know how he may class me; I have an\r\naccount to square with him.'\r\n\r\n'It won't do in these days, my good friend.  Come and cool yourself; and\r\nwe'll lunch here.  I shan't leave you.'\r\n\r\n'By all means.  We'll lunch, and walk up to the station, and you will\r\npoint him out to me.'\r\n\r\nDartrey stated Major Worrell's offence.  The colonel was not astonished;\r\nbut evidently he thought less of Worrell's behaviour to Miss Radnor in\r\nMrs. Marsett's presence than of the mention of her name at the Club: and\r\nthat, he seemed to think, had a shade of excuse against the charge of\r\nmonstrous.  He blamed the young lady who could go twice to visit a Mrs.\r\nMarsett; partly exposed a suspicion of her.  Dartrey let him talk.  They\r\nstrolled along the parade, and were near the pier.\r\n\r\nSuddenly saying: 'There, beside our friend in clerical garb: here she\r\ncomes; judge if that is the girl for the foulest of curs to worry, no\r\nmatter where she's found.'  Dartrey directed the colonel's attention to\r\nNesta and Mr. Barmby turning off the pier and advancing.\r\n\r\nHe saluted.  She bowed.  There was no contraction of her eyelids; and her\r\nface was white.  The mortal life appeared to be deadened in her cold wide\r\nlook; as when the storm-wind banks a leaden remoteness, leaving blown\r\nspace of sky.\r\n\r\nThe colonel said: 'No, that's not the girl a gentleman would offend.'\r\n\r\n'What man!' cried Dartrey.  'If we had a Society for the trial of your\r\ngentleman!--but he has only to call himself gentleman to get grant of\r\nlicence: and your Society protects him.  It won't punish, and it won't\r\nlet you.  But you saw her: ask yourself--what man could offend that\r\ngirl!'\r\n\r\n'Still, my friend, she ought to keep clear of the Marsetts.'\r\n\r\n'When I meet him, I shall treat him as one out of the law.'\r\n\r\n'You lead on to an ultimate argument with the hangman.'\r\n\r\nWe 'll dare it, to waken the old country.  Old England will count none\r\nbut Worrells in time.  As for discreet, if you like!--the young lady\r\nmight have been more discreet.  She's a girl with a big heart.  If we\r\nwere all everlastingly discreet!'\r\n\r\nDartrey may have meant, that the consequence of a prolonged conformity\r\nwould be the generation of stenches to shock to purgeing tempests the\r\ntolerant heavens over such smooth stagnancy.  He had his ideas about\r\nmovement; about the good of women, and the health of his England.  The\r\nfeeling of the hopelessness of pleading Nesta's conduct, for the perfect\r\njustification of it to son or daughter of our impressing conventional\r\nworld--even to a friend, that friend a true man, a really chivalrous man\r\n--drove him back in a silence upon his natural brotherhood with souls\r\nthat dare do.  It was a wonder, to think of his finding this kinship in a\r\nwoman.  In a girl?--and the world holding that virgin spirit to be\r\nunclean or shadowed because its rays were shed on foul places?  He\r\nclasped the girl.  Her smitten clear face, the face of the second sigh\r\nafter torture, bent him in devotion to her image.\r\n\r\nThe clasping and the worshipping were independent of personal ardours:\r\nquaintly mixed with semi-paternal recollections of the little 'blue\r\nbutterfly' of the days at Craye.  Farm and Creckholt; and he had heard of\r\nDudley Sowerby's pretensions to; her hand.  Nesta's youthfulness cast\r\ndouble age on him from the child's past.  He pictured the child; pictured\r\nthe girl, with her look of solitariness of sight; as in the desolate wide\r\nworld, where her noble compassion for a woman had unexpectedly,\r\npainfully, almost by transubstantiation, rack-screwed her to woman's\r\nmind.  And above sorrowful, holy were those eyes.\r\n\r\nThey held sway over Dartrey, and lost it some steps on; his demon temper\r\nurgeing him to strike at Major Worrell, as the cause of her dismayed\r\nexpression.  He was not the happier for dropping to his nature; but we\r\nproceed more easily, all of us, when the strain which lifts us a foot or\r\ntwo off our native level is relaxed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nA PAIR OF WOOERS\r\n\r\nThat ashen look of the rise out of death from one of our mortal wounds,\r\nwas caused by deeper convulsions in Nesta's bosom than Dartrey could\r\nimagine.\r\n\r\nShe had gone for the walk with Mr. Barmby, reading the omen of his tones\r\nin the request.  Dorothea and Virginia would have her go.  The clerical\r\ngentleman, a friend of the Rev. Abram Posterley; and one who deplored\r\npoor Mr. Posterley's infatuation; and one besides who belonged to Nesta's\r\nmusical choir in London: seemed a safe companion for the child.\r\nThe grand organ of Mr. Barmby's voice, too, assured them of a devout\r\nseriousness in him, that arrested any scrupulous little questions.  They\r\ncould not conceive his uttering the nonsensical empty stuff, compliments\r\nto their beauty and what not, which girls hear sometimes from\r\ninconsiderate gentlemen, to the having of their heads turned.  Moreover,\r\nNesta had rashly promised her father's faithful servant Skepsey to walk,\r\nout with him in the afternoon; and the ladies hoped she would find the\r\nmorning's walk to have been enough; good little man though Skepsey was,\r\nthey were sure.  But there is the incongruous for young women of station\r\non a promenade.\r\n\r\nMr. Barmby headed to the pier.  After pacing up and down between the\r\nbriny gulls and a polka-band, he made his way forethoughtfully to the\r\nglass-sheltered seats fronting East: where, as his enthusiasm for the\r\nsolemnity of the occasion excited him to say, 'We have a view of the\r\nterraces and the cliffs'; and where not more than two enwrapped\r\ninvalid figures were ensconsed.  Then it was, that Nesta recalled her\r\nanticipation of his possible design; forgotten by her during their talk\r\nof her dear people: Priscilla Graves and Mr. Pempton, and the Yatts, and\r\nSimeon Fenellan, Peridon and Catkin, and Skepsey likewise; and the very\r\nlatest news of her mother.  She wished she could have run before him, to\r\nspare him.  He would not notice a sign.  Girls must wait and hear.\r\n\r\nIt was an oratorio.  She watched the long wave roll on to the sinking\r\ninto its fellow; and onward again for the swell and the weariful lapse;\r\nand up at last bursting to the sheet of white.  The far-heard roar and\r\nthe near commingled, giving Mr. Barmby a semblance to the powers of\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nAt the first direct note, the burden of which necessitated a pause, she\r\npetitioned him to be her friend, to think of himself as her friend.\r\n\r\nBut a vessel laden with merchandize, that has crossed wild seas for this\r\nparticular port, is hardly to be debarred from discharging its goods on\r\nthe quay by simple intimations of their not being wanted.  We are\r\nprecipitated both by the aim and the tedium of the lengthened voyage to\r\ninsist that they be seen.  We believe perforce in their temptingness;\r\nand should allurement fail, we fall back to the belief in our eloquence.\r\nAn eloquence to expose the qualities they possess, is the testification\r\nin the promise of their excellence.  She is to be induced by feeling to\r\nsee it.  We are asking a young lady for the precious gift of her hand.\r\nWe respect her; and because of our continued respect, despite an\r\nobstruction, we have come to think we have a claim upon her gratitude;\r\ncould she but be led to understand how different we are from some other\r\nman!--from one hitherto favoured among them, unworthy of this prize,\r\nhowever personally exalted and meritorious.\r\n\r\nThe wave of wide extension rolled and sank and rose, heaving lifeless\r\nvariations of the sickly streaks on its dull green back.\r\n\r\nDudley Sowerby's defection was hinted at and accounted for, by the\r\nworldly test of worldly considerations.\r\n\r\nWhat were they?--Nesta glanced.\r\n\r\nAn indistinct comparison was modestly presented, of one unmoved by\r\nworldly considerations.\r\n\r\nBut what were they?  She was wakened by a lamp, and her darkness was all\r\ninflammable to it.\r\n\r\n'Oh!  Mr. Barmby, you have done me the honour to speak before; you know\r\nmy answer,' she said.\r\n\r\n'You were then subject to an influence.  A false, I may say wicked,\r\nsentiment upholding celibacy.'\r\n\r\n'My poor Louise?  She never thought of influencing me.  She has her\r\nviews, I mine.  Our friendship does not depend on a \"treaty of\r\nreciprocity.\"  We are one at heart, each free to judge and act, as it\r\nshould be in friendship.  I heard from her this morning.  Her brother\r\nwill be able to resume his military duties next month.  Then she will\r\nreturn to me.'\r\n\r\n'We propose!' rejoined Mr. Barmby.\r\n\r\nBeholding the involuntary mercurial rogue-dimple he had started from a\r\ntwitch at the corner, of her lips, the good gentleman pursued: 'Can we\r\ndare write our designs for the month to come?  Ah!--I will say--Nesta!\r\ngive me the hope I beg to have.  See the seriousness.  You are at\r\nliberty.  That other has withdrawn his pretensions.  We will not blame\r\nhim.  He is in expectation of exalted rank.  Where there is any shadow\r\n.  .  .  !'  Mr. Barmby paused on his outroll of the word; but\r\nimmediately, not intending to weigh down his gentle hearer with the\r\nsignificance in it, resumed at a yet more sonorous depth: 'He is under\r\nthe obligation to his family; an old, a venerable family.  In the full\r\nblaze of public opinion!  His conduct can be palliated by us, too.\r\nThere is a right and wrong in minor things, independent of the higher\r\nrectitude.  We pardon, we can partly support, the worldly view.'\r\n\r\n'There is a shadow?' said Nesta; and her voice was lurefully encouraging.\r\n\r\nHe was on the footing where men are precipitated by what is within them\r\nto blunder.  'On you--no.  On you personally, not at all.  No.  It could\r\nnot be deemed so.  Not by those knowing, esteeming--not by him who loves\r\nyou, and would, with his name, would, with his whole strength, envelop,\r\nshield .  .  .  certainly, certainly not.'\r\n\r\n'It is on my parents?' she said.\r\n\r\n'But to me nothing, nothing, quite nought!  To confound the innocent with\r\nthe guilty!  .  .  .  and excuses may exist.  We know but how little we\r\nknow!'\r\n\r\n'It is on both my parents?' she said; with a simplicity that induced him\r\nto reply: 'Before the world.  But not, I repeat .  .  .'\r\n\r\nThe band-instruments behind the sheltering glass flourished on their\r\ntermination of a waltz.\r\n\r\nShe had not heeded their playing.  Now she said:\r\n\r\n'The music is over; we must not be late at lunch'; and she stood up and\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his legs and obediently stepped out:\r\n\r\n'I shall have your answer to-day, this evening?  Nesta!'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Barmby, it will be the same.  You will be kind to me in not asking\r\nme again.'\r\n\r\nHe spoke further.  She was dumb.\r\n\r\nHad he done ill or well for himself and for her when he named the shadow\r\non her parents?  He dwelt more on her than on himself: he would not have\r\nwounded her to win the blest affirmative.  Could she have been entirely\r\nignorant?--and after Dudley Sowerby's defection?  For such it was: the\r\nRev. Stuart Rem had declared the union between the almost designated head\r\nof the Cantor family and a young person of no name, of worse than no\r\nbirth, impossible: 'absolutely and totally impossible,' he, had said, in\r\nhis impressive fashion, speaking from his knowledge of the family, and an\r\nacquaintance with Dudley.  She must necessarily have learnt why Dudley\r\nSowerby withdrew.  No parents of an attractive daughter should allow her\r\nto remain unaware of her actual position in the world.  It is criminal,\r\na reduplication of the criminality!  Yet she had not spoken as one\r\nastonished.  She was mysterious.  Women are so: young women most of all.\r\nIt is undecided still whether they do of themselves conceive principles,\r\nor should submit to an imposition of the same upon them in terrorem.\r\nMysterious truly, but most attractive!  As Lady Bountiful of a district,\r\nshe would have in her maturity the majestic stature to suit a\r\ndispensation of earthly good things.  And, strangely, here she was, at\r\nthis moment, rivalling to excelling all others of her sex (he verified it\r\nin the crowd of female faces passing), when they, if they but knew the\r\nfacts, would visit her very appearance beside them on a common footing as\r\nan intrusion and a scandal.  To us who know, such matters are indeed\r\nwonderful!\r\n\r\nMoved by reflective compassion, Mr. Barmby resumed the wooer's note, some\r\nfew steps after he had responded to the salutation of Dartrey Fenellan\r\nand Colonel Sudley.  She did not speak.  She turned her forehead to him;\r\nand the absence of the world from her eyes chilled his tongue.\r\n\r\nHe declined the pleasure of the lunch with the Duvidney ladies.  He\r\ndesired to be alone, to question himself fasting, to sound the deed he\r\nhad done; for he had struck on a suspicion of selfishness in it: and\r\nthough Love must needs be an egoism, Love is no warrant for the doing of\r\na hurt to the creature beloved.  Thoughts upon Skepsey and the tale of\r\nhis Matilda Pridden's labours in poor neighbourhoods, to which he had\r\nbeen inattentive during the journey down to the sea, invaded him; they\r\nwere persistent.  He was a worthy man, having within him the spiritual\r\nimpulse curiously ready to take the place where a material disappointment\r\nleft vacancy.  The vulgar sort embrace the devil at that stage.  Before\r\nthe day had sunk, Mr. Barmby's lowest wish was, to be a light, as the\r\ninstrument of his Church in her ministrations amid the haunts of sin and\r\nslime, to such plain souls as Daniel Skepsey and Matilda Pridden.  And he\r\ncould still be that, if Nesta, in the chapters of the future, changed her\r\nmind.  She might; for her good she would; he reserved the hope.  His\r\nlight was one to burn beneath an extinguisher.\r\n\r\nAt the luncheon table of the Duvidney ladies, it was a pain to Dorothea\r\nand Virginia to witness how poor the appetite their Nesta brought in from\r\nthe briny blowy walk.  They prophesied against her chances of a good\r\nsleep at night, if she did not eat heartily.  Virginia timidly remarked\r\non her paleness.  Both of them put their simple arts in motion to let her\r\nknow, that she was dear to them: so dear as to make them dread the hour\r\nof parting.  They named their dread of it.  They had consulted in private\r\nand owned to one another, that they did really love the child, and dared\r\nnot look forward to what they would do without her.  The dear child's\r\npaleness and want of appetite (they remembered they were observing a weak\r\ninnocent girl) suggested to them mutually the idea of a young female\r\nheart sickening, for the old unhappy maiden reason.  But, if only she\r\nmight return with them to the Wells, the Rev. Stuart Rem would assure her\r\nto convince her of her not being quite, quite forsaken.  He, or some one\r\nhaving sanction from Victor, might ultimately (the ladies waiting\r\nanxiously in the next room, to fold her on the warmth of their bosoms\r\nwhen she had heard) impart to her the knowledge of circumstances, which\r\nwould, under their further tuition concerning the particular sentiments\r\nof great families and the strict duties of the scions of the race, help\r\nto account for and excuse the Hon. Dudley Sowerby's behaviour.\r\n\r\nThey went up to the drawing-room, talking of Skepsey and his tale of\r\nMiss Pridden, for Nesta's amusement.  Any talk of her Skepsey usually\r\nquickened her lips to reminiscent smiles and speech.  Now she held on\r\nto gazeing; and sadly, it seemed; as if some object were not present.\r\n\r\nFor a vague encouragement, Dorothea said: 'One week, and we are back home\r\nat Moorsedge!'--not so far from Cronidge, was implied, for the\r\nadministering of some foolish temporary comfort.  And it was as when a\r\nfish on land springs its hollow sides in alien air for the sustaining\r\nelement; the girl panted; she clasped Dorothea's hand and looked at\r\nVirginia: 'My mother--I must see her!' she said.  They were slightly\r\nstupefied by the unwonted mention of her mother.  They made no reply.\r\nThey never had done so when there was allusion to her mother.  Their\r\nsilence now struck a gong at the girl's bosom.\r\n\r\nDorothea had it in mind to say, that if she thirsted for any special\r\ncomfort, the friends about her would offer consolation for confidence.\r\n\r\nBefore she could speak, Perrin the footman entered, bearing the card of\r\nthe Hon. Dudley Sowerby.\r\n\r\nMr. Dudley Sowerby begged for an immediate interview with Miss Radnor.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were somewhat agitated, but no longer perplexed as to their\r\nduties.  They had quitted Moorsedge to avoid the visit of his family.\r\nIf he followed, it signified that which they could not withstand:--The\r\n'Tivoli falls!' as they named the fateful tremendous human passion, from\r\nthe reminiscences of an impressive day on their travels in youth; when\r\nthe leaping torrent had struck upon a tale of love they were reading.\r\nThey hurriedly entreated Nesta to command her nerves; peremptorily\r\nrequested her to stay where she was; showed her spontaneously, by way of\r\nhistrionic adjuration, the face to be worn by young ladies at greetings\r\non these occasions; kissed her and left her; Virginia whispering: 'He is\r\ntrue!'\r\n\r\nDudley entered the drawing-room, charged with his happy burden of a love\r\nthat had passed through the furnace.  She stood near a window, well in\r\nthe light; she hardly gave him welcome.  His address to her was hurried,\r\nrather uncertain, coherent enough between the drop and the catch of\r\narticulate syllables.  He found himself holding his hat.  He placed it on\r\nthe table, and it rolled foolishly; but soon he was by her side, having\r\ntwo free hands to claim her one.\r\n\r\n'You are thinking, you have not heard from me!  I have been much\r\noccupied,' he said.  'My brother is ill, very ill.  I have your pardon?'\r\n\r\n'Indeed you have--if it has to be asked.'\r\n\r\n'I have it?'\r\n\r\n'Have I to grant it?'\r\n\r\n'I own to remissness!\r\n\r\n'I did not blame you.'\r\n\r\n'Nesta .  .  .  !'\r\n\r\nHer coldness was unshaken.\r\n\r\nHe repeated the call of her name.  'I should have written--I ought to\r\nhave written!--I could not have expressed .  .  .  You do forgive?  So\r\nmany things!'\r\n\r\n'You come from Cronidge to-day?'\r\n\r\n'From my family--to you.'\r\n\r\nShe seemed resentful.  His omissions as a correspondent were explicable\r\nin a sentence.  It had to be deferred.\r\n\r\nReviewing for a moment the enormous internal conflict undergone by him\r\nduring the period of the silence between them, he wondered at the\r\nvastness of the love which had conquered objections, to him so poignant.\r\n\r\nThere was at least no seeing of the public blot on her birth when looking\r\non her face.  Nor when thinking of the beauty of her character, in\r\nabsence or in presence, was there any.  He had mastered distaste to such\r\na degree, that he forgot the assistance he had received from the heiress\r\nfor enabling him to appreciate the fair young girl.  Money is the\r\nimperious requirement of superior station; and more money and more: in\r\nthese our modern days of the merchant's wealth, and the miner's, and the\r\ngigantic American and Australian millionaires, high rank is of necessity\r\nvowed, in peril of utter eclipse; to the possession of money.  Still it\r\nis, when assured, a consideration far to the rear with a gentleman in\r\nwhose bosom love and the buzzing world have fought their battle out.  He\r\ncould believe it thoroughly fought out, by the prolonged endurance of a\r\ncontest lasting many days and nights; in the midst of which, at one time,\r\nthe task of writing to tell her of his withdrawal from the engagement,\r\nwas the cause of his omission to write.\r\n\r\nAs to her character, he dwelt on the charm of her recovered features, to\r\nrepress an indicative dread of some intrepid force behind it, that might\r\nbe unfeminine, however gentle the external lineaments.  Her features, her\r\npresent aristocratic deficiency of colour, greatly pleased him; her\r\ncharacter would submit to moulding.  Of all young ladies in the world,\r\nshe should be the one to shrink from a mental independence and hold to\r\nthe guidance of the man ennobling her.  Did she?  Her eyes were reading\r\nhim.  She had her father's limpid eyes, and when they concentrated rays,\r\nthey shot.\r\n\r\n'Have you seen my parents, Mr. Sowerby?'\r\n\r\nHe answered smilingly, for reassuringly: 'I have seen them.'\r\n\r\n'My mother?'\r\n\r\n'From your mother first.  But am I not to be Dudley?'\r\n\r\n'She spoke to you?  She told you?'\r\n\r\n'And yesterday your father--a second time.'\r\n\r\nSome remainder of suspicion in the dealing with members of this family,\r\nurged Dudley to say: 'I understood from them, you were not? .  .  . that\r\nyou were quite .  .  .?'\r\n\r\n'I have heard: I have guessed: it was recently--this morning, as it\r\nhappened.  I wish to go to my mother to-day.  I shall go to her\r\nto-morrow.'\r\n\r\n'I might offer to conduct you-now!'\r\n\r\n'You are kind; I have Skepsey.'  She relieved the situation of its\r\ncold-toned strain in adding: 'He is a host.'\r\n\r\n'But I may come?--now!  Have I not the right?  You do not deny it me?'\r\n\r\n'You are very generous.'\r\n\r\n'I claim the right, then.  Always.  And subsequently, soon after, my\r\nmother hopes to welcome you at Cronidge.  She will be glad to hear of\r\nyour naming of a day.  My father bids me .  .  .  he and all our family.'\r\n\r\n'They are very generous.'\r\n\r\n'I may send them word this evening of a day you name?'\r\n\r\n'No, Mr. Sowerby.\r\n\r\n'Dudley?'\r\n\r\n'I cannot say it.  I have to see my parents.'\r\n\r\n'Between us, surely?'\r\n\r\n'My whole heart thanks you for your goodness to me.  I am unable to say\r\nmore.'\r\n\r\nHe had again observed and he slightly crisped under the speculative look\r\nshe directed on him: a simple unstrained look, that had an air of reading\r\nright in, and was worse to bear with than when the spark leaped upon some\r\nthought from her eyes: though he had no imagination of anything he\r\nconcealed--or exposed, and he would have set it down to her temporary\r\nincredulousness of his perfect generosity or power to overcome the\r\nworld's opinion of certain circumstances.  That had been a struggle!\r\nThe peculiar look was not renewed.  She spoke warmly of her gratitude.\r\nShe stated, that she must of necessity see her parents at once.  She\r\nsubmitted to his entreaty to conduct her to them on the morrow.  It was\r\nin the manner of one who yielded step by step, from inability to contend.\r\n\r\nHer attitude continuing unchanged, he became sensible of a monotony\r\nin the speech with which he assailed it, and he rose to leave, not\r\ndissatisfied.  She, at his urgent request, named her train for London in\r\nthe early morning.  He said it was not too early.  He would have desired\r\nto be warmed; yet he liked her the better for the moral sentiment\r\ncontrolling the physical.  He had appointments with relatives or\r\nconnections in the town, and on that pretext he departed, hoping for the\r\nspeedy dawn of the morrow as soon as he had turned his back on the house.\r\n\r\nNo, not he the man to have pity of women underfoot!  That was the\r\nthought, unrevolved, unphrased, all but unconscious, in Nesta: and while\r\nher heart was exalting him for his generosity.  Under her present sense\r\nof the chilling shadow, she felt the comfort there was in being grateful\r\nto him for the golden beams which his generosity cast about her.  But she\r\nhad an intelligence sharp to pierce, virgin though she was; and with the\r\nmark in sight, however distant, she struck it, unerring as an Artemis for\r\nblood of beasts: those shrewd young wits, on the lookout to find a\r\nchampion, athirst for help upon a desolate road, were hard as any\r\njudicial to pronounce the sentence upon Dudley in that respect.  She\r\nraised him high; she placed herself low; she had a glimpse of the\r\nstruggle he had gone through; love of her had helped him, she believed.\r\nAnd she was melted; and not the less did the girl's implacable intuition\r\nread with the keenness of eye of a man of the world the blunt division\r\nin him, where warm humanity stopped short at the wall of social concrete\r\nforming a part of this rightly esteemed young citizen.  She, too, was\r\ndivided: she was at his feet; and she rebuked herself for daring to\r\njudge--or rather, it was, for having a reserve in her mind upon a man\r\nproving so generous with her.  She was pulled this way and that by\r\nsensibilities both inspiring to blind gratitude and quickening her\r\npenetrative view.  The certainty of an unerring perception remained.\r\n\r\nDorothea and Virginia were seated in the room below, waiting for their\r\ncarriage, when the hall-door spoke of the Hon. Dudley's departure; soon\r\nafter, Nesta entered to them.  She swam up to Dorothea's lap, and dropped\r\nher head on it, kneeling.\r\n\r\nThe ladies feared she might be weeping.  Dorothea patted her thick brown\r\ntwisted locks of hair.  Unhappiness following such an interview, struck\r\nthem as an ill sign.\r\n\r\nVirginia bent to the girl's ear, and murmured: 'All well?'\r\n\r\nShe replied: 'He has been very generous.'\r\n\r\nHer speaking of the words renewed an oppression, that had darkened her on\r\nthe descent of stairs.  For sensibilities sharp as Nesta's, are not to be\r\nhad without their penalties: and she who had gone nigh to summing in a\r\nflash the nature of Dudley, sank suddenly under that affliction often\r\nbesetting the young adventurous mind, crushing to young women:--the\r\nfascination exercised upon them by a positive adverse masculine attitude\r\nand opinion.  Young men know well what it is: and if young women have by\r\nchance overcome their timidity, to the taking of any step out of the trim\r\npathway, they shrink, with a sense of forlornest isolation.  It becomes a\r\nsubjugation; inciting to revolt, but a heavy weight to cast off.  Soon it\r\nassumed its material form for the contention between her and Dudley, in\r\nthe figure of Mrs. Marsett.  The Nesta who had been instructed to know\r\nherself to be under a shadow, heard, she almost justified Dudley's\r\nreproaches to her, for having made the acquaintance of the unhappy woman,\r\nfor having visited her, for having been, though but for a minute, at the\r\nmercy of a coarse gentleman's pursuit.  The recollection was a smart\r\nbuffet.\r\n\r\nHer lighted mind punished her thus through her conjuring of Dudley's\r\nwords, should news of her relations with Mrs. Marsett reach him:--and she\r\nwould have to tell him.  Would he not say: 'I have borne with the things\r\nconcerning your family.  All the greater reason why I must insist'--he\r\nwould assuredly say he insisted (her humour caught at the word, as being\r\nthe very word one could foresee and clearly see him uttering in a fit of\r\nvehemence) on her immediate abandonment of 'that woman.'\r\n\r\nAnd with Nesta's present enlightenment by dusky beams, upon her\r\nparentage, she listened abjectly to Dudley, or the opinion of the\r\nmajority.  Would he not say or think, that her clinging to Mrs. Marsett\r\nput them under a kind of common stamp, or gave the world its option to\r\nclass them together?\r\n\r\nThese were among the ideas chasing in a head destined to be a battle-\r\nfield for the enrichment of a harvest-field of them, while the girl's\r\nface was hidden on Dorothea's lap, and her breast heaved and heaved.\r\n\r\nShe distressed them when she rose, by saying she must instantly see her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThey saw the pain their hesitation inflicted, and Dorothea said: 'Yes,\r\ndear; any day you like.'\r\n\r\n'To-morrow--I must go to her to-morrow!'\r\n\r\nA suggestion of her mother's coming down, was faintly spoken by one lady,\r\nechoed in a quaver by the other.\r\n\r\nNesta shook her head.  To quiet the kind souls, she entreated them to\r\ngive their promise that they would invite her again.\r\n\r\nImagining the Hon. Dudley to have cast her off, both ladies embraced her:\r\nnot entirely yielding-up their hearts to her, by reason of the pernicious\r\nnew ideas now in the world to sap our foundations of morality; which\r\nwarned them of their duty to uphold mentally his quite justifiable\r\nbehaviour, even when compassionating the sufferings of the guiltless\r\ncreature loved by them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nCONTAINS DEEDS UNRELATED AND EXPOSITIONS OF FEELINGS\r\n\r\nAll through the afternoon and evening Skepsey showed indifference to\r\nmeals by continuing absent: and he was the one with whom Nesta would have\r\nfelt at home; more at home than with her parents.  He and the cool world\r\nhe moved in were a transparency of peace to her mind; even to his giving\r\nof some portion of it, when she had the dear little man present to her in\r\na vivid image of a fish in a glass globe, wandering round and round, now\r\nand then shooting across, just as her Skepsey did: he carried his head\r\nsemihorizontally at his arrowy pace; plain to read though he was, he\r\nappeared, under that image created of him, animated by motives inducing\r\nto speculation.\r\n\r\nShe thought of him till she could have reproached him for not returning\r\nand helping her to get away from the fever of other thoughts:--this\r\nanguish twisting about her parents, and the dreadful trammels of\r\ngratitude to a man afflictingly generous, the frown of congregated\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe latter was the least of evils; she had her charges to bring against\r\nthem for injustice: uncited, unstirred charges, they were effective as a\r\nmuffled force to sustain her: and the young who are of healthy lively\r\nblood and clean conscience have either emotion or imagination to fold\r\nthem defensively from an enemy world; whose power to drive them forth\r\ninto the wilderness they acknowledge.  But in the wilderness their souls\r\nare not beaten down by breath of mortals; they burn straight flame there\r\nup to the parent Spirit.\r\n\r\nShe could not fancy herself flying thither;--where to be shorn and naked\r\nand shivering is no hardship, for the solitude clothes, and the sole true\r\nlife in us resolves to that steady flame;--she was restrained by Dudley's\r\ngenerosity, which held her fast to have the forgiveness for her\r\nuncommitted sin dashed in her face.  He surprised her; the unexpected\r\nquality in him seemed suddenly to have snared her fast: and she did not\r\nobtain release after seeing behind it;--seeing it, by the light of what\r\nshe demanded, personal, shallow, a lover's generosity.  So her keen\r\nintellect saw it; and her young blood (for the youthful are thus divided)\r\nthrilled in thinking it must be love!  The name of the sacred passion\r\nlifted it out of the petty cabin of the individual into a quiring\r\ncathedral universal, and subdued her.  It subdued her with an unwelcome\r\ntouch of tenderness when she thought of it as involving tenderness for\r\nher mother, some chivalrous respect for her mother.  Could he love the\r\ndaughter without some little, which a more intimate knowledge of her dear\r\nmother would enlarge?  The girl's heart flew to her mother, clung to her,\r\nvindicated her dumbly.  It would not inquire, and it refused to hear,\r\nhungering the while.  She sent forth her flights of stories in\r\nelucidation of the hidden; and they were like white bird after bird\r\nwinging to covert beneath a thundercloud; until her breast ached for the\r\nvoice of the thunder: harsh facts: sure as she was of her never losing\r\nher filial hold of the beloved.  She and her mother grew together, they\r\nwere one.  Accepting the shadow, they were the closer one beneath it.\r\nShe had neither vision nor active thought of her father, in whom her\r\npride was.\r\n\r\nAt the hour of ten, the ladies retired for the enjoyment of their sweet\r\nreward.  Manton, their maid, came down to sit with Nesta on the watch for\r\nSkepsey.  Perrin, the footman, returning, as late as twenty minutes to\r\neleven, from his tobacco promenade along the terrace, reported to Manton\r\n'a row in town'; and he repeated to Nesta the policeman's opinion and his\r\nown of the 'Army' fellows, and the way to treat them.  Both were for\r\nrigour.\r\n\r\n'The name of \"Army\" attracts poor Skepsey so, I am sure he would join it,\r\nif they would admit him,' Nesta said.\r\n\r\n'He has an immense respect for a young woman, who belongs to his \"Army\";\r\nand one doesn't know what may have come,' said Manton.\r\n\r\nTwo or three minutes after eleven, a feeble ring at the bell gained\r\nadmission for some person: whispering was heard in the passage.\r\n\r\nManton played eavesdropper, and suddenly bursting on Skepsey, arrested\r\nhim when about to dash upstairs.  His young mistress's voice was a\r\nsufficient command; he yielded; he pitched a smart sigh and stepped\r\ninto her presence for his countenance to be seen, or the show of a\r\ncountenance, that it presented.\r\n\r\n'Skepsey wanted to rush to bed without saying good night to me?' said\r\nshe; leaving unnoticed, except for woefulness of tone, his hurried\r\nshuffle of remarks on 'his appearance,' and 'little accidents'; ending\r\nwith an inclination of his disgraceful person to the doorway, and a\r\npetition: 'If I might, Miss Nesta?'  The implied pathetic reference to a\r\nsurgically-treated nose under a cross of strips of plaster, could not\r\nobtain dismissal for him.  And he had one eye of sinister hue, showing\r\nbeside its lighted-grey fellow as if a sullen punished dragonwhelp had\r\ncouched near some quick wood-pigeon.  The two eyes blinked rapidly.  He\r\nwas a picture of Guilt in the nude, imploring to be sent into\r\nconcealment.\r\n\r\nThe cruelty of detaining him was evident.\r\n\r\n'Yes, if you must,' Nesta said.  'But, dear Skepsey, will it be the\r\nmagistrate again to-morrow?'\r\n\r\nHe feared it would be; he fancied it would needs be.  He concluded\r\nby stating, that he was bound to appear before the magistrate in the\r\nmorning; and he begged assistance to keep it from the knowledge of the\r\nMiss Duvidneys, who had been so kind to him.\r\n\r\n'Has there been bailing of you again, Skepsey?'\r\n\r\n'A good gentleman, a resident,' he replied; 'a military gentleman;\r\nindeed, a colonel of the cavalry; but, it may so be, retired; and anxious\r\nabout our vast possessions; though he thinks a translation of a French\r\nattack on England unimportant.  He says, the Germans despise us most.'\r\n\r\n'Then this gentleman thinks you have a good case?'\r\n\r\n'He is a friend of Captain Dartrey's.'\r\n\r\nHearing that name, Nesta said: 'Now, Skepsey, you must tell me\r\neverything.  You are not to mind your looks.  I believe, I do always\r\nbelieve you mean well.'\r\n\r\n'Miss Nesta, it depends upon the magistrate's not being prejudiced\r\nagainst the street-processionists!\r\n\r\n'But you may expect justice from the magistrate, if your case is good?'\r\n\r\n'I would not say no, Miss Nesta.  But we find, the opinion of the public\r\nhas its effect with magistrates--their sentences.  They are severe on\r\nboxing.  They have latterly treated the \"Army\" with more consideration,\r\nowing to the change in the public view.  I myself have changed.'\r\n\r\n'Have you joined it?'\r\n\r\n'I cannot say I am a member of it.'\r\n\r\n'You walked in the ranks to-day, and you were maltreated?  Your friend\r\nwas there?'\r\n\r\n'I walked with Matilda Pridden; that is, parallel, along the pavement.'\r\n\r\n'I hope she came out of it unhurt?'\r\n\r\n'It is thanks to Captain Dartrey, Miss Nesta?'\r\n\r\nThis time Nesta looked her question.\r\n\r\nManton interposed: 'You are to speak, Mr. Skepsey'; and she stopped a\r\nflood of narrative, that was knocking in his mind to feel its head and to\r\nleap--an uninterrupted half-minute more would have shaped the story for\r\nthe proper flow.\r\n\r\nHe began, after attending to the throb of his bruises in a manner to\r\ncorrect them rather than solace; and the beginning was the end: 'Captain\r\nDartrey rescued us, before Matilda Pridden suffered harm, to mention--the\r\nchin, slight, teeth unshaken; a beautiful set.  She is angry with Captain\r\nDartrey, for having recourse to violence in her defence: it is against\r\nher principles.  \"Then you die,\" she says; and our principles are to gain\r\nmore by death.  She says, we are alive in them; but worse if we abandon\r\nthem for the sake of living.--I am a little confused; she is very\r\nabstruse.--Because, that is the corruptible life, she says.  I have found\r\nit quite impossible to argue with her; she has always a complete answer;\r\nwonderful.  In case of Invasion, we are to lift our voices to the Lord;\r\nand the Lord's will shall be manifested.  If we are robbed, we ask, How\r\ncame we by the goods?  It is unreasonable; it strikes at rights of\r\nproperty.  But I have to go on thinking.  When in danger, she sings\r\nwithout excitement.  When the blow struck her, she stopped singing only\r\nan instant.  She says, no one fears, who has real faith.  She will not\r\nlet me call her brave.  She cannot admire Captain Dartrey.  Her\r\nprinciples are opposed.  She said to him, \"Sir, you did what seemed to\r\nyou right.\"  She thinks every blow struck sends us back to the state of\r\nthe beasts.  Her principles .  .  .'\r\n\r\n'How was it Captain Dartrey happened to be present, Skepsey?'\r\n\r\n'She is very firm.  You cannot move her.--Captain Dartrey was on his way\r\nto the station, to meet a gentleman from London, Miss Nesta.  He carried\r\na stick--a remarkable stick--he had shown to me in the morning, and he\r\nhas given it me now.  He says, he has done his last with it.  He seems to\r\nhave some of Matilda Pridden's ideas about fighting, when it's over.  He\r\nwas glad to be rid of the stick, he said.'\r\n\r\n'But who attacked you?  What were the people?'\r\n\r\n'Captain Dartrey says, England may hold up her head while she breeds\r\nyoung women like Matilda Pridden: right or wrong, he says: it is the\r\nsubstance.'\r\n\r\nHereupon Manton, sick of Miss Pridden, shook the little man with a\r\nsnappish word, to bring him to attention.  She got him together\r\nsufficiently for him to give a lame version of the story; flat until he\r\ncame to his heroine's behaviour, when he brightened a moment, and he sank\r\nback absorbed in her principles and theories of life.  It was understood\r\nby Nesta, that the processionists, going at a smart pace, found their way\r\nblocked and were assaulted in one of the sidestreets; and that Skepsey\r\nrushed to the defence of Matilda Pridden; and that, while they were\r\nengaged, Captain Dartrey was passing at the end of the street, and\r\nrecognized one he knew in the thick of it and getting the worst of it,\r\nowing to numbers.  'I will show you the stick he did it with, Miss\r\nNests'; said Skepsey, regardless of narrative; and darted out of the room\r\nto bring in the Demerara supple-jack; holding which, he became inspired\r\nto relate something of Captain Dartrey's deeds.\r\n\r\nThey gave no pleasure to his young lady, as he sadly perceived:--thus it\r\nis with the fair sex ever, so fond of heroes!  She shut her eyes from the\r\nsight of the Demerara supple-jack descending right and left upon the\r\nskulls of a couple of bully lads.  'That will do--you were rescued.  And\r\nnow go to bed, Skepsey; and be up at seven to breakfast with me,' Nesta\r\nsaid, for his battle-damaged face would be more endurable to behold after\r\nan interval, she hoped; and she might in the morning dissociate its evil\r\nlook from the deeds of Captain Dartrey.\r\n\r\nThe thought of her hero taking active part in a streetfray, was repulsive\r\nto her; it swamped his brilliancy.  And this distressed her, by\r\nwithdrawing the support which the thought of him had been to her since\r\nmid-day.  She lay for sleepless hours, while nursing a deeper pain, under\r\noppression of repugnance to battle-dealing, bloodshedding men.  It was\r\nlong before she grew mindful of the absurdity of the moan recurring\r\nwhenever reflection wearied.  Translated into speech, it would have run:\r\n\r\n'In a street of the town! with a stick!'--The vulgar picture pursued her\r\nto humiliation; it robbed her or dimmed her possession of the one bright\r\nthing she had remaining to her.  So she deemed it during the heavy sighs\r\nof night; partly conscious, that in some strange way it was as much as\r\ntossing her to the man who never could have condescended to the\r\npugnacious using of a stick in a street.  He, on the contrary, was a\r\ncover to the shamefaced.\r\n\r\nHer heart was weak that night.  She hovered above it, but not so detached\r\nas to scorn it for fawning to one--any one--who would offer her and her\r\nmother a cover from scorn.  And now she exalted Dudley's generosity, now\r\nclung to a low idea of a haven in her father's wealth; and she was\r\nunaware, that the second mood was deduced from the first.  She did know\r\nherself cowardly: she had, too, a critic in her clear head, to spurn at\r\nthe creature who could think of purchasing the world's respect.  Dudley's\r\ngenerosity sprang up to silence the voice.  She could praise him, on a\r\nreview of it, for delicacy, moreover; and the delicacy laid her under a\r\nmore positive obligation.  Her sense of it was not without a toneless\r\nquaint faint savour of the romantic, that her humour little humorously\r\ncaught at, to paint her a picture of former heroes of fiction, who win\r\ntheir trying lady by their perfection of good conduct on a background of\r\nhigh birth; and who are not seen to be wooden before the volume closes.\r\nHer fatigue of sleeplessness plunged her into the period of poke-bonnets\r\nand peaky hats to admire him; giving her the kind of sweetness we may\r\nimagine ourselves to get in the state of tired horse munching hay.  If\r\nshe had gone to her bed with a noble or simply estimable plain image of\r\none of her friends in her heart, to sustain it, she would not have been\r\nthus abject.  Skepsey's discoloured eye, and Captain Dartrey's behaviour\r\nbehind it, threw her upon Dudley's generosity, as being the shield for an\r\noutcast.  Girls, who see at a time of need their ideal extinguished in\r\nits appearing tarnished, are very much at the disposal of the pressing\r\nsuitor.  Nesta rose in the black winter morn, summoning the best she\r\ncould think of to glorify Dudley, that she might not feel so doomed.\r\n\r\nAccording to an agreement overnight, she went to the bedroom of Dorothea\r\nand Virginia, to assure them of her having slept well, and say the good-\r\nbye to them and their Tasso.  The little dog was the growl of a silken\r\nball in a basket.  His mistresses excused him, because of his being\r\nunused to the appearance of any person save Manton in their bedroom.\r\nDorothea, kissing her, said: 'Adieu, dear child; and there is home with\r\nus always, remember.  And, after breakfast, however it may be, you will,\r\nfor our greater feeling of security, have--she has our orders--Manton--\r\nyour own maid we consider too young for a guardian--to accompany you.\r\nWe will not have it on our consciences, that by any possibility harm came\r\nto you while you were under our charge.  The good innocent girl we\r\nreceived from the hands of your father, we return to him; we are sure of\r\nthat.'\r\n\r\nNesta said: 'Mr. Sowerby promised he would come.'\r\n\r\n'However it may be,' Dorothea repeated her curtaining phrase.\r\n\r\nVirginia put in a word of apology for Tasso's temper he enjoyed\r\nordinarily a slumber of half an hour's longer duration.  He was, Dorothea\r\nfeelingly added, regularity itself.  Virginia murmured: 'Except once!'\r\nand both were appalled by the recollection of that night.  It had,\r\nnevertheless, caused them to reperuse the Rev. Stuart Rem's published\r\nbeautiful sermon ON DIRT; the words of which were an antidote to the\r\nnight of Tasso in the nostrils of Mnemosyne; so that Dorothea could reply\r\nto her sister, slightly by way of a reproval, quoting Mr. Stuart Rem at\r\nhis loftiest: '\"Let us not bring into the sacred precincts Dirt from the\r\nroads, but have a care to spread it where it is a fructification.\"'\r\nVirginia produced the sequent sentence, likewise weighty.  Nesta stood\r\nbetween the thin division of their beds, her right hand given to one, her\r\nleft to the other.  They had the semblance of a haven out of storms.\r\n\r\nShe reflected, after shutting the door of their room, that the residing\r\nwith them had been a means of casting her--it was an effort to remember\r\nhow--upon the world where the tree of knowledge grows.  She had eaten;\r\nand she might be the worse for it; but she was raised to a height that\r\nwould not let her look with envy upon peace and comfort.  Luxurious quiet\r\npeople were as ripening glass-house fruits.  Her bitter gathering of the\r\nknowledge of life had sharpened her intellect; and the intellect, even in\r\nthe young, is, and not less usefully, hard metal rather than fallow soil.\r\nBut for the fountain of human warmth at her breast, she might have\r\nbeen snared by the conceit of intellect, to despise the simple and\r\nconventional, or shed the pity which is charity's contempt.  She had\r\nonly to think of the kindness of the dear good ladies; her heart jumped\r\nto them at once.  And when she fancied hearing those innocent souls of\r\nwomen embracing her and reproaching her for the knowledge of life she now\r\nbore, her words down deep in her bosom were: It has helped me to bear the\r\nshock of other knowledge!  How would she have borne it before she knew of\r\nthe infinitely evil?  Saving for the tender compassion weeping over her\r\nmother, she had not much acute personal grief.\r\n\r\nFor this world condemning her birth, was the world tolerant of that\r\ninfinitely evil!  Her intellect fortified her to be combative by day,\r\nafter the night of imagination; which splendid power is not so\r\nserviceable as the logical mind in painful seasons: for night revealed\r\nthe world snorting Dragon's breath at a girl guilty of knowing its\r\nvilest.  More than she liked to recall, it had driven her scorched, half\r\nwithered, to the shelter of Dudley.  The daylight, spreading thin at the\r\nwindows, restored her from that weakness.  'We will quit England,' she\r\nsaid, thinking of her mother and herself, and then of her father's surely\r\nfollowing them.  She sighed thankfully, half way through the breakfast\r\nwith Skepsey, at sight of the hour by the clock; she was hurriedly\r\nsentient of the puzzle of her feelings, when she guessed at a chance that\r\nDudley would be delayed.  She supposed herself as possibly feeling not so\r\nwell able to keep every thought of her head brooding on her mother in\r\nDudley's company.\r\n\r\nSkepsey's face was just sufferable by light of day, if one pitied\r\nreflecting on his honest intentions; it ceased to discolour another.\r\nHe dropped a few particulars of his hero in action; but the heroine\r\neclipsed.  He was heavier than ever with his Matilda Pridden.  At the\r\nhour for departure, Perrin had a conveyance at the door.  Nesta sent off\r\nSkepsey with a complimentary message to Captain Dartrey.  Her maid Mary\r\nbegged her to finish her breakfast; Manton suggested the waiting a\r\nfurther two or three minutes.  'We must not be late,' Nesta said; and\r\nwhen the minute-hand of the clock marked ample time for the drive to the\r\nstation, she took her seat and started, keeping her face resolutely set\r\nseaward, having at her ears the ring of a cry that was to come from\r\nManton.  But Manton was dumb; she spied no one on the pavement who\r\nsignalled to stop them.  And no one was at the station to greet them.\r\nThey stepped into a carriage where they were alone.  Dudley with his\r\ndreaded generosity melted out of Nesta's thoughts, like the vanishing\r\nsteam-wreath on the dip between the line and the downs.\r\n\r\nShe passed into music, as she always did under motion of carriages and\r\ntrains, whether in happiness or sadness: and the day being one that had a\r\nsky, the scenic of music swung her up to soar.  None of her heavy burdens\r\nenchained, though she knew the weight of them, with those of other\r\npainful souls.  The pipeing at her breast gave wings to large and small\r\nof the visible; and along the downs went stateliest of flowing dances;\r\na copse lengthened to forest; a pool of cattle-water caught grey for\r\nflights through enchantment.  Cottage-children, wherever seen in groups,\r\nshe wreathed above with angels to watch them.  Her mind all the while was\r\nbusy upon earth, embracing her mother, eyeing her father.  Imagination\r\nand our earthly met midway, and still she flew, until she was brought to\r\nthe ground by a shot.  She struggled to rise, uplifting Judith Marsett: a\r\nwoman not so very much older than her own teens, in the count of years,\r\nand ages older; and the world pulling at her heels to keep her low.  That\r\nunhappiest had no one but a sisterly girl to help her: and how she clung\r\nto the slender help!  Who else was there?\r\n\r\nThe good and the bad in the woman struck separate blows upon the\r\ngirl's resonant nature.  She perceived the good, and took it into her\r\nreflections.  The bad she divined: it approached like some threat of\r\ninflammation.  Natures resonant as that which animated this girl, are\r\nquick at the wells of understanding: and she had her intimations of the\r\nworld's wisdom in withholding contagious presences from the very mangy of\r\nthe young, who may not have an, aim, or ideal or strong human compassion,\r\nfor a preservative.  She was assured of her possessing it.  She asked\r\nherself in her mother's voice, and answered mutely.  She had the\r\ncertainty: for she rebuked the slavish feverishness of the passion,\r\nas betrayed by Mrs. Marsett; and the woman's tone, as of strung wires\r\nringing on a rage of the wind.  Then followed her cry for the man who\r\ncould speak to Captain Marsett of his duty in honour.  An image of one,\r\naccompanying the faster beats of her heart, beguiled her to think away\r\nfrom the cause.  He, the one man known to her, would act the brother's\r\npart on behalf of the hapless creature.\r\n\r\nNesta just imagined her having supplicated him, and at once imagination\r\ncame to dust.  She had to thank him she knelt to him.  For the first time\r\nof her life she found herself seized with her sex's shudder in the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nIN WHICH AGAIN WE MAKE USE OF THE OLD LAMPS FOR LIGHTING AN ABYSMAL\r\nDARKNESS\r\n\r\nAnd if Nesta had looked out of her carriage-window soon after the train\r\nbegan to glide, her eagle of imagination would have reeled from the\r\nheights, with very different feelings, earlier, perhaps a captive, at\r\nsight of the tardy gentleman rushing along the platform, and bending ear\r\nto the footman Perrin, and staring for one lost.\r\n\r\nThe snaky tail of the train imparted to Dudley an apprehension of the\r\nominous in his having missed her.  It wound away, and left regrets, which\r\nraised a chorus of harsh congratulations from the opposite party of his\r\ninternal parliament.\r\n\r\nNeither party could express an opinion without rousing the other to an\r\nuproar.\r\n\r\nHe had met his cousin Southweare overnight.  He had heard, that there was\r\ntalk of Miss Radnor.  Her name was in the mouth of Major Worrell.  It was\r\ncoupled with the name of Mrs. Marsett.  A military captain, in the\r\nsuccession to be Sir Edward Marsett, bestowed on her the shadow of his\r\nname.\r\n\r\nIt could be certified, that Miss Radnor visited the woman at her house.\r\nWhat are we to think of Miss Radnor, save that daughters of depraved\r\nparents!  .  .  .  A torture undeserved is the Centaur's shirt for\r\ndriving us to lay about in all directions.  He who had swallowed so much\r\n--a thunderbolt: a still undigested discharge from the perplexing heavens\r\njumped frantic under the pressure upon him of more, and worse.  A girl\r\ngetting herself talked of at a Club!  And she of all young ladies should\r\nhave been the last to draw round her that buzz of tongues.  On such a\r\nsubject!--The parents pursuing their career of cynical ostentation in\r\nLondon, threw an evil eye of heredity on their offspring in the egg;\r\nmaking anything credible, pointing at tendencies.\r\n\r\nAn alliance with her was impossible.  So said disgust.  Anger came like a\r\nstronger beast, and extinguished the safety there was in the thing it\r\nconsumed, by growing so excessive as to require tempering with drops of\r\ncompassion; which prepared the way for a formal act of cold forgiveness;\r\nand the moment that was conceived, he had a passion to commit the\r\nhorrible magnanimity, and did it on a grand scale, and dissolved his\r\nHeart in the grandeur, and slaved himself again.\r\n\r\nFar from expungeing the doubt of her, forgiveness gave it a stamp and an\r\nedge.  His renewed enslavement set him perusing his tyrant keenly, as\r\nnauseated captives do; and he saw, that forgiveness was beside the case.\r\nFor this Nesta Victoria Radnor would not crave it or accept it.  He had\r\nmentally played the woman to her superior vivaciousness too long for him\r\nto see her taking a culprit's attitude.  What she did, she intended to\r\ndo.  The mother would not have encouraged her.  The father idolized her;\r\nand the father was a frank hedonist, whose blood .  .  .  speculation on\r\nhorseback gallops to barren extremes.  Eyes like hers--if there had not\r\nbeen the miserable dupes of girls!  Conduct is the sole guide to female\r\ncharacter.  That likewise may be the hypocrite's mask.\r\n\r\nPopular artists, intent to gratify the national taste for effects called\r\nrealistic, have figured in scenes of battle the raying fragments of a man\r\nfrom impact of a cannon-ball on his person.  Truly thus it may be when\r\nflesh contends.  But an image of the stricken and scattered mind of the\r\nman should, though deficient in the attraction, have a greater\r\nsignificance, forasmuch as it does not exhibit him entirely liquefied and\r\nshowered into space; it leaves him his legs for the taking of further\r\nsteps.  Dudley, standing on the platform of Nesta's train, one half\r\nminute too late, according to his desire before he put himself in motion,\r\nwas as wildly torn as the vapour shredded streaming to fingers and\r\nthreads off the upright columnar shot of the shriek from the boiler.\r\nHe wished every mad antagonism to his wishes: that he might see her, be\r\nblind to her; embrace, discard; heal his wound, and tear it wider.  He\r\nthanked her for the grossness of an offence precluding excuses.  He was\r\naware of a glimmer of advocacy in the very grossness.  He conjured-up her\r\nfeatures, and they said, her innocence was the sinner; they scoffed at\r\nhim for the dupe he was willing to be.  She had enigma's mouth, with the\r\neyes of morning.\r\n\r\nMore than most girls, she was the girl-Sphinx to him because of her\r\nhaving ideas--or what he deemed ideas.  She struck a toneing warmth\r\nthrough his intelligence, not dissimilar to the livelier circulation of\r\nthe blood in the frame breathing mountain air.  She really helped him,\r\nincited him to go along with this windy wild modern time more cheerfully,\r\nif not quite hopefully.  For she had been the book of Romance he despised\r\nwhen it appeared as a printed volume: and which might have educated the\r\nyoung man to read some among our riddles in the book of humanity.  The\r\nwhite he was ready to take for silver the black were all black; the\r\nspotted had received corruption's label.  Her youthful French governess\r\nMademoiselle de Seilles was also peculiarly enigmatic at the mouth\r\nconversant, one might expect, with the disintegrating literature of her\r\ncountry.  In public, the two talked of St. Louis.  One of them in secret\r\nvisits a Mrs. Marsett.  The Southweare women, the Hennen women, and Lady\r\nEvelina Reddish, were artless candid creatures in their early days, not\r\ntransgressing in a glance.  Lady Grace Halley had her fit of the\r\ndevotional previous to marriage.  No girl known to Dudley by report or\r\nacquaintance had committed so scandalous an indiscretion as Miss\r\nRadnor's: it pertained to the insolently vile.\r\n\r\nAnd on that ground, it started the voluble defence.  For certain\r\nsuspected things will dash suspicion to the rebound, when they are very\r\ndark.  As soon as the charge against her was moderated, the defence\r\nexpired.  He heard the world delivering its judgement upon her; and he\r\nsorrowfully acquiesced.  She passed from him.\r\n\r\nWhen she was cut off, she sang him in the distance a remembered saying\r\nof hers, with the full melody of her voice.  One day, treating of modern\r\npessimism, he had draped a cadaverous view of our mortal being in a\r\nquotation of the wisdom of the Philosopher Emperor: 'To set one's love\r\nupon the swallow is a futility.'  And she, weighing it, nodded, and\r\nreplied: 'May not the pleasure for us remain if we set our love upon the\r\nbeauty of the swallow's flight?'\r\n\r\nThere was, for a girl, a bit of idea, real idea, in that meaning, of\r\ncourse, the picture we are to have of the bird's wings in motion, it has\r\noften been admired.  Oh! not much of an idea in itself: feminine and\r\nvague.  But it was pertinent, opportune; in this way she stimulated.\r\nAnd the girl who could think it, and call on a Mrs. Marsett, was of the\r\nclass of mixtures properly to be handed over to chemical experts for\r\nanalysis!\r\n\r\nShe had her aspirations on behalf of her sex: she and Mademoiselle de\r\nSeilles discussed them; women were to do this, do that:--necessarily a\r\nmeans of instructing a girl to learn what they did do.  If the lower part\r\nof her face had been as reassuring to him as the upper, he might have put\r\na reluctant faith in the pure-mindedness of these aspirations, without\r\nreverting to her origin, and also to recent rumours of her father and\r\nLady Grace Halley.  As it was, he inquired of the cognizant, whether an\r\nintellectual precocity, devoted by preference to questions affecting the\r\nstate of women, did not rather more than suggest the existence of urgent\r\nsenses likewise.  She, a girl under twenty, had an interest in public\r\nmatters, and she called on a Mrs. Marsett.  To plead her simplicity, was\r\nto be absolutely ignorant of her.\r\n\r\nHe neighboured sagacity when he pointed that interrogation relating to\r\nNesta's precociousness of the intelligence.  For, as they say in\r\ndactylomancy, the 'psychical' of women are not disposed in their\r\nsensitive early days to dwell upon the fortunes of their sex: a thought\r\nor two turns them facing away, with the repugnant shiver.  They worship\r\nat a niche in the wall.  They cannot avoid imputing some share of\r\nfoulness to them that are for scouring the chamber; and the civilized\r\nmale, keeping his own chamber locked, quite shares their pale taper's\r\nview.  The full-blooded to the finger-tips, on the other hand, are likely\r\nto be drawn to the subject, by noble inducement as often as by base:\r\nNature at flood being the cause in either instance.  This young Nature of\r\nthe good and the bad, is the blood which runs to power of heart as well\r\nas to thirsts of the flesh.  Then have men to sound themselves, to\r\ndiscover how much of Nature their abstract honourable conception or\r\nrepresentative eidolon of young women will bear without going to pieces;\r\nand it will not be much, unless they shall have taken instruction from\r\nthe poet's pen: for a view possibly of Nature at work to cast the slough,\r\nwhen they see her writhing as in her ugliest old throes.  If they have\r\nlearnt of Nature's priest to respect her, they will less distrust those\r\nrare daughters of hers who are moved by her warmth to lift her out of\r\nslime.  It is by her own live warmth that it has to be done: cold worship\r\nat a niche in the wall will not do it.--Well, there is an index, for the\r\nenlargement of your charity.\r\n\r\nBut facts were Dudley's teachers.  Physically, morally, mentally,\r\nhe read the world through facts; that is to say, through the facts he\r\nencountered: and he was in consequence foredoomed to a succession of\r\nbumps; all the heavier from his being, unlike the horned kind, not\r\nunimpressible by the hazy things outside his experience.  Even at his\r\ndarkest over Nesta, it was his indigestion of the misconduct of her\r\nparents, which denied to a certain still small advocate within him the\r\nright to raise a voice: that good fellow struck the attitude for\r\npleading, and had to be silent; for he was Instinct; at best a stammering\r\nspeaker in the Court of the wigged Facts.  Instinct of this Nesta\r\nRadnor's character would have said a brave word, but for her deeds\r\nbearing witness to her inheritance of a lawlessly adventurous\r\ntemperament.\r\n\r\nWhat to do?  He was no nearer to an answer when the wintry dusk had\r\nfallen on the promenading crowds.  To do nothing, is the wisdom of those\r\nwho have seen fools perish.  Facts had not taught him, that the doing\r\nnothing, for a length of days after the first shock he sustained, was the\r\nreason of how it came that Nesta knitted closer her acquaintance with the\r\n'agreeable lady' she mentioned in her letter to Cronidge.  Those\r\nexcellent counsellors of a mercantile community gave him no warnings,\r\nthat the 'masterly inactive' part, so greatly esteemed by him for the\r\nconduct of public affairs, might be perilous in dealings with a vivid\r\ngirl: nor a hint, that when facts continue undigested, it is because the\r\nsensations are as violent as hysterical females to block them from the\r\nunderstanding. His Robin Goodfellow instinct tried to be serviceable at a\r\ncrux of his meditations, where Edith Averst's consumptive brothers waved\r\nfaded hands at her chances of inheriting largely.  Superb for the\r\nchances: but what of her offspring?  And the other was a girl such as the\r\nlusty Dame Dowager of fighting ancestors would have signalled to the heir\r\nof the House's honours for the perpetuation of his race.  No doubt: and\r\nthe venerable Dame (beautiful in her old-lace frame, or say foliage) of\r\nthe Ages backward, temp: Ed: III. inflated him with a thought of her: and\r\nhis readings in modern books on heredity, pure blood, physical\r\nregeneration, pronounced approval of Nesta Radnor: and thereupon instinct\r\nopened mouth to speak; and a lockjaw seized it under that scowl of his\r\npresiding mistrust of Nature.\r\n\r\nHe clung to his mistrust the more because of a warning he had from the\r\nsilenced natural voice: somewhat as we may behold how the Conservatism of\r\na Class, in a world of all the evidences showing that there is no stay to\r\nthings, comes of the intuitive discernment of its finality.  His mistrust\r\nwas his own; and Nesta was not; not yet; though a step would make her his\r\nown.  Instinct prompting to the step, was a worthless adviser.  It\r\nspurred him, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHe called at the Club for his cousin Southweare, with whom he was not in\r\nsympathy; and had information that, Southweare said, 'made the girl out\r\nall right.'  Girls in these days do things which the sainted stay-at-\r\nhomes preceding them would not have dreamed of doing.  Something had\r\noccurred, relating to Major Worrell: he withdrew Miss Radnor's name,\r\nacknowledged himself mistaken or amended his report of her, in some way,\r\nnot quite intelligible.  Dudley was accosted by Simeon Fenellan;\r\nsubsequently by Dartrey.  There was gossip over the latter gentleman's\r\nhaving been up before the magistrate, talk of a queer kind of stick, and\r\nDartrey said, laughing, to Simeon: 'Rather lucky I bled the rascal';--\r\nwhatever the meaning.  She nursed one of her adorations for this man, who\r\nhad yesterday, apparently, joined in a street-fray; so she partook of the\r\nstain of the turbid defacing all these disorderly people.\r\n\r\nAt his hotel at breakfast the next morning, a newspaper furnished an\r\naccount of Captain Dartrey Fenellan's participation in the strife, after\r\nmention of him as nephew of the Earl of Clanconan, 'now a visitor to our\r\ntown'; and his deeds were accordant with his birth.  Such writing was\r\nenough to send Dudley an eager listener to Colney Durance.  What a\r\npeople!\r\n\r\nMr. Dartrey Fenellan's card compelled Dudley presently to receive him.\r\n\r\nDartrey, not debarred by considerations, that an allusion to Miss Radnor\r\ncould be conveyed only in the most delicately obscure manner, spared him\r\nno more than the plain English of his relations with her.  Requested to\r\ncome to the Club, at a certain hour of the afternoon, that he might hear\r\nMajor Worrell's personal contradiction of scandal involving the young\r\nlady's name, together with his apology, etc., Dudley declined: and he was\r\nobliged to do it curtly; words were wanting.  They are hard to find for\r\nwounded sentiments rendered complex by an infusion of policy.  His\r\npresent mood, with the something new to digest, held the going to Major\r\nWorrell a wrong step; he behaved as if the speaking to Dartrey Fenellan\r\npledged him hardly less.  And besides he had a physical abhorrence, under\r\ndictate of moral reprobation, of the broad-shouldered sinewy man, whose\r\nlook of wiry alertness pictured the previous day's gory gutters.\r\n\r\nDartrey set sharp eyes on him for an instant, bowed; and went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETEXT EDITOR'S BOOKMARKS:\r\n\r\nAll of us an ermined owl within us to sit in judgement\r\nCannot be any goodness unless it is a practiced goodness\r\nEminently servile is the tolerated lawbreaker\r\nHalf designingly permitted her trouble to be seen\r\nHappy the woman who has not more to speak\r\nIf we are robbed, we ask, How came we by the goods?\r\nLet but the throb be kept for others--That is the one secret\r\nLove must needs be an egoism\r\nNot to go hunting and fawning for alliances\r\nPortrait of himself by the artist\r\nPut into her woman's harness of the bit and the blinkers\r\nShare of foulness to them that are for scouring the chamber\r\nShe disdained to question the mouth which had bitten her\r\nThe face of a stopped watch\r\nThe worst of it is, that we remember\r\nTo do nothing, is the wisdom of those who have seen fools perish\r\nWe have come to think we have a claim upon her gratitude\r\nWhimpering fits you said we enjoy and must have in books\r\n\r\n\r\n[The End]",
