In a revised and amplified\r\nform they are now published as one of Johns Hopkins University Studies\r\nin History and Politics.\r\n\r\nThe aim of this revision is to furnish assistance to students beginning\r\nthe study of the history and practical workings of our political\r\ninstitutions. It is not the purpose to furnish a complete text-book upon\r\nthe government of the United States and its administration, but, by a\r\nclear, concise statement of the salient points of our federal system,\r\nand a description of the actual workings of the characteristic features\r\nof our institutions, to give to the student a better understanding of\r\nthe manner in which the same are administered, than is to be obtained\r\nfrom the ordinary text-books on Civil Government.\r\n\r\nThese Outlines are intended as an aid to both teacher and pupil, and for\r\nuse in a class whose members are already familiar with the leading\r\nevents and names in United States history. The work is intended to\r\nfurnish such supplementary information as can be obtained only with\r\ngreat difficulty by most teachers, and which for the most part cannot be\r\nobtained at all by the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe authors have endeavored to make prominent the fact that our present\r\nform of government is far from being contained in the written\r\nconstitution of 1787, and consequently, that a study of that instrument\r\nalone will give a very inadequate idea of our government as it is. The\r\nconstitution was but a foundation upon which to build a government.\r\n\r\nNothing like an analysis or commentary upon the constitution of the\r\nUnited States is here attempted. The public is already well supplied\r\nwith books covering that ground. History proper, except as showing the\r\nbasis and reason for the establishment of our institutions, has likewise\r\nfound no place here.\r\n\r\nThe book is to be used chiefly as a manual, to supply information that\r\nwould otherwise need to be dictated by the instructor. The Outlines are\r\nin many particulars merely suggestive. Many topics are simply mentioned,\r\nwhich the teacher must elaborate and explain at greater length.\r\n\r\nLastly, though this book does not pretend to give a connected account of\r\nour administration or politics, yet the subjects have been carefully\r\narranged in such an order as would most naturally be followed in a\r\ncourse to which the work is intended to be an aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of which history furnishes authentic record, and\r\nin all countries inhabited by man, people have found it necessary to\r\nbind themselves together by civic regulations so that certain things may\r\nbe done by all in common--in short, to establish some form of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nNow, as has always been the case, there are certain things which, from\r\ntheir very nature, cannot be left to each individual to do, or not to\r\ndo, as he may choose, or to do in his own way. First of all, there is\r\nthe necessity of some means by which the weak may be protected from the\r\nstrong. The individual must be protected in his life and liberty, and\r\nthere must be some guarantee to him, that if he is industrious the\r\nenjoyment of the product of his labor will be secured to him. Human\r\nnature being imperfect, disputes and injustice are sure to arise. Hence\r\ncomes the necessity of some power above the citizens and able to command\r\ntheir obedience, some power that can administer justice according to the\r\nrights and not according to the strength of individuals.\r\n\r\nTo thus control the actions of individuals, this power above the\r\ncitizens, this government, must possess functions of three kinds. First,\r\nlegislative power, or power to declare the rules of conduct to which the\r\ncitizen must conform; second, judicial power, or power to interpret and\r\ndeclare the true meaning of these rules, and to apply them to the\r\nparticular cases that may arise; and third, the executive power, or\r\npower to carry into execution these laws, and to enforce the obedience\r\nof the citizens.\r\n\r\nTo the student nothing could be more interesting and instructive, than\r\nto trace how, as tribes and nations have progressed in civilization,\r\ngovernment has advanced in its development. How, as men have progressed,\r\nfirst from the condition of savage hunters to the roving feeders of\r\nflocks, then to tillers of the soil with fixed places of abode, and\r\nfinally to builders of cities teeming with trade, commerce and\r\nmanufactures; how as men have thus improved in civilization and material\r\nwell-being, their mutual duties and common interests have become more\r\nand more important and numerous, and government as controlling these\r\ninterests and duties, has developed in form and improved in structure\r\nuntil it has become an all-powerful, complex machine, controlling in\r\nmany ways the actions, and even the lives of its citizens.\r\n\r\nFor thousands of years, governments have been developing and changing in\r\nform and functions, and a very large part of the history of the nations\r\nof the globe is identified with the history of the development and\r\nchanges of their governments. As new conditions and needs have arisen,\r\ngovernments have adapted themselves to them. In some cases this has been\r\ndone peacefully, as in England, and in others violently, by\r\nrevolutionary means, as in France. In some cases functions previously\r\nexercised have been relinquished, in others, new powers have been\r\nassumed; but in the majority of cases, the change has been merely in the\r\nmanner of exercising this or that power.\r\n\r\nAll peoples have not the same characteristics, nor have they developed\r\nunder the same conditions of climate, soil or situation. Different\r\nnations have, therefore, developed for themselves different forms of\r\ngovernment. Yet these governments, however different in their structures\r\nand administration, are in all cases distinctly referable to four well\r\ndefined types: Monarchy, Aristocracy, Democracy, and the Republic.\r\n_#Monarchy.#_--A monarchy is a nation at whose head is a personal ruler,\r\ncalled King, Emperor, or Czar, who has control of the government,\r\nappoints the principal officers of state, and to whom in theory at\r\nleast, these appointees are responsible for their actions. Thus England,\r\nGermany, Spain, Italy, Sweden, and others are monarchies. The sovereign\r\nholds his position for life, and usually acquires his throne by\r\ninheritance. Where the crown is nominally elective, as in England,\r\nkingship is practically hereditary, the regular line of descent being\r\ndeparted from only upon rare occasions.\r\n\r\nThe amount of power actually exercised, the responsibility borne by the\r\nsovereign varies widely in different countries, and upon the basis of\r\nthese differences monarchial forms of government are classified under\r\nthe two heads, Absolute and Limited Monarchies.\r\n\r\n_#An Absolute Monarchy.#_--An absolute monarchy is one in which the\r\nsovereign or ruler is possessed of supreme power and authority, and\r\ncontrols absolutely, without limitation or interference, all the powers\r\nof government. His word is law and requires not the sanction of the\r\npeople. His commands are absolute and require not the formality of\r\njudicial procedure, and are not necessarily in conformity with existing\r\nlaws. Implicit obedience to his commands, however arbitrary, may be\r\ndemanded, and there is no appeal. These are, theoretically, the powers\r\nof the absolute monarch. Practically, however, he is constrained to keep\r\nwithin fair bounds of justice and good policy, lest his subjects be\r\ngoaded to rebellion and revolution. The absolute form of monarchy exists\r\nto-day in the empires of Russia and Turkey.\r\n\r\n_#A Limited Monarchy.#_--A limited monarchy is one in which the\r\nruler, though at the head of the government, is not absolute, but is\r\nlimited in his powers by the action of a body of men, selected by the\r\npeople, who make the laws by which the nation is to be governed. The\r\nrespective rights and powers of the sovereign and of the law-making\r\nbody, are determined by a collection of rules, written or unwritten,\r\ncollectively known as the constitution. The constitution contains the\r\nfundamental law of the land. All acts of the government to be valid,\r\nmust be constitutional, that is to say, in conformity with the rules\r\nlaid down in the constitution. For this reason limited monarchies are\r\nalso known by the name of Constitutional Monarchies.\r\n\r\nEngland is the most conspicuous example of a limited or constitutional\r\nmonarchy. In consideration of our former connection with her, and the\r\nextent to which we have derived our ideas of government from her\r\npolitical institutions, it will be of great assistance to us if we stop\r\nfor a moment to consider her government, before proceeding to a study of\r\nour own.\r\n\r\nThe sovereign of England is termed King or Queen. Originally possessed\r\nof almost absolute power, the English ruler, at the present day\r\npossesses very little actual power and influence, much less in fact than\r\nthe people of the United States have entrusted to their President. The\r\nconstitutional history of England is largely the narrative of the\r\nsuccessive steps by which the people have wrested from royal hands and\r\ntaken under their own control, the powers of government.\r\n\r\nThe rights of the English people in the participation of their own\r\ngovernment are not contained in the written document, such as we possess\r\nin our constitution, but rest upon established custom and precedent, and\r\nvarious charters wrested from their kings.\r\n\r\nThe English Parliament, or, to speak more exactly, the lower branch of\r\nthe Parliament, called the House of Commons, rules the English people.\r\nThe Parliament or law-making branch of the English government, is\r\ndivided into two houses, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons.\r\nThe House of Lords is, as its name denotes, composed mainly of members\r\nof the noble families of England, who owe their seat in that body to the\r\nchance of birth. Theoretically possessed of powers of legislation equal\r\nto those exercised by the lower and more numerous branch (the Commons),\r\nthe Lords have in reality but a small voice in the control of public\r\naffairs. The House of Commons is composed of members elected by the\r\npeople. In this body reside almost all the powers of government. Its\r\nacts require the assent of the House of Lords and of the King, but this\r\nassent is almost wholly formal. The sphere of legislation allowed the\r\nEnglish Parliament is unlimited, differing in this respect fundamentally\r\nfrom our Congress, which is limited in its legislative field by the\r\nConstitution. From the English Parliament is selected the \"Cabinet\"\r\nconsisting of the principal executive officials, who guide the House in\r\nits legislation, and at the same time conduct the executive affairs of\r\nthe nation. These ministers, as they are called, are appointed by the\r\nking from the party in the majority in the House of Commons. They are\r\nresponsible to that body for all their actions, and retain their offices\r\nonly so long as they retain the confidence and good will of the Commons.\r\n\r\n_#An Aristocracy.#_--An aristocracy is a government in the hands of a\r\nselect few, called the aristocracy, who transmit this authority to their\r\nchildren. There are to-day no aristocratic governments proper, though\r\nmany nations exhibit aristocratic tendencies. In nearly all of the\r\nEuropean countries, one branch, at least, of their legislatures is\r\ncomposed of members holding their seats on account of noble birth, thus\r\nadmitting the aristocratic element into their governments.\r\n\r\n_#Democracy.#_--A pure democracy is a government in which all the people\r\nrule directly, meeting in popular assemblies in which is determined by\r\nthe votes of the majority how the government is to be administered. This\r\nform of government is obviously possible only in very small communities.\r\nSeveral of the Grecian states governed themselves after this manner. No\r\nperfect example of a nation with this form of government can be said to\r\nexist at this time. The nearest approach to pure democracy is found in\r\ncertain cantons of Switzerland. The Roman historian Tacitus tells us\r\nthat the early Germans governed themselves in a purely democratic\r\nmanner, and the first governments of several of our American colonies\r\nwere of the democratic type. When we come to the study of local\r\ngovernment in the United States we shall see the democratic form\r\nfollowed in the New England Town Meetings.\r\n\r\n_#Republic.#_--A republic is a democracy adapted by means of the\r\nintroduction of the representative principle, to the government of a\r\nlarge and widely separated people. Under this form of government the\r\npeople rule themselves, not directly, as in a democracy, but through\r\nagents or representatives of their own selection. The participation of\r\nthe people in their own government consists therefore merely in the\r\nchoice of officers to represent them and carry out their wishes. There\r\nexist at present several republics, the tendency seeming to be for\r\nnations to approach more nearly this form of government. France has\r\nbeen, since 1870, the best European example of a republic. Our own\r\ngovernment--the United States of America--is to us the most interesting\r\nand important example of a republic.\r\n\r\n_#Popular Government.#_--By the word 'popular' is meant, of or by the\r\npeople, and by popular government is to be understood a government in\r\nthe administration of which the people as a whole participate. Every\r\nchange by which new and greater political powers are given into the\r\nhands of the common people is considered a step towards the full\r\nrealization of popular government. During the last one hundred years\r\ngreat strides have been made in this direction by all European nations\r\nexcept Turkey and Russia. The extent to which this movement towards\r\npopular control of government can be safely and successfully carried is\r\na question of very great importance. To a very large extent it depends\r\nupon the intelligence, previous training, and natural political ability\r\nof the people who are to be entrusted with their own government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nThe Functions of Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, the functions performed by government are of a\r\nthreefold order: the establishment, interpretation, and enforcement of\r\nlaws. A division of government into three branches is thus called for:\r\nthe legislative, the judicial and the executive. The manner in which\r\nthese departments are related to each other, the extent to which they\r\nare vested in the same hands, and the degree in which they are separate\r\nfrom each other and independent in their workings, differ in different\r\ncountries. In England, as we have seen, the executive and legislative\r\nfunctions are closely united. In our government, as we shall see when we\r\ncome to consider its structure, complete independence of the three\r\ndepartments has been aimed at.\r\n\r\nAll statesmen agree that a good government should possess ample power to\r\ninterpret its own laws, and sufficient strength to fully enforce them.\r\nWhen we come, however, to the question of what are the proper subjects\r\nfor control by government, and what for free management by individuals,\r\nwe reach a subject upon which writers and thinkers have been unable to\r\nagree.\r\n\r\nUnder the great question, over how broad a field it is expedient and\r\nright to extend the activities of government, are embraced many of the\r\ngreat topics at present agitating the public mind. Difference upon this\r\npoint has been one of the underlying causes of the existence of\r\npolitical parties in the United States, and has furnished one of the\r\nreal springs of our history. Communism, socialism, and anarchy, may be\r\nembraced under this question. This it is that makes the study of the\r\nprinciples of government, especially in the United States, so important\r\nto every one who would understand the political life around him, and be\r\nable to form an intelligent decision upon the questions of the day.\r\nShall the nation or the state own and manage the railroads, the\r\ntelegraph lines, and the canals? Shall education receive the support of\r\nthe state? Shall the employment of women and children in mines and\r\nfactories be regulated by law? Shall the city own its own street\r\nrailways, its markets, its water and gas supply, its telephones, and its\r\nwater fronts? Shall this or that duty be delegated to the city or to the\r\nstate, or shall it be left to the chance performance of individuals or\r\ncorporations? These are some of the many questions of supreme importance\r\nthat meet us at every point, and the better we understand the true\r\nnature and structure of our government, the better shall we be able to\r\ngive intelligent answers.\r\n\r\nAmong the many functions of government, there are many so obviously\r\nnecessary to the existence of a nation, however organized, that there is\r\nno discussion concerning the expediency of their exercise by the state.\r\nWe may, therefore, group governmental duties under two heads: the\r\nnecessary, and the optionable; or, as Professor Wilson has named them,\r\nthe _Constituent_ and the _Ministrant_.[1] Under the first head is\r\nembraced all those functions which _must_ exist under every form of\r\ngovernment; and under the second title those \"undertaken, not by way of\r\ngoverning, but by way of advancing the general interests of society.\"\r\nThe following is Professor Wilson's classification:\r\n\r\n     _#I. The Necessary or Constituent Functions.#_--\r\n\r\n     (1). The keeping of order and providing for the protection of\r\n     persons and property from violence and robbery. (2). The fixing of\r\n     the legal relations between man and wife, and between parents and\r\n     children.\r\n\r\n     (3). The regulation of the holding, transmission, and interchange\r\n     of property, and determination of its liabilities for debt or for\r\n     crime.\r\n\r\n     (4). The determination of contract rights between individuals.\r\n\r\n     (5). The definition and punishment of crime.\r\n\r\n     (6). The administration of justice in civil causes.\r\n\r\n     (7). The determination of the political duties, privileges, and\r\n     relations of citizens.\r\n\r\n     (8). Dealings of the state with foreign powers; the preservation of\r\n     the state from external danger or encroachment, and the advancement\r\n     of its intellectual interests.\r\n\r\n     _#II. Optional or Ministrant Functions.#_\r\n\r\n     (1). The regulation of trade and industry. Under this head we must\r\n     include the coinage of money, and the establishment of standard\r\n     weights and measures, laws against forestalling, engrossing, the\r\n     licensing of trades, etc., as well as the great matters of tariffs,\r\n     navigation laws, and the like.\r\n\r\n     (2). The regulation of labor.\r\n\r\n     (3). The maintenance of thoroughfares, including state management\r\n     of railways, and that great group of undertakings which we embrace\r\n     within the comprehensive terms 'Internal Improvements,' or 'The\r\n     Development of the Country.'\r\n\r\n     (4). The maintenance of postal and telegraph systems, which is very\r\n     similar in principle to (3).\r\n\r\n     (5). The manufacture and distribution of gas, the maintenance of\r\n     water-works, &c.\r\n\r\n     (6). Sanitation, including the regulation of trades for sanitary\r\n     purposes.\r\n\r\n     (7). Education.\r\n\r\n     (8). Care of the poor and incapable. (9). Care and cultivation of\r\n     forests and like matters, such as stocking of rivers with fish.\r\n\r\n     (10). Sumptuary laws, such as 'prohibition' laws.\r\n\r\nUnder this second head have been included by no means all of the\r\nfunctions whose exercise by the government has been attempted or\r\nproposed, but they show the principal ones, and serve to indicate the\r\nnature of the optional field of governmental activity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Wilson, _The State_, Section 1232.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nColonial Governments; Their Relation to Each Other, and to England.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand clearly the early history of our country; to appreciate\r\nthe reasons for the grievances of the colonists against their mother\r\ncountry; and to gain an intelligent idea of the events of that most\r\ncritical period of our history, when the colonies, then free, were in\r\ndoubt as to the nature of the federal government they should adopt;\r\nproperly to understand all these facts, it is of essential importance\r\nthat we should gain a correct knowledge of the condition of the colonies\r\nduring those times, their relations to one another, their governmental\r\nconnection with and attitude towards England.\r\n\r\nThe thirteen American colonies, which in 1775 dared defy the might of\r\nGreat Britain, and which in a stubborn struggle were able to win their\r\nindependence, were settled at various times, and by colonists actuated\r\nby widely different motives. At the time of the beginning of their\r\nresistance to the oppressive acts of their mother country, they were, in\r\ntheir governments, entirely separate from and independent of each other.\r\n\"Though the colonies had a common origin, and owed a common allegiance\r\nto England, and the inhabitants of each were British subjects, they had\r\nno direct political connection with each other. Each in a limited sense,\r\nwas sovereign within its own territory.... The assembly of one province\r\ncould not make laws for another.... As colonists they were also excluded\r\nfrom all connection with foreign states. They were known only as\r\ndependencies. They followed the fate of their mother country both in\r\npeace and war.... They could not form any treaty, even among themselves,\r\nwithout the consent of England.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Story's _Commentaries on the Constitution_, Vol. I, p.\r\n163.]\r\n\r\nAll the colonies did not bear the same relation to the English\r\ngovernment. Owing to the different manner in which the right of\r\nsettlement, and occupancy of the soil had been obtained from the king,\r\nthe colonies had obtained different rights of government, and were\r\nplaced under different obligations to the crown. There came thus to be\r\nthree types of colonial governments; the provincial or royal, the\r\nproprietary, and charter governments.\r\n\r\n_#I. Provincial Colonies.#_--Those colonies which possessed a provincial\r\nform of government were royal colonies, being governed almost entirely\r\nby England, as she governs many of her colonies to-day. At the head of\r\neach was a Governor appointed by the King of England. He was assisted by\r\na council, also appointed by the king. The constitution and laws for\r\nthis form of government were contained in the commission and instruction\r\ngiven to the Governor by the English government. By them the Governor\r\nwas empowered to summon a representative assembly. The legislative body\r\nconsisted, then, of the Governor, his council, appointed by the king,\r\nand a lower house elected by the people. The Governor had the right of\r\nveto, and the power to dissolve the assembly. The legislature could make\r\nlaws, provided they were not repugnant to the laws of England. These\r\nlaws were subject to the approval of the Crown. The governor, with the\r\nadvice of his council, could erect courts, appoint judges, levy forces,\r\netc. From the highest courts in all the colonies an appeal lay to the\r\nEnglish King in Council.\r\n\r\n_#II. Proprietary Colonies.#_--The English King often gave to\r\nindividuals large tracts of land in the New World. In addition to\r\nownership of the soil, was given in many cases the right to establish\r\ncivil government. These proprietors had all the inferior royalties and\r\nsubordinate powers of legislation. The proprietor could appoint or\r\ndismiss the governor, he could invest him with the power to convene a\r\nlegislature, with power to veto its acts according to his wishes, and to\r\nperform all other powers of a governor. All laws made, those of Maryland\r\nexcepted, were subject to the approval of the English Crown.\r\n\r\n_#III. Charter Colonies.#_--Colonies under this form of government were\r\nso called from their possessing constitutions for their general\r\npolitical government. These written constitutions were charters obtained\r\nfrom the King, in which were granted to the people of the colony certain\r\nprivileges and rights of self-government which the English government\r\ncould not justly take away from them. One of the unjust acts that did\r\nmuch to arouse the colonists to resistance, was the attempt of the\r\nEnglish government in 1774, to annul the charter of Massachusetts by the\r\nRegulation Act. In this act was contained a precedent that (as Curtis\r\nsays) \"justly alarmed the entire continent, and in its principle\r\naffected all the colonies, since it assumed that none of them possessed\r\nconstitutional rights which could not be altered or taken away by an act\r\nof Parliament.\" The charters were very liberal, granting almost entire\r\nself-government. As in the royal colonies, the executive was a governor,\r\nand the law-making branch a legislature of two houses.\r\n\r\nIn Massachusetts the governor was appointed by the Crown, and had a veto\r\npower. The Council or upper branch of the legislature was chosen\r\nannually by the lower house, but the governor had a right of veto on\r\ntheir choice. The lower house was elected by the people. In Connecticut\r\nand Rhode Island the governor, council, together with the assembly were\r\nchosen annually by popular vote, and all officers were appointed by\r\nthem. In these two the governor had no right of veto, and the laws\r\nbefore going into execution did not require the royal approval.\r\n\r\nSeven of the original colonies began under proprietary governments--New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, Delaware, North and South Carolina, Maryland and\r\nNew Jersey. Of these, four--New York, New Jersey, North and South\r\nCarolina--became eventually provincial colonies, and Maryland was at one\r\ntime a proprietary.\r\n\r\nThree of the colonies, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island, were\r\nsettled under charters that were never surrendered. Three others,\r\nVirginia, Georgia and New Hampshire possessed charters for a while, but\r\neventually became royal colonies.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these diversities of government that have been pointed\r\nout, there were many features common to all the colonies. All considered\r\nthemselves dependencies of the British Crown. All the colonists claimed\r\nthe enjoyment of the privileges and rights of British-born subjects, and\r\nthe benefit of the common law of England. The laws of all were required\r\nto be not repugnant to, but, as nearly as possible, in conformity with\r\nthe laws of England. In all the colonies local legislatures existed, at\r\nleast one branch of which consisted of representatives chosen by the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe general condition of the colonies at the time of the outbreak of the\r\nRevolutionary War, so far at least as concerns their governments, has\r\nnow been given. What were the grounds upon which the colonists justified\r\ntheir resistance to the acts of English government?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they claimed that their rights were received from,\r\nand their allegiance was due to the King, not to the Parliament. The\r\ncolonists said the King was the only tie that bound them to England;\r\nthat Parliament was composed of representatives from England alone, and\r\ntherefore had powers of legislation only for England. Later, however, it\r\nwas conceded that in matters of general interest to the whole United\r\nKingdom, Parliament might exercise control, but that concerning all\r\nmatters of domestic and internal interest, and of concern only to\r\nthemselves, it was the right of their own legislatures to legislate, and\r\nthat under this head came taxation.\r\n\r\nSays Story:[1] \"Perhaps the best summary of the rights and liberties\r\nasserted by all the colonies is contained in the celebrated declaration\r\ndrawn up by the Congress of nine colonies assembled at New York in\r\nOctober, 1765 (Stamp Act Congress). That declaration asserted that the\r\ncolonists 'owe the same allegiance to the Crown of Great Britain that is\r\nowing from his subjects born within the realm, and all due subordination\r\nto that august body, the parliament of Great Britain,' That the\r\ncolonists 'are entitled to all the inherent rights and liberties of his\r\n(the King's) natural born subjects within the kingdom of Great Britain.\r\nThat it is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people, and the\r\nundoubted rights of Englishmen, that no taxes be imposed on them but\r\nwith their own consent given personally or by their representatives.'\r\nThat the 'people of the colonies are not, and from their local\r\ncircumstances cannot be represented in the House of Commons of Great\r\nBritain. That the only representatives of these colonies are persons\r\nchosen by themselves therein; and that no taxes ever have been or can be\r\nconstitutionally imposed upon them but by their respective legislatures,\r\nand that trial by jury is the inherent and invaluable right of every\r\nBritish subject in these colonies.'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Commentaries_, Vol. I, p. 175.]\r\n\r\nIn opposition to these views, the English government held that\r\nParliament had the authority to bind the colonies in all matters\r\nwhatsoever, and that there were no vested rights possessed by the\r\ncolonies, that could not be altered or annulled if Parliament so\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Revolutionary War, complete independence was not\r\nclaimed by the colonies. It was not until July 4, 1776, that they were\r\ndriven to a declaration of full and entire independence and\r\nself-government. By this declaration the colonies threw off their\r\ncolonial character, and assumed the position of states. This they did by\r\nsimply taking into their own hands the powers previously exercised by\r\nthe English King and Parliament. In the state constitutions which many\r\ncolonies formed during the year, their old colonial forms of government\r\nwere closely followed. Connecticut and Rhode Island, in fact, merely\r\ndeclared their allegiance to England absolved, and retained unchanged\r\ntheir old charters as their fundamental law. In Connecticut no other\r\nstate constitution was adopted until 1818, nor in Rhode Island until\r\n1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nSteps Toward Union.--Articles of Confederation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1774 the thirteen English colonies in America had had no\r\npolitical or governmental connection with each other. Any attempt on\r\ntheir part to unite without the consent of the English King or\r\nParliament would have been considered an act beyond their powers and as\r\ninsubordination towards the English government.\r\n\r\n_#New England Confederation.#_--In 1643 there was formed a union of the\r\nfour colonies of Connecticut, New Hampshire, Plymouth, and Massachusetts\r\nBay, termed the \"New England Confederation,\" which lasted forty years;\r\nbut this was merely a union for mutual protection against their common\r\nfoes, the French, the Dutch, and the Indians, and not for joint\r\nlegislation or government. It was a defensive alliance.\r\n\r\n_#The Albany Convention._#--(Franklin's Plan.) In 1754, however, there\r\nwas held a meeting of the colonies of New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, called\r\nthe \"Albany Convention,\" in which was proposed a union of all the\r\ncolonies under one government. Benjamin Franklin, the chief promoter of\r\nthis scheme, drew up an elaborate constitution which was to be adopted.\r\nAccording to this plan there was to be a chief executive, elected by the\r\nking, and a council of 48 members, to be chosen by the legislatures of\r\nthe several colonies. This scheme failed to obtain either the consent of\r\nthe king or of the colonies themselves. It was too much of a union to\r\nsuit the king, and not enough for the colonies. _#The Stamp Act\r\nCongress.#_--The indignation aroused by the attempt of England to tax\r\nher colonies without allowing them a voice in the Parliament which\r\nimposed such taxes, gave rise in 1765 to a meeting of delegates from\r\neight of the colonies. This assembly was called the \"Stamp Act\r\nCongress.\" The obnoxious Stamp Act was repealed, but England continued\r\nto impose other taxes.\r\n\r\n_#First Continental Congress.#_--An invitation was sent out by Virginia\r\nto all the colonies, calling a meeting of delegates to consider what\r\ncould be done by their united action to resist their common grievance.\r\nThus met the \"First Continental Congress\" in 1774, in which all the\r\ncolonies but Georgia were represented. This Congress adopted a\r\ndeclaration of rights and grievances. The colonies maintained that as\r\nlong as they were unrepresented in the English legislature (Parliament),\r\ntaxes should be imposed only by their own legislatures; also, that they\r\nwere entitled to the rights, liberties, and immunities of free,\r\nnatural-born subjects within the realm of England.\r\n\r\n_#The Second Continental Congress.#_--On May 10, 1775, assembled the\r\nSecond Continental Congress, in which all the thirteen colonies were\r\nrepresented. The battle of Lexington had then been fought, and blood had\r\nbeen shed. Though the colonies had as yet no intention of throwing off\r\nall connection with England, they were now prepared to resist with arms\r\nany invasion of their rights. The work performed by this body has been\r\nconcisely and forcibly stated by Schouler.[1] He says: \"Thus originated\r\nthat remarkable body known as the Continental Congress, which, with its\r\nperiodical sessions and frequent changes of membership, bore for fifteen\r\nyears the symbols of Federal power in America; which, as a single house\r\nof deputies acting by Colonies or States, and blending with legislative\r\nauthority, imperfect executive and judicial functions, raised armies,\r\nlaid taxes, contracted a common debt, negotiated foreign treaties, made\r\nwar and peace; which, in the name and with the assumed warrant of the\r\nthirteen colonies, declared their independence of Great Britain, and by\r\nGod's blessing accomplished it; which, having framed and promulgated a\r\nplan of general confederation, persuaded these same thirteen republics\r\nto adopt it, each making a sacrifice of its sovereignty for the sake of\r\nestablishing a perpetual league, to be known as the United States of\r\nAmerica, a league preserved until in the fullness of time came a more\r\nperfect Union.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hist. U.S._, Vol. I, p. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe acts of this Congress were the _first legislative acts by the joint\r\naction of the colonies_.\r\n\r\nThe Second Continental Congress was essentially a revolutionary body.\r\nThat is to say, the authority for its acts rested upon no definite grant\r\nof powers by the colonies, but was assumed by it to meet the crisis of\r\nwar. Properly speaking, it could hardly be called a government. It was\r\nmore in the nature of a directing advisory committee. Its commands\r\npossessed a recommendatory character only, and it was entirely without\r\nexecutive officers, or legal control over either individuals or the\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\n_#The Articles of Confederation.#_--A stronger central power than that\r\nafforded by the Continental Congress was seen to be a necessity.\r\nAccordingly, in 1777, there was drawn up a scheme of union embraced in a\r\npaper termed \"The Articles of Confederation.\" These articles, though\r\nadopted as early as 1777, did not go into effect until 1781, the\r\nprovision being that they should not be considered as in force until\r\nratified by _all_ the colonies, and several refused to ratify until all\r\nstate claims to western territory were relinquished in favor of the\r\nNational Government.\r\n\r\n_#Elements Tending to Separation and Those Tending to Union.#_--We must\r\nremember that this was a union of thirteen previously separate colonies.\r\nThe facts which had tended to keep them apart had been the difficulty of\r\ntravel and communication between the colonies, the lack of commercial\r\nintercourse, but more than all, their local jealousies. The small States\r\nfeared the larger; commercial jealousies were very keen. In 1756 Georgia\r\nand South Carolina actually came to blows over a dispute as to the\r\nnavigation of the Savannah river. Other disputes about boundaries were\r\nfrequent. Colonies with good harbors and seaports desired to keep the\r\nbenefits of them exclusively to themselves. At that time, too, the\r\npeople of the thirteen colonies were far more widely separated in their\r\nforms of government, their industrial habits and social customs than\r\nthey now are. On the other hand, the old facts which tended to urge on a\r\ncommon union between them were common race, language, and nationality,\r\nmany similar political institutions, and, most of all, common interests\r\nand a common peril.\r\n\r\n_#The Purposes of the Confederation.#_--The purposes of this\r\nConfederation are best stated by giving Article III of the Articles:\r\n\r\n\"The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship\r\nwith each other for their common defense and security of their liberties\r\nand their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each\r\nother against all force offered to or attacks made upon them, or any of\r\nthem, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretext\r\nwhatever.\"\r\n\r\n_#Scheme of Government under the Articles of Confederation.#_--The\r\nArticles of Confederation established a framework of government for the\r\nconfederated colonies, which government was to control those matters\r\nthat experience had shown could be executed only by united action. As a\r\nscheme of government it was no better than a makeshift. It was an effort\r\nto form a federal power without diminishing the powers of the States--an\r\neffort \"to pare off slices of state government without diminishing the\r\nloaf.\" That such a union could be perpetual, as the scheme professed,\r\nwas impossible.\r\n\r\nUnder these Articles of Confederation the sole functions of the federal\r\nauthority, legislative, executive, and judicial, were vested in a\r\nContinental Congress, consisting of a single house of delegates, who\r\nvoted by States, and were appointed annually in such a manner as the\r\nrespective States directed. Each State was entitled to not less than two\r\nnor more than seven delegates, a majority of whom decided the vote of\r\nthe State in question. The executive functions were largely performed by\r\na Committee of States, which was empowered to sit during recesses. For\r\nall important measures the vote of every State was required. The vote of\r\nall thirteen was required for an amendment.\r\n\r\n_#Defects of the Articles of Confederation.#_--In this scheme of union\r\nthere were many fatal defects. The principal of these defects were--\r\n\r\n1. The want of some compulsory means of enforcing obedience to the acts\r\nof Congress. The articles provided neither an executive power nor a\r\nnational judiciary worth mentioning. As one writer has said: \"Congress\r\ncould declare everything, but do nothing.\" A single colony could with\r\nimpunity disregard any decree of the Congress.\r\n\r\n2. The large vote required to pass all important measures.\r\n\r\n3. The absence of the right to regulate foreign commerce, and make\r\nduties uniform, and to collect those duties. This defect, as we shall\r\nfind, was one of the most vital, and more than any thing else decreed\r\nthe failure of the practical working of the Confederation, and showed\r\nthe necessity of a better and stronger National government.\r\n\r\n4. The virtual impossibility of amendment. Since a unanimous vote was\r\nrequired, the selfish interest of one State could, and did, stand in the\r\nway of an amendment beneficial and necessary to the other twelve.\r\n\r\n5. There was no power to enforce treaties. Foreign countries recognized\r\nthis, and therefore refused to enter into any treaties with us.\r\nWashington said: \"We are one nation to-day, and thirteen to-morrow. Who\r\nwill treat with us on such terms.\"\r\n\r\nEngland refused to carry out the conditions of the treaty of 1783, and\r\ncontinued to keep troops on our Western borders.\r\n\r\n6. The central authority had insufficient power to control disputes\r\narising between the States.\r\n\r\n7. The lack of a Federal judiciary.\r\n\r\n8. Lack of power to collect taxes, or to raise revenue to defray even\r\nthe ordinary expenses of government. This was the most striking and\r\nimportant defect of them all. The whole power given to Congress under\r\nthis head was the power \"to ascertain the sum necessary to be raised for\r\nthe service of the United States, and apportion the rate or proportion\r\non each State.\" The collection of such taxes was left to the States\r\nthemselves, and if they refused (as they frequently did) the Federal\r\nGovernment had no power to compel them.\r\n\r\nOur present better government was \"wrung from the grinding necessities\r\nof a reluctant people.\"\r\n\r\n_#Adoption of the Constitution.#_--Actual hostilities ceased in 1781. In\r\n1783 peace with England was declared, and the independence of the\r\ncolonies was achieved. The war left the American people with an empty\r\ntreasury, and a country drained of its wealth and impoverished by the\r\nexhaustive struggle. It left us with a large national debt, both to our\r\nown citizens and friends abroad, and most of all, left us with an army\r\nof unpaid patriotic soldiers. And no sooner had foreign danger been\r\nremoved than domestic troubles arose which filled all with gloomy\r\nforebodings for the future. With the loss of that cohesive principle\r\nwhich common danger supplied them, the colonies now began to fall apart.\r\nEven during the progress of the war the weakness of the Union had shown\r\nitself. Washington unhesitatingly declared that it was the lack of\r\nsufficient central authority that caused the prolongation of the war.\r\nOne instance will show how weak was the Federal authority. During the\r\nsummer of 1783, when Congress was at Philadelphia, some eighty deserters\r\nfrom the army so threatened Congress as to force a removal of our\r\nFederal capital from that place to Princeton. The Continental finances\r\nwere in a deplorable condition. Congress could not even collect\r\nsufficient taxes for the payment of the interest on the public debt. The\r\nStates could, and often did, refuse to pay their proportion of taxes\r\nimposed upon them by Congress. Congress made a last attempt, in 1785, to\r\nraise a revenue by a tax on imported goods, but this measure failed, New\r\nYork refusing to ratify. Congress, indeed, did not collect one-fourth of\r\nher demands. Commerce was going to ruin. England refused to allow our\r\ncountry the rich trade with the West Indies. To these troubles were\r\nadded the mutual jealousies and selfishness of the States. Each of them\r\ntried to attract commerce to itself, and passed laws hurtful to the\r\nother States.\r\n\r\nThe people in Massachusetts were in insurrection. The French minister\r\nwrote to his country: \"There is now no general government in America--no\r\nhead, no Congress, no administrative departments.\"\r\n\r\nFor all these evils the limited and imperfect powers conferred upon the\r\nFederal Government by the articles of Confederation afforded no adequate\r\nremedy. Even the Constitutional Congress was now in danger of breaking\r\nup. States, to save expense, neglected to send delegates, and repeated\r\nappeals had to be made to get representation from nine States so as to\r\npass important measures. A better union was seen by all thoughtful\r\ncitizens to be necessary, but very difficult to obtain, owing to\r\ninter-state differences. The idea of having a convention separate from\r\nthe Congress, whose work should be the framing of a stronger government,\r\ngradually gained ground.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Convention was obtained in a roundabout way, and only\r\nafter repeated failures. The first attempt to obtain an assembly of\r\nrepresentatives was made at Annapolis, Maryland. Only five States sent\r\nrepresentatives, and the convention accordingly adjourned to\r\nPhiladelphia, where in May, 1778, delegates from all the States, except\r\nRhode Island, finally assembled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nAdoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#The Constitutional Convention.#_--Fifty-five delegates were present.\r\nWith scarcely an exception they were all clearheaded, able, and moderate\r\nmen. Virginia sent Washington, Madison, Edmund Randolph; Pennsylvania\r\nsent Benjamin Franklin, Robert Morris, and James Wilson; New York sent\r\nAlexander Hamilton; New Jersey, Patterson; and South Carolina, the two\r\nPinckneys. Washington was chosen President of the Convention. Two rules\r\nwere adopted: 1st, proceedings were to be secret, and 2d, one vote was\r\nto be given to each State, thus making it of no importance whether a\r\nState had a large or small delegation.\r\n\r\nThough the delegates had thus assembled to form a better and new union,\r\nthey differed widely in their views as to what changes were necessary,\r\nand as to what powers should be given to the Federal Government, and\r\nwhat retained by the States. Some desired merely a change of the\r\nexisting Articles of Confederation, more power being granted, however,\r\nto the Federal Government; while others wished for an entirely new\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThe convention at once divided into two parties. The one representing\r\nthe small States, such as New Jersey and Delaware; and the other, the\r\nlarger States, such as Virginia, New York and Massachusetts. The plan\r\nbrought forward by the party of the large States was that presented to\r\nthe convention by Edmund Randolph, of Virginia, and generally known as\r\nthe National or Large State Plan. This plan proposed a congress of two\r\nhouses, having power to legislate on all National matters, and to compel\r\nobedience on the part of the States. Representation in both houses was\r\nto be based on population, thus giving to the larger, and more populous,\r\nStates the control of both branches of the legislature; and, also, since\r\nby this scheme the president, executive officers, and judges were to be\r\nappointed by Congress, control of the whole administration of the new\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the small States, Patterson, of New Jersey, introduced what\r\nis called the New Jersey plan. By this plan the old Federal Congress was\r\nto be continued with its single house of legislature, and equal State\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nThe great point upon which the two plans differed, was as to how\r\nrepresentation in the legislature should be apportioned among the\r\nStates; whether it should be according to population, and with two\r\nhouses, or whether there should be but one house, in which each State\r\nshould have an equal vote. The question was settled by a compromise. It\r\nwas agreed that there should be a legislature of two houses, a Senate or\r\nupper and less numerous branch; and the House of Representatives, the\r\npopular and more numerous lower branch. In the Senate each State was to\r\nhave an equal representation, thus putting the large and small States on\r\nan equal footing. On the other hand, in the House of Representatives\r\nrepresentation was to be according to population, thus favoring the\r\nlarger States.\r\n\r\nAnother point upon which the convention differed was concerning the\r\nslave trade; whether it should, or should not, be allowed to continue.\r\nThis question was also compromised, it being agreed to permit its\r\ncontinuance for twenty years (until 1808), after which all importation\r\nof slaves might be prohibited.\r\n\r\nYet another point in dispute was whether the slaves should, or should\r\nnot, be counted in estimating the population of the States, in order to\r\ndetermine the number of representatives to which each State should be\r\nentitled. This likewise was compromised. It was agreed that five slaves\r\nshould be counted equivalent to three white men.\r\n\r\nThese three main points being settled by compromises, other parts of the\r\ngovernment, such as a single chief executive, a Federal judiciary, and\r\nthe decision as to what powers should be given to the President, what to\r\nthe Senate, and what to the House, were more easily arranged, and the\r\nconvention adjourned September 17, 1787, having been in session a little\r\nover four months. Thus was prepared the Constitution under which we are\r\nnow living--an achievement declared by Guizot to be the greatest work of\r\nits kind, and by Gladstone to be the greatest work ever struck out at\r\none time by the hand of man.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution having been agreed to in convention, it was now\r\nsubmitted to the vote of each of the colonies for acceptance. It was\r\ndecided in this convention that it should be considered as ratified, and\r\nshould go into effect as soon as accepted by nine of the thirteen\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe adoption or rejection of the Constitution now became a question\r\nwhich claimed the entire attention of the States, and it is during this\r\ncontest that we find the origin of the first political parties in the\r\nUnited States. Those favoring the adoption of the Constitution were\r\ncalled \"Federalists\" and those opposing it \"Anti-Federalists.\"\r\n\r\n_#Arguments For and Against Adoption.#_--The Federalist party was\r\ncomposed of those men who were desirous of a strong central government,\r\nand for this reason favored the Constitution. This party was especially\r\nstrong in New England, largely because New England, being the commercial\r\npart of the colonies, had had the lamentable weakness of the old\r\nconfederation brought home to them the more forcibly by the\r\ndisorganization and loss of commerce which the Continental Congress had\r\nbeen unable to regulate.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Federalists were those who wished the State governments to be\r\nkept strong, and that there should be a comparatively weak central\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe argument used by the Federalists for the adoption of the\r\nConstitution was, that only by correcting all those defects of the\r\nConfederation which have been pointed out, could order and prosperity be\r\nrestored to the country. They said that the Constitution, being a series\r\nof compromises, could not please everyone in all respects, but that it\r\nwas the best that could be obtained under the circumstances. Their\r\narguments appeared in a remarkable collection of eighty-five essays,\r\ncalled the \"Federalist,\" written by Alexander Hamilton in company with\r\nJohn Jay and James Madison. In these were explained all the points of\r\nthe Constitution, and to this day they remain the best exposition of the\r\nConstitution ever written.\r\n\r\nThe objections raised by the Anti-Federalists were many. In the first\r\nplace, it was of course objected that it gave to the central government\r\ntoo much power; that state government and State liberty would be crushed\r\nout. The State was then as dear to the citizen as is the National\r\nGovernment to us to-day. Patriotism was then devotion to the State. The\r\ncolonists had suffered so much from control over their state governments\r\nby an outside strong government, that they were fearful of again putting\r\nthemselves under a strong national government though of their own\r\nmaking. In warning terms it was declared it would be a government\r\nfounded upon the destruction of the governments of the several States.\r\nThey said, \"Congress may monopolize every source of revenue, and thus\r\nindirectly demolish the State governments, for without funds they cannot\r\nexist.\" These elements of State love and jealousy of the Federal power\r\nare of the utmost importance in studying our history. We see them\r\nrunning through all our life as the main causes of division between\r\npolitical parties. (See later chapter on \"Introduction to History of\r\nPolitical Parties.\")\r\n\r\nAnother objection was, that the Constitution contained no definite \"bill\r\nof rights\" recognizing and guaranteeing fundamental personal liberties,\r\nsuch as freedom of speech, liberty of the press, assurance against\r\nunjust arrest, the right to bear arms, and trial by jury in civil cases,\r\netc. This class of objections was satisfied by the adoption of the first\r\nten constitutional amendments. It was also claimed by those opposed to\r\nthe ratification, that inasmuch as the Constitution placed no limit to\r\nthe number of terms which a President might serve, one man might become\r\nso powerful as to obtain a life-tenure of office, and thus the\r\ngovernment would degenerate into a monarchy. To show how exaggerated\r\nwere the fears during this critical period of our history, we have the\r\nreport that it was actually claimed and believed by many at that time\r\nthat the Federalists had the secret intention of inviting over to our\r\ncountry some European prince who should rule as king. Patrick Henry\r\ncried, \"We shall have a king; the army will salute him monarch.\" Though\r\nnot fixed by the Constitution, it has been since the time of Washington\r\nthe invariable rule that no man shall be elected for more than two\r\nterms. The friends of President Grant attempted to have him nominated\r\nfor a third time, but so strong was this prejudice that, popular as he\r\nwas at that time, the plan failed.\r\n\r\nFor nine months the struggle was wagered fiercely in the States, but the\r\nFederalists prevailed. In June, 1788, the ninth State ratified, and\r\nadoption was assured. Congress fixed the first Wednesday in January for\r\nthe election of presidential electors, the first Wednesday in February\r\nfor the meeting of the electors and election of the President, and the\r\nfirst Wednesday in March, 1789, for the inauguration of the President\r\nand the beginning of the new government. This last date fell upon the\r\n4th of March, which date has from that time served as the day for the\r\ninauguration of our presidents. Owing to a delay in the assembling of\r\nthe new Congress, Washington was not inaugurated, nor our present\r\ngovernment instituted, until April 30, 1789.\r\n\r\nThus was founded our present government, which has stood the test of a\r\ncentury. When adopted there were thirteen States; now there are\r\nforty-four. The inhabited area was then the narrow strip between the\r\nAtlantic Ocean and the Allegheny Mountains, with a population of\r\nscarcely 3,000,000. Now the United States stretches 3,000 miles from\r\nocean to ocean, and contains a population of over sixty millions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPresidential Succession.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Constitution regarding the Presidential\r\nsuccession, in case of the death or resignation of both President and\r\nVice-President, are: \"In case of the removal of the President from\r\noffice, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the\r\npowers and duties of the said office, the same devolve on the\r\nVice-President, and the Congress may by law provide for the case of\r\nremoval, death, resignation, or inability both of the President and\r\nVice-President, declaring what officer shall then act as President, and\r\nsuch officer shall act accordingly until the disability be removed or a\r\nPresident shall be elected.\" (Article II, section 6.)\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the power thus granted to it in the last half of this\r\nsection, Congress in 1792 passed an act declaring that in case of the\r\ndeath, resignation, etc., of both the President and Vice-President, the\r\nsuccession should be first to the President of the Senate and then to\r\nthe Speaker of the House.\r\n\r\nThis order was changed by the act of 1886, which provided that the\r\nsuccession to the presidency should be as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. President.\r\n     2. Vice-President.\r\n     3. Secretary of State.\r\n     4. Secretary of the Treasury.\r\n     5. Secretary of War.\r\n     6. Attorney-General.\r\n     7. Postmaster-General.\r\n     8. Secretary of the Navy.\r\n     9. Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the remainder of the four-years' term shall be served out.\r\nThis act also regulated the counting of the votes of the electors by\r\nCongress, and the determination of who were legally chosen electors.\r\n\r\nNote.--The Constitution made no provision in case of a contested\r\nelection, or when no one should be elected. Such a contingency seemed to\r\nhave been overlooked in the framing of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nElection of Senators.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the Constitution regarding the election of senators\r\nwere as follows: \"The Senate of the United States shall be composed of\r\ntwo senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six\r\nyears; and each senator shall have one vote.\" (Article I, section 3,\r\nparagraph 1.) \"The times, places, and manner of holding elections for\r\nsenators and representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the\r\nLegislature thereof, but the Congress may at any time by law make or\r\nalter such regulations, except as to the places of choosing senators.\"\r\n(Article I, section 4, paragraph 1.)\r\n\r\nUntil 1866 this matter was left entirely to the States, as permitted by\r\nthe section of the Constitution just given. In that year an act was\r\npassed by the Federal Congress regulating the election of senators by\r\nthe State Legislatures. By it was provided that the Legislature of each\r\nState, which is chosen next preceding the expiration of the term of\r\neither of their senators, shall on the second Tuesday after assembling\r\nelect a senator in the following manner: Each House shall by open ballot\r\n(_viva voce_) choose some man for senator, and he who receives a\r\nmajority of the total number of votes cast in such House is entered on\r\nthe journal of that House. At noon on the following day the members of\r\nthe two Houses convene in joint assembly, and the journal of each House\r\nis then read, and if the same person has received a majority of the\r\nvotes of each House he is declared duly elected senator. But if not, the\r\njoint assembly then proceeds to choose by a _viva voce_ vote of each\r\nmember present, a person for senator, and the person who receives a\r\nmajority of all the votes of the joint assembly--a majority of all the\r\nmembers elected to both Houses being present and voting--is declared\r\nduly elected. If no person receives such a majority on the first day,\r\nthe joint assembly meets at noon on each succeeding day during the\r\nsession of the Legislature, and takes at least one vote until a senator\r\nis elected. In case of a vacancy occurring in the Senate during the\r\nrecess of the State Legislature, the governor appoints a man to fill the\r\nplace, his appointee holding until a successor shall be chosen in the\r\nabove method by the State Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn the House, when vacancies happen in the representation from any\r\nState, the Governor issues an order for a new election in the\r\ncongressional districts in which such vacancies occur. The\r\nrepresentatives thus elected hold office for the unexpired terms of\r\ntheir predecessors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCongressional Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution created Congress and conferred upon it powers of\r\nlegislation for national purposes, but made no provision as to the\r\nmethod by which these powers should be exercised. In consequence\r\nCongress has itself developed a method of transacting its business by\r\nmeans of committees.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Legislature consists of two Houses--the Senate, or Upper and\r\nless numerous branch, and the House of Representatives, or the Lower and\r\nmore numerous popular branch.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is composed of two members from each State elected by the\r\nstate legislatures for a term of six years, one-third of whom retire\r\nevery two years. The presiding officer is the Vice-President. Early in\r\neach session, the Senate chooses a President _pro tempore_, so as to\r\nprovide for any absence of the Vice-President, whether caused by death,\r\nsickness, or for other reasons.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives is at present composed of 332 members and\r\nfour delegates from the Territories. These delegates, however, have no\r\nvote, though they may speak. The House is presided over by a speaker,\r\nelected at the beginning of each session. A quorum for business is, in\r\neither House, a majority.\r\n\r\nCongress meets every year in the beginning of December. Each Congress\r\nlasts two years and holds two sessions--a long and a short session. The\r\nlong session lasts from December to midsummer. The short session lasts\r\nfrom December, when Congress meets again, until the 4th of March. The\r\nterm of office then expires for all the members of the House, and for\r\none-third of the Senators. The long session ends in even years (1880 and\r\n1882, etc.), and the short session in odd years (1881 and 1883). Extra\r\nsessions may be called by the President for urgent business.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the November preceding the end of the short session\r\nof Congress, occurs the election of Representatives. Congressmen then\r\nelected do not take their seats until thirteen months later, that is, at\r\nthe reassembling of Congress in December of the year following, unless\r\nan extra session is called. The Senate frequently holds secret, or, as\r\nthey are called, executive sessions, for the consideration of treaties\r\nand nominations of the President, in which the House of Representatives\r\nhas no voice. It is then said to sit with closed doors.\r\n\r\nAn immense amount of business must necessarily be transacted by a\r\nCongress that legislates for nearly sixty-three millions of people,\r\ninhabiting a territory of over three and a half millions of square\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nLack of time, of course, prevents a consideration of each bill\r\nseparately by the whole legislature. To provide a means by which each\r\nsubject may receive investigation and consideration, a plan is used by\r\nwhich the members of both branches of Congress are divided into\r\ncommittees. Each committee busies itself with a certain class of\r\nbusiness, and bills when introduced are referred to this or that\r\ncommittee for consideration, according to the subjects to which the\r\nbills relate. Thus, for example, affairs relating to Washington are\r\nhanded over to what is known as the District Committee, a regular\r\nappropriation bill to the Committee on Appropriations, etc. These\r\ncommittees consider these bills carefully, frequently taking the\r\ntestimony of outside persons to discover the advisability of each bill.\r\nThe regular course through which a bill has to go before becoming an\r\nact--_i.e._, to pass both houses and receive the signature of the\r\nPresident--is as follows: On Mondays there is a roll-call of the States,\r\nand members may then introduce in the House or Senate any bill they may\r\ndesire. These bills are then referred by the presiding officer to\r\nappropriate committees. These committees, meeting in their own separate\r\nrooms, debate, investigate, and, if necessary, as has been said, ask the\r\nopinion of outside persons. After such consideration bills are reported\r\nback to the House or Senate. But very few bills reach this stage, for\r\nthe committee does not get time to report any save the more important\r\nones, and thus the majority of them disappear, or, as the saying is,\r\n\"are killed in committee.\" If a bill receives the approval of the\r\ncommittee it is favorably reported to the Senate or House, as the case\r\nmay be--_i.e._, the bill is returned, accompanied by a report advising\r\nthe passage of the accompanying bill. If the bill is not approved by the\r\ncommittee, an unfavorable report is made; bills are seldom passed after\r\nsuch an adverse report. These reports which accompany the bills, are\r\nprinted, often at great length, giving reasons for the proposed action\r\nin regard to the bills. When reported by the committee back to the house\r\nin which it was introduced, a bill is voted upon, and, if passed, is\r\nsent to the other branch. If passed there, it is ready for the\r\nPresident's signature; if vetoed, the bill is lost, unless passed over\r\nthe veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses. But frequently one house,\r\nwhile not wishing to defeat a measure sent to it from the other house,\r\nmay desire to change it by some amendment. If this is done, the bill, as\r\namended, is sent back to the house from which it came, and if then\r\nagreed to as amended by it, it is sent to the President for his\r\napproval. Thus by repeated amendments it may pass to and fro between the\r\nHouse and Senate several, times. In the House of Representatives, many\r\nbills are passed through all their various stages by a single vote, by\r\nwhat is known as a \"suspension of the rules,\" which may be ordered by a\r\ntwo-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nThe Senate is now divided into between fifty and sixty committees, but\r\nthe number varies from session to session. The principal committees are\r\nthose on (1) Foreign Relations, (2) Privileges and Elections, (3)\r\nJudiciary, (4) Commerce, (5) Finance, and (6) Appropriations. The Senate\r\nselects the members for the different committees by ballot, though it is\r\npretty well determined beforehand how each committee shall be\r\nconstituted by means of party caucuses (informal meetings of members of\r\nthe same party to determine upon lines of action that will be supported\r\nby all). A committee is always composed of an odd number of members, and\r\nboth political parties are always represented on every committee, though\r\nthe majority is, in almost all cases, from that party which has the\r\nmajority of the members of the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives is organized into sixty committees,\r\nranging, in their number of members, from thirteen down. As regards\r\nparty representation, their constitution is similar to that of the\r\nSenate Committees. The Committee of \"Ways and Means,\" which regulates\r\ncustoms duties and excise taxes, is by far the most important.\r\n\r\nOther important committees are those on (1) Elections, (2)\r\nAppropriations, (3) Judiciary, (4) Foreign Affairs, (5) Manufactures,\r\n(6) Commerce, (7) Labor. Every Representative is on one committee, and\r\nmost of them on several. Unlike the custom in the Senate, in the House\r\nthe presiding officer has the sole power of appointment, which makes\r\nhim, next to the President, the most important and powerful government\r\nofficial. The chairman of each committee has, of course, a large power\r\nover affairs with which his committee is concerned, and for this reason\r\nit is often said that it is the chairmen of these committees who rule\r\nthe land.\r\n\r\nThe precise amount of effective work done by Congress during the two\r\nsessions of the Fiftieth Congress was as follows: There were 4,000 bills\r\nintroduced in the Senate and 145 Senate joint resolutions: of this\r\nnumber 1,127 bills and joint resolutions passed the Senate, and 554 were\r\neither postponed indefinitely or referred to the Court of Claims, so\r\nthat the total number on which final action was taken by the Senate was\r\n1,681. The committee on enrolled bills examined 667 Senate bills and\r\njoint resolutions and sent them to the President and 591 became laws,\r\nthe number of vetoes, including \"pocket vetoes,\" being 76.\r\n\r\nThe House of Representatives passed 1,561 House bills and sent them to\r\nthe Senate, and the Senate passed 1,347 of them, leaving 214 to perish.\r\nThe House passed 56 House joint resolutions and the Senate passed all of\r\nthem but eight. The House passed, therefore, 2,284 House and Senate\r\nbills, and the Senate passed 2,522.\r\n\r\nThe first session of the Fifty-first Congress (1889-90) was, with one\r\nexception, the longest ever held.[1] During the session there were\r\nintroduced in the House 12,402 bills and joint resolutions, and in the\r\nSenate 4,570, making a total of 16,972. The total number of acts passed\r\nwas 1,335 as against 1,790 for _both_ sessions of the Fiftieth Congress.\r\nOf these 881 were pension bills.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The longest session was the long session of the Fiftieth\r\nCongress.]\r\n\r\nCongress ordinarily assembles at noon, and remains in session until 4 or\r\n5 p.m., though towards the end of the term it frequently remains in\r\nsession until late in the night. The first thing upon assembling in the\r\nmorning is prayer. On Mondays, as stated, there is next a roll-call of\r\nStates for the introduction of bills. Sometimes a committee is\r\ninstructed to prepare and bring in a bill of its own, without waiting to\r\nhave one introduced and referred to it. Reports from committees are\r\nheard during morning hours on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and on\r\nMondays after the introduction of bills. Friday is a day usually set\r\napart for the consideration of private measures. On Saturdays Congress\r\nseldom sits.\r\n\r\nThere is still one feature of Congressional government which needs\r\nexplanation, and that is the caucus. A caucus is the meeting of the\r\nmembers of one party in private, for the discussion of the attitude and\r\nline of policy which members of that party are to take on questions\r\nwhich are expected to arise in the legislative halls.\r\n\r\nThus, in Senate caucus, is decided who shall be members of the various\r\ncommittees. In these meetings is frequently discussed whether or not the\r\nwhole party shall vote for or against this or that important bill, and\r\nthus its fate is decided before it has even come up for debate in\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nThe Cabinet and Executive Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the functions of government are divided into three\r\ndistinct classes, the legislative, the judicial, and the executive. The\r\nConstitution provides as to the methods for the exercise of the first\r\ntwo, but none for the third. The only reference in the constitution to\r\nexecutive departments is in Art. II, Sec. 2, where the President is\r\ngiven the power to require the opinion in writing of the principal\r\nofficer in each executive department upon any subject relating to the\r\nduties of his office. The departments have in each case been created by\r\nan act of Congress and from time to time as convenience has demanded.\r\n\r\nThe duties of the executive are to enforce and apply the laws of the\r\nnation after they are made by the legislature and interpreted by the\r\ncourts. This is the real business of government, by which the laws are\r\nput into effect, and the work of government is actually carried on. In\r\nthe United States Government this power is placed in the hands of a body\r\nof men distinct from the legislative and judicial officers. At the head\r\nis the President, and hence his title of \"Chief Executive.\" It is\r\nevident that he must divide up the vast amount of work to be done, and\r\ndelegate it to others. Congress directs how this shall be done. For this\r\npurpose Congress has created nine executive departments (1)State,\r\n(2)Treasury, (3)War, (4)Navy, (5)Interior, (6)Post Office, (7)Justice,\r\n(8)Agriculture, (9)Labor.\r\n\r\nThese departments have been created as required by the growth of\r\ngovernment duties. Three departments, the State, Treasury and War, were\r\ncreated by the first Congress, in 1789. By the same Congress was created\r\nthe office of Attorney-General of the United States, who, together with\r\nthe Secretaries of the three departments, constituted President\r\nWashington's first cabinet. The Navy Department was added in 1798. Prior\r\nto that date, naval affairs had been managed by the War Department. A\r\nPost Office for the colonies was established by the Postal Act of Queen\r\nAnne's reign. The Post Office Department under the present government\r\nwas established in 1789, but the Postmaster-General did not become a\r\nCabinet officer until 1829. The Interior Department was created in 1849\r\nby grouping together in one department several branches of the\r\ngovernment service, which had formerly been distributed among the other\r\ndepartments. As early as 1839 the Patent Office, under the Interior\r\nDepartment, was intrusted with various duties concerning the\r\nagricultural interests of the country, among the chief of which was the\r\ndistribution of seeds. In 1862 a separate Department of Agriculture was\r\nestablished, and these duties transferred to it. In 1889 the head of the\r\nDepartment became Secretary of the Department of Agriculture and a\r\nCabinet officer. A Bureau of Labor under the Interior Department was\r\ncreated in 1884. In 1888 Congress constituted it a separate department,\r\nbut did not make its head a Secretary, and therefore not a Cabinet\r\nofficer.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the first eight of these departments together form a\r\ncouncil of eight, called the \"Cabinet,\" whose duty it is, in addition to\r\nthe management of the departments, to advise the President on matters of\r\nimportance. For this purpose regular meetings are held, at which the\r\naffairs of government are discussed, and lines of action decided upon.\r\nThe cabinet is neither the creation of the constitution, nor strictly of\r\nlaw. The existence of a cabinet, however, was always taken for granted\r\nin the discussion and formation of the constitution. It is a creation of\r\ncustom and has no powers other than of advice and counsel to the\r\nPresident. The growth of executive and administrative business is not\r\nfully indicated by the increase in the number of departments. The growth\r\nwithin each department has been much greater. Separate bureaus and\r\ndivisions have been created, which in some cases are, for all practical\r\npurposes, as independent and important as the departments themselves.\r\n\r\nThe organization of all the different departments is much the same. At\r\nthe head of each is an officer appointed by the President, the President\r\nthus having control generally over the whole executive business of the\r\ngovernment. These officers are called Secretaries, except in the cases\r\nof the Post Office Department, whose head is the Postmaster-General, and\r\nof the Department of Justice, whose head is the Attorney-General. In a\r\nnumber of the Departments there are also one, two, three or four\r\nassistant secretaries, according as the business of the departments\r\nrequires. For convenience in the despatch of business, the departments\r\nare divided into bureaus, the bureaus into divisions, and the divisions\r\ninto rooms, until, finally, the individual workers--the clerks--are\r\nreadied. Each bureau and division has at its head an officer called\r\nCommissioner and Chief of Division, respectively. Each department and\r\nbureau, and, in some cases, the division also, has a Chief Clerk who has\r\ncharge of the details of the administration, and immediate oversight\r\nover the clerks.[1] All work in one finely organized system. The clerk\r\nis responsible to his chief of division, the chief of division to his\r\ncommissioner, the commissioner to the Secretary and he, finally, to\r\nCongress. Each man has his particular place in the system, and no one\r\nworks at random.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are a number of officials and clerks who properly\r\nbelong to no division or bureau, as, for instance, the librarian's\r\nprivate secretary and other clerical assistance in the Secretary's\r\noffice, who are under his immediate supervision.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This system is not always carried out perfectly in\r\npractice. In some cases an officer is termed commissioner who is more\r\nproperly a chief of division, and _vice versa_. In other cases the title\r\nof commissioner or chief of division is represented by a more technical\r\ndesignation as Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, Comptroller of\r\nthe Currency, etc.] The President and heads of departments appoint all\r\nofficers in the executive departments. It is manifestly impossible for\r\nthem to base their appointments upon personal knowledge. Hence has\r\narisen the custom of filling almost all offices not controlled by the\r\nCivil Service Commission upon the recommendation of congressmen, each of\r\nwhom controls for the most part the patronage of his own district. Only\r\nthe Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, Commissioners, and other chief\r\nofficials are really appointees of the President on his own\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nPrior to the first administration of Jackson the positions of government\r\nclerks in the departments were permanent. In 1828 Jackson inaugurated\r\nthe so-called spoils system, which means that to the victor belongs the\r\nspoils. Only 74 removals had been made from 1789 to 1828. Jackson\r\nremoved during the first year of his administration 2,000 clerks. Since\r\nthen, until 1883, each party, on gaining control of the government, has\r\nremoved almost all the clerks in office who were of the opposite\r\npolitical faith, replacing them with members of its own party. In 1883\r\nwas passed the Civil Service Act, by which it is provided that all\r\nfuture appointments of subordinate clerks in the executive departments\r\nare to be made only from those who have passed successfully an\r\nexamination set by the Civil Service Commission created by the act.\r\n\r\n_#The State Department.#_--The Department of State was the first\r\ndepartment established. (Act of July 27, 1789.) There are three\r\nAssistant Secretaries. Their salaries are, Secretary $8,000, First\r\nAssistant $4,000, and the other two $3,500. The department is divided\r\ninto seven bureaus, (1) Diplomatic, (2) Consular, (3) Archives and\r\nIndexes, (4) Accounts, (5) Statistics, (6) Rolls and Library, and (7)\r\nClaims.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State is charged, under the direction of the President,\r\nwith the duties appertaining to correspondence with the public ministers\r\nand consuls of the United States, and with the representatives of\r\nforeign powers accredited to the United States; and to negotiations of\r\nwhatever character relating to the foreign affairs of the United\r\nStates. He is also the medium of correspondence between the President\r\nand the chief executive of the several States of the United States; he\r\nhas the custody of the great seal of the United States, and countersigns\r\nand affixes such seal to all executive proclamations, to various\r\ncommissions, and to warrants for pardon, and the extradition of\r\nfugitives from justice. He is regarded as the first in rank among the\r\nmembers of the Cabinet. He is also the custodian of the treaties made\r\nwith foreign states, and of the laws of the United States. He grants and\r\nissues passports. Exequaturs to foreign consuls in the United States are\r\nissued through his office. He publishes the laws and resolutions of\r\nCongress, amendments to the Constitution, and proclamations declaring\r\nthe admission of new States into the Union. He is also charged with\r\ncertain annual reports to Congress relating to commercial information\r\nreceived from diplomatic and consular officers of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of the Secretary at Washington is small, about sixty\r\nclerks, but that which concerns the diplomatic and consular service is\r\nimportant. To facilitate communications and negotiations with foreign\r\nnations, and to protect the interests of American citizens in foreign\r\ncountries, the United States, in common with all civilized nations, has\r\nan elaborate system of representatives residing at the capitals of all\r\nthe principal nations. This system is called the diplomatic service, and\r\nis under the charge of a separate bureau of the State Department.\r\nCommunications and negotiations with foreign powers are generally\r\ncarried on through them or through ministers of other nations stationed\r\nat Washington. These agents are called ministers and are of three grades\r\n(1) envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary, (2) ministers\r\nresident, (3) _chargés d'affaires_. These grades correspond to the lower\r\ngrades of similar services in European countries. We have no grade\r\ncorresponding to that of ambassador. The United States has ministers in\r\nabout thirty-three countries. The chief legations are those of Great\r\nBritain, France, Germany and Russia. The salary attached to each of\r\nthese legations is $17,500. The social demands upon ministers are great,\r\nand, as a rule, the expenses of ministers have been more than their\r\nsalaries. Ministers of foreign powers receive a much larger compensation\r\nthan do ours.\r\n\r\nTo protect our commercial interests abroad, and our seamen and vessels\r\nin foreign ports, the United States has agents resident in all foreign\r\nsea-ports of any prominence. Their duties are numerous. They ship\r\nseamen, certify invoices, take testimony, examine emigrants, etc. They\r\ntransmit to the State Department monthly reports concerning any matter\r\nof commercial or social interest occurring at their stations. These\r\nreports are published monthly by the department and have a wide\r\ngratuitous circulation. This system is called the consular service; and\r\nis also under the charge of a separate bureau. These agents, called\r\nconsuls, are of three ranks and titles; (1) consul-generals, (2)\r\nconsuls, (3) consular agents, of whom 180 are salaried, the rest being\r\npaid by fees. The names of the other bureaus indicate the nature of the\r\nduties performed by each.\r\n\r\nThe Department of State has been prominently before the people during\r\nthe last two years in consequence of the Pan-American Congress,[1]\r\ncomposed of representatives from all American nations. This congress met\r\nin 1889, under the auspices of the State Department at Washington, to\r\nconsider subjects of common interest, such as international arbitration,\r\nrailroad and steamship communication, uniform money and commercial\r\nregulations. Various standing committees and commissions were provided\r\nfor; and it is believed that through their efforts better commercial and\r\nsocial relations with the South American Republics will be established.\r\nThe International Marine Conference, composed of representatives from\r\nall marine powers, likewise met at Washington under the auspices of the\r\nsame department, and adopted a code of marine regulations for the\r\nguidance of all nations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Proceedings of the Pan American Congress were published\r\nby the Department of State, and also in the _Tribune Monthly_ for\r\nSeptember, 1890. Articles upon the subject _lay_ Mr. Romero, the Mexican\r\nMinister, appeared in the _North American Review_, September and\r\nOctober, 1890.]\r\n\r\nIn foreign relations the department has been chiefly\r\noccupied of late in the attempted settlement of the right of the English\r\nand Canadians to capture seals in Bering's Sea and Straits, and of the\r\nrights of American and English fishermen[1] in the fishing grounds off\r\nthe coast of New Foundland; in the conclusion of a new extradition[2]\r\ntreaty with England, and of various treaties concerning trade with other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _Tribune Monthly_ entitled \"Our Continent, or America\r\nfor the Americans.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: An excellent monograph upon the subject of Extradition, by\r\nHon. J.B. Moore, has been published by the State Department.]\r\n\r\n_#The Treasury Department.#_--This department was created by act of\r\nSeptember 2, 1789. There are two assistant secretaries. The department\r\nis divided into a large number of divisions, with the following chief\r\nofficers: (1) The Comptrollers, (2) the Auditors, (3) Treasurer, (4)\r\nRegister, (5) Commissioner of Customs, (6) Commissioner of Internal\r\nRevenue, (7) Comptroller of the Currency, (8) Chief of the Bureau of\r\nStatistics, (9) Superintendent of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing,\r\n(10) Director of the Mint, (11) Superintendent of the Life Saving\r\nService, (12) Supervising-Surgeon-General of the Marine Hospital\r\nService, (13) Supervising-Inspector-General of Steam Vessels. Other\r\nofficers are, the Supervising Architect, Commissioner of Navigation,\r\nSolicitor of the Treasury, and Chairman of the Light House Board.\r\n\r\nThe mention of the various divisions indicates the importance and\r\nvariety of the duties coming under this department. The Secretary is\r\ncharged with the entire management of the national finances. He submits\r\nannually to Congress estimates of the probable revenues and\r\ndisbursements of the Government, prepares plans for the improvement of\r\nthe revenue and for the support of the public credit, and superintends\r\nthe collection of the revenue. Two comptrollers pass upon all claims\r\nagainst the government and accounts received from the auditors. Six\r\nauditors examine and adjust accounts relating to the expenditures of the\r\nvarious branches of the government.\r\n\r\nThe Treasurer of the United States receives and keeps its moneys,\r\ndisburses them on the Secretary's warrants, and manages the Independent\r\nTreasury System. The Independent or Sub-Treasury System was adopted by\r\nCongress in 1846. By this means the Treasury Department is independent\r\nof the banking system of the country; but has established sub-treasuries\r\nin the principal cities of the Union for the receipt and disbursement of\r\npublic moneys. There are sub-treasuries in New York, San Francisco,\r\nSaint Louis, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, New Orleans and\r\nCincinnati. For greater convenience moneys are also deposited at certain\r\ndesignated banks. Secretary Windom, however, began rapidly removing such\r\ndeposits from the banks and announced his intention to cease the placing\r\nof deposits with any bank.\r\n\r\nThe Register of the Treasury is the official book-keeper of the United\r\nStates. The Commissioners of Customs and of Internal Revenue have charge\r\nrespectively of the collection of customs duties and internal revenue\r\ntaxes. The Comptroller of the Currency has control of the national\r\nbanks. The Chief of the Bureau of Statistics collects and publishes the\r\nstatistics of our foreign commerce. In the Bureau of Engraving and\r\nPrinting are designed, engraved and printed all government bonds,\r\nnational bank notes, drafts, United States notes, etc., for which work\r\nabout 1200 persons are employed. The director of the Mint has general\r\nsupervision over all mints and assay offices. In addition to his annual\r\nreport he publishes yearly a report on the statistics of the production\r\nof precious metals.\r\n\r\nThe titles of the other officers indicate the general duties of each.\r\nThe whole department employs about 3,400 persons at Washington.\r\n\r\nSome of the more important public questions coming within the province\r\nof the Treasury Department at the present time are (1) the Tariff, which\r\nhas been settled for some years by the high tariff act of this Congress;\r\n(2) the silver question involving the gravest questions of finance,\r\nlikewise settled for a time by the silver act of this Congress; (3) the\r\npurchase of bonds on the market as a device to reduce the surplus and\r\nprevent the accumulation of money in the Treasury; (4) the national\r\nbanking system, whose basis is being removed by the rapid payment of the\r\npublic debt; (5) the merits of the Independent Treasury System by which\r\nit is claimed that money is kept out of circulation and a stringency\r\ncaused in the money market; and (6) the advisability of transferring the\r\nrevenue marine service to the Navy Department.\r\n\r\n_#The War Department.#_--The War Department was established August 7,\r\n1789. There is one assistant secretary. The chiefs of the bureaus into\r\nwhich the department is divided, are officers of the United States Army,\r\nand a part of the military establishment. Their titles and duties are as\r\nfollows. The Adjutant General of the Army, who has under him a large\r\nforce of clerks, has the duty of issuing orders, conducting the\r\ncorrespondence of the department, and keeping the record. The\r\nInspector-General inspects and reports upon the condition of the army at\r\nall points, and the accounts of the disbursing officers. The\r\nQuartermaster-General has charge of the clothing, quarters, and\r\nsupplies, except food supplies, which form the province of the\r\nCommissary-General. The Surgeon-General has charge of the medical\r\ndepartment, of the Army Medical Museum, and a special library. The Chief\r\nof Engineers has charge of the construction of fortifications, etc. The\r\nJudge-Advocate-General reviews the proceedings of courts-martial, and\r\nadvises the Secretary on points of law. There are also a\r\nPaymaster-General, a Chief of Ordnance, and a Chief Signal Officer. The\r\nChief Signal Officer has charge of the system of communicating with\r\ndistant points by means of various systems of signals, the most\r\nnoteworthy of which is that of the heliograph, by which information is\r\nconveyed by the use of sun-reflecting mirrors. Communication has been\r\nestablished between points 125 miles distant by means of a heliograph\r\nwith a reflecting surface of but twenty square inches.\r\n\r\nThe War Department answers more nearly than any other to the Department\r\nof Public Works found in other governments. All public improvements, the\r\nconstruction of docks, bridges, and the improvement of rivers and\r\nharbors, are under the supervision of army engineers. All arctic\r\nexplorations and the explorations of our western territory, have been\r\nconducted by army officers under the direction of the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nThe publication of war records is being made by a special board in the\r\nWar Department. Thirty-five volumes have been published. It is estimated\r\nthat there will be one hundred and nineteen volumes when the work is\r\ncompleted. The Secretary of War also has charge of the Military Academy\r\nat West Point, of certain national parks, and homes for disabled\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe army is commanded by a lieutenant-general under whom are three\r\nmajor-generals and six brigadier-generals. It consists of about 26,000\r\nmen distributed in the three divisions of the Missouri, the Atlantic,\r\nand the Pacific, of which the first contains four departments, the\r\nsecond, one, and the third, three. Congress appropriates and expends\r\nthrough the War Department $400,000 yearly on the National Guard for its\r\narmament and equipment. The aggregate of this reserve army regularly\r\norganized and uniformed is 106,500 men. The Secretary also details army\r\nofficers to furnish military instruction at various colleges.\r\n\r\nThe principal questions to-day concerning the War Department are the\r\nadvisability of strengthening our coast defences, and the lessening of\r\nthe desertions in the army, which amount yearly to from ten to fifteen\r\nper cent, of the total strength of the army.\r\n\r\n_#The Navy Department.#_--The Navy Department was established April 30,\r\n1798. There is one assistant secretary. The routine work of the\r\ndepartment is distributed among eight bureaus: (1) of Yards and Docks,\r\n(2) of Equipment and Recruiting, (3) of Navigation, (4) of Ordinance,\r\n(5) of Construction and Repair, (6) of Steam Engineering, (7) of\r\nProvisions and Clothing, (8) of Medicine and Surgery. The chiefs of the\r\nbureaus are officers of the United States Navy. There is a hydrographic\r\noffice attached to the bureau of navigation, which prepares maps, charts\r\nand nautical books relating to navigation, and makes investigations\r\nconcerning marine meteorology. This Department has charge of the Naval\r\nObservatory for which a new set of buildings is now being built at\r\nWashington. The Department publishes yearly, for the guidance of seamen,\r\nthe nautical almanac, the preparation of which is intrusted to a\r\nseparate bureau. The department also compiles and publishes naval\r\nrecords of the recent war, and has charge of the Naval Academy at\r\nAnnapolis, Maryland. The Officers of the Navy upon the active list\r\ninclude one admiral, one vice-admiral, six rear-admirals, and ten\r\ncommodores. The naval force includes 10,000 officers and men, together\r\nwith 2,000 marines. The number of vessels of the United States Navy when\r\nall the ships now authorized are completed, excluding those which by the\r\nprocess of decay and the operation of law will by that date have been\r\ncondemned, will comprise 11 armored and 31 unarmored vessels. The five\r\nstations maintained are the Asiatic, European, North Atlantic, South\r\nAtlantic, and Pacific. The chief matter of present public interest\r\nconcerning this department is the creation of a new navy by the\r\nconstruction of modern steel vessels. This new policy was begun in 1882.\r\n\r\n_#The Interior Department.#_--The Interior Department was created in\r\n1849, to take charge of various duties not properly belonging to any of\r\nthe existing departments. There are two assistant secretaries. The\r\nchiefs of the bureaus into which this department is divided, and their\r\nrespective duties are as follows: _The Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice_ has charge of all the public land of the government, its care,\r\nsupervision, and sale or distribution. In another chapter we give\r\nfurther details concerning the operations of this important bureau.\r\n\r\n_The Commissioner of Pensions_ has charge of the granting of pensions to\r\nold soldiers and sailors. He has a large force at Washington. There are\r\neighteen pension agencies in different parts of the country. In 1808 the\r\nUnited States assumed all the state pension obligations. The act of 1818\r\ngave pensions to all who had served nine months in the Revolutionary\r\nWar; other wars were afterwards included. The acts of the period\r\nbeginning 1862 have enormously increased the amount paid. The report of\r\nthe Commissioner for 1890 shows that at the close of the fiscal year of\r\n1889 the number of pensioners was 537,944, and the annual expenditures\r\nfor pensions $105,528,180.38.\r\n\r\nThe disability pension law passed June 27,1890, will greatly lengthen\r\nthe pension list and increase the annual expenditures. The present\r\nCommissioner says in his last report that \"it is believed that there are\r\nprobably over one hundred thousand claims in this office which can be\r\nproperly allowed under the provisions of these regulations. The act of\r\nJune 27, 1890, is the first disability pension law in the history of the\r\nworld which grants to soldiers and sailors pensions for disabilities\r\nwhich are not proven to have been incurred in the service and in line of\r\nduty.\" Speaker Reed of the House characterized it as \"the most generous\r\npiece of pension legislation ever passed by any nation on earth.\"\r\n\r\n_The Commissioner of Patents_ has charge of the granting of patents. Up\r\nto 1793 the granting of letters-patent was given to a board consisting\r\nof the Secretary of State, Secretary of War and the Attorney General,\r\nthe records and models being kept in the Department of State. In 1793\r\nthe granting of patents was given exclusively to the Secretary of State.\r\nIn 1821 the clerk of the State Department who examined applications for\r\npatents received the title of Superintendent of the Patent Office, and\r\non July 4, 1836, the Patent Office was created as a separate bureau and\r\na Commissioner of Patents created.\r\n\r\nAbout 24,000 patents are issued annually. There is an Assistant\r\nCommissioner-in-chief, an Examiner of Interferences, three\r\nExaminers-in-chief, thirty-eight Principal Examiners, and a large force\r\nof assistant examiners for different branches. Patents run for seventeen\r\nyears. The annual receipts of the bureau from fees more than equal the\r\nexpenditures, and the office now has a surplus of several millions to\r\nits credit in the Treasury.\r\n\r\n_The Commissioner of Indian Affairs_ has charge of all matters\r\nconcerning the Indians, their education, government and support. There\r\nare 239 Indian schools supported by appropriations made by Congress, 147\r\nof which are controlled directly by the Indian Bureau. The average\r\nattendance of pupils at these schools is between eleven and twelve\r\nthousand. The number of Indians in our country (not counting those of\r\nAlaska) is about 250,000. They occupy or have control of about\r\n116,630,106 acres.\r\n\r\n_The Bureau of Education_ was originally established as an independent\r\nDepartment by act of Congress, approved by the President March 2, 1867.\r\nBy an act of Congress which took effect July 1, 1869, this Department\r\nwas changed to an Office or Bureau in the Interior Department. The\r\nduties of this Bureau are to collect and diffuse information regarding\r\nschools, methods of instruction and school discipline, etc., and\r\notherwise to promote the cause of education. The results of the\r\ninvestigations here carried on, though with a small clerical force, are\r\nof the utmost value to all educators, and such is the extent to which\r\nthe merit of the work and publications of this office are recognized by\r\nthe leading educators of the country, that, in their opinion, the Bureau\r\nshould be re-established as a department, and its chief be made a member\r\nof the President's cabinet. The publications of the Bureau consist of\r\n(1) _Annual Reports_, which set forth statistics and general information\r\nconcerning the educational systems of the States, Territories, larger\r\ncities, universities, and colleges; professional, special, and\r\nscientific schools, academies, preparatory schools and kindergartens,\r\nwith a summary of the progress of education in foreign countries; (2)\r\n_Special Reports_, on subjects pertinent to the times; (3) _Occasional\r\nBulletins_, on matters of current educational interest; (4) _Circulars\r\nof Information_, on important questions of educational work or history,\r\nwhich are issued in yearly series. Under this last title there is now in\r\ncourse of publication a very valuable series of monographs upon the\r\nHistory of Higher Education in the various States. These monographs are\r\nbeing prepared by competent scholars under the editorial supervision of\r\nDr. H.B. Adams of the Johns Hopkins University. Numerous Annual Reports\r\nhave been issued, and one is now in press, for the year 1889-90. The\r\nworking force of the Bureau is divided into three divisions: (1)\r\nRecords; (2) Statistics; (3) Library and Museum. The library of this\r\nOffice contains one of the most valuable pedagogical collections in the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_The Commissioner of Railroads_ has charge of the government's interests\r\nin certain railroads to which the United States has granted loans of\r\ncredit or subsidies in lands or bonds. By the acts of July 1, 1862, and\r\nJuly 1, 1864, Congress, in order to encourage the building of a\r\ntrans-continental railroad, granted to several Pacific railroad\r\ncompanies subsidies in land adjacent to the roads, and issued certain\r\namounts of bonds on which was guaranteed interest at the rate of six per\r\ncent. The amount of lands given and bonds issued were in proportion to\r\nthe number of miles of road constructed. The lands were a gift. The\r\nbonds were to be repaid by the companies with all interest which might\r\nhave been advanced by the government. From 1850 to 1872 the various\r\nrailroads received a total of 155,504,994 acres of lands, and\r\n$147,110,069 proceeds of bonds and interest paid by the United States.\r\nThe roads have repaid of this amount $36,723,477, leaving at the present\r\ntime due from the roads to the United States the sum of $110,386,592.\r\nThis they will be unable to pay upon the maturity of the bonds, and a\r\nbill has been before Congress for several sessions looking towards a\r\nbetter adjustment of this debt. The Commissioner of Railroads was\r\noriginally styled the \"Auditor of Railroad Accounts.\" The office was\r\ncreated June 19, 1878.\r\n\r\n_Geological Survey_.--This branch of the Interior Department was\r\nestablished in 1879. Its work is the investigation and determination of\r\nthe geological structure of the various sections of the country, the\r\ncomposition of soils, the reclamation of waste lands, etc. In this\r\nbureau are made topographical surveys and irrigation surveys of arid\r\nregions of the United States. The publications connected with this work,\r\nnumber ten Annual Reports, thirteen Monographs, fifty-eight Bulletins\r\nand five Statistical Papers. In these there is a discussion of the\r\ngeological structure of every state and territory, and information\r\nconcerning the occurrence and production of each great metallic and\r\nmineral staple of the country. The bureau comprises one geographical,\r\ntwelve geological, six paleontological and four accessory divisions. A\r\ndivision of mines and mining publishes an annual report on the mineral\r\nresources and production of the United States.\r\n\r\n_The Superintendent of the Census._--The Superintendent of the Census is\r\nappointed each decade for the purpose of taking the regular decennial\r\ncensus. The Eleventh Census has just been taken. The first was taken in\r\n1790. Each census has shown a tendency to be more elaborate and to\r\nembrace a greater number of subjects than any preceding. There were\r\nemployed in the taking of the Eleventh Census 42,000 enumerators, 2,000\r\nclerks, from 800 to 900 special agents, 175 supervisors and 25 experts.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these eight bureaus, the department has charge of various\r\nother branches of government. All of the territories come under the\r\nSecretary's supervision, and look to him in case of any difficulty. The\r\nSecretary also has charge of the Yellowstone National Park, the Hot\r\nSprings Reservation in Arkansas, and of certain hospitals and\r\neleemosynary institutions in the District of Columbia. A Superintendent\r\nof Public Documents looks after the receipt, distribution, and sale of\r\ngovernment publications.\r\n\r\nThe most important subjects of recent legislation concerning this\r\ndepartment have been the dependent pension act, the act providing for\r\nthe survey of Western lands suitable for irrigation, and the land\r\nforfeiture act. By this act over 8,000,000 acres of lands were forfeited\r\nby the railroads for failure to fulfill the conditions under which the\r\nland was originally granted to them.\r\n\r\n_#The Post Office Department.#_--The Post Office Department was\r\nestablished in 1789, but the Postmaster-General did not become a cabinet\r\nofficer until 1829. The Postmaster-General has charge and management of\r\nthe department, and of the domestic and foreign mail service. He can\r\nestablish post offices and appoint postmasters of the fourth and fifth\r\nclasses, i.e. those whose salaries are less than $1,000. These number\r\nover 50,000. The total number of postoffices is about 56,000. The\r\nPresident appoints to those of the first three classes. Other officers\r\nbesides the Assistant Postmasters-General are, the Superintendents of\r\nthe Money Order Division, of Foreign Mails, and of the Railway Service,\r\nand an Assistant Attorney-General for the department.\r\n\r\nThe United States is a member of the Universal Postal Union, of which\r\nmost, if not all, of the civilized countries are members. The central\r\noffice is known as the International Bureau of the Universal Postal\r\nUnion, and is conducted under the superintendence of the Swiss Postal\r\nAdministration, and its expenses are borne by all the nations composing\r\nthe Union. The revenues of the Post Office Department nearly equal the\r\nexpenditures, and would have exceeded them before this but for the fact\r\nthat as soon as the amount of receipts has warranted, improvements have\r\nbeen made in the service, through the reduction of postage rates and\r\nthe extension of the free delivery system. It has never been the policy\r\nof the government to make this department a source of revenue.\r\n\r\nThe patronage of the postoffice department is the most important of any\r\nof the departments, and it is very largely for this reason that the\r\nPostmaster-General is a member of the Cabinet. Crawford of South\r\nCarolina secured in 1820 the passage of an act limiting the term of\r\noffice of postmasters to four years. The appointment of postmasters does\r\nnot come under the Civil Service Act. It is the principal aim of civil\r\nservice reformers, that postmasters should be appointed under its\r\nprovisions. The most important questions of public policy concerning\r\nthis department, are the reduction of postage rates on letters to one\r\ncent; the advisability of the establishment of a postal telegraph\r\nservice; the extension of the free delivery system, and the relation of\r\nthe department to the civil service regulations.\r\n\r\n_#The Department of Justice.#_--The office of the Attorney-General of\r\nthe United States was established in 1789; the Department of Justice not\r\nuntil 1870. The Attorney-General gives advice upon legal points to the\r\nPresident and also, when requested to do so, to the heads of\r\ndepartments. He directs the cases of the United States and sometimes\r\nappears in them, especially in the Supreme Court. He supervises the\r\nUnited States Marshals and District Attorneys. His substitute and\r\nprincipal assistant is the Solicitor-General. There are two\r\nAssistant-Attorneys-General, the business of the one being connected\r\nwith the Supreme Court, and of the other with the Court of Claims. There\r\nare also, as mentioned before, certain legal officers attached to the\r\nother departments. Additional counsel is frequently employed to assist\r\nin the argument of important cases. To the Attorney-General belongs the\r\nduty of recommending persons to the office of judges, etc., in the\r\nUnited States Circuit and District Courts.\r\n\r\n_#The Department of Agriculture.#_--The Department of Agriculture was\r\norganized as a separate department in the year 1862. In 1889 its head\r\nbecame a cabinet officer. There is one Assistant Secretary. The duties\r\nof the Secretary are to promote in every way the agricultural interests\r\nof the country. For this purpose the department is separated into\r\nthirteen bureaus, under the following officers (1) the Entomologist, (2)\r\nChief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, (3) Chemist, (4) Botanist, (5)\r\nChief of the Section of Vegetable Pathology, (6) Statistician, (7)\r\nOrnithologist, (8) Director of the Office of Experiment Stations, (9)\r\nMicroscopist, (10) Pomologist, (11) Chief of the Forestry Division, (12)\r\nChief of the Seed Division, and (13) Weather Bureau. The enumeration of\r\nthese titles indicates the general nature of the work of the department.\r\nHere are investigated the habits of injurious insects and birds and the\r\nbest means for their destruction; the causes of and remedies for\r\nvegetable and fruit diseases. The Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry\r\ninspects herds of cattle and causes to be slaughtered those suffering\r\nfrom a contagious disease. Under a law passed in 1890, he also inspects\r\nall cattle and meat intended for export to foreign countries. He\r\ninvestigates causes of and remedies for cattle diseases, the best method\r\nof breeding, etc. The Statistician publishes monthly and annual reports\r\nconcerning statistics of the condition, prospects and harvests of the\r\nprincipal crops, the wages of farm labor, etc. The Chemist analyzes\r\nfertilizers, soils, etc. By the act of March 2, 1887, $15,000 per annum\r\nwas appropriated by Congress to each of the States and Territories which\r\nhave established an agricultural college or an agricultural college\r\ndepartment, for the establishment of experiment stations. The Department\r\nof Agriculture has general oversight over these stations.\r\n\r\nThe Department carries on experiments regarding the feasibility of\r\nprofitable silk reeling in this country, for which purpose there is a\r\nseparate division; it also makes experiments in the manufacture of sugar\r\nfrom sorghum and from beets grown in this country. The best qualities of\r\nseeds are tested and distributed gratuitously among the farmers. Efforts\r\nare made to introduce and foster the cultivation of new kinds of\r\nagricultural products, and in various ways to advance agricultural\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\nCongress, by an act passed during its last session, 1890, created a\r\nweather bureau under the Agricultural Department and transferred to it\r\nthe business of weather prognostication which had been tinder the Chief\r\nSignal officer in the War Department. The service remains unchanged. It\r\nhas stations at the military stations in the interior of the continent,\r\nat life-saving stations, and at other points in the States and\r\nTerritories. Meteorological observations are taken at each station, and\r\nthe information forwarded to the central office at Washington, where\r\nweather predictions for the succeeding day or days are made. The\r\npredictions are given gratuitously to the public through a system of\r\nflag signals, by the distribution of weather maps, and by publication in\r\nthe daily papers. The percentage of successful forecasts of the weather\r\nduring 1890 was 84.4.\r\n\r\nThe Department publishes the result of the scientific investigations\r\ncarried on by its officers in \"Annual Reports\" of the Secretary and\r\nChiefs of Divisions; in a series of \"Circulars\" on special subjects, in\r\nregular \"Bulletins;\" and in a series of studies on \"Insect Life.\" These\r\ndocuments are distributed gratuitously.\r\n\r\n_#The Department of Labor.#_--The Department of Labor was created in\r\n1884, as a bureau under the Interior Department. In 1888, it became a\r\nseparate department. It is a purely statistical bureau. It collects and\r\npublishes statistics on the cost of production, on wages, labor\r\nstatistics, etc. Its six published reports are on (1) Industrial\r\nDepressions, (2) Convict Labor, (3) Strikes and Lockouts, (4) Working\r\nWomen in Large Cities, (5) Marriage and Divorce, and (6) Railroad\r\nEmployés.\r\n\r\nHad all the executive departments been created at one time by a\r\nconstitutional convention, we should be justified in expecting a greater\r\nsymmetry and uniformity in the naming and grouping of chief officials.\r\nAn inspection of the various executive officers shows that not a few are\r\nunder departments other than would be expected; and the naming of\r\nofficials is often misleading as to their importance. Within recent\r\nyears there has appeared a strong tendency to depart yet more from a\r\nsystematic grouping of executive duties under departments. Executive\r\nfunctions have been given to bodies entirely independent of the\r\ndepartments. To complete our survey of the federal executive we must\r\nconsider the following: (1) the Interstate Commerce Commission, (2) the\r\nFish Commission, (3) the Civil Service Commission, (4) the Government\r\nPrinting Office, (5) the National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, the\r\nBureau of Ethnology, (6) the Congressional Library.\r\n\r\n_#The Interstate Commerce Commission.#_--With the growth of our railroad\r\nsystem have come various abuses. Roads have discriminated in favor of\r\none shipper over others, and of one locality over others. Combinations\r\nhave been formed to keep up railroad passenger and freight charges.\r\nTheir influence has been used in political offices through the issuing\r\nof free passenger tickets, etc. Various other minor abuses have centered\r\naround these corporations. The States have been powerless to provide a\r\nremedy for the roads have been mostly engaged in interstate commerce\r\nwith which the States are forbidden by the constitution to interfere. To\r\nprovide a remedy for the principal of these abuses Congress passed the\r\nact of February 4, 1887, regulating the practice of railroads and\r\ncreating the Interstate Commerce Commission to enforce the provisions.\r\nThe Commission is composed of five commissioners appointed by the\r\nPresident. The Commission sits as a court and adjudicates complaints\r\narising between railroads or between citizens and railroads, involving\r\nprinciples covered by the act. It has rapidly attained its present\r\nposition as one of the most important courts in the United States. A\r\nstatistician, attached to the Commission, publishes annual statistics of\r\nrailroads, covering the extent, the amount, and value of their stock and\r\nbonds, expenses of management, receipts, &c. The act, of course,\r\napplies only to those railroads lying in more than one State.\r\n\r\n_#The Fish Commission.#_--The Fish Commission was created by act of\r\nCongress in 1870. Its chief is the Commissioner of Fish and Fisheries.\r\nThere is also an Assistant Commissioner. This Commission stands in the\r\nsame relation to the fishery interests of the country as does the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture to agricultural interests. Both are scientific\r\nand practical departments. The former investigates the food, habits and\r\nenemies of fishes; experiments concerning the best methods of their\r\ncapture, the best kind of baits, apparatus, etc. It collects statistics\r\nof fish and fisheries of the whole country. Probably its most important\r\nservice is the propagation and distribution of food fishes. Under its\r\ndirection are hatched and liberated millions of the young of the best\r\nfood fishes in the various inland waters of the United States. Rivers\r\nsuitable for black bass, shad, carp, or other food fishes, but not\r\nhaving them in their waters, are supplied. For these purposes the\r\nCommission owns and manages various fish hatcheries, fish distributing\r\nvessels and cars, propagating ponds, etc.\r\n\r\nThe yearly appropriation for carrying on this work amounts to nearly a\r\nquarter of a million of dollars.\r\n\r\n_#The Civil Service Commission.#_--To correct the wasteful and\r\ndemoralizing spoils system, in vogue ever since the first administration\r\nof Jackson, Congress passed, January 16, 1883, \"an act to regulate and\r\nimprove the Civil Service of the United States.\" Under the provisions of\r\nthis act, the President appoints three commissioners, only two of whom\r\nmay be of the same political party, to administer the act. It is one of\r\nthe duties of this Commission to provide examinations for testing the\r\nfitness of applicants for public service. Appointments in those branches\r\nof the government coming under this act can only be made from persons\r\nwho have passed the civil service examination successfully. Adherence to\r\none or the other political parties has little weight in the selection\r\nof employés. Under the regulation of this act are: the nine executive\r\ndepartments at Washington, the Civil Service Commission itself, the\r\ncustoms districts, eleven in number, in each of which there are fifty or\r\nmore employés, all postoffices in which there are fifty or more\r\nemployés, and the Railway Mail Service; including altogether about\r\n28,500 clerks.\r\n\r\n_#The Government Printing Office.#_--In order that there may be\r\nintelligent legislation and administration, an extensive system of\r\nreports is required. The publications of the federal government are of\r\ncourse very numerous. Each department, bureau, and division makes an\r\nannual report. The proceedings of Congress are reported verbatim and\r\npublished. This printing and binding are done by the government through\r\nthe government printing office, established for that purpose. The Bureau\r\nof Printing and Engraving, which is under the Treasury Department, does\r\nno part of this. Its duties are limited to those of engraving and\r\nprinting banknotes, etc. The chief of the Government Printing Office is\r\nstyled the Government Printer, and is appointed by the President.\r\n\r\n_#The National Museum, Smithsonian Institution and Bureau of\r\nEthnology.#_--In 1829 James Smithson, bequeathed by his will the whole\r\nof his property, something over half a million dollars, \"to the United\r\nStates of America to found at Washington, under the name of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion\r\nof knowledge among men.\" This fund held by the United States now amounts\r\nto $702,000 yielding six per cent, per annum. In 1846 Congress\r\ndetermined to devote this gift of Smithson to the founding and support\r\nof a museum. The National Museum was established in 1846, and is\r\nsupported by annual appropriations by Congress.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 Congress created a special bureau under the Secretary of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, to be called the Bureau of Ethnology, to make\r\nresearches in North American anthropology. This work is supported by\r\nannual appropriations. The National Museum, Smithsonian Institution and\r\nBureau of Ethnology, though distinct institutions[1] are under\r\nsubstantially the same management. Their reports are of great scientific\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n_#The Librarian of Congress.#_--The Librarian of Congress is an\r\nindependent officer and reports directly to Congress. He has complete\r\ncontrol of the Congressional Library, now situated in the Capitol\r\nbuilding. The books now collected in this library have been purchased\r\nfrom time to time by Congress. There is a law requiring that two copies\r\nof every book, pamphlet, newspaper, photograph, etc., copyrighted in the\r\nUnited States, shall be sent to the Congressional Library. It thus\r\nreceives large and valuable additions yearly. The Library now numbers\r\nover half a million volumes. A new building for the library is in\r\nprocess of construction, and it will have cost when completed between\r\nseven and eight million dollars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A valuable and suggestive paper on The Origin of the\r\nNational Scientific and Educational Institutions of the United States,\r\nby Dr. G. Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, was published by the American Historical Association. Vol.\r\nIV, Part 2. G.P. Putnam's Sons, New York, 1890.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Judiciary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn forming the Constitution the framers of our government were\r\ncontrolled by the principle that the powers which belong to all\r\ngovernments can be most safely and satisfactorily exercised by dividing\r\nthem according to their nature among three separate branches, the\r\nexecutive, the legislative, and the judicial. Under the Articles of\r\nConfederation this maxim of government had been disregarded. The old\r\nContinental Congress had been given under that plan, not only\r\nlegislative powers, but also those executive and judicial powers which\r\nthe States had yielded to the central government.\r\n\r\nThe lack of a Federal judiciary was, as Justice Story says, \"one of the\r\nvital defects of the old confederation.\" Hamilton, the expounder of the\r\nConstitution, said: \"Laws are a dead letter without courts to enforce\r\nand apply them.\"\r\n\r\nThe reasons why a national system of courts was necessary were in order\r\nthat there might be some power:--\r\n\r\n1. To give to laws an interpretation that would be uniform throughout\r\nthe land. If there were thirteen independent courts, each giving Federal\r\ndecisions on the same causes arising under the same national laws, what\r\nbut confusion and contradiction could arise?\r\n\r\n2. To settle disputes between the States and citizens of different\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n3. To construe and interpret the Constitution itself, and decide all\r\ndisputes arising under it act of either Congress or of a State\r\nlegislature contrary to the Constitution can therefore be valid. Hence,\r\nthe necessity of some power which should have authority to determine the\r\nconstitutionality of an act when brought into question, and--\r\n\r\n5. There should be the power of determining the constitutionality of any\r\nact of a State legislature, and thus enforce upon State legislatures the\r\nrestrictions laid upon them, such as, for example, the inability to lay\r\nimpost duties, to pass laws violating the obligation of contracts, etc.,\r\nor to regulate objects given exclusively to Congress. The manifest\r\nnecessity of such a power may be best stated by using Hamilton's own\r\nwords (Federalist, 30):\r\n\r\n\"What would avail restrictions on the authority of the State\r\nlegislatures without some constitutional mode of enforcing the\r\nobservance of them? The States, by the plan of the Constitution, are\r\nprohibited from doing a variety of things, some of which are\r\nincompatible with the interests of the Union; others with the principles\r\nof good government. The imposition of duties on imported articles, and\r\nthe emission of paper money are specimens of this kind. No man of sense\r\nwill believe that such prohibition would be scrupulously regarded,\r\nwithout some effectual power in the government to restrain or correct\r\ninfractions of them. This power must be either a direct negative on the\r\nState laws, or an authority in the Federal courts to annul such as might\r\nbe in manifest contravention of the articles of Union.\" * * * \"These\r\ncourts are to be the bulwarks of a limited constitution against\r\nlegislative encroachments.\"\r\n\r\nThese reasons were so strong that there was little or no objection in\r\nthe constitutional convention to the creation of a national judiciary,\r\nbut difficulty arose in determining its precise nature and powers. As we\r\nhave learned, the difficulty to be overcome in drafting our new scheme\r\nof government was to satisfy State jealousies and interests, and\r\npreserve State rights of government, and yet to obtain a strong central\r\ngovernment; and to harmonize State rights with Federal strength.\r\n\r\nIn forming the national judiciary, the objects to be obtained, difficult\r\nof achievement, were, to use the words of Judge Curtis (Federal Courts\r\nof United States): \"To construct a judicial power within the Federal\r\nGovernment, and to clothe it with attributes which would enable it to\r\nsecure the supremacy of the general constitution and all of its\r\nprovisions; to give to it exact authority that would maintain the\r\ndividing line between the powers of the Nation and the States, and to\r\ngive to it no more: and to add to these a faculty of dispensing justice\r\nto foreigners, to citizens of different States and among the sovereign\r\nStates themselves, with a more even hand and with a more assured\r\ncertainty of the great ends of justice than any State power could\r\nfurnish--these were objects not readily or easily to be obtained, and\r\nyet they were obtained with wonderful success.\"\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the federal judiciary is given in a few words in\r\nthe Constitution: \"The judicial powers of the United States shall be\r\nvested in one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as Congress may\r\nfrom time to time ordain and establish.\"\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of this clause, Congress passed in 1789, what is known as\r\nthe \"Judiciary Act,\" the first section of which reads: \"The Supreme\r\nCourt of the United States shall consist of one chief justice and five\r\nassociate justices.\" This act also established the inferior federal\r\ncourts, the circuit and district courts, and also defined and fixed\r\ntheir fields of jurisdiction, i.e., the class of cases which these\r\ncourts could have power to try.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court stands at the head of our national judiciary. Its\r\nfield of jurisdiction is the construction and exposition of the\r\nConstitution of the United States. Hon. S.F. Miller, senior justice of\r\nthis court, speaking of the high character of the duties performed by\r\nthis court, said: \"This court, whether we take the character of the\r\nsuitors that are brought before it, or the importance of the subjects\r\nof litigation over which it has final jurisdiction, may be considered\r\nthe highest the world has ever seen. It has power to bring States before\r\nit, States which some of our politicians have been in the habit of\r\nconsidering sovereign, not only when they come voluntarily, but by\r\nFederal process they are subjected, in certain cases, to the judgment of\r\nthe court. Whatever these States may have been at the time of the\r\nformation of the Constitution, they now number their inhabitants by the\r\nmillions, and in wealth and civilization are equal to many of the\r\nindependent sovereignties of Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThere have been considerable changes in the structure and duties of the\r\nSupreme Court since its formation. At present there are nine justices,\r\ninstead of six. There is now one annual term of the court held,\r\nbeginning on the 2d Monday of October and continuing until about May 1.\r\nOf the nine justices six constitute a quorum.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court first met in February, 1790. Since its organization it\r\nhas had eight chief justices, in the following order.\r\n\r\n     John Jay, 1789-1795.\r\n     Oliver Ellsworth, 1795-1801.\r\n     John Marshall, 1801-1835.\r\n     R.B. Taney, 1836-1864.\r\n     S.P. Chase, 1864-1873.\r\n     M.R. Waite, 1873-1888.\r\n     M. Fuller, 1888.\r\n\r\nIn 1795 John Rutledge was appointed to succeed Jay, received his\r\ncommission, and held one term of the court, but was not confirmed by the\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\nDuring the early years of the existence of the Supreme Court few cases\r\narose requiring its jurisdiction. During the first term there was no\r\nbusiness to be transacted. In 1801 there were only ten cases on the\r\ndocket, and for some years the average annual number of cases was\r\ntwenty-four; but in later years the number rapidly increased. From 1850\r\nthe average number of cases decided was seventy-one, while from 1875 to\r\n1880 the average was three hundred and ninety-one per annum, and now\r\nthere are more than a thousand cases awaiting a hearing, and the court\r\nis so far behindhand in its work that it takes from three to four years\r\nfor a case to come up for trial after having been entered upon the\r\ndocket. At present there are about four hundred cases granted a hearing\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the adoption of the Constitution began\r\nstruggles and disputes between the States and the Federal Government. In\r\nthis contest the Supreme Court steadily upheld the central power, and\r\ndid much by its decisions to enforce and establish the power of the\r\nConstitution. Especially was the court powerful during the years 1801 to\r\n1835, when Marshall was chief justice, to whose wisdom and prudence it\r\nis difficult to ascribe too much influence in fixing the present\r\nstability of our government.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court has been an invariable supporter of the Federal\r\nConstitution. During the early years of our government it was our\r\nfirmest barrier against the efforts of the States to lessen the federal\r\npower. It has always maintained the balance of power between the States\r\nand the Union.\r\n\r\nThe annual term of the Supreme Court begins the second Monday of October\r\nand lasts until about May. Daily sessions, with the exceptions of\r\nSaturdays and Sundays, are held, beginning at 12 o'clock, in the Capitol\r\nbuilding at Washington. The present justices are Fuller, chief justice,\r\nand Lamar, Bradley, Field, Harlan, Gray, Blatchford and Brewer,\r\nassociate justices. Every Saturday morning the justices meet in\r\nconsultation and decide cases argued during the week. The decisions are\r\nannounced on Monday mornings. The justices are appointed by the\r\nPresident, hold office for life, and are removable only by impeachment.\r\n\r\nThe following are a few cases decided by the Supreme Court with which it\r\nis important that we should be acquainted owing to the influence which\r\ntheir decision has had upon our history:\r\n\r\n1. In 1793 the case of _Chisolm_ vs. _Georgia_ came before this court.\r\nChisolm, a citizen of North Carolina, sued the State of Georgia for a\r\nsum of money, and under the second section of Article III of the\r\nConstitution, which says that the judicial power of the United States\r\nshall extend to disputes between a State and citizens of another State,\r\nthe court gave judgment in his favor. This decision that a State\r\ngovernment could be sued against its will created so much\r\ndissatisfaction that the Eleventh Amendment was adopted, which says,\r\n\"the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to\r\nextend to any suit in law or equity commenced or prosecuted against one\r\nof the United States by citizens of another State, or by citizens or\r\nsubjects of any foreign State.\" The effect of this amendment has been to\r\nenable a State to repudiate its just debts.\r\n\r\n2. In 1819 was decided the very important case of _McCulloch_ vs.\r\n_Maryland_. The United States had established a national bank, which was\r\nobjectionable to many of the States. Maryland attempted to destroy the\r\nbank by levying a very high tax upon a branch bank within the State. The\r\nquestion as to her right to do this was brought before the Supreme\r\nCourt. To have allowed Maryland this right would have been to give to a\r\nState Government the power to oppose and render useless an institution\r\ncreated by the Federal Government. The court sustained the Federal\r\npower, and it was declared unconstitutional for any State to pass laws\r\nopposing the operation of any Federal statute.\r\n\r\n3. In the case of _Dartmouth College_ vs. _New Hampshire_ was declared\r\nthe unconstitutionally of a state law which impaired the obligation of\r\ncontracts.\r\n\r\n4. A very important case decided by Chief Justice Taney was that of\r\n_Dred Scott_ vs. _Sandford_ in 1857. Dred Scott, a negro slave in\r\nMissouri, had been carried into the Territory of Minnesota, where, by\r\nthe Missouri Compromise of 1820, slavery did not exist. Upon being\r\ncarried back into Missouri by his master, Scott claimed his freedom upon\r\nthe ground that he had been voluntarily carried into a Territory where\r\nslavery was not allowed. The Supreme Court in its decision declared that\r\nCongress had never had the power to pass any law which would forbid\r\nslave-owners settling in Territories and still retaining control of\r\ntheir slaves. The whole country was at this time in great excitement in\r\nregard to the question whether or not, in the organization of the\r\nTerritories of Kansas and Nebraska into States, slavery should be\r\nprohibited, and this decision, whereby the Missouri Compromise Act was\r\npractically annulled, and which pointed directly forward to an\r\nestablishment of slavery in the new Territories, raised public\r\nexcitement to a fever heat. It was in this decision that the statement\r\nwas made that at the time of the formation of the Constitution the\r\ngeneral opinion had been that the colored man had no rights which the\r\nwhite man was bound to respect. As a direct result of this case a more\r\ndetermined stand was taken at the North against slavery; the\r\nAnti-Slavery Republican party was strengthened, and their candidate for\r\nPresident, Abraham Lincoln, elected in 1861, and the catastrophe of\r\ncivil war precipitated.\r\n\r\n5. The Legal-Tender decisions, given in several cases soon after the\r\ncivil war, are important. During the progress of the war the Government,\r\nin order to raise funds to meet its extraordinary expenses, had been\r\nforced to issue slips of paper which represented no deposits of coin in\r\nthe Treasury, but only promises to pay certain sums by the Government.\r\nThese were declared legal tender, that is, made by law as good as gold\r\nand silver, and the people were forced to receive them in payment of\r\ndebts and for commodities. It was questioned whether the Government had\r\nby the Constitution power to do this. The legal-tender decisions\r\ndeclared that it had. Judicial System and Jurisdiction of the United\r\nStates Courts.\r\n\r\n_#District Courts.#_--The United States is divided into judicial\r\ndistricts. Many single States form a judicial district, while others are\r\ndivided into two and others into three districts. The number of\r\ndistricts has varied. At present there are about sixty. To each of these\r\ndistricts is given a court and a district judge. These form the lowest\r\ngrade of Federal courts.\r\n\r\n_#Circuit Courts.#_--These judicial districts are grouped into nine\r\ncircuits. For example, the Fourth circuit includes the districts of\r\nMaryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.\r\nFor each circuit is appointed one circuit judge. One of the justices of\r\nthe Supreme Court is also allotted to each of the circuits, who, after\r\nthe expiration of the Supreme Court term, visits his circuit, and tries\r\nthe more important cases which may arise in that circuit. The Circuit\r\nCourt may be held by the circuit judge, the Supreme Court justice, or\r\nthe district judge of that district in which the court is sitting, or by\r\nany two of them, or all of them, sitting together. The Circuit Courts\r\nform the next series of the Federal courts higher than the District\r\nCourts.\r\n\r\n_#Jurisdiction.#_--The relation between the Supreme, Circuit and\r\nDistrict courts is easy to explain. Their jurisdiction is upon federal\r\nquestions; that is, over those cases mentioned in the Constitution over\r\nwhich judicial power has been granted to the United States, viz.,\r\nquestions arising under the Constitution, federal laws, or treaties,\r\nbetween citizens of different States, between citizens and foreigners,\r\nbetween States themselves, etc., and all crimes punishable under the\r\nUnited States laws.\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court is higher than the District Court, and to it cases\r\ninvolving $500 and over may be appealed from the District courts. The\r\nSupreme Court is the court of last resort, and to it all appeals from\r\nthe Circuit Courts come, with the limitation that $5,000 be involved.\r\nThe cases decided by the Supreme Court are then of two classes: (1)\r\nthose over which it has original jurisdiction, (see Constitution); i.e.,\r\nthose cases which originate or begin in that court; and (2) those cases\r\nover which it has appellate jurisdiction, i.e., those cases which come\r\nthither by appeal from the lower Circuit Courts, and which form the\r\nlarger part of its work, and also by appeal from the highest State\r\ncourts in cases involving certain Federal questions. The District of\r\nColumbia being directly governed by the United States, its courts are\r\nFederal courts, and hence, cases may be appealed from such courts to the\r\nSupreme Court; likewise for the same reason appeals may be had to the\r\nSupreme Court from the territorial courts.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that these courts deal only with Federal questions\r\narising under United States laws, and, that besides these courts, all of\r\nthe States have their own judicial systems of courts to interpret state\r\nlaws and to try the great majority of cases. These courts are entirely\r\nseparate from the United States courts, and with different judges,\r\nthough cases may begin in them and be transferred to the United States\r\nCourts, if the interpretation of a Federal law is brought into question.\r\n\r\nThere are four grades of law in the United States. First and highest is\r\nthe United States Constitution; second, United States laws, or statutes\r\nas they are called, passed by Congress; third, State constitutions; and\r\nfourth, State laws, passed by the State legislatures. In case of\r\nconflict of laws the lower must yield to the higher.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of settling claims of private persons against the United\r\nStates, there has been established at Washington a Court of Claims, held\r\nby five judges. From it appeals lie, in some cases, to the Supreme\r\nCourt, and, in others, they are referred to Congress for action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nThe Ordinance for the Government of the Northwest Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the colonies joined in union under the Articles of Confederation,\r\nin 1781, they ceded to the General government their claims to unoccupied\r\nwestern territory. The largest land grant was that by the State of\r\nVirginia, which occupied that part of the United States lying north of\r\nthe Ohio River and east of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nThe problem of management of public lands was thus early presented to\r\nour Federal Government for solution. The manner in which Congress dealt\r\nwith this question has proven eminently wise and successful, and has\r\nbeen largely influential in making the United States the nation that it\r\nis to-day. The feature that has characterized the plan followed from the\r\nbeginning, and which still obtains, is the formation of States from such\r\nterritory as soon as there is sufficient population. Such States have\r\nsimilar forms and powers of government as the original States, are on an\r\nequal footing with them, and are bound by the Constitution of the United\r\nStates. Congress has absolute control of the Territories. (For\r\nTerritorial government see Article on Territories.)\r\n\r\nThe ordinance which the Continental Congress adopted in 1787 for the\r\ngovernment of the Northwest Territory is of great importance: it\r\nprovides for the establishment of our territorial system; it contains\r\nmany of those features of management which have been used from that date\r\nuntil now; and it is also of interest because of the influence it has\r\nhad upon the history of slavery in our country.\r\n\r\nThis ordinance provided that the whole of this territory should form one\r\ndistrict. At first Congress appointed the governor, secretary, judges,\r\nand military generals. The governor was to make the laws, subject to the\r\napproval of Congress. When the population reached five thousand the\r\ninhabitants were to have a legislature of their own, and to have a\r\ndelegate who should sit in Congress, but have no vote. There was a bill\r\nof rights. Public education was encouraged. Not less than three nor more\r\nthan five States were to be formed from it. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, and Wisconsin have been the five States formed from this\r\nterritory. The transformation of the territory into States was promised\r\nas soon as the population should reach sixty thousand.\r\n\r\nSlavery was forever prohibited in all this territory. We shall see the\r\ntremendous importance of this clause, which guaranteed to this large\r\ntract freedom from the curse of slavery, when we come to consider the\r\nstruggles which were made for many years to keep slavery from the\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nGovernment of the Territories.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are at present four areas, situated outside of the States, and\r\norganized under territorial governments. These are Utah, Arizona, New\r\nMexico and Oklahoma. Besides these there are the two unorganized\r\nterritories, Indian Territory, and Alaska, and the District of Columbia,\r\nwhich last tract contains sixty-four square miles.\r\n\r\n_#Government of Territories.#_--The fundamental law of a Territory is\r\nthe Federal Constitution, just as in a State. Unlike the State, however,\r\nit has no constitution of its own, but is regulated entirely by\r\nCongress. In Section 3, Article IV, of the Constitution, it is declared\r\nthat \"Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all needful\r\nregulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the\r\nUnited States.\" In pursuance of this clause Congress has in the four\r\norganized Territories instituted governments as follows: The executive\r\nof the Territory is a Governor appointed by the President for a four\r\nyears' term. There is also a secretary and treasurer. The legislature\r\nconsists of two houses, a council of 12, and a House of Representatives\r\nof 24. These are elected by the people of the Territories, and have a\r\nterm of two years. The Legislature meets every other year. All its acts\r\nrequire approval by Congress before becoming law.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary consists of three or more judges appointed by the\r\nPresident, together with a district attorney and United States marshal.\r\n\r\nTerritories send neither Senators nor Representatives to Congress, but\r\nhave one delegate apiece in the United States House of Representatives,\r\nwho may speak, but not vote.\r\n\r\n_#Admission of a Territory as a State.#_--A Territory is an embryo\r\nState. As soon as a Territory becomes sufficiently populated it applies\r\nfor admission into the Union as a State, and such admission is\r\naccomplished in the following manner. When an application by a Territory\r\nfor Statehood is made, it is considered by Congress, and, if approved,\r\nthe inhabitants of the Territory are authorized to form for themselves\r\nout of such Territory a State government, and thus prepare themselves\r\nfor admission into the Union.\r\n\r\nA State government is formed as follows: The Governor of the Territory\r\nissues a proclamation declaring that on a certain date there shall be an\r\nelection of delegates to a convention; such convention is to be held on\r\na certain date. These delegates are elected by a popular vote. The\r\nmembers of the convention thus formed declare that they, on behalf of\r\nthe people of the Territory, adopt the Constitution of the United\r\nStates, and then proceed to draft a State constitution and government.\r\nIt is provided that this constitution shall be Republican in form, and\r\nmake no distinction in civil and political rights on account of race or\r\ncolor, except for Indians not taxed: that it shall not be repugnant to\r\nthe Constitution of the United States and the principles of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence. Perfect religious toleration must be\r\nguaranteed, all right or title to the unappropriated public lands lying\r\nwithin the Territory must be disclaimed and given over to the United\r\nStates. Provision must be made by the constitution for the establishment\r\nand maintenance of the system of public schools.\r\n\r\nAfter adoption by the convention the constitution is offered to the\r\npeople for ratification. If it is ratified, the Governor certifies the\r\nfact to the President of the United States. Provided the constitution is\r\nfound to comply with all the conditions just mentioned, the President\r\nissues his proclamation declaring the ratification of the constitution,\r\nand upon the same day that the proclamation is issued the territory is\r\ndeemed admitted by Congress into the Union as a State, on an equal\r\nfooting with the original States, and entitled to representation in both\r\nhouses of the Federal Congress. The representatives and the Governor and\r\nother State officers are elected on the same day as that upon which the\r\nconstitution is ratified by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nState Governments.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States is a nation of forty-four federated States. Each State\r\nhas its own separate government, which is sovereign, except as to a few\r\npowers which have been granted to the United States government for\r\ngeneral purposes. Citizens of States are also citizens of the United\r\nStates, and thus owe a double allegiance, namely, to the State in which\r\nthey reside and to the United States.\r\n\r\nThese States vary in size from that of Texas, the largest, with an area\r\nof 265,780 square miles, to that of Rhode Island, the smallest, with\r\n1,250; and in population from that of New York, with nearly six\r\nmillions, to that of Nevada, with about forty-five thousand. The largest\r\nState is greater than either France or the German Empire.\r\n\r\nState governments are older than the Federal government, for it was by a\r\ngrant by the States of certain of their powers that the United States\r\ngovernment was created. Each State is represented in Congress by two\r\nmembers in the Senate. Members of the lower branch of the Federal\r\nlegislature are apportioned among the States according to population. As\r\nin the case of the United States, the powers of government are divided\r\namong three departments--the executive, legislative, and judicial.\r\n\r\nIn the United States Constitution it is expressly declared that \"the\r\npowers not granted to the United States by the Constitution, nor\r\nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively,\r\nor to the people.\" It would require considerable space to enumerate the\r\nduties of State governments. With the exception of the few acts which\r\nthe constitution forbids them to perform, most of which they would not\r\ncare to perform if allowed, and the few general powers coming within the\r\nprovince of the Federal Government, the States can do whatever their\r\nlegislatures sanction. They can go to the extremes of State socialism.\r\nAll States have a complete judicial system. They regulate all legal\r\nrelations of their citizens, the laws of husband and wife, principal and\r\nagent, and of contract. They provide for the detection and punishment of\r\ncrime. They control and mainly support the militia of the county.\r\nRailroad, banking, insurance, and other corporations, are chartered and\r\ncontrolled by them. The construction and maintenance of roads, the care\r\nof the public health, the inspection of factories, the determination of\r\nthe right of suffrage, and the control of its own elections are among\r\nthe exclusive powers of State governments. Our extensive system of\r\npublic schools are under the dual management of the State and local\r\ngovernments, and under the superintendence of State officers. The State\r\ntakes care of the defective classes, of the insane, paupers, etc.; and,\r\nin general, performs all those ordinary duties concerning internal\r\naffairs which are exercised by central governments.\r\n\r\n    Each State government has--\r\n\r\n    1. A Constitution.\r\n\r\n    2. A Legislature of two Houses.\r\n\r\n    3. An executive, composed of a Governor, Lieutenant-Governor (in\r\n    almost all cases), Secretary of State, Auditor, and a few other\r\n    officers.\r\n\r\n    4. A system of local government in counties, towns, cities, etc.\r\n\r\n    5. A body of State laws.\r\n\r\n    6. A judicial system of courts, from which no appeal can be had to\r\n    United States courts, except upon Federal questions.\r\n\r\n    7. A system of local taxation.\r\n\r\n    Each State government has all the rights usually pertaining to a\r\n    sovereign State, except--Those powers which the Federal\r\n    Constitution expressly forbids to the States.\r\n\r\n    3. Those powers which have in the Constitution been exclusively\r\n    given to the United States.\r\n\r\nAll States have public debts, which they may, and sometimes do,\r\nrepudiate. They can be sued only by other States. The Eleventh Amendment\r\ndeclared that a citizen could not maintain a suit against a State. State\r\nlaws are binding only within the boundaries of the State enacting them.\r\n\r\n_#State Constitutions.#_--As the Federal Constitution is the supreme law\r\nof the United States, so the State constitution is the highest law of\r\nthe States. The Constitutions of the original thirteen States were\r\nnaturally formed after the model of the charters enjoyed by the New\r\nEngland colonies. In the colonies of Rhode Island, Connecticut, and\r\nMassachusetts their charters were adopted as constitutions without any\r\nchange, except, of course, the annulment of obedience to the English\r\nking. All subsequent constitutions have been closely modeled after these\r\nfirst thirteen. The Federal Constitution provides that all State\r\nconstitutions must be Republican in form. (For other conditions of\r\nadmission of territories as States, see subject \"Territories.\") The\r\nmodes of amendment of constitutions differ in different States, but in\r\nall, amendment is much easier of accomplishment than in the case of the\r\nFederal Constitution. This is shown by the fact that since 1776 there\r\nhave been adopted by the States one hundred and five complete\r\nconstitutions, and two hundred and fourteen partial amendments; while,\r\nsince the passage of the first ten Federal amendments in 1789, there\r\nhave been but five additional amendments. Some States provide that the\r\nconstitution shall be submitted to the people for amendment at the end\r\nof certain intervals of time. In the larger number of cases a majority\r\nof the popular vote is required for ratification of a constitutional\r\namendment. State constitutions show a tendency to become longer, and to\r\nregulate a constantly increasing number of subjects.\r\n\r\n    A normal State constitution has the following provisions:\r\n\r\n    1. A definition of the State boundaries.\r\n\r\n    2. A bill of rights (guaranteeing private rights, such as freedom of\r\n    the press and speech, trial by jury in criminal cases, right to\r\n    assemble and petition, etc.).\r\n\r\n    3. A frame of government, an enumeration of officers and powers of\r\n    legislature, executive, courts of justice, etc.\r\n\r\n    4. Miscellaneous provisions, relating to administration of schools,\r\n    militia, taxation, debts, local government, corporations,\r\n    amendments, etc.\r\n\r\n_#State Legislatures.#_--The legislature in all States consists of two\r\nHouses, of which the upper and smaller branch is called the Senate, and\r\nthe lower and more numerous branch usually the House of Representatives,\r\nthough in six States it is termed the Assembly, and in three the House\r\nof Delegates. The members of both houses are elected by popular vote,\r\nbut Senators usually for a longer time, and frequently higher\r\nqualifications for them are required. States are divided into districts\r\nfor election purposes, and, though members of the legislature may offer\r\nthemselves for election from any district, it has become the invariable\r\ncustom for them to be elected only from the districts in which they\r\nreside. Universal manhood suffrage, that is, the right of all male\r\ncitizens over 21 years of age to vote, is the rule, though in eight\r\nStates paupers have no vote, and in a few, a certain amount of education\r\nis required (generally enough to read the State constitution). The\r\nnumber of members in the State legislatures varies greatly. In the\r\nSenate, Delaware has the smallest number (9), and Illinois the largest\r\n(51). In the lower House, Delaware has likewise the smallest number\r\n(21), while New Hampshire has the greatest (321).\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor of the State is _ex officio_ President of the\r\nSenate. In all States, except six, sessions of the legislature are held\r\nonly once every other year, and even then the length of the session is\r\nlimited to a fixed number of days. As in Congress, business is conducted\r\nby means of committees, but are in both Houses elected by ballot. The\r\nState legislatures have full charge and control of all local\r\ngovernments within their individual States. The Senate has the power of\r\ntrying impeachments of State officials. It also ratifies appointments of\r\nthe Governor. In all States, except four, acts of the legislature\r\nrequire the signature of the Governor before they become laws. To pass a\r\nbill over a veto requires in twenty-three States a two-thirds vote in\r\nboth Houses; in two, a three-fifths vote, and in nine, a majority vote\r\nof the total number of members. A State legislature can enact no law\r\nwhich will be effective beyond its own boundaries.\r\n\r\n_#State Executive.#_--The chief executive of the State is the Governor.\r\nOther chief officials are the Lieutenant-Governor, Treasurer, Attorney\r\nGeneral, Secretary of State, Auditor, and Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction. The term of office of the Governor varies in different\r\nStates from one to four years. He has but small powers of appointment,\r\nmost of the State officials being elected by the people. In all but four\r\nStates he has a veto on legislation. He has the power of pardoning. The\r\nLieutenant-Governor is President of the Senate.\r\n\r\n_#State Judiciary.#_--The State judiciary includes three sets of courts:\r\n\r\n    1. A Supreme Court of Appeals, the highest court, from which cases\r\n    involving Federal questions may be appealed to the Supreme Court of\r\n    the United States.\r\n\r\n    2. Superior courts of record.\r\n\r\n    3. Various local courts, such as county courts, corporation courts,\r\n    etc.\r\n\r\nEach State recognizes the judgments of other States, and gives credit to\r\ntheir public acts and records, and delivers up to justice, on demand of\r\nthe executive, any criminal fleeing from other States into her borders.\r\nIn most of the States the judges are elected by the people, though in\r\neight they are appointed by the Governor, and in five by the\r\nlegislature. The Attorney-General conducts cases in which the State is a\r\nparty, and manages other legal business in which the State is\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nLocal Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Government we learned that the people of the United\r\nStates owe allegiance to two systems of government; the one a central\r\nnational government, the other the state governments. We have now to\r\nmention a third system of governments, namely, local governments; for\r\ncitizens of the United States live, in reality, under three distinct\r\ngovernments: first and highest, the National United States Government;\r\nsecond, State governments, and third, local governments. It is\r\nconcerning local governments in the United States that we shall learn in\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nJust as the whole United States is divided into forty-eight sections,\r\neach section being a State or Territory, so each State is in turn, for\r\nconvenience in the administration of its government, divided into small\r\nlocal areas, each division managing those affairs which appertain to its\r\nown area. Many of these divisions were not formed by dividing up the\r\nStates. The divisions came first, or sprang up naturally within the\r\nStates as soon as the colonies were settled. Social governments were the\r\nfirst governments formed in the settlement of our Western territory. Dr.\r\nEdward Bemis has described the beginnings of government in a new State\r\nin the following interesting manner:\r\n\r\n\"The genesis of local government in Western hamlets is very simple.\r\nFirst comes the settler who, ax in hand, clears the ground for his\r\nhumble dwelling, and plants whatever seed he has brought with him. Then\r\ncomes another settler and another until perhaps a dozen families are\r\nestablished near. Two wants are now felt: roads, or at least paths from\r\nhouse to house, from hamlet to market town, and a school-house for the\r\nmultiplying children. There is no strong central authority to provide\r\nthese things, but the settlers meet and vote to tax themselves. The\r\nservices of a supervisor, collector, clerk, constable and justice of the\r\npeace are required.\"[1] This is the beginning of the township and\r\ncounty. As population increases, other wants arise which only a stronger\r\ngovernment can supply. A territorial, and then a State government are\r\nconsequently formed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Local Government in Michigan and the Northwest. _J.H.U.\r\nStudies in History and Political Science._ Vol. I, No. 5, p. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe principal duties of local governments are those of education,\r\npolice, sanitation, charity, the construction and maintenance of public\r\nroads, the administration of justice, the assessment and collection of\r\ntaxes, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are three types of local government in the United States: First,\r\nthe New England type, in which the unit of government is the town or\r\ntownship; second, the Southern type, in which the unit is the county;\r\nand third, the Western system, in which the New England and Southern\r\nsystems are combined.\r\n\r\n_#1st. Local Government New England.#_--Here the unit of government is\r\nthe township, or town, as it is usually called. There are few towns\r\nexceeding five square miles in area, and the population is generally\r\nless than 3,000. The New England township is therefore not a thickly\r\nsettled area. When a town becomes closely settled it is incorporated as\r\na city.\r\n\r\nIn the New England towns the people govern themselves directly. In the\r\nState and Federal governments the people are governed not by themselves,\r\nbut through representatives chosen by themselves. The town or township\r\nform of government is that of a pure democracy; the States and Federal\r\ngovernments are representative governments or republics.\r\n\r\nThe supreme governing power of a town is in the town meeting, composed\r\nof all qualified voters of the town. The town meeting is held in the\r\nSpring of each year. After the choice of a Moderator, officers are\r\nelected for the ensuing year, reports of officers for the past year\r\nread, and the amount of taxes to be raised and expenditures to be made\r\nduring the year, determined upon. The officers are the Selectmen, three,\r\nfive, seven or nine in number, who constitute the executive officers of\r\nthe town, and administer the ordinances passed by the town meeting; a\r\ntown clerk, who keeps a record of the proceedings of the town meeting,\r\nand a record of births, deaths, marriages, etc.; a treasurer, assessors\r\nand collectors of taxes, constables, and various other petty officers.\r\nSeveral offices are frequently given to the same individual.\r\n\r\nThe county also exists in New England, and is formed by the union of\r\nseveral towns, but it is of very little importance, and has but few\r\nduties. The township system is found in the Middle States, but in a\r\nmodified form. It is less democratic as a rule--officers being elected\r\nby ballot, the town meeting generally absent, and county government more\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n_#2d. Local Government in the South.#_--Here the town (township) does\r\nnot exist, except in a few instances. The unit of government for\r\nperforming local duties is the county, which is much larger than the New\r\nEngland townships. The county government is managed by a Board of County\r\nCommissioners. These are elected not in open meeting as are the town\r\nofficers, but by ballot. County government is therefore a representative\r\nor republican government. The county, wherever found, is primarily a\r\njudicial district. The chief officer for executing the decrees of the\r\ncounty judiciary is the sheriff. Other county officers are the\r\ntreasurer, assessor, etc.\r\n\r\n_#Local Government in the West.#_--Here, as before stated, we find the New\r\nEngland and the Southern systems combined, but combined in different\r\nStates in such various degrees as to make impracticable any attempt to\r\ndescribe them more particularly.[1] In consequence of the grants of land\r\nby the Federal Government to Western States for education, local areas\r\nfor the administration of these funds have been formed. These are called\r\nschool districts. Local government has tended to center around these\r\ndistricts, and they have in many cases become important administrative\r\ndistricts. Their boundaries coincide with the boundaries of the\r\ntownships and counties, though a number of school districts may be in\r\none county or township.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: More detailed accounts of the various systems of Local\r\nGovernment in the United States may be found in the early numbers of the\r\n_Johns Hopkins University Studies_, and also in Professor George E.\r\nHoward's _Local Constitutional History_, an extra volume in the same\r\nseries.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCity Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proportion of people in the United States who reside in cities is\r\nincreasing. In 1790 there were only thirteen cities of 5,000 inhabitants\r\nand none with 40,000. Now there are over 500 that have a population\r\nexceeding 5,000 and 28 with a population of 100,000. In 1790 33 per\r\ncent. of the total population lived in cities of over 8,000 inhabitants,\r\nwhile to-day over 25 per cent live in cities of this size or over.\r\n\r\nWhen any small area becomes thickly and permanently settled, and a\r\ncertain population is reached (which varies in different States), the\r\nstate legislature is appealed to, and a charter of incorporation as a\r\ncity is granted. This enables the incorporated district to act\r\nindependently of the county or township, to levy municipal taxes and\r\ncarry out public improvements. Rapid as has been the growth of cities,\r\nthe duties required of city governments have increased still faster.\r\n\r\nThe government of our large cities has become a question of vital\r\nimportance. It would be difficult to give a complete list of the duties\r\ndevolving upon them. The principal duties are (1) the collection of\r\nmunicipal and state taxes, (2) the establishment and care of public\r\nschools, (3) the administration of justice, (4) police supervision, (5)\r\nthe support of a fire department, (6) the care of the streets, (7) of\r\nstreet gas and electric lighting, (8) of sewerage, (9) of the water\r\nsupply, (10) of public parks, (11) of sanitation and public health, (12)\r\nof prisons, (13) the supervision of the liquor traffic, (14) the\r\nregulation of street railways, (15) the enforcement of building\r\nregulations, (16) the supervision of charities, hospitals, asylums,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe form of government of all our large cities is much the same. It is\r\nsubstantially a reproduction, in form, of the state governments. First,\r\nthere is a mayor, who is the chief executive, and is elected directly by\r\nthe people of the city. His term of office is sometimes only one year,\r\nthough more often two, three, or four years. In almost all cases he has\r\na veto on acts of the city legislature, which veto may, however, be\r\noverridden by a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nOther subordinate officials are, the treasurer, collector of taxes,\r\nchief of police, health officer, etc. They are in part elected by the\r\npeople, in part appointed by the mayor, or appointed by the city\r\nlegislature. Practice varies in different cities.\r\n\r\nCity legislatures are of one or two houses. The larger cities usually\r\nhave two houses, and the smaller cities one house.\r\n\r\nThe legislature is usually called the City Council, the upper branch the\r\nBoard of Aldermen, and the lower and more numerous branch, the Common\r\nCouncil. The members of the city council are elected by the people. The\r\nacts of the council are called ordinances. They are not sufficiently\r\ngeneral to merit the designation of laws.\r\n\r\nCity judges are usually elected by the people. The administration of the\r\nvarious duties of municipal government are generally given to special\r\nboards of officers, as the police department, fire department, etc. For\r\nelection purposes, cities are divided into wards, and the wards into\r\nvoting precincts.\r\n\r\nOur methods of municipal government have proved the least successful of\r\nany of our institutions. Corruption and grave abuses exist in almost\r\nevery one of the larger cities. Problems connected with city government\r\nare among the most important questions of our time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nGovernment Revenue and Expenditure.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment is an enormous business enterprise, maintained and operated\r\nby its citizens, that certain duties of a general interest and benefit\r\nmay be performed. The magnitude of the work performed necessarily\r\nrequires the expenditure of vast sums of money. The chief source from\r\nwhich these sums are derived is taxation. Taxes have been defined to be\r\n\"the legally determined and legally collected contributions of\r\nindividuals for meeting the necessary and general expenses of the\r\nState.\"[1] In the large majority of cases this is a good definition, but\r\nin a few instances it is too narrow. There are some taxes that are\r\nlevied not primarily for the purpose of raising an income to meet the\r\nexpenses of the government, but to subserve some other purpose. For\r\ninstance, the maintenance of our high duties on articles imported into\r\nthe United States from foreign countries has for its main purpose the\r\nprotection of our industries from European competition. The large\r\nrevenues that are derived therefrom are incidental. High liquor\r\nlicenses, also, are maintained for the express purpose of lessening the\r\nconsumption of intoxicating beverages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Carl Knies.]\r\n\r\nThe aim of every good government is to distribute its burdens of\r\ntaxation, as well as its benefits, fairly and equitably among its\r\ncitizens. It is the duty of every citizen to assist in the realization\r\nof this aim, by an intelligent, honest and disinterested vote. Equality\r\nof taxation means equality of sacrifice. Each person should contribute\r\ntowards the support of the government in proportion to his means and the\r\nbenefits enjoyed. It is the duty of every citizen, first to see that\r\njust and expedient tax laws are passed, then to pay his proper\r\nproportion, and lastly, to see that his neighbors likewise contribute\r\ntheir share. To obtain an equitable system of government revenue and\r\nexpenditure has been the great motive force which, in the past, has\r\nurged the people forward in their efforts to secure popular forms of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe power to tax is legislative, and, according to our theory, can be\r\nexercised only by representatives directly elected by the people. The\r\nrefusal of England in the last century to extend this principle of \"no\r\ntaxation without representation\" to her colonies in America, lost her\r\nthese possessions. A government to be stable and efficient must possess\r\nadequate powers for the collection of its revenue. The miserable\r\ncondition to which the old Confederation was reduced by reason of the\r\ninadequacy of its powers in this respect, has already been discussed.\r\nSays Fiske: \"Between the old Continental Congress and the government\r\nunder which we have lived since 1789, the differences were many; but by\r\nfar the most essential difference was that the new government could\r\nraise money by taxation, and was thus enabled properly to carry on the\r\nwork of governing.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Civil Government_, p. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe sources of government revenue other than taxes, are various, and\r\ndiffer in different countries. In our consideration of the revenues and\r\nexpenditures of our national, state, and local governments we shall have\r\noccasion to notice the various means by which their treasuries are\r\nfilled.\r\n\r\n_#The Federal Government#_ raises its revenues independently of the\r\nother governing bodies, from different sources, and by a different set\r\nof officials. Besides taxation, the principal source of revenue is from\r\nthe sale of public lands. Federal taxes are of two kinds:\r\n\r\n     1. Customs duties.\r\n\r\n     2. Excise or internal revenue duties.\r\n\r\nOf these, much the greater sum is raised from customs duties. For the\r\nyear 1889,[1] the total net receipts were $387,050,058. Of this\r\n$223,832,741 was derived from customs, and $130,894,434 from the\r\ninternal revenue duties. The sale of public lands yielded in that year\r\n$8,038,651. The miscellaneous revenues amounted to $24,297,151.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For fiscal purposes the year begins July 1st.]\r\n\r\nCustoms or tariff duties are taxes which have to be paid on a large\r\nclass of goods imported into this country from foreign countries. These\r\ncharges are collected by Government collectors, stationed in all our\r\nprincipal seaport cities, who inspect all incoming vessels and determine\r\nthe amount to be paid, according to the rate determined by Congress.\r\nThis system constitutes the so-called protective tariff policy of our\r\ncountry. Those commodities not so taxed are said to be on the \"free\r\nlist.\" How much, and on what articles these duties shall be levied, is\r\nthe question upon which the Republican and Democratic parties differ;\r\nthe former favoring high, and the latter low rates, that is to say\r\nmerely enough to support the Government, or, as it is termed, \"a tariff\r\nfor revenue only.\"\r\n\r\nInternal revenue duties are those taxes collected by the government from\r\nits own citizens upon a small class of articles produced in this\r\ncountry. The chief items of this class are distilled liquors, tobacco,\r\nand oleomargarine. In 1889, out of the $130,894,434 received from\r\ninternal revenue, there was derived from spirits and fermented liquor\r\n$98,036,041; tobacco, $31,866,861; oleomargarine and miscellaneous,\r\n$991,532. These duties are collected by Government collectors stationed\r\nin every United States district, who visit the distilleries, collect the\r\ntaxes, and see that the law is enforced. In several Southern States\r\nattempts to evade the law are very frequent and difficult of detection.\r\nThe expenses of the vast postal system conducted by the Federal\r\nGovernment are very nearly defrayed by the charges made for postage, and\r\nthe amount received by fees more than equals the expense of the Patent\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\n_#The State and Local Taxes#_ are generally, for convenience, collected\r\nat the same time, and by the same officials, but independently of the\r\nFederal government. The Constitution of the United States forbids the\r\nStates to derive a revenue from duty upon goods imported or exported.\r\nThe States are, therefore, for the most part, restricted to a direct tax\r\non property for the support of their governments.\r\n\r\nThe general method for raising this tax is as follows: The legislature\r\nof the State, having determined what income is needed, apportion this\r\nsum among the counties, or, in New England, directly among the\r\ntownships, in proportion to the value of the property situated within\r\nthem, or establish a certain percentage tax on all property, to be\r\ncollected in the same manner. So, similarly, the counties apportion\r\namong the cities and townships within their areas, in proportion to the\r\nvalue of their taxable property, not only what they have to pay to the\r\nState, but also the sums they have to raise for county purposes. Thus\r\nwhen the township or city authorities assess and collect taxes from the\r\nindividual citizens, they collect at one and the same time three\r\ndistinct taxes--the State tax, the county tax, and the city or township\r\ntax. Retaining the last for local purposes, they hand on the two former\r\nto the county authorities, who, in turn, retain the county tax, handing\r\non to the State what it requires. Thus trouble and expense are saved in\r\nthe process of collection, and the citizen sees on one tax paper all\r\nthat he has to pay. The chief tax is the property tax, based on a\r\nvaluation of property, and generally of all property, real and personal.\r\nOf this, by far the greater sum is realized from the tax on real\r\nproperty, (land and buildings on it). Cities and other local\r\nsubdivisions, as has been stated, are raising their revenues more and\r\nmore from the sale, taxation, or operation of such public franchises and\r\nrights as street-car lines, gas and waterworks. Those who fix the value\r\nof taxable property and thus determine the amount the owners are to pay,\r\nare called assessors. Those collecting taxes are called collectors. The\r\nrevenue of the States is seldom large in proportion to the wealth and\r\nnumber of the inhabitants, because the chief burden of administration is\r\nborne not by the States, but by the Federal government, on the one hand,\r\nand the local subdivisions of the States on the other. The total revenue\r\nof all the States is barely one-third that of the Federal government.\r\n\r\n_#The Expenditures#_ of all the governing bodies, Federal, State, and\r\nlocal, are kept entirely independent of each other. Those of the Federal\r\ngovernment are for the benefit of all the States, while those of the\r\nother bodies are only for their own individual benefit. The Federal\r\ngovernment receives much more than it expends, and has yearly a surplus\r\non hand in the Treasury. The States and local bodies have in the past\r\nexpended more than their revenues, making up their deficiency by loans\r\non their credit.\r\n\r\nThe chief objects of Federal expenditure (in addition to the postal\r\nsystem already considered and for the most part supported by its own\r\nrevenue) are: 1st, interest on the public debt; 2d, pensions to disabled\r\nsoldiers; 3d, for the support of the civil branch of the government;\r\n4th, war and naval expenditures.\r\n\r\nTotal expenditures for the year 1889 were $299,288,988. The chief items\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n     1. Interest on the public debt,     $41,000,484\r\n     2. Pensions,                         87,624,779\r\n     3. Civil service,                    80,664,064\r\n     4. War and Navy,                     65,815,079\r\n     5. Indians,                           6,892,207\r\n\r\nMoney can be expended by the government only after it has been\r\nappropriated by Congress in its annual appropriation bills. The\r\nappropriation of supplies by Congress is the most important business\r\nthat it transacts. Every year the heads of all the different departments\r\nframe estimates of the amounts of money needed to support their\r\ndepartments during the following year, which estimates they send to the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, who, after considering and revising them,\r\ntransmits them to Congress in his \"Annual Letter.\" This letter is\r\nconsidered by the Appropriation Committee, whose duty it is to consider\r\nand frame bills for the appropriation of moneys. Though guided by these\r\nestimates, supplies frequently depart widely from them. After being\r\nreported to the House and passed, money bills are sent to the Senate,\r\nwhere they are invariably amended by increasing the appropriations and\r\nare returned to the House. A conference committee is then appointed from\r\nthe House and Senate Committees on Appropriations, who, after mutual\r\nconcessions, agree upon such appropriations as will be passed by both\r\nhouses. The House then amends the bill as agreed upon, passes it, and\r\nsends it to the Senate again, which in turn passes it, and sends it to\r\nthe President for his signature. All bills for raising money must, by\r\nthe Constitution, originate in the House. Besides the appropriations for\r\nthe expenses of government there is annually authorized a large\r\nexpenditure for improvement of rivers and harbors. Many of the\r\nexpenditures authorized by these bills are undoubtedly unnecessary, but\r\nthey are passed by general consent of the members, each of whom desires\r\nto increase his popularity at home by getting public money spent in his\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the State governments are not heavy, and are devoted to\r\nbut few objects. The chief expenditures are for:--(1) the salaries of\r\nofficials; (2) judicial expenditures; (3) the State volunteer militia;\r\n(4) grants to public schools; (5) public charities and institutions, as\r\nprisons, insane asylums, etc., (6) interest on State debts; (7) internal\r\nimprovements and public buildings.\r\n\r\nThe methods of appropriations are similar to those employed by the\r\nFederal government.\r\n\r\nThe expenditures of the local bodies, and particularly cities, are much\r\nlarger, in proportion to their population, than those of the States, and\r\nare increasing at a greater rate than the increase of population. The\r\nobjects of expenditure are numerous and very important. The chief ones\r\nare: (1) Interest on local debts; (2) maintenance and care of the\r\nstreets and roads; (3) lighting of streets; (4) police; (5) salaries of\r\nofficials.\r\n\r\nThe following are outlines of the receipts and expenditures of the State\r\nof Maryland for 1888, and for the City of Baltimore for 1887. These\r\nfigures are given not because they of themselves possess any especial\r\nimportance, but because from them can be obtained an idea of the\r\nactivity of a typical State and city.\r\n\r\n_#Maryland.#_[1]--The total receipts from all sources were $2,542,130;\r\nand there was paid out $2,016,060. The chief receipts were from:\r\n\r\n     General Taxes,                      $793,301\r\n     Licenses,                            487,969\r\n     Corporation Tax,                      73,553\r\n     Railroad Tax,                         58,455\r\n     Inheritance Tax,                      57,767\r\n     Income from Stocks and Bonds owned,  206,175\r\n     Fees,                                 17,585\r\n\r\n_#Baltimore.#_[2]--The gross receipts into the treasury for the year\r\nending December 31, 1887, were $8,446,439, and were chiefly from the\r\nfollowing sources:\r\n\r\n     Taxes,                                $4,210,112\r\n     Public schools, tuition fees, etc.,        6,766\r\n     Market houses, rent of stalls,            58,287\r\n     Wharfage and rent of wharves,             33,561\r\n     General licenses,                       44,609\r\n     Auction duties,                          7,431\r\n     Dividends on stock in B. & O.

Of this $4,541,357 was spent on\r\naccount of expenses of city government, the following being the\r\nprincipal items of expense:\r\n\r\n     Interest on the public debt,               $915,987\r\n     Expenses of law courts,                     118,906\r\n     Expenses of jail, magistrates, &c., . .     103,587\r\n     Public schools (less amount paid by State),  594,089\r\n     Expenses of poor,                            210,739\r\n     Police department,                           702,882\r\n     Street-cleaning department,                  263,934\r\n     Fire department,                             214,226\r\n     Street lighting,                             221,203\r\n     Parks, &c.,                                   52,080\r\n     Salaries,                                     72,624\r\n     City council,                                 52,925\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Finance Statistics of the American Commonwealths: E.E.\r\nSeligman. Publications of Am. Statistical Asso., Dec., 1889.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: R.T. Ely, _Taxation in Am. States and Cities_.]\r\n\r\nNearly all of our State and local governments, as well as the national\r\ngovernment, have contracted large public debts, the interest payments\r\nupon which constitute one of the chief items in their lists of\r\nexpenditures. The present debt of the Federal Government is largely the\r\nresult of the enormous expenditures occasioned by the Civil War. In\r\n1865, August 31, it reached its highest point $2,381,530,294, with an\r\nannual interest charge of $150,977,697. Since then it has been steadily\r\nreduced until in 1889 the total interest-bearing debt was but\r\n$829,853,990, with an annual interest charge of $33,752,354. The\r\nprincipal of the national debt is mainly in the form of interest-bearing\r\nbonds held by the National banks and private individuals. These bonds\r\nare of various denominations and are promises of the government to pay\r\nthe sums named on their face, at the expiration of a certain period. The\r\nbonds at present unpaid, and as such constituting the major portion of\r\nour national debt, are principally of two kinds; those bearing four and\r\none-half per cent, annual interest and falling due in 1891, and those\r\nbearing four per cent, interest and falling due in 1907.\r\n\r\nThe debts of most of the States were contracted by ill-advised and\r\nuntimely systems of internal improvements. The total state indebtedness\r\nJune I, 1890, as shown by the Eleventh Census, was $238,396,590, a\r\ndecrease of slightly over $58,000,000 in ten years. The tendency now\r\nseems to be for States to withdraw from the money market as borrowers,\r\nand for the county and city governments to take their place.\r\n\r\nThe local debts are very large, and have shown a marked increase during\r\nthe last twenty years. They have been for the most part incurred in\r\nimprovements and construction of public works, which have in most\r\ninstances well repaid the debts incurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nMoney.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man by himself produces everything he wants to use, but devotes his\r\ntime to the production of some few things, and the surplus that he does\r\nnot use, he exchanges for other things made by other men. In rude stages\r\nof society this is done by a direct exchange of one commodity for\r\nanother, _e.g._ so much wheat or corn for a gun or plow. This is a very\r\nimperfect and cumbersome method, which cannot be employed in our present\r\ncomplicated transactions of buying and selling. There thus early\r\ndeveloped the use of money, or the practice of referring the value of\r\nall things to one standard, usually the precious metals: so that,\r\ninstead of trading 20 bushels of corn for a plow, where it would be\r\nnecessary to go to the great trouble of finding a man who had a plow,\r\nand also wanted your corn, you sell it for so much money, and with this\r\nmoney you buy a plow. Money is thus but a medium of exchange and a\r\nstandard of value.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, as in most nations, money has always been made by\r\nthe Government, and the Government alone, so that one certain fixed\r\nsystem may prevail. For the sake of convenience, money is made of\r\nvarious kinds and denominations, and United States money may\r\nconveniently be regarded under the five following divisions: 1. _#Gold\r\nCoin, Gold Bullion, and Gold Certificates.#_--There are six gold coins:\r\n(1) the eagle, $10 piece; (2) the double eagle, $20 piece; (3) the half\r\neagle, $5; (4) the quarter eagle, $2.50; (5) the $3 piece, and (6) the\r\n$1 piece. The three last are but little used. The gold bullion, or gold\r\nin bars and blocks uncoined, is for all practical purposes as good as\r\nthe coin, and in foreign trade is much used, it being more convenient to\r\nhandle. Besides the gold coin and bullion there are in circulation gold\r\ncertificates. These are paper, the same in general appearance as the\r\nordinary bank-note, and certify that an equivalent amount of gold has\r\nbeen deposited with the Treasurer of the United States, and that the\r\nholder of the certificate has the right to obtain the gold for it at any\r\ntime. This does not increase the amount of money in circulation, as for\r\nevery one issued just so much coin is withdrawn and stowed away in the\r\nTreasury. The certificates are used simply for convenience, and in order\r\nto avoid the necessary wear of the coin if in constant use. These\r\ncertificates are of the denomination of $20.\r\n\r\n2. #_Silver Dollars and Silver Certificates_#.--There is no silver\r\nbullion circulating as money, for a silver dollar does not contain a\r\ndollar's worth of silver, as the gold dollar does of gold, and the\r\nsilver bullion is thus of different value (less value), according to\r\nweight, than the silver dollar. The silver certificates are similar to\r\nthe gold certificates, already described, and certify that an equivalent\r\namount of silver has been deposited in the Treasury.\r\n\r\n3. _#Subsidiary and Minor Coins.#_--All coins of a lower denomination\r\nthan $1 belong to one or the other of these two classes. There are three\r\nsubsidiary coins, the fifty cent, the twenty-five cent, and the ten cent\r\npieces. The three cent piece is no longer coined. All other coins are\r\nminor coins. The peculiarity of the subsidiary and minor coins is that\r\nthey are, as compared with the standard coins (gold and silver dollars),\r\nof a greater value than the value of the metal they contain. The\r\nsubsidiary coins are legal-tender to the amount of $10, the minor to\r\nthe extent of twenty-five cents. By legal-tender is meant that the\r\ngovernment has ordered that it must be received in payment of all debts\r\nand articles bought. Gold coin and the silver dollars and certificates\r\nare legal-tender to any amount.\r\n\r\n4. _#Treasury Notes.#_--Under this head are included that form of money\r\nordinarily known as \"greenbacks,\" from the color of their backs. They\r\nwere originally issued during the civil war, and are promissory notes on\r\nthe part of the government, and as such constitute a portion of the debt\r\nof the government. They are paper, which of itself is of no value, and\r\nno coin is deposited in the Treasury which they represent, as in the\r\ncase of the gold and silver certificates. They thus cost the government\r\nnothing, and, as they are made legal-tender, and paid out by the\r\ngovernment, they were just so much clear gain to it. At first they were\r\nnot redeemable, i.e., exchangeable for coin at the Treasury, but since\r\n1879 they are, and are therefore just as valuable now as any other form\r\nof money, though formerly worth much less than their face value. One\r\nhundred million dollars in gold is kept on deposit in the Treasury for\r\ntheir redemption.\r\n\r\n5. _#Notes of National Banks.#_--This is the one form of money that is\r\nnot issued directly by the Federal government, but through the agency of\r\nwhat is called our \"National Banking System,\" which may be thus\r\ndescribed: A national bank can be organized by any number of men,\r\nprovided the capital stock of the bank is at least $100,000. One-third\r\nof the capital must then be invested in government bonds and deposited\r\nin the United States Treasury. The bank may then issue notes to the\r\nextent of 90 per cent, of such deposit. Such notes are thus amply\r\nsecured by the deposits with the government. The government guarantees\r\ntheir payment, and so they circulate as well as the certificates issued\r\ndirectly by the government. Thus a great deal of the paper money in\r\ncirculation is issued by the national banks, which must, on demand, be\r\nredeemed with coin, and, in case of failure of the banks, are paid by\r\nthe government, which reimburses itself from the deposits. A bank-note\r\ndiffers from a Treasury note in two particulars. The Treasury note or\r\n\"greenback\" is a promise of the government, and is legal-tender in\r\npayment of all private debts; the bank-note is the promise of a private\r\ncompany, and is not legal-tender. A bank-note is said to be paid when\r\nthe bank gives a greenback or coin for it. A greenback is said to be\r\npaid or redeemed when the government gives gold for it.\r\n\r\nThe following figures, taken from the report of the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury for 1889, give the amounts of the various sorts of money\r\ndescribed in the foregoing, which were then in the Treasury, in the\r\nbanks, and in the hands of the people:\r\n\r\n     Gold coin and gold bullion,        $680,063,505\r\n     Silver coin and silver bullion,     343,947,093\r\n     U.S. Treasury notes,                346,681,000\r\n     National Bank-notes,                211,378,963\r\n     Subsidiary coins,                    76,601,836\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that gold and silver certificates are not included,\r\nfor, as explained, they merely represent an equal amount of coin or\r\nbullion on deposit.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of money is thus approximately $1,660,000,000, which,\r\ndivided by the total population, gives about $27 per capita. It should\r\nbe borne in mind in connection with these figures that other devices,\r\nsuch as checks, drafts, bills of exchange, and other forms of credit,\r\nare used side by side with money in carrying on trade and serving the\r\nsame purposes.\r\n\r\nBy the Compromise Silver Bill of July 14, 1890, provision was made for a\r\nnew kind of paper money. By this act the Secretary of the Treasury was\r\ndirected to purchase, from time to time, silver bullion to the amount of\r\n4,500,000 ounces each month, and to issue in payment for such purchases\r\nTreasury notes; these notes so issued to be redeemable on demand in\r\ncoin, and to be a legal tender in payment of all debts, public and\r\nprivate, except where otherwise expressly stipulated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the preparation of this article, much assistance has\r\nbeen derived from an article by H.C. Adams contributed to the\r\n_Chautauquan_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPublic Lands of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to 1781 but six of the original thirteen States--New Hampshire,\r\nRhode Island, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware--had\r\nexactly defined boundaries. The others claimed lands of various extents,\r\nstretching to the Mississippi River, or even to the Pacific Ocean. The\r\ntitle to all this land was then in the individual States, and the\r\nNational Government, as such, had no land of its own. This question of\r\nthe ownership of the western land was one of the subjects of controversy\r\nand discontent between the States. It delayed the adoption of the\r\nArticles of Confederation for some time. Those States with little or no\r\nland regarded with jealousy their more fortunate neighbors, and would\r\nnot consent to a union until a settlement or understanding was reached.\r\n\r\nThe Articles of Confederation were adopted only after assurance was made\r\nthat all the public lands would be ceded to the Federal Government. This\r\nwas finally done by the States.\r\n\r\nThe Government formed under the Constitution succeeded to all this land,\r\nand in addition, to further cessions made by the States, the last being\r\nthat of Georgia in 1802. The subsequent additions of territory were made\r\ndirectly to the United States, and not to the States, and all land thus\r\ngained was held as public land to be disposed of by Congress.\r\n\r\nWhile the area of the United States is 3,603,884 square miles, the\r\npublic domain which has been acquired by cession, purchase, or conquest,\r\nto be disposed of by the Government as it desires, has amounted to\r\n2,708,388 square miles, or about two-thirds of the total area of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe absolute title to this land, as before stated, became vested in the\r\nUnited States Government. The disposal of these lands has always been\r\nunder the sole power and control of Congress.\r\n\r\nThis land was all thinly populated by Indian tribes, who merely hunted\r\nover it, leaving unimproved its natural fertility and vast mineral\r\nresources. These tribes, being actual occupants, were recognized to have\r\na sort of half interest in the land. This half ownership was always\r\nfirst extinguished by the United States by purchase for small sums, or\r\nby the granting of certain privileges, etc., before it was opened up for\r\nsettlement and occupation by the white man. Land is still held, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, in this way by the Indians. This right of the\r\nIndians can be extinguished only by the United States, as they are not\r\nallowed to sell or treat at all with individuals or States or foreign\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nUntil 1812 the affairs of the public domain were managed by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. In that year the office of Commissioner of\r\nthe General Land Office was created, which remained a bureau under the\r\nTreasury Department until 1846. On the creation of the Interior\r\nDepartment in that year, Indian affairs were transferred to it, and have\r\nremained under the same management until the present time. This bureau\r\nhas complete charge of all matters relating to the management and\r\ndisposal of the public lands, subject to the direction of Congress.\r\n\r\nAlmost every conceivable method of disposing of this land has been\r\nfollowed. The Government has, however, never assumed the position of\r\nlandlord and rented the land, except in one case of some mineral land,\r\nand this experiment resulted disastrously. Before the land could be\r\ndisposed of, it was necessary that it should be surveyed by the\r\nGovernment. To do this there was adopted as early as 1776, the so-called\r\nrectangular system, which, with slight changes, has been continued\r\nuntil the present time. By this system there are first surveyed a base\r\nand a meridian line, crossing each other at right angles, running north\r\nand south and east and west. From these fixed lines the land is surveyed\r\nand marked off into rectangles of six miles square, each thus containing\r\nthirty-six square miles. This is called a township. This is again\r\ndivided up into sections of one square mile each or 640 acres, and this\r\nagain into quarter sections of 160 acres each. In some cases these are\r\nstill further subdivided.\r\n\r\nThe regulation and disposition of the public lands has been one of the\r\nchief duties imposed upon Congress.\r\n\r\nThe chief methods by which the public lands have been disposed of are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. _#Educational Grants.#_--Congress from the very first provided\r\nliberally for the establishment of common schools through grants of\r\npublic lands for this purpose. As each township is surveyed one quarter\r\nsection of 640 acres is set apart for common schools. This has continued\r\nfrom the beginning down to the present time. In addition, large grants\r\nhave been made specially for the endowment of universities. Within later\r\nyears land has been given to every State to found State military and\r\nagricultural colleges. Up to the year 1888, there had thus been granted\r\nfor educational purposes 77,448,192 acres.\r\n\r\n2. _#Land Bounties for Military and Naval Service.#_--There have been\r\ngranted by different acts bounties of public land, in the nature of\r\npensions, to the soldiers and sailors of the United States Army, on\r\ntheir honorable discharge, for their service to the Government. The\r\namount of land thus granted (1880) has been 61,028,430 acres.\r\n\r\n3. _#To the States for Internal Improvement.#_--There was granted to the\r\nStates during the years from 1828 to 1846, for the improvement of\r\nrivers, building of canals, wagon roads, railroads, etc., 162,230,099\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n4. _#Sale of Public Land.#_--Under this head there are two classes of\r\npublic land--first, that which may be bought for the minimum rate of\r\n$1.25; and, secondly, the alternate sections along the railroads (the\r\nother alternate sections being granted to the railroads), the minimum\r\nprice of which is $2.50. There have been sold in all 192,584,116 acres,\r\nrealizing $233,000,000.\r\n\r\n5. #_Under the Pre-emption Acts._#--These acts, passed at various times,\r\nprovide that where a man, a citizen of the United States, settles upon\r\nand cultivates for a certain length of time, a tract of land not greater\r\nthan 160 acres, the United States will give him such tract.\r\n\r\n6. #_Under the Homestead Acts._#--The homestead laws have created a\r\nbetter and more certain manner for settlers to acquire land than under\r\nthe pre-emption acts. By these acts it is provided that any citizen who\r\nwill select either 160 acres of the $1.25 land, or 80 of the $2.50 land,\r\ncan then get a permit from the land office, settle on his land, and\r\nacquire a title to it.\r\n\r\n7. _#Under the Timber Culture Act.#_--This act gives to any one the\r\nright to 160 acres of the $1.25 land if he will plant 10 acres in\r\ntimber, or 80 acres of the $2.50 land if he will plant 5 acres in\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\n8. _#Certain Lands to States.#_--Quite a large quantity of the public\r\nland has been given to the States on account of its quality, as swamp or\r\noverflowed land, and for various reasons, to the extent of 158,417,514\r\nacres.\r\n\r\n9. _#Grants to Pacific and other Railroad Companies.#_--The nature of\r\nthese grants have already been spoken of in another chapter. From 1850\r\nto 1872 a total of 150,504,994 acres was given for railroad\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\nReconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the civil war in 1865 did not relieve the United\r\nStates Government of its extraordinary difficulties. There was the whole\r\nSouth, a conquered territory, occupying the anomalous position of a\r\ndistrict, still within the Union, yet possessing no legal state\r\ngovernments. The Confederate government had now been destroyed by the\r\nNorth, and the South was thus without a government. Four million slaves\r\nhad been liberated, who were uneducated, without money, and living among\r\npeople hostile to them. Congress had to provide for and protect these\r\nfreedmen in their rights. The work to be done by Congress, was then:--1.\r\nTo decide upon what terms and upon what conditions the seceded States\r\nshould be re-admitted into the Union, and to provide for them a\r\ngovernment until such re-admission. 2. To protect the negro.\r\n\r\nThe South, though in the Union, had at this time, of course, no\r\nrepresentation in Congress, and consequently, the Republicans were in\r\ngreat majority. Unfortunately, Johnson, who succeeded to the Presidency\r\nat the death of Lincoln, though a Republican, disagreed with his party,\r\nand legislation upon this subject was only secured by passing all acts\r\nover his veto by a two-thirds vote.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion, the first Reconstruction Bill, \"to provide for\r\nthe more efficient government of the rebel States,\" was passed in 1867,\r\nvetoed by the President, and passed over his veto. Its principal\r\nprovisions were--1. The insurrectionary States were to be put under\r\nUnited States control, and for this purpose divided into five military\r\ndistricts, over each of which the President was to appoint a commanding\r\nofficer. 2. The people of the various States might hold a delegate\r\nconvention, elected by the citizens who had not been deprived of the\r\nright to vote for participation in the rebellion. The convention was to\r\nprepare a new constitution, which constitution was to be then submitted\r\nto the vote of the people, and when ratified by them and approved by\r\nCongress, should go into force, and the State be entitled to\r\nrepresentation in Congress. Before approval by Congress the\r\nconstitutions adopted by the rebel States had to agree in all the\r\nfollowing particulars: (1) abolishing slavery; (2) declaring null and\r\nvoid all debts created by States in aid of the rebellion; (3) renouncing\r\nall right of secession; (4) declaring the ordinance of secession which\r\nthey had passed null and void; (5) giving the right to vote to all male\r\ncitizens, without regard to color; (6) prohibiting the passing of any\r\nlaw to limit or abridge the rights of any class of citizens.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted by a sufficient number of\r\nStates, and was declared a part of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 all the States were, for the first time since 1861, represented\r\nin both houses of Congress. Reconstruction by Congress was then\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nParty Machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all the States, counties, cities, and even in the smaller\r\nsubdivisions of wards, political parties are thoroughly organized, with\r\nacknowledged leaders, and under systems of rules or party government.\r\nThis party government, or \"machine,\" as it is called, has been created\r\nby no law or constitution, but is one which has been gradually formed by\r\nthe voters themselves, and under which they have voluntarily placed\r\nthemselves, in order better to succeed in their elections, well\r\nrealizing that the best chance of success is by having all the voters of\r\ntheir party united on certain principles embodied in a party platform,\r\nand having candidates so nominated that the whole party will recognize\r\nthem as their choice.\r\n\r\nThe aims of party organization are: First, union, that is, having all\r\nvoters united as to candidates and platform; and second, recruiting or\r\nthe gaining of new adherents.\r\n\r\nThere are at present two opposing political parties, both striving for\r\nthe control of the Government. Both have very nearly the same system of\r\nparty government, but their organizations are totally distinct and\r\nseparate one from the other.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct parts of party government. They are; first, sets\r\nof committees, whose business it is to do all the work of managing\r\nelections, such as raising and applying funds for election purposes,\r\norganizing meetings, providing speakers, publishing and distributing\r\npolitical tracts and other information, and stirring up enthusiasm by\r\nparades and fireworks, etc. They have also the important duty of\r\ncalling together nominating conventions.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the \"machine\" embraces the nominating conventions,\r\nwhich propose the names of the candidates whom their party are to\r\nsupport for election. These assemblies are called together by the\r\ncommittees periodically, for the purpose of specific nominations, and\r\ncease to exist as soon as their work is done. Besides nominating\r\ncandidates, the conventions draw up the platform, which is a statement\r\nof party principles, beliefs, and pledges. To provide for their\r\nreassembling next time, they also elect a new committee, for the next\r\nterm; and also send delegates to the next higher convention. Thus are\r\nfound committees and a nominating convention, managing not only national\r\nand state elections, but even arranging and managing elections in the\r\nsmaller electoral subdivisions.\r\n\r\nThere is a committee and a nominating convention for every city, for\r\nevery county, for every district, and for every State. There are, then,\r\nthroughout the whole United States, such committees, each controlling\r\nits own local affairs, but yet all related to each other, thus forming\r\none vast organized system.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the smallest and lowest, let us show their mutual\r\nconnections and workings. Starting, then, with the township convention,\r\nor convention of a city ward, we find that all the voters of the party\r\nare called together on a certain day by a committee (which was chosen at\r\nthe preceding meeting) for the purpose of nominating candidates for\r\nlocal affairs, and naming delegates to represent them at the city or\r\ncounty convention. The city or county convention, composed of these men,\r\nis called together by the city or county committee. It first nominates\r\ncandidates for the city or county offices, and selects delegates to the\r\nstate convention, and also provides for the next meeting by the election\r\nof a new committee for the ensuing year. In similar manner, just before\r\nevery state election, the state convention, composed of city and county\r\ndelegates, is called together by the state central committee. Here are\r\nnominated men for state officers; a new committee is appointed to manage\r\nstate elections; and also, once every four years, the important duty of\r\nselecting Presidential electors is performed. The Democrats also select,\r\nin this state convention, their delegates to the National Presidential\r\nNominating Convention. The Republicans select but four delegates from\r\neach State in state conventions, the remainder being appointed in\r\ndistrict conventions. Following the same method the National Central\r\nCommittee calls together a National Convention of all the delegates\r\nwhich have been appointed by the State, for the purpose of (1)\r\nnominating candidates for their party for President and Vice President;\r\n(2) drawing up and accepting a party platform; (3) selecting a new\r\nNational Central Committee for the next four years, which committee is\r\nto manage the election campaign and call the next National Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nNational Conventions and Presidential Campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_#History and Development of the National Convention.#_--In the\r\nPresidential elections of 1789 and 1792 there was no necessity for\r\nregular party nominations, as the whole people were practically\r\nunanimous in favor of Washington. Likewise in 1796 it was so well\r\nunderstood that Adams was the man desired by the Federalists, and\r\nJefferson by the Democrats, that formal nominations were not required.\r\nBut, commencing with 1800, political parties were more divided in their\r\nchoice, and some method was demanded by which it might be decided on\r\nwhom the party should unite. From 1800 to 1820 this demand was met by\r\nnominations made by Congressmen, in caucuses, or private meetings, of\r\nthe members of each party. This method finally proved unsatisfactory to\r\nthe country, but from 1824-1835 no new and better method was invented,\r\nand nominations were made rather irregularly, each State legislature\r\nproposing the name of its favorite. This method of nomination naturally\r\nfailed to unite the voters of the party, in all the different States, on\r\none man, and had to be abandoned. After a failure to revive nomination\r\nfor President by Congressional caucuses, a new method was developed and\r\nadopted, which was by National Nominating Conventions, such as we have\r\nto-day. The introduction of this last plan may fairly be dated at 1840.\r\nNational Conventions were first held at Eastern cities, but are now held\r\nfurther West, to accommodate the shifting center of population, Chicago\r\nbeing the favorite city. The National Convention is composed of\r\ndelegates from all the States. Each State sends twice as many delegates\r\nas it has representatives in the National Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives, thus making a total now of 802. In addition to these,\r\nthe Republicans allow two delegates from each of the Territories.\r\n\r\n_#Method of Procedure.#_--As soon as the State and Territorial\r\ndelegations arrive in the city they each elect a member for the new\r\nNational Central Committee for the next term. Inside of this committee\r\nis chosen an executive committee, which, in reality, does all the work\r\nof conducting the campaign. The members of this committee are almost\r\nalways men of wealth, and are expected to contribute liberally to the\r\ncampaign fund.\r\n\r\nThe business of the National Convention is commenced by the chairman of\r\nthe National Central Committee calling the convention to order. A\r\ntemporary chairman is then chosen, who appoints a \"committee on\r\ncredentials,\" whose duty it is to decide which delegation shall be\r\nadmitted in case two delegations are sent from the same State, both\r\nclaiming admittance as representing the party in that State. A\r\n\"committee on resolutions\" is also appointed to prepare the party\r\nplatform. The next day the permanent chairman is appointed. The platform\r\nis then read and adopted, or amended and adopted. There is next an\r\nalphabetical roll-call of the States, when names are proposed and\r\nseconded for nomination as candidates for President. The average number\r\nof names proposed is seven or eight, though sometimes as many as twelve\r\nare offered. As each man is proposed the delegate presenting his name\r\nextols him in a laudatory speech, and gives reasons why his man will\r\nmake a strong candidate and an able President. Voting then commences.\r\nEach delegate has one vote. In the Republican convention a majority of\r\nthe whole number of the delegates voting for one man is required before\r\na nomination is reached, while the Democrats require a two-thirds vote.\r\nSometimes a nomination is made on the first ballot, while at other\r\ntimes the convention has been so divided that as many as 53 ballots have\r\nbeen required, as was the case when the Whigs nominated Scott.\r\nForty-nine ballots were needed when Pierce was nominated by the\r\nDemocrats. In 1888 Cleveland was nominated by the Democrats by\r\nacclamation, no vote being necessary to show the wishes of the\r\ndelegates. Harrison was nominated by the Republicans on the eighth\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nA candidate for President having been selected, a Vice President is\r\nnominated in a similar manner, though generally with much less trouble,\r\nand the work of the convention is ended.\r\n\r\nThe candidates are now put before the people by their respective\r\nparties. The people, of course, do not vote directly for them, but what\r\namounts to the same thing, vote for electors, who are pledged to vote\r\nfor them. A vigorous campaign of four months then follows, until\r\nelection day, in the first week in November.\r\n\r\nEach candidate, a short time after his nomination, is expected to\r\npublish a letter of acceptance, in which he expresses his full\r\nconfidence and belief in the platform which his party has adopted,\r\ndiscloses his views, and outlines what his future policy will be if he\r\nis elected.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, then, in a few words, let us see how a President is\r\nnominated and elected.\r\n\r\nIn nominating the President each voter in caucus or primary meeting\r\nshares in choosing delegates to the ward convention, which chooses\r\ndelegates to the city or county convention, which in turn sends\r\ndelegates to the district conventions. In these, delegates are chosen\r\nfor the State conventions, where Presidential electors are appointed,\r\nand also the delegates sent to the National Convention.\r\n\r\nIn the National Convention, composed of delegates sent from the State\r\nconventions and Territories, the Presidential candidate is nominated.\r\nThe electors are elected by the people, who in turn elect the nominees\r\nof their National Convention. If State officers, as Governor,\r\nAttorney-General, Secretary of State, Treasurer, etc., are to be\r\nelected, they are nominated in the State conventions and elected by the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nBesides counties, townships, and cities, States have other subdivisions\r\nfor political purposes. Thus the whole State is divided into senatorial\r\ndistricts, each one of which sends one Senator to the State legislature,\r\nand also into smaller districts, each one of which sends one member to\r\nthe lower house of the State legislature. Usually a senatorial district\r\nis one or more counties, except in the case of large cities, which may\r\nin itself contain two or more senatorial districts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nIntroduction to the Study of the History of Political Parties in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA knowledge of the nature of our federal government, and its relations\r\nto the State Governments, of which it is composed, is a prerequisite to\r\nan understanding of the history of our political parties.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States is a federal republic, first formed\r\nby the voluntary union of thirteen commonwealths. At present it is\r\ncomposed of forty-four united States. It is a government of enumerated\r\npowers, and in this respect differs radically from the governments of\r\nthe individual States. As all agree, the Federal Government possesses\r\nonly those powers specifically granted to it by the constitution. The\r\nStates possess all powers except those granted to the National\r\nGovernment, and those not prohibited to them by the terms of the\r\nconstitution. When the government of the United States desires to\r\nexercise a power, it must be proven that it was the intention of the\r\nframers of the constitution, and so expressed in that instrument, that\r\nit should possess such a power. The States in the exercise of their\r\npowers need only show that they have not resigned that power. If there\r\nbe any dispute as to the constitutionality of an act of either Congress\r\nor a State legislature, the point is decided in the final instance by\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the political history of our country since the adoption of the\r\nconstitution, there have been ever present two great constitutional\r\nquestions, in the conflicting answers to which we must seek the origin\r\nand creeds of our great political parties. If we can gain a proper\r\nconception of the character of these two questions, we shall have taken\r\na long step towards the understanding of the reasons for the conduct of\r\nthe various opposing parties, and the basis of the disputes arising\r\nbetween them. These have been the two questions. First, What is the\r\nextent of the powers granted by the constitution to the National\r\nGovernment? Second, What is the real nature of our Union; and, arising\r\nunder this problem, What is the extent to which the States are justified\r\nin opposing what they believe to be unconstitutional acts on the part of\r\nthe National Government; and, Can a State or States, as a last resort,\r\nwithdraw from the Union? The remainder of this chapter will be mainly\r\ndevoted to a more particular examination of these questions.\r\n\r\nWhat are the legitimate powers of the United States Government?\r\n\r\nThe United States government was the result of the union of thirteen\r\nindependent colonies--a union voluntary on the part of the colonies, yet\r\nforced upon them by the evident need of some central power strong enough\r\nto enforce obedience at home and demand respect abroad. The\r\ndetermination of what and how many the national powers should be, was\r\nthe work of the Constitutional Convention. Of the difficulties of this\r\ntask we have already spoken.\r\n\r\nIn forming a scheme for a central government, there was the double\r\nnecessity of creating a government strong enough to perform the duties\r\nfor which it was established, and yet not so strong as to endanger the\r\nfree self-government of the States. The delicate point to be adjusted\r\nwas to give to the Federal Government only such powers as were necessary\r\nfor the establishment of an effective National Government, and, as far\r\nas possible, to retain in the States their full governmental powers; in\r\nother words, to harmonize federal strength with State sovereignty.\r\n\r\nThe fear exhibited by the States in the debates preceding the adoption\r\nand ratification of the constitution of 1787, that the National\r\nGovernment might become too strong at the expense of their own powers of\r\ngovernment, was not set at rest by the compromises obtained in the\r\nconvention, nor by the eleven amendments adopted soon after the\r\ninauguration of the new government. The reason for the continuance of\r\nthis fear is that the constitution is so worded that the powers of the\r\ngeneral government are not precisely fixed.\r\n\r\nThe statement sometimes loosely made that a description of our\r\ngovernment is contained in the constitution, is apt to be misleading.\r\nThe constitution has served rather as a foundation upon which to build\r\nthe government, than as an entire framework. As a distinguished writer\r\nhas termed it, \"The constitution was meant only as a scheme in outline,\r\nto be filled up afterwards, and from time to time, by legislation.\"\r\n\r\nA description of our present form of government is far from being\r\ncontained in the instrument adopted in 1788. For example, the\r\nconstitution makes no mention of how business shall be transacted by the\r\nlegislature. Committee Government in Congress owes its existence to no\r\nprovision of the constitution. The only mention made in the constitution\r\nof the Speaker of the House, to-day the most powerful officer in the\r\nlegislature, is where it is provided that \"The House of Representatives\r\nshall choose their speaker and other officers.\" All executive\r\ndepartments--the State, War, Navy, Treasury, Post Office, Interior,\r\nJustice, Agriculture, and Labor--have been created from time to time by\r\nact of Congress. Regarding the structure and number of federal courts,\r\nthe constitution merely provides that \"The judicial power of the United\r\nStates shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts\r\nas Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\" Our elaborate\r\nsystem of district, circuit, and territorial courts, rests solely upon\r\ncongressional enactments. So, too, the constitution gives to Congress\r\nthe control of territories, but does not provide how that control shall\r\nbe exercised.\r\n\r\nThe framers of our constitution were wise in not attempting to specify\r\nmore particularly than they did, the manner in which the several powers\r\ngranted to the Federal Government should be exercised. They realized\r\nthat they were forming a scheme that was to endure for many years, and\r\nthat if it was to be capable of meeting the needs of a changing and\r\nrapidly growing country, it would have to be elastic, and contain within\r\nitself the power of adapting itself to new needs and conditions. To\r\nsecure the beneficial execution of the powers granted, Congress was\r\ngiven the power of selecting appropriate means. To have refused the\r\ngrant of this power, would have been to attempt to provide by\r\nunchangeable rule for emergencies that could by no possibilities be\r\nforeseen. Or, as Chief Justice Marshall has put it, \"It would have been\r\nto deprive the legislature of the capacity to avail itself of\r\nexperience, to exercise its reason, and to accommodate its legislation\r\nto circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nAfter enumerating the various particular powers given to the Federal\r\nLegislature, the constitution further says (Art. I, Sec. 8) \"and [shall\r\nhave power] to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for\r\ncarrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers\r\nvested by this constitution in the government of the United States, or\r\nin any department or officer thereof.\" This is the clause under whose\r\nauthorization all those powers have been assumed, and functions\r\nexercised, that have made the United States government of to-day so\r\ndifferent from that of 1789.\r\n\r\nThe general rule is, as has been said, that the United States government\r\npossesses only those powers granted to it by the constitution. But here,\r\nin this clause just quoted, is a general grant of all powers necessary\r\nor proper for carrying into effect any of the powers particularly\r\ngranted. Who or what is to decide just what powers are necessary and\r\nproper for the accomplishment of this object? Naturally people have not\r\nbeen able to agree upon the question of just what powers are\r\nconstitutional or expedient as \"implied\" under this title of \"necessary\r\nand proper\" and this question has been largely instrumental in dividing\r\nthe people in opposing political parties. There has always been a party,\r\nthe members of which, favoring great powers for the States rather than\r\nfor the Federal Government, have been \"strict constructionists,\" and\r\nhave advocated a close and narrow interpretation of this clause of\r\n\"implied powers.\" From their desire to retain in the State governments\r\nas many powers as possible, they have been known as the \"States' Rights\r\nParty.\" Opposing them has been the party of \"loose constructionists,\"\r\nthe members of which have held to a free, liberal interpretation of the\r\nconstitution, and have endeavored to increase the power of the Federal\r\nGovernment. There have never been political parties styling themselves\r\n\"Strict Constructionists\" and \"Loose Constructionists,\" for these are\r\nterms that have been used not as titles, but as definitions of different\r\nprinciples of constitutional interpretation. But by whatever name they\r\nmay have been known, there have been, during the greater part of our\r\nhistory, these two political parties, the one holding to the principle\r\nof strict construction and States' Rights, and the other to that of\r\nloose construction and federal power.\r\n\r\nThe second fundamental question spoken of in the beginning of this\r\nchapter as underlying national politics, is concerning the nature of our\r\nunion and the rights of state nullification and secession.\r\n\r\nA final answer to these questions cannot of course be here attempted,\r\nbut that which can be done, is to state in a few words just what their\r\nmeaning is, and the points upon which they have turned. When we come to\r\nthe consideration of the course of politics in the United States we\r\nshall see the answers that history has given to them.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States is the judge of its own powers, for\r\nit is in its own supreme judicial tribunal that the constitutionality of\r\nboth State and Federal laws is finally determined. More than once has a\r\npractical answer been demanded to the question What is to be done by a\r\nState or States when, in their estimation, the National Government has\r\ntranscended its powers and legislated in an unconstitutional manner?\r\nObedience, nullification, or, in the last resort, secession from the\r\nUnion, have been the various alternatives that have offered themselves\r\nto the States. Different views of the nature of our Union have sustained\r\nthe propriety of the selection of different ones of these alternatives.\r\n\r\nAccording to the nullification theory, the constitution is held to be of\r\nthe nature of a compact between the States as one party and the Federal\r\nGovernment as the other; and that, as in all contracts, if the\r\nagreements contained therein are broken by the one party, the other\r\nparty has the right to refuse its assent thereto. Therefore, if the\r\nUnited States government attempts the exercise of powers not granted in\r\nthe compact, the States have the right to interpose the \"rightful\r\nremedy\" of \"nullification.\" That is to say, that each State has the\r\nright to determine for itself when an unwarranted power has been assumed\r\nby the general government, and in such a case to declare the obnoxious\r\nlaw null and of no force within her own boundaries.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of nullification, it is necessary to\r\ndistinguish between the theory or rather method of nullification\r\npropounded by Madison and Jefferson in the Virginia and Kentucky\r\nResolutions, from that of Calhoun brought forward at the time of South\r\nCarolina's resistance to, and attempted nullification of, the Tariff\r\nlaws of 1828, and 1832. In the Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions the\r\nAlien and Sedition Acts were solemnly declared to be unconstitutional,\r\nthat the Union was a compact, and the States had the right to interpose\r\nthe remedy of nullification; but open resistance was not proposed. By\r\nthe Jeffersonian theory, it was proposed to obtain the opinion of\r\nthree-fourths of the States that the acts were unconstitutional, and\r\nthus to \"nullify\" them after the manner of a constitutional amendment.\r\nUntil such nullification, the laws were to be obeyed.\r\n\r\nThe Calhoun doctrine was something entirely different from this.\r\nAccording to his doctrine, any single State might order at once a\r\nsuspension of the law within her borders, and not until three-fourths of\r\nthe States in national convention had overruled the nullification could\r\nthe State be forced to obey the obnoxious law. To use Calhoun's own\r\nwords, his theory was, that \"it belongs to the State, as a member of the\r\nUnion, in her sovereign capacity in convention, to determine definitely,\r\nas far as her citizens are concerned, the extent of the obligation which\r\nshe has _contracted_; and if, in her opinion, the act exercising the\r\npower in dispute be unconstitutional, to declare it null and void, which\r\ndeclaration would be obligatory on her citizens.\" The sum and substance\r\nof this was, as Von Holst has pointed out,[1] to give to one-fourth of\r\nthe States the power if they saw fit to deprive the Federal Government\r\nof every power entrusted to it, that is, to alter the constitution at\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Constitutional History of the United States_, Vol. I, p.\r\n474, note.]\r\n\r\nThe right of secession follows as a logical outcome of the theory of\r\nnullification rigidly carried out. Federal laws are general in their\r\nnature, and if binding anywhere, must be binding everywhere. If then, a\r\nminority of States insist on their right of nullification, the federal\r\ngovernment will be obliged either to admit that every act of Congress is\r\nwithout any force in a State until it has obtained the tacit approval of\r\nthe people of that State, or else it will be driven to the necessity of\r\nobtaining the enforcement of the law by arms. Such employment of force\r\nwould of course be but the prelude to secession. Indeed, South Carolina,\r\nin her Ordinance of Nullification, declared that she would secede, if\r\nthe United States did not repeal the obnoxious laws, or if she should\r\nattempt to enforce the collections of the tariff duties provided for by\r\nthe acts in dispute. According to the Unionist view, it is held that in\r\nno case has the individual State the right to resist the operation of a\r\nfederal law, much less does it possess the actual power to pass a law\r\naffecting its relation to, or continuance in, the Union. This view is\r\nsupported by an interpretation of the constitution that denies to that\r\ninstrument the character of a compact between the States and the\r\nNational Government. The constitutional theory of this school is that\r\nthe National Government was formed _by the people_ as a whole, and not\r\nby the States. That the States accepted this government, but were in no\r\nsense parties to an agreement between them and the Nation. According to\r\nthis view, the Union began with the first acts of resistance taken in\r\ncommon by the colonies, and is thus, in a sense, older than the state\r\ngovernments, which were not formed until after the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. Also, that when the States gave in 1788 their consent to\r\nthe constitution, their consent was irrevocable. Two quotations from\r\ndecisions rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States will make\r\nclear the arguments and theory of the Unionists.\r\n\r\nSaid Chief Justice Marshall:[1] \"The convention which promulgated the\r\nconstitution was indeed elected by the state legislatures, but the\r\ninstrument when it came from their hands, was a mere proposal, without\r\nobligations or pretentious to it. It was reported to the then existing\r\nCongress of the United States, with a request that it might 'be\r\nsubmitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each State by the\r\npeople thereof, under recommendation of its legislature for their assent\r\nand ratification.' This mode of proceeding was adopted, and by the\r\nconventions, by Congress, and by the state legislatures, the instrument\r\nwas submitted to the people. They acted upon it in the only way in which\r\nthey can act safely, effectually, and wisely on such a subject, by\r\nassenting in convention. It is true they assembled in their several\r\nStates, an where could they have assembled? From these conventions the\r\nconstitution derives its whole authority. The government proceeds\r\ndirectly from the people. The assent of the States in their sovereign\r\ncapacity is implied in calling the convention, and thus submitting that\r\ninstrument to the people. But the people were at perfect liberty to\r\naccept or reject it, and their decision was final. It required not the\r\naffirmance of, and could not be negatived by, the state governments. The\r\nconstitution when adopted was of complete obligation, and bound the\r\nstate sovereignties. The government of the Union then, is emphatically\r\nand truly a government of the people. In form and in substance it\r\nemanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be\r\nexercised directly on them, and for their benefit.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _McCulloch_ v. _Md._, 4 Dall., 316.]\r\n\r\nSaid Chief Justice Chase:[1] \"The union of the States never was a purely\r\nartificial and arbitrary relation. It began among the colonies, and grew\r\nout of common origin, mutual sympathies, kindred principles, and\r\ngeographical relations. It was confirmed and strengthened by the\r\nnecessities of war, and received definite form and character and\r\nsanction from the articles of Confederation. By these the union was\r\nsolemnly declared to 'be perpetual.' And when the articles were found to\r\nbe inadequate to the exigencies of the country, the constitution was\r\nordained 'to form a more perfect union.' It is difficult to convey the\r\nidea of indissoluble unity more clearly than by these words. What can be\r\nmore indissoluble if a perpetual union made more perfect, is not? But\r\nthe perpetuity and indissolubility of the union, by no means implies the\r\nloss of distinct and individual existence, or of the right of\r\nself-government by the States.... Without the States in Union, there\r\ncould be no such political body as the United States. Not only,\r\ntherefore, can there be no loss of separate and independent autonomy to\r\nthe States, through their union under the constitution, but it may be\r\nnot unreasonably said that the preservation of the States, and the\r\nmaintenance of their governments are as much within the design and care\r\nof the constitution, as the preservation of the Union and the\r\nmaintenance of the National Government. The constitution in all its\r\nprovisions looks to an indestructible Union composed of indestructible\r\nStates.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Texas_ v. _White_, 7 Wall., 750.]\r\n\r\nA civil war of four years' duration has decided the Unionist theory of\r\nour government to be the one under which the Nation is to be governed.\r\nWhether or not, in point of fact, the Nation was older than the States,\r\nand the constitution not a compact, but an indissoluble Union, will\r\nalways remain a question to be discussed. The dispute turns upon a point\r\nthat does not admit of final determination. We can only theorize. To\r\nmaintain the view that the Union is older than the States it is\r\nnecessary to show that the Continental Congress was of such a character,\r\nand its powers of such a nature, that a true national government may be\r\nsaid to have existed before July 4, 1776, and therefore, that the\r\nDeclaration of Independence and the consequent transformation of the\r\ncolonies into States were not the result of the individual action of\r\nseparate colonies, but of the whole people united in a nation. And,\r\nfollowing from this, that the States were never out of the union, but\r\nthat the individual colonies became States, only as belonging to the\r\nUnited States. Consequently that the theory of a 'compact' between the\r\nStates and the United States is untenable, for at the time the United\r\nStates was born, the States did not exist.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As Lincoln expressed it in his message of July 4, 1861:\r\n\"The States have their _status_ in the Union, and they have no other\r\nlegal status.... The Union is older than any of the States, and in fact,\r\nit created them as States.\"]\r\n\r\nTo maintain the \"Compact Theory\" it is necessary to show that the\r\n\"Continental Congress\" had no properly delegated national powers, and\r\nto it the character of a national government could not fitly be applied,\r\nand that the colonies when they separated from England remained\r\nindependent of each other, because as colonies they had been\r\nindependent. Therefore, that the initial clause of the Preamble to the\r\nConstitution \"We the people of the United States\" referred not to all\r\nthe people of the United States in their collective capacity, but to the\r\npeople of the several States.\r\n\r\nIn fine, admitting, as all do, the Continental Congress to have been a\r\nrevolutionary body, exercising undelegated powers, the question is, Was\r\nit, or was it not, a _de jure_, as well as _de facto_ national\r\ngovernment, and this is a question that cannot be answered absolutely.\r\n\r\nThese opposing views of the character of our constitution have been\r\nstated not with the idea of proving either of them to be the correct\r\none, but solely to indicate the lines along which political parties have\r\nfought their battles. Thus, it is hoped, the student will be prepared\r\nfor an intelligent consideration of the various political parties that\r\nhave existed in the course of his country's history.\r\n\r\nTo complete the statement of the underlying causes and fundamental\r\nprinciples that have directed the course of our national politics, it is\r\nnecessary to give at least some short account of the natural causes that\r\nhave operated irresistibly to divide the North and the South in their\r\npolitical thoughts and actions.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that slavery flourished in the South, but languished and was\r\ngradually abolished in the North? Why is it that the stronghold of the\r\nStates' Rights doctrine of nullification and of secession was in the\r\nSouth, and the citadel of the Unionists in the North? Why is it that\r\nto-day the debate between high and low customs duties, is, to a very\r\nconsiderable extent, a discussion between the New England and Middle\r\nStates and the Southern States?\r\n\r\nTo all these questions a very satisfactory answer can be found in the\r\ndifferent physical characteristics of the North and South. The nature\r\nof the soil and climate, as well as the character of the settlers,\r\npredetermined for the Southern colonies an agricultural character, and\r\nfor the colonies of the North a commercial and industrial character;\r\nand, already by the end of the eighteenth century we find in them a\r\nmarked difference of political and social life.\r\n\r\nFrom the very start, the South, favored by a mild climate, rich soil,\r\nand broad, low-lying valleys, developed an agricultural life. Slavery\r\nwas introduced at an early date, and flourished, the warm climate being\r\ncongenial to the negro, and the rude manual labor of the field suited to\r\nhis meagre capabilities. The result of these influences was to develop\r\nin the South a system of large ill-worked manors or estates. The\r\npredominance of slave labor, discouraged the immigration of free labor,\r\nand the South remained comparatively thinly settled. The moral effect of\r\nslavery upon the white population was bad. Habits of thriftlessness and\r\nlaziness were engendered among the free population, and their social\r\nrelations corrupted.\r\n\r\nIn the North, an indented coast with many good harbors, a rugged soil,\r\nand a wintry climate, encouraged the development of a commercial and\r\nmanufacturing life. Slave labor here proved itself scarcely profitable,\r\nneither the climate nor the nature of the work required, being suited to\r\nthe frames and abilities of the African. As compared with the South, the\r\nNorth soon became thickly settled, and largely as a result of this,\r\nadopted the small area of the town or township as its most important\r\nunit of local government, instead of the larger area, the county, used\r\nin the South. This essential difference in the system of local\r\ngovernment in the North, from that of the South, has remained unchanged\r\nto this day, and has exercised great influence upon the political habits\r\nof the peoples of these two sections.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the adoption of the constitution, these differences\r\nbetween the northern and southern colonies were not so great as they\r\nwere soon to become. As contrasted with the North, the agricultural\r\ncharacter of the South was already marked, but the designation of these\r\ntwo sections as \"free\" and \"slave\" states had not yet come into use. It\r\nwas the remarkable development of the cultivation of cotton consequent\r\nupon the invention of Whitney's cotton gin in 1793, that gave the\r\ntremendous impetus to the increase of slavery in the South. While prior\r\nto the introduction of this machine, scarcely a single pound of cotton\r\ncould be separated from the seed by a man in a day, Whitney's gin made\r\nit possible to prepare for market three hundred and fifty pounds per\r\nday. The nature of the cotton plant rendered it peculiarly fitted to the\r\nclimate and soil of the South, and the ease with which it could be\r\ncultivated and prepared for market, made the application of slave labor\r\nextremely profitable. In 1789 many of the southern states exhibited\r\nevidences of a desire and intention to ultimately abolish slavery, but\r\nfrom this time we hear nothing more of this. After 1800 the number of\r\nslaves increased rapidly. The census of 1790 showed in the southern\r\ncolonies 650,000, while that of 1820 showed the number to be over\r\n1,580,000. From 1800 to 1865 the political life of the South is largely\r\nexplainable by the interest of its people in, and devotion to, the\r\ninstitution of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe promptness with which, irrespective of party affiliations, the\r\npeople of the North assumed the anti-slavery attitude and those of the\r\nSouth placed themselves under the pro-slavery banner, at the time of the\r\nMissouri contest in 1820, shows the extent to which these two sections\r\nof the United States were already divided upon this great question. The\r\nSouth, retarded in its growth by the employment of slave labor, as\r\ncompared with the North already exhibited an example of arrested\r\ndevelopment, and her politicians saw that if the balance of power\r\nbetween the slave-holding and the non-slave-holding States was to be\r\nmaintained, a wider field for the extension of their favorite\r\ninstitution would have to be provided. It is in the light of this motive\r\nthat the desire of the South for the annexation of Cuba and of Texas,\r\neven at the expense of a war with Mexico, is to be interpreted. The\r\ncompromise of 1820 satisfied the demands of the slavocracy for a time,\r\nbut only for a time. In 1850 the South again demanded, and obtained\r\nconcessions. It required a civil war to demonstrate to us the futility\r\nof endeavoring to avert by compromise the conflict that was\r\nirrepressible between the North and South so long as slavery existed in\r\nthe one, and was reprobated in the other.\r\n\r\nThe different attitudes assumed at the present day by the North and\r\nSouth in regard to the Tariff question, is explainable by the difference\r\nin the industrial life of these two sections. The North is essentially a\r\nmanufacturing centre, and, as such, demands high import duties as a\r\nprotection to her manufacturers and merchants. The South is, as a whole,\r\nagricultural, and favors low duties with the idea of thus extending\r\nforeign trade, and affording a larger market for the sale of her raw\r\nproducts. A striking proof of the influence of the industrial life of a\r\nsection in determining its attitude towards the tariff, is seen in the\r\nchange of front of Massachusetts after 1824 from free-trade to\r\nprotection, this change being wholly due to the predominating influence\r\nacquired by her manufactures over her commerce and agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the assistance of those who may desire a fuller acquaintance with\r\nthe administrative methods of our Federal and State Governments than is\r\nto be obtained from this book, these bibliographical notes are appended.\r\nNot only the authorities actually consulted in the preparation of this\r\nmonograph are given, but mention is also made of the most reliable and\r\naccessible sources of information upon the more important topics germane\r\nto the study of Government and Administration. In arrangement, the notes\r\nfollow the order of topics used in the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Works upon United States Government.\r\n\r\nWorthy of first mention is the admirable work of James Bryce, _The\r\nAmerican Commonwealth_, 2 vols., 1888. To the student of American\r\ninstitutions and administration these two volumes are indispensable. In\r\nthem is contained the best and latest scientific exposition of our\r\npolitical institutions as they exist to-day. The only criticism that can\r\nbe made regarding the work is that the executive departments have not\r\nreceived sufficient attention as regards the details of their\r\nadministration, nor the practical and scientific value of the work\r\nperformed by their numerous bureaus. Interesting from an historical\r\npoint of view is De Tocqueville's _Democracy in America_, now fifty\r\nyears old. Lalor's _Encyclopaedia of Political Science, Political\r\nEconomy and American History_ is by far the best work for reference. The\r\nprincipal articles in the field of political science are contributed by\r\nDr. J.C. Bluntschli, those upon United States History by the late Prof.\r\nAlexander Johnston, and those upon Federal Administration by A.R.\r\nSpofford, Librarian of Congress.\r\n\r\nBannatyne's _Hand-book of Republican Institutions in the United States_\r\nis an authoritative work based upon federal and state laws, and other\r\nauthoritative sources of information. It is entirely descriptive and\r\nvery complete. Other general works are Mulford's _The Nation: the\r\nFoundation of Civil Order and Political Life in the United States_;\r\nLaboulaye's _Histoire Politique des Etats-Unis,_ 3 vols.; and Lamphere's\r\n_The United States Government: Its Organization and Practical Workings_,\r\nthis last being chiefly valuable for its statistical and tabulated\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nAmong foreign works that consider the theory and practice of the United\r\nStates Government, are Bagehot's _English Constitution_; Sir Henry\r\nMaine's chapter on the _Constitution of the United States_ in his\r\n_Popular Government_; E.A. Freeman's article _Presidential Government_\r\ncontained in his _Historical Essays_ (1871); Lord Brougham's chapter on\r\nthe _Government of the United States_ in his _Political Philosophy_,\r\nVol. 3; and E. Boutmy's _Etudes de droit Constitutionel._ For current\r\npolitical information McPherson's _Hand-book of Politics_, issued every\r\ntwo years since 1870, is valuable. Besides statistical information\r\nregarding government revenues and expenditures, public debts, votes,\r\npopulation, names of congressmen, &c.; these hand-books contain\r\nPresidential and Gubernatorial messages, transcripts from the\r\n_Congressional Record_ relating to leading matters discussed in\r\nCongress; and decisions of the Supreme Court that are of general\r\nimportance. _The Statesman's Year-Book_, published annually by Macmillan\r\n& Co., is valuable for reference in matters concerning both foreign and\r\nAmerican governments. Bibliographical references are also given to each\r\nexisting government.\r\n\r\nJohn Fiske's recent volume on _Civil Government in the United States_,\r\nstands in merit far above other manuals bearing this name, most of which\r\nare simply running commentaries on the constitution. An excellent\r\nfeature of Mr. Fiske's book is the addition of bibliographical notes at\r\nthe ends of the chapters.\r\n\r\nThe following are manuals that may be recommended as of comparative\r\nmerit: Macy, _Our Government: How it Grew, What it Does, and How it Does\r\nit_; Cocker's _Civil Government_; Thorpe's _Government of the People of\r\nthe United States_; Martin's _Civil Government_, and Ford's _American\r\nCitizens' Manual_.\r\n\r\nThe most complete collection of bibliographical references to the\r\nConstitution of the United States is that prepared by W.E. Foster, and\r\npublished as _Economic Tract_ No. xxix, by the \"Society for Political\r\nEducation,\" New York.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nDr. J.C. Bluntschli's _Lehre vom Modernen Stat_, in three volumes, gives\r\nthe finest treatment of the various forms and general principles of\r\ngovernments. A portion of Dr. Bluntschli's work has been translated into\r\nEnglish and published under the title _The Theory of the State_. There\r\nis also a French translation of this work. Other authorities under this\r\nhead are: Bluntschli's _Staatswörterbuch_; Woolsey's _Political Science,\r\nor the State Theoretically and Practically Considered_; and\r\nMontesquieu's _De l'Esprit des Lois_. Interesting from an historical\r\npoint of view, are the theories contained in the works of political\r\nphilosophers in the past. See Plato's _Republic_; Aristotle's\r\n_Politics_, Cicero's _De Republica_; Thomas Aquinas' _Of the Government\r\nof Principles;_ Dante's _De Monarchia_; Machiavelli's _Prince_; Jean\r\nBodin's _Of the Commonwealth_; Hobbes' _Leviathan_; Filmer's\r\n_Patriarcha_; Hooker's _Ecclesiastical Polity_; Locke's _Civil\r\nGovernment_; J.J. Rousseau's _Social Contract_; Bentham's _Fragment on\r\nGovernment_; J.S. Mills' _Representative Government_.\r\n\r\nPollock's _History of the Science of Politics_, published in the\r\n\"Humboldt Library,\" contains an admirable summary of the views of these\r\npolitical philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe works of several of these authors (Hobbes, Hooker, Locke, Filmer,\r\nMachiavelli) are contained in \"Morley's Universal Library,\" published by\r\nRoutledge at one shilling per volume.\r\n\r\nFor theories regarding the origin and development of government, see\r\nMaine's _Ancient Law, Early History of Institutions_, and _Early Law and\r\nCustom_; Spencer's _Principles of Sociology_, Vol. I; Morgan's _Ancient\r\nSociety_; McLennan's _Studies in Ancient History_, and _The Patriarchal\r\nTheory_; and Bagehot's _Physics and Politics_, published in the Humbolt\r\nLibrary. The contract theory of government is presented in various forms\r\nin the works of Hobbes, Hooker, Locke and Rousseau.\r\n\r\n\r\nFunctions of Government.\r\n\r\nThe proper limits of state action are discussed in Mill's _Essay on\r\nLiberty_; Huxley's _Administrative Nihilism_ (Humboldt Lib.); Spencer's\r\n_Social Statics, Man versus the State, The Coming Slavery_, and _The\r\nSins of Legislators_ (Humboldt Lib.); Stephen's _Liberty, Equality,\r\nFraternity_; Humboldt's _Sphere and Duties of Government_; and H.C.\r\nAdams' _State in Relation to Industrial Action_, published by the\r\nAmerican Economic Association. Wilson's _The State_ contains a valuable\r\nchapter upon the functions of government. For a description of existing\r\nforms of government, Prof. Woodrow Wilson's _The State_ is very\r\nvaluable. See also _Statesmen's Year Books_.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonial Governments.\r\n\r\nVolumes III, IV, and V of Winsor's _Narrative and Critical History of\r\nAmerica_, 8 vols., contain excellent monographs upon the founding,\r\nhistory and nature of government of the various colonies. Doyle's two\r\nvolumes, entitled _The English Colonies in America_, present an\r\nexhaustive study of the American colonies from an European point of\r\nview. A handy digest of this work is contained in his small _History of\r\nthe United States_, published as one of the volumes in \"Freeman's\r\nHistorical Course for Schools.\" Lodge's _Short History of the English\r\nColonies in America_ is chiefly devoted to colonial social life. In the\r\npreparation of the chapter upon Colonial Governments, we have obtained\r\nthe most assistance from the first volume of Story's _Commentaries upon\r\nthe Constitution_. Pages 15 to 50 of Hannis Taylor's _Origin and Growth\r\nof the English Constitution_ are important. Fiske's _Beginnings of New\r\nEngland_ is an extremely interesting description of the early history of\r\na single section. Steps Toward Union and Independence.\r\n\r\nSee especially Story's _Commentaries_; Frothingham's _Rise of the\r\nRepublic of the United States_; Scott's _Development of Constitutional\r\nLiberty in the English Colonies in America_; Fiske's _Critical Period of\r\nAmerican History_; and A.B. Hart's _Formation of the Union_, 1763-1829,\r\nto appear in the series, \"Epochs of American History.\" For the Albany\r\nplan of union see Franklin's _Life and Letters_, Vol. 4. For an account\r\nof the causes leading to revolution written from an essentially English\r\nstandpoint, see Lecky's _History of England in the Eighteenth Century_,\r\nVol. IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticles of Confederation.\r\n\r\nBest upon this subject are: Curtis' _History of the Constitution_;\r\nMarshall's _Life of Washington_; Bancroft's _History of the United\r\nStates_; and Winsor's _Narrative and Critical History of America_, Vol.\r\nVII, article _The Confederation_ by the Editor. See also _Secret\r\nJournals of Congress_, and authorities cited above.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstitutional Convention and the Adoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nSee authorities cited above, and J.A. Jameson's _Treatise on\r\nConstitutional Conventions_. The official sources of information are:\r\nthe meagre _Journal, Acts, and Proceedings of the Convention_; and\r\nElliot's _Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of\r\nthe Federal Constitution_, * * * * _together with the Journal of the\r\nFederal Convention_, the last volume of which contains Madison's notes\r\nof _Debates in the Federal Convention_, frequently called _The Madison\r\nPapers_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe number of valuable works concerned more or less directly with a\r\nstudy of the Constitution is very great. Only a very few can be\r\nmentioned. A very complete list of references to the Constitution, is\r\nthat by W.E. Foster, already referred to. The leading works upon\r\nConstitutional Law are Cooley's _General Principles of Constitutional\r\nLaw_, and _Constitutional Limitations_; Von Holst's, Hare's and\r\nPomeroy's treatises on Constitutional Law. Story's _Commentaries on the\r\nConstitution_ are invaluable. The character and value of _The\r\nFederalist_ have been noticed in the text (p. 25). On Constitutional\r\nAmendments, see Johnston's article on _Amendments_ in Lalor's\r\n_Encyclopaedia_. Concerning Constitutional developments, due to judicial\r\nconstruction, see Willoughby's _Supreme Court of the United States: its\r\nHistory and Influence in our Constitutional System_, published in the\r\nJohns Hopkins Studies, Extra Vol. VII; and _The Constitutional History\r\nof the United States as Seen in the Development of American Law_, by\r\nJudge Cooley and others, edited by H.W. Rogers. _The Unwritten\r\nConstitution of the United States,_ is the title of a very recent book\r\nby C.G. Tiedeman.\r\n\r\nFor constitutional development due to war experiences, see Dunning's\r\n_United States in Civil War and in Reconstruction_. W.E. Foster has in\r\npress a pamphlet of references on _The United States Constitution in\r\nCivil War_.\r\n\r\nOn Federal Government, see Jellinek's _Die Lehre von den\r\nStaatenverbindungen_; and Hart's _Introduction to the Study of Federal\r\nGovernment_, Harvard Historical Monographs, No. 2. Besides giving an\r\noutline of the political history of the successive federations in the\r\nworld's history, with an account of the literature upon each, Mr. Hart's\r\nmonograph contains a very excellent bibliographical note on Federal\r\nGovernment in general, and the United States Constitution in particular.\r\n\r\nThe laws of the United States are known as _United States Statutes at\r\nLarge_. In 1878 was published a large volume containing all Federal laws\r\nin force in 1874. In 1881 was published a Supplement (known as\r\n_Richardson's Supplement_) containing congressional legislation during\r\nthe years 1874--1881.\r\n\r\n\r\nCongressional Government.\r\n\r\nThe official reports of the debates of Congress have been published\r\nunder the following titles: _Annals of Congress_ (1789--1823),\r\n_Congressional Debates_ (1824-1837), _Congressional Globe_ (1833-1873),\r\n_Congressional Record_ (1873 to the present time). Benton's _Abridgment\r\nof Debates_ in 16 volumes covers the period 1789 to 1850.\r\n\r\nMcPherson's _Handbook of Politics_, already cited, contains accounts of\r\nthe more important debates in Congress. Printed copies of bills and\r\nreports of committees can be obtained upon application. For the best\r\ndescriptions of the practical working of Congress, see Bryce's _American\r\nCommonwealth_, and Woodrow Wilson's _Congressional Government_. In both\r\nof these works our committee method of congressional legislation is\r\ncompared with the English method of Parliamentary legislation under the\r\nleadership of a responsible ministry. The conclusions obtained from this\r\ncomparison by the latter author, are especially unfavorable to the\r\nUnited States. Other references to works comparing English and American\r\nmethods of legislation, are Snow's _Defence of Congressional\r\nGovernment_, published in the papers of the American Historical\r\nAssociation, Vol. IV; A.L. Lowell's _Essays on Government_; Bagehot's\r\n_English Constitution_; Bourinot's article, _Canada and the United\r\nStates, Scottish Review_, July, 1890, and Annals of the American Academy\r\nof Social Science, No. I; and an article by Hon. Joseph Chamberlain,\r\n_Shall We Americanize Our Institutions?_ Nineteenth Century, December,\r\n1890. _The Congressional Directory_, published annually, contains much\r\nhandy information regarding the constitution and officers of Congress,\r\nand of the various federal departments at Washington. For an account of\r\nthe work done during the last session (1889-90), see _North American\r\nReview_, November, 1890. Regarding the recent controversy on the power\r\nof the Speaker of the House of Representatives to count as present\r\nmembers in the hall, but not answering to the roll-call, see the _North\r\nAmerican Review_ for October, 1889; the Nos. for March, May, July,\r\nAugust and October, 1890, also contain interesting articles on the same\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\r\nExecutive Departments.\r\n\r\nOf especial and authoritative value is the report of a select committee\r\nof the Senate to _Enquire into and Examine the Methods of Business and\r\nWork in the Executive Departments_, in 3 vols., known as Cockrell's\r\nReport, or Senate Report 507, 50th Cong., 1st Sess., and also a\r\nsupplementary report in one volume, dated March 28, 1889. For other\r\nofficial sources of information, see the annual reports of the various\r\ndepartments, and of the individual bureaus. See also special reports\r\nmentioned in the text. On diplomatic relations, see the annual report of\r\nthe Secretary of State _On Foreign Relations_, and _Treaties and\r\nConventions between the United States and Other Powers_ (1776-1887),\r\npublished by the same department. The _Consular Reports_, issued from\r\ntime to time by the State Department, are of value as furnishing\r\neconomic information regarding foreign countries. The reports of the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury are of extreme statistical and financial\r\nvalue. For handy use the _Statistical Abstract_ is issued annually by\r\nthe Treasury Department. The reports published by the Department of\r\nState, of the _International Conferences of 1878_, and of _1881_, and\r\nthat of Edward Atkinson on _The Present Status of Bimetalism in Europe_\r\n(1887), are of especial value upon monetary topics. In 1886 the Treasury\r\nDepartment issued a volume of _Laws Relating to Loans, and the Currency,\r\nCoinage and Banking_. Besides his annual report the Director of the Mint\r\npublishes annually a report on the _Production of Gold and Silver in the\r\nUnited States_. For an account of the Sub-Treasury system, see Bolle's\r\n_Financial History of the United States_. Concerning the evils of this\r\nsystem, see an article by Prof. J.L. Laughlin in the _North American\r\nReview_, Vol. 137, p. 552.\r\n\r\nRegarding the Silver Question and other important public questions\r\ncoming within the province of the Treasury Department, information can\r\nbe derived from recent periodicals. Poole's _Index to Periodical\r\nLiterature_ should also be consulted. An interesting account of the\r\nPension Office is contained in the _Atlantic Monthly_, January, 1890.\r\nRegarding the Interstate Commerce Commission, see the book by Don Passes\r\nin Putnam's \"Questions of the Day\" series. See also Political Science\r\nQuarterly, Vol. II, pp. 223 and 369.\r\n\r\nThe Eleventh Census is now being compiled, and Bulletins are issued from\r\ntime to time by the superintendent. Postmaster-General Wanamaker has\r\nrecently issued a pamphlet in support of a _Limited Post and Telegraph_.\r\n\r\nConcerning the constitutional powers possessed by executive officers,\r\nsee A. Conkling's _Powers of the Executive Departments_; de Chambrun's\r\n_The Executive Power,_ and chapter VII of Willoughby's _Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States_. The _Official Register of the United States_, issued\r\nannually in two large volumes, contains the names and positions of all\r\npersons in federal employment. The second volume is devoted exclusively\r\nto the Postal Service. Very many of the government reports mentioned in\r\nthis note will be sent to any address upon application.\r\n\r\n_A descriptive catalogue of all government publications_ arranged in\r\nchronological order, from 1774 to 1881, was prepared by B.P. Poore and\r\npublished by the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal Judiciary.\r\n\r\nAmong the treatises upon the practical working of the Federal Judiciary\r\nare: B.R. Curtis' _Federal Courts_; Bryce's _American Commonwealth_; and\r\nWilloughby's _Supreme Court of the United States_, already referred to.\r\nFor an excellent description of the relations between the Federal and\r\nState courts, see Chamberlain's lecture published in _The Constitutional\r\nHistory of the United States as seen in the Development of its Law_. The\r\nreports of decisions of cases tried in the Supreme Court are contained\r\nin one hundred and thirty-three volumes. Until 1875, these volumes were\r\nknown by the names of the reporters, viz.: Dallas, Cranch, Wheaton,\r\nPeters, Howard, Black, and Wallace. Since 1875 they have been designated\r\nsimply as _United States Reports_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinance of 1787.\r\n\r\nFor text and comments see _Old South Leaflet_ No 13 (Heath & Co., price\r\nfive cents). For _The United States Constitution and the Ordinance of_\r\n1787 _in Relation to Education_, see Magazine of American History,\r\nSeptember, 1888.

Prof. Gniest has a suggestive article on Berlin, the\r\nbest governed city in the world, in the _Contemporary Review_, Vol. 46.\r\nShaw's article on Glasgow in the Century, March, 1890, is likewise\r\ninstructive.

See also\r\nJohnston's admirable manual, _History of American Politics_, a book\r\nespecially adapted for school use. Von Holst's _Constitutional and\r\nPolitical History of the United States_, six volumes, contains the most\r\ncomprehensive treatment of the history of political parties. Schouler's\r\n_History of the United States under the Constitution_, is an exceedingly\r\nable and interesting work. Four volumes bring this history down to 1847.\r\nThe fifth volume soon to appear, will bring the narrative down to the\r\nCivil War.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of Von Holst is especially interesting, as giving\r\nstatements of the various theories held regarding the origin and nature\r\nof our constitution. Upon Nullification and Secession, see Von Holst's\r\n_Life of Calhoun_; Stephens' _War between the States_; Greeley's\r\n_American Conflict_; McPherson's _Political History of the Rebellion_;\r\nand articles in Lalor's _Encyclopaedia_. The _American Statesman\r\nSeries_, now being published by Houghton, Mifflin & Co., contains\r\nvaluable biographies of leading American statesmen. See especially in\r\nthis series Schurz's _Henry Clay_; Morse's _Jefferson_; Lodge's\r\n_Webster_; and Von Holst's _Calhoun_. Upon the Economic contrasts\r\nbetween the North and South, see Von Holst's Constitutional History,\r\nVol. I, Chapters IX and X. Taussig's _History of the Tariff_, gives the\r\nbest history of this much debated subject.",
