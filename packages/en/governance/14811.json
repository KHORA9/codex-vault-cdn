I did not write this book at\r\nall. It is the result of the editorial literary skill of Mr. William\r\nBayard Hale, who has put together here in their right sequences the more\r\nsuggestive portions of my campaign speeches.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is not a book of campaign speeches. It is a discussion of a\r\nnumber of very vital subjects in the free form of extemporaneously spoken\r\nwords. I have left the sentences in the form in which they were\r\nstenographically reported. I have not tried to alter the easy-going and\r\noften colloquial phraseology in which they were uttered from the platform,\r\nin the hope that they would seem the more fresh and spontaneous because of\r\ntheir very lack of pruning and recasting. They have been suffered to run\r\ntheir unpremeditated course even at the cost of such repetition and\r\nredundancy as the extemporaneous speaker apparently inevitably falls\r\ninto.\r\n\r\nThe book is not a discussion of measures or of programs. It is an attempt\r\nto express the new spirit of our politics and to set forth, in large terms\r\nwhich may stick in the imagination, what it is that must be done if we are\r\nto restore our politics to their full spiritual vigor again, and our\r\nnational life, whether in trade, in industry, or in what concerns us only\r\nas families and individuals, to its purity, its self-respect, and its\r\npristine strength and freedom. The New Freedom is only the old revived and\r\nclothed in the unconquerable strength of modern America.\r\n\r\nWOODROW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n      Preface                                             vii\r\n\r\nCHAPTER                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n   I.

That singular\r\nfact is that nothing is done in this country as it was done twenty years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nWe are in the presence of a new organization of society. Our life has\r\nbroken away from the past. The life of America is not the life that it was\r\ntwenty years ago; it is not the life that it was ten years ago. We have\r\nchanged our economic conditions, absolutely, from top to bottom; and, with\r\nour economic society, the organization of our life. The old political\r\nformulas do not fit the present problems; they read now like documents\r\ntaken out of a forgotten age. The older cries sound as if they belonged to\r\na past age which men have almost forgotten. Things which used to be put\r\ninto the party platforms of ten years ago would sound antiquated if put\r\ninto a platform now. We are facing the necessity of fitting a new social\r\norganization, as we did once fit the old organization, to the happiness\r\nand prosperity of the great body of citizens; for we are conscious that\r\nthe new order of society has not been made to fit and provide the\r\nconvenience or prosperity of the average man. The life of the nation has\r\ngrown infinitely varied. It does not centre now upon questions of\r\ngovernmental structure or of the distribution of governmental powers. It\r\ncentres upon questions of the very structure and operation of society\r\nitself, of which government is only the instrument. Our development has\r\nrun so fast and so far along the lines sketched in the earlier day of\r\nconstitutional definition, has so crossed and interlaced those lines, has\r\npiled upon them such novel structures of trust and combination, has\r\nelaborated within them a life so manifold, so full of forces which\r\ntranscend the boundaries of the country itself and fill the eyes of the\r\nworld, that a new nation seems to have been created which the old formulas\r\ndo not fit or afford a vital interpretation of.\r\n\r\nWe have come upon a very different age from any that preceded us. We have\r\ncome upon an age when we do not do business in the way in which we used to\r\ndo business,--when we do not carry on any of the operations of\r\nmanufacture, sale, transportation, or communication as men used to carry\r\nthem on. There is a sense in which in our day the individual has been\r\nsubmerged. In most parts of our country men work, not for themselves, not\r\nas partners in the old way in which they used to work, but generally as\r\nemployees,--in a higher or lower grade,--of great corporations. There was\r\na time when corporations played a very minor part in our business affairs,\r\nbut now they play the chief part, and most men are the servants of\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\nYou know what happens when you are the servant of a corporation. You have\r\nin no instance access to the men who are really determining the policy of\r\nthe corporation. If the corporation is doing the things that it ought not\r\nto do, you really have no voice in the matter and must obey the orders,\r\nand you have oftentimes with deep mortification to co-operate in the doing\r\nof things which you know are against the public interest. Your\r\nindividuality is swallowed up in the individuality and purpose of a great\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, while most men are thus submerged in the corporation, a\r\nfew, a very few, are exalted to a power which as individuals they could\r\nnever have wielded. Through the great organizations of which they are the\r\nheads, a few are enabled to play a part unprecedented by anything in\r\nhistory in the control of the business operations of the country and in\r\nthe determination of the happiness of great numbers of people.\r\n\r\nYesterday, and ever since history began, men were related to one another\r\nas individuals. To be sure there were the family, the Church, and the\r\nState, institutions which associated men in certain wide circles of\r\nrelationship. But in the ordinary concerns of life, in the ordinary work,\r\nin the daily round, men dealt freely and directly with one another.\r\nTo-day, the everyday relationships of men are largely with great\r\nimpersonal concerns, with organizations, not with other individual men.\r\n\r\nNow this is nothing short of a new social age, a new era of human\r\nrelationships, a new stage-setting for the drama of life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn this new age we find, for instance, that our laws with regard to the\r\nrelations of employer and employee are in many respects wholly antiquated\r\nand impossible. They were framed for another age, which nobody now living\r\nremembers, which is, indeed, so remote from our life that it would be\r\ndifficult for many of us to understand it if it were described to us. The\r\nemployer is now generally a corporation or a huge company of some kind;\r\nthe employee is one of hundreds or of thousands brought together, not by\r\nindividual masters whom they know and with whom they have personal\r\nrelations, but by agents of one sort or another. Workingmen are marshaled\r\nin great numbers for the performance of a multitude of particular tasks\r\nunder a common discipline. They generally use dangerous and powerful\r\nmachinery, over whose repair and renewal they have no control. New rules\r\nmust be devised with regard to their obligations and their rights, their\r\nobligations to their employers and their responsibilities to one another.\r\nRules must be devised for their protection, for their compensation when\r\ninjured, for their support when disabled.\r\n\r\nThere is something very new and very big and very complex about these new\r\nrelations of capital and labor. A new economic society has sprung up, and\r\nwe must effect a new set of adjustments. We must not pit power against\r\nweakness. The employer is generally, in our day, as I have said, not an\r\nindividual, but a powerful group; and yet the workingman when dealing with\r\nhis employer is still, under our existing law, an individual.\r\n\r\nWhy is it that we have a labor question at all? It is for the simple and\r\nvery sufficient reason that the laboring man and the employer are not\r\nintimate associates now as they used to be in time past. Most of our laws\r\nwere formed in the age when employer and employees knew each other, knew\r\neach other's characters, were associates with each other, dealt with each\r\nother as man with man. That is no longer the case. You not only do not\r\ncome into personal contact with the men who have the supreme command in\r\nthose corporations, but it would be out of the question for you to do it.\r\nOur modern corporations employ thousands, and in some instances hundreds\r\nof thousands, of men. The only persons whom you see or deal with are local\r\nsuperintendents or local representatives of a vast organization, which is\r\nnot like anything that the workingmen of the time in which our laws were\r\nframed knew anything about. A little group of workingmen, seeing their\r\nemployer every day, dealing with him in a personal way, is one thing, and\r\nthe modern body of labor engaged as employees of the huge enterprises that\r\nspread all over the country, dealing with men of whom they can form no\r\npersonal conception, is another thing. A very different thing. You never\r\nsaw a corporation, any more than you ever saw a government. Many a\r\nworkingman to-day never saw the body of men who are conducting the\r\nindustry in which he is employed. And they never saw him. What they know\r\nabout him is written in ledgers and books and letters, in the\r\ncorrespondence of the office, in the reports of the superintendents. He is\r\na long way off from them.\r\n\r\nSo what we have to discuss is, not wrongs which individuals intentionally\r\ndo,--I do not believe there are a great many of those,--but the wrongs of\r\na system. I want to record my protest against any discussion of this\r\nmatter which would seem to indicate that there are bodies of our\r\nfellow-citizens who are trying to grind us down and do us injustice. There\r\nare some men of that sort. I don't know how they sleep o' nights, but\r\nthere are men of that kind. Thank God, they are not numerous. The truth\r\nis, we are all caught in a great economic system which is heartless. The\r\nmodern corporation is not engaged in business as an individual. When we\r\ndeal with it, we deal with an impersonal element, an immaterial piece of\r\nsociety. A modern corporation is a means of co-operation in the conduct of\r\nan enterprise which is so big that no one man can conduct it, and which\r\nthe resources of no one man are sufficient to finance. A company is\r\nformed; that company puts out a prospectus; the promoters expect to raise\r\na certain fund as capital stock. Well, how are they going to raise it?\r\nThey are going to raise it from the public in general, some of whom will\r\nbuy their stock. The moment that begins, there is formed--what? A joint\r\nstock corporation. Men begin to pool their earnings, little piles, big\r\npiles. A certain number of men are elected by the stockholders to be\r\ndirectors, and these directors elect a president. This president is the\r\nhead of the undertaking, and the directors are its managers.\r\n\r\nNow, do the workingmen employed by that stock corporation deal with that\r\npresident and those directors? Not at all. Does the public deal with that\r\npresident and that board of directors? It does not. Can anybody bring them\r\nto account? It is next to impossible to do so. If you undertake it you\r\nwill find it a game of hide and seek, with the objects of your search\r\ntaking refuge now behind the tree of their individual personality, now\r\nbehind that of their corporate irresponsibility.\r\n\r\nAnd do our laws take note of this curious state of things? Do they even\r\nattempt to distinguish between a man's act as a corporation director and\r\nas an individual? They do not. Our laws still deal with us on the basis of\r\nthe old system. The law is still living in the dead past which we have\r\nleft behind. This is evident, for instance, with regard to the matter of\r\nemployers' liability for workingmen's injuries. Suppose that a\r\nsuperintendent wants a workman to use a certain piece of machinery which\r\nit is not safe for him to use, and that the workman is injured by that\r\npiece of machinery. Some of our courts have held that the superintendent\r\nis a fellow-servant, or, as the law states it, a fellow-employee, and\r\nthat, therefore, the man cannot recover damages for his injury. The\r\nsuperintendent who probably engaged the man is not his employer. Who is\r\nhis employer? And whose negligence could conceivably come in there? The\r\nboard of directors did not tell the employee to use that piece of\r\nmachinery; and the president of the corporation did not tell him to use\r\nthat piece of machinery. And so forth. Don't you see by that theory that a\r\nman never can get redress for negligence on the part of the employer? When\r\nI hear judges reason upon the analogy of the relationships that used to\r\nexist between workmen and their employers a generation ago, I wonder if\r\nthey have not opened their eyes to the modern world. You know, we have a\r\nright to expect that judges will have their eyes open, even though the law\r\nwhich they administer hasn't awakened.\r\n\r\nYet that is but a single small detail illustrative of the difficulties we\r\nare in because we have not adjusted the law to the facts of the new order.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince I entered politics, I have chiefly had men's views confided to me\r\nprivately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of\r\ncommerce and manufacture, are afraid of somebody, are afraid of something.\r\nThey know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so\r\nwatchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better\r\nnot speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\r\n\r\nThey know that America is not a place of which it can be said, as it used\r\nto be, that a man may choose his own calling and pursue it just as far as\r\nhis abilities enable him to pursue it; because to-day, if he enters\r\ncertain fields, there are organizations which will use means against him\r\nthat will prevent his building up a business which they do not want to\r\nhave built up; organizations that will see to it that the ground is cut\r\nfrom under him and the markets shut against him. For if he begins to sell\r\nto certain retail dealers, to any retail dealers, the monopoly will refuse\r\nto sell to those dealers, and those dealers, afraid, will not buy the new\r\nman's wares.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the country which has lifted to the admiration of the world\r\nits ideals of absolutely free opportunity, where no man is supposed to be\r\nunder any limitation except the limitations of his character and of his\r\nmind; where there is supposed to be no distinction of class, no\r\ndistinction of blood, no distinction of social status, but where men win\r\nor lose on their merits.\r\n\r\nI lay it very close to my own conscience as a public man whether we can\r\nany longer stand at our doors and welcome all newcomers upon those terms.\r\nAmerican industry is not free, as once it was free; American enterprise is\r\nnot free; the man with only a little capital is finding it harder to get\r\ninto the field, more and more impossible to compete with the big fellow.\r\nWhy? Because the laws of this country do not prevent the strong from\r\ncrushing the weak. That is the reason, and because the strong have crushed\r\nthe weak the strong dominate the industry and the economic life of this\r\ncountry. No man can deny that the lines of endeavor have more and more\r\nnarrowed and stiffened; no man who knows anything about the development of\r\nindustry in this country can have failed to observe that the larger kinds\r\nof credit are more and more difficult to obtain, unless you obtain them\r\nupon the terms of uniting your efforts with those who already control the\r\nindustries of the country; and nobody can fail to observe that any man\r\nwho tries to set himself up in competition with any process of manufacture\r\nwhich has been taken under the control of large combinations of capital\r\nwill presently find himself either squeezed out or obliged to sell and\r\nallow himself to be absorbed.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal that needs reconstruction in the United States. I\r\nshould like to take a census of the business men,--I mean the rank and\r\nfile of the business men,--as to whether they think that business\r\nconditions in this country, or rather whether the organization of business\r\nin this country, is satisfactory or not. I know what they would say if\r\nthey dared. If they could vote secretly they would vote overwhelmingly\r\nthat the present organization of business was meant for the big fellows\r\nand was not meant for the little fellows; that it was meant for those who\r\nare at the top and was meant to exclude those who are at the bottom; that\r\nit was meant to shut out beginners, to prevent new entries in the race, to\r\nprevent the building up of competitive enterprises that would interfere\r\nwith the monopolies which the great trusts have built up.\r\n\r\nWhat this country needs above everything else is a body of laws which will\r\nlook after the men who are on the make rather than the men who are already\r\nmade. Because the men who are already made are not going to live\r\nindefinitely, and they are not always kind enough to leave sons as able\r\nand as honest as they are.\r\n\r\nThe originative part of America, the part of America that makes new\r\nenterprises, the part into which the ambitious and gifted workingman makes\r\nhis way up, the class that saves, that plans, that organizes, that\r\npresently spreads its enterprises until they have a national scope and\r\ncharacter,--that middle class is being more and more squeezed out by the\r\nprocesses which we have been taught to call processes of prosperity. Its\r\nmembers are sharing prosperity, no doubt; but what alarms me is that they\r\nare not _originating_ prosperity. No country can afford to have its\r\nprosperity originated by a small controlling class. The treasury of\r\nAmerica does not lie in the brains of the small body of men now in\r\ncontrol of the great enterprises that have been concentrated under the\r\ndirection of a very small number of persons. The treasury of America lies\r\nin those ambitions, those energies, that cannot be restricted to a special\r\nfavored class. It depends upon the inventions of unknown men, upon the\r\noriginations of unknown men, upon the ambitions of unknown men. Every\r\ncountry is renewed out of the ranks of the unknown, not out of the ranks\r\nof those already famous and powerful and in control.\r\n\r\nThere has come over the land that un-American set of conditions which\r\nenables a small number of men who control the government to get favors\r\nfrom the government; by those favors to exclude their fellows from equal\r\nbusiness opportunity; by those favors to extend a network of control that\r\nwill presently dominate every industry in the country, and so make men\r\nforget the ancient time when America lay in every hamlet, when America was\r\nto be seen in every fair valley, when America displayed her great forces\r\non the broad prairies, ran her fine fires of enterprise up over the\r\nmountain-sides and down into the bowels of the earth, and eager men were\r\neverywhere captains of industry, not employees; not looking to a distant\r\ncity to find out what they might do, but looking about among their\r\nneighbors, finding credit according to their character, not according to\r\ntheir connections, finding credit in proportion to what was known to be in\r\nthem and behind them, not in proportion to the securities they held that\r\nwere approved where they were not known. In order to start an enterprise\r\nnow, you have to be authenticated, in a perfectly impersonal way, not\r\naccording to yourself, but according to what you own that somebody else\r\napproves of your owning. You cannot begin such an enterprise as those that\r\nhave made America until you are so authenticated, until you have succeeded\r\nin obtaining the good-will of large allied capitalists. Is that freedom?\r\nThat is dependence, not freedom.\r\n\r\nWe used to think in the old-fashioned days when life was very simple that\r\nall that government had to do was to put on a policeman's uniform, and\r\nsay, \"Now don't anybody hurt anybody else.\" We used to say that the ideal\r\nof government was for every man to be left alone and not interfered with,\r\nexcept when he interfered with somebody else; and that the best government\r\nwas the government that did as little governing as possible. That was the\r\nidea that obtained in Jefferson's time. But we are coming now to realize\r\nthat life is so complicated that we are not dealing with the old\r\nconditions, and that the law has to step in and create new conditions\r\nunder which we may live, the conditions which will make it tolerable for\r\nus to live.\r\n\r\nLet me illustrate what I mean: It used to be true in our cities that every\r\nfamily occupied a separate house of its own, that every family had its own\r\nlittle premises, that every family was separated in its life from every\r\nother family. That is no longer the case in our great cities. Families\r\nlive in tenements, they live in flats, they live on floors; they are piled\r\nlayer upon layer in the great tenement houses of our crowded districts,\r\nand not only are they piled layer upon layer, but they are associated room\r\nby room, so that there is in every room, sometimes, in our congested\r\ndistricts, a separate family. In some foreign countries they have made\r\nmuch more progress than we in handling these things. In the city of\r\nGlasgow, for example (Glasgow is one of the model cities of the world),\r\nthey have made up their minds that the entries and the hallways of great\r\ntenements are public streets. Therefore, the policeman goes up the\r\nstairway, and patrols the corridors; the lighting department of the city\r\nsees to it that the halls are abundantly lighted. The city does not\r\ndeceive itself into supposing that that great building is a unit from\r\nwhich the police are to keep out and the civic authority to be excluded,\r\nbut it says: \"These are public highways, and light is needed in them, and\r\ncontrol by the authority of the city.\"\r\n\r\nI liken that to our great modern industrial enterprises. A corporation is\r\nvery like a large tenement house; it isn't the premises of a single\r\ncommercial family; it is just as much a public affair as a tenement house\r\nis a network of public highways.\r\n\r\nWhen you offer the securities of a great corporation to anybody who wishes\r\nto purchase them, you must open that corporation to the inspection of\r\neverybody who wants to purchase. There must, to follow out the figure of\r\nthe tenement house, be lights along the corridors, there must be police\r\npatrolling the openings, there must be inspection wherever it is known\r\nthat men may be deceived with regard to the contents of the premises. If\r\nwe believe that fraud lies in wait for us, we must have the means of\r\ndetermining whether our suspicions are well founded or not. Similarly, the\r\ntreatment of labor by the great corporations is not what it was in\r\nJefferson's time. Whenever bodies of men employ bodies of men, it ceases\r\nto be a private relationship. So that when courts hold that workingmen\r\ncannot peaceably dissuade other workingmen from taking employment, as was\r\nheld in a notable case in New Jersey, they simply show that their minds\r\nand understandings are lingering in an age which has passed away. This\r\ndealing of great bodies of men with other bodies of men is a matter of\r\npublic scrutiny, and should be a matter of public regulation.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it was no business of the law in the time of Jefferson to come\r\ninto my house and see how I kept house. But when my house, when my\r\nso-called private property, became a great mine, and men went along dark\r\ncorridors amidst every kind of danger in order to dig out of the bowels of\r\nthe earth things necessary for the industries of a whole nation, and when\r\nit came about that no individual owned these mines, that they were owned\r\nby great stock companies, then all the old analogies absolutely collapsed\r\nand it became the right of the government to go down into these mines to\r\nsee whether human beings were properly treated in them or not; to see\r\nwhether accidents were properly safeguarded against; to see whether modern\r\neconomical methods of using these inestimable riches of the earth were\r\nfollowed or were not followed. If somebody puts a derrick improperly\r\nsecured on top of a building or overtopping the street, then the\r\ngovernment of the city has the right to see that that derrick is so\r\nsecured that you and I can walk under it and not be afraid that the\r\nheavens are going to fall on us. Likewise, in these great beehives where\r\nin every corridor swarm men of flesh and blood, it is the privilege of the\r\ngovernment, whether of the State or of the United States, as the case may\r\nbe, to see that human life is protected, that human lungs have something\r\nto breathe.\r\n\r\nThese, again, are merely illustrations of conditions. We are in a new\r\nworld, struggling under old laws. As we go inspecting our lives to-day,\r\nsurveying this new scene of centralized and complex society, we shall find\r\nmany more things out of joint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most alarming phenomena of the time,--or rather it would be\r\nalarming if the nation had not awakened to it and shown its determination\r\nto control it,--one of the most significant signs of the new social era is\r\nthe degree to which government has become associated with business. I\r\nspeak, for the moment, of the control over the government exercised by Big\r\nBusiness. Behind the whole subject, of course, is the truth that, in the\r\nnew order, government and business must be associated closely. But that\r\nassociation is at present of a nature absolutely intolerable; the\r\nprecedence is wrong, the association is upside down. Our government has\r\nbeen for the past few years under the control of heads of great allied\r\ncorporations with special interests. It has not controlled these interests\r\nand assigned them a proper place in the whole system of business; it has\r\nsubmitted itself to their control. As a result, there have grown up\r\nvicious systems and schemes of governmental favoritism (the most obvious\r\nbeing the extravagant tariff), far-reaching in effect upon the whole\r\nfabric of life, touching to his injury every inhabitant of the land,\r\nlaying unfair and impossible handicaps upon competitors, imposing taxes in\r\nevery direction, stifling everywhere the free spirit of American\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nNow this has come about naturally; as we go on we shall see how very\r\nnaturally. It is no use denouncing anybody, or anything, except human\r\nnature. Nevertheless, it is an intolerable thing that the government of\r\nthe republic should have got so far out of the hands of the people; should\r\nhave been captured by interests which are special and not general. In the\r\ntrain of this capture follow the troops of scandals, wrongs, indecencies,\r\nwith which our politics swarm.\r\n\r\nThere are cities in America of whose government we are ashamed. There are\r\ncities everywhere, in every part of the land, in which we feel that, not\r\nthe interests of the public, but the interests of special privileges, of\r\nselfish men, are served; where contracts take precedence over public\r\ninterest. Not only in big cities is this the case. Have you not noticed\r\nthe growth of socialistic sentiment in the smaller towns? Not many months\r\nago I stopped at a little town in Nebraska, and while my train lingered I\r\nmet on the platform a very engaging young fellow dressed in overalls who\r\nintroduced himself to me as the mayor of the town, and added that he was\r\na Socialist. I said, \"What does that mean? Does that mean that this town\r\nis socialistic?\" \"No, sir,\" he said; \"I have not deceived myself; the vote\r\nby which I was elected was about 20 per cent. socialistic and 80 per cent.\r\nprotest.\" It was protest against the treachery to the people of those who\r\nled both the other parties of that town.\r\n\r\nAll over the Union people are coming to feel that they have no control\r\nover the course of affairs. I live in one of the greatest States in the\r\nunion, which was at one time in slavery. Until two years ago we had\r\nwitnessed with increasing concern the growth in New Jersey of a spirit of\r\nalmost cynical despair. Men said: \"We vote; we are offered the platform we\r\nwant; we elect the men who stand on that platform, and we get absolutely\r\nnothing.\" So they began to ask: \"What is the use of voting? We know that\r\nthe machines of both parties are subsidized by the same persons, and\r\ntherefore it is useless to turn in either direction.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not confined to some of the state governments and those of some of\r\nthe towns and cities. We know that something intervenes between the\r\npeople of the United States and the control of their own affairs at\r\nWashington. It is not the people who have been ruling there of late.\r\n\r\nWhy are we in the presence, why are we at the threshold, of a revolution?\r\nBecause we are profoundly disturbed by the influences which we see\r\nreigning in the determination of our public life and our public policy.\r\nThere was a time when America was blithe with self-confidence. She boasted\r\nthat she, and she alone, knew the processes of popular government; but now\r\nshe sees her sky overcast; she sees that there are at work forces which\r\nshe did not dream of in her hopeful youth.\r\n\r\nDon't you know that some man with eloquent tongue, without conscience, who\r\ndid not care for the nation, could put this whole country into a flame?\r\nDon't you know that this country from one end to the other believes that\r\nsomething is wrong? What an opportunity it would be for some man without\r\nconscience to spring up and say: \"This is the way. Follow me!\"--and lead\r\nin paths of destruction!\r\n\r\nThe old order changeth--changeth under our very eyes, not quietly and\r\nequably, but swiftly and with the noise and heat and tumult of\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nI suppose that all struggle for law has been conscious, that very little\r\nof it has been blind or merely instinctive. It is the fashion to say, as\r\nif with superior knowledge of affairs and of human weakness, that every\r\nage has been an age of transition, and that no age is more full of change\r\nthan another; yet in very few ages of the world can the struggle for\r\nchange have been so widespread, so deliberate, or upon so great a scale as\r\nin this in which we are taking part.\r\n\r\nThe transition we are witnessing is no equable transition of growth and\r\nnormal alteration; no silent, unconscious unfolding of one age into\r\nanother, its natural heir and successor. Society is looking itself over,\r\nin our day, from top to bottom; is making fresh and critical analysis of\r\nits very elements; is questioning its oldest practices as freely as its\r\nnewest, scrutinizing every arrangement and motive of its life; and it\r\nstands ready to attempt nothing less than a radical reconstruction, which\r\nonly frank and honest counsels and the forces of generous co-operation can\r\nhold back from becoming a revolution. We are in a temper to reconstruct\r\neconomic society, as we were once in a temper to reconstruct political\r\nsociety, and political society may itself undergo a radical modification\r\nin the process. I doubt if any age was ever more conscious of its task or\r\nmore unanimously desirous of radical and extended changes in its economic\r\nand political practice.\r\n\r\nWe stand in the presence of a revolution,--not a bloody revolution;\r\nAmerica is not given to the spilling of blood,--but a silent revolution,\r\nwhereby America will insist upon recovering in practice those ideals which\r\nshe has always professed, upon securing a government devoted to the\r\ngeneral interest and not to special interests.\r\n\r\nWe are upon the eve of a great reconstruction. It calls for creative\r\nstatesmanship as no age has done since that great age in which we set up\r\nthe government under which we live, that government which was the\r\nadmiration of the world until it suffered wrongs to grow up under it\r\nwhich have made many of our own compatriots question the freedom of our\r\ninstitutions and preach revolution against them. I do not fear revolution.\r\nI have unshaken faith in the power of America to keep its self-possession.\r\nRevolution will come in peaceful guise, as it came when we put aside the\r\ncrude government of the Confederation and created the great Federal Union\r\nwhich governs individuals, not States, and which has been these hundred\r\nand thirty years our vehicle of progress. Some radical changes we must\r\nmake in our law and practice. Some reconstructions we must push forward,\r\nwhich a new age and new circumstances impose upon us. But we can do it all\r\nin calm and sober fashion, like statesmen and patriots.\r\n\r\nI do not speak of these things in apprehension, because all is open and\r\nabove-board. This is not a day in which great forces rally in secret. The\r\nwhole stupendous program must be publicly planned and canvassed. Good\r\ntemper, the wisdom that comes of sober counsel, the energy of thoughtful\r\nand unselfish men, the habit of co-operation and of compromise which has\r\nbeen bred in us by long years of free government, in which reason rather\r\nthan passion has been made to prevail by the sheer virtue of candid and\r\nuniversal debate, will enable us to win through to still another great age\r\nwithout violence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWHAT IS PROGRESS?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that sage and veracious chronicle, \"Alice Through the Looking-Glass,\"\r\nit is recounted how, on a noteworthy occasion, the little heroine is\r\nseized by the Red Chess Queen, who races her off at a terrific pace. They\r\nrun until both of them are out of breath; then they stop, and Alice looks\r\naround her and says, \"Why, we are just where we were when we started!\"\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" says the Red Queen; \"you have to run twice as fast as that to\r\nget anywhere else.\"\r\n\r\nThat is a parable of progress. The laws of this country have not kept up\r\nwith the change of economic circumstances in this country; they have not\r\nkept up with the change of political circumstances; and therefore we are\r\nnot even where we were when we started. We shall have to run, not until we\r\nare out of breath, but until we have caught up with our own conditions,\r\nbefore we shall be where we were when we started; when we started this\r\ngreat experiment which has been the hope and the beacon of the world. And\r\nwe should have to run twice as fast as any rational program I have seen in\r\norder to get anywhere else.\r\n\r\nI am, therefore, forced to be a progressive, if for no other reason,\r\nbecause we have not kept up with our changes of conditions, either in the\r\neconomic field or in the political field. We have not kept up as well as\r\nother nations have. We have not kept our practices adjusted to the facts\r\nof the case, and until we do, and unless we do, the facts of the case will\r\nalways have the better of the argument; because if you do not adjust your\r\nlaws to the facts, so much the worse for the laws, not for the facts,\r\nbecause law trails along after the facts. Only that law is unsafe which\r\nruns ahead of the facts and beckons to it and makes it follow the\r\nwill-o'-the-wisps of imaginative projects.\r\n\r\nBusiness is in a situation in America which it was never in before; it is\r\nin a situation to which we have not adjusted our laws. Our laws are still\r\nmeant for business done by individuals; they have not been satisfactorily\r\nadjusted to business done by great combinations, and we have got to adjust\r\nthem. I do not say we may or may not; I say we must; there is no choice.\r\nIf your laws do not fit your facts, the facts are not injured, the law is\r\ndamaged; because the law, unless I have studied it amiss, is the\r\nexpression of the facts in legal relationships. Laws have never altered\r\nthe facts; laws have always necessarily expressed the facts; adjusted\r\ninterests as they have arisen and have changed toward one another.\r\n\r\nPolitics in America is in a case which sadly requires attention. The\r\nsystem set up by our law and our usage doesn't work,--or at least it can't\r\nbe depended on; it is made to work only by a most unreasonable expenditure\r\nof labor and pains. The government, which was designed for the people, has\r\ngot into the hands of bosses and their employers, the special interests.\r\nAn invisible empire has been set up above the forms of democracy.\r\n\r\nThere are serious things to do. Does any man doubt the great discontent\r\nin this country? Does any man doubt that there are grounds and\r\njustifications for discontent? Do we dare stand still? Within the past few\r\nmonths we have witnessed (along with other strange political phenomena,\r\neloquently significant of popular uneasiness) on one side a doubling of\r\nthe Socialist vote and on the other the posting on dead walls and\r\nhoardings all over the country of certain very attractive and diverting\r\nbills warning citizens that it was \"better to be safe than sorry\" and\r\nadvising them to \"let well enough alone.\" Apparently a good many citizens\r\ndoubted whether the situation they were advised to let alone was really\r\nwell enough, and concluded that they would take a chance of being sorry.\r\nTo me, these counsels of do-nothingism, these counsels of sitting still\r\nfor fear something would happen, these counsels addressed to the hopeful,\r\nenergetic people of the United States, telling them that they are not wise\r\nenough to touch their own affairs without marring them, constitute the\r\nmost extraordinary argument of fatuous ignorance I ever heard. Americans\r\nare not yet cowards. True, their self-reliance has been sapped by years of\r\nsubmission to the doctrine that prosperity is something that benevolent\r\nmagnates provide for them with the aid of the government; their\r\nself-reliance has been weakened, but not so utterly destroyed that you can\r\ntwit them about it. The American people are not naturally stand-patters.\r\nProgress is the word that charms their ears and stirs their hearts.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, Americans who have not yet heard that anything is\r\ngoing on. The circus might come to town, have the big parade and go,\r\nwithout their catching a sight of the camels or a note of the calliope.\r\nThere are people, even Americans, who never move themselves or know that\r\nanything else is moving.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine who had heard of the Florida \"cracker,\" as they call a\r\ncertain ne'er-do-weel portion of the population down there, when passing\r\nthrough the State in a train, asked some one to point out a \"cracker\" to\r\nhim. The man asked replied, \"Well, if you see something off in the woods\r\nthat looks brown, like a stump, you will know it is either a stump or a\r\ncracker; if it moves, it is a stump.\"\r\n\r\nNow, movement has no virtue in itself. Change is not worth while for its\r\nown sake. I am not one of those who love variety for its own sake. If a\r\nthing is good to-day, I should like to have it stay that way to-morrow.\r\nMost of our calculations in life are dependent upon things staying the way\r\nthey are. For example, if, when you got up this morning, you had forgotten\r\nhow to dress, if you had forgotten all about those ordinary things which\r\nyou do almost automatically, which you can almost do half awake, you would\r\nhave to find out what you did yesterday. I am told by the psychologists\r\nthat if I did not remember who I was yesterday, I should not know who I am\r\nto-day, and that, therefore, my very identity depends upon my being able\r\nto tally to-day with yesterday. If they do not tally, then I am confused;\r\nI do not know who I am, and I have to go around and ask somebody to tell\r\nme my name and where I came from.\r\n\r\nI am not one of those who wish to break connection with the past; I am\r\nnot one of those who wish to change for the mere sake of variety. The only\r\nmen who do that are the men who want to forget something, the men who\r\nfilled yesterday with something they would rather not recollect to-day,\r\nand so go about seeking diversion, seeking abstraction in something that\r\nwill blot out recollection, or seeking to put something into them which\r\nwill blot out all recollection. Change is not worth while unless it is\r\nimprovement. If I move out of my present house because I do not like it,\r\nthen I have got to choose a better house, or build a better house, to\r\njustify the change.\r\n\r\nIt would seem a waste of time to point out that ancient\r\ndistinction,--between mere change and improvement. Yet there is a class of\r\nmind that is prone to confuse them. We have had political leaders whose\r\nconception of greatness was to be forever frantically doing something,--it\r\nmattered little what; restless, vociferous men, without sense of the\r\nenergy of concentration, knowing only the energy of succession. Now, life\r\ndoes not consist of eternally running to a fire. There is no virtue in\r\ngoing anywhere unless you will gain something by being there. The\r\ndirection is just as important as the impetus of motion.\r\n\r\nAll progress depends on how fast you are going, and where you are going,\r\nand I fear there has been too much of this thing of knowing neither how\r\nfast we were going or where we were going. I have my private belief that\r\nwe have been doing most of our progressiveness after the fashion of those\r\nthings that in my boyhood days we called \"treadmills,\"--a treadmill being\r\na moving platform, with cleats on it, on which some poor devil of a mule\r\nwas forced to walk forever without getting anywhere. Elephants and even\r\nother animals have been known to turn treadmills, making a good deal of\r\nnoise, and causing certain wheels to go round, and I daresay grinding out\r\nsome sort of product for somebody, but without achieving much progress.\r\nLately, in an effort to persuade the elephant to move, really, his friends\r\ntried dynamite. It moved,--in separate and scattered parts, but it moved.\r\n\r\nA cynical but witty Englishman said, in a book, not long ago, that it was\r\na mistake to say of a conspicuously successful man, eminent in his line of\r\nbusiness, that you could not bribe a man like that, because, he said, the\r\npoint about such men is that they have been bribed--not in the ordinary\r\nmeaning of that word, not in any gross, corrupt sense, but they have\r\nachieved their great success by means of the existing order of things and\r\ntherefore they have been put under bonds to see that that existing order\r\nof things is not changed; they are bribed to maintain the _status quo_.\r\n\r\nIt was for that reason that I used to say, when I had to do with the\r\nadministration of an educational institution, that I should like to make\r\nthe young gentlemen of the rising generation as unlike their fathers as\r\npossible. Not because their fathers lacked character or intelligence or\r\nknowledge or patriotism, but because their fathers, by reason of their\r\nadvancing years and their established position in society, had lost touch\r\nwith the processes of life; they had forgotten what it was to begin; they\r\nhad forgotten what it was to rise; they had forgotten what it was to be\r\ndominated by the circumstances of their life on their way up from the\r\nbottom to the top, and, therefore, they were out of sympathy with the\r\ncreative, formative and progressive forces of society.\r\n\r\nProgress! Did you ever reflect that that word is almost a new one? No word\r\ncomes more often or more naturally to the lips of modern man, as if the\r\nthing it stands for were almost synonymous with life itself, and yet men\r\nthrough many thousand years never talked or thought of progress. They\r\nthought in the other direction. Their stories of heroisms and glory were\r\ntales of the past. The ancestor wore the heavier armor and carried the\r\nlarger spear. \"There were giants in those days.\" Now all that has altered.\r\nWe think of the future, not the past, as the more glorious time in\r\ncomparison with which the present is nothing. Progress,\r\ndevelopment,--those are modern words. The modern idea is to leave the past\r\nand press onward to something new.\r\n\r\nBut what is progress going to do with the past, and with the present? How\r\nis it going to treat them? With ignominy, or respect? Should it break with\r\nthem altogether, or rise out of them, with its roots still deep in the\r\nolder time? What attitude shall progressives take toward the existing\r\norder, toward those institutions of conservatism, the Constitution, the\r\nlaws, and the courts?\r\n\r\nAre those thoughtful men who fear that we are now about to disturb the\r\nancient foundations of our institutions justified in their fear? If they\r\nare, we ought to go very slowly about the processes of change. If it is\r\nindeed true that we have grown tired of the institutions which we have so\r\ncarefully and sedulously built up, then we ought to go very slowly and\r\nvery carefully about the very dangerous task of altering them. We ought,\r\ntherefore, to ask ourselves, first of all, whether thought in this country\r\nis tending to do anything by which we shall retrace our steps, or by which\r\nwe shall change the whole direction of our development?\r\n\r\nI believe, for one, that you cannot tear up ancient rootages and safely\r\nplant the tree of liberty in soil which is not native to it. I believe\r\nthat the ancient traditions of a people are its ballast; you cannot make a\r\n_tabula rasa_ upon which to write a political program. You cannot take a\r\nnew sheet of paper and determine what your life shall be to-morrow. You\r\nmust knit the new into the old. You cannot put a new patch on an old\r\ngarment without ruining it; it must be not a patch, but something woven\r\ninto the old fabric, of practically the same pattern, of the same texture\r\nand intention. If I did not believe that to be progressive was to preserve\r\nthe essentials of our institutions, I for one could not be a progressive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the chief benefits I used to derive from being president of a\r\nuniversity was that I had the pleasure of entertaining thoughtful men from\r\nall over the world. I cannot tell you how much has dropped into my granary\r\nby their presence. I had been casting around in my mind for something by\r\nwhich to draw several parts of my political thought together when it was\r\nmy good fortune to entertain a very interesting Scotsman who had been\r\ndevoting himself to the philosophical thought of the seventeenth century.\r\nHis talk was so engaging that it was delightful to hear him speak of\r\nanything, and presently there came out of the unexpected region of his\r\nthought the thing I had been waiting for. He called my attention to the\r\nfact that in every generation all sorts of speculation and thinking tend\r\nto fall under the formula of the dominant thought of the age. For example,\r\nafter the Newtonian Theory of the universe had been developed, almost all\r\nthinking tended to express itself in the analogies of the Newtonian\r\nTheory, and since the Darwinian Theory has reigned amongst us, everybody\r\nis likely to express whatever he wishes to expound in terms of development\r\nand accommodation to environment.\r\n\r\nNow, it came to me, as this interesting man talked, that the Constitution\r\nof the United States had been made under the dominion of the Newtonian\r\nTheory. You have only to read the papers of _The Federalist_ to see that\r\nfact written on every page. They speak of the \"checks and balances\" of\r\nthe Constitution, and use to express their idea the simile of the\r\norganization of the universe, and particularly of the solar system,--how\r\nby the attraction of gravitation the various parts are held in their\r\norbits; and then they proceed to represent Congress, the Judiciary, and\r\nthe President as a sort of imitation of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThey were only following the English Whigs, who gave Great Britain its\r\nmodern constitution. Not that those Englishmen analyzed the matter, or had\r\nany theory about it; Englishmen care little for theories. It was a\r\nFrenchman, Montesquieu, who pointed out to them how faithfully they had\r\ncopied Newton's description of the mechanism of the heavens.\r\n\r\nThe makers of our Federal Constitution read Montesquieu with true\r\nscientific enthusiasm. They were scientists in their way,--the best way of\r\ntheir age,--those fathers of the nation. Jefferson wrote of \"the laws of\r\nNature,\"--and then by way of afterthought,--\"and of Nature's God.\" And\r\nthey constructed a government as they would have constructed an\r\norrery,--to display the laws of nature. Politics in their thought was a\r\nvariety of mechanics. The Constitution was founded on the law of\r\ngravitation. The government was to exist and move by virtue of the\r\nefficacy of \"checks and balances.\"\r\n\r\nThe trouble with the theory is that government is not a machine, but a\r\nliving thing. It falls, not under the theory of the universe, but under\r\nthe theory of organic life. It is accountable to Darwin, not to Newton. It\r\nis modified by its environment, necessitated by its tasks, shaped to its\r\nfunctions by the sheer pressure of life. No living thing can have its\r\norgans offset against each other, as checks, and live. On the contrary,\r\nits life is dependent upon their quick co-operation, their ready response\r\nto the commands of instinct or intelligence, their amicable community of\r\npurpose. Government is not a body of blind forces; it is a body of men,\r\nwith highly differentiated functions, no doubt, in our modern day, of\r\nspecialization, with a common task and purpose. Their co-operation is\r\nindispensable, their warfare fatal. There can be no successful government\r\nwithout the intimate, instinctive co-ordination of the organs of life and\r\naction. This is not theory, but fact, and displays its force as fact,\r\nwhatever theories may be thrown across its track. Living political\r\nconstitutions must be Darwinian in structure and in practice. Society is a\r\nliving organism and must obey the laws of life, not of mechanics; it must\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nAll that progressives ask or desire is permission--in an era when\r\n\"development,\" \"evolution,\" is the scientific word--to interpret the\r\nConstitution according to the Darwinian principle; all they ask is\r\nrecognition of the fact that a nation is a living thing and not a machine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome citizens of this country have never got beyond the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, signed in Philadelphia, July 4th, 1776. Their bosoms swell\r\nagainst George III, but they have no consciousness of the war for freedom\r\nthat is going on to-day.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence did not mention the questions of our day.\r\nIt is of no consequence to us unless we can translate its general terms\r\ninto examples of the present day and substitute them in some vital way for\r\nthe examples it itself gives, so concrete, so intimately involved in the\r\ncircumstances of the day in which it was conceived and written. It is an\r\neminently practical document, meant for the use of practical men; not a\r\nthesis for philosophers, but a whip for tyrants; not a theory of\r\ngovernment, but a program of action. Unless we can translate it into the\r\nquestions of our own day, we are not worthy of it, we are not the sons of\r\nthe sires who acted in response to its challenge.\r\n\r\nWhat form does the contest between tyranny and freedom take to-day? What\r\nis the special form of tyranny we now fight? How does it endanger the\r\nrights of the people, and what do we mean to do in order to make our\r\ncontest against it effectual? What are to be the items of our new\r\ndeclaration of independence?\r\n\r\nBy tyranny, as we now fight it, we mean control of the law, of legislation\r\nand adjudication, by organizations which do not represent the people, by\r\nmeans which are private and selfish. We mean, specifically, the conduct of\r\nour affairs and the shaping of our legislation in the interest of special\r\nbodies of capital and those who organize their use. We mean the alliance,\r\nfor this purpose, of political machines with selfish business. We mean the\r\nexploitation of the people by legal and political means. We have seen many\r\nof our governments under these influences cease to be representative\r\ngovernments, cease to be governments representative of the people, and\r\nbecome governments representative of special interests, controlled by\r\nmachines, which in their turn are not controlled by the people.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when I think of the growth of our economic system, it seems to\r\nme as if, leaving our law just about where it was before any of the modern\r\ninventions or developments took place, we had simply at haphazard extended\r\nthe family residence, added an office here and a workroom there, and a new\r\nset of sleeping rooms there, built up higher on our foundations, and put\r\nout little lean-tos on the side, until we have a structure that has no\r\ncharacter whatever. Now, the problem is to continue to live in the house\r\nand yet change it.\r\n\r\nWell, we are architects in our time, and our architects are also\r\nengineers. We don't have to stop using a railroad terminal because a new\r\nstation is being built. We don't have to stop any of the processes of our\r\nlives because we are rearranging the structures in which we conduct those\r\nprocesses. What we have to undertake is to systematize the foundations of\r\nthe house, then to thread all the old parts of the structure with the\r\nsteel which will be laced together in modern fashion, accommodated to all\r\nthe modern knowledge of structural strength and elasticity, and then\r\nslowly change the partitions, relay the walls, let in the light through\r\nnew apertures, improve the ventilation; until finally, a generation or two\r\nfrom now, the scaffolding will be taken away, and there will be the family\r\nin a great building whose noble architecture will at last be disclosed,\r\nwhere men can live as a single community, co-operative as in a perfected,\r\nco-ordinated beehive, not afraid of any storm of nature, not afraid of\r\nany artificial storm, any imitation of thunder and lightning, knowing that\r\nthe foundations go down to the bedrock of principle, and knowing that\r\nwhenever they please they can change that plan again and accommodate it as\r\nthey please to the altering necessities of their lives.\r\n\r\nBut there are a great many men who don't like the idea. Some wit recently\r\nsaid, in view of the fact that most of our American architects are trained\r\nin a certain _École_ in Paris, that all American architecture in recent\r\nyears was either bizarre or \"Beaux Arts.\" I think that our economic\r\narchitecture is decidedly bizarre; and I am afraid that there is a good\r\ndeal to learn about matters other than architecture from the same source\r\nfrom which our architects have learned a great many things. I don't mean\r\nthe School of Fine Arts at Paris, but the experience of France; for from\r\nthe other side of the water men can now hold up against us the reproach\r\nthat we have not adjusted our lives to modern conditions to the same\r\nextent that they have adjusted theirs. I was very much interested in some\r\nof the reasons given by our friends across the Canadian border for being\r\nvery shy about the reciprocity arrangements. They said: \"We are not sure\r\nwhither these arrangements will lead, and we don't care to associate too\r\nclosely with the economic conditions of the United States until those\r\nconditions are as modern as ours.\" And when I resented it, and asked for\r\nparticulars, I had, in regard to many matters, to retire from the debate.\r\nBecause I found that they had adjusted their regulations of economic\r\ndevelopment to conditions we had not yet found a way to meet in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWell, we have started now at all events. The procession is under way. The\r\nstand-patter doesn't know there is a procession. He is asleep in the back\r\npart of his house. He doesn't know that the road is resounding with the\r\ntramp of men going to the front. And when he wakes up, the country will be\r\nempty. He will be deserted, and he will wonder what has happened. Nothing\r\nhas happened. The world has been going on. The world has a habit of going\r\non. The world has a habit of leaving those behind who won't go with it.\r\nThe world has always neglected stand-patters. And, therefore, the\r\nstand-patter does not excite my indignation; he excites my sympathy. He is\r\ngoing to be so lonely before it is all over. And we are good fellows, we\r\nare good company; why doesn't he come along? We are not going to do him\r\nany harm. We are going to show him a good time. We are going to climb the\r\nslow road until it reaches some upland where the air is fresher, where the\r\nwhole talk of mere politicians is stilled, where men can look in each\r\nother's faces and see that there is nothing to conceal, that all they have\r\nto talk about they are willing to talk about in the open and talk about\r\nwith each other; and whence, looking back over the road, we shall see at\r\nlast that we have fulfilled our promise to mankind. We had said to all the\r\nworld, \"America was created to break every kind of monopoly, and to set\r\nmen free, upon a footing of equality, upon a footing of opportunity, to\r\nmatch their brains and their energies,\" and now we have proved that we\r\nmeant it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFREEMEN NEED NO GUARDIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two theories of government that have been contending with each\r\nother ever since government began. One of them is the theory which in\r\nAmerica is associated with the name of a very great man, Alexander\r\nHamilton. A great man, but, in my judgment, not a great American. He did\r\nnot think in terms of American life. Hamilton believed that the only\r\npeople who could understand government, and therefore the only people who\r\nwere qualified to conduct it, were the men who had the biggest financial\r\nstake in the commercial and industrial enterprises of the country.\r\n\r\nThat theory, though few have now the hardihood to profess it openly, has\r\nbeen the working theory upon which our government has lately been\r\nconducted. It is astonishing how persistent it is. It is amazing how\r\nquickly the political party which had Lincoln for its first\r\nleader,--Lincoln, who not only denied, but in his own person so completely\r\ndisproved the aristocratic theory,--it is amazing how quickly that party,\r\nfounded on faith in the people, forgot the precepts of Lincoln and fell\r\nunder the delusion that the \"masses\" needed the guardianship of \"men of\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\nFor indeed, if you stop to think about it, nothing could be a greater\r\ndeparture from original Americanism, from faith in the ability of a\r\nconfident, resourceful, and independent people, than the discouraging\r\ndoctrine that somebody has got to provide prosperity for the rest of us.\r\nAnd yet that is exactly the doctrine on which the government of the United\r\nStates has been conducted lately. Who have been consulted when important\r\nmeasures of government, like tariff acts, and currency acts, and railroad\r\nacts, were under consideration? The people whom the tariff chiefly\r\naffects, the people for whom the currency is supposed to exist, the people\r\nwho pay the duties and ride on the railroads? Oh, no! What do they know\r\nabout such matters! The gentlemen whose ideas have been sought are the\r\nbig manufacturers, the bankers, and the heads of the great railroad\r\ncombinations. The masters of the government of the United States are the\r\ncombined capitalists and manufacturers of the United States. It is written\r\nover every intimate page of the records of Congress, it is written all\r\nthrough the history of conferences at the White House, that the\r\nsuggestions of economic policy in this country have come from one source,\r\nnot from many sources. The benevolent guardians, the kind-hearted trustees\r\nwho have taken the troubles of government off our hands, have become so\r\nconspicuous that almost anybody can write out a list of them. They have\r\nbecome so conspicuous that their names are mentioned upon almost every\r\npolitical platform. The men who have undertaken the interesting job of\r\ntaking care of us do not force us to requite them with anonymously\r\ndirected gratitude. We know them by name.\r\n\r\nSuppose you go to Washington and try to get at your government. You will\r\nalways find that while you are politely listened to, the men really\r\nconsulted are the men who have the biggest stake,--the big bankers, the\r\nbig manufacturers, the big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad\r\ncorporations and of steamship corporations. I have no objection to these\r\nmen being consulted, because they also, though they do not themselves seem\r\nto admit it, are part of the people of the United States. But I do very\r\nseriously object to these gentlemen being _chiefly_ consulted, and\r\nparticularly to their being exclusively consulted, for, if the government\r\nof the United States is to do the right thing by the people of the United\r\nStates, it has got to do it directly and not through the intermediation of\r\nthese gentlemen. Every time it has come to a critical question these\r\ngentlemen have been yielded to, and their demands have been treated as the\r\ndemands that should be followed as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThe government of the United States at present is a foster-child of the\r\nspecial interests. It is not allowed to have a will of its own. It is told\r\nat every move: \"Don't do that; you will interfere with our prosperity.\"\r\nAnd when we ask, \"Where is our prosperity lodged?\" a certain group of\r\ngentlemen say, \"With us.\" The government of the United States in recent\r\nyears has not been administered by the common people of the United States.\r\nYou know just as well as I do,--it is not an indictment against anybody,\r\nit is a mere statement of the facts,--that the people have stood outside\r\nand looked on at their own government and that all they have had to\r\ndetermine in past years has been which crowd they would look on at;\r\nwhether they would look on at this little group or that little group who\r\nhad managed to get the control of affairs in its hands. Have you ever\r\nheard, for example, of any hearing before any great committee of the\r\nCongress in which the people of the country as a whole were represented,\r\nexcept it may be by the Congressmen themselves? The men who appear at\r\nthose meetings in order to argue for or against a schedule in the tariff,\r\nfor this measure or against that measure, are men who represent special\r\ninterests. They may represent them very honestly, they may intend no wrong\r\nto their fellow-citizens, but they are speaking from the point of view\r\nalways of a small portion of the population. I have sometimes wondered why\r\nmen, particularly men of means, men who didn't have to work for their\r\nliving, shouldn't constitute themselves attorneys for the people, and\r\nevery time a hearing is held before a committee of Congress should not go\r\nand ask: \"Gentlemen, in considering these things suppose you consider the\r\nwhole country? Suppose you consider the citizens of the United States?\"\r\n\r\nI don't want a smug lot of experts to sit down behind closed doors in\r\nWashington and play Providence to me. There is a Providence to which I am\r\nperfectly willing to submit. But as for other men setting up as Providence\r\nover myself, I seriously object. I have never met a political savior in\r\nthe flesh, and I never expect to meet one. I am reminded of Gillet\r\nBurgess' verses:\r\n\r\n    I never saw a purple cow,\r\n      I never hope to see one,\r\n    But this I'll tell you anyhow,\r\n      I'd rather see than be one.\r\n\r\nThat is the way I feel about this saving of my fellow-countrymen. I'd\r\nrather see a savior of the United States than set up to be one; because I\r\nhave found out, I have actually found out, that men I consult with know\r\nmore than I do,--especially if I consult with enough of them. I never came\r\nout of a committee meeting or a conference without seeing more of the\r\nquestion that was under discussion than I had seen when I went in. And\r\nthat to my mind is an image of government. I am not willing to be under\r\nthe patronage of the trusts, no matter how providential a government\r\npresides over the process of their control of my life.\r\n\r\nI am one of those who absolutely reject the trustee theory, the\r\nguardianship theory. I have never found a man who knew how to take care of\r\nme, and, reasoning from that point out, I conjecture that there isn't any\r\nman who knows how to take care of all the people of the United States. I\r\nsuspect that the people of the United States understand their own\r\ninterests better than any group of men in the confines of the country\r\nunderstand them. The men who are sweating blood to get their foothold in\r\nthe world of endeavor understand the conditions of business in the United\r\nStates very much better than the men who have arrived and are at the top.\r\nThey know what the thing is that they are struggling against. They know\r\nhow difficult it is to start a new enterprise. They know how far they have\r\nto search for credit that will put them upon an even footing with the men\r\nwho have already built up industry in this country. They know that\r\nsomewhere, by somebody, the development of industry is being controlled.\r\n\r\nI do not say this with the slightest desire to create any prejudice\r\nagainst wealth; on the contrary, I should be ashamed of myself if I\r\nexcited class feeling of any kind. But I do mean to suggest this: That the\r\nwealth of the country has, in recent years, come from particular sources;\r\nit has come from those sources which have built up monopoly. Its point of\r\nview is a special point of view. It is the point of view of those men who\r\ndo not wish that the people should determine their own affairs, because\r\nthey do not believe that the people's judgment is sound. They want to be\r\ncommissioned to take care of the United States and of the people of the\r\nUnited States, because they believe that they, better than anybody else,\r\nunderstand the interests of the United States. I do not challenge their\r\ncharacter; I challenge their point of view. We cannot afford to be\r\ngoverned as we have been governed in the last generation, by men who\r\noccupy so narrow, so prejudiced, so limited a point of view.\r\n\r\nThe government of our country cannot be lodged in any special class. The\r\npolicy of a great nation cannot be tied up with any particular set of\r\ninterests. I want to say, again and again, that my arguments do not touch\r\nthe character of the men to whom I am opposed. I believe that the very\r\nwealthy men who have got their money by certain kinds of corporate\r\nenterprise have closed in their horizon, and that they do not see and do\r\nnot understand the rank and file of the people. It is for that reason that\r\nI want to break up the little coterie that has determined what the\r\ngovernment of the nation should do. The list of the men who used to\r\ndetermine what New Jersey should and should not do did not exceed half a\r\ndozen, and they were always the same men. These very men now are, some of\r\nthem, frank enough to admit that New Jersey has finer energy in her\r\nbecause more men are consulted and the whole field of action is widened\r\nand liberalized. We have got to relieve our government from the domination\r\nof special classes, not because these special classes are bad,\r\nnecessarily, but because no special class can understand the interests of\r\na great community.\r\n\r\nI believe, as I believe in nothing else, in the average integrity and the\r\naverage intelligence of the American people, and I do not believe that the\r\nintelligence of America can be put into commission anywhere. I do not\r\nbelieve that there is any group of men of any kind to whom we can afford\r\nto give that kind of trusteeship.\r\n\r\nI will not live under trustees if I can help it. No group of men less than\r\nthe majority has a right to tell me how I have got to live in America. I\r\nwill submit to the majority, because I have been trained to do\r\nit,--though I may sometimes have my private opinion even of the majority.\r\nI do not care how wise, how patriotic, the trustees may be, I have never\r\nheard of any group of men in whose hands I am willing to lodge the\r\nliberties of America in trust.\r\n\r\nIf any part of our people want to be wards, if they want to have guardians\r\nput over them, if they want to be taken care of, if they want to be\r\nchildren, patronized by the government, why, I am sorry, because it will\r\nsap the manhood of America. But I don't believe they do. I believe they\r\nwant to stand on the firm foundation of law and right and take care of\r\nthemselves. I, for my part, don't want to belong to a nation, I believe\r\nthat I do not belong to a nation, that needs to be taken care of by\r\nguardians. I want to belong to a nation, and I am proud that I do belong\r\nto a nation, that knows how to take care of itself. If I thought that the\r\nAmerican people were reckless, were ignorant, were vindictive, I might\r\nshrink from putting the government into their hands. But the beauty of\r\ndemocracy is that when you are reckless you destroy your own established\r\nconditions of life; when you are vindictive, you wreak vengeance upon\r\nyourself; the whole stability of a democratic polity rests upon the fact\r\nthat every interest is every man's interest.\r\n\r\nThe theory that the men of biggest affairs, whose field of operation is\r\nthe widest, are the proper men to advise the government is, I am willing\r\nto admit, rather a plausible theory. If my business covers the United\r\nStates not only, but covers the world, it is to be presumed that I have a\r\npretty wide scope in my vision of business. But the flaw is that it is my\r\nown business that I have a vision of, and not the business of the men who\r\nlie outside of the scope of the plans I have made for a profit out of the\r\nparticular transactions I am connected with. And you can't, by putting\r\ntogether a large number of men who understand their own business, no\r\nmatter how large it is, make up a body of men who will understand the\r\nbusiness of the nation as contrasted with their own interest.\r\n\r\nIn a former generation, half a century ago, there were a great many men\r\nassociated with the government whose patriotism we are not privileged to\r\ndeny nor to question, who intended to serve the people, but had become so\r\nsaturated with the point of view of a governing class that it was\r\nimpossible for them to see America as the people of America themselves saw\r\nit. Then there arose that interesting figure, the immortal figure of the\r\ngreat Lincoln, who stood up declaring that the politicians, the men who\r\nhad governed this country, did not see from the point of view of the\r\npeople. When I think of that tall, gaunt figure rising in Illinois, I have\r\na picture of a man free, unentangled, unassociated with the governing\r\ninfluences of the country, ready to see things with an open eye, to see\r\nthem steadily, to see them whole, to see them as the men he rubbed\r\nshoulders with and associated with saw them. What the country needed in\r\n1860 was a leader who understood and represented the thought of the whole\r\npeople, as contrasted with that of a class which imagined itself the\r\nguardian of the country's welfare.\r\n\r\nNow, likewise, the trouble with our present political condition is that we\r\nneed some man who has not been associated with the governing classes and\r\nthe governing influences of this country to stand up and speak for us; we\r\nneed to hear a voice from the outside calling upon the American people to\r\nassert again their rights and prerogatives in the possession of their own\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nMy thought about both Mr. Taft and Mr. Roosevelt is that of entire\r\nrespect, but these gentlemen have been so intimately associated with the\r\npowers that have been determining the policy of this government for almost\r\na generation, that they cannot look at the affairs of the country with the\r\nview of a new age and of a changed set of circumstances. They sympathize\r\nwith the people; their hearts no doubt go out to the great masses of\r\nunknown men in this country; but their thought is in close, habitual\r\nassociation with those who have framed the policies of the country during\r\nall our lifetime. Those men have framed the protective tariff, have\r\ndeveloped the trusts, have co-ordinated and ordered all the great economic\r\nforces of this country in such fashion that nothing but an outside force\r\nbreaking in can disturb their domination and control. It is with this in\r\nmind, I believe, that the country can say to these gentlemen: \"We do not\r\ndeny your integrity; we do not deny your purity of purpose; but the\r\nthought of the people of the United States has not yet penetrated to your\r\nconsciousness. You are willing to act for the people, but you are not\r\nwilling to act _through_ the people. Now we propose to act for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI sometimes think that the men who are now governing us are unconscious of\r\nthe chains in which they are held. I do not believe that men such as we\r\nknow, among our public men at least--most of them--have deliberately put\r\nus into leading strings to the special interests. The special interests\r\nhave grown up. They have grown up by processes which at last, happily, we\r\nare beginning to understand. And, having grown up, having occupied the\r\nseats of greatest advantage nearest the ear of those who are conducting\r\ngovernment, having contributed the money which was necessary to the\r\nelections, and therefore having been kindly thought of after elections,\r\nthere has closed around the government of the United States a very\r\ninteresting, a very able, a very aggressive coterie of gentlemen who are\r\nmost definite and explicit in their ideas as to what they want.\r\n\r\nThey don't have to consult us as to what they want. They don't have to\r\nresort to anybody. They know their plans, and therefore they know what\r\nwill be convenient for them. It may be that they have really thought what\r\nthey have said they thought; it may be that they know so little of the\r\nhistory of economic development and of the interests of the United States\r\nas to believe that their leadership is indispensable for our prosperity\r\nand development. I don't have to prove that they believe that, because\r\nthey themselves admit it. I have heard them admit it on many occasions.\r\n\r\nI want to say to you very frankly that I do not feel vindictive about it.\r\nSome of the men who have exercised this control are excellent fellows;\r\nthey really believe that the prosperity of the country depends upon them.\r\nThey really believe that if the leadership of economic development in\r\nthis country dropped from their hands, the rest of us are too\r\nmuddle-headed to undertake the task. They not only comprehend the power of\r\nthe United States within their grasp, but they comprehend it within their\r\nimagination. They are honest men, they have just as much right to express\r\ntheir views as I have to express mine or you to express yours, but it is\r\njust about time that we examined their views for ourselves and determined\r\ntheir validity.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, their thought does not cover the processes of their\r\nown undertakings. As a university president, I learned that the men who\r\ndominate our manufacturing processes could not conduct their business for\r\ntwenty-four hours without the assistance of the experts with whom the\r\nuniversities were supplying them. Modern industry depends upon technical\r\nknowledge; and all that these gentlemen did was to manage the external\r\nfeatures of great combinations and their financial operation, which had\r\nvery little to do with the intimate skill with which the enterprises were\r\nconducted. I know men not catalogued in the public prints, men not spoken\r\nof in public discussion, who are the very bone and sinew of the industry\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nDo our masters of industry speak in the spirit and interest even of those\r\nwhom they employ? When men ask me what I think about the labor question\r\nand laboring men, I feel that I am being asked what I know about the vast\r\nmajority of the people, and I feel as if I were being asked to separate\r\nmyself, as belonging to a particular class, from that great body of my\r\nfellow-citizens who sustain and conduct the enterprises of the country.\r\nUntil we get away from that point of view it will be impossible to have a\r\nfree government.\r\n\r\nI have listened to some very honest and eloquent orators whose sentiments\r\nwere noteworthy for this: that when they spoke of the people, they were\r\nnot thinking of themselves; they were thinking of somebody whom they were\r\ncommissioned to take care of. They were always planning to do things _for_\r\nthe American people, and I have seen them visibly shiver when it was\r\nsuggested that they arrange to have something done by the people for\r\nthemselves. They said, \"What do they know about it?\" I always feel like\r\nreplying, \"What do _you_ know about it? You know your own interest, but\r\nwho has told you our interests, and what do you know about them?\" For the\r\nbusiness of every leader of government is to hear what the nation is\r\nsaying and to know what the nation is enduring. It is not his business to\r\njudge _for_ the nation, but to judge _through_ the nation as its spokesman\r\nand voice. I do not believe that this country could have safely allowed a\r\ncontinuation of the policy of the men who have viewed affairs in any other\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis under which we have been ruled is that of government\r\nthrough a board of trustees, through a selected number of the big business\r\nmen of the country who know a lot that the rest of us do not know, and who\r\ntake it for granted that our ignorance would wreck the prosperity of the\r\ncountry. The idea of the Presidents we have recently had has been that\r\nthey were Presidents of a National Board of Trustees. That is not my\r\nidea. I have been president of one board of trustees, and I do not care to\r\nhave another on my hands. I want to be President of the people of the\r\nUnited States. There was many a time when I was president of the board of\r\ntrustees of a university when the undergraduates knew more than the\r\ntrustees did; and it has been in my thought ever since that if I could\r\nhave dealt directly with the people who constituted Princeton University I\r\ncould have carried it forward much faster than I could dealing with a\r\nboard of trustees.\r\n\r\nMark you, I am not saying that these leaders knew that they were doing us\r\nan evil, or that they intended to do us an evil. For my part, I am very\r\nmuch more afraid of the man who does a bad thing and does not know it is\r\nbad than of the man who does a bad thing and knows it is bad; because I\r\nthink that in public affairs stupidity is more dangerous than knavery,\r\nbecause harder to fight and dislodge. If a man does not know enough to\r\nknow what the consequences are going to be to the country, then he cannot\r\ngovern the country in a way that is for its benefit. These gentlemen,\r\nwhatever may have been their intentions, linked the government up with the\r\nmen who control the finances. They may have done it innocently, or they\r\nmay have done it corruptly, without affecting my argument at all. And they\r\nthemselves cannot escape from that alliance.\r\n\r\nHere, for example, is the old question of campaign funds: If I take a\r\nhundred thousand dollars from a group of men representing a particular\r\ninterest that has a big stake in a certain schedule of the tariff, I take\r\nit with the knowledge that those gentlemen will expect me not to forget\r\ntheir interest in that schedule, and that they will take it as a point of\r\nimplicit honor that I should see to it that they are not damaged by too\r\ngreat a change in that schedule. Therefore, if I take their money, I am\r\nbound to them by a tacit implication of honor. Perhaps there is no ground\r\nfor objection to this situation so long as the function of government is\r\nconceived to be to look after the trustees of prosperity, who in turn will\r\nlook after the people; but on any other theory than that of trusteeship\r\nno interested campaign contributions can be tolerated for a moment,--save\r\nthose of the millions of citizens who thus support the doctrines they\r\nbelieve and the men whom they recognized as their spokesmen.\r\n\r\nI tell you the men I am interested in are the men who, under the\r\nconditions we have had, never had their voices heard, who never got a line\r\nin the newspapers, who never got a moment on the platform, who never had\r\naccess to the ears of Governors or Presidents or of anybody who was\r\nresponsible for the conduct of public affairs, but who went silently and\r\npatiently to their work every day carrying the burden of the world. How\r\nare they to be understood by the masters of finance, if only the masters\r\nof finance are consulted?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat is what I mean when I say, \"Bring the government back to the people.\"\r\nI do not mean anything demagogic; I do not mean to talk as if we wanted a\r\ngreat mass of men to rush in and destroy something. That is not the idea.\r\nI want the people to come in and take possession of their own premises;\r\nfor I hold that the government belongs to the people, and that they have a\r\nright to that intimate access to it which will determine every turn of its\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nAmerica is never going to submit to guardianship. America is never going\r\nto choose thralldom instead of freedom. Look what there is to decide!\r\nThere is the tariff question. Can the tariff question be decided in favor\r\nof the people, so long as the monopolies are the chief counselors at\r\nWashington? There is the currency question. Are we going to settle the\r\ncurrency question so long as the government listens only to the counsel of\r\nthose who command the banking situation?\r\n\r\nThen there is the question of conservation. What is our fear about\r\nconservation? The hands that are being stretched out to monopolize our\r\nforests, to prevent or pre-empt the use of our great power-producing\r\nstreams, the hands that are being stretched into the bowels of the earth\r\nto take possession of the great riches that lie hidden in Alaska and\r\nelsewhere in the incomparable domain of the United States, are the hands\r\nof monopoly. Are these men to continue to stand at the elbow of government\r\nand tell us how we are to save ourselves,--from themselves? You can not\r\nsettle the question of conservation while monopoly is close to the ears of\r\nthose who govern. And the question of conservation is a great deal bigger\r\nthan the question of saving our forests and our mineral resources and our\r\nwaters; it is as big as the life and happiness and strength and elasticity\r\nand hope of our people.\r\n\r\nThere are tasks awaiting the government of the United States which it\r\ncannot perform until every pulse of that government beats in unison with\r\nthe needs and the desires of the whole body of the American people. Shall\r\nwe not give the people access of sympathy, access of authority, to the\r\ninstrumentalities which are to be indispensable to their lives?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nLIFE COMES FROM THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I look back on the processes of history, when I survey the genesis of\r\nAmerica, I see this written over every page: that the nations are renewed\r\nfrom the bottom, not from the top; that the genius which springs up from\r\nthe ranks of unknown men is the genius which renews the youth and energy\r\nof the people. Everything I know about history, every bit of experience\r\nand observation that has contributed to my thought, has confirmed me in\r\nthe conviction that the real wisdom of human life is compounded out of the\r\nexperiences of ordinary men. The utility, the vitality, the fruitage of\r\nlife does not come from the top to the bottom; it comes, like the natural\r\ngrowth of a great tree, from the soil, up through the trunk into the\r\nbranches to the foliage and the fruit. The great struggling unknown masses\r\nof the men who are at the base of everything are the dynamic force that\r\nis lifting the levels of society. A nation is as great, and only as great,\r\nas her rank and file.\r\n\r\nSo the first and chief need of this nation of ours to-day is to include in\r\nthe partnership of government all those great bodies of unnamed men who\r\nare going to produce our future leaders and renew the future energies of\r\nAmerica. And as I confess that, as I confess my belief in the common man,\r\nI know what I am saying. The man who is swimming against the stream knows\r\nthe strength of it. The man who is in the mêlée knows what blows are being\r\nstruck and what blood is being drawn. The man who is on the make is the\r\njudge of what is happening in America, not the man who has made good; not\r\nthe man who has emerged from the flood; not the man who is standing on the\r\nbank looking on, but the man who is struggling for his life and for the\r\nlives of those who are dearer to him than himself. That is the man whose\r\njudgment will tell you what is going on in America; that is the man by\r\nwhose judgment I, for one, wish to be guided.\r\n\r\nWe have had the wrong jury; we have had the wrong group,--no, I will not\r\nsay the wrong group, but too small a group,--in control of the policies of\r\nthe United States. The average man has not been consulted, and his heart\r\nhad begun to sink for fear he never would be consulted again. Therefore,\r\nwe have got to organize a government whose sympathies will be open to the\r\nwhole body of the people of the United States, a government which will\r\nconsult as large a proportion of the people of the United States as\r\npossible before it acts. Because the great problem of government is to\r\nknow what the average man is experiencing and is thinking about. Most of\r\nus are average men; very few of us rise, except by fortunate accident,\r\nabove the general level of the community about us; and therefore the man\r\nwho thinks common thoughts, the man who has had common experiences, is\r\nalmost always the man who interprets America aright. Isn't that the reason\r\nthat we are proud of such stories as the story of Abraham Lincoln,--a man\r\nwho rose out of the ranks and interpreted America better than any man had\r\ninterpreted it who had risen out of the privileged classes or the educated\r\nclasses of America?\r\n\r\nThe hope of the United States in the present and in the future is the same\r\nthat it has always been: it is the hope and confidence that out of unknown\r\nhomes will come men who will constitute themselves the masters of industry\r\nand of politics. The average hopefulness, the average welfare, the average\r\nenterprise, the average initiative, of the United States are the only\r\nthings that make it rich. We are not rich because a few gentlemen direct\r\nour industry; we are rich because of our own intelligence and our own\r\nindustry. America does not consist of men who get their names into the\r\nnewspapers; America does not consist politically of the men who set\r\nthemselves up to be political leaders; she does not consist of the men who\r\ndo most of her talking,--they are important only so far as they speak for\r\nthat great voiceless multitude of men who constitute the great body and\r\nthe saving force of the nation. Nobody who cannot speak the common\r\nthought, who does not move by the common impulse, is the man to speak for\r\nAmerica, or for any of her future purposes. Only he is fit to speak who\r\nknows the thoughts of the great body of citizens, the men who go about\r\ntheir business every day, the men who toil from morning till night, the\r\nmen who go home tired in the evenings, the men who are carrying on the\r\nthings we are so proud of.\r\n\r\nYou know how it thrills our blood sometimes to think how all the nations\r\nof the earth wait to see what America is going to do with her power, her\r\nphysical power, her enormous resources, her enormous wealth. The nations\r\nhold their breath to see what this young country will do with her young\r\nunspoiled strength; we cannot help but be proud that we are strong. But\r\nwhat has made us strong? The toil of millions of men, the toil of men who\r\ndo not boast, who are inconspicuous, but who live their lives humbly from\r\nday to day; it is the great body of toilers that constitutes the might of\r\nAmerica. It is one of the glories of our land that nobody is able to\r\npredict from what family, from what region, from what race, even, the\r\nleaders of the country are going to come. The great leaders of this\r\ncountry have not come very often from the established, \"successful\"\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nI remember speaking at a school not long ago where I understood that\r\nalmost all the young men were the sons of very rich people, and I told\r\nthem I looked upon them with a great deal of pity, because, I said: \"Most\r\nof you fellows are doomed to obscurity. You will not do anything. You will\r\nnever try to do anything, and with all the great tasks of the country\r\nwaiting to be done, probably you are the very men who will decline to do\r\nthem. Some man who has been 'up against it,' some man who has come out of\r\nthe crowd, somebody who has had the whip of necessity laid on his back,\r\nwill emerge out of the crowd, will show that he understands the crowd,\r\nunderstands the interests of the nation, united and not separated, and\r\nwill stand up and lead us.\"\r\n\r\nIf I may speak of my own experience, I have found audiences made up of the\r\n\"common people\" quicker to take a point, quicker to understand an\r\nargument, quicker to discern a tendency and to comprehend a principle,\r\nthan many a college class that I have lectured to,--not because the\r\ncollege class lacked the intelligence, but because college boys are not in\r\ncontact with the realities of life, while \"common\" citizens are in contact\r\nwith the actual life of day by day; you do not have to explain to them\r\nwhat touches them to the quick.\r\n\r\nThere is one illustration of the value of the constant renewal of society\r\nfrom the bottom that has always interested me profoundly. The only reason\r\nwhy government did not suffer dry rot in the Middle Ages under the\r\naristocratic system which then prevailed was that so many of the men who\r\nwere efficient instruments of government were drawn from the church,--from\r\nthat great religious body which was then the only church, that body which\r\nwe now distinguish from other religious bodies as the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. The Roman Catholic Church was then, as it is now, a great\r\ndemocracy. There was no peasant so humble that he might not become a\r\npriest, and no priest so obscure that he might not become Pope of\r\nChristendom; and every chancellery in Europe, every court in Europe, was\r\nruled by these learned, trained and accomplished men,--the priesthood of\r\nthat great and dominant body. What kept government alive in the Middle\r\nAges was this constant rise of the sap from the bottom, from the rank and\r\nfile of the great body of the people through the open channels of the\r\npriesthood. That, it seems to me, is one of the most interesting and\r\nconvincing illustrations that could possibly be adduced of the thing that\r\nI am talking about.\r\n\r\nThe only way that government is kept pure is by keeping these channels\r\nopen, so that nobody may deem himself so humble as not to constitute a\r\npart of the body politic, so that there will constantly be coming new\r\nblood into the veins of the body politic; so that no man is so obscure\r\nthat he may not break the crust of any class he may belong to, may not\r\nspring up to higher levels and be counted among the leaders of the state.\r\nAnything that depresses, anything that makes the organization greater than\r\nthe man, anything that blocks, discourages, dismays the humble man, is\r\nagainst all the principles of progress. When I see alliances formed, as\r\nthey are now being formed, by successful men of business with successful\r\norganizers of politics, I know that something has been done that checks\r\nthe vitality and progress of society. Such an alliance, made at the top,\r\nis an alliance made to depress the levels, to hold them where they are, if\r\nnot to sink them; and, therefore, it is the constant business of good\r\npolitics to break up such partnerships, to re-establish and reopen the\r\nconnections between the great body of the people and the offices of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nTo-day, when our government has so far passed into the hands of special\r\ninterests; to-day, when the doctrine is implicitly avowed that only select\r\nclasses have the equipment necessary for carrying on government; to-day,\r\nwhen so many conscientious citizens, smitten with the scene of social\r\nwrong and suffering, have fallen victims to the fallacy that benevolent\r\ngovernment can be meted out to the people by kind-hearted trustees of\r\nprosperity and guardians of the welfare of dutiful employees,--to-day,\r\nsupremely, does it behoove this nation to remember that a people shall be\r\nsaved by the power that sleeps in its own deep bosom, or by none; shall be\r\nrenewed in hope, in conscience, in strength, by waters welling up from its\r\nown sweet, perennial springs. Not from above; not by patronage of its\r\naristocrats. The flower does not bear the root, but the root the flower.\r\nEverything that blooms in beauty in the air of heaven draws its fairness,\r\nits vigor, from its roots. Nothing living can blossom into fruitage unless\r\nthrough nourishing stalks deep-planted in the common soil. The rose is\r\nmerely the evidence of the vitality of the root; and the real source of\r\nits beauty, the very blush that it wears upon its tender cheek, comes from\r\nthose silent sources of life that lie hidden in the chemistry of the soil.\r\nUp from that soil, up from the silent bosom of the earth, rise the\r\ncurrents of life and energy. Up from the common soil, up from the quiet\r\nheart of the people, rise joyously to-day streams of hope and\r\ndetermination bound to renew the face of the earth in glory.\r\n\r\nI tell you, the so-called radicalism of our times is simply the effort of\r\nnature to release the generous energies of our people. This great American\r\npeople is at bottom just, virtuous, and hopeful; the roots of its being\r\nare in the soil of what is lovely, pure, and of good report, and the need\r\nof the hour is just that radicalism that will clear a way for the\r\nrealization of the aspirations of a sturdy race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE PARLIAMENT OF THE PEOPLE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a long time this country of ours has lacked one of the institutions\r\nwhich freemen have always and everywhere held fundamental. For a long time\r\nthere has been no sufficient opportunity of counsel among the people; no\r\nplace and method of talk, of exchange of opinion, of parley. Communities\r\nhave outgrown the folk-moot and the town-meeting. Congress, in accordance\r\nwith the genius of the land, which asks for action and is impatient of\r\nwords,--Congress has become an institution which does its work in the\r\nprivacy of committee rooms and not on the floor of the Chamber; a body\r\nthat makes laws,--a legislature; not a body that debates,--not a\r\nparliament. Party conventions afford little or no opportunity for\r\ndiscussion; platforms are privately manufactured and adopted with a whoop.\r\nIt is partly because citizens have foregone the taking of counsel\r\ntogether that the unholy alliances of bosses and Big Business have been\r\nable to assume to govern for us.\r\n\r\nI conceive it to be one of the needs of the hour to restore the processes\r\nof common counsel, and to substitute them for the processes of private\r\narrangement which now determine the policies of cities, states, and\r\nnation. We must learn, we freemen, to meet, as our fathers did, somehow,\r\nsomewhere, for consultation. There must be discussion and debate, in which\r\nall freely participate.\r\n\r\nIt must be candid debate, and it must have for its honest purpose the\r\nclearing up of questions and the establishing of the truth. Too much\r\npolitical discussion is not to honest purpose, but only for the\r\nconfounding of an opponent. I am often reminded, when political debate\r\ngets warm and we begin to hope that the truth is making inroads on the\r\nreason of those who have denied it, of the way a debate in Virginia once\r\nseemed likely to end:\r\n\r\nWhen I was a young man studying at Charlottesville, there were two\r\nfactions in the Democratic party in the State of Virginia which were\r\nhaving a pretty hot contest with each other. In one of the counties one of\r\nthese factions had practically no following at all. A man named Massey,\r\none of its redoubtable debaters, though a little, slim,\r\ninsignificant-looking person, sent a messenger up into this county and\r\nchallenged the opposition to debate with him. They didn't quite like the\r\nidea, but they were too proud to decline, so they put up their best\r\ndebater, a big, good-natured man whom everybody was familiar with as\r\n\"Tom,\" and it was arranged that Massey should have the first hour and that\r\nTom Whatever-his-name-was should succeed him the next hour. When the\r\noccasion came, Massey, with his characteristic shrewdness, began to get\r\nunderneath the skins of the audience, and he hadn't made more than half\r\nhis speech before it was evident that he was getting that hostile crowd\r\nwith him; whereupon one of Tom's partisans in the back of the room, seeing\r\nhow things were going, cried out: \"Tom, call him a liar and make it a\r\nfight!\"\r\n\r\nNow, that kind of debate, that spirit in discussion, gets us nowhere. Our\r\nnational affairs are too serious, they lie too close to the well-being of\r\neach one of us, to excuse our talking about them except in earnestness and\r\ncandor and a willingness to speak and listen with open minds. It is a\r\nmisfortune that attends the party system that in the heat of a campaign\r\npartisan passions are so aroused that we cannot have frank discussion. Yet\r\nI am sure that I observe, and that all citizens must observe, an almost\r\nstartling change in the temper of the people in this respect. The campaign\r\njust closed was markedly different from others that had preceded it in the\r\ndegree to which party considerations were forgotten in the seriousness of\r\nthe things we had to discuss as common citizens of an endangered country.\r\n\r\nThere is astir in the air of America something that I for one never saw\r\nbefore, never felt before. I have been going to political meetings all my\r\nlife, though not all my life playing an immodestly conspicuous part in\r\nthem; and there is a spirit in our political meetings now that I never\r\nsaw before. It hasn't been very many years, let me say for example, that\r\nwomen attended political meetings. And women are attending political\r\nmeetings now not simply because there is a woman question in politics;\r\nthey are attending them because the modern political meeting is not like\r\nthe political meeting of five or ten years ago. That was a mere\r\nratification rally. That was a mere occasion for \"whooping it up\" for\r\nsomebody. That was merely an occasion upon which one party was denounced\r\nunreasonably and the other was lauded unreasonably. No party has ever\r\ndeserved quite the abuse that each party has got in turn, and nobody has\r\never deserved the praise that both parties have got in turn. The old\r\npolitical meeting was a wholly irrational performance; it was got together\r\nfor the purpose of saying things that were chiefly not so and that were\r\nknown by those who heard them not to be so, and were simply to be taken as\r\na tonic in order to produce cheers.\r\n\r\nBut I am very much mistaken in the temper of my fellow-countrymen if the\r\nmeetings I have seen in the last two years bear any resemblance to those\r\nolder meetings. Men now get together in a political meeting in order to\r\nhear things of the deepest consequence discussed. And you will find almost\r\nas many Republicans in a Democratic meeting as you will find Democrats in\r\na Republican meeting; the spirit of frank discussion, of common counsel,\r\nis abroad.\r\n\r\nGood will it be for the country if the interest in public concerns\r\nmanifested so widely and so sincerely be not suffered to expire with the\r\nelection! Why should political debate go on only when somebody is to be\r\nelected? Why should it be confined to campaign time?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is a movement on foot in which, in common with many men and women\r\nwho love their country, I am greatly interested,--the movement to open the\r\nschoolhouse to the grown-up people in order that they may gather and talk\r\nover the affairs of the neighborhood and the state. There are schoolhouses\r\nall over the land which are not used by the teachers and children in the\r\nsummer months, which are not used in the winter time in the evening for\r\nschool purposes. These buildings belong to the public. Why not insist\r\neverywhere that they be used as places of discussion, such as of old took\r\nplace in the town-meetings to which everybody went and where every public\r\nofficer was freely called to account? The schoolhouse, which belongs to\r\nall of us, is a natural place in which to gather to consult over our\r\ncommon affairs.\r\n\r\nI was very much interested in the remark of a fellow-citizen of ours who\r\nhad been born on the other side of the water. He said that not long ago he\r\nwandered into one of those neighborhood schoolhouse meetings, and there\r\nfound himself among people who were discussing matters in which they were\r\nall interested; and when he came out he said to me: \"I have been living in\r\nAmerica now ten years, and to-night for the first time I saw America as I\r\nhad imagined it to be. This gathering together of men of all sorts upon a\r\nperfect footing of equality to discuss frankly with one another what\r\nconcerned them all,--that is what I dreamed America was.\"\r\n\r\nThat set me to thinking. He hadn't seen the America he had come to find\r\nuntil that night. Had he not felt like a neighbor? Had men not consulted\r\nhim? He had felt like an outsider. Had there been no little circles in\r\nwhich public affairs were discussed?\r\n\r\nYou know that the great melting-pot of America, the place where we are all\r\nmade Americans of, is the public school, where men of every race and of\r\nevery origin and of every station in life send their children, or ought to\r\nsend their children, and where, being mixed together, the youngsters are\r\nall infused with the American spirit and developed into American men and\r\nAmerican women. When, in addition to sending our children to school to\r\npaid teachers, we go to school to one another in those same schoolhouses,\r\nthen we shall begin more fully to realize than we ever have realized\r\nbefore what American life is. And let me tell you this, confidentially,\r\nthat wherever you find school boards that object to opening the\r\nschoolhouses in the evening for public meetings of every proper sort, you\r\nhad better look around for some politician who is objecting to it; because\r\nthe thing that cures bad politics is talk by the neighbors. The thing that\r\nbrings to light the concealed circumstances of our political life is the\r\ntalk of the neighborhood; and if you can get the neighbors together, get\r\nthem frankly to tell everything they know, then your politics, your ward\r\npolitics, and your city politics, and your state politics, too, will be\r\nturned inside out,--in the way they ought to be. Because the chief\r\ndifficulty our politics has suffered is that the inside didn't look like\r\nthe outside. Nothing clears the air like frank discussion.\r\n\r\nOne of the valuable lessons of my life was due to the fact that at a\r\ncomparatively early age in my experience as a public speaker I had the\r\nprivilege of speaking in Cooper Union in New York. The audience in Cooper\r\nUnion is made up of every kind of man and woman, from the poor devil who\r\nsimply comes in to keep warm up to the man who has come in to take a\r\nserious part in the discussion of the evening. I want to tell you this,\r\nthat in the questions that are asked there after the speech is over, the\r\nmost penetrating questions that I have ever had addressed to me came from\r\nsome of the men who were the least well-dressed in the audience, came from\r\nthe plain fellows, came from the fellows whose muscle was daily up against\r\nthe whole struggle of life. They asked questions which went to the heart\r\nof the business and put me to my mettle to answer them. I felt as if those\r\nquestions came as a voice out of life itself, not a voice out of any\r\nschool less severe than the severe school of experience. And what I like\r\nabout this social centre idea of the schoolhouse is that there is the\r\nplace where the ordinary fellow is going to get his innings, going to ask\r\nhis questions, going to express his opinions, going to convince those who\r\ndo not realize the vigor of America that the vigor of America pulses in\r\nthe blood of every true American, and that the only place he can find the\r\ntrue American is in this clearing-house of absolutely democratic opinion.\r\n\r\nNo one man understands the United States. I have met some gentlemen who\r\nprofessed they did. I have even met some business men who professed they\r\nheld in their own single comprehension the business of the United States;\r\nbut I am educated enough to know that they do not. Education has this\r\nuseful effect, that it narrows of necessity the circles of one's egotism.\r\nNo student knows his subject. The most he knows is where and how to find\r\nout the things he does not know with regard to it. That is also the\r\nposition of a statesman. No statesman understands the whole country. He\r\nshould make it his business to find out where he will get the information\r\nnecessary to understand at least a part of it at a time when dealing with\r\ncomplex affairs. What we need is a universal revival of common counsel.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes reflected on the lack of a body of public opinion in our\r\ncities, and once I contrasted the habits of the city man with those of the\r\ncountryman in a way which got me into trouble. I described what a man in a\r\ncity generally did when he got into a public vehicle or sat in a public\r\nplace. He doesn't talk to anybody, but he plunges his head into a\r\nnewspaper and presently experiences a reaction which he calls his opinion,\r\nbut which is not an opinion at all, being merely the impression that a\r\npiece of news or an editorial has made upon him. He cannot be said to be\r\nparticipating in public opinion at all until he has laid his mind\r\nalongside the minds of his neighbors and discussed with them the incidents\r\nof the day and the tendencies of the time.\r\n\r\nWhere I got into trouble was, that I ventured on a comparison. I said that\r\npublic opinion was not typified on the streets of a busy city, but was\r\ntypified around the stove in a country store where men sat and probably\r\nchewed tobacco and spat into a sawdust box, and made up, before they got\r\nthrough, what was the neighborhood opinion both about persons and events;\r\nand then, inadvertently, I added this philosophical reflection, that,\r\nwhatever might be said against the chewing of tobacco, this at least could\r\nbe said for it: that it gave a man time to think between sentences. Ever\r\nsince then I have been represented, particularly in the advertisements of\r\ntobacco firms, as in favor of the use of chewing tobacco!\r\n\r\nThe reason that some city men are not more catholic in their ideas is that\r\nthey do not share the opinion of the country, and the reason that some\r\ncountrymen are rustic is that they do not know the opinion of the city;\r\nthey are both hampered by their limitations. I heard the other day of a\r\nwoman who had lived all her life in a city and in an hotel. She made a\r\nfirst visit to the country last summer, and spent a week in a farmhouse.\r\nAsked afterward what had interested her most about her experience, she\r\nreplied that it was hearing the farmer \"page his cows!\"\r\n\r\nA very urban point of view with regard to a common rustic occurrence, and\r\nyet that language showed the sharp, the inelastic limits of her thought.\r\nShe was provincial in the extreme; she thought even more narrowly than in\r\nthe terms of a city; she thought in the terms of an hotel. In proportion\r\nas we are confined within the walls of one hostelry or one city or one\r\nstate, we are provincial. We can do nothing more to advance our country's\r\nwelfare than to bring the various communities within the counsels of the\r\nnation. The real difficulty of our nation has been that not enough of us\r\nrealized that the matters we discussed were matters of common concern. We\r\nhave talked as if we had to serve now this part of the country and again\r\nthat part, now this interest and again that interest; as if all interests\r\nwere not linked together, provided we understood them and knew how they\r\nwere related to one another.\r\n\r\nIf you would know what makes the great river as it nears the sea, you must\r\ntravel up the stream. You must go up into the hills and back into the\r\nforests and see the little rivulets, the little streams, all gathering in\r\nhidden places to swell the great body of water in the channel. And so with\r\nthe making of public opinion: Back in the country, on the farms, in the\r\nshops, in the hamlets, in the homes of cities, in the schoolhouses, where\r\nmen get together and are frank and true with one another, there come\r\ntrickling down the streams which are to make the mighty force of the\r\nriver, the river which is to drive all the enterprises of human life as it\r\nsweeps on into the great common sea of humanity.\r\n\r\nI feel nothing so much as the intensity of the common man. I can pick out\r\nin any audience the men who are at ease in their fortunes: they are seeing\r\na public man go through his stunts. But there are in every crowd other men\r\nwho are not doing that,--men who are listening as if they were waiting to\r\nhear if there were somebody who could speak the thing that is stirring in\r\ntheir own hearts and minds. It makes a man's heart ache to think that he\r\ncannot be sure that he is doing it for them; to wonder whether they are\r\nlonging for something that he does not understand. He prays God that\r\nsomething will bring into his consciousness what is in theirs, so that the\r\nwhole nation may feel at last released from its dumbness, feel at last\r\nthat there is no invisible force holding it back from its goal, feel at\r\nlast that there is hope and confidence and that the road may be trodden as\r\nif we were brothers, shoulder to shoulder, not asking each other anything\r\nabout differences of class, not contesting for any selfish advance, but\r\nunited in the common enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe burden that is upon the heart of every conscientious public man is the\r\nburden of the thought that perhaps he does not sufficiently comprehend the\r\nnational life. For, as a matter of fact, no single man does comprehend it.\r\nThe whole purpose of democracy is that we may hold counsel with one\r\nanother, so as not to depend upon the understanding of one man, but to\r\ndepend upon the counsel of all. For only as men are brought into counsel,\r\nand state their own needs and interests, can the general interests of a\r\ngreat people be compounded into a policy that will be suitable to all.\r\n\r\nI have realized all my life, as a man connected with the tasks of\r\neducation, that the chief use of education is to open the understanding to\r\ncomprehend as many things as possible. That it is not what a man\r\nknows,--for no man knows a great deal,--but what a man has upon his mind\r\nto find out; it is his ability to understand things, it is his connection\r\nwith the great masses of men that makes him fit to speak for others,--and\r\nonly that. I have associated with some of the gentlemen who are connected\r\nwith the special interests of this country (and many of them are pretty\r\nfine men, I can tell you), but, fortunately for me, I have associated with\r\na good many other persons besides; I have not confined my acquaintance to\r\nthese interesting groups, and I can actually tell those gentlemen some\r\nthings that they have not had time to find out. It has been my great good\r\nfortune not to have had my head buried in special undertakings, and,\r\ntherefore, I have had an occasional look at the horizon. Moreover, I found\r\nout, a long time ago, fortunately for me, when I was a boy, that the\r\nUnited States did not consist of that part of it in which I lived. There\r\nwas a time when I was a very narrow provincial, but happily the\r\ncircumstances of my life made it necessary that I should go to a very\r\ndistant part of the country, and I early found out what a very limited\r\nacquaintance I had with the United States, found out that the only thing\r\nthat would give me any sense at all in discussing the affairs of the\r\nUnited States was to know as many parts of the United States as possible.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe men who have been ruling America must consent to let the majority into\r\nthe game. We will no longer permit any system to go uncorrected which is\r\nbased upon private understandings and expert testimony; we will not allow\r\nthe few to continue to determine what the policy of the country is to be.\r\nIt is a question of access to our own government. There are very few of us\r\nwho have had any real access to the government. It ought to be a matter of\r\ncommon counsel; a matter of united counsel; a matter of mutual\r\ncomprehension.\r\n\r\nSo, keep the air clear with constant discussion. Make every public servant\r\nfeel that he is acting in the open and under scrutiny; and, above all\r\nthings else, take these great fundamental questions of your lives with\r\nwhich political platforms concern themselves and search them through and\r\nthrough by every process of debate. Then we shall have a clear air in\r\nwhich we shall see our way to each kind of social betterment. When we have\r\nfreed our government, when we have restored freedom of enterprise, when we\r\nhave broken up the partnerships between money and power which now block us\r\nat every turn, then we shall see our way to accomplish all the handsome\r\nthings which platforms promise in vain if they do not start at the point\r\nwhere stand the gates of liberty.\r\n\r\nI am not afraid of the American people getting up and doing something. I\r\nam only afraid they will not; and when I hear a popular vote spoken of as\r\nmob government, I feel like telling the man who dares so to speak that he\r\nhas no right to call himself an American. You cannot make a reckless,\r\npassionate force out of a body of sober people earning their living in a\r\nfree country. Just picture to yourselves the voting population of this\r\ngreat land, from the sea to the far borders in the mountains, going\r\ncalmly, man by man, to the polls, expressing its judgment about public\r\naffairs: is that your image of \"a mob?\"\r\n\r\nWhat is a mob? A mob is a body of men in hot contact with one another,\r\nmoved by ungovernable passion to do a hasty thing that they will regret\r\nthe next day. Do you see anything resembling a mob in that voting\r\npopulation of the countryside, men tramping over the mountains, men going\r\nto the general store up in the village, men moving in little talking\r\ngroups to the corner grocery to cast their ballots,--is that your notion\r\nof a mob? Or is that your picture of a free, self-governing people? I am\r\nnot afraid of the judgments so expressed, if you give men time to think,\r\nif you give them a clear conception of the things they are to vote for;\r\nbecause the deepest conviction and passion of my heart is that the common\r\npeople, by which I mean all of us, are to be absolutely trusted.\r\n\r\nSo, at this opening of a new age, in this its day of unrest and\r\ndiscontent, it is our part to clear the air, to bring about common\r\ncounsel; to set up the parliament of the people; to demonstrate that we\r\nare fighting no man, that we are trying to bring all men to understand\r\none another; that we are not the friends of any class against any other\r\nclass, but that our duty is to make classes understand one another. Our\r\npart is to lift so high the incomparable standards of the common interest\r\nand the common justice that all men with vision, all men with hope, all\r\nmen with the convictions of America in their hearts, will crowd to that\r\nstandard and a new day of achievement may come for the liberty which we\r\nlove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nLET THERE BE LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concern of patriotic men is to put our government again on its right\r\nbasis, by substituting the popular will for the rule of guardians, the\r\nprocesses of common counsel for those of private arrangement. In order to\r\ndo this, a first necessity is to open the doors and let in the light on\r\nall affairs which the people have a right to know about.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is necessary to open up all the processes of our\r\npolitics. They have been too secret, too complicated, too roundabout; they\r\nhave consisted too much of private conferences and secret understandings,\r\nof the control of legislation by men who were not legislators, but who\r\nstood outside and dictated, controlling oftentimes by very questionable\r\nmeans, which they would not have dreamed of allowing to become public. The\r\nwhole process must be altered. We must take the selection of candidates\r\nfor office, for example, out of the hands of small groups of men, of\r\nlittle coteries, out of the hands of machines working behind closed doors,\r\nand put it into the hands of the people themselves again by means of\r\ndirect primaries and elections to which candidates of every sort and\r\ndegree may have free access. We must substitute public for private\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in the second place, to give society command of its own\r\neconomic life again by denying to those who conduct the great modern\r\noperations of business the privacy that used to belong properly enough to\r\nmen who used only their own capital and their individual energy in\r\nbusiness. The processes of capital must be as open as the processes of\r\npolitics. Those who make use of the great modern accumulations of wealth,\r\ngathered together by the dragnet process of the sale of stocks and bonds,\r\nand piling up of reserves, must be treated as under a public obligation;\r\nthey must be made responsible for their business methods to the great\r\ncommunities which are in fact their working partners, so that the hand\r\nwhich makes correction shall easily reach them and a new principle of\r\nresponsibility be felt throughout their structure and operation.\r\n\r\nWhat are the right methods of politics? Why, the right methods are those\r\nof public discussion: the methods of leadership open and above board, not\r\ncloseted with \"boards of guardians\" or anybody else, but brought out under\r\nthe sky, where honest eyes can look upon them and honest eyes can judge of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIf there is nothing to conceal, then why conceal it? If it is a public\r\ngame, why play it in private? If it is a public game, then why not come\r\nout into the open and play it in public? You have got to cure diseased\r\npolitics as we nowadays cure tuberculosis, by making all the people who\r\nsuffer from it live out of doors; not only spend their days out of doors\r\nand walk around, but sleep out of doors; always remain in the open, where\r\nthey will be accessible to fresh, nourishing, and revivifying influences.\r\n\r\nI, for one, have the conviction that government ought to be all outside\r\nand no inside. I, for my part, believe that there ought to be no place\r\nwhere anything can be done that everybody does not know about. It would be\r\nvery inconvenient for some gentlemen, probably, if government were all\r\noutside, but we have consulted their susceptibilities too long already. It\r\nis barely possible that some of these gentlemen are unjustly suspected; in\r\nthat case they owe it to themselves to come out and operate in the light.\r\nThe very fact that so much in politics is done in the dark, behind closed\r\ndoors, promotes suspicion. Everybody knows that corruption thrives in\r\nsecret places, and avoids public places, and we believe it a fair\r\npresumption that secrecy means impropriety. So, our honest politicians and\r\nour honorable corporation heads owe it to their reputations to bring their\r\nactivities out into the open.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, whether they like it or not, these affairs are going to be\r\ndragged into the open. We are more anxious about their reputations than\r\nthey are themselves. We are too solicitous for their morals,--if they are\r\nnot,--to permit them longer to continue subject to the temptations of\r\nsecrecy. You know there is temptation in loneliness and secrecy. Haven't\r\nyou experienced it? I have. We are never so proper in our conduct as when\r\neverybody can look and see exactly what we are doing. If you are off in\r\nsome distant part of the world and suppose that nobody who lives within a\r\nmile of your home is anywhere around, there are times when you adjourn\r\nyour ordinary standards. You say to yourself: \"Well, I'll have a fling\r\nthis time; nobody will know anything about it.\" If you were on the desert\r\nof Sahara, you would feel that you might permit yourself,--well, say, some\r\nslight latitude in conduct; but if you saw one of your immediate neighbors\r\ncoming the other way on a camel,--you would behave yourself until he got\r\nout of sight. The most dangerous thing in the world is to get off where\r\nnobody knows you. I advise you to stay around among the neighbors, and\r\nthen you may keep out of jail. That is the only way some of us can keep\r\nout of jail.\r\n\r\nPublicity is one of the purifying elements of politics. The best thing\r\nthat you can do with anything that is crooked is to lift it up where\r\npeople can see that it is crooked, and then it will either straighten\r\nitself out or disappear. Nothing checks all the bad practices of politics\r\nlike public exposure. You can't be crooked in the light. I don't know\r\nwhether it has ever been tried or not; but I venture to say, purely from\r\nobservation, that it can't be done.\r\n\r\nAnd so the people of the United States have made up their minds to do a\r\nhealthy thing for both politics and big business. Permit me to mix a few\r\nmetaphors: They are going to open doors; they are going to let up blinds;\r\nthey are going to drag sick things into the open air and into the light of\r\nthe sun. They are going to organize a great hunt, and smoke certain\r\nanimals out of their burrows. They are going to unearth the beast in the\r\njungle in which when they hunted they were caught by the beast instead of\r\ncatching him. They have determined, therefore, to take an axe and raze the\r\njungle, and then see where the beast will find cover. And I, for my part,\r\nbid them God-speed. The jungle breeds nothing but infection and shelters\r\nnothing but the enemies of mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd nobody is going to get caught in our hunt except the beasts that\r\nprey. Nothing is going to be cut down or injured that anybody ought to\r\nwish preserved.\r\n\r\nYou know the story of the Irishman who, while digging a hole, was asked,\r\n\"Pat, what are you doing,--digging a hole?\" And he replied, \"No, sir; I am\r\ndigging the dirt, and laying the hole.\" It was probably the same Irishman\r\nwho, seen digging around the wall of a house, was asked, \"Pat, what are\r\nyou doing?\" And he answered, \"Faith, I am letting the dark out of the\r\ncellar.\" Now, that's exactly what we want to do,--let the dark out of the\r\ncellar.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTake, first, the relations existing between politics and business.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly legitimate, of course, that the business interests of the\r\ncountry should not only enjoy the protection of the law, but that they\r\nshould be in every way furthered and strengthened and facilitated by\r\nlegislation. The country has no jealousy of any connection between\r\nbusiness and politics which is a legitimate connection. It is not in the\r\nleast averse from open efforts to accommodate law to the material\r\ndevelopment which has so strengthened the country in all that it has\r\nundertaken by supplying its extraordinary life with its necessary physical\r\nfoundations.\r\n\r\nBut the illegitimate connections between business and legislation are\r\nanother matter. I would wish to speak on this subject with soberness and\r\ncircumspection. I have no desire to excite anger against anybody. That\r\nwould be easy, but it would do no particular good. I wish, rather, to\r\nconsider an unhappy situation in a spirit that may enable us to account\r\nfor it, to some extent, and so perhaps get at the causes and the remedy.\r\nMere denunciation doesn't help much to clear up a matter so involved as is\r\nthe complicity of business with evil politics in America.\r\n\r\nEvery community is vaguely aware that the political machine upon which it\r\nlooks askance has certain very definite connections with men who are\r\nengaged in business on a large scale, and the suspicion which attaches to\r\nthe machine itself has begun to attach also to business enterprises, just\r\nbecause these connections are known to exist. If these connections were\r\nopen and avowed, if everybody knew just what they involved and just what\r\nuse was being made of them, there would be no difficulty in keeping an eye\r\nupon affairs and in controlling them by public opinion. But,\r\nunfortunately, the whole process of law-making in America is a very\r\nobscure one. There is no highway of legislation, but there are many\r\nby-ways. Parties are not organized in such a way in our legislatures as to\r\nmake any one group of men avowedly responsible for the course of\r\nlegislation. The whole process of discussion, if any discussion at all\r\ntakes place, is private and shut away from public scrutiny and knowledge.\r\nThere are so many circles within circles, there are so many indirect and\r\nprivate ways of getting at legislative action, that our communities are\r\nconstantly uneasy during legislative sessions. It is this confusion and\r\nobscurity and privacy of our legislative method that gives the political\r\nmachine its opportunity. There is no publicly responsible man or group of\r\nmen who are known to formulate legislation and to take charge of it from\r\nthe time of its introduction until the time of its enactment. It has,\r\ntherefore, been possible for an outside force,--the political machine, the\r\nbody of men who nominated the legislators and who conducted the contest\r\nfor their election,--to assume the rôle of control. Business men who\r\ndesired something done in the way of changing the law under which they\r\nwere acting, or who wished to prevent legislation which seemed to them to\r\nthreaten their own interests, have known that there was this definite body\r\nof persons to resort to, and they have made terms with them. They have\r\nagreed to supply them with money for campaign expenses and to stand by\r\nthem in all other cases where money was necessary if in return they might\r\nresort to them for protection or for assistance in matters of legislation.\r\nLegislators looked to a certain man who was not even a member of their\r\nbody for instructions as to what they were to do with particular bills.\r\nThe machine, which was the centre of party organization, was the natural\r\ninstrument of control, and men who had business interests to promote\r\nnaturally resorted to the body which exercised the control.\r\n\r\nThere need have been nothing sinister about this. If the whole matter had\r\nbeen open and candid and honest, public criticism would not have centred\r\nupon it. But the use of money always results in demoralization, and goes\r\nbeyond demoralization to actual corruption. There are two kinds of\r\ncorruption,--the crude and obvious sort, which consists in direct bribery,\r\nand the much subtler, more dangerous, sort, which consists in a corruption\r\nof the will. Business men who have tried to set up a control in politics\r\nthrough the machine have more and more deceived themselves, have allowed\r\nthemselves to think that the whole matter was a necessary means of\r\nself-defence, have said that it was a necessary outcome of our political\r\nsystem. Having reassured themselves in this way, they have drifted from\r\none thing to another until the questions of morals involved have become\r\nhopelessly obscured and submerged. How far away from the ideals of their\r\nyouth have many of our men of business drifted, enmeshed in the vicious\r\nsystem,--how far away from the days when their fine young manhood was\r\nwrapped in \"that chastity of honor which felt a stain like a wound!\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the happy circumstances of our time that the most intelligent\r\nof our business men have seen the mistake as well as the immorality of the\r\nwhole bad business. The alliance between business and politics has been a\r\nburden to them,--an advantage, no doubt, upon occasion, but a very\r\nquestionable and burdensome advantage. It has given them great power, but\r\nit has also subjected them to a sort of slavery and a bitter sort of\r\nsubserviency to politicians. They are as anxious to be freed from bondage\r\nas the country is to be rid of the influences and methods which it\r\nrepresents. Leading business men are now becoming great factors in the\r\nemancipation of the country from a system which was leading from bad to\r\nworse. There are those, of course, who are wedded to the old ways and who\r\nwill stand out for them to the last, but they will sink into a minority\r\nand be overcome. The rest have found that their old excuse (namely, that\r\nit was necessary to defend themselves against unfair legislation) is no\r\nlonger a good excuse; that there is a better way of defending themselves\r\nthan through the private use of money. That better way is to take the\r\npublic into their confidence, to make absolutely open all their dealings\r\nwith legislative bodies and legislative officers, and let the public judge\r\nas between them and those with whom they are dealing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis discovery on their part of what ought to have been obvious all along\r\npoints out the way of reform; for undoubtedly publicity comes very near\r\nbeing the cure-all for political and economic maladies of this sort. But\r\npublicity will continue to be very difficult so long as our methods of\r\nlegislation are so obscure and devious and private. I think it will become\r\nmore and more obvious that the way to purify our politics is to simplify\r\nthem, and that the way to simplify them is to establish responsible\r\nleadership. We now have no leadership at all inside our legislative\r\nbodies,--at any rate, no leadership which is definite enough to attract\r\nthe attention and watchfulness of the country. Our only leadership being\r\nthat of irresponsible persons outside the legislatures who constitute the\r\npolitical machines, it is extremely difficult for even the most watchful\r\npublic opinion to keep track of the circuitous methods pursued. This\r\nundoubtedly lies at the root of the growing demand on the part of American\r\ncommunities everywhere for responsible leadership, for putting in\r\nauthority and keeping in authority those whom they know and whom they can\r\nwatch and whom they can constantly hold to account. The business of the\r\ncountry ought to be served by thoughtful and progressive legislation, but\r\nit ought to be served openly, candidly, advantageously, with a careful\r\nregard to letting everybody be heard and every interest be considered, the\r\ninterest which is not backed by money as well as the interest which is;\r\nand this can be accomplished only by some simplification of our methods\r\nwhich will centre the public trust in small groups of men who will lead,\r\nnot by reason of legal authority, but by reason of their contact with and\r\namenability to public opinion.\r\n\r\nI am striving to indicate my belief that our legislative methods may well\r\nbe reformed in the direction of giving more open publicity to every act,\r\nin the direction of setting up some form of responsible leadership on the\r\nfloor of our legislative halls so that the people may know who is back of\r\nevery bill and back of the opposition to it, and so that it may be dealt\r\nwith in the open chamber rather than in the committee room. The light must\r\nbe let in on all processes of law-making.\r\n\r\nLegislation, as we nowadays conduct it, is not conducted in the open. It\r\nis not threshed out in open debate upon the floors of our assemblies. It\r\nis, on the contrary, framed, digested, and concluded in committee rooms.\r\nIt is in committee rooms that legislation not desired by the interests\r\ndies. It is in committee rooms that legislation desired by the interests\r\nis framed and brought forth. There is not enough debate of it in open\r\nhouse, in most cases, to disclose the real meaning of the proposals made.\r\nClauses lie quietly unexplained and unchallenged in our statutes which\r\ncontain the whole gist and purpose of the act; qualifying phrases which\r\nescape the public attention, casual definitions which do not attract\r\nattention, classifications so technical as not to be generally understood,\r\nand which every one most intimately concerned is careful not to explain or\r\nexpound, contain the whole purpose of the law. Only after it has been\r\nenacted and has come to adjudication in the courts is its scheme as a\r\nwhole divulged. The beneficiaries are then safe behind their bulwarks.\r\n\r\nOf course, the chief triumphs of committee work, of covert phrase and\r\nunexplained classification, are accomplished in the framing of tariffs.\r\nEver since the passage of the outrageous Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act our\r\npeople have been discovering the concealed meanings and purposes which lay\r\nhidden in it. They are discovering item by item how deeply and\r\ndeliberately they were deceived and cheated. This did not happen by\r\naccident; it came about by design, by elaborated, secret design. Questions\r\nput upon the floor in the House and Senate were not frankly or truly\r\nanswered, and an elaborate piece of legislation was foisted on the country\r\nwhich could not possibly have passed if it had been generally\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nAnd we know, those of us who handle the machinery of politics, that the\r\ngreat difficulty in breaking up the control of the political boss is that\r\nhe is backed by the money and the influence of these very people who are\r\nintrenched in these very schedules. The tariff could never have been built\r\nup item by item by public discussion, and it never could have passed, if\r\nitem by item it had been explained to the people of this country. It was\r\nbuilt up by arrangement and by the subtle management of a political\r\norganization represented in the Senate of the United States by the senior\r\nSenator from Rhode Island, and in the House of Representatives by one of\r\nthe Representatives from Illinois. These gentlemen did not build that\r\ntariff upon the evidence that was given before the Committee on Ways and\r\nMeans as to what the manufacturer and the workingmen, the consumers and\r\nthe producers, of this country want. It was not built upon what the\r\ninterests of the country called for. It was built upon understandings\r\narrived at outside of the rooms where testimony was given and debate was\r\nheld.\r\n\r\nI am not even now suggesting corrupt influence. That is not my point.\r\nCorruption is a very difficult thing to manage in its literal sense. The\r\npayment of money is very easily detected, and men of this kind who control\r\nthese interests by secret arrangement would not consent to receive a\r\ndollar in money. They are following their own principles,--that is to say,\r\nthe principles which they think and act upon,--and they think that they\r\nare perfectly honorable and incorruptible men; but they believe one thing\r\nthat I do not believe and that it is evident the people of the country do\r\nnot believe: they believe that the prosperity of the country depends upon\r\nthe arrangements which certain party leaders make with certain business\r\nleaders. They believe that, but the proposition has merely to be stated\r\nto the jury to be rejected. The prosperity of this country depends upon\r\nthe interests of all of us and cannot be brought about by arrangement\r\nbetween any groups of persons. Take any question you like out to the\r\ncountry,--let it be threshed out in public debate,--and you will have made\r\nthese methods impossible.\r\n\r\nThis is what sometimes happens: They promise you a particular piece of\r\nlegislation. As soon as the legislature meets, a bill embodying that\r\nlegislation is introduced. It is referred to a committee. You never hear\r\nof it again. What happened? Nobody knows what happened.\r\n\r\nI am not intimating that corruption creeps in; I do not know what creeps\r\nin. The point is that we not only do not know, but it is intimated, if we\r\nget inquisitive, that it is none of our business. My reply is that it is\r\nour business, and it is the business of every man in the state; we have a\r\nright to know all the particulars of that bill's history. There is not any\r\nlegitimate privacy about matters of government. Government must, if it is\r\nto be pure and correct in its processes, be absolutely public in\r\neverything that affects it. I cannot imagine a public man with a\r\nconscience having a secret that he would keep from the people about their\r\nown affairs.\r\n\r\nI know how some of these gentlemen reason. They say that the influences to\r\nwhich they are yielding are perfectly legitimate influences, but that if\r\nthey were disclosed they would not be understood. Well, I am very sorry,\r\nbut nothing is legitimate that cannot be understood. If you cannot explain\r\nit properly, then there is something about it that cannot _be_ explained\r\nat all. I know from the circumstances of the case, not what is happening,\r\nbut that something private is happening, and that every time one of these\r\nbills gets into committee, something private stops it, and it never comes\r\nout again unless forced out by the agitation of the press or the courage\r\nand revolt of brave men in the legislature. I have known brave men of that\r\nsort. I could name some splendid examples of men who, as representatives\r\nof the people, demanded to be told by the chairman of the committee why\r\nthe bill was not reported, and who, when they could not find out from him,\r\ninvestigated and found out for themselves and brought the bill out by\r\nthreatening to tell the reason on the floor of the House.\r\n\r\nThose are private processes. Those are processes which stand between the\r\npeople and the things that are promised them, and I say that until you\r\ndrive all of those things into the open, you are not connected with your\r\ngovernment; you are not represented; you are not participants in your\r\ngovernment. Such a scheme of government by private understanding deprives\r\nyou of representation, deprives the people of representative institutions.\r\nIt has got to be put into the heads of legislators that public business is\r\npublic business. I hold the opinion that there can be no confidences as\r\nagainst the people with respect to their government, and that it is the\r\nduty of every public officer to explain to his fellow-citizens whenever he\r\ngets a chance,--explain exactly what is going on inside of his own office.\r\n\r\nThere is no air so wholesome as the air of utter publicity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are other tracts of modern life where jungles have grown up that\r\nmust be cut down. Take, for example, the entirely illegitimate extensions\r\nmade of the idea of private property for the benefit of modern\r\ncorporations and trusts. A modern joint stock corporation cannot in any\r\nproper sense be said to base its rights and powers upon the principles of\r\nprivate property. Its powers are wholly derived from legislation. It\r\npossesses them for the convenience of business at the sufferance of the\r\npublic. Its stock is widely owned, passes from hand to hand, brings\r\nmultitudes of men into its shifting partnerships and connects it with the\r\ninterests and the investments of whole communities. It is a segment of the\r\npublic; bears no analogy to a partnership or to the processes by which\r\nprivate property is safeguarded and managed, and should not be suffered to\r\nafford any covert whatever to those who are managing it. Its management is\r\nof public and general concern, is in a very proper sense everybody's\r\nbusiness. The business of many of those corporations which we call\r\npublic-service corporations, and which are indispensable to our daily\r\nlives and serve us with transportation and light and water and\r\npower,--their business, for instance, is clearly public business; and,\r\ntherefore, we can and must penetrate their affairs by the light of\r\nexamination and discussion.\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey the people have realized this for a long time, and a year or\r\ntwo ago we got our ideas on the subject enacted into legislation. The\r\ncorporations involved opposed the legislation with all their might. They\r\ntalked about ruin,--and I really believe they did think they would be\r\nsomewhat injured. But they have not been. And I hear I cannot tell you how\r\nmany men in New Jersey say: \"Governor, we were opposed to you; we did not\r\nbelieve in the things you wanted to do, but now that you have done them,\r\nwe take off our hats. That was the thing to do, it did not hurt us a bit;\r\nit just put us on a normal footing; it took away suspicion from our\r\nbusiness.\" New Jersey, having taken the cold plunge, cries out to the rest\r\nof the states, \"Come on in! The water's fine!\" I wonder whether these men\r\nwho are controlling the government of the United States realize how they\r\nare creating every year a thickening atmosphere of suspicion, in which\r\npresently they will find that business cannot breathe?\r\n\r\nSo I take it to be a necessity of the hour to open up all the processes of\r\npolitics and of public business,--open them wide to public view; to make\r\nthem accessible to every force that moves, every opinion that prevails in\r\nthe thought of the people; to give society command of its own economic\r\nlife again, not by revolutionary measures, but by a steady application of\r\nthe principle that the people have a right to look into such matters and\r\nto control them; to cut all privileges and patronage and private advantage\r\nand secret enjoyment out of legislation.\r\n\r\nWherever any public business is transacted, wherever plans affecting the\r\npublic are laid, or enterprises touching the public welfare, comfort, or\r\nconvenience go forward, wherever political programs are formulated, or\r\ncandidates agreed on,--over that place a voice must speak, with the divine\r\nprerogative of a people's will, the words: \"Let there be light!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE TARIFF--\"PROTECTION,\" OR SPECIAL PRIVILEGE?\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery business question, in this country, comes back, sooner or later, to\r\nthe question of the tariff. You cannot escape from it, no matter in which\r\ndirection you go. The tariff is situated in relation to other questions\r\nlike Boston Common in the old arrangement of that interesting city. I\r\nremember seeing once, in _Life_, a picture of a man standing at the door\r\nof one of the railway stations in Boston and inquiring of a Bostonian the\r\nway to the Common. \"Take any of these streets,\" was the reply, \"in either\r\ndirection.\" Now, as the Common was related to the winding streets of\r\nBoston, so the tariff question is related to the economic questions of our\r\nday. Take any direction and you will sooner or later get to the Common.\r\nAnd, in discussing the tariff you may start at the centre and go in any\r\ndirection you please.\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate by standing at the centre, the Common itself. As far\r\nback as 1828, when they knew nothing about \"practical politics\" as\r\ncompared with what we know now, a tariff bill was passed which was called\r\nthe \"Tariff of Abominations,\" because it had no beginning nor end nor\r\nplan. It had no traceable pattern in it. It was as if the demands of\r\neverybody in the United States had all been thrown indiscriminately into\r\none basket and that basket presented as a piece of legislation. It had\r\nbeen a general scramble and everybody who scrambled hard enough had been\r\ntaken care of in the schedules resulting. It was an abominable thing to\r\nthe thoughtful men of that day, because no man guided it, shaped it, or\r\ntried to make an equitable system out of it. That was bad enough, but at\r\nleast everybody had an open door through which to scramble for his\r\nadvantage. It was a go-as-you-please, free-for-all struggle, and anybody\r\nwho could get to Washington and say he represented an important business\r\ninterest could be heard by the Committee on Ways and Means.\r\n\r\nWe have a very different state of affairs now. The Committee on Ways and\r\nMeans and the Finance Committee of the Senate in these sophisticated days\r\nhave come to discriminate by long experience among the persons whose\r\ncounsel they are to take in respect of tariff legislation. There has been\r\nsubstituted for the unschooled body of citizens that used to clamor at the\r\ndoors of the Finance Committee and the Committee on Ways and Means, one of\r\nthe most interesting and able bodies of expert lobbyists that has ever\r\nbeen developed in the experience of any country,--men who know so much\r\nabout the matters they are talking of that you cannot put your knowledge\r\ninto competition with theirs. They so overwhelm you with their familiarity\r\nwith detail that you cannot discover wherein their scheme lies. They\r\nsuggest the change of an innocent fraction in a particular schedule and\r\nexplain it to you so plausibly that you cannot see that it means millions\r\nof dollars additional from the consumers of this country. They propose,\r\nfor example, to put the carbon for electric lights in two-foot pieces\r\ninstead of one-foot pieces,--and you do not see where you are getting\r\nsold, because you are not an expert. If you will get some expert to go\r\nthrough the schedules of the present Payne-Aldrich tariff, you will find a\r\n\"nigger\" concealed in almost every woodpile,--some little word, some\r\nlittle clause, some unsuspected item, that draws thousands of dollars out\r\nof the pockets of the consumer and yet does not seem to mean anything in\r\nparticular. They have calculated the whole thing beforehand; they have\r\nanalyzed the whole detail and consequence, each one in his specialty. With\r\nthe tariff specialist the average business man has no possibility of\r\ncompetition. Instead of the old scramble, which was bad enough, we get the\r\npresent expert control of the tariff schedules. Thus the relation between\r\nbusiness and government becomes, not a matter of the exposure of all the\r\nsensitive parts of the government to all the active parts of the people,\r\nbut the special impression upon them of a particular organized force in\r\nthe business world.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, every expedient and device of secrecy is brought into use to\r\nkeep the public unaware of the arguments of the high protectionists, and\r\nignorant of the facts which refute them; and uninformed of the intentions\r\nof the framers of the proposed legislation. It is notorious, even, that\r\nmany members of the Finance Committee of the Senate did not know the\r\nsignificance of the tariff schedules which were reported in the present\r\ntariff bill to the Senate, and that members of the Senate who asked Mr.\r\nAldrich direct questions were refused the information they sought;\r\nsometimes, I dare say, because he could not give it, and sometimes, I\r\nventure to say, because disclosure of the information would have\r\nembarrassed the passage of the measure. There were essential papers,\r\nmoreover, which could not be got at.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTake that very interesting matter, that will-o'-the-wisp, known as \"the\r\ncost of production.\" It is hard for any man who has ever studied\r\neconomics at all to restrain a cynical smile when he is told that an\r\nintelligent group of his fellow-citizens are looking for \"the cost of\r\nproduction\" as a basis for tariff legislation. It is not the same in any\r\none factory for two years together. It is not the same in one industry\r\nfrom one season to another. It is not the same in one country at two\r\ndifferent epochs. It is constantly eluding your grasp. It nowhere exists,\r\nas a scientific, demonstrable fact. But, in order to carry out the\r\npretences of the \"protective\" program, it was necessary to go through the\r\nmotions of finding out what it was. I am credibly informed that the\r\ngovernment of the United States requested several foreign governments,\r\namong others the government of Germany, to supply it with as reliable\r\nfigures as possible concerning the cost of producing certain articles\r\ncorresponding with those produced in the United States. The German\r\ngovernment put the matter into the hands of certain of her manufacturers,\r\nwho sent in just as complete answers as they could procure from their\r\nbooks. The information reached our government during the course of the\r\ndebate on the Payne-Aldrich Bill and was transmitted,--for the bill by\r\nthat time had reached the Senate,--to the Finance Committee of the Senate.\r\nBut I am told,--and I have no reason to doubt it,--that it never came out\r\nof the pigeonholes of the committee. I don't know, and that committee\r\ndoesn't know, what the information it contained was. When Mr. Aldrich was\r\nasked about it, he first said it was not an official report from the\r\nGerman government. Afterward he intimated that it was an impudent attempt\r\non the part of the German government to interfere with tariff legislation\r\nin the United States. But he never said what the cost of production\r\ndisclosed by it was. If he had, it is more than likely that some of the\r\nschedules would have been shown to be entirely unjustifiable.\r\n\r\nSuch instances show you just where the centre of gravity is,--and it is a\r\nmatter of gravity indeed, for it is a very grave matter! It lay during the\r\nlast Congress in the one person who was the accomplished intermediary\r\nbetween the expert lobbyists and the legislation of Congress. I am not\r\nsaying this in derogation of the character of Mr. Aldrich. It is no\r\nconcern of mine what kind of man Mr. Aldrich is; now, particularly, when\r\nhe has retired from public life, is it a matter of indifference. The point\r\nis that he, because of his long experience, his long handling of these\r\ndelicate and private matters, was the usual and natural instrument by\r\nwhich the Congress of the United States informed itself, not as to the\r\nwishes of the people of the United States or of the rank and file of\r\nbusiness men of the country, but as to the needs and arguments of the\r\nexperts who came to arrange matters with the committees.\r\n\r\nThe moral of the whole matter is this: The business of the United States\r\nis not as a whole in contact with the government of the United States. So\r\nsoon as it is, the matters which now give you, and justly give you, cause\r\nfor uneasiness will disappear. Just so soon as the business of this\r\ncountry has general, free, welcome access to the councils of Congress, all\r\nthe friction between business and politics will disappear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe tariff question is not the question that it was fifteen or twenty or\r\nthirty years ago. It used to be said by the advocates of the tariff that\r\nit made no difference even if there were a great wall separating us from\r\nthe commerce of the world, because inside the United States there was so\r\nenormous an area of absolute free trade that competition within the\r\ncountry kept prices down to a normal level; that so long as one state\r\ncould compete with all the others in the United States, and all the others\r\ncompete with it, there would be only that kind of advantage gained which\r\nis gained by superior brain, superior economy, the better plant, the\r\nbetter administration; all of the things that have made America supreme,\r\nand kept prices in America down, because American genius was competing\r\nwith American genius. I must add that so long as that was true, there was\r\nmuch to be said in defence of the protective tariff.\r\n\r\nBut the point now is that the protective tariff has been taken advantage\r\nof by some men to destroy domestic competition, to combine all existing\r\nrivals within our free-trade area, and to make it impossible for new men\r\nto come into the field. Under the high tariff there has been formed a\r\nnetwork of factories which in their connection dominate the market of the\r\nUnited States and establish their own prices. Whereas, therefore, it was\r\nonce arguable that the high tariff did not create the high cost of living,\r\nit is now no longer arguable that these combinations do not,--not by\r\nreason of the tariff, but by reason of their combination under the\r\ntariff,--settle what prices shall be paid; settle how much the product\r\nshall be; and settle, moreover, what shall be the market for labor.\r\n\r\nThe \"protective\" policy, as we hear it proclaimed to-day, bears no\r\nrelation to the original doctrine enunciated by Webster and Clay. The\r\n\"infant industries,\" which those statesmen desired to encourage, have\r\ngrown up and grown gray, but they have always had new arguments for\r\nspecial favors. Their demands have gone far beyond what they dared ask for\r\nin the days of Mr. Blaine and Mr. McKinley, though both those apostles of\r\n\"protection\" were, before they died, ready to confess that the time had\r\neven then come to call a halt on the claims of the subsidized industries.\r\nWilliam McKinley, before he died, showed symptoms of adjustment to the new\r\nage such as his successors have not exhibited. You remember what the\r\nutterances of Mr. McKinley's last month were with regard to the policy\r\nwith which his name is particularly identified; I mean the policy of\r\n\"protection.\" You remember how he joined in opinion with what Mr. Blaine\r\nbefore him had said--namely, that we had devoted the country to a policy\r\nwhich, too rigidly persisted in, was proving a policy of restriction; and\r\nthat we must look forward to a time that ought to come very soon when we\r\nshould enter into reciprocal relations of trade with all the countries of\r\nthe world. This was another way of saying that we must substitute\r\nelasticity for rigidity; that we must substitute trade for closed ports.\r\nMcKinley saw what his successors did not see. He saw that we had made for\r\nourselves a strait-jacket.\r\n\r\nWhen I reflect upon the \"protective\" policy of this country, and observe\r\nthat it is the later aspects and the later uses of that policy which have\r\nbuilt up trusts and monopoly in the United States, I make this contrast in\r\nmy thought: Mr. McKinley had already uttered his protest against what he\r\nforesaw; his successor saw what McKinley had only foreseen, but he took no\r\naction. His successor saw those very special privileges, which Mr.\r\nMcKinley himself began to suspect, used by the men who had obtained them\r\nto build up a monopoly for themselves, making freedom of enterprise in\r\nthis country more and more difficult. I am one of those who have the\r\nutmost confidence that Mr. McKinley would not have sanctioned the later\r\ndevelopments of the policy with which his name stands identified.\r\n\r\nWhat is the present tariff policy of the protectionists? It is not the\r\nancient protective policy to which I would give all due credit, but an\r\nentirely new doctrine. I ask anybody who is interested in the history of\r\nhigh \"protective\" tariffs to compare the latest platforms of the two\r\n\"protective\" tariff parties with the old doctrine. Men have been struck,\r\nstudents of this matter, by an entirely new departure. The new doctrine of\r\nthe protectionist is that the tariff should represent the difference\r\nbetween the cost of production in America and the cost of production in\r\nother countries, _plus_ a reasonable profit to those who are engaged in\r\nindustry. This is the new part of the protective doctrine: \"_plus_ a\r\nreasonable profit.\" It openly guarantees profit to the men who come and\r\nask favors of Congress. The old idea of a protective tariff was designed\r\nto keep American industries alive and, therefore, keep American labor\r\nemployed. But the favors of protection have become so permanent that this\r\nis what has happened: Men, seeing that they need not fear foreign\r\ncompetition, have drawn together in great combinations. These combinations\r\ninclude factories (if it is a combination of factories) of all grades: old\r\nfactories and new factories, factories with antiquated machinery and\r\nfactories with brand-new machinery; factories that are economically and\r\nfactories that are not economically administered; factories that have\r\nbeen long in the family, which have been allowed to run down, and\r\nfactories with all the new modern inventions. As soon as the combination\r\nis effected the less efficient factories are generally put out of\r\noperation. But the stock issued in payment for them has to pay dividends.\r\nAnd the United States government guarantees profit on investment in\r\nfactories that have gone out of business. As soon as these combinations\r\nsee prices falling they reduce the hours of labor, they reduce production,\r\nthey reduce wages, they throw men out of employment,--in order to do what?\r\nIn order to keep the prices up in spite of their lack of efficiency.\r\n\r\nThere may have been a time when the tariff did not raise prices, but that\r\ntime is past; the tariff is now taken advantage of by the great\r\ncombinations in such a way as to give them control of prices. These things\r\ndo not happen by chance. It does not happen by chance that prices are and\r\nhave been rising faster here than in any other country. That river that\r\ndivides us from Canada divides us from much cheaper living,\r\nnotwithstanding that the Canadian Parliament levies duties on\r\nimportations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut \"Ah!\" exclaim those who do not understand what is going on; \"you will\r\nruin the country with your free trade!\" Who said free trade? Who proposed\r\nfree trade? You can't have free trade in the United States, because the\r\ngovernment of the United States is of necessity, with our present division\r\nof the field of taxation between the federal and state governments,\r\nsupported in large part by the duties collected at the ports. I should\r\nlike to ask some gentlemen if very much is collected in the way of duties\r\nat the ports under the particular tariff schedules under which they\r\noperate. Some of the duties are practically prohibitive, and there is no\r\ntariff to be got from them.\r\n\r\nWhen you buy an imported article, you pay a part of the price to the\r\nFederal government in the form of customs duty. But, as a rule, what you\r\nbuy is, not the imported article, but a domestic article, the price of\r\nwhich the manufacturer has been able to raise to a point equal to, or\r\nhigher than, the price of the foreign article _plus the duty_. But who\r\ngets the tariff tax in this case? The government? Oh, no; not at all. The\r\nmanufacturer. The American manufacturer, who says that while he can't sell\r\ngoods as low as the foreign manufacturer, all good Americans ought to buy\r\nof him and pay him a tax on every article for the privilege. Perhaps we\r\nought. The original idea was that, when he was just starting and needed\r\nsupport, we ought to buy of him, even if we had to pay a higher price,\r\ntill he could get on his feet. Now it is said that we ought to buy of him\r\nand pay him a price 15 to 120 per cent. higher than we need pay the\r\nforeign manufacturer, even if he is a six-foot, bearded \"infant,\" because\r\nthe cost of production is necessarily higher here than anywhere else. I\r\ndon't know why it should be. The American workingman used to be able to do\r\nso much more and better work than the foreigner that that more than\r\ncompensated for his higher wages and made him a good bargain at any wage.\r\n\r\nOf course, if we are going to agree to give any fellow-citizen who takes\r\na notion to go into some business or other for which the country is not\r\nespecially adapted,--if we are going to give him a bonus on every article\r\nhe produces big enough to make up for the handicap he labors under because\r\nof some natural reason or other,--why, we may indeed gloriously diversify\r\nour industries, but we shall beggar ourselves. On this principle, we shall\r\nhave in Connecticut, or Michigan, or somewhere else, miles of hothouses in\r\nwhich thousands of happy American workingmen, with full dinner-pails, will\r\nbe raising bananas,--to be sold at a quarter apiece. Some foolish person,\r\na benighted Democrat like as not, might timidly suggest that bananas were\r\na greater public blessing when they came from Jamaica and were three for a\r\nnickel, but what patriotic citizen would listen for a moment to the\r\ncriticisms of a person without any conception of the beauty and glory of\r\nthe great American banana industry, without realization of the proud\r\nsignificance of the fact that Old Glory floats over the biggest banana\r\nhothouses in the world!\r\n\r\nBut that is a matter on one side. What I am trying to point out to you\r\nnow is that this \"protective\" tariff, so-called, has become a means of\r\nfostering the growth of particular groups of industry at the expense of\r\nthe economic vitality of the rest of the country. What the people now\r\npropose is a very practical thing indeed: They propose to unearth these\r\nspecial privileges and to cut them out of the tariff. They propose not to\r\nleave a single concealed private advantage in the statutes concerning the\r\nduties that can possibly be eradicated without affecting the part of the\r\nbusiness that is sound and legitimate and which we all wish to see\r\npromoted.\r\n\r\nSome men talk as if the tariff-reformers, as if the Democrats, weren't\r\npart of the United States. I met a lady the other day, not an elderly\r\nlady, who said to me with pride: \"Why, I have been a Democrat ever since\r\nthey hunted them with dogs.\" And you would really suppose, to hear some\r\nmen talk, that Democrats were outlaws and did not share the life of the\r\nUnited States. Why, Democrats constitute nearly one half the voters of\r\nthis country. They are engaged in all sorts of enterprises, big and\r\nlittle. There isn't a walk of life or a kind of occupation in which you\r\nwon't find them; and, as a Philadelphia paper very wittily said the other\r\nday, they can't commit economic murder without committing economic\r\nsuicide. Do you suppose, therefore, that half of the population of the\r\nUnited States is going about to destroy the very foundations of our\r\neconomic life by simply running amuck amidst the schedules of the tariff?\r\nSome of the schedules are so tough that they wouldn't be hurt, if it did.\r\nBut that isn't the program, and anybody who says that it is simply doesn't\r\nunderstand the situation at all. All that the tariff-reformers claim is\r\nthis: that the partnership ought to be bigger than it is. Just because\r\nthere are so many of them, they know how many are outside. And let me tell\r\nyou, just as many Republicans are outside. The only thing I have against\r\nmy protectionist fellow-citizens is that they have allowed themselves to\r\nbe imposed upon so many years. Think of saying that the \"protective\"\r\ntariff is for the benefit of the workingman, in the presence of all those\r\nfacts that have just been disclosed in Lawrence, Mass., where the worst\r\nschedule of all--\"Schedule K\"--operates to keep men on wages on which they\r\ncannot live. Why, the audacity, the impudence, of the claim is what\r\nstrikes one; and in face of the fact that the workingmen of this country\r\nwho are in unprotected industries are better paid than those who are in\r\n\"protected\" industries; at any rate, in the conspicuous industries! The\r\nSteel schedule, I dare say, is rather satisfactory to those who\r\nmanufacture steel, but is it satisfactory to those who make the steel with\r\ntheir own tired hands? Don't you know that there are mills in which men\r\nare made to work seven days in the week for twelve hours a day, and in the\r\nthree hundred and sixty-five weary days of the year can't make enough to\r\npay their bills? And this in one of the giants among our industries, one\r\nof the undertakings which have thriven to gigantic size upon this very\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAh, the whole mass of the fraud is falling away, and men are beginning to\r\nsee disclosed little groups of persons maintaining a control over the\r\ndominant party and through the dominant party over the government, in\r\ntheir own interest, and not in the interest of the people of the United\r\nStates!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet me repeat: There cannot be free trade in the United States so long as\r\nthe established fiscal policy of the federal government is maintained. The\r\nfederal government has chosen throughout all the generations that have\r\npreceded us to maintain itself chiefly on indirect instead of direct\r\ntaxation. I dare say we shall never see a time when it can alter that\r\npolicy in any substantial degree; and there is no Democrat of\r\nthoughtfulness that I have met who contemplates a program of free trade.\r\n\r\nBut what we intend to do, what the House of Representatives has been\r\nattempting to do and will attempt to do again, and succeed in doing, is to\r\nweed this garden that we have been cultivating. Because, if we have been\r\nlaying at the roots of our industrial enterprises this fertilization of\r\nprotection, if we have been stimulating it by this policy, we have found\r\nthat the stimulation was not equal in respect of all the growths in the\r\ngarden, and that there are some growths, which every man can distinguish\r\nwith the naked eye, which have so overtopped the rest, which have so\r\nthrown the rest into destroying shadow, that it is impossible for the\r\nindustries of the United States as a whole to prosper under their\r\nblighting shade. In other words, we have found out that this that\r\nprofesses to be a process of protection has become a process of\r\nfavoritism, and that the favorites of this policy have flourished at the\r\nexpense of all the rest. And now we are going into this garden and weed\r\nit. We are going into this garden and give the little plants air and light\r\nin which to grow. We are going to pull up every root that has so spread\r\nitself as to draw the nutriment of the soil from the other roots. We are\r\ngoing in there to see to it that the fertilization of intelligence, of\r\ninvention, of origination, is once more applied to a set of industries now\r\nthreatening to be stagnant, because threatening to be too much\r\nconcentrated. The policy of freeing the country from the restrictive\r\ntariff will so variegate and multiply the undertakings in the country that\r\nthere will be a wider market and a greater competition for labor; it will\r\nlet the sun shine through the clouds again as once it shone on the free,\r\nindependent, unpatronized intelligence and energy of a great people.\r\n\r\nOne of the counts of the indictment against the so-called \"protective\"\r\ntariff is that it has robbed Americans of their independence,\r\nresourcefulness, and self-reliance. Our industry has grown invertebrate,\r\ncowardly, dependent on government aid. When I hear the argument of some of\r\nthe biggest business men in this country, that if you took the\r\n\"protection\" of the tariff off they would be overcome by the competition\r\nof the world, I ask where and when it happened that the boasted genius of\r\nAmerica became afraid to go out into the open and compete with the world?\r\nAre we children, are we wards, are we still such puerile infants that we\r\nhave to be fed out of a bottle? Isn't it true that we know how to make\r\nsteel in America better than anybody else in the world? Yet they say, \"For\r\nHeaven's sake don't expose us to the chill of prices coming from any other\r\nquarter of the globe.\" Mind you, we can compete with those prices. Steel\r\nis sold abroad, steel made in America is sold abroad in many of its forms,\r\nmuch cheaper than it is sold in America. It is so hard for people to get\r\nthat into their heads!\r\n\r\nWe set up a kindergarten in New York. We called it the Chamber of Horrors.\r\nWe exhibited there a great many things manufactured in the United States,\r\nwith the prices at which they were sold in the United States, and the\r\nprices at which they were sold outside of the United States, marked on\r\nthem. If you tell a woman that she can buy a sewing machine for eighteen\r\ndollars in Mexico that she has to pay thirty dollars for in the United\r\nStates, she will not heed it or she will forget it unless you take her and\r\nshow her the machine with the price marked on it. My very distinguished\r\nfriend, Senator Gore, of Oklahoma, made this interesting proposal: that\r\nwe should pass a law that every piece of goods sold in the United States\r\nshould have on it a label bearing the price at which it sells under the\r\ntariff and the price at which it would sell if there were no tariff, and\r\nthen the Senator suggests that we have a very easy solution for the tariff\r\nquestion. He does not want to oblige that great body of our\r\nfellow-citizens who have a conscientious belief in \"protection\" to turn\r\naway from it. He proposes that everybody who believes in the \"protective\"\r\ntariff should pay it and the rest of us should not; if they want to\r\nsubscribe, it is open to them to subscribe.\r\n\r\nAs for the rest of us, the time is coming when we shall not have to\r\nsubscribe. The people of this land have made up their minds to cut all\r\nprivilege and patronage out of our fiscal legislation, particularly out of\r\nthat part of it which affects the tariff. We have come to recognize in the\r\ntariff as it is now constructed, not a system of protection, but a system\r\nof favoritism, of privilege, too often granted secretly and by subterfuge,\r\ninstead of openly and frankly and legitimately, and we have determined to\r\nput an end to the whole bad business, not by hasty and drastic changes,\r\nbut by the adoption of an entirely new principle,--by the reformation of\r\nthe whole purpose of legislation of that kind. We mean that our tariff\r\nlegislation henceforth shall have as its object, not private profit, but\r\nthe general public development and benefit. We shall make our fiscal laws,\r\nnot like those who dole out favors, but like those who serve a nation. We\r\nare going to begin with those particular items where we find special\r\nprivilege intrenched. We know what those items are; these gentlemen have\r\nbeen kind enough to point them out themselves. What we are interested in\r\nfirst of all with regard to the tariff is getting the grip of special\r\ninterests off the throat of Congress. We do not propose that special\r\ninterests shall any longer camp in the rooms of the Committee on Ways and\r\nMeans of the House and the Finance Committee of the Senate. We mean that\r\nthose shall be places where the people of the United States shall come and\r\nbe represented, in order that everything may be done in the general\r\ninterest, and not in the interest of particular groups of persons who\r\nalready dominate the industries and the industrial development of this\r\ncountry. Because no matter how wise these gentlemen may be, no matter how\r\npatriotic, no matter how singularly they may be gifted with the power to\r\ndivine the right courses of business, there isn't any group of men in the\r\nUnited States or in any other country who are wise enough to have the\r\ndestinies of a great people put into their hands as trustees. We mean that\r\nbusiness in this land shall be released, emancipated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nMONOPOLY, OR OPPORTUNITY?\r\n\r\n\r\nGentlemen say, they have been saying for a long time, and, therefore, I\r\nassume that they believe, that trusts are inevitable. They don't say that\r\nbig business is inevitable. They don't say merely that the elaboration of\r\nbusiness upon a great co-operative scale is characteristic of our time and\r\nhas come about by the natural operation of modern civilization. We would\r\nadmit that. But they say that the particular kind of combinations that are\r\nnow controlling our economic development came into existence naturally and\r\nwere inevitable; and that, therefore, we have to accept them as\r\nunavoidable and administer our development through them. They take the\r\nanalogy of the railways. The railways were clearly inevitable if we were\r\nto have transportation, but railways after they are once built stay put.\r\nYou can't transfer a railroad at convenience; and you can't shut up one\r\npart of it and work another part. It is in the nature of what economists,\r\nthose tedious persons, call natural monopolies; simply because the whole\r\ncircumstances of their use are so stiff that you can't alter them. Such\r\nare the analogies which these gentlemen choose when they discuss the\r\nmodern trust.\r\n\r\nI admit the popularity of the theory that the trusts have come about\r\nthrough the natural development of business conditions in the United\r\nStates, and that it is a mistake to try to oppose the processes by which\r\nthey have been built up, because those processes belong to the very nature\r\nof business in our time, and that therefore the only thing we can do, and\r\nthe only thing we ought to attempt to do, is to accept them as inevitable\r\narrangements and make the best out of it that we can by regulation.\r\n\r\nI answer, nevertheless, that this attitude rests upon a confusion of\r\nthought. Big business is no doubt to a large extent necessary and natural.\r\nThe development of business upon a great scale, upon a great scale of\r\nco-operation, is inevitable, and, let me add, is probably desirable. But\r\nthat is a very different matter from the development of trusts, because\r\nthe trusts have not grown. They have been artificially created; they have\r\nbeen put together, not by natural processes, but by the will, the\r\ndeliberate planning will, of men who were more powerful than their\r\nneighbors in the business world, and who wished to make their power secure\r\nagainst competition.\r\n\r\nThe trusts do not belong to the period of infant industries. They are not\r\nthe products of the time, that old laborious time, when the great\r\ncontinent we live on was undeveloped, the young nation struggling to find\r\nitself and get upon its feet amidst older and more experienced\r\ncompetitors. They belong to a very recent and very sophisticated age, when\r\nmen knew what they wanted and knew how to get it by the favor of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nDid you ever look into the way a trust was made? It is very natural, in\r\none sense, in the same sense in which human greed is natural. If I\r\nhaven't efficiency enough to beat my rivals, then the thing I am inclined\r\nto do is to get together with my rivals and say: \"Don't let's cut each\r\nother's throats; let's combine and determine prices for ourselves;\r\ndetermine the output, and thereby determine the prices: and dominate and\r\ncontrol the market.\" That is very natural. That has been done ever since\r\nfreebooting was established. That has been done ever since power was used\r\nto establish control. The reason that the masters of combination have\r\nsought to shut out competition is that the basis of control under\r\ncompetition is brains and efficiency. I admit that any large corporation\r\nbuilt up by the legitimate processes of business, by economy, by\r\nefficiency, is natural; and I am not afraid of it, no matter how big it\r\ngrows. It can stay big only by doing its work more thoroughly than anybody\r\nelse. And there is a point of bigness,--as every business man in this\r\ncountry knows, though some of them will not admit it,--where you pass the\r\nlimit of efficiency and get into the region of clumsiness and\r\nunwieldiness. You can make your combine so extensive that you can't\r\ndigest it into a single system; you can get so many parts that you can't\r\nassemble them as you would an effective piece of machinery. The point of\r\nefficiency is overstepped in the natural process of development\r\noftentimes, and it has been overstepped many times in the artificial and\r\ndeliberate formation of trusts.\r\n\r\nA trust is formed in this way: a few gentlemen \"promote\" it--that is to\r\nsay, they get it up, being given enormous fees for their kindness, which\r\nfees are loaded on to the undertaking in the form of securities of one\r\nkind or another. The argument of the promoters is, not that every one who\r\ncomes into the combination can carry on his business more efficiently than\r\nhe did before; the argument is: we will assign to you as your share in the\r\npool twice, three times, four times, or five times what you could have\r\nsold your business for to an individual competitor who would have to run\r\nit on an economic and competitive basis. We can afford to buy it at such a\r\nfigure because we are shutting out competition. We can afford to make the\r\nstock of the combination half a dozen times what it naturally would be\r\nand pay dividends on it, because there will be nobody to dispute the\r\nprices we shall fix.\r\n\r\nTalk of that as sound business? Talk of that as inevitable? It is based\r\nupon nothing except power. It is not based upon efficiency. It is no\r\nwonder that the big trusts are not prospering in proportion to such\r\ncompetitors as they still have in such parts of their business as\r\ncompetitors have access to; they are prospering freely only in those\r\nfields to which competition has no access. Read the statistics of the\r\nSteel Trust, if you don't believe it. Read the statistics of any trust.\r\nThey are constantly nervous about competition, and they are constantly\r\nbuying up new competitors in order to narrow the field. The United States\r\nSteel Corporation is gaining in its supremacy in the American market only\r\nwith regard to the cruder manufactures of iron and steel, but wherever, as\r\nin the field of more advanced manufactures of iron and steel, it has\r\nimportant competitors, its portion of the product is not increasing, but\r\nis decreasing, and its competitors, where they have a foothold, are often\r\nmore efficient than it is.\r\n\r\nWhy? Why, with unlimited capital and innumerable mines and plants\r\neverywhere in the United States, can't they beat the other fellows in the\r\nmarket? Partly because they are carrying too much. Partly because they are\r\nunwieldy. Their organization is imperfect. They bought up inefficient\r\nplants along with efficient, and they have got to carry what they have\r\npaid for, even if they have to shut some of the plants up in order to make\r\nany interest on their investments; or, rather, not interest on their\r\ninvestments, because that is an incorrect word,--on their alleged\r\ncapitalization. Here we have a lot of giants staggering along under an\r\nalmost intolerable weight of artificial burdens, which they have put on\r\ntheir own backs, and constantly looking about lest some little pigmy with\r\na round stone in a sling may come out and slay them.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I want the pigmy to have a chance to come out. And I foresee\r\na time when the pigmies will be so much more athletic, so much more\r\nastute, so much more active, than the giants, that it will be a case of\r\nJack the giant-killer. Just let some of the youngsters I know have a\r\nchance and they'll give these gentlemen points. Lend them a little money.\r\nThey can't get any now. See to it that when they have got a local market\r\nthey can't be squeezed out of it. Give them a chance to capture that\r\nmarket and then see them capture another one and another one, until these\r\nmen who are carrying an intolerable load of artificial securities find\r\nthat they have got to get down to hard pan to keep their foothold at all.\r\nI am willing to let Jack come into the field with the giant, and if Jack\r\nhas the brains that some Jacks that I know in America have, then I should\r\nlike to see the giant get the better of him, with the load that he, the\r\ngiant, has to carry,--the load of water. For I'll undertake to put a\r\nwater-logged giant out of business any time, if you will give me a fair\r\nfield and as much credit as I am entitled to, and let the law do what from\r\ntime immemorial law has been expected to do,--see fair play.\r\n\r\nAs for watered stock, I know all the sophistical arguments, and they are\r\nmany, for capitalizing earning capacity. It is a very attractive and\r\ninteresting argument, and in some instances it is legitimately used. But\r\nthere is a line you cross, above which you are not capitalizing your\r\nearning capacity, but capitalizing your control of the market,\r\ncapitalizing the profits which you got by your control of the market, and\r\ndidn't get by efficiency and economy. These things are not hidden even\r\nfrom the layman. These are not half-hidden from college men. The college\r\nmen's days of innocence have passed, and their days of sophistication have\r\ncome. They know what is going on, because we live in a talkative world,\r\nfull of statistics, full of congressional inquiries, full of trials of\r\npersons who have attempted to live independently of the statutes of the\r\nUnited States; and so a great many things have come to light under oath,\r\nwhich we must believe upon the credibility of the witnesses who are,\r\nindeed, in many instances very eminent and respectable witnesses.\r\n\r\nI take my stand absolutely, where every progressive ought to take his\r\nstand, on the proposition that private monopoly is indefensible and\r\nintolerable. And there I will fight my battle. And I know how to fight it.\r\nEverybody who has even read the newspapers knows the means by which these\r\nmen built up their power and created these monopolies. Any decently\r\nequipped lawyer can suggest to you statutes by which the whole business\r\ncan be stopped. What these gentlemen do not want is this: they do not want\r\nto be compelled to meet all comers on equal terms. I am perfectly willing\r\nthat they should beat any competitor by fair means; but I know the foul\r\nmeans they have adopted, and I know that they can be stopped by law. If\r\nthey think that coming into the market upon the basis of mere efficiency,\r\nupon the mere basis of knowing how to manufacture goods better than\r\nanybody else and to sell them cheaper than anybody else, they can carry\r\nthe immense amount of water that they have put into their enterprises in\r\norder to buy up rivals, then they are perfectly welcome to try it. But\r\nthere must be no squeezing out of the beginner, no crippling his credit;\r\nno discrimination against retailers who buy from a rival; no threats\r\nagainst concerns who sell supplies to a rival; no holding back of raw\r\nmaterial from him; no secret arrangements against him. All the fair\r\ncompetition you choose, but no unfair competition of any kind. And then\r\nwhen unfair competition is eliminated, let us see these gentlemen carry\r\ntheir tanks of water on their backs. All that I ask and all I shall fight\r\nfor is that they shall come into the field against merit and brains\r\neverywhere. If they can beat other American brains, then they have got the\r\nbest brains.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to know how far brains go, as things now are, suppose you\r\ntry to match your better wares against these gentlemen, and see them\r\nundersell you before your market is any bigger than the locality and make\r\nit absolutely impossible for you to get a fast foothold. If you want to\r\nknow how brains count, originate some invention which will improve the\r\nkind of machinery they are using, and then see if you can borrow enough\r\nmoney to manufacture it. You may be offered something for your patent by\r\nthe corporation,--which will perhaps lock it up in a safe and go on using\r\nthe old machinery; but you will not be allowed to manufacture. I know men\r\nwho have tried it, and they could not get the money, because the great\r\nmoney lenders of this country are in the arrangement with the great\r\nmanufacturers of this country, and they do not propose to see their\r\ncontrol of the market interfered with by outsiders. And who are outsiders?\r\nWhy, all the rest of the people of the United States are outsiders.\r\n\r\nThey are rapidly making us outsiders with respect even of the things that\r\ncome from the bosom of the earth, and which belong to us in a peculiar\r\nsense. Certain monopolies in this country have gained almost complete\r\ncontrol of the raw material, chiefly in the mines, out of which the great\r\nbody of manufactures are carried on, and they now discriminate, when they\r\nwill, in the sale of that raw material between those who are rivals of the\r\nmonopoly and those who submit to the monopoly. We must soon come to the\r\npoint where we shall say to the men who own these essentials of industry\r\nthat they have got to part with these essentials by sale to all citizens\r\nof the United States with the same readiness and upon the same terms. Or\r\nelse we shall tie up the resources of this country under private control\r\nin such fashion as will make our independent development absolutely\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThere is another injustice that monopoly engages in. The trust that deals\r\nin the cruder products which are to be transformed into the more elaborate\r\nmanufactures often will not sell these crude products except upon the\r\nterms of monopoly,--that is to say, the people that deal with them must\r\nbuy exclusively from them. And so again you have the lines of development\r\ntied up and the connections of development knotted and fastened so that\r\nyou cannot wrench them apart.\r\n\r\nAgain, the manufacturing monopolies are so interlaced in their personal\r\nrelationships with the great shipping interests of this country, and with\r\nthe great railroads, that they can often largely determine the rates of\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\nThe people of this country are being very subtly dealt with. You know, of\r\ncourse, that, unless our Commerce Commissions are absolutely sleepless,\r\nyou can get rebates without calling them such at all. The most complicated\r\nstudy I know of is the classification of freight by the railway company.\r\nIf I wanted to make a special rate on a special thing, all I should have\r\nto do is to put it in a special class in the freight classification, and\r\nthe trick is done. And when you reflect that the twenty-four men who\r\ncontrol the United States Steel Corporation, for example, are either\r\npresidents or vice-presidents or directors in 55 per cent. of the railways\r\nof the United States, reckoning by the valuation of those railroads and\r\nthe amount of their stock and bonds, you know just how close the whole\r\nthing is knitted together in our industrial system, and how great the\r\ntemptation is. These twenty-four gentlemen administer that corporation as\r\nif it belonged to them. The amazing thing to me is that the people of the\r\nUnited States have not seen that the administration of a great business\r\nlike that is not a private affair; it is a public affair.\r\n\r\nI have been told by a great many men that the idea I have, that by\r\nrestoring competition you can restore industrial freedom, is based upon a\r\nfailure to observe the actual happenings of the last decades in this\r\ncountry; because, they say, it is just free competition that has made it\r\npossible for the big to crush the little.\r\n\r\nI reply, it is not free competition that has done that; it is illicit\r\ncompetition. It is competition of the kind that the law ought to stop, and\r\ncan stop,--this crushing of the little man.\r\n\r\nYou know, of course, how the little man is crushed by the trusts. He gets\r\na local market. The big concerns come in and undersell him in his local\r\nmarket, and that is the only market he has; if he cannot make a profit\r\nthere, he is killed. They can make a profit all through the rest of the\r\nUnion, while they are underselling him in his locality, and recouping\r\nthemselves by what they can earn elsewhere. Thus their competitors can be\r\nput out of business, one by one, wherever they dare to show a head.\r\nInasmuch as they rise up only one by one, these big concerns can see to it\r\nthat new competitors never come into the larger field. You have to begin\r\nsomewhere. You can't begin in space. You can't begin in an airship. You\r\nhave got to begin in some community. Your market has got to be your\r\nneighbors first and those who know you there. But unless you have\r\nunlimited capital (which of course you wouldn't have when you were\r\nbeginning) or unlimited credit (which these gentlemen can see to it that\r\nyou shan't get), they can kill you out in your local market any time they\r\ntry, on the same basis exactly as that on which they beat organized labor;\r\nfor they can sell at a loss in your market because they are selling at a\r\nprofit everywhere else, and they can recoup the losses by which they beat\r\nyou by the profits which they make in fields where they have beaten other\r\nfellows and put them out. If ever a competitor who by good luck has plenty\r\nof money does break into the wider market, then the trust has to buy him\r\nout, paying three or four times what the business is worth. Following\r\nsuch a purchase it has got to pay the interest on the price it has paid\r\nfor the business, and it has got to tax the whole people of the United\r\nStates, in order to pay the interest on what it borrowed to do that, or on\r\nthe stocks and bonds it issued to do it with. Therefore the big trusts,\r\nthe big combinations, are the most wasteful, the most uneconomical, and,\r\nafter they pass a certain size, the most inefficient, way of conducting\r\nthe industries of this country.\r\n\r\nA notable example is the way in which Mr. Carnegie was bought out of the\r\nsteel business. Mr. Carnegie could build better mills and make better\r\nsteel rails and make them cheaper than anybody else connected with what\r\nafterward became the United States Steel Corporation. They didn't dare\r\nleave him outside. He had so much more brains in finding out the best\r\nprocesses; he had so much more shrewdness in surrounding himself with the\r\nmost successful assistants; he knew so well when a young man who came into\r\nhis employ was fit for promotion and was ripe to put at the head of some\r\nbranch of his business and was sure to make good, that he could undersell\r\nevery mother's son of them in the market for steel rails. And they bought\r\nhim out at a price that amounted to three or four times,--I believe\r\nactually five times,--the estimated value of his properties and of his\r\nbusiness, because they couldn't beat him in competition. And then in what\r\nthey charged afterward for their product,--the product of his mills\r\nincluded,--they made us pay the interest on the four or five times the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nThat is the difference between a big business and a trust. A trust is an\r\narrangement to get rid of competition, and a big business is a business\r\nthat has survived competition by conquering in the field of intelligence\r\nand economy. A trust does not bring efficiency to the aid of business; it\r\n_buys efficiency out of business_. I am for big business, and I am against\r\nthe trusts. Any man who can survive by his brains, any man who can put the\r\nothers out of the business by making the thing cheaper to the consumer at\r\nthe same time that he is increasing its intrinsic value and quality, I\r\ntake off my hat to, and I say: \"You are the man who can build up the\r\nUnited States, and I wish there were more of you.\"\r\n\r\nThere will not be more, unless we find a way to prevent monopoly. You know\r\nperfectly well that a trust business staggering under a capitalization\r\nmany times too big is not a business that can afford to admit competitors\r\ninto the field; because the minute an economical business, a business with\r\nits capital down to hard pan, with every ounce of its capital working,\r\ncomes into the field against such an overloaded corporation, it will\r\ninevitably beat it and undersell it; therefore it is to the interest of\r\nthese gentlemen that monopoly be maintained. They cannot rule the markets\r\nof the world in any way but by monopoly. It is not surprising to find them\r\nhelping to found a new party with a fine program of benevolence, but also\r\nwith a tolerant acceptance of monopoly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is another matter to which we must direct our attention, whether we\r\nlike or not. I do not take these things into my mouth because they please\r\nmy palate; I do not talk about them because I want to attack anybody or\r\nupset anything; I talk about them because only by open speech about them\r\namong ourselves shall we learn what the facts are.\r\n\r\nYou will notice from a recent investigation that things like this take\r\nplace: A certain bank invests in certain securities. It appears from\r\nevidence that the handling of these securities was very intimately\r\nconnected with the maintenance of the price of a particular commodity.\r\nNobody ought, and in normal circumstances nobody would, for a moment think\r\nof suspecting the managers of a great bank of making such an investment in\r\norder to help those who were conducting a particular business in the\r\nUnited States maintain the price of their commodity; but the circumstances\r\nare not normal. It is beginning to be believed that in the big business of\r\nthis country nothing is disconnected from anything else. I do not mean in\r\nthis particular instance to which I have referred, and I do not have in\r\nmind to draw any inference at all, for that would be unjust; but take any\r\ninvestment of an industrial character by a great bank. It is known that\r\nthe directorate of that bank interlaces in personnel with ten, twenty,\r\nthirty, forty, fifty, sixty boards of directors of all sorts, of railroads\r\nwhich handle commodities, of great groups of manufacturers which\r\nmanufacture commodities, and of great merchants who distribute\r\ncommodities; and the result is that every great bank is under suspicion\r\nwith regard to the motive of its investments. It is at least considered\r\npossible that it is playing the game of somebody who has nothing to do\r\nwith banking, but with whom some of its directors are connected and joined\r\nin interest. The ground of unrest and uneasiness, in short, on the part of\r\nthe public at large, is the growing knowledge that many large undertakings\r\nare interlaced with one another, are indistinguishable from one another in\r\npersonnel.\r\n\r\nTherefore, when a small group of men approach Congress in order to induce\r\nthe committee concerned to concur in certain legislation, nobody knows the\r\nramifications of the interests which those men represent; there seems no\r\nfrank and open action of public opinion in public counsel, but every man\r\nis suspected of representing some other man and it is not known where his\r\nconnections begin or end.\r\n\r\nI am one of those who have been so fortunately circumstanced that I have\r\nhad the opportunity to study the way in which these things come about in\r\ncomplete disconnection from them, and I do not suspect that any man has\r\ndeliberately planned the system. I am not so uninstructed and misinformed\r\nas to suppose that there is a deliberate and malevolent combination\r\nsomewhere to dominate the government of the United States. I merely say\r\nthat, by certain processes, now well known, and perhaps natural in\r\nthemselves, there has come about an extraordinary and very sinister\r\nconcentration in the control of business in the country.\r\n\r\nHowever it has come about, it is more important still that the control of\r\ncredit also has become dangerously centralized. It is the mere truth to\r\nsay that the financial resources of the country are not at the command of\r\nthose who do not submit to the direction and domination of small groups of\r\ncapitalists who wish to keep the economic development of the country under\r\ntheir own eye and guidance. The great monopoly in this country is the\r\nmonopoly of big credits. So long as that exists, our old variety and\r\nfreedom and individual energy of development are out of the question. A\r\ngreat industrial nation is controlled by its system of credit. Our system\r\nof credit is privately concentrated. The growth of the nation, therefore,\r\nand all our activities are in the hands of a few men who, even if their\r\naction be honest and intended for the public interest, are necessarily\r\nconcentrated upon the great undertakings in which their own money is\r\ninvolved and who necessarily, by very reason of their own limitations,\r\nchill and check and destroy genuine economic freedom. This is the greatest\r\nquestion of all, and to this statesmen must address themselves with an\r\nearnest determination to serve the long future and the true liberties of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThis money trust, or, as it should be more properly called, this credit\r\ntrust, of which Congress has begun an investigation, is no myth; it is no\r\nimaginary thing. It is not an ordinary trust like another. It doesn't do\r\nbusiness every day. It does business only when there is occasion to do\r\nbusiness. You can sometimes do something large when it isn't watching, but\r\nwhen it is watching, you can't do much. And I have seen men squeezed by\r\nit; I have seen men who, as they themselves expressed it, were put \"out of\r\nbusiness by Wall Street,\" because Wall Street found them inconvenient and\r\ndidn't want their competition.\r\n\r\nLet me say again that I am not impugning the motives of the men in Wall\r\nStreet. They may think that that is the best way to create prosperity for\r\nthe country. When you have got the market in your hand, does honesty\r\noblige you to turn the palm upside down and empty it? If you have got the\r\nmarket in your hand and believe that you understand the interest of the\r\ncountry better than anybody else, is it patriotic to let it go? I can\r\nimagine them using this argument to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe dominating danger in this land is not the existence of great\r\nindividual combinations,--that is dangerous enough in all conscience,--but\r\nthe combination of the combinations,--of the railways, the manufacturing\r\nenterprises, the great mining projects, the great enterprises for the\r\ndevelopment of the natural water-powers of the country, threaded together\r\nin the personnel of a series of boards of directors into a \"community of\r\ninterest\" more formidable than any conceivable single combination that\r\ndare appear in the open.\r\n\r\nThe organization of business has become more centralized, vastly more\r\ncentralized, than the political organization of the country itself.\r\nCorporations have come to cover greater areas than states; have come to\r\nlive under a greater variety of laws than the citizen himself, have\r\nexcelled states in their budgets and loomed bigger than whole\r\ncommonwealths in their influence over the lives and fortunes of entire\r\ncommunities of men. Centralized business has built up vast structures of\r\norganization and equipment which overtop all states and seem to have no\r\nmatch or competitor except the federal government itself.\r\n\r\nWhat we have got to do,--and it is a colossal task not to be undertaken\r\nwith a light head or without judgment,--what we have got to do is to\r\ndisentangle this colossal \"community of interest.\" No matter how we may\r\npurpose dealing with a single combination in restraint of trade, you will\r\nagree with me in this, that no single, avowed, combination is big enough\r\nfor the United States to be afraid of; but when all the combinations are\r\ncombined and this final combination is not disclosed by any process of\r\nincorporation or law, but is merely an identity of personnel, or of\r\ninterest, then there is something that even the government of the nation\r\nitself might come to fear,--something for the law to pull apart, and\r\ngently, but firmly and persistently, dissect.\r\n\r\nYou know that the chemist distinguishes between a chemical combination and\r\nan amalgam. A chemical combination has done something which I cannot\r\nscientifically describe, but its molecules have become intimate with one\r\nanother and have practically united, whereas an amalgam has a mere\r\nphysical union created by pressure from without. Now, you can destroy that\r\nmere physical contact without hurting the individual elements, and this\r\ncommunity of interest is an amalgam; you can break it up without hurting\r\nany one of the single interests combined. Not that I am particularly\r\ndelicate of some of the interests combined,--I am not under bonds to be\r\nunduly polite to them,--but I am interested in the business of the\r\ncountry, and believe its integrity depends upon this dissection. I do not\r\nbelieve any one group of men has vision enough or genius enough to\r\ndetermine what the development of opportunity and the accomplishment by\r\nachievement shall be in this country.\r\n\r\nThe facts of the situation amount to this: that a comparatively small\r\nnumber of men control the raw material of this country; that a\r\ncomparatively small number of men control the water-powers that can be\r\nmade useful for the economical production of the energy to drive our\r\nmachinery; that that same number of men largely control the railroads;\r\nthat by agreements handed around among themselves they control prices, and\r\nthat that same group of men control the larger credits of the country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we undertake the strategy which is going to be necessary to overcome\r\nand destroy this far-reaching system of monopoly, we are rescuing the\r\nbusiness of this country, we are not injuring it; and when we separate the\r\ninterests from each other and dismember these communities of connection,\r\nwe have in mind a greater community of interest, a vaster community of\r\ninterest, the community of interest that binds the virtues of all men\r\ntogether, that community of mankind which is broad and catholic enough to\r\ntake under the sweep of its comprehension all sorts and conditions of men;\r\nthat vision which sees that no society is renewed from the top but that\r\nevery society is renewed from the bottom. Limit opportunity, restrict the\r\nfield of originative achievement, and you have cut out the heart and root\r\nof all prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that can ever make a free country is to keep a free and\r\nhopeful heart under every jacket in it. Honest American industry has\r\nalways thriven, when it has thriven at all, on freedom; it has never\r\nthriven on monopoly. It is a great deal better to shift for yourselves\r\nthan to be taken care of by a great combination of capital. I, for my\r\npart, do not want to be taken care of. I would rather starve a free man\r\nthan be fed a mere thing at the caprice of those who are organizing\r\nAmerican industry as they please to organize it. I know, and every man in\r\nhis heart knows, that the only way to enrich America is to make it\r\npossible for any man who has the brains to get into the game. I am not\r\njealous of the size of any business that has _grown_ to that size. I am\r\nnot jealous of any process of growth, no matter how huge the result,\r\nprovided the result was indeed obtained by the processes of wholesome\r\ndevelopment, which are the processes of efficiency, of economy, of\r\nintelligence, and of invention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nBENEVOLENCE, OR JUSTICE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctrine that monopoly is inevitable and that the only course open to\r\nthe people of the United States is to submit to and regulate it found a\r\nchampion during the campaign of 1912 in the new party, or branch of the\r\nRepublican party, founded under the leadership of Mr. Roosevelt, with the\r\nconspicuous aid,--I mention him with no satirical intention, but merely to\r\nset the facts down accurately,--of Mr. George W. Perkins, organizer of the\r\nSteel Trust and the Harvester Trust, and with the support of more than\r\nthree millions of citizens, many of them among the most patriotic,\r\nconscientious and high-minded men and women of the land. The fact that its\r\nacceptance of monopoly was a feature of the new party platform from which\r\nthe attention of the generous and just was diverted by the charm of a\r\nsocial program of great attractiveness to all concerned for the\r\namelioration of the lot of those who suffer wrong and privation, and the\r\nfurther fact that, even so, the platform was repudiated by the majority of\r\nthe nation, render it no less necessary to reflect on the significance of\r\nthe confession made for the first time by any party in the country's\r\nhistory. It may be useful, in order to the relief of the minds of many\r\nfrom an error of no small magnitude, to consider now, the heat of a\r\npresidential contest being past, exactly what it was that Mr. Roosevelt\r\nproposed.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt attached to his platform some very splendid suggestions as\r\nto noble enterprises which we ought to undertake for the uplift of the\r\nhuman race; but when I hear an ambitious platform put forth, I am very\r\nmuch more interested in the dynamics of it than in the rhetoric of it. I\r\nhave a very practical mind, and I want to know who are going to do those\r\nthings and how they are going to be done. If you have read the trust plank\r\nin that platform as often as I have read it, you have found it very long,\r\nbut very tolerant. It did not anywhere condemn monopoly, except in words;\r\nits essential meaning was that the trusts have been bad and must be made\r\nto be good. You know that Mr. Roosevelt long ago classified trusts for us\r\nas good and bad, and he said that he was afraid only of the bad ones. Now\r\nhe does not desire that there should be any more bad ones, but proposes\r\nthat they should all be made good by discipline, directly applied by a\r\ncommission of executive appointment. All he explicitly complains of is\r\nlack of publicity and lack of fairness; not the exercise of power, for\r\nthroughout that plank the power of the great corporations is accepted as\r\nthe inevitable consequence of the modern organization of industry. All\r\nthat it is proposed to do is to take them under control and regulation.\r\nThe national administration having for sixteen years been virtually under\r\nthe regulation of the trusts, it would be merely a family matter were the\r\nparts reversed and were the other members of the family to exercise the\r\nregulation. And the trusts, apparently, which might, in such\r\ncircumstances, comfortably continue to administer our affairs under the\r\nmollifying influences of the federal government, would then, if you\r\nplease, be the instrumentalities by which all the humanistic, benevolent\r\nprogram of the rest of that interesting platform would be carried out!\r\n\r\nI have read and reread that plank, so as to be sure that I get it right.\r\nAll that it complains of is,--and the complaint is a just one,\r\nsurely,--that these gentlemen exercise their power in a way that is\r\nsecret. Therefore, we must have publicity. Sometimes they are arbitrary;\r\ntherefore they need regulation. Sometimes they do not consult the general\r\ninterests of the community; therefore they need to be reminded of those\r\ngeneral interests by an industrial commission. But at every turn it is the\r\ntrusts who are to do us good, and not we ourselves.\r\n\r\nAgain, I absolutely protest against being put into the hands of trustees.\r\nMr. Roosevelt's conception of government is Mr. Taft's conception, that\r\nthe Presidency of the United States is the presidency of a board of\r\ndirectors. I am willing to admit that if the people of the United States\r\ncannot get justice for themselves, then it is high time that they should\r\njoin the third party and get it from somebody else. The justice proposed\r\nis very beautiful; it is very attractive; there were planks in that\r\nplatform which stir all the sympathies of the heart; they proposed things\r\nthat we all want to do; but the question is, Who is going to do them?\r\nThrough whose instrumentality? Are Americans ready to ask the trusts to\r\ngive us in pity what we ought, in justice, to take?\r\n\r\nThe third party says that the present system of our industry and trade has\r\ncome to stay. Mind you, these artificially built up things, these things\r\nthat can't maintain themselves in the market without monopoly, have come\r\nto stay, and the only thing that the government can do, the only thing\r\nthat the third party proposes should be done, is to set up a commission to\r\nregulate them. It accepts them. It says: \"We will not undertake, it were\r\nfutile to undertake, to prevent monopoly, but we will go into an\r\narrangement by which we will make these monopolies kind to you. We will\r\nguarantee that they shall be pitiful. We will guarantee that they shall\r\npay the right wages. We will guarantee that they shall do everything kind\r\nand public-spirited, which they have never heretofore shown the least\r\ninclination to do.\"\r\n\r\nDon't you realize that that is a blind alley? You can't find your way to\r\nliberty that way. You can't find your way to social reform through the\r\nforces that have made social reform necessary.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental part of such a program is that the trusts shall be\r\nrecognized as a permanent part of our economic order, and that the\r\ngovernment shall try to make trusts the ministers, the instruments,\r\nthrough which the life of this country shall be justly and happily\r\ndeveloped on its industrial side. Now, everything that touches our lives\r\nsooner or later goes back to the industries which sustain our lives. I\r\nhave often reflected that there is a very human order in the petitions in\r\nour Lord's prayer. For we pray first of all, \"Give us this day our daily\r\nbread,\" knowing that it is useless to pray for spiritual graces on an\r\nempty stomach, and that the amount of wages we get, the kind of clothes we\r\nwear, the kind of food we can afford to buy, is fundamental to everything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThose who administer our physical life, therefore, administer our\r\nspiritual life; and if we are going to carry out the fine purpose of that\r\ngreat chorus which supporters of the third party sang almost with\r\nreligious fervor, then we have got to find out through whom these purposes\r\nof humanity are going to be realized. It is a mere enterprise, so far as\r\nthat part of it is concerned, of making the monopolies philanthropic.\r\n\r\nI do not want to live under a philanthropy. I do not want to be taken care\r\nof by the government, either directly, or by any instruments through which\r\nthe government is acting. I want only to have right and justice prevail,\r\nso far as I am concerned. Give me right and justice and I will undertake\r\nto take care of myself. If you enthrone the trusts as the means of the\r\ndevelopment of this country under the supervision of the government, then\r\nI shall pray the old Spanish proverb, \"God save me from my friends, and\r\nI'll take care of my enemies.\" Because I want to be saved from these\r\nfriends. Observe that I say these friends, for I am ready to admit that a\r\ngreat many men who believe that the development of industry in this\r\ncountry through monopolies is inevitable intend to be the friends of the\r\npeople. Though they profess to be my friends, they are undertaking a way\r\nof friendship which renders it impossible that they should do me the\r\nfundamental service that I demand--namely, that I should be free and\r\nshould have the same opportunities that everybody else has.\r\n\r\nFor I understand it to be the fundamental proposition of American liberty\r\nthat we do not desire special privilege, because we know special privilege\r\nwill never comprehend the general welfare. This is the fundamental,\r\nspiritual difference between adherents of the party now about to take\r\ncharge of the government and those who have been in charge of it in recent\r\nyears. They are so indoctrinated with the idea that only the big business\r\ninterests of this country understand the United States and can make it\r\nprosperous that they cannot divorce their thoughts from that obsession.\r\nThey have put the government into the hands of trustees, and Mr. Taft and\r\nMr. Roosevelt were the rival candidates to preside over the board of\r\ntrustees. They were candidates to serve the people, no doubt, to the best\r\nof their ability, but it was not their idea to serve them directly; they\r\nproposed to serve them indirectly through the enormous forces already set\r\nup, which are so great that there is almost an open question whether the\r\ngovernment of the United States with the people back of it is strong\r\nenough to overcome and rule them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShall we try to get the grip of monopoly away from our lives, or shall we\r\nnot? Shall we withhold our hand and say monopoly is inevitable, that all\r\nthat we can do is to regulate it? Shall we say that all that we can do is\r\nto put government in competition with monopoly and try its strength\r\nagainst it? Shall we admit that the creature of our own hands is stronger\r\nthan we are? We have been dreading all along the time when the combined\r\npower of high finance would be greater than the power of the government.\r\nHave we come to a time when the President of the United States or any man\r\nwho wishes to be the President must doff his cap in the presence of this\r\nhigh finance, and say, \"You are our inevitable master, but we will see how\r\nwe can make the best of it?\"\r\n\r\nWe are at the parting of the ways. We have, not one or two or three, but\r\nmany, established and formidable monopolies in the United States. We have,\r\nnot one or two, but many, fields of endeavor into which it is difficult,\r\nif not impossible, for the independent man to enter. We have restricted\r\ncredit, we have restricted opportunity, we have controlled development,\r\nand we have come to be one of the worst ruled, one of the most completely\r\ncontrolled and dominated, governments in the civilized world--no longer a\r\ngovernment by free opinion, no longer a government by conviction and the\r\nvote of the majority, but a government by the opinion and the duress of\r\nsmall groups of dominant men.\r\n\r\nIf the government is to tell big business men how to run their business,\r\nthen don't you see that big business men have to get closer to the\r\ngovernment even than they are now? Don't you see that they must capture\r\nthe government, in order not to be restrained too much by it? Must capture\r\nthe government? They have already captured it. Are you going to invite\r\nthose inside to stay inside? They don't have to get there. They are there.\r\nAre you going to own your own premises, or are you not? That is your\r\nchoice. Are you going to say: \"You didn't get into the house the right\r\nway, but you are in there, God bless you; we will stand out here in the\r\ncold and you can hand us out something once in a while?\"\r\n\r\nAt the least, under the plan I am opposing, there will be an avowed\r\npartnership between the government and the trusts. I take it that the firm\r\nwill be ostensibly controlled by the senior member. For I take it that the\r\ngovernment of the United States is at least the senior member, though the\r\nyounger member has all along been running the business. But when all the\r\nmomentum, when all the energy, when a great deal of the genius, as so\r\noften happens in partnerships the world over, is with the junior partner,\r\nI don't think that the superintendence of the senior partner is going to\r\namount to very much. And I don't believe that benevolence can be read into\r\nthe hearts of the trusts by the superintendence and suggestions of the\r\nfederal government; because the government has never within my\r\nrecollection had its suggestions accepted by the trusts. On the contrary,\r\nthe suggestions of the trusts have been accepted by the government.\r\n\r\nThere is no hope to be seen for the people of the United States until the\r\npartnership is dissolved. And the business of the party now entrusted with\r\npower is going to be to dissolve it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThose who supported the third party supported, I believe, a program\r\nperfectly agreeable to the monopolies. How those who have been fighting\r\nmonopoly through all their career can reconcile the continuation of the\r\nbattle under the banner of the very men they have been fighting, I cannot\r\nimagine. I challenge the program in its fundamentals as not a progressive\r\nprogram at all. Why did Mr. Gary suggest this very method when he was at\r\nthe head of the Steel Trust? Why is this very method commended here,\r\nthere, and everywhere by the men who are interested in the maintenance of\r\nthe present economic system of the United States? Why do the men who do\r\nnot wish to be disturbed urge the adoption of this program? The rest of\r\nthe program is very handsome; there is beating in it a great pulse of\r\nsympathy for the human race. But I do not want the sympathy of the trusts\r\nfor the human race. I do not want their condescending assistance.\r\n\r\nAnd I warn every progressive Republican that by lending his assistance to\r\nthis program he is playing false to the very cause in which he had\r\nenlisted. That cause was a battle against monopoly, against control,\r\nagainst the concentration of power in our economic development, against\r\nall those things that interfere with absolutely free enterprise. I believe\r\nthat some day these gentlemen will wake up and realize that they have\r\nmisplaced their trust, not in an individual, it may be, but in a program\r\nwhich is fatal to the things we hold dearest.\r\n\r\nIf there is any meaning in the things I have been urging, it is this: that\r\nthe incubus that lies upon this country is the present monopolistic\r\norganization of our industrial life. That is the thing which certain\r\nRepublicans became \"insurgents\" in order to throw off. And yet some of\r\nthem allowed themselves to be so misled as to go into the camp of the\r\nthird party in order to remove what the third party proposed to legalize.\r\nMy point is that this is a method conceived from the point of view of the\r\nvery men who are to be controlled, and that this is just the wrong point\r\nof view from which to conceive it.\r\n\r\nI said not long ago that Mr. Roosevelt was promoting a plan for the\r\ncontrol of monopoly which was supported by the United States Steel\r\nCorporation. Mr. Roosevelt denied that he was being supported by more than\r\none member of that corporation. He was thinking of money. I was thinking\r\nof ideas. I did not say that he was getting money from these gentlemen; it\r\nwas a matter of indifference to me where he got his money; but it was a\r\nmatter of a great deal of difference to me where he got his ideas. He got\r\nhis idea with regard to the regulation of monopoly from the gentlemen who\r\nform the United States Steel Corporation. I am perfectly ready to admit\r\nthat the gentlemen who control the United States Steel Corporation have a\r\nperfect right to entertain their own ideas about this and to urge them\r\nupon the people of the United States; but I want to say that their ideas\r\nare not my ideas; and I am perfectly certain that they would not promote\r\nany idea which interfered with their monopoly. Inasmuch, therefore, as I\r\nhope and intend to interfere with monopoly just as much as possible, I\r\ncannot subscribe to arrangements by which they know that it will not be\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe Roosevelt plan is that there shall be an industrial commission charged\r\nwith the supervision of the great monopolistic combinations which have\r\nbeen formed under the protection of the tariff, and that the government of\r\nthe United States shall see to it that these gentlemen who have conquered\r\nlabor shall be kind to labor. I find, then, the proposition to be this:\r\nThat there shall be two masters, the great corporation, and over it the\r\ngovernment of the United States; and I ask who is going to be master of\r\nthe government of the United States? It has a master now,--those who in\r\ncombination control these monopolies. And if the government controlled by\r\nthe monopolies in its turn controls the monopolies, the partnership is\r\nfinally consummated.\r\n\r\nI don't care how benevolent the master is going to be, I will not live\r\nunder a master. That is not what America was created for. America was\r\ncreated in order that every man should have the same chance as every other\r\nman to exercise mastery over his own fortunes. What I want to do is\r\nanalogous to what the authorities of the city of Glasgow did with tenement\r\nhouses. I want to light and patrol the corridors of these great\r\norganizations in order to see that nobody who tries to traverse them is\r\nwaylaid and maltreated. If you will but hold off the adversaries, if you\r\nwill but see to it that the weak are protected, I will venture a wager\r\nwith you that there are some men in the United States, now weak,\r\neconomically weak, who have brains enough to compete with these gentlemen\r\nand who will presently come into the market and put these gentlemen on\r\ntheir mettle. And the minute they come into the market there will be a\r\nbigger market for labor and a different wage scale for labor.\r\n\r\nBecause it is susceptible of convincing proof that the high-paid labor of\r\nAmerica,--where it is high paid,--is cheaper than the low-paid labor of\r\nthe continent of Europe. Do you know that about ninety per cent. of those\r\nwho are employed in labor in this country are not employed in the\r\n\"protected\" industries, and that their wages are almost without exception\r\nhigher than the wages of those who are employed in the \"protected\"\r\nindustries? There is no corner on carpenters, there is no corner on\r\nbricklayers, there is no corner on scores of individual classes of skilled\r\nlaborers; but there is a corner on the poolers in the furnaces, there is a\r\ncorner on the men who dive down into the mines; they are in the grip of a\r\ncontrolling power which determines the market rates of wages in the United\r\nStates. Only where labor is free is labor highly paid in America.\r\n\r\nWhen I am fighting monopolistic control, therefore, I am fighting for the\r\nliberty of every man in America, and I am fighting for the liberty of\r\nAmerican industry.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that the spokesman for the plan of adopting monopoly\r\ndeclares his devoted adherence to the principle of \"protection.\" Only\r\nthose duties which are manifestly too high even to serve the interests of\r\nthose who are directly \"protected\" ought in his view to be lowered. He\r\ndeclares that he is not troubled by the fact that a very large amount of\r\nmoney is taken out of the pocket of the general taxpayer and put into the\r\npocket of particular classes of \"protected\" manufacturers, but that his\r\nconcern is that so little of this money gets into the pocket of the\r\nlaboring man and so large a proportion of it into the pockets of the\r\nemployers. I have searched his program very thoroughly for an indication\r\nof what he expects to do in order to see to it that a larger proportion\r\nof this \"prize\" money gets into the pay envelope, and have found none. Mr.\r\nRoosevelt, in one of his speeches, proposed that manufacturers who did not\r\nshare their profits liberally enough with their workmen should be\r\npenalized by a sharp cut in the \"protection\" afforded them; but the\r\nplatform, so far as I could see, proposed nothing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, under the system proposed, most employers,--at any rate,\r\npractically all of the most powerful of them,--would be, to all intents\r\nand purposes, wards and protégés of the government which is the master of\r\nus all; for no part of this program can be discussed intelligently without\r\nremembering that monopoly, as handled by it, is not to be prevented, but\r\naccepted. It is to be accepted and regulated. All attempt to resist it is\r\nto be given up. It is to be accepted as inevitable. The government is to\r\nset up a commission whose duty it will be, not to check or defeat it, but\r\nmerely to regulate it under rules which it is itself to frame and develop.\r\nSo that the chief employers will have this tremendous authority behind\r\nthem: what they do, they will have the license of the federal government\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nAnd it is worth the while of the workingmen of the country to recall what\r\nthe attitude toward organized labor has been of these masters of\r\nconsolidated industries whom it is proposed that the federal government\r\nshould take under its patronage as well as under its control. They have\r\nbeen the stoutest and most successful opponents of organized labor, and\r\nthey have tried to undermine it in a great many ways. Some of the ways\r\nthey have adopted have worn the guise of philanthropy and good-will, and\r\nhave no doubt been used, for all I know, in perfect good faith. Here and\r\nthere they have set up systems of profit sharing, of compensation for\r\ninjuries, and of bonuses, and even pensions; but every one of these plans\r\nhas merely bound their workingmen more tightly to themselves. Rights under\r\nthese various arrangements are not legal rights. They are merely\r\nprivileges which employees enjoy only so long as they remain in the\r\nemployment and observe the rules of the great industries for which they\r\nwork. If they refuse to be weaned away from their independence they\r\ncannot continue to enjoy the benefits extended to them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen you have thought the whole thing out, therefore, you will find that\r\nthe program of the new party legalizes monopolies and systematically\r\nsubordinates workingmen to them and to plans made by the government both\r\nwith regard to employment and with regard to wages. Take the thing as a\r\nwhole, and it looks strangely like economic mastery over the very lives\r\nand fortunes of those who do the daily work of the nation; and all this\r\nunder the overwhelming power and sovereignty of the national government.\r\nWhat most of us are fighting for is to break up this very partnership\r\nbetween big business and the government. We call upon all intelligent men\r\nto bear witness that if this plan were consummated, the great employers\r\nand capitalists of the country would be under a more overpowering\r\ntemptation than ever to take control of the government and keep it\r\nsubservient to their purpose.\r\n\r\nWhat a prize it would be to capture! How unassailable would be the\r\nmajesty and the tyranny of monopoly if it could thus get sanction of law\r\nand the authority of government! By what means, except open revolt, could\r\nwe ever break the crust of our life again and become free men, breathing\r\nan air of our own, living lives that we wrought out for ourselves?\r\n\r\nYou cannot use monopoly in order to serve a free people. You cannot use\r\ngreat combinations of capital to be pitiful and righteous when the\r\nconsciences of great bodies of men are enlisted, not in the promotion of\r\nspecial privilege, but in the realization of human rights. When I read\r\nthose beautiful portions of the program of the third party devoted to the\r\nuplift of mankind and see noble men and women attaching themselves to that\r\nparty in the hope that regulated monopoly may realize these dreams of\r\nhumanity, I wonder whether they have really studied the instruments\r\nthrough which they are going to do these things. The man who is leading\r\nthe third party has not changed his point of view since he was President\r\nof the United States. I am not asking him to change it. I am not saying\r\nthat he has not a perfect right to retain it. But I do say that it is not\r\nsurprising that a man who had the point of view with regard to the\r\ngovernment of this country which he had when he was President was not\r\nchosen as President again, and allowed to patent the present processes of\r\nindustry and personally direct them how to treat the people of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThere has been a history of the human race, you know, and a history of\r\ngovernment; it is recorded; and the kind of thing proposed has been tried\r\nagain and again and has always led to the same result. History is strewn\r\nall along its course with the wrecks of governments that tried to be\r\nhumane, tried to carry out humane programs through the instrumentality of\r\nthose who controlled the material fortunes of the rest of their\r\nfellow-citizens.\r\n\r\nI do not trust any promises of a change of temper on the part of monopoly.\r\nMonopoly never was conceived in the temper of tolerance. Monopoly never\r\nwas conceived with the purpose of general development. It was conceived\r\nwith the purpose of special advantage. Has monopoly been very benevolent\r\nto its employees? Have the trusts had a soft heart for the working people\r\nof America? Have you found trusts that cared whether women were sapped of\r\ntheir vitality or not? Have you found trusts who are very scrupulous about\r\nusing children in their tender years? Have you found trusts that were keen\r\nto protect the lungs and the health and the freedom of their employees?\r\nHave you found trusts that thought as much of their men as they did of\r\ntheir machinery? Then who is going to convert these men into the chief\r\ninstruments of justice and benevolence?\r\n\r\nIf you will point me to the least promise of disinterestedness on the part\r\nof the masters of our lives, then I will conceive you some ray of hope;\r\nbut only upon this hypothesis, only upon this conjecture: that the history\r\nof the world is going to be reversed, and that the men who have the power\r\nto oppress us will be kind to us, and will promote our interests, whether\r\nour interests jump with theirs or not.\r\n\r\nAfter you have made the partnership between monopoly and your government\r\npermanent, then I invite all the philanthropists in the United States to\r\ncome and sit on the stage and go through the motions of finding out how\r\nthey are going to get philanthropy out of their masters.\r\n\r\nI do not want to see the special interests of the United States take care\r\nof the workingmen, women, and children. I want to see justice,\r\nrighteousness, fairness and humanity displayed in all the laws of the\r\nUnited States, and I do not want any power to intervene between the people\r\nand their government. Justice is what we want, not patronage and\r\ncondescension and pitiful helpfulness. The trusts are our masters now, but\r\nI for one do not care to live in a country called free even under kind\r\nmasters. I prefer to live under no masters at all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI agree that as a nation we are now about to undertake what may be\r\nregarded as the most difficult part of our governmental enterprises. We\r\nhave gone along so far without very much assistance from our government.\r\nWe have felt, and felt more and more in recent months, that the American\r\npeople were at a certain disadvantage as compared with the people of other\r\ncountries, because of what the governments of other countries were doing\r\nfor them and our government omitting to do for us.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly clear to every man who has any vision of the immediate\r\nfuture, who can forecast any part of it from the indications of the\r\npresent, that we are just upon the threshold of a time when the systematic\r\nlife of this country will be sustained, or at least supplemented, at every\r\npoint by governmental activity. And we have now to determine what kind of\r\ngovernmental activity it shall be; whether, in the first place, it shall\r\nbe direct from the government itself, or whether it shall be indirect,\r\nthrough instrumentalities which have already constituted themselves and\r\nwhich stand ready to supersede the government.\r\n\r\nI believe that the time has come when the governments of this country,\r\nboth state and national, have to set the stage, and set it very minutely\r\nand carefully, for the doing of justice to men in every relationship of\r\nlife. It has been free and easy with us so far; it has been go as you\r\nplease; it has been every man look out for himself; and we have continued\r\nto assume, up to this year when every man is dealing, not with another\r\nman, in most cases, but with a body of men whom he has not seen, that the\r\nrelationships of property are the same that they always were. We have\r\ngreat tasks before us, and we must enter on them as befits men charged\r\nwith the responsibility of shaping a new era.\r\n\r\nWe have a great program of governmental assistance ahead of us in the\r\nco-operative life of the nation; but we dare not enter upon that program\r\nuntil we have freed the government. That is the point. Benevolence never\r\ndeveloped a man or a nation. We do not want a benevolent government. We\r\nwant a free and a just government. Every one of the great schemes of\r\nsocial uplift which are now so much debated by noble people amongst us is\r\nbased, when rightly conceived, upon justice, not upon benevolence. It is\r\nbased upon the right of men to breathe pure air, to live; upon the right\r\nof women to bear children, and not to be overburdened so that disease and\r\nbreakdown will come upon them; upon the right of children to thrive and\r\ngrow up and be strong; upon all these fundamental things which appeal,\r\nindeed, to our hearts, but which our minds perceive to be part of the\r\nfundamental justice of life.\r\n\r\nPolitics differs from philanthropy in this: that in philanthropy we\r\nsometimes do things through pity merely, while in politics we act always,\r\nif we are righteous men, on grounds of justice and large expediency for\r\nmen in the mass. Sometimes in our pitiful sympathy with our fellow-men we\r\nmust do things that are more than just. We must forgive men. We must help\r\nmen who have gone wrong. We must sometimes help men who have gone\r\ncriminally wrong. But the law does not forgive. It is its duty to equalize\r\nconditions, to make the path of right the path of safety and advantage, to\r\nsee that every man has a fair chance to live and to serve himself, to see\r\nthat injustice and wrong are not wrought upon any.\r\n\r\nWe ought not to permit passion to enter into our thoughts or our hearts\r\nin this great matter; we ought not to allow ourselves to be governed by\r\nresentment or any kind of evil feeling, but we ought, nevertheless, to\r\nrealize the seriousness of our situation. That seriousness consists,\r\nsingularly enough, not in the malevolence of the men who preside over our\r\nindustrial life, but in their genius and in their honest thinking. These\r\nmen believe that the prosperity of the United States is not safe unless it\r\nis in their keeping. If they were dishonest, we might put them out of\r\nbusiness by law; since most of them are honest, we can put them out of\r\nbusiness only by making it impossible for them to realize their genuine\r\nconvictions. I am not afraid of a knave. I am not afraid of a rascal. I am\r\nafraid of a strong man who is wrong, and whose wrong thinking can be\r\nimpressed upon other persons by his own force of character and force of\r\nspeech. If God had only arranged it that all the men who are wrong were\r\nrascals, we could put them out of business very easily, because they would\r\ngive themselves away sooner or later; but God has made our task heavier\r\nthan that,--he has made some good men who think wrong. We cannot fight\r\nthem because they are bad, but because they are wrong. We must overcome\r\nthem by a better force, the genial, the splendid, the permanent force of a\r\nbetter reason.\r\n\r\nThe reason that America was set up was that she might be different from\r\nall the nations of the world in this: that the strong could not put the\r\nweak to the wall, that the strong could not prevent the weak from entering\r\nthe race. America stands for opportunity. America stands for a free field\r\nand no favor. America stands for a government responsive to the interests\r\nof all. And until America recovers those ideals in practice, she will not\r\nhave the right to hold her head high again amidst the nations as she used\r\nto hold it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is like coming out of a stifling cellar into the open where we can\r\nbreathe again and see the free spaces of the heavens to turn away from\r\nsuch a doleful program of submission and dependence toward the other plan,\r\nthe confident purpose for which the people have given their mandate. Our\r\npurpose is the restoration of freedom. We purpose to prevent private\r\nmonopoly by law, to see to it that the methods by which monopolies have\r\nbeen built up are legally made impossible. We design that the limitations\r\non private enterprise shall be removed, so that the next generation of\r\nyoungsters, as they come along, will not have to become protégés of\r\nbenevolent trusts, but will be free to go about making their own lives\r\nwhat they will; so that we shall taste again the full cup, not of charity,\r\nbut of liberty,--the only wine that ever refreshed and renewed the spirit\r\nof a people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nTHE WAY TO RESUME IS TO RESUME\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the wonderful things about America, to my mind, is this: that for\r\nmore than a generation it has allowed itself to be governed by persons who\r\nwere not invited to govern it. A singular thing about the people of the\r\nUnited States is their almost infinite patience, their willingness to\r\nstand quietly by and see things done which they have voted against and do\r\nnot want done, and yet never lay the hand of disorder upon any arrangement\r\nof government.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly a part of the United States where men are not aware that\r\nsecret private purposes and interests have been running the government.\r\nThey have been running it through the agency of those interesting persons\r\nwhom we call political \"bosses.\" A boss is not so much a politician as the\r\nbusiness agent in politics of the special interests. The boss is not a\r\npartisan; he is quite above politics! He has an understanding with the\r\nboss of the other party, so that, whether it is heads or tails, we lose.\r\nThe two receive contributions from the same sources, and they spend those\r\ncontributions for the same purposes.\r\n\r\nBosses are men who have worked their way by secret methods to the place of\r\npower they occupy; men who were never elected to anything; men who were\r\nnot asked by the people to conduct their government, and who are very much\r\nmore powerful than if you had asked them, so long as you leave them where\r\nthey are, behind closed doors, in secret conference. They are not\r\npoliticians; they have no policies,--except concealed policies of private\r\naggrandizement. A boss isn't a leader of a party. Parties do not meet in\r\nback rooms; parties do not make arrangements which do not get into the\r\nnewspapers. Parties, if you reckon them by voting strength, are great\r\nmasses of men who, because they can't vote any other ticket, vote the\r\nticket that was prepared for them by the aforesaid arrangement in the\r\naforesaid back room in accordance with the aforesaid understanding. A boss\r\nis the manipulator of a \"machine.\" A \"machine\" is that part of a political\r\norganization which has been taken out of the hands of the rank and file of\r\nthe party, captured by half a dozen men. It is the part that has ceased to\r\nbe political and has become an agency for the purposes of unscrupulous\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nDo not lay up the sins of this kind of business to political\r\norganizations. Organization is legitimate, is necessary, is even\r\ndistinguished, when it lends itself to the carrying out of great causes.\r\nOnly the man who uses organization to promote private purposes is a boss.\r\nAlways distinguish between a political leader and a boss. I honor the man\r\nwho makes the organization of a great party strong and thorough, in order\r\nto use it for public service. But he is not a boss. A boss is a man who\r\nuses this splendid, open force for secret purposes.\r\n\r\nOne of the worst features of the boss system is this fact, that it works\r\nsecretly. I would a great deal rather live under a king whom I should at\r\nleast know, than under a boss whom I don't know. A boss is a much more\r\nformidable master than a king, because a king is an obvious master,\r\nwhereas the hands of the boss are always where you least expect them to\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nWhen I was in Oregon, not many months ago, I had some very interesting\r\nconversations with Mr. U'Ren, who is the father of what is called the\r\nOregon System, a system by which he has put bosses out of business. He is\r\na member of a group of public-spirited men who, whenever they cannot get\r\nwhat they want through the legislature, draw up a bill and submit it to\r\nthe people, by means of the initiative, and generally get what they want.\r\nThe day I arrived in Portland, a morning paper happened to say, very\r\nironically, that there were two legislatures in Oregon, one at Salem, the\r\nstate capital, and the other going around under the hat of Mr. U'Ren. I\r\ncould not resist the temptation of saying, when I spoke that evening,\r\nthat, while I was the last man to suggest that power should be\r\nconcentrated in any single individual or group of individuals, I would,\r\nnevertheless, after my experience in New Jersey, rather have a legislature\r\nthat went around under the hat of somebody in particular whom I knew I\r\ncould find than a legislature that went around under God knows who's hat;\r\nbecause then you could at least put your finger on your governing force;\r\nyou would know where to find it.\r\n\r\nWhy do we continue to permit these things? Isn't it about time that we\r\ngrew up and took charge of our own affairs? I am tired of being under age\r\nin politics. I don't want to be associated with anybody except those who\r\nare politically over twenty-one. I don't wish to sit down and let any man\r\ntake care of me without my having at least a voice in it; and if he\r\ndoesn't listen to my advice, I am going to make it as unpleasant for him\r\nas I can. Not because my advice is necessarily good, but because no\r\ngovernment is good in which every man doesn't insist upon his advice being\r\nheard, at least, whether it is heeded or not.\r\n\r\nSome persons have said that representative government has proved too\r\nindirect and clumsy an instrument, and has broken down as a means of\r\npopular control. Others, looking a little deeper, have said that it was\r\nnot representative government that had broken down, but the effort to get\r\nit. They have pointed out that, with our present methods of machine\r\nnomination and our present methods of election, which give us nothing more\r\nthan a choice between one set of machine nominees and another, we do not\r\nget representative government at all,--at least not government\r\nrepresentative of the people, but merely government representative of\r\npolitical managers who serve their own interests and the interests of\r\nthose with whom they find it profitable to establish partnerships.\r\n\r\nObviously, this is something that goes to the root of the whole matter.\r\nBack of all reform lies the method of getting it. Back of the question,\r\nWhat do you want, lies the question,--the fundamental question of all\r\ngovernment,--How are you going to get it? How are you going to get public\r\nservants who will obtain it for you? How are you going to get genuine\r\nrepresentatives who will serve your interests, and not their own or the\r\ninterests of some special group or body of your fellow-citizens whose\r\npower is of the few and not of the many? These are the queries which have\r\ndrawn the attention of the whole country to the subject of the direct\r\nprimary, the direct choice of their officials by the people, without the\r\nintervention of the nominating machine; to the subject of the direct\r\nelection of United States Senators; and to the question of the initiative,\r\nreferendum, and recall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe critical moment in the choosing of officials is that of their\r\nnomination more often than that of their election. When two party\r\norganizations, nominally opposing each other but actually working in\r\nperfect understanding and co-operation, see to it that both tickets have\r\nthe same kind of men on them, it is Tweedledum or Tweedledee, so far as\r\nthe people are concerned; the political managers have us coming and going.\r\nWe may delude ourselves with the pleasing belief that we are electing our\r\nown officials, but of course the fact is we are merely making an\r\nindifferent and ineffectual choice between two sets of men named by\r\ninterests which are not ours.\r\n\r\nSo that what we establish the direct primary for is this: to break up the\r\ninside and selfish determination of the question who shall be elected to\r\nconduct the government and make the laws of our commonwealths and our\r\nnation. Everywhere the impression is growing stronger that there can be no\r\nmeans of dominating those who have dominated us except by taking this\r\nprocess of the original selection of nominees into our own hands. Does\r\nthat upset any ancient foundations? Is it not the most natural and simple\r\nthing in the world? You say that it does not always work; that the people\r\nare too busy or too lazy to bother about voting at primary elections?\r\nTrue, sometimes the people of a state or a community do let a direct\r\nprimary go by without asserting their authority as against the bosses. The\r\nelectorate of the United States is occasionally like the god Baal: it is\r\nsometimes on a journey or it is sometimes asleep; but when it does awake,\r\nit does not resemble the god Baal in the slightest degree. It is a great\r\nself-possessed power which effectually takes control of its own affairs. I\r\nam willing to wait. I am among those who believe so firmly in the\r\nessential doctrines of democracy that I am willing to wait on the\r\nconvenience of this great sovereign, provided I know that he has got the\r\ninstrument to dominate whenever he chooses to grasp it.\r\n\r\nThen there is another thing that the conservative people are concerned\r\nabout: the direct election of United States Senators. I have seen some\r\nthoughtful men discuss that with a sort of shiver, as if to disturb the\r\noriginal constitution of the United States Senate was to do something\r\ntouched with impiety, touched with irreverence for the Constitution\r\nitself. But the first thing necessary to reverence for the United States\r\nSenate is respect for United States Senators. I am not one of those who\r\ncondemn the United States Senate as a body; for, no matter what has\r\nhappened there, no matter how questionable the practices or how corrupt\r\nthe influences which have filled some of the seats in that high body, it\r\nmust in fairness be said that the majority in it has all the years through\r\nbeen untouched by stain, and that there has always been there a sufficient\r\nnumber of men of integrity to vindicate the self-respect and the\r\nhopefulness of America with regard to her institutions.\r\n\r\nBut you need not be told, and it would be painful to repeat to you, how\r\nseats have been bought in the Senate; and you know that a little group of\r\nSenators holding the balance of power has again and again been able to\r\ndefeat programs of reform upon which the whole country had set its heart;\r\nand that whenever you analyzed the power that was behind those little\r\ngroups you have found that it was not the power of public opinion, but\r\nsome private influence, hardly to be discerned by superficial scrutiny,\r\nthat had put those men there to do that thing.\r\n\r\nNow, returning to the original principles upon which we profess to stand,\r\nhave the people of the United States not the right to see to it that every\r\nseat in the Senate represents the unbought United States of America? Does\r\nthe direct election of Senators touch anything except the private control\r\nof seats in the Senate? We remember another thing: that we have not been\r\nwithout our suspicions concerning some of the legislatures which elect\r\nSenators. Some of the suspicions which we entertained in New Jersey about\r\nthem turned out to be founded upon very solid facts indeed. Until two\r\nyears ago New Jersey had not in half a generation been represented in the\r\nUnited States Senate by the men who would have been chosen if the process\r\nof selecting them had been free and based upon the popular will.\r\n\r\nWe are not to deceive ourselves by putting our heads into the sand and\r\nsaying, \"Everything is all right.\" Mr. Gladstone declared that the\r\nAmerican Constitution was the most perfect instrument ever devised by the\r\nbrain of man. We have been praised all over the world for our singular\r\ngenius for setting up successful institutions, but a very thoughtful\r\nEnglishman, and a very witty one, said a very instructive thing about\r\nthat: he said that to show that the American Constitution had worked well\r\nwas no proof that it is an excellent constitution, because Americans could\r\nrun any constitution,--a compliment which we laid like sweet unction to\r\nour soul; and yet a criticism which ought to set us thinking.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that when American forces are awake they can conduct\r\nAmerican processes without serious departure from the ideals of the\r\nConstitution, it is nevertheless true that we have had many shameful\r\ninstances of practices which we can absolutely remove by the direct\r\nelection of Senators by the people themselves. And therefore I, for one,\r\nwill not allow any man who knows his history to say to me that I am acting\r\ninconsistently with either the spirit or the essential form of the\r\nAmerican government in advocating the direct election of United States\r\nSenators.\r\n\r\nTake another matter. Take the matter of the initiative and referendum,\r\nand the recall. There are communities, there are states in the Union, in\r\nwhich I am quite ready to admit that it is perhaps premature, that perhaps\r\nit will never be necessary, to discuss these measures. But I want to call\r\nyour attention to the fact that they have been adopted to the general\r\nsatisfaction in a number of states where the electorate had become\r\nconvinced that they did not have representative government.\r\n\r\nWhy do you suppose that in the United States, the place in all the world\r\nwhere the people were invited to control their own government, we should\r\nset up such an agitation as that for the initiative and referendum and the\r\nrecall. When did this thing begin? I have been receiving circulars and\r\ndocuments from little societies of men all over the United States with\r\nregard to these matters, for the last twenty-five years. But the circulars\r\nfor a long time kindled no fire. Men felt that they had representative\r\ngovernment and they were content. But about ten or fifteen years ago the\r\nfire began to burn,--and it has been sweeping over wider and wider areas\r\nof the country, because of the growing consciousness that something\r\nintervenes between the people and the government, and that there must be\r\nsome arm direct enough and strong enough to thrust aside the something\r\nthat comes in the way.\r\n\r\nI believe that we are upon the eve of recovering some of the most\r\nimportant prerogatives of a free people, and that the initiative and\r\nreferendum are playing a great part in that recovery. I met a man the\r\nother day who thought that the referendum was some kind of an animal,\r\nbecause it had a Latin name; and there are still people in this country\r\nwho have to have it explained to them. But most of us know and are deeply\r\ninterested. Why? Because we have felt that in too many instances our\r\ngovernment did not represent us, and we have said: \"We have got to have a\r\nkey to the door of our own house. The initiative and referendum and the\r\nrecall afford such a key to our own premises. If the people inside the\r\nhouse will run the place as we want it run, they may stay inside and we\r\nwill keep the latchkeys in our pockets. If they do not, we shall have to\r\nre-enter upon possession.\"\r\n\r\nLet no man be deceived by the cry that somebody is proposing to substitute\r\ndirect legislation by the people, or the direct reference of laws passed\r\nin the legislature, to the vote of the people, for representative\r\ngovernment. The advocates of these reforms have always declared, and\r\ndeclared in unmistakable terms, that they were intending to recover\r\nrepresentative government, not supersede it; that the initiative and\r\nreferendum would find no use in places where legislatures were really\r\nrepresentative of the people whom they were elected to serve. The\r\ninitiative is a means of seeing to it that measures which the people want\r\nshall be passed,--when legislatures defy or ignore public opinion. The\r\nreferendum is a means of seeing to it that the unrepresentative measures\r\nwhich they do not want shall not be placed upon the statute book.\r\n\r\nWhen you come to the recall, the principle is that if an administrative\r\nofficer,--for we will begin with the administrative officer,--is corrupt\r\nor so unwise as to be doing things that are likely to lead to all sorts of\r\nmischief, it will be possible by a deliberate process prescribed by the\r\nlaw to get rid of that officer before the end of his term. You must admit\r\nthat it is a little inconvenient sometimes to have what has been called an\r\nastronomical system of government, in which you can't change anything\r\nuntil there has been a certain number of revolutions of the seasons. In\r\nmany of our oldest states the ordinary administrative term is a single\r\nyear. The people of those states have not been willing to trust an\r\nofficial out of their sight more than twelve months. Elections there are a\r\nsort of continuous performance, based on the idea of the constant touch of\r\nthe hand of the people on their own affairs. That is exactly the principle\r\nof the recall. I don't see how any man grounded in the traditions of\r\nAmerican affairs can find any valid objection to the recall of\r\nadministrative officers. The meaning of the recall is merely this,--not\r\nthat we should have unstable government, not that officials should not\r\nknow how long their power might last,--but that we might have government\r\nexercised by officials who know whence their power came and that if they\r\nyield to private influences they will presently be displaced by public\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nYou will of course understand that, both in the case of the initiative and\r\nreferendum and in that of the recall, the very existence of these powers,\r\nthe very possibilities which they imply, are half,--indeed, much more than\r\nhalf,--the battle. They rarely need to be actually exercised. The fact\r\nthat the people may initiate keeps the members of the legislature awake to\r\nthe necessity of initiating themselves; the fact that the people have the\r\nright to demand the submission of a legislative measure to popular vote\r\nrenders the members of the legislature wary of bills that would not pass\r\nthe people; the very possibility of being recalled puts the official on\r\nhis best behavior.\r\n\r\nIt is another matter when we come to the judiciary. I myself have never\r\nbeen in favor of the recall of judges. Not because some judges have not\r\ndeserved to be recalled. That isn't the point. The point is that the\r\nrecall of judges is treating the symptom instead of the disease. The\r\ndisease lies deeper, and sometimes it is very virulent and very dangerous.\r\nThere have been courts in the United States which were controlled by\r\nprivate interests. There have been supreme courts in our states before\r\nwhich plain men could not get justice. There have been corrupt judges;\r\nthere have been controlled judges; there have been judges who acted as\r\nother men's servants and not as the servants of the public. Ah, there are\r\nsome shameful chapters in the story! The judicial process is the ultimate\r\nsafeguard of the things that we must hold stable in this country. But\r\nsuppose that that safeguard is corrupted; suppose that it does not guard\r\nmy interests and yours, but guards merely the interests of a very small\r\ngroup of individuals; and, whenever your interest clashes with theirs,\r\nyours will have to give way, though you represent ninety per cent. of the\r\ncitizens, and they only ten per cent. Then where is your safeguard?\r\n\r\nThe just thought of the people must control the judiciary, as it controls\r\nevery other instrument of government. But there are ways and ways of\r\ncontrolling it. If,--mark you, I say _if_,--at one time the Southern\r\nPacific Railroad owned the supreme court of the State of California, would\r\nyou remedy that situation by recalling the judges of the court? What good\r\nwould that do, so long as the Southern Pacific Railroad could substitute\r\nothers for them? You would not be cutting deep enough. Where you want to\r\ngo is to the process by which those judges were selected. And when you get\r\nthere, you will reach the moral of the whole of this discussion, because\r\nthe moral of it all is that the people of the United States have\r\nsuspected, until their suspicions have been justified by all sorts of\r\nsubstantial and unanswerable evidence, that, in place after place, at\r\nturning-points in the history of this country, we have been controlled by\r\nprivate understandings and not by the public interest; and that influences\r\nwhich were improper, if not corrupt, have determined everything from the\r\nmaking of laws to the administration of justice. The disease lies in the\r\nregion where these men get their nominations; and if you can recover for\r\nthe people the _selecting_ of judges, you will not have to trouble about\r\ntheir recall. Selection is of more radical consequence than election.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am aware that those who advocate these measures which we have been\r\ndiscussing are denounced as dangerous radicals. I am particularly\r\ninterested to observe that the men who cry out most loudly against what\r\nthey call radicalism are the men who find that their private game in\r\npolitics is being spoiled. Who are the arch-conservatives nowadays? Who\r\nare the men who utter the most fervid praise of the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States and the constitutions of the states? They are the gentlemen\r\nwho used to get behind those documents to play hide-and-seek with the\r\npeople whom they pretended to serve. They are the men who entrenched\r\nthemselves in the laws which they misinterpreted and misused. If now they\r\nare afraid that \"radicalism\" will sweep them away,--and I believe it\r\nwill,--they have only themselves to thank.\r\n\r\nYet how absurd is the charge that we who are demanding that our government\r\nbe made representative of the people and responsive to their demands,--how\r\nfictitious and hypocritical is the charge that we are attacking the\r\nfundamental principles of republican institutions! These very men who\r\nhysterically profess their alarm would declaim loudly enough on the Fourth\r\nof July of the Declaration of Independence; they would go on and talk of\r\nthose splendid utterances in our earliest state constitutions, which have\r\nbeen copied in all our later ones, taken from the Petition of Rights, or\r\nthe Declaration of Rights, those great fundamental documents of the\r\nstruggle for liberty in England; and yet in these very documents we read\r\nsuch uncompromising statements as this: that, when at any time the people\r\nof a commonwealth find that their government is not suitable to the\r\ncircumstances of their lives or the promotion of their liberties, it is\r\ntheir privilege to alter it at their pleasure, and alter it in any\r\ndegree. That is the foundation, that is the very central doctrine, that is\r\nthe ground principle, of American institutions.\r\n\r\nI want you to read a passage from the Virginia Bill of Rights, that\r\nimmortal document which has been a model for declarations of liberty\r\nthroughout the rest of the continent:\r\n\r\n    That all power is vested in, and consequently derived from, the\r\n    people; that magistrates are their trustees and servants, and at all\r\n    times amenable to them.\r\n\r\n    That government is, or ought to be, instituted for the common benefit,\r\n    protection, and security of the people, nation, or community; of all\r\n    the various modes and forms of government, that is the best which is\r\n    capable of producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety, and\r\n    is most effectually secured against the danger of mal-administration;\r\n    and that, when any government shall be found inadequate or contrary to\r\n    these purposes, a majority of the community bath an indubitable,\r\n    inalienable, and indefeasible right to reform, alter, or abolish it,\r\n    in such manner as shall be judged most conducive to the public weal.\r\n\r\nI have heard that read a score of times on the Fourth of July, but I never\r\nheard it read where actual measures were being debated. No man who\r\nunderstands the principles upon which this Republic was founded has the\r\nslightest dread of the gentle,--though very effective,--measures by which\r\nthe people are again resuming control of their own affairs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNor need any lover of liberty be anxious concerning the outcome of the\r\nstruggle upon which we are now embarked. The victory is certain, and the\r\nbattle is not going to be an especially sanguinary one. It is hardly going\r\nto be worth the name of a battle. Let me tell the story of the\r\nemancipation of one State,--New Jersey:\r\n\r\nIt has surprised the people of the United States to find New Jersey at the\r\nfront in enterprises of reform. I, who have lived in New Jersey the\r\ngreater part of my mature life, know that there is no state in the Union\r\nwhich, so far as the hearts and intelligence of its people are concerned,\r\nhas more earnestly desired reform than has New Jersey. There are men who\r\nhave been prominent in the affairs of the State who again and again\r\nadvocated with all the earnestness that was in them the things that we\r\nhave at last been able to do. There are men in New Jersey who have spent\r\nsome of the best energies of their lives in trying to win elections in\r\norder to get the support of the citizens of New Jersey for programs of\r\nreform.\r\n\r\nThe people had voted for such things very often before the autumn of 1910,\r\nbut the interesting thing is that nothing had happened. They were\r\ndemanding the benefit of remedial measures such as had been passed in\r\nevery progressive state of the Union, measures which had proved not only\r\nthat they did not upset the life of the communities to which they were\r\napplied but that they quickened every force and bettered every condition\r\nin those communities. But the people of New Jersey could not get them, and\r\nthere had come upon them a certain pessimistic despair. I used to meet men\r\nwho shrugged their shoulders and said: \"What difference does it make how\r\nwe vote? Nothing ever results from our votes.\" The force that is behind\r\nthe new party that has recently been formed, the so-called \"Progressive\r\nParty,\" is a force of discontent with the old parties of the United\r\nStates. It is the feeling that men have gone into blind alleys often\r\nenough, and that somehow there must be found an open road through which\r\nmen may pass to some purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1910 there came a day when the people of New Jersey took heart\r\nto believe that something could be accomplished. I had no merit as a\r\ncandidate for Governor, except that I said what I really thought, and the\r\ncompliment that the people paid me was in believing that I meant what I\r\nsaid. Unless they had believed in the Governor whom they then elected,\r\nunless they had trusted him deeply and altogether, he could have done\r\nabsolutely nothing. The force of the public men of a nation lies in the\r\nfaith and the backing of the people of the country, rather than in any\r\ngifts of their own. In proportion as you trust them, in proportion as you\r\nback them up, in proportion as you lend them your strength, are they\r\nstrong. The things that have happened in New Jersey since 1910 have\r\nhappened because the seed was planted in this fine fertile soil of\r\nconfidence, of trust, of renewed hope.\r\n\r\nThe moment the forces in New Jersey that had resisted reform realized that\r\nthe people were backing new men who meant what they had said, they\r\nrealized that they dare not resist them. It was not the personal force of\r\nthe new officials; it was the moral strength of their backing that\r\naccomplished the extraordinary result.\r\n\r\nAnd what was accomplished? Mere justice to classes that had not been\r\ntreated justly before.\r\n\r\nEvery schoolboy in the State of New Jersey, if he cared to look into the\r\nmatter, could comprehend the fact that the laws applying to laboring-men\r\nwith respect of compensation when they were hurt in their various\r\nemployments had originated at a time when society was organized very\r\ndifferently from the way in which it is organized now, and that because\r\nthe law had not been changed, the courts were obliged to go blindly on\r\nadministering laws which were cruelly unsuitable to existing conditions,\r\nso that it was practically impossible for the workingmen of New Jersey to\r\nget justice from the courts; the legislature of the commonwealth had not\r\ncome to their assistance with the necessary legislation. Nobody seriously\r\ndebated the circumstances; everybody knew that the law was antiquated and\r\nimpossible; everybody knew that justice waited to be done. Very well,\r\nthen, why wasn't it done?\r\n\r\nThere was another thing that we wanted to do: We wanted to regulate our\r\npublic service corporations so that we could get the proper service from\r\nthem, and on reasonable terms. That had been done elsewhere, and where it\r\nhad been done it had proved just as much for the benefit of the\r\ncorporations themselves as for the benefit of the people. Of course it was\r\nsomewhat difficult to convince the corporations. It happened that one of\r\nthe men who knew the least about the subject was the president of the\r\nPublic Service Corporation of New Jersey. I have heard speeches from that\r\ngentleman that exhibited a total lack of acquaintance with the\r\ncircumstances of our times. I have never known ignorance so complete in\r\nits detail; and, being a man of force and ignorance, he naturally set all\r\nhis energy to resist the things that he did not comprehend.\r\n\r\nI am not interested in questioning the motives of men in such positions. I\r\nam only sorry that they don't know more. If they would only join the\r\nprocession they would find themselves benefited by the healthful exercise,\r\nwhich, for one thing, would renew within them the capacity to learn which\r\nI hope they possessed when they were younger. We were not trying to do\r\nanything novel in New Jersey in regulating the Public Service Corporation;\r\nwe were simply trying to adopt there a tested measure of public justice.\r\nWe adopted it. Has anybody gone bankrupt since? Does anybody now doubt\r\nthat it was just as much for the benefit of the Public Service Corporation\r\nas for the people of the State?\r\n\r\nThen there was another thing that we modestly desired: We wanted fair\r\nelections; we did not want candidates to buy themselves into office. That\r\nseemed reasonable. So we adopted a law, unique in one particular, namely:\r\nthat if you bought an office, you didn't get it. I admit that that is\r\ncontrary to all commercial principles, but I think it is pretty good\r\npolitical doctrine. It is all very well to put a man in jail for buying an\r\noffice, but it is very much better, besides putting him in jail, to show\r\nhim that if he has paid out a single dollar for that office, he does not\r\nget it, though a huge majority voted for him. We reversed the laws of\r\ntrade; when you buy something in politics in New Jersey, you do not get\r\nit. It seemed to us that that was the best way to discourage improper\r\npolitical argument. If your money does not produce the goods, then you are\r\nnot tempted to spend your money.\r\n\r\nWe adopted a Corrupt Practices Act, the reasonable foundation of which no\r\nman could question, and an Election Act, which every man predicted was not\r\ngoing to work, but which did work,--to the emancipation of the voters of\r\nNew Jersey.\r\n\r\nAll these things are now commonplaces with us. We like the laws that we\r\nhave passed, and no man ventures to suggest any material change in them.\r\nWhy didn't we get them long ago? What hindered us? Why, because we had a\r\nclosed government; not an open government. It did not belong to us. It was\r\nmanaged by little groups of men whose names we knew, but whom somehow we\r\ndidn't seem able to dislodge. When we elected men pledged to dislodge\r\nthem, they only went into partnership with them. Apparently what was\r\nnecessary was to call in an amateur who knew so little about the game that\r\nhe supposed that he was expected to do what he had promised to do.\r\n\r\nThere are gentlemen who have criticised the Governor of New Jersey because\r\nhe did not do certain things,--for instance, bring a lot of indictments.\r\nThe Governor of New Jersey does not think it necessary to defend himself;\r\nbut he would like to call attention to a very interesting thing that\r\nhappened in his State: When the people had taken over control of the\r\ngovernment, a curious change was wrought in the souls of a great many men;\r\na sudden moral awakening took place, and we simply could not find\r\nculprits against whom to bring indictments; it was like a Sunday school,\r\nthe way they obeyed the laws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo I say, there is nothing very difficult about resuming our own\r\ngovernment. There is nothing to appall us when we make up our minds to set\r\nabout the task. \"The way to resume is to resume,\" said Horace Greeley,\r\nonce, when the country was frightened at a prospect which turned out to be\r\nnot in the least frightful; it was at the moment of the resumption of\r\nspecie payments for Treasury notes. The Treasury simply resumed,--there\r\nwas not a ripple of danger or excitement when the day of resumption came\r\naround.\r\n\r\nIt will be precisely so when the people resume control of their own\r\ngovernment. The men who conduct the political machines are a small\r\nfraction of the party they pretend to represent, and the men who exercise\r\ncorrupt influences upon them are only a small fraction of the business men\r\nof the country. What we are banded together to fight is not a party, is\r\nnot a great body of citizens; we have to fight only little coteries,\r\ngroups of men here and there, a few men, who subsist by deceiving us and\r\ncannot subsist a moment after they cease to deceive us.\r\n\r\nI had occasion to test the power of such a group in the State of New\r\nJersey, and I had the satisfaction of discovering that I had been right in\r\nsupposing that they did not possess any power at all. It looked as if they\r\nwere entrenched in a fortress; it looked as if the embrasures of the\r\nfortress showed the muzzles of guns; but, as I told my good\r\nfellow-citizens, all they had to do was to press a little upon it and they\r\nwould find that the fortress was a mere cardboard fabric; that it was a\r\npiece of stage property; that just so soon as the audience got ready to\r\nlook behind the scenes they would learn that the army which had been\r\nmarching and counter-marching in such terrifying array consisted of a\r\nsingle company that had gone in one wing and around and out at the other\r\nwing, and could have thus marched in procession for twenty-four hours. You\r\nonly need about twenty-four men to do the trick. These men are impostors.\r\nThey are powerful only in proportion as we are susceptible to absurd fear\r\nof them. Their capital is our ignorance and our credulity.\r\n\r\nTo-day we are seeing something that some of us have waited all of our\r\nlives to see. We are witnessing a rising of the country. We are seeing a\r\nwhole people stand up and decline any longer to be imposed upon. The day\r\nhas come when men are saying to each other: \"It doesn't make a\r\npeppercorn's difference to me what party I have voted with. I am going to\r\npick out the men I want and the policies I want, and let the label take\r\ncare of itself. I do not find any great difference between my table of\r\ncontents and the table of contents of those who have voted with the other\r\nparty, and who, like me, are very much dissatisfied with the way in which\r\ntheir party has rewarded their faithfulness. They want the same things\r\nthat I want, and I don't know of anything under God's heaven to prevent\r\nour getting together. We want the same things, we have the same faith in\r\nthe old traditions of the American people, and we have made up our minds\r\nthat we are going to have now at last the reality instead of the shadow.\"\r\n\r\nWe Americans have been too long satisfied with merely going through the\r\nmotions of government. We have been having a mock game. We have been going\r\nto the polls and saying: \"This is the act of a sovereign people, but we\r\nwon't be the sovereign yet; we will postpone that; we will wait until\r\nanother time. The managers are still shifting the scenes; we are not ready\r\nfor the real thing yet.\"\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that we stop going through the mimic play; that we get out\r\nand translate the ideals of American politics into action; so that every\r\nman, when he goes to the polls on election day, will feel the thrill of\r\nexecuting an actual judgment, as he takes again into his own hands the\r\ngreat matters which have been too long left to men deputized by their own\r\nchoice, and seriously sets about carrying into accomplishment his own\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE EMANCIPATION OF BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the readjustments that are about to be undertaken in this country not\r\none single legitimate or honest arrangement is going to be disturbed; but\r\nevery impediment to business is going to be removed, every illegitimate\r\nkind of control is going to be destroyed. Every man who wants an\r\nopportunity and has the energy to seize it, is going to be given a chance.\r\nAll that we are going to ask the gentlemen who now enjoy monopolistic\r\nadvantages to do is to match their brains against the brains of those who\r\nwill then compete with them. The brains, the energy, of the rest of us are\r\nto be set free to go into the game,--that is all. There is to be a general\r\nrelease of the capital, the enterprise, of millions of people, a general\r\nopening of the doors of opportunity. With what a spring of determination,\r\nwith what a shout of jubilance, will the people rise to their\r\nemancipation!\r\n\r\nI am one of those who believe that we have had such restrictions upon the\r\nprosperity of this country that we have not yet come into our own, and\r\nthat by removing those restrictions we shall set free an energy which in\r\nour generation has not been known. It is for that reason that I feel free\r\nto criticise with the utmost frankness these restrictions, and the means\r\nby which they have been brought about. I do not criticise as one without\r\nhope; in describing conditions which so hamper, impede, and imprison, I am\r\nonly describing conditions from which we are going to escape into a\r\ncontrasting age. I believe that this is a time when there should be\r\nunqualified frankness. One of the distressing circumstances of our day is\r\nthis: I cannot tell you how many men of business, how many important men\r\nof business, have communicated their real opinions about the situation in\r\nthe United States to me privately and confidentially. They are afraid of\r\nsomebody. They are afraid to make their real opinions known publicly;\r\nthey tell them to me behind their hand. That is very distressing. That\r\nmeans that we are not masters of our own opinions, except when we vote,\r\nand even then we are careful to vote very privately indeed.\r\n\r\nIt is alarming that this should be the case. Why should any man in free\r\nAmerica be afraid of any other man? Or why should any man fear\r\ncompetition,--competition either with his fellow-countrymen or with\r\nanybody else on earth?\r\n\r\nIt is part of the indictment against the protective policy of the United\r\nStates that it has weakened and not enhanced the vigor of our people.\r\nAmerican manufacturers who know that they can make better things than are\r\nmade elsewhere in the world, that they can sell them cheaper in foreign\r\nmarkets than they are sold in these very markets of domestic manufacture,\r\nare afraid,--afraid to venture out into the great world on their own\r\nmerits and their own skill. Think of it, a nation full of genius and yet\r\nparalyzed by timidity! The timidity of the business men of America is to\r\nme nothing less than amazing. They are tied to the apron strings of the\r\ngovernment at Washington. They go about to seek favors. They say: \"For\r\npity's sake, don't expose us to the weather of the world; put some\r\nhomelike cover over us. Protect us. See to it that foreign men don't come\r\nin and match their brains with ours.\" And, as if to enhance this\r\npeculiarity of ours, the strongest men amongst us get the biggest favors;\r\nthe men of peculiar genius for organizing industries, the men who could\r\nrun the industries of any country, are the men who are most strongly\r\nintrenched behind the highest rates in the schedules of the tariff. They\r\nare so timid morally, furthermore, that they dare not stand up before the\r\nAmerican people, but conceal these favors in the verbiage of the tariff\r\nschedule itself,--in \"jokers.\" Ah! but it is a bitter joke when men who\r\nseek favors are so afraid of the best judgment of their fellow-citizens\r\nthat they dare not avow what they take.\r\n\r\nHappily, the general revival of conscience in this country has not been\r\nconfined to those who were consciously fighting special privilege. The\r\nawakening of conscience has extended to those who were _enjoying_ special\r\nprivileges, and I thank God that the business men of this country are\r\nbeginning to see our economic organization in its true light, as a\r\ndeadening aristocracy of privilege from which they themselves must escape.\r\nThe small men of this country are not deluded, and not all of the big\r\nbusiness men of this country are deluded. Some men who have been led into\r\nwrong practices, who have been led into the practices of monopoly, because\r\nthat seemed to be the drift and inevitable method of supremacy, are just\r\nas ready as we are to turn about and adopt the process of freedom. For\r\nAmerican hearts beat in a lot of these men, just as they beat under our\r\njackets. They will be as glad to be free as we shall be to set them free.\r\nAnd then the splendid force which has lent itself to things that hurt us\r\nwill lend itself to things that benefit us.\r\n\r\nAnd we,--we who are not great captains of industry or business,--shall do\r\nthem more good than we do now, even in a material way. If you have to be\r\nsubservient, you are not even making the rich fellows as rich as they\r\nmight be, because you are not adding your originative force to the\r\nextraordinary production of wealth in America. America is as rich, not as\r\nWall Street, not as the financial centres in Chicago and St. Louis and San\r\nFrancisco; it is as rich as the people that make those centres rich. And\r\nif those people hesitate in their enterprise, cower in the face of power,\r\nhesitate to originate designs of their own, then the very fountains which\r\nmake these places abound in wealth are dried up at the source. By setting\r\nthe little men of America free, you are not damaging the giants.\r\n\r\nIt may be that certain things will happen, for monopoly in this country is\r\ncarrying a body of water such as men ought not to be asked to carry. When\r\nby regulated competition,--that is to say, fair competition, competition\r\nthat fights fair,--they are put upon their mettle, they will have to\r\neconomize, and they cannot economize unless they get rid of that water. I\r\ndo not know how to squeeze the water out, but they will get rid of it, if\r\nyou will put them to the necessity. They will have to get rid of it, or\r\nthose of us who don't carry tanks will outrun them in the race. Put all\r\nthe business of America upon the footing of economy and efficiency, and\r\nthen let the race be to the strongest and the swiftest.\r\n\r\nOur program is a program of prosperity; a program of prosperity that is to\r\nbe a little more pervasive than the present prosperity,--and pervasive\r\nprosperity is more fruitful than that which is narrow and restrictive. I\r\ncongratulate the monopolies of the United States that they are not going\r\nto have their way, because, quite contrary to their own theory, the fact\r\nis that the people are wiser than they are. The people of the United\r\nStates understand the United States as these gentlemen do not, and if they\r\nwill only give us leave, we will not only make them rich, but we will make\r\nthem happy. Because, then, their conscience will have less to carry. I\r\nhave lived in a state that was owned by a series of corporations. They\r\nhanded it about. It was at one time owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad;\r\nthen it was owned by the Public Service Corporation. It was owned by the\r\nPublic Service Corporation when I was admitted, and that corporation has\r\nbeen resentful ever since that I interfered with its tenancy. But I really\r\ndid not see any reason why the people should give up their own residence\r\nto so small a body of men to monopolize; and, therefore, when I asked them\r\nfor their title deeds and they couldn't produce them, and there was no\r\ncourt except the court of public opinion to resort to, they moved out. Now\r\nthey eat out of our hands; and they are not losing flesh either. They are\r\nmaking just as much money as they made before, only they are making it in\r\na more respectable way. They are making it without the constant assistance\r\nof the legislature of the State of New Jersey. They are making it in the\r\nnormal way, by supplying the people of New Jersey with the service in the\r\nway of transportation and gas and water that they really need. I do not\r\nbelieve that there are any thoughtful officials of the Public Service\r\nCorporation of New Jersey that now seriously regret the change that has\r\ncome about. We liberated government in my state, and it is an interesting\r\nfact that we have not suffered one moment in prosperity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat we propose, therefore, in this program of freedom, is a program of\r\ngeneral advantage. Almost every monopoly that has resisted dissolution has\r\nresisted the real interests of its own stockholders. Monopoly always\r\nchecks development, weighs down natural prosperity, pulls against natural\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nTake but such an everyday thing as a useful invention and the putting of\r\nit at the service of men. You know how prolific the American mind has been\r\nin invention; how much civilization has been advanced by the steamboat,\r\nthe cotton-gin, the sewing-machine, the reaping-machine, the typewriter,\r\nthe electric light, the telephone, the phonograph. Do you know, have you\r\nhad occasion to learn, that there is no hospitality for invention\r\nnowadays? There is no encouragement for you to set your wits at work to\r\nimprove the telephone, or the camera, or some piece of machinery, or some\r\nmechanical process; you are not invited to find a shorter and cheaper way\r\nto make things or to perfect them, or to invent better things to take\r\ntheir place. There is too much money invested in old machinery; too much\r\nmoney has been spent advertising the old camera; the telephone plants, as\r\nthey are, cost too much to permit their being superseded by something\r\nbetter. Wherever there is monopoly, not only is there no incentive to\r\nimprove, but, improvement being costly in that it \"scraps\" old machinery\r\nand destroys the value of old products, there is a positive motive against\r\nimprovement. The instinct of monopoly is against novelty, the tendency of\r\nmonopoly is to keep in use the old thing, made in the old way; its\r\ndisposition is to \"standardize\" everything. Standardization may be all\r\nvery well,--but suppose everything had been standardized thirty years\r\nago,--we should still be writing by hand, by gas-light, we should be\r\nwithout the inestimable aid of the telephone (sometimes, I admit, it is a\r\nnuisance), without the automobile, without wireless telegraphy.\r\nPersonally, I could have managed to plod along without the aeroplane, and\r\nI could have been happy even without moving-pictures.\r\n\r\nOf course, I am not saying that all invention has been stopped by the\r\ngrowth of trusts, but I think it is perfectly clear that invention in many\r\nfields has been discouraged, that inventors have been prevented from\r\nreaping the full fruits of their ingenuity and industry, and that mankind\r\nhas been deprived of many comforts and conveniences, as well as of the\r\nopportunity of buying at lower prices.\r\n\r\nThe damper put on the inventive genius of America by the trusts operates\r\nin half a dozen ways: The first thing discovered by the genius whose\r\ndevice extends into a field controlled by a trust is that he can't get\r\ncapital to make and market his invention. If you want money to build your\r\nplant and advertise your product and employ your agents and make a market\r\nfor it, where are you going to get it? The minute you apply for money or\r\ncredit, this proposition is put to you by the banks: \"This invention will\r\ninterfere with the established processes and the market control of certain\r\ngreat industries. We are already financing those industries, their\r\nsecurities are in our hands; we will consult them.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be, as a result of that consultation, you will be informed that it\r\nis too bad, but it will be impossible to \"accommodate\" you. It may be you\r\nwill receive a suggestion that if you care to make certain arrangements\r\nwith the trust, you will be permitted to manufacture. It may be you will\r\nreceive an offer to buy your patent, the offer being a poor consolation\r\ndole. It may be that your invention, even if purchased, will never be\r\nheard of again.\r\n\r\nThat last method of dealing with an invention, by the way, is a\r\nparticularly vicious misuse of the patent laws, which ought not to allow\r\nproperty in an idea which is never intended to be realized. One of the\r\nreforms waiting to be undertaken is a revision of our patent laws.\r\n\r\nIn any event, if the trust doesn't want you to manufacture your\r\ninvention, you will not be allowed to, unless you have money of your own\r\nand are willing to risk it fighting the monopolistic trust with its vast\r\nresources. I am generalizing the statement, but I could particularize it.\r\nI could tell you instances where exactly that thing happened. By the\r\ncombination of great industries, manufactured products are not only being\r\nstandardized, but they are too often being kept at a single point of\r\ndevelopment and efficiency. The increase of the power to produce in\r\nproportion to the cost of production is not studied in America as it used\r\nto be studied, because if you don't have to improve your processes in\r\norder to excel a competitor, if you are human you aren't going to improve\r\nyour processes; and if you can prevent the competitor from coming into the\r\nfield, then you can sit at your leisure, and, behind this wall of\r\nprotection which prevents the brains of any foreigner competing with you,\r\nyou can rest at your ease for a whole generation.\r\n\r\nCan any one who reflects on merely this attitude of the trusts toward\r\ninvention fail to understand how substantial, how actual, how great will\r\nbe the effect of the release of the genius of our people to originate,\r\nimprove, and perfect the instruments and circumstances of our lives? Who\r\ncan say what patents now lying, unrealized, in secret drawers and\r\npigeonholes, will come to light, or what new inventions will astonish and\r\nbless us, when freedom is restored?\r\n\r\nAre you not eager for the time when the genius and initiative of all the\r\npeople shall be called into the service of business? when newcomers with\r\nnew ideas, new entries with new enthusiasms, independent men, shall be\r\nwelcomed? when your sons shall be able to look forward to becoming, not\r\nemployees, but heads of some small, it may be, but hopeful, business,\r\nwhere their best energies shall be inspired by the knowledge that they are\r\ntheir own masters, with the paths of the world open before them? Have you\r\nno desire to see the markets opened to all? to see credit available in due\r\nproportion to every man of character and serious purpose who can use it\r\nsafely and to advantage? to see business disentangled from its unholy\r\nalliance with politics? to see raw material released from the control of\r\nmonopolists, and transportation facilities equalized for all? and every\r\navenue of commercial and industrial activity levelled for the feet of all\r\nwho would tread it? Surely, you must feel the inspiration of such a new\r\ndawn of liberty!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is the great policy of conservation, for example; and I do not\r\nconceive of conservation in any narrow sense. There are forests to\r\nconserve, there are great water powers to conserve, there are mines whose\r\nwealth should be deemed exhaustible, not inexhaustible, and whose\r\nresources should be safeguarded and preserved for future generations. But\r\nthere is much more. There are the lives and energies of the people to be\r\nphysically safeguarded.\r\n\r\nYou know what has been the embarrassment about conservation. The federal\r\ngovernment has not dared relax its hold, because, not _bona fide_\r\nsettlers, not men bent upon the legitimate development of great states,\r\nbut men bent upon getting into their own exclusive control great mineral,\r\nforest, and water resources, have stood at the ear of the government and\r\nattempted to dictate its policy. And the government of the United States\r\nhas not dared relax its somewhat rigid policy because of the fear that\r\nthese forces would be stronger than the forces of individual communities\r\nand of the public interest. What we are now in dread of is that this\r\nsituation will be made permanent. Why is it that Alaska has lagged in her\r\ndevelopment? Why is it that there are great mountains of coal piled up in\r\nthe shipping places on the coast of Alaska which the government at\r\nWashington will not permit to be sold? It is because the government is not\r\nsure that it has followed all the intricate threads of intrigue by which\r\nsmall bodies of men have tried to get exclusive control of the coal fields\r\nof Alaska. The government stands itself suspicious of the forces by which\r\nit is surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe trouble about conservation is that the government of the United States\r\nhasn't any policy at present. It is simply marking time. It is simply\r\nstanding still. Reservation is not conservation. Simply to say, \"We are\r\nnot going to do anything about the forests,\" when the country needs to use\r\nthe forests, is not a practicable program at all. To say that the people\r\nof the great State of Washington can't buy coal out of the Alaskan coal\r\nfields doesn't settle the question. You have got to have that coal sooner\r\nor later. And if you are so afraid of the Guggenheims and all the rest of\r\nthem that you can't make up your mind what your policies are going to be\r\nabout those coal fields, how long are we going to wait for the government\r\nto throw off its fear? There can't be a working program until there is a\r\nfree government. The day when the government is free to set about a policy\r\nof positive conservation, as distinguished from mere negative reservation,\r\nwill be an emancipation day of no small importance for the development of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nBut the question of conservation is a very much bigger question than the\r\nconservation of our natural resources; because in summing up our natural\r\nresources there is one great natural resource which underlies them all,\r\nand seems to underlie them so deeply that we sometimes overlook it. I mean\r\nthe people themselves.\r\n\r\nWhat would our forests be worth without vigorous and intelligent men to\r\nmake use of them? Why should we conserve our natural resources, unless we\r\ncan by the magic of industry transmute them into the wealth of the world?\r\nWhat transmutes them into that wealth, if not the skill and the touch of\r\nthe men who go daily to their toil and who constitute the great body of\r\nthe American people? What I am interested in is having the government of\r\nthe United States more concerned about human rights than about property\r\nrights. Property is an instrument of humanity; humanity isn't an\r\ninstrument of property. And yet when you see some men riding their great\r\nindustries as if they were driving a car of juggernaut, not looking to see\r\nwhat multitudes prostrate themselves before the car and lose their lives\r\nin the crushing effect of their industry, you wonder how long men are\r\ngoing to be permitted to think more of their machinery than they think of\r\ntheir men. Did you never think of it,--men are cheap, and machinery is\r\ndear; many a superintendent is dismissed for overdriving a delicate\r\nmachine, who wouldn't be dismissed for overdriving an overtaxed man. You\r\ncan discard your man and replace him; there are others ready to come into\r\nhis place; but you can't without great cost discard your machine and put a\r\nnew one in its place. You are less apt, therefore, to look upon your men\r\nas the essential vital foundation part of your whole business. It is time\r\nthat property, as compared with humanity, should take second place, not\r\nfirst place. We must see to it that there is no over-crowding, that there\r\nis no bad sanitation, that there is no unnecessary spread of avoidable\r\ndiseases, that the purity of food is safeguarded, that there is every\r\nprecaution against accident, that women are not driven to impossible\r\ntasks, nor children permitted to spend their energy before it is fit to be\r\nspent. The hope and elasticity of the race must be preserved; men must be\r\npreserved according to their individual needs, and not according to the\r\nprograms of industry merely. What is the use of having industry, if we\r\nperish in producing it? If we die in trying to feed ourselves, why should\r\nwe eat? If we die trying to get a foothold in the crowd, why not let the\r\ncrowd trample us sooner and be done with it? I tell you that there is\r\nbeginning to beat in this nation a great pulse of irresistible sympathy\r\nwhich is going to transform the processes of government amongst us. The\r\nstrength of America is proportioned only to the health, the energy, the\r\nhope, the elasticity, the buoyancy of the American people.\r\n\r\nIs not that the greatest thought that you can have of freedom,--the\r\nthought of it as a gift that shall release men and women from all that\r\npulls them back from being their best and from doing their best, that\r\nshall liberate their energy to its fullest limit, free their aspirations\r\ntill no bounds confine them, and fill their spirits with the jubilance of\r\nrealizable hope?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE LIBERATION OF A PEOPLE'S VITAL ENERGIES\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter how often we think of it, the discovery of America must each\r\ntime make a fresh appeal to our imaginations. For centuries, indeed from\r\nthe beginning, the face of Europe had been turned toward the east. All the\r\nroutes of trade, every impulse and energy, ran from west to east. The\r\nAtlantic lay at the world's back-door. Then, suddenly, the conquest of\r\nConstantinople by the Turk closed the route to the Orient. Europe had\r\neither to face about or lack any outlet for her energies; the unknown sea\r\nat the west at last was ventured upon, and the earth learned that it was\r\ntwice as big as it had thought. Columbus did not find, as he had expected,\r\nthe civilization of Cathay; he found an empty continent. In that part of\r\nthe world, upon that new-found half of the globe, mankind, late in its\r\nhistory, was thus afforded an opportunity to set up a new civilization;\r\nhere it was strangely privileged to make a new human experiment.\r\n\r\nNever can that moment of unique opportunity fail to excite the emotion of\r\nall who consider its strangeness and richness; a thousand fanciful\r\nhistories of the earth might be contrived without the imagination daring\r\nto conceive such a romance as the hiding away of half the globe until the\r\nfulness of time had come for a new start in civilization. A mere sea\r\ncaptain's ambition to trace a new trade route gave way to a moral\r\nadventure for humanity. The race was to found a new order here on this\r\ndelectable land, which no man approached without receiving, as the old\r\nvoyagers relate, you remember, sweet airs out of woods aflame with flowers\r\nand murmurous with the sound of pellucid waters. The hemisphere lay\r\nwaiting to be touched with life,--life from the old centres of living,\r\nsurely, but cleansed of defilement, and cured of weariness, so as to be\r\nfit for the virgin purity of a new bride. The whole thing springs into the\r\nimagination like a wonderful vision, an exquisite marvel which once only\r\nin all history could be vouchsafed.\r\n\r\nOne other thing only compares with it; only one other thing touches the\r\nsprings of emotion as does the picture of the ships of Columbus drawing\r\nnear the bright shores,--and that is the thought of the choke in the\r\nthroat of the immigrant of to-day as he gazes from the steerage deck at\r\nthe land where he has been taught to believe he in his turn shall find an\r\nearthly paradise, where, a free man, he shall forget the heartaches of the\r\nold life, and enter into the fulfilment of the hope of the world. For has\r\nnot every ship that has pointed her prow westward borne hither the hopes\r\nof generation after generation of the oppressed of other lands? How always\r\nhave men's hearts beat as they saw the coast of America rise to their\r\nview! How it has always seemed to them that the dweller there would at\r\nlast be rid of kings, of privileged classes, and of all those bonds which\r\nhad kept men depressed and helpless, and would there realize the full\r\nfruition of his sense of honest manhood, would there be one of a great\r\nbody of brothers, not seeking to defraud and deceive one another, but\r\nseeking to accomplish the general good!\r\n\r\nWhat was in the writings of the men who founded America,--to serve the\r\nselfish interests of America? Do you find that in their writings? No; to\r\nserve the cause of humanity, to bring liberty to mankind. They set up\r\ntheir standards here in America in the tenet of hope, as a beacon of\r\nencouragement to all the nations of the world; and men came thronging to\r\nthese shores with an expectancy that never existed before, with a\r\nconfidence they never dared feel before, and found here for generations\r\ntogether a haven of peace, of opportunity, of equality.\r\n\r\nGod send that in the complicated state of modern affairs we may recover\r\nthe standards and repeat the achievements of that heroic age!\r\n\r\nFor life is no longer the comparatively simple thing it was. Our relations\r\none with another have been profoundly modified by the new agencies of\r\nrapid communication and transportation, tending swiftly to concentrate\r\nlife, widen communities, fuse interests, and complicate all the processes\r\nof living. The individual is dizzily swept about in a thousand new\r\nwhirlpools of activities. Tyranny has become more subtle, and has learned\r\nto wear the guise of mere industry, and even of benevolence. Freedom has\r\nbecome a somewhat different matter. It cannot,--eternal principle that it\r\nis,--it cannot have altered, yet it shows itself in new aspects. Perhaps\r\nit is only revealing its deeper meaning.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is liberty?\r\n\r\nI have long had an image in my mind of what constitutes liberty. Suppose\r\nthat I were building a great piece of powerful machinery, and suppose that\r\nI should so awkwardly and unskilfully assemble the parts of it that every\r\ntime one part tried to move it would be interfered with by the others, and\r\nthe whole thing would buckle up and be checked. Liberty for the several\r\nparts would consist in the best possible assembling and adjustment of them\r\nall, would it not? If you want the great piston of the engine to run with\r\nabsolute freedom, give it absolutely perfect alignment and adjustment\r\nwith the other parts of the machine, so that it is free, not because it is\r\nlet alone or isolated, but because it has been associated most skilfully\r\nand carefully with the other parts of the great structure.\r\n\r\nWhat it liberty? You say of the locomotive that it runs free. What do you\r\nmean? You mean that its parts are so assembled and adjusted that friction\r\nis reduced to a minimum, and that it has perfect adjustment. We say of a\r\nboat skimming the water with light foot, \"How free she runs,\" when we\r\nmean, how perfectly she is adjusted to the force of the wind, how\r\nperfectly she obeys the great breath out of the heavens that fills her\r\nsails. Throw her head up into the wind and see how she will halt and\r\nstagger, how every sheet will shiver and her whole frame be shaken, how\r\ninstantly she is \"in irons,\" in the expressive phrase of the sea. She is\r\nfree only when you have let her fall off again and have recovered once\r\nmore her nice adjustment to the forces she must obey and cannot defy.\r\n\r\nHuman freedom consists in perfect adjustments of human interests and\r\nhuman activities and human energies.\r\n\r\nNow, the adjustments necessary between individuals, between individuals\r\nand the complex institutions amidst which they live, and between those\r\ninstitutions and the government, are infinitely more intricate to-day than\r\never before. No doubt this is a tiresome and roundabout way of saying the\r\nthing, yet perhaps it is worth while to get somewhat clearly in our mind\r\nwhat makes all the trouble to-day. Life has become complex; there are many\r\nmore elements, more parts, to it than ever before. And, therefore, it is\r\nharder to keep everything adjusted,--and harder to find out where the\r\ntrouble lies when the machine gets out of order.\r\n\r\nYou know that one of the interesting things that Mr. Jefferson said in\r\nthose early days of simplicity which marked the beginnings of our\r\ngovernment was that the best government consisted in as little governing\r\nas possible. And there is still a sense in which that is true. It is still\r\nintolerable for the government to interfere with our individual\r\nactivities except where it is necessary to interfere with them in order to\r\nfree them. But I feel confident that if Jefferson were living in our day\r\nhe would see what we see: that the individual is caught in a great\r\nconfused nexus of all sorts of complicated circumstances, and that to let\r\nhim alone is to leave him helpless as against the obstacles with which he\r\nhas to contend; and that, therefore, law in our day must come to the\r\nassistance of the individual. It must come to his assistance to see that\r\nhe gets fair play; that is all, but that is much. Without the watchful\r\ninterference, the resolute interference, of the government, there can be\r\nno fair play between individuals and such powerful institutions as the\r\ntrusts. Freedom to-day is something more than being let alone. The program\r\nof a government of freedom must in these days be positive, not negative\r\nmerely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWell, then, in this new sense and meaning of it, are we preserving freedom\r\nin this land of ours, the hope of all the earth?\r\n\r\nHave we, inheritors of this continent and of the ideals to which the\r\nfathers consecrated it,--have we maintained them, realizing them, as each\r\ngeneration must, anew? Are we, in the consciousness that the life of man\r\nis pledged to higher levels here than elsewhere, striving still to bear\r\naloft the standards of liberty and hope, or, disillusioned and defeated,\r\nare we feeling the disgrace of having had a free field in which to do new\r\nthings and of not having done them?\r\n\r\nThe answer must be, I am sure, that we have been in a fair way of\r\nfailure,--tragic failure. And we stand in danger of utter failure yet\r\nexcept we fulfil speedily the determination we have reached, to deal with\r\nthe new and subtle tyrannies according to their deserts. Don't deceive\r\nyourselves for a moment as to the power of the great interests which now\r\ndominate our development. They are so great that it is almost an open\r\nquestion whether the government of the United States can dominate them or\r\nnot. Go one step further, make their organized power permanent, and it may\r\nbe too late to turn back. The roads diverge at the point where we stand.\r\nThey stretch their vistas out to regions where they are very far separated\r\nfrom one another; at the end of one is the old tiresome scene of\r\ngovernment tied up with special interests; and at the other shines the\r\nliberating light of individual initiative, of individual liberty, of\r\nindividual freedom, the light of untrammeled enterprise. I believe that\r\nthat light shines out of the heavens itself that God has created. I\r\nbelieve in human liberty as I believe in the wine of life. There is no\r\nsalvation for men in the pitiful condescensions of industrial masters.\r\nGuardians have no place in a land of freemen. Prosperity guaranteed by\r\ntrustees has no prospect of endurance. Monopoly means the atrophy of\r\nenterprise. If monopoly persists, monopoly will always sit at the helm of\r\nthe government. I do not expect to see monopoly restrain itself. If there\r\nare men in this country big enough to own the government of the United\r\nStates, they are going to own it; what we have to determine now is whether\r\nwe are big enough, whether we are men enough, whether we are free enough,\r\nto take possession again of the government which is our own. We haven't\r\nhad free access to it, our minds have not touched it by way of guidance,\r\nin half a generation, and now we are engaged in nothing less than the\r\nrecovery of what was made with our own hands, and acts only by our\r\ndelegated authority.\r\n\r\nI tell you, when you discuss the question of the tariffs and of the\r\ntrusts, you are discussing the very lives of yourselves and your children.\r\nI believe that I am preaching the very cause of some of the gentlemen whom\r\nI am opposing when I preach the cause of free industry in the United\r\nStates, for I think they are slowly girding the tree that bears the\r\ninestimable fruits of our life, and that if they are permitted to gird it\r\nentirely nature will take her revenge and the tree will die.\r\n\r\nI do not believe that America is securely great because she has great men\r\nin her now. America is great in proportion as she can make sure of having\r\ngreat men in the next generation. She is rich in her unborn children;\r\nrich, that is to say, if those unborn children see the sun in a day of\r\nopportunity, see the sun when they are free to exercise their energies as\r\nthey will. If they open their eyes in a land where there is no special\r\nprivilege, then we shall come into a new era of American greatness and\r\nAmerican liberty; but if they open their eyes in a country where they must\r\nbe employees or nothing, if they open their eyes in a land of merely\r\nregulated monopoly, where all the conditions of industry are determined by\r\nsmall groups of men, then they will see an America such as the founders of\r\nthis Republic would have wept to think of. The only hope is in the release\r\nof the forces which philanthropic trust presidents want to monopolize.\r\nOnly the emancipation, the freeing and heartening of the vital energies of\r\nall the people will redeem us. In all that I may have to do in public\r\naffairs in the United States I am going to think of towns such as I have\r\nseen in Indiana, towns of the old American pattern, that own and operate\r\ntheir own industries, hopefully and happily. My thought is going to be\r\nbent upon the multiplication of towns of that kind and the prevention of\r\nthe concentration of industry in this country in such a fashion and upon\r\nsuch a scale that towns that own themselves will be impossible. You know\r\nwhat the vitality of America consists of. Its vitality does not lie in New\r\nYork, nor in Chicago; it will not be sapped by anything that happens in\r\nSt. Louis. The vitality of America lies in the brains, the energies, the\r\nenterprise of the people throughout the land; in the efficiency of their\r\nfactories and in the richness of the fields that stretch beyond the\r\nborders of the town; in the wealth which they extract from nature and\r\noriginate for themselves through the inventive genius characteristic of\r\nall free American communities.\r\n\r\nThat is the wealth of America, and if America discourages the locality,\r\nthe community, the self-contained town, she will kill the nation. A nation\r\nis as rich as her free communities; she is not as rich as her capital city\r\nor her metropolis. The amount of money in Wall Street is no indication of\r\nthe wealth of the American people. That indication can be found only in\r\nthe fertility of the American mind and the productivity of American\r\nindustry everywhere throughout the United States. If America were not rich\r\nand fertile, there would be no money in Wall Street. If Americans were not\r\nvital and able to take care of themselves, the great money exchanges would\r\nbreak down. The welfare, the very existence of the nation, rests at last\r\nupon the great mass of the people; its prosperity depends at last upon the\r\nspirit in which they go about their work in their several communities\r\nthroughout the broad land. In proportion as her towns and her\r\ncountry-sides are happy and hopeful will America realize the high\r\nambitions which have marked her in the eyes of all the world.\r\n\r\nThe welfare, the happiness, the energy and spirit of the men and women who\r\ndo the daily work in our mines and factories, on our railroads, in our\r\noffices and ports of trade, on our farms and on the sea, is the underlying\r\nnecessity of all prosperity. There can be nothing wholesome unless their\r\nlife is wholesome; there can be no contentment unless they are contented.\r\nTheir physical welfare affects the soundness of the whole nation. How\r\nwould it suit the prosperity of the United States, how would it suit\r\nbusiness, to have a people that went every day sadly or sullenly to their\r\nwork? How would the future look to you if you felt that the aspiration had\r\ngone out of most men, the confidence of success, the hope that they might\r\nimprove their condition? Do you not see that just so soon as the old\r\nself-confidence of America, just so soon as her old boasted advantage of\r\nindividual liberty and opportunity, is taken away, all the energy of her\r\npeople begins to subside, to slacken, to grow loose and pulpy, without\r\nfibre, and men simply cast about to see that the day does not end\r\ndisastrously with them?\r\n\r\nSo we must put heart into the people by taking the heartlessness out of\r\npolitics, business, and industry. We have got to make politics a thing in\r\nwhich an honest man can take his part with satisfaction because he knows\r\nthat his opinion will count as much as the next man's, and that the boss\r\nand the interests have been dethroned. Business we have got to untrammel,\r\nabolishing tariff favors, and railroad discrimination, and credit denials,\r\nand all forms of unjust handicaps against the little man. Industry we have\r\ngot to humanize,--not through the trusts,--but through the direct action\r\nof law guaranteeing protection against dangers and compensation for\r\ninjuries, guaranteeing sanitary conditions, proper hours, the right to\r\norganize, and all the other things which the conscience of the country\r\ndemands as the workingman's right. We have got to cheer and inspirit our\r\npeople with the sure prospects of social justice and due reward, with the\r\nvision of the open gates of opportunity for all. We have got to set the\r\nenergy and the initiative of this great people absolutely free, so that\r\nthe future of America will be greater than the past, so that the pride of\r\nAmerica will grow with achievement, so that America will know as she\r\nadvances from generation to generation that each brood of her sons is\r\ngreater and more enlightened than that which preceded it, know that she is\r\nfulfilling the promise that she has made to mankind.\r\n\r\nSuch is the vision of some of us who now come to assist in its\r\nrealization. For we Democrats would not have endured this long burden of\r\nexile if we had not seen a vision. We could have traded; we could have got\r\ninto the game; we could have surrendered and made terms; we could have\r\nplayed the rôle of patrons to the men who wanted to dominate the interests\r\nof the country,--and here and there gentlemen who pretended to be of us\r\ndid make those arrangements. They couldn't stand privation. You never can\r\nstand it unless you have within you some imperishable food upon which to\r\nsustain life and courage, the food of those visions of the spirit where a\r\ntable is set before us laden with palatable fruits, the fruits of hope,\r\nthe fruits of imagination, those invisible things of the spirit which are\r\nthe only things upon which we can sustain ourselves through this weary\r\nworld without fainting. We have carried in our minds, after you had\r\nthought you had obscured and blurred them, the ideals of those men who\r\nfirst set their foot upon America, those little bands who came to make a\r\nfoothold in the wilderness, because the great teeming nations that they\r\nhad left behind them had forgotten what human liberty was, liberty of\r\nthought, liberty of religion, liberty of residence, liberty of action.\r\n\r\nSince their day the meaning of liberty has deepened. But it has not ceased\r\nto be a fundamental demand of the human spirit, a fundamental necessity\r\nfor the life of the soul. And the day is at hand when it shall be realized\r\non this consecrated soil,--a New Freedom,--a Liberty widened and deepened\r\nto match the broadened life of man in modern America, restoring to him in\r\nvery truth the control of his government, throwing wide all gates of\r\nlawful enterprise, unfettering his energies, and warming the generous\r\nimpulses of his heart,--a process of release, emancipation, and\r\ninspiration, full of a breath of life as sweet and wholesome as the airs\r\nthat filled the sails of the caravels of Columbus and gave the promise and\r\nboast of magnificent Opportunity in which America _dare not fail_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY LIFE PRESS, GARDEN CITY, N.Y.",
